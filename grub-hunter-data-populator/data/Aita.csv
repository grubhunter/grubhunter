"TimeOut NY listed Aita as having a bottomless brunch deal on one of their lists in the past--not sure if this was ever the case, but be aware that there's no such deal now. A full bar is available, but drinks are priced normally. That said, place was excellent; from the service to the food itself. 3 of us came for brunch around 11:30 on a Sunday, and only waited about 15-20 minutes for a table. While prices are pretty standard for Clinton Hill haunts, the portions are generous, and the food is definitely above average for neighborhood brunch spots. We ordered the P.E.B.F, the eggs benedict, and the frittata, which were all great. Get the peach juice with whatever you order!",5.0
Super romantic atmosphere and you can actually hear each other talk so this is a great place to take that special somebody! The place gets packed quickly on weekends and Friday nights so make a reservation or get here early.Food was really fantastic. We ordered the oxtail ravioli and cannelloni and both were so savory and creamy. My only gripe was the portion size: definitely could have been slightly bigger. But otherwise a great dining experience.,4.0
"Tristan and I came in on a Wednesday night. It was a full house by the time we were leaving. Super cozy, intimate, small restaurant. Aita is candlelit and has cute decor + a casual bar. Service is super quick and friendly. They gave us bread with olive oil, but the bread was not harm and was kind of stale.I ordered the seafood spaghetti and it was filling and came with plenty of fresh tasting seafood- squid, clams, and shrimp etc. Tristan ordered their special for that night, which was a grilled skirt steak served with polenta. He loved his steak  and said it was amazing.",4.0
"It's pretty rare that I visit a restaurant and want to go back as soon as possible, given the massive dining options that exist in NYC, and in my own neighborhood of Fort Greene. But Aita's brunch got me there - when we approached on a Sunday morning the crowd outside had me worried. We had specifically gotten up early so we wouldn't have to wait! Fortunately, as we got closer, I realized that the restaurant simply didn't open until 11 and so we only had to wait about 5 minutes. Once the clock struck brunch-time, we were ushered in and never wanted for water, coffee refills, condiments, etc. - service was top notch. I had the lemon-ricotta pancakes which were perfectly fluffy and just sweet enough without overpowering my side of bacon. I must say though, that this morning I had the realization that I'm more of a savory brunch person by how envious I was of orders around me - avocado eggs benedict, sweet potato hash, a delicious-looking omelet, and most of all off a very attractive and substantial Bloody Mary! Aita, I will be back!(For the purposes of this review, I will also add that I had dinner at Aita a few months ago and have had drinks at the Mayflower, the speak-easy esque lounge next door, a few times, and have been impressed, but brunch 100% deserves the 5-stars attention).",5.0

"Excellent clinton hill italian restaurant. You can wait in a cozy bar next door which is a nice addition (not a bad whiskey selection there, either).The food here is quite good, especially for the price.  We had oxtail ravioli, cavatelli, and burrata as an appetizer.  The oxtail ravioli was awesome, a unique item here so I wouldn't pass it up.  The burrata here was so-so in my opinion.  burrata is delicious most places, but the walnuts and blend of other ingredients here didn't work quite as well. You can pass on this, I think.  It looks like they changed some of the items here recently, so they aren't afraid to try new things, it seems. Perhaps some of these items may change.Definite good choice if you're in the hood.",4.0
"3.5 AITA is a Michelin recommended, casual restaurant with a Brooklyn hipster meets suburban gardener vibe.The restaurant's decor is well-appointed. Fresh flowers are displayed throughout the space, giving you the sense that you are dining in a semi-outdoor space.The menu is well written. There were many dishes that I was curious to check out. Perhaps it was the unexpected combinations. Take for example, a dish that involved butternut squash with coffee sauce. Say whaaat?!Finally settling on a fish burger and ""Pink Paloma"" bevvy, with my guests opting for the Monte Cristo and oxtail burger, I wasn't nearly as excited after the food came out. Of the three entrees, the oxtail burger (sadly, not my dish) was the best. My fish patty in the burger I ordered was too bread-filler heavy. It would have been better if it were a singular filet of fish, but it was a blend, bound together with a mysterious wheat-based binder. It was a nice concept to have salmon blended with a white fish, as it gave the patty a mottled appearance, but the flavour was underwhelming. The cocktail I ordered was decent but not amazing.It's worthwhile checking out if you're in the area. I don't know if I'd be back anytime soon, however, with the multitude of cool looking dining options in the neighbourhood.",3.0
"This is the boyfriend's favorite neighborhood spot. It's only 6 blocks from his place and we've gone twice together since he discovered it a month ago! 5 stars because: 1) I can tell we're going to be going a lot haha, 2) the food has all been delicious, 3) the atmosphere is good, 4) everyone has been super friendly, 5) the specials keep things interesting!The first time we went, I got the oxtail ravioli because my boyfriend insisted I try it (he had tried it just a week earlier). And, yes, it's just as good as everyone says! The sage brown butter perfectly complements the oxtail. It's a dish that reads salty but not OVERLY salty - just perfectly and deliciously salty, helping to lift up the heavier oxtail flavor. So backtracking to appetizers. We had the braised calamari to start, and the squid was very tender and the squid ink and potato foam combo gave the dish a lot of balance. We also opted to try that day's special app - it was a play on a baked potato and it knocked our socks off!!! I can't quite remember the exact components but it consisted of potato, mushrooms, chives, and a cream component. It was actually the perfect appetizer to have alongside the braised calamari, which had the salty squid ink. Boyfriend got the special entree too - a perfect pork chop that was probably one of the most tender and juicy pork chops I've had. It was melt in your mouth goodness! We went back for a second time this past weekend (you know, when it was 10° outside). The 6 block walk was BRUTAL and the place was packed!  But the hostess told us that we could put our name and phone number down while we wait next door at their bar, Mayflower. We warmed up with a couple of drinks at Mayflower and headed back to Aita once we got a phone call that our table was ready. We had JUST ordered a second round of drinks at Mayflower but they awesomely told us to go ahead to Aita and that they would send the drink along when it was ready.This time, we started with the polipo appetizer. The octopus was very tender (but crispy on the outside) and went very well with the smoked potato, kalamata olives, and sunchokes. If there's only one appetizer you order, I definitely recommend this one! We also had that night's special appetizer: spice rubbed lamb with a salad. The flavor of the lamb really reminded me of Iranian lamb or steak kabob, actually. It was well-cooked but the other apps we've had were better.For mains, I got the semolina trumpets and boyfriend got the seafood stew (that night's special). The trumpets were really good - perfectly cooked pasta and very savory. The short rib was fall apart tender and the sauce was great. (I still like the ravioli better though!) The seafood stew was in a light seafood broth and was super light and satisfying. Then, for dessert we had the apple layer cake with hazelnut ice cream and OMG it is now one of my favorite EVER desserts. Not very sweet at all and the cake portion between the thin layers of apple was almost custard-like in its consistency. The hazelnut ice cream was practically savory, which was super weird in a REALLY GOOD way. Basically, go eat this dessert before they change the dessert menu!!!Oh, and they have good drinks!! I always order whatever they have with mezcal and it's always really yummy. This last time the mezcal cocktail they had included pear liqueur and it had this nice buttery finish. M'mmm.Can't wait to go back!",5.0

"This restaurant deserved the 4-star rating the year that it opened. Not anymore. I lived down the street from Aita before it opened and was so excited about this restaurant when it opened a few years ago ... (it opened in a *cursed* spot - no restaurant/bar has ever lasted in that spot).This year, the quality has exponentially decreased. Their frissee kale salad used to be one of my favorites - but they stopped carrying it! They also used to have a spicy habanero infused cocktail - but they no longer carry it. We recently stumbled here after eating at The Finch down the street. (Read: Bad Idea - Should have stayed at The Finch). The dessert that we ate was so bad - we considered returning it, but decided to just eat the cost. The last 3x that I have patronized Aita I was totally disappointed.

I once sat next to Jason Sudeikis, Olivia Wilde, and their adorable baby there. Some new things were added to their brunch menu, and I tried (and loved) the avocado benedict with jalapeno hollandaise. Home fries, which I often find bland and mushy elsewhere, are delicious here with a lemony Parmesan thing going on. I recommend asking for them extra crispy.They also own Mayflower next-door, which is an equally sweet, tiny cocktail bar.

Such a cute place! The decor is great. It's like having brunch at home. The server and who I assume to be the owner were very kind and checking to see if everything is ok. The food was good for standard eggs Benedict. Just what you would expect. The Devilled eggs however was more like egg salad. Not what I grew up with. But that's very subjective.

I bit into the burger and thought two things..this burger is DAMN good and where is the flavoring of the oxtail? In all honesty it just tasted like a really good burger but being Carribbean I expected more of a strong oxtail taste. Regardless, I murdered that burger. Fries that came with meal were pretty good too--maybe better if they were truffle fries?Salmon hash--I'm not even a fan of fish, but this dish was outstanding. The idea of salmon and hash getting married and procreating on the plate really did wonders on the palate.

"The food is good, I'll give them that. But it's very much an example of overpriced. Portions are small - so if you want to split an appetizer I'd not recommend you order one. Ate there last night. Bill for 2 was $121 plus tip. And I felt ripped off - but that's the area and I guess what we expect from these neighborhood restaurants.  It's hardly worth it though. It's not an upscale dining experience. Waitstaff was hardly professional - they had the casual indifferent style and could hardly answer questions about the food or drinks. My friend's  $12 glass of Italian wine was undrinkable. While I enjoyed my fish it was over salted and I love salt; ( same with house salad - too much salt.However it was not a total bomb either. The food was good enough to remark on. My friend got a mushroom pasta dish she thought tasted very good. Portion was tiny though.Anyway, much if my critique is not unique to this particular establishment - it's just emphasized to me because I ventured out once again on Brooklyn.",3.0

Interesting refreshing brunch drunk options.The bad My only negative is I had the brunch platter with 2 eggs, blueberry pancake , home fries salad and bacon. Was not a fan of somewhat thick doughy pancake with singular blueberry. No syrup to the table. So I thought that's how they do it but half way through lady next to us asked and got some syrup.In other words super minor issues in a overall tasty spot.Overall can't wait to come here for lunch or dinner with their slew of delicious sounding mains. Would love if they added gluten free pasta options but probably will just take hit and try one of their homemade pasta options. If you are a fan of Locanda Olio a few blocks off, you will love this place.",4.0

Quinoa pesto salad - unique quinoa and basil mixture topping some greens and interesting radish slices. Roasted suckling pig - moist, flavorful, generous portion. Pan seared fluke with sweet potato puree, shaved aspargus and barley risotto - Great flavor combination. Espresso mouse with Sambuca gelatin - best dessert I've had in a while, subtle but sophisticated flavors. I can see why this is a popular spot for people who live nearby.",4.0
"I wasn't planning on going to Aita, but when my girlfriend and I walked past we decided to make an impulse decision and try it out. Which was a great call, because our dinner was delicious. Course: AppetizerWe Aita...cheeseboard! The cheese board had 5 ""cheeses"". One was a really strong spreadable cheese (don't smell it), one was a pile of brownish mush (I have no idea what it was), one was a stack of what may or may not have been orange rinds (or apricots? who knows), and two were more normal cheeses (really good). It came with three slices of bread, each slice given one at a time, only on request, and with increasing levels of skepticism over how on earth we could need so much bread with our cheese. Overall, it was good but I wouldn't get it again. Course: Main DishWe Aita...lot of pasta! We split the spaghetti, the orechitetta (that's how I pronounced it at least), and a side of yucca fries. The spaghetti was phenomenal, full of fish and shrimp and mussels and spaghetti. Five year old me would have been horrified that someone did that to spaghetti, but I'll go out on a limb and say it was way better than the spaghetti and tomato sauce dishes of my youth. I'm going to stop trying to spell/say the other pasta, but it was full of lamb ragu, peas and carrots, and was in a surprisingly deep bowl. The spaghetti won our pasta battle, but it was probably an overtime victory where anyone could have won and it was all the refs' fault somehow. The yucca fries were a nice side dish but somehow tasted nothing like my how my school dining hall made them, which is a huge point in their favor. Course: DessertWe Aita...nothing! First glance at the pasta made it seem like I'd leave hungry, but I definitely didn't need any dessert after realizing how surprisingly full the portions were. Bonus: BathroomWe Aita...no, we didn't eat anything in the bathroom, or at least I didn't. But fortunately I was able to take a quick trip to the toilette (say it with an eye-talian accent) and play with the super cool typewriter! Gone are the days when a trip to the restroom ruins your productivity, because with the handy typewriter, you can relieve yourself while also keeping up on your correspondence. All together, Aita was a nice find in a cool neighborhood that I would definitely recommend.",4.0
"I've been to Aita twice now, both times for dinner, and it really is a gem in the area. The decor reminds me of a cute farmhouse and the service is outstanding--both times the waiters and servers were on their game. On my recent trip, dinner began with drinks and bread (each person receives their own portion!). I had the spaghetti, which sounds like a simple dish but the flavors were outstanding, and the mixture of seafood very fresh. My date had the pan seared cod, which was also cooked well. We dined a bit later at night, but we didn't feel rushed, and were even asked if we wanted more drinks or dessert. There were a few small groups sharing bottles of wine and chatting as well. I don't remember all of my meal from my previous visit, but I split the cast iron skirt steak and I do remember that we enjoyed it--sometimes a perfectly cooked steak is all you need.

"simply fantastic food. we split appetizers around the table... and everyone enjoyed bites of the calamari and potato foam (squid ink is perfectly briny) octopus and tomatoes (octopus was perfectly cooked, which I gather is hard from watching people fail to cook it right on Top Chef) and the green tomato and corn salad (so summery.) We also enjoyed the cucumber smash cocktail. If there's a line, its worth the wait.",5.0
"The food is good, I'll give them that. But it's very much an example of overpriced. Portions are small - so if you want to split an appetizer I'd not recommend you order one. Ate there last night. Bill for 2 was $121 plus tip. And I felt ripped off - but that's the area and I guess what we expect from these neighborhood restaurants.  It's hardly worth it though. It's not an upscale dining experience. Waitstaff was hardly professional - they had the casual indifferent style and could hardly answer questions about the food or drinks. My friend's  $12 glass of Italian wine was undrinkable. While I enjoyed my fish it was over salted and I love salt; ( same with house salad - too much salt.However it was not a total bomb either. The food was good enough to remark on. My friend got a mushroom pasta dish she thought tasted very good. Portion was tiny though.Anyway, much if my critique is not unique to this particular establishment - it's just emphasized to me because I ventured out once again on Brooklyn.",3.0
"What happened tonight, Aita? You used to care. Immediately after finishing our meal I took to Yelp to see what happened to the Aita of 2014. Sure enough, a couple reviewers felt the same. Maybe there was a change of management. Maybe it was just an off night. Either way, there was a general lack of love this evening from the cold service to the undercooked pasta. I'll try again but fool me once, shame on me, fool me twice, I'll stick with The Finch.",3.0

"The goodCute vintage styled little Clinton hill true Italian gem. Friendly attentive service. Well portioned well seasoned well priced  inventive brunch dishes with an Italian accent .Perfect cappuccino ( true Italy style) with almond milk option for dairy intolerant folks. Interesting refreshing brunch drunk options.The bad My only negative is I had the brunch platter with 2 eggs, blueberry pancake , home fries salad and bacon. Was not a fan of somewhat thick doughy pancake with singular blueberry. No syrup to the table. So I thought that's how they do it but half way through lady next to us asked and got some syrup.In other words super minor issues in a overall tasty spot.Overall can't wait to come here for lunch or dinner with their slew of delicious sounding mains. Would love if they added gluten free pasta options but probably will just take hit and try one of their homemade pasta options. If you are a fan of Locanda Olio a few blocks off, you will love this place.",4.0
"On a corner in a nice Brooklyn neighborhood, this experience was perfect for the mood we were in. Unassuming, creatively decorated, friendly, and comfortable. And the food was outstanding. Our sampling included: A fava bean/arugula salad - Nicely balanced mix of beans, arugula, parmesan, and dressing. Quinoa pesto salad - unique quinoa and basil mixture topping some greens and interesting radish slices. Roasted suckling pig - moist, flavorful, generous portion. Pan seared fluke with sweet potato puree, shaved aspargus and barley risotto - Great flavor combination. Espresso mouse with Sambuca gelatin - best dessert I've had in a while, subtle but sophisticated flavors. I can see why this is a popular spot for people who live nearby.",4.0
"I wasn't planning on going to Aita, but when my girlfriend and I walked past we decided to make an impulse decision and try it out. Which was a great call, because our dinner was delicious. Course: AppetizerWe Aita...cheeseboard! The cheese board had 5 ""cheeses"". One was a really strong spreadable cheese (don't smell it), one was a pile of brownish mush (I have no idea what it was), one was a stack of what may or may not have been orange rinds (or apricots? who knows), and two were more normal cheeses (really good). It came with three slices of bread, each slice given one at a time, only on request, and with increasing levels of skepticism over how on earth we could need so much bread with our cheese. Overall, it was good but I wouldn't get it again. Course: Main DishWe Aita...lot of pasta! We split the spaghetti, the orechitetta (that's how I pronounced it at least), and a side of yucca fries. The spaghetti was phenomenal, full of fish and shrimp and mussels and spaghetti. Five year old me would have been horrified that someone did that to spaghetti, but I'll go out on a limb and say it was way better than the spaghetti and tomato sauce dishes of my youth. I'm going to stop trying to spell/say the other pasta, but it was full of lamb ragu, peas and carrots, and was in a surprisingly deep bowl. The spaghetti won our pasta battle, but it was probably an overtime victory where anyone could have won and it was all the refs' fault somehow. The yucca fries were a nice side dish but somehow tasted nothing like my how my school dining hall made them, which is a huge point in their favor. Course: DessertWe Aita...nothing! First glance at the pasta made it seem like I'd leave hungry, but I definitely didn't need any dessert after realizing how surprisingly full the portions were. Bonus: BathroomWe Aita...no, we didn't eat anything in the bathroom, or at least I didn't. But fortunately I was able to take a quick trip to the toilette (say it with an eye-talian accent) and play with the super cool typewriter! Gone are the days when a trip to the restroom ruins your productivity, because with the handy typewriter, you can relieve yourself while also keeping up on your correspondence. All together, Aita was a nice find in a cool neighborhood that I would definitely recommend.",4.0
"I've been to Aita twice now, both times for dinner, and it really is a gem in the area. The decor reminds me of a cute farmhouse and the service is outstanding--both times the waiters and servers were on their game. On my recent trip, dinner began with drinks and bread (each person receives their own portion!). I had the spaghetti, which sounds like a simple dish but the flavors were outstanding, and the mixture of seafood very fresh. My date had the pan seared cod, which was also cooked well. We dined a bit later at night, but we didn't feel rushed, and were even asked if we wanted more drinks or dessert. There were a few small groups sharing bottles of wine and chatting as well. I don't remember all of my meal from my previous visit, but I split the cast iron skirt steak and I do remember that we enjoyed it--sometimes a perfectly cooked steak is all you need. I highly recommend Aita--you're in for a great experience.",5.0

"Aita is a neighborhood gem and my go-to brunch spot. I've been coming here for over a year and have never been disappointed with the service, food, or the drinks. My favorites are the oxtail burger, the holy scramble, the braised beef hash, the fritatta, eggs benedict, and the pancakes. Aita, if you're reading this - bring back the carbonara! That was the best carbonara of my life. All in all, it's highly affordable, great food with lovely staff. There is always a wait (30 mins tops) so get there early. But, if you have to wait, they just opened the Mayflower next door so you can grab a coffee, tea, mimosa, or one of their lovely specialty cocktails while you wait for your table. They'll bring over your drinks if you aren't finished before your table is ready and they'll come over to call you when your table is ready. Fabulous service. An absolute gem.",5.0
"I stopped in at Aita on a chilly January afternoon for a delicious cocktail, after discovering that the bar next door I'd intended to visit was closed. It was very quiet, but it was quite early on a Tuesday evening just after new year.The cocktail menu is short and stellar with a number of drinks that really piqued my interest, a good solid list of interesting combinations. I usually prioritise gin but at Aita I had a drink from the scotch cocktail list (ok, it had damson gin in it too) called a Casablanca (I believe most of the drinks on the list are house specials). It definitely warmed my cockles and fortified me for the rest of the trundle home in the bitter cold!The staff also went to great efforts to assist me inside with my broken ankle, and to turn their liquor cabinets upside-down searching for some Kahlua for my mum's spiked hot chocolate request.

Our biggest disappointment was a lack of gelato on the menu, it was served with other deserts but not alone. Over all it was a great evening and I would highly recommend.",4.0
My family and I went for brunch today. Let me start by saying the food was amazing! However the service was terrible. I have worked in a restaurant for the past 5 years and I know the difference between having a bad day and bad service. It was slow and we were constantly forgotten about. I'm surprised management is not on top of this because they could have turned our table over 40 min faster then they did if our server stayed on top of our order and getting the check at the end of the meal. The hostess was super helpful but her outfit was a little to much for the brunch atmosphere.

"What an amazing dinner. I've heard that Aita does veggies impeccably, so my friend and I stuck mostly to those. We got the arugula salad, buratta, crispy asparagus, and snap peas with pancetta then shared the poached cod special. We literally cleaned every plate. Every vegetable was cooked simply, seasoned and dressed with the perfect amounts of savory, salty, and acidity. One of my favorite things about Aita is how they are truly committed to the best seasonal ingredients (there were bites of yummy zucchini in different forms in just about every dish) but they are not self-aggrandizing about it like many restaurants who make this same commitment. Service was wonderful--our waitress was charming and friendly and very attentive. I can't wait to go back.",5.0

Our server was really sweet (Sorry I totally forgot her name) the drink I wanted yo try was from the summer menu so she recommended the ""Vermonter"" which tasted like Thanksgiving/Christmas  weird I know but if you ever try it you'll understand.Our appetizers were small but so DELICIOUS we had the Kale salad & Mussels. And when my Oxtail.burger arrived I swear I heard angels singing!!!!! IT WAS SOOOOO DAMN GOOD! I added an egg to mine and I gotta Say my taste buds loved it. My brother added bacon to his but did say he wished his seasoned just a tad bit more, but still enjoyed his non the less. His only complaint was wanted more fries.

"Unexpected. Romantic. Subtle. Modest. Delicious.Aita is by far one of the best restaurants in Fort Greene and Clinton Hill along with Walters and Romans. We go there often and one of us always gets the mushroom cavatelli. It's THAT good. Beautifully designed, it looks as if it's been in there for decades. Dim lighting makes it a great romantic dinner spot.If you have to wait for a table, which is likely on a Friday or Saturday night, visit their bar next door, the Mayflower, and get a Trotsky.",5.0
"Sunday brunch was PERFECT. I don't say this lightly, because I am picky about eggs and fanatical about potatoes, so while many brunch places are good, few are great. Aita definitely nailed it. I had the omelette with mushrooms, goat cheese and, who would have guessed, butternut squash. I'd never thought to put squash in an egg dish but it added a delicious, surprising sweet note that really made the dish. The home fries were among the best I've ever had: super crispy and topped with a little bit of parmesan cheese. I was going to eat my dad's (because I'm considerate like that) but he got to them first.This was another parent brunch outing and it also earned the coveted parental seal of approval. Mom had blueberry pancakes with lemon ricotta cream. They were served with syrup but you do NOT need it! The blueberry compote on top was enough. The pancakes themselves were thick and fluffy, the kind I dream about and can never find. You know, I keep telling myself I don't like pancakes, but somehow I couldn't stop borrowing little bites. Obviously just to make sure they were okay, because again, I'm very considerate. Dad got the breakfast plate with eggs and a single pancake (no lemon cream, sadly). I'd report on that but I wasn't allowed to try any.On top of it, the restaurant itself is very cute and cozy. I love the reclaimed windows and vintage treasures scattered around the room - they're charming without being cliche. Even the bathroom is well-decorated -- actually, it's nicer than most apartments, which I guess could be a good or bad sign depending on how you look at things.Overall, a winner. I'll be back soon to try dinner...or maybe just to sit at the bar and eat home fries. We'll see.",5.0
"I have had the great pleasure of having dinner and brunch at Aita since they opened a few months ago. Both meals were equally enjoyable and the service was top notch. My first experience was for dinner during the work week where I dined on their cavatelli with kale . YUMMY. Perfectly seasoned, comforting and filling to say the least. The prices are similar to many in the fort greene/clinton hill area, but nothing crazy. Brunch was a lively vibe with a side of delish! I had the pancakes with a fruit compote on top. The pancakes were thick and fluffy with TONS of flavor.I look forward to dining at Aita for many meals to come.",4.0
"My wife and I have often wandered past this corner location on our way to Atlantic terminal, and over the past few years it has been at least two different bars/restaurants. The other day we decided to check out the latest incarnation, Aita, for at least a drink.The space is really cozy, with a solid marble L shaped bar and laid back atmosphere. My wife had a cocktail and I had an IPA. We got there at the right time as the bar filled up soon after we took our seats. Having perused the menu over my beer, I decided to try the oxtail ravioli and my wife had a side of her favorite veggies, Brussels sprouts. My ravioli was really good and we both really liked the Brussels in a dash of balsamic.After another IPA we left and the place was really buzzing, with not a seat left at either the bar or the tables. The place was well staffed with attentive servers. We really liked  the place and will definitely go back. It is good to see new neighborhood places taking off and I think this place will continue to do really well in the area.",4.0

My  personal favorite is the smoked pastrami salmon benedict. Its served on fried green tomatoes with a side of delicious potatoes and a flavorful little salad. The only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is that the dessert menu is lacking. I had the chocolate fondente and was less than impressed. The berry gelato was fine but it really didn't do much for me. A simple panna cotta with berries or a canoli on the menu would be a great addition!",4.0

"So I heard rumors about an Oxtail Burger and I just knew it was gonna be one big.wild goose chase and by golly I found it here!  So i decided to make my way here for lunch and I must say I love this place,  it was quite dainty. Our server was really sweet (Sorry I totally forgot her name) the drink I wanted yo try was from the summer menu so she recommended the ""Vermonter"" which tasted like Thanksgiving/Christmas  weird I know but if you ever try it you'll understand.Our appetizers were small but so DELICIOUS we had the Kale salad & Mussels. And when my Oxtail.burger arrived I swear I heard angels singing!!!!! IT WAS SOOOOO DAMN GOOD! I added an egg to mine and I gotta Say my taste buds loved it. My brother added bacon to his but did say he wished his seasoned just a tad bit more, but still enjoyed his non the less. His only complaint was wanted more fries. I will most definitely be back whenever I'm in Brooklyn again!",4.0
"Unexpected. Romantic. Subtle. Modest. Delicious.Aita is by far one of the best restaurants in Fort Greene and Clinton Hill along with Walters and Romans. We go there often and one of us always gets the mushroom cavatelli. It's THAT good. Beautifully designed, it looks as if it's been in there for decades. Dim lighting makes it a great romantic dinner spot.If you have to wait for a table, which is likely on a Friday or Saturday night, visit their bar next door, the Mayflower, and get a Trotsky.",5.0
"Sunday brunch was PERFECT. I don't say this lightly, because I am picky about eggs and fanatical about potatoes, so while many brunch places are good, few are great. Aita definitely nailed it. I had the omelette with mushrooms, goat cheese and, who would have guessed, butternut squash. I'd never thought to put squash in an egg dish but it added a delicious, surprising sweet note that really made the dish. The home fries were among the best I've ever had: super crispy and topped with a little bit of parmesan cheese. I was going to eat my dad's (because I'm considerate like that) but he got to them first.This was another parent brunch outing and it also earned the coveted parental seal of approval. Mom had blueberry pancakes with lemon ricotta cream. They were served with syrup but you do NOT need it! The blueberry compote on top was enough. The pancakes themselves were thick and fluffy, the kind I dream about and can never find. You know, I keep telling myself I don't like pancakes, but somehow I couldn't stop borrowing little bites. Obviously just to make sure they were okay, because again, I'm very considerate. Dad got the breakfast plate with eggs and a single pancake (no lemon cream, sadly). I'd report on that but I wasn't allowed to try any.On top of it, the restaurant itself is very cute and cozy. I love the reclaimed windows and vintage treasures scattered around the room - they're charming without being cliche. Even the bathroom is well-decorated -- actually, it's nicer than most apartments, which I guess could be a good or bad sign depending on how you look at things.Overall, a winner. I'll be back soon to try dinner...or maybe just to sit at the bar and eat home fries. We'll see.",5.0
"I have had the great pleasure of having dinner and brunch at Aita since they opened a few months ago. Both meals were equally enjoyable and the service was top notch. My first experience was for dinner during the work week where I dined on their cavatelli with kale . YUMMY. Perfectly seasoned, comforting and filling to say the least. The prices are similar to many in the fort greene/clinton hill area, but nothing crazy. Brunch was a lively vibe with a side of delish! I had the pancakes with a fruit compote on top. The pancakes were thick and fluffy with TONS of flavor.I look forward to dining at Aita for many meals to come.",4.0
"My wife and I have often wandered past this corner location on our way to Atlantic terminal, and over the past few years it has been at least two different bars/restaurants. The other day we decided to check out the latest incarnation, Aita, for at least a drink.The space is really cozy, with a solid marble L shaped bar and laid back atmosphere. My wife had a cocktail and I had an IPA. We got there at the right time as the bar filled up soon after we took our seats. Having perused the menu over my beer, I decided to try the oxtail ravioli and my wife had a side of her favorite veggies, Brussels sprouts. My ravioli was really good and we both really liked the Brussels in a dash of balsamic.After another IPA we left and the place was really buzzing, with not a seat left at either the bar or the tables. The place was well staffed with attentive servers. We really liked  the place and will definitely go back. It is good to see new neighborhood places taking off and I think this place will continue to do really well in the area.",4.0
"Ssshhh the secret may be out.  Great little spot in an ""up and coming"" neighborhood not too much to do before or after dinner except for it's tiny little bar next door.  Food was top notch and service was fantastic.  Sorry no reservations unless a party of more than 6 --- which is awkward given the small size of the restuarant.  Shout out To all parties of six and larger please go to the Olive Garden and stop hogging up the space.",5.0

The dishes are always really tasty - innovative without being pretentious. I especially love the salads! Really homey dining room, nice staff. It gets pricey when you end up ordering multiple dishes because they all sound so good - I dropped $100 on dinner (& drinks) for two last night.Worth it.",4.0
"Awesome spot. Very friendly staff. Beautiful, homely decor (I feel like I'm visiting an Italian Grandmother, and I mean that in the best way). In an off-the-beaten-path location that will never attract tourists or williamsburg crowds, so it's pretty neighborhoody and I love that.The brunch is full of simple and classic recipes that are fantastically executed--the home fries are perfect! The oxtail burger is a must-have, the pancakes are done just right, and the egg dishes are cooked perfectly every time (you'd be surprised how many restaurants can fuck up something as simple as an egg, but not Aita!).Dinner is even better (or at least more thrilling and creative recipes to choose from). And if you've got a long wait, you can have a drink at the sister-bar, Mayflower, which is oh-so-charming.So why four stars? At brunch, the coffee leaves a lot to be desired: I'm pretty sure it's something like Cafe Bustelo brewed diner style, which is to say not up to the quality of their food. Strange they don't serve a better roast. Also I tried an Americano there once; it tasted burnt and so bad that I had to send it back (which I rarely ever do). Lastly, it would be nice if they had fresh-squeezed juice available for brunch. But hey, whatever, small prices to pay when the food and ambiance is so great.",4.0

"I'll open with a caveat - this is only 4 stars because I didn't get a chance to try their coffee. On an icy, slippery, rainy Sunday, I met my friends here for brunch. After a slow-paced and chilly walk, I was so relieved to be indoors. I got comfortable, noted the Bloody Marys my friends were drinking, and figured I'd have some coffee before getting crunk. Aita was having a problem with their water, so they couldn't make any coffee that day, but allowed me to dash across the street to Primrose Cafe and bring in a cup. Luckily, the rain had briefly stopped.But this isn't about that morning. This is just the context - if Aita had been terrible, this would be the start of a scathing review. But it was GREAT. Everything was delicious. The blueberry pancakes with lemon ricotta cream were sweet, savory, and perfect. The eggs (simple scrambled eggs!) were fluffy and buttery. The Bloody Mary made with their black peppercorn gin was spicy and refreshing. My friend moaned as he ate his omelet and we all agreed that the home fries were a cut above.Also, the service was excellent. Despite the plumbing issues, which apparently were on hold until we finished our meal (whoops), we were never once rushed.

Atmosphere is welcoming and food is absolutely well prepared as the italian tradition wants but at the same time a step further from the traditional food.You have to try the grilled octopus and the pork chop, they are amazing (italian advice).Service was friendly and attentive.I will definitely go back to try new winter dishes.",5.0

"MUST GO!kale salad is amazing!!Octopus appetizer is amazing!!and if you like spicey drinks... they have a mixed drink with habanero infused liquor (vodka or rum - can't remember)they are so so sweet and when we wanted to make our drink more spicey, they accommodated... The owner is always there and has given us excellent recommendations.It is the perfect feel of brooklyn - a relaxed, warm, friendly atmosphere with amazing food and drinks.",5.0

"The interior is really cool. Speaking of cool it was too cool in there, they did not have the heat on when I went in for a late lunch.  So I had a chill while I ate my food. Also I ordered a fish burger with a side of fries.  The fish burger was suppose to be cod & salmon.  It was probably 99%cod & 1%salmon.  It was bland and pretty flat tasting.  On the menu it said it was $14 but when the bill arrived it was suddenly $15.  The fries tasted like they were the frozen fries you would pick up from a key food--generic, tasteless &reheated.  I think this place is for the transplants(and there are so many now!) who have moved in to fort greene who maybe have a different palette/standards.  As a native, I would not go back to this place or recommend it.",1.0

Being that we don't eat meat, we shared the two veggie pasta dishes--I can't remember the names, but one was a chard cavatelli dish (I think) and the other had vegetables, including butternut squash, in a leek sauce.

"I see Aita all the time on my way to work so I decided to pop in earlier today for brunch. I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. The brunch here is very good. I ordered the 2 scrambled eggs, with bacon, potatoes and a pancake and this meal had wonderful flavors. Everything was coked the way I like it. The pancake (my absolute favorite thing in the world) was very tasty. They definitely know how to make a blueberry pancake here. The prices are pretty moderate, but I do feel that the portion was a bit small. You only get one pancake which is more of the silver dollar variety and you barely get any potatoes. Granted I was able to overlook this because it tasted good, but I like to leave a pace satisfied, not looking for something else to eat in another hour. Most places either give you way too much or not enough at all and Aita unfortunately falls in the latter category.

"Hands down my favorite restaurant in Clinton Hill.  Admittedly is really convenient but there are a lot of restaurants in this neighborhood and I still find myself at Aita at least once a week.  The bar at the restaurant is my favorite part of the place -- super laid back, comfortable to eat at, AMAZING drinks, great bartenders (especially Noah).  It's the kind of place you want to stop into at the end of a good day, or a crappy day, to have a drink and relax.  The food is also top notch and always changing.  They typically have a Frito Misto appetizer which is an outstanding sharing item and the Mussels come in a creamy sauce with bacon that demands to be lapped up with bread.  I tend toward the pastas and have never been disappointed.  One of the owners, Giulia, is typically at the restaurant making sure that the guests are having a good time.  I have never personally known a restaurant's owner but she makes you feel really at home and always says hello. Brunch is just as good but definitely get there early as the place quickly fills up.  HIGHLY recommended.",5.0

"Hands down my favorite restaurant in Clinton Hill.  Admittedly is really convenient but there are a lot of restaurants in this neighborhood and I still find myself at Aita at least once a week.  The bar at the restaurant is my favorite part of the place -- super laid back, comfortable to eat at, AMAZING drinks, great bartenders (especially Noah).  It's the kind of place you want to stop into at the end of a good day, or a crappy day, to have a drink and relax.  The food is also top notch and always changing.  They typically have a Frito Misto appetizer which is an outstanding sharing item and the Mussels come in a creamy sauce with bacon that demands to be lapped up with bread.  I tend toward the pastas and have never been disappointed.  One of the owners, Giulia, is typically at the restaurant making sure that the guests are having a good time.  I have never personally known a restaurant's owner but she makes you feel really at home and always says hello. Brunch is just as good but definitely get there early as the place quickly fills up.  HIGHLY recommended.",5.0
"Nice addition to the hood, I think.  Same owners as Forio down in Williamsburg, yet this place has a much quainter, more local feel in my opinion.  Food was tasty, well priced and atmosphere was inviting.  My fiance mentioned that the fish was pretty salty, but I found my pasta dish to be well seasoned.  Will definitely be going back.  Great place for smaller groups or just 2.",4.0
"The meal was very good.  First course was a Roasted Cauliflower, Radicchio and Chili Vinaigrette, with a glass of 2011 Occhipinti Alter Ego, a white wine version from Aleatico grapes -- fresh, unusual, delightful.  Second course was the Garganelli, with Roasted Butternut Squash, Oyster and Shiitake Mushrooms, and a Leek Sauce.  For the finale, a cup of delicious Neapolitan espresso with a biscotto was perfect.  The hostess, Julia, was very accommodating, the ambience was lovely, and the food was well-done.",4.0
This place is amazing. So cute. Nice staff. We had the pancake/bacon/homefries combo and the chocolate french toast...and a side of the cannellini beans. All amazing. I am perplexed at the fact that no one has reviewed the chocolate french toast yet. This stuff is insane. IN-SANE. Although its definitely a dessert breakfast.....i couldnt finish it in one sitting. If you have a healthy brunch appetite...get two other entrees and then split this for brunch dessert. You CANNOT pass it up. Can't wait to go back for another brunch and give dinner a try at this spot!,5.0
"I eat a LOT. And I have lived in Clinton Hill awhile. Last night, we walked into Aita for the first time. I ordered the Oxtail Ravioli and it was seriously the best pasta dish I have ever had. In my entire life. The bartender, Noah, is so sweet, and gave us nice, generous pours of wine. Order the Oxtail Ravioli. You will NOT be disappointed!!!",5.0
"Finally, the dreadful Speakeasy is replaced! Although the food is relatively pricey, it is delicious. Their grilled octopus salad was splendidly served on a bed of bitter watercress along with a sweet yet sour tangelo. The oxtail ravioli was great, heavy with a thick sauce. Service was great, and overall, this is a warm welcome to Clinton Hill!",5.0
"Lovely Sunday dinner with my husband and another couple this past Sunday. Very cozy and romantic atmosphere, my husband and I were seated even though our friends had not yet arrived, and we assured them they would be there in 10 minutes. Friendly staff, delicious drinks and a nice wine list by the glass. I had the best Old Fashioned I have ever tasted, it was perfectly mixed and the right balance of sweet and boozy. All of our food was delicious, especially my sun choke salad with mushrooms-heaven. My risotto was a bit on the sweet side for my taste, almost like a rice pudding with butternut squash flavor, but still well done nonetheless. The meal was well paced, the portions on the generous side (and certainly well priced), and the staff checked on our food and water glasses frequently.  They also have a little bar in the back called Mayflower with a separate entrance which looks like a speakeasy, very nice atmosphere but I ordered the same drink and it wasn't half as good (different bartender). I'll be back!",4.0
"So glad to have an excellent, reasonably priced restaurant in the neighborhood. Our food was perfection - oxtail ravioli (portion size a touch small for my husband for the price), cavatelli w. kale and sausage, and an amazing summer salad. Drinks were amazing! Great services, beautiful decor. Only concern - a touch small for us (tables close together). I can get over that though.",4.0
"We waited a LONG time for the Speakeasy successor, and we do have it at last! We went last Monday, the very first night it was opened, and our party of 5 (including a not-so-easy to please toddler, a finicky eater who literally devoured his bowl of custom made cheese cavatelli!) was very please with all their choices: a fantastic vegetable fritto misto, light as air, with a bowl of delicious minty yoghurt sauce, a lovely artichoke salad, a great salumi plate, and great pastas (their very personal twist on spaghetti alle vongole with shishito peppers, lovely oxtail ragout ravioli, and great orecchiette with kale and sausage. We hardly had room for dessert but the one we tried (almond cake) was moist and delicious.. Service was very charming, they have a full license and a small choice of interesting house cocktails, and what to appears a varied and interesting wine list (we had a very good Roero Arneis, a white from Piedmont) In bocca al lupo Aita! We'll be back!",4.0
"I've been waiting for a place like Aita to open up in Clinton Hill for a long time.  Some friends and I went there for brunch recently and had a terrific experience.  The space is filled with light and gorgeous touches like beautiful textiles on the banquettes and vintage sterling barware.  The staff was gracious and mostly efficient--they're still working out some kinks (ketchup, hot sauce and salt and pepper should be de rigeur items on the table at brunch).  I had the rich and divine fried oyster eggs benedict.  A real treat and my friends had the frittata and the egg BLT.  Everyone enjoyed their food.  The bloody mary was a bit dull--I asked for spicy and no dice.  But it was a big serving in a mason jar.  Nice music, nice ambiance, a really good spot.  I can't wait to go for dinner!  Also, dig the mrs. murphy's soap in the bathroom too--it's the little touches that sometimes make a place feel really great.",4.0
"I used to go to Fiore in Williamsburg, so I was excited to read that the same chef is involved in this place.    I was sooo happy to see one of my favorite dishes included on the menu -- the raw artichoke salad.  (BUT, bring back the shaved parmesan instead of the parmesan ""croutons."")   I ordered the canelloni and it was wonderful.  I also had tastes of my friends' dishes and the fish special with the carmelized onions and roasted beets was fabulous, but the chicken dish was somewhat eh by comparison.  I appreciated the fact that, while the place was lively, the four of us could easily have a conversation without having to shout.   The service was excellent / prompt & our waitress was charming and friendly without being overly friendly.    It was a little warm sitting by the window -- that was the only down side.  On the the other hand, I'm the kind of person who would rather be too warm than too cold.",5.0
