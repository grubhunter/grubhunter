"Been to Baron's three times. First experience was great. It was a bit slow, so the bartender and owner both engaged with me as I waited for an old acquaintance out for drinks and oysters around happy hour. The beers were solid selections, some small local places and some selections from further afield-- a stout from eastern Europe was on tap, for example. Second experience I decided to bring a group from work. Great ambiance, attentive service and solid, simple menu with great wine and beer selections did not fail to impress. Everybody was happy with food. Drawback- short on oysters, had to share 18 among the 7 of us. Third experience just this weekend, a date w wifey. Started with an interesting soup and some oysters. Soup was nice, but oysters a bit less sexy than previous offerings- can't whine about the price tag and their prep remained classic and classy (they really clean them well, with no gristle remaining around edges). Wife ordered what I had last- a delicious potato cake with a completely unique scallion (yes) puree- a highlight. Oh yeah, sorry, it was a salmon dish. The filet was great and the skin muy crispy..what I usually try and fail to do chez moi. About once a year this pesca sins and orders a steak and this became my plan since I saw the amazing, ample steaks my colleagues enjoyed on the last trip. Though my portion was no longer cut so massively, it was nonetheless cooked to perfection. An excellent sear (*almost* a bit toooo brule) and an appropriate medium-rare cook. Worth the death of cow, mea culpa. The mark of a worthwhile restaurant experience: Every entree I have ordered here has been executed better than I could hope to do as a wannabe fancy home cook. To boot, on each occasion the music selection was on point and despite relatively few customers, the service was always relaxed. A very chill spot with real food. Oh yeah, great coffee and a really solid staff. Room for growth would have me rate 4/5, but I want more people to come here so I am grade inflating to 5/5.",5.0
"Welcome to the neighborhood, Baron's! We came here for a formal date night and had a pretty good experience. The decor in this place is so adorable, and the drink selection is good and fairly priced. Our server was very attentive and let us order off the happy hour menu even though it had just ended. My boyfriend ordered the Brick Pressed Chicken, which he liked quite a bit. As a pescetarian, there were fewer options on the menu for me, so I went with the Yelp favorite and server's recommendation--the Mixed Beans and Mushrooms Vegan Burger. Unfortunately, my vegan burger came out dry and overcooked. I would come back for drinks but not sure about dinner. They change the menu oftenish, so maybe!",3.0
"Great little hidden spot in the heart of Bed-sty.The bartender Casey is awesome, friendly and a damn good mixologist. Happy hour Oysters are a bargain. Love the music and the decor is friendly and very east Village style.Highly recommend it.",4.0
"One Friday evening, we had the urge for oyster happy hour. Since I've committed to experiencing different restaurants whenever I have this urge, I was able to quickly find barons  who offered $1 oysters during happy hour. No marriage to blue point oysters here- thank you! This Friday in particular they had oysters from Virginia (I forget the name now). We got there around 5 pm and were the only people there. It was kind of perfect though. The lighting was pretty dim in the back section and made for a cool early date. The waiter was awesome, attentive and friendly (couldn't come up with another ""a"" word just now). We also ordered cocktails- one was very tasty (some type of Hennessy cocktails), the other was a caipirinha and left a great deal to be desired in comparison to others that I've had in the past. That was disappointing, but the bartender definitely tried to if it once he caught wind. The dinner menu seemed creative, so I would certainly consider this as a dinner option if we're in the area.",4.0
"A confusing place. Have been excited to pop in for a bite and drinks since I biked past it last summer -- the weekend scene with music and the tall windows looked inviting from outside. Maybe it's nicer on the weekend. I have only written 2 yelp reviews since 2010 in NY but I really hope this is a wake up call to the management and potential clientele. It's not a terrible place. It's just a massive disappointment, considering the seemingly pleasant menu and great space.If you don't expect much service (ie; silverware.... to eat with...), are flexible on what you can eat (menu vs reality a disappointment), and don't mind listening to high school suburb jamz ie; singles from Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix while collegey white dudes loudly intone from the bar........ you're probably gonna be fine here. All of those things are fine if that's what you're into. Just steer clear if you aren't.It was like 30 degrees out yesterday and we were happy to come into the warm interior with the lovely high ceilings. We ordered a bottle of cava and some food. Unfortunately, throughout the meal, as the bartender came and went with a lady friend, he continuously left the door open, which left super cold air blowing on us. We didn't get why he couldn't just close the door as he came and went. It was quickly apparent why only the bar was full and we were the only ones seated for food.Some of the menu was unavailable which was no big deal, but the waiter seemed to be confused about what the menu even consisted of -- which we found odd, 'cause it was like... 8 items.... so it was a very awkward service from the start.When he brought out my veggie burger with a salad after our apps were done (corn griddle cake pretty good, polenta fries needed salt but were a cool idea, nothing to write home about...) he didn't bring silverware with which to eat the salad. When I flagged him down after I realized he wasn't coming back with any, I asked for some. He seemed confused but understanding, went away, then came back with salt and pepper. .... Odd.Fiancee's burger was to be medium rare - it came back hard as a brick. It was quite well done. Overly. By the end of our promising meal, all of the above combined left us feeling disappointed and confused as to why the service and scene was so sub par. Those two things could have elevated the mediocre food with the kind of cute menu, but as those elements were lacking, it just made the food even less inviting. With a bottle of cheap cava, starters and cheap burger entrees, the bill was a little over a buck. Not bad... but there are way better places you can eat for your $ in this neighborhood. Keep working at it, Baron's. You could be awesome. Right now you're still very confusing.",2.0
Pretty great food and service :)Came for our friends birthday and started off with the oyster and drink happy hour. Oysters were pretty great and were fresh.For the main I got a beef burger-medium rare- the meat was cooked perfectly and the amount of food you get for only $12 was perfect. Their fries were fluffy and came in a cute little bucket (nice presentation).For dessert we had a cake that we brought in and had their French press (which was only $5 and filled 4 cups). Overall the food was amazzzzing and the way they present their food is very nice.The service was great too because they brought out the cake right as we finished our food and we didn't have to even ask (very thoughtful).  Would definitely come here again for a nice dinner out :),5.0

"I've passed Baron's every time I've made a trip to the beast that is home depot and every time I've passed it I've thought it looked cute and wanted to see what it was about and then I'd forget. Well finally my boyfriend and I were looking for a new restaurant to check out and I stumbled upon it again on the handy dandy yelp app! First things first, I've never loved a places décor as much as I love the décor at this place. Everything about it was perfect and basically can my house look like this, k thanks. Really though it had this warm inviting look that also kind of reminded me of a ship wreck. Apparently they have this happy hour oyster special that we missed, I'll have to try and swing by earlier one day to check that out, it was a dollar per oyster, so clearly that's a must. For food I ended up ordering the Merguez sandwich, it was spicy without being too spicy and the sandwich was just enough food for me which was also nice. My boyfriend had a burger and he thought it tasted great too. Besides that the staff was friendly and it wasn't super over crowded on a Wednesday evening. The only down side was that a lot of the entrees were kind of on the pricey side.",4.0
"Dollar oyster happy hour + drinks! Great space, our super friendly bartender, Sachea, and very very fresh food. I never got to try the previous iteration of Baron's but my impression was a bit stuffy- it's definitely not that. They're starting to do special events soon but I will definitely be back before, especially to try the beef tartare. Can't wait for crab night!! Will definitely return!",5.0
First. I called at 10:10pm on a Monday. They close at 11pm. They were super cool to keep the kitchen open.When my friend and I got there they remembered that we called and although they were about to close they still served us!The GF burger is divine!I had the GF combo with a side of mash potatoes!My glass of Prosecco went perfectly!The waitress was sweet and knowledgable. You couldn't tell it was near closing and we were the only ones in the place!The decor is beautiful! Hipster and vintage with a touch of class!Perfect for a date night!,4.0
"Been to the bar a few times, it has a moody atmosphere, an interesting theme to the cocktails, and some pretty decent drinks. On weekdays the place is pretty quiet, has a quaint friendliness and I think a pretty nice place to get a drink after work. Not sure if this is a 5 star place really but after a few drinks we were having a laugh with the bartender and promised her we'd write a 5 star review so anywho, here we are. Probably would normally give a 4.",5.0
"Baron's has a very relaxing and inviting atmosphere: fire roaring, soft bluesy music with legendary greats like Eartha Kitt playing in the background, fabulous staff and decor. Arrived for the happy hour and the food was stellar. Enjoyed the fresh oysters for $1a piece as well as the fun drink concoctions their mixologist behind the bar was creating. This unassuming joint exceeded my expectations in every way.",5.0

"My wife and I strolled passed this restaurant many times before finally just taking a chance and going in.  One word: phenomenal!!!  Service was great, food was masterful, and the friendly owner is usually there (we've now become semi regulars).  Locally sourced produce, oysters to die for, and great prices made it that much better!  It has now become our favorite restaurant in the hood.",5.0
"I'm giving this place 4 stars because I really want it to succeed. I've been three times since it opened, twice for brunch (which was excellent both times) and once for dinner. At brunch, the biscuits and gravy and the eggs on corn griddle cakes were both delicious. Dinner was a little more disappointing, mostly because of the service. My salmon was pretty severely undercooked, and, though it came out perfectly the second time around, I would have expected to be comped a dessert or offered some sort of apology. And it was only when we overheard the table next to us ordering the specials that we realized that our waiter hadn't told us about them. But the server was sweet, despite his mess-ups, and the ambiance and menu make this place worth visiting.",4.0
"Great place to come with friends to hang out. Food is really good too. Had fresh oysters for the first time, which was different. I had it with hot sauce so it was very easy to go down.

"Came here for the first time last night. Everything superb. Food was fresh and clean. I got the burger and my friend ordered the salmon entree both delicious.

For appetizer we got the polenta fries and the brusell  sprout salad very light as we had enough space for our entree. The place is huge it give me and ild english vibe my friend and i sat close to the electric fire place which was very relaxing. We talked and giggled all night after our bottle if wine was finish we were contemplating on getting another and then here comes the waitress  who gave us a two glasses of wine on the house stating ""you guys are having so much fun"".  We literally shut the place down we had so much fun. Awesome that rarely happens in the dog eat city of NYC. Which made me give them 5/5 review. Hope this place stays open and the continue good business practices looking forward to coming back.",5.0
"Barons is a jewel waiting to be discovered. The decor is stunning, with reclaimed materials, a beautiful color palette, and soft golden lighting. Benny the bartender caters to your spirit through alcoholic alchemy and an understanding soul. I let Benny surprise me with my cocktail. I told him nothing too sweet and he made me an oyster martini with Brooklyn Gin which was out of this world. The taste of juniper made it super fragrant and the oyster was, well, fabulous. This bar is new and still a neighborhood secret. Go there now, before this spot blows up!!!!",5.0
"I came to Baron's with my family for New Year's Eve dinner this year, and we had a fantastic time! The quality of their food is excellent, the drinks menu is tasteful, and the atmosphere made for a very relaxing dinner - on an evening that's usually far from relaxing when you live in New York. The prix fixe menu was much more reasonably priced than most other restaurants I had considered for New Year's Eve, and all four of us were very happy with our meals. I had the crab cake to start and the duck cassoulet for my main course. I eat a lot of French food and I love duck, but will sometimes avoid ordering a cassoulet because they can be on the salty side for my taste. I can say with total certainty that this was the least salty and most flavorful cassoulet I've had in at least a year, and I was so glad that I decided to order it. The apple tart with rose ice cream that I had for dessert was well portioned and very refreshing. The drinks menu is not extensive but very well rounded, with a selection of cocktails and a nice variety of wine and beer. The atmosphere is very relaxed and casual, the decor is lovely, and the music was great. I also noted and appreciated that later in the evening, when it was getting busier, the staff noticed the music was a little loud and lowered it right away. We felt very relaxed during our meal and not rushed at all. All in all, as far as New Year's Eve dining experiences go, this was one of the best I've had. I've been a BedStuy resident for 15 years, and I'm very happy to have them in the neighborhood. I will definitely be coming back very soon!",5.0
"Ambiance and decor CANNOT be beat! And great service! The food however....idk who devised this menu but they are trying too hard. My friend ordered the Chicken...it was ""like"" a chicken marsala...they did NOT remove the fat from the chicken. Most of the chicken was inedible, however the plate looked plentiful. I had the salmon(seared skin) was tasty but there was this smear on the plate that acted as the starch. It tasted like sweet potato or pumpkin mash with a lot of paprika (too much, not balanced). The app was their corncakes...tasty but the break down on the palette was chalky. Im no expert but some things I would like to be consistent and balanced. The upside they change their menu every week or so, as per the waitress. FYI they just started doing brunch. I would love to see this place make better food.",3.0

"6 oysters with a drink for $9 is a great deal in NY! I also recommend the brussell sprout salad with pomegranate seeds, almonds, and orange segments. A beautiful balance of flavors that isn't too sweet. The brick pressed chicken has a delicious rich sauce. If you're a fan of chicken marsala then you'll love the sauce. The chocolate mousse is rich and topped with fresh raspberries and mint. A great addition to the neighborhood!",5.0
Can't say enough about Baron's. The first time we went was for diner. the chicken dish and the vegie burger were fantastic! not to mentioned the super fresh oysters!!! Second time we went was for Brunch. our dishes were so delicious we ended up staying for few hours and ordering other dishes. The stuff was extremely  kind and sweet. The ambience was warm and super cool. We are going back!!!,5.0
"Went in around 10pm on a Tuesday with some friends-- the place was empty which I'm sure has to do with it being new (just opened 5 days ago). The bartender/manager, Isaac is lovely and made us feel like he was really happy we were there. He made us some great drinks, I had an Overholt Sazerac that was only $7-- a steal in NYC. I can't wait to go back and see this place flourishing.",5.0
