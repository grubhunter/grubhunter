"I have been to AM Thai with my fiancé numerous times and the food never disappoints! It's a cute, modern restaurant with an intimate vibe. It's a little small so get here early, sometimes even on a weekday.I always alternate between getting the Pad Thai with chicken and the green curry with chicken. Be warned that the curry is super spicy, in my opinion, but you can get it adjusted to your liking. We also recommend starting with the chicken wings. Your tummy will thank us.They also have some drink options... I either get the mojito or colada, depending on my mood. The girls that work here are very nice and attentive. The food here is definitely some of the best Thai food I've ever had.",5.0
"Really great thai food with excellent and attentive service! I've walked by the restaurant plenty of times and always see it is crowded. Finally decided to give it a try for dinner and really enjoyed the food.We ordered two appetizers, fried calamari which came with a delicious dipping sauce, and the Jeep Thai fried dumplings which while tasty would not get again simply because the portion is too small for two people. As main courses I ordered the drunken noodles with shrimp, very delicious and spicy, which I like. However, I will say that if you do not like spicy dishes then perhaps do not order this. My partner ordered the yellow massaman curry and enjoyed it as well. I appreciate the presentation of dishes and that they dust plates with Thai red pepper powder, spicy and good!Their cocktails are also delicious! I see myself coming here on a regular basis.",4.0
"Am Thai Bistro is certainly a Soho-chic restaurant with Brooklyn prices, which is great for diners who want a wonderful meal on a budget.  The place is decorated so nicely with gold accent decor and fresh flowers on every table.  The restaurant is pretty small, but coming in on Sunday afternoon, it wasn't crowded at all.The shrimp pad thai is pretty good - plus it probably has the best plating I've seen at a Thai restaurant in a while.  There was a good amount of shrimp in there.  I believe it was 8.50 + 1.50 if you opt for shrimp.  Plus, I really liked their Thai iced tea's - usually it's pre-mixed, but this one had the tea on the bottom and cream on top, which allowed you to swirl it yourself.Service was also top notch and food came out fast.  Love this place - I can see why people love them on Yelp and why they have so many Zagat ratings!",4.0
"Wow did this place redeemed itself! After a long day and craving Thai food, I gave in and ordered delivery even though my first experience was not that great. Delivery was about 30mins and the food was still hot. Compare to my previous order, everything was flavorful and delicious! My pad see ew was spicy, although I did ask several times to please make it spicy. I also tried the spring rolls, chicken wings and curry puffs this time. Curry puff are a must! One of the best I've tried. Also tried the pad Thai which decent, no peanuts though. Will order again!",4.0
"I have no idea what has happened it's been a couple of months since I ordered here. I got the drunken noodle and they are over cooked and mushy. It was completely bland I'm in shock! I also got the magi and sticky rice. Too sugary, the rice was not sticky and the mango was ripped brown. I cannot eat this these noodles are disgusting! Disappointed!",1.0

"Very disappointing. My wife ordered the Pad Broccoli which taste liked watered down gravy, chicken pad tai and the duck basil sub par I'll end up feeding to the dogs tonight.

"This is definitely good thai delivery - not just good for the neighborhood. And it's one of the rare places where the food is spicy and not sweet. Make sure you can handle it if you ask for extra spicy, they're not messing around.Thai salad with peanut sauce was great - good variety of vegetables and excellent peanut sauce. The green curry is very good, the vegetables in it are cooked well, so that you can really taste each one. The lunch special comes with salad and spring roll, a perfect little meal. Drunken noodles are spicy and delicious, I love them with the crispy tofu. And the Tom Kha is really great. More sour than sweet, and really vibrant. Delivery is fast and easy. Check it out!",4.0
"This is a very cute little Thai restaurant in this area. Gets pack quickly on the weekends even if you go for an early dinner. I had the Thai ice tea ($2.50), samoza triangles ($4), and shrimp pad thai ($10). The Thai ice tea has a strong Thai tea flavor with a good amount of sweetness. A must order at any Thai restaurant. It complements well with the flavorful Thai dishes. The samoza triangles are basically a fried triangular shape appetizer stuffed with veggies, corn, potato, onion and curry powder served with cucumber in vinegar sauce. It was pretty good, even though you don't really taste the curry. The pad thai is a popular thai noodle dish that's stir fried with bean sprout, scallion, crushed peanut, and egg in pad thai sauce. Some Thai restaurants usually add in bean curd, but this place doesn't. Boo... The noodle was soaked in pad thai sauce, so I didn't enjoy it much due to way too much sauce.",3.0
"What a surprise! The food packs a flavor punch! $8 lunch special sends sensational Flavors to your table at this small neighborhoody joint. You start with a fresh fried garden Spring roll & simple iceberg, with carrots and homemade dressing.

Food was fresh and when you ask for spicy you bet your booty that's what they're gonna give you. I would definitely come here again... so... soo... yummy. OH did I mention their drinks are both delicious and beautiful. If you're yelping this place to see if you should go or not. GO!!!,5.0
"Came here on a Saturday night. I was concerned about the wait since I know it is a small place but we were able to be seated right away. The restaurant looks very nice. We ordered the duck roll for an appetizer which was very good. Also drinks, a mango colada and a lichee mojito. I'm always weary about ordering cocktails in Asian restaurants because they aren't usually very good. They either very weak, not blended correctly or they don't use liquor but sake instead. But, to my surprise the drinks were so good! I was shocked. They tasted great, had the right about of liquor, mixed well and presented nicely. Our food was also good. I got the Drunken Noodle. All the food was good and prepared fairly quickly. Everything we ordered came out to about $40. We were happy customers. I'll be back.",5.0
"I came here because one of my friends came here before.  This place is quite small, seats about 25, and is just off Ocean Parkway, in a semi-residential neighborhood.  It has a romantic feel in the restaurant with candles at night.  I had:Thai ice tea - it's not too sweet but a little watered down.Vegetable samosa - the skin was very crispy but a little too thick, the filling had a lot of vegetables but I couldn't taste the flavor inside.  Tofu pad thai - this was really good, it had lots of different kinds of vegetables with tofu, the sauce was just right, not too salty and flavorful.Tried my friend's shrimp pad thai - this was very salty, so there is inconsistency between the different pad thai, I think the chef poured a little too much thai sauce.Prices are average, not too expensive.",3.0
"There are a lot of factors that make up the dining experience. This little place in that area of Brooklyn has me pleasantly surprised in exceeding all my expectations of those factors. Customer service? A++++ for them. Everyone here is so nice and smiley. Any questions are answered kindly, no matter how many you have.Food? Amazing. Our waitress recommended us a few dishes, so we ended up ordering curry puffs, crispy duck rolls, laab, and I had a Pad Gra Pow for myself. Curry puffs were huge, fluffy, yet had a satisfying buttery light crisp. It wasn't spicy at all, and it's vegetarian (waitress told me they changed the recipe but haven't updated the menu). Laab was decently spicy according to my friends (we all have a medium to high tolerance for spicy foods). One of them said that the crispy duck was better than the Peking duck at Chinese restaurants...now I know that's saying something!I requested the Pad Gra Pow to be extra spicy and to be made with tofu and veggies. It was barely a medium, but either because the vegetables let out a lot of water in the cooking process....or because the chef didn't think I could handle the hotness (ha!). Regardless, it was very yummy and I would probably order it again, even if it wasn't spicy. The light basil broth-like sauce lent so much flavor to the dish.We were all stuffed after eating our entrees because the portions are pretty decent, as  they are in most Thai restaurants. My first experience here has been a great one, and I hope this will be consistent every time I go hereon after. I will update this review if it isn't consistent (sadface) or if I try something new on the menu that's epic-ly amazing.",5.0

Overall not a bad dish, but the markup was a little high for 1 avocado and 6 shrimp. ($15)Pad Thai - I was really looking forward to pad Thai since I have not had it in a while and the best I have had was when I was in Thailand ;). Sadly, the pad Thai with veggies was extremely sour, maybe a little too much lime? ($8.50)Herbal chicken - Sadly, the chicken itself was quite dry. The rice was a little hard and the veggies were not fully cooked.Tom Kha - A little too much fish sauce for me and not enough herbal goodness. Seemed very watery.Overall, sadly will not be returning.",2.0

"Am Thai, what is going on?The past few times I've ordered, things have been hit or miss. Take for instance the crab fried rice...with NO CRAB!!!! I called the restaurant to let them know that for sure, there was nothing but rice in the container, but they were having none of it. I almost always get the Thai salad, but recently it is made up of lettuce butts, the inedible parts of lettuce. What?? I ordered takeout not that long ago and the pad thai was not even edible. I'm not sure what's going on. I called and they did credit me, but when I went in to pick up my new order, the owner was kind of rude.

The food here is really good! The pineapple fried rich and chicken pad thai are so good. Also try there homemade lemonade. If your looking for legit thai food check this place out.

"Many restaurants in Brooklyn are trying too hard to be like upscale restaurants in Manhattan, particularly with ambiance and prices. They forget the primary mission: Good Food! Am Thai Bistro is one of those. While it has potential, right now it is mediocre at best and needs some serious staff retraining on sanitation. Although, you would never know it by the crowd. It is usually packed. The good: ambience, friendly, attentive service (with a caveat, read below), portions. The bad: taste, prices, sanitation.

"More of a 2.5 stars. Just had lunch there today. The staff was extremely friendly and nice. Very cute space and dining room. However, the food was not as good as I had hoped. We ordered the following:Shrimp and avocado curry - comes with a bowl of rice. It was mildly spicy. Avocados and shrimp were fresh. Overall not a bad dish, but the markup was a little high for 1 avocado and 6 shrimp. ($15)Pad Thai - I was really looking forward to pad Thai since I have not had it in a while and the best I have had was when I was in Thailand ;). Sadly, the pad Thai with veggies was extremely sour, maybe a little too much lime? ($8.50)Herbal chicken - Sadly, the chicken itself was quite dry. The rice was a little hard and the veggies were not fully cooked.Tom Kha - A little too much fish sauce for me and not enough herbal goodness. Seemed very watery.Overall, sadly will not be returning.",2.0

"I realized a few months after moving into my food desert of a neighborhood that I would have to either schlep to the foods I craved or order them in.

The staff became a little aggressive at removing plates of food that were still being worked on (my chopstick was dipping into the bowl as the server attempted to lift it). Super apologetic, of course; however I can see how some people have complained about the state of affairs around the dinner rush. We got the ""hint"" and asked for the check.

Their chefs sure know what they are doing.  It's a cute little place for a good solo meal or a Tinder date. They have great music in the background. They also have Thai beer and a selection of good won't to pair with their dishes. The service is very personable. They were always checking on us. What are you waiting for!?! Come now!",5.0
Hidden gem! I absolutely love this place and get say enough about it. The food is amazing. The coconut rice is the best I have ever had! They are a little pricey but totally worth it.,5.0
Really good food and great service. The waiter recommended the house special and it was the best.,5.0
If I'm in the mood for Thai this is the place I go to.  The snapper with the basil sauce is fantastic. The shrimp egg rolls is a large shrimp wrapped in a thin wonton like skin. The wonton soup is enough for two people.  The wontons are light and tasty.  The staff is friendly and warm. I had forgotten my credit card at the restaurant during a previous and they had saved it for me.  I have never been disappointed since I've been eating here. Five stars.,5.0
I always order take out from this place.  Very friendly customer service. Definitely try the drunken noodle with chicken. Delicious!,4.0
We had take out from this spot the other night. Really delicious especially the faux duck!,4.0
The best Thai basil I have ever had! Sweet staff and quick without skimping on the quality of the food.The staff is friendly and easy going.The ambience is very trendy without the intimidation. I love the welcoming feeling every guest is greeted  with.,5.0
I had the yellow curry for lunch today.The food is very nice and correctly priced.Staff is friendly and efficient.Definitely will go there again sometime.,4.0
"Good service.  Got Chicken pad Thai-  dry, lackluster rubbery chicken.   Also got the crab fried rice.  What crab? Found a hair in my rice also.  Fellow yelpers, please stay focused.  Don't give up the stars too easily.    I'm happy for those of you that had a good experience there.  But I have to keep it real.  I'll never go back.",2.0
"Slighty reticent to try this place but I was so glad we went hereFist of all, their small but trendy decor was a big contrast to the bustling Church ave. The staff was really attentive. We started out with their strawberry mojito, midly strong and refreshing.  Really liked that they had a cocktail menu btw.As for food, we enjoyed everything we ate. Fried calamari were nice and crispy. I recommend to try their signature menu dishes. I had mango steak salmon, which came in a beautiful presentation. Also tasted the avocado shrimp, equally good. Would certainly come back for the atmosphere and food.",4.0
"Blows SONG out of the water, fresher, less oily, portions and prices on par with song but a lot better and closer to us in south slope. Highly recommend!!",5.0
"I've been getting food for years from AM Thai, since they were on MacDonald Ave. The food was always fantastic. I can't recommend them highly enough. Why did I take off one star? They have become cheap as hell with rice. Dishes now come with a tiny container of rice, barely enough for one person. It's forces you to pay for an extra rice, where they'll leave out the included rice. Unacceptable.",4.0
"Not impressed at all. Was looking forward to this, but was disappointed. Mango sticky rice was not ripe mango and was microwaved, so different bites had different temperatures. My dish was way too spicy for me and I asked for it mild. The server was clear he would order it mild and when it wasn't he refused to take it off the bill, even as I was going to order something else. Then he took it to the back to ""fix"" it which was interesting because how do you ""fix"" salmon smothered in green curry sauce to be not spicy? (Wash it? Lol). It felt like this place was all trying to be modern and chic, but quality of food was sorely lacking. My husbands dish was meh and our soup starter too. Oh well. I'd get pizza in Brooklyn instead of thai in the future.",2.0

I used to eat here all the time I'm not sure if they have a change in management but the food is not the same. The staff is very serious and you feel a little rush. The place is very small so the staff stand by the register and steer at you if they feel you are taking too long. My food came and it was the wrong order and the manager got upset with me because I said something.  You can definitely get better Thai food. But I must say the Thai iced tea is delicious.,2.0
"Not sure what took me so long to try this, but a good addition to Prospect Park South. Relatively inexpensive, tasty Thai food. I ordered online-- through their site, not GrubHub or something of the like and on a Monday at 9pm, it took less than 30 minutes to arrive. Fan. Tas. Tic.I ordered the Pad Thai with Chicken (plentiful portion, surprisingly tangy, decent amount of chicken, low quantity of sprouts, no peanuts) and the Chicken Dumplings in Peanut Sauce (really delicious, light, peanuty, but seemingly unnecessary amount of lettuce in the container-- would have liked the dumplings with a container of sauce).$10 minimum to order and I believe if you want to use a cc you have to call in the order. Both of these are non-issues in my book.All around a good experience and will certainly order Am Thai Bistro again.",4.0
Amazing food and service. Must try the volcanic chicken it's amazing!! And ofcourse the Thai tea is EVERYTHING,5.0
Went there for my bday.. Good is amazing! I honestly ate too much! The portions are huge! The fry calamari was amazing.. Will def be going back soon.,4.0
"I was really excited about this place. I had kept passing this place and the exterior pops off of the block in a good way. It looked really clean and fresh inside as well. I ordered delivery from here on a day when I just didn't feel like going out in the rain. When I called to place my order, it was so loud in the restaurant that I had to scream my answer into the phone. After an hour had passed, I started to wonder where my food was. Thai food does NOT take an hour to cook and the place is maybe five - six blocks away from me. When I called to check in, the hostess was confused that I still hadn't received it. Well...so was I. There was a lot of shouting to others before she told me it was on its way. When it arrived, it was packaged well. The good wasn't hot, it was lukewarm, but at least it had arrived. I ordered the Spring Rolls and the Super Hot Tom Yum Fried Rice. Don't get the spring rolls, way to much of the wrapper and not enough filling. The fried rice was just okay, chicken was good, but the vegetables in it were humongous and there was this spice in the rice that made everything grainy.All in all, pretty average. Would only go here again in person, not delivery, and if I didn't want any of my other options.",2.0
"The food, beverages, and service are amazing. The food is super fresh and the portions are large. You will definitely bring some home or not eat the rest of the day if you finish your meal. The mojitos are yummy and strong. The servers are kind and attentive. My brother in law knows the owner. She's super sweet and always make sure we enjoy ourselves. This treatment is shown to all customers. You must try AM Thai! You will not regret it. I promise you!",5.0
"So glad my boyfriend and I discovered this place. Their tom kha soup is the perfect blend of coconut and lemon and so perfect when you just need some warm comfort food.

"This place has maybe 10 small tables. I went on a Friday night around 10pm with some tables open that quickly filled up. -Thai iced tea was good and refreshing-fried jeep Thai dumplings, chicken or shrimp option.. Couldn't tell which filling was inside based on flavor (we chose shrimp). Sooo that's questionable.  $4 for 5. Not worth it.-drunken noodles: much sweeter than others with few noodles, not spicy at all-basil fried rice: a good alternate to the drunken noodles and we preferred it. Would order again. Overall, food was okay, I would give it another try if I lived closer. Not worth our 20+ minute drive. At least there is plenty of parking. Staff was also attentive. The downside is that their wood tables and wood benches are so sticky!!!i don't think we can blame humidity as it was an extremely cool night.  It's almost a lesson to not put your elbows on the table.",3.0

In any case, I ordered a holy basil fried rice (which how could you screw that up?) and drunken noodles or more appropriately: pad ki mao. The latter being way too drunken in some greazy gravy deal.

The waitress was very friendly and kind of funny and the experience overall was very good.For an appetizer we got the Labb which I've never had before but thought it was very good. It tasted very heavily of fish sauce and lime and I was taken aback on my first bite but then my palate adjusted and I really enjoyed it. For my main I got Yummy GraPow Moo which was also very good. It was a little bit sweet but also very spicy, it was heavy on the holy basil which I love. I would definitely order both dishes again.  My friend went with the chicken pad thai which she really seemed to enjoy.

I figured if I went with the jumbo I could probably hold myself to one for the night, I didn't know the jumbo is a carafe. I forced myself to finish it but it really should be split between two and at $5 it's a great deal.  Since AM Thai is about 3 block away I'm sure I'll be back.

"I'm happy to have found a local Thai joint that I love which I can visit regularly. Everything about this place is great: the food, the service, the prices, even the delivery. The prices are cheaper than your average Thai restaurant. Both the pad thai and the pad see ew are my favorite dishes here. They are very saucy and I LOVE LOVE LOVE that they pile on the veggies and meat in the noodle dishes. I hate it when you order a pad thai and you get 90 percent noodle and 10 percent other toppings (eggs, meat, veggies). After all, the noodles are the cheapest part of the dish. I also like that you can customize the spiciness of some of the dishes. I also like that they have lots of vegetarian options as well. Delivery is also a breeze, as they will give you an estimate of how long it will take for your food to arrive, and it is very precise.",5.0
Today is the first time I ordered take out from this location.  I use to order from them much more frequently when they were a take out only at the old location.  Some of the must get items include Basil fried rice and curry puffs.  I think they must of changed chefs.  The food use to taste a lot better.  The curry puffs were fabulous prior to the move.  I believe the Thai Lady use to make the puffs. The curry puffs from my order tonight tasted not to great.  There was too much pepper and the flavor of the entire puff was just not pleasant.  Felt like finishing your appetizer was like a chore.  I tasted the basil fried rice.  Definitely a different cook. Just didn't taste good.  The ingredients were fresh.  Noodle dishes were mediocre.,2.0
"Went here last night with a friend to grab a quick dinner. The decor inside is very nice and the place is clean, especially the restroom. It's really tiny inside so I probably won't come back to stay and eat, but I would order food from here. The service was so fast (received food in 10 minutes) and it was delicious. I had the chicken pad see yew. I would recommend that dish. My friend had the drunken noodles which was good as well. The price is also very reasonable, both of our meals were under $10.",4.0
"3 stars for the rich complex flavors in all their dishes and their kind delivery and in-restaurant staff. I have ordered from here well over 50 times during my 3 years in the neighborhood and what I've come to expect is subpar chicken (can't speak for the other meats) but it is always just a tad too chewy (maybe from being frozen?) and a terrible time on the phone. I don't mind the long waits so much as being on hold long enough to be hung up on. Multiple times. Yet still..I order. The medley of spices, large portions and reasonable prices bring me back. The Green Curry is especially lovely. As for gluten- they prepare the dishes traditionally (meaning most dishes do not have gluteny soy-sauce) but if you're über sensitive like me, make sure to mention it otherwise soy sauce from the pan may  sneak in...It's been very hit or miss over the years with the gluten reaction...all that skwaking and I'll undoubtedly order again soon...",3.0
Yum! I came in on Sunday night for dinner and got chicken drunken noodles (sans tomato and egg.) The waitress didn't make a big deal about me being finicky and the food came pretty quickly. It was really tasty and pretty cheap! I'd come back :),4.0
"I first met ""Mom"" (owner) when she opened up a tiny kitchen on McDonald Avenue called Am-Thai Chili Basil. I never had Thai food prior and were recommended to try drunken man noodle with chicken and curry puffs. It definitely ranked one of the top tasting foods I have tried in my then 17 years of existence!

"If the name sounds familiar, it is.  There's an Am-Thai Chili Basil restaurant not too far away on McDonald Ave., from the same owners.  That one is frumpy, tiny, well-worn and only a few seats are available, if lucky.  I've always liked the food, but more for takeout.  And I've loved the people, friendly and kind.Am Thai Bistro is the second generation, and like the American Dream or Cinderella story, this daughter has gone from ugly duckling to swan (but they still serve duck!).  I happened upon it by accident, walking down Church.  As it was their opening day, the sidewalk was filled with beautiful flowers - gifts from Thai well wishers - and it brightened an otherwise bleak block of nothing else.  Upon entering, it certainly wasn't frumpy.  They gutted the previous space and here is now a sleek, modern eatery.  Polished concrete walls + matching floor tiles, contrasted by stark black tables, sparkling ""bling"" lights and shades of red/pink hues - but not overwhelming.  Seating wise, there are four 4-tops and and about 10 2-tops that can be merged in different combinations, though in any pattern it's still pretty cozy.  There's also some cool, yet subtle artistic nods, from the metal sculpture of Thailand to a trio of Buddhist offerings on display.Other than decor, they've kicked up the food experience as well.  Gone are the plastic take-out plates (unless you are ordering take out).  If you eat in, you get giant bowls.  Big, porcelain dishware you could wear if raining.  It's kinda strange because it makes the tables - and portions - seem smaller, but it also makes the experience seem grander and once you start eating, the portions are obviously generous.  I also noticed some beautiful looking food walking by, showcasing some of the artistic aspects of classic ""Royal"" Thai cuisine, something that is rarely seen outside of Bangkok. In terms of taste, my big bowl of chicken drunken noodles + drink was $9.  And tasty.  Generous in meat, noodles, veggies and flavoring.  I'd try to expound on the larger selection, but there are about 60 items listed. As for now, the menu is almost exactly the same as the other joint: extensive and relatively inexpensive.   They told me in time, however, they will expand the Bistro's menu to be more bistro-like, including more traditional Thai recipes, expanded seafood offerings, etc.  + wine and beer.  As such, it's probably too soon to rate how this place compares with other Thai places in town.  But in an area where most eateries don't even bother with makeup, Am Thai Bistro boldly says, ""check me out.""  Cinderella has grown up and is wearing heels.",4.0
"I'm happy to have found a local Thai joint that I love which I can visit regularly. Everything about this place is great: the food, the service, the prices, even the delivery. The prices are cheaper than your average Thai restaurant. Both the pad thai and the pad see ew are my favorite dishes here. They are very saucy and I LOVE LOVE LOVE that they pile on the veggies and meat in the noodle dishes. I hate it when you order a pad thai and you get 90 percent noodle and 10 percent other toppings (eggs, meat, veggies). After all, the noodles are the cheapest part of the dish. I also like that you can customize the spiciness of some of the dishes. I also like that they have lots of vegetarian options as well. Delivery is also a breeze, as they will give you an estimate of how long it will take for your food to arrive, and it is very precise.",5.0
Today is the first time I ordered take out from this location.  I use to order from them much more frequently when they were a take out only at the old location.  Some of the must get items include Basil fried rice and curry puffs.  I think they must of changed chefs.  The food use to taste a lot better.  The curry puffs were fabulous prior to the move.  I believe the Thai Lady use to make the puffs. The curry puffs from my order tonight tasted not to great.  There was too much pepper and the flavor of the entire puff was just not pleasant.  Felt like finishing your appetizer was like a chore.  I tasted the basil fried rice.  Definitely a different cook. Just didn't taste good.  The ingredients were fresh.  Noodle dishes were mediocre.,2.0
"Went here last night with a friend to grab a quick dinner. The decor inside is very nice and the place is clean, especially the restroom. It's really tiny inside so I probably won't come back to stay and eat, but I would order food from here. The service was so fast (received food in 10 minutes) and it was delicious. I had the chicken pad see yew. I would recommend that dish. My friend had the drunken noodles which was good as well. The price is also very reasonable, both of our meals were under $10.",4.0
"3 stars for the rich complex flavors in all their dishes and their kind delivery and in-restaurant staff. I have ordered from here well over 50 times during my 3 years in the neighborhood and what I've come to expect is subpar chicken (can't speak for the other meats) but it is always just a tad too chewy (maybe from being frozen?) and a terrible time on the phone. I don't mind the long waits so much as being on hold long enough to be hung up on. Multiple times. Yet still..I order. The medley of spices, large portions and reasonable prices bring me back. The Green Curry is especially lovely. As for gluten- they prepare the dishes traditionally (meaning most dishes do not have gluteny soy-sauce) but if you're über sensitive like me, make sure to mention it otherwise soy sauce from the pan may  sneak in...It's been very hit or miss over the years with the gluten reaction...all that skwaking and I'll undoubtedly order again soon...",3.0

"Am Thai sits in a quiet residential neighborhood. It is easy to miss, but when you enter you are immediately thrust into its minimalist, efficient space centered by a shining crystal chandelier. As you sit and browse the menu, the Thai waiters and waitresses squeeze by bringing dishes large and small to wooden tables occupied by friendly neighborhood folks.The menu is reasonably priced and offers a large selection of Thai favorites. I ordered a Winter roll, which is duck, vegetables and plum sauce in a roti wrap; a green curry with beef; and a 'pinky milky' Thai iced tea.The duck roll was solid, cooked well, flavorful, and the portion size was generous. The one napkin provided did not suffice to clean all the plum sauce off my fingers. As my friend had dined in this restaurant before, he spoke of large portions brimming with meat. I was sadly disappointed in that regard.The beef was flavorless, grey, and looked like it may have been undercover pork. The green curry was disrupted by two large piece of eggplant chunks floating amidst the tiny pieces of meat as if they were the main and the meat was the garnish. The rice came in a tiny uncomfortably sized dish. The pinky milky tea I had ordered to counter any disturbances the curry may cause. As it was, I expected a milk flavored iced tea and received what I fully believe was a glass of pepto bismol with ice, at least the taste was identical. Maybe they knew what was best for me more than I did. No heartburn after the meal. Three stars for the food, they tried hard, but according to knowledgeable sources the taste and size of portions have gone downhill. I can believe that.",3.0

I had to throw most of it out.. and for some reason their was a huge hint of sourness to the dish.

That said, the pad see yew is pretty good (one time it was amazing, another time it was so-so), the mock duck is delicious, and the garden basil vegetables were really flavorful.

Babygirl was next door at LARK Cafe for a drop off birthday party so hubby and I took the opportunity to have an impromptu lunch date. We were attracted by the chic decor and surprised by how affordable the dishes were. Food arrived faster than I would expect in a sit down restaurant. The Autumn Shrimp Roll was yummy.  The Drunken Noodle was delicious. The Green Curry was too watery for me but hubby liked it. The Laab Salad was okay. Wish there were more basil in it. The Thai Ice Tea was refreshing and my kids like it. Hubby is really happy they served the Thai beer. Will definitely come back and try their Signature menu next time.,4.0

So great to know this place is in the area and I'm sure they deliver to me. I guess I missed out on this place because I always order from Seamless and they're not on Seamless. I'll be back!!",4.0

"Am Thai sits in a quiet residential neighborhood. It is easy to miss, but when you enter you are immediately thrust into its minimalist, efficient space centered by a shining crystal chandelier. As you sit and browse the menu, the Thai waiters and waitresses squeeze by bringing dishes large and small to wooden tables occupied by friendly neighborhood folks.The menu is reasonably priced and offers a large selection of Thai favorites. I ordered a Winter roll, which is duck, vegetables and plum sauce in a roti wrap; a green curry with beef; and a 'pinky milky' Thai iced tea.The duck roll was solid, cooked well, flavorful, and the portion size was generous. The one napkin provided did not suffice to clean all the plum sauce off my fingers. As my friend had dined in this restaurant before, he spoke of large portions brimming with meat. I was sadly disappointed in that regard.The beef was flavorless, grey, and looked like it may have been undercover pork. The green curry was disrupted by two large piece of eggplant chunks floating amidst the tiny pieces of meat as if they were the main and the meat was the garnish. The rice came in a tiny uncomfortably sized dish. The pinky milky tea I had ordered to counter any disturbances the curry may cause. As it was, I expected a milk flavored iced tea and received what I fully believe was a glass of pepto bismol with ice, at least the taste was identical. Maybe they knew what was best for me more than I did. No heartburn after the meal. Three stars for the food, they tried hard, but according to knowledgeable sources the taste and size of portions have gone downhill. I can believe that.",3.0
"Excellent food!  Very cozy and intimate place-Each and every time I go- the food is always-always fresh and delicious. I never had a complaint. I loved the Drunken Noodles (spicy), pad thai with chicken, Holy Basil Fried Rice with shrimp (spicy)-in a good way!  and the  Delightful Crab Meat Fried Rice with chicken. The drinks were just as good! My kids loved it- I loved it. I would add pictures-but everyone else already did:) I am going back!",4.0

"I have only ordered from AM Thai and quite a fevv times.. and it has been getting worse each time I've ordered. My beloved drunken noodles, hasn't tasted the same in a very long time. In fact I ordered tofu drunken noodles today, and it was HORRIBLE..burnt tofu, extra soft noodles, no flavor and large pieces of vegetables.. I had to throw most of it out.. and for some reason their was a huge hint of sourness to the dish. I also had quite a few out errors as well, wrong things in the bag..ordering shrimp holy basil fried rice and got no shrimp in the rice.. I doubt I will order from here anymore, the food is just not that good anymore.",3.0
"I've ordered here a few times and the food is pretty tasty and the staff are very friendly. That said, there has been a few times when our orders were wrong--missing rice, no tofu in the vegetable dish (even though we explicitly asked for it). These aren't huge issues, but if they keep occurring we may stop ordering from there. That said, the pad see yew is pretty good (one time it was amazing, another time it was so-so), the mock duck is delicious, and the garden basil vegetables were really flavorful. The portions are a bit small though, so for two people we will order three entrees if we are really hungry.",4.0
Babygirl was next door at LARK Cafe for a drop off birthday party so hubby and I took the opportunity to have an impromptu lunch date. We were attracted by the chic decor and surprised by how affordable the dishes were. Food arrived faster than I would expect in a sit down restaurant. The Autumn Shrimp Roll was yummy.  The Drunken Noodle was delicious. The Green Curry was too watery for me but hubby liked it. The Laab Salad was okay. Wish there were more basil in it. The Thai Ice Tea was refreshing and my kids like it. Hubby is really happy they served the Thai beer. Will definitely come back and try their Signature menu next time.,4.0

"Pretty generic thai food. Yes, the lunch special is $7 but the portions are pretty meager and the wonton/salad appetizer is downright nasty.

I used their online ordering service and somehow they still got the order wrong (I wanted one fresh roll and one spring roll, but both came fried). All of us were equally unhappy with our food. My pad see ew was so oily that I could tip it over to drain it and have oil pouring out. I couldn't even finish it. The pad Thai was extremely dry and tasteless and the green curry was pretty tasteless as well. I'm pretty disappointed that this is the only Thai place in the area and that it really wasn't very nice.",2.0
"Is this place as good as Thai places like Sripraphai or Ayada in Queens? No. It IS good though. Not as many interesting or inventive things you may find in other Thai places, but some key staples are good and reliable. The larb with lime, chili, onions and cilantro was really solid- tangy, salted enough, complex and makes you drool because it is the perfect appetizer. Their salmon green curry was a special made with fresh coconut and with pieces of tender young coconut... Really amazing. It is reliable and I'm happy we tried this place. Very excited that it is close to where I live because we usually drive out to queens. We still will of course, but when I need a quick fix, I will go back here.",4.0
"For take out as well as for dine in you'll get big portions of delicious Thai food.

"I came to Am Thai today for the first time, based on recommendations from all my friends. I had very high hopes for this place, and Am Thai certainly did not disappoint. For appetizer I had the Jeep dumplings. They were nothing special...just typical dumplings. For appetizer I ordered the drunken noodle with shrimp. However they messed up my order and brought me drunken noodle with chicken (I didn't notice they had messed up my order until long after I left the restaurant LOL). For drink I had the Thai iced tea and it was delicious!Aside from the kink of messing up my order and also putting a charge of $7.00 for white wine on my bill when I did not order any wine, it was pretty decent food. The waitresses were friendly, but not really attentive. They never checked up on us until it was the end of lunch and they wanted us to pay because lunch was ending. Overall it's a 4 star place. I won't deduct a star for the mistakes, though part of me thinks the wine thing was them trying to pull a fast one. I would return again.",4.0

Service is absolutely amaze balls. The waitress was extremely sweet and tending to all of our needs. I had pineapple fried rice with shrimp and my friend had the pad thai with crispy duck, I believe. His food was good. I liked my food but I realized it was the canned chunk pineapples and I kinda strayed away from them. I hate canned pineapples. I thought someone on Yelp said that it was good so I ordered. No baby shrimp so I'm always grateful when I see decent sized shrimp. The heat was pumping on that rainy day, couldn't complain about that. I also ordered a lychee mojito which was good but didn't really taste like it contained alcohol. I do want to complain about my missing piece of lychee lol.  Everyone else had two pieces of fruit and I had one. My date tried to take my one piece of fruit.

Came here spur of the moment with my friends for lunch. The calamari was nice and crispy but not with too much batter like other places tend to do.

"Pretty good food and service, especially at the restaurant. the in-restaurant experience is 4 stars. great. nice atmosphere, delicious food.Delivery is a different story, if i were rating it separately it would be 1 or 2 stars: *3 different times* they've simply left out the tofu of the veggie tofu dish I always order. It's a mostly veggie dish with some tofu as protein, so I can see how they *might* accidentally leave out the protein, but 3 times out of maybe 10 orders? Weird. The first time it happened, I called and they were awesome and brought me a new dish (with tofu in it ..). The second time, I called and the woman on the phone talked to the cook came back and told me 'He said they did put the tofu in it'. Wow, now they've accused me of lying.. I had to argue w/ her to get them to bring me the tofu. The third time, which just happened, I didn't even bother. I guess I'll just crack open a can of beans for protein.am thai: *please* get someone double-checking orders going out for delivery! oh one other tiny thing: they don't include chopsticks unless you specifically ask for them. And sometimes they forget to include them even when you *do* ask for them. Not a huge deal but strikes me as a little weird for a thai place.",3.0

"The food here is great. I've been here twice and I've only ever had the Drunken Noodles, so maybe I should try something else on the menu, but I considered myself ""adventurous"" because I didn't stick to my usual Pad Thai. The dinner portion came with a GIGANTIC tomato, which was awesome. Also did I mention the SEVEN DOLLAR LUNCH special?? Somewhat misleading because they put ""dumplingS and side salad"" on the menu when really you get what is maybe a handful of lettuce and one dumpling (or veggie spring roll if you so choose), but come on, $7 for lunch. I won't complain. Service was pretty good, there was only one other table when I was in there for lunch so my meal didn't take too long. It did take me a full 20 minutes to notice that the servers were all wearing the same outfit (denim vest, white shirt, black pants).",4.0

"super delicious, and i've eaten here numerous times, in person and delivery BUT i was there last week and they served me pieces of chicken in my mock duckas a 12 year vegetarian, it was totally disgusting and unnervingthey very quietly apologized and offered me microwaved sticky rice with unripe mangoes for their screw-up -i still had to pay for the dishi will not be back my friends all felt ill the next day",1.0
"I've eaten hear twice. Once when it first open and the food and service was good. Then the second time I ordered food to be delivered and was pretty disappointed. It took a while to come and the pad Thai was very dry, and appetizer pretty much went in the trash. It's a hit or miss",3.0
"I love this place. I've been here two times and curious as to why I didn't review it before. I believe I had a crispy duck roll and a salmon mango dish. I'm not too big on warm fruit unless it's in a pie and I hate savory fruit but it was absolutely delightful. The crispy duck rolls were my favorite. Fast forward to my experience last week. Service is absolutely amaze balls. The waitress was extremely sweet and tending to all of our needs. I had pineapple fried rice with shrimp and my friend had the pad thai with crispy duck, I believe. His food was good. I liked my food but I realized it was the canned chunk pineapples and I kinda strayed away from them. I hate canned pineapples. I thought someone on Yelp said that it was good so I ordered. No baby shrimp so I'm always grateful when I see decent sized shrimp. The heat was pumping on that rainy day, couldn't complain about that. I also ordered a lychee mojito which was good but didn't really taste like it contained alcohol. I do want to complain about my missing piece of lychee lol.  Everyone else had two pieces of fruit and I had one. My date tried to take my one piece of fruit. I told him that he'd better ask the waitress for the missing piece because I don't play with my lychee! Especially since it's out of season.",5.0

"For my 21st birthday after a day at the gardens I knew if I was picking the place to eat it would be thai all the way! So the trick was to try and find a place that would suit my family and their needy high standards. Well lets be honest I took a total shot in the dark at am thai , my mom called made reservations for ten or how many and the lady was very sweet and said shed set it all up ! So when we got there we got parking right on the street with in a few store fronts of the building which was good because we had my older aunt who after walking around the gardens all day was on her last leg so it was great to nab a close spot. When we got inside it was small which I expected from previous reviews but the decor was nice and it was clean, very clean. Almost too clean because it smelt like bleach when we all sat down and we all had unwary  looks on our  but once the waitress warmed us up and got some drinks flowing our way the bleach smell was forgotten and we were on to ordering appetizers. We ordered calamari , soups , spring rolls , and spicy chicken wings. These all went like hot cakes , the one thing my family was impressed about was the freshness. Especially my two aunts and nana , who usually go for Chinese which if you like thai you know Chinese tastes like chemicals and will basically put you in a MSG coma for the rest of the night. So needless to say they were sold on the nice thai fresh ingredients and the made to order speed. Every one had different dishes and the pad thai , spicy basil rice and fried rice were the meals favorites . Every thing was very good and my uncle even walked in mid meal late to our table and they accommodated him and had his meal almost on par time wise with ours! For dessert the sweet waitress / hostess even provided my family with a cake since they didn't have time to bring one . It was a cute chocolate cake , and we even shared a few pieces with a couple cute kids from another table! And the bill was the best part ! Everything was extremely reasonable !

"much better this time, but still there were (some very annoying) issues that were sort of similar to last time..(again, i really, REALLY wanna like this place..)we ordered:summer rollsgolden tofushrimp pad thaidrunken noodles (w/ chicken)here's the good, the bad, and the ugly:boo! to only FOUR!!!?! shrimp in my ""shrimp"" pad thai    : (boo! to NO LIMES!!! with the ""only 4 shrimp"" pad thai!    : (boo!!!  to NO PEANUTS!!!!! on my ""ONLY FOUR SHRIMP!!!"" pad thai  : (boo! to not enough sauce with the ""only 4 shrimp"" pad thai..speaking of not enough sauce..the summer rolls were EXCELLENT!  very fresh and tasty, and all was well EXCEPT for the tiny container of sauce which was maybe only a quarter full?!!?!?  (1/3 full if i'm being generous..  which i am).  but that's still 2/3 empty..   : (the drunken noodles was a dish of mostly green and red peppers, tomato, and hardly any chicken and practically NO noodles, drunk or otherwise!!!  boooooo!!!     : (that said, i really liked the flavor of the drunken ""noodles"" - i just wish there were actually noodles (and other stuff besides peppers and tomato!) up in there!the golden tofu was a bit more crispy this time (still not crispy enough for my taste / experience w/ tofu tod).  a nice improvement this time was that the pieces were served on a bed of shredded cabbage which was a good, crunchy, complimentary accompaniment to the tofu (as opposed to the horrible soggy lettuce (which probably added to the overwhelming sogginess of the ""crispy"" tofu last time..)  and this sauce container was FULL.  (alas - no peanuts in the sauce this time around either..  grrr!!!)NO menu despite request, and NO napkins OR chopsticks..  wtf??!?to end on a high, happy, ""1/3-full-container-instead-of-2/3-empty-container"" note..  SUPER FAST delivery!!!  (YAY!!!  : )  they said 35 minutes, and they were here in under half an hour!so.. that's sumethin'.  right?  RIGHT??!?sigh.i really, really, REALLY wanna like this place..",3.0
"Amazing Thai food, especially for vegetarians. As a vegetarian it's always a toss up as to whether the place will oblige and make dishes without fish sauce. AM Thai is always easily agrees to make dishes vegetarian! Also the moc-duck salad is amazing. It's so tangy and sweet, with crispy pieces of 'duck' definitely highly recommend.",5.0

"I really want to Luv this place,I truly do. U see I have been ordering w/Am Thai on McDonald ave for years,and was very happy for them when they finally open this spot on Church, and I must say they are a hit or miss. I honestly can't believe they send food out like that???  To start, last 2x I ordered and it went like this: delivery,payment, tasted food,dumpster. Wasted $$ w/Am Thai. Ordered a Party fried rice and it was a soggy smelly mess. I went from starving to disgusted. A 2nd x I  ordered the Pad see ew and it was by far the most disgusting poor excuse of a meal I ever had to the point of throw up. It tasted and smelled as if pork, seafood & eggs were cooked in the pot and barely rinsed be 4 making/cooking the Pad see ew .YUCK. Hope that's a good enough description of what it smelled & tasted like. I tried to tell them but they played dumb.",1.0
"This place is a true gem! My boyfriend just moved to the area and we love Thai food. So, when we saw that there was a Thai place just a few blocks from his apartment, we were eager to try it. We've now been there twice and it's been amazing both times. I've eaten a ton of Thai food and this place is legit. So far, we've tried the calamari, autumn rolls, dumplings, pad thai, drunken noodles, and pad see ew. All were amazing--hearty portions and great flavors. Their cocktails are very reasonably priced and tasty as well. The staff is excellent--they're just so nice. We felt welcome as soon as we walked in the door, and the staff remained attentive and friendly throughout our meal. This place is great--it will definitely become a regular haunt for us!",5.0

"And suddenly, I have a sleek and modern new Thai restaurant in my neighborhood -- and the food is great and the staff is really nice!  I've been here three times so far (twice for take-out and once to eat-in) and been happy with everything all three times.  Thank YOU, Am Thai! (November 2013 update: Am Thai can be hit or miss.  It's definitely not as good delivered, and the service can be rather aloof.)",4.0
"I need to add that when I returned the inedible order the Chef offered to make it again right then and she said that someone who didn't know how to make that dish had prepared it but unfortunately I still can't shake my first and what will be my last experience with their delivery food. The mock duck was salty but tasteless. Spring rolls freezer-burned, soggy, salty, greasy, undercooked and puddled in dipping sauce from a jar it seemed. The dumplings were the same. The noodle dish had harsh UN-blended flavors, and only one flavor note -grease. The chicken was sparse and so were the vegetables. The coconut rice was stale, overcooked, gummy and not nice.

"I tried this place last night after reading about it on a local blog.  First, it is cute ... a cool aesthetic and interesting lighting.  Definitely not a typical hole in the wall.  Second, our food was very tasty.  We had a really nice mango and avocado salad, summer rolls, duck with basil sauce and red snapper with curry.  Everything was wonderful.  The summer roll had slightly different ingredients than your typical roll and there were several variations, which I look forward to trying.  The duck with basil sauce was my favorite dish.  The duck was crispy and really flavorful and the dish was exactly the right spice level (and since I said somewhere between mild and medium ... that feels miraculous).  My only critique is that the very reasonably priced whole fish was a bit dry, though the curry accompanying it was flavorful.  I will absolutely be returning.",4.0

i really liked AM Thai. I have only done delivery and I do it fairly often since they opened. I think they are getting really overwhelmed because my orders have been getting messed up. I ordered a curry dish which came without rice and they gave me some iced coffee instead of Thai ice tea. I am pretty disappointed!

"Our interest piqued by nice reviews, two close friends and I made our way to the bottom of Prospect Park to dine at Am Thai. What we found was an cleverly designed bistro with a cute setup of only 8 tables. What Am Thai lacks in space they make up for in food and service. We began with small plates: vegetable dumplings (juicy & flavorful) and fried tofu (just the right crunch). We shared a liter of sangria during the short wait for our meals. They pack the drink with a ton of fresh fruit including lychees and strawberries. Floral, fruity, the perfect summer drink. For dinner we had Pad See Ew (basic but yummy), avocado shrimp in Panang curry (generous and spicy), and the best pork chops we've ever experienced. Grand total: $60. We all quickly conceded that Am Thai is the best Thai food in NYC. Also: The servers were well-styled (Uniqlo jeans & AA polos), always smiling, and exceptionally attentive. Make the trip.",5.0

They have wine, beer, and 1 or 2 cocktails.  Everything I ordered was delicious, I wish their wings were grilled like Thai Tony's, but they are still tasty when you add the sweet chili sauce.  The server was really nice and prompt!

Best Thai food I've had in the five boroughs. For such a small place it is awesome. Gotta try the mock duck in any curry dish if you are a fan of meat substitutes iit is awesome.

"Over fried food. Not fresh, not tasty. Sorry AM but you screwed us two out of three take out orders.",2.0
"Superb food, solid value. Our appetizers (larb, mango salad) were substantial, almost too large for one. The one entree we shared--the special Thai Ocean--was excellent, and a good size too, though the rice accompaniment was petite.They're still working out some kinks--no credit card or liquor license yet. The menus are paper, and they gave us--I swear--cocktail napkins. The tables are close together and the techno music annoying to some. But they're friendly and efficient and a great addition to the neighborhood.",4.0
"After walking around prospect park, I worked up an appetite for some good olde Thai food. I quickly looked up a place near by and sounded the best. I appreciated the low key design and interior design as my friend and I entered. I am a sucker for Pad See Ew and Cha Yen so those were quickly ordered. My friend ordered Tom Yum and Drunken noodles. Our drinks were quickly served and the Cha Yen hit the spot with the perfect amount of milk and black tea. I was less impressed by the Pad See Ew which although light and refreshing with fried tofu, was not with filled with the umami flavor I'm accustomed to. Maybe I'm a little spoiled from recently traveling to Thailand but after experiencing some of the best food of my life, I had to raise the bar. Maybe it was just a bad dish as my friend said the Tom Yum and the Drunken noodles were excellent. Hopefully I shall return one day and get the umami extravaganza I know and love",3.0
"What is wrong with this place?  I've called twice for delivery weeks apart and they have yet to answer the phone.  According to their website, they should be open -- what restaurant wouldn't be on a Friday evening.",1.0
"Very good Thai, and I don't have to go far to get it! Their menu is extensive, sauces delish, nothing greasy - which is so important! Delivery reliable.",4.0
"AM Thai is fantastic. Easily one of the best thai meals I have had in the city. For once it feels like you can get something really healthy and really good at the same time. Sometimes its not quite as good with delivery, and thats the only reason I gave 4 stars.",4.0
"OK...so I went back - this time to eat in person.  We tried going to Thai Tony's at 10PM, but they said they were closing...the only place open was Am Thai and we wanted Thai food pretty bad... so we decided to give it another chance.  I think this restaurant is best for dining-in instead of delivering. They have wine, beer, and 1 or 2 cocktails.  Everything I ordered was delicious, I wish their wings were grilled like Thai Tony's, but they are still tasty when you add the sweet chili sauce.  The server was really nice and prompt! I liked the fact that they have alcohol and accept cards, unlike Thai Tony's...so I think I will begin sticking to this place!",4.0
Best Thai food I've had in the five boroughs. For such a small place it is awesome. Gotta try the mock duck in any curry dish if you are a fan of meat substitutes iit is awesome. Price is pretty good. I judge a Thai place by their Massaman and Thai Ice tea and this place is one of my favorites. Would've gotten 5 stars if they had Nam Prik Pao on the side.,4.0
"Talking about making a first impression!  I just moved into the neighborhood and wanted delivery and Thai, so I took a chance with ""Am Thai Bistro""!  The menu is diverse and description of each food item is precise and simple.  The person over the phone was pleasant.   After I ordered my food I asked how long it would take, and he told me 1/2 hr.  Half an hour later, literally, the delivery guy rang my door bell.  But the most important part was the food!  The food!  I got rice ginger soup w/chicken and an order of squid salad -- both hit the spot, especially the soup since I was feeling under the weather.  I'm definitely calling back to try the rest of their menu!...Wait, I think I got some squid between my teeth - I think I'll save that for later!",4.0

"Excellent, delicious, fresh Thai food - so great to have this in walking distance! We went while I wasn't feeling at my best and I have to rave about the wonton soup - delicious, flavorful, broth (not too salty like such broths can all too often be) - lots of greens, fantastic dumplings -- cured what ailed me.  My pad thai and the mister's seafood/brown rice dish (we both forget which it was) were very, very good. We'll be back often!",4.0
"Totally love this place! Great addition to the neighborhood. Tastes food, not overlooked, hot, fresh, fast delivery, nice on phone, no complaints whatsoever! They should add more new restaurants like this to the neighborhood that aren't as expensive as some of the regular places on Cortelyou, which are good, but not good for regular ordering if you've got a budget. Totally try it! Way better than Chili Basil!",5.0
"My fiance loves Thai food. On Friday, we made plans to go eat Thai for her birthday along  with my cousin and her boyfriend.  They recommended this place to us saying the food was delicious.  I figured sure why not?  I've lived off Church Avenue all of my life, the thought of supporting a local business seemed like a good idea.  IT WAS.  EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT. The service, the decor, the food, the drinks...everything.  We ate like champs and left a well deserved 25% tip.  This small bistro is a gem in Brooklyn.  Prior to this I wasn't even a big fan of Thai...but I am NOW.  Great food.  The next day we decided to order in....yup...you guessed it....AM THAI.  We just HAD to have it again.  I'm not making this up.  Delivery was quick and the food was just as tasty.  I highly recommend this spot and I do plan on going again in the near future.   I posted this on my facebook page and some of my friends are going as well.  Try their lychee martinis....excellent!",5.0
