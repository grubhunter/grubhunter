"I've passed Fette Sau one too many times.  I finally got the chance to try it!  There are a handful of picnic tables outside on your way in.  The inside is not as big as I imagined, but there are long picnic tables inside as well.  The bar is awesome, especially the beer tap handles.  They're made of rustic knives.  Our bartender was also fantastic!  Very nice and attentive.Now for the BBQ.  Sides: Potato Salad was too vinaigrette-y, but the Broccoli Salad was so good.  The Baked Beans were also a surprising winner.  The fact that they give Hawaiian rolls instead of any old bread was really a nice touch.  We got Brisket, Ribs, Pulled Pork, and Bacon.  The Brisket and Ribs were not as tender as I thought they'd be.  I think the Pulled Pork was my favorite, especially with the BBQ sauce.  Overall, it's good BBQ and a fun atmosphere.",4.0
"Fette Sau is great. Love the inside and the rustic feel. Really nice people work the joint. The prices are a but high for my taste but probably par for the course compared to other spots in the area. Brisket goes about $29/lb, pulled pork at $24/lb, and sides around $4-9.The pulled pork is awesome. Nice and smokey with big chunks, not all shredded to hell. The brisket is also good but a little less flavorful than i would like. The burnt parts of skin on the brisket is awesome thought. The burnt end beans. Oh the beans. My favorite thing ever. And these ones are amazing. With some Hawaiian sweet rolls. For $7. Makes me a happy happy man. The beans are where its at. Overall i come here whenever I'm in the area. Very quality bbq. Great sides. And decent price.",4.0
"Great brisket and burnt edge beans.My main complaint with this place is how expensive it is, and the battle for a table isn't something I wanna deal with when grabbing a bite. Also, no Mac & Cheese!?! I could've sworn I came here 4 or 5 years ago and they had Mac on the menu - what the hell happened!?!Good 'Cue, though not worth having to fight the hipster brigade for a table.",3.0
"One of New Yorks best BBQ spots. It can be pricey but the smoke smell around metropolitan ave will make you come in for some BBQ. I'm a huge fan for their  Ribs and smoke sausage. My favorite sides are the broccoli and German potato salad. I'm not a fan of their brisket, the rub needs a little more brown sugar and less coffee.",4.0
"Completely Underwhelming. To quote my friend: ""BBQ is the one food thats supposed to be served hot and today it was cold AF."" The saving grace for the trip out here there was no line (I think because it was a very cold February day.) Otherwise, I think I would have been VERY annoyed to come out all the way to this BBQ joint and wait for at least 45 mins, for the level of BBQ we experienced. Lets run through the meal: The meat was COLD. Why? Why would the meat at a bbq place be COLD? That is NOT okay. I ordered a quarter pound of the pork shoulder while the taste was fine, it was cold and nothing to write home about. My friend ordered the ribs and thought they were okay but again, cold. The sauce selection is lacking. They have one traditional bbq sauce that is too sweet. The other is this completely weird spicy sauce that makes no sense. At first I thought I just didnt like it, but my friend actually knows her hot sauce and agreed the taste was OFF. As for the sides, Ill give them star for being somewhat healthy. I like that they have broccoli and potato salad (this is a healthier potato salad with mustard I believe, no mayo it seems.) We also had the beans and that was the standout for the day. The beans were the only dish that were served warm and really tasty! Also liked the rolls (not made in house obviously). We spent about 40$ for 1/4 lb of pulled pork, 1/4 of ribs (2 ribs), broccoli, potato salad, and beans. The place is pretty tiny for most of the other BBQ places I have visited in NYC. Seating is communal. The staff is really great at cleaning up the tables. The staff was also helpful behind the counter in suggesting how much to order and if it would be enough or too little. Ultimately, Ive experienced better bbq in nyc. Different strokes for different folks, but this bbq aint for me.",2.0
"So I've been meaning to try this for YEARS. I decided to stop by since I had to be in Brooklyn anyway. So I got there at 5pm when it opened and there was already a small line. I looked at the menu (changes daily, apparently) and got a half pound of BRISKET and a SAUSAGE. They serve them on wax paper on silver trays. I sat down cafeteria-style and I didn't talk to anyone or look at anyone. I just devoured. I was kinda glad that no one else was with me to witness it.   I was more relieved that I didn't have to share. THAT BRISKET WAS SO MOIST. I ate the piece of fat that hung onto the meat and together, it was like heaven in my mouth. They take credit card. You're welcome.",4.0
Ordered: BrisketPros-- The brisket was the best BBQ I've ever had. The burnt ends were charred to perfection and enjoyable to eat. I liked that they had dispensers of water (free of charge) available and meat sauces accessible on the tables.Cons--I was disappointed by their side dish selections as it was very limited. I was informed that they no longer had mac and cheese which is a traditional BBQ side and would've helped lighten the hearty flavors.,5.0
"Maybe I had Fette Sau on a bad day, but I did not like it as much as the rest of the Yelp world did. Had the ribs, brisket, beans with burnt ends, and broccoli. The ribs were great and the highlight of my meal. We got some super fatty brisket pieces, so didn't enjoy that at all. Both of the sides were decent. I did like the bread rolls they provide with the meal.  Might come back and see if I just got them on a bad day.",3.0
Great BBQ spot in the neighborhood. The brisket and ribs were both top notch. Pretty descent selection of rotating drafts to choose from. Prices were on the high side but understandable considering the location. We will be back again to taste some more of the menu.,5.0

"The best BBQ I've had so far. In my opinion, it was better than Blue Smoke, Mighty Quinn's, and Dinosaur BBQ. The food was mouthwatering good!

Loved the broccoli salad, the ""German"" potato salad was a nice addition, but nothing special to me. Sat down at one of their long community tables inside and who is sitting next to me? Germans :-)And!!! The have the heavenly Blenheim ginger ale. Not the super spicy one though. But good enough. Who has the meat? Fette Sau does!",4.0
"This place smelled amazing!! I swear the craft beer I was drinking tasted of BBQ sauce. Stopped in here on they way to a concert and found the lines for food as long as the food spot itself. The place smelled of delicious southern style comfort foods. I would like to check this place back during the winter for the patio area, to see if they have the heater lamps. I didn't get a chance to check pricing but still really a good place, I'll be back during the summer for more beer!",4.0

"Came here on a Friday afternoon for lunch and was fortunate enough to not have a long line waiting for me. First impression was that this place is definitely a Brooklyn BBQ joint. Long picnic benches indoors with a bar on the side. They also had outdoor seating with an awning over it, great for blocking hot sunny days. My friend and I got 4 Pork Ribs and  1/2 a lb of brisket. The meal came out to be about $50. The ribs were fall-off-the-bone delicious and the brisket had a nice layer of fat with it. We also got sides of Guss' half-sour kosher pickles and burnt end baked beans. Both were great sides to complement the meat. Our meal automatically came with potato rolls, and nothing can really go wrong with potato bread. We were definitely full by the end of the meal. I can see why this place would typically have a long line waiting out the door. I would have given it 5 stars for the service, food and atmosphere but unfortunately there was no serving of mac and cheese which I find to be quite vital.  Still delicious!

"We enjoyed an appetizing and filling lunch here this past weekend. The line gets long but it goes by fast, although there appeared to be only one person taking the orders and cutting/weighing meats and preparing side dishes on the tray.

The sides we had were broccoli salad, corn on the cob and baked beans. All were very flavorful & delish!The seating are plentiful and are in bench-style/picnic table format. There's about 6-8 tables inside and more outside. They also offer an indoor bar. We just had root beer and drank the free water that was provided by the front.

"This is what barbecue is about. Almost always an enormous line, but this is worth every single minute you wait in line.

Great food, great workers. If you got them both you can't really fail.Also last thought, the cornbread is surprisingly delicious. Very few BBQ places have good cornbread.

"Rating: OutperformPrice target: $30We were quick to mention Mighty Quinns as the best BBQ in NYC. We stand corrected with the most recent experience at Fette Sau (SAU). Although Mighty Quinns holds a better price/quality ratio (due to extremely high quality and low prices), we believe SAU has a better overall quality. Baked beans were a solid increase to ROI. The line is out the door, but only the best things come to people who wait. If you're having a bad day, go to SAU. It will make you feel like you accidentally opened an brokerage account in March 2009, and forgot about it until now.

"Good BBQ spot. Firstly the restaurant always appears to look closed from the street. You have to walk around the corner to access the door to the restaurant. Once inside the theme and decor is cool, industrial. The price of meat is by the weight (per lb) and sides are priced individually. Between 2 of us we ordered 1/4lb pulled pork, 1/2lb brisket and 2 ribs with a side of broccoli and and burnt end baked beans. The BBQ was very good and the sides were also really good, which isn't always the case at these sort of places so I was impressed. The brisket melted in your mouth it was so tender, as were the ribs. I liked the rub they used on the ribs. The pulled pork was average. The burnt end baked beans were great, with lots of burnt ends! No skimping on the portion. The entire meal for the 2 of us came to $50 before drinks. Which when you look at it on a tray doesn't look like a lot, but for decent BBQ it is worth it. There is definitely a casual vibe to this place,  it is like cafeteria style, you seat yourself on long communal benches and clean up your tray afterwards. For the price you pay, a bit more service would be nice. There is also only 1 server on the meat counter. The bar is huge and was empty, they would be better making the bar smaller & maybe adding in an additional meat serving counter. Nevertheless, I would certainly return as I really rated the food.",4.0
"The barbecue here is top notch. It's pricey; the meats start at $20 per pound and go up to almost $40 per pound for others. We opted for the beef brisket. The meat was so soft and tender that is easily fell apart. The burnt edges were crisp; the char added a lot of smokey flavor too. I'd highly recommend the beef brisket.The sides range from about $3 to $7. During our visit, they had baked beans, potato salad, broccoli salad, and bagged chips. We were disappointed to not see other sides like Mac n cheese and mashed potatoes. Don't overlook the baked beans - they're outstanding! They're very tender and the sauce they're cooked in has a delicious taste.In addition to the great food, they have about eight great craft beer options to choose from which are served in near little mason jars.Note that about half the seating is outdoors (there are heat lamps for manageably cold days).",4.0
"BBQ is always a good idea. Even better is knowing that the place you're going to has that authentic BBQ feel to it. I'm talking long tables and benches, a tv screen showing a roaring fireplace (this was entertaining to see), a homey vibe with some woodwork and stone setting here and there. Not to mention, there's no table service, just like other joints (think Mighty Quinn's. Chipotle) you order at the counter, get your food then seat yoself. It's always packed, seating wise and line wise. The line extends to outdoors, but it actually isn't that bad. Once you  make it to the line indoors, you can decide what you want. Granted it's still a long line, BUT the line itself balances the table waiting. By the time you order your food and get your food, there'll be an opening for you and your friends to sit. So don't worry if you don't see any openings at first for a table, it comes after you get your food.Moving onto the food, me and my friend both shared the brisket and ribs, with broccoli salad and beans as sides. The potato rolls that came with the platter also helped put together this delicious meal. First off, the brisket was so tender, juicy, flavorful, not too much fatty either, add some of their sauce on the table, you get a dynamo in your mouth.The ribs looked charred but it's actually better tasting. You can taste the smokiness and the meat easily comes off the bones with a fork and knife, so that's a plus. The broccoli was just the vegetables to balance out all the meatiness of the dish. Nothing special about that. The beans were pretty good too, there's a slight kick to it.Overall, this spot hit BBQ meat spot on. Always opt for the brisket. We like the brisket over the ribs, probably because we also ate the brisket with the rolls like a mini sandwich.",4.0
"When Fette Sau isn't busy (Mon-Wed & Thurs-Sun before 7 PM) it's worth a visit.  You walk in, queue up to order your food at the counter.  Meat is ordered by the pound and you get two slices of bread with each order.  As your food is prepared you pay, and have enough time to get yourself a half gallon, or gallon of beer if that's your thing. If whiskeys more your liking they have a very healthy collection.The decour is",4.0
"Awesome bbq! The meats are all very well cooked and juicy. Nothing dry or chewy. You order by the pound and then sit down so my bf waited in line while I hunted down a seat bc it's gets super crowded. We'd never ordered by the lb before so we didn't know how much to ask for (do you know how many lbs of meat you can eat?) thankfully the employees were able to help out. We got a variety of meats, all of which were good and 2 sides. I don't like baked beans but they were fantastic! Also got the broccoli which was great. The chips were meh, tasted like they came out of a bag so I would pass on that. Unfortunately they didn't have Mac n cheese when I was there but I hear it's great. I love that they have multiple bbq sauce options.

"Meat Mecca.  That may be a tad irreverent, but I needed the carnivorous alliteration.I'm not going to be the Southerner who says something cheeky about New York barbecue; this place does it right.  I love the community seating, the family style portions (which I totally took down without a family present) and the simplicity of the of the customer side of their operations.  Check out which delicious foods they have available on their chalk board, tell 'em how much of each meat you want by the pound, 1/2 lb, 1/4 lb or even 1/8 lb (for some reason), pick your sides (like their burnt end baked beans), grab a craft beer, have a seat and get paid. It's as simple as that.I had tasso pork shoulder, pork belly and beer.  Everything a growing boy needs.",5.0
"All these years later, the line still moves slowly. And that line still blocks the bathroom. And you still need to send a party to look for gaps in the tables when you get close to arriving or risk spending 10 minutes ""circling"" while looking for a spot. This is especially true during a rainy or cold day where the outdoor tables are no option. So while Fette Sau seems to have done nothing to alleviate the traffic problems of its early days, they also haven't lowered standards despite an expansion in Philadelphia. We're still getting top-quality meat paid by the pound. Certainly there's more competition than when I first came here in the spring of 2008. The once ambitious beer list is pretty bog standard, having not kept up with trends in micro brewing. Hometown, John Brown's, Brisketown and Mighty Quinn's have moved in, in some cases offering better versions of meats that are served here. While comparing everyone against other is a very subjective game, I'll cop to finding the pork belly and sausages at Fette Sau particularly strong, while the brisket and pulled pork not being best in class. Fette Sau also has the best sauces of the four (well Brisketown doesn't really count here, as they have no sauce.)An important place in the development of the neighborhood, and a bit of an instant history lesson that comes with satisfying food.",4.0

The bar is huge and was empty, they would be better making the bar smaller & maybe adding in an additional meat serving counter. Nevertheless, I would certainly return as I really rated the food.",4.0
"The barbecue here is top notch. It's pricey; the meats start at $20 per pound and go up to almost $40 per pound for others. We opted for the beef brisket. The meat was so soft and tender that is easily fell apart. The burnt edges were crisp; the char added a lot of smokey flavor too. I'd highly recommend the beef brisket.The sides range from about $3 to $7. During our visit, they had baked beans, potato salad, broccoli salad, and bagged chips. We were disappointed to not see other sides like Mac n cheese and mashed potatoes. Don't overlook the baked beans - they're outstanding! They're very tender and the sauce they're cooked in has a delicious taste.In addition to the great food, they have about eight great craft beer options to choose from which are served in near little mason jars.Note that about half the seating is outdoors (there are heat lamps for manageably cold days).",4.0
"BBQ is always a good idea. Even better is knowing that the place you're going to has that authentic BBQ feel to it. I'm talking long tables and benches, a tv screen showing a roaring fireplace (this was entertaining to see), a homey vibe with some woodwork and stone setting here and there. Not to mention, there's no table service, just like other joints (think Mighty Quinn's. Chipotle) you order at the counter, get your food then seat yoself. It's always packed, seating wise and line wise. The line extends to outdoors, but it actually isn't that bad. Once you  make it to the line indoors, you can decide what you want. Granted it's still a long line, BUT the line itself balances the table waiting. By the time you order your food and get your food, there'll be an opening for you and your friends to sit. So don't worry if you don't see any openings at first for a table, it comes after you get your food.Moving onto the food, me and my friend both shared the brisket and ribs, with broccoli salad and beans as sides. The potato rolls that came with the platter also helped put together this delicious meal. First off, the brisket was so tender, juicy, flavorful, not too much fatty either, add some of their sauce on the table, you get a dynamo in your mouth.The ribs looked charred but it's actually better tasting. You can taste the smokiness and the meat easily comes off the bones with a fork and knife, so that's a plus. The broccoli was just the vegetables to balance out all the meatiness of the dish. Nothing special about that. The beans were pretty good too, there's a slight kick to it.Overall, this spot hit BBQ meat spot on. Always opt for the brisket. We like the brisket over the ribs, probably because we also ate the brisket with the rolls like a mini sandwich.",4.0
"When Fette Sau isn't busy (Mon-Wed & Thurs-Sun before 7 PM) it's worth a visit.  You walk in, queue up to order your food at the counter.  Meat is ordered by the pound and you get two slices of bread with each order.  As your food is prepared you pay, and have enough time to get yourself a half gallon, or gallon of beer if that's your thing. If whiskeys more your liking they have a very healthy collection.The decour is",4.0
"Awesome bbq! The meats are all very well cooked and juicy. Nothing dry or chewy. You order by the pound and then sit down so my bf waited in line while I hunted down a seat bc it's gets super crowded. We'd never ordered by the lb before so we didn't know how much to ask for (do you know how many lbs of meat you can eat?) thankfully the employees were able to help out. We got a variety of meats, all of which were good and 2 sides. I don't like baked beans but they were fantastic! Also got the broccoli which was great. The chips were meh, tasted like they came out of a bag so I would pass on that. Unfortunately they didn't have Mac n cheese when I was there but I hear it's great. I love that they have multiple bbq sauce options. I'm addicted to condiments and this place satisfied my addiction on all levelsFor dessert we got the key lime pie which is from Steve's key lime pies and I love them so it was awesomeThe drinks are awesome too. Good selection of beers",5.0
"Fantastic BBQ food.If you are looking for somewhere fancy, then this probably isn't the place for you but if you are after great BBQ food, go here!There's no table service, you go up to the counter and pick what you want. It's served on a metal tray and you take it back to your table.You cant book, and there can be a big queue.",5.0
"Meat Mecca.  That may be a tad irreverent, but I needed the carnivorous alliteration.I'm not going to be the Southerner who says something cheeky about New York barbecue; this place does it right.  I love the community seating, the family style portions (which I totally took down without a family present) and the simplicity of the of the customer side of their operations.  Check out which delicious foods they have available on their chalk board, tell 'em how much of each meat you want by the pound, 1/2 lb, 1/4 lb or even 1/8 lb (for some reason), pick your sides (like their burnt end baked beans), grab a craft beer, have a seat and get paid. It's as simple as that.I had tasso pork shoulder, pork belly and beer.  Everything a growing boy needs.",5.0
"All these years later, the line still moves slowly. And that line still blocks the bathroom. And you still need to send a party to look for gaps in the tables when you get close to arriving or risk spending 10 minutes ""circling"" while looking for a spot. This is especially true during a rainy or cold day where the outdoor tables are no option. So while Fette Sau seems to have done nothing to alleviate the traffic problems of its early days, they also haven't lowered standards despite an expansion in Philadelphia. We're still getting top-quality meat paid by the pound. Certainly there's more competition than when I first came here in the spring of 2008. The once ambitious beer list is pretty bog standard, having not kept up with trends in micro brewing. Hometown, John Brown's, Brisketown and Mighty Quinn's have moved in, in some cases offering better versions of meats that are served here. While comparing everyone against other is a very subjective game, I'll cop to finding the pork belly and sausages at Fette Sau particularly strong, while the brisket and pulled pork not being best in class. Fette Sau also has the best sauces of the four (well Brisketown doesn't really count here, as they have no sauce.)An important place in the development of the neighborhood, and a bit of an instant history lesson that comes with satisfying food.",4.0
"Great BBQ restaurant in Brooklyn. They really know how to smoke here. The space is raw, beers are plentiful and the food is very filling. Order by the pound, platter or plate and share. Worth the trip from Manhattan. Loved everything we got.",4.0
"If you're a meat fanatic (like I am), you will definitely and absolutely enjoy Fette Sau! I forgot exactly what we ordered but my favorite was the Pastrami! SOO juicy and bbq-y and just perfect!! The beans were TO DIEEEE FOR!!! If you go on a nice day, make sure to sit outdoors and also grab a beer or two! My bf and I enjoyed every bite of our meal! I will definitely be back!! :)",5.0
"Great barbecue!  We try to make a visit anytime we come to visit family. The variety of sides seemed smaller this last time but still good: sauer kraut, baked beans, broccoli. We got duck, bacon, pulled pork and sausage. All was really but the pulled pork needed sauce.Get there early, it fills up and when certain food items run out they're out. The menu changes due to availability.  They have a decent whiskey selection but the bartender didn't seem real interested in the customers, he seemed more interested in talking with a friend of his.Food is bought by weight - cooked weight not pre-cooked.",4.0
"If you can manage to get a seat at one of the communal tables, you've got your hands on some damned good bbq in Brooklyn!  I had the brisket, chicken, and sausage... All incredible! Very distinct flavor tastes like its slow cooked into all the meat! Each one their own unique flavor.  The sides are delicious too! I had the broccoli salad, the baked beans (omg delicioussss) and the pickles(probably the one thing I didn't like.. As I prefer either spicy or sweet dill pickles). Every order comes with sweet rolls of bread.  You get a nice big mess hall tray for your food.  The real and only downside to this place is the prices... There is no meal deal. You pay for every side and every meat, so dinner can easily add up to $60 for 3 sides and 2 meats.",4.0
"Wow-wow-wow. Not much more to say, I guess I could say HOLY-bar-be-que! I traveled all the way from Colorado to taste this wonderful gluttonous selection of meat! Everything was FANTASTIC! I recommend the brisket, ribs, and beans. I would also recommend buying the Fette Sau dry rub to take home and slap on all your favorite cuts. Don't wear your finest clothes though, they will smell like smoke for weeks! This place is annually recognized by Zagat for a reason. Do yourself a favor, GO!!!!!",5.0
"After a booze-infused event at Fushimi, we were in dire need of sustenance. So we went here. When I am drunk, any foods I find even mildly palatable will taste good. We went here and I ordered 1/2 pound of pulled pork and 1/4 pound of brisket. If I was sober, I would have known not to spend 15$ on this amount of meat. Both of the meats were extremely dry and bland. My enhanced drunken palate and extreme hunger didn't make it good. I had to drown the meat in sauces to add moisture and flavor. They served it with subpar fish food bread. Aggressively mediocre. Go elsewhere.(Also...a BBQ place with no mac and cheese?! Whaaat?! Blasphemy.)",2.0
"Here's my short anecdote. It was July 4th and the peeps and I were thinking of having a BBQ but decided to eat in, because you know EVERYONE is going to be at the park BBQin....well we were wrong. The line here on July 4th was like waiting on line at the DMV, it must of took about an hour to finally grab some grub. Was the wait worth it? Absolutely, I'm not an expert on the type, differences, and structure of meat but to keep it simple..everything I had was DELICIOUS!This place is definitely set up for groups, you must bring a friend to share the enjoyment! Price is a little on the high side but it's a great place to try at least once.",5.0
"Expensive for beer / drinks, and the bbq, although delicious, was a bit overpriced! It's a fun low-key place to eat, but I think it was a bit overrated and did not truly ""stand out"" to me for bbq food...2 stars for decent food, good beer selection, and casual cozy ambiance.But I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here.",2.0
"I honestly loved every single meat I had here. I haven't tried all the BBQ spots in New York yet but Fette Sau serves some mouth-watering delicious smoked pieces of meat. They are leaps and bounds better than Mighty Quinn and Dinosaur BBQ. The set-up here is similar to Mighty Quinn (if you're familiar), you line up and order meat by the pound, then find communal seating to devour your acquired meats. There's a different line to order your drinks, as well. Between my boyfriend and I, we ate too much but we pretty much sampled every piece of meat available that day. We had the beef short ribs, beef brisket, slab bacon, pulled pork, spicy pork sausage and pork spare ribs. Everything was what I expect in a good BBQ..dry rubbed (I'm not fond of wet rubs especially on ribs), smoky flavor, juicy, lean & fatty (fat rendered so well) and tender meats. They definitely know what they're doing here. I'm salivating just thinking about it now.",5.0

"I have one rule when going on a first date: Never eat BBQ or Mexican. A man can't be trying to hit on his babe and make good conversations and good first impressions while feeling the stomach bubbles and puckering up his brown guy. What if you end up back at her place and you gotta beef real hard? You try to hold it in, but it seeps out, SBD style (""silent butt deadly, duh""). What are you gonna do blame it on the dog? What if she doesn't even have a dog??? So the other night, I'm Tindering. Tindering real hard. Like really getting after it. Like swiping at 63 SPMs (that's ""Swipes Per Minute"" of course). Man, like I'm getting matches left and right. Babes are messaging me. Thought I might even need to hire an assistant to manage my life! Could be a good investment. See, the thing about NYC is that there are wayyyy more babes than doods. Ever heard of a goldmine? Well, let me tell you, NYC is a babe mine! So I start messaging this one babe cuz she messaged me first. We'll call her BrooklynBabe26. (Not trying to have you stalk my girl. She's mine. AKA not yours.) Right outta the gate, she's all in. Convo goes like dis:BrooklynBabe26: hey Phil! You're cute! Me: Yeah, I know!BrooklynBabe26: You're funny. Dinner this week at Fette Sau?And game over!We worked out the details and two days later had a date. What a classy babe. I was on cloud 10. (Cloud 10 is way better than cloud 9, duh). Plus, she picked a Franch place! This could be a babe I bring home to mom! Decided to buy a Lonely Planet book on France and brush up on a few words in case I had to order in Franch. Really wanted to impress her. She was a Tinder 10 (aka a 7 or 8 in real life).Date night came real fast. We were meeting at 8. Everything was good until I get to the place. I walk in. Got there early of course so I could get us a sweet table cuz she said they don't take reservations, and I didn't want to wait around like a boob. OH MY GOD! How did I not look it up?! Why did I LET HER CHOOSE! It was a BBQ place! Who picks BBQ on a first date?! I'm starting to sweat. The line is super long. I'm hot. I'm already starting to fart! Just the smell is making me beef! Jesus. Next thing I know, some hot babe at the front of the line is waving at me. It's her. No escape. She's even better than the photos! She's real hot. I'm real nervous. Pull it together Phil. Said hi and told her to order for us. Said I'll eat any thing. BIg mistake. Now I""ll have to live up to that. Told her I had to run to the bathroom and check my contact. I don't even wear contacts! She bought it. I'm in the bathroom. Scoping out the scene in case I needed it later. You always gotta have a rear door evacuation plan, if you catch my drift. Five minutes later, and I leave the bathroom. She's already at a table with all the food. ""Hope you're hungry!"" She says. ""Hope you have a diaper!"" I said. Dinner was a blur.The food was so good. Brisket, pork belly, pork ribs, bunch of rolls, some burnt ends baked beans and this dank broccoli. Cooked just right. So juicy. So tender.Couldn't control myself. Ate so fast I started getting the meat sweats, followed by the meat spins, then the stomach bubbles. Was def sweating a lot. I was also puckering real hard at this point. And I was holding down one of the best convos of the century! Laughing, light touching, some heavy petting! Talk about multi-tasking! I was blasting the bean heat real hard too. Luckily no one could tell the difference between my brand and the smell of BBQ.  Couldn't hold it any longer so excused myself to the bathroom. It was bad. Real bad. I had a serious situation going on. I quickly text my date, ""Hey! Sry, my mom called. Gotta take this. It's real quiet in here. Be out soon!"" I knew that would give me some extra time! Next thing I know, it's been 20 minutes. Felt so much better. (Pro tip: When your body tells you it's time, you listen!) Figured I was home clear! I open the door and there's literally a line of 7 people waiting to get in. Oh my god. Seriously! Do all these people have IBS? Why can't you have 8 bathrooms? Whatever, it's my own fault I have a sensitive system. Shouldn't have had that extra piece of brisket.  She asked how my mom was, and then said she likes a guy who takes time out for their family. Whoa, she bought it! She wanted to grab a drink at another bar, but I was still burning at both ends (burps and beef) and needed to be near the home base. Figured I'd ""be a gentleman"" and call it a night.We get outside, and I order an Uber for her...from my phone, from my account. Real boss move. She was impressed. The Uber rolls up, I lean in to say goodbye and let's just say I didn't get her cheek! The rest of the details are not for you! Get your own life!I gotta say Fette Sau was some of the best BBQ I've ever had. No joke. It's the kinda place you go with friends and your babe once you are farting in front of her.

"Good lord my poor arteries!!We went to visit this bbq place on the weekend after hearing so many good things online. We ordered pork ribs, boar belly, brisket, pulled pork shoulder, broccoli, potato salad, and burnt end baked beans. Everything was really good. What stood out were all the pork based meats. They were excellent! To be honest the brisket was good but mighty Quinn's is better. The sides are vinegar based and tasty. They also have an excellent beer selection.  I can see it gets really crowded here and the seating is free for all. It wasn't terrible when I went but be prepared to fight people for seating.",4.0

It was mouthfuls of  salty,tender and fatty. Everything you expect from pork belly.Berkshire Country Ribs- this had a good flavor. Probably the second item we liked.We also ordered the baked beans and potato salad.Wasn't a fan of the beans and the potato salad was ok, Would probably skip both sides if I come back.Overall, aside from the pork belly and the ribs, I wasn't a fan of the food.",3.0

"The BBQ meat here is truly smoked to meat-heaven deliciousness.

The beans were too salty for my taste, but my husband and sister-in-law love the beans. So why 3 stars? Minus 1 star for the price.  Our order came to $90something.  I wanted a side of broccoli,  but when I saw how small the broccoli was, I said forget it.  Overpriced in my opinion.

"The crazy thing about this place is that its literally out of a garage. 3 long wooden cafeteria-like tables where patrons fight for seats like it's the high school lunchroom all over again just with quality food and drink. It was drizzling outside and people were still lining up for this place. Comes to show the dedication people have to eatting here once their mind is set on it.The best part of the meal was definitely the Beans. I'm usually not a fan of beans but Fette Sau knows how to cook em. Slab some in the dinner rolls they supply you or just eat em straight up they are definitely the star of Fette Sau. Other sides we tried was the potato salad which in my opinion was very vinegar-y and sour and pickles. But i recommend getting some vegetables such as the broccoli salad cause this meal is HEAVY.My friends and I sampled out the brisket, shoulder, pork belly and spare ribs. The spare ribs melted off the bone. The taste was a great balance between the charred exterior and melty fatty goodness under it. Brisket is also the way to go, though it seemed a lil dry adding some of the bbq sauce provided on the tables didnt seem to mess up the cause. I especially like pork belly so that was my immediate favorite.The shoulder was probably the worst of the four meats we tried but nevertheless tasty.There are many beers on tap and its served in mason jars at $7 a pint. The meat is served by the pound. For three people we got 1/4 lb of brisket, shoulder and pork belly and asked for 6 spare ribs since 1/4 lb of spare ribs = 2 ribs.Overall great experience with some minor pushing and shoving.",4.0

"Good lord my poor arteries!!We went to visit this bbq place on the weekend after hearing so many good things online. We ordered pork ribs, boar belly, brisket, pulled pork shoulder, broccoli, potato salad, and burnt end baked beans. Everything was really good. What stood out were all the pork based meats. They were excellent! To be honest the brisket was good but mighty Quinn's is better. The sides are vinegar based and tasty. They also have an excellent beer selection.  I can see it gets really crowded here and the seating is free for all. It wasn't terrible when I went but be prepared to fight people for seating.",4.0
"It was my second time going to feta, loved my first experience. However, 2 pieces of rib, 1 boney chicken thigh, a small sausage and a side of potato salad was $50 too much for the little food.

It was mouthfuls of  salty,tender and fatty. Everything you expect from pork belly.Berkshire Country Ribs- this had a good flavor. Probably the second item we liked.We also ordered the baked beans and potato salad.Wasn't a fan of the beans and the potato salad was ok, Would probably skip both sides if I come back.Overall, aside from the pork belly and the ribs, I wasn't a fan of the food.",3.0

My brother came into town so we went ""all the way to BK"" to finally try this place he had been raving about. YUM-MY!!!!! We got a little bit of everything (just for the three of us), and it was all delicious. My brother was happy too :) I was stuffed, but glad we finally made it. I didn't give the place 5 stars because 1) the line was really long and we waited for a while 2) sometimes it's hard to find seating and you have to hover a bit to find a table 3) I didn't love the cold broccoli and was hoping to have some mac'n cheese.

"Fette Sau is without a doubt, good... But not as amazing as everyone makes it seem. I've been here atleast twice or three times before... The first time didn't impress me with every single of their barbeque meats. Honestly, Hill Country Barbeque Market in the city still takes the crown for BBQ food in my opinion. However the decor here is pretty chill, and it's stashed inside an alleyway with indoor and outdoor seatings.My favorite here is their beef brisket, pork belly, and duck from the BBQ meats selection. It's absolutely moist, smoky, and flavorful. As for sides? GET THE MAC & CHEESE! It is slamminn. Their pork ribs are okay, quite inconsistent... Not really the best falling off the bone meat that I've had before... And nothing special or distinctive in taste. Just some ordinary decent ribs to me. I was quite sad the other day when I came here, they ran out of the beef ribs (Hill Country's beef ribs blow these out the water though), duck, and mach&cheese... Booo !!**BEWARE: the lines can be really long... Also seats & tables gets occupied quick. So once you see someone about to finish up, scoop it up quick the second they're about to get up!",4.0
"The short and sweet of it: super long line to order, well worth it because it's some of the best bbq I've had in New York if not beyond (100% recommend the pork belly!!), and the coolest casual atmosphere with picnic tables in and outside. Will definitely be returning!",5.0
"Yeah, I'm not a BBQ expert, but this pace is TOP NOTCH!! It is becoming a weekly Saturday activity. Best to go with one, maybe two friends, because seating can be sparse, but we've been lucky each time we've gone. If you each get two things and all share, that's the best way I've found to have a good time. I'm all about brisket and pork belly, so those are my go-to. Grab some of their AMAZING sauces and throw it on a roll with vinegar; it is heaven! The pickles are a great side, not too salty or tart, good crunch, fair price. Keep an eye out for the Smoked Jalapeno Sauce, it is a gift from the gods, but sporadically available. The habanero will burn your tongue off, so be careful. I didn't give a 5/5 bc the wait can take a REALLY longtime if you go at the wrong time. Also, it is on the pricey side, but if you stick to the boneless meat then you should be okay. The pulled pork can be dry, but it's good with the baked beans on a roll.",4.0

"Overpriced tourist trap!!!! I am fuming. How DARE this place charge what it charges. The element of surprise when it comes time to pay for your food that Fette Sau thrives off of is straight up criminal. I hadn't been in years and was reminded why last night when I went to pay for my tray of food, all of which was AGGRESSIVELY MEDIOCRE and cost $36 with tax and tip. I am truly shocked by the positive reviews on here. Have none of ya'll had good BBQ? Or are you just rich and don't care about value? I had 1/4 pound of pork shoulder, which was DRY; 1/4 pound of the pork belly that was BLAND; four small pork ribs that were FINE but served to me at room temp; and German style potato salad that was so BASIC I wanted to scream. Worst of all they don't hook up anything-- no coleslaw or pickles provided. Already thinking of ways to single-handedly bring this place down. Never again.",1.0
"I've always been a huge barbecue fan. My boyfriend recommended me this place while I was in Williamsburg, and I couldn't be happier! This is everything you want in a barbecue: chill vibe, great beer, and awesome meat!I came to the restaurant around 6pm, and it was already really packed. The line to get food stretched out in to the outdoor sitting place. I waited for about 30 minutes for my food. The guy who served me was very friendly and fast. I asked for the most moist part of the brisket, and he sliced the best two slices of brisket I have ever had! They just melted in my mouth like marshmallows! I also ordered the ribs, and they were very chewy and full of heavenliness. The smokiness was to the point, not too strong but not too subtle. You mix them with the sauce and order some pickles and you'll literally feel like you're in Texas!I sat at the bar, and the bartenders were very friendly as well. I got a pint of their draft beer (Kelso the speeding fire?), and it goes very well with the meat! Well done Fetta Sau. If I ever have the chance to come back to Brooklyn, I wouldn't mind eating here again! Still thinking about that brisket...",5.0
"I've been questing, and I guarantee: So-called 'BBQ joints' in NYC are child's play compared to this focused, fatty frenzy. It's no-nonsense, no-frills, all-encompassing meat and whiskey experience for the connoisseur. a focused fattening sold by the 1/4 lb. Incredible. Any meat loving friend visiting NYC gets taken here at least once. When I win the lottery, I will move next door and gorge until my mobility scooter can barely haul me away.",5.0
"I have to say that it is one of the best meat that I have eaten in NYC. In a simple saloon in williamsburg, you can find pork, beef well cooked and so delicious. There are shared tables inside and outside and the beer tap is quite nice, you must check it out! For me, the best one is the brisket, but the ribs are also so good. Potato salad is really tasteful. However, it is kind of expensive, it is not a place to go often.",5.0
"Let me preface this three-star review by saying that this is indeed some of the best, if not THE best BBQ I've ever had. My girlfriend and I shared some ribs and some brisket. Phenomenal flavor, texture and temperature. However, I did take two stars off and here's why:#1: The prices vs food quality. Here, the BBQ is sold by the pound. That's good for tailoring the prices to exactly what you want. That's reasonable and I got more than enough delicious pieces of meat for a nice, reasonable price, especially for the quality. What is NOT well and good are the prices for the sides. I saw that they were charging $3 per bag of potato chips. They're potato chips. I avoided those and instead got an order of the baked beans and an order of the german potato salad. They were $6 apiece. $12 would have gotten my girlfriend and myself an entire meal at a lesser place, but I figured it was worth taking the plunge. The baked beans were good, but nothing special. They complimented the BBQ well. The potato salad, however, was not good. It was over-tangy to the point of being inedible, with very little seasoning aside from what appeared to be a LOT of mustard and vinegar. It's like they got lazy with it and figured that having a potato/mustard/vinegar salad with a 1/1/1 ratio would be something hard enough to choke down that all the rich hipsters in the area would gladly pay $6 per portion. Furthermore, if you get enough meat, there's no need for sides in the first place, and we didn't even finish our order of baked beans. #2: The wait. The only thing that kept us waiting in that long, never-ending line for over an hour was the fact that we had read favorable reviews and schlepped from uptown Manhattan to Williamsburg on a busy Saturday night. If they know that they're so successful, I would have expected something a little bit more efficient. Who knows, maybe they'll get the memo if enough people complain. All in all, amazing and well-worth the price BBQ but steer clear of everything else that they're serving and don't come if you're in a time crunch. Unless you're rich and have lots of time on your hands.",3.0
Their bbq is superb.. the best I've had in NY. Pork belly and brisket are must-haves. Havent tried their sausage yet though so I will definitely try that my next trip here.,4.0
"Fette Sau is without a doubt, good... But not as amazing as everyone makes it seem. I've been here atleast twice or three times before... The first time didn't impress me with every single of their barbeque meats. Honestly, Hill Country Barbeque Market in the city still takes the crown for BBQ food in my opinion. However the decor here is pretty chill, and it's stashed inside an alleyway with indoor and outdoor seatings.My favorite here is their beef brisket, pork belly, and duck from the BBQ meats selection. It's absolutely moist, smoky, and flavorful. As for sides? GET THE MAC & CHEESE! It is slamminn. Their pork ribs are okay, quite inconsistent... Not really the best falling off the bone meat that I've had before... And nothing special or distinctive in taste. Just some ordinary decent ribs to me. I was quite sad the other day when I came here, they ran out of the beef ribs (Hill Country's beef ribs blow these out the water though), duck, and mach&cheese... Booo !!**BEWARE: the lines can be really long... Also seats & tables gets occupied quick. So once you see someone about to finish up, scoop it up quick the second they're about to get up!",4.0
"The short and sweet of it: super long line to order, well worth it because it's some of the best bbq I've had in New York if not beyond (100% recommend the pork belly!!), and the coolest casual atmosphere with picnic tables in and outside. Will definitely be returning!",5.0
"Yeah, I'm not a BBQ expert, but this pace is TOP NOTCH!! It is becoming a weekly Saturday activity. Best to go with one, maybe two friends, because seating can be sparse, but we've been lucky each time we've gone. If you each get two things and all share, that's the best way I've found to have a good time. I'm all about brisket and pork belly, so those are my go-to. Grab some of their AMAZING sauces and throw it on a roll with vinegar; it is heaven! The pickles are a great side, not too salty or tart, good crunch, fair price. Keep an eye out for the Smoked Jalapeno Sauce, it is a gift from the gods, but sporadically available. The habanero will burn your tongue off, so be careful. I didn't give a 5/5 bc the wait can take a REALLY longtime if you go at the wrong time. Also, it is on the pricey side, but if you stick to the boneless meat then you should be okay. The pulled pork can be dry, but it's good with the baked beans on a roll.",4.0
Very cool place to have an authentic bbq by the pound. My wife and I had a great time eating there. The place has a great atmosphere and they serve great beer as well. Definitely one of my favorites places in Brooklyn.,5.0
"Overpriced tourist trap!!!! I am fuming. How DARE this place charge what it charges. The element of surprise when it comes time to pay for your food that Fette Sau thrives off of is straight up criminal. I hadn't been in years and was reminded why last night when I went to pay for my tray of food, all of which was AGGRESSIVELY MEDIOCRE and cost $36 with tax and tip. I am truly shocked by the positive reviews on here. Have none of ya'll had good BBQ? Or are you just rich and don't care about value? I had 1/4 pound of pork shoulder, which was DRY; 1/4 pound of the pork belly that was BLAND; four small pork ribs that were FINE but served to me at room temp; and German style potato salad that was so BASIC I wanted to scream. Worst of all they don't hook up anything-- no coleslaw or pickles provided. Already thinking of ways to single-handedly bring this place down. Never again.",1.0
"I've always been a huge barbecue fan. My boyfriend recommended me this place while I was in Williamsburg, and I couldn't be happier! This is everything you want in a barbecue: chill vibe, great beer, and awesome meat!I came to the restaurant around 6pm, and it was already really packed. The line to get food stretched out in to the outdoor sitting place. I waited for about 30 minutes for my food. The guy who served me was very friendly and fast. I asked for the most moist part of the brisket, and he sliced the best two slices of brisket I have ever had! They just melted in my mouth like marshmallows! I also ordered the ribs, and they were very chewy and full of heavenliness. The smokiness was to the point, not too strong but not too subtle. You mix them with the sauce and order some pickles and you'll literally feel like you're in Texas!I sat at the bar, and the bartenders were very friendly as well. I got a pint of their draft beer (Kelso the speeding fire?), and it goes very well with the meat! Well done Fetta Sau. If I ever have the chance to come back to Brooklyn, I wouldn't mind eating here again! Still thinking about that brisket...",5.0
"I've been questing, and I guarantee: So-called 'BBQ joints' in NYC are child's play compared to this focused, fatty frenzy. It's no-nonsense, no-frills, all-encompassing meat and whiskey experience for the connoisseur. a focused fattening sold by the 1/4 lb. Incredible. Any meat loving friend visiting NYC gets taken here at least once. When I win the lottery, I will move next door and gorge until my mobility scooter can barely haul me away.",5.0
"I have to say that it is one of the best meat that I have eaten in NYC. In a simple saloon in williamsburg, you can find pork, beef well cooked and so delicious. There are shared tables inside and outside and the beer tap is quite nice, you must check it out! For me, the best one is the brisket, but the ribs are also so good. Potato salad is really tasteful. However, it is kind of expensive, it is not a place to go often.",5.0
"Let me preface this three-star review by saying that this is indeed some of the best, if not THE best BBQ I've ever had. My girlfriend and I shared some ribs and some brisket. Phenomenal flavor, texture and temperature. However, I did take two stars off and here's why:#1: The prices vs food quality. Here, the BBQ is sold by the pound. That's good for tailoring the prices to exactly what you want. That's reasonable and I got more than enough delicious pieces of meat for a nice, reasonable price, especially for the quality. What is NOT well and good are the prices for the sides. I saw that they were charging $3 per bag of potato chips. They're potato chips. I avoided those and instead got an order of the baked beans and an order of the german potato salad. They were $6 apiece. $12 would have gotten my girlfriend and myself an entire meal at a lesser place, but I figured it was worth taking the plunge. The baked beans were good, but nothing special. They complimented the BBQ well. The potato salad, however, was not good. It was over-tangy to the point of being inedible, with very little seasoning aside from what appeared to be a LOT of mustard and vinegar.

"Good food, worth the long wait and rude staff, i.e. Meat boy 2015. Came here to surprise a friend on her birthday with some birthday bbq. Reading reviews on how popular this place is and how crowded it can get, I imagined it would be near impossible to accommodate a party size of 20+ people. Fette Sau doesn't take reservations, but they had no qualms with us coming early and holding seats till the birthday girl showed up. We passed the time with a few gallons of their beers (served on knives taps; which were pretty cool), but the longer we waited, the longer the line got. At around 6:00-7:00 (on a Friday night), I estimate the wait for food to be around 10-15 minutes tops. Once it hit 8:00, the line was out the door. There were about 15 people ahead of me, but serving bbq must be a grueling process because we waited a little over an hour before ordering. The guy serving/cutting the meat was probably the least helpful guy on the planet. Meat boy doesn't care. Meat boy isn't interested in what you want. And meat boy isn't afraid to show you. Flagrantly rude and grumpy, meat boy will not take any time to explain to you anything on the menu nor will he give you any recommendations. Meat boy is the unforgiving twist of the knife at the end of Fette Sau's long wait. Ended up ordering:Brisket -- I prefer it a little fattier but was still very tender and tasty. Pork Belly -- So fatty. So soft. So good. Melts in your mouth. Perfect match with the rolls. Ribs -- The tender smokey meat fell right off the bone. Duck -- only allowed to order in 1/2 pounds (1/2 pound = 1/2 duck). A little dry, but expected from a bbq duck. German potato salad -- Sour and mustardy but pairs well with the meat and especially the bbq sauce.The food is without a doubt delicious. But what kills the experience is the wait time, climaxing at the moment's encounter with meat boy. Arrive early and avoid the wait or make sure you have someone to talk to on line. IMO, well worth the wait -- come for the food, not the service.",4.0

"Supposedly to have one of the best BBQs in the city, Fette Sau did not disappoint. We came on a Saturday around 1:30pm, it looked busy, but that's because there was a kid's birthday party going on and occupied one of the three communal tables in house. We only waited for about 5 min till we got to order. I don't understand why people would complain about the cashier/carver being unhelpful. I mean all the meats were right in front of you, you can SEE them. Just pick what looks the yummiest! The people behind the counter are there to carve the meat and take your money. They are not there to answer your questions like what's the difference between the rib and brisket, because if you don't know that, you probably shouldn't even be there.  Anyways, we got half pound of ribs and half pound of brisket, beans, and corn.  We sat down at the communal table, it was tight, but we didn't care. We started digging in. The brisket was amazing - juicy, fatty, meaty - all packed into one. They have two sauces on the table, one is the normal BBQ sauce and one is spicy, and when I say spicy, it is spicy. I tried both and even though normally I'd opt for the spicier option, in this case, the original BBQ sauce goes better with the meat. The ribs were very good, but it was only 4 small links, so I was having trouble understanding how that was half a pound...The baked beans may arguably be the best baked beans I've ever had, same as the corn. Ok the environment - love the décor, brick walls and wood ceiling, very simple and rustic. But somehow I didn't feel comfortable sitting there, and it's not the bench I was sitting on. It could be due to the kid's birthday party (the kid's parents must love BBQ very much), because I had to yell at my husband while talking to him when he was sitting right across from me, and I'm pretty sure we didn't come at a busy time given the short line.  At least based on my experience, it's not a relaxing spot to hang out and eat and drink.

"The BBQ here is amazing.  I also love the atmosphere, and they serve some pretty good beers too.  My only real gripe is the price.  It's very expensive!  When I ordered, I didn't know how much food to get so I ordered enough for 3 and trusted that he'd know how much we should get.  I picked 3 of the cheapest meats on their menu and it still wound up being over $75 (before tip).  And that doesn't take any drinks into consideration.  If you have a couple of $7 beers (plus tip), you're easily spending $45 per person. I think that's steep for BBQ.Oh yeah, make sure you get there kinda early. Their line gets pretty long and it moves incredibly slow.  I think they open at 5... I got there at 7 on a Friday night and it was not too crowded yet, although the outdoor space was all taken.  But the food line wasn't too long at 7. We decided to have a drink first, but by the time we finished it I then got in line and spent about 20-30 minutes waiting, despite there only being about 10 people ahead of me.It is good food though, and I will go back, but it's so expensive it's gotta be a special occasion.Oh, and as for particular meats... make sure you try the pork belly and the ribs!",4.0
"The food at his place deserves five stars hands down. Had a great meal, the first guy who helped us pick out meat and helped us with proportions for two of us to split. Everything he suggested was amazing. By the end of the meal we had some leftovers that we needed packed. Went back to the register a different guy that was there refused to give me a container with a top saying that they are not allowed and to use foil (to wrap German potato salad....) I went back and tried to do so and it was messy and inconvenient. Especially to take on a subway.  So I went back a second time and showed him and he said no, again. So I asked to speak to a manager. After 15 min of him trying to figure out how to contact them via phone he caved and just handed me a container. He was unbelievably rude and after having a great meal we left feeling pretty shitty and unhappy after spending a good amount of money. I don't care what rules are rules customer service comes first. I've worked in the restaurant industry for 14 years and this was unacceptable. I tried calling the manager myself after leaving and it said they were closed. Which clearly they were not. If only the customer service was all like the first gentleman who helped us there would have been no complaints what so ever.",3.0
"The BBQ is damn good. I'll just toss that out there. If you're wise you'll do what my friend and I did and just go straight carnivore and thumb your nose at PETA. Just order all of the meats by the quarter or half pound and skip the carby bread and beans and whatever other distractions are on the menu. The only carbs you need here are the beers (which I will get to momentarily). I enjoyed the brisket, the ribs, the pulled pork, the sausage and the pig stomach. Wait what? Pig stomach? Yeah, I had to try that. I will say, it's incredibly tasty, especially the crispy, caramelized exterior pieces, but the rest is just gelatinous fat. It's got a weird feel and texture and I couldn't eat that part. The crispy parts though, delectable.Overall the BBQ here can hang with dem boyz in Texas and the Cackalackies and wherever else. As for the beer selection, it had a few beers for the nitpicking beer nerds. Apparently Barrier (Long Island brewery) brews a beer especially for Fette Sau since there was a light, easy drinking pilsner on the menu called Fette Brau. I sipped this while standing in line but made the mistake of getting the half jar (they serve beers in half- or full-sized Mason jars) that lasted me about three sips. Next I had the Turkish Delight from Evil Twin which was surprisingly tasty, creamy, and dessert-like. Both beers did a good job of whetting my appetite without filling me up (cuz remember, you're here to stuff your face with meat). I also ordered some bourbon since the beers didn't last long and it seems Fette Sau has a pretty good selection. Bourbon might be the better route to drink to save room for food. Elijah Craig 12 year was available and it's always a good choice. I will note the place was crowded as Central Booking when we got in around 8PM on a Friday night and it took a solid half hour or more to order our food. I suggest not coming solo here as that will prevent you from keeping your place in line and ordering drinks at the bar. Also, the seating is picnic style and people will try to play holdsies so you just gotta let them know that they can't triple stamp a double stamp. Ya heard?

"Two words: baked beans. I would come here for the baked beans alone. They are THAT amazing. They're tangy, spicy, and meaty! Yum.We came here on a rainy Tuesday evening a little before 6.  We wanted to get here early to avoid the dinner rush. We got the brisket, sausage, and pork ribs.  The pork ribs were my least favorite but still very very good.  My favorite meat was the brisket because it was so tender and savory, I could easily eat the brisket on its own!Fette Sau has communal seating - so warning if you're not into that kind of thing. Regardless, I would highly recommend Fette Sau if you're looking for some mouth watering BBQ in Brooklyn!",4.0
"After reading all these four stars reviews, I decided to give it a try. It doesn't meet my expectation. I got a pound of sirloin. The meat is so dry and chewy.",1.0
"I heard about this place from a friend. Really worth trying. I wanted to try everything, but the guy behind the counter very kindly stop me from over ordering which I thought was nice of him. The pulled pork was a bit dry the day I went (nothing that the sauces on the table couldn't fix) But still very flavorful. Nice meal.I found it to be a bit pricy for the concept... I didn't order any alcohol, had the smallest amount possible of 3 different cuts and the amazing side of beans...l and spent $50 by myself. Nice long tables set up for a bit of mingling with strangers.",4.0
"Ahh-maz-ing! We ordered ribs which were to die for! Analyzing tender and burn a little (just how I like it). The potato salad was one of the best I've ever had. The sour kraut is pretty basic, nothing special. Overall, the place was super nice and the food was great. Definitely coming back!",5.0
"Dam I wanted to like this place. So long I wanted to try this place and what a utter dissapointment geez like someone else said the smell is amazing the food is another story terribly bland 71.00 for crap Berkshire my ass.

Mighty quinns destroys this place could have spent 35.00 there and been extremely happy this place sucks like the two critic's from  in loving color said ""hated it""",1.0
"That brisket is juiiiicccy. One of the best briskets of my life and I generally don't even like brisket. The pork rib was good. The bacon ends were delicious but you can't have too many- it's very easy to overkill it. You'll feel like you need to be rolled out of there when you're finished. Very easy to order too much food when you see the glistening, juicy hunks of meat looking back at you from the case.",4.0
"The BBQ here is amazing.  I also love the atmosphere, and they serve some pretty good beers too.  My only real gripe is the price.  It's very expensive!  When I ordered, I didn't know how much food to get so I ordered enough for 3 and trusted that he'd know how much we should get.  I picked 3 of the cheapest meats on their menu and it still wound up being over $75 (before tip).  And that doesn't take any drinks into consideration.  If you have a couple of $7 beers (plus tip), you're easily spending $45 per person. I think that's steep for BBQ.Oh yeah, make sure you get there kinda early. Their line gets pretty long and it moves incredibly slow.  I think they open at 5... I got there at 7 on a Friday night and it was not too crowded yet, although the outdoor space was all taken.  But the food line wasn't too long at 7. We decided to have a drink first, but by the time we finished it I then got in line and spent about 20-30 minutes waiting, despite there only being about 10 people ahead of me.It is good food though, and I will go back, but it's so expensive it's gotta be a special occasion.Oh, and as for particular meats... make sure you try the pork belly and the ribs!",4.0
"The food at his place deserves five stars hands down. Had a great meal, the first guy who helped us pick out meat and helped us with proportions for two of us to split. Everything he suggested was amazing. By the end of the meal we had some leftovers that we needed packed. Went back to the register a different guy that was there refused to give me a container with a top saying that they are not allowed and to use foil (to wrap German potato salad....) I went back and tried to do so and it was messy and inconvenient. Especially to take on a subway.  So I went back a second time and showed him and he said no, again. So I asked to speak to a manager. After 15 min of him trying to figure out how to contact them via phone he caved and just handed me a container. He was unbelievably rude and after having a great meal we left feeling pretty shitty and unhappy after spending a good amount of money. I don't care what rules are rules customer service comes first. I've worked in the restaurant industry for 14 years and this was unacceptable. I tried calling the manager myself after leaving and it said they were closed. Which clearly they were not. If only the customer service was all like the first gentleman who helped us there would have been no complaints what so ever.",3.0
"The BBQ is damn good. I'll just toss that out there. If you're wise you'll do what my friend and I did and just go straight carnivore and thumb your nose at PETA. Just order all of the meats by the quarter or half pound and skip the carby bread and beans and whatever other distractions are on the menu. The only carbs you need here are the beers (which I will get to momentarily). I enjoyed the brisket, the ribs, the pulled pork, the sausage and the pig stomach. Wait what? Pig stomach? Yeah, I had to try that. I will say, it's incredibly tasty, especially the crispy, caramelized exterior pieces, but the rest is just gelatinous fat. It's got a weird feel and texture and I couldn't eat that part. The crispy parts though, delectable.Overall the BBQ here can hang with dem boyz in Texas and the Cackalackies and wherever else. As for the beer selection, it had a few beers for the nitpicking beer nerds. Apparently Barrier (Long Island brewery) brews a beer especially for Fette Sau since there was a light, easy drinking pilsner on the menu called Fette Brau. I sipped this while standing in line but made the mistake of getting the half jar (they serve beers in half- or full-sized Mason jars) that lasted me about three sips. Next I had the Turkish Delight from Evil Twin which was surprisingly tasty, creamy, and dessert-like. Both beers did a good job of whetting my appetite without filling me up (cuz remember, you're here to stuff your face with meat). I also ordered some bourbon since the beers didn't last long and it seems Fette Sau has a pretty good selection. Bourbon might be the better route to drink to save room for food. Elijah Craig 12 year was available and it's always a good choice. I will note the place was crowded as Central Booking when we got in around 8PM on a Friday night and it took a solid half hour or more to order our food. I suggest not coming solo here as that will prevent you from keeping your place in line and ordering drinks at the bar. Also, the seating is picnic style and people will try to play holdsies so you just gotta let them know that they can't triple stamp a double stamp. Ya heard? Oh and expect between all the beer and bourbon you drink while waiting, plus while sitting (especially if you go crazy and by a growler size), plus the BBQ, you will spend a nice chunk of change here.

"By the time you fly to Austin, rent a car and drive to Lockhart, you will have spent more than it costs to eat at Fette Sau.At $33 a pound, the brisket (here with a peppery coating that entitles it to the appellation pastrami) better be damn good and it is. Is it better than Hill Country? yes. Is it better than Hometown? Closer question. Is it as good as Black's? More peppery here, not quite as tender and moist.Pork belly is worth a try, but might be the one we could have skipped to keep the bill down.And the ribs, well they were transcendent. I guess I couldn't see in the gloom of the case, that they were good sized st. louis ribs, not largish baby backs. So that full rack of meat popsicles added $58 to our bill. You know what, it was worth it. Peppery, meaty, tender but not overcooked. Better than the ribs in Memphis. Better than the ribs in Carolina. The best I can remember. Also better than the brisket and pork belly in this gourmand's opinion.Your meats come with 2 Martin's potato rolls per person instead of white bread. An array of sauces on the table, mustard, vinegar, sweet, etc.For sides we had the beans (tasty but too small a portion), the crisp broccoli salad (just about perfect), and the half-sour pickles (great, too small for the price). Our food cost for three was almost $150 before tip. We ate about 85-90% of what we ordered, so I am guessing if I had ordered just the right quantity about $130 for three. That's steep for barbeque eaten off paper plates on picnic tables. It's about as expensive as Blue Smoke, but the cue at Fette Sau is better.",5.0
"There was a time when I thought Dallas BBQ near Times Square was the best New York had to offer in the way of barbecue, and I may have been right. Since then barbecue has exploded in New York, becoming a hipper alternative to their native deli, which also specializes in meat-laden sandwiches and passing nods to vegetables (e.g. pickles). Fette Sau was even serving their three-day-brine pastrami in lieu of brisket when we visited. (The menu rotates daily.) At both Katz's and Fette Sau we dined at communal tables with strangers. Housed in a repurposed garage, Fette Sau's atmosphere is appropriately Williamsburg, though having football on the television reminded me of Texas. They have a wide selection of craft brews and spirits. Their meats come from organic family farms. They even have a firewood guy that supplies them with locally-sourced, kiln-dried firewood. I enjoyed the pastrami, pork shoulder, and collard greens. I favored the pork. They use a dry rub on their meats and don't recommend using sauce. I also don't recommend the three sauces I tried. One was ketchupy, another tasted too strongly of chilis, and the final was an au jus. I was disappointed that there were no other condiments (e.g. pickles, onions, jalapenos), though there are whole pickles for sale.",4.0

For two, we bought 1/2 a lb of beef brisket, half a rack of ribs, and for our sides- potato salad and pickles. The brisket was fine, but I was surprised by the ribs. I expected the meat to fall off the bone, but instead the rub was salty and the meat as dry. The potato salad was a Dijon/vinegar blend. It wasn't too good and the pickle was pretty much the only thing I enjoyed. If I go back, I will get the brisket again and will try the pork shoulder.",3.0

We seized the opportunity, ordered pork ribs, brisket, pork shoulder, and burnt ends baked beans.I don't know if it was because I was recovering from a cold and hadn't fully regained my sense of smell/taste or if the pork ribs were genuinely underseasoned, but they were bland. I ate every bit off the bone hoping that the fatty parts or the skin would prove more flavorful, but they were just kinda salty if anything..On to the pork shoulder: really tender meat, but slightly dry and again without much flavor. I will give their barbecue sauce credit for redeeming this cut. I could have drank it--the sauce is that delicious. The brisket was fine, but not even close to the best i've ever had. Still none of that juicy meaty flavor that I expect out of brisket. I loved the baked beans with burnt ends! The burnt ends in this side dish were the best meat we had all night. They provide a pretty generous portion too that I had to fight not to finish for fear of having a noisy walk home (read, gassy).Though the barbecue was disappointing, the atmosphere was fun.

"Ate dinner with two friends last night at Fette Sau. Two guys and one girl split half a pound of brisket, six ribs, six rolls, a side of beans and a side of potato salad. We each ordered a bottled non-alcoholic drink as well. The brisket was tender and perfectly seasoned, the ribs juicy and delicious, rolls fresh, beans tasty. Why only three stars? Three reasons: This is the worst customer service I have received in a long time. We were obviously first time diners and visibly excited to discover what was on the menu. The guy dishing the meat behind the counter and the blonde chick at the register barely gave any eye contact, did not smile, and pointed and gestured in response to our questions rather than deigning to dignify our questions with a verbal response. This is completely unacceptable and unwarranted behavior, and for this reason alone, I'd be willing to scratch this place off my list forever. Second, no Mac and cheese! Never been to bbq a place that doesn't serve that staple side, and we were all extremely disappointed to hear they didn't have it. Lastly, awful potato salad side. Not one of us touched it beyond the second bite. It was freezing cold, very vinegary and not at all what we were expecting. Perhaps this would have been refreshing on a hot summer evening but not on a December night with serious windchills.And for the curious, our meal for three with non-alcoholic bevs came up to 72 bucks. We were all stuffed even with the potato side left over. Tip jar at the register was pointedly ignored.",3.0

The ribs were very tender and smokey with a dry rub,  they have bbq sauce on the side to add yourself. It had great flavor and meaty. The brisket was delicious,  the burnt outside was well spiced and the inside was juicy and moist. It was extremely fatty though,  like half and half fat. The beans were just ok and the broccoli salad had a nice vinegary dressing on it. The buns were nothing to write home about. Over all I don't think the food,  atmosphere and definitely the service is worth the price tag. I wouldnt go back again because there are much better experiences else where.",3.0

"Ate dinner with two friends last night at Fette Sau. Two guys and one girl split half a pound of brisket, six ribs, six rolls, a side of beans and a side of potato salad. We each ordered a bottled non-alcoholic drink as well. The brisket was tender and perfectly seasoned, the ribs juicy and delicious, rolls fresh, beans tasty. Why only three stars? Three reasons: This is the worst customer service I have received in a long time. We were obviously first time diners and visibly excited to discover what was on the menu. The guy dishing the meat behind the counter and the blonde chick at the register barely gave any eye contact, did not smile, and pointed and gestured in response to our questions rather than deigning to dignify our questions with a verbal response. This is completely unacceptable and unwarranted behavior, and for this reason alone, I'd be willing to scratch this place off my list forever. Second, no Mac and cheese! Never been to bbq a place that doesn't serve that staple side, and we were all extremely disappointed to hear they didn't have it. Lastly, awful potato salad side. Not one of us touched it beyond the second bite. It was freezing cold, very vinegary and not at all what we were expecting. Perhaps this would have been refreshing on a hot summer evening but not on a December night with serious windchills.And for the curious, our meal for three with non-alcoholic bevs came up to 72 bucks. We were all stuffed even with the potato side left over. Tip jar at the register was pointedly ignored.",3.0
First of all the food was awesome! But the service and the seating really weren't enjoyable. You actually have to share paper towel rolls with strangers! And no one serves you but you can tip? Kinda weird. Pretty much 4 stars for the meats and the awesome broccoli and 1 for the whole communal seating thing. If I come here again; take out!,2.0
"Not a huge fan of porks, and bbq. This place is for more men than women since they don't give the food on a plate or anything. Just on a tray on top of wax paper which I'm not too crazy about. I love their burnt beans, it goes very well with the meats. It's good few times a year but I wouldn't recommend eat blackened (aka burnt) meat too often.",4.0

Great place for bbq. Is alittle pricey at 20-40 per pound. But just melts in your month. The lines are not that bad. Beer selection is good,5.0
"We stumbled upon this gem after leaving knitting factory. There was a 15 min line to order at the counter.

"This place is awesome! We ordered the brisket and pulled pork - to die for. The meat was incredibly tender. They serve it with potato buns so you can make little sandwiches...so good. We also tried the side of burnt ends beans which were super tasty. I'm not usually a fan of baked beans, but these weren't super sweet like I had expected. I've heard that their cornbread is great also, but they ran out when we were there. I will definitely be returning to try!",4.0
"YUM. This BBQ is amazing, knocks hill country out of the park. Every piece of meat I tried here was flavorful and juicy. We ordered the brisket, pork ribs & the pulled pork. The brisket was my favorite. It melted in my mouth it was so tender. As sides we got baked beans and broccoli salad. The broccoli salad was tangy and super good. I've never had anything like that before. The baked beans WOW. The burnt ends they mix in with them to give the beans flavor were the best part of this side. Nothing bad about it. We came on a Wednesday night around 7:30, had no wait and found seats right away. Probably added to the success of the experience. Will definitely be back!!!!",5.0
"First time here on a cold Sunday evening.  The plasma TV fire was a lovely touch.  I first sat at the bar waiting for my friend.  The metal saddles were rather uncomfortable.  I kept slipping off the saddle.  Maybe it just needed a horse to go along with the saddle.  In any case, their bourbon flights were cool.  Nice selection of bourbons and rye and also beers that you can order by the gallon.  That's a whole lotta beer.  As for the meat,  I may not be able to give a proper review because I'm not quite sure what the hell to do with heaps of meat.  The meat was decent but you had to really be generous with the sauces to elicit flavor.  Again, some foodies might be shaking their head at me right now.  I had my meat swimming in bbq sauce.  I just thought that the meat would have more flavor?  Seasoned?  The guys that joined me thought I was pretty crazy for not thinking this place was heaven on earth.  They really enjoyed this place.  They might even be obsessed.  Anywho, the pork belly was definitely the highlight.  I would probably just stick to that the next time I stop by. I didn't experience any long lines or busy tables when I went on Sunday around 6:30.  Probably the best time to go if you want to beat the rush.",3.0
"This is a very busy restaurant that's clearly very popular. While the food was good, due to the fact that the metal trays it is served on was cold, the food quickly reverted to room temperature. The pork belly was excellent, but I wish I could have tried it while it was hot. The busy nature of the restaurant also makes a relaxing sit-down experience difficult. The feeling I was left with was that I'd paid a steep price for a cold meal I had to eat in a very noisy, crowded environment. I'm sure it's a wonderful place when it's not packed.

To put that pricing in perspective, we could have had a rack each of similarly delicious ribs for the same price at say Blue Smoke or Mighty Quinns. I was taken aback. Cost was my only issue with Fette Sau, but the overpricing doesn't seem to be costing them much patronage, as there was a steady procession of willing customers.",3.0

Loved it.  We had the pork belly and brisket and sides of corn bread and collards.  Cool place.  We got there at about 630 on a Thursday night and we didn't experience the long waits that some reviewers wrote of.  If you have a hankering for yummy bbq and great beer I highly recommend it.,5.0
"Barbecue is good, smells fantastic while waiting on line for it, although of course not as up to par as some locations in the Midwest.  Had the pork shank (a tad too burnt on the outside for my taste and parts were a bit dry) but had a good flavor.  Also got the beans, which were super sweet/tangy (not quite my taste but group I went with agreed with that description).  Tad expensive for the quality and quantity.  Worth the try though, and have some interesting drinks on tap. Communal tables make it great for engaging in conversations with others. Not sure if it's a great place to be if it's pouring rain outside - there is a line that stretches out the door past 6pm and part of the seating area is outside. Also, it's cafeteria-style seating, so make sure you have someone grab a seat while you're close to ordering or you'll be stuck with a large tray of food and nowhere to sit!",3.0
"This BBQ is NOT FOR AMATEURS. There is plenty of good brisket and ribs in this town. Brisket town is great. So is Mighty Quins. You might like that. If you want and know more: this is the place for you. Dry rub ribs. Is it pickled broccoli?A solid soda. Awesome quality brisket. Understated stuff. The service is prompt and cool. It's not tryna be Disneyworld -- so if that is what you want, get out of here. Move to Florida. We could use the room.",5.0
"Wow this place is crazy good. I've had mighty quinn and dino bbq and this place is just mindblowing. The variety in dishes is fantastic, they have 6 main meats: spare rib, pork belly, pork shoulder, duck, spicy sausage, and brisket.We had everything but the duck since it was 41$ a pound, the rest averaged 25-29$ a pound, and you buy based on weight and you can buy as much or as little as you want. We spent an avg of $25 a person and we were very full. Spare ribs is the MUST HAVE (6/5), seriously the best thing ever, better than Dino bbq ribs and flavorwise i think quite similar to mighty quinn but I think the meat here is a little more tender. The pork belly is a fatty as expected and delish, and spicy sausage is huge and not as spicy as I would like but still very yummy. Pork shoulder was the only thing I wasn't the biggest fan of. Sides, you have to get the beef and pork BEANS. They are one of the best things on the menu, beware its a little bit salty but insanely good. The potato salad side is decent but too cold for my taste. Broccoli salad is literally just broccoli with some kind of dressing on it.Highly recommended, and make sure you use the BBQ sauce they have at the tables.",5.0
"Went here with a few friends, about 6 in total (7 if you include a 2 year old).I was put in charge of ordering the meats and I really couldn't decide so I basically ordered... pretty much everything on the menu. Yeah we had left overs.All of the meat was cooked very well. Mostly tender and juicy. Favorite was probably the beef brisket and the pork belly. The shoulder was probably my least favorite (it was the most lean and I like... meat fat)... but it was still good. For sides I ordered the potatoes, broccoli and baked beans. Nothing super special here but the beans were tasty.The reason why I couldn't justify giving this place 5 stars is because of the wait and the seating. We were actually lucky and only had to stand in line for about 40 minutes. Seating... forget about it. We crammed into a shared table (2 strangers just so happened to join us to our right). I get that this place is popular but come on... I want to eat my bbq in comfort.I'll be back though.",4.0
"No other way to say it, but this food was sickening. It just about ruined our night. We had plans to go out in the area afterward but we were so nauseated that we decided to forego everything else until we felt better.Another thing you should know is that this place is nowhere near cheap.

I used to live a couple doors down from this place back before the glass condos went up. Maybe the folks at Fette Sau don't like all the yuppies that have moved in and decided the quality of what they were once doing wouldn't be respected enough to make it worth putting in the effort anymore, but back when I was in the neighborhood I loved this place.

"To be honest the BBQ was ok. It wasn't the best I ever had but after having Hometown Bar-B-Que (yelp.com/biz/hometown-ba…) nothing has come close to the meats here in the Northeast as best BBQ to me is still in TX. Kind of the same style when ordering as in you walk to the front and order the meat and they cut it right in front of you. I ordered the brisket, pork belly, beans, and potato salad. I came here for lunch as it wasn't too crowded. They have a separate line for the bar area inside this made up garage. They have a few tables outside in the front so if anyone is waiting in line you can watch others eat the crave you've been waiting for. The brisket has a smoky out skin and the meat was tender. Half a pound of meat is good portion for one person as I almost ordered a full pound of each meat. Luckily the butcher swayed me in the right direction on how to order. The pork belly was really good with enough rich and tasty fat flavor to have my heart skip a beat. I liked this better than the brisket. The beans were heavier than I expected it to be and definitely worth getting because it smells and looks delicious through the glass window when you first order at the front. The potato salad wasn't bad but I wasn't ecstatic after eating it. I would come back again but for like $45 of food, I want more out of this relationship.",3.0
"Everything is good, but honestly just get the ribs. The ribs are the winner FO SHO. They're very generous with potato buns and pickles, if that's your type of thing.The pulled pork was dry and could use more salt. The beef brisket was not as tasty as I was hoping, I liked the burnt ends more than anything else. The pork sausage was your average pork sausage, no complaints here but wasn't blown away.Again, just get the ribs. The rub is AMAZING and the meat is extremely tender. I could pull the bones off the meat without any resistance too! Which is such a plus for me because I hate using my hands to eat.",3.0
"I haven't written a yelp review in YEARS, but after visiting Fette Sau for the first time over the weekend, I had to revisit and let them know how great our experience was. While the line took forever (it wasn't that long, only about 5-7 people, but still a 15 min wait to place an order)- we ended up getting a quarter pound of their daily offering: the ribs, pulled pork, beef brisket, and the pork belly with the broccoli and potato salad. The sides were BOMB, super vinegary and flavorful, and the all the meat was amazing but the pork belly was seriously stood out. Usually pork belly is super fatty and sometimes cooked, but they did a great job of packing in the flavor and the burnt ends. I don't even LIKE bbq like that, or meat for that matter- I'm a veggie and fish kind of girl- but this place blew me away! It was a group of us and we kept saying we wish we weren't full so we could order it all again. 100% will be back! Just need to hit the gym 10x a week first ;)",5.0
"I've gotta say I love the food here. The pork belly, the brisket and the ribs all fantastic. Juicy and tender, fall off the bone kind of meat. The pull pork is on the dry side, would have loved to pair it off with some of the sauces they had on the side but unfortunately the employee that had cut and packed our meat made it very hard for my friend and I to want to stay a minute longer. I know this guy heard me when I corrected myself a second later after I had said to stay to to go. You know how I know? By his attitude. He had paused and rolled his eyes and continued to make it to stay. I later asked him again to make it to go and he then instead of saying he would be a moment, which I would have been fine to wait for, while he helped another customer out. Instead I got the pause, rolled his eyes again and said ""I'm busy..there is wrapping paper over there, I don't know, wrap it yourself."" Just to clarify, there was only one person behind us. I know this place has a huge line most of the day.I can understand if you've been busy all day and you're frustrated but there is no need to take it out on your customers. I didn't pay $60+ plus tip to be someone's punching bag. As much as I'll be dreaming of the food here, I won't be returning due to the hostility of employees",1.0
Loved it.  We had the pork belly and brisket and sides of corn bread and collards.  Cool place.  We got there at about 630 on a Thursday night and we didn't experience the long waits that some reviewers wrote of.  If you have a hankering for yummy bbq and great beer I highly recommend it.,5.0
"Barbecue is good, smells fantastic while waiting on line for it, although of course not as up to par as some locations in the Midwest.  Had the pork shank (a tad too burnt on the outside for my taste and parts were a bit dry) but had a good flavor.  Also got the beans, which were super sweet/tangy (not quite my taste but group I went with agreed with that description).  Tad expensive for the quality and quantity.  Worth the try though, and have some interesting drinks on tap. Communal tables make it great for engaging in conversations with others. Not sure if it's a great place to be if it's pouring rain outside - there is a line that stretches out the door past 6pm and part of the seating area is outside. Also, it's cafeteria-style seating, so make sure you have someone grab a seat while you're close to ordering or you'll be stuck with a large tray of food and nowhere to sit!",3.0
"This BBQ is NOT FOR AMATEURS. There is plenty of good brisket and ribs in this town. Brisket town is great. So is Mighty Quins. You might like that. If you want and know more: this is the place for you. Dry rub ribs. Is it pickled broccoli?A solid soda. Awesome quality brisket. Understated stuff. The service is prompt and cool. It's not tryna be Disneyworld -- so if that is what you want, get out of here. Move to Florida. We could use the room.",5.0
"Wow this place is crazy good. I've had mighty quinn and dino bbq and this place is just mindblowing. The variety in dishes is fantastic, they have 6 main meats: spare rib, pork belly, pork shoulder, duck, spicy sausage, and brisket.We had everything but the duck since it was 41$ a pound, the rest averaged 25-29$ a pound, and you buy based on weight and you can buy as much or as little as you want. We spent an avg of $25 a person and we were very full. Spare ribs is the MUST HAVE (6/5), seriously the best thing ever, better than Dino bbq ribs and flavorwise i think quite similar to mighty quinn but I think the meat here is a little more tender. The pork belly is a fatty as expected and delish, and spicy sausage is huge and not as spicy as I would like but still very yummy. Pork shoulder was the only thing I wasn't the biggest fan of. Sides, you have to get the beef and pork BEANS. They are one of the best things on the menu, beware its a little bit salty but insanely good. The potato salad side is decent but too cold for my taste. Broccoli salad is literally just broccoli with some kind of dressing on it.Highly recommended, and make sure you use the BBQ sauce they have at the tables.",5.0
"Went here with a few friends, about 6 in total (7 if you include a 2 year old).I was put in charge of ordering the meats and I really couldn't decide so I basically ordered... pretty much everything on the menu. Yeah we had left overs.All of the meat was cooked very well. Mostly tender and juicy. Favorite was probably the beef brisket and the pork belly. The shoulder was probably my least favorite (it was the most lean and I like... meat fat)... but it was still good. For sides I ordered the potatoes, broccoli and baked beans. Nothing super special here but the beans were tasty.The reason why I couldn't justify giving this place 5 stars is because of the wait and the seating. We were actually lucky and only had to stand in line for about 40 minutes. Seating... forget about it. We crammed into a shared table (2 strangers just so happened to join us to our right). I get that this place is popular but come on... I want to eat my bbq in comfort.I'll be back though.",4.0
"No other way to say it, but this food was sickening. It just about ruined our night. We had plans to go out in the area afterward but we were so nauseated that we decided to forego everything else until we felt better.Another thing you should know is that this place is nowhere near cheap. We have the receipt to prove this if you don't believe it, but two (2) ribs, some broccoli and a handful of the worst sauerkraut I've ever had was $20.

"This is the best BBQ I've had in NYC - this place isn't ready compete with any of the well known Texas establishments, but it holds its own.

The brisket was pretty good, but did quite have that fall apart melt in your mouth unctuous quality of great brisket. The pulled pork was perfectly passable. My favorite of the meats was the pork shank, it was super moist and pulled clean off the bone. My far and away least favorite was the ribs - they were dry and chewy. The trio of sauces were nice - vinegar, spicy, and standard. They're not necessary but are nice. The only side I bothered with were the beans - I thoroughly enjoyed them because they were made with burnt ends. The beer list at this place is also very solid... and for some reason you can get bottles of wine if that's your jam.Full disclosure - I was pretty drunk when I ate here....

I mean, after waiting for about an hour, how could we not?My favorites? Definitely the short ribs, the pork belly and the brisket. The brisket was the best I've ever had (sorry mom), extremely moist and easy to tear apart. Try it! The pickles are good, but the broccoli salad is pretty in the norm.

Go get them.",5.0
"Definitely order by the pound and not by the rib unless you plan on dropping a couple hundred bucks. Its BBQ, hard to justify spending that much money for BBQ. Nevertheless, they were some really really good ribs.",4.0
"Even one star is too much for here. The counter man wad asking me what I wanted to have 5 times and he kept saying he didn't understand what I said and made a face. He had such rude attitude and I almost thought he must be a racist. I wanted to order for my boyfriend as to-go, but I didn't go back to order because I knew he was going to be like that mean to me. By the way, taste good? No... I don't understand why this place has 4 stars and long line. Totally wrong reputation in yelp. 1 star is even too good for them. He must be got sued one day if he keeps doing that.",1.0
"This place was great overall.A short walk from the Bedford L to a long line for dinner.The line did move quickly, however, there was only one cutter/counterman at work.I suspect this is to match the flow of diners being seated and leaving, but, this allowed for no speed up vs. takeout.The place is really great inside, if you can sit at the bar with a friend, do so.The vintage taps are definitely instagram worthy.The main standout, to me and my dining partner-in-crime was the pork.Get that. It's great. If it's a nice day, pack some tall cans, brown bags, and go to a park.Worth a side trip - this place is EASY to get to for visitors to Brooklyn.",4.0
"I trying to be optimistic about his place but I thinks not! I took my BF here for his birthday because he loves brisket, my bad taking him here.We tried pretty much whatever limited selection they had on a Wednesday night:Brisket, spare ribs, sausage, beans, and broccoli salad.Brisket- dry, dry, DRY! Lacked flavor and was overcooked to the point I had to drench the brisket in bbq sauce to help salvage it.Spareribs- this were ok, no big complaint.Sausage- I thought ok, my BF hated it and he loves sausages as well, sad.Beans- I personally did not care for the taste, did not eat even a 1/4 of it.Broccoli Salad: Pretty good, this only thing that was tasty to me.This place gets 1 star for the dry ass brisket -_- Sorry to say; this place is just trendy, and overly-popular. Don't come here if you want good tasting bbq. Hop over to Mighty Quinn's, sooooo much better.",1.0
"Recently drove back from FL and tried to make it a bbq road trip. Nothing came close to this place. Great 'bark' on the meat. Would have liked more variety of sauces like a mustard based one. Loved the pickles and German potato salad. Beware: prices on website (@ $16/lb) a lot less expensive than was the case when we arrived (@ $25/lb). It ain't cheap. $75 for 2, but granted our eyes were bigger than our stomachs. But still...",4.0
"Don't go for the service. He's busy, he can't be bothered and he won't hide it. Know what you want, ask for it and keep the line moving because you will be reading irritation and impatience off the dude's face. As for the food, it is really not up to par for the hype. Brisket should be far more tender and I can't say it's the best pulled pork I've had either. I've had it bookmarked a long time so I'm glad we were able to make our way over. It's too bad it wasn't as good as we had hoped.",3.0
"This weekend, I accomplished an amazing feat.I, along with my boyfriend and best friend ate about $80 worth of meats, in addition to about $30 worth of sides, and I'm so damn proud.Don't let the line outside of Fette Sau intimidate you. If it's within the gated area, it shouldn't take more than an hour for you to be in carnivore heaven, so stick it out. You can also skip ahead and get beer to stay hydrated during the long trek to the meat counter. Once we got to the front of the line, we just decided to order some of everything. I mean, after waiting for about an hour, how could we not?My favorites? Definitely the short ribs, the pork belly and the brisket. The brisket was the best I've ever had (sorry mom), extremely moist and easy to tear apart. Try it! The pickles are good, but the broccoli salad is pretty in the norm. Go for the potato salad and the baked beans.Fette Sau, worth the wait, worth the calories, worth the money, worth it all. Just do it.",5.0
"If u r looking for a good hang out place this is it. Great food, convenience location, the bar is like the cherry on top LOL. Unfortunately the ribs didn't taste as good as what I expected to be. Definitely try their brisket and if u like spicy food then go for their pork sausage.",4.0
"Sorry, Fette Sau. I actually gave you 2 tries before I wrote a review. The first time was a few months back where I got the brisket and pulled pork..just so not impressed. The sauces also were just okay. I couldn't believe how much I paid for a 1/2 pound of each and 3 drinks.My most recent visit I got the smoked sausage and a side of pickles and it was a little better but still not very good. Honestly, I'm don't really care too much about the line or even the kinda shitty attitude of the guys doing the counter service for food (bar was better) -it's just sub-par barbecue.",2.0
"LOVE IT! Yes, it is a bit pricey (and you end up getting way more than you wanted because your eyes are bigger than your stomach when the waiter starts putting meat on your little tray), but the entire atmosphere is super fun and feels just ""cool"". I usually order ""a little bit of everything"" to share with a couple of friends, which makes me super happy as I don't have to decide what I want ;) The tray of meat also comes with some amazing sides, my favourite are the bacon beans which are amazing! Not quite the right place for a date or to impress your parents, but ideal if you are going out with a bunch of guys who want some proper food ;)",5.0
"Everything I had was dope. Definitely some of the best bbq in the city. Tried all of the meats - the pork belly and pulled pork (with the vinegar sauce) were definitely my favorites. Sides wise, the beans are amazing and the sauerkraut and pickles are great palate cleansers.",5.0
"Favorite BBQ place is all of NY.  Depending on the day you go, there are different available meat choices. You order by weight and they slice it up for you and serve everything to you on a tray. You can add on a few sides too--I personally love the potato salad and the beans! My go-to meats are the brisket, ribs, and pulled pork, and I usually order about 1/4-1/2 lbs each to share with someone. The space is cute, but when it's really crowded it can be difficult to find a seat. Good beer options on tap too! Either to enjoy with your meal, or to get fairly drunk while waiting in the line to order your food. Worth it every time!",5.0
"Considering how intense the BBQ competition is in the City, this place is worth a pass.Maybe I caught them on an off-day, but given the price and the hype, I was disappointed.Although they were well seasoned and smoky, the brisket wasn't that tender. The ribs were downright tough. Thankfully I didn't have to wait in line when I went on a Saturday at 12:30pm. The potato buns were a nice touch I do have to say. The baked beans were hearty and filling, and themselves worthy of praise. Wasn't thrilled with the key lime pie either. At $7, it's about the size of your fist. I usually expect crunch from the graham cracker crust and firmness from the pie filling, and this pie presented me with neither.",3.0
"Terrible service. Two of the servers were so rude. It was actual pretty funny to watch. Haha. Won't ever go back and the food was not too good either. Go to Mabels BBQ instead. Lol the server told me, ""your foods not healthy."" Duh. It's BBQ. Lol",1.0
"Like this place needs another great review. But I'll do it any way . So here it goes : I love love love fette sau !!! This is hands down best place to get some good meat in NYC . Any thing they make is amazing !!!Great food , great value for your money !",5.0
"Disappointing.We spent about $40 for some ribs, a small pile of pulled pork, a spoonful of cole slaw and two glasses of wine. And, well, the meat was average at best - the pulled pork was dry as a bone (and we went there right after doors opened, at 5pm), the ribs were quite chewy ... we had great expectations after all we heard about FS, but this was one of the very few not-so-great experiences in NYC.",2.0
"Wayyy overpriced. The interior decor is as ghetto as it gets to the MAX!The seating is like in a school cafeteria, up to 20 people are seated on one big table. Major discomfort. It is self-service like at mcdonalds. You order and pickup your own food and seat yourself. I can't believe it has a high rating. One positive thing is that the place has a good vibe about it that's why I give it 2 stars and not 1 star.",2.0
"Had a great time here! Walked in, joined the food line, ordered half a pound of pulled pork (delicious by the way!), one sausage (really good), and half a pound of brisket (good). For sides we ordered the pickles and broccoli salad. We paid like $50 in food and it came with 4 dinner rolls.  I wish they had a bigger selection of sides like corn but everything was great. The ambiance was woodsy and just perfect for a quick meal. We noticed that people came in and eat and have draft beers and leave pretty quickly. The outdoor seating option is great too for warmer days. Will definitely be back soon!!",5.0
"What a great place. What a great meat I've ever had. I ordered beef, beef briskets, and I think it was duck. Ooooh, everything waa just delicious, just exelent. I don't have words to expkane.

"So happy I finally got to try the famed Fette Sau on a casual Sat night! We got there at 7pm and there was already a substantial line; think we waited at least 20 min.For two people, we got 3/4 lb brisket, 1/4 lb pulled pork, 1/2 lb pork belly and 1/2 lb beef short rib. Yes we totally ended up over ordering. I absolutely loved the pork belly which was so tender and deliciously fatty. My friend however thought the brisket was the best. You must try the meat with the BBQ sauce too! Usually I like my meat plain but the sauce really adds to it. Our side of broccoli was a great palate cleanser too. The pulled pork though I would skip entirely.It can be hard to find seating though so you should have one person scout out a seat once you get close enough to ordering. But don't have someone hold a table for a super long time while others are waiting; that's just rude.I still think Mighty Quinn's can hold its own compared to Fette Sau, but then again I might be biased due to its Manhattan location.",4.0

I'm not sure it's a good or bad thing that they consistently run out of brisket at least an hour or two before close.  Skip all sides but pickles and look at what you're buying before you order.

"Super casual spot with picnic tables and cafeteria style ordering and really delicious BBQ. We arrived 10 minutes before opening on a Saturday and there was already a small line forming. They opened the gates and we all proceeded like the cattle we were about to eat. Once you get to the case you place your order and they actually cut it right in front of your eyes. That way it stays moist and juicy but it can make the wait longer since really only one guy can fit back there. We had: moist brisket, bacon ends, ribs, broccoli salad, and half sour pickles. We had only a small amount of each since we had a whole day of eating ahead. The brisket was some of the best I've had- crispy, smoky crust and moist interior. Definitely better than Mighty Quinn's, and the stuff we eat at Passover .  Texas-quality. Ribs were meaty and fell off the bone. Pickles were a good counterpoint to all the meat. I'd skip the bacon, it was a little greasy. And I think the broccoli would've been more appetizing raw or blanched but it tasted good. They have a bar that is separate from the food line, which is good if you need to pop up for a beer. Overall a solid choice. I'd return.",5.0
I came here to try their BBQ but the next time I come will be for their awesome baked beans. I don't know what makes it so good. Each bite is really flavorful and has a nice kick to it.

I liked the pork ribs even though it was a little too fatty.  I'm so glad that there was NO WAIT for a table. That was my worst fear cause I heard from friends that the wait could be hours. When I walked in I was a little confused whether there was a list to be seated or just first come first serve. The bartender just said there's two separate lines (food and alcohol) and to grab a table. I really like the whole atmosphere. It's like a garage made into a restaurant.

"A couple friends and I decided to hit up Fette Sau to celebrate the end of the week. Got the brisket, ribs, pork belly, some potato salad and the included rolls. Brisket was delicious, right mix of lean and fat. Ribs were good too, albeit sort of expensive. Pork belly was a little rubbery, but you definitely cannot argue with slabs of pig fat. They had the two different sauces, the spicy smokier sauce, and the normal sweet barbecue sauce. I actually liked mixing them together to reach a nice sweet and spicy medium.Potato salad left something to be desired. It was good, but a ""Large"" is by no means a large portion and it came a bit too vinegary for my tastes. I love the sharpness of a potato salad, but this was drenched in a sour taste. Rolls look like they could have come from the grocery, but rolls are rolls are rolls.The bar was pretty sweet though. We all got some Allagash Whites to wash down the food and it was perfect.

I get a quarter pound of pork ribs; they come with two soft rolls,  which really hit the spot. The guys working the counter are super nice and after some inquiring the ribs are what they seemed happiest with. Now if I had not been a on a plane so long I'd have stated for a drink. Perhaps next time when I get in the other meats too",4.0
Went here for the first time yesterday! And all I can say is OMG so delicious! We had the pork cheek and pulled pork. For sides we had the German potato salad and the pickles. So yummy! Seating is limited so go at a good time. Beer was good and so was the ginger ale. Awesome vibe.,5.0
"We had this place recommended by a friend and were actually really excited to go. There is no doubt that the food was really good.

Simply because we had our experience totally ruined by the most arrogant staff we have ever come across. They couldn't have cared less about our presence in THEIR restaurant where WE payed (a lot of) money for THEIR service. You have to pay before you eat, so we tipped beforehand.

That day came sooner than I expected when I found myself on a business trip working with someone who happens to live in Williamsburg. When I mentioned I wanted to try Fette Sau, off we went.From Manhattan, it was an easy ride on the L-line to Bedford Avenue and just a few more blocks on Metropolitan Avenue in what looks to be a burgeoning gourmet ghetto. It was raining pretty hard, so no one was out on the front patio, but the industrial-looking cinder-block building was already getting packed at around 6:30PM on a Monday evening (see photos). It's community eating with rows of picnic tables and a few stools at the well-stocked bar. The chalkboard menu was hard to make out under the dim lights, but we noticed everything is sold by the pound. With a heavy-duty smoker in prominent view, clearly this is a carnivore's paradise as I couldn't wrap my head around such manly measurements, so I let my female colleague take control.We ended up getting quite a tray of food  (see photo) starting with a half-dozen of the Duroc Pork Spare Ribs ($22 per lb.), chock full of tender, smoked meat that fell right off the bone when I touched them. The Duroc Pulled Pork Shoulder ($18 per lb.) was equally good with the moist shards of pork bursting with flavor. However, the standout, meat-wise, were the $4 Berkshire Spicy Pork Sausages, very juicy with the seasoning inside the casing providing a nice little kick. We got four of their warm dinner rolls which along with a heaping pile of Sauerkraut allowed us to make our own hot dogs. Perhaps out of guilt, I ordered the Broccoli Salad, which was perfectly fine but hardly a comparable offset to the avalanche of meat on the tray.My most ignorant order came in the form of the Burnt End Baked Beans, deliciously sweet with the added, unintended indulgence of pulled pork thrown into the mix.

"Before we begin, if you're waiting in line, send someone to go procure seats or to buy line-waiting beer. Have this person bring back two beers because you'll most likely be waiting that long. I started near the garage door separating the interior and outside areas and it took me about 45 minutes to order.After trying the ribs, brisket and short rib, my opinion is that the BBQ was good but not extraordinary. At $24 to $29 a pound, the BBQ should be absolutely amazing. The only item I ate that approached amazing would be the Duroc short rib. The Duroc breed of pig is known for its reddish coat, hardiness and propensity to gain muscle quickly but still produce tender meat. The short rib fits that description but the smaller Duroc ribs I was given didn't have the same amount of juiciness. The brisket was tasty as well, but didn't have the glistening, moistness of freshly sliced brisket. The spicy broccoli salad is one of the best sides you can have with BBQ. Below is a break down of my meal, which cost $40 ($39.77) not including beer.1/4 lb Brisket - two slices1/4 lb Ribs - two ribs, on the smaller side1/2 lb Short Ribs - one short ribSmall Broccoli SaladMaybe it's because I can eat me some BBQ, but I didn't get much food for $40. To provide some perspective, Franklin BBQ in Austin, TX (Currently regarded as one of the best in the nation) charges $16 for a pound of ribs. Mighty Quinn's very tasty BBQ charges $23 for an entire rack of ribs. Fette Sau was charging $29 a pound for ribs the day I visited. I was told a single short rib would be around a 1/2 pound, so that's $15 per short rib, a short rib that was half bone. I just don't think Fette Sau's BBQ warrants the prices they are currently charging. A meal here will cost you double, maybe 2.5 times more than what you would pay for some very good BBQ elsewhere. I get the feeling Fette Sau is cashing in on its popularity while it can. I enjoyed the beer they had on tap but the chaos of communal seating, the long wait for food, and the cost made for an average experience. They do have a habit forming BBQ sauce that has some peppery spiciness to it that is very unique.",3.0
"The best thing about this place are the kitchen knife taps. The BBQ is overrated and the drinks are laughably overpriced.They charge $17 for a Manhattan made with Old Overholt. I mean, I love me some Old Overholt, but that's cheap whiskey. Give me a break. I had a $15 drink at another bar made by some mixologist that included a real dried rose in it. At least they put some effort into making it expensive. Like, this drink isn't cheap, but you are drinking a rose. Know what I'm saying? Lastly, the BBQ, although good, is not worth standing in line for. People literally stand in line all night. It just makes me laugh a little bit. Kind of like when New Yorkers' pay $9 for a Tecate. That is the shit beer you only drink on Cinco de Mayo. It's not cool or ironic. It's cheap crap. This place is definitely worth checking out, but it's also definitely overrated.",3.0

"I guess you could call my boyfriend and I BBQ snobs being from the south.  We wanted to try this place out due to the positive reviews and stars on yelp.  We were disappointed.  The BBQ ribs and brisket were ""ok"" but wasn't as flavorful as we hoped.  They also do not offer a great selection of sides that pair well with BBQ.  If you are in the area, and want really good BBQ, I would suggest going further down to our go-to place, Mables in N.Willyburg.  I don't even know why we ventured out to try something new in the first place...If ain't broke, don't fix it lol. Lesson learned.",2.0
"Waay overpriced, especially when you consider the fact that the food is just a notch above good. I can think of three other BBQ places in Brooklyn that mercilessly spank Fette Sau, and they're not presuming to be better than they are by charging exorbitant amounts for their food (though in their case it might actually be deserved).

"Famous BBQ? Gotta go! I haven't tried many legit BBQ joints.The area is cute and perfect for a finger lickin' meal. The BBQ sauce and spicy sauce are delish! It went well with everything. They sell by pound and by golly, it's quite pricey! We ordered quarter pounds of a few and everything added up to almost $50! What in the BBQ heck?The pulled shoulder was relatively moist. It went well with BBQ sauce and inside the bun. The pork ribs were rock hard! The brisket was ok.The sausage was ok.The pickles were...cucumbers.The baked beans was yum!The rub on the meats were a little tasteless in my opinion and was disappointed it was dry.Is that how it's supposed to be? I hope not.I was disappointed but still left satisfied and meated out. And poor.Fette sau, I will have to say nau.",3.0
"Before we begin, if you're waiting in line, send someone to go procure seats or to buy line-waiting beer. Have this person bring back two beers because you'll most likely be waiting that long. I started near the garage door separating the interior and outside areas and it took me about 45 minutes to order.After trying the ribs, brisket and short rib, my opinion is that the BBQ was good but not extraordinary. At $24 to $29 a pound, the BBQ should be absolutely amazing. The only item I ate that approached amazing would be the Duroc short rib. The Duroc breed of pig is known for its reddish coat, hardiness and propensity to gain muscle quickly but still produce tender meat. The short rib fits that description but the smaller Duroc ribs I was given didn't have the same amount of juiciness. The brisket was tasty as well, but didn't have the glistening, moistness of freshly sliced brisket. The spicy broccoli salad is one of the best sides you can have with BBQ. Below is a break down of my meal, which cost $40 ($39.77) not including beer.1/4 lb Brisket - two slices1/4 lb Ribs - two ribs, on the smaller side1/2 lb Short Ribs - one short ribSmall Broccoli SaladMaybe it's because I can eat me some BBQ, but I didn't get much food for $40. To provide some perspective, Franklin BBQ in Austin, TX (Currently regarded as one of the best in the nation) charges $16 for a pound of ribs. Mighty Quinn's very tasty BBQ charges $23 for an entire rack of ribs. Fette Sau was charging $29 a pound for ribs the day I visited. I was told a single short rib would be around a 1/2 pound, so that's $15 per short rib, a short rib that was half bone. I just don't think Fette Sau's BBQ warrants the prices they are currently charging. A meal here will cost you double, maybe 2.5 times more than what you would pay for some very good BBQ elsewhere. I get the feeling Fette Sau is cashing in on its popularity while it can. I enjoyed the beer they had on tap but the chaos of communal seating, the long wait for food, and the cost made for an average experience. They do have a habit forming BBQ sauce that has some peppery spiciness to it that is very unique.",3.0
"The best thing about this place are the kitchen knife taps. The BBQ is overrated and the drinks are laughably overpriced.They charge $17 for a Manhattan made with Old Overholt. I mean, I love me some Old Overholt, but that's cheap whiskey. Give me a break. I had a $15 drink at another bar made by some mixologist that included a real dried rose in it. At least they put some effort into making it expensive. Like, this drink isn't cheap, but you are drinking a rose. Know what I'm saying? Lastly, the BBQ, although good, is not worth standing in line for. People literally stand in line all night. It just makes me laugh a little bit. Kind of like when New Yorkers' pay $9 for a Tecate. That is the shit beer you only drink on Cinco de Mayo. It's not cool or ironic. It's cheap crap. This place is definitely worth checking out, but it's also definitely overrated.",3.0
"Holy COWCRAP this is the best bbq, hands-down I have ever had. I have wanted to come here for a long time and it's worth it. Brisket melted in my mouth, soft, smoky, tender, crispy on the outside. Ribs were crunchy and tangy, rubbed in a spicy Carolina style, so not too gummy or sweet. I had the vinegar dipping sauce on the side, but you only need a slight dab because the meat tastes way too damn good to slather. Broccoli side was awesome but A LOT. Also tried the beans which were good. A+ best BBQ in ny maybe all of 'Murica.",5.0

My one critique would be to help some of us out with maybe a sign with suggested amounts of food to order for 1-4 people or suggest how much for appetite size.

Pork ribs- was super excited for ribs, but these disappointed. very mediocre. nothing to remember about. Pork belly was definitely memorable. I don't know if i got the fattiest part ever but MAN it was rich. One was more than enough, although I had 1.5. Could barely touch the third without gagging a bit.Typical sauces available.

First off, the line was easily an hour wait, it wasn't that there was that many people, but there was only ONE guy cutting up meat...only one. It started to rain when we were outside waiting so we tried to curl some of the line inside (after waiting out in the rain for 30 mins). A lady came over and told us we had to go back outside. I understand that they need to keep some spaces clear...but seriously? If you have slow service and are making people wait in the rain, at least let people near the door wait inside. This is the point when we contemplated going somewhere else, and I honestly wish we would have. Another 20-30 mins in line we make it to the one guy taking everyones order. We got 1/2 pound of pulled pork, 1/4 pound pork belly, potato salad and baked beans. The food came out to about $30. The pork belly was by far the best, if I had to go back, I would only get the pork belly. The pulled pork was meh, I'm from the south and the quality was not impressive at all. It was a little dry and tough also. I was extremely disapointed in the bbq sauce. What kind of bbq place doesn't have thier own awesome sauce? Your options at Fette Sau were: a vinegar sauce, a spicy saucy, a spicer sauce, and a spicy sauce. One of the sauces tasted so bad I had to spit it out.  The sides were also odd for a bbq joint...german potato salad? It was ok but I definitely didn't finish it. The beans were also edible but nothing special. Overall, I definitely won't be going back here. The food was pretty terrible. The only thing saving this place from a 1 star review is the pork belly.

The pulled pork was a little dry, which is why I'm giving it 4 stars, but I think it might have been an off night. The brisket was DELICIOUS. I'm excited to come back and try the ribs. All the BBQ sauces on the table were perfection. OH also the SIDES. My cousin isn't normally a fan of the cole slaw, but it had a zangy asian twist that was super yummy. Also the brocoli side was to die for. The potato salad was OK. Can't wait for another night at Fette Sau!",4.0
"Amazing BBQ! I've been in the mood for some good bbq for a while now and the gf recommended this place. She hasn't had it either but heard a lot of God things about it. We got the halls pound of pork ribs, quarter pound of brisket, quart pound of pork shoulder, burnt baked beans, and coleslaw. The coleslaw had a smokey taste to it which only made it nothing sorry of fantastic. The beans had beef and pork mixed in which was great too. The meat, though, was the best part. The pork shoulder was good but it was trumped by the succulent brisket and delicious ribs. I definitely recommend trying as much of the menu as you can before leaving. The line want too long as I went at 2 in the afternoon and it was very well worth the wait. The beer selection was decent too. My gf had the two roads and I had their cider. Both complemented the meal nicely. Would I come here again? Without a doubt.",5.0
"Fette Sau should come with a fette blowjob at these prices okay okay, I get that after my Pok Pok review I'm starting to look like a cheap ass, but just so you don't get it twisted I've posted a picture of what I ordered that amounted to 52 money dollars.  I get that quality is always better than quantity, but neither were the case.  In fact, I had to sauce the fuck out of my food just to make it palatable (whereas I'm usually of the assertion that the meat flavour alone should come through).   I'd recommend going to any other smoke house in New York State, but if you're set on going here I strongly advise you bring your ipod and set it to loud so you don't have to hear trust-fund full-tards (not to be confused with half-tards) talk about producing their ""indie films"".",2.0
"I went here today with my fiancé and I ordered a quarter pound of every meat they had. The quality of the food here is very good although the prevailing attitude is unmerited, elitist, and snobby.Let me start with the brisket, it is my all time favorite. Although today, it wasn't too good. It just tasted like charred meat trimmings and the only way I could enjoy them was by slathering them in barbecue sauce.The bacon on the other hand was fantastic although very fatty. Don't get too much of this as it very easily and quickly gets boring. What do they say? Everything in moderation.The sausage was very good and I will definitely get it another time. It's very juicy and has a nice bite to it.The pulled pork was really not anything to ride home about. I don't suggest ordering this.The chop has absolutely no taste and I got my money back for it.Potatoes were very good but the beans were just overkill.The ribs were just very fatty and really quite tasteless. It was disappointing. In summary, the best things here are the brisket (make sure you get it marbled, this assures best taste), the sausage, the bacon which again is quite good in moderation, and the potatoes. Make sure to get a cider with this from the bar, great way to finish off your meal.Going today was really disappointing and they are only good for a handful of things.

"Nice beer list and juicy fatty brisket. Kelso on tap, soft rolls, and brisket sitting at bar late at night in an almost empty place.

"I guess the standard for BBQ isn't very high in Brooklyn. This stuff is OK. The ribs are pretty good, with a nice dry rub. The pork belly and pulled pork were fine, but nearly cold when we got them. Pulled pork was a bit dry too. The BBQ sauces at the tables leave something to be desired in flavor. The baked beans were very, very good. It's very Williamsburg. Communal tables, super industrial shabby decor, and surly servers. The BBQ sits in a deli-like setup and you choose what you want. Prices are very high. Without a drink, my meal was $38 and that was just enough to leave satisfied. The plus: the bartender was a nice guy and they have an excellent Bourbon selection. I'm sure it's a nice place to be in the summer when the ""patio"" is open. (I quote it as patio as it's really more the feel of an abandoned alleyway)For the price, I would not return.",3.0

"This place calls for a beautiful story.US Vs. Portugal, Sunday afternoon, beginning of summer.Our group of friends went to Smorgasburg that morning and stuck around for the World cup game. After the game, we were hungry and decided to find a place with outdoor seating so our 5th furry friend can dine with us. We choose Fette Sau because they had outdoor seating.But it was when we got our food, they kicked us out. No dogs allowed.So we took out 1/3 lb of brisket, 1/3 lb of ribs, and 1/3 lb of pork shoulder, rolls, and baked beans to the Capital One bank parking lot in Williamsburg and ate there. The bbq was perfectly roasted to fall off the bone tenderness. The baked beans were infused with bacon. They had like 2 different kinds of bbq sauce, one sweet and another spicy, and thy were equally delicious. Takes me right back to Smokin' Jacks back in Indiana... It was a beautiful night, with a couple of my favorite people and dog in the world. This is how love is remembered.",4.0
"Quintessential hipster bbq. Delicious food. Horrible hipster set up.The food was delicious, if you are willing to wait for a 1.5 hr - 2 hr line among beared, expensively dressed hobo looking hipsters. The set up is shitty as hell. Tiny ass counter with one person serving bbq and then a huge bar area that would've been better used as additional server locations, but no, hipsters must have their fancy hipster beer and non alcoholic beverages.I came by on a friday night, 1.5 hours... waiting in line outside! So instead, we went down the street for dinner and came back saturday at noon, probably #5 or 6th person in. We ordered 1/4th brisket (around $23 / lbs), 1/4th pulled pork shoulder, and a large order of baked beans. The brisket was nice and moist, the pulled pork was delicious, albiet a bit dry but that was solved by drowning it with bbq sauce. The beans were amazing come in an orgy of beans, sauce, and some type of meat. You also get 2 dinner rolls each, which are good, but seem like they came from the super market around the corner.I would definitely not come back unless it was at opening, stupid line and shitty set up.

"I guess the standard for BBQ isn't very high in Brooklyn. This stuff is OK. The ribs are pretty good, with a nice dry rub. The pork belly and pulled pork were fine, but nearly cold when we got them. Pulled pork was a bit dry too. The BBQ sauces at the tables leave something to be desired in flavor. The baked beans were very, very good. It's very Williamsburg. Communal tables, super industrial shabby decor, and surly servers. The BBQ sits in a deli-like setup and you choose what you want. Prices are very high. Without a drink, my meal was $38 and that was just enough to leave satisfied. The plus: the bartender was a nice guy and they have an excellent Bourbon selection. I'm sure it's a nice place to be in the summer when the ""patio"" is open. (I quote it as patio as it's really more the feel of an abandoned alleyway)For the price, I would not return.",3.0

"This place calls for a beautiful story.US Vs. Portugal, Sunday afternoon, beginning of summer.Our group of friends went to Smorgasburg that morning and stuck around for the World cup game. After the game, we were hungry and decided to find a place with outdoor seating so our 5th furry friend can dine with us. We choose Fette Sau because they had outdoor seating.But it was when we got our food, they kicked us out. No dogs allowed.So we took out 1/3 lb of brisket, 1/3 lb of ribs, and 1/3 lb of pork shoulder, rolls, and baked beans to the Capital One bank parking lot in Williamsburg and ate there. The bbq was perfectly roasted to fall off the bone tenderness. The baked beans were infused with bacon. They had like 2 different kinds of bbq sauce, one sweet and another spicy, and thy were equally delicious. Takes me right back to Smokin' Jacks back in Indiana... It was a beautiful night, with a couple of my favorite people and dog in the world. This is how love is remembered.",4.0
"Quintessential hipster bbq. Delicious food. Horrible hipster set up.The food was delicious, if you are willing to wait for a 1.5 hr - 2 hr line among beared, expensively dressed hobo looking hipsters. The set up is shitty as hell. Tiny ass counter with one person serving bbq and then a huge bar area that would've been better used as additional server locations, but no, hipsters must have their fancy hipster beer and non alcoholic beverages.I came by on a friday night, 1.5 hours... waiting in line outside! So instead, we went down the street for dinner and came back saturday at noon, probably #5 or 6th person in. We ordered 1/4th brisket (around $23 / lbs), 1/4th pulled pork shoulder, and a large order of baked beans. The brisket was nice and moist, the pulled pork was delicious, albiet a bit dry but that was solved by drowning it with bbq sauce. The beans were amazing come in an orgy of beans, sauce, and some type of meat. You also get 2 dinner rolls each, which are good, but seem like they came from the super market around the corner.I would definitely not come back unless it was at opening, stupid line and shitty set up.

"I was slightly disappointed with this place, and i've been wanting to try it ever since Matt Lang was on pitmasters.  It was cool to have him ring me up though. My friend and I got extremely lucky, and did not have to wait too long, 15/20 minutes.  As neither of us had been here, we figured, let's try a lot.  I ordered some pulled pork, some brisket, pork ribs, and burnt ends baked beans.  My friend ordered brisket, beef ribs, pork belly, and also the burnt ends baked beans.  Our first bite was of the baked beans as so many people have already wrote about and raved, and we were pleasantly surprised with it.  Then, it kind of went downhill.  Our briskets didn't match up, which was odd, considering we got first and second cut off a freshly placed hunk of meat.  My brisket was delicious, nice, tender, and juicy, my friends, not so much.  My pulled pork was just lacking, as were my pork ribs, there was a complete lack of meat on them.  The pork belly was pretty good, but the beef rib was incredible.  We could have come up with a 4 star dish, beef rib, my brisket, and the baked beans, but it still would not have got a 5.  It's unfortunate that there were downfalls with some of the food.  And what hurts it even more is it's not cheap, at all.  $30 and $40 respectively.  What is really cool about the place is the atmosphere, setup, and bar/beer selection.  The meat case is right in front of you when you order, everything is cut to order, but the major downside to that is, a lot of the meat doesn't stay warm as there is only one person taking and prepping your order.  I can't imagine what this place is like when it's warmer out and there is a ridiculous line.  You'd order your food, and have to wait forever to get a seat.  Is it worth the try, yeah.  Will I come back anytime soon, unfortunately not.",3.0
"Fitting name as you sure feel like a fat pig after eating here. Legit 'que in Brooklyn NY out of all places. Ever changing menu of the highest quality meats (all pork is Berkshire and they use Heritage beef). Prices are pricey and even though their setting as the feel of a picnic area, this ain't no grilling in your backyard kind of 'que. Berkshire pork spicy sausage links. Hell to the yes. The brisket was smokey, fatty, and meaty. A potato salad sans mayo? Gotta love the Germans for that. But the star here beside the bad ass cleavers and other meaty cutlery as beer taps, yelp.com/user_local_phot…  was the burnt ends baked beans. A large side is $8 but worth it. There were huge, I mean huge chunks of meat in there. All saucy and delicious. All baked beans should be like this.

Definitely a good place to hang with friend or have one of the friends wait online and order while you on the way hehe :DWe were there 30 minutes late and my friends are still on the line for the delicious meat.

I won't thou.The price can set you back a good deal and their menu changes from time to time while the meat gets sold out. Great beer selection and I love their cider.

I also love that they try new things in terms of the side dishes. I actually had brussels sprouts there a few years ago. How many restaurants even try to make that dish???

"over hyped BBQ place. The meat's pretty good but it's just not worth the hour wait. You can see the long line going out to the sidewalk. I came with a large group of friends so we divided the tasks and split into 2 groups, one for waiting in line and ordering and another for finding tables and saving seats. We didn't have to wait as long as the ordering group to get our seats ready so lucky me :) my friends ordered almost everything, we got 3-4 huge plates of BBQ on it and some bread and sides. I couldn't even tell what I was eating after a while except it was some kind of barbequed meat. Some are dry, some are hard to chew on, some are really good. The price came out to be about $30 per person, I thought that was quite expensive since I didn't eat that much. I did enjoy the experience, but I think this is just another one-time thing I can say that I've done it.",3.0

"You know something, I thought I had experienced some pretty good BBQ (in Texas, Butcher Bar), but Fette Sau was right up there (dare I say maybe even better?).Me and some friends were hungry for BBQ and Fette Sau came at the recommendation of one of my friends.For our meal we started with two sides (baked beans & German potato salad) that were pretty pedestrian.  The baked beans tasted like chili and the potato salad had a bit too much vinegar for my tastes.  However, we weren't here for the sides but for the BBQ!We ordered 1 lb. of beef brisket, 1 lb. of ribs, and 1/2 lb. of pork belly.The brisket was greatly layered with flavor from the outer bark to the smoke ring to the juicy beef.  The brisket was Texas BBQ quality.The pork belly was EXCEPTIONAL.  For comparison (unlike Butcher Bar's pork belly), Fette Sau's pork belly is cut in slices like brisket and what you get is a beautiful layered slice just like brisket with a dark outer bark.  I had an end piece of pork belly and the flavor of the bark and awesomely rendered fat was like getting hit by the flavor train; it was that good!The pork ribs were good but after the brisket and pork belly they had a tough act to follow.So good was the brisket and pork belly that after devouring the 2-1/2 lbs. of meat, we all looked at each other and agreed that we wanted (actually more like needed; LOL) some more meat, so we ordered another pound of brisket and another pound of pork belly.Of note were the copious amounts of bread supplied and the three different types of table-side BBQ sauces (original, hot sauce, and an au jus style).  The bread was soft and the texture was perfect for making little BBQ sandwiches with the supplied BBQ sauces and soaking up the excess meat juices.Fette Sau's decor is styled after a traditional southern BBQ restaurant where picnic style benches are provided with some located indoors and some located outside.Try to get there early (they open at 5PM during the week), as there is limited seating, there is a lot of walk-up business, and parking is tough in the area.I'm already getting the hankering for some more Fette Sau pork belly!",5.0
"Came in for dinner on a rainy day, so the dining room was packed.  I loved the idea of walking up to the meat counter to order your meat and having it all served on cafeteria trays.  I also loved sitting on benches, sharing sauces, and everything else.  It almost made me feel that I was at an actual BBQ.The service was great and I loved their beans and BBQ sauces, but I didn't quite care for the meat as I thought I would.  Maybe it's because it was hyped up so much or maybe I came on an off day?  But a lot of my meat tasted like wood, the texture was great, just not the taste and I ended up trying to mask it with their yummy sauces ... and I'm not a fan of pickles being more like cucumbers. =\I am definitely going to be giving this place another try since I refuse to believe that what I had that night was what everyone's been raving about.",3.0
"Try to get there right around at 5pm, otherwise you'll have to wait forever. All the meat selections are great. Probably the best bbq place in the city.

"I came here with a party of 17 on a Tuesday night around 10pm. Since they don't take reservations, we were lucky to snag a whole stretch table. The meat is priced per pound. Because we had such a large group, we shared just about everything. The ribs weren't as tasty and tender as they looked, but they were still good. I really enjoyed the brisket and the potato salad. However, my absolute favorite was the pork belly. As for their bar, they offer a nice variety of dark liquor and beer. The drafts range from half pints to growlers. The pints are served in mason jars. Overall, it was a great dining experience and I would definitely recommend this establishment.",4.0
"I wanted to really like Fetti Sau. I came here on July 3rd. After reading all the great reviews and getting my hopes high, I was disappointed. I came here after the pool, with my daughter and my friend. We ordered the brisket, pulled pork and the german potato salad. Our server seemed as if he had no time for us and barely looked up. After we paid, and sat down I realized I never ordered myself a drink. I walk back and the guy at the register tells me I have to wait to get a drink since hes waiting for the guys that are behind me to finish choosing what they want. I didnt understand what was so hard for him to pass me a coke especially if he wasnt doing anything and i had just finished paying for my food. I ended up grabbing a drink at the bar and sat down. The pulled pork was good but the brisket. Ive had briskets before that do not require putting any sauce on it for it to be good. The brisket barely had flavor and when I used their BBQ sauce, it still didnt help. It felt as if it was missing something. i think i tried all their sauces in the hopes of getting a better taste and still nothing. The other thing was the German potato salad. What a waste of money. It was disgusting! The only reason why Im giving it three stars was because of the pulled pork and my friend enjoyed the beer she had.",3.0
"This barbecue isn't just the best in the city, it's some of the best anywhere I've ever been.  Fette Sau holds its own against many of the famous barbecue stops across the south and midwest.  I highly recommend the brisket and pork shoulder.  I admit that I was at first skeptical of the mixed drinks and barbecue thing they have going (of course there's beer too, and lots of it), but they've swayed my opinion.Very solid!",5.0
"It's been a while since I've last been to Fette Sau, but that place is pure heaven. Remember that scene in Bob's Burger's where Bob thinks he's dead and Moo-Lissa is all like, ""eat my dead body?""I'm pretty sure that if Moo-Lissa were real, we'd be eating her at Fette Sau. I just realized that doesn't sound appetizing. But I swear to you, it is.Especially in the summer time, this place is packed and the line goes out the door. If you come here with a big group of people, be aware that you may not get a seat. It's a great place for groups, but the seating is communal, seat yourself, first come + serve yourself style. So usually, what I've done with friends is someone will walk inside to see if there is an available (hover and stare technique, yo) and/or we'll have someone procure alcohol while we all wait in line. Yeah, there's usually a really long wait. So if you're old like me, don't forget to bring a cane or walker. Also, this place is pricey, so make sure you've already procured the ability to make it rain before you venture to this resto. Either way, for the meat-lovers out there, Fette Sau is definitely an experience you want to try at least once.My recommendations: brisket, pork belly if they have it (menu changes every so often), as well as the beans and the broccoli.xoxo Gossip Girl(Just kidding.

I always bring guests in for a bite and ALWAYS bring myself here when I hit Brooklyn.",5.0
"You know something, I thought I had experienced some pretty good BBQ (in Texas, Butcher Bar), but Fette Sau was right up there (dare I say maybe even better?).Me and some friends were hungry for BBQ and Fette Sau came at the recommendation of one of my friends.For our meal we started with two sides (baked beans & German potato salad) that were pretty pedestrian.  The baked beans tasted like chili and the potato salad had a bit too much vinegar for my tastes.  However, we weren't here for the sides but for the BBQ!We ordered 1 lb. of beef brisket, 1 lb. of ribs, and 1/2 lb. of pork belly.The brisket was greatly layered with flavor from the outer bark to the smoke ring to the juicy beef.  The brisket was Texas BBQ quality.The pork belly was EXCEPTIONAL.  For comparison (unlike Butcher Bar's pork belly), Fette Sau's pork belly is cut in slices like brisket and what you get is a beautiful layered slice just like brisket with a dark outer bark.  I had an end piece of pork belly and the flavor of the bark and awesomely rendered fat was like getting hit by the flavor train; it was that good!The pork ribs were good but after the brisket and pork belly they had a tough act to follow.So good was the brisket and pork belly that after devouring the 2-1/2 lbs. of meat, we all looked at each other and agreed that we wanted (actually more like needed; LOL) some more meat, so we ordered another pound of brisket and another pound of pork belly.Of note were the copious amounts of bread supplied and the three different types of table-side BBQ sauces (original, hot sauce, and an au jus style).  The bread was soft and the texture was perfect for making little BBQ sandwiches with the supplied BBQ sauces and soaking up the excess meat juices.Fette Sau's decor is styled after a traditional southern BBQ restaurant where picnic style benches are provided with some located indoors and some located outside.Try to get there early (they open at 5PM during the week), as there is limited seating, there is a lot of walk-up business, and parking is tough in the area.I'm already getting the hankering for some more Fette Sau pork belly!",5.0
"Came in for dinner on a rainy day, so the dining room was packed.  I loved the idea of walking up to the meat counter to order your meat and having it all served on cafeteria trays.  I also loved sitting on benches, sharing sauces, and everything else.  It almost made me feel that I was at an actual BBQ.The service was great and I loved their beans and BBQ sauces, but I didn't quite care for the meat as I thought I would.  Maybe it's because it was hyped up so much or maybe I came on an off day?  But a lot of my meat tasted like wood, the texture was great, just not the taste and I ended up trying to mask it with their yummy sauces ... and I'm not a fan of pickles being more like cucumbers. =\I am definitely going to be giving this place another try since I refuse to believe that what I had that night was what everyone's been raving about.",3.0
"Try to get there right around at 5pm, otherwise you'll have to wait forever. All the meat selections are great. Probably the best bbq place in the city. I've traveled to NC and ate so much authentic bbq this summer, and my conclusion was ""Fette Sau is not bad at all - in fact, they do certain things better than they do in the South.""Okay, I get the brisket hype, but my favorites are sirloin and ribs.Don't miss out the poultry selections either.On a side note - THEY MAKE THE BEST PICKES.",4.0

"I came here with a party of 17 on a Tuesday night around 10pm. Since they don't take reservations, we were lucky to snag a whole stretch table. The meat is priced per pound. Because we had such a large group, we shared just about everything. The ribs weren't as tasty and tender as they looked, but they were still good. I really enjoyed the brisket and the potato salad. However, my absolute favorite was the pork belly. As for their bar, they offer a nice variety of dark liquor and beer. The drafts range from half pints to growlers. The pints are served in mason jars. Overall, it was a great dining experience and I would definitely recommend this establishment.",4.0
"I wanted to really like Fetti Sau. I came here on July 3rd. After reading all the great reviews and getting my hopes high, I was disappointed. I came here after the pool, with my daughter and my friend. We ordered the brisket, pulled pork and the german potato salad. Our server seemed as if he had no time for us and barely looked up. After we paid, and sat down I realized I never ordered myself a drink. I walk back and the guy at the register tells me I have to wait to get a drink since hes waiting for the guys that are behind me to finish choosing what they want. I didnt understand what was so hard for him to pass me a coke especially if he wasnt doing anything and i had just finished paying for my food. I ended up grabbing a drink at the bar and sat down. The pulled pork was good but the brisket. Ive had briskets before that do not require putting any sauce on it for it to be good. The brisket barely had flavor and when I used their BBQ sauce, it still didnt help. It felt as if it was missing something. i think i tried all their sauces in the hopes of getting a better taste and still nothing. The other thing was the German potato salad. What a waste of money. It was disgusting! The only reason why Im giving it three stars was because of the pulled pork and my friend enjoyed the beer she had.",3.0
"This barbecue isn't just the best in the city, it's some of the best anywhere I've ever been.  Fette Sau holds its own against many of the famous barbecue stops across the south and midwest.  I highly recommend the brisket and pork shoulder.  I admit that I was at first skeptical of the mixed drinks and barbecue thing they have going (of course there's beer too, and lots of it), but they've swayed my opinion.Very solid!",5.0
"It's been a while since I've last been to Fette Sau, but that place is pure heaven. Remember that scene in Bob's Burger's where Bob thinks he's dead and Moo-Lissa is all like, ""eat my dead body?""I'm pretty sure that if Moo-Lissa were real, we'd be eating her at Fette Sau. I just realized that doesn't sound appetizing. But I swear to you, it is.Especially in the summer time, this place is packed and the line goes out the door. If you come here with a big group of people, be aware that you may not get a seat. It's a great place for groups, but the seating is communal, seat yourself, first come + serve yourself style. So usually, what I've done with friends is someone will walk inside to see if there is an available (hover and stare technique, yo) and/or we'll have someone procure alcohol while we all wait in line. Yeah, there's usually a really long wait. So if you're old like me, don't forget to bring a cane or walker. Also, this place is pricey, so make sure you've already procured the ability to make it rain before you venture to this resto. Either way, for the meat-lovers out there, Fette Sau is definitely an experience you want to try at least once.My recommendations: brisket, pork belly if they have it (menu changes every so often), as well as the beans and the broccoli.xoxo Gossip Girl(Just kidding. You know Gossip Girl hates Brooklyn. And meat. And probably eating.)",4.0

We grabbed a table and send some people on line. At this point the line was only just by the awning about 4ft from the Garage door. I would say it was about 40-50 ft from the actual ordering counter. We were on line for an hour, an HOUR!The BBQ is DELICIOUS but a bit on the dry side in terms of cooking and sauce. We ordered a little of everything.

A tip is for wait service; you have to do something, not just hand me my plate. Then, when I DO tip, you could at least say ""thank  you."" I'm rating Fette Sau highly for the food, but be aware that, even though you the customer get your own table, wait in 2 lines for your meal, then dispose of your own trash, you'll be expected to pay a little extra because - well, I don't know why.

The pulled pork shoulder, the pork belly, the pork ribs, the beef short ribs, everything is just wonderfully tender, deliciously seasoned and perfect (except maybe the brisket, which I've never loved, but real BBQ is pork anyways...). Moving past the meat, their burnt ends baked beans are absolutely out of this world. Also recommended is the potato salad, which is more of a German style without all the mayo--again, not very faithful to how they do it in the South, but it's wonderful. Pair this all with a fresh craft beer from their bar, and maybe a drink from their excellent whiskey selection before or after your meal, and you've got yourself a perfect summer evening (which will probably end there because you'll be too stuffed to do anything else).",5.0

"The name of the game here is ""upsell.""The boy decided to repark his car over in Williamsburg to avoid having to move it before driving up to Boston. We found a parking spot near the L stop, and I realized that Fette Sau was a few blocks over. Banking on the horrifically heavy snowfall to curb other diners from going, we veritably skied our way into this meatery.We started off by ordering a quarter pound each of brisket and pork belly, along with large sides of beans 'n' burnt ends, potato salad, and slaw. Eyeing the key lime tart on the dessert menu, I requested one of those for good measure. Clearly, that wasn't going to be enough food, because the gent manning the till informed us that we definitely needed to double our meat. Really? So I added another quarter pound of pork shoulder on top of all that. According to him, that still wasn't enough. Now, this is getting silly. So we make it a third pound of each meat.Even with wintry mix coming down sideways, it was a full house up in this piece. It turns out that the renown of Fette Sau is enough that starving carnivores are willing to brave broken legs and frostbite to dine here. I think we managed to grab the last two seats next to one another on an otherwise packed bench and dove into our grub.Oh. And about the food... I think it goes without saying that we consumed far in excess of what we should have. The sides absolutely blew the meat out of the water. The beans and burnt ends alone would have been enough to constitute a meal.

"Although I believe Korean BBQ is the best form of BBQ-ing in the entire universe, I just had to try Fette Sau to experience American BBQ that I've never really had chance to experience. My friend and I got there about 15 minutes before they opened and we were glad we did since it got busy and a huge ass line started to form behind us. Interior is a mix of Southern, Texas, Ranch, and sort of Hipster vibe. It's a pretty simple system. You walk in and try to secure a table on your own ( NO wait service here!! Sort of like Cafeteria style system!), get in line, and order what you want from the guy behind the food counter, and then pay at the cash register. I like variety so I got a little bit of everything along with a Broccoli Salad and their Mac N Cheese. Make sure you get the 1/4 or smallest portion if you want to try it all since it's A LOT of food!!!!I got the following:Black Angus Beef BrisketSpicy Berkshire Pork SausageDuroc Pulled Pork ShoulderDuroc Pork BellyVintage Beef Short RibDurox Pork RibsI liked everything except the shoulder and the sausage. Shoulder seemed a bit dry for my liking and the sausage wasn't anything I haven't tried before (Sorry but Argentine Chorizo Sausage is still MUCH superior) However, other cuts of meat definitely hit the spot especially the ribs, brisket, and the Pork Belly was so tender and literally 'fall off the bones"". Since I'm a meat-eating carnivore, it was only a matter of time I devoured everything only in a good 15 minutes along with surprisingly refreshing Broccoli Salad and delicious Mac N Cheese. I also got the Manhattan Special Soda. They only had one flavor that day: Gassosa, which was basically Lemon-Lime soda that tasted similar to Sprite. Bill totalled $50.67 which might seem expensive but for the variety and the amount of food we got, it was worth it.Service is decent and cool (definitely not the bubbly over-friendly shit). It can be a bit slow since there is only one guy cutting the meats and putting them onto the tray, etc. After you pay for your item, bring the tray to your table, take your time to enjoy your food (they don't rush you here), and just leave your tray(s) onto one side of the table and one of their staff will pick it up.**TIP**If you have leftovers or cannot finish your food and want to take it home, go up to the cash register, ask for aluminum foil and a plastic bag, and the guy behind the counter will gladly offer you some. I saw many people doing that as well. I took my leftover home and the morning after (today!!) I just made myself an early BBQ Meat Sandwich with some Swiss and Havarti Cheese melted on top which saved me on lunch money!! lolWould definitely return to introduce others to American BBQ but for me, it was good as a one-time experience.",4.0
"Even if barbeque is not your thing, Fette Sau might change your mind. No frills bbq joint offering up some of the best in the business making it worth your while to head off the rock into the lowlands of Brooklyn. If it's nice, the picnic tables outside, communal style, are the place to sit, otherwise the bar inside will suffice. Order beer by the jug, it's super excellent.Dark, gritty and perpetually busy, get in line and point to what you want. Sold by the pound means you can try everything.Sampled the pork belly, brisket and Spare ribs. Belly is no joke. This incredibly tender and crisp morsel of meat packs smokiness and spice into one bite. Ribs were surprising: looking rather thin and smallish, they came in as good as can be tasted anywhere. Incredible smoky pink meat, crisp layer on top of firm yet fatty pork. Do not let appearances deceive you: these bad boys are the real deal. Brisket is sliced thick and ranks as possibly the most buttery and fork ""cuttable"" yest tasted. Nice flaky meat with layer of fat and infusion of spicy rub. Absolutely incredible considering how dry brisket can become. Coleslaw was obviously fresh. Make the trek, you will not regret going.",5.0

So get yourself a beer and prepare to stand awhile in line at peak dining hours.The best thing to do is to come at an odd hour to avoid the wait. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the bbq is inconsistent. Once the ribs were just okay but yesterday when I went they were absolutely amazing. Previously the pork belly was amazing and yesterday just so so. However, the broccoli and potato salad sides are always delicious! But all in all its worth the trip for some really good bbq in Brooklyn.",4.0
"Definitely not worth the wait and if you're a sworn Manhattanite, you could just head over to Mighty Quinn's in East Village to get the same cuts of meat for cheaper.  Also, Mighty Quinn's gives you a few free sides, while Fette Sau is generous with the appetizer portions, they're not complimentary. The wait on a Friday night around 8 pm was around 1 hour.  They have a small glass case of meats for you to choose from.  Some are seasonal and only offered certain times depending on the market. We ordered 3 different cuts of meat - the short rib, pork belly, and brisket - and a side of broccoli salad (pretty delicious).Pork Belly:  can't remember anything about this cut of meat being particularly special, if not particularly especially dry. (Mighty Quinn's wins)Brisket: the brisket was particularly dry and unseasoned.  Not sure if this was just because I got a bad cut of the meat, but 4 of my friends also agreed to this point.  Nothing special here. (Mighty Quinn's wins)Short Ribs: WOW. Crazy amazing.  I loved how tender this was and was genuinely surprised at how delicious that was given that the other items were less than subpar.  The meat was tender and really well-seasoned.  (Fette Sau wins)Overall, I'd say skip this place unless you're willing to shovel over the cash for the short ribs at $29.50 a pound.",2.0

Once you finally reach the counter that displays the slabs of meat, be sure to order: a quarter pound of pork belly, a half pound of boneless beef ribs, a quarter pound of brisket, a spicy sausage, a side of beans, and a pint of their house beer served in adorable Mason jars.

"Great BBQ joint in Williamsburg. All meats smoked in-house and they make their own dry rub. We got pork belly and beef brisket along with some baked beans and pickles. Food is real good although a bit greasy. I know, I'm already throwing caloric caution to the wind when I'm eating BBQ anyways but the grease left on my plate after eating the pork and beef was a bit startling. Even so, this ""Fat Pig"" BBQ joint is still good for the gluttons like myself. Baked beans were also delish. People are friendly too. We asked for 3 lbs of pork and beef and they originally only gave 1.5 lbs. However, the cashier caught the mistake when the total price came up. Quick thinking on their part and good for us since we were taking it to go for a get together.",3.0
"I've been here twice now, but it is my only NY bbq experience so far, so I'm sure I'm probably biased, but this place is amazing. I could eat the pulled pork, beef ribs, potato salad, and baked beans all day long. The pork belly is also phenomenal, but I can do without the brisket, though my boyfriend loves it. Also, the dinner rolls are delish.The atmosphere is really fun - picnic tables and outdoor seating really up the barbecue vibe. If your'e going on a weekend, be prepared to wait. A few weeks ago, we waited on line for an hour. It was totally worth it, but if waiting isn't your thing, you might want to do a different day.My only gripe is that if you want to take your leftovers home, you have to wrap it up yourself with square foil sheets, and somehow make that work. Takeout boxes would make things much easier, but I can live without them.",5.0
"I'd rather say 3.5 but if I have to choose between 3 and 4, then it will be 3. I wouldn't argue with quality of meat, could feel that they are indeed using good quality of meat.

It is BBQ and people expect meat heated from strong fire or very hot oven when they are eating BBQ yet foods here were warm? may be closed to ""cold"". It became cold while we were eating which was very disturbing especially for meat lover like me. It  They had good side dishes, such as bean, potato salad and broccoli salad.

Shoulder seemed a bit dry for my liking and the sausage wasn't anything I haven't tried before (Sorry but Argentine Chorizo Sausage is still MUCH superior) However, other cuts of meat definitely hit the spot especially the ribs, brisket, and the Pork Belly was so tender and literally 'fall off the bones"". Since I'm a meat-eating carnivore, it was only a matter of time I devoured everything only in a good 15 minutes along with surprisingly refreshing Broccoli Salad and delicious Mac N Cheese. I also got the Manhattan Special Soda. They only had one flavor that day: Gassosa, which was basically Lemon-Lime soda that tasted similar to Sprite. Bill totalled $50.67 which might seem expensive but for the variety and the amount of food we got, it was worth it.Service is decent and cool (definitely not the bubbly over-friendly shit). It can be a bit slow since there is only one guy cutting the meats and putting them onto the tray, etc. After you pay for your item, bring the tray to your table, take your time to enjoy your food (they don't rush you here), and just leave your tray(s) onto one side of the table and one of their staff will pick it up.**TIP**If you have leftovers or cannot finish your food and want to take it home, go up to the cash register, ask for aluminum foil and a plastic bag, and the guy behind the counter will gladly offer you some. I saw many people doing that as well. I took my leftover home and the morning after (today!!) I just made myself an early BBQ Meat Sandwich with some Swiss and Havarti Cheese melted on top which saved me on lunch money!! lolWould definitely return to introduce others to American BBQ but for me, it was good as a one-time experience.",4.0
"Even if barbeque is not your thing, Fette Sau might change your mind. No frills bbq joint offering up some of the best in the business making it worth your while to head off the rock into the lowlands of Brooklyn. If it's nice, the picnic tables outside, communal style, are the place to sit, otherwise the bar inside will suffice. Order beer by the jug, it's super excellent.Dark, gritty and perpetually busy, get in line and point to what you want. Sold by the pound means you can try everything.Sampled the pork belly, brisket and Spare ribs. Belly is no joke. This incredibly tender and crisp morsel of meat packs smokiness and spice into one bite. Ribs were surprising: looking rather thin and smallish, they came in as good as can be tasted anywhere. Incredible smoky pink meat, crisp layer on top of firm yet fatty pork. Do not let appearances deceive you: these bad boys are the real deal. Brisket is sliced thick and ranks as possibly the most buttery and fork ""cuttable"" yest tasted. Nice flaky meat with layer of fat and infusion of spicy rub. Absolutely incredible considering how dry brisket can become. Coleslaw was obviously fresh. Make the trek, you will not regret going.",5.0
"It was my first time going here after searching around what to eat, and I have to say this place is a gem. I love their meats, specially the brisket and the ribs, and the corn.. Omgg! Best corn I ever had on my entire life. The atmosphere here is really cool, its a really nice place to come and hang out with friends and have a beer while having their amazing food.",4.0
"Charred, spiced cuts of meat that make your mouth water, served in a quaint, wooden Brooklynesque bar/concrete picnic joint. Both instances picking up takeout have resulted in attitude though, hence 4 stars.",4.0
"I felt it's my duty to write a review for Fette Sau considering how often I frequent this place. I really enjoy the food here and my bf is obsessed with the pork belly. Its pay by the pound and the lines can get very long and it moves slowly. So get yourself a beer and prepare to stand awhile in line at peak dining hours.The best thing to do is to come at an odd hour to avoid the wait. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the bbq is inconsistent. Once the ribs were just okay but yesterday when I went they were absolutely amazing. Previously the pork belly was amazing and yesterday just so so. However, the broccoli and potato salad sides are always delicious! But all in all its worth the trip for some really good bbq in Brooklyn.",4.0
"Definitely not worth the wait and if you're a sworn Manhattanite, you could just head over to Mighty Quinn's in East Village to get the same cuts of meat for cheaper.  Also, Mighty Quinn's gives you a few free sides, while Fette Sau is generous with the appetizer portions, they're not complimentary. The wait on a Friday night around 8 pm was around 1 hour.  They have a small glass case of meats for you to choose from.  Some are seasonal and only offered certain times depending on the market. We ordered 3 different cuts of meat - the short rib, pork belly, and brisket - and a side of broccoli salad (pretty delicious).Pork Belly:  can't remember anything about this cut of meat being particularly special, if not particularly especially dry. (Mighty Quinn's wins)Brisket: the brisket was particularly dry and unseasoned.  Not sure if this was just because I got a bad cut of the meat, but 4 of my friends also agreed to this point.  Nothing special here. (Mighty Quinn's wins)Short Ribs: WOW. Crazy amazing.  I loved how tender this was and was genuinely surprised at how delicious that was given that the other items were less than subpar.  The meat was tender and really well-seasoned.  (Fette Sau wins)Overall, I'd say skip this place unless you're willing to shovel over the cash for the short ribs at $29.50 a pound.",2.0
"The gates of meat heaven is embellished with a pink neon sign that says ""Fette Sau."" As you wait on the half hour line, you will be tantalized by the pungent scent of the BBQ meat that drifts out from the doorway of this garage-turned-into-sit-down-eatery. Cue the stomach growl. Once you finally reach the counter that displays the slabs of meat, be sure to order: a quarter pound of pork belly, a half pound of boneless beef ribs, a quarter pound of brisket, a spicy sausage, a side of beans, and a pint of their house beer served in adorable Mason jars. Cue the mouthgasm. What this place lacks is a bed to catch you right when the ultimate food coma smacks you in the face after your last bite of their tender, juicy brisket.",5.0
"Great BBQ joint in Williamsburg. All meats smoked in-house and they make their own dry rub. We got pork belly and beef brisket along with some baked beans and pickles. Food is real good although a bit greasy. I know, I'm already throwing caloric caution to the wind when I'm eating BBQ anyways but the grease left on my plate after eating the pork and beef was a bit startling. Even so, this ""Fat Pig"" BBQ joint is still good for the gluttons like myself. Baked beans were also delish. People are friendly too. We asked for 3 lbs of pork and beef and they originally only gave 1.5 lbs. However, the cashier caught the mistake when the total price came up. Quick thinking on their part and good for us since we were taking it to go for a get together.",3.0
"I've been here twice now, but it is my only NY bbq experience so far, so I'm sure I'm probably biased, but this place is amazing. I could eat the pulled pork, beef ribs, potato salad, and baked beans all day long. The pork belly is also phenomenal, but I can do without the brisket, though my boyfriend loves it. Also, the dinner rolls are delish.The atmosphere is really fun - picnic tables and outdoor seating really up the barbecue vibe. If your'e going on a weekend, be prepared to wait. A few weeks ago, we waited on line for an hour. It was totally worth it, but if waiting isn't your thing, you might want to do a different day.My only gripe is that if you want to take your leftovers home, you have to wrap it up yourself with square foil sheets, and somehow make that work. Takeout boxes would make things much easier, but I can live without them.",5.0
"I'd rather say 3.5 but if I have to choose between 3 and 4, then it will be 3. I wouldn't argue with quality of meat, could feel that they are indeed using good quality of meat. We had Berkshire belly, Sausage, rips and boneless rips. They were good but not amazing. Perhaps reason makes those not amazing would be condition of food. It is BBQ and people expect meat heated from strong fire or very hot oven when they are eating BBQ yet foods here were warm? may be closed to ""cold"". It became cold while we were eating which was very disturbing especially for meat lover like me. It  They had good side dishes, such as bean, potato salad and broccoli salad. Nice environment; easy to go to grab beer, will visit again next time.",3.0

"I meet lots of visitors from out of town, and they usually ask me about my favorite restaurants. I usually send them here. I've been to a few BBQ places in the city(Mables, Dallas BBQ, Rub(RIP)), in West Virginia, and in Austin Texas(The Salt Lick), and this beats all of them, easily. I haven't gone to Dinosaur or Mighty Quinn's yet, but they are on my list.From what I've heard, all the meat is fresh from within 100 mile range, and dry rubbed and aged on premises. And it is the most succulent, mouth watering meatsperience around. Everything is amazing. I love the pork belly, the brisket, and the cheek the most. Somehow, the sausage is just okay. I think it needs more kick, for my taste.If you have any vegan friends, I hope they really like pickles and Broccolli, but rest assured, they are damned fine pickles and broccoli. Though I will usually reserve any side-space I might have for the pork and beans. They do NOT skimp on the pork, like Van Camp's! Did I even need to go there?Late night they have pulled pork sandwiches only, but totally go if you're hungry and drunk. You'll be a happy drunk for sure.I've never had a problem with the line, and I've been here 20 times. At most, I've waited 15 minutes. Perhaps I don't usually go during peak time, but it's never a hassle if you're laid back, and not some jerk always in a hurry.Somehow I have failed to partake of their whiskey flight selection, though they do appear to have a fine one! I do, however, thoroughly enjoy their beer system, which consists of volumes of tap beer up to one gallon, with however many rustic styled mason jars you need to share. I personally go for the Captain Lawrence Liquid Gold, which somehow far surpasses the same in a bottle.

"My God. The wait and crowd here makes me want to pull my hair and eyes out. This place is a garage (Literally. It still has the garage door.) that barely has enough hard cafeteria tables to sit a classroom of 5th graders, let alone the line of people waiting to place their order. I can't tell if the line is a reflection of their popularity, or a reflection of the sheer inefficiency of the staff. First of all, there are two separate lines for drinks and food. Once you're done ordering and carrying your enormous tray of meat (it comes on a piece of wax paper on top of a steel stray), you'll have to teeter your way over to the bar to get drinks. My friend had the grand idea of bringing her group of 10+ friends to Fette for her birthday, and it took us a while to stake out enough space for all of us. Naturally, we ordered a lot of food and drinks. And naturally, we took a bit of time to get through all that we ordered. It wasn't long before a blonde hipster chick comes sneering to us that she is sitting next to us and she has no space for her boyfriend, and that we have to (a) finish up or (b) sit on each other's lap to accommodate for her boyfriend, who must clearly be 500 lbs if he can't squeeze in at the end of the table. We responded by ignoring her and mentally vowing to throw one of Fette Sau's storebought hamburger rolls at her face. Seriously, everybody is cranky that they're being forced to eat meat in a garage so let's all be friends and accept the fact that there's NO SPACE IN THIS PLACE.But onto the food...Most of the stuff here is dry-rub, so don't expect any savory glazes on any of these meats. The tables come with 2 BBQ sauces -- one sweet, one spicy. The pulled shoulder was oily and kind of tasteless without the aid of the aforementioned BBQ sauces. The pork ribs were also dry and tasteless.The sausage was tough.The beef items were a lot better -- I thought the brisket was great. It was juicy and the rub was savory and spicy. The house cured pastrami, was a little chewy and gummy, but the taste was there. The sides are an abomination of all BBQ places. The potato salad was ultra cold and way too vinegary. So was the broccoli salad (really? I came here to eat meat...not raw broccoli doused in more vinegar). The cherry on top was that there was NO MAC AND CHEESE. The only saving grace of the sides we ordered were the beans -- more like a chili than beans, and quite possibly one of most flavorful parts of my meal.Better options are Dino BBQ and Hill Country.",2.0
"It really is quite possibly the best BBQ in NYC. The brisket is other worldly and I'm not usually a brisket person. But it is so good. Nice crispy outside and juicy inside. Pulled pork and ribs were also great. About 4 different BBQ sauces on the table, which is the only thing missing from Delaney BBQ / BrisketTown, whose meats are equally amazing. Great, reasonably priced beer selection, and they have cider! You can even share a growler amongst friends.My only complaint is that the communal seating scenario is super annoying. Stuck up hipsters trying to steal seats even though they came in after you. They should have someone seating people in order that they came. That's the only reason I haven't been back yet - you really have to feel up to dealing with these people.",5.0
"The BBQ is great here, but the lack of a line and the communal seating is a complete fail. In the super aggressive, type A populated metropolis of NYC, getting a seat at Fette Sau can be a nightmare. If only Fette Sau added a rope or something to seal off the line, then the seat stealing and line cutting could be avoided. We were lucky that we came on a less busy night and were able to get a seat without too much trouble, but I was getting grumpy and stressed while we were waiting for a seat. We waited our turn and were first in line, then a few people entered the restaurant and pounced on a table that we were waiting for. We let one lady slide, but the next one we calmly explained that we had been waiting. I wonder how many fights have broken out over seating at this place?Now that we have thoroughly exhausted the subject of the seating, let's move on to the more important part: the food. We had cheek, brisket, pork belly and pulled pork. The most flavorful was the cheek, but my favorite was the brisket because it was so tender. For our sides we had baked beans, potato salad and sauerkraut. The baked beans were the best side by a mile. All in all the bbq was top notch and would warrant a 4 star. I gave the subtracted one star due to the line situation so Fette Sau is a solid 3 star. If you live in Williamsburg there is no excuse not to visit this place, but if you're in Manhattan I'd only make the trek if you have a lot of time to kill.",3.0
"LOVED this BBQ joint. Had the pleasure of being introduced to Fette by a die hard fan, one who has been coming here for years. The trend appeal and line for your meal is definitely warranted and worth while. This is the kind of place where you order your type(s) of meat, they lay it out on parchment paper on a tray, along with whatever sides you want to add on, and you enjoy it with throngs of fellow meat lovers seated next to one another at one of the 3 long bench style tables. Can't be shy about getting your hands or face dirty here.When we arrived, the place was full, no open tables, and a line about 20 people deep. However you can grab a beer (or whiskey) from the super cool bar, with super yummy brews, and down one or two while waiting for your grub and a table to open up. And by the time food was ordered and served, lo and behold a spot became open. And a feast ensued.Food - excellent. Tried just about every meat on the menu, and each was amazing. Don't skimp on the bacon, it was perfect. Pickles are phenomenal as well. My preferred method of consumption here: pile a bunch of each variety of BBQ on the buns provided, add some bacon and sauce, and you've got yourself a truly delicious carnivorous experience.",5.0
There are no adjectives that can possible do this place justice. Went here with my boyfriend and some friends and everything was beyond perfect. I was a little apprehensive about the group seating ( it's long tables used by all rather than smaller personal ones) but I quickly got over that with my first bite. The brisket is perfection as is the ribs. Moist and tender. It melts on your tongue. There are a variety of sauces on the table to choose from. The vinegar is AMAZING and the habanero is a kick in the tastebuds. The cider they offer is delicious. A little smoother than Angry Orchard. Trying to find parking is a holy nightmare but quickly forgotten once you walk through the door and smell the magnificent aroma of perfectly prepared pig. Def returning!!!!,5.0
"I didn't have lunch when I came here for dinner.  I kinda wish I did only because I think it shrunk a bit, my stomach wasn't ready for the amount if meat that was about to go inside it.  I had to abandon the potato salad and baked beans I ordered because I though 1lbs of stuff wasn't a lot... I was and sadness in my eye for abandoning those sides. 1 lbs of meat is a lot.... At least I finished all of the meat.",5.0

So i always order 1/4lbs of every meat, but this time i was a bit hungry so we got 1/2lbs of the smoked brisket 1/2lbs of the smoked pork belly, 2 smoked hot links and a large side of beans with burnt ends brisket.

"Fette Sau is part restaurant, part sensory experience.  Part of the fun of this place is that it's at ground zero of planet hipster.  As you wander the adjoining streets,  you see legions of bearded hipsters in skinny legged jeans, flannel shirts, plastic framed glasses and fedoras, blissfully conforming to their non-conformity.  It feels like you're on a National Geographic Expedition.Anyway, on to the restaurant itself.  It's a hipster interpreted barbecue place.  You order, cafeteria style, get your stuff and sit at communal tables.  We got there just before it became really crowded and sat at the bar, which I recommend.  The vibe is hipster heaven.  The barbecue is excellent- among the best that I have ever had.  The ribs, brisket and lamb were perfect.  Flavorful, smoky and served unsauced.  There was one of the best add on smoky/spicy barbecue sauces that I have ever tried- I'm not a big fan of the cloyingly sweet sauces indiscriminately splashed on barbecue.  There was a large selection of good, obscure (probably curated) beers, sodas and liquors.  The meat was served with some squishy parker house type rolls, good for making impromptu brisket mini sandwiches.  I smelled like smoked meat for the rest of the day.The side dishes are different, but good.  The potato salad is mustardy and vinegary.  The broccoli salad is good, but different from typical barbecue fare.  I missed having mac and cheese, collard greens and corn bread.  I was happy enough with the substitutes.My main problem with the restaurant is that I'm not patient enough to wait on a long line to be served and then have  a problem finding somewhere to sit comfortably.  I know that this goes with the territory with a restaurant of this type, but it's still a negative for me.

Beware if you don't know what you want people will snicker at you (read folks the chalkboard menu before to get to the front of the line).Food (3.5/5)Short ribs (4/5) I thought this was delicious, unfortunately with the bone it is heavy so you don't get much meat by weight when you order by the pound.  Let me caveat by saying I like fattier meats...this is fatty.Spicy sausage (3/5) NOT spicy but good.  On the fattier side.Pulled pork (2/5) dry and not goodSpicy BBQ sauce was yummy and I put it on everything.Tip:  have a member of your party sit while others order to guarantee you a seat.",3.0

Beware if you don't know what you want people will snicker at you (read folks the chalkboard menu before to get to the front of the line).Food (3.5/5)Short ribs (4/5) I thought this was delicious, unfortunately with the bone it is heavy so you don't get much meat by weight when you order by the pound.  Let me caveat by saying I like fattier meats...this is fatty.Spicy sausage (3/5) NOT spicy but good.  On the fattier side.Pulled pork (2/5) dry and not goodSpicy BBQ sauce was yummy and I put it on everything.Tip:  have a member of your party sit while others order to guarantee you a seat.",3.0
"This is one of the best finds I have ever had on Yelp so shout out to all the Yelpers for referring me here (ate here March 1st, 2014).  The place is inconspicuous and is basically down an alley.  You walk past come picnic tables and see a line out the door BUT you definitely should not let that deter you.Once you get inside and see the menu its pretty basic but that's OK.  Pulled pork, beef brisket, short ribs, pork ribs, spicy sausage, the staples meats.  German potato salad, broccoli salad, house made pickles, house potato chips, and burnt ends baked beans are some of the awesome sides.You get you meal from a guy behind a deli meat counter by telling him what quantity you want by the pound.  All prices listed for the meats are by pound and the smallest you can go is .25 pounds.  The guy behind the counter pulls out what you want, cuts the quantity you want, puts it on a tray, and gives it to a cashier.  Sides are ordered small or large.They also have a stocked bar and options to eat inside and out with a garage door they can open during warmer weather.I ordered .25 pounds of pulled pork, 2 short ribs, a small broccoli salad, a small baked beans, and small pickles (2).  My bill was $25.It was ABSOLUTELY worth the 25 minute wait in line and had I not been on time constraints I may have gone back for more.Highly recommend.  Would go back.",5.0
"Pretty decent barbecue. Nothing really blew my mind, but it was still quite well done. Walking in, it's a communal bench setting. Getting a seat can be hard when it's cold as no one really wants to sit outside.While my friend waited on line for food, I ordered a Sixpoint Signal. I highly recommend this beer. Between the two of us, we had 1/2 lb. of pork belly and brisket. It came with 4 free rolls, but I would order an order an extra per person. The brisket was a bit dry, though the dried burnt parts with the rub or fatty parts was fantastic.The pork belly was better. It was seriously good pork as eating all that fat was delicious.The sauces were decent. A vinegar. The horseradish was overpowering and I found inedible. I would mix the sweet BBQ sauce and the spicy chipotle sauce for a balanced sauce.",3.0
"I could see how Fette Sau won the crown of Best BBQ in NYC.... before Mighty Quinn's opened up. We traveled out to Brooklyn to try this reigning champion. I did love how casual the place felt.

We pretty much got a sampling of everything: the pork spare ribs were the standout, followed by the bacon. The brisket was a-OK, but outshined by Mighty Quinn's in that department. The cornish hen was slathered with some sort of interesting glaze, and the sausage, well it tasted like sausage. I will say that all of the sides were a disappointment though: baked beans, sauerkraut, pickles. At 1pm on a Sunday, there was surprisingly zero wait and we nabbed tables right away. Fast forward 30 minutes and there's a line going out the door.

"I love BBQ and when I saw how highly rated Fette Sau was on Yelp, I had to go there. I'm not sure how this place got such a high rating with dry and tasteless BBQ.... My boyfriend and I spent $70 worth of BBQ and sides and we unfortunately couldn't even eat half of our meal and didn't even want to take it home with us. Here is what we got:1. Brisket - SUPER DRY. It was probably sitting under the heating lamp way too long but the brisket was not good at all. I expect delicious moist beef brisket but instead received a dry and tough piece of meat. The worst brisket I ever had. Hill Country and MIghty Quinns' beef brisket is far more superior. 2. Spare Ribs (Pork) - It was ok. If it wasn't so dry, it would have been better. Again, another meat that was sitting under the head lamp for way too long..... Briskettown/Delaney's spare ribs are OUT OF THIS WORLD. It's really had to find any ribs good after having Delaney's ribs. 3. Pulled Pork - Of all the meat, this was probably the best meat at Fatte Sau. It looked dry so I only got a quarter of a pound. I wish I got more and less of the other meat as we could barely even swallow them down. This was flavorful and moist. It's not the best pulled pork I ever had but at least it was edible..... Mighty Quinns has the best pulled pork! 4. Half Sour pickles - GROSS! SUPER GROSS! GROSS! I expected half sour pickles but got salted cucumbers.... One serving of this side included 4 pickles and we could only stomach 2 bites of 1 pickle and threw out the rest.... What a waste of money. 5. Sauerkraut - I ordered this when I also ordered the sausage. They told me they ran out of sausages and I forgot to cancel this item. It's just standard Sauerkraut... something you can find in any store.6. Potato salad - This was one delicious potato salad! If you are going to Fatte Sau, then you should get some potato salad. It was super flavorful and one of the best potato salad I've had but not enough for me to go back to Fatte Sau. Overall, I did NOT like this place. I gave it two stars for the pulled pork and potato salad. The service was SUPER slow. There's only 1 guy that cuts the meats and takes order, and this was definitely the bottle neck.  Also, the seating was horrific. Came here on a Saturday night. It was everyone for themselves when it came to seating. If you're not aggressive enough, then you might as well sit on the floor like a dog. Or visit during a time it's not busy....",2.0
"Went here on St. Patty's day with a group of 5 friends and here's what you need to know:The Q is good.  The sides are not.  Don't waste time or money on the sides.  The beans are too sweet and you want them to taste smokey.  The slaw is meh.  As is the german potato salad.  The saurkraut tastes like they opened a bag and it's cold and just gross.  Trust me, salt and pepper cannot save the sides.The BBQ is good....falls off the bone.  Good brisket, great ribs, lots of burnt ends.Here's the thing:  It is picnic style communal seating and you can't make a reservation or sit down and save spots for friends....it's a very casual place.  You will find yourself staring at folks that are clearly done eating while they linger, watching you stand there with your tray of food.  Ultimate rudness.  If you go during peak, you are going to stand on a line and wait for a table while you watch your food get cold.  It's not a good vibe... if you are thinking ....""I'm gonna fight that guy, for that spot....he better not do the 'resting of the coat' thing and take up more space....""

"Probably my top 1 or 2 BBQ restaurant in New York. Their short ribs were the best I've ever had!  I really enjoyed all of their meats/sausages. The beers they have were solid too. I have no complaints about the food at all!The restaurant is in a garage with limited seating on the inside but plenty of park bench seating outside. Get there early if possible.

The pulled pork is decent.I don't love any of the sides, but the fatty meats and beer selection make up for that.",5.0
"Short and sweet version:1) Go there, try the pork. So, this place would probably get a higher rating if it were in a better neighborhood, honestly. Williamsburg is not convenient to mass transit in general, and the Fette Sau is tucked away in a back corner of the neighborhood blocks and blocks away from the Subway. The place was, for the longest time, the golden standard in the City for BBQ - and to be honest it still is, with regards to pork at least. The pork belly can't be beaten, the house made sausages are fantastic. It only seems to fall down when it comes to sides, and that's because most of the newer joints have fryers and ovens and the lot - while the Fette Sau is still strictly a BBQ joint. It's honestly worth  the extra travel time, and the wait - to try just the once. As for going back? If I'm in Williamsburg during their open hours, then yes - most assuredly yes I take the time to go to the Fette Sau. If I'm literally ANYWHERE ELSE in the city, then no - I don't. As for calling this place ""Hipster"" - I would politely disagree, if there's a BBQ joint in the city that fits my imagination of what a BBQ joint should be - the one in a converted Garage brings me back the closest to the country BBQ joints of my youth. Sure, it's Williamsburg - It was a hipster mecca at some point or something (although now it's so full of rich tourists it might as well be a Gluten Free version Time Square) but Fette Sau's product has a measured focus and quality to it that I generally don't associate with ""Hipster"" - it's just good.",4.0
"Burnt end BBQ beans rocked my world, ribs and pork belly were tender and delicious. Beer available in half gallons is great for parties and big groups.

"Absolutely phenomenal BBQ. Come here with good company and bring your appetite, your patience while you make sure you have no other plans for the night. This is the main event, don't expect to go clubbing after this because the long wait, dining, and painful fullness of this will send you home happy.""Why would anyone wait 1-2hrs for BBQ? Shoot, we can do that at home!"" Yeah, no. Don't tell your friends about the wait, just hush them up with a gallon jug of beer. They will complain but they will thank you later. If you're lucky it might be too cold for all the wussies and you won't have to wait.Hyped up enough? The BBQ...beef brisket is superb. Melts in your mouth good. Put some sauce on it whether BBQ or spicy. The pork ribs, short ribs etc are all so delish too as if these cows and pigs were sent from heaven. THE SIDES, good god yes GET THEM. Baked beans are my favorite and whew these are so good you won't stop eating them. The broccoli and potato salad are also winners.Remember to send one of your companions to get a jug of beer to drink while you wait. Once closer to ordering have someone else find seating.",5.0
Extremely disappointed as this place is I overrated. Service is good but the quality control is lacking in their end product. Most of my order was fat and end bits. I know there is fat involved in any BBQ/smoked meats -for flavor- but not when 85%-90%  of something you ordered is fat- and that's aside from the bone (note: do not order the lamb breast as it is only bone and fat with no meat). Only decent thing was the brisket. For the price it should be better. It's more a 'concept' restaurant- with the cafeteria style serving and picnic tables. Kitchy but better bbq and fun elsewhere.,2.0
"I'm just going to be blunt: Fette Sau is over hyped hipster BBQ.  You should expect that when you come to Williamsburg for BBQ though.The cuts of meat and selection are interesting but leave a lot to be desired.  The black angus beef was very tender and juicy but had NO FLAVOR AT ALL!  The pork short ribs tasted like charred air!  This is not what you want in your BBQ!Sauce?  They don't recommend that you use sauce on their BBQ because of the dry rubs they use on their meat but they have sauces available at all the tables there (all of the sauces provided are ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING DON'T EVEN BOTHER WITH THEM! I came here with my cousin and upon his trying of one of the sauces at the table he made this hideous face, spit out his food and exclaimed, ""THIS TASTES LIKE MUD!"" LOL!) Half  the essence of good BBQ is sauce, there is no reinventing BBQ in 2012 people! Make a good sauce for your BBQ and cut out the pretentious hipster BS!The sides leave a lot to be desired as well.  I had their beans and the sweet potatoes.  The beans were not that bad but were missing something and the sweet potatoes were extremely bland and blah.On top of the not so great tasting BBQ, they have a flat screen TV in the dining area that plays a loop of a digital fireplace.  Talk about hipster BS, this is the icing on the cake and makes this place more of a joke.The only positive thing that I can say about this place is that the staff is reasonably friendly unlike a lot of places in Brooklyn and the greater NY area.I can't recommend this place to anybody with confidence due to taste (lack there of) and price (too expensive for the lack of flavor), and believe me after hearing so many good things about this place I left disappointed.I can't speak to the craft beer and other selection of alcohol here as I didn't feel like drinking when I was there last night. I did see a few huge gallon jugs of beer at the tables and just from the look of them it looked like a party and I love beer but let's just say nobody comes here looking for the best beer and there are plenty of places that have great drinks.",1.0
"I've got four words for you: Vintage. Beef. Short. Ribs. Only Brooklyn would use ""vintage"" to describe a cut of meat, but it's oddly appropriate. When they pull that thick cut rib out of the steaming glass case, you feel like you're getting something special. And holy cow, those few bites (I didn't get a big rib because they cost an arm and a leg) was some of THE best meat I've ever had. And my family's from Texas, so my standards are pretty damn high.  That being said, I've obviously been dying to come to Fette Sau for...well, basically since I moved to NYC. My friends and I plotted and planned the best time to go, and somehow, we wandered in on a Monday night to discover NO WAIT AT ALL. The O'Mighty Gods of BBQ were smiling on us that night, as we secured our table for four and got our food in less than 10 minutes. As other reviews mention, you walk up to the counter, point to what you want and how much of it you want, order your sides, and then carry your spaceship-sized metal tray back to the communal wooden tables. I ended up trying a vintage beef short rib, the brisket and pulled pork. All of it was delicious (the short rib was the star), but I really liked the brisket. Super tender and moist. I liked the pulled pork too, even more so when I slathered it in a mixture of their table-side BBQ sauces (one ketchup-like choice, and a bottle of what must have been straight-up vinegar). As for the sides, I think the best plan of action is to order a bunch and share. We tried the Half Sour Pickles, German Potato Salad, Burnt End Baked Beans and the Broccoli Salad. I loved the potato salad - it's got a vinegar/grain mustard dressing that keeps it light and tangy - and the garlicky broccoli salad has a perfect crunch. The pickles were definitely a nice contrast to the heaviness of the meat, but I wanted them to be just a LITTLE more...well, pickled. I also wasn't the biggest fan of the beans. The flavor and smokiness is great, but the beans themselves were a little hard and undercooked. I have to say, as far as sides are concerned, one of my favorites is those good ol'potato rolls that they serve free with your meal. That chewy, delicious bread is perfect for dipping into beans, soaking up extra sauce, or making tiny pulled pork sliders. Yes. Just, YES. All in all, Fette Sau was pretty damn excellent. Best BBQ I've ever had in my life? No. But definitely good enough to keep me coming back. Just not TOO frequently - it's pretty pricey!",5.0
"Probably my top 1 or 2 BBQ restaurant in New York. Their short ribs were the best I've ever had!  I really enjoyed all of their meats/sausages. The beers they have were solid too. I have no complaints about the food at all!The restaurant is in a garage with limited seating on the inside but plenty of park bench seating outside. Get there early if possible. Of course with all BBQ joints, expect to eat messy as it is what it is. There's also the Radegast Biergarten only a few minutes walking distance away so a good place to go after dinner.",5.0
Oh my. Yum.Elevated hipster smoked meats and charcuterie (noteworthy especially for the city). All the sides are amazing as well. Love the atmosphere even when it's crowded.,4.0
"I don't have the patience to wait for a table here so have done take out...Large unctuous portions of pork belly, brisket and pulled pork with some sticky sweet baked beans, their butter buns and some pickles are all you need.  They do however need to invest in some better take home containers...the brown bag was soaked through with all of the mat juices and grease and so I almost ended up having everything fall out onto the street before I made it home.A bit over blown for what they do, but it's still good.",3.0
"Best BBQ in NY! You will leave satisfied and stuffed!Still haven't had a chance to try the ribeye, but they had sirloin this time. It was good, but chewy if you go the wrong piece. The brisket is delish!! Skip the wild boar belly (too lean), and the ribs are still too dry for me. The pulled pork is decent.I don't love any of the sides, but the fatty meats and beer selection make up for that.",5.0
"Short and sweet version:1) Go there, try the pork. So, this place would probably get a higher rating if it were in a better neighborhood, honestly. Williamsburg is not convenient to mass transit in general, and the Fette Sau is tucked away in a back corner of the neighborhood blocks and blocks away from the Subway. The place was, for the longest time, the golden standard in the City for BBQ - and to be honest it still is, with regards to pork at least. The pork belly can't be beaten, the house made sausages are fantastic. It only seems to fall down when it comes to sides, and that's because most of the newer joints have fryers and ovens and the lot - while the Fette Sau is still strictly a BBQ joint. It's honestly worth  the extra travel time, and the wait - to try just the once. As for going back? If I'm in Williamsburg during their open hours, then yes - most assuredly yes I take the time to go to the Fette Sau. If I'm literally ANYWHERE ELSE in the city, then no - I don't. As for calling this place ""Hipster"" - I would politely disagree, if there's a BBQ joint in the city that fits my imagination of what a BBQ joint should be - the one in a converted Garage brings me back the closest to the country BBQ joints of my youth.

"PLEASE NOTE 4.5 StarsOne of the best BBQ spots I have been to in NY. I have heard about this place for a long time. Its been raved about by every foodie blog you can think of. I'm usually wary of spots like this as they tend to become hipster tourist traps but its friggin GOOD. The food is amazing. Their menu changes from day to day but it looks like they have the same items all the time. The day I went there was sirloin steak on the menu but by the time It was my turn on the line it was sold out. They do run out of stuff but I can't be mad at them for that, the food is amazing. You can order everything by the pound (1/2 pound 1/4 pound etc etc). Our group numbered 12 so we got a little bit of everything. We got the pork ribs, beef brisket, smoked chicken, pork belly, baked beans, potato salad,cornbread and steamed broccoli.  All the meats were smoked to perfection. The rub they use is flavorfull and it the meat is tender. The sides were great. Could use a little more variety but what they offer they make well. If you are looking for a cheap dinner for a bunch of your friends then come here. Like I said above there was 12 of us and when we split up the bill it came out to about 24 dollars per person and we ordered a ton of food. Definitely the cheapest spot to get 5 star BBQ in NYC. They have a full bar with lots of beer and drink selection. You can get a growler full of whatever beer you want. Again for large groups they really knock it out the park cost wise. You end up spending less then 8 bucks a person for a full one and you can get a drink or 2 out of them. My only gripe with this place is it gets very very busy and seating is first come first serve. If you are trying to get large group in there its going to be a chore. We got lucky but we could of ended up sitting apart from each other at several tables. The restaurant is big but seating is limited. Besides the business and wait this place is perfect. Great for groups and a must for meat eaters.",4.0
"Best BBQ in NYC.From strictly a bbq meat perspective, this place is the best. The way the restaurant is laid out is horrific, so if you plan on going here, go early in the day on a weekday. Avoid weekends altogether.

Large beer and whiskey selection, although somewhat overpriced. With open seating (and very limited seating in the winter) coupled with ONE GUY slicing meat to order for each customer, there is always a line. Though the food is great, I would never wait an hour or more standing in a line and then not be guaranteed a seat.  The supply chain logistics are what they are, so if you want the food, pick an off-peak time and prepare to wait.",4.0

I had no idea how much meat to order per person, but the butcher helped me without a problem.

"With a name like ""Fette Sau,"" (German for ""Fat Pig,"") it seems only right to have an abundance of short ribs, pulled pork, and pork belly on the menu. The vibe of this place throws me off...cafeteria style ordering with community seating, which reminds me of back home in the south, but full of hipsters who are comfortable paying a million dollars for a pound of brisket. A little exaggeration aside, this place is not cheap, almost the same price as a lot of steak dinners around the area, which more personally I would enjoy more. The BBQ is not even the best in Williamsburg (you have to use their sauce on the meat here to get some flavor out of it) , for me better BBQ is definitely at Brisket Town on s4th and bedford. What this place has, which is better than most around the area, is their amazing bourbon and beer selection.

"was in brooklyn last night and had decided on a meal at dinosaur bbq BUT after picking up our third party she convinced us to try fette sau. when we drove by i saw the huge line outside which for me indicates two things .. a long wait and NOT my ideal restaurant experience. i HATE waiting at restaurants especially outdoors. in any case, we sucked it up and waited. first thing i will say is that i HATE the seating. they have three large picnic type tables and when its crowded you literally have to fight for seating and if people dont eat fast enough you could very well be left standing holding a tray of food and have nowhere to sit. im also not a fan of communal style seating. i prefer my own table with my companions.food was served and priced by the pound. as we were waiting in line we decided to try a quarter pound of every meat on the menu however before we even got to the front of the line they ran out of bbq sausage so we were limited to ribs, pulled pork, brisket, and chicken. we literally got the last piece of chicken and although they do have pork belly, we ordered it but the server forgot to put it on our tray. anyway, the food was decent but i dont think you really get alot for your money. when i ordered, the guy weighing the meat asked me how many people were in our party and i replied that there were three of us and he said that we ordered alot of food but in reality it wasnt. we could have easily eaten more. bottom ,line, it was an okay experience. i would go back and i would also recommend it to others. just dont go on a friday night unless u wanna wait outside for 30 mins or more.",3.0

"With a name like ""Fette Sau,"" (German for ""Fat Pig,"") it seems only right to have an abundance of short ribs, pulled pork, and pork belly on the menu. The vibe of this place throws me off...cafeteria style ordering with community seating, which reminds me of back home in the south, but full of hipsters who are comfortable paying a million dollars for a pound of brisket. A little exaggeration aside, this place is not cheap, almost the same price as a lot of steak dinners around the area, which more personally I would enjoy more. The BBQ is not even the best in Williamsburg (you have to use their sauce on the meat here to get some flavor out of it) , for me better BBQ is definitely at Brisket Town on s4th and bedford.

As a bbq enthusiast I was disappointed. I found the meat to be dry.  It might of been an off night but I was not very impressed,3.0
"Much akin to Roberta's, the trend of opening up an eatery in a garage is also found at Fette Sau. My girlfriend and I found out about this place a while ago from a friend of hers who had went and made some Facebook post about the great BBQ and outrageously long line. With both of us  being curious to try, we finally made the trip out a few weeks ago, late on a Monday afternoon. We drove out here, but whether you drive or take the L train, this place is a bit of a hike.After lucking out and finding street parking, we had about 30 or 40 minutes until they opened. It was a warm night, so we just hung out on the street and talked until the sign was turned on and the gate was opened. Since we'd arrived, a few other people had also shown up, but the scene was very calm at their 5pm opening.Inside can be described as casual, cool and hipster. We went up to the counter and asked how we go about ordering. The server asked if it was our first time - it was - and then advised that between the two of us, we'd want a pound of meat. We opted to go with the beef brisket, pork ribs, pulled pork and pork belly, which came out to be 1/4 pound of each, except for the ribs. We were served four ribs, which came out to 3/4 lb, but there are bones in the ribs as well. We also got an ear of corn, a ginger beer and the meal came with four rolls, which comes in handy for dipping remnants of the meat juices and BBQ sauces.About the food, the brisket, pork ribs and pork belly were all really good. They were juicy, tender, meaty and well seasoned. The pork ribs were especially tender and fell right off the bone. The pork belly was a bit fattier than the other meats, but that's to be expected. My one gripe - and it's a big one - was that the pulled pork was extremely dry, which also took away some of the flavor. I don't know if this is the way it's normally served, but I hope they were just having an off night. The corn was also nothing to write home about, tho my girlfriend liked it, so I let her eat it.As others have noted, the seating is communal at long picnic tables. As the place wasn't too crowded, people will sit down next to you, but weren't elbowing or being rude in trying to claim seats. More people did show up as we ate, but the environment was always calm and collectively cool. I did ask when the line starts becoming legendary, to which they replied it usually happens later in the evening.Don't forget to check out the bar while you're here. The list of whiskeys and beers on tap is impressive. My other gripe, other than the extremely dry pulled pork, was that they were out of cider. No deductions for that tho.All in all, except for the pulled pork, the meal was yummy and the food and drink ran us $38. However, while the meal was delicious, I'd have been annoyed if I'd sat (or stood) through a two hour wait to eat here.",3.0
"Absolutely worth a 40 minute wait, wading through tightly-packed hipsters holding their Bell mason jars full of Brooklyn IPA.Communal seating, though vast, was still at a premium at 8 p.m. on a Friday night. Though I'm normally not ""that person"" that's about to hold seats for friends (as I do believe in ""first come, first serve"" in order to be fair to all), when your best friend has a disability and walks with a cane, you're damn straight I'm piling out coats on a bench, giving the evil eye to anyone that even dare glance at our end of the table. I did not get the pleasure of seeing the meats up close prior to them being piled on our meat trays. However, my friend Ozzie was in line, collecting our charred animal flesh, and he took ample Instagram documentation of meat being sliced for us, just as nature intended.I said ""meat tray"" previously. There is no exaggeration. Our meat was haphazardly piled onto a giant metal tray. The last time I had meat on a platter as such, I was in some wine village near Vienna, Austria, eating unknown meats from the bone off of ceramic platters, drinking red wines and having Austrian men play the fiddle 3 feet from my ear. Fette Sau provided me with a similar situation...well, except replace everything I just mentioned with a roaring fire...on the flat screen television and LCD Soundsystem coming through the speakers above my head. The meat, this time, was much more easy to identify. FACT: I could eat their Black Angus Beef Brisket every damn day for the rest of my life. The meat to fat marbling ratio was spot on, and it was cooked to absolute perfection. Though I did dip a few pieces into the sweet BBQ sauce for a bit of variety, it's perfect all on its own. TRUST ME. The Berkshire Country boneless ribs were a little bit of perfection as well. OH, the way the meat fell apart in my fork...in was almost artful. Needless to say, 1 & 1/2 pounds of meat is enough for three hungry men (...yes, I was a man that night). I could have had more! Add a Doc's Hard Cider and a bag of garlic dill potato chips to the mix, plus about six PERFECT potato rolls and...YEAH. The walk back to the L train was seemingly long, as I was weighed down with too much cow, potatoes, and alcohol. (Luckily, my partial Irish heritage / DNA did me a solid that night, allowing me to handle that trifecta, and I was able to pull through.)Fette Sau's got it right. In the words of Homer Simpson, ""You don't win friends with salad!"" Indeed, Fette Sau is winning many friends with its meat.",4.0
"My BFF came out to visit from Portland, OR with a long list of places in NYC that she wanted to try. Fette Sau was on that list. I hemmed and hawed about the fact that it was in Williamsburg, a place I only go if I'm gonna see a live show or there is some other compelling social event on tap, but rarely just to eat at one of its many fine restaurants (I know, it's stupid, but living in any other part of Brooklyn makes it feel like a chore to get there - just one more annoyingly ironic thing about Brooklyn). The truth is that it's absolutely worth traveling into Manhattan, catching the L train, riding it the short distance back into Brooklyn, and walking the few blocks that lead to this awesome restaurant.I am a lover of swine, from the adorable teacup piglets that I enjoy scrolling through on Buzzfeed (and it's okay if vegetarians and animal rights activists think I am a disgusting sub-human for saying this, you're probably not wrong) to the kind that come butchered and cooked to perfection on a big metal tray at Fette Sau. Oh porky. I'm sorry your life on earth was short, but I promise your slaughter won't be in vain if I have anything to do with it. Your delicate cheeks and tender rump will be cherished by my palate and help to sustain my own life a little longer. And, if in our next lives you are the human and I am the pig (though some may argue this is already the case), I hope you enjoy eating me as much as I have enjoyed eating you. And rarely have I enjoyed your myriad virtues as much as I did at Fette Sau.Also, NuNu Chocolate is sold here, so be sure to take advantage and stock up. It's not cheap, but neither is the karma for what you just ate, so you might as well go full hilt.",5.0
"I've been on a BBQ spree as of late. Partly influenced by my BBQ crazed friends who influenced my BBQ crazed girlfriend and together forced their BBQ ways upon me.On this week's episode of our crazy escapades, my girlfriend and I found ourselves at a Williamsburg gem, Fette Sau. BBQ from a garage at the end of a long, dark driveway? Count me in!We ordered a little of everything and soon had a platter of meats in front of us. First we tried the brisket which we had the highest hopes for. While the flavor was on point, there just wasn't enough fat to balance out the dry and somewhat overcooked meat. It was disappointing to say the least. Next up was the pulled pork. I split open one of the rolls they gave us and made myself a pulled pork sandwich with a bit of hot sauce. This was probably the best part of the meal. The roll was soft and I had managed to get myself a saucy pile of meat. Next up was the pork belly which while tender and fatty, came with a layer of charred skin that had to be removed. The pork ribs were just ok to me. I've had much better ribs come out of my friend's smoker. The whole meal can really be summed up in two words: Nothing Special.We also ordered a small container of the baked beans. These were pretty good. Is it weird that it gave me memories of eating baked beans by a campfire out of a tin cup like a cowboy? P.S. I've never been camping before. As far as I remember I don't think I've ever been a cowboy either.",3.0
"Food was good, not great.   Waiting on a long line to buy food by the lb. followed by having to squeeze myself into a seat at a gigantic  picnic table was a huge turnoff.   I'm not fussy, but  I'd like to be comfortable while I eat my food.  This isn't summer camp and I'm not 12.",2.0
The Hill Country of Brooklyn. Great place but small place. Always packed. I love the pork belly. Its a typical bbq spot no very fancy but damn good food.,4.0
"I had been wanted to visit this location ever since I saw it on the Food Network. It is all that and a bag of chips!!! The best brisket I have had in my life and I have had brisket all over the US. The collard greens were surprisingly excellent too. The ribs, sausage and pork belly were all very good but the brisket is the star of the show there. Get there early if you can because it gets pretty busy later in the evening and the wait time can be pretty long since they cut everything to order. The bar selection of local beers on tap were excellent.",5.0
"The brisket here is phenomenal. I've been here several times, and I don't care for anything else but the brisket. The best thing I ever ate here was one of their specials--bacon that melted in your mouth. I've had the beef tongue (it was OK, kind of disappointing), other usuals and other specials, but I always keep going back for more brisket. And the beans! So good!The place is a bit pricy and usually busy. Difficult to seat groups of 10+ together. But great beer selection, atmosphere, and brisketttt",5.0
"I should start off by saying, I do not like smoked bbq. This place is all smoked. Therefore, I was thoroughly underwhelmed when I ate here. The line was long and the anticipation for ""Great bbq"" completely went out the door as I quickly realized everything was smoked. Definitely more my fault for not reading up on the restaurant. However, if you like smoked bbq, try it out. It's probably delicious!",2.0
As a bbq enthusiast I was disappointed. I found the meat to be dry.  It might of been an off night but I was not very impressed,3.0
"Much akin to Roberta's, the trend of opening up an eatery in a garage is also found at Fette Sau. My girlfriend and I found out about this place a while ago from a friend of hers who had went and made some Facebook post about the great BBQ and outrageously long line. With both of us  being curious to try, we finally made the trip out a few weeks ago, late on a Monday afternoon. We drove out here, but whether you drive or take the L train, this place is a bit of a hike.After lucking out and finding street parking, we had about 30 or 40 minutes until they opened. It was a warm night, so we just hung out on the street and talked until the sign was turned on and the gate was opened. Since we'd arrived, a few other people had also shown up, but the scene was very calm at their 5pm opening.Inside can be described as casual, cool and hipster. We went up to the counter and asked how we go about ordering. The server asked if it was our first time - it was - and then advised that between the two of us, we'd want a pound of meat. We opted to go with the beef brisket, pork ribs, pulled pork and pork belly, which came out to be 1/4 pound of each, except for the ribs. We were served four ribs, which came out to 3/4 lb, but there are bones in the ribs as well. We also got an ear of corn, a ginger beer and the meal came with four rolls, which comes in handy for dipping remnants of the meat juices and BBQ sauces.About the food, the brisket, pork ribs and pork belly were all really good. They were juicy, tender, meaty and well seasoned. The pork ribs were especially tender and fell right off the bone. The pork belly was a bit fattier than the other meats, but that's to be expected. My one gripe - and it's a big one - was that the pulled pork was extremely dry, which also took away some of the flavor. I don't know if this is the way it's normally served, but I hope they were just having an off night. The corn was also nothing to write home about, tho my girlfriend liked it, so I let her eat it.As others have noted, the seating is communal at long picnic tables. As the place wasn't too crowded, people will sit down next to you, but weren't elbowing or being rude in trying to claim seats. More people did show up as we ate, but the environment was always calm and collectively cool. I did ask when the line starts becoming legendary, to which they replied it usually happens later in the evening.Don't forget to check out the bar while you're here. The list of whiskeys and beers on tap is impressive. My other gripe, other than the extremely dry pulled pork, was that they were out of cider. No deductions for that tho.All in all, except for the pulled pork, the meal was yummy and the food and drink ran us $38. However, while the meal was delicious, I'd have been annoyed if I'd sat (or stood) through a two hour wait to eat here.",3.0
"Absolutely worth a 40 minute wait, wading through tightly-packed hipsters holding their Bell mason jars full of Brooklyn IPA.Communal seating, though vast, was still at a premium at 8 p.m. on a Friday night. Though I'm normally not ""that person"" that's about to hold seats for friends (as I do believe in ""first come, first serve"" in order to be fair to all), when your best friend has a disability and walks with a cane, you're damn straight I'm piling out coats on a bench, giving the evil eye to anyone that even dare glance at our end of the table. I did not get the pleasure of seeing the meats up close prior to them being piled on our meat trays. However, my friend Ozzie was in line, collecting our charred animal flesh, and he took ample Instagram documentation of meat being sliced for us, just as nature intended.I said ""meat tray"" previously. There is no exaggeration. Our meat was haphazardly piled onto a giant metal tray. The last time I had meat on a platter as such, I was in some wine village near Vienna, Austria, eating unknown meats from the bone off of ceramic platters, drinking red wines and having Austrian men play the fiddle 3 feet from my ear. Fette Sau provided me with a similar situation...well, except replace everything I just mentioned with a roaring fire...on the flat screen television and LCD Soundsystem coming through the speakers above my head. The meat, this time, was much more easy to identify. FACT: I could eat their Black Angus Beef Brisket every damn day for the rest of my life. The meat to fat marbling ratio was spot on, and it was cooked to absolute perfection. Though I did dip a few pieces into the sweet BBQ sauce for a bit of variety, it's perfect all on its own. TRUST ME. The Berkshire Country boneless ribs were a little bit of perfection as well. OH, the way the meat fell apart in my fork...in was almost artful. Needless to say, 1 & 1/2 pounds of meat is enough for three hungry men (...yes, I was a man that night). I could have had more! Add a Doc's Hard Cider and a bag of garlic dill potato chips to the mix, plus about six PERFECT potato rolls and...YEAH. The walk back to the L train was seemingly long, as I was weighed down with too much cow, potatoes, and alcohol. (Luckily, my partial Irish heritage / DNA did me a solid that night, allowing me to handle that trifecta, and I was able to pull through.)Fette Sau's got it right. In the words of Homer Simpson, ""You don't win friends with salad!"" Indeed, Fette Sau is winning many friends with its meat.",4.0
"My BFF came out to visit from Portland, OR with a long list of places in NYC that she wanted to try. Fette Sau was on that list. I hemmed and hawed about the fact that it was in Williamsburg, a place I only go if I'm gonna see a live show or there is some other compelling social event on tap, but rarely just to eat at one of its many fine restaurants (I know, it's stupid, but living in any other part of Brooklyn makes it feel like a chore to get there - just one more annoyingly ironic thing about Brooklyn). The truth is that it's absolutely worth traveling into Manhattan, catching the L train, riding it the short distance back into Brooklyn, and walking the few blocks that lead to this awesome restaurant.I am a lover of swine, from the adorable teacup piglets that I enjoy scrolling through on Buzzfeed (and it's okay if vegetarians and animal rights activists think I am a disgusting sub-human for saying this, you're probably not wrong) to the kind that come butchered and cooked to perfection on a big metal tray at Fette Sau. Oh porky. I'm sorry your life on earth was short, but I promise your slaughter won't be in vain if I have anything to do with it. Your delicate cheeks and tender rump will be cherished by my palate and help to sustain my own life a little longer. And, if in our next lives you are the human and I am the pig (though some may argue this is already the case), I hope you enjoy eating me as much as I have enjoyed eating you. And rarely have I enjoyed your myriad virtues as much as I did at Fette Sau.Also, NuNu Chocolate is sold here, so be sure to take advantage and stock up. It's not cheap, but neither is the karma for what you just ate, so you might as well go full hilt.",5.0

"Meat is not smoked with charcoal and wood the old fashioned way.  They use electric smokers that may either use wood chunks or pellets.  The meat had barely any smoke ring, especially a brisket which is supposed to have a deep red ring from being smoked for 8+ hours.  The meats are very tender and juicy, but bland in general.  They dry rubs are weak,requires laying on the sauce for all meats.  The 2 sides I had so much vinegar and salt I needed to drink hard a  up of water after every bite.  We got the beans and the potato salad.  Both I'd recommend against.

I replied to her, ""nothing I'm just enjoying my food, focusing on the flavors, trying to remember it."" It was just that damn good. My daughter dogged a large order of baked beans & we sampled all of the other cuts of meat. I was surprised at how jam packed the restaurant was on a weekday night.

"Recently I experienced WIlliamsburg for the very first time--with the guidance of my sister and brother-in-law of course. After walking around (not for very long), I was starved and they kept ranting and raving about this BBQ place that was always too packed for them to go (like a 2 hour wait) but was supposed to be amazing. So, needless to say, my boyfriend and I didn't need very much convincing so we hopped in the car and arrived at Fette Sau.I barely noticed that we were there since the front is very modest. You first walk through a small picnic-like area and arrive at the front door. Inside almost looks like a German beer place. I was confused since the place was empty and my sister had said it was usually too packed--but I supposed the fact that it was a Tuesday rather than a Saturday made a huge difference. Looking at the menu I was a little confused but thankfully my sis knew exactly how to order. You order by the pound and each pound of meat is about $20. It isn't clear how much the sides are--but I think there was a separate menu for that. The four of us chowed down on Brisket, ribs and pulled pork. We got half sour pickles, potato salad, beans and free rolls.The meat was pure decadence. So tender and the seasonings were amazing. (My mouth is totally watering thinking about it as I type!) My favorite was definitely the ribs and the pulled pork. Half sour pickles are my favorite, the potato salad was OK and the beans, although everyone else loved them, they were a little too rich and seasoned for my taste. Definitely worth going here--Since I'm not really tolerant for waiting for my food--and you're like me-avoid being cranky and snapping at your friends and just go on an off night like we did! :) Enjoy!",5.0

"Oh Fette Sau... Your constant crowdedness and long lines have intimidated me, and your location all the way across the Wburg bridge has deterred me from getting my ass over to you for so long. Now that I have finally tasted some of your sweet, sweet BBQ, I can honestly say that all of my newfound love for you completely overcomes all of the previous fear and doubt I have had. I promise to never stay stray too far from you ever again.Four of us came here on a beautiful Sunday afternoon just before 6pm, to a surprisingly short line. However about 15 minutes after we stepped in line, the place somehow almost miraculously filled up quickly and tables became difficult to come by. It seems that you really have to come here early, before the dinner rush, in order to not only get a table but also score some tasty meat because when they run out, they run out. They were already out of the oh so popular pork belly when we got there.Between the four of us, we got about a pound of pulled pork, beef brisket, 4 spicy Berkshire pork sausages, Gus's pickles, and burnt ends baked beans, along with their fluffy sweet dinner rolls. The beef brisket was particular fatty that day, which was good and bad because the fattiness obviously ensured that the brisket would be moist; however us two girls aren't exactly fond of beef fat. The spicy sausage was surprisingly the standout meat of the day, the casing had a great snap, giving way to perfectly fatty, smokey and spicy pork. God I love sausage!* The pulled pork was very good and quite lean, which tasted totally awesome doused in either one of the two BBQ sauces (one is sweeter and the other smokier and sightly spicy) on their tables. The baked beans with burnt ends was surprisingly good as well, full of smokey meatiness all bathing in this thick, sweet BBQ sauce. While I have yet to try every single BBQ joint in NYC, I think that Fette Sau is possibly one of the best BBQ restaurants not only in Brooklyn but also in all of NYC. I love the laid back atmosphere, full bar stocked with beers on tap (available by the gallons, btw), whiskey and even wines, and the long communal tables. It's also great that you can order anything you want and pay by the pound, which makes the experience totally customizable and 100% awesome.--*That's what she said!

"Once, my hands-down absolute favorite bbq place but OH, How the Mighty Have Fallen! Underseasoned, UNCOOKED Smoked BabyBacks, juicy but flavorless Brisket is NOT cool! German Potato Salad needed Seasoning, start w Salt & Pepper...it goes a LONG way! Baked beans BURNT! I'm usually extremely fair & am sensitive about letting a resto mgr know ""privately"" about any issues.  I'm particular but not too fussy. When I advised them of the Baby Back UNDONENESS (my only complaint,) the counter butcher TRIED to recharge me for a new set of ribs! NOT on MY watch! VERY RUDE & INSULTING! I hadn't even eaten taken a bite of the original ones because they were COLD AND NOT DONE! They WOULDN'T even come off the bone!!!! Initially, they TRIED to finish cooking the original order but I asked them, ""Are u serious? Do u know HOW LONG that would take & you're NOT just throwing them into the convection oven!""  The cashier & cooks were accomodating & got me FRESH ribs but the Butcher didnt want to! The NERVE! Especially considering HOW EXPENSIVE they are!I will give Fette Sau another opportunity, at a much later date!

I'm usually extremely fair & am sensitive about letting a resto mgr know ""privately"" about any issues.  I'm particular but not too fussy.

I hadn't even eaten taken a bite of the original ones because they were COLD AND NOT DONE! They WOULDN'T even come off the bone!!!! Initially, they TRIED to finish cooking the original order but I asked them, ""Are u serious? Do u know HOW LONG that would take & you're NOT just throwing them into the convection oven!""

"I hate to say it, but I think this place is hyped up too much. I've been wanting to try this place out after i saw it on TV. Unfortunately for Fette Sau, i had really high expectations. I mean it was good, but it wasn't banging.On a Saturday afternoon 12:30PM, my friends and I trekked into Brooklyn using the L train. THe commute to Fette Sau isn't bad at all if you're coming in from Manhattan.My 2 friends and I shared a 1/2 lb. of brisket, 1/2 lb. of pulled pork shoulder, 1/2 lb. of sliced pork belly, 3 rolls, and a large side of roasted potatoes with bacon. The brisket was in my opinion very dry. The rub on it was flavorful, but i couldn't get past on how dry it was. It seriously pales in comparison to Hill Country's moist brisket. I'd have to say it was more flavorful than Hill Country's Lean brisket, but i think it was also more dry.  The pork shoulder was also very dry. My friends and I had to douse it with sauces to keep it moist. I was not a fan of this.The pork belly. Now WOW talk about being moist. This made up for all of the dryness of the other two meats. The pork belly was so fatty, there was like no pork meat. It was like 90% pork fat. It was soooo goood. Omg it melted in my mouth. I loved it. The roll was average; it was just nice to use it to make a mini sandwich.The best part of the lunch meal was our side dish. The roasted potatoes with the bacon..OMG it was THE BOMB. One of the best potato side dishes that i ever tasted. I could have had this by itself and i would have been content. It was that good.Overall i was disappointed in the pork shoulder and brisket, but the belly and potatoes made up for it. I was disappointed that wagyu cheeks and pork cheeks weren't on the menu like it states on the website. I also think the subpar brisket and shoulder is due to the fact that the food was for lunch.

I've yet to try a fleshy varietal that I didn't enjoy, but it's really hard for me to wrap my head around the absurdly high prices and the hour plus wait for a tray of charred meats. When I think BBQ, I think inexpensive grocery store runs and backyards in Texas... not $45 for an for a small sinful indulgence. I suppose it's New York and not a landlocked destination in the Heartland, but really... it just doesn't add up to me. Despite the massive price tag, it's still one of the best BBQ joints in town, and given the weather cooperates, it's just about the best hang in all of NY for a lazy weekend day with sunshine and a gaggle of great friends.

"The best brisket I've had in an extremely long time. I could tell it would be awesome as I reached the home-stretch of my wait in line. The carver was taking things in and out of the hot case to slice for people's orders. When he pulled out the fatty beef brisket, and chucked it back in... it JIGGLED, just so. The jiggle of a piece of beef that is striated with enough fat to give it maximum flavor as it hits your mouth, yet not JUST fat. And the crust on the edge of the brisket... oh. my. Gawd.Believe me, I would take the L every day to hipsterville to have a taste of this - daily - if not for two things: the cost and the wait.The cost is something that is hard to avoid. Every brisket that exits the smoker is pretty much a work of art being parceled out to a couple dozen customers before a new one has to be brought out. But it definitely limits my desire to hit it every day.. which is probably a good thing because it's probably not health food by a long shot!The wait... now that can be avoided. Tourists and noobs clogging up the line have no idea how to order meat by the pound. I can't say I'm very experienced either, but I made sure to have my order ready by the time I reached the front of the line. I cannot say the same for the vast majority of other people in line. They were discussing amongst themselves what the appropriate amount of brisket to get was, whether they should get sides, ""oh, what are the sides? do you have a menu?"", etc. It was just disgraceful that the staff here let the line slow down to that degree. What happened to the no bullshit NYC attitude where if you're not ready to order when it's your turn, you get to wait for the next guy ahead of you to go?Seriously, they could do a lot better. They could require people to hand in an order form with their choices, then at the last minute they could instruct the carver to get the particular piece they want out of the hot case to fulfill their order with. They could also provide a standard sampler order that they multiply by the number of people in your party for a fixed price. That would be fine. Anything to force people to decide AHEAD OF TIME and not waste the time of the dozens of people behind them in line.Oh yes, make sure to get the BURNT ENDS BAKED BEANS too.

"To best enjoy Fette Sau, it's smart to study history.  In particular, the invasion of Normandy in World War II.First of all, assemble a coalition of allies - at least 6 to 12 people.  Then split this group into divisions, each with its own unique mission.When launching the assault, team Omaha should get in line.  You need a steady, stoic on line presence as the wait will be upwards of an hour when busy.  Those with patient personalities (not the foot-stomping angst-ridden, slap a soldier Patton types) are best suited for this task.  A second group, Utah, should land on a table and secure a beachhead upon the benches.  They need not try and hold an entire area - but enough space to land supplies and expand the footprint once that the food drop is imminent.  A third group, called Easy Company, should also be sent in to maneuver within the restaurant, performing various tasks.  Example:- procure beer for the bench warmers and line waiters- spell others needing bathroom breaks- gather needed supplies such as paper towels, toothpicks and cutlery- scout & then provide intelligence reports as to what's on the menu.  Of course you can try other approaches (to your own peril).  I observed small groups and couples on dates neglect the above strategies only to find themselves without a place to sit or a whistle that was not sufficiently wet.  Do not get stuck without a beachhead or you will get overrun by plaid wearing ironically bearded panzer hipsters.Only a combined multi-faceted assault by overwhelming forces will best ensure the odds for victory.  Finally, once team Omaha is landed at the counter and ready to order, have everyone throw in cash and simply get a giant platter of everything.Then you can feast on the spoils of war.",4.0

"To best enjoy Fette Sau, it's smart to study history.  In particular, the invasion of Normandy in World War II.First of all, assemble a coalition of allies - at least 6 to 12 people.  Then split this group into divisions, each with its own unique mission.When launching the assault, team Omaha should get in line.  You need a steady, stoic on line presence as the wait will be upwards of an hour when busy.  Those with patient personalities (not the foot-stomping angst-ridden, slap a soldier Patton types) are best suited for this task.  A second group, Utah, should land on a table and secure a beachhead upon the benches.  They need not try and hold an entire area - but enough space to land supplies and expand the footprint once that the food drop is imminent.  A third group, called Easy Company, should also be sent in to maneuver within the restaurant, performing various tasks.  Example:- procure beer for the bench warmers and line waiters- spell others needing bathroom breaks- gather needed supplies such as paper towels, toothpicks and cutlery- scout & then provide intelligence reports as to what's on the menu.  Of course you can try other approaches (to your own peril).  I observed small groups and couples on dates neglect the above strategies only to find themselves without a place to sit or a whistle that was not sufficiently wet.  Do not get stuck without a beachhead or you will get overrun by plaid wearing ironically bearded panzer hipsters.Only a combined multi-faceted assault by overwhelming forces will best ensure the odds for victory.  Finally, once team Omaha is landed at the counter and ready to order, have everyone throw in cash and simply get a giant platter of everything.Then you can feast on the spoils of war.",4.0

"Fetta Sau is a very good representation of Northern / dry rub BBQ.   Love the hole in the wall conversion of the old garage.  Walk down the narrow driveway with a few picnic tables and pray that the line is not a mile long.   Now wait....and wait.....and wait for your turn at the counter.   During the wait pray that the items you plan on ordering do not get erased from the board.  Finally you get your turn......like all others have said you order by the pound so you can order as little or as much as you want.   We had been eating all day so stuck with the Berkshire pork shoulder and the Angus brisket.   Added an order of burnt end baked beans and rolls for a nice mid-day snack.   Food was very good.   Not a real heavy smoke to either protein, but an excellent, heavy (almost charcoal) bark.   Both were moist with the internal fat left and a nice caramelization  to the out side.  The dry rub is not overpowering as to leave the nuisance of the meat.   The table has two sauces.   The vinegar sauce is very acidic and does cut the richness of the fat.  The tomato based sauce is more on the sweet side then spice.   The beans are very meaty and the burnt end flavor comes thru strongly.   Overall:  I ate every last ounce and enjoyed each bit.  It was very good, but just a step under excellent.  Personally, I like a bit more smoke and spice to the dry rub.    Main Pro:  love the room and high quality of the food.  Cons:   price is high and the wait must be brutal when the line stretches to the street.",4.0
"Fette Sau helped destroy a few biases I've held over the years. One: brisket is my least favorite BBQ meat -- yet, the brisket at this joint was oh-so-tender and oh-so-juicy and easily the most delicious item on my filled plate.

It was thick and sweet and ugh, why didn't I take the rest home??

I'm happy to say that I was wrong, wrong, wrong. We came at 6 PM on Friday, early enough to secure a seat on a bench indoors next to friendly locals and to get on a relatively short line for the food.

"Not sure where the guy who had a waitress at a table here went, but it definitely wasn't Fette Sau. Just because I feel like one of the hallmarks of this place is the line. But oh, is that wait patiently rewarded with delicious hunks of meat at the end (and I'm generally not even a fan of BBQ.) We got here at about 6 on a Friday and ended up going straight to the bar to pick up drinks for the line first - which was a mistake, we should have left one person in line, because when we looked back the line had doubled in size. But that  30 minute wait left us hungry for MEAT - and meat we did get. We ended getting about 4.5 lbs of meat between 5 people - 3 guys, 2 girls - pork belly, pork shoulder, brisket, and ribs. Brisket was delicious, as were the ribs (although I think I prefer Phil's in San Diego) and the belly, in the sense that I ate one of each and my eyes rolled back in happiness. The shoulder was good, but not exemplary, and maybe not worth the wait when you've been waiting for 30 minutes, but it did help to cut the fattiness of the belly and the ribs.  The belly was probably what the table agreed on as the best, as it was flavorful and had an awesome crust, but the fattiness might not be for everyone. I didn't like the sauces in the squirt bottles, so if you have your own bbq sauce that you enjoy...maybe bring some in lol. Sideswise, the broccoli salad is awesome and I'm not sure why everyone was raving about the beans, because they're decent, but not like drop your panties delicious, but maybe we just got a badly seasoned batch? Rolls are decent too, nothing to write home about, but if you need something to mop up some sauce, you got it.Since I haven't tried Dinosaur BBQ or any of the other of the other BBQ places minus at the Big Apple BBQ Block Party, I don't know if I can make a good judgement on how good it is compared to the rest of the places in the city, but Fette Sau was pretty awesome.",4.0

"I thought it would be better than it turned out to be given the millions of reviews and line out the door at 10 pm. Quality meats but all lacked that smoked, BBQ goodness. The pork belly was probably our fave. Even the sauces disappointed. As for sides, the beans are way too tangy and should be skipped; potato salad and half-sours were on point. It is also pricey: $97 for two people drinking 4 beers, taking home a small doggy bag, AND no table service. One and done spot but glad I crossed it off my list.",3.0
"Meh. Nothing crazy or special about this place. Their BBQ sauce taste like ketchup. Their other BBQ sauce tasted like chipotle. I had the brisket and pork belly and a few sides. The brisket didn't have the classic salty-ness I've come to expect and enjoy from most briskets. It actually tasted pretty bland and I felt like it was missing something. It hardly had any smoke flavor in it. The pork belly was not bad but again very little in the way of smoke flavoring. Maybe their idea of low and slow is a 2 or 3 hour smoke job. It is New York and everyone is in a rush. BTW what gives with not having pork ribs? I thought that was a BBQ standard? Anyway moving on. Oh no beef ribs either on my visit but back to my review.I think the raving reviews are probably more from the hippies enjoying themselves at the communal tables than the actual quality of the food or the atmosphere. After a while groups were just sitting at the tables talking although they had been done eating for over 20 minutes and there were people waiting to find a place to sit. Oblivious to the world around as most hipsters and hippies are they just sat there and continued to talk and bullshit while people waited with trays of food on their hands and having to eat standing up.I'm not big into the communal sitting thing either I don't understand the hype. I'd rather eat a place like Blue Smoke or Dinosaur BBQ any day over that mad house with mediocre food.Also, about the potato salad, I'm not sure what they were going for but I've never had anything like that. Again I wasn't impressed, think potatoes not fully cooked with light coating mayo some garden herbs and a sprinkle of mustard seed. Except when I say sprinkle I meant some jokester must have twisted the cap because that shit was covered in it! The broccoli uses the same exact seasoning as the potato salad. Both were cold which was expected of the potato salad but not the broccoli. The beans were really good and are the one thing I have no complaints about and can actually recommend with clear conscious. Anyone thinking of traveling from any where other than the immediate neighborhood just to try this because its been rated ""the best BBQ in New York City"" I recommend you pass unless you're a masochist that enjoys disappointment and overpaying.",1.0
"Fette Sau is just great.  The ribs are delicious.  Every time I have eaten there I have pretty much left with a food hangover.  One time I stuffed myself silly, until I literally felt drunk.  Probably wasn't the wisest decision to make, but bodamn...yummy.  Just go.  The only reason why I had to give them 4, and not 5 stars, is because I recently had better.  MIGHT QUINNS oooolala. SO many people know so LITTLE about food, and the fact that they are allowed to review restaurants on Yelp makes Yelp itself a faulty application.  I am tired of reading bad reviews for good restaurants.  Reviews that are based on silly issues such as 'Small Portions', or 'too expensive prices' , or the worst 'too hipster'.  You know what?  Get a job.  Make more money.  Stop Stuffing yourself.  Lastly, stop complaining about these so called 'hipsters' who have already come and gone.",4.0

Good to have a friend scout for a table while you wait in line. Hover shamelessly; everyone's doing it.Simple sides like baked beans, German potato salad and broccoli salad are solid but obviously not the main attractions. I really wish they had creamed corn, but at least the baked beans were terrific. As for the meats, I was crazy about the brisket and pork belly. So freaking tender. Their signature sauce goes well with everything. I also LOVED the rolls--so buttery and soft, if only they were unlimited. Root beer to wash it all down. I split all of this with a friend, and it set us back $50. It was plenty of food and we had some leftovers, but it was still pretty pricey. BBQ lovers, add this to your bucket list.",5.0
"mmmmm~~~ everything was very yummy. I loved the pork belly and brisket the most, even for the next day. The baked bean is an also must have item. It was very tender and different from any other baked bean you ever had before. Definitely need to be there before they are open, so that you can avoid the long waiting time.",5.0
"Long wait, and worth every minute. I went with half pound of brisket, and half pound of ribs and a small order of beans.  OMG the beans were amazing, they were filled with brisket, soaking up bean juice, I want it in my face right now. Word to the wise, don't eat with your eyes, it is more filling then it looks when you were ordering. I had the meat sweats half way through....granted I also have no self control so I ignored the horrible stomach cramps and suffered the 3 hour meat coma in order to finish every bite.  Love the bottled cream soda to wash it all down, and",5.0
"We got here at 7:30 on a Friday night just before the crowd arrived and the hour-long wait in line began.  There's not a lot of seating so don't go with a very large group of friends like we did.  We ordered a pound of pulled pork and the large size burnt beans ($40), which for 2 people was more than enough.  The burnt beans had a nice spicy kick!  My only complaints were that 1). a bbq place had no mac n cheese and 2) german potato salad.  Definitely go with a few friends so you can try their food, we'll definitely be getting the beef cheeks and boar belly next time!",5.0
"I thought it would be better than it turned out to be given the millions of reviews and line out the door at 10 pm. Quality meats but all lacked that smoked, BBQ goodness. The pork belly was probably our fave. Even the sauces disappointed. As for sides, the beans are way too tangy and should be skipped; potato salad and half-sours were on point. It is also pricey: $97 for two people drinking 4 beers, taking home a small doggy bag, AND no table service. One and done spot but glad I crossed it off my list.",3.0
"Meh. Nothing crazy or special about this place. Their BBQ sauce taste like ketchup. Their other BBQ sauce tasted like chipotle. I had the brisket and pork belly and a few sides. The brisket didn't have the classic salty-ness I've come to expect and enjoy from most briskets. It actually tasted pretty bland and I felt like it was missing something. It hardly had any smoke flavor in it. The pork belly was not bad but again very little in the way of smoke flavoring. Maybe their idea of low and slow is a 2 or 3 hour smoke job. It is New York and everyone is in a rush. BTW what gives with not having pork ribs? I thought that was a BBQ standard? Anyway moving on. Oh no beef ribs either on my visit but back to my review.I think the raving reviews are probably more from the hippies enjoying themselves at the communal tables than the actual quality of the food or the atmosphere. After a while groups were just sitting at the tables talking although they had been done eating for over 20 minutes and there were people waiting to find a place to sit. Oblivious to the world around as most hipsters and hippies are they just sat there and continued to talk and bullshit while people waited with trays of food on their hands and having to eat standing up.I'm not big into the communal sitting thing either I don't understand the hype. I'd rather eat a place like Blue Smoke or Dinosaur BBQ any day over that mad house with mediocre food.Also, about the potato salad, I'm not sure what they were going for but I've never had anything like that. Again I wasn't impressed, think potatoes not fully cooked with light coating mayo some garden herbs and a sprinkle of mustard seed. Except when I say sprinkle I meant some jokester must have twisted the cap because that shit was covered in it! The broccoli uses the same exact seasoning as the potato salad. Both were cold which was expected of the potato salad but not the broccoli. The beans were really good and are the one thing I have no complaints about and can actually recommend with clear conscious. Anyone thinking of traveling from any where other than the immediate neighborhood just to try this because its been rated ""the best BBQ in New York City"" I recommend you pass unless you're a masochist that enjoys disappointment and overpaying.",1.0
"Fette Sau is just great.  The ribs are delicious.  Every time I have eaten there I have pretty much left with a food hangover.  One time I stuffed myself silly, until I literally felt drunk.  Probably wasn't the wisest decision to make, but bodamn...yummy.  Just go.  The only reason why I had to give them 4, and not 5 stars, is because I recently had better.  MIGHT QUINNS oooolala. SO many people know so LITTLE about food, and the fact that they are allowed to review restaurants on Yelp makes Yelp itself a faulty application.  I am tired of reading bad reviews for good restaurants.  Reviews that are based on silly issues such as 'Small Portions', or 'too expensive prices' , or the worst 'too hipster'.  You know what?  Get a job.  Make more money.  Stop Stuffing yourself.  Lastly, stop complaining about these so called 'hipsters' who have already come and gone.",4.0
"Bring your bibs!  This Carolina style BBQ  looks like and old run down garage, because it was!   DOnt let the drab rustic decor fool you, this ""hipster"" meatery is a gem in Brooklyn for some of the most tender fall off the bone BBQ youll find.Get ready to wait in line a good 30 minutes+ and tell your friends to grab and save seats.  The seating is long wooden park benches that are usually shared.Go right for the meat, heavily reccomending the brisket and my personal favorite the jowls(cheek). but im sure nothing will ever dissapoint.Skip the sides in my opinion.  I used to always get the potato salad but its mediocre at best.  better off with just meat and bread.Mouth is Salivating...",4.0

"From afar Fetta Sau seems like your favorite BBQ with a southern vibe. BUT  it is not worth your time. The meat was delicious but not worth the price. The most expensive item on the menu was the ribeye ($50 per lb.) so we opted to get a half pound, when we reached the counter the server said he can only do 1 pound cuts ! Talk about a scam! The vibe felt very commercial. Tourists were all over the place. A lot of moms and dads visiting their little hipsters.",1.0

Awesome BBQ of all types with good sides and lots of interesting beers. Casual and communal dining.  Almost across the street from The Knitting Factory.,5.0
"Great BBQ place for summer, with outdoor picnic tables. There are no table service, first come first serve base for tables. Just like Williamsburg style, very chill and relax. This place is always pack so if you are really hungry, eat something first just because the wait for ordering line could be half hour wait. They move fairly fast. Suggestion would be to come with a few friends, grab a table Space, grab a beer while waiting in line, take turn waiting in line. The brisket is a must, they cooked it so well that it literally melt in your mouth. And the beef ribs is awesome too, along with their burned bean as side.  So what to do after eating all these heavy meat BBQ? Grab a whiskey at their whiskey bar, they have a great selection of American whiskey, from rye to bourbon, perfect after a heavy meal of meats.",4.0

"Outstanding!!  Simply one of the best BBQ places in New York (and anywhere else for that matter.).  If your looking for fine dining this isn't the place but, if it's just the food that matters be prepared to wait on a line (that often snakes out the door), watch your food put on a metal tray sitting on top of a scale (everything is sold by weight) and then find a picnic table to sit down and eat.   My family always makes sure that we order extra to take home.  There is simply nothing better than their pulled pork on one of their soft dinner rolls @ midnight.  The bar w/ a wide selection of Single Malt Scotch's and draft beers is just a bonus.",5.0
"If you like BBQ and good whiskey you will have found heaven in Fette Sau. The Boy and I decided to trek out to Brooklyn because he'd been craving good BBQ for a while now. Both of us were Fette Sau virgins but aware of the hype surrounding this place. By the end of our dinner the only thing we were disappointed in was the inability to finish all of the food on our plates.The atmosphere is exactly how you'd expect it to be for a smokey market style BBQ joint in Williamsburg. It almost feels like you're in someones wood cottage, complete with faux fireplace. We rolled in on the early side (about 6pm) on a Thursday so had no issues with lines or grabbing seats. Thursdays are also Fat Pig Thursdays and the day the Pittmasters breakdown a whole smoked heritage pig! Yummmmm! Sorry Wilbur. If you like BBQ you really can't go wrong here - brisket, pork belly, ribs, pulled pork, everything was excellent (in that order)! If you don't like BBQ then I really don't even know why you're reading this review and considering going to a BBQ joint... The burnt-end baked beans are just as good as everyone says they are! probably the best baked beans I've ever had in my life. German potato salad and spicy sausage are both excellent too, I like my sausage spicy (that's what she said). There is a solid draft beer selection and a top notch whiskey selection. Really the most important piece of advice I can give you: COME HUNGRY!",5.0
"I had my eye on this place for a year and didn't check it out until this past Saturday. I would say this place is a 3.5, but I guess I'll round up compared to other BBQ places I've been to in the city and because of it's setup/ambiance.I had the beef brisket, which is prob the best brisket I've had in the city. I also had the pulled pork, which turned out to be a bit dry. Luckily they have sauces at the tables. The sauces are kind of tangy. I also had the broccoli salad as a side, which was really refreshing on a warm sunny day and was a good break in between mouthfuls of BBQ. They also leave on the stems and it was a little crunchy too, which I liked. The line wasn't too long since I went after lunch hours, like 2:30.How it works: You line up to order your food. You order by the pound, most things are around $18/lb. 1 lb + 1 side is pretty good for 2 people. You can pick up paper plates, silverware and wet naps when you pay. You also order drinks at the register. It's easier to have one person find a table and another order the food and drinks. The tables are communal and each table has a roll of paper towels and two containers of sauce. The restaurant is pretty good w/ making sure the paper towels are replaced because BBQ does get messy. Once you're done, you can just get up and leave.I'd def like to come back here and try the other things on the menu. The other things in the window looked amazing!",4.0
"This is the definition of pork on the fork!List of my favorites:*BEEF BRISKET *pulled pork shouder*pork ribs*spicy sausage*broccoli salad (be aware that this is chilled)List of not-my-favorites:*the pork belly was a bit toooo fatty for me, so I don't usually order this again*beef ribs - was a little dry when I tried it, may have been a bad batch, but I was disappointed.This is a first come, first serve, communal eating establishment. I would not recommend arriving here hungry or starving, because of the 3 times I ate here, I waited in like for about or at least an hour before sitting down to get down to business on that brisket!The menu changes as they please, so you can call ahead to see what's on the menu for the day. I personally, would not come if they do not have beef brisket on the menu, it is a must every time!I have not tried the chicken or the german potato salad (I also heard is chilled, I prefer my taters at room temp). I did hear that the chicken is well seasoned and juicy, so that may make my list. Everything is done by weight, which always causes me to put pounds of unnecessary BBQ on my platter, but you can take leftovers home too! This place is a seller of all things whiskey and beer. Try out some new whiskey, grab a gallon of beer and eat the best BBQ in NYC!",4.0
"* Some of the best BBQ I've had in NY (though that's not saying all that much, haha). * The wait can be a little long most of the time* Their BBQ sauce is decent but not the best. The meat is quite good though.* To be expected, but if you sit inside you and everything with you will smell like meat when you leave.* First come first serve family style seating, so probably not best for a large group at peak hours, but a great place to grab a beer and some BBQ with a friend or two.",4.0

You really have to LOOK for this place as its cleverly disguised as a shitty Williamsburg hole-in-the-wall.Everything here was incredible.  Blows my previous BBQ favorite - Long Beach's Swinbellys - out of the water!   You have to get the beans.  They contain a cornucopia of all the meats of the day.Come early 4-5 as seating is limited and it fills quickly.,5.0
Awesome BBQ of all types with good sides and lots of interesting beers. Casual and communal dining.  Almost across the street from The Knitting Factory.,5.0
"Great BBQ place for summer, with outdoor picnic tables. There are no table service, first come first serve base for tables. Just like Williamsburg style, very chill and relax. This place is always pack so if you are really hungry, eat something first just because the wait for ordering line could be half hour wait. They move fairly fast. Suggestion would be to come with a few friends, grab a table Space, grab a beer while waiting in line, take turn waiting in line. The brisket is a must, they cooked it so well that it literally melt in your mouth. And the beef ribs is awesome too, along with their burned bean as side.  So what to do after eating all these heavy meat BBQ? Grab a whiskey at their whiskey bar, they have a great selection of American whiskey, from rye to bourbon, perfect after a heavy meal of meats.",4.0
Angus brisket and ribs ribs ribs!!! Amazing place to get your protein for the month!!,5.0
"Outstanding!!  Simply one of the best BBQ places in New York (and anywhere else for that matter.).  If your looking for fine dining this isn't the place but, if it's just the food that matters be prepared to wait on a line (that often snakes out the door), watch your food put on a metal tray sitting on top of a scale (everything is sold by weight) and then find a picnic table to sit down and eat.   My family always makes sure that we order extra to take home.  There is simply nothing better than their pulled pork on one of their soft dinner rolls @ midnight.  The bar w/ a wide selection of Single Malt Scotch's and draft beers is just a bonus.",5.0
"If you like BBQ and good whiskey you will have found heaven in Fette Sau. The Boy and I decided to trek out to Brooklyn because he'd been craving good BBQ for a while now. Both of us were Fette Sau virgins but aware of the hype surrounding this place. By the end of our dinner the only thing we were disappointed in was the inability to finish all of the food on our plates.The atmosphere is exactly how you'd expect it to be for a smokey market style BBQ joint in Williamsburg. It almost feels like you're in someones wood cottage, complete with faux fireplace. We rolled in on the early side (about 6pm) on a Thursday so had no issues with lines or grabbing seats. Thursdays are also Fat Pig Thursdays and the day the Pittmasters breakdown a whole smoked heritage pig! Yummmmm! Sorry Wilbur. If you like BBQ you really can't go wrong here - brisket, pork belly, ribs, pulled pork, everything was excellent (in that order)! If you don't like BBQ then I really don't even know why you're reading this review and considering going to a BBQ joint...

"Not consistent, which is unfortunate since I had such high expectations after my first visit. I've gone at least 3 times now, and the last time it was just okay - I got pork, brisket, and baked beans. All items were just okay. Always a long line, I just grab a drink first and wait.",3.0
"Arguably one of the main reasons for Manhattanites to make the journey all the way to Williamsburg (although Mighty Quinn's has since obviated this excuse to sojourn to Brooklyn). The brisket, the sausage, the sides, the sauces...I love this place. Definitely needs to be included in any NYC barbecue lover's portfolio of eating joints.",5.0
"Good but a bit pricey for BBQ. The price I usually pay over here for a simple plate of meat and a beer is roughly between 40-50 bucks. It gets really crowded in here. It's best to come right when they open, otherwise you'll be waiting in the cold for a very long period.The service is here is pretty good. They have a decent variety of meats to choose from. It's definitely nothing compared to Texas or any other type of BBQ joint in the south.Verdict - It's a type of place I would try out once or twice. Other than that, save your money and explore other places. Hipsters in Williamsburg seem to love it but I don't. It's too small and I don't like the hipster atmosphere.",3.0
"I am looking forward to my next trip to Fette Sau. When I popped in it was 30 mins before they closed so a lot of the good stuff was gone for the day. The staff was really accommodating and didn't give us a hard time for being those jerks that come in at the last minute. We ordered a few different things they had: pulled pork, ribs and brisket. The meat was meh actually... a bit too dry. I am going to assume that it usually isn't like that here because I am really looking forward to trying it again. We also tried the beans and potato salad. The potatoes were great but the beans were definitely not for me... my friend totally gobbled them down though. The staff was nice, the layout is cool and it is definitely a popular place.. usually the line is nuts here!!

"Like others have said, I have wanted to try this place for three years.  Being that I live in Jerz and am always in the city, BK has always been kinda out of the way.  However, an opportunity presented itself that landed us in Brooklyn and this was tops on our list.First, they open at 5 during the week, so note the hours of operation.  I forgot this and we had to kill about an hour plus cuz we got there early.  Second, know that the menu changes on a daily basis, so what you may come for may not be offered on a given day, unless there is a rotation that I am unaware of.Now for the food.  We ordered the brisket, pulled pork, pork cheeks, pork chops, beans, and broccoli salad.  The brisket, OH MAN THE BRISKET!!  Must say this is close to the best brisket I've had.  It was extremely tender and really rich in flavor.  The BBQ sauce is fantastic, but not necessary since the brisket had so much flavor.  The pulled pork was equally good and great with the complimentary rolls.  The pork cheeks were a great added bonus.  I think I read a few reviews saying that they were not great, but these were the second best part of the meal.  Luckily the meat man highly recommended them and we obliged!!  The chops were good, but fourth on the list with the other heavy hitters.  The beans were good and really filling.  The broccoli salad was good.  It was steamed then served cold.  All in all, a great visit and definately be back.  only thing is that the food is so rich and filling, don't be afraid to take some home.  We didn't order too much, but it was SUPER GOOD!!",5.0

"Jesus -- this place was so intense. Whiskey bar and pound after pound of meat. The brisket, pork belly, pork ribs, pulled pork... oh god. All so good. Even the biscuits were good.

"Yes, this place lives up to all the hypes.For all you BBQ lovers out there, this place is heaven on earth.  No frills, it actually looks like an entrance to someone's backyard from the outside.  Wait time varies a lot, I was in line for an hour the first time and went right to the front the second time.  To cut the wait, I'd recommend going for lunch instead of dinner and when weather is crappy (it was drizzling the second time I went).The meat - I highly recommend Brisket and Beef Ribs.  Brisket is so tender and juicy, seasoned to perfection.  Ribs fell right off the bone and is very flavorful.  Tip on the BBQ sauce - try mixing the sweet and the spicy, it gives you the same kick with a hint of sweetness.  Tasty.Sides - if you still have capacity after the meats, try their potato salad.  I would skip the pickles as they taste like nothing more than salty cucumbers.Simply put, pretty damn good BBQ that's worth a trip from midtown.",5.0

"I've never actually used the phrase ""stick to your ribs,"" but I'm going to go ahead and break the seal for Fette Sau's baked beans. Holy hearty!

"Holy shit, the pork belly is food from the Gods. BBQ purists can say whatever they want about NY BBQ, but let me just say that we are doing some freaking amazing stuff these days. I don't know of many other places doing BBQ pork belly. Jesus christ, when I took my first bite my head almost exploded from the happiness running through my whole body.A thick layer of fatty goodness is encasing large slabs of pork belly. You tell the dude behind the counter to slice you up a half pound and watch as the fatty juices soak the brown paper as he places your succulent slices on it. They give you a few wonderful potato rolls if you want to assemble a sandwich. A great gesture, but with this type of masterpiece you are better off eating it in its purest state, sans bread. The outside was like burnt ends with a great crispy bark. And of course the inside was a melty gelatinous foodgasm of meaty deliciousness. I polished it off in literally 5 minutes flat. Did I fell guilty? Not really. My only regret was I didn't get another half pound. Definitely warrants a return back just for the pork belly.

I want a table!)Wow like night and day Fette Sau is weekday vs. weekend. I much prefer quiet Monday nights and cue. We arrived with an abundance of tables to choose from, a sight unimaginable during the peak hipster hours of soaking up a hangover. The line was relatively short (a good 15 ft from the register) and everyone's eyes weren't ready to rip the piece of cue off of my fork. All in all, Fette Sau is a chill place to be on a Monday night. I was able to enjoy my sausage without anyone breathing down my neck to move over or pressuring me to finish my meal in record time.For four people, we chipped in about $20/head and were sufficiently stuffed with a sausage each, large sides of German potato salad and burnt ends baked beans, sodas, a half lb of pork shoulder, pulled pork, boneless beef ribs and brisket, and a qtr lb of pork ribs. It was just the right amount and we slathered it all in barbeque sauce. A few dots of the spicy were enough to make us go whew! It was good and I still stand by my favorite- the brisket. Everything else can kinda kiss it. Fette Sau is awesome. Highly recommend for groups and a good time. The open air of it all is priceless. Plus the picnic tables kinda make it feel like a real bbq.

"I went to Fette Sau this past Monday night around 7:30pm and hit it at exactly the right time. There was no line and we were able to get a table right away. 5 minutes later, a line formed and people were scrambling.

This was probably the ideal amount of food for me, but I could have definitely been a little piggie (sau?) and ordered another 1/4 lb. of meat. They use a dry rub on all their meats, but there are 2 types of BBQ sauce at the tables. The red one is sweet and the brown one is spicy. Take my advice and mix them both together. The brisket was absolutely hands down the best I have ever tasted. I would like to qualify this however; I have never had authentic Southern BBQ, I grew up in New Jersey, and they gave me a crust piece. All that being said, I stand by my claim. The meat was so succulent and flavorful, and the texture was perfect, fall of the bone, shredded. The sausage was delicious as well. It was plump and with the crisp ""skin"" casing that you want from a sausage. I was a little underwhelmed with the German potato salad. I had eaten such great potato salad in Munich that I expected this to be similar. It wasn't. There were mustard seeds, and the temperature seemed too cold. Oh well. I am not a fan of baked beans, but my friends all raved about them. So if you're into beans, then go for it.I will definitely be back, and I'm sure I will not luck out with the line/table like I did this past time.

"Fette Sau (which means Fat Pig in German, in case you weren't already self conscious of your fat behind) is a true gem in Williamsburg. My favorite food there is the beef brisket and the pulled pork. They serve the food in true 'the world should feel a little miserable' hipster fashion by giving you the cheapest piece of sliced white bread they could find and the food is piled on prison style, on a metal tray with a piece of waxed paper over it. The communal long wooden tables are perfect for those who love sharing rolls of paper towels with complete strangers (there are no napkins, too mainstream). There are barrels on tap of fully flavored, on-the-house, toilet water in case your cheap self needs to quench your thirst. The sides are nothing special. The burnt beans are true to their name and the pickles are disappointing. Seating is reserved for those who love long lines as much as their hipster beards and grandpa hats. The beer selection could use some improvement, as would the condiments. There are other good BBQ places in Brooklyn worth checking out - but this is quickly becoming a Williamsburg staple and rightfully so.",4.0
The food is extremely overpriced. The barbecue guy was not very friendly. Nothing special I make better barbecue in my backyard,3.0
"The place is a low-carber's dream.My boyfriend insisted on our short stay in New York that we *had* to eat at Fette Sau.He even went so far as to insist it is his favorite restaurant in the entire WORLD, and coming from someone who has been nearly everywhere, I had high hopes.Considering I haven't been out of the country, I can't say this is my favorite restaurant in the world, but it is definitely the best meat I've ever had.We went on a Sunday and he misread the website, so we got there about a half hour early and ended up being the creepy tourists (complete with rollie-bags) just hanging outside the fence for a half hour... but the dude who saw us twice or thrice was super-nice about it.We lucked out and the only person in front of us was some guy that went in while the gate was still closed, but the line began to form pretty much immediately after we arrived, so I can see how some people would be a bit annoyed with having to wait that long.Even if I go back (which I will, whenever I happen to be in NY again) and there's a super-long line, I will have no problem waiting.I dig the communal seating.  The atmosphere is really casual and the employees I encountered were really chill and helpful.As far as specifics, we had the pork belly, pulled pork, beef ribs, and brisket. With each bite of a new meat I kept changing my mind on which I liked the best, but I finally decided that the pork belly was my absolute favorite.We don't use sauces, but this meat didn't need any sauce and I feel if we did use it, we wouldn't have gotten the full, delicious flavor anyway.THe only thing I wasn't stoked on was the broccoli salad.  The broccoli was crisp and fresh-tasting, but I didn't like the sauce.  But really, who cares about that?  I didn't go to a BBQ restaurant to eat rabbit food anyway!",5.0
"Awesome BBQ. It looks like they converted an old garage shop into a BBQ restaurant and I believe that's actually what they did.

"This place was great! I recommend taking a group here, especially when it's nice outside. The decor and atmosphere is hipster casual with a Texas flare. Love that red checkered tablecloth. The beans were stellar, and although my brisket was a bit dry, everyone else's was moist and delicious. I don't recommend the pulled pork or the pork belly though - it wasn't bad, it just wasn't as good as everything else! There's bizarrely no corn bread (hmmmm), which seems like a staple to me. BUT, that being said, I've come back for more and I'm sure I will again! PRO TIP: Designate one member of your group to be the ""seat getter"". It gets packed.",4.0
"I have been here a few times, always grabbing some brisket, potato salad, and baked beans.  I've never been disappointed (I'm from New England, so BBQ isn't exactly what we're known for), as the meat's always been tender and the sides have good seasoning to them.  I also appreciate that they have a good craft beer selection.",4.0
"Did you just call me Fat Sow? This is the worst food hangover I've had in awhile. After waiting in line for about an hour, downing about 2 growlers amongst 3 people, we finally ordered pulled pork, brisket, spicy sausage, gigantor dinosaur short ribs, pork ribs, pork belly, oh and of course sides of chili baked beans, german potato salad and broccoli... AND another gallon growler. The brisket was unfortunately slightly dry, but I just ignored it and devoured the amazing fall off the bone ribs and snappy spicy sausage and succulent pork belly. Though my companions in gluttony loved the sides, they were kinda an afterthought to me. Needed to save room in my bellay for as much smoked meats as possible.Ya, the line was long, but it kind of adds to the experience and anticipation. I enjoyed the beer and the smells while hanging out in line, and the wait only heightened my food excitement. I was not disappointed at all.",4.0
"I came here for a birthday party recently and had a great time! I've been here before in the past and have the same issues...The seating is on a first come first serve which is definitely nice, but could get a bit annoying if there is a large party (like ours!) that keeps order more and more drinks and doesn't leave (sorry!!!). I would say that the food and drinks are overpriced though.. I guess that's the price you have to pay though in NYC to get good bbq!Here are a few tips:- the brisket and pork belly is a must!- the sausage is great and comes with buns (which are great!)- baked beans are a must as well! I don't even love beans, but they are soo good here!- no need to get the cole slaw and veggies.. they're good, but not the best. - you can pack your left overs to take home.. makes a great snack!- they have beer, but also a great selection of bourbon etc if you're into that! - this is a total hipster joint!",4.0
"Not balanced. Mega bucks. I had ONE beef rib and a small broccoli salad. It was $25 (I tipped $3 on $22).  I drank tap water. Not kidding. I am fine for spending on great food but this is a bit extreme. Especially considering I probably paid about $10 for the bone in the one rib. Anyway- yeah it was pretty good. The meat was delicious when I could find it. I love beef fat, but again, I probably spent another chunk of dollars on pure fat. The fat wasn't at all rendered and though kept the beef insanely moist, it was a little grotesque. Same broccoli. Absolutely drenched, drowning in olive oil. Delicious yes. But really, if the ENTIRE thing is fat it just ain't balanced. I am not squeamish. I am not an eating disorder girl. In fact I am going to buy a cookie at Salties. This was just unpleasant. My mouth is coated in cow.",2.0
"You wouldnt think much of this place if you just walked past it. What used to be an auto body shop (from the looks of it) was converted into an awesome restaurant that does southern bbq the best you could in NYC. Its not the biggest venue which is the shame because so many people come here and Ive opted not eating here a few times because its always crowded and well its Williamsburg and when you wanna eat there is always someplace else. Having said that though, Im always sad when I have to do so. It has those wooden patio benches on the outside and you end up sitting next to strangers sometimes if its too crowded and theres only 2 of you. For some people that would suck but its a great way to meet people and people are friendly there. The food is awesome. The great thing is you dont pay for the item as a whole, you pay by the weight. So you get a huge tray, get a little of this, a little of that, ... a little MORE of that, then you pay for the tray. Its a clever idea and the food is yummy. I love their brisket, baked beans, and omg their rolls are to die for. We kept on getting more of those even after all the meat was gone!Their drinks are great too. They also have different sized.

"Fette Sau (which means Fat Pig in German, in case you weren't already self conscious of your fat behind) is a true gem in Williamsburg. My favorite food there is the beef brisket and the pulled pork. They serve the food in true 'the world should feel a little miserable' hipster fashion by giving you the cheapest piece of sliced white bread they could find and the food is piled on prison style, on a metal tray with a piece of waxed paper over it. The communal long wooden tables are perfect for those who love sharing rolls of paper towels with complete strangers (there are no napkins, too mainstream). There are barrels on tap of fully flavored, on-the-house, toilet water in case your cheap self needs to quench your thirst. The sides are nothing special. The burnt beans are true to their name and the pickles are disappointing. Seating is reserved for those who love long lines as much as their hipster beards and grandpa hats. The beer selection could use some improvement, as would the condiments. There are other good BBQ places in Brooklyn worth checking out - but this is quickly becoming a Williamsburg staple and rightfully so.",4.0
The food is extremely overpriced. The barbecue guy was not very friendly. Nothing special I make better barbecue in my backyard,3.0
"The place is a low-carber's dream.My boyfriend insisted on our short stay in New York that we *had* to eat at Fette Sau.He even went so far as to insist it is his favorite restaurant in the entire WORLD, and coming from someone who has been nearly everywhere, I had high hopes.Considering I haven't been out of the country, I can't say this is my favorite restaurant in the world, but it is definitely the best meat I've ever had.We went on a Sunday and he misread the website, so we got there about a half hour early and ended up being the creepy tourists (complete with rollie-bags) just hanging outside the fence for a half hour... but the dude who saw us twice or thrice was super-nice about it.We lucked out and the only person in front of us was some guy that went in while the gate was still closed, but the line began to form pretty much immediately after we arrived, so I can see how some people would be a bit annoyed with having to wait that long.Even if I go back (which I will, whenever I happen to be in NY again) and there's a super-long line, I will have no problem waiting.I dig the communal seating.  The atmosphere is really casual and the employees I encountered were really chill and helpful.As far as specifics, we had the pork belly, pulled pork, beef ribs, and brisket. With each bite of a new meat I kept changing my mind on which I liked the best, but I finally decided that the pork belly was my absolute favorite.We don't use sauces, but this meat didn't need any sauce and I feel if we did use it, we wouldn't have gotten the full, delicious flavor anyway.THe only thing I wasn't stoked on was the broccoli salad.  The broccoli was crisp and fresh-tasting, but I didn't like the sauce.  But really, who cares about that?  I didn't go to a BBQ restaurant to eat rabbit food anyway!",5.0
"Awesome BBQ. It looks like they converted an old garage shop into a BBQ restaurant and I believe that's actually what they did. You order by the pound they throw everything onto a lunch tray and weigh it. Everything was so good, especially the baked beans. Some of the best BBQ I've ever had anywhere!",5.0
"This place was great! I recommend taking a group here, especially when it's nice outside. The decor and atmosphere is hipster casual with a Texas flare. Love that red checkered tablecloth. The beans were stellar, and although my brisket was a bit dry, everyone else's was moist and delicious. I don't recommend the pulled pork or the pork belly though - it wasn't bad, it just wasn't as good as everything else! There's bizarrely no corn bread (hmmmm), which seems like a staple to me. BUT, that being said, I've come back for more and I'm sure I will again! PRO TIP: Designate one member of your group to be the ""seat getter"". It gets packed.",4.0
"I have been here a few times, always grabbing some brisket, potato salad, and baked beans.  I've never been disappointed (I'm from New England, so BBQ isn't exactly what we're known for), as the meat's always been tender and the sides have good seasoning to them.  I also appreciate that they have a good craft beer selection.",4.0
"Did you just call me Fat Sow? This is the worst food hangover I've had in awhile. After waiting in line for about an hour, downing about 2 growlers amongst 3 people, we finally ordered pulled pork, brisket, spicy sausage, gigantor dinosaur short ribs, pork ribs, pork belly, oh and of course sides of chili baked beans, german potato salad and broccoli... AND another gallon growler. The brisket was unfortunately slightly dry, but I just ignored it and devoured the amazing fall off the bone ribs and snappy spicy sausage and succulent pork belly. Though my companions in gluttony loved the sides, they were kinda an afterthought to me. Needed to save room in my bellay for as much smoked meats as possible.Ya, the line was long, but it kind of adds to the experience and anticipation. I enjoyed the beer and the smells while hanging out in line, and the wait only heightened my food excitement. I was not disappointed at all.",4.0
"I came here for a birthday party recently and had a great time! I've been here before in the past and have the same issues...The seating is on a first come first serve which is definitely nice, but could get a bit annoying if there is a large party (like ours!) that keeps order more and more drinks and doesn't leave (sorry!!!). I would say that the food and drinks are overpriced though.. I guess that's the price you have to pay though in NYC to get good bbq!Here are a few tips:- the brisket and pork belly is a must!- the sausage is great and comes with buns (which are great!)- baked beans are a must as well! I don't even love beans, but they are soo good here!- no need to get the cole slaw and veggies.. they're good, but not the best. - you can pack your left overs to take home.. makes a great snack!- they have beer, but also a great selection of bourbon etc if you're into that! - this is a total hipster joint!",4.0
"Not balanced. Mega bucks. I had ONE beef rib and a small broccoli salad. It was $25 (I tipped $3 on $22).  I drank tap water. Not kidding. I am fine for spending on great food but this is a bit extreme. Especially considering I probably paid about $10 for the bone in the one rib. Anyway- yeah it was pretty good. The meat was delicious when I could find it. I love beef fat, but again, I probably spent another chunk of dollars on pure fat. The fat wasn't at all rendered and though kept the beef insanely moist, it was a little grotesque. Same broccoli. Absolutely drenched, drowning in olive oil. Delicious yes. But really, if the ENTIRE thing is fat it just ain't balanced. I am not squeamish. I am not an eating disorder girl. In fact I am going to buy a cookie at Salties. This was just unpleasant. My mouth is coated in cow.",2.0
"You wouldnt think much of this place if you just walked past it. What used to be an auto body shop (from the looks of it) was converted into an awesome restaurant that does southern bbq the best you could in NYC. Its not the biggest venue which is the shame because so many people come here and Ive opted not eating here a few times because its always crowded and well its Williamsburg and when you wanna eat there is always someplace else. Having said that though, Im always sad when I have to do so. It has those wooden patio benches on the outside and you end up sitting next to strangers sometimes if its too crowded and theres only 2 of you. For some people that would suck but its a great way to meet people and people are friendly there. The food is awesome. The great thing is you dont pay for the item as a whole, you pay by the weight.

"Mmm, bar-be-cue...!We arrived on a weekday at 6pm; perfect because it wasn't packed and the line wasn't out the door as it can get. There were no seats initially, but by the time we got to the front of the line, a seat opened up - yippee! We ordered the brisket, lamb belly, Peking duck, spicy sausage and as sides, sauerkraut, pickles and baked beans. We also got a gallon of the Brooklyn IPA. (That's right, a gallon! It was awesome. *teehee*)The duck and sausage were delicious (the lamb was salty IMO), but the brisket! - omg, the brisket! - SO. SO. GOOD. It's definitely a must, must, must-try. There are various sauces on the table for the meats, not necessarily needed, but good to have. The one spicy sauce they had was very good, as was the mustard. Of the sides, the baked beans were fantastic. I'm not really a fan of baked beans, but these have so much flavor (probably from the bits of meat they put in there)... a perfect complement to the meal.  I also enjoyed the sauerkraut; it cuts through all the meatiness (for lack of a better word). The pickles did as well, and they were very crunchy, but kinda bland in flavor - I'm not sure if I'd get it again. Now that the weather is nice, I'm definitely going back soon and sitting outdoors... and eating massive amounts of brisket.",5.0

"I've been stopping in Fette Sau on and off for a few years now, usually getting BBQ to go.  While their BBQ is good, the overall experience of going there to eat is a drag. You'd think that because there is a long line out the door the food must be amazing. But I realized tonight what the problem is: they only take care of ONE SINGLE customer at a time between the point where you pick out your meats until you pay for it. This is sooo inefficient.  Then, of course, you have to wait again at the bar to order drinks, wait while you try to find a place to sit when you have a tray full of food in your hands, and finally eat on terribly thin paper plates -- if you remember to grab them before you sit down, that is, because they don't automatically hand them out. If Fette Sau would give up forcing people to wait line to order their food, let people take a seat when they arrive, and hire a few waitresses to take everyone's order, the experience would be soooo much better and more efficient. It would probably make them a lot more money too. Because for all that time that people spend waiting in line, customers could be sitting down and drinking a beer or two while they wait for their food. I'm surprised the owners haven't figured this out yet.",3.0

Cool that the beer comes in glass mason jars though it was annoying since they don't have smooth drinking lips.I came for a friend's birthday party and she ordered a gluttonous amount of meat and sides. It came with 40 potato rolls and the food could've fed an entire city somewhere. However, the group of 10-15 gorged on what seemed like endless amounts of pulled pork, beef brisket, spicy sausages, beef tongue, pork ribs and various sides. There were a few different sauces on the table which you could slather  your food in--I believe one was standard BBQ and the other was a chipotle BBQ which packed a bit of heat. All in all, the food was pretty good quality with a few standouts. The beef brisket was really tender and flavorful as was the pulled pork. The sausages were nothing special and the ribs lacked the juiciness that I've found at other BBQ establishments. The sides were not very memorable, though I only tried a few. Beans looked the most promising but I didn't get a chance to indulge.I personally like Hill Country better since the wait is nowhere near as long and the food is similar in quality.

"Great BBQ! The bar:  Fette Sau has a dizzying bourbon/whiskey list (including VanWinkle!) as well as a blackboard with themed flights (1 oz) - at around $15-20 per flight of 3, its a nice way to expand one's palette without emptying the wallet.. The bar area also has some dangerously-inspired creative beer tap handles made from various butcher knives/forks (watched 2 people taking pics of them while I sat, so I'm sure there's enough photos of them already here..) and were pouring a good mix of local beers (SixPoint, Brooklyn, Cottrell, Green Point, etc) and hard cider (nothing goes with BBQ pork like cider!)  The drafts are all served in jars, and a nice touch is you can buy any volume from a half pint to a gallon (obviously NOT served in a jar).The 'Q: Prices are listed by the pound, so don't be dismayed when you see the board. The carver was friendly and helpful, and weighed every portion perfectly - not to miss mentioning, items that weren't carved (baked beans, pulled pork, etc) were stirred before pulling out each serving, ensuring a good mixture each time. The beef brisket was mouth-watering and needed no sauce whatsoever. Pulled pork was equally tasty but even better with their sauce. The pork belly had run out while I waited in line, but they brought out sirloin tips (my favorite!) right as I got to the counter - WIN!  The sides shouldn't be forgotten either: smokey mac & cheese, burnt ends baked beans (with bits of ""unintentionally"" dropped pulled pork inside - NOT a complaint), collard greens, all delicious. Things I'd change: The only lacking factor here is the absence of waitstaff: you have to que up (sorry couldn't resist) on a painfully slow moving line which varied from almost no wait (maybe 5 mins) to an excruciating 30+ in the approx 2 hours that I spent there. With a group of people you may want to pool cash, write orders, and then draw straws to see who's gotta wait and who gets to chill at the long picnic tables set up all over. If you're not completely heartless, maybe buy em a beer to keep company with.. Whole pig roasts first Thursday of every month!  I can't wait for pig cheeks!",4.0

"got the pulled pork, pork belly, and brisket with my friend. waited about 30 minutes on line to get our food. definitely hard to find seating during the prime hours. i'm not an avid beer drinker but their brooklyn ipa beer was good enough for me wanting more.",4.0
"Good Food, Good services, love the setup, food came up really fast and the services was amazing..",4.0
Best BBQ in NYC. The brisket is the best I ever had in my life. The pork belly is awesome and the flavor burst in your mouth. Hands down the best BBQ I ever had and strongly recommend this spot to any BBQ aficionado. The broccoli is my favorite side dish and the selection of bourbon is impressive! This place has to be in everyone's bucket list.,5.0
"It was okay.I went to splurge calories and cash at this place for my birthday. My girlfriend has been talking about this place ever since we met; I was excited.The atmosphere was great; I love picnic tables! And they have a pretty impressive assortment of whisky and beer. But the food, was only okay. Definitely not the best BBQ I've had in NYC. I'd come back with some friends to enjoy their beer with some brisket but wouldn't wait in line for it. Maybe I would for the baked beans..",3.0
"I'm not going to ruin the high reviews of this place because I'm a vegetarian. It did make for an awkward ordering experience though.""Can I have two orders of broccoli, some potato salad and a beverage?""I literally got stares from three servers all at once.Anyways, they have a bar with nice cheap wine and pricey soda (da fuck). I remember the line was at least 30-40 people deep when we went. Sweet Jesus, I wish I ate meat. Love the smell of this place. It honestly feels like a community barbecue in someone's backyard.",4.0
"Great BBQ! The bar:  Fette Sau has a dizzying bourbon/whiskey list (including VanWinkle!) as well as a blackboard with themed flights (1 oz) - at around $15-20 per flight of 3, its a nice way to expand one's palette without emptying the wallet.. The bar area also has some dangerously-inspired creative beer tap handles made from various butcher knives/forks (watched 2 people taking pics of them while I sat, so I'm sure there's enough photos of them already here..) and were pouring a good mix of local beers (SixPoint, Brooklyn, Cottrell, Green Point, etc) and hard cider (nothing goes with BBQ pork like cider!)  The drafts are all served in jars, and a nice touch is you can buy any volume from a half pint to a gallon (obviously NOT served in a jar).The 'Q: Prices are listed by the pound, so don't be dismayed when you see the board. The carver was friendly and helpful, and weighed every portion perfectly - not to miss mentioning, items that weren't carved (baked beans, pulled pork, etc) were stirred before pulling out each serving, ensuring a good mixture each time. The beef brisket was mouth-watering and needed no sauce whatsoever. Pulled pork was equally tasty but even better with their sauce. The pork belly had run out while I waited in line, but they brought out sirloin tips (my favorite!) right as I got to the counter - WIN!  The sides shouldn't be forgotten either: smokey mac & cheese, burnt ends baked beans (with bits of ""unintentionally"" dropped pulled pork inside - NOT a complaint), collard greens, all delicious. Things I'd change: The only lacking factor here is the absence of waitstaff: you have to que up (sorry couldn't resist) on a painfully slow moving line which varied from almost no wait (maybe 5 mins) to an excruciating 30+ in the approx 2 hours that I spent there. With a group of people you may want to pool cash, write orders, and then draw straws to see who's gotta wait and who gets to chill at the long picnic tables set up all over. If you're not completely heartless, maybe buy em a beer to keep company with.. Whole pig roasts first Thursday of every month!  I can't wait for pig cheeks!",4.0
"My son took me there for father's day and it was really worth the trip. I usually don't like to go anywhere that I can't get parking but it wasn't a terrible trip on the subways. I live at the opposite end of Brooklyn so it was over an hour.We came once before to find that they only do lunch on weekends. The wait in line was slow moving but the food was worth waiting for. We had samples of almost everything as they let you get whatever you want by the pound. The duck was my favorite even though the ribs are as good as I've ever eaten. The flavor was in the meat and I didn't feel the need to add any sauce. Potato salad and beans were excellent as well. They didn't have any pork ribs on the menu today and am not sure if they carry it. The wait staff (behind the counter) were friendly enough and actually looked the part almost if they were picked by their looks. They have another place across the street, St Anselm, that I want to try next. I understand they have outstanding steaks. Try it, you'll love it.",5.0

Not a huge fan of the ribs, but they seriously know how to make damn good barbecue. Ordered the beans in hopes they would be saucy but they were a little bit too dry for my taste. Indoor seating is communal tables. Fun to get some delicious meats and share a table with strangers who seem pretty nice and respectful. Service is what it is. You aren't there for table service. You are there to order your food and sit down. They are polite! Not overly friendly, which fits their style. Definitely coming back here!!

"BBQ pulled pork is my favorite food so I was beyond excited to try out this restaurant after a friend's recommendation. Our group waited in line for AN HOUR AND A HALF (got there at 6:30PM and waited until 8:10PM) to get our food. Luckily we hadn't seen our friends in a while so half of the time flew by. Once you get near the front of the line you're standing directly beside a dining table to your left and the restrooms to your right. Super congested in line and not everyone is very friendly. My pulled pork was good but nothing to ever wait in line for. I felt really bad because my accompanying friends got foods that they loved (pork belly), but we all agreed in the end that the wait was a little ridiculous. Also to note, as we were leaving the restaurant at approximately 9PM, the line had grown since we stood in it at 6:30PM. So if you're wondering if my ridiculous wait time was just because I chose to go at ""prime eatin' time"" you would be mistaken.",3.0
"The meat was good. (Just good, not great. I know places within walking distance that would beat it). What really pissed me off was the sides. I ordered the broccoli salad and the potato salad, each of which was inedible. At $5-6 a piece this is unacceptable, even for BBQ place sides. Don't waste your time and money. Go elsewhere.",1.0

The worker was very nice, and actually asked us if we wanted our meat to be meaty or more fatty. I personally like a little bit of both, we tried to pulled pork, brisket and beef belly.

"GOOD GOD YES. Is there better pulled pork then this? I think not....Great Brooklyn BBQ, also excellent Brooklyn IPA on tap. The ambiance is very casual and communal (if you don't mind sitting next to complete strangers who may be a little tipsy, but jovial - then this is definitely the place for you). The food is amazing, with generous portions for the sides - the small baked beans was more than enough for two people. Other reviewers are right in that it can get a little crazy with the line, however, the food is definitely worth it. We went on New Year's Eve, and it wasn't too bad at all - had to wait in line for about 25 minutes, but we stopped at the bar and drank our drinks in line for the food.

"Let start from the point me and my friend get to the table, I've got an older menu, so when the waitress came to the table to take an order we said we are ready, but after my turn I've started realizing that they don't have the stuff I mentioned.

Finally, they charge $9 per shot and it states in the menu that they serve 50ml, but we have got regular 30ml shot glasses.

"Brooklyn Based BBQ that went up and beyond!Pretty good bbq. For those from the south, I would compare the quality to that of Rudy's.  FOOD:Very delicious and they are good at their craft. We tried as much as we could without breaking our bank lol! We had the - Pork Ribs ($16/lb) - We had 2 ribs however many lbs that was- Sasuage Links ($4 per link) - Got 1 link- Brisket ($19/lb) - We had 1/2 a lb- Pork Belly ($19/lb) - We had 1/2 a lbAll the prices are subject to change depending on season/market values. Everything well season and well cooked. The hyped pork belly was tasty and fatty depending on which cut you get. But the brisket was the winner here! That is a must eat! If you get a nice cut, it can be fatty and juicy! The ribs were decently fall of the bone type-esque as well. Maybe not the softest type you will have if you go to the south like Rudy's or Saltlick but still pretty good. The price is on the pricey side, but hey, this is New York and somewhat expected. SERVICE:Just like any other type of BBQ/smoke house. Buffet/stand in line order type.ATMOSPHERE:Had a refurbished warehouse vibe. Brick wall partitions with metal/wooden bench seats and counters with a LCD TV. There is a clear garage door closed when we went, but it most likely can open up and the restaurant can open to the outdoors.  Nice design tying in the inside with the outside if that is true.  SUMMARY:Delicious BBQ but a tad bit pricey.  If you are willing to shell out the dollar bills, then you will NOT be disappointed. This Williamsburg original will get you going with all your taste buds going full throttle! I suggest trying the brisket, porkbelly and pork ribs the first time.",4.0

"I don't normally travel to Brooklyn, but as a dedicated fan of great BBQ, I was willing to take a trip out to the land of the hipsters (Williamsburg) to try out Fette Sau, a place that many people claim to be the best BBQ place in New York.  After consuming a couple pounds of BBQ and several beers on a Sunday afternoon, I can safely say that Fette Sau is one of the top places in NYC for BBQ, but only for specific types of meat.  Overall, Fette Sau has some of the best pork I've ever had -- the pulled pork, bacon, pork belly, and pork spare ribs were all exceptional.  The beef was solid, but varied greatly -- the brisket was among the best I've had (Hill Country moist brisket still reigns supreme), but the short ribs were way too tough for my tastes.  The spicy pork sausage was good, but the flavor profile didn't fit in with the rest of the smoked meats.  Sides were very good - go for the cole slaw, which has an Asian flavor to it (sesame oil) and the potato salad.  Even on Sunday afternoons (we got here at 4pm), the wait is a good 35-40 minutes, so be prepared to wait for your food.for pictures:  thegluttonousjd.com/2011…",5.0

"I don't normally travel to Brooklyn, but as a dedicated fan of great BBQ, I was willing to take a trip out to the land of the hipsters (Williamsburg) to try out Fette Sau, a place that many people claim to be the best BBQ place in New York.  After consuming a couple pounds of BBQ and several beers on a Sunday afternoon, I can safely say that Fette Sau is one of the top places in NYC for BBQ, but only for specific types of meat.  Overall, Fette Sau has some of the best pork I've ever had -- the pulled pork, bacon, pork belly, and pork spare ribs were all exceptional.  The beef was solid, but varied greatly -- the brisket was among the best I've had (Hill Country moist brisket still reigns supreme), but the short ribs were way too tough for my tastes.  The spicy pork sausage was good, but the flavor profile didn't fit in with the rest of the smoked meats.  Sides were very good - go for the cole slaw, which has an Asian flavor to it (sesame oil) and the potato salad.  Even on Sunday afternoons (we got here at 4pm), the wait is a good 35-40 minutes, so be prepared to wait for your food.for pictures:  thegluttonousjd.com/2011…",5.0
"The food is indeed tasty, but expensive with a bit too much oil for comfort. You also have to watch out for grizzle, unless you like your meat a bit fatty. The decor is nice, but with a minimum 30 minute wait to eat while standing in line, cafeteria style, and no reasonable seating guarantee for more than two people, I'd say you gotta know what you're in for.",3.0
"Meat Meat Meat!! This barbecue shop sells brisket, beef ribeye, pulled pork, pork belly, ribs, sausage...! It's open space and picnic-tabled, just like having barbecue outdoors. Pork belly is awesome,so tender and juicy!",4.0
"The best thing here are the ribs which were much better than the ones at Dinosaur or Hill Country. I was looking forward to their sausage but it was just wayyy too fatty! One bite and I squirted oil across the table... The pulled pork could have been more moist. The brisket was all right... Nothing really stood out.Thank God I didn't have to endure a long wait! Came here on a random weekday at about 6pm and there was only one group in front of me. If I had to wait longer than 10-15 minutes to order, it wouldn't be worth it at all!!",2.0
"OMG hands down the best BBQ in Manhattan area.. They have very good BQQ in general. I'd recommend- beans - they have bits of meat that fall off during the cutting process, so extra flavor!!- brisket - perfect smokey, a little fatty (but not too much) and not dry- their hard cider - not bbq, but something about hot summer day, standing in line, drinking a big JAR (yes jar) of hard apple cider.. deliciousWhile above is my favorite, they have such a variety, I've seen bison and boar.. and I'm sure they have a larger variety.. delicious!!",5.0

"The food is great, I love the baked beans and the meat is right on.  Recently I tried the beef brisket, which was nice and smoky, moist and flavorful.  The beef short ribs were also delectable.  I would skip the pulled pork shoulder next time, there are many more interesting options. The sausages are always great!The sides could be more exciting, the sauerkraut is incredibly boring, and I am not a huge fan of the potato salad.

"Ok, I am very aware that I am no connoisseur, but what I do know for sure is that I really really really love barbecue. And as far as barbecue places that I love goes, Fette Sau is on the top of the list. Though the prices seem to have gone up in the last couple years, I will survive, because sucking on those succulent ribs before chasing it with a heaping spoonful of burnt end baked beans puts me in a psychological place few other establishments or human beings are capable of. And that pork belly. Oh my goodness. Those fatty, juicy, salty globules of amazingness. I have to stop, all of this salivating is making people around me suspicious. I always recommend this place to people coming from out of town, and nobody has been disappointed. Yes, the lines can be intimidating, but if you use a little common sense, they can be avoided. And if you're with a large group of people, get a gallon of beer- you will look and feel pretty cool. Or heck, get one each, then don't forget to check out the fantastically curated bourbon selection by the bar. Then stumble home with those leftovers, wake up the next morning, and mow down on your remaining loot/meats before anybody else gets their grubby fingers on them.",5.0

"Pretty Freakin' AwesomeI wanted BBQ and I got BBQ.  As someone who has always loved BBQ and has always had high standards for it, I went in with my usual scrupulous and scrutinizing mentality.  The following sequence of observations ensued.1.  Smoky flavor upon entering.  Excellent2.  Bench seats.  No Frills.  Large bar with tons of craft beer.  Getting better.3.  Pork Belly.  Haven't had that before.  Plus4.  Short Line.  GreatThe meats were both incredibly visibly appealing and succulent.  They all had a thick layer of flavorful rub.  All had the required smoky taste.  All were tender. I didn't use sauce.  Mostly because I didn't like the flavors they had but most importantly, the meat didn't need it. The brisket is probably the second best I have ever had.  They serve it with cuts of fat, which is, frankly, awesome.  The ribs were fall-off-the-bone.  The pork belly was like bacon-doing-bbq. What can be better than that.  The myriad of craft beers didn't limit my pairing options.  I went with a saison, which made this a great experience.  The missing star is because the sides are limited.  I did not order any.  I think mac n' chesse and slaw are staples of BBQ, and fette sau lacked both.  Don't let this disuade you though.  Definitely try it.",4.0
"Nothing is more polarizing than discussing what makes great BBQ.I came here shortly after I moved to the city, expecting disappointment. BBQ is one of my favorite foods, and I've eaten it pretty much everywhere worth eating it. The quality of the BBQ is very high and comparable to some of the best spots in the country.Some recommendations:1) Pork Belly - admittedly, not an aficionado on this cut of meat, but definitely one of the most succulent pieces of meat I've ever tasted. Definitely my favorite thing here.2) Brisket - If you can get this one right as it comes out, you'll be a happy camper.3) Pulled Pork - maybe because I was raised on pulled pork, I was not super blown away, but I'm not gonna hate too much - it's good.The sides are cool. Not giving or taking away stars for sides, though. Not why I'm going to a BBQ place.Last time I was there, my girlfriend and I sat at the bar, which was fantastic. Great beers on tap, cool bartender, and TONS of whiskey. BBQ, for me, is supposed to be a fairly cheap meal, so I don't think I would sit around eating BBQ and sipping on $30 glasses of whiskey, but that's just me. Not trying to kill your vibe though, if that's your thing :)That being said about price, when I first came here, I couldn't believe how much I was paying for BBQ. Yes, local meats, organic, yap yap... you're eating BBQ; don't talk to me about health. I went back recently, and on second evaluation, the price is actually pretty reasonable (in the two dollar sign ($$) category), so I retract my gripe about price. Not to mention the fact that they know they're a commodity. Not in their attitude (the people that work there are cool, in my experience), but in the reality that no one is doing what they're doing. They could charge more and I'd probably still go.Better bring that patience game, though; you're gonna stand in line.",4.0

"Fette Sau has been talked up to me quite a bit and the experience, though definitely worth the wait, wasn't mind-shattering.  Let me preface this by saying this place is above a 3 but as I always say, yelp still hasn't updated the site to allow you to make half star ratings, which would bring more accurate reviews.But I digress...Fette Sau is a unique bbq experience like none other.  First off there are no servers but this is NOT a take-out service.  When you come here, you better be ready to find a seat, which may prove extremely difficult in peak dining hours.  You start by waiting on a seemingly never-ending line that trails out the door where you'll immediately notice the many benches by the outside entrance.  Each table has paper towels and sauces and its communal seating so be ready to become close the person sitting next to you (Or just make sure you come with a friend or two so you don't come off as a creep).The wait time, though ultimately worth it, is long and the flow of people coming in and out of the restaurant due to the indoor and outdoor seating, makes the experience less than pleasant, especially when some of these people have had one too many beers.  Eventually you will get inside and get to place your order.  The inside is full of life with a fantastic decor going with the area as well as the bbq theme.  The meat is served by full, half, or quarter pound, each in their own dry rub.  The smell of the meat is delectable and you can see it on display behind a glass counter, right before they serve it to you.  One of my biggest complaints besides the wait time are the prices.  Be prepared to spend at least, $25 for a pound of meat and two small potato buns.  At the majority of other BBQ establishments I can get that for $20 but with two to three generously portioned sides even if the quality may vary per restaurant.  All the meats are at least $20 and can go as high as the low 30's.  Then they have the audacity to charge over $8 for a large side.  This place definitely makes a killing due to the large crowds it draws in and it isn't fair to the patrons that you don't get your money's worth.  Yes the experience is fun, and its cool to see your meat weighed right in front of you and then presented on a metal tray, but for the price you pay I'm a little skeptical.As for the food, I got to sample the beef ribs, pork belly, and brisket.  The ribs practically melted right off the bone and were fantastic and both the pork belly and brisket were very flavorful.  I will say the pork belly was very fatty but since this is basically what becomes bacon, that is to be expected.  All the meats are made with a dry rub and arguably they don't need a sauce since the flavor is so strong on its own; a testament to the quality of the meat and preparation, but for guys like me, need a sauce to go hand in hand with the meat to bring the flavor experience to a whole other level.  This is possibly the weakest link in Fette Sau's cuisine.  The sauces are uninspired and I'll go so far to say that one of the three options, a brown liquid-based one that seems to leak into the paper covering your trays rather than the meat, subtracts from the experience.  They ultimately got the job done but they left me very unsatisfied.  The potato buns on the other hand were a nice surprise; they looked like your average store variety buns but upon tasting them, it is apparent that these are prepared on the premises and have a fluffy texture with a slightly buttery taste.  Though I didn't get a side, the beans and broccoli salad looked very tempting.  For the future, they should really offer a free side for no additional cost per each pound of meat otherwise its practically impossible for one person to have a full meal here without spending short of $40, which is ABSURD for bbq.  The desserts on the other hand, sitting behind another counter looked measly and unappetizing.   Its important to mention that they also have a wide array of beers on tap which you can order in jars or jugs, which adds another fun level to the decor.  My pound of meat left me satisfied but not as full as I would've liked to have been, but unfortunately my wallet had suffered enough.There is no denying that Fette Sau's is delicious and you can make a decent case that this is some of the best meat you can find for some solid bbq; however, with the long wait times, limited seating, bland sauces, and some serious pricing problems, this business is a double-edged sword.  I would definitely come here again but I hope that Fette Sau's staff changes their tune to offer more rather than less to their respected customers.",3.0

"Fette Sau has been talked up to me quite a bit and the experience, though definitely worth the wait, wasn't mind-shattering.  Let me preface this by saying this place is above a 3 but as I always say, yelp still hasn't updated the site to allow you to make half star ratings, which would bring more accurate reviews.But I digress...Fette Sau is a unique bbq experience like none other.  First off there are no servers but this is NOT a take-out service.  When you come here, you better be ready to find a seat, which may prove extremely difficult in peak dining hours.  You start by waiting on a seemingly never-ending line that trails out the door where you'll immediately notice the many benches by the outside entrance.  Each table has paper towels and sauces and its communal seating so be ready to become close the person sitting next to you (Or just make sure you come with a friend or two so you don't come off as a creep).The wait time, though ultimately worth it, is long and the flow of people coming in and out of the restaurant due to the indoor and outdoor seating, makes the experience less than pleasant, especially when some of these people have had one too many beers.  Eventually you will get inside and get to place your order.  The inside is full of life with a fantastic decor going with the area as well as the bbq theme.  The meat is served by full, half, or quarter pound, each in their own dry rub.  The smell of the meat is delectable and you can see it on display behind a glass counter, right before they serve it to you.  One of my biggest complaints besides the wait time are the prices.  Be prepared to spend at least, $25 for a pound of meat and two small potato buns.  At the majority of other BBQ establishments I can get that for $20 but with two to three generously portioned sides even if the quality may vary per restaurant.  All the meats are at least $20 and can go as high as the low 30's.  Then they have the audacity to charge over $8 for a large side.  This place definitely makes a killing due to the large crowds it draws in and it isn't fair to the patrons that you don't get your money's worth.  Yes the experience is fun, and its cool to see your meat weighed right in front of you and then presented on a metal tray, but for the price you pay I'm a little skeptical.As for the food, I got to sample the beef ribs, pork belly, and brisket.  The ribs practically melted right off the bone and were fantastic and both the pork belly and brisket were very flavorful.  I will say the pork belly was very fatty but since this is basically what becomes bacon, that is to be expected.  All the meats are made with a dry rub and arguably they don't need a sauce since the flavor is so strong on its own; a testament to the quality of the meat and preparation, but for guys like me, need a sauce to go hand in hand with the meat to bring the flavor experience to a whole other level.  This is possibly the weakest link in Fette Sau's cuisine.  The sauces are uninspired and I'll go so far to say that one of the three options, a brown liquid-based one that seems to leak into the paper covering your trays rather than the meat, subtracts from the experience.  They ultimately got the job done but they left me very unsatisfied.  The potato buns on the other hand were a nice surprise; they looked like your average store variety buns but upon tasting them, it is apparent that these are prepared on the premises and have a fluffy texture with a slightly buttery taste.  Though I didn't get a side, the beans and broccoli salad looked very tempting.  For the future, they should really offer a free side for no additional cost per each pound of meat otherwise its practically impossible for one person to have a full meal here without spending short of $40, which is ABSURD for bbq.  The desserts on the other hand, sitting behind another counter looked measly and unappetizing.   Its important to mention that they also have a wide array of beers on tap which you can order in jars or jugs, which adds another fun level to the decor.  My pound of meat left me satisfied but not as full as I would've liked to have been, but unfortunately my wallet had suffered enough.There is no denying that Fette Sau's is delicious and you can make a decent case that this is some of the best meat you can find for some solid bbq; however, with the long wait times, limited seating, bland sauces, and some serious pricing problems, this business is a double-edged sword.  I would definitely come here again but I hope that Fette Sau's staff changes their tune to offer more rather than less to their respected customers.",3.0
"Ahhhh Fette Sau! I am actually glad this place doesn't deliver anymore. Mainly bc I would need a crane to lift me out of my apartment. This BBQ here is really that good.

"Everything about this is amazing (if you eat meat).   The bbq is cooked to perfection, you get to eat like the pig you're eating off a tray (score), and whiskey.  In addition to the meats, I also love the baked beans and broccoli salad.  Also their dry rub mix makes for a great dad gift!",5.0

There's never anywhere to sit so everybody is hovering around looking for a spot to squeeze in - this is annoying both when you're the one hovering and have no place to sit and eat all the food and it's annoying when you're finally sitting down and eating all the food while strangers silently urge you to hurry up.,4.0

"Well, we made the mistake of going to Fette Sau on a saturday nught at 8:30, which is about as busy as it gets. The line was literally spilling onto the sidewalk, out the door (or should I say chainlink fence). The place had an incredidebly unique ambiance, as it was in an old garage in Williamsburg, with picnic benches for tables.Pro tip: The minute you walk into the premises while your still in line, you can send a friend up to the bar to get a gallon (yes you read that right, they sell beer by the gallon) of Allagash white.The menu consists of six meats the rotate daily, and once our hour long wait was finally over, we ordered the brisket, short rib, baked beans, broccoli salad, and best of all the pulled pork. This place was unreal, the meat was so incredibly tender and juicy, combined with their homemade spicy and sweet BBQ sauces, made it a delectable feast. I highly recommend the brisket to anyone as its one of their staples.In summary: Food: 4.5/5Experience 5/5 (Their tap dispensers at the bar are giant butcher knives, can it get any better?)Just beware of the line at night, this place gets packed!",5.0
"Came here as a group of 3.  There is a pretty decent wait for food- usually takes around 30-40 minutes from start to finish (getting on the line, ordering, and then finally sitting down if you find a seat).  The restaurant has both outdoor and indoor seating separated by a nice modern looking garage door.  As you enter the line for food - the smells are terrific.  There's no assigned seatings, you buy food, and you sit wherever you find a seat in the array of picnic tables.  Each table has a bunch of napkins, paper towels, and three kinds of sauce (a homemade bbq sauce, a spicy version (dark/black colored), and a vineger-ish sauce) Its bbq in new york done pretty damn good!  Compared to a range of other places around town (Virgils, Hill country, Dallas BBQ, etc.) - this bbq joint has really tasty meats!  Got the following:- 1/2 lb brisket- 1/2 lb pork ribs- 1/4 lb pork belly- large baked beans - 1/4 lb angus beef cheeksThe pork ribs are very very good, definitely comparable to real BBQ down south - and highly recommend!.  The brisket was moist but the meat was a little timid - needed to use the bbq sauce on the picnic tables around the restaurant.  The pork belly had a lot of pork flavor, and the cut was very juicy.  Baked beans were maple-ish sweet, and has bits and pieces of meats in it.  Within the restaurant in the corner is a bar serving beer on tap and whiskey flights.  Did not get a chance to try the alcohol, but that just gives me another excuse to come back if not for the delicious bbq. All in all, this place is worth the 30-40 minute wait - highly recommend the dry rubbed pork ribs - it is somewhat comparably to the insane ribs down south.  Other meats were tasty (juicy and tasty - but needed the bbq sauce to compliment)   Decor was very casual and smokey with magnificent bbq smells throughout.",4.0
"I ordered take-out beef brisket, pork belly, bacon strips and sausage. The only thing that takes away from a 5 star rating is the ordering process, and how long it took. I stood in line as directed and it was literally a 45 minute wait before I got to the counter, with only a few people in front of me. Luckily, they were visitors from Brazil and good conversationalists. Mind you, this was in the middle of the afternoon on a weekend. Was it worth the trip from Manhattan to Williamsburg? Should anyone visiting New York experience Fette Sau? Should I call in my take-out order ahead of time for expedient gratification of my cravings for scrumptious, fatty, lip-smacking meaty goodness? My answer is....Yes! Yes! Yes!",4.0
"I waited until after the second time I went here to write a review. The first time I had the beef brisket. It was so tough that I really had to work my knife to cut it into pieces. It was so bad I only ate one piece and had the rest thrown out. Anyone who knows anything about BBQ knows that a properly smoked piece of brisket should flake apart with just the back of a fork. This wasn't it!!!The second time I visited, I stayed away from the brisket which didn't look any better and tried the ribs.  The ribs were a bit dry, but certainly edible with some of the different sauces available. The place has a wonderful selection of bourbons and beers. The facility is certainly entertaining with all of the wooden picnic tables and ""family style"" seating. However, the average (at best) BBQ and overly high prices make places like Hill Country BBQ in Manhattan a better value and a more attractive choice for someone who wants good BBQ (well, at least as good as you're going to find in NYC).I'm at a loss to explain how Fette Sau has received so many 5-star ratings. I'm guessing that: a) many of the reviews were written by young Brooklyn ""hipsters"" who've not had that much exposure to real BBQ and are more in love with the idea of the place than the food, or b) persons who've been away from areas that have good BBQ for so long that they have lowered their standards.All in all, Fette Sau is an interesting place to try out, just be prepared to pay a large amount of cash for average food.",2.0

"Solid, solid BBQ. Love the hipster, unpretentious vibe. Love the communal tables and dark, cozy feeling in the room. Pretty bar. The line takes awhile to move, but it gives you plenty of time to decide what to get. Came around 6 on a Sunday and waited about 15 minutes, but the place was not too crowded. Ordered a slice of brisket, 1/4 lb. of pulled pork, 4 pork ribs, a spicy pork sausage link, pickles, potato salad and sauerkraut. Everything is sold by the pound and seems like there are 6-7 options each night in addition to a rotation of sides. Staff was really nice and friendly at the counter to order.Love that they give you potato rolls with your meal (we made little pulled pork sandwiches with them which was delicious). Pulled pork was pretty good, felt like it could have been a bit more moist. Brisket was amazing. Probably my favorite meat that I tried that evening. Sausage was really good but I would have had a hard time finishing it on my own--sharing is caring. Pork ribs were good but not the best I've had. German potato salad, sauerkraut and pickles were all solid. I loved the BBQ/horseradish/spicy chipotle sauces on the tables too. Overall, for all that, it was about $18/person for 2. No drinks.Definitely not a stop I'm going to make too often, but when I'm craving BBQ in an easygoing setting, Fette Sau will be my spot.",4.0
"Friday night 10-11p Came with 2 friends after a few beers, walked by and was discouraged by the line nearly out to the street (typical and should be expected for the time we went).   Walked the hood a bit and decided to come back after all we stumbled across was a $14 burger.The line is long and moved slow but seeing everyone with hoards of glistening meat made it worth it.  They have free water dispensers at 2 points in the line which is nice.  You can also hit the bathroom if you are in a group and can have your spot in line held.  Lots of non-locals though so just prepare mentally beforehand.We, 3 guys split a pound of pulled pork, a pound of brisket, a side of potato salad, and about 6 rolls.  The best was by far the brisket - the best I've ever had.  Pulled pork was slightly not up to par since I needed to use bbq sauce on it.  It was more smokey than flavorful.  Potato salad was refreshing but also slightly bland.  Rolls were soft and very delicious, tasted like potato bread and butter.  We actually left a little bit of everything too so you do get a good amount for your $.Seating could be an issue but we were lucky and snagged some right before we were about to order.  Expect to wait a bit and possibly be forced to eat standing up... or hover over tourists that are fed and just taking up tables.",4.0

The line was literally spilling onto the sidewalk, out the door (or should I say chainlink fence). The place had an incredidebly unique ambiance, as it was in an old garage in Williamsburg, with picnic benches for tables.Pro tip: The minute you walk into the premises while your still in line, you can send a friend up to the bar to get a gallon (yes you read that right, they sell beer by the gallon) of Allagash white.The menu consists of six meats the rotate daily, and once our hour long wait was finally over, we ordered the brisket, short rib, baked beans, broccoli salad, and best of all the pulled pork. This place was unreal, the meat was so incredibly tender and juicy, combined with their homemade spicy and sweet BBQ sauces, made it a delectable feast. I highly recommend the brisket to anyone as its one of their staples.In summary: Food: 4.5/5Experience 5/5 (Their tap dispensers at the bar are giant butcher knives, can it get any better?)Just beware of the line at night, this place gets packed!",5.0
"Came here as a group of 3.  There is a pretty decent wait for food- usually takes around 30-40 minutes from start to finish (getting on the line, ordering, and then finally sitting down if you find a seat).  The restaurant has both outdoor and indoor seating separated by a nice modern looking garage door.  As you enter the line for food - the smells are terrific.  There's no assigned seatings, you buy food, and you sit wherever you find a seat in the array of picnic tables.  Each table has a bunch of napkins, paper towels, and three kinds of sauce (a homemade bbq sauce, a spicy version (dark/black colored), and a vineger-ish sauce) Its bbq in new york done pretty damn good!  Compared to a range of other places around town (Virgils, Hill country, Dallas BBQ, etc.) - this bbq joint has really tasty meats!  Got the following:- 1/2 lb brisket- 1/2 lb pork ribs- 1/4 lb pork belly- large baked beans - 1/4 lb angus beef cheeksThe pork ribs are very very good, definitely comparable to real BBQ down south - and highly recommend!.  The brisket was moist but the meat was a little timid - needed to use the bbq sauce on the picnic tables around the restaurant.  The pork belly had a lot of pork flavor, and the cut was very juicy.  Baked beans were maple-ish sweet, and has bits and pieces of meats in it.  Within the restaurant in the corner is a bar serving beer on tap and whiskey flights.  Did not get a chance to try the alcohol, but that just gives me another excuse to come back if not for the delicious bbq. All in all, this place is worth the 30-40 minute wait - highly recommend the dry rubbed pork ribs - it is somewhat comparably to the insane ribs down south.  Other meats were tasty (juicy and tasty - but needed the bbq sauce to compliment)   Decor was very casual and smokey with magnificent bbq smells throughout.",4.0
"I ordered take-out beef brisket, pork belly, bacon strips and sausage. The only thing that takes away from a 5 star rating is the ordering process, and how long it took. I stood in line as directed and it was literally a 45 minute wait before I got to the counter, with only a few people in front of me. Luckily, they were visitors from Brazil and good conversationalists. Mind you, this was in the middle of the afternoon on a weekend. Was it worth the trip from Manhattan to Williamsburg? Should anyone visiting New York experience Fette Sau? Should I call in my take-out order ahead of time for expedient gratification of my cravings for scrumptious, fatty, lip-smacking meaty goodness? My answer is....Yes! Yes! Yes!",4.0
"I waited until after the second time I went here to write a review. The first time I had the beef brisket. It was so tough that I really had to work my knife to cut it into pieces. It was so bad I only ate one piece and had the rest thrown out. Anyone who knows anything about BBQ knows that a properly smoked piece of brisket should flake apart with just the back of a fork. This wasn't it!!!The second time I visited, I stayed away from the brisket which didn't look any better and tried the ribs.  The ribs were a bit dry, but certainly edible with some of the different sauces available. The place has a wonderful selection of bourbons and beers. The facility is certainly entertaining with all of the wooden picnic tables and ""family style"" seating. However, the average (at best) BBQ and overly high prices make places like Hill Country BBQ in Manhattan a better value and a more attractive choice for someone who wants good BBQ (well, at least as good as you're going to find in NYC).I'm at a loss to explain how Fette Sau has received so many 5-star ratings. I'm guessing that: a) many of the reviews were written by young Brooklyn ""hipsters"" who've not had that much exposure to real BBQ and are more in love with the idea of the place than the food, or b) persons who've been away from areas that have good BBQ for so long that they have lowered their standards.All in all, Fette Sau is an interesting place to try out, just be prepared to pay a large amount of cash for average food.",2.0
"eh.  this place got big write-ups but i just don't see it.  sure, brisket is good.  sides are very limited.  beans aren't what they're cracked up to be, either are the ribs or pork belly.  very expensive, to me.  no mac n' cheese.  no diet soda.....nice bar (i wasn't drinking).i guess it's good for the brooklyn crowd that doesn't know better.they put the nice locavore spin on the place but then again, who really cares?not sure i'd go back.",3.0

"Solid, solid BBQ. Love the hipster, unpretentious vibe. Love the communal tables and dark, cozy feeling in the room. Pretty bar. The line takes awhile to move, but it gives you plenty of time to decide what to get. Came around 6 on a Sunday and waited about 15 minutes, but the place was not too crowded. Ordered a slice of brisket, 1/4 lb. of pulled pork, 4 pork ribs, a spicy pork sausage link, pickles, potato salad and sauerkraut. Everything is sold by the pound and seems like there are 6-7 options each night in addition to a rotation of sides. Staff was really nice and friendly at the counter to order.Love that they give you potato rolls with your meal (we made little pulled pork sandwiches with them which was delicious). Pulled pork was pretty good, felt like it could have been a bit more moist. Brisket was amazing. Probably my favorite meat that I tried that evening. Sausage was really good but I would have had a hard time finishing it on my own--sharing is caring. Pork ribs were good but not the best I've had. German potato salad, sauerkraut and pickles were all solid. I loved the BBQ/horseradish/spicy chipotle sauces on the tables too. Overall, for all that, it was about $18/person for 2. No drinks.Definitely not a stop I'm going to make too often, but when I'm craving BBQ in an easygoing setting, Fette Sau will be my spot.",4.0
"Friday night 10-11p Came with 2 friends after a few beers, walked by and was discouraged by the line nearly out to the street (typical and should be expected for the time we went).   Walked the hood a bit and decided to come back after all we stumbled across was a $14 burger.The line is long and moved slow but seeing everyone with hoards of glistening meat made it worth it.  They have free water dispensers at 2 points in the line which is nice.  You can also hit the bathroom if you are in a group and can have your spot in line held.  Lots of non-locals though so just prepare mentally beforehand.We, 3 guys split a pound of pulled pork, a pound of brisket, a side of potato salad, and about 6 rolls.  The best was by far the brisket - the best I've ever had.  Pulled pork was slightly not up to par since I needed to use bbq sauce on it.  It was more smokey than flavorful.  Potato salad was refreshing but also slightly bland.  Rolls were soft and very delicious, tasted like potato bread and butter.  We actually left a little bit of everything too so you do get a good amount for your $.Seating could be an issue but we were lucky and snagged some right before we were about to order.  Expect to wait a bit and possibly be forced to eat standing up... or hover over tourists that are fed and just taking up tables.",4.0
"Fresh off a visit to the Xinjiang BBQ cart in Chinatown, my cousin and I wandered over to Fette Sau to double down on the grilled meat fest!  Part barbeque mecca, part beer hall and part bar, Fette Sau is tucked away down a small alleyway marked by a pink neon sign.  Pass the picnic tables and brown/pink motif, you'll find a very cool and hip barbeque cavern.  To the right, a simple display case of charred meats and a blackboard with the special of the day.  To the left, a full bar with beer taps on proud display.  Fette Sau specializes in Berkshire Heritage pork which is a high-end breed raised for its flavor and taste.  The friendly dude behind the counter made some recommendations on the chow.  We ordered a couple of sausages, a rack of st. louis ribs, collard greens, baked beans, pickle and a bit of fatback.  We paid up and wandered over to the bar.  Very pretty setup here, they've got these wonderful wrought iron bar stools that look like they came out of a secret garden.  Good selection of brews and bourbon to choose from.  Drinks in hand, we hoofed it out to the outdoors picnic tables to eat our meal a la natural. The meat was wonderfully charred and smoked.  A bit pink on the inside, blackened crust on the outside.  Meat fell off the bones along with the delicious fattiness.  The fatback is a thick grilled piece of meat that will literally drip when you bite into it.  Proceed with caloric caution!  You can eat the meat without any additions or try one of the four que sauces at the table.  Collard greens were rich and spiked with meats, the beans were deeply baked but not my fave.  Throw in some potato rolls to finish off your meal and sop up the juices.  Fette Sau means fatted pig in German and it certainly means the same in English in Williamsburg.  I rolled out of the place, stuffed, full and happy.  Not sure what would have happened if we had ordered a gallon of beer, I'm glad we held back.  What I can tell you is that Fette Sau is a wonderful meat-atorium in Williamsburg,  Check it out if you've got a serious appetite and a hankering for delicious charred meats and beer in hand.  You can't beat the food, ambiance and atmosphere in this cool biersch, barbeque and bourbon garden!",5.0

The beans were a little sweet and they had burnt ends in it but I found that the ends made it a little bitter and it turned me off.

Got in early and snagged some great seats.  BBQ was a bit pricey.  I thought the spicy sausage was their best offering followed by the brisket which had generous portions of burnt ends (though it was a bit dry on the insided).  I was less than impress with the ribs and pulled pork.  The ribs were paltry with very little meat on the bone.  The pulled pork was dry and required quite a bit of sauce for my liking.  Beer selection was pretty decent.  Overall great atmosphere.  Just come early because it gets quite crowded.,3.0

"BBQ. An all American food group right out of the wild wild west. Fette Sau. The way people wait for tables like vultures...it's a little bit Texas roadhouse. All it's missing is the saw dust on the floor. The line out the door was a signal of good times to come and we took our place in line like a high school cafeteria. After about 15 minutes of waiting, we were ready to order. Brisket, pork shoulder, sausages, beef tongue pastrami (I was feeling adventurous) and a rack of ribs later, the other half of our group had scored us seats and a gallon of beer (yes, they serve beer by the gallon) and we took our seats on the long communal picnic bench table ready to eat ourselves into a coma. Be advised heading to this joint with 6 people is a mistake. It's tough to get a table. We got lucky. Moving on to the meat. SO GOOD. I mean juicy, tender, perfectly cooked and piled onto a over-sized tin platter in an all you can eat, all hands on deck style that I was totally digging. Slugging back beer from a mason jar really puts you in the mood to continue the gluttonous meal. There were multiple sauces on the table and all the meat came with soft rolls. I was pulling them apart, loading the pastrami onto it, a little bit of sauce and some of the homemade vinegar based cole slaw we chose as a side. Phenomenal little impromptu sandwich. Can I have another to go please? Thinking back on it, the wait was nothing I couldn't handle again. They change the types of meats they offer every night, so you always have a great excuse to head back. The only thing I didn't try was the extensive and very attractive whiskey bar. Don't worry, Fette Sau. I'll be back to conquer your alcoholic selection soon.",5.0
"I'll keep this short.  When they're good, they're good.  The problem is, they're wildly inconsistent.  One day their brisket will be moist and packed with flavor, the next it's insanely dry.  Oh, and the gamble will cost you an arm and a leg.  Yay!The positives of Fette Sau are the atmosphere/outdoor picnic tables (if you can get a seat), the speciality items like their Berkshire Pork Cheeks (they don't usually have them), and the pitmaster Jesus, who is a cool dude.  All in all though, I'm taking Mighty Quinn's over Fette Sau every time.",3.0
I just wanted to start my review off with a fuck yeah. and a clip of Meg Ryan faking an orgasm. So this place has really good BBQ. If you haven't seen it before it looks like your about to walk into someones garage or something. This is the only place where I've waited in line and didn't care. I will say that the last time I was here i felt like it wasn't as good. But I also came a day after eating at Babbo. So yeah. My bad.K. Focus. The food here is really awesome. The best BBQ in my opinion in the city. ANNND I'm giving this place 5 stars because like after 11PM they will sell the rest of their meat inventory on potato buns for a few bucks....thats where the fuck yeah comes into factor. Everyone is really nice and patient. Sometimes the fattey's behind you (ohhhhh see what I did!?!?!) get a little overly eager.

It may seem expensive at $10/lb but it is damn good. Worth every cent.",4.0
Got in early and snagged some great seats.  BBQ was a bit pricey.  I thought the spicy sausage was their best offering followed by the brisket which had generous portions of burnt ends (though it was a bit dry on the insided).  I was less than impress with the ribs and pulled pork.  The ribs were paltry with very little meat on the bone.  The pulled pork was dry and required quite a bit of sauce for my liking.  Beer selection was pretty decent.  Overall great atmosphere.  Just come early because it gets quite crowded.,3.0
"A vegetarian's nightmare but a meat eater's delight! I love it.I'm a light meat eater, so whenever I go to Fette Sau it feels like binging. It's great. The vibe is super casual and seating is communal. The meat they serve is by weight and by golly, it's aplenty and delicious. I generally share with a friend since you can get so much for such an affordable price. And don't just get the meat - get the sides! Especially the beans! Meat beans!MEAT MEAT MEAT MEAT MEAT MEAT MEAT MEAT MEAT MEAT MEAT MEAT",4.0
"BBQ. An all American food group right out of the wild wild west. Fette Sau. The way people wait for tables like vultures...it's a little bit Texas roadhouse. All it's missing is the saw dust on the floor. The line out the door was a signal of good times to come and we took our place in line like a high school cafeteria. After about 15 minutes of waiting, we were ready to order. Brisket, pork shoulder, sausages, beef tongue pastrami (I was feeling adventurous) and a rack of ribs later, the other half of our group had scored us seats and a gallon of beer (yes, they serve beer by the gallon) and we took our seats on the long communal picnic bench table ready to eat ourselves into a coma. Be advised heading to this joint with 6 people is a mistake. It's tough to get a table. We got lucky. Moving on to the meat. SO GOOD. I mean juicy, tender, perfectly cooked and piled onto a over-sized tin platter in an all you can eat, all hands on deck style that I was totally digging. Slugging back beer from a mason jar really puts you in the mood to continue the gluttonous meal. There were multiple sauces on the table and all the meat came with soft rolls. I was pulling them apart, loading the pastrami onto it, a little bit of sauce and some of the homemade vinegar based cole slaw we chose as a side. Phenomenal little impromptu sandwich. Can I have another to go please? Thinking back on it, the wait was nothing I couldn't handle again. They change the types of meats they offer every night, so you always have a great excuse to head back. The only thing I didn't try was the extensive and very attractive whiskey bar. Don't worry, Fette Sau. I'll be back to conquer your alcoholic selection soon.",5.0
"I'll keep this short.  When they're good, they're good.  The problem is, they're wildly inconsistent.  One day their brisket will be moist and packed with flavor, the next it's insanely dry.  Oh, and the gamble will cost you an arm and a leg.  Yay!The positives of Fette Sau are the atmosphere/outdoor picnic tables (if you can get a seat), the speciality items like their Berkshire Pork Cheeks (they don't usually have them), and the pitmaster Jesus, who is a cool dude.  All in all though, I'm taking Mighty Quinn's over Fette Sau every time.",3.0
I just wanted to start my review off with a fuck yeah. and a clip of Meg Ryan faking an orgasm. So this place has really good BBQ. If you haven't seen it before it looks like your about to walk into someones garage or something. This is the only place where I've waited in line and didn't care. I will say that the last time I was here i felt like it wasn't as good. But I also came a day after eating at Babbo. So yeah. My bad.K. Focus. The food here is really awesome. The best BBQ in my opinion in the city. ANNND I'm giving this place 5 stars because like after 11PM they will sell the rest of their meat inventory on potato buns for a few bucks....thats where the fuck yeah comes into factor. Everyone is really nice and patient. Sometimes the fattey's behind you (ohhhhh see what I did!?!?!) get a little overly eager. Just shoot em down with your I don't giiiiiivvvvveeee aaaaaa ffffuuuuuuuccckkkk face. Go here - your taste buds will thank your cheeks and teeth for left overs later.,5.0
"It really hurts me to give food this good such few stars, but let the hating commence!Came here with my best friend in search of our first taste of ""authentic"" BBQ. We heard all the stories of how packed it gets so we came pretty early. It seemed like we weren't too far back in the line, yet somehow we still ended up waiting about an hour for food. If the food was bad I'd be pretty pissed but it was far from it. We had Brisket, Pulled pork and boar belly. All meats were phenomenal! It was pretty expensive, but I was prepared for that and with how it all tasted seemed more justified than not. The dining set up is pretty cool with picnic tables arranged to create a communal eating atmosphere. Unfortunately the space is really small so we didn't have the opportunity to eat in the restaurant. Looking around the area where fette sau is located, I was really left wondering why they haven't expanded in some sort of way. Really the reason i gave them such few stars though is that with prices so high I would think you get get a little more with your meal. Instead every corner possible is cut. They gave us a 4 rolls to eat with 2.5lbs of meat and worst of all they gave us 1 small container of BBQ sauce*think the ones in McDonalds*  for the entire meal.It honestly seems like a change in how the operation is managed can take this place to new heights, but as good as the food was the experience doesn't support the price.

We ate at the bar, perusing their extensive whiskey list.While I think of myself as a barbecue snob, I hadn't ever experienced pork belly before. It was tender, perfectly smoked, a nice balance between the dry smoked barbecue that I'm used to and the saucy Carolina style. The fat was beginning to caramelize in a way that inspired reverence.

"Fette Sau is for people who have never left NYC for BBQ. It does have a real good thing going though.I showed up with 2 other friends at 6pm on a Sunday evening. The line up was starting but it wasn't too bad, maybe 10 deep. The 3 of us decided ahead of time we were going to split a half pound of the following: Beef Brisket, Pulled Pork, Chicken and Sausage links with a side of Pickles, Slaw and Beans. We arrived to the scale/ordering counter and placed. The guy behind the counter commented on my friend's Antidote shirt and shot the shit for a bit about that pricey 7"". Already off to an awesome start. We paid for everything and it came around to 55 bucks which is pretty great for the amount of work and hours it takes to make all this food.We sat down and ordered some beers at the beer/liquor bar (FYI: you have to pay for your food and drinks separately) and sat down. The brisket was real good and the pulled pork was sorta dry and whatever (I've made better) The roasted chicken (included head and foot) was decent but nothing to write home about. The links were pretty tasty, very fresh. As for the sides, the beans are a must, lots of flavour.  Pickles were very yum, but I dig garlic flavour more than the half sour they offer. The slaw was kinda weird, it was almost an asian type of slaw with big hunks of veggies and sort of a sesame vinaigrette. I highly recommend checking out this place if you're a BBQ foodie like myself, however I don't think I would make a point to come back and go again.

"Want some amazing bbq, awesome beer, and a selection of awe-inspiring bourbon?  Well you've come to the right place!!  This is the experience:  you walk down an alley that is full of picnic tables with people gorging on their Fette Sau (warm weather only, duh), you get punched in the face by the magnificent aroma of the bbq, you walk into a warm open cafeteria full of long, dark wooden tables and benches, and wait in line (always, but worth the wait).  I like to have someone wait in line, and the other person can go to the bar and get drinks...this may take awhile because they have a TON of great bourbon and beer.  As you make your way up the line, your mouth will literally start to drool from the smells, the atmosphere, and seeing an entire room full of people chowing down on their bbq.  Finally, you get close enough to the ordering counter and see the glorious meat!  Hallelujah!  Their ribs are awesome!  Their beef brisket is so moist and tender, and perfectly seasoned!  Their sausages are wonderful!  Their veal cheeks are delectable.  They rotate what they serve so check the chalkboard and see what they have.  Don't think you know every cut of meat and just look at the window--look at the chalkboard because they often have some nice surprises each night.  When you order, they'll put an aluminum half-sheet on a scale, rip some wax paper, and ask you what you want as they weigh it out:  1/2 lbs of pulled pork, 1 rack of pork ribs, 1 lbs of beef brisket, 4 sausages, 1/4 lbs of pork belly, and a pint of beans, should do it, for me and my guest!  One small note about the meat, on occasion, the meat has been a little fatty and greasy, but there are so many variables involved...in general, I've found their meat to be consistently superior!  Their sides are what is really lacking.  Their beans are good, pickles decent, but I would love to see some better sides here...That would really complete the meal for me.  Sometimes, I get take-out and prepare my own sides...but usually, I exercise gluttony with a big G and PIG OUT, and then rub my belly very contently after a Fette Sau experience.  Fun, delicious and enjoyable.  Please enjoy!",4.0

"Being originally from NC and still living in NC, I take my BBQ and pork very seriously.  Until Sunday afternoon, I couldn't fathom anywhere else in the world pulling off proper pig.  It truly pains me to say this, but Fette Sau is the BEST pulled pork BBQ I have ever consumed.  Hands down.  Who knew a little joint in Brooklyn could put out such amazing que.  Apparently, it is possible. The space is awesome.  Converted garage with picnic tables, a bar, and walk-up ordering counter.  Exceptional local slanted draft list served in mason jars, lots of meat choices (sold by weight), and a long list of innovative sides.  All this served on a tray perfect for sharing with the group.We tried:- Pulled pork = Like I said above, best ever.  I don't take this lightly.  Bark (burnt outer meat) blended throughout.  The stuff dreams are made of.- Pork belly = Again, phenomenal.  Bark fabulous here as well.- Spicy Pork Sausage = Perfectly spicy with a great snap to the casing.- House-made pickles = Sour, sweet, crunchy.  Closer to a cucumber than a traditional jarred pickle.  Tasty!- Burnt end baked beans = OMG.  Insanely good.  I think the burnt end pieces mixed in push it over the top.- Rolls = The only thing I didn't think was spot on.  Kinda bland and really could use a good toast.- Table sauces = Really well done.  The spicy dark sauce and horseradish mustard stole the show.  The vinegar and sweet sauce were solid though.I will dream of this meal for a very long time.  I will return Mr. Sau!",5.0
"Amazing.  People know how good this place is, so be prepared for a wait. You order your meats by weight, sides by container.  The prices are really, really reasonable.  Two people ate and brought food home for less than $30.  If you want to take food home, be sure to tell them when ordering.  Great variety of beers on tap.  Meats change daily.  It's worth the wait.Be sure to abide by the seating rules!  Trust in turnover.  Wait until you receive your food before sitting down at a table.",5.0

"Jaysus, the pork jowls were the most delciously splendid moist fatty delectable BBQ that ever I ate. Everything else, not so much. The pork chops were overdone and dry. The beans were tasty, with chunks of pork sausage swimming in the sauce, the other sides did not catch my eye or tastebuds. Keep your eyes peeled for those that hit the front of the line to cut in rather than queuing up as one should. Also, have a friend get your seating as you order. We had some minor drama procuring a spot which worked out alright for my party but not for the young couple with a baby that arrived just after us. Bone up on portions before you go. Ordering meat by the pound is a tricky thing. Most I saw ordered more than they could eat which didn't seem to stop them from trying.

Nevertheless, we waited an hour+ to finally order. We got the pork belly, brisket, sausages, burnt ends baked beans and the potato salad.Everything we ordered was great! The pork belly was way too much fat, so if you're planning on tasting it, ensure that you get a little. We got soo excited with all the reviews about the pork belly that we got way too much. The brisket is really good and a must try. The sides are ok..The pickles are crisp and tasty..They have a great selection of beers and whiskeys..try one of their tastings :) The food however is on the expensive side.

"Wow - unique and amazing venue!If you love meat in a no-thrills but quirky venue, this is for you!You pay by weight, grab a beer and sit at a bench - great for groups and quick stops!  The sides were also delicious - it would be very (too!) easy to over-eat here!Highly recommend!",5.0
"Want some amazing bbq, awesome beer, and a selection of awe-inspiring bourbon?  Well you've come to the right place!!  This is the experience:  you walk down an alley that is full of picnic tables with people gorging on their Fette Sau (warm weather only, duh), you get punched in the face by the magnificent aroma of the bbq, you walk into a warm open cafeteria full of long, dark wooden tables and benches, and wait in line (always, but worth the wait).  I like to have someone wait in line, and the other person can go to the bar and get drinks...this may take awhile because they have a TON of great bourbon and beer.  As you make your way up the line, your mouth will literally start to drool from the smells, the atmosphere, and seeing an entire room full of people chowing down on their bbq.  Finally, you get close enough to the ordering counter and see the glorious meat!  Hallelujah!  Their ribs are awesome!  Their beef brisket is so moist and tender, and perfectly seasoned!  Their sausages are wonderful!  Their veal cheeks are delectable.  They rotate what they serve so check the chalkboard and see what they have.  Don't think you know every cut of meat and just look at the window--look at the chalkboard because they often have some nice surprises each night.  When you order, they'll put an aluminum half-sheet on a scale, rip some wax paper, and ask you what you want as they weigh it out:  1/2 lbs of pulled pork, 1 rack of pork ribs, 1 lbs of beef brisket, 4 sausages, 1/4 lbs of pork belly, and a pint of beans, should do it, for me and my guest!  One small note about the meat, on occasion, the meat has been a little fatty and greasy, but there are so many variables involved...in general, I've found their meat to be consistently superior!  Their sides are what is really lacking.  Their beans are good, pickles decent, but I would love to see some better sides here...That would really complete the meal for me.  Sometimes, I get take-out and prepare my own sides...but usually, I exercise gluttony with a big G and PIG OUT, and then rub my belly very contently after a Fette Sau experience.  Fun, delicious and enjoyable.  Please enjoy!",4.0
"What can you say about Fette Sau's except get there early while the meats still available! One thing I learned early on, besides it sometimes being a bit tough to find a seat if you're in a group (communal seating) if you arrive late and they're out of a certain meat, sucks to be you! The BBQ is always good, the meat tastes amazing and the krout is a great addition to anything you take.",4.0
"Being originally from NC and still living in NC, I take my BBQ and pork very seriously.  Until Sunday afternoon, I couldn't fathom anywhere else in the world pulling off proper pig.  It truly pains me to say this, but Fette Sau is the BEST pulled pork BBQ I have ever consumed.  Hands down.  Who knew a little joint in Brooklyn could put out such amazing que.  Apparently, it is possible. The space is awesome.  Converted garage with picnic tables, a bar, and walk-up ordering counter.  Exceptional local slanted draft list served in mason jars, lots of meat choices (sold by weight), and a long list of innovative sides.  All this served on a tray perfect for sharing with the group.We tried:- Pulled pork = Like I said above, best ever.  I don't take this lightly.  Bark (burnt outer meat) blended throughout.  The stuff dreams are made of.- Pork belly = Again, phenomenal.  Bark fabulous here as well.- Spicy Pork Sausage = Perfectly spicy with a great snap to the casing.- House-made pickles = Sour, sweet, crunchy.  Closer to a cucumber than a traditional jarred pickle.  Tasty!- Burnt end baked beans = OMG.  Insanely good.  I think the burnt end pieces mixed in push it over the top.- Rolls = The only thing I didn't think was spot on.  Kinda bland and really could use a good toast.- Table sauces = Really well done.  The spicy dark sauce and horseradish mustard stole the show.  The vinegar and sweet sauce were solid though.I will dream of this meal for a very long time.  I will return Mr. Sau!",5.0
"Amazing.  People know how good this place is, so be prepared for a wait. You order your meats by weight, sides by container.  The prices are really, really reasonable.  Two people ate and brought food home for less than $30.  If you want to take food home, be sure to tell them when ordering.  Great variety of beers on tap.  Meats change daily.  It's worth the wait.Be sure to abide by the seating rules!  Trust in turnover.  Wait until you receive your food before sitting down at a table.",5.0
"Love the concept of a big warehouse full of smoked meat sold by the pound with great beer and cocktail offerings. Waiting in line is no biggie if you're with friends and have a Bourbon Bloom cocktail in hand. Unfortunately, the meat just didn't measure up. The brisket was dry, the ribs were ok, but not fall off the bone amazing and the sausage was nothing special.The burnt ends beans were amazing and the atmosphere, cocktails and beer and concept is great. I think I'm becoming a smoked meat snob...",3.0
"Jaysus, the pork jowls were the most delciously splendid moist fatty delectable BBQ that ever I ate. Everything else, not so much. The pork chops were overdone and dry. The beans were tasty, with chunks of pork sausage swimming in the sauce, the other sides did not catch my eye or tastebuds. Keep your eyes peeled for those that hit the front of the line to cut in rather than queuing up as one should. Also, have a friend get your seating as you order. We had some minor drama procuring a spot which worked out alright for my party but not for the young couple with a baby that arrived just after us. Bone up on portions before you go. Ordering meat by the pound is a tricky thing. Most I saw ordered more than they could eat which didn't seem to stop them from trying. When in Rome, do as the Roman's, when at Fette Sau, be a fat pig.",3.0
"We went to Fette Sau on a thursday night when we had an unsuccessful attempt on a Saturday night..I feel Fette Sau has earned such a strong reputation of being the best BBQ in the city that everyone is ready to wait to taste their BBQ. Nevertheless, we waited an hour+ to finally order. We got the pork belly, brisket, sausages, burnt ends baked beans and the potato salad.Everything we ordered was great! The pork belly was way too much fat, so if you're planning on tasting it, ensure that you get a little. We got soo excited with all the reviews about the pork belly that we got way too much. The brisket is really good and a must try. The sides are ok..The pickles are crisp and tasty..They have a great selection of beers and whiskeys..try one of their tastings :) The food however is on the expensive side. Plan on spending around 25-30$ per person for a good serving of meat and sides. For the cost and not having to wait, I feel Hill Country is a great contender.",3.0
"Fette Sau makes life better. Being from the Midwest (about an hour from Kansas City), I take barbecue pretty seriously. I grew up attending barbecue competitions and restaurants all over the area, and know how good it can be. Most places in the Northeast have been vast disappointments. Until I went to Fette Sau. Seriously the best BBQ in New York that I've had, and could probably stand up against some of the best in the midwest. Also, you can buy beer by the gallon. Go. Get in line (it moves faster than it seems). Get your food and rolls. Get a beer. Make a mess. Enjoy great BBQ.",5.0
"After seeing this place pop up on ""Hot on Yelp"" for the past few weeks, decided to stop by to see what the fuss was all about. The aroma of pork, pork, and more pork welcomes you when you enter this place. Always a good sign.Got some of the brisket, pork sparerib, and pork shoulder to go. Definitely greasy (err...juicy) and flavorful. I like that food is priced by weight, though it was a bit inefficient that there's only one scale per long line. Wish there were more sauce options, but the one offered was tasty with just the right amount of spice. Loved the bread. It was soft and reminded me of Hawaiian bread without the sweetness.",4.0

Well, when you walk in the building and you smell the smoke, you know it's going to be good. I had the beef brisket, but I gotta give these guys bonus points for offering pork belly, seeing as to how most barbecue joints do not offer this as an option. I had to try the brisket though. It looked like it would be the most satisfying of the bunch of meats that they had. The meat itself has a nice charring from the smoking. The smoke ring is pretty much all smoke, and not comprised too much of rub/seasoning. I'd have preferred a stronger taste from the smoke ring, but it was really more on the subtle side. As for the texture of the meat, it was a truly beautiful cut of meat. There was a perfect fat to muscle ratio, however given this perfect ratio, the brisket was not as tender as I'd have hoped for a higher-fat-content cut than what I'm used to. It was still very delicious, but I cannot say it's the best brisket I've ever had. The sauces were good, not great. The spicy/smoky sauce had a good flavor and a surprising amount of heat to it. The regular sauce was good, but really lacking that punch. I guess if you mix the two, you're pretty much good to go. I did not try their carolina, nor horseradish sauces. The baked beans looked great. They were only good. Like Blake W. mentioned, this place is no southern BBQ, but I would concur in that it might be the best you can get in Brooklyn. It's still a great establishment, and a quarter pound of meat runs you $4, add a side for roughly $3.50, and a beer for $5 (which is a great deal considering the crazy brews they have!).

"""Hipsters"" Would Save $ And Get More Service At Blue Smoke!Fatte Sau was a flat scene. I hope this kind of crap experience never reaches my favorite neighborhoods.My wife and I were shocked at the prices here and embarrassed that we went out of our way to try this place with her Brazilian cousin and his wife who were visiting NYC. We had canceled reservations at Blue Smoke in Manhattan (bad mistake), as we wanted to show our guests what Williamsburg Brooklyn was like. After jumping on the L train, we arrived thirsty for some beer. Each pint of craft beer was $7 a piece, but we really wanted to save one dollar so we opted for 1 gallon (4 pints) of craft beer for $27 + tax (I bought the first gallon so we didn't have to fight over who got to keep the dollar we saved). After a few sips of beer, it was time to order what we came there for. We ordered one half chicken, 3/4 lb of beef brisket, 8 St Louis style ribs (8 ribs, not racks), one pork sausage, 2 corn on the cobs, 1 cup of baked beans, and 1 cup of potato salad. Now guess how much that came to? Total for all of this was $108. Add the $30 for the beer (tax incl) and that comes to $138 + bar/counter tips, or about $35 per person. For a little less, we could have stuck to our Blue Smoke plan and enjoyed a far better dining experience. Below I have broken down the differences between the two restaurants...FATTE SAU   Food = Very Good   Prices = Expensive   Dining Experience = Rustic, primitive   Cleanliness = PoorAt Fatte Sau, it's cafeteria style, which means they slopped all our food onto one large metal trey, then our party had to self-serve to paper plates. They don't carry / offer communal serving spoons / utensils here. We resorted to pouring the baked beans from the cup onto your plate (?), and we had to double-dip with our forks for more potato salad. We shared a picnic table with strangers who piled up soiled-paper napkins that eventually spilled over into our party's 'zone'. Bussers did not come by to clean or remove garbage until we got up to leave. Waters were self-serve and the cups were a generous 3 ounces, so I/we had to get up from the awkward picnic table seating every time we wanted more water (I'm 6'-4"" tall, so it's a challenge to get in/out) . There was nobody refilling our waters (seems like a simple job, right?). One of two bathrooms was ""out of order"", causing there to be long waits. The people at the food counter had a very take-it-or-leave-it, what-you-see-is-what-you-get attitude when I asked about serving utensils and if there was more chicken and corn coming out (of course there did when we returned to our seats). BLUE SMOKE   Food = Very Good   Prices = Reasonable ($18-20 main meats, $9 sides, x4 peeps = $96)   Dining Experience = Above average (linen napkins, water & bus service, etc)   Cleanliness = Very CleanBecause of Fatte Sau's poor level of service and overprice items, I WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS PLACE. I went to Mighty Quinn's BBQ in East Village not long ago, and the prices were way more reasonable (we spent $75 for 3 people), the dining room and bathrooms were clean, and there were people cleaning our table as we ate, refilling our waters, and adding things like more napkins and wet naps.

Fette Sau is amazing!! Who cares about the long line -- dont let that intimidate you. The BBQ is killer. The beer selection is great. The whiskey options take you on a journey. All this goodness in a fun garage setting. The only reason this Williamsburg institution gets only 4 stars from me is because their side options don't match the quality of the BBQ. They aren't bad just not on the same level.,4.0
Very very good but not great. I've had better (down South) but not in the city. The problem is the super long line. The restaurant is run inefficiently with just one person cutting the meat so you can expect to wait close to an hour.  The folks are very friendly and if the line were a bit more manageable (and a little less carbon on the meat) then it'd easily earn a five star.,3.0
"Ehhh....What can I say that hasn't already been said.Firstly, I was born and raised a southerner, therefore, I'm extremely picky about any place proclaiming it makes anything ""Southern Style."" I would have been better off going to Bed-Stuy Fish Fry than coming here...For one, I think the whole notion of purchasing by the pound is overpriced, and only good for large groups, but I don't think the food is delectable enough for the prices. The Pork Belly was okay, and the baked beans tasted like they dumped a barrel of sugar inside the pot, and nothing else. Unless you're just going for the kitsy, williamsburg hipster vibe, so elsewhere for your southern-esk comfort food, aka...go to Bed-Stuy.",2.0
"This place is excellent to take a date. Yeah I said it. If you want to get down with someone, provided you aren't dating a vegan, I'd take them here.

But really: if things are still clicking after you both have the 'itis and are covered in BBQ sauce, it was meant to be.",4.0
"The Pork Belly was the most amazing piece of meat I have ever sunk my teeth into. The baked beans were great, but they were a little too rich to finish the whole thing.

"this review is a long time coming as my first and only visit to fette sau was a couple of months ago on memorial day.for it being memorial day, the place wasn't as packed as i would expect it to be. my dining companion and i made it through the line in about 10 minutes or so. unfortunately, they were out of pulled pork, so we stuck with the brisket. i got a half pound (with the intention to take half of it home as leftovers, which i ended up doing - fortunately; BBQ leftovers never disappoint!) and a side of potatoes.the brisket was heavenly. definitely up to par with some of the brisket i've had in my lifetime. and dare i say it? i think it was better than dinosaur BBQ. but maybe the whole dining experience felt more authentic and thus, made the brisket sunconsciously taste more delicious. bottom line is that i'd rather eat off butcher paper (Fette Sau) than plates (Dinosaur).however, i think Dinosaur wins in the sides category. my potatoes at fette sau were only okay. not very flavorful and if anything, swimming in oil/grease. ehh. just not a fan of that style. i want my traditional mustard or mayo potato salad.all in all, i'd definitely come back to fette sau. unfortunately (or fortunately?), i live in manhattan, so a trek out to fette sau to fight the typically packed crowds, just for a second helping of this BBQ? i dunno . . .although, to this day i refuse to go to hill country or brother jimmy's or daisy may's. simply because the names try too hard. it would be like trying to find an imitation of home (Texas) and i just can't do that . . . i would only scoff at their poor attempt to be southern. i know, i know. #Snobi'll get over it. one day.",4.0

"this review is a long time coming as my first and only visit to fette sau was a couple of months ago on memorial day.for it being memorial day, the place wasn't as packed as i would expect it to be. my dining companion and i made it through the line in about 10 minutes or so. unfortunately, they were out of pulled pork, so we stuck with the brisket. i got a half pound (with the intention to take half of it home as leftovers, which i ended up doing - fortunately; BBQ leftovers never disappoint!) and a side of potatoes.the brisket was heavenly. definitely up to par with some of the brisket i've had in my lifetime. and dare i say it? i think it was better than dinosaur BBQ. but maybe the whole dining experience felt more authentic and thus, made the brisket sunconsciously taste more delicious. bottom line is that i'd rather eat off butcher paper (Fette Sau) than plates (Dinosaur).however, i think Dinosaur wins in the sides category. my potatoes at fette sau were only okay. not very flavorful and if anything, swimming in oil/grease. ehh. just not a fan of that style. i want my traditional mustard or mayo potato salad.all in all, i'd definitely come back to fette sau. unfortunately (or fortunately?), i live in manhattan, so a trek out to fette sau to fight the typically packed crowds, just for a second helping of this BBQ? i dunno . . .although, to this day i refuse to go to hill country or brother jimmy's or daisy may's. simply because the names try too hard. it would be like trying to find an imitation of home (Texas) and i just can't do that . . . i would only scoff at their poor attempt to be southern. i know, i know. #Snobi'll get over it. one day.",4.0

"Consistently delish BBQ. DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU WANT SAUCE! If you want wonderfully smoked meats, you will go to Fette Sau. This isn't your run of the mill sauce slathered BBQ. There is love in each and every thing they serve.My fave items are....brisket and pulled pork. The smoked peking duck was a nice change a few weeks ago.All the need is the cole slaw, pickles, rolls and some beer and you are set.I took off one star for the crowds that hover during peak hours for a prime spot to sit down. My suggestion is to just go early (5ish) and just hang out. ENJOY!",4.0
"I am sooo happy that I decided to wait in the all too common 1 hour line to get some of that BBQ goodness. Solid beer selection. Food was excellent. The pulled pork was pulled pork, nothing crazy. However, their brisket and especially the pork belly were amazing. Didn't have the ribs but they looked nice. Everything had this wonderful bark. I wanted to dive in. The staff was friendly. Prices were fair, a bit on the high side but you get what you pay for here. I'll definitely come back again, hopefully with a shorter line.",5.0

"Holy beejesus this place is GREAT. Let me break it down for you: BBQ by the pound; beer by the gallon and housed in a old mechanics garage. Too cool, right?Went here on the first springish day in NY with a bunch of buds to celebrate the warmish weather (emphasis on ""ish""). I'm pretty sure we got 4 lbs of everything and every side (I love, love, loved the pork belly, ribs and potato salad). I didn't have to wait in the queue (that's what boys are for, right?) so us girls nabbed one of the picnic/cafeteria style benches and waited for the grub. Every table comes decked out with homemade BBQ sauces - they have a variety - and rolls of paper towels! Which is perfect for me as I seem to get sauce over every square inch of me. We wound up staying so long that we sampled a ton of their beers, cider (barf) and capped it off with some whiskey. Seems to be both a really popular neighborhood joint (lots of babies!) as well as with the younger set.Not that we ran into this problem, but I did notice they seem to have more customers than tables and since you line up buffet style to get your meat, it can be a bit of a crapshoot if you get a seat after or not (so it's good to come in a group and split up like we did). Also be warned since it is an old garage, they have a huge sliding metal door that stays open the entire time so when the sun goes down, it can get just as cold inside as out.",4.0

"As Fette Sau newbies, my boyfriend naively called asking about reservations, and the woman on the end of the line did nothing to clue us in the how the restaurant was run, merely telling us that they ""didn't take those."" So, we were a bit taken aback when we arrived, ready to stuff our faces, and realized that you have to politely wait (or not so politely, I guess that's your prerogative... You can drink alcohol from the bar while you wait!) for your turn to order food from a tall counter where you buy from a short but well rounded menu various sides (but why no coleslaw!?) and various meats by the pound, all of which you can view through vaguely deli esque glass containers, which I wouldn't recommend touching since they're all probably covered in drool. But as vaguely animalistic and overwhelming this whole ordeal is, it's totally worth it. I'm not a fatty meat kind of person, but the brisket seriously melted in your mouth, no sauce necessary. The pulled pork sliders were also killer, especially with the sweet and mild sauce (but again, why no coleslaw!?). Yay also for the baked beans, but the potato salad was a little vinegary for our liking. I really want to try the duck next time. While totally not vegetarian friendly, this hipster Valhalla is a perfect place to bring a group of other vikings... Er, meat eaters, because the more people you have, the more things you can sample! Oh, and the bartenders were super nice too- as my boyfriend was fetching the food, I told the guy behind the bar that I wanted to surprise him with one of their Whiskey flights.

"Best BBQ in the NYC area. Being from Oklahoma and spending a lot of time with family in Memphis, I've been really disappointed in nearly all of NYC BBQ, but Fette Sau made me hopeful for the future of BBQ in NYC.  We waited in a 1-1.5hr line but took turns getting cocktails in mason jars from the bar to pass the time.  While in line, I met some fellow Oklahomans who now live in NYC and they also swear by Fette Sau.  When I went to pay, the cashier was from where?  Yes, Oklahoma.  This seemed like more than luck, it was a trend. Being in good company, I was getting excited for the food ahead. We weren't disappointed.  Get yourself some pork shoulder, brisket, beans and rolls.  Add to that their delicious beer selection and cocktails and you're golden.  There's a big wait but being able to get drinks while you wait and socialize with those around you makes it a better time.

"Cold barbeque. There is no excuse for serving cold barbeque at a barbeque restaurant. However, I'm sure their brisket and duck would taste great warm. The pork belly tasted like a pork rib you would get at a mediocre chain barbeque place, only with tasteless fat attached (which should have been the good part). Their vintage Holstein sirloin had an unpleasant cinnamon taste. You'd think they were going to grind it up and put it in a meat patty to be sold in one of those street carts.Their beans tasted like burnt sauce. At least they were warm.The sausage link was ok. I just wish they had eased up on the fennel.All the meat looks so good you almost instinctively want to say it tastes great.

"sorry fette sau, i really wanted to like you, but you are not worth the hour wait and the drive there to ""hipster"" brooklyn.we went there on a friday night and got there around 8ish, maybe even 9ish.  i forgot.  i knew i would have to wait at least an hour so i didn't mind.  we ordered:ribs: these were okay, but the meat didn't really side off the bones as easily as places like dinosaur bbq.   it was a tad bit dry and was just okay.sausage: these were good and i have no complaints.  the amount of spice was just the right kick.brisket: these were okay.  i wanted more taste since they were kind of tasteless and could have used some more seasoning.   they were tougher than i would have liked, but otherwise just okay.   these weren't the melt in your mouth brisket that i am used to.pulled pork: did not like these at all.  it was so dry and you needed a lot of bbq sauce.pork belly: this was okay as well.  it had a lot of fat and was dry and a little tasteless.  i understand pork belly is supposed to have fat, but at least be fat and juicy and be melt in your mouth.   if you want good pork belly, i'd recommend ippudo's pork belly sandwich (although this ramen place isn't worth the hour long wait either).overall, i don't mind waiting in line if it is worth the wait.  however, the food was so tasteless and i'd rather go somewhere else like dinosaur bbq if i am craving bbq.   (dinosaur bbq is worth the hour wait and the drive all the way to harlem.)  i was expecting mind blowing melt in your mouth bbq meats, but fette sau did not offer it.this place was also really expensive and not worth my $100 ish dollars.  i don't mind spending money on food if it's worth it, but this was definitely not worth my money.people come here because of word of mouth and because it's zagat rated.  just because it's zagat rated doesn't mean anything.   another thing i don't like is the way the seats are set up.  it's really hard to get a table and parking in the area is difficult.   i don't normally venture into the north side (aka hipster brooklyn) because i don't like hipsters and there's just nothing there that interests me.  it's filled with non-native new yorkers trying to make williamsburg into something it's not.   it took me a few years to venture back into williamsburg after visiting Sea a few years ago and it will take me another few years before i return.sorry fette sau, i really wanted to like you, but you really disappointed me.",1.0
Seriously some of the best BBQ I've ever had. Was in North Carolina and got BBQ and it didn't even compare to Fette Sau.I've been several times and have literally never been disappointed. Lines are long so definitely don't go if you're starving to death because you will have to wait. Highly recommend.,5.0
"Best BBQ in the NYC area. Being from Oklahoma and spending a lot of time with family in Memphis, I've been really disappointed in nearly all of NYC BBQ, but Fette Sau made me hopeful for the future of BBQ in NYC.  We waited in a 1-1.5hr line but took turns getting cocktails in mason jars from the bar to pass the time.  While in line, I met some fellow Oklahomans who now live in NYC and they also swear by Fette Sau.  When I went to pay, the cashier was from where?  Yes, Oklahoma.  This seemed like more than luck, it was a trend. Being in good company, I was getting excited for the food ahead. We weren't disappointed.  Get yourself some pork shoulder, brisket, beans and rolls.  Add to that their delicious beer selection and cocktails and you're golden.  There's a big wait but being able to get drinks while you wait and socialize with those around you makes it a better time. Looking forward to coming back soon!",5.0

"Cold barbeque. There is no excuse for serving cold barbeque at a barbeque restaurant. However, I'm sure their brisket and duck would taste great warm. The pork belly tasted like a pork rib you would get at a mediocre chain barbeque place, only with tasteless fat attached (which should have been the good part). Their vintage Holstein sirloin had an unpleasant cinnamon taste. You'd think they were going to grind it up and put it in a meat patty to be sold in one of those street carts.Their beans tasted like burnt sauce. At least they were warm.The sausage link was ok. I just wish they had eased up on the fennel.All the meat looks so good you almost instinctively want to say it tastes great. I really wanted to like this place, but it will be hard to give them a second chance.",2.0

"This place is a Williamsburg staple. Amazing food, even better booze selection. I used to live down the street from here (until the rent got too high), but come back to the neighborhood from time to time. I'd always go early and during the week so as to avoid the long lines.

"Holy meat.We went here to grab dinner before bowling, and at first I was a little hesitant. Good BBQ in NYC? It's as rare as finding really good mexican food here.The set up is great, it felt like a cafeteria except this cafeteria has food that can clog your arteries and instead of milk and juice Fette Sau replaced it with an extensive and might I say impressive bourbon selection. I wouldn't recommend taking a date here, there is no intimacy. BUT, it is a fun place to socialize with different people as they do not have traditional dining room table set-up. Long benches like the ones you sat at during lunch break in high school are filled with people from all over the US (and surrounding countries) sharing interesting stories, downing bourbon from mason jars (i LOVE mason jars), and enjoying every nitty gritty detail of the finger lickin good BBQ while warming up next to the flat screen tv that has a video loop of a fireplace burning.Basically, Fette Sau is an adult version of a traditional high school cafeteria.. Filled with bourbon and mind blowing BBQ.Meat at FS is by pound, and the meat and condiments come slapped on some wax paper that laid on a tray. Condiments such mustard, vinegar, and an assortment of different BBQ sauces are available at each table.We got the pork belly, brisket, and sausage.My favorite was the pork belly, of course because cammon' everyone loves pork belly am I right?

"After sightseeing through Brooklyn/Manhattan on a bike tour and hitting up the Brooklyn Brewery, my husband and I wanted to find some local cuisine to satisfy our dinner. It was about 7:30 and we settled on Fette Sau, a BBQ place, very reminiscent of our favorite St. Louis place, Pappy's. One important distinction is that they have a bar here! While we waited in line outside (for 2.5 hours!) we sampled some tasty booze. Liquor on an empty stomach? This place has it figured out. By the time we got our food, we were so hungry and buzzed that I couldn't even tell you if it was that good!That's a little bit of a lie, though. We had the pulled pork, mac n cheese, and baked beans, and I think I probably ate faster than I have ever eaten in my life. It was amazing, but I'm having trouble remembering if it was because the food itself was so good, or I was just that starving. No matter, it was a fun experience and made me love Brooklyn that much more. I guess the fact that we waited for our food for 2.5 hours and I still gave it 4 stars should tell you something.",4.0

On the plus side, I love the oversized beer jars, the general vibe of the place (including yule log running on loop), and the fact that the staff really does seem friendly and eager to help despite the never-ending line.",3.0
"Friend: It can't be THAT good, right? Me: Wrong. It's that good. That's all you need to know. Well, they also do whiskey flights. Um, yeah, that's exactly what it sounds like.

"Wasn't bad. The pork shoulder was a bit dry, but the brisket was on point. The server wouldn't let me buy a bigger rack of ribs because a tiny one was ""next up"". Not sure I understand this. If I want to buy 4 bones, and there was a rack with 4 bones, and one that was ""next up"" with one bone. I would have to buy one bone, and the next 3...also leaving one bone left. I'm all for freshness, but this seems to be a weird policy? Oh wells, on to the next one.",3.0
"You know a date is going well when you a) both agree on the two different half pounds of meat you are going to share b) recognize the beauty of a good potato salad and - most importantly - c) agree to throw caution to the winds and get the beans, because they look and smell too damn good.We got take out, which was fast. Service was super friendly. I (literally) ran back to my date's apartment around the corner, and took less than 5 minutes to unwrap all our porky, briskety goodies and start plating.Ladies, I'm about to get rullrull: get the beans.

"After sightseeing through Brooklyn/Manhattan on a bike tour and hitting up the Brooklyn Brewery, my husband and I wanted to find some local cuisine to satisfy our dinner. It was about 7:30 and we settled on Fette Sau, a BBQ place, very reminiscent of our favorite St. Louis place, Pappy's. One important distinction is that they have a bar here! While we waited in line outside (for 2.5 hours!) we sampled some tasty booze. Liquor on an empty stomach? This place has it figured out. By the time we got our food, we were so hungry and buzzed that I couldn't even tell you if it was that good!That's a little bit of a lie, though. We had the pulled pork, mac n cheese, and baked beans, and I think I probably ate faster than I have ever eaten in my life. It was amazing, but I'm having trouble remembering if it was because the food itself was so good, or I was just that starving. No matter, it was a fun experience and made me love Brooklyn that much more. I guess the fact that we waited for our food for 2.5 hours and I still gave it 4 stars should tell you something.",4.0

"MEAT! *pounds chest* Me like meat!  *pounds fist to table* Me eat meat and lots of meat.  MEEEAAAAT!!!Sausage.  Lots of Ribs. Bacon.  Rolls.

Reminds me of a giant picnic spot, except instead of sun, you get dim lighting filled with people.This place definitely the place to be if you're looking for BBQ. Not usually much of a meat eater, I could definitely say thumbs up to everything they had. We ordered sausage, sauerkraut, 1/4 lb (the min you can order) of everything except the lamb all served on a gigantic try, and it was mouth-watering good. I also am a fan of the free sauces & the buns. The only vice I saw was the LINE. Since it's self-serve, there were about 10 people ahead of us, and it took about an HOUR for us to finally order. The wait felt like forever as we were standing in line. So, either get there early or be prepared to play phone games for an hour. Perhaps they need to come up with a way to service faster.",4.0
"I got off the train from Boston at 7:30 on Thursday and was standing in line waiting for tasty BBQ by 8:40, with cider in a pint glass. Awesome.Seating is communal, the line for food is long, and I liked everything that I tried (to varying degrees, of course).Pork ribs: nice dry rub, tender meat. Pulled pork: juicy, good flavor.Broccoli salad: I know this is probably heresy, but this might've been my favorite thing I had from this place. Perfectly cooked and dressed broccoli.Half-sour pickles: crisp, juicy, very well seasoned.Baked beans: not as meaty as I'd hoped, the beans felt slightly undercooked to me.Rolls: come with the meal, I certainly wouldn't ask for extra. Basic large, flavorless, rolls.Drinks: tried the cider, which was good but a little sweeter than I typically enjoyed, and then had the Bourbon mule was I surprisingly liked (surprising only because I'm not a bourbon person, but I'm a sucker for ginger beer).Communal seating was fine and everyone was cognizant of not lingering overlong as people were constantly needing seats.

"Fette Sau, on Metropolitan Avenue in Williamsburg comes courtesy of Kim and Joe Carroll. The name means 'fat pig' in German and quite an apt description of how you feel after a meal here. The former garage space itself is a gem and the owners wisely kept the industrial look, leaving pipes exposed and the cinder block walls intact. There isn't much in terms of decor except for the beef and pork chart drawings that fill one side of the wall. The kitchen, dominated by the massive Southern Pride gas and wood smoker, turns out brisket, pork ribs, sirloin, pork belly, and the like, all dry rubbed. Only pork and beef is served and even the sides make it clear that Fette Sau is not intended for those with vegetarian preferences. Try to come early for the best cuts and also to avoid a lengthy wait as the communal picnic tables fill up quickly especially during the winter months. The ribs, pork belly, and steak are what you should be coming here for but always eye the meat once you reach the counter. And come thirsty. With Kim and Joe Carroll's previous experience with their first venture Spuyten Duyvil, it's no surprise that Fette Sau's bar is remarkable in itself. The local brews poured into jam jars and growlers pair well with the meal but it's the impressive list of American whiskies that will make you pay attention. So if you're still complaining of New York's lack of good barbecue, head to Williamsburg and be persuaded otherwise.",4.0

"In my limited list of BBQ adventures through New York, Fette Sau comes closest to replicating my most memorable experience of eating cue in Austin, TX. Unlike some other bbq places in new york, it's not a restaurant impersonating a bbq joint. Fette Sau's a no-frills, free-for-all, wait-on-line place where you walk past an auto-repair shop on a sparse block of Metropolitan and look for a small neon sign. Thankfully we got there at a quieter time around 2pm on a saturday because I can definitely see space being an issue with just 3 communal picnic tables in the small interior.  Along one wall is a pretty stacked bar where they also sell various local brews by the half pint, pint, and larger. Just out of curiousity, I asked to see the half pint glass and I quickly changed my mind to a pint. That half pint glass might as well be a shotglass. On the other side was the wall of BBQ: a display of various meats, smoked and steaming. Behind the display was the cutter, who took our order of brisket, pork belly and boneless beef rib by the 1/4 pound, and sliced our meat to order. At the end of the line was our metal tray with our cuts of meat, complimentary Martin's potato rolls, and our small sides of cole slaw and German potato salad. One bite of that brisket was all I needed to tell me that this place was worth coming back for. The fatty brisket was juicy and flavorful: it was just as good alone as it was in a sandwich I made with the roll, sesame-based cole slaw and Fette Sau's spicy bbq sauce. The boneless beef rib and pork belly were also very good but wow, that brisket was amazing. We ordered a 1/2 pound of brisket, 1/4 pound of pork belly, and a 1/4 pound of beef rib, and it was more than enough for both of us.  At $16 per pound for everything but the beef rib ($24 per lb), they aren't Austin prices but for about $30 including sides for 2 people, the meal was certainly worthy of the trip to billyburg. And that brisket is priceless.",4.0

"I really enjoyed our meal at Fette Sau. I like the quick service, casual dining, and good smoked meats. Not the best BBQ I have ever had, but I love that you can get a little of everything. TIPS- The main thing to do is snag a table before you order, or send one person to order while another gets a table. - Definitely don't be shy to ask the server how much of what you should order. - Don't be a buzz kill and get turned off by the fatty meat cuts. Smoked meats need the fat to say moist - Fette Sau understands that!- Toddler approved, my daughter loved the brisket and the rolls. Quick service was key to her happiness.WHAT WE ATE- Loin chops, never had smoked chops before, the pink can be off putting, but they ended up being our favorite. Super juicy, lots of flavor. Plus my daughter likes to naw on the bone. - Pork belly was nice and fatty, I think it took a year off my life, but it was worth it.- Sirloin tips, definitely good, but not my favorite, I would opt for something else next time.-Brisket was really perfect, couldn't ask for more.- The baked beans are outstanding, and worth the trip alone.

Don't come here unless you intend on ordering some of this moist, fatty, slow-cooked greatness, I'll quickly point out that the sausage was also very respectable and the side of spicy beans were good enough for me to consider getting seconds - a rare for me on sides. The meat is simply ordered at a counter by the pound and served on cafeteria trays lined with butcher paper; this made me feel at home. The rich, dark sauce must have had a fair amount of molasses and rendered fat but I couldn't figure out what other ingredients made it so delicious. I'm usually not an advocate of sauces either but, again, this one is worth trying - even though the brisket was excellent bare.Beer is served in large jugs - a nice touch - along with mason jar glasses.

The rich, dark sauce must have had a fair amount of molasses and rendered fat but I couldn't figure out what other ingredients made it so delicious. I'm usually not an advocate of sauces either but, again, this one is worth trying - even though the brisket was excellent bare.Beer is served in large jugs - a nice touch - along with mason jar glasses. My friends assured me that a line is common and when the weather is warner the place can get out of control. So, get there early before any meat runs out. Already want to go back.",5.0
"If I was just rating the quality of food, I'd probably lean more toward 5 stars, but when you factor in the droves of bandwagon-jumping hipsters, the long lines, the picnic style seating, the increasing number of touristy people constantly taking pictures of their food, and the relatively high prices (for BBQ at least..,) I think Fette Sau has to lose at least a point. I'd even say 3.5...That said, it's still worth going every so often if you're a big meat eater.",4.0

"being from what's known as 'porkopolis,'  i think i can fairly say that i know good bbq.  i've probably been a ribs connoisseur  since i was about 5.  i've tried a decent amount of bbq spots in the city but it wasn't until i moved to williamsburg that i found what i'd call my favorite; fette sau.  it's not just just the cool, down to earth vibe, or the fact that they sell craft beers by the gallon, it's that they have the best damn bbq in the city.  i said it!  it's really good...not only is the bbq phenomenal, the baked beans are like no other you'll ever have.  theirs are cooked with pork ends and you can imagine what that does to the flavor.  smokey, a little spicey and a lot of delicious!the menu's simple but know what you're in for when you get online.  you order the meat by the pound and sides you order individually.  last time i was there, we did a pound of the pulled pork, a pound of the ribeye and a pound of the brisket with a few sides of beans.  it was more than enough for four people but we did manage to polish it all off.  if you're not sure how much to order, just ask the guys behind the counter, they're super helpful. go early, order a lot and enjoy!",5.0
Cool place and amazing food you might be waiting a while for seats though,4.0
They have amazing ribs. There is a long wait during the weekends. However it is worth it.,4.0
"Delicious, everything I tasted on this menu was just great. The beef brisket was some of the most tender and flavorful I have ever had. The beans were so smoky and sweet and they went great with the bread rolls. I don't eat pork, but ny friends loved the swine that they served up. It is the best barbecue I ever had. I am only giving this place a 4 though because I am not a fan of the seating situation. Bench seating kind of sucks and to get a table where you are sitting with your friends is kind of a pain in the butt. The food is delicious, but next time I will definitely be getting it to go as this spot fills up rather quickly.",4.0
"Love, love, love!!! My only complaint is that the wait for food was looooooooong but I guess that speaks to a great product. I literally spent a half hour just sucking on the ginormous bone from my one beef rib that could've fed an army after I finished. It was THAT good.",5.0

"I've been here several times. If you don't like to wait, get there at a weird time. It's open from 12 on weekends, so from around 2-6, it's usually pretty empty.  The sides are not great (I did not like the baked beans, and I love baked beans). The kraut is not as smushy, it's a bit crisp, so that was good. The pickles are not very brined, and they kind of taste like soap to me, but I still get them. I like the slaw, but it's got a sesame/asian flavor that some people don't like.Now to the meat: PORK BELLY. I always get this. I get the St. Louis style pork ribs if they have them, but they don't always and then I'm kind of depressed.  Brisket is ok.  I like it better than the pulled pork.  LOVED the spicy sausage (kind of like a hot keilbasa or something, really delicious), and the DUCK breast. That was the best duck I've ever had.  Always get extra bread, a bag of chips, and if I am really treating myself, the key lime tart.One annoying thing (besides having to hover over tables for a seat like waiting for a space at the Target parking lot on Christmas eve), is that the bar is separate. You have to go there separately than the food. It's usually a team effort.",5.0

"How have I walked by this place so many times and never known it was there? I feel ashamed to call myself a Williamsburg lover without having been lured by the succulent scent of slow cooked meat until now. Located on Metropolitan Ave just south of the Bedford stop sandwiched between places like Roebling Tea Room and my beloved Saltie, Fette Sau would appear to be just like any other nondescript alleyway if it weren't for the hour long line of people spilling onto the sidewalk.Fette Sau has always been on my mental list of places to try and the hour long wait was trying but well worth it. The waiting probably added to my enjoyment given my ravenous demeanor by the time I ordered my pounds of meat and sides. I was sad to not see the pork belly on the menu but I figured the pork jowl would be a worthy substitute for the day. My friend and I shared the following:- Brisket: Wow. Such solid flavor. Every bite was good, whether you get crispier, fattier, or leaner bites.. this was one of the best briskets I've had. Tasted good with and without sauce.- Pork Jowl: I had to google this in line but jowl is the cheek. If you look at it sliced, it actually just looks like a slab of pork belly or bacon given all the fat that is marbled throughout. I thought this was quite delicious but obviously very rich and indulgent. The 1/4 pound I ordered was definitely enough for my friend and I just to get a taste of it.- Pulled Pork Shoulder: Extremely dry which is not what you would expect from any pulled pork. I tried saving it with adding some sauce and putting it inside the bun to make my own pulled pork slider but the pork shoulder was still extremely dry and flavorless.- Potato Salad: Really solid. It uses a vinegar based dressing that works really well as a change of pace to the heavy meat options.- Broccoli Salad: I really enjoyed this. Long broccoli spears, sharp garlic and scallions, and a similar (if not the same) vinegar dressing used to dress the potato salad.- Pickles: I like pickles but I actually could only stomach one bite. The pickles had an overpowering clove or juniper flavor that I wasn't accustomed to with no other flavors or sweetness that carried through after.I was thoroughly impressed with my meal. I would definitely come back to try the pork belly (wasn't on the menu when I went) and the baked beans. Sure the wait isn't ideal but if you think about it, once you get to the front, you get your food instantly and then can dig in right after.

"Love this place!!! From the broccoli to the rolls. The  BBQ sauce that you almost don't need because the meat is all so damn good. Particularly the pork belly. Sausages are good too, and of course, so is the brisket.Careful to order w/your stomach and not eyes or you can run yourself an embarrassingly high bill, but it is worth it --and on the rare occasion you walk away with leftovers, they are almost as good that night or the next day. The line can be long so go during off hours if you can't stand to wait. Or get yourself some nice scotch or whisky since a line is usually inevitable. You can try to have a friend get some seats, but you'll most likely share a table, which is part of the experience.The only thing I dislike are the tiny sodas.

"Come early, the line is long.  Definitely worth the wait.  We had pork belly(which I didn't eat), brisket(yummy), baked beans, shredded pork(my fave).  I'm sure we had more, I just can't remember all of the fatty goodness.  Definitely come with an appetite.  The prices are not bad.  We had all fo that plus a half gallon of beer and we paid about $25 pp.  Only gripe is that they say the brisket is smoked.  I didn't see a smoke stack and the brisket was missing that ever present smoke ring.  Still good though.",4.0
"Solid. Make sure you go during a time when the meat is fresh or you may end up like me with the angriest roommate on earth eating a $10/rib meal which was more like jerky...love jerky though. Regardless, the pork belly is awesome and the beans are worth a try. Long lines generally so get a drink and figure out your life before you indulge.",4.0
"I've finally found what will become my regular BBQ joint. This no frills spot is amazing. The brisket is delicious, tender and so flavorful. We absolutely loved the pork belly and the baked beans. The beans have a sweet, spicy flavor with brisket tips (i believe) mixed in. Everyone raves about the potato salad. It's good, but nothing spectacular. I am, however, a fan of the broccoli salad and the homemade pickles.",5.0
"Love this place!!! From the broccoli to the rolls. The  BBQ sauce that you almost don't need because the meat is all so damn good. Particularly the pork belly. Sausages are good too, and of course, so is the brisket.Careful to order w/your stomach and not eyes or you can run yourself an embarrassingly high bill, but it is worth it --and on the rare occasion you walk away with leftovers, they are almost as good that night or the next day. The line can be long so go during off hours if you can't stand to wait. Or get yourself some nice scotch or whisky since a line is usually inevitable. You can try to have a friend get some seats, but you'll most likely share a table, which is part of the experience.The only thing I dislike are the tiny sodas. But everything else about this great-smelling and cozy joint rules.",5.0

The Hawaiian rolls just go so well with the BBQ, I just couldn't stop smiling like an idiot enjoying this glutinous bliss.

"Fette Sau is one of the best dining experiences to be had in Williamsburg... and if you're a New Forker, this is a must go. You know you're in for a treat when you can smell the smokers going blocks away!!! You can literally navigate to this spot through your sense of smell, as it will get stronger the closer you get (A LA MARCO POLO WITH YOUR NOSE). And once you arrive and see the line out to the street... its definitely time to treat yourself. And trust me... it's worth the wait. There is some strategy here if you want the best cuts and avoid the lines. A: Get there early... a nice 530 6 o'clock dinner never hurt anyone.B: If you do wind up in line (and you will) be with a group (I recommend 4) stake out a table get the seats with the three and 1 waits on line (alternate) and have the seated bring you a beer on line.Price: Buying by the pound definitely gives you the option of trying everything on the menu... Huge +. The prices per pound are not that bad considering the labor intensity of delicious smoked meats. Eating a meal that you wont wake up from will run you about $35 to $40 for 2.Menu: You can smell it! Fette Sau mixes some BBQ staples like pulled pork, pork and beef ribs, and brisket and throws a mix of lesser consumed delicious parts like pork belly, cheeks, etc. Additionally, staple sides with twists round out there menu. No sauce on the meats... just smoked awesomeness, the sauce is up to you with a choice of five at the table.Atmosphere: In an old steel garage, Fette Sau is that beautiful sit down at a bench with the rest of the riff raff. Looking at your cuts of meat on the wall from the chop chart and watching the yule log burn (on an LCD) makes you feel like you're there for Christmas BBQ. Bar in the back has a top notch assortment of different whiskeys, and there is a beer for everyone (meat cleaver taps are an excellent touch). Bar stools are old school wrought iron and are oddly enough comfortable. Big Benches for seating in a crowded garage filled with BBQ, Amazing place.Service: Guys at the meat counter are extremely friendly and will give you choice cuts (iff you want a fattier or leaner piece, just ask them, or don't complain) ask them for a bunch of rolls too, nothing better than making mini sandwiches out of the meats. They take their time and I think they get a kick out of watching you drool over the counter. Cashiers are friendly and will give you what you need. Bar tenders are awesome and will go over the different whiskeys for you and pour you a nice beer in a mason jar.  Suggestions: OOOOOOO MAN!!!! some of the most deliciously smoked meats make you feel like you're sinning at the table!!! The Brisket is off the meter. I've read some people complain about the fat content of the brisket, but I've had nothing but lean cuts here dripping delicious juice, and you can feel free to request lean cuts when they are slicing it to order... The Beef Ribs are also off the hook.... And if you're lucky to have the sirloin tips.... MONEY!!!As far as Pork is concerned... the pulled pork is pretty damn tasty and it's not swimming in bbq sauce or vinegar (that's up to you at the table). Pork ribs literally fall off the bone... no need to bit, just huff and puff this little piggy. The pork belly is simply amazing (must like fat for this one). Sides: The sides are a bit pricey for my liking, but they totally make this meal! The beans are the highlight of this one! Burnt crispy ends of all those delicious meat are mixed in with these baked pieces of gold... Potato Salad is nice and light, lots of flavor here. This should be sufficient to send you into a food coma.High Point: Amazing meal with good people. You can probably get full off of the smell alone. A nice buzz and you're probably taking some home with you. Low Point: No matter how much you struggle, can't get off the bench. Sleep over and start again I say!",5.0

"I'm honestly not a BBQ expert, but I know good meat, and Fette Sau has it.  My boyfriend and I got a total of 1.5lbs of meat.  1/2lb beef brisket, 1/2lb pork shoulder, and 1/2lb pork belly.  We also got a large side of the German potato salad.  The amount of meat we had was probably a little more than what we needed, especially given the fattiness of it all.  But it was all so good!  The beef brisket had the perfect balance of lean meat and fat.  The pork belly was honestly probably a little fattier than what I like, but it's pork belly, so what do you expect.  The pork shoulder wasn't as tasty as I would have liked, although the bbq sauce helps out a bit.  Out of the 3 meats we had, I probably liked the beef brisket the best.  It was definitely the most moist brisket I've ever had.  Probably the worst part about Fette Sau is the line.  We came around 9pm on a Saturday and waited maybe about 30-40 minutes.  The plus is that you can get a drink at the bar while you wait in line.  The only have one guy cutting and weighing the meats and one cashier.  I'm sure if they had just one more person handling the meats, the line would move so much faster.  Though it probably makes sense that they do that...no one really had to wait around for seats to open up, so I suppose it's the right balance anyways.  Lastly, the prices are very reasonable given the quality.  1.5lbs of meat and one large side came out to $34, and we were VERY full.",4.0

"I can respect the concept, it is a license to print money. My issue is say with Berkshire Pork, you could certainly taste the difference if it was grilled or sauted but to coat it with brown sugar and cinnamon and smoke it all night is going to muddy the flavor and ruin the reason for eating it. You eat Berkshire to have a nice med rare double chop or medium Berkshire Porterhouse.  It is good, it is actually better cold or room temp so you can taste the sweet and spicy in the bark. Burbons are pretty pricey so stick to beer. The sweet tea is also from a bottle, not home made. Again, this concept is sleek and clean and prime for franchising. I would buy in.

"I see you, Fette Sau.  I enjoy the ambience and overall design of this place, which helped me deal with the long wait for food (as did the mixed drink in my bag...what?) and who's to argue with pork served by the pound??  I came here with a large group of people, so we did what you're never supposed to do in horror movies and split up to complete our mission: one contingent to buy a gallon of beer, and myself and a few others to purchase fooood.  When we finally got up to order, our cashier politely inquired as to how many people were in our party, apparently alarmed at the quantity of meat we were asking for.  We assured him there were more people waiting to enjoy this steaming goodness, and lugged a tray piled high with pork belly, brisket, pulled pork, baked beans, broccoli salad, and a bazillion biscuits.  It was all rull good, my only complaint was the excessive fat on all the meat, but I guess that's better than it being dry.",4.0

The ribs were seasoned to absolute perfection, with just a hit of a spicy kick. But they were dry, fat from fall-off-the-bone. The baked beans were just as good as everyone raves. And the broccoli salad (more of a pickled broccoli) was oddly addictive, though I wish they were chopped up a bit smaller/shorter as broccoli stem is just filler in my book. The pickle is actually a cucumber in brine...salty cucumber, you were misnamed. Overall, solid bbq joint to sit around with friends for hrs.

"It's been a long, long time since I've been to Fette Sau but I imagine they are just as good as ever. I remember the bbq (I had the chicken and pork) being very tender and came with a variety of sauces. The pickles are the great, crunchy, cucumbery kind that aren't too briney and contrast the spicy sauces well. The baked beans are rich and sticky with molasses, and the coleslaw is even good - not laden with mayonnaise like most. The meat comes from a reliable source as well so you don't have to feel as guilty about your carnivorous choices. A large bar lines the back wall as well and plenty of beer, cider, and whiskey choices (including whiskey flights) abound. The overall decor is well done; I love the hot-pink florescent sign that is in no way indicative of a bbq joint.

"Really wanted to like this place... heard a lot of great things about it... but the barbecue was only slightly above average and the overall experience was pretty horrible.First thing to know:  Expect a long, slow-moving line. The first time we came here, we waited roughly an hour until it became very clear that the line was moving so slowly that in another hour when the kitchens closed we still wouldn't have food.  (This isn't necessarily a negative for a restaurant - they have a right to serve at whatever pace they like, but it raises strong questions as to whether the food is worth the wait.)Second thing: When you finally do get food... though there will be tons of places to sit, don't expect to get one. They will all be jealously puppyguarded by hipsters holding them for their friends waiting in line, still 30 minutes from the counter.  I'm going to repeat myself  to underscore how frustrating this is: 50% or more of the seats will be open. You won't be able to sit at any of them. I almost got into a fight with two guys who were, without food,  ""holding"" seats for eight, had been doing so for at least 20 minutes, and wouldn't let us use the space though their friends were still stuck in line.

The wait was ridiculous when I went but then again it was Father's Day and what dad doesn't love BBQ. The food was delicious though. The brisket was tender and the ham was great not too salty.

"Really wanted to like this place... heard a lot of great things about it... but the barbecue was only slightly above average and the overall experience was pretty horrible.First thing to know:  Expect a long, slow-moving line. The first time we came here, we waited roughly an hour until it became very clear that the line was moving so slowly that in another hour when the kitchens closed we still wouldn't have food.  (This isn't necessarily a negative for a restaurant - they have a right to serve at whatever pace they like, but it raises strong questions as to whether the food is worth the wait.)Second thing: When you finally do get food... though there will be tons of places to sit, don't expect to get one. They will all be jealously puppyguarded by hipsters holding them for their friends waiting in line, still 30 minutes from the counter.  I'm going to repeat myself  to underscore how frustrating this is: 50% or more of the seats will be open. You won't be able to sit at any of them. I almost got into a fight with two guys who were, without food,  ""holding"" seats for eight, had been doing so for at least 20 minutes, and wouldn't let us use the space though their friends were still stuck in line. I thought this was unacceptable, and called one of them an A-hole.

"In what must certainly be a scheme to slowly take over Metropolitan Ave, Joe Carroll has created a gastronomic holy trinity between St. Anslem, Spuyten Duyvil, and Fette Sau. I have eaten at Fette Sau several times and have never met a cut that I didn't like. I haven't had the pleasure of trying all of their extensive meat list as they are in constant rotation. Most recently I can attest to the Berkshire pulled pork shoulder, Berkshire pork belly, ans spicy sausage. The shoulder was tender, the belly just fatty enough, and the sausage just dripping with juicy flavor. Of note, I remember one time I ate here and they were offering a cut called the tri-tip. If you happen to be lucky enough to come on a day this is offered I urge you to forgo whatever you were planning to order and get at least a quarter pound of this. It was one of the most tasty cuts of meat I've had and every time I return I hope to see it up on that chalkboard menu. There are three sauces on the table a standard BBQ, another sauce that has a really strong smoky/pepper flavor, and a vinegar sauce. The BBQ is hands down the best as the other two can be a bit overwhelming but in moderation they are fine. A large whiskey selection and ample beers on tap served in Mason jars (you are in Williamsburg after all) help to wash down all that tasty meat you're consuming. The seating is mostly made up of large communal tables and the place can get pretty crowded with a long line during peak hours. I would recommend going shortly after they opened to ensure that you don't miss out on any of that day's meats.",4.0

"When it comes to BBQ I am as picky as a New Yorker has a right to be. Having eaten in some of the BBQ meccas (Texas, the Carolinas, hell even wild boar on a spit in northern Italy)I'm aware that BBQ is not something we often do well or consistantly and  I've accepted this about my homeHill Country has been my go-to barbeque spot and Fette Sau has a few somewhat superficial things in common with it. You buy your meat by the pound at both places. Both use rubs more than slathering sauces. Both hold brisket in it's rightful place as most important thing to get right.While Hill Country seems like a New Yorker's bad attempt at looking like a Texas smokehouse, Fette Sau revels in its all the eclectic charms of Williamsburg. Perhaps you might say -  even some of the hipster douchiness, but stay with me; this place is five kinds of epic.Some foodie friends invited me out knowing how I feel about meat. I like it. I like it a lot. I'd heard good things about Fette Sau so when I arrived at the converted auto mechanic's garage and found a line of intensely hungry people with sweating jars of beer in their hands waiting for food I got in line and started imagining.The place is charming in it's Samford & Son aesthetic and as I got to the counter I saw two women who looked like roller-derby bruisers (hot, tattood, muscled) expertly distributing meat.The brisket was simply the best brisket I've ever had, Maybe life altering The fat was caramelized and the meat had the most perfectly tender almost sticky texture. The flavor was intensely rich with a slight sweetness and a saltiness that amplified that richness. There was not much smokiness there, but that's actually a plus to me. Smoke, like spiciness, is pretty easy to do and if not done right just masks other flavors. This was perfect.I saw someone across the way putting some sauce on this brisket and I almost jumped over the table and smacked the bottle out of their hand. Then again I was in the throws of some kind of ""meat haze"" by then so I wasn't fully in control of my faculties.The pork belly was a fatty salty treat. Somewhere between a thick slab of bacon and a pork loin, it was all at once decadent and simple. It's a little much to have a lot of, but as a small taste of it was perfect. Don't get more than a quarter pound.I think if I had the pulled pork some other time I would have been thrilled by it. On a little roll with some of the excellent coleslaw and a bit of the BBQ sauce it was delicious probably in the top five in the city, but it was so overshadowed by how amazing the brisket was that I was wishing I didn't waste the plate space.The beans were spectacular. If I can again compare this to Hill Country, which also has some burnt ends of brisket in it, there were a far richer and sweeter baked bean than the ""cowboy"" style at Hill Country.The coleslaw was interesting with bits of cabbage, coleslaw and even peppers, though next time I might skip all vegetables and just see how much brisket I can fit inside of my mouth without dying.The beer selection was awesome with eight microberews served in jam jars or jugs. I was quiet happy with a quart of a very hoppy southern IPA but was shocked at how good the Manhattans my co-pigs had ordered. They had a bunch of great bourbons and other whiskeys as well as some good looking wines and interesting mixed drinks. They also had some great old fashion sodas which I would have tried but by the time I noticed them I was teetering on explosion.Fette Sau is not someplace to go that often. It's rich and complex and wonderful. It's like bone marrow, tough to dig out but worth it if you know how to enjoy a delicacy. Sure, you have to wait in line, hunt for a seat, juggle plates and beer as the smells drive you insane with hunger. Yet it's all part of the plan, because when you finally do it sit down your mouth is dripping with saliva and when that first bit of slightly charred, salty, sticky, delicious meat hits your mouth everything fades away and there is only bliss. It is transcendent dining.In the end Fette Sau exemplifies something that love about New York. We are a city which for the most part considers itself the antithesis of the south and yet our namesake drink (the Manhattan) is made with bourbon. We are a city of strong characters and strong egos, but we will put them aside when it comes to quality. Fette Sau is quality dining.",5.0
"Is Fette Sau good? Yes. Is it the best BBQ in New York? Probably.Is it as good as ""real"" BBQ? No. But it's close.I'm a ""barbecue snob,"" if such a thing exists, and while Fette Sau is one of very few places in Brooklyn that I don't avoid, it still doesn't compare to the best spots in Texas--or even in Kansas or North Carolina. Take all your east coast and west coast friends, but don't bring your high school buddy, because he'll be able to tell right away.That being said, it's still tasty. The brisket is probably the best thing they do--the fat is delicious--but you can't really go wrong. And it's complemented by ice big craft beer selection (you can buy beer by the gallon if you've got a big group!).You have to wait in a long line--and it can be a pain to find a place to sit.

I loved the Brisket and the Berkshire St Louis Style Pork Ribs. I did not care for the Berkshire Sausage, the texture was weird to me, perhaps I am not used to fennel as a sausage ingredient. The sides that impressed me the most were the broccoli salad and pickles. I absolutely LOVED Cora's Broccoli Salad - no mayo, just tangy and garlicky goodness!  Guss' Half-Sour Kosher Pickles are so delectable, light with just enough flavor to balance out the heaviness of your meal.The sides that impressed me least were the potato salad and beans.The potato salad was different, again, no mayo (hate mayo!) and it tasted good, just wished the potato slices were cut into chunks to make it easier to eat. I liked the Burnt End Baked Beans - well, I love burnt anything, really, but they were a little on the salty/heavy side for me.I also had the key-lime pie tart, which was good, but pretty tart. Dad's root beer was awesome. And most of their beers are pretty solid.Overall, I would definitely recommend this place looking for some good BBQ in New York.",4.0

I absolutely LOVED Cora's Broccoli Salad - no mayo, just tangy and garlicky goodness!  Guss' Half-Sour Kosher Pickles are so delectable, light with just enough flavor to balance out the heaviness of your meal.The sides that impressed me least were the potato salad and beans.The potato salad was different, again, no mayo (hate mayo!) and it tasted good, just wished the potato slices were cut into chunks to make it easier to eat. I liked the Burnt End Baked Beans - well, I love burnt anything, really, but they were a little on the salty/heavy side for me.I also had the key-lime pie tart, which was good, but pretty tart. Dad's root beer was awesome. And most of their beers are pretty solid.Overall, I would definitely recommend this place looking for some good BBQ in New York.",4.0
"Fette Sau means Fat Pig and that's exactly how I felt in the most awesome way after eating here. A local Brooklyn friend recommended this place and I my eyes bulged at the sight of all the meat when we got to the warehouse type location. Tucked between big buildings this garage dishes out some tasty BBQ that is worth the +/- 45min line. I feel like the anticipation of it all makes you want it even more - we waited and waited staring at the slices/shreds/bones of meat being served on trays to the people in front of us, and because our mouths were drooling which with food envy we once we got to the order counter we ordered way more than we needed. We got pulled pork, pork belly, pastrami, sour pickles, coleslaw, and potato salad. The meat and sides are priced by weight. The sides are extremely necessary because eating the meat itself might cause you to have meatoverload. I loved the pork belly and coleslaw the best, my friends favored the pulled pork. We each left with bloated bellies and 2lbs heavier, thank goodness NY requires lots of walking.....",4.0

"So nice that you can get real BBQ in NYC.  I enjoyed the ribs the best---nice, slightly sweet rub with a hint of five spice or star anise.  Definitely unique and cooked well. The brisket was great in texture, and good on taste. Pork belly was nothing special---don't bother. Baked beans and broccoli salad were pretty good, though the broccoli was swimming in a little too much oil.",4.0

The sausage was tough and found nothing special. I ate with mustard but did not help. Sauerkraut tasted pre-packed store brand.

"Simply sensational BBQ!  There was not an item that we tried which wasn't outstanding.The Ribs were perfectly seasoned and smoked, with a nice pull off the bone.  They were meaty and delicious.The pork belly was as good a rendition as I've ever tried.  Smoked to perfection while retaining a perfect moistness.  The same can be said for the brisket.The pulled pork, while very good, was the weakest of what we tried.  This is not to bash the pulled pork, but rather to state just how exceptional the ribs, brisket and pork belly were.  If I came and had only the pulled pork, I'd have been happy.  The other 3 were simply highlights.Last night they offered sirloin.  A meat I've never tried off the smoker, the sirloin was flavorful and delicious.  Not sure I'd order ahead of the aforementioned items, but certainly well-done and quite delicious.Even the baked beans were exceptional.  Nicely seasoned, in a delicious BBQ sauce, with burnt ends in the mix.  I'm a huge baked beans fan, and this was as good a rendition as I've ever sampled.I am not a huge coleslaw person, as I'm not big on mayo.  That being said, they are serving a vinegar based slaw that is simply delicious.  Not soggy or wilted, but served crisp and vibrant.  Almost like an Asian style slaw.Their beer and whiskey selection is outrageous, and they have a fun selection of sodas.They do not accept reservations.  It's first come first serve.  They have a selection of tables.  Half are inside, half are outdoors.  Upon arriving, there is a line that everyone waits on.  When you get to the front of the line, you place your order, and it is served just about immediately.  All food (except for sides) is ordered by pound.  Make sure you order enough food, as you will NOT want to wait on line again.  The wait can be as long as 2 hours.After ordering and  receiving your food, you will then bring your food to an open spot at a table.  If you're smart, as you get towards the front of the line, you have a portion of your party scope out some seats--which  open up as people leave when they've finished eating.  If you are a party of two, finding a spot should be of little problem.  Larger parties would be wise to reserve a space just prior to ordering.All drinks are served at the bar.  Food and drink are completely separate--both in ordering and billing.  The bar is not so crowded.  Getting a drink--alcoholic or otherwise is not difficult.  The nice thing about this is that you can enjoy a drink while waiting on line.This is definitely an establishment to patronize during nicer weather.  Cold or rain can potentially eliminate half of the seating.Overall, this place is serving up some of the finest BBQ in the NYC area.  I think 5 stars may be too much.  I'd like YELP to offer a half star option, as I'd really like to give 4 1/2 stars.  Definitely a place to which I'd like to return.",5.0

I've felt that at one, maybe two other places.If I'm so 'meh' on the place, why give it four stars?

"Pork-tacular. I can't think of a more appropriate description for this place. Be prepared to wait, be prepared to stalk people, hovering over them until they vacate their spot at the table, but most of all, be prepared to feast.

Actually, the divine baked beans have meat in them, so maybe the vegetarians should probably just steer clear. The broccoli salad is really only necessary if you feel bad for stuffing yourself with meat, but the baked beans and potato salad hold their own against the meats.

Let me tell you the pork feast extravaganza that we partook in.3/4lb Kurobota centerloin chop, 1/4lb Tamworth pork belly, 1/4lb Berkshire sweet sausage, 1/4lb Black Angus beef brisket, broccoli salad, potato salad, & Doc's Warwick Valley cider.Yes, the DP and I are fatties. But how could you not be with the quality and heritage of the BBQ we were eating? I thought it was great how they were using heritage breeds. These are the breeds that are full of the rich fat and flavor that is bred out of the today's piggies. Seriously, the fat on the chop and pork belly was so good, the DP actually liked it which is a feat in itself. Even when the fat had congealed from the cold (we were sitting outside in the middle of February), the fat still melted into deliciousness when it met our mouths.The menu changes depending on what they want to 'cue, but rest assured that you are in for a porky good time. They sell their beer and cider in varying sizes and serve the larger sizes in gallon sized jugs which is perfect for sharing with your friends.

"Mmm Mmmm... ""Fat Pig"": My kind of BBQ. I like the converted garage look with rusty yard chairs out front and the fireplace on TV in the inside. A rustic and comfortable atmosphere... down to the service. My little anecdote of their service: Some guy was trying to cut ahead of me at the bar but the bartender was nice and attentive so she caught that right away. I definitely appreciated little things like that.Sharing communal seating wasn't too bad there. The line was nearly out the door--I wonder if being #1 on Yelp's Hot Picks had anything to do with that? There's only one guy cutting and weighing everyone's order. So, expect to be patient. Everything you ordered arrayed collectively on one tray and eating off the tray was a whimsical touch. Get a quarter pound of everything so you can sample it all!",4.0
"Meat. Bourbon. Beer.If you don't like what you've read so far, then don't bother reading the rest, because there's a whole lot more where that came from. Fette Sau easily equals the quality of Hill Country and Dinosaur BBQ, but far surpasses both on charm and ambience. We went on a Sunday around 2pm which was the perfect time to go. There was no line and still plenty of seating available. We knew we wanted brisket, and asked the lovely lady behind the counter to fill in the rest with her recommendations - which were pork belly and pork shoulder. The pork belly was ridiculous; slightly charred around the edges to add a smokey flavor to the succulent, buttery texture of the fatty part of the belly. The shoulder was a little dry, but that was easily remedied by adding any of the 3 delectable BBQ sauces that are provided at every table.The bourbon list was extensive, including an array of brands I have yet to try (and will definitely be making a return trip to do so). There were also some solid beers on tap, all of which pair well with a hearty meat feast.Bottom line, you won't find abetter BBQ anywhere in the city - and you certainly won't find a cooler venue to enjoy it in. So get off your keister and go stuff your face.",4.0
"Very cool place with an interesting layout and would love to hang out here for the bar area.  The food on the other hand just doesn't make it for me.  The sauces offered are neither hot nor sweet but rather bitter, the broccoli was swimming in oil - literally the serving cup was 1/2 full of oil.  The brisket was very fatty, when it slow cooks most usually melts through the meat, not here and it is not trimmed at all - so if you order 1 pound expect about 1/2 pound of meat and 1/2 pound of fat.  I love BBQ and haven't really found a great place in New York as it really is not the easiest thing to do well - Fette Sau is not the place for BBQ done well, you are better off at any of the BBQ places in the Memphis Airport.",2.0
"The gf and I decided to ride bikes from Manhattan to Williamsburg and eat at this oft-praised BBQ joint. When we got there around 1pm, the line was long and moving at a slow pace. It ended up taking me 1 hour to get to the front of the line to order our food. Getting a table seemed to be a difficult task, as people were scavenging for any open spots. Luckily for us, we decided to do take-out and eat on the waterfront. We ended up ordering the brisket, pulled pork shoulder, the short ribs, the bbq beans with brisket, and the mac and cheese. The brisket was very tender and flavorful. The short ribs were MASSIVE with gobs of fat (which I LOVE but the gf hates). The pulled pork shoulder was decent but slightly dry. The side were amazing! While cutting the brisket, they will take the brisket and shake it over the beans to get all the juices. They'll also grab scraps of the brisket it and throw it in the beans. The mac and cheese was very creamy (we ended up getting the first scoop of a new batch...very lucky!). Unfortunately, the pork belly was not available, which bummed us out given that it seemed to get the best reviews. Maybe next time...The restaurant gets a 4 on food solely. Not sure on the drinks or ambience, since we didn't stay and drink. But given that I'm a huge whiskey and beer fan, I think I'll be adding a 5th star once I get a chance to sit at the restaurant and choose from their vast whiskey and beer list.",4.0
"Fette Sau i have to say you were worth the wait in line. While in line you should eye people who are leaving and quickly grab a spot. I love that they sell beer and they serve it in jugs and you drink right out of mason jars. Your dry rub ribs are spectacular. I'm not a fan of dry rub and thought I would need to slather bbq sauce on it but no I devoured the ribs, brisket and sausage. I love that you serve bbq with potato bread. Your beans are so good it makes my mouth water just thinking about my meal.",4.0
"This is a very hard review to write, in part because this place is so great because for people like me who aren't ok just ordering one plate, you can sample EVERYTHING.  The only bad part about this 5-star approach to the menu is that not everything is 5 stars.So what is 5 stars?  Aside from the ability to order a little of this and a little of that, the gallon size beer is 5 star, and the pork belly is probably worth about 6 stars.Moving down the list, I'd rate the sausage about 4 stars--very good.  The baked beans were also in the four star area for me.Down at three, you'll find the brisket:  pretty average in my opinion. Going further down the list, hovering at around 2, we have the ribs which i really didn't like too much, and the potato salad.  And while we're on the subject of sides, i thought the options were pretty limited.Having said all that, it was a very positive experience, and really really a good price for all the food i got.  I would go back here in a heartbeat despite the fact that i was more or less not blown away by anything (except the pork belly, which really did kick ass).",3.0
"Fette Sau, like Williamsburg, isn't immediately inviting with its warehouse atmosphere, its self-service or its long lines. But when the wait is over, you'll be greeted by friendly servers, and, ultimately, great barbecue. I shared the pork shoulder, brisket, beans, coleslaw and sausage. The meat was tender and juicy. The barbecue sauce at the table was sweet and smokey, like the beans. I'm typically uninterested in coleslaw, but their version was no blob of mayonnaise. It had a light, sweet sauce on it with crunchy cabbage. They've also got a good selection of beer at reasonable prices.",5.0

Savor the tenderness and fattiness of the meat in between the potato buns- no need for ketchup or hot sauce. German potato salad was a nice, cold and satisfying side dish.

"Mmm Mmmm... ""Fat Pig"": My kind of BBQ. I like the converted garage look with rusty yard chairs out front and the fireplace on TV in the inside. A rustic and comfortable atmosphere... down to the service. My little anecdote of their service: Some guy was trying to cut ahead of me at the bar but the bartender was nice and attentive so she caught that right away. I definitely appreciated little things like that.Sharing communal seating wasn't too bad there. The line was nearly out the door--I wonder if being #1 on Yelp's Hot Picks had anything to do with that? There's only one guy cutting and weighing everyone's order. So, expect to be patient. Everything you ordered arrayed collectively on one tray and eating off the tray was a whimsical touch. Get a quarter pound of everything so you can sample it all!",4.0
"Meat. Bourbon. Beer.If you don't like what you've read so far, then don't bother reading the rest, because there's a whole lot more where that came from. Fette Sau easily equals the quality of Hill Country and Dinosaur BBQ, but far surpasses both on charm and ambience. We went on a Sunday around 2pm which was the perfect time to go. There was no line and still plenty of seating available. We knew we wanted brisket, and asked the lovely lady behind the counter to fill in the rest with her recommendations - which were pork belly and pork shoulder. The pork belly was ridiculous; slightly charred around the edges to add a smokey flavor to the succulent, buttery texture of the fatty part of the belly. The shoulder was a little dry, but that was easily remedied by adding any of the 3 delectable BBQ sauces that are provided at every table.The bourbon list was extensive, including an array of brands I have yet to try (and will definitely be making a return trip to do so). There were also some solid beers on tap, all of which pair well with a hearty meat feast.Bottom line, you won't find abetter BBQ anywhere in the city - and you certainly won't find a cooler venue to enjoy it in. So get off your keister and go stuff your face.",4.0
"Very cool place with an interesting layout and would love to hang out here for the bar area.  The food on the other hand just doesn't make it for me.  The sauces offered are neither hot nor sweet but rather bitter, the broccoli was swimming in oil - literally the serving cup was 1/2 full of oil.  The brisket was very fatty, when it slow cooks most usually melts through the meat, not here and it is not trimmed at all - so if you order 1 pound expect about 1/2 pound of meat and 1/2 pound of fat.  I love BBQ and haven't really found a great place in New York as it really is not the easiest thing to do well - Fette Sau is not the place for BBQ done well, you are better off at any of the BBQ places in the Memphis Airport.",2.0

"Of the several times I have been to Fette Sau, I can truly say that the BEST time to go is on a Sunday afternoon between 1 and 4, for the following reasons:  (1) hardly any line, either for the meat or at the bar, (2) always readily available seating (sat at the bar this time which was nice!), (2) plenty of time afterwards to become less bloated before bed!Anyway, what a nice day it was was Sunday 7/17 to jump on the L and make the pilgrimage to my favorite BBQ spot in NYC, albeit a little hot.  No lines as expected and plenty of seating.We eat alot so, for 2 people, we ordered .5 lbs of Berkshire pork, belly (which is plenty given its richness), 1.5 lbs of St. Louis pork ribs (much preferred over the beef ribs), and .5 lbs of the brisket.  The pork belly and the ribs were amazing as usual.  No sauce of any kind necessary!  The brisket has not been my favorite in the past as I have gotten some dry cuts but this time it delivered - very juicy and well marbled!   The pork ribs are always my favorite though - huge, juicy, rubbed perfectly.  Just amazing.For sides, we got the pickles, cole slaw, german pot salad, and baked beans - all small orders.  All very good but never mind blowing.  Baked beans with burnt ends are the highlight.   Minor criticism - wish they had something fried and/or something macaroni based.  No big deal, I will live.Couple pints of Captain Lawrence each to wash it down.  Great afternoon.  Best BBQ place in NYC and it's not even close if you like this style.",4.0
"While more affordable than Fatty 'Cue, this place is better at late-night sliders and delicious craft beers than at meats. The sides are generally decent, but the brisket was greasy or dry-- never that succulent, marinated quality that you'd seek in a brisket.The sliders are worth the wait, and the beer is too, but if you're in the hood jonesing for a real meal and it's not too late, Siam Orchid offers cozier atmosphere and tastier fare for about the same price.

How is this possible?""  So much flavor, so juicy, not too fatty.  It's not food that leaves you feeling ready to go for a walk or a run afterwards, but what are you expecting?The downside: the wait.  I usually have to wait 45-60 minutes in line, and it can sometimes be hard to find table space.  I have waited up to 1.5 hours just to eat, and felt stupid as I waited, but I always ALWAYS feel like it was worth it when I'm eating.  I've heard of people going at lunch time and having no problem at all, but be ready to wait if going for dinner.",5.0

The cole slaw was also surprisingly good, as I'm not usually a fan of coleslaw.The decor was neat... you get to noticing every inch of it from standing there so long, you at least come to appreciate that.",2.0
"When a place has this many reviews (470+), you know that it is a popular spot. It's all been said, so this will be brief:Pros: Unique ambiance (for NYC - we are not in the south, so I am not going to compare Fette Sau to ""True Southern BBQ"" joints.Solid selection of meats. Its all about meat here, of course.Friendly conversation abounds (if you can grab a seat at one of the inside tables in the winter)Fantastic Beer/Bourbon selectionCons:Long lines (at peak hours) Difficult to find a seat for more than 2 people during winter months(tip: You can eat at the bar)That feeling that you are about to explode once you stand up. . .",4.0
"Of the several times I have been to Fette Sau, I can truly say that the BEST time to go is on a Sunday afternoon between 1 and 4, for the following reasons:  (1) hardly any line, either for the meat or at the bar, (2) always readily available seating (sat at the bar this time which was nice!), (2) plenty of time afterwards to become less bloated before bed!Anyway, what a nice day it was was Sunday 7/17 to jump on the L and make the pilgrimage to my favorite BBQ spot in NYC, albeit a little hot.  No lines as expected and plenty of seating.We eat alot so, for 2 people, we ordered .5 lbs of Berkshire pork, belly (which is plenty given its richness), 1.5 lbs of St. Louis pork ribs (much preferred over the beef ribs), and .5 lbs of the brisket.  The pork belly and the ribs were amazing as usual.  No sauce of any kind necessary!  The brisket has not been my favorite in the past as I have gotten some dry cuts but this time it delivered - very juicy and well marbled!   The pork ribs are always my favorite though - huge, juicy, rubbed perfectly.  Just amazing.For sides, we got the pickles, cole slaw, german pot salad, and baked beans - all small orders.  All very good but never mind blowing.  Baked beans with burnt ends are the highlight.   Minor criticism - wish they had something fried and/or something macaroni based.  No big deal, I will live.Couple pints of Captain Lawrence each to wash it down.  Great afternoon.  Best BBQ place in NYC and it's not even close if you like this style.",4.0
"While more affordable than Fatty 'Cue, this place is better at late-night sliders and delicious craft beers than at meats. The sides are generally decent, but the brisket was greasy or dry-- never that succulent, marinated quality that you'd seek in a brisket.The sliders are worth the wait, and the beer is too, but if you're in the hood jonesing for a real meal and it's not too late, Siam Orchid offers cozier atmosphere and tastier fare for about the same price. And if you want BBQ and have money to spend on local meats, trot the eight blocks to Fatty Cue and wrap your mandibles around some more meltworthy beast.",3.0
"I have come about 8 times now, only after 7pm, including once or twice after the kitchen closed; I would come more often if I didn't live in New Jersey.I used to think Dinosaur BBQ in Harlem was the best BBQ in the NYC area, but I was way off.  Fette Sau blows them absolutely out of the water.  Every meat we have ever gotten at Fette has been just incredible; like where you just roll your eyes and ask ""Seriously? How is this possible?""  So much flavor, so juicy, not too fatty.  It's not food that leaves you feeling ready to go for a walk or a run afterwards, but what are you expecting?The downside: the wait.  I usually have to wait 45-60 minutes in line, and it can sometimes be hard to find table space.  I have waited up to 1.5 hours just to eat, and felt stupid as I waited, but I always ALWAYS feel like it was worth it when I'm eating.  I've heard of people going at lunch time and having no problem at all, but be ready to wait if going for dinner.",5.0

"My boyfriend and I arrived around 2pm on the Sunday of Labor Day weekend. I was expecting a line considering the holiday, but was pleasantly surprised when there was virtually no line and some seating inside the building. We order 1/4 lb of everything they had on the menu at that time - total of 1 1/4 lb of food to split. Our plate included: pork shoulder, pork belly, brisket, ribs and sausage. We got one side of black beans which was meat filled and amazing. The only BBQ I have had in New York City previously was at Southern Hospitality (terrible) and Blue Smoke (fantastic). The BBQ served at Fette Sau easily beats them both and to be fair Blue Smoke is pretty damn great. They change their menu throughout the day (we saw steaks available after we ordered). As everything we had was so amazing I would like to go back to see what else they have in store. The prices are steep, but you don't need to tip for a server (unless you order a drink at the bar) and everything is well worth the cost. The atmosphere is very relaxed. We sat at the bar which is well stocked with beer and whiskey. The bartender was attentive, but didn't rush us at all. My boyfriend noticed that she was nice enough to provide 2 small beer samples to a patron who was undecided. They also offer their beers in 1/2 pints which is perfect if you want to sample many of the 10 taps they have available. I gave Fette Sau 5 stars, cause I don't have a single reason to give it one star less. Enjoy their BBQ and if there's a wait - trust me it's worth it. One suggestion - I think we made the right call by going early afternoon on a Sunday. Most people are eating brunch at this time. Eat BBQ instead!",5.0

YES.Some minor songs on the hit parade: Gus's Pickles, which are an interesting compliment but felt a little out of place given their lower east side Jewish roots and this is the hipster shrine to PORK.  YES, I SAID IT, this place is a SHRINE TO PORK.  The potato salad is tasty if not remarkable.  Oh, and the beans were actually quite delicious, so I'd recommend those.If you want to get your inner (or outer) hipster on and love some barbecue, head on down to Fette Sau.  It's sure to please. Love it, need it, want it, use it, get over it.",4.0
"Fette Sau has officially ruined all other BBQ for me.  Although I'm not the biggest fan of Hipster-ville Williamsburg, I make my way out there at least 1-2 weekends a month for some tasty morsels of meat.   Some of the staples you can find there are Ribs, Pulled Pork and Brisket.   All of which are highly recommended!   I'm not a baked beans kinda guy either, but my friends are all in love with the burnt ends baked beans there...sometimes you'll hit the jackpot and find huge chunks of meat in them.     This place is a little pricey and you'll want to try everything they have to offer.   There are usually 6-7 types of meat pork or beef dishes per day.  The menu changes daily but never disappoints.  The cafeteria style line and seating arrangements can be a little cumbersome in the summertime as the line will normally number 30+ people.  Upon arriving at the serving station, you will find yourself presented with delectable cuts of meat which are listed price per pound.  I highly recommend the flank steak and brisket.  Fette Sau also offers a rather huge selection of whiskey and a good selection of beers.  The beers are served in mason jars ranging from a small cup to a gallon jug.  Thats right.....you can buy a gallon of beer.   If you're a fan of BBQ...or just meat in general, check out Fette Sau.  Bring an appetite!!",5.0
"OK Fette Sau. You come highly recommended by New York Magazine: Critic's Pick.  Nice! One of a handful of Brooklyn restaurants mentioned in the recent ""Where To Eat"" edition.

To the 1/4 lb!  I love sitting cafeteria style, next to random people having random conversations.  And the decor is?  Well... authentic.  It's an authentic old auto parts store.  How's the food?  Yeah.  I guess that's prevalent.  The meat is spectacular.  Really.  Perfectly marbled cuts of brisket.  Not dry, not too fatty.  Delectable pulled pork.  The ribs are formidable.  The sauces range from inedible to pedestrian.  I went for the pedestrian.  Sweet and tangy. Good, but not wheel changing.  The sides lack passion.  The collared greens were flavorless.  The baked beans were WAY to sweet.  Could barely eat them (and I'm a Fat Pig, see above.) However, the Manhattan Special Sarsaparilla (it's a pretty good one. No Sioux City Sarsaparilla, but good) was delicious.  Excellent selection of craft beer on tap. Served at a very attractive bar, replete with stools fashioned out of old John Deere tractor seats. Authentic! All in all Fette Sau, you were attractive, you had attitude, very tasty meats, delicious sarsaparillas, substandard sauces and below substandard sides.  You get 3 stars.

The sides were ok, potato salad tasted like it was soaked for days in vinegar, but the baked beans and pickles were good. I have read a lot of reviews, and it seems like an ""off night"" is pretty common, but, for the price- $56 of food for a light meal for 2, off nights really can't be this far off.

German potato salad was nothing to write back home to Germany about.Lastly, the rustic decor, communal seating and dark lighting set the mood to chow down with your fellow bbq enthusiasts. The meat will always serve as great conversation with the group sitting aside.Did I mention I smelled like bbq smoke the whole way home?

"Disappointing. On a number of levels, really, although I think it's a cute concept. The BBQ was dry, lukewarm, a bit overdone (all of these problems may be related obviously) and lacked smoke flavor, although the beef brisket was better than our other selections. Not so bad that it couldn't be saved by some kick-ass sauce ... but the sauce options were SERIOUSLY weak and basically amounted to (i) ketchup, (ii) mustard and (iii) vinegar. WTF? They really seem to have put no effort at all into the sauce. Did the sides save the day? No. The one that I tried, the coleslaw, was very bland.And then there's the seating, which takes the cafeteria-style concept a bit too literally, right down to the awkwardness of having to carry your tray of meat around the room for several minutes waiting for a table to open up. Would in theory be willing to tolerate this because it's not their fault that they're busy -- but when the BBQ is average at best this contributes toward making the entire experience off-putting. Maybe I came on an off-night, but they're pretty close to screwing up a concept that I didn't think could possibly be screwed up. It could be ""fun"" with the right group, but the same could be said of a number of restaurants in Times Square. In some ways this felt similarly theme-parky but with a hipster rather than tourist aesthetic.",2.0

The meat will always serve as great conversation with the group sitting aside.Did I mention I smelled like bbq smoke the whole way home? Get here as early as possible if you want to beat the lines and sit comfortably indoors or outdoors. After 7pm on a weekday and I'd say good luck. Hipster line out the door for sure. You'd swear there was a salvation army drive.",4.0
"Disappointing. On a number of levels, really, although I think it's a cute concept. The BBQ was dry, lukewarm, a bit overdone (all of these problems may be related obviously) and lacked smoke flavor, although the beef brisket was better than our other selections. Not so bad that it couldn't be saved by some kick-ass sauce ... but the sauce options were SERIOUSLY weak and basically amounted to (i) ketchup, (ii) mustard and (iii) vinegar. WTF? They really seem to have put no effort at all into the sauce. Did the sides save the day? No. The one that I tried, the coleslaw, was very bland.And then there's the seating, which takes the cafeteria-style concept a bit too literally, right down to the awkwardness of having to carry your tray of meat around the room for several minutes waiting for a table to open up. Would in theory be willing to tolerate this because it's not their fault that they're busy -- but when the BBQ is average at best this contributes toward making the entire experience off-putting. Maybe I came on an off-night, but they're pretty close to screwing up a concept that I didn't think could possibly be screwed up. It could be ""fun"" with the right group, but the same could be said of a number of restaurants in Times Square. In some ways this felt similarly theme-parky but with a hipster rather than tourist aesthetic.",2.0
"We were in the area and checked YELP for suggestions, Both me and my buddy were very happy we did , not only delicious BBQ but overall great fun experience .The line was about 40 min long,  it was a sat night about 7pm.Started chatting with other people in line and actually made some new friends.The house drink (served in mason jars which was very cool) called Thirsty Mule Or drunken Mule...just ask for the MULE.... was awesome ! had 2 each while on line made with Bourbon, beer, lime and I think seven up.... delicious and great little buzz to get things started. Brisket, good , Pork belly - excellent , pulled pork - great , beans great,   they had  just ran out of duck while we were next on the line but we tasted some from the friends we made while on line and it was killer .everyone just kinda finds a spot on big long benches and shares tables.fun place , relaxed and great BBQ ! great tunes in back round, I will BE back soon.",4.0

"Sad to say that recent meals here have fallen short of the once epic meat mayhem that I experienced in years past at Fette Sau. In fact, I dare say I've had better BBQ at Hill Country than what I gnawed on yesterday evening. But before I whine about the pitfalls, I'll wax poetic about the things I love here.The location is prime, right off Metropolitan it's an easy ride from the city and the front picnic tabled alley is perfect for kicking back on a warm summer's day. The staff is always friendly and unpretentious, the selection of bourbons and beers are a nice afterthought.But should you desire to dine here, be sure to get there around 7pm... right before the rush starts and a line out the door forms. Good luck finding a seat to enjoy your carnage as well, since for all the hype it does not inhabit a very large space. As far as your meat options, I found the 1/4 lb of pork rib was juicy but the 1/4 lb of was brisket dry to the point of dehydration and I hardly touched it. My side of Pickle Guys half sours was delicious, though I already knew that those were a winner. I found the potato salad overly oily and the baked beans were both undercooked and ketchupy. The accompanying dinner rolls were straight from the grocery store, but still soft and pillowy. Honey butter as a condiment would have been a nice touch. All this ran my a little over $20 but for anyone with a significant appetite I've seen folks spend upwards of $40/pp. And to be honest, it didn't scratch my carnivorous itch. Perhaps they've been off due to their constant lines and endless hype, but I'm still in search of excellence... and it looks like Dinosaur still has my heart.",3.0

But before I whine about the pitfalls, I'll wax poetic about the things I love here.The location is prime, right off Metropolitan it's an easy ride from the city and the front picnic tabled alley is perfect for kicking back on a warm summer's day. The staff is always friendly and unpretentious, the selection of bourbons and beers are a nice afterthought.But should you desire to dine here, be sure to get there around 7pm... right before the rush starts and a line out the door forms. Good luck finding a seat to enjoy your carnage as well, since for all the hype it does not inhabit a very large space. As far as your meat options, I found the 1/4 lb of pork rib was juicy but the 1/4 lb of was brisket dry to the point of dehydration and I hardly touched it. My side of Pickle Guys half sours was delicious, though I already knew that those were a winner. I found the potato salad overly oily and the baked beans were both undercooked and ketchupy. The accompanying dinner rolls were straight from the grocery store, but still soft and pillowy. Honey butter as a condiment would have been a nice touch. All this ran my a little over $20 but for anyone with a significant appetite I've seen folks spend upwards of $40/pp. And to be honest, it didn't scratch my carnivorous itch. Perhaps they've been off due to their constant lines and endless hype, but I'm still in search of excellence... and it looks like Dinosaur still has my heart.",3.0
Best BBQ I have had in the city. Every bite taken was phenomenal! Highly recommend! Will be coming back in the summer.Only complaint: I smelled like BBQ for days. I guess there are worse things.,5.0
"I'm not a BBQ expert.  I worked at a BBQ place in Austin years ago, and I like BBQ - that's the extent of my ""expertise"".  However, being a native Texan, there is only so much I can bring myself to pay for the stuff here in NYC.  It's not just the money, it's the principle.  Also, I prefer it basic, at least up here.  Nothing too high-falutin', no pretentious ""fusions"".  You've got to master walking before you try cartwheels.  Anyway, I was quite pleased with Fette Sau.  Their menu featured the usual suspects, much to my relief.  What I had was great, not just for NYC, but in general.  Being a condiment fiend, I was impressed with the effort put into the BBQ sauces (yes - plural).  You order by 1/4 lb. increments, and eat on trays covered with wax paper at communal benches.  Nice and simple.The prices were reasonable (considering the real estate), and the serving sizes were legit (let's be real - moderation is not a factor here).  Tasty, gimmick-free BBQ!Also, the cheap, pulled pork sandwiches on the after hours menu were top-notch, even from a crock pot.  I think I had four.",4.0
"I dont know where to start.. but really.. this place has it all.  probably the best BBQ i've had in NYC.  Think Hill Country but with outdoor seating, great draft selections and without the ridiculous wait(s).  I ordered beer by the gallon full.  Served out of Butcher knife taps.  How awesome is that?  The pork belly and brisket were my favs.  Baked beans was really good.  I could live without the Potato salad.  Plenty of parking in the neighborhood if you want to drive but only 4 blocks away from the L train.If you want to make it an interesting night.. walk another 3-4 blocks to the Full Circle bar and get a night of skeeball going!",5.0
"One day I was strolling around Williamsburg and wandered into this alleyway where drinks were served in mason jars and BBQ meat served on aluminum. ""What is this place?"" I though, as I wandered down the alley. Turns out I had found the entrance of Fette Sau, Unfortunately, I had already stuffed myself with food at Smorgesburg, so I left with a desire to come back and try their BBQ.  That day came when one of my friends from St. Louis came into the city for a day. After a combined 10 years of living in St. Louis, we've had our fair share of BBQ and we put Fette Sau up to the test.What we got and the judgement:1/2 of Brisket: We wavered a bit and almost skipped the brisket. Luckily, you can order in at least 1/4 increments, so we got a half pound of brisket and we weren't disappointed. The brisket was very moist and flavorful. Up there with the best brisket in NYC. 4/51/2 of Pulled Pork: I judge the quality of a BBQ place by their pulled pork and this was kinda disappointing. The pulled pork was dry and the bark was a little too caramelized. The smoke flavor wasn't there. I would skip this if I came here again. 2.5/51/2 of Beef Ribs: My friend never had beef ribs before, so we gave this a try. For the messy-disinclined and price-inclined, they take the meat off the bone for you so you get the bang for your buck without having to use your hands. Lots of yummy, moist fatty pieces of meat. 3.5/41 Small BBQ beans: Pretty good BBQ beans. I don't know how they get the smokiness flavor in but its adds another dimension to the BBQ beans.Note: I couldn't find the pork belly on the menu!!!!! And I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE pork belly. So we didn't order it... :'( guess I'll have to come back...We got to Fette Sau at 7PM on a Thursday and waited for 20 minutes to make an order, but the line quickly grew behind us and by the time we left at 830PM, the line was still out of the door. Surprisingly, despite its popularity, we didn't have a problem finding a seat at one of the long wooden tables. My friend pointed out the interesting decor, specifically the wall decorated with pictures of where different cuts of meat come from, while I was fascinated by their full whiskey bar. The prices for beer are pretty much the same ($6 a pint) even if you buy bigger sizes, but don't you want to carry around a 1/2 gallon bottle of beer and drink it from a mason jar like a hill-billy.A great BBQ experience in NYC. Probably one of the best in NYC and can tide me over until I go to the South. 4/5 stars.",4.0

"If it weren't for that new Cooking Channel, I may not have ever heard of Fette Sau.  Luckily for me, I did see a show that profiled the restaurant, and my friend happened to see the same show and mentioned going there since she lived kind of close.I don't really hang out too often in Williamsburg-- so I didn't know where I was going.  Good thing I had that Yelp app on my phone to tell me how to get there.  Yeah, i just plugged the Yelp app... and what?  But I may not have needed it because while walking down Metropolitan Avenue, I took a few sniffs of the air (a la Wolverine from X-men) and I just followed the scent.  Anyway, we met up around 5:30 because it opens at 5 and (1) we wanted to beat the crowd; (2) we had somewhere to be later that night so it worked out.  I'm glad we got there as early as we did.  Not only do we get some of the freshest cuts of the day, it's all communal seating--first come, first serve-- so it can be tough to get a seat.  But it also helps to know what to expect once you get there. The first thing you should do when you walk in is check out the menu and see what delicious cut of meat they have because they only feature six types per day. Once you've made your decision, the butcher will ask you what you'd like and he'll lay down this metal tray on a scale, almost precisely pile on what you wanted and that tray becomes your plate.  Knowing this will at least shave off a few precious minutes and the people behind you on line may appreciate it.Well, now on to the juicy stuff-- the food!  O. M. G.  The barbecue is some of the best I've ever had.  I love the dry rub on the meat--not only does it add a ton of flavor, but it also adds a really nice crisp, unlike some of the wet rubs.  The brisket was so tender, the pulled pork was good, but my favorite was the pork belly.  It was like heaven in my mouth.  We also got the potato salad, which was more vinegar-based-- i prefer the mayonnaise-based salad-- but it was still pretty good. Next time I plan on making my way down to Fette Sau, I'm going to call in advance to see what they have on the menu.  I was really looking forward to trying the cheeks, but I was disappointed that they weren't serving those on the day i went.  I also want to try to the beer next time-- those glasses looked pretty cool and the taps using kitchen utensils was unique.  I can't wait for next time now.",4.0
"Really good bbq place, I have come here a couple of times and tried a lot of their food.The sides, Hill country beats them in this category. Fette saus broccoli and cole slaw and pickles were nothing special. The broccoli was cold and not too flavorful, and did not fare well with the meat. But again, I don't care for the sides. The people I go to eat with always cry that they want to get sides, so I suffer because of them. I would rather spend all of my hard earned money on the meat! (no homo)The BBQ ribs, brisket, pulled pork, lamb breast is fantastic. In my opinion, much better then hill country. The meat is more tender and less greasy and prices are about the same. The ribs are very tender and have a ton of flavor.The reason I give this place five stars though, despite it being a bit pricey, is for their meat and also for their sauce. I LOVE their BBQ and hot sauce. They are tangy and delicious, hot but not too hot, and sweet and savory but not over the top.I also like the bread they provide better then hill country.

"Great BBQ for NY. I've eaten BBQ in St. Louis, Houston and the South East so I feel that I know what I should look for but at the end of the day the meat was tender and juicy. The food really tasted great and you didn't need the bbq sauce which I didn't even try. I can say with the utmost confidence that NY is not known for it's bbq joints because of the sincere lack of true bbq fans it seems. NY is populated with bad chains and this restaurant though it has its faults, is very good.The food was great. Beef Ribs were excellent. Pork Ribs were spot on. Brisket was the star of the show(I am biased towards that cut of bbq.) Links were pretty good but not great(too much fennel and no spice). Baked beans were the best baked beans I have ever had(not too sweet and not too much vinegar.) German potato salad wasn't great. The potato chips were surprisingly good. The cokes in glass bottles were a great touch. The problems with this establishment are standard to most ""Williamsburg"" spots. I am from NY, born and raised. This area was always known to me as a bad neighborhood which I have experienced in the late 80's and early 90's and now this town is the hot spot which still seems crazy to me. Now back to the restaurant, not enough seats because BBQ is trendy among skinny people(doesn't make sense) and the prices are astronomical for poor people food(bbq consists of cuts of meat that nobody wanted.)Very Expensive bbq with picnic tables.Overall Great food and will be about $35-$45 per person.",5.0
"I heard a lot about Fette Sau and was really looking forward to attacking some BBQ. I live in the East Village and getting there from the L was nice and easy. There are things I really like about Fette Sau, and things I really don't like. The likes: The brisket is wonderful. Perfect actually. The BBQ sauce worked really well with the smokiness of the meat. The sausage is amazing too. It's spicy, but not too bad, just enough kick to get your attention. Also the pulled pork is probably the best thing I had there. I want mounds of it on a bun with their sauce and I'd be in hog heaven. The dislikes: For a first timer it's a little confusing. There's no hostess, no wait staff and I wasn't really sure what to do. I figured it out quickly though. I hate the system they have in place there. I stand in line. I order and get my food. Go to the bar. Order a drink. Then go find a seat (which can be challenging on a busy night, especially if you're with a group.) By the time you sit down to eat, your food is cold. Real annoying. Over all it was okay. I may go back on a week night around 6, hopefully it'll be slower and easier to sit down.",3.0
"During the Summertime especially, you can smell the aromas coming out of this place from at least three or four blocks away. And if you do, and you're hungry, you will find yourself subconsciously heading in it's direction. The lines can be miserably long at times and once you're in it's communal seating so you're elbow to elbow with other diners but the BBQ is just so f**king good that you just don't care. Some tips... Go with at least two other people (I often see people dining alone there and I have to tip my cap to them. Getting through a meal there without help must be painful). Winter is the best time to go as the lines tend to be markedly shorter. During the Summer (and most of Spring) the patio is open which relieves some of the clutter inside but by a small margin so if you go, go prepared to wait in a big ass line for possibly a while.... That said, the brisket is delicious and juicy as hell. The pulled pork is also very good but it tends to go up and down in quality (as in some times drier than other times). The hot links are delicious and the smoked shank will blow your mind. Also the burnt end baked  beans are next level as well as the half sour pickles. Where Fette Sau loses points with me is sometimes certain staff members are extremely short with you and down right rude. That said, others can be quite friendly and pleasant. If you go more than once you'll likely experience both.",3.0
"Oh. My. God. I wanna eat this ALL THE TIME. My man and I split a tray of brisket, pork belly, short ribs, and pulled pork. It was my first time trying pork belly, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I'm a new fan. The rub on the ribs was fabulous. I kept licking it. The beans might have been the best I've ever had. And the sauces were delightfully tomatoey and spicy.My one complaint? No corn bread! :(",5.0
"Not exactly what you would expect from a hole in the wall place in Brooklyn, but man this place is a gem. I went here based on a suggestion from a friend that had heard about this place but never been himself. It was absolutely awesome, the BBQ was unbelievable and they have a great beer selection. Get here early and plan to make friends as all the seating is park bench style and it is usually packed.",4.0
"If it weren't for that new Cooking Channel, I may not have ever heard of Fette Sau.  Luckily for me, I did see a show that profiled the restaurant, and my friend happened to see the same show and mentioned going there since she lived kind of close.I don't really hang out too often in Williamsburg-- so I didn't know where I was going.  Good thing I had that Yelp app on my phone to tell me how to get there.  Yeah, i just plugged the Yelp app... and what?  But I may not have needed it because while walking down Metropolitan Avenue, I took a few sniffs of the air (a la Wolverine from X-men) and I just followed the scent.  Anyway, we met up around 5:30 because it opens at 5 and (1) we wanted to beat the crowd; (2) we had somewhere to be later that night so it worked out.  I'm glad we got there as early as we did.  Not only do we get some of the freshest cuts of the day, it's all communal seating--first come, first serve-- so it can be tough to get a seat.  But it also helps to know what to expect once you get there. The first thing you should do when you walk in is check out the menu and see what delicious cut of meat they have because they only feature six types per day. Once you've made your decision, the butcher will ask you what you'd like and he'll lay down this metal tray on a scale, almost precisely pile on what you wanted and that tray becomes your plate.  Knowing this will at least shave off a few precious minutes and the people behind you on line may appreciate it.Well, now on to the juicy stuff-- the food!  O. M. G.  The barbecue is some of the best I've ever had.  I love the dry rub on the meat--not only does it add a ton of flavor, but it also adds a really nice crisp, unlike some of the wet rubs.  The brisket was so tender, the pulled pork was good, but my favorite was the pork belly.  It was like heaven in my mouth.  We also got the potato salad, which was more vinegar-based-- i prefer the mayonnaise-based salad-- but it was still pretty good. Next time I plan on making my way down to Fette Sau, I'm going to call in advance to see what they have on the menu.  I was really looking forward to trying the cheeks, but I was disappointed that they weren't serving those on the day i went.  I also want to try to the beer next time-- those glasses looked pretty cool and the taps using kitchen utensils was unique.  I can't wait for next time now.",4.0
"Really good bbq place, I have come here a couple of times and tried a lot of their food.The sides, Hill country beats them in this category. Fette saus broccoli and cole slaw and pickles were nothing special. The broccoli was cold and not too flavorful, and did not fare well with the meat. But again, I don't care for the sides. The people I go to eat with always cry that they want to get sides, so I suffer because of them. I would rather spend all of my hard earned money on the meat! (no homo)The BBQ ribs, brisket, pulled pork, lamb breast is fantastic. In my opinion, much better then hill country. The meat is more tender and less greasy and prices are about the same. The ribs are very tender and have a ton of flavor.The reason I give this place five stars though, despite it being a bit pricey, is for their meat and also for their sauce. I LOVE their BBQ and hot sauce. They are tangy and delicious, hot but not too hot, and sweet and savory but not over the top.I also like the bread they provide better then hill country.

"This place is overhyped for the following reasons: -Pork belly - yes, I realize that pork belly is supposed to be fatty, but this was literally 95% fat, which isn't what I usually get when I order pork belly at other restaurants.-Brisket - tasty, but also a bit too fatty-Potato salad - this was probably the worst thing. Although it looked really tasty, it tasted like it was artificially smoked or something, and I tasted this weird taste as soon as I put a piece of the potato salad in my mouth. After several bites of trying to like it, I had to give up.-Cole slaw - it had bell peppers in it and tasted like their version of a Chinese chicken salad without the chicken.

The sauces that are at the tables are also really good - you must try them when you come here.

"At first we saw 'the line' and thought we could do it, but it moved slowly.  Normally, I would have left, but there is a bar in the place which serves beer/cider (among other things) in pints, quarts, 1/2 gallon (which is what I got), and gallon size.  So, while the line was moving slowly, at least there are refreshments you can buy while waiting.  I had consumed half of the 1/2 gallon of my cider just while waiting in line.The smell of mesquite goodness fills the air, but it was surprisingly NOT smokey.  Everyone was friendly and you could strike up a conversation with anyone about anything.  It was a friendly laid back atmosphere with some pretty cool tunes.Now, lets get to the meat and potatoes (pun intended).  Since we were waiting in line for about 45 minutes, the two of us figured to make it well worth it.  We ordered a pound EACH of pork ribs, brisket, and pulled pork.  For the sides, we got baked beans and coleslaw.  They serve this on a big metal tray (which I think is called a quarter pan in the restaurant world).RIBS - The pork ribs were good... but not falling off the bone.  I don't know if I would wait that long in line just for the ribs, but they were still delicious.PULLED PORK - This was great and putting a little bit of the sweet bbq sauce on it, I made a pulled pork sandwich and was quite happy.BRISKET - Unlike most places, the brisket was not all pulled and put into a pile.  They served slices that almost resembled prime rib.  When you went to pick it up, it fell apart (as brisket should).  A bit greasy, but well worth it.BEANS - These were good, with a unique taste, and not too sweet as most baked beans are.  I didn't see any little meaty surprise in the beans, but perhaps they randomly put it in.COLESLAW - The was a refreshing palette cleanser and the sauce was neither too vinegary, nor contained too much mayonnaise.   It was just right.  The jalapenos were not too spicy, but did add a kick to the slaw.All in all, I'd do it again in a heartbeat.  I would not go there super-hungry as that might make you cranky while waiting in line.  After you get your food, there are several picnic tables for you to sit at.  Just find a spot, sit down, eat, drink, and be merry as tomorrow the cravings for this bbq will be back.I didn't try the pork belly as being a Fette Sau virgin I thought I'd stick to the basics.  Next time, I will try that as everyone seems to rave about it.",5.0

"At first we saw 'the line' and thought we could do it, but it moved slowly.  Normally, I would have left, but there is a bar in the place which serves beer/cider (among other things) in pints, quarts, 1/2 gallon (which is what I got), and gallon size.  So, while the line was moving slowly, at least there are refreshments you can buy while waiting.  I had consumed half of the 1/2 gallon of my cider just while waiting in line.The smell of mesquite goodness fills the air, but it was surprisingly NOT smokey.  Everyone was friendly and you could strike up a conversation with anyone about anything.  It was a friendly laid back atmosphere with some pretty cool tunes.Now, lets get to the meat and potatoes (pun intended).  Since we were waiting in line for about 45 minutes, the two of us figured to make it well worth it.  We ordered a pound EACH of pork ribs, brisket, and pulled pork.  For the sides, we got baked beans and coleslaw.  They serve this on a big metal tray (which I think is called a quarter pan in the restaurant world).RIBS - The pork ribs were good... but not falling off the bone.  I don't know if I would wait that long in line just for the ribs, but they were still delicious.PULLED PORK - This was great and putting a little bit of the sweet bbq sauce on it, I made a pulled pork sandwich and was quite happy.BRISKET - Unlike most places, the brisket was not all pulled and put into a pile.  They served slices that almost resembled prime rib.  When you went to pick it up, it fell apart (as brisket should).  A bit greasy, but well worth it.BEANS - These were good, with a unique taste, and not too sweet as most baked beans are.  I didn't see any little meaty surprise in the beans, but perhaps they randomly put it in.COLESLAW - The was a refreshing palette cleanser and the sauce was neither too vinegary, nor contained too much mayonnaise.   It was just right.  The jalapenos were not too spicy, but did add a kick to the slaw.All in all, I'd do it again in a heartbeat.  I would not go there super-hungry as that might make you cranky while waiting in line.  After you get your food, there are several picnic tables for you to sit at.  Just find a spot, sit down, eat, drink, and be merry as tomorrow the cravings for this bbq will be back.I didn't try the pork belly as being a Fette Sau virgin I thought I'd stick to the basics.  Next time, I will try that as everyone seems to rave about it.",5.0

"This place is nothing special, unless you think it's special to wait 30 minutes on a line for mediocre bbq.So we waited 30 minutes on a line. I ordered 1 lb of St. Louis style pork ribs and a pound of beef brisket. Although everything was fresh, the cuts of meat were very fatty. I could hardly taste any meat in the brisket because it was 50% fat. This was not very pleasing to my palate. I know what good brisket is- this was mediocre at best. The seasoning was the only redeeming quality of this dinner. The St. Lou style ribs were only slightly better, but it was still a fatty cut. I would be ok with this, if the price reflected the quality, but it did not. This place is pretty pricey...ahem.. 52 bucks later.My favorite item was the coleslaw. It was fresh, crunchy, and flavorful, but my girlfriend disagreed with me on this, so you'll have to use your judgment. Skip the baked beans unless you're in the mood for undercooked food. It's a cute place for a date perhaps, but I wouldn't go back.",3.0

"WOW! When I picture Brooklyn BBQ in my head, i see a no frills joint, and that's exactly what Fette Sau is. Converted from an old garage into an amazing BBQ joint, this place is not to be missed. I had a sampling of everything from the pork belly, to the sausage to the pulled pork and some ribs. ALL AMAZING! What really surprised me were the baked beans. I hate baked beans, and let me stress, hate. However the baked beans at Fette Sau looked a bit more like Chili so I decided to give them a whirl. Outcome? I went back for more! The only con is that it tends to be crowded alll the time. So go prepared to wait a bit for a seat. Did I mention the seating is a picnic tables? Does it get much more Brooklyn? Love it!",4.0

"There is little more that I can add to everyone's previous sentiments. This is the best meat you will eat. On this particular evening I had the beef cheek, pork ribs, pulled pork, brisket, broccoli salad, baked beans, and sausage. Don't worry, I shared it with someone else and have not yet died from a blood clot or been bothered by gout...but it would be worth it.",5.0
"This place is an overhyped eatery that seems to cater to those who find it cool to drink beer out of glass jugs and mason jars.. And also, due to the hype of this place--and Williamsburg in general--to tourists. Yes, BBQ is pork and beef and sausage--lots of meat. Not a health dinner, I know. But good meat isn't all fat and overcooked. Their cuts had sooo much fat on them, a 1/2 pound of pulled pork is really half that unless you ingest all the grizzle. And the brisket was hard to even look at. Nothing remotely healthy on the menu, overcooked fatty beans, salty potato salad and unappetizing broccoli. The meat seasonings were decent but after a few bites my appetite ceased in spite of how hungry I was after a short 2 hour wait.  Advice: go to St. Aslan across the street, you may wait long there, too, but you'll get a much better dinner for probably the same price. Or Krif Hotdogs, if you're way under-dressed and need to save cash and want to keep it super-simple. Or one of a dozen or more other places in the borough that are worth the wait.",1.0

Charred but still moist and falling off the bone due to their long slow cook times. I do have a tip while dining here. Eat your food as soon as it's plated (trayed?) and don't waste time getting beers and whiskey. Go with someone and have them get the drinks ready.

The brisket was extremely tender and the pulled pork was top notch.The staff behind the counter were very helpful and made sure you didn't order too much food because everything is weighed by the pound.

"THAT WAS ENJOYABLE.I always avoided Fette Sau because of the Six-Flags esque queue that seems to form in front of their garage. Don't get me wrong, I've been meaning to try but I haven't had much time. Fortunately, today was my day off, so I met my company at the door @ 5PM sharp, opening time. No lines, we had the place to ourselves for a good 5 minutes! :)I'm going to itemize my review according to what I had. BBQ is serious business, so no fluff. I'll keep it simple.Pulled Pork: Full of flavor and vinegary/peppery notes, but ultimately dry and crusty. I would love to have drenched this in their sweet BBQ sauce, but I had other territory to conquer.Pork Ribs: Hammy, middling flavor. The quality of the pork was top notch, however... To be fair, I'm a bigger fan of beef ribs. Moving on.....Pork Belly:  Absolutely epic porkbelly. Full of delicious porky fat which compliments the dry seasoning perfectly. This is possibly my new favorite way to eat pork belly. Imagine a ribbon of the mosttender ham with a peppery aftertaste, lined with an exquisite umami ribbon of fatness melting in your mouth and you have Fette Sau Pork Belly.Beef Brisket: Wow. I had this last, and I couldn't get enough. I digress, I was porked out at that point, so the beefy contrast bade well for my palate. Tons of fat and tender beef: the best of both worlds. This is no thinly sliced dry brisket.  I couldn't decide whether I like this or the pork belly more!!!Additional notes: Broccoli salad is a nice palate cleanser, and was deliciously marinated (served cold). The cheaply nostalgic bread rolls are a step up from wonderbread, and are shamefully tasty after overwhelming yourself with protein. Long story short: PORK BELLY and BEEF BRISKET. COME EARLY.",4.0

"The best BBQ I've had since I was down on the ""Gut Trail"". Blue Smoke, Rub and Hill Country are all good for NYC, but Fette Sau's brisket could hold up against the best in Texas. The pulled pork was above average, as well. My one knock is the pickels and cole slaw aren't right. If you get pulled pork in Carolina you won't find that type of Cole Slaw. And if you get brisket in Texas they use a different type of pickle. It is a small thing that goes a long way when you're taking down BBQ. Still, the place was awesome and the Brooklynites (a line seems to be a common thing - no big deal, grab a growler) come in droves to have their top-notch 'Que.

BBQ is never cheap but that is expected. THE BEEF BRISKET is so moist that I cut it with my fork. I have to go back for more brisket and baked beans. Communal seating. I like the sweet barbecue sauce they have on the table. BUT I dont need it with the brisket. I like it as is.,4.0

Some things I liked better, others I did not.Ribs - these were good, but not great. I like Dinosaur's better, which tend to be juicier and are cooked with BBQ sauce. The version at FS were a little too charred on the outside (I like a good bark, but this was overcooked) and a bit dry on the inside.Pork Shoulder - fantastic! Juicy and delicious through and through. Needed no sauce whatsoever.Pork Belly - an interesting one.

Honestly it was the single most delicious thing on my plate (err, tray), but when you're paying by the lb, I don't know if choosing something that's 80% fat is the best way to go. I have to say though, those extra pieces of fat went great on the rolls, which were perfectly soft and airy.Sausage Links - not totally sure what meat they used in these (my guess is it was pork), but they were good. Fairly juicy, a little spicy, and a light snap when you bit into them.Potato Salad - this was a more German-style potato salad, meaning it was vinegar based as opposed to mayonnaise based. I really enjoyed it - tons of flavor from all the oil, vinegar, and whole grain mustard.Burnt End Baked Beans - deep red in color, a touch spicy, and filled with flavor. The addition of bay leaves and the burnt ends were very nice, however I tend to enjoy a slightly less al dente texture to my baked beans. I suppose it's a good thing that they weren't ""mushy"", but it made the dish feel a bit raw to me.Half-Sour Pickles - I have no idea if the restaurant makes these themselves or if they simply buy them.

"Gotta update this to a 4 star.My boyfriend's been bringing this home from his trips to Brooklyn lately (a lot of his family lives spitting distance from this place) and I'm really coming around to it. Still not my favorite BBQ in the city, but man, when it's good, it's REALLY good. Maybe even the best. Unfortunately, it's inconsistent so I can't give it 5 stars.Last night, for example, my boyfriend brought home beef rib (good), brisket (PHENOMENAL), sweet sausage (good), and pork ribs (still the best). The beef rib was the worst of it and it was still mighty tasty. And man, when they get the brisket right, it rivals Hill Country.

"5 stars for the food, 4 for the wait and semi-stressful seating situation. I am okay with waiting to eat something super tasty in the end and I also like the grungy garage vibe, but it does get really cold in the winter and since it is set up like a cafeteria seating system, its not the best for accommodating larger parties. I came here with a group of friends, so we ended up ordering a lot of food to share. For sides, we ordered the potato salad, broccoli salad and baked beans. The potato salad is not your typical kind with an excessive amount of mayo in it (gross).. instead, it is a lighter vinegar/oil dressing with a grainy mustard. Good balance of flavors and the mustard was not overpowering at all. I was a big fan of the broccoli salad - its light dressing of what I'm assuming was a combo of olive oil, garlic and crushed red pepper flakes complimented all the heavy meats well. Lastly, the beans .. I usually stray away from any beans, but I gave these a try and actually enjoyed them. I'm no baked bean connoisseur but one of my friends claimed that these were the best baked beans he had ever had, so they must have been good!  All orders are also served with potato rolls, which are perfect for dipping in the burnt end baked beans or that last drop of bbq on your plate..On to the meats! We got the pork belly, the beef brisket, the pulled pork, and a rack of ribs. Everything was so tender and had a perfect fat to meat ratio. The pork belly was incredibly rich and melt-in-your-mouth, and the brisket and ribs were really tender and flavorful. Add both the sweet and spicy bbq sauces to it all... so so good! Good bbq flavor with the right amount of smokey taste. Bonus points for good beers on tap which they serve to you in mason jars.

"The last two times I've left Fette Sau, in the back of my head I thought, ""They should call this place Cash Cow,"" instead.The surly, unfriendly, impatient man who cuts the meats uses the same knife for everything, and he cuts everything the same way (sometimes improperly), and he allows the juices from each meat to remain on the singular cutting-board, never cleaning it, placing the next hunk of meat directly on top of this long-standing puddle of fluid -- and the next one after that, and the next one after that, and the next one after that... I'm all for flavor, but I want my Pork Belly to taste like Pork Belly, not like Spicy Sausage and Beef Short-Rib and Pastrami and Brisket.To me Barbecue and Grilling is all about, to quote King of the Hill, ""taste the meat, not the heat,"" which sort of brings me to my next point. It is my opinion that the meats here are over-treated and excessively seasoned. What's the point of ""organic"" and ""grass-fed"" and ""free-range"" if it's all buried under copious amounts of spice rub?But that's not my only complaint about the flavor of the meat being hidden and disguised and adulterated. There's also the buffet display case in which all the meats are kept, it is my opinion that all of these meats are kept entirely too close to one another. When the man reaches in with tongs to pick out one meat, the juices drip on all the other meats, and this happens all day long... Yet sometimes, somehow, things still manage to end up dry and/or tough.Oh, and none of the meat here is ever hot, it's all luke-warm, because the buffet display case (mentioned above) is always kept wide-open, it's never closed, all the warmth escapes, leaving all of the meats oftentimes almost cold, which is fine for things like Pulled-Pork or Lamb Tongue, but definitely not for Wagyu Beef-Cheeks or Sirloin.On an episode of Top Chef a season or two ago, one of the contestants, short on time, threw a dish together before all the separate ingredients were properly prepared, and one of the judges responded to the hard-pressed Chef's claims that this was intentional with ""There's no such thing as al-dente beans."" Well each time I've taste-tested the Burnt-End Baked-Beans, they've been under-cooked and fibrous, plus, the chunks of meat have been bloated and bland. Yes, overall, it's very flavorful, perhaps due to all the juices of the other meats dripping into the vast vat, it's slightly sweet and slightly sour and slightly spicy, but I think they could perhaps remove these jiggly chunks toward the end of preparation and replace them with fresh bits, maybe even letting the whole pot cook a little longer, so that the beans could hopefully lose their consistent undesirable mineral-like characteristic.Sauerkraut is characterless, as are the half-sour Pickles, as is the Potato Salad, and also the Potato Salad, and so too is the Broccoli Salad... The only side-dish they make that I find even slightly exciting is their Cole Slaw, which, in all honesty, I really like... And the Habanero Chips (pre-bagged) on offer aren't half bad either!The Potato Rolls they hand out for every order free of charge are fine, nice and soft, but forgettable -- good for taking up space in an empty stomach and saving stress on ones billfold but not very much else.For me, the best part of Fette Sau is the terrific and affordable selection of beer.My recommendation is: go with a group of friends, share a gallon of beer (perhaps something by Captain Lawrence Brewery of Sixpoint Craft Ales Brewery, two of my regional favorites), on your big metal tray mix together the three house sauces (5 parts sweet bbq, 3 parts passila pepper, 1 part hot mustard), and order for each person 1/2 lb of Berkshire Pork Belly, a side of Cole Slaw, make sure to sit outside (it's better to be around the dogs in fresh air than to be around a bunch of screaming children in a dark over-crowded cavern), and don't let your high expectations get the best of you.Also, try not to get too comfortable: they rush you in & they rush you out.",2.0

"This place rocks. Not normally a huge fan of BBQ, but I am a believer after eating at Fette Sau. Got there on Friday night right during the rush. We found seats at the bar and waited on line to get our food. The smell of the BBQ meat smoking is intoxicating and keeps your appetite strong. Since they charge you by the pound you can sample a little bit of everything. Winners: Pork Shoulder, Pork Tounge Pastrami, Beef Brisket. So flavorful and delicious. All of their sauces are excellent and each really enhances the flavor of the meat. The beer was outstanding too. Will definitely be back and I'm telling everyone I know.",5.0
"They get four stars because of the meat taste...not the sides. I only had the pork belly. Ok I was in the mood for BBQ since it was the Fourth of July and no one invited me to a BBQ (it's ok, I understand *sniff*) So i looked on yelp to see what I could make happen and came upon a few places, but I decided on this place because of Doug G's review citing this place better than Texas. That's some serious boasting there, so I had to get inside. i arrived there twenty to five and already there was a line. I thought, ""good Lord i am glad I got here early"" and slid in where I fit in. I nearly passed the place as the sign was not lit since it was closed and the sun was still out, AND it is mad inconspicuous! I would have never guessed that the place that looks like somebody's garage and driveway behind chains and a wire fence was it!!! But it was! Thank God for my Gps on iphone which was reliable for once. smhanyway, I waited online with my friend and the line got longer. we finally were let in and i felt like a part of the cattle. Maybe that should have been my first clue as to what this would be like. I was about 5 or 6th in line and looked at the prices and nearly fell down. Geeze louise 18 bucks a pound for pork belly? 24 a pound for this and that?! Geeze no wonder the guy in front of us just spent 53.99 for what looked like he and another person. I didn't have that on me but neither did I want to after i walked in. Now I fought with myself because of this. I really wanted to give this place three stars and the three would be due to the meat taste but I had to be reaonable here. This was a place for pork. But I kid you NOT, the place smelled like death when i walked in. Now again, this may be because I am eating different things daily in my diet but I am not averse to the good old pork now and then. Betimes the sow is my best friend come holidays like thanksgiving and Christmas. But THIS- STANK! I would have swore a few just went into the slaughter before we walked in there and I am just saying this made me want to head for the exit, head of the line or no, ( and the line was out past the gate by the time we got in). The inside was dark and cool and most people had a partner scout a seat for them at the long tables while another waited in line to order. My friend made the mistake of sitting right by the line. Big no no for me as i hate people watching my food while i eat and they wait. They are hungry for crying out loud! The line and the table he sat at were too close to each other. The man who served was able to explain the system is by weight and I asked for very little of the pork belly. He gave me less than 1/4 lb and a side of mac and cheese. I paid about 12 and change with my card there and sat at the table my friend picked out. I decided to move to the outside tables despite the heat but the line was less bothersome for some reason there. maybe because it was so hot no one was really focused on me. There were no condiments outside so i missed out on using their BBQ sauce. The meat was bleeding grease on the wax paper they placed it on, on my tray. I moved it to a plate and bit it. It was charred to perfection and i enjoyed the taste. There was a flavor to it that showed it was well seasoned. Perhaps with the sauce it would have been crazy. But with all that grease I wanted to pace myself. I bit into the last bite and literally ""bled"" grease out my lips like i had a water balloon in my mouth and the water came out when I chomped down. But what do you expect, it is pork. Everyone was getting drinks served in jars and had large glass jugs reminiscent of something a dude with a wheat grass stuck in between his teeth would be in possession of. (Ah stereo types, shm). Now if you've ever had the mac and cheese from Amy Ruth's you would know why I could not stand the mac and cheese here. It was cheesy, yes, but it lacked the seasoning flavor I have been spoiled with by Amy Ruth;s and It was extremely filled more with grease than flavor. I could not wait to get out of there and so I did. The meat I had tasted good, but I am in not haste to go back to this place. Perhaps I will stomach going back one day, but if I am in need good mac I will go else where. Only the pork would I try and if I do make it here another time, i will try only the meat and it will be the pulled pork and the ribs- and i'll take it to go!",4.0
Yummy.The brisket and ribs could have used a bit more smoke flavor but were very good. Sauerkraut and beans were delicious. Prices of food and drink very reasonable. Staff also friendly and helpful - besides ordering a half rack of ribs we said 'and some brisket for two and a bit of pork belly' he gave us the perfect amount of food. Had we guessed weights (the meat is sold by weight) we definitely would have over ordered. Thanks!,4.0
"Okay, so update- I went and I tried and it's okay. I love the aesthetic of the place and I love the idea, but it's not my favorite barbecue. As a matter of fact, I'd go to Dinosaur over Fette Sau any time now that I've had both and can say 100% that I love Dinosaur more. Now, I'm not trashing Fette Sau at all because it still smells f'ing amazing, but here are my thoughts:1. My friend and I ordered a lot of food. It's really difficult to determine just how much is too much or too little. I mean, unless you're a part-time butcher, how does someone hungry for bbq know that 2 pounds of meat may just be too much? So I suggest to always skimp on the amounts, especially since everything is sold by the lb.  2. Of all the meat we got: Lamb shank, pulled pork, brisket, pork belly, and one link of sausage my favorite was the pork belly and the sausage. The brisket was eh, the pulled pork, I've had better and the lamb shank just didn't do a damn thing for me. 3. The sides: we got broccoli salad, baked beans, potato salad and pickles. The pickles were less vinegary cucumbers, which if it's your thing, then you're solid. The broccoli salad, eh. The black beans are good, but don't expect sweet, brown sugar beans. Lastly the potato salad, was alright. I wouldn't call home about it. So yeah, that's it. I so wanted to love this place. I loved it from smelling it, but as the saying goes, you can't judge a book by it's cover. You can judge bbq without eating it.",3.0
"Wow, this place is fantastic! While visiting NYC we came here on a Friday night for dinner and it was totally worth the hour wait. We met some really nice people in line, got a gallon of delicious beer to share amongst the 7 of us and waited in line to order food. We found a table big enough to seat our group and the food came up really fast. You pay the pound and we got A LOT of food. We ordered the beef cheeks (AMAZING), brisket, ribs, pulled pork, baked beans, pickels, potato salad and sausages. Everything was so tasty and the baked beans were by far the best side. I wish we had something like this in Chicago! I definitely didn't feel like I was in Brooklyn. I also loved the decor and the style of the place. Just another good reason to go back to NY!",5.0

pork belly.....too fattybrisket.....too fattyRibs.....perfect :)i didn't mind the potato salad but the coleslaw had bell peppers.....why??? i mean i am always down for new things but bell peppers in coleslaw????? i was sad.  still i liked the ambiance but i wouldn't rush back unless i was craving and was in the neighborhood.  Our meal cost $30 for 2 people.  About 1lb of meat and two sides.  I think i could get more for my money elsewhere....just sayin,3.0
"This place rocks. Not normally a huge fan of BBQ, but I am a believer after eating at Fette Sau. Got there on Friday night right during the rush. We found seats at the bar and waited on line to get our food. The smell of the BBQ meat smoking is intoxicating and keeps your appetite strong. Since they charge you by the pound you can sample a little bit of everything. Winners: Pork Shoulder, Pork Tounge Pastrami, Beef Brisket. So flavorful and delicious. All of their sauces are excellent and each really enhances the flavor of the meat. The beer was outstanding too. Will definitely be back and I'm telling everyone I know.",5.0
"They get four stars because of the meat taste...not the sides. I only had the pork belly. Ok I was in the mood for BBQ since it was the Fourth of July and no one invited me to a BBQ (it's ok, I understand *sniff*) So i looked on yelp to see what I could make happen and came upon a few places, but I decided on this place because of Doug G's review citing this place better than Texas. That's some serious boasting there, so I had to get inside. i arrived there twenty to five and already there was a line. I thought, ""good Lord i am glad I got here early"" and slid in where I fit in. I nearly passed the place as the sign was not lit since it was closed and the sun was still out, AND it is mad inconspicuous! I would have never guessed that the place that looks like somebody's garage and driveway behind chains and a wire fence was it!!! But it was! Thank God for my Gps on iphone which was reliable for once. smhanyway, I waited online with my friend and the line got longer. we finally were let in and i felt like a part of the cattle. Maybe that should have been my first clue as to what this would be like. I was about 5 or 6th in line and looked at the prices and nearly fell down. Geeze louise 18 bucks a pound for pork belly? 24 a pound for this and that?! Geeze no wonder the guy in front of us just spent 53.99 for what looked like he and another person. I didn't have that on me but neither did I want to after i walked in. Now I fought with myself because of this. I really wanted to give this place three stars and the three would be due to the meat taste but I had to be reaonable here. This was a place for pork. But I kid you NOT, the place smelled like death when i walked in. Now again, this may be because I am eating different things daily in my diet but I am not averse to the good old pork now and then. Betimes the sow is my best friend come holidays like thanksgiving and Christmas. But THIS- STANK! I would have swore a few just went into the slaughter before we walked in there and I am just saying this made me want to head for the exit, head of the line or no, ( and the line was out past the gate by the time we got in). The inside was dark and cool and most people had a partner scout a seat for them at the long tables while another waited in line to order. My friend made the mistake of sitting right by the line. Big no no for me as i hate people watching my food while i eat and they wait. They are hungry for crying out loud! The line and the table he sat at were too close to each other. The man who served was able to explain the system is by weight and I asked for very little of the pork belly. He gave me less than 1/4 lb and a side of mac and cheese. I paid about 12 and change with my card there and sat at the table my friend picked out. I decided to move to the outside tables despite the heat but the line was less bothersome for some reason there. maybe because it was so hot no one was really focused on me. There were no condiments outside so i missed out on using their BBQ sauce. The meat was bleeding grease on the wax paper they placed it on, on my tray. I moved it to a plate and bit it. It was charred to perfection and i enjoyed the taste. There was a flavor to it that showed it was well seasoned. Perhaps with the sauce it would have been crazy. But with all that grease I wanted to pace myself. I bit into the last bite and literally ""bled"" grease out my lips like i had a water balloon in my mouth and the water came out when I chomped down. But what do you expect, it is pork. Everyone was getting drinks served in jars and had large glass jugs reminiscent of something a dude with a wheat grass stuck in between his teeth would be in possession of. (Ah stereo types, shm). Now if you've ever had the mac and cheese from Amy Ruth's you would know why I could not stand the mac and cheese here. It was cheesy, yes, but it lacked the seasoning flavor I have been spoiled with by Amy Ruth;s and It was extremely filled more with grease than flavor. I could not wait to get out of there and so I did. The meat I had tasted good, but I am in not haste to go back to this place. Perhaps I will stomach going back one day, but if I am in need good mac I will go else where. Only the pork would I try and if I do make it here another time, i will try only the meat and it will be the pulled pork and the ribs- and i'll take it to go!",4.0
Yummy.The brisket and ribs could have used a bit more smoke flavor but were very good. Sauerkraut and beans were delicious. Prices of food and drink very reasonable. Staff also friendly and helpful - besides ordering a half rack of ribs we said 'and some brisket for two and a bit of pork belly' he gave us the perfect amount of food. Had we guessed weights (the meat is sold by weight) we definitely would have over ordered. Thanks!,4.0
"Okay, so update- I went and I tried and it's okay. I love the aesthetic of the place and I love the idea, but it's not my favorite barbecue. As a matter of fact, I'd go to Dinosaur over Fette Sau any time now that I've had both and can say 100% that I love Dinosaur more. Now, I'm not trashing Fette Sau at all because it still smells f'ing amazing, but here are my thoughts:1. My friend and I ordered a lot of food. It's really difficult to determine just how much is too much or too little. I mean, unless you're a part-time butcher, how does someone hungry for bbq know that 2 pounds of meat may just be too much? So I suggest to always skimp on the amounts, especially since everything is sold by the lb.  2. Of all the meat we got: Lamb shank, pulled pork, brisket, pork belly, and one link of sausage my favorite was the pork belly and the sausage. The brisket was eh, the pulled pork, I've had better and the lamb shank just didn't do a damn thing for me. 3. The sides: we got broccoli salad, baked beans, potato salad and pickles. The pickles were less vinegary cucumbers, which if it's your thing, then you're solid. The broccoli salad, eh. The black beans are good, but don't expect sweet, brown sugar beans. Lastly the potato salad, was alright. I wouldn't call home about it. So yeah, that's it. I so wanted to love this place. I loved it from smelling it, but as the saying goes, you can't judge a book by it's cover. You can judge bbq without eating it.",3.0
"Wow, this place is fantastic! While visiting NYC we came here on a Friday night for dinner and it was totally worth the hour wait. We met some really nice people in line, got a gallon of delicious beer to share amongst the 7 of us and waited in line to order food. We found a table big enough to seat our group and the food came up really fast. You pay the pound and we got A LOT of food. We ordered the beef cheeks (AMAZING), brisket, ribs, pulled pork, baked beans, pickels, potato salad and sausages. Everything was so tasty and the baked beans were by far the best side. I wish we had something like this in Chicago! I definitely didn't feel like I was in Brooklyn. I also loved the decor and the style of the place. Just another good reason to go back to NY!",5.0
"Best BBQ in New York (maybe in all of North East).  This is not a chain BBQ where you just get baby back ribs drenched in sweet sauce.  This is the real deal!  The place is hidden in what used to be an old car garage (shop).  You walk in and the 1st thing that you notice is 1st come 1st serve picnic tables.  Don't let this disappoint you.  It's just part of the experience.  Next you will notice that there is a line on the right side of the restaurant leading to what looks like an old butcher/meat case.  At the case is where your server takes an empty tray and puts it on a scale.  You are now allowed to order the daily meats that they are serving by the pound.  They don't have a set menu and the meats of the day are listed on a chalk board.  All of the pork/beef/lamb/duck, etc. is acquired from local farms and usually the farms are listed along with the cuts of meat.  I can not recommend the brisket enough.  However, that being said, everything is superb.  There is no sauce needed for any of their BBQ.  It is all well rubbed and smoked to juicy perfection.  Don't forget to check out their side dishes and small batch bourbons and micro brews (this is from a separate line inside the restaurant).  I especially enjoyed their baked beans which contain an ample amount of pulled pork.  There is no other BBQ in NYC comparable to this experience!",5.0

"the place is kinda cool. The Brisket and the ribs were very soft and tender, the pulled pork and the tips were ok.. They were good, but you can get similar in other places as well. their sauces were good. they had about three different types of sauces. We also tried their pickles, which I found to be a little on the cucumber side rather than the pickle taste side. The beans, eh. I've had better. over all in all the food was good!!the only problem I had was the waiting. it is a communial seating arrangement. first come, first serve. there was plenty of seating, if you were willing to sit in the cold. Here's an idea forthe restaurant. if you enclosed the outside seating as you did the outer entrance you would be able to use those picnic tables outside during the winter and then in the summer you could remove the ""Skin"" and it would still be cool enough to sit outside. just a thought.Over all it was a pleasant experience. We will be back!",4.0
"Delicious barbeque, great beer selection.I had pork jowls here last night, and they were amazing. Definitely high-quality stuff, and I like how they rotate through some of the more off-the-run cuts of meat. You can buy beer by the gallon.The downside, as has been alluded to in many other reviews, is the extremely long lines and the awkward seating situation. You'd think they'd want more turnover, so there'd be an impetus to move less slowly at the front counter.",4.0
"2.5 stars to start yes this place does have an awoesome vibe.  The smell of smoked meats with picnic bench seating and auto body shop decor is definately cool.  The patrons and their flannel shirts and scraggly beards only add to the ambience.  I guess it's better to be eating in a room of hipsters then juice heads.  Prices are fair, probably looking at spending $25 per person. But the ordering system is just a pain and if you are not a fan of communal seating this is not the place for you. Here is how I break down the food.Sauce- the tomato based one was good, the vinegar based one was good for pouring on the floor.Pork Belly- Star of the show, be aware though this must be your thing because it's all fat afterall its belly which is basically uncured thick cut bacon.  Smokey, gelatanous and melts in your mouth.Beef brisket- Average, I love fat but way too fatty.  Very good smoke flavor but I thought a little dry and the seasonings were lacking cause it did need the bbq sauce.Pork shoulder-Average, was a little dry and lacked flavor. But put it on a potato roll and slather on some bbq sauce and that hightens it to good.Baked beans-They were bitter and tasted like they were sittin around all night.  Where is the sweet and smokey beans im used too?Cole Slaw- Was Bad it had green peppers which i despise and apples which added crunch but the overall taste was bland and flavorless.  Potato salad- they tried to switch up the game here too with this mustard and vinegar tossed salad it was o.k  best of the sides I had besides the potato rolls. Overall not bad but over-hyped, if your in the area try it out but if your making a trek probably better off making one to Dinosaur. stay away from the sides they are an after thought at best.",2.0
"After Matt Lang won ""Best In Smoke"" on the Food Network I figured I had to try this place.  I headed in there with the in-laws and wife.  When it was clear that we had not ever eaten there before, the guy at the meat counter asked us if there was anything we didn't like and how many people we were feeding.  He piled the meat-- pork ribs, pork belly, brisket, beef ribs, pulled pork, and sweet sausage -- and sides (potato salad, slaw, beans) on the tray and off we went.  The pulled pork was excellent  three different ways: undressed, with the vinegar based sauce, and with the house sauce.  Moist, well seasoned,  and not too salty.  The beef ribs were excellent, again moist, well seasoned, and not too salty.  The sausage was quite good by itself, but excellent when enhanced with the house sauce.  The pork belly was tender and flavorful.  The brisket was nicely seasoned and tasty, but somewhat dry.  But on this particular day, the brass ring was the pork ribs:  moist, well seasoned, not too salty, falling off the bone (are you sensing a trend?), and especially tasty when enhanced with the house sauce.  I have learned from another yelp reviewer that generally the sides may not be the highlight of a bbq place, but in this case, the three that we had were solid deliveries.For a slightly different opinion, my wife thought the beef ribs were the best followed by the pulled pork and the sausage.The house sauce did a great job of enhancing everything on the table.  The vinegar sauce was excellent on the pulled pork.  The mustard was good on the sausage (but the house sauce better).  The mustard was quite similar to chinese hot mustard.Overall, some of the best BBQ I have had and definitely worth the trip.  I'll return.",5.0
"Brilliant business model. The demand for their barbeque is so great that people routinely wait about an hour to get it. Now, they sell their meat from basically one deli counter, but they have enough space to easily add one or two more without compromising seating. You know, to move the line through faster. But because of the way the property is configured, even when the wait is as long as an hour, you're still on the premises. Which means, of course, you can drink while you wait.Enter the beer and whiskey bar. Have a friend save you spot in line while you go fetch a growler of delicious draft beer. An hour later, you're feeling good after a few glasses of beer and suddenly nothing sounds better than a a pound or so of delicious barbequed meats. It's impossible not to over-order.One of my favorite restaurants in all of NYC. It's always a great time.",5.0
"Everyone and I mean everyone has been talking up this BBQ joint. My very enthusiastic friend even went as far as to say that they have the best BBQ in the entire city, along with many of the reviewers here. So logically, some friends and I trekked out to BillyBurg for a huge meal and whiskey!Upon walking in I was smitten with the ambiance and overall aesthetic of the restaurant. Unassuming and overtly Williamsburg, my friends and I nestled into some seats and sent some scouts to gather grub for the table. I am not really a picnic-style seating kinda guy, its hard to have constructive conversation when the person at the end is trying to talk and everyone else can't really engage. So that was a bit annoying.So the food. Everything is served lunch room style. Meaning the meat is all showcased and you make your selection visually. The meat is then cut to your specifications and served on a big ass tray. Ordering meat by the pound is a bit daunting and makes for an interesting gastrointestinal journey. I happily ordered the brisket, pulled pork shoulder and a spicy sausage. The pulled pork was a let down because it was cold, the brisket was obviously bbq'd perfectly, but I requested a lean cut and got a large amount of fat on it. The spicy sausage wasn't really anything to write home about. Upon returning to the table I found a huge jug of beer. Life couldn't be more perfect. The beer was decent, the brisket was really really greasy and the sausage was mediocre. Overall, I was a bit disappointed. I expected a lot more from this place and instead what I got was an interesting venue in a garage that served room-temperature bbq. The beans were delicious and the buns were scrumptious. But if this is what everyone is claiming to be the best bbq in the city, then I'm much more inclined to head to Arthur's Tavern in Hoboken for some ribs. In ending, this place isn't terrible.

I'm very persnickety about brisket (part of my childhood in west Texas just made me that way =P) but this was good compared to the limited choices in NYC.  Side of pickles helped to cut through the fatty goodness and the BBQ sauces were decent.

Granted they don't have real knives and you're stuck cutting your pork with a butterknife, you gotta work hard for your pork!Wed night they slaughter and smoke a whole pig, so Thursday you can stuff your face with the lovely pig. Hmmm pig...You will come out smelling like smoked pork, which is a good thing at first, but not later in the night when the dogs come up and sniff you.Its communal seating, so you will have strangers sitting next to you, but most of the time they're friendly. Well most of the time. This place is located in hipster williamsberg, and well I HATE hipsters. With their super tight jeans, huge black nerd glasses, stupid hats, and scarfs, and sunglasses they wear indoors! Go away hipsters so I can eat in peace!They have a whiskey bar there too!

"Really chill spot that serves about the best BBQ you can get north of the Carolinas.Be prepared to wait in line, but also be prepared for the awesome brisket, pulled pork and pork belly that awaits once you get inside.  The meats are the obvious stars, and the selection varies from what I can tell, depending on how fast people make a run on any given pig part that day, or maybe just that they can only make a fixed amount each day.  I hope the ribs, beef cheeks and pork shoulder are on the menu next time I make it out.Decent sides and a few good beers to choose from.Besides the actual bbq, though, I think the best part of this spot is the ambience of the building and the way things are layed out.  You stand in line next outdoor tables, and once inside, you sort of snake around the edges of an old, cavernous, converted warehouse/garage-looking space to get your food and drink, and then find some space at the community picnic tables, which are all in the middle.  Very cool use of the space and a really laid back atmosphere with a brilliant blown up butcher's diagram of a pig on one wall, showing where each part comes from!Summertime in Williamsburg never had it so good.",4.0
Wow tried the top rated bbq joint in brooklyn and can do better in my own kitchen. Tried the brisket and greasy duck...was not impressed.1st off the line was out the door and down the walk...so i was thinking yeh baby this has gotta be the best. Serving style was different wax paper and surgical trays o.k. cool and funky. Picnic tables that you have to fight to get a seat no wonder when we pulled up some guy was eating in his car...So as far as the food was concerned the best thing on both our plates came in a bag(the chips). Don't believe the hype.,2.0
"Who knew you could get good bbq up north? I didn't think it was possible. I sure stand corrected. The brisket is flavorful and moist. Even the fatty bits that I usually can't eat were delicious and melty. The little burned bits were exceptionally tasty. The rub is not too salty either (I appreciate that).The ribs were juicy and tender. Not falling off the bone but good and sturdy. For sides we had their house made pickle, which I have to say I'm not a huge fan of, unfortunately. The salt to vinegar/sugar ratio was a bit off leaving it a little briney. However the beans were full of delicious meat bits and not lacking anything in the flavor department.Beer by the gallon? Why yes please.

"GODDAMN. PORK BELLY. (UNLIMITED) POTATO ROLLS.Everything else was forgettable: the ribs, pulled pork, beans, coleslaw. Ribs and pulled pork were dry, rather flavorless (that's where the BBQ sauce comes in). The beans were okay, which had a nice, smoky undertone, but I'm just used to the Southern beans, which are sweeter. They had their own unique spin on coleslaw, just didn't float my boat.I'll have to sit at the bar area next time and try their specialty brews. Nice, typically hipster, in-a-garage-so-it-looks-cool-without-trying-but-we-actually-did-try decor. Get there early. We got there just before noon on Saturday, beating the long line.

I'm very persnickety about brisket (part of my childhood in west Texas just made me that way =P) but this was good compared to the limited choices in NYC.  Side of pickles helped to cut through the fatty goodness and the BBQ sauces were decent.

"Fette Sau is some fatty pig goodness! Love the brisket and pork belly, the fattiest ones of course. My favorite sides are the collard greens and brussel sprouts, both have tons of meat in them too! The bar has the coolest taps I've ever seen and one of the most extensive bourbon collections in the NYC area. They have their own beer made for them by Sixpoints brewery, really tasty.

"I would give 3.5 stars. Fette Sau is a greasy joint with unique atmosphere. For the taste of BBQ, I wouldn't say the best I had but  having a dry rub BBQ place in middle of Williamsburg with interesting list of beer selection is hard to beat.When you walk in, you are a bit intimidated. First of all, it is packed. second of all, it feels rugged and you are lost wondering what you are supposed to do. Third of all, it definitely feels like guys thing. However, once you sit down with your BBQ (we had sausage, ribs and hand pulled brisket and some sides), we feel better. Looking around, you see washed brick walls with meat parts drawing, huge German pub style wooden tables and unexpected flat screen playing burning fireplace. I am sure this would play sports games some other times. Now the beer choices. The bar tab handles made out of kitchen tools were interesting to look at. The drinks are local but the display of the bottles at the bar shelves are unique and worth observing. Foodwise, I found all a bit bland for my taste. Even the sauces were bland too. Even after taking so much liberty of the sauces on my meats, it screamed ""more"".  Overall impression - It tasted like bread dipped in EVOO & salt and pepper. Which is good but bland. The ribs were cold eating there. I took some orders out and after microwave at home, it tasted 10 times better but the dry spices from the meat smeared in my hands didn't go away after 5 washes. Holly Molly~~ The hand pulled brisket on the bun with the sauce did work though. I enjoyed the simple right there sandwich I made myself. Sausage was a bit spicy but still bland.

"Fette Sau is some fatty pig goodness! Love the brisket and pork belly, the fattiest ones of course. My favorite sides are the collard greens and brussel sprouts, both have tons of meat in them too!

"I would give 3.5 stars. Fette Sau is a greasy joint with unique atmosphere. For the taste of BBQ, I wouldn't say the best I had but  having a dry rub BBQ place in middle of Williamsburg with interesting list of beer selection is hard to beat.When you walk in, you are a bit intimidated. First of all, it is packed. second of all, it feels rugged and you are lost wondering what you are supposed to do. Third of all, it definitely feels like guys thing. However, once you sit down with your BBQ (we had sausage, ribs and hand pulled brisket and some sides), we feel better. Looking around, you see washed brick walls with meat parts drawing, huge German pub style wooden tables and unexpected flat screen playing burning fireplace. I am sure this would play sports games some other times. Now the beer choices. The bar tab handles made out of kitchen tools were interesting to look at. The drinks are local but the display of the bottles at the bar shelves are unique and worth observing. Foodwise, I found all a bit bland for my taste. Even the sauces were bland too. Even after taking so much liberty of the sauces on my meats, it screamed ""more"".  Overall impression - It tasted like bread dipped in EVOO & salt and pepper. Which is good but bland. The ribs were cold eating there. I took some orders out and after microwave at home, it tasted 10 times better but the dry spices from the meat smeared in my hands didn't go away after 5 washes. Holly Molly~~ The hand pulled brisket on the bun with the sauce did work though. I enjoyed the simple right there sandwich I made myself. Sausage was a bit spicy but still bland. The staffs are friendly but a bit aloof for some reason. Near the closing time, all of staffs had bourbon(?) shots.. Hooray~~~ wish my job does that.

Go ahead and order a 1/4, 1/2, 3/4 or even a full pound from the charming gentleman behind the meat case.When getting meat: Don't be afraid to ask for more when they're weighing it out! 1/4 lb of brisket is two healthy slices, but I could have absolutely had two more.Get extra rolls! They are free, I didn't know this until I sat down and wondered why I didn't have the amount of rolls on my tray as my friend did.BBQ Sauce: Use it, use lots of it! Dip your rolls in it, cover your ribs in it- its absolutely delicious.Beer: Get a gallon to share, It worked out to be 2.5 beers each for the four of us.Make friends: You are forced to sit communal style, we made friends with people who ordered pounds and pounds of meat they couldn't finish and had gallons of beer with drinks undrank- when they were leaving we were offered anything we wanted! Which was more beer!I can't comment on the sides because I didn't get any, I'd love to try the beans and the pickles next time though.This has to be hands down, the best BBQ I've had however and who would have thought this was a hidden gem in Brooklyn?! Everyone here is really nice, when the bartender got me a sample of the double white she didn't walk away and forget about me before getting our opinion and order. The price was great - 1/4 lb of brisket and a 1/4 lb of ribs was under $9. The ribs and brisket are absolutely delicious, I didn't get a chance to try the pulled pork but my friends were raving over it.Next time though, I'll be more prepared for this experience.",5.0

"We ate here in February last year and it was so crowded we couldnt eat inside, but the food was so amazing we didnt care. This place is great for sharing and sampling. My friends and I were able to split a few different dishes and come out pretty evenly on price. The chopped bbq is awesome as is the brisket. Cant wait to try some ribs and more this summer!",5.0
"This has got to be one of the most fun places to eat with friends and family.  The meats, sides and alcohol selection is superb!  Plus, where else can you say you showed up at an old car garage for fine BBQ?  The night we were there most meats were $16 per pound and our tray of food fed our party of 6 and then some!  We all had a fantastic time!  Great place to check out when in Brooklyn!",5.0

"I didn't really understand how this place worked until AFTER I ordered my food by just mimicking what my friends ordered. So let's not let you make the same mistake as me:The list of meats and prices on the wall: that's per pound. Go ahead and order a 1/4, 1/2, 3/4 or even a full pound from the charming gentleman behind the meat case.When getting meat: Don't be afraid to ask for more when they're weighing it out! 1/4 lb of brisket is two healthy slices, but I could have absolutely had two more.Get extra rolls! They are free, I didn't know this until I sat down and wondered why I didn't have the amount of rolls on my tray as my friend did.BBQ Sauce: Use it, use lots of it! Dip your rolls in it, cover your ribs in it- its absolutely delicious.Beer: Get a gallon to share, It worked out to be 2.5 beers each for the four of us.Make friends: You are forced to sit communal style, we made friends with people who ordered pounds and pounds of meat they couldn't finish and had gallons of beer with drinks undrank- when they were leaving we were offered anything we wanted! Which was more beer!I can't comment on the sides because I didn't get any, I'd love to try the beans and the pickles next time though.This has to be hands down, the best BBQ I've had however and who would have thought this was a hidden gem in Brooklyn?! Everyone here is really nice, when the bartender got me a sample of the double white she didn't walk away and forget about me before getting our opinion and order. The price was great - 1/4 lb of brisket and a 1/4 lb of ribs was under $9. The ribs and brisket are absolutely delicious, I didn't get a chance to try the pulled pork but my friends were raving over it.Next time though, I'll be more prepared for this experience.",5.0

"Very good BBQ in a great atmosphere, including outdoor dining. They've obviously got a good thing going here. Don't expect southern BBQ food -- this is all about meat. There's no collard greens, mac & cheese, or other classic sides. In fact, the closest that Fette comes to southern BBQ is its pulled pork shoulder.Ordering meat by the pound on large, industrial, metal trays is truly satisfying and it enables patrons to sample lots of different meats. Highlights included the famous pork belly, which put me into an immediate food coma -- it's just a slab of fat with enough flavor to knock you on your back. A spicy pork sausage was also a great surprise. Another meat highlight was the beef brisket, which although slightly dry had excellent flavor and contained especially delicious fat content. The beer selection here is another reason to come around. With around 10 mostly local options on tap -- the taps themselves are actually giant chopping/butcher knives -- and a variety of reasonably priced serving sizes from half pints ($3) right up to gallon jugs ($32), Fette Sau can pretty much hold up simply as a bar. The baked beans were an unfortunate letdown, considering all the buzz they've gotten on here. I also could have gone for another option or two when it came to the BBQ sauce... all we saw were a standard BBQ and a spicy version. Although my stomach wanted to drop a 5-star review here I knew in my brain that a few tweaks could have really made this a perfect BBQ experience.Overall impression: barbecue food is so ""in"" right now that there are many great options out there, yet Fette Sau is still the go-to for a lot of people because they do meat RIGHT and serve it with great beer, so despite any minor inadequacies I'll be back here quite a bit.",4.0

"When I can stuff myself like a fat pig on delicious cuts of pork for $20 even, I don't give a damn if this is authentic bbq or some strange German hybrid. Pass me that pure-fat pork belly, some smoked pork sausage, pulled pork, and juicy brisket, and I'll happily deal with cramped picnic tables and breeding hipsters and their spawn. We got all that plus two cups of delicious baked beans with burnt ends, a pile of potato rolls, tasty german potato salad, half sour pickles, and one lone spear of overly red peppery broccoli, and we were all stuffed to the point of explosion. Did I mention it only cost $20 a person? What a steal. I would say that ordering everything by the pound is tricky, because it is easy to over or underestimate how much you need. In our case, we ordered too much, and overate as a result. I'd rather their be a standard ""order size"" that you could work with, because I think that could help alleviate the problem. As it was, I was super excited to see Steve's Key Lime Pie on the menu, but by the time I was ready for dessert it was no longer a possibility, thanks to my swollen stomach. In any event, we loved our family style pork feast, although we did feel compelled to walk all the way over the williamsburg bridge and up to union square in order to compensate for all the fatty goodness we had consumed.

We shared half a pound of brisket, a quarter pound of pork belly, a side of burnt end baked beans and a side of dante's german potato salad. Everything was absurdly amazing.

"When I can stuff myself like a fat pig on delicious cuts of pork for $20 even, I don't give a damn if this is authentic bbq or some strange German hybrid.

We got all that plus two cups of delicious baked beans with burnt ends, a pile of potato rolls, tasty german potato salad, half sour pickles, and one lone spear of overly red peppery broccoli, and we were all stuffed to the point of explosion. Did I mention it only cost $20 a person? What a steal. I would say that ordering everything by the pound is tricky, because it is easy to over or underestimate how much you need. In our case, we ordered too much, and overate as a result. I'd rather their be a standard ""order size"" that you could work with, because I think that could help alleviate the problem. As it was, I was super excited to see Steve's Key Lime Pie on the menu, but by the time I was ready for dessert it was no longer a possibility, thanks to my swollen stomach. In any event, we loved our family style pork feast, although we did feel compelled to walk all the way over the williamsburg bridge and up to union square in order to compensate for all the fatty goodness we had consumed.

"Let me preface my review by saying if this place were in Texas it wouldn't last a week. I would give maybe three stars.Now that thats out there, Fette Sau is fun, relaxing and delicious. I went on a Thursday night around 9 and it was packed. Not to worry, it took only a few minutes to grab a seat at the bar and begin sampling their handful of really well picked delicious beers on draft. They have a great whiskey collection too... we tried a Hudson that was stellar-- and apparently from New York's first distillery since prohibition. So, informative bartenders give this place an extra half star. We looked over the menu, which was limited as BBQ places usually are, and ordered brisket, pork shoulder, and ribs. The ribs were outstanding. The brisket was a bit dry. The thing that stuck out to me most about this place (as compared to the Texas joints) are their weird BBQ sauces. Let me tell you, a good BBQ sauce can make you forget that your brisket is dry. My dining amigo loved one (but he was from Seattle... what does he know?) but I found it WAY to vinegary. When mixed with the thicker, spicier one it was closer to the real thang, but still not enough to make me forgive and forget.Its always crowded, so don't go if you're looking for an intimate place to have a quiet conversation. You are probably going to have to share a giant picnic table with 15+ people. But hey, thats fun. I will go back to Fette Sau for two reasons. The previously mentioned bar and the delicious broccoli. Thats right, the broccoli. I've never had broccoli melt in my mouth like this. I've also never had broccoli at a BBQ place but thats neither here nor there. It was really garlic-y and had some sort of chili flakes going on. Its THE must-order item.",4.0

Some say the meat is too fatty. Well, it's barbecue folks. Expect a bit of fat.The brisket here is legit I mean, the slab jiggles when he's cutting it. The pulled pork is delicious and makes a great sandwich with their delicious rolls. The sweet sauce is my sauce of choice and makes a great compliment to it all. I dare anyone to find more savory brisket anywhere.I usually tack on some sausage as well, which is very well flavored. I've heard some complaints about the ribs being dry but I'm not a rib guy for the most part.The beers are great. The sides menu could use a bit more action but I come for the meat. I give it 5 stars for the brisket alone. It's a revelation.",5.0

The bbq sauces were delicious as well - I preferred the sweet red sauce, but the chipotle sauce was very good as well. I also enjoyed the half sour pickles and the asian cole slaw. My only minor complaint was that they should make there own sweet tea and offer homemade lemonade. Loved the ""fireplace"",  long communal tables and the low key ambience.

The crust on the beef was mega yum too, nice and thick and crackly. They also have a nice selection of north american liquors and beer.

"Let me preface my review by saying if this place were in Texas it wouldn't last a week. I would give maybe three stars.Now that thats out there, Fette Sau is fun, relaxing and delicious. I went on a Thursday night around 9 and it was packed. Not to worry, it took only a few minutes to grab a seat at the bar and begin sampling their handful of really well picked delicious beers on draft. They have a great whiskey collection too... we tried a Hudson that was stellar-- and apparently from New York's first distillery since prohibition. So, informative bartenders give this place an extra half star. We looked over the menu, which was limited as BBQ places usually are, and ordered brisket, pork shoulder, and ribs. The ribs were outstanding. The brisket was a bit dry. The thing that stuck out to me most about this place (as compared to the Texas joints) are their weird BBQ sauces. Let me tell you, a good BBQ sauce can make you forget that your brisket is dry. My dining amigo loved one (but he was from Seattle... what does he know?) but I found it WAY to vinegary. When mixed with the thicker, spicier one it was closer to the real thang, but still not enough to make me forgive and forget.Its always crowded, so don't go if you're looking for an intimate place to have a quiet conversation. You are probably going to have to share a giant picnic table with 15+ people. But hey, thats fun. I will go back to Fette Sau for two reasons. The previously mentioned bar and the delicious broccoli. Thats right, the broccoli. I've never had broccoli melt in my mouth like this. I've also never had broccoli at a BBQ place but thats neither here nor there. It was really garlic-y and had some sort of chili flakes going on. Its THE must-order item.",4.0
"Brisket! Sausages! Baked beans! OH MY.Seriously, though.. sometimes I miss NYC because of the people. Sometimes I miss the sights. Sometimes I miss the foooood. Especially the delicious sausages and brisket of Fette Sau. This place lives up to the hype. Anyone who disagrees is a total snob. Too good to eat baked beans from a cardboard cup while sitting at a picnic table? You're no friend of mine.",5.0
"So, I'm from Texas. And that isn't to say ""Y'all, I'm from Texas, so listen here what I got to say 'bout this here Fat Soo."" Point is, I've had good barbecue, and this is some of the best I've ever had.I've read some of the various complaints (you'll always find some regardless of the quality of an establishment), but many of them seem unfounded. Some say the meat is too fatty. Well, it's barbecue folks. Expect a bit of fat.The brisket here is legit I mean, the slab jiggles when he's cutting it. The pulled pork is delicious and makes a great sandwich with their delicious rolls. The sweet sauce is my sauce of choice and makes a great compliment to it all. I dare anyone to find more savory brisket anywhere.I usually tack on some sausage as well, which is very well flavored. I've heard some complaints about the ribs being dry but I'm not a rib guy for the most part.The beers are great. The sides menu could use a bit more action but I come for the meat. I give it 5 stars for the brisket alone. It's a revelation.",5.0

"Probably the best bbq that I have ever had in NYC(Sorry Dinosaur, Hill Country, Daisy Mae's). I tried the ribs, brisket and pork belly and it was all great. The spice and smoke on the ribs were perfect - falling off the bone, tongue tingling spicey combined with a beautiful red smoke ring. The bbq sauces were delicious as well - I preferred the sweet red sauce, but the chipotle sauce was very good as well. I also enjoyed the half sour pickles and the asian cole slaw. My only minor complaint was that they should make there own sweet tea and offer homemade lemonade. Loved the ""fireplace"",  long communal tables and the low key ambience. Can't wait to go back to try the boneless beef ribs and pork shoulder. So good. Prices are not shy, but reasonable.",4.0
"Amazing little place. The ambiance of this place is just perfect for a hipster run bbq place. Dark, looks to be reclaimed wood all over, cool stools at the bar, communal seating inside and out, an awesome mural of butcher cuts of pork and beef.....really FUN. Food definitely met our expectations. The pork shoulder was so good and so was the beef brisket. Both could be eaten without their delicious sauces. The crust on the beef was mega yum too, nice and thick and crackly. They also have a nice selection of north american liquors and beer. We got beer with the meal and then sat and had some more after, as well as free shots from our super nice bartender. Wish we lived closer! Gotta go!",5.0

The smoke flavor and taste just satisfies. The brisket was so tender and wrapped in a charred finish. This is like a gift for your meat craving. Wow! The way that I ordered was 1 lb. of ribs, 1/2 lb. of brisket and 1/4 lb. of pork belly. I enjoyed the brisket and the pork belly the most. The side that we ordered was the beans. They didn't disappoint. The Mac and Cheese did not look like much so we went with a pickle. The pickle actually balanced out the flavor of the meat. The beer that was great was the one that started with an A. It also had a good color to it. I can't remember the name of it. The liquid gold was too light for me. This meal fed the both of us and my husband doesn't usually like to share. I'm always trying to get him to indulge responsibly, but he was okay with his portion. This and the rolls that they offer sent us home with bellies busting. Next time I will do more of the brisket and less of the ribs.

"When I eat barbecue, I look for a few things: does the meat fall off the bone; can you eat it without a sauce; how was it cooked?  My first test was a shoulder sandwich.  I tasted the shoulder sans sauce; it was ok-slightly dry.  Sliced a roll in half, lathered on the tomato based BBQ sauce, layered on shoulder and coleslaw (from the sides menu) and WHAM! that sandwich was out- of -this -world!  Of course, I knew the sauce made the sandwich the king that it was- tangy, spicy, just enough tomato to not overpower the sauce.  I tried to slip out with the bottle.  Next I tried the St. Louis rib-again the rib was slow cooked in an oven.  At first bite, the meat fell off of the bone almost immediately in one hunk.  However, this is where disappointment set in, the meat was chewy-it did not melt in my mouth immediately, it was almost a little too tough.Note about cooking ribs (or any kind of BBQ for that matter): these types of meats are meant to be cooked over an indirect flame for many hours the average cooking time lasting about 24 hours.  When you have a properly smoked rib, your meat will have a nice gray tint to it when you bite in.  Fette Sau's meat did not.  It was pinker in the center, which means it's been cooked too fast.  However, again, slather on that tomato based sauce (yes, skip that North Carolina vinegar based sauce) and dig in!The brisket-I had a small bite of the brisket-it was my least favorite, slightly dry and tough to chew.The sides: skip the oil/vinegar/garlic broccoli salad (unless you are warding off vampires) and also skip the baked beans (the beans were not typical southern barbecue baked beans), and order the oil and vinegar based coleslaw (although I wish it was chopped finer rather than being served in big hunks) as your side-it will be the perfect accompaniment for your new favorite BBQ sandwich.One thing I did notice is that no one tried the sauce.  The patrons sitting next to me were dotting sauce on their tray and dipping teeny pieces of meat into the tiniest dot of sauce.  It's barbecue people, get messy and SLATHER it on!To complete your Fette Sau experience, order Mason jars (or jugs) of some of the craft beer on tap.  You just may want to start square dancing after your Fette Sau experience.  Yee-haw!",4.0

"The pork belly.  Eat the pork belly.  You will die and go to heaven.  The sausage was meh for me, even though still good (on a separate note i think it tasted italian?).  I've had better brisket but theirs is still very well made.  The pork shoulder, too, was unbearably delicious and fatty although at the same time, nothing overly remarkable.But THE PORK BELLY.  The pork belly is where it's at.  You bite into it, and the molten fat drips down.  The meat is tender, from being surrounded by fat, and as you swallow you imbibe fat.  Your eyes roll back into your head, a sexual moan escapes your lips.  Fueled by the burning flames of pork fat passion you feast away.  At some point you feel a little sick, from all of that grease gurgling away inside.  But then you keep eating.  And then there comes a time when you are full, but there is still some on your plate.  You want to eat it, but you want to save it for tomorrow, too.  You nibble a little bit more, packing yourself as full as possible, then pack it away for breakfast.And then in the morning you curse yourself for not having had the willpower to save more of it because what you were eventually able to save from yourself is not nearly enough to satisfy.I can't wait to go back and get a full pound of that sweet, sweet crack.  And also try the cheeks and pastrami and, well, everything else.",5.0
"The food at Fette Sau is excellent. Everything you've read is true, since it's on the Internet. I love the brisket. The pulled pork is nice and lean and baked beans kind of maybe blew my mind.

Depending on the time of day, the line may be 10 minutes, or may be closer to 45. Patience should start to be employed here. The remainder of your group should seek out a table and upon finding one, squat it. In order to justify squatting seats at a table, I suggest employing another runner for a jug of beer. After your beer and table have been acquired, chill out for a bit, have a little patience for your food to arrive, and then just have a Good Time.",4.0
"It's definitely an experience. Meat-lovers can happily convene here, but it ain't the best I've ever had. Meat tastes a bit overcooked, that charcoal-y flavor is not welcome on my palate. The baked beans were glucky and overly sweet tasting. My pork sausage was also REALLY sweet. I have to give them probs for the barbecue sauce- it was spicy and tangy without overtaking the meat. Rolls were good. Liked the room- long picnic tables, french music playing, and the ""WC"" on the restrooms actually reminded me of Paris, not Germany. The fakey TV fire is kind of cool and simultaneously tacky. Service was kind of unfriendly- a sweaty 20something in a backwards baseball cap looked really impatient the entire time we were deciding what to order. Which was all of 2 minutes.

I have had so many negative experiences that I swore to write about, and spare fellow yelpers the time and money. However, I finally signed up and here it goes: this was all that they say it is. The smoke flavor and taste just satisfies. The brisket was so tender and wrapped in a charred finish. This is like a gift for your meat craving. Wow! The way that I ordered was 1 lb. of ribs, 1/2 lb. of brisket and 1/4 lb. of pork belly. I enjoyed the brisket and the pork belly the most. The side that we ordered was the beans. They didn't disappoint. The Mac and Cheese did not look like much so we went with a pickle. The pickle actually balanced out the flavor of the meat. The beer that was great was the one that started with an A. It also had a good color to it. I can't remember the name of it. The liquid gold was too light for me. This meal fed the both of us and my husband doesn't usually like to share. I'm always trying to get him to indulge responsibly, but he was okay with his portion. This and the rolls that they offer sent us home with bellies busting. Next time I will do more of the brisket and less of the ribs. Don't get me wrong, the ribs were great, but the brisket and pork belly was so much better. Don't waste your money buying a lot of sides . Here, the meat is where the taste bud goodness is. By the way, I finally get to thank all of the yelpers that have given my taste buds such a euphoric experience. Shout out to you guys.",4.0

"Fette Sau, is a German style barbeque joint. Hot dogs, hamburgers, sausages and mustard- it's easy to forget that these ""all-American"" barbecue staples we crave this time of year originally came from Germany. The set up remindes me of the old BBQ joints in San Antoino TX this place is usually croweded and it can be hard to get a seat but if you do it will be the best BBQ you can get north of the Mason-Dixion line and that says a lot being im from VIrgina. The meat is of prime quality Berkshire Pork, Black Angus Beef I had the pork belly was amazing and the beef brisket was great and the ribs had a beautiful smoke ring on it from the hours of smoking in the BBQ pit. If you ever go you will return unless your Vegan.",5.0
"When I eat barbecue, I look for a few things: does the meat fall off the bone; can you eat it without a sauce; how was it cooked?  My first test was a shoulder sandwich.  I tasted the shoulder sans sauce; it was ok-slightly dry.  Sliced a roll in half, lathered on the tomato based BBQ sauce, layered on shoulder and coleslaw (from the sides menu) and WHAM! that sandwich was out- of -this -world!  Of course, I knew the sauce made the sandwich the king that it was- tangy, spicy, just enough tomato to not overpower the sauce.  I tried to slip out with the bottle.  Next I tried the St. Louis rib-again the rib was slow cooked in an oven.  At first bite, the meat fell off of the bone almost immediately in one hunk.  However, this is where disappointment set in, the meat was chewy-it did not melt in my mouth immediately, it was almost a little too tough.Note about cooking ribs (or any kind of BBQ for that matter): these types of meats are meant to be cooked over an indirect flame for many hours the average cooking time lasting about 24 hours.  When you have a properly smoked rib, your meat will have a nice gray tint to it when you bite in.  Fette Sau's meat did not.  It was pinker in the center, which means it's been cooked too fast.  However, again, slather on that tomato based sauce (yes, skip that North Carolina vinegar based sauce) and dig in!The brisket-I had a small bite of the brisket-it was my least favorite, slightly dry and tough to chew.The sides: skip the oil/vinegar/garlic broccoli salad (unless you are warding off vampires) and also skip the baked beans (the beans were not typical southern barbecue baked beans), and order the oil and vinegar based coleslaw (although I wish it was chopped finer rather than being served in big hunks) as your side-it will be the perfect accompaniment for your new favorite BBQ sandwich.One thing I did notice is that no one tried the sauce.  The patrons sitting next to me were dotting sauce on their tray and dipping teeny pieces of meat into the tiniest dot of sauce.  It's barbecue people, get messy and SLATHER it on!To complete your Fette Sau experience, order Mason jars (or jugs) of some of the craft beer on tap.  You just may want to start square dancing after your Fette Sau experience.  Yee-haw!",4.0
"The pulled pork shoulder with BBQ sauce is awesome. We sat at the bar because it wasn't too busy, best place to eat if u don't want to sit next to strangers inadvertently forcing your conversations on them.  Cueman was sexy although hard not to be when all I can see is his beaming smile at me across the scale of heaping meat.  The broccoli salad is awesome like a spicy Korean banchan (nothing you would expect there), but the pickles are a bright green briny disappointment.",4.0

"I dont claim to be a BBQ aficionado, I just know when a lot of care is put into the food I eat.  My friends on the other hand, are from Charleston, and they said it was the best BBQ they've had in the NY area yet...1)  We let the BBQ people order. One person waited for a table which involves camping in front of a table. One person got the beer, which by the way comes in 1/2 Liter and 1 Liter bottles if desired.2) Didnt like the sauce. One spicy, one ketchup based which tasted like only ketchup, and one who knows WTF that was, clearly not my taste. Perhaps we had a bad batch, but universally didnt like it.3) What we got. a) Berkshire Pork belly-that was ridiculously fatty...too rich for some people's liking...b) Berkshire cheeks-the rub was absolutely amazing, and the meat had this great sweetness...my BBQ friends said ""we usually dont care what part of the pig it comes from as long as it's meat""c)Pulled pork-so smoky with a great textured) Sausages-these were more on the sweeter sideSides-My friends from the south wish there were more authentic sides..1) PIckled asian slaw- actually quite good, though obviously their own creation2) Some Broccoli salad that was surprisingly good...We exited out, loosened the belt, and headed to the beer garden at the back of Spuyten Duyvil across the street!",4.0
"The pork belly.  Eat the pork belly.  You will die and go to heaven.  The sausage was meh for me, even though still good (on a separate note i think it tasted italian?).  I've had better brisket but theirs is still very well made.  The pork shoulder, too, was unbearably delicious and fatty although at the same time, nothing overly remarkable.But THE PORK BELLY.  The pork belly is where it's at.  You bite into it, and the molten fat drips down.  The meat is tender, from being surrounded by fat, and as you swallow you imbibe fat.  Your eyes roll back into your head, a sexual moan escapes your lips.  Fueled by the burning flames of pork fat passion you feast away.  At some point you feel a little sick, from all of that grease gurgling away inside.  But then you keep eating.  And then there comes a time when you are full, but there is still some on your plate.  You want to eat it, but you want to save it for tomorrow, too.  You nibble a little bit more, packing yourself as full as possible, then pack it away for breakfast.And then in the morning you curse yourself for not having had the willpower to save more of it because what you were eventually able to save from yourself is not nearly enough to satisfy.I can't wait to go back and get a full pound of that sweet, sweet crack.  And also try the cheeks and pastrami and, well, everything else.",5.0
"The food at Fette Sau is excellent. Everything you've read is true, since it's on the Internet. I love the brisket. The pulled pork is nice and lean and baked beans kind of maybe blew my mind. You cannot imagine how difficult it was to not eat my meal like a little piggy such as the younger brother in A Christmas Story. Unfortunately, there is a list of ingredients and recipe needed to enjoy yourself. Here you go.recipe for a Good Time™In one small or large group, combine (minimum):1 Runner1 Seeker/Squatter1 hour of patience (per person)1 pinch of chillin' 1 jug of beer (as desired)Upon entering the gates, immediately set at least one runner in line to get your food. Depending on the time of day, the line may be 10 minutes, or may be closer to 45. Patience should start to be employed here. The remainder of your group should seek out a table and upon finding one, squat it. In order to justify squatting seats at a table, I suggest employing another runner for a jug of beer. After your beer and table have been acquired, chill out for a bit, have a little patience for your food to arrive, and then just have a Good Time.",4.0
"It's definitely an experience. Meat-lovers can happily convene here, but it ain't the best I've ever had. Meat tastes a bit overcooked, that charcoal-y flavor is not welcome on my palate. The baked beans were glucky and overly sweet tasting. My pork sausage was also REALLY sweet. I have to give them probs for the barbecue sauce- it was spicy and tangy without overtaking the meat. Rolls were good. Liked the room- long picnic tables, french music playing, and the ""WC"" on the restrooms actually reminded me of Paris, not Germany. The fakey TV fire is kind of cool and simultaneously tacky. Service was kind of unfriendly- a sweaty 20something in a backwards baseball cap looked really impatient the entire time we were deciding what to order. Which was all of 2 minutes.

"I am pretty sure I went on an off night or something. I tried the pork belly, Holstein top sirloin, sausage, duck, brisket, and beans. Everything, except the beans, was cold.

The pork belly was also very tasty. The ribs were good, but a dry rub and not the best I have tasted. They also had sausages and pulled pork shoulder. As for sides, I got the German potato salad, sauerkraut and Gus's homemade pickles. It comes with dinner rolls and its self-serve, wetnaps, forks, knives....all served on your own tray...much like school cafeteria. They take credit cards, VISA and MC and have many fancy style Sodas to chose from. I missed out on Steve's Key Lime Tart....damn!!! Next time.

The oh-too-brief moments you're in my mouth are the few times in my everyday life I can experience true happiness.Enter Fette Sau - German for 'Fat Pig', this seemed like the perfect place to refuel between stops on the Brooklyn Brews Bar Crawl. The space is basically 3 long picnic tables in an open garage and decorated like a sparse warehouse cafeteria (think chalk boards, meat hooks, bare lightbulbs) complete with a bar serving up their own brewed beer. Because we arrived right when they opened, seating wasn't an issue, but at this first come, first seated joint, you might wanna do what we did if you're a large party by bogarting an entire table to yourselves before the crowds come. (I never entered the 2 bathrooms, so I can't comment on their wheelchair friendliness, but the tables are low enough to not be an issue.)If memory serves me correctly, for two people I ordered;-Two beers: whatever the 'home brand' was what we drank. And it was tasty enough, however the following foods stole the show.-Broccoli Salad: this was vinegar tangy and pretty tasty, but it was purposely cold! From a healthy colon perspective, Mama approves - but this woulda been 10X better warmed up.-BBQ baked beans: I want to be slathered in this, head to toe, for no reason other than my perverse enjoyment. Imagine the best baked beans you ever had in your life. Now add chopped up bits of smoked pork. Then multiply that by a million. Now do you understand why I want to bathe in these beans?-1/3 pound of Pork Ribs: Dry rubbed = heaven. A good rack of ribs never needs sauce, however I used these suckers like little mops to transport the 3 types of bottled sauces on the table into my mouf. Fall off the bone yummy, with lovely smoke rings as an indicator of a quality product. Mama approves.- 1/3 pound of Brisket - Moist, tender and flavorful, with a good char on the outside. I stuffed a couple of slices into the complimentary rolls, doused it all in sauce, and shoveled those sam'iches into my face with the quickness.-and of course...SAUSAGE. Two to be exact; one for him and one for me. But they were sooooooooooooooooo perfectly crispy, yet juicy, spicy, smoky, and tender - *** OH MY SWEET DISPLACED SOUTHERNER STARS *** - I had to get back on line and order 2 more, just for my gluttonous self.Meanwhile, the few Beer Crawl participants who weren't in a food coma at our table were staring at me in fear, as if to say ""Did this heffa just eat all that barbeque AND two more sausages?""Why yes I did, honey!

The beans, potato salad and pickles were a nice addition to the mountain of meat we had before us: pulled pork, ribs, belly and cheeks. I also really liked the deli ordering style where you can get as much or as little of something as you like. They sell everything by the pound. This allowed me to try everything without feeling like I was missing out by choosing an entree with pre-fixed sides. Great beer and bourbon selections with family style first come first served seating.",5.0
"What is everyone raving about?! The BBQ is good, don't get me wrong. But is it worth an hour wait in line to then have to literally hunt for a space to eat at the communal table that is so small you bump elbows while trying to cut your BBQ meats? I think not. Went on a Saturday at around 6-7PM and the line was out to the street. Did the whole half gallon/gallon of beer thing while waiting on line and that at least softened the blow of the wait. Once I got up to the meat counter you are in such a rush to order that you can't really chat with the guy serving the BBQ to get an idea of what or how to order. After that you have a nice tray of meats that gets cold as you A.) wait 20 min or longer for a space to open up at the communal Tables or B.) go eat outside in the cold during the winter. I can definitely taste that the BBQ is good, damn good, but the overall experience and what I call ""cut throat dining"" really outdid the food for me. I'll have to go again when it's not so insanely crowded, but until then I can't give more than 2 stars for the overall experience.",2.0

"The meat was slow cooked and full of flavor. It is served deli style (you tell them what/how much you want) and the meat was practically falling apart as the counterperson pulled up hunks of it. I tried the beef brisket and pork belly. The brisket was peppery and spicy with a nice crunch on the outside. The pork belly was super tender and flavorful, and practically melted in your mouth. You can get a table inside or a picnic-style bench outside. Amazing dinner experience, but not quite 5 stars. Don't fret, Fette Sau, 4 stars is really good too =)",4.0

"Let it be known that I am a sausage whore.No, seriously, it's my favorite type of meat, and I don't care from which animal; wild boar, venison, beef, chicken, turkey, duck, alligator (yup - it's how we roll in the Bayou), and the illustrious pork - I love you all. The oh-too-brief moments you're in my mouth are the few times in my everyday life I can experience true happiness.Enter Fette Sau - German for 'Fat Pig', this seemed like the perfect place to refuel between stops on the Brooklyn Brews Bar Crawl. The space is basically 3 long picnic tables in an open garage and decorated like a sparse warehouse cafeteria (think chalk boards, meat hooks, bare lightbulbs) complete with a bar serving up their own brewed beer. Because we arrived right when they opened, seating wasn't an issue, but at this first come, first seated joint, you might wanna do what we did if you're a large party by bogarting an entire table to yourselves before the crowds come. (I never entered the 2 bathrooms, so I can't comment on their wheelchair friendliness, but the tables are low enough to not be an issue.)If memory serves me correctly, for two people I ordered;-Two beers: whatever the 'home brand' was what we drank. And it was tasty enough, however the following foods stole the show.-Broccoli Salad: this was vinegar tangy and pretty tasty, but it was purposely cold! From a healthy colon perspective, Mama approves - but this woulda been 10X better warmed up.-BBQ baked beans: I want to be slathered in this, head to toe, for no reason other than my perverse enjoyment. Imagine the best baked beans you ever had in your life. Now add chopped up bits of smoked pork. Then multiply that by a million. Now do you understand why I want to bathe in these beans?-1/3 pound of Pork Ribs: Dry rubbed = heaven. A good rack of ribs never needs sauce, however I used these suckers like little mops to transport the 3 types of bottled sauces on the table into my mouf. Fall off the bone yummy, with lovely smoke rings as an indicator of a quality product. Mama approves.- 1/3 pound of Brisket - Moist, tender and flavorful, with a good char on the outside. I stuffed a couple of slices into the complimentary rolls, doused it all in sauce, and shoveled those sam'iches into my face with the quickness.-and of course...SAUSAGE. Two to be exact; one for him and one for me. But they were sooooooooooooooooo perfectly crispy, yet juicy, spicy, smoky, and tender - *** OH MY SWEET DISPLACED SOUTHERNER STARS *** - I had to get back on line and order 2 more, just for my gluttonous self.Meanwhile, the few Beer Crawl participants who weren't in a food coma at our table were staring at me in fear, as if to say ""Did this heffa just eat all that barbeque AND two more sausages?""Why yes I did, honey! And I enjoyed every porktastic bite. Fat Pig, indeed.:::whispers:::I love you, Fette Sau.",4.0
"Nice space with that hand-crafted industrial look, a bevy of bourbons, Tuthilltown rye, No. 209 gin, Vermont White vodka, beer by the gallon, and oh yeah, pig by the pound.

"This is the best BBQ I have ever had in my entire life. The pork cheek was to die for. I can't stop thinking about it. The beans, potato salad and pickles were a nice addition to the mountain of meat we had before us: pulled pork, ribs, belly and cheeks. I also really liked the deli ordering style where you can get as much or as little of something as you like. They sell everything by the pound. This allowed me to try everything without feeling like I was missing out by choosing an entree with pre-fixed sides. Great beer and bourbon selections with family style first come first served seating.",5.0
"What is everyone raving about?! The BBQ is good, don't get me wrong. But is it worth an hour wait in line to then have to literally hunt for a space to eat at the communal table that is so small you bump elbows while trying to cut your BBQ meats? I think not. Went on a Saturday at around 6-7PM and the line was out to the street. Did the whole half gallon/gallon of beer thing while waiting on line and that at least softened the blow of the wait. Once I got up to the meat counter you are in such a rush to order that you can't really chat with the guy serving the BBQ to get an idea of what or how to order. After that you have a nice tray of meats that gets cold as you A.) wait 20 min or longer for a space to open up at the communal Tables or B.) go eat outside in the cold during the winter. I can definitely taste that the BBQ is good, damn good, but the overall experience and what I call ""cut throat dining"" really outdid the food for me. I'll have to go again when it's not so insanely crowded, but until then I can't give more than 2 stars for the overall experience.",2.0

"Holy God!I'm glad I don't live around the corner from this place.Okay, I'm from Texas and it is the best BBQ I've ever had.When I was living in Texas last year, I visited my other fellow Texans living in Brooklyn and they took me here. I returned to Texas very pissed off because my friends were not only living in New York, they were eating the best BBQ in the country as well!I just moved to Brooklyn myself and was very eager to return here. They delivered once again. This place makes the idea of being a vegetarian impossible and affirms the notion that human beings are supposed to eat meat!

"Heads up before you read this review and realize I don't mention the food that extensively: I ate beforehand, so I didn't really eat here. I just had a leeeetle bit. I'd recommend another review for the full food rundown. The 4 stars is based more on the fact that from what little I experienced, I'd definitely come back to fully get down with meat by the pound(s).Fette Sau was where I met up with Brooklyn Beer Crawl Yelpers. It was their third stop of the day. I had some catching up to do in the drinking department.After some wandering, the pink neon Fette Sau sign beckons, kind of like that bar sign in Mr. Destiny (...Jim Belushi movie? Too obscure/random a reference?), and outside Craig N. and Molly C. are smokin' and cheery. Besides these two fine specimens, outside of Fette Sau ain't much to look at -- basically a lot of concrete/pavement. There are some tables out, presumably for summer dining, but it's barren 'cause it's colder than a witch's tit.Stopping to chat, I learn very quickly that Craig is intoxicated, quite full, and feeling quite generous with his leftovers, which are just begging to be taken advantage of. I hurry through the doors before he changes his mind.Inside, Fette Sau is kind of like a pub, but also industrial at the same time -- garage-like, as others have noted. I see that my fellow Yelpers have commandeered one of the long communal pic-a-nic tables. I seem to have caught the aftermath of the carnage, as it's not as rowdy as I would've thought; everybody seems to have settled into a beer/meat induced stupor.Except Oriana. She's babbling about getting more sausage. Can't get her fill of it, apparently. Jon S. chronicled some pretty good quotes that may or may not be attributable to Lady O.Anywhoo, I go to order a beer from the bar, and there's a bunch of stuff on tap I've never tried. This is always exciting. I ask for a suggestion, and the bartender makes a pretty good one.Sitting back down and stealing a rib from Craig's tray, it's pretty tasty, and comes off the bone just the way it ought to. It's been a while since I've had some good BBQ, and so Fette Sau stirs up some finger-lickin' memories.Craig and Molly come in and I try Craig's drink -- a bourbon stout. I know that I love stouts. But I sure don't know what a bourbon stout is -- I mean, I know bourbon, I know stout, but their powers combined? Color me clueless. Whatever the bastard is, it's potent (9.0% alcohol?), and that's a winner in my books. I think we can deduce that I loved this drink, but I played it cool and we passed it around. Nobody else wanted to kill it, so I got to. I was pleased.Later at the insistence of Molly C. (whom Craig was now resting his head on, a sign of things to come), I tried the baked beans -- and whaddya know, the broad's onto something; little bits of pulled pork mixed in definitely add to the flavor. Meat is always a welcome addition, and I particularly enjoy when it's a surprise, since it's only the best surprise ever. Sneaky meat.Anyways, Fette Sau fills up and is obviously pretty popular for good reason. If you have a big group, do what the Yelpers did -- get there early, eat your stuff, digest, then turn over the real estate.Likewise, you can make like me and get there late to pilfer the leftovers from near comatose patrons. Ain't no shame in scavenging. Thanks Craig!",4.0

"Big communal picnic tables, they give you a metal tray and pile it with meat and then you pay and then you're happy.Everything I tried was really good. As a lapsed Jew, I relish the opportunity to put this varied an array of pork inside of me, but first the sides. The saurkraut is ok, crispy/new, but strong. The baked beans were amazing, the beans were burnt, the sauce was thick, and about a 1/5 of it was made of meat.  The broccoli salad is worth a try but not impressive.But the meat is fantastic. The pork ribs are dry rub and delicious. The pork belly had about 1/8 of an inch of fat on it, and the fat was perfect. You put the belly in your mouth and it just melted into a fattyporksauce which gently coated the tender meat as you chewed. The sausage link was good, but everything else I had was better. There are four sauces on the table, horseradish, a sweet barbecue sauce, something very vinegary, and something I can't remember.I had two beers. The first was (I think, I'll admit I wasn't completely sober by the time I got here) a stout or very dark lager, recommended by the bartender. It was pretty good. But someone else had gotten the Goose Island Bourbon Stout, which is the liquid average of bourbon, stout and molasses.

"This is what I have to say: shut it, haters. Fette Sau is amazing. I took my parents here and shared half a gallon of beer with my dad and then told them all my secrets.

I used to live in Texas and when my born and bred Texan friends came to visit they said, with glazed, pork-induced eyes, ""Uh, this is really, really fucking good."" The ribs are incredible. The brisket would make a Jewish grandmother thank Jahweh for life. The pork belly makes me curse my nine year stint as a vegetarian. Tell the dude dishing out the meat what you want and for how many people. He knows his shit and will give you the right amount. Fette Sau offers whiskey flights. WHISKEY FLIGHTS!!! Again, a single word for this: amazing. And as always, please tip your bartender. He knows his shit and will let you taste the beer- if you ask nicely- before you commit to a half (or whole) gallon.

"Why did I have to eat shortly before discovering this place on my last night in town?!?!?!?!?!My nose led me to this barbeque joint while walking to some bar down the street. My friend and I walked in just to breath in the wonderful scent of smoky barbeque'd goodness.  Luckily, we're fast walkers, so we had a long moment to take in all that we could before the rest of our group caught up to us.  What I did notice in my brief visit were lots of hipsters crammed into a small garage type with saucy fingers, huge gallon-sized jugs filled with beer, and quite a extensive whiskey selection.  I just knew I would be returning before the night was over.So i get to the bar, and am having a great time with my friends and with the new people I met, but the whole time I was there all I could think of was ditching these people so that I can return to the Fette Sau before they closed.  Does that make me a bad person?  If so, then I don't want to be good...   Upon returning,  it was near closing time.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and a jar of beer.  Both were pretty darn tasty,  I only wish I were able to go earlier to taste the full menu.  But for what I did experience, I was rather impressed.  And trust me, I know barbeque.  I do see a return visit to this fine establishment in my near future.  I will update with all the juicy details soon!",4.0
I'd passed this place many times thinking it was just a  pretentious Euro-cafe..until..I wandered in on a drunken biking bar/food crawl with an old crazy friend  The decor is most amazingly like a stoner uncles back yard..but roofed. Pic-nic tables and beer served in mason jars. The food is served by weight on a tray which is just slapped on by the lunch lady line. I don't remember there being utensils.I was already drunk mind you. I loved the optional mason jar sizes of a fantastic Germanic beer selection up to a gallon even!With jar & tray in hand.

"I love this place.  Like terrible crack addiction love.  I've been back more times than I can count after I first found this place and its late night menu while trying to find an after midnight eatery in the neighborhood.  Fette Sau stands apart from the other barbecue restaurants in NYC trying to emulate some other style or region.  Instead they take the best techniques and the best meats and makes them into something that, at least for me and my experiences with the barbecue of my home state, tastes and feels like authentic barbecue despite the regional ambiguities.This is the best barbecue restaurant in New York.  The giant smoker that makes your clothes and hair smell like meat smoke for days.  Their daily changing menu of classic barbecue meats (brisket, ribs, sausage) and  their more adventurous cuts of meat (pork cheeks & tail, lamb shank, pork belly).  Their local, solid beer and amazing bourbon selections.  Communal seating and a local, rustic feel that reminds me of sitting in a small little barbecue joint on some back road in Texas.  It all leads to me having to check myself several times a week from dropping in to eat some 'cue in the interest of not gaining 10 pounds every month.It really is a great celebration of meat and fat and great barbecuing techniques.  The fat on the brisket and pork belly always melts in my mouth the way good barbecue should.  Always a nice, thick smoke ring and flavor, plus their crazy good rub has me licking my fingers and wiping my rolls along the paper tray liner.  Like I said, it's hard not to go here every week.The sauces are all nice, though a review I read a long time ago suggested mixing the 3 sauces together and I have to agree that it tastes better than any one alone.  The ""classic"" barbecue sauce  (seems like Texas BBQ style sauce to me) they have is a bit to sweet to me by itself.  In all honesty, you don't really need sauce because the meat is so darn good.  As for the sides, like a lot of good barbecue restaurants they are so meat-focused that the sides are just ok but second fiddle to the meat.  Broccoli Salad is one of the stand outs, as are the Burnt End Baked Beans chock full of crispy brisket/pastrami ends.  I like pickles with my barbecue but the pickles they have don't really go well with the meats; local and delicious pickles yes, but too briny and abrasive to go with the complex flavors of their smoky meats.The staff is really nice and helpful.  Barbecue and hospitality go hand in hand in my book.  Just tell them how many people you have and what meats you want and they can guide you through the process of ordering how much meat you want to eat by pounds, something unfamiliar to some Northerners.Every time a friend comes and visits from Texas I take them there and they go from being skeptical to falling in love after the first bite.  One of my last converts insisted on picking up a couple of pounds of pork belly to take on the plane trip home.  I imagine there were some jealous people on his plane.  Anywhere that's a 5 minute walk from my doorstep where I can eat hunks of meat with my hands is fine by me.  And the pork belly.  Sweet Jesus the pork belly.*Barbecue Tip: They open at 5pm and you should get there as early as you can because when they're out, they're out; plus barbecue always tastes better fresher rather than sitting under heat lamps for hours.",5.0

"This is what I have to say: shut it, haters. Fette Sau is amazing. I took my parents here and shared half a gallon of beer with my dad and then told them all my secrets. Fette Sau did pork belly before pork belly was cool. I'm sick of reviewers pulling the: ""Well! Back in Texas..."" card. Guess what? I used to live in Texas and when my born and bred Texan friends came to visit they said, with glazed, pork-induced eyes, ""Uh, this is really, really fucking good."" The ribs are incredible. The brisket would make a Jewish grandmother thank Jahweh for life. The pork belly makes me curse my nine year stint as a vegetarian. Tell the dude dishing out the meat what you want and for how many people. He knows his shit and will give you the right amount. Fette Sau offers whiskey flights. WHISKEY FLIGHTS!!! Again, a single word for this: amazing. And as always, please tip your bartender. He knows his shit and will let you taste the beer- if you ask nicely- before you commit to a half (or whole) gallon. Wait, what was that? It's hard trying to get a seat for you and 19 of your best friends at 7:30PM on a weekend? Boo hoo hoo. Stay in Manhattan next time.",5.0

"Why did I have to eat shortly before discovering this place on my last night in town?!?!?!?!?!My nose led me to this barbeque joint while walking to some bar down the street. My friend and I walked in just to breath in the wonderful scent of smoky barbeque'd goodness.  Luckily, we're fast walkers, so we had a long moment to take in all that we could before the rest of our group caught up to us.  What I did notice in my brief visit were lots of hipsters crammed into a small garage type with saucy fingers, huge gallon-sized jugs filled with beer, and quite a extensive whiskey selection.  I just knew I would be returning before the night was over.So i get to the bar, and am having a great time with my friends and with the new people I met, but the whole time I was there all I could think of was ditching these people so that I can return to the Fette Sau before they closed.  Does that make me a bad person?  If so, then I don't want to be good...   Upon returning,  it was near closing time.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and a jar of beer.  Both were pretty darn tasty,  I only wish I were able to go earlier to taste the full menu.  But for what I did experience, I was rather impressed.  And trust me, I know barbeque.  I do see a return visit to this fine establishment in my near future.  I will update with all the juicy details soon!",4.0
I'd passed this place many times thinking it was just a  pretentious Euro-cafe..until..I wandered in on a drunken biking bar/food crawl with an old crazy friend  The decor is most amazingly like a stoner uncles back yard..but roofed. Pic-nic tables and beer served in mason jars. The food is served by weight on a tray which is just slapped on by the lunch lady line. I don't remember there being utensils.I was already drunk mind you. I loved the optional mason jar sizes of a fantastic Germanic beer selection up to a gallon even!With jar & tray in hand.

"Waited for seats, waited for food, but it was well worth itI went here w/ friends on a Wednesday. Since they don't take reservations, I thought Wednesday should be a relatively quiet day. Boy, was I wrong.I got here at 7:45 PM, after nearly turning into a Popsicle after walking a 5+ min walk from the Bedford Ave L train station. This place is a converted garage, as mentioned by many people. They have park like wooden benches as soon as you walk into this garage. There's about 10-15 of them place parallel to each other until you get to the garage door. Each bench can sit 8 people comfortably,  but since they don't' have heat lamps, there wasn't anyone outside when I was there.Once I walked into the garage, I see a huge fake fireplace to my immediate left  with a huge plasma TV that showing a picture of a fire in a fireplace. Kinda trendy cool. There's probably 1/2 the amount of benches in here than outside, and that's where the problem begins. Since there's no wait service, you have to vulture over ppl that are sitting down, hoping they would be leaving soon. We are a group of 6, and we kind of divide into 2 groups of vultures hanging over 2 tables, sorta hedging our bets to get the 6 seats that we need. It took us close to 1/2 hour, as no one felt like leaving, which made us pretty hungry by then. Once we got our seats, we then saw how the once empty line for the food stretched out all the way to the entrance. I wouldn't quite say its a sea of humanity, more like a line waiting to get in a club or the unemployment line (gasp! sorry, but that's current economic conditions). We decide to cut in, like 2 other ppl in front of us did. Its not really a cut, as we were really here before all these ppl, just that we didn't feel like getting our food and then end up having to stand and eat. This is where the other problem is. They only have 1 counter for all meats, so service  is expectedly slow. Even with only 2 ppl in front of us, we ended up waiting a good 20 minutes before it was our turn to get the food. At that point, I was contemplating how low a Yelp rating this can go...But as soon as I had my first bite of the food, my frown turn into a smile and all is well. Here's what we had:Pork shoulders - delicious, tender and very flavorfulRibs - fall off the bone, WowPork Belly - Eat bite is tender, juicy, and almost all fat, which makes it so goodBrisket - so soft and deliciousSausages - a bit spicy, but a lot of delicious flavorsbun - crap, stuff you can get at supermarkets, except you wouldn't want to, its really crappy that you will be like, ""I don't want to put that yummy _____(name your meat) on this crap""Drinks - toasted lager - a nice flavor to it, not too light and not too heavy, I downed more than a few pintsTotal $94 for food $36 for beer ( a gallon)Even though the wait sucks, the food is well worth the wait to come back.

I sampled the ribs $22 per pound, the pulled pork $18 per pound, the Pastrami $25 per pound, the briskett 18$ per pound and the sausage links. There are also several sides to choose from and they give you some small potato rolls to make sandwiches. The two sauces on the table were excellent. I will take them in order. The ribs were fantastic and in some ways exceeded the quality of Pappy's in St. Louis because the rub doesn't stay you for two days. The pulled pork was very good, possibly great but not overly moist. The sausage links were stellar, crisp bite like a pickle and bursting with flavor. The brisket had a nice peppery kick to it but in my opinion was overcooked. The Pastrami was rubbery and should be removed from the menu. You are within five miles of the best Pastrami in the planet, stick to Katz deli. The food is sent out on paper like in Texas and the whole experience is entirely uplifting.

The pork cheek stood out the most though, the outer skin looked burnt, but actually revealed a whole pile of sweet and tender porky goodness. I would leave my comfortable apartment to set up camp in front of Fette Sau, just so I could eat this amazing food every day.  If you're coming for the first time, don't worry about finding a seat, trust me by the time you get your food and drinks there will be a seat on one of the picnic benches for you to park your keester on.

"Absolutely delicious. This was some of finest BBQ I've ever had in my life. Mix in the fact that you can drink a gallon of beer while you wait in the line (which is long).

"I'm going to mark this down as the best BBQ in Brooklyn.  A varied selection of cuts that depend on when you come round and a nice selection of sides makes things interesting.  The slaw, pickles, and beans are my favorite sides.  I haven't had a bad bite there yet.Table service isn't the thing here, so if you are looking for something like that, this isn't the place for you.  Meat is served cafeteria style, by the pound (you can ask for halves and quarters as well) and doled out on your own personal tray.  Finding a seat can be a little challenging depending on how heavy the crowd is, but I haven't had much of a problem.If all else fails, you can always do take-out.",4.0

Everything was smoky and tender. I know that they have slightly different choices every day, but from what I tried, everything was a winner.",4.0
Wow pork galore! I feel bad for what goes on with the piggies in this place. The pulled pork was amazing. The pork belly was just FAT so it wasn't my cup of tea. The sausage was delicious. This place is a bit on the expensive side. I took away a star for that. And another star because the stupid server ruined our night by being strict with the NON-byob policy. He even brought out a baggie in an attempt to kick us out even though we were sitting outside. So we took our pork and left. Hmph. I enjoyed my pork better with my coors light at home anyway!,3.0

"Fette Sau is deliciousness! This place is great if you're looking to stuff your face with smoked meats and down a few pints of brew.Meat is available fresh daily by the pound. Of note is the pork belly; it's fally, delicious, and melts in your mouth. The brisket is usually good too, and so are the sausages. The pulled pork is decent. Any meal at Fette Sau must include the beans - they're spicy but not too spicy and feature chunks of meat hidden in the sauce!The bar also features a good variety of beers that you can order by the gallon if need be. I hear there is also fine whiskey on hand. There are very few items on the menu that are vegetarian friendly so leave your vegetarian/vegan friends at home for this one. Also, leave your friends on a diet at home too.The places gets pretty packed on the weekends, so go early or go on the weekday. Also, they sometimes run out of meats later on in the evening. So far this is my favorite BBQ place in the five boroughs. I have yet to try all of them, but I do prefer Fette Sau to Dinosaur BBQ.",5.0
"Let's be honest here: getting good BBQ in New York City is basically impossible.  You can't really get good BBQ until you start getting into the Carolinas, although there may be a few places scattered around Virginia and the District.  But really, BBQ in NYC is generally a losing proposition.Fette Sau is... well, it's perfectly adequate BBQ for New York.  The best is, without a doubt, the pork belly.  That is something to come for, but the rest, eh.",3.0
"The quality of meat served here is top-notch; unfortunately, it's also poorly seasoned (if at all), and leaner cuts were dry.  Here's a quick run-through:-Boneless Beef Rib: Granted, I usually like my red meat cooked just beyond the point where it might put up a fight, but this cut of boneless rib was feisty! I had to fight it with a fork, 2 hands, and my teeth before managing to rip a bite off the dry, fibrous log.- Beef Brisket: The quality of the meat was evident, but again, it was cooked so dry that it stuck together like a brick instead of falling apart like brisket should. Additionally, a simple dash of salt would've really helped to bring out the flavor of the meat.- Pork Belly: This was a lot more moist; naturally the ribbon of fat that defines a pork belly helped to improve the fate of this cut. However, flavor again was lacking and i really craved salt along with a dousing of the bbq sauce to accompany.- Pulled Pork Shoulder: Easily the best of the meat, this may have been some of the best pulled pork I've had in a while. It was minimally seasoned, but a little dip in bbq sauce and vinegar really brought out the best.- Sausage: Always a fan of a good weiner, this one had a light fennel aroma, but I wished it had some grill marks to give it the char it needed. I regretted not trying one of the pork ribs, but they looked too dry and lean in the meat case to bet on. Also the broccoli side salad was fantastic, outshining some of the meat.I was amused by the fireplace video in the wall and the trailer park/vintage feel of the outside front patio area, but the real star of this place is the bar! Whiskey flights ranging from $12-$18 for 3 tastes, with some flights hovering at higher price ranges. You can get a glass gallon for $32-36. The bloody mary was SLAMMIN! the best and most perfect I've had in nyc. Be prepared to wait, as the line forms quickly and service is typical Williamsburg (sloooooooow).

"Fette Sau is deliciousness! This place is great if you're looking to stuff your face with smoked meats and down a few pints of brew.Meat is available fresh daily by the pound. Of note is the pork belly; it's fally, delicious, and melts in your mouth. The brisket is usually good too, and so are the sausages. The pulled pork is decent. Any meal at Fette Sau must include the beans - they're spicy but not too spicy and feature chunks of meat hidden in the sauce!The bar also features a good variety of beers that you can order by the gallon if need be. I hear there is also fine whiskey on hand. There are very few items on the menu that are vegetarian friendly so leave your vegetarian/vegan friends at home for this one. Also, leave your friends on a diet at home too.The places gets pretty packed on the weekends, so go early or go on the weekday. Also, they sometimes run out of meats later on in the evening. So far this is my favorite BBQ place in the five boroughs. I have yet to try all of them, but I do prefer Fette Sau to Dinosaur BBQ.",5.0
"Let's be honest here: getting good BBQ in New York City is basically impossible.  You can't really get good BBQ until you start getting into the Carolinas, although there may be a few places scattered around Virginia and the District.  But really, BBQ in NYC is generally a losing proposition.Fette Sau is... well, it's perfectly adequate BBQ for New York.  The best is, without a doubt, the pork belly.  That is something to come for, but the rest, eh.",3.0
"The quality of meat served here is top-notch; unfortunately, it's also poorly seasoned (if at all), and leaner cuts were dry.  Here's a quick run-through:-Boneless Beef Rib: Granted, I usually like my red meat cooked just beyond the point where it might put up a fight, but this cut of boneless rib was feisty! I had to fight it with a fork, 2 hands, and my teeth before managing to rip a bite off the dry, fibrous log.- Beef Brisket: The quality of the meat was evident, but again, it was cooked so dry that it stuck together like a brick instead of falling apart like brisket should. Additionally, a simple dash of salt would've really helped to bring out the flavor of the meat.- Pork Belly: This was a lot more moist; naturally the ribbon of fat that defines a pork belly helped to improve the fate of this cut. However, flavor again was lacking and i really craved salt along with a dousing of the bbq sauce to accompany.- Pulled Pork Shoulder: Easily the best of the meat, this may have been some of the best pulled pork I've had in a while. It was minimally seasoned, but a little dip in bbq sauce and vinegar really brought out the best.- Sausage: Always a fan of a good weiner, this one had a light fennel aroma, but I wished it had some grill marks to give it the char it needed. I regretted not trying one of the pork ribs, but they looked too dry and lean in the meat case to bet on. Also the broccoli side salad was fantastic, outshining some of the meat.I was amused by the fireplace video in the wall and the trailer park/vintage feel of the outside front patio area, but the real star of this place is the bar! Whiskey flights ranging from $12-$18 for 3 tastes, with some flights hovering at higher price ranges. You can get a glass gallon for $32-36. The bloody mary was SLAMMIN! the best and most perfect I've had in nyc. Be prepared to wait, as the line forms quickly and service is typical Williamsburg (sloooooooow). Communal seating is first come, first serve, and credit cards are accepted.",3.0
"I'd been wanting to try this place for ages, and finally went a few Sundays ago. Sunday is a good day to go - less busy. What I loved: the food was delicious. Worth going just for those tasty ribs and baked beans. What I loved less: waiting in line and finding a spot to sit. It's not the most relaxing dining experience. I also thought it was pretty expensive for what it is. Having said that, I'd recommend to my friends and plan to go back!",4.0
Brisket was average. Pulled pork was really dry like it was sitting around for a couple days. The wait is ridiculous and the bartenders are inattentive. Really poor dining experience overall.,2.0
Excellent BBQ. Brisket and spares are great. Not much flavor on rub but their sauce goes well with it. Their pulled pork is excellent. Very flavorful without any sauce. Not a big fan of Brunt end beans but still good. Highly recommend for NY area.,4.0
"No joke some of the finest BBQ ive ever had, and this is coming from a Texan. Brisket and pulled pork were standouts...best baked beans I've ever had ... AMAZING booze list.

"So overhyped. Expected a mouth of full blast flavor and gluttonous overindulgence but I just ended up forcing myself to finish things. One thing I will say, the beans are amazing.

Your head will tell you no, and your insides will start to tell you no, but your mouth will continue to say yes.- Beef ribs -- They ran out RIGHT before we reached the counter, it was very sad, I'll have to come back another night for these.- Pulled pork shoulder -- mouth wateringly good, definitely not dry, even better with the many unlabeled sauces on the table.- Beef brisket -- smoky and perfect.- Sausage links -- no complaints here. Again, really good with the sauces.Pork ribs -- Not my favorite, but still very yummy.The pickles were also amazing (I got a second order to go) and the baked beans were very good, some bits of meat found their way into them but that's OK with me.My only complaints: One, this place is wayy too crowded, even after 8 on a Sunday; and two, the staff is indeed surly!

"Apparently there exists a non-trivial segment of the population who enjoys ordering meat by the pound. In theory, I was no exception and thus, in need of an interesting dinner excursion, my friend and I required little convincing to venture over to this barbecue haven. Forearmed with the knowledge that the lines could be perilous, we ate relatively early and were still confronted with a twenty-minute queue, which was no big deal on a lovely summer's evening. The place itself is reminiscent of a garage workshop (apparently the aesthetic of choice when it comes to barbecue) and, as we waited in line, we studied the numerous options on the menu board, attempting to limit our salivation in polite company. A pound of this and a pound of that? Can we do half a pound of the other? What about a side of burnt end baked beans? With serious negotiations underway, we almost broke under pressure when it came to ordering, but ended up with a pound of the Berkshire belly and half a pound of the brisket together with those beans as a side. To say that the order was gluttonous is putting it mildly and, with pounds and mounds of food before us, we expected great things indeed. Making our way to the long communal tables, we grabbed the free bread rolls and got down to business. ""So? What do you think?"" to which my eating companion responded, rather unconvincingly, ""Good. What do you make of it?"" What did I make of it? As far as barbecue goes, it was fine - A-OK as Yelp likes to define it and the brisket was actually quite tasty. However, as my friend suggested, Dinosaur Bar-B-Que is probably better. The bread rolls were not even worth the calories - perhaps cheap bread rolls are the standard barbecue accomplice (I'm not generally a huge barbecue fan and so I am wholly uneducated in this field)? The baked beans were incredibly mediocre and we both gave up on that front. Needless to say, our eyes were far bigger than our stomachs and there was probably a pound of meat remaining when we threw in the napkins, surrendering to the charging cholesterol clogging our arteries. The sad fact was that neither of us wanted to take the heap of flesh home for subsequent meals - it just wasn't that good.Conclusion: If you're in a barbecue state of mind and are looking to grab a beer and pounds of meat in the Williamsburg area, Fette Sau is probably a good option. A casual, drawn out (expect an interminable wait) meal on a lazy summer evening - why not? Will you find salvation in this barbecue? No. Will you be dreaming of this for days? I hope not. Is it possible that, like me, you'll err on the side of vegetarianism for a while after said meal? That, dear Yelper, is entirely possible.",3.0
"One of the best tasting Barbecue joints I have eaten at in my life.The Pulled Pork is comparable to Allen & Sons off of 15/501 in North Carolina, except slightly drier.The Ribs are amazing, in one word, succulent!The Brisket is tender, slightly dry at times, but good as far as Brisket goes outside of Texas! Could use a little bit more smoke. I assume that it depends when you get the brisket out of the cooker, since brisket tends to change over short periods of time.The best part of my meals here have always been the baked beans!!! I mean they really outdid any other place I have ever had beans at. Do you like beans, if you do, you'll love them, if you don't, you'll still love them, YES they are that good!Their selection of Beer is unique, but very suiting, they have exactly what fits with the down home atmosphere of the sprawling beer hall style tables and benches. It's as if they are telling you to ""Come on in, make yourself at home, and have a Jug of some sweet Brew."" And if you don't like brew, they always have a huge selection of bourbons and whiskeys that could make a knowledgeable man foam at the mouth.I prefer the place during the summer time, cause nothing says summer more than Beer and Barbecue, but in the winter there is a nice fireplace that has seasonal images or fireplace DVDs running that make you feel all warm inside.Overall - 5 stars A++",5.0
"What a madhouse! Felt like an upgraded high school cafeteria vibe only I had to pay a lot of money for my food. I also felt a little ill afterwards. Not sure if it was only the food, or the overwhelming crowd and the lines. It tasted pretty good, but not worth the sheckles.",2.0
"Wow this place is fantastic! What makes it even better is that they serve GALLON jugs of beer! What other place do you know of that serves gallon jugs of good beer for a mere $32?

"The Q is expertly cooked, but the cuts themselves could be a bit more appealing.  While gristle adds taste, I'd like a better meat to gristle ratio on my plate.  The sides are pretty solid, however.  I'd have liked more choices in sauce, since the one they put out is pretty bland.  I'm sure there's better BBQ to be had for similar prices around here, and I'm going to find it.",3.0

"Apparently there exists a non-trivial segment of the population who enjoys ordering meat by the pound. In theory, I was no exception and thus, in need of an interesting dinner excursion, my friend and I required little convincing to venture over to this barbecue haven. Forearmed with the knowledge that the lines could be perilous, we ate relatively early and were still confronted with a twenty-minute queue, which was no big deal on a lovely summer's evening. The place itself is reminiscent of a garage workshop (apparently the aesthetic of choice when it comes to barbecue) and, as we waited in line, we studied the numerous options on the menu board, attempting to limit our salivation in polite company. A pound of this and a pound of that? Can we do half a pound of the other? What about a side of burnt end baked beans? With serious negotiations underway, we almost broke under pressure when it came to ordering, but ended up with a pound of the Berkshire belly and half a pound of the brisket together with those beans as a side. To say that the order was gluttonous is putting it mildly and, with pounds and mounds of food before us, we expected great things indeed. Making our way to the long communal tables, we grabbed the free bread rolls and got down to business. ""So? What do you think?"" to which my eating companion responded, rather unconvincingly, ""Good. What do you make of it?"" What did I make of it? As far as barbecue goes, it was fine - A-OK as Yelp likes to define it and the brisket was actually quite tasty. However, as my friend suggested, Dinosaur Bar-B-Que is probably better. The bread rolls were not even worth the calories - perhaps cheap bread rolls are the standard barbecue accomplice (I'm not generally a huge barbecue fan and so I am wholly uneducated in this field)? The baked beans were incredibly mediocre and we both gave up on that front. Needless to say, our eyes were far bigger than our stomachs and there was probably a pound of meat remaining when we threw in the napkins, surrendering to the charging cholesterol clogging our arteries. The sad fact was that neither of us wanted to take the heap of flesh home for subsequent meals - it just wasn't that good.Conclusion: If you're in a barbecue state of mind and are looking to grab a beer and pounds of meat in the Williamsburg area, Fette Sau is probably a good option. A casual, drawn out (expect an interminable wait) meal on a lazy summer evening - why not? Will you find salvation in this barbecue? No. Will you be dreaming of this for days? I hope not. Is it possible that, like me, you'll err on the side of vegetarianism for a while after said meal? That, dear Yelper, is entirely possible.",3.0
"One of the best tasting Barbecue joints I have eaten at in my life.The Pulled Pork is comparable to Allen & Sons off of 15/501 in North Carolina, except slightly drier.The Ribs are amazing, in one word, succulent!The Brisket is tender, slightly dry at times, but good as far as Brisket goes outside of Texas! Could use a little bit more smoke. I assume that it depends when you get the brisket out of the cooker, since brisket tends to change over short periods of time.The best part of my meals here have always been the baked beans!!! I mean they really outdid any other place I have ever had beans at. Do you like beans, if you do, you'll love them, if you don't, you'll still love them, YES they are that good!Their selection of Beer is unique, but very suiting, they have exactly what fits with the down home atmosphere of the sprawling beer hall style tables and benches. It's as if they are telling you to ""Come on in, make yourself at home, and have a Jug of some sweet Brew."" And if you don't like brew, they always have a huge selection of bourbons and whiskeys that could make a knowledgeable man foam at the mouth.I prefer the place during the summer time, cause nothing says summer more than Beer and Barbecue, but in the winter there is a nice fireplace that has seasonal images or fireplace DVDs running that make you feel all warm inside.Overall - 5 stars A++",5.0
"What a madhouse! Felt like an upgraded high school cafeteria vibe only I had to pay a lot of money for my food. I also felt a little ill afterwards. Not sure if it was only the food, or the overwhelming crowd and the lines. It tasted pretty good, but not worth the sheckles.",2.0

"Fette Sau, I wish I could give you 5 starts, I really do.First of all, this BBQ joint is the perfect example of  ""welcome to Bedford!"" I don't consider it as a good or bad thing, its just very, Bedford-ish, you get the idea.It might be hard for first timer to find them since the pink neon sign is somewhat lack the size to be eye catching, and the entrance is about as wide as any mechanic's drive way. Even with the benches, you might think that was just someone's backyard. Thankfully, there are usually groups of people at the entrance which might help you to finally realize, Fette Sau, is right down the path.It's all about meat, meat, and meat, and... meat, and a bit of beans and cakes, drinks and meat at Fette Sau. Okay, here comes the bomb, the price. I have to say its a bit pricey just because after all, this is Brooklyn. However since the migration of hipsters from the city, poor economy, and being in the south side, i don't blame Fette Sau.Of course you can pay $4 for half lb of whatever, but it adds up pretty fast especially if you also have some beer with the meal.The food is good, not WOWOMGINSANE, but good enough compare to other bbq places at Williamsburg Greenpoint area. I don't drink so i have no idea if the beer collection is good (sorry ), but since most of the customers are happy, should be good. The only downside it always gets me is the amount of fat on some of the items. I know fat is awesome and good, but when you get half of what you ordered in fat form, its a let down for me. Decor wise, open space, not filled with eye candies but hey, its all about the food.There you have it, my 2 cents on Feete Sau, good place if you have a sudden craving for BBQ meat and don't want to take the stubborn L train, however, be prepared to pay Manhattan price. (well now days its everywhere in GP/WB ) Oh, just so if you are wondering what's with the roll (martin's potato rolls)  that people are dishing about, its basically whitecastle buns.PS: They deliver with minimum of 10 dollars Sunday - Thursday 5pm-11pm (btween Kent and Graham, N14 and B'way)",3.0
"If you love BBQ, craft ales, and good whiskeys, get ready to go to heaven at Fette Sau. I am a bbq aficionado, and this is very fine bbq by any standard.

"A great BBQ Joint. It was loud. Service (at the counter) was slow. But the meats were wonderful. We hung around for about two and a half hours drinking beer and eating some great BBQ.Definitely stake out a table while someone gets food. Our group of 6 waited about 30 minutes to get seats. We ordered about three and a half pounds of meat with 3 large sides for six people and it wasn't a ton of food. So plan on getting a little more meat depending on how hungry you are. Also skip the rolls they are store brought.Ribs were fall off the bone tender but could have more meat on them. Links were good and so were the boneless beef ribs.

"As a born-again meatatarian, this place has been super high on my list.  However, getting people (myself included) to Brooklyn is a stretch, and in winter, nearly impossible. Add this to the fact that the line for Fette Sau usually extends outdoors.  But since hearing co-workers and basically every Man-type who's ever eaten here rave that it's the best BBQ ever, I had to come up with a reason to go.  So this weekend, when the bf's frat bros were in town, I suggested we make the trek for some good meat...  The experience may have been different, had it not been a random spring day in January, but the wait (~1:30 hr) didn't seem too bad.  Since they let you drink in line, the increasing drunkenness of the people around you provides for some decent entertainment.  Once we got to the counter, we ordered basically everything they had left...Sausage, pulled pork, brisket, and pork belly plus beans, potato salad, cole slaw, and pickles.  The meat was really great.  Since coming back to meat, it's taken me a little longer to get back to pig things, but the pork belly and all it's fatty awesomeness was basically heaven.  In fact, that and the pulled pork were far and away my favorite things.  I don't know about the prep process of either, but I think it's complicated and they nailed it.On the downside, I'm a sides and condiments type of person, and those left something to be desired.  The beans were good, and Guss's pickles are pickles, and I like pickles, but otherwise I had higher hopes for some meat compliments.  That said, the meat was fantastic.  We scarfed our trays in about 10 minutes, and then, since it was around 10 already, we got another growler and hung out til after 11.  While from a meat-only perspective, I can't think of any bbq I've had that's better, I think it will be a while until I make the trek again.  They could dial up the sides a bit, and try to find some more efficient way of assigning seating.  I understand the wait-in-line, find a seat concept, but circling tables like a vulture and stink-eyeing people with empty trays (and no drinks) until they get up, is not my favorite thing to do right before a feast.   Though once seated, and assuming you've got plenty of everything made with animal, the experience is really great.",4.0
"The one thing I expected going to New York was excellent barbecue, I mean besides muggings and apples, I think that's number one.  Okay maybe not, but it was a nice surprise.  In any case, Fette Sau is an impressive little place for several reasons.  Its pink neon sign looks a little frou frou pretentious, the inside is kind of homey industrial... The seating is communal and the food is served directly on trays with butcher paper.  It's nice in a city where everything is so put together, it's nice to have a dim and totally casual atmosphere.  You walk in to the smell of rich fatty smoke, a lineup of hungry hipster types and a chalkboard full of the daily meats.  You order everything at the counter and meats are sold by the pound.  There's a bar to the left of the counter that has a vast selection of whiskeys...  They have a wall-sized blackboard covered with flights of whiskey from preschool to old-school.  If you order your whiskey on the rocks it comes as a 2 oz jigger pour, so you'll be getting roughly the same amount every time, and they serve it in an old fashioned glass with the requisite 2x2 inch rock(ask for the McKendrick's western-style whiskey, it's amazing and super hard to find).  They serve beer in increments from 8oz to gallon jugs and all pretty fairly priced.  It's kind of confusing trying to figure out how much meat to order since the prices are by the pound, but  your 'cue slinger can size you up pretty well(you can always go get more).  I'm glad we let him pick how much we ate because I'd have ordered a pound of everything and as it was we left to-go containers of the vegetable sides in our friends' fridge when we fled the city.  We opted for the boneless beef rib, wild boar belly and sliced brisket, with small sides of burnt-ends beans, Chef's broccoli salad and german potato salad.  The long benches at the chow-tables were all full of people and jackets, so we took the last two thresher seats available at the bar and were glad we did.  Having a knowledgeable whiskey bartender almost to ourselves was interesting, not to mention she was quick with the mason jars of ice water. The Brisket was by far the star of the tray.  It fell apart when the guy was slicing it, and had a nice layer of blackened fat over the top. The texture was perfect and they had good permeation/penetration w/the smoke.  The boar belly, as one might expect, was a little tougher than pork belly, but the flavor was uhmazing and it was a little leaner than the pork. I'm kind of putting them in order of best to worst, so the beef rib, while the taste was spot on, the texture was kind of rough. The veg was ok, I mean, it was good, but I was way more into the meat so maybe that's why.  I have to say that the beans were a little too molassesy for me and the german potato salad needed some more salt and vinegar. The broccoli salad was really good, though, lightly cooked broccoli with some red pepper flakes and vinegar, served cold.  Don't come here looking for saucy barbecue...  Well, not the pre-sauced Chili's/Chain rib joint style stuff.   The sauce is served on the table and you have your choice... There are hotter smokier options, the classic reddish stuff with the sheen to it, and an excellent horseradishy/sharp mustard that goes surprisingly well on stuff, especially the broccoli.  This place is super popular, so get there early, and don't forget the McKendrick's(how can you go wrong with a whiskey filtered with mesquite chips?). Oh yeah and they open at five so don't try for lunch there.I'm sad that I didn't get me some pulled pork, since that's my general BBQ benchmark, but we'll be back... hopefully sooner than later.",4.0
"My favorite restaurant in NYC. Love their pulled pork, brisket, boneless beef ribs and most of all the pork belly. The beer and bourbon selections are second to none. You sometimes have to wait on a long line but still definitely worth a trip out to billyburg.",5.0
"GREAT tasting meat.  And MORE great tasting meat.Each time I go to Fette Sau, I just want to have everything.The meat looks good and tastes good.  We like the sides:  German potato salad and burnt baked beans.  They are generous with the buns.And the guy who cuts up the meat (twice we were there, it's the same guy), he is nice, polite, chill.  Not a hipster at all.  Thank goodness!Toughest part about dining at Fette Sau is not about making up your mind what to order.  Toughest past about dining at Fette Sau is about getting a table when you have your food!  You can see some people there potentially getting into a quarrel over a table and I am not kidding.  The wait in line is long (at least 20 minutes) and by the time you get your food, all you want to do is sit down and eat!  But more often than not, getting that table is very challenging to the point of being frustrating.",4.0
"A great BBQ Joint. It was loud. Service (at the counter) was slow. But the meats were wonderful. We hung around for about two and a half hours drinking beer and eating some great BBQ.Definitely stake out a table while someone gets food. Our group of 6 waited about 30 minutes to get seats. We ordered about three and a half pounds of meat with 3 large sides for six people and it wasn't a ton of food. So plan on getting a little more meat depending on how hungry you are. Also skip the rolls they are store brought.Ribs were fall off the bone tender but could have more meat on them. Links were good and so were the boneless beef ribs. The best meat was the brisket, so thick and tender! Oh pork belly was awesome; the fat was so rich and delicious. It's artery clogging good.",5.0
"This place brings out my inner caveman: bring me platters of meat and endless jugs of beer! You'll want to arrive early to have your choice of meats, because if you get here after 8pm, especially on a weekend, you'll likely be down to links and pulled pork. And you don't want to miss the BBQ pork belly! Best to arrive with a party large enough to split into thirds: one third to stand in line for food, another to stand in line for beer, and another to hold down an open table.",4.0

"As a born-again meatatarian, this place has been super high on my list.  However, getting people (myself included) to Brooklyn is a stretch, and in winter, nearly impossible. Add this to the fact that the line for Fette Sau usually extends outdoors.  But since hearing co-workers and basically every Man-type who's ever eaten here rave that it's the best BBQ ever, I had to come up with a reason to go.  So this weekend, when the bf's frat bros were in town, I suggested we make the trek for some good meat...  The experience may have been different, had it not been a random spring day in January, but the wait (~1:30 hr) didn't seem too bad.  Since they let you drink in line, the increasing drunkenness of the people around you provides for some decent entertainment.  Once we got to the counter, we ordered basically everything they had left...Sausage, pulled pork, brisket, and pork belly plus beans, potato salad, cole slaw, and pickles.  The meat was really great.  Since coming back to meat, it's taken me a little longer to get back to pig things, but the pork belly and all it's fatty awesomeness was basically heaven.  In fact, that and the pulled pork were far and away my favorite things.  I don't know about the prep process of either, but I think it's complicated and they nailed it.On the downside, I'm a sides and condiments type of person, and those left something to be desired.  The beans were good, and Guss's pickles are pickles, and I like pickles, but otherwise I had higher hopes for some meat compliments.  That said, the meat was fantastic.  We scarfed our trays in about 10 minutes, and then, since it was around 10 already, we got another growler and hung out til after 11.  While from a meat-only perspective, I can't think of any bbq I've had that's better, I think it will be a while until I make the trek again.  They could dial up the sides a bit, and try to find some more efficient way of assigning seating.  I understand the wait-in-line, find a seat concept, but circling tables like a vulture and stink-eyeing people with empty trays (and no drinks) until they get up, is not my favorite thing to do right before a feast.   Though once seated, and assuming you've got plenty of everything made with animal, the experience is really great.",4.0
"The one thing I expected going to New York was excellent barbecue, I mean besides muggings and apples, I think that's number one.  Okay maybe not, but it was a nice surprise.  In any case, Fette Sau is an impressive little place for several reasons.  Its pink neon sign looks a little frou frou pretentious, the inside is kind of homey industrial... The seating is communal and the food is served directly on trays with butcher paper.  It's nice in a city where everything is so put together, it's nice to have a dim and totally casual atmosphere.  You walk in to the smell of rich fatty smoke, a lineup of hungry hipster types and a chalkboard full of the daily meats.  You order everything at the counter and meats are sold by the pound.  There's a bar to the left of the counter that has a vast selection of whiskeys...  They have a wall-sized blackboard covered with flights of whiskey from preschool to old-school.  If you order your whiskey on the rocks it comes as a 2 oz jigger pour, so you'll be getting roughly the same amount every time, and they serve it in an old fashioned glass with the requisite 2x2 inch rock(ask for the McKendrick's western-style whiskey, it's amazing and super hard to find).  They serve beer in increments from 8oz to gallon jugs and all pretty fairly priced.  It's kind of confusing trying to figure out how much meat to order since the prices are by the pound, but  your 'cue slinger can size you up pretty well(you can always go get more).  I'm glad we let him pick how much we ate because I'd have ordered a pound of everything and as it was we left to-go containers of the vegetable sides in our friends' fridge when we fled the city.  We opted for the boneless beef rib, wild boar belly and sliced brisket, with small sides of burnt-ends beans, Chef's broccoli salad and german potato salad.  The long benches at the chow-tables were all full of people and jackets, so we took the last two thresher seats available at the bar and were glad we did.  Having a knowledgeable whiskey bartender almost to ourselves was interesting, not to mention she was quick with the mason jars of ice water. The Brisket was by far the star of the tray.  It fell apart when the guy was slicing it, and had a nice layer of blackened fat over the top. The texture was perfect and they had good permeation/penetration w/the smoke.  The boar belly, as one might expect, was a little tougher than pork belly, but the flavor was uhmazing and it was a little leaner than the pork.

"What is better than meat, whiskey, and beer? Well nothing, but combining the three in one convenient location sure competes with the individual components.Fette Sau is an innovative place.  Upon walking in a room redolent of a dank, western pit, you are faced with a case of delicious meats on the right and a small bar on the left [not to mention the old-school wooden benches for patrons to dine].  The bar - which features great craft brews, including 2 beers brewed specifically for the restaurant - sells beer by the half pint, pint, half gallon, and gallon for your dining pleasure.  There is too a tremendous selection of whiskey. This however ain't your average dining experience - expect no waitress to politely ask, ""What can I get for y'all.""  Stake a spot, *if* you can, and then head to the aforementioned meat counter where barbeque is sold by the pound.  Come hungry, folks.The food is darn good.  I LOVED the beef ribs and the pulled pork.  We flew through our order(s) of collard greens.  The brisket was too fatty for me to enjoy, although I know that's preferable for some.  What can I say? I'm a lean cut kind of girl.  I heard the pork belly was ""divine.""  The pork ribs were a bit dry, although they were reminiscent of the ribs featured at the ""best smokehouse"" in Mobile, Alabama [The Brick Pit]. Translation: it was fairly authentic - albeit with Billyburg prices [which are not *that* bad].My only real complaint is the lack of seating.  My party, which ordered a ton of food and alcohol, were then obliged to munch with heavy hearts, for hungry eyes glared at us with jealousy.  Despite the guilt, I subscribe to the ""no man left behind"" tenet.  I sat there, ate and drank until it was all gone, then followed it up with more drinks at its awesome brother bar ""Spuyten Duyvil.""  Good location, good food, good vibe.",4.0

Been there a number of times with a number of friends.....we all leave satisfied....food is amazing but the line sucks.....but at least you can wait and drink beer or a whisky from their large selection; they sell the beers in  jugs so you can keep refilling your self up.  The two types of people that dominate that seen is not for me....but that is irrelevant because the food is amazing.  I have had the sausages: pretty goodI have had the brisket: amazingI have had the st louis type ribs: amazingI have had the House Cured Pastrami: amazingSide dishes are weak though....but everything else makes up for that.......Highly recommend.,5.0
"This is not hog heaven but for humans who love 50+ bourbons/whiskey's, great pulled pork and ribs, a genial atmosphere, wax paper covered aluminum trays, simple, and old delta blues (or covers of) then it all fits together seamlessly whether or not you jive with the cumultative effect (note: service is too slow and frankly should be more knowledgeable behind the bar so bring your patient face or don't go).   god that was a long run on...Went for the first time the day before yesterday and the 2nd time yesterday.  Felt guilty and wondered if this would be straw that would spiral me towards a life of obesity, colon cancer and choked arteries but then I had a forkful of the pulled pork and a swig of 36 year old Ezra Brooks and all was good with the universe. oink oink",4.0
"What is better than meat, whiskey, and beer? Well nothing, but combining the three in one convenient location sure competes with the individual components.Fette Sau is an innovative place.  Upon walking in a room redolent of a dank, western pit, you are faced with a case of delicious meats on the right and a small bar on the left [not to mention the old-school wooden benches for patrons to dine].  The bar - which features great craft brews, including 2 beers brewed specifically for the restaurant - sells beer by the half pint, pint, half gallon, and gallon for your dining pleasure.  There is too a tremendous selection of whiskey. This however ain't your average dining experience - expect no waitress to politely ask, ""What can I get for y'all.""  Stake a spot, *if* you can, and then head to the aforementioned meat counter where barbeque is sold by the pound.  Come hungry, folks.The food is darn good.  I LOVED the beef ribs and the pulled pork.  We flew through our order(s) of collard greens.  The brisket was too fatty for me to enjoy, although I know that's preferable for some.  What can I say? I'm a lean cut kind of girl.  I heard the pork belly was ""divine.""  The pork ribs were a bit dry, although they were reminiscent of the ribs featured at the ""best smokehouse"" in Mobile, Alabama [The Brick Pit]. Translation: it was fairly authentic - albeit with Billyburg prices [which are not *that* bad].My only real complaint is the lack of seating.  My party, which ordered a ton of food and alcohol, were then obliged to munch with heavy hearts, for hungry eyes glared at us with jealousy.  Despite the guilt, I subscribe to the ""no man left behind"" tenet.  I sat there, ate and drank until it was all gone, then followed it up with more drinks at its awesome brother bar ""Spuyten Duyvil.""  Good location, good food, good vibe.",4.0
"Smokey goodness exudes from this place, but it doesn't come in the form of pulled pork or brisket.  I'm sure they are good, but I've never had them.  I stuck(literally) to my new favorite, smoked pork cheeks.  This is by far the best piece of BBQ I've ever eaten.  It is the cheek, as in mouth, normally very tough but when cooked properly, the sinew breaks down into an almost glue-like flavor masterpiece.  They actually taste and texture like a short rib.  I also tried the Akaushi beef flank, holy mother of Nippon....These items aren't always available because they are pretty expensive, about $16LB, but so worth it, I brought some home to Denver.  It helps that my brother is a regular and good friends with the staff and management.Wash it down with an 8yr Canadian Club Sherry Cask Whiskey, and call it a coma.",5.0
"The pulled pork is good but, this place is hipster heaven and the seating is really uncomfortable.  I suppose add a star or two if you're a hipster.",2.0
"Awesome, awesome, and awesome.  I consider myself a Southerner and I give this place a thumbs-up.  I brought my French pals here when the menu featured duck (very rare!) and they were so blown away.  I also took my German friends here at a different occasion and they keep telling me how amazing the meat was.  Also love the casual picnic table set up, it is so appropriate!",5.0
Pros: For a Southern BBQ snob I admit that their pork butt and shoulder and belly are dynamite.  Seating is no-frills and communal.  Trays are easy to share off of.Cons:  I smelled like my granddaddy's backyard trash fire when I left.  My coat smelled like a fucking Boy Scout Jamboree.  Get some ventilation Mr. Sau.  Also...can I please get my food AND beverage at the same counter??  I really don't feel like waiting behind some douchebag who's hitting on ladies at the bar in order to get a Sprite.  People talk about the rude service but seriously....I'll choke you out if you give me attitude after I've waited in line for 15 minutes to pay $8 a lbs for meat.Lurves me the food though!!,3.0
"5 stars for the best bacon I have ever had, the friendliest people you'll ever meet and the stiffest manhattan you'll ever drink.Run there, and skip gleefully, if you haven't eaten too much.",5.0
so. damn. good. the beef selections (beef brisket and boneless beef ribs) were my fave. i didnt love the pork belly or pulled pork as much but pretty good nonetheless. love the communal tables and cozy atmosphere. also the baked beans were amazing. the only thing that was annoying was that bagged potato chips (for the kid) were $2.75... really!?,4.0
"Combining a BBQ pit and a bar, who thought of this idea and why didn't I think of it first??I love this place for many reasons.... the aroma of bbq that fills the entire bar, the ""Whisky Flights"" ( three shots of different whiskeys for $10-15), the painted diagrams of cuts of beef all over the walls, the fake fireplace tv, the banquet hall seating tables that comprise the whole space (good for getting rowdy), the good beers (sunbock ale is awesome), the BBQ!!You really can't go wrong with a bar that sells beer by the gallon ( like milk).",5.0
Went last week with friends and we had a great time. We ordered family style and all the meats tasted delicious. My favorite was the smoked pork... yum! The sauces were phenomenal and added just the right amount of kick. Tried a lager and I wish I could remember the name because it paired very well with our meal.  I will definitely return!,5.0
"I've got pride, and I've got a little bit of an ego. Because of those two things, I get inordinately cranky when I feel like a) someone is trying to dupe me or b) I am successfully duped. This is how I feel about Fette Sau - or as I call it, ""Home of the Well-Fed Hipster.""Every time I've gone there, I've asked for maybe 1/4 pound of meat, a sausage link, one side and a beer. This never fails to cost me more than $20. The fact that I find the food seriously mediocre pisses me off even more. (The fact that I've gone to Fette Sau three times despite being disappointed each and every time qualifies me as a complete sucker.)The meat is never, EVER as good as it should be. I've had the pork butt, brisket, ribs, and two kinds of sausage - the only one I'd ever opt for again is one of the kinds of sausage. The meat is generally bland, in my opinion - sometimes even a little dry. The sides are ""eh,"" and overpriced. I liked the baked beans - the cole slaw is blech. The rolls are pathetic, and the house red wine taste like vinegar swirled around in a public toilet bowl. The fact that I'm one of very few people to rag on this place gives me pause, but what are you gonna do? All I know is that I really, really don't like this place. Sorry, Fette Sau. I wanted to love you.",2.0
"Yeah the BBQ is good - yeah, it's also pricey.  Beer is reasonable and comes in many different sizes of mason jar/grower combos.  Really not worth anything beyond a standard glass - doesn't save you anything to upgrade to larger sizes.  If you buy whiskey here (yes their selection is excellent), you are essentially condoning robbery.  Plus, like the french, they measure out their liquor, which is infuriating and, in my humble opinion, un-American.  Rethink that move, guys.  You are supposed to be a BBQ joint.  See the irony there?",3.0
"My friend and I were walking past and it looked like a really cool bar.  It's half inside, half outside with a picnic kinda feel.  Heather (the woman behind the bar) was so nice!  We chatted her up and she was very friendly, offering free shots and whatnot.  She introduced us to some locals that frequent the bar.  So fun!!Didn't try their food, but they had an interesting selection on vintage liquors and beer.  I personally recommend the cider!",5.0
sometimes i wake up in the middle of the night in a sweat after dreaming about this pulled pork. super dank.,5.0
