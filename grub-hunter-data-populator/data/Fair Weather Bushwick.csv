"I went to Fairweather Bushwick last week to try their tasting menu. I can describe it with one word; AMAZING! The whole experience was what I would call Bushwick style. This place doesn't look like a fancy restaurant from outside.  It is a café during the day serving to Bushwick regulars. In the evenings it turns into a farm to table New American restaurant. The ambiance for the tasting was definitely more private. Windows were covered in black curtains. It felt like I was walking into a speakeasy bar. It is a small room yet elegantly decorated, with art on the walls from what I was told was a local artist. Cafe tables were turned into a communal space all next to each other. I felt like I am joining this big family dinner. John Creger; the master Chef, and Ebru; the owner greeted us with a big smile. We took our seats, and the feast began. Boy, I don't remember how many dishes we had, but each and everyone one of them were delicately prepared. Each dish was very rich in flavor, yet were just the perfect portions to keep your appetite open all the way to the last course. John presented each dish with great enthusiasm. I could easily tell he takes great pride in his work. I don't blame him! Every course or two we were offered with a beer pairing, carefully selected by John. I am a big craft beer fan myself, and I was not familiar with any of the brewers he selected. I never did a beer pairing with a tasting menu, and I was very impressed how the different hops paired so well with each dish. Overall I highly recommend the tasting menu at Fairweather Bushwick. Whether you are taking a date or organizing a group dinner; this one for sure will impress your company as not many people knows this hidden gem in our neighborhood. Go before it becomes too popular, soon enough you may need to wait a month for a table :)",5.0
"Looks like the cafe is all but fully transitioned into a dinner menu restaurant. I'm glad it has because the food is fantastic.I went on a weekend and did the a la carte menu. Highlights are:Scallops - super light sear and buttery taste. Puréed parsnips were nice and lavendery/mintyGnocchi - Mac and cheese but gnocchi, super delicious and light-ish cheese sauce, crispy onions breadcrumbs were a nice change in textureShort rib - standard braised short rib with polenta, except this was REALLY good.Beets - tender thin slices folded over with a fresh emulsion in between, and glaze drizzled atop. Probably the most interesting and creative dish of the dayQuinoa fritters - fried delicacies, somehow gluten free too! Crispy, airy, and healthy tasting hahaPortions and aren't enough to be shared by more than 2 - they neglected to mention this. If you are with a bigger group double any particular dish. Def will be back for the tasting menu. This is the most casual fine dining you may ever do, go check it out! Welcome to bushwick",4.0
"This place is strong on ingredient quality and and unique fusions but I must say that's all there is to it.Where do I begin?The Service-- pretty much nonexistent. The poor lady must've been new or something because she never served us water more than once. got our orders mixed up more than three times and then to boot seemed pretty unknowledgeable about the very small menu she was offering us. When you have a dinner menu with about 7 options (you should have a rough idea of what it all is..don't cha' think?)The food- as i said above-- tasty, interesting pairings-- like coffee foam with artichoke cream, then beats delicately folded over nut cream-- ok cool---never had anything like that and this is why and the only reason why this place gets a star. A. for creativity.The price/portion-- to tell you more about the beets. There were 5 on a plate. They fit in the palm of my hand leaving circumference. and guess what-- a whopping 12.00The gnocchi was savory and tasted homemade...but again 16.00 for a small bowl you can barely share of gnocchi?If they are known for small plates-- then they should say it is a tapas bar and adjust to tapas pricing.In conclusion this is not the place you want to take a large group of people. Maybe its good for a coffee or brunch...maybe theres more to this place to be fair. But it leaves the door at Dinner time.Starving and 84.00 dollars thinner.",1.0
"I was very underwhelmed with my experience here. Service was good but the food and space left me wanting more. It's a really narrow space (rail road style), I'm sure someone's Spanish grandma was bought out of her apartment to create this restaurant, Lol. But they enhanced the decor and upgraded to the usual hipster aesthetic. Exposed brick, wooden tables/stools and industrial touches throughout.We were seated in a really cramped area, so close to our neighbor that my stool was on their jacket. It was awkward, but hey we're in NY.Our waitress was new - she kept asking another waitress questions we asked her - which was fine. But she kept forgetting things like utensils, napkins, water, etc. The other girl just ended up serving us altogether.I had the red eye brunch dish with a side of potatoes for $3 extra. My boyfriend had the breakfast sandwich with turkey and a side arugula salad for $4. The red eye dish was so disappointing, it had all the workings that make for a delicious dish yet it didn't deliver. Picture this: eggs and pork belly over a brioche bun topped with Turkish coffee gravy. Sounds awesome right? No. It had absolutely no flavor. I added salt and it didn't even absorb it. The bread got soggy with the gravy and it just didn't work out well. The breakfast sandwich, however, was delicious. Very simple and very tasty. The side of potatoes came with maybe 10 tiny pieces. I swear I think they gave me someone's leftover bowl by mistake. I immediately asked our waitress and she brought out a full bowl. It was so strange. Arugula salad was good.Overall, nothing about this place made me want to come back. It was just A-OK. There are so many fantastic brunch spots in Bushwick that I frequent that are much better than this place.",3.0
"This place used to be my regular spot, but now it's closed more than it's open, isn't a coffee shop anymore, and instead serves overpriced eclectic brunch and dinner. I understand changing hours to better suit the business, but to give a neighborhood the coffee shop they always wanted and then completely change is just upsetting.Variety a few blocks down is thrilled with the new business though and that's now unfortunately where I have to make my new coffee home. I am pretty devastated.",2.0
"Service- Very friendly and personable. Taste- ordered Fair weather omelet. I didn't realized it had goat cheese, spinach and prosciutto. The combinations were surprisingly good. Home fries proration was small. French toast had a good taste but needs to make it bigger portion. My partner and I shared and he was still hungry. The coffee was strong just like I like it. Overall good. Price- $30.00 for two coffees and two entrees. Not too bad. Atmosphere - pretty nice decor. I guess reuse and rustic look is still in. I would cover stains on ceiling. Chairs are uncomfortable if you plan to dine in. Didn't see if bathrooms were clean. Overall seemed very clean.",4.0

"This place is awesome. We came in here for a Saturday brunch. We ordered a latte and Bloody Mary to start. The hostess is lovely and accommodating. We got a fair weather omelette and a Nutella French toast, both delicious. Highly recommend if you're looking for a relaxed brunch spot.",5.0
"No bueno senor! (But damn my Nutella french toast was delish)It is quite annoying walking into these hipster restaurants and being looked at with suprise like we don't belong there.It is also quite annoying to be holding a menu I just had time to read and being told the cost of items.          Me: ""May I have avacado with that""A strained face waitress: ""Oh that would be 2 dollars extra"" Hey, your place is tiny with no outside barrier to prevent cold weather from coming in. Your patrons ARE doing you a favor by choosing you (because got - damn that Nutella fresh toast  was lovely) be sure not to talk down to them. Lastly, up the portion size. Brunch should be heavy as most people skip breakfast and lunch for it.",1.0
"I love this place! I had a 10 course tasting menu, with a beer pairing that was to die for. The chef, John Creger laid out unique, well balanced and totally delicious plates before us. I wanted more of every dish! I especially loved the clam chowder with leeks and trout roe, and the sunchoke valoute with hazelnut and coffee foam. I've never even had a sunchoke before! It was really great. I was happy to hear that all the ingredients are locally sourced. I enjoyed the relaxed, hip vibe as well as the reasonable prices for food that could also qualify as art.  Let's be honest, I photographed some of the plates. Can't wait to go back!",5.0
"First off, this review is for the tasting menu only. And, because I'm not sure how often the menu changes, this was for the night of 3/30.When my partner and I showed up, shortly before the meal was about to start, the vibe was warm and welcoming. A larger party had arrived before us and everyone was congregating around the bar in the back and there was a buzz of conversation, which gave the venue a very casual feel. We introduced ourselves to the bartender/hostess who immediately offered us a complimentary glass of champagne (yes, please). As dinnertime approached, everyone quickly took their unassigned seats around a communal table.The meal (paraphrased):1st course:A slow-cooked fingerling potato with a rarebit treatment, over a bed of crispy potato shards. Though an interesting concept, I felt this course failed to hit on a few points. First, the potato seemed a tad undercooked for my taste, coupled with the fact that this course was served with only a fork, which made eating it a little difficult. I'm not sure if it was intended that we just spear it and fork the whole thing into our mouths, or spear it and then nibble off bites until it was more manageable. In the end, I think most people attempted to cut it with the fork, which was doable, but not ideal. Secondly, the rarebit sauce didn't really impart the beer/cheese flavor I was hoping for, so it didn't quite evoke its namesake. 2nd course:A pickled beet ravioli with pesto ricotta, dried beet powder/crumble, and beet caramel. This was a pretty successful course on most fronts. The beet maybe could have been pickled a bit longer, but the flavors were all very solid and showcased the beet in many ways. For me the dried beet was the most interesting component, with a deeply concentrated beet flavor that was both earthy, yet brought out the beet's inherent sweetness.3rd course:Slow-cooked cauliflower florets over a curried cauliflower puree, dusted with brown butter powder. This again was a pretty successful course. The puree had a nice curry flavor without being overly spicy. My florets were possibly a tad overdone for my taste, but it's not a huge strike. Brown butter anything makes just about everything better. I think there was also a meyer lemon gremolata aspect to this course, but it didn't really come through.4th course:Frisee salad with smoked trout, capers, and sherry vinaigrette. The smoked trout, though sparse, was the highlight of this course. 5th course:Sunchoke ""veloute"" with crushed hazelnuts and (I think) coffee foam. While I wouldn't call this a veloute, it was definitely delicious (so much so that I promptly made sunchoke soup at home). The hazelnuts could have been toasted a bit longer and the foam didn't add much.6th course: Clam ""chowder"" with pureed potato and trout roe. A solitary clam, served in a half-shell, this was another great bite. The combination of potato and clam delivered that familar chowder flavor and the roe added a little snap and additional saltiness. The only negative, a few bits of shell.7th course:Sous vide pork belly with coconut-spiked quinoa and harissa. Pork belly is always welcome in my belly and this was no exception. The long cook had rendered most of the fat, leaving a very tasty bite. What little skin remained (if not skin, than perhaps the side it had been seared/finished on) was a little tough to cut through, but the taste reminded me (oddly) of popcorn. For me, the real star was the coconut quinoa.8th course:Braised short rib over smoked gouda polenta. Another meat that is near and dear to my heart (and stomach) and another tasty course. My partner raved about the polenta, but I felt the gouda didn't really come through. No love lost however, still delicious.9th course:Chocolate crumble with a whiskey caramel, chocolate-covered puffed rice, and smoked salt. This was pretty light, all things considered, and had deep chocolate flavor. The couple next to us were giddy with delight because they thought it smelled just like mini m&ms. I can neither confirm nor deny that claim.10th course:Vanilla-saffron panna cotta, with balsamic fig, blood orange, and pistachios. The biggest downfall here is that I love panna cotta and make it often, and, unfortunately, the texture on this one sort of fell short. I can't speak to the chef's technique, but it seemed a little too dense for my taste and a little rubbery. Maybe too much gelatin? Maybe eggs in the base? Not sure. At any rate, it was somewhere between a custard and a panna cotta. The flavors were good, but I don't think it needed the blood orange.Overall this place is a great addition to the neighborhood and probably the least expensive 10-course tasting menu in Brooklyn ($65), but don't go for the price alone. The experience was gracious and tangible without being pretentious. The chef introduced every course and beer pairing, and seemed genuinely excited to share a meal with us. I hope for their continued success.",4.0
"Previously I reviewed this coffee and lunch spot with a scathing review commenting on the terrible service and my servers ineptitude However, following a private response from him apologizing and assuring me that my lousy service was a result of a lack of staff and an off day for this server, I retracted my previous review and simply reviewed the food.Second time back and here is my understanding of this restaurant:They do not care.After being seated outside for brunch we were forgotten about, despite the garden area (with no plants or music or atmosphere and simply 4 brick walls it would be better described as a prison yard than a garden area) being full of guests. 20 minutes went by and I asked for water and menus. On the menu one of the brunch items, the breakfast sandwich, says in its description that it includes turkey but then offers the option at the end of either turkey or avocado. I asked our server about this and he informed me that choosing turkey simply meant more turkey. I chose the avocado since turkey was already included.My tables order was; one coffee; one latte; one Bellini; 2 breakfast sandwiches.15 minutes later we receive our drinks.30 more minutes and still no food, I go inside to ask about the food and a very lackadaisical female behind the counter shrugged at me. I asked her if she knew anything about where my 2 sandwiches were having been seated now for over an hour, she slumped into the chefs area and checked the tickets and then slumps back to me to tell me ""maybe 5 more minutes?.."".I go back to my seat and our sweet but hardly competent server offers us a round of drinks so I ask for another latte and my boyfriend asks for another Bellini. 10 minutes later the sandwiches come out, no turkey on either. I try to grab the servers attention from across the ""garden area"" and he calls ""yes?"" but doesn't approach me, so I'm left to yell across to him that not only was I waiting over an hour for a sandwich but there's no turkey. He tells me he will see what he can do. The complimentary drinks arrive, 2 black coffees. Wrong again.I send them both back and finally get my latte and a mimosa (at this stage there no point in sending back the mimosa for a Bellini because we're coming up on 2 hours).Once we are finished our sandwiches and are finished our drinks the server comes back with 2 slices of turkey on a brown takeout container.We pay and leave.Overall, consistently terrible service. No atmosphere. Rude staff and sloppy food.",1.0

The location is also perfect, right by train station. It is a breathe of fresh air for the area. I had an over all pleasant experience their and would highly recommend it.",5.0
"Rating it on the quality of the coffee here. One of the stars is for the employee who helped me, who was very nice.I got a cold brewed coffee here and it was absolutely disgusting. Not only was it sour, bitter, and over-concentrated, but it tasted like it had been sitting out for too long (which I believe it had, since it was decanted right from a big jug on the table and it was pretty late in the day). Refrigeration is a good thing, guys. It honestly surprised me, seeing the reviews on here; I could've gotten a better cold brewed coffee at Starbucks.",2.0
I fully support Industry! I love the vibe it's brought to my neighborhood. The food is great and sometimes they even have live entertainment. The brunch is the best and apps are awesome. I never had the dinner menu but I will soon.,5.0
Cortado was okay -- nothing memorable. But decent.Almond croissant was kinda dry and stale. Not very good at all.Service was okay -- nothing memorable. Small hole in the wall ambiance. I guess it's a nicer coffee shop in the hood. Shrug.,2.0
"Love this place! Came here when it first opened and I've been back a few times. Some of the coffee is a little pricey for Bushwick, but their breakfast sandwiches are so delicious and well-priced. The Bushwick breakfast is so yummy and filling! The almond croissant is really good too but a little much for me.  Definitely worth a visit. Conveniently located but the subway and super cute backyard for brunch or just hang and do work.",4.0
I recently enjoyed a ten course tasting menu crafted by chef John Creger. All of the dishes were thoughtfully chosen and executed then paired with interesting beer selections. The chef spoke briefly before serving each course. In the small dining room this leant a decidedly intimate and personal feel for the patrons. A top notch experience not to be missed!,5.0
Favorite coffee shop in the area thus far. The staff is super friendly and have somehow remembered my uber complicated morning fix. They have the cutest little outdoor garden too which I made my office for a few hours one day. I specifically like this place for their non dairy options and the Almond croissant .. Well mostly the almond croissant,5.0
"Came here based on the 4.5 stars and am really perplexed as to what is so special. Having just eaten my tiny little breakfast sandwich with no side salad or breakfast potatoes, I'm brainstorming where to go next to finish satisfying my hunger as there were no sides available (NOTE: Owner did inform me that they will have fries available next week). My date's savory French toast ""special"" was hardly such, with one hard boiled instead of the advertised soft, annoying when the eggs aren't cooked to spec. Our waiter was very nice though and did his best to accommodate the shortcomings of the kitchen.",3.0
"I want to like this place, but it's kind of a rip off. I went to get a Turkish coffee. Traditionally, you get a small espresso sized cup with a small pot, where you can have 2-3 small cups. They charged me $3 for just one small cup, which was half way filled with grounds. The employee I spoke to about it was very sweet, and asked the manager if she could give me another cup, but the manager refused, and wouldn't even come over to assess the situation. Like I said, I wanted to like this place, and their stuff is good, it's just way too over priced, and the manager wasn't helpful at all.",1.0
"So I stopped by the other day after months. The cafe looked like it had a new layout, it also looked like they had a new staff which was exciting. But of course the service was still average like before. I had an employee come up to me at 5:35 and tell me they're closed...not the best way communicate closing time which by the way was at 6pm...I want to like this place so bad but the mediocre drinks, over priced food and subpar service will not let me!",3.0

"Apple & Goat cheese salad & Thai chicken wrap was delicious & filling - actually much better than I'd expected based on the prices.

You know I'm there!This place is very cute and rustic inside, I'm in love with the decor.The owners are also extremely friendly and personable.We ordered a Turkish coffee, a regular coffee and the hummus pita.The hummus is homemade and thick and chunky (just how I like it).It just tasted so fresh and delicious, definitely try it.I was also pretty delighted that they served Turkish Coffee with a Turkish Delight.I feel like few places do that these days. It was really great though.The regular coffee was also pretty good.Quiet coffee shop, right next to the train station, you really can't go wrong.",5.0

"came in for an afternoon bite with friends and ordered the breakfast sandwich with avocado (though you have the option of turkey instead). it was delicious! the chipotle added a nice kick to the pesto/avocado taste. my friend really enjoyed her gluten free waffle with berries, though was missing butter for them (& it wasn't offered). service was fair, considering it doesn't seem there is a dedicated waitress, she didn't come to check on us, but we were ok with that. also tasted some bakery items including the butter crunch cookie (superb!) and the gluten free macaroon (so decadent!) not very visible on the street; seating is a bit tight, but it's got a fantastic play list. definitely coming back.",4.0

"Let me put this out there first and foremost: the food is delicious. Really, really good. I had an omelette with prosciutto and my friend had a lox bagel (which he never had before, but said was great). Aside from the quality of the food and the well-decorated interior, the overall experience was less than pleasant for me, unfortunately.$27 for an omelette, a lox bagel, and 2 iced coffees was gob-smackingly expensive, especially for this 'hood. That was a major turn-off. My food was also made incorrectly, which I give to the staff for having recognized it just before serving, but that caused a further 10-minute wait, after already waiting 5-10 mins and I was quite hungry to begin with. The service was alright- everyone was nice but not altogether pleasant or smiley. It should be noted we sat upfront which is counter service, and we weren't seated out back for table service. I can't speak to the level table service. The front section was decorated very well, but it is extremely small and no matter where you sit, you're probably next to the line that almost always stretches to the door, or very close to the table next to you. I had the unfortunate experience of sitting next to someone sniffling the whole time, which is certainly not the restaurant's fault at all, but their table was oh-so-very close..I would probably try this place again, but I'm keeping my expectations low.",3.0

Just moved to the neighborhood & stumbled upon this hidden gem on my walk from the laundromat. The staff greeted me as if I had been going there forever.

"Haven't written a review in 2 years but I'm moving away and wanted to say how much I love this place.

Plus they don't do the stingy thing a lot of NYC cafes do where they charge 50 cents for each add-on...I mean c'mon, there is no reason a bagel with some veggies and hummus should cost $7 at Little Skips (which has terrible coffee anyways). In response to bad reviews: FW has a really small staff, and sometimes things take awhile. They're also the type of place that would probably give you a new coffee if yours was burnt. The owner seems to appreciate cuisine-related feedback, and their menu has solidified over the past 6 months. A large coffee is $2.50.

"The staff is very nice which enhances your brunch experience.  The coffee is amazing and the food is rad.  I usually just get a black-eye  and leave but for the best experience, I recommend ordering the avocado toast with an almond mocha!  They go together really well but like I said, everything in there is good so I'm giving a 5/5.",5.0

This place is awesome! The coffee is so good I stop in on my way to brunch because I'd rather have their coffee than anywhere else! This neighborhood really needed this cozy little shop. And now there is even a beautiful little backyard to sit in.The owner is very kind and friendly. He really cares about all his customers and clearly makes an effort to remember them. He always makes me feel welcome and like he is genuinely excited to see me. I went there this past weekend to have breakfast in the new backyard on my birthday and he gave me a pancake smothered in Nutella. It was AMAZING!!! Get one.Love the shop. Love the coffee. Love the food. Love the vibe.Thank you Fair Weather Bushwick for existing!,5.0
"Coffee was good, but definitely one of the ""hip"" shops in the area. Cute interior but I personally like to visit other coffee shops that are a little less expensive when I can. I still stop here when I need a coffee for the train or if I want to sit down and have a latte and read a bit. Everyone's nice and friendly, it's just overly hip and because of the price jumps from around the area (I can get the same breakfast and Coffee for $2.50 less a few blocks away) they get 3 stars instead of 4.",3.0

"This place is a great addition to the neighborhood! I always get the soy chai with a shot of espresso. The owner usually asks what kind of milk and has all kinds on hand (almond, soy, skim, etc.) It's definitely worth the extra walk past the Dunkin Donuts to stop in here, unless you are in a rush. When there is a line it usually takes a  little while for them to get everyone's order so you might end up waiting a bit.  The owner is friendly and can be a little awkward  but he makes an effort to talk to the customers and really wants everyone to enjoy the food & drink. I haven't ordered any of the sandwiches yet, but from time to time I do indulge in their almond croissants, which are sprinkled lightly in powered sugar and super yummy. I haven't been able to find another place like this around the Myrtle-Wyckoff  stop, so it's been a great addition.",4.0

"Totally my kinda place! The Fair Weather Sandwich and the Avocado Toast (with egg!!!) are to fucking die for. The owner is a little awkward at times, but always welcoming and nice. If you don't like the music he's playing, he'll gladly let you commandeer the Pandora.Highlight reel: came back twice in the same day to get the aforementioned sandwiches, but they were out of the bread they usually use, so they subbed with the last of their sourdough. I wound up enjoying mine (though the other half was more picky), but before I took the sandwiches home, the owner not only took $2 off of each sandwich (with a money back guarantee attached)...but he also gave me a free dessert. That's a man who knows how to move product in the most graceful way possible. Another time, the owner wasn't there but his cook was. The kitchen was already closed for 30 minutes, but this guy did me a solid - made me two BANGIN' sandwiches with a *smile on his face.*The only catch? This place is t-i-n-y. :'(",5.0

I'm ecstatic that I no longer have to settle for lackluster coffee from the Dunkin Donuts across the way, or hike up to Wyckoff Starr just for decent coffee and pastries.

"Excellent new cafe in a stretch of Bushwick that's needed one for some time. Cozy interior, friendly staff, and the tuna melt's deliciously loaded with green apples (try it, it just works).",5.0
Delicious coffee. Hipster atmosphere. Very nice owner. Cozy seats. The only good coffee shop if you live near Wyckoff subway station.,5.0
"Go there and support the first ""nice"" spot in the neighborhood.  I've lived in the area for a year and I've always wandering when the first nice coffee shop/ bar  will be open and here it is! Very exiting! Great news for the people of this area! Very nice and cosy, art on the walls and a really nice coffee! Go go go!",5.0
Welcome to the hood! Remember to ask for some Turkish coffee. Pretty sure you won't find it anywhere else around :),5.0
"I ADORE this place. The owner is super friendly and always up for a chat; the coffee is fantastic and the food is really good, too. I live around the corner and have for five years; the one thing I didn't like about my neighborhood was that there were no coffee shops in the area. Now there's this one and I could not be happier they're here. I plan to support them as much as possible so they stick around!",5.0
"Very friendly barista. They have Brooklyn roasting company coffee, cool siting area and they accept credit cards.",5.0
"Great addition to Myrtle Wyckoff area.  Good coffee from Brooklyn Roasting Company - $2.45 for a large.  Delicious food (bagel and cream cheese - $2.50).  The sandwiches are also great, homemade pesto is delicious.  Free Wi-Fi, seating for about 12 people.  I think there might be a backyard in the summer.  Bonus is the owner is a super nice dude!  Please support this place!",5.0
