"Started writing this when they opened lol.  But they have have Beer and wine now...so yay.  This place is legit and I have brought a few people here.  Food has been impressive every time.  I don't think it's overpriced and it always puts me in the mood for a good pork chop.The staff is extremely friendly and I actually didn't know that they had brunch.  But I made it just in time to enjoy a few drinks and an additional on the house, because we came late.  Thank you - please keep it up and love the decor!!TIP - Great for a low key date night or just a night with friends. :)",5.0
"Brunch on Saturday and Sunday's is a must for the unlimited mimosas or bloody Mary's. The brunch food is also amazing, you must try the French toast. Also the cocktails are amazing the Mango daiquiri and the piña colada are a must have!",5.0

"This place immediately caught my eye while driving down Bushwick Ave, so I had to come try it out. You can say Salud is located on the ""outskirts"" of Bushwick - but it's actually IN Bushwick - just not located in the center of your usual hipster 'hood. But don't fret hipsters - the J and L are just 2 blocks away and your trusty Uber driver can get you there in no time. Don't drive - there's never parking, unless you're magically lucky. But now that they have their liquor license - you shouldn't be driving anyway.First impression was how beautiful the loft style floor to ceiling windows were adorning the front of this place. There's a huge patio right in front and I can imagine how poppin' this place will be during the summer. Once you walk in you'll feel like you're in an industrial cabin house. Every crevice of this place is covered in reclaimed wood - all pieces put together by hand, might I add! There's a huge projector TV on the [customary] brick walls, which makes this place perfect for footballs games and fight nights. (I'm going this Superbowl Sunday!) Every where you look here, you'll find something cool and interesting. Make it a game with your dinner date and see who finds all the unique features. The bathroom has a sliding barn door (which I've always loved and would absolutely have one in my home) and the ""vanity"" lights are actual Heineken bottles with light bulbs in them. The bathroom wall is adorned with a mosaic pattern made of... BEER BOTTLE CAPS. With their logo embedded in, of course. Whoever designed this place really went in with the details and my artist eye caught all of them.LET'S TALK ABOUT FOOD, BABY.The menu is limited but it is their soft opening menu and they have a quality selection. We tried the chimmi sliders, filipino adobo wings, yuca fries, the chop, and the skirt steak. Their sangria was super strong and so delicious and my boyfriend enjoyed a few of their drafts from their growing beer selection. The chimi was so damn good, my fave dish altogether. Just the smell of the mini Dominican burger made me crave more. This is the gourmet version of the ones in the truck and it was awesome. The wings were the BOMB DOT COM. They have like 5 different flavors and I'll be sure to try all of them. It's a small serving of 4 wings but it's only $5! The yuca fries, paired with that minced garlic dipping sauce - OMG. The chop is huge and while the basmati coconut rice was OK, the pork chop was nicely seasoned. The skirt steak was a little overcooked but again great flavor. You can tell the chef has a distinct flavor palette because the seasoning on these bad boys was on point.The restaurant is run by a Dominican family who are Brooklyn locals and you can catch them here working hard and chilling with patrons. It's really a chill spot and great addition to the neighborhood.",5.0

"A few weeks ago, on a Tuesday night (I think) me and my boyfriend were looking for a bite to eat and came across this place. It was really warm and cozy. We were greeted immediately by the owner, June, who was very hospitable. They didn't have their liquor license, yet, since they just opened up. We were fine with that since we were more hungry than anything, lol! The interior gave the place a relaxing and chill vibe. It looked like recycled woodwork, which was nice. After carefully deciding, we went for the chimis and mango kale salad. To our pleasant surprise, they were DELICIOUS! The salad was refreshing and fresh-tasting. The chimi sliders were nice and moist. June really chose the perfect buns. I asked for hot sauce and he surprised me with his homemade hot sauce. Oh man was that good, too. I would buy a bottle if he were to ever sell it. Anyway, indefinitely recommend this place! I had a very good first impression.",5.0
"Good food, affordable and good service just 5 min away from home, what else can I ask for? I ordered the Philippines style wings that the owner recommended me, it came with a ginger, soy sauce and vinegar sauce to dip, so tasty! Loved the wings. I also ordered the pork chop with Indian spices that comes with basmati rice and salad. I don't really like Indian food but I loved this dish, it doesn't have a strong Indian spices flavor so it's just perfect for me. Everything on the menu sound so good so I am definitely coming back to try more dishes!",5.0
"So great to have a bar and grill 5 minute walking distance from my house! Just wish they would hurry up and get a liquor license so they could actually be a BAR!Anywho, the food and service at Salud is delicious! I had the yuka fries as an appetizer and the chicken paillard as an entree. I truly enjoyed both.Our server, who I believe was also the manager/owner was awesome! He provided suggestions and was very attentive.I can't wait to visit again and try other items on the menu!",5.0
"Brunch was fabulous!!!!I was so impressed! Thank you thank you! Junior and Salud staff were beyond superb!!! They were incredible, friendly, professional and on the ball!

"Had a pleasant meal but it's a bit overpriced for what it is.A $14 burger is common in other parts of the city but seems misplaced here. Don't get me wrong, the food was decent and the cocktails were delicious, but I'll most likely be returning for a few drinks at the bar rather than ordering the overpriced food.Other than that, the service was great and they have a nice beer selection.",3.0

Junior, the owner, is always amongst his staff, helping take orders, bringing food to customers, and checking to make sure everyone is content. Whether you're having a beer at the bar to wind down after work or you're with a group of friends just catching up, you will always experience great food complimented with delicious wines or beers.

Great spot right on Bushwick n Moffat. Good food and nice selection of beer n wine at the bar. The modern industrial look of the place takes it to another level for Bushwick. Pleasant service.,5.0
"Okay, this place is the only spot on the neighborhood, so I can see why there are so many 4 star reviews on here, but you have to take a step back and not let the excitement cloud your judgment. For one, the decor is really cool, I liked the fact that there where a few outlets under the bar so you could charge your phone, and the fact that the high tables had ample hooks on the tables for you to hang your stuff. The chairs where cool and the owner guys said he made them all unique by hand himself, I found that interesting. The overall atmosphere was chill and had a nice neighborhood vibe that I liked, but towards the end the literal atmosphere was unbearable. The kitchen was so close to our table and had an open window that the smoke from the grill started burning my eyes and the some sort of pepper/spice was floating around in the air and felt like someone sprayed mace. Also we asked if we could order more food and the waitress said that the kitchen was closed. But people where coming in and getting food still!! Wtf. The food was mediocre, we got a few apps because I wasn't trying to get an $14 burger. The carnitas tacos where good (can't really go wrong with that though), was had the chicken wings with the orange sauce, the meat was a little overcooked and the sauce was bland. Then we had the empanadas (not the kind I like was supposed to have meat in them but was mostly mashed potato) and yucca Fries which where cold and way to dense. The staff was very friendly, and I know this place is just starting out and still trying things but they have a far way to go with the cuisine. I think I will try and go here again in the summer to see if they improve, after all it's just three blocks away from my apt.",3.0
"This place recently opened its doors toward the end of 2015 and it has been gathering a loyal clientele (myself included) ever since. June, the owner, has done a wonderful job of showcasing local reclaimed wood as the restaurant's decor. Though the menu is not extensive, what they prepare is fresh, tasty and affordable. Be sure to try out Salud's home-made hot sauce. I cannot wait until they have enough to sell some to customers. Having recently added numerous beers, and a cider, on tap, this place is on the right path to be a favorite local spot for years to come. Salud!",5.0

"We recently checked out Salud and it was fabulous!The owner, June, is extremely friendly and gracious.  He made sure that we got exactly what we wanted and were enjoying ourselves. The food was fabulous - I don't think I've had a skirt steak cooked so well. The Salmon was delicious as well.  The salad that comes with both was lemony but delectable. And I personally enjoyed the plantains over the yucca fries, although both were very good with the house made garlic dipping sauce.What I really like about this place is that June makes his own hot sauce! He has three versions, mild, medium, and hot! As a fan of spicy food I loved them. Definitely ask for some when you are there. The only downside for some people is that they are beer and wine only (so far) no liquor.But it's still a great fun place to watch games and meet new people (they have a GIANT TV and even bigger projector screen.I will definitely be a frequent visitor!",5.0

"A group of us came here for dinner last night and the experience was definitely worth the long train ride.  This place is very rustic and has lots of character. If you're into details like me, then you will appreciate the thought behind the decor, everything here appears to be made from some repurposed or recycled materials. I was specially excited about the very cool bathroom and the use of beer bottles for the light fixtures. This place has only been open for a short time but they seem to have an amazing team led by the very friendly and gracious owner June who made us feel very welcomed. He was great at answering all of my questions about the decor and it was evident that he put great thought and effort into his place.  Besides the great ambiance and friendly staff what truly made this place worthy of 5 stars was the amazing food! I had the chimichurri and yucca fries as my appetizer. I was so impressed by the flavor and quality of ingredients in the chimichurri, the meat was delicious along with the soft brioche bread. The yuca fries were cut a bit too thick for my preference but they were still good and came with a garlic mojo sauce. For my entree I had the salmon with the side salad and plantains. The salmon was cooked and seasoned perfectly! The side salad was great,  the greens were fresh with radishes and grape tomatoes, I'm not sure what type of dressing was used but it complimented the salmon really well. I'm super picky about my plantains and these were Dominican approved in my book!. I tried my friend's churrasco and it was really good! Honestly, all of the food was delicious! The prices here are very affordable and they had a great happy hour special! If this place wasn't so far I would probably be here every week. Looking forward to my next visit!",5.0

"Really wish I could leave a review about the food here but unfortunately they wouldn't give us any. Drinks either for that matter. Why? Fuck if I know they wouldn't even acknowledge we were there. After walking in behind another couple and sitting down at a table and being ignored we decided to move to the bar for maybe some better service in the already slow but grossly over staffed establishment. After offering the guy next to us another drink which wasn't even empty and taking the couples food order at the other end of the bar after serving them drinks I tried several times to get their attention. But nah apparently we weren't even there. After about 15 min of this we gave up and and went someplace else. But to be perfectly honest I mean $14 for a burger? Sure I can see paying that at an established place in Williamsburg (where I live *gives the shade eye to the plebes living past the Lorimer stop*) or East Village but this place is off BUSHWICK ABERDEEN! I've lived in NYC 13 years and have not been that deep EVER unless I'm going to JFK or the beach. If you must know I was just there visiting a friend who just moved to that area and didn't know any better after having lived in Hoboken, don't even get me started on that.  Now if you're broke and have to live all the fucking way out there in some shithole that's totally fine but please spare me the shit about how you pay the same rent as me but have a bigger apt and back yard. This is NYC and it's all about location. You want cheap rent and a back yard then move to fucking Iowa. But if you're living off the Bushwick Aberdeen stop you have no business spending $14 on a burger and if you do and can't afford to live in a better neighborhood you really need to rethink your life's priorities. * side note - the genius designer of this place who I'm sure spearheaded the mega original idea of outfitting the joint in reclaimed wood which I've never seen before  :/ and is sure to give someone a nasty splinter also thought it would be novel to make the signage out of a flat piece of steel. The sign which is placed parallel to the street features a cut out of the name but did this idiot not realize that coming from the other direction it's backwards and illegible?",1.0

"Meh, I can't say this place is special enough to warrant a return. It strategic placement would be why I say it is a decent place. I couldn't give it less than three for that simple reason. Salud had a decent beer selection at a decent price, I would return for that. The ambiance is great [bar seating, table seating, projection screen] the place is intimate enough, prices are OK, but I feel the portions are too small. The carnitas were good enough, the empanadas were potatoes and beans, although we ordered pork. The orange wings were meeeeeeeeeeeeh. I couldn't help but notice how skimpy the bar was. My lady got the pain eraser, which was good enough, but sweet like a mug- I was cool with a brew.My visit ended on a 'I would visit again, but I would definitely go somewhere else if there were anywhere else in walking distance' vibe, but hey, maybe it was a bad day. I'd be open to go again, if someone else is paying. 3 stars.",3.0

"I was super excited to try this place out I always pass by it , and the overall energy of the place looks enticing. We came in at about 7 pm with our son. The group ahead of us got seated right away and we waited a while to be seated. No problem it was quite busy. After a while my fiancée asked the server if we seat ourselves or if she seats us. It felt like she was intentionally ignoring us and stated let me check if those seats are reserved and came back stating they weren't and sat us. However , minus that weird situation our waiter was so sweet and went over the menu with us and was so nice to our son. We had the sliders , BBQ wings, and yuca fries for appetizers. We had a few drinks and for entrees has the skirt steak and cheese burger. Both were delish. For dessert we had the coffee flan and two of the regular flans I was very pleased with that. I loved that everyone made an conscious effort to be so nice to us , and regardless of my first initial feeling I let it slide and I'm happy I did. I had a great time !",4.0
"Great new addition to the neighborhood! Nice, concise menu. Tasty sangria and good beer selection. All a bit overcooked- but that is an easy fix- we had the papitas, taquitas, wings, carnitas, skirt steak, saiud burger and sliders and ended with flan.

"This place was incredible!  I ate here with my co-workers about a month ago when they had first opened.  They did not have a liquor license yet, but they allowed us to BYOB (which we did).  We arrived before 4, so they weren't open yet.  With a little persuasion, the gentleman working there allowed us to hang out and have some drinks while we waited for the kitchen to open.  The atmosphere is great.  The decor is very rustic and clean.  When the kitchen opened we ordered.  The menu is a bit small, but we enjoyed everything we ordered.  We had theDuas Empanaditas,  Chimichurri Dominicano Sliders, and I think the Platanitos fritos.  Everything was fresh and delicious.  The service was also on point.  It is great to see this area of Bushwick have new life breathed into it.  I hope this place opens for lunch so that we can go more often!",5.0
"Excellent food, service, and ambience, at Salud Bar & Grill! The owner, June, and our server, Cynthia, were absolutely accommodating and amazing! Salud is an amazing, excellent choice, and I promise you won't be disappointed!",5.0
"Really wish I could leave a review about the food here but unfortunately they wouldn't give us any. Drinks either for that matter. Why? Fuck if I know they wouldn't even acknowledge we were there. After walking in behind another couple and sitting down at a table and being ignored we decided to move to the bar for maybe some better service in the already slow but grossly over staffed establishment. After offering the guy next to us another drink which wasn't even empty and taking the couples food order at the other end of the bar after serving them drinks I tried several times to get their attention. But nah apparently we weren't even there. After about 15 min of this we gave up and and went someplace else. But to be perfectly honest I mean $14 for a burger? Sure I can see paying that at an established place in Williamsburg (where I live *gives the shade eye to the plebes living past the Lorimer stop*) or East Village but this place is off BUSHWICK ABERDEEN! I've lived in NYC 13 years and have not been that deep EVER unless I'm going to JFK or the beach. If you must know I was just there visiting a friend who just moved to that area and didn't know any better after having lived in Hoboken, don't even get me started on that.  Now if you're broke and have to live all the fucking way out there in some shithole that's totally fine but please spare me the shit about how you pay the same rent as me but have a bigger apt and back yard. This is NYC and it's all about location. You want cheap rent and a back yard then move to fucking Iowa. But if you're living off the Bushwick Aberdeen stop you have no business spending $14 on a burger and if you do and can't afford to live in a better neighborhood you really need to rethink your life's priorities. * side note - the genius designer of this place who I'm sure spearheaded the mega original idea of outfitting the joint in reclaimed wood which I've never seen before  :/ and is sure to give someone a nasty splinter also thought it would be novel to make the signage out of a flat piece of steel. The sign which is placed parallel to the street features a cut out of the name but did this idiot not realize that coming from the other direction it's backwards and illegible?",1.0
"Salud Bar & Grill has a great vibe - great music, lighting. The staff is extremely friendly. Make sure you get the ""Salud"" 8 ounce burger...it  was incredibly tasty. order it with a side of ""Yuca Frita"" to complement the perfect blend of a great American Burger with a touch of Latino Magic. I can't wait to go back!",5.0
"Meh, I can't say this place is special enough to warrant a return. It strategic placement would be why I say it is a decent place. I couldn't give it less than three for that simple reason. Salud had a decent beer selection at a decent price, I would return for that. The ambiance is great [bar seating, table seating, projection screen] the place is intimate enough, prices are OK, but I feel the portions are too small. The carnitas were good enough, the empanadas were potatoes and beans, although we ordered pork. The orange wings were meeeeeeeeeeeeh. I couldn't help but notice how skimpy the bar was. My lady got the pain eraser, which was good enough, but sweet like a mug- I was cool with a brew.My visit ended on a 'I would visit again, but I would definitely go somewhere else if there were anywhere else in walking distance' vibe, but hey, maybe it was a bad day. I'd be open to go again, if someone else is paying. 3 stars.",3.0
"So I live right around the corner from this place. Not only is it one of the only places to go, but it is FANTASTIC! I came here for the Super Bowl, won the wing challenge and now the ""Tom"" wings are in the menu. Brunch is fantastic as well. Bottomless Mimosas and Beet Bloody Mary's for $8!!! I rolled with a group and the owner gave us pitchers of mimosas. The food is incredible, drinks are awesome and the atmosphere is perfect. If you're in the area, you MUST try this place out. I cannot wait for the summer and their patio to be open.",5.0
"This is a great place, I loved the food and the staff was awesome... You definitely need to try the steak with yuca fries!! This is my new spot in bushwick!!!!",5.0
"I was super excited to try this place out I always pass by it , and the overall energy of the place looks enticing. We came in at about 7 pm with our son. The group ahead of us got seated right away and we waited a while to be seated. No problem it was quite busy. After a while my fiancée asked the server if we seat ourselves or if she seats us. It felt like she was intentionally ignoring us and stated let me check if those seats are reserved and came back stating they weren't and sat us. However , minus that weird situation our waiter was so sweet and went over the menu with us and was so nice to our son. We had the sliders , BBQ wings, and yuca fries for appetizers. We had a few drinks and for entrees has the skirt steak and cheese burger. Both were delish. For dessert we had the coffee flan and two of the regular flans I was very pleased with that. I loved that everyone made an conscious effort to be so nice to us , and regardless of my first initial feeling I let it slide and I'm happy I did. I had a great time !",4.0
"Great new addition to the neighborhood! Nice, concise menu. Tasty sangria and good beer selection. All a bit overcooked- but that is an easy fix- we had the papitas, taquitas, wings, carnitas, skirt steak, saiud burger and sliders and ended with flan. Owner/manager with open to cooking suggestions and was appreciative! Great decor- industrial vibe with recycled materials creating a funky look throughout!.",4.0
"I LOVE the food here. The burger is my favorite. My only problem is that the three times I've been, the service has been incredibly slow. I'm not an impatient patron, but the restaurant was not busy and well-staffed so there was no excuse for poor service. (Last time I went our server was on her phone at the bar the whole time. SMH.)But living in the area there aren't many options and like I said, the food: incredible. I do recommend it. I'm really only leaving this review in the hopes that the owner sees it and whips her employees into shape because that was all that was lacking in the overall great experiences I've had at Salud.",4.0
"Great atmosphere and decor. Had 2 beers and 2 appetizers for happy hour, bill came to $17!!!!!! Food was good, service was pleasant and attentive. Only down side no hard liquor, just beer and wine. Will be back.",5.0
"Food was delicious,ambience and decor are really cool and laid back. Exceptional service, very friendly and attentive.

Cannot wait to come back to try more dishes.",5.0
"I was excited that a place like this opened in the neighborhood. The drinks are good.The food is really good, but I absolutely cannot tolerate bad service.The last 3 times I went, no matter what I ordered, no matter how many people were in the place, the food took forever. Each of those three times, the server had to check what the deal was, come back and assure me the food was on its way. I overlooked this because the staff was friendly, the place was new and they slid me a free drink from time to time. Tonight being the 4th visit in a row of slow food service, I offered the waitress some constructive criticism, to which she responded ""I'll keep that in mind."" I guess the owner's ENTIRE extended family was in the place tonight; they were waited on hand and foot while I had to yell across the bar to remind them I was sitting there. On top of that there was a little kid running behind the bar,his mother (a civilian) running back to grab him, one of the owners standing back there having a coughing fit for 5 minutes straight - it was complete amateur hour. Hire some wait staff with experience and let us know ahead of time if you're going to pack the place with your family / friends and ignore paying customers.",1.0
"Only on my second visit presently but I have to say this place completely rules. They have the best beer selection in the area, which is huge to me as a self-proclaimed beer connoisseur. What's more, the place is beautiful. The decor is so on point I can hardly get over it. Last but certainly not least, the service is impeccable. I met Jessie on my first visit and she greeted me at this second one as if we were old friends and then June helped us find exactly which beer we were looking for. Full disclosure, I've yet to try their food but I can guarantee it smells fantastic. If you're in Bushwick Ave area, definitely stop by!",5.0
"Exactly what this neighborhood needs! I stopped here on a whim this afternoon and am so glad I did.  Apparently they just opened a few weeks ago so I was very impressed with both the service and the food for a brand new restaurant.  The atmosphere is warm and inviting with lots of wood and soft lighting.  I ordered the skirt steak with plantains and it was delicious! Very tender and marinated in a very flavorful combination of spices.  Add the house made hot sauce, simply awesome.  The steak was cooked really well and was very reasonably priced for such a high quality meal and great portion size.The staff was very friendly and attentive, and I was very excited to hear that they are from Bushwick and this is a family operation.  For dessert they recommended the bread pudding which was SO FREAKING GOOD and I was told after its their mom's recipe which made it even better!  I will be coming back :)",5.0
Driving by I noticed the large glass front and wanted see what was up. The place has a great vibe when you enter. You are immediately greeted by very friendly staff and as I stated there is a large glass front so you can people watch while waiting for your food or drink. The music is a diverse variety of different musical mixes that satisfy many tastes and creates a great atmosphere to come in relax and unwind. The staff is super friendly and very helpful in making suggestions on the many dishes they serve. The empanadas and skirt steak were done perfectly and my wife was a big fan of the kale salad.The beer selection is made up of the finest of the local craft brewers as well as standard domestics and imports. The wine and cocktails they serve are on point.I can't wait to return in the warmer months to try the outside sitting area and sample more food and drink from my new favorite place SALUD!!!,5.0
