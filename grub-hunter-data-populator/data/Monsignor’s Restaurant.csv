"Monsignor never fails...their food is ALWAYS delicious!!! We have nothing but geniune compliments for Rafael, owner and chef. Excellent food, atmosphere  and staff. Always a pleasure.",5.0
"The owner or manager ""Rafael"" didn't take responsibility for the bad customer service. We ordered a dish that includes two slices of fish and it doesn't includes shrimp. I am allergic to shrimp and got a reaction to it and that made a bad experience.Don't recommend at all if you are looking to eat here, no Mexican nor Italian taste. To be honest the waitress that looks Latina was the only person of respect in the that place. Don't waste your time and money look for better place around the area. Enjoy!",1.0
"DISAPPOINTMENT. Never coming back to this restaurant again, and I do not recommend it. Here are the reasons why. In short, food was mediocre, service was slow, 2 of our entrees were inconsistent and the owner was extremely rude to us. If you want the full story. Please read on, I think you want to know. My friends and I came here for my cousins birthday (party of 15) on A Friday. It took an hour to get our appetizers, we ordered calamari ( nothing special) and the stuffed mushrooms (I don't even know what they were stuffed with because I saw no filling, there was a sprinkle of something on the top which I think we're like bread crumbs and on top of that it was bland ). Our entrees took another 30 mins to get there after we were done with our appetizers. We ordered around 8:15pm and our entrees got to us at 9:58pm. What!? WAIT. THERES MORE. I personally ordered the sea bass and another friend of mines too.  They accidentally brought out the table next to ours' order of sea bass, okay no biggie. She took it back and I guess gave it to the right table. BUT, when We got our order, we noticed our plates were different than what they gave the other table. We only got one very small filet of fish and all of a sudden there was a piece of shrimp on top ( my friend was actually allergic to shrimp). So because we were there for almost an hour and a half already we just gulfed the food down because we were starving. The sea bass skin was soggy, the fish itself was bland and it came with 4 small pieces of potatoes and some green beans. Not worth my $18. So we went on Yelp to see if the entree we got was consistent to what is showed on Yelp, and turns out we were right. They totally changed our plate, so we went to talk to the manager, which by the way they didn't have one. So we spoke to the chef (Rafael) which later we found out he was the owner. He was completely stubborn when we addressed the situation with our entrees and he didn't even acknowledge the fact that what they did was not right, how do they give the table next to us to right portion of the dish , but we get half? All he said, as his explanation, was he decided to change the course. Wth? From the 20 mins when the other table go their food, he all of a sudden changed ours ? And why would you do that without first letting your customer know, he could've killed one of us because he was allergic to shrimp. He did not offer us any solution to our complaint and basically told us to f* off. Finally after rounds of discussion with him (I.e we said we would report this) he then finally agreed to take 1 dish off the check. This all took about 20 mins. We really didn't care for the cost, what bothered us the most is that he was trying to fool and deceive us. But I will say the servers were nice.",1.0
"The biggest Yelp disappointment/fail. I took a cab here just for dinner based on the stellar reviews and it was just a complete disappointment.  The positive thing is that they have a cute ambience and heated lights in the rear outdoor area.The food was terrible, basically inedible. The clams were very fishy and chewy. I had to spit it out. The famous garlic mozz bread was a joke. Basically as if an 8 year old put some garlic, marinara sauce and cheese on cheap corner store bread.  The chicken marsala was terrible, nothing like any chicken marsala Ive ever had. Finally, the recommended seafood pasta was also a fail: tasted like fish sauce was poured over the pasta.All the wine is $20. The cork is rubber and the quality as you can guess was very low.The service was awkward. The lady was being very friendly but a bit too sarcastic.  She could also use a mint (sorry)I guess people come here because everything is very cheap (under $13 for most entrees) and the ambience is pleasant. Save your time and money if you care about the food you are ingesting.  This was by far one of the worst restaurants Ive ever had. There are so many  good restaurants in the area!",1.0
"Well don't come to this area too often but when I do. I always come here, love the place. The staff here is great and very attentive. Foods always amazing I usually have the sausage and peppers and love to sit in the back patio. Would certainly recommend it for lunch or dinner.",5.0
"The copious 5 star reviews must be a joke. In addition to the stale smell when you walk in, the food here is just bad. I went with tried and true and got the meatballs with penne. The sauce had no flavor and the meat tasted rancid. Even my husband, who will eat anything, said he couldn't stomach them. He liked his chicken parm but it's kind of hard to screw up a cutlet with cheese. Overall we were excited about trying this neighborhood spot but we won't be back. For good, reasonable Italian hit up Piccoli or Nostro instead!",1.0
"I only wish I found this hidden gem earlier! The patio is fantastic and great for a date. The owner was also super friendly and made us feel right at home. Complementary garlic bread- Fresh, soft on the inside and crispy on the outside.Sangria- Refreshing. The owner even stopped by and gave me a complementary refill! Arugula Salad- As recommended by the owner, this was delicious! The portobello mushrooms were cooked to perfection and the arugula was very fresh.Seafood Pasta- This dish was definitely tasty and well worth what you pay. The pasta was great. They don't skimp out on the seafood at all!Hanger Steak- The steak was delicious. I especially loved the side of potatoes!Cheesecake- Soft, fluffy and a great ending to an amazing meal. The service, atmosphere, and food was perfect. I cannot wait to come back!",5.0
"A great place to eat at. Affordable and the food was delicious :) Im always very picky when it comes to steak, i've ordered the steak with the garlic sauce and it is a great combination and they always cook it the way I love it :) Ive been here with my friends and we are always treat greatly. I recommend you to go and see for yourself why they earned that 5 stars.",5.0
"If there is one thing I love it's Italian food. Let me just start by saying that the atmosphere here is perfect for a date night. This place has the best ""Fried Calamari"" I've ever had! I enjoyed every bite with its chipotle mayo on the side. The service was great, everyone was respectful and kind. Everything came out on time! I absolutely adore this restaurant with an outside patio. Definitely coming back to enjoy their tasteful food! Make sure to try out their fried ice cream for dessert! You won't regret it.",5.0
"Was here in the dead of Winter last year, and if I loved it then, I love it even more with a grape arbor and comfy outdoor space.  You could easily have a fun time here with a party of say 6 people +.   (during the Summer months)The 7.95 lunch special is still rocking, and today I had the fried fish, with avocado salad.Just really great.  The people here are simply the nicest people in the world.The lady who does most of the table service here, reminds one of a kind Motherly type, who is soft spoken, and always un-rushed.  The chef is also soft spoken and easy to talk to, if you pop up at the small bar for a glass of wine and lunch.The food today was really a nice piece of white fish, fried to perfection, not greasy, on a bed of lettuce with ample avocado and tomatoes. Lovely garlic bread, rounds it out nicely.  Any of the Italian dishes are great staples too.I'm so glad I picked this place today.  Ample bike racks along the block, but a lot of delivery bikes, so, you might get lucky.  Overall a nice place that is in striking distance of several neighborhoods.",5.0
"Monsignor's customer is always right policy went out the door.  Went to this place on a Friday night, a group of 15 ppl. The only big group in the restaurant that night, the place was empty only 3 tables taken. so you wouldn't think anything would go wrong right!? Well it did! First of all it took about 2 hours to get our dinner and this is including the appetizers which came like 10mnts before. But before the appetizers came, there was a mistaken plate delivered to our table that was meant to be for a different table, a plate that 2 of my ppl had order as well. To be specific it was the seabass dish, if you can see the pictures other yelpers have posted they all look the same. Same presentation, same size portion, nothing new, nothing changed. We received that same dish but instead with half of a filet, topped with a shrimp. The owner/chef must of think we were a bunch of fools because he said he was the chef and he rearrange dish presentations as he liked. Really? So everyone else gets a whole big portion that same night, but for some reason in matter of minutes he decided to change the menu for us? Not even taking in consideration that 2 of those customers were allergic to shrimp and without asking that small detail he still put a ""complimentary"" shrimp on top!!? What was so complimentary about it? The fact that he did not completed the dish? Or the fact that he thought his customers would be stupid enough to be fooled by a shrimp? But the worst part is, he did not accept his mistake, I mean you would think as an owner of a restaurant, you would want to ammend your mistake make your customers happy and deal with it so that maybe they come back again! Instead of having them leave unhappy and make them sit here writing a review like this one, right?

"Came here on Saturday 6/27 when it was pouring out. The owner greeted my boyfriend and I at the door asking if we wanted to eat food ""made with love"" - of course we do !!!! - chose to sit in the patio & we instantly fell in love. The patio setting is absolutely beautiful !! Light music playing, a candle with rose pedals around it on every table, & the sound of the rain falling - so romantic. I felt like we were eating dinner in the rainforest.Ok ok the food !!! Started with the baked clams. Nothing special but still delicious. For the main dish I had seafood pasta & my boyfriend had the eggplant parmigiana. Seafood pasta was perfect !!!! Not cheap with the seafood & the sauce is so delicious. & the eggplant parm omggg - comes with a little pasta in their marinara sauce. I do not like marinara sauce it doesn't sit well with my stomach - but THISSSSS sauce . Soo delicious so fresh you can tell its homemade. Just do yourself a favor & get it you will not be disappointed. Service, setting, food, & the pinot Grigio - i highly recommend this restaurant.

"A much needed date night with the husband! Came here for dinner after a Paint Nite event about half a mile away. It was a quiet night, we were the only ones there and felt quite romantic sitting in the garden with pretty lights and under a real grape vine tree.I did research on Yelp at the table, figured that I really wanna try the Land and Sea but they don't have it on their menu anymore....the waitress was very kind and had the kitchen to make it just for us!

Soooo soo good, steak cooked perfectly medium rare, and the sea part comes in with the stuffed avocado, stuffed with huge pieces of shrimp, calamari and bacon, a mushroom type sauce is then poured on top of both the steak and avocado. I did in fact pick off Derek's plate to try his dish, not only to try of couse, but to know how to write about it, here! Stripe bass was seasoned and cooked well, only part was the fish skin got soggy by the time it got to the table. The fish was swimming on top of a spinach salad and a tomato sauce. Moving on to dessert, fried ice cream was entertaining, watching it catch on fire and all, then the decorating, and finally ready to eat! They use vanilla ice cream in case you guys wanted to know.

The clams were so chewy that I had to spit it out. The stuffed mushrooms were ok, but not great. The chicken franchaise was ok. The linguine bolognese was terrible. The beef was very low quality and the sauce did not taste appropriate. It was the first time we left without finishing our meals. We left unsatisfied and confused with all the previous reviews.",2.0
"This place was awesome.  I didn't have high expectations because it was somewhat empty on a Friday night, but the food was great and service was too. Linguine with clams really good.  Good prices too.",5.0
"**update: these guys now cook my pasta perfectly and it has become my favorite neighborhood spot. Five stars! YUM!!!We've had two nice meals here. The patio is quiet and peaceful - service very pleasant and attentive. Great prices, especially with check-in. The food is solid, fresh, at times creative. My one complaint is that both times I've ordered pasta, it has been over cooked - for me, the whole experience of eating a delicious bowl of pasta is severely impaired when it's not al dente. Please take your pasta out a little earlier - the dishes would be near perfection!",5.0
Is this place Italian or Spanish? I've been there twice and still can't figure it out. We've tried everything from fried calamari to eggplant parm to rigatoni Bolognese. Everything is poorly made with zero flavor. The staff is Spanish (which is totally fine) but they barely speak English and do not provide any insight into the menu as one would normally expect at an Italian restaurant. Definitely won't be going back.,1.0
"Really really really good food at a great price. You would not expect to get the quality of food they put out for the reasonable prices they charge. The linguini shrimp Alfredo was delish though the shrimp was slightly overcooked, still, the flavor was on point. Sea bass was cooked perfectly. Oh and they make a and slamming mohito. Got some really good free garlic bread too which made up for the shrimp. Great service on top of everything. All in all, I really recommend the place.",5.0
"After finding this place through yelp, I've been here four times over the past few months. The food and service are always excellent. Everyone is so friendly and the atmosphere is so cozy and romantic. We even had the opportunity to see a marriage proposal one of the times that we were here. They also have a very diverse menu and another thing that I can't seem to get over is how reasonably priced their menu is. I highly recommend this restaurant.",5.0

"Absolutely perfect. Excellent food -- I had the seafood pasta and everything tasted fresh.  Great service -- from the owner to the wait staff, everyone was very attentive.

"My boyfriend took me here and I was really skeptical about it from the way it looked on the outside. From its outside appearance it doesn't look amazing, but i was pleasantly surprised once we walked in.The restaurant opens up into a romantic inside setting and a covered outside area as well as more open outside seating. It has romantic music playing as well as rose petals and candles on the table. The setting is beautiful.The food and service is even better!! I had salmon and veggies, and it was AMAZING! The selection of food is great, there is such a wide variety.We had such a great time. The waitress was lovely. Really makes for a great evening date (or day date).

The complimentary garlic bread arrived and a smile spread across our faces as we enjoyed the yumminess.My favorite part is dipping the bread into the linguini sauce that's almost soup like.

"One cannot go wrong with this place for affordable Italian food in a neighborhood otherwise devoid of any Italian food.

Now that I think back to it, maybe could have used just slightly more bold lemon flavor.Prices were reasonable as well.  Overall I will just take 1 star off for the slight flavor touch that could be improved with the garlic bread and chicken, although both were still very good.I will probably be back.",4.0

"Walk in and you'll be greeted by the warmth of an open kitchen to your right and a walkway wide enough to comfortably accommodate one row of 2-seater tables and passersby. The place is small, but very cozy. The open kitchen doubled as a bar whose counters you could eat at. I love open kitchens and I think it was the right choice for this layout since it really helps to open up the small space. Strings of lights were hung up on some fixtures, but I'm not sure if that was normal decor or holiday decor. Regardless, I was drawn to the the glow of the wall lamps against the red walls because they made the environment warm and welcoming, perfect for a dinner date or an intimate gathering with friends. Decor was very calming and relaxing with flowers and a fake candle at every table. The attention to detail didn't stop at just the dining room -- the single bathroom was also very well decorated with flowers, mirrors, and artwork, and was very clean.I can't accurately say much about the service of the level of noise since we were one of two tables there given New Year's Day. In the back was a party of ~6 with room for more, so they can accommodate larger groups if needed. Service was on par as our waitress was very friendly, personable, and attentive and the food came out quickly. Staff seemed genuinely happy to be there even on New Year's Day and were friendly in their greetings and goodbyes to us.We ordered the following: Mozzarella Sticks, Special Garlic Bread (garlic bread with melted mozzarella cheese and marinara), Chicken Parmesan, and Mushroom Risotto. While many diners love huge entree portions they can take home, I prefer healthier, well-balanced portions which this restaurant offers. The Chicken Parmesan came with one fairly sized chicken cutlet topped with mozzarella cheese and a single serving of linguini in sauce. The chicken was cooked and seasoned well, as was the pasta which was al dente in a savory sauce that was seasoned just right. My Mushroom Risotto was smooth, creamy, fragrant, and flavorful, but still felt light and did not leave me feeling gross and heavy. Big, generous hunks of mushroom were in the risotto as well as portions of asparagus spears and some shavings of some vegetable I wasn't sure of but happily ate. I added seared scallops to the risotto and it was a good choice -- the scallops were seared very nicely and were seasoned minimally, allowing the natural flavor of the seafood to speak for itself. TLDR: Come here if you're looking for a cute place for a date night or an intimate setting to catch up with an old friend or to take your parents and relatives. The ambiance was phenomenal and I felt so at ease during dinner -- never rushed, never impatient, and never feeling like anything was lacking. The food was enjoyable and well balanced and, even with the full-body flavor, did not leave me feeling heavy.",5.0

All of the prices are quite reasonable, but you still get the fine-dining experience. I had the seafood risotto special and it was excellent. My companion had the strip steak, which comes slathered in a wonderful garlic butter. Carrot cake and the theatrical fried ice cream were a nice ending to the meal.

"Monsignor's was able to accommodate a large group (11 people) on their beautiful patio for my birthday last weekend, on a Saturday night no less! I just stopped by a few days before so I could make the reservation in person. Everyone who works here is so sweet, and all of the food I've tried here is delicious and affordable. You can get a full steak dinner for $15! I recommend the hanger steak, sautéed mussels, clam chowder, and seafood pasta. They have a great happy hour, and their sangria is wonderful. It's almost never crowded.If you want a discount, try the Yelp deal (30% off) or the LivingSocial coupon ($30 for $15), although you shouldn't need it because the prices are so reasonable. I have nothing but good things to say about Monsignor's! Go there.",5.0
"The service was very friendly and the owner was super accommodating about the coupons I was attempting to use (restaurant.com is a better deal than savored in this instance)Dinner and sangria for 4 came to 83$!!

But the steak was of high quality and cooked perfectly medium rare.The back patio is really relaxed and pleasant.Would definitely come back here.",4.0
"Excellent! I will thank all the great previous reviews for getting me to this restaurant. I was staying at a local hotel on business and it was pretty late already. I was deciding between staying in and ordering Chinese, or picking a place based on yelp reviews. Bianca was my server and I was the only person there when I arrived after 10pm on a Monday.  There was no hesitation to seat me and and I received top notch service. She recommended the Atlantic salmon when I ask for one of her favorite dishes. I also started with the special garlic bread as another popular favorite. The food came out quickly and fresh. The salmon was unbelievable it was hot but not dry the rice had a great texture and flavor, the vegetables where cooked just right. I was very happy I decided to go out instead of stay in. On a side note, as I was a solo diner, this place was a perfect place for a date.

"Great service! Waiter was super nice and very attentive. We had the shrimp alfredo which was tasty. The shrimp was slightly overcooked but the pasta seriously made up for it. We also had the sea bass with veggies which was delicious! Fish was seasoned and cooked perfectly. The only complaint I have is for the fried icecream. The crust was stale and icecream was way too hard to enjoy. Nonetheless, great place to come if you're in the mood for some good and hearty food!",4.0
This place is great. The food and the staff are amazing I am looking forward in eating breakfast lunch and dinner with my family there again I wish we could give it more than 5 stars.,5.0
"We came here on 7/5 after spending a day in the park. It was a Sunday at 7 and we were seated instantly in the back. It was so lovely out; even though it was a hot day and we were outside, the covering gave us shade and the fan was not overpowering. The food was excellent. We got a round of happy hour calamari to share, and my friends got the eggplant parmigiana, and mushroom risotto with truffle oil. I was between the goat cheese ravioli which comes with ribs, or the potato gnocchi with a creamy bacon tomato sauce and asparagus. The waitress recommended the gnocchi so I went with that and it was outstanding. First of all the portion size was perfect, just enough that you were full, but could have that extra bite or two to finish off the plate. My friends' food was just as delicious so we all left very satisfied. The staff were all so friendly and helpful. I'd love to return!",5.0
"Like a lot of the other yelpers said, this is a small but cozy spot. I went on a super rainy day, so it was especially nice to stop by this little place.So on to the food! The menu that they have on their website isn't up to date. The updated menu has less selections but lunch was a standard price of $7.95/dish while dishes from the brunch menu was slightly more. My friends and I tried the special garlic bread based on other reviews. It wasn't bad but not the garlic bread we expected. It was more like a garlicy pizza. We also had the guac with chips! It was so good that I think we pretty much got full from the guac and chips. As for entrees, I had the fettucine alfredo. It was quite delicious and filling. My other friends had the ravoli and the eggplant parmesan. They seemed to like their dishes as well. We also had pina coladas and a margarita. However, we couldn't really taste the alcohol in the drinks.The waiter was attentive and cleared our plates once we were done with them. The food was very affordable and we also had a coupon for $25 off $50. So overall, we had a good time and were pleasantly surprised with the food. I would definitely come back again if I'm around the neighborhood.",4.0
"Just came back from a lovely Sunday night dinner here with my husband.  We are locals, without a backyard or patio space so we really enjoyed the garden area.  Wine is reasonably priced, and service is very gracious- never felt rushed at all.  We both enjoyed our entrees (linguine Alfredo and roasted sea bass).  The fish could have been a little bit hotter, but maybe that's just my preference.  Sangria was great - not too sweet!  Will definitely come back in the near future!",5.0

"Monsignor's was able to accommodate a large group (11 people) on their beautiful patio for my birthday last weekend, on a Saturday night no less! I just stopped by a few days before so I could make the reservation in person. Everyone who works here is so sweet, and all of the food I've tried here is delicious and affordable. You can get a full steak dinner for $15! I recommend the hanger steak, sautéed mussels, clam chowder, and seafood pasta. They have a great happy hour, and their sangria is wonderful. It's almost never crowded.If you want a discount, try the Yelp deal (30% off) or the LivingSocial coupon ($30 for $15), although you shouldn't need it because the prices are so reasonable. I have nothing but good things to say about Monsignor's! Go there.",5.0
"The service was very friendly and the owner was super accommodating about the coupons I was attempting to use (restaurant.com is a better deal than savored in this instance)Dinner and sangria for 4 came to 83$!! Whaaaat? I had the hangar steak which was in a raspberry-esque sauce which wasn't spectacular or bad, just kind of ordinary. But the steak was of high quality and cooked perfectly medium rare.The back patio is really relaxed and pleasant.Would definitely come back here.",4.0
"Excellent! I will thank all the great previous reviews for getting me to this restaurant. I was staying at a local hotel on business and it was pretty late already. I was deciding between staying in and ordering Chinese, or picking a place based on yelp reviews. Bianca was my server and I was the only person there when I arrived after 10pm on a Monday.  There was no hesitation to seat me and and I received top notch service. She recommended the Atlantic salmon when I ask for one of her favorite dishes. I also started with the special garlic bread as another popular favorite. The food came out quickly and fresh. The salmon was unbelievable it was hot but not dry the rice had a great texture and flavor, the vegetables where cooked just right. I was very happy I decided to go out instead of stay in. On a side note, as I was a solo diner, this place was a perfect place for a date. The back outdoor/indoor covered dining area was so beautiful with its live growing grape vines with grapes dangling and rose petals on the tables.

The portions are generous and the food came out quickly. The red sangria definitely took the dinner to the top. It was very good and not too strong.

"Ugh, where do I start. I went on a Wed night and was seated immediately. The waitress was nice. I had the Living Social deal ($30 worth of food and drink). I ordered a glass of red sangria and it was the best part of my meal. For an app, I ordered the cheesy garlic bread. I personally like mine toasted more. This was not and was slightly soggy. It still had a decent taste. For my entrée, I ordered the Shrimp Parmesan. The shrimp was way overcooked and had no flavor...no seasoning. The pasta sauce was more bland than the Olive Garden's! I couldn't finish everything and asked the waitress for a box. She ended up throwing away my left over pasta and just boxing the bread. I honestly didn't mind since I was gonna throw it away when I got home anyway. There's no way that shrimp would have been edible if reheated! To top all of this off, they hit me with an ""automatic gratuity"" amount! Who does that to a party of 1???? What if I didn't believe my waitress deserved that much of a tip (she was fine btw but she did throw away my food)??? I've used a ton of Living Social deals and have never had that happen. I'm honestly not sure where this restaurant is getting their high ratings. I can only assume these people have never had great Italian food before.",2.0

"Came here with my boyfriend with a Groupon deal and some excitement knowing fired ice cream is on the menu!.We ordered the steak salad and both agreed that it was delicious.  The steak was cooked medium rare and the salad had just enough dressing.  For dinner we ordered the gnocchi and a hanger steak.  The hanger steak came out very juicy and medium rare (which is how I like steak).  However, the gnocchi came out severely mushy and drenched in heavy cheese sauce.  I tried to stay positive about this dish, but I found it to be inedible in the end.For dessert, I ordered the fried ice cream.  They literally light the ball of ice cream on fire at your table then sprinkle the ingredients on top.  It was an impressive display, however eating it was a bit gross as it have the taste of pure alcohol all over it.  I would normally give a place like this two stars but I feel that the food is not bad here and that I just ordered the wrong thing.  Also, the staff was very polite and served us efficiently.  It is hard to get customer service like this.  I also find that using Groupon or living social deals places kind of rip people off a bit.  This place didn't try to trick us in the least and treated us fairly.  For all of that, I can't complain and they deserve an extra star.The atmosphere is also relaxed and it was romantic enough for a boyfriend/girlfriend situation.  I probably won't be back (so many other places to try) but I can't hate on Monsignor's Restaurant.",3.0

"My friend and I came for dinner at 9 PM on Tuesday night. If you want privacy, this is the time to come. Normally an empty restaurant would be a red flag but my friend had had lunch here and let me know it was a great place. We had wanted to sit outside but the backyard was closed. Inside is very nice and as others have mentioned, the staff is welcoming and accommodating. I had the chicken francese that came with some toasted garlic bread and my friend had the grilled chicken sandwich (which is $2 more at dinner...not sure why but we paid it). The chicken francese was nice and lemony and was served over pasta. The dish was a bit watery but the flavor was right on. My friend really liked her chicken though the sauce was a little bit too spicy for her. I like spice, so when I tried a bit, I was impressed. So basically this is a friendly, fairly priced restaurant that offers Italian food with a Spanish accent...an interesting concept that works better with some dishes than  others.",4.0
I came here after searching for a place with a back patio. When I came here I could not get over how  beautiful and perfect it was!

"This place is sooo good for me!!! I have been here only a few times after 5:00 so it was Italian food time. I cant help but keep ordering the eggplant parm.... It is so good and the portion size is HUGE! If that wasnt enough, they give you a side of pasta and once you pull it apart, it is another BIG portion size. This place is a slam dunk for the price. You also get complimentary garlic bread which is also delicious. My girlfriend get linguini in white clam sauce and says that it is great. I can't wait to go back to this place. Even though there is a good size menu, I have to keep ordering the eggplant parm because it is that good. Try it out!",5.0
"After 4 visits, it's time to review Monsignor's.In a word: outstanding. First, the food. Everything I've ordered has been awesome. From the Italian restaurant stand-bys like chicken parmesan to trickier items like mushroom risotto, I've loved everything I've eaten here. You can see the chef preparing your meal in the open kitchen, and he looks like a person who's carefully crafting something he cares about. The meals are well presented and the flavors are just great. Also important - proportion of ingredients. This is especially important with something like lasagna. We've all had bad lasagna experiences (like when too many noodles are used - ugh!) but Monsignor's gets the proportions just right. I'm powerless to do anything but eat it until it's gone. Love their tiramisu also - the ice cream layer makes it.The service has been friendly and attentive every time. Since the chef is right there, you really feel like a special guest. Sometimes the chef takes your order himself, and sometimes a friendly server is there. I'm not sure if it's a family-run establishment, but that's what it feels like.The place is small and unassuming. The decor isn't fancy or trendy, but it's cozy. For me personally, it's exactly what I like. Quiet, intimate, clean & simple. Decorations throughout look like personal items gathered throughout the years. It feels like things have a history.I could go on and on. Monsignor's is truly one of my favorite current restaurants - one of those places that's always an option, even if you just went yesterday. I forgot to mention - their prices are so reasonable, you almost COULD eat there every day. I'm starting to sound like an advertisement for the place. That's because I never want it to go away. While it'd be great to keep it my little secret, I want them to get plenty of business so they'll forever be a neighborhood fixture! As a point of comparison, I like it one notch better than the also-great Piccoli Trattoria in Park Slope.",5.0

"This is the American Dream living in action. You will understand when you get there, and its definitely worth the trip out there. Family operated, mom/pop feel (although- I should say mamasita/papsita), and a very cute toddler is growing up there (she's learning her ABCs with magnets on the walls and handing out menus). This is a really special place, a hidden gem- and I hope more people come here. Service is great. It's small and quaint (and they have a patio)- has an intimate feel. Mexican by day (until 4 pm - can still get the food after if you pay $2 extra per item) and Italian after 4 pm. All I can comment on is the Italian food- which was really, really good! It's authentic italian, elegantly presented and AFFORDABLE (all pastas are below $10)!I highly recommend starting with the ""special"" garlic bread (slathered with marinara and melted mozzarella cheese). If you don't you will still get wonderfully freshly made garlic bread (apparently the type of bread changes- we had healthy multi-grain!) Also had the fried zucchini (I wasn't too impressed- a little on the soggy side because thicker pieces and I like the thin, shredded, crispy kind). We had the:-mushroom pasta: delish if you are a fungi lover! delicate sauce that compliments the mushrooms!-pesto pasta was amazing (my friend has not had pesto so good- ever, and I swear almost had a big-O in her seat- no exaggeration)-the goat cheese ravioli in tomato sauce was yummy yummy! really hearty and filling. I was so full after eating a few- but finished it because it was so tasty!-carrot cake for dessert (very good!) Will definitely will come back again to try the other italian dishes (and as a mexican lover, I am really hoping to make it there before 4 one day!)",4.0
"Tried: Chicken Parm (Under $13), Iced Mojito ($7) I Recommend: Mojito Price: 5/5Ambiance: 5/5 Service: 5/5Food: 4/5 Intrigued by this place because as it has been described as a Mexican/Italian--so don't come here with expecting authentic Italian. The chicken (of the parm spaghetti dish) was baked, but was thin and very dry. The Spaghetti was cooked al dente, and the sauce was decent--creamy but not extremely fresh&flavorful.Awesome mojito! And the server continuously came back to check up on is/refill our waters (granted, we were the only customers during our time there).

I have been coming to monsignors since July 2014 almost every weekend , have brought my family there for holidays and friends for drinks and dinner but what happened today was pretty upsetting. My three friends and I came out for dinner and had our usual. When we got the check the check said $101, I forgot to mention that I have a 25% coupon from yelp so when I did the girl was nice about it and took it to the front to correct the check . When she brought the check back she added out of nowhere 20% gratuity ($20) first off this is a new thing they never did because I was there exactly a week ago . When I approached the waitress asking since when they do that she didn't know she asked the manager who stuttered waited a moment and then responded "" about a week "" ... Which isn't true or right . I've been to very expensive restaurants and no one adds 20% for a party of four, regular customers !!!!! I'm so disappointed with how they added gratuity only when I gave them my 25% off coupon. Slick move - just lost us as customers , hope this gesture was worth it .",2.0

"I went to this restaurant because it had good reviews on Yelp. So, I tried it and it was just okay.  Nothing special and nothing exciting.  The cook was very nice and his wife the waitress was also.  The backyard garden looks very cute but too hot in this weather.  The food was mediocre taste and the portion was kind of small.",3.0
"My friend and I came for dinner at 9 PM on Tuesday night. If you want privacy, this is the time to come. Normally an empty restaurant would be a red flag but my friend had had lunch here and let me know it was a great place. We had wanted to sit outside but the backyard was closed. Inside is very nice and as others have mentioned, the staff is welcoming and accommodating. I had the chicken francese that came with some toasted garlic bread and my friend had the grilled chicken sandwich (which is $2 more at dinner...not sure why but we paid it). The chicken francese was nice and lemony and was served over pasta. The dish was a bit watery but the flavor was right on. My friend really liked her chicken though the sauce was a little bit too spicy for her. I like spice, so when I tried a bit, I was impressed. So basically this is a friendly, fairly priced restaurant that offers Italian food with a Spanish accent...an interesting concept that works better with some dishes than  others.",4.0
I came here after searching for a place with a back patio. When I came here I could not get over how  beautiful and perfect it was! The food is an actually thoughtful mix of Italian and Mexican cuisine with vegetables and nice flavor. But that back patio is worth every minute spent here!! Service is great too.,5.0
"This place is sooo good for me!!! I have been here only a few times after 5:00 so it was Italian food time. I cant help but keep ordering the eggplant parm.... It is so good and the portion size is HUGE! If that wasnt enough, they give you a side of pasta and once you pull it apart, it is another BIG portion size. This place is a slam dunk for the price. You also get complimentary garlic bread which is also delicious. My girlfriend get linguini in white clam sauce and says that it is great. I can't wait to go back to this place. Even though there is a good size menu, I have to keep ordering the eggplant parm because it is that good. Try it out!",5.0
"After 4 visits, it's time to review Monsignor's.In a word: outstanding. First, the food. Everything I've ordered has been awesome. From the Italian restaurant stand-bys like chicken parmesan to trickier items like mushroom risotto, I've loved everything I've eaten here. You can see the chef preparing your meal in the open kitchen, and he looks like a person who's carefully crafting something he cares about. The meals are well presented and the flavors are just great. Also important - proportion of ingredients. This is especially important with something like lasagna. We've all had bad lasagna experiences (like when too many noodles are used - ugh!) but Monsignor's gets the proportions just right. I'm powerless to do anything but eat it until it's gone. Love their tiramisu also - the ice cream layer makes it.The service has been friendly and attentive every time. Since the chef is right there, you really feel like a special guest. Sometimes the chef takes your order himself, and sometimes a friendly server is there. I'm not sure if it's a family-run establishment, but that's what it feels like.The place is small and unassuming. The decor isn't fancy or trendy, but it's cozy. For me personally, it's exactly what I like. Quiet, intimate, clean & simple. Decorations throughout look like personal items gathered throughout the years. It feels like things have a history.I could go on and on. Monsignor's is truly one of my favorite current restaurants - one of those places that's always an option, even if you just went yesterday. I forgot to mention - their prices are so reasonable, you almost COULD eat there every day. I'm starting to sound like an advertisement for the place. That's because I never want it to go away. While it'd be great to keep it my little secret, I want them to get plenty of business so they'll forever be a neighborhood fixture! As a point of comparison, I like it one notch better than the also-great Piccoli Trattoria in Park Slope.",5.0
"The steak salad, and the chicken with mashed potatoes were perfection.  They really care about the product they produce, and it's made with love.  Go, enjoy, and you will not be disappointed.",5.0
"This is the American Dream living in action. You will understand when you get there, and its definitely worth the trip out there. Family operated, mom/pop feel (although- I should say mamasita/papsita), and a very cute toddler is growing up there (she's learning her ABCs with magnets on the walls and handing out menus). This is a really special place, a hidden gem- and I hope more people come here. Service is great. It's small and quaint (and they have a patio)- has an intimate feel. Mexican by day (until 4 pm - can still get the food after if you pay $2 extra per item) and Italian after 4 pm. All I can comment on is the Italian food- which was really, really good! It's authentic italian, elegantly presented and AFFORDABLE (all pastas are below $10)!I highly recommend starting with the ""special"" garlic bread (slathered with marinara and melted mozzarella cheese). If you don't you will still get wonderfully freshly made garlic bread (apparently the type of bread changes- we had healthy multi-grain!) Also had the fried zucchini (I wasn't too impressed- a little on the soggy side because thicker pieces and I like the thin, shredded, crispy kind). We had the:-mushroom pasta: delish if you are a fungi lover! delicate sauce that compliments the mushrooms!-pesto pasta was amazing (my friend has not had pesto so good- ever, and I swear almost had a big-O in her seat- no exaggeration)-the goat cheese ravioli in tomato sauce was yummy yummy! really hearty and filling. I was so full after eating a few- but finished it because it was so tasty!-carrot cake for dessert (very good!) Will definitely will come back again to try the other italian dishes (and as a mexican lover, I am really hoping to make it there before 4 one day!)",4.0
"Tried: Chicken Parm (Under $13), Iced Mojito ($7) I Recommend: Mojito Price: 5/5Ambiance: 5/5 Service: 5/5Food: 4/5 Intrigued by this place because as it has been described as a Mexican/Italian--so don't come here with expecting authentic Italian. The chicken (of the parm spaghetti dish) was baked, but was thin and very dry. The Spaghetti was cooked al dente, and the sauce was decent--creamy but not extremely fresh&flavorful.Awesome mojito! And the server continuously came back to check up on is/refill our waters (granted, we were the only customers during our time there). Seems like a family run business, so it was a relaxed atmosphere that's great for intimate groups/dates as well.",4.0

Monsignor's is the best! It's like eating at your Mexico-Italian grandmother's house. Everyone's so sweet and the food is solid Italian with $6 glasses of wine.

The price is unbeatable and the fish entree is surprisingly good. But this far from authentic Italian food. The risotto isn't even made with arborio rice.

"I live 3 blocks from Monsignor's, so when it opened my girlfriend and I couldn't wait to try it. There are definitely some decent restaurants in this neighborhood, but Monsignor's was a REALLY exciting and nice surprise for us! The food is very interesting - a mix of Italian and Mexican cuisines (although it is primarily an Italian restaurant) - and is prepared by the owner who's wife and 2 year-old daughter also work there! They are a super friendly family and have even let us come in while they were closing to have a late-night meal on several occasions.For lunch, I HIGHLY recommend the grilled chicken hero - grilled chicken, avocado, lettuce, tomatoes, onions and chipotle mayo on a hero that has been grilled with house-made garlic butter. The sandwich is very filling and comes with the most incredible french fries.For dinner, I recommend the eggplant parmigiana (this is like crack for my girlfriend - she literally craves it every two days). The plate comes with three or four crispy fried eggplant slices, garlic bread and linguini with a house-made marinara sauce. I can't really describe how good the sauce is, but I can say that it is no ordinary marinara and it is SUPER delicious!The chilled red wine is also great and you'll be served by a really sweet family who seem to genuinely love and take pride in their food!Jason",5.0

"If I could give this place more stars I would. First of all this isn't a ""Carmine's"" type restaurant which is exactly why I LOVE it. Somebody who feels the need to mention they've ordered from their luxury condo on a review about a restaurant will most likely not like the set up of this place. One thing I know for sure I've been to this family operated place on numerous occasions and never once did the sweet little girl overstep her boundaries. She was cute and helpful and handed out the menus! Her family is also one of the most humble and kindest people I've ever been served by. From the chef to the waitresses. Everyone here is great. The type of people who value their customers because they know customers are what keeps them open and I respect that 100%.Their food is delish. I have to admit I haven't tried the full menu but only because I'm hooked on the goat cheese ravioli. Those raviolis are nothing short of amazing. I can't say enough about the sauce it's so creamy and different. It isn't you're typical marinara sauce but it's so good. Also the pasta primavera is mmm mm good too. My husband is hooked on that one. Lots if veggies and the cream sauce is great! He adds chicken to the dish and that makes it all the more delicious. I always pick at his meal. Another dish he has had before is their eggplant parm which of course we loved also but we've made our choices on our favs. We LOVE Monsignor. In short they have great food at great prices with great service!!!!! 5 stars plus plus plus!",5.0

"Just fantastic.  A tiny little hole-in-the-wall place (from the front, anyway) leads into a gorgeously quaint backyard with numerous tables and a fabulous vibe.  Food was simply amazing, and at HALF as much as you'd see in the slope.  It's like walking into someone's backyard and having them make a home-cooked meal for you.  I hope that this place gets some more business, because I want them to stay!  Highly recommended.  My fiance had the salmon, and I had the chicken parm.  Both plates were licked clean.  Beers are $4, my entree was under $10 (!!), and our server was great.  Really can't say enough good things about this place.",5.0
"What a great place!  I was in charge of finding a restaurant to host a 50th year reunion of my elementary school class.  So--it was a VERY special occasion, and people were coming in from all over the country for it.  I looked at a few really elegant spots, and some places in my Williamsburg neighborhood.  But then I remembered Monsignor's from when they used to be on Manhattan Avenue and I decided to pay them a visit at their new place on 5th Avenue.WELL.  Rafael treated me like an honored guest.  Every other place else I went people barely returned my phone calls.  But Rafael sat with me and planned a menu.  He promised us the entire back deck, or, if the weather was bad, the entire restaurant for our gathering.  He helped me choose a ""soup to nuts"" meal consisting of passed appetizers, Guacamole, Salad; then a mix of chicken, beef, and vegetarian dishes, and two dessert choices.  This all came in at a MOST reasonable price.  The night of the event Rafael and his staff were warm, friendly, welcoming, and accommodating in every way.  The food was fantastic and plentiful.  My guests raved about the charm and warmth of the place, which added immeasurably to the tone of our reunion dinner.  We simply had the greatest time, and are grateful to Rafael and family for their hard work, genuine hospitality, and excellence of service and cuisine.Having a party?  Skip the fancy center Slope or downtown Brooklyn spots.  Call Rafael and have a down-home, warm, welcoming event with great food, drinks, and ambiance.  I really could NOT be happier.",5.0

"We have lived in this neighborhood for 14 years and even though this place is about a year and a half old, this was our first visit. (side note: clearly no one who works at Yelp lives in Brooklyn. This is absolutely not Windsor Terrace, it's South Slope or Greenwood Heights)Wow, what a find! It was Friday night and the place was empty. We almost passed right by but decided to pop in and just have a drink to feel the place out. We were met so warmly by the waitress (and her 1 yr. old daughter) that we ventured through to the garden out back. It is beautiful! We instantly decided to stay for dinner.The first half of the garden is under a terrace over which grows an enormous grape vine. The rest od the space is covered by umbrellas and surrounded by lovely plantings including a fig tree. Both the vine and the fig tree bear fruit that the waitress (Betsy) will wash and serve for you.OK, the food was delicious. It was so good, our 19 year old niece actually put her phone away and stopped texting while she ate! That rarely happens. And Betsy if fabulous! Friendly, funny, charming, personable... Our little group had already decided we would go back before tasting the food just to sit in that garden and chat with Betsy.I almost don't want anyone else to go here, but I had to share it.",5.0
"I am a creature of habit. Usually I get dinner delivered from one of three regular places. However in a moment of indecisiveness this evening I ordered the gnocchi from Monsignor's for home delivery due almost entirely to the Yelp reviews. Then I thought I was stupid because gnocchi is boring. Then it came. It was very prompt, and it was hot, huge, had the most glorious pinky cream sauce, fresh mushrooms, bok choi and slices of asparagus. And it came with a side of garlic bread (I am not a fan of garlic) which smelled so divine that I dipped in the sauce and devoured it in seconds due to its delicious crunchy perfectness. So I wrote this. Tomorrow I will smell of garlic. I will hate myself for a while, and then at dinner I will order their ravioli. Or meatballs.",4.0
"Monsignor's is a solid neighborhood eatery.  The prices are great and the food is pretty damn good, though surprising at times (as in, ""Oh! I had no idea this was going to arrive swimming in a cream sauce, but ok, yum..."")We got the branzino and the risotto special (asparagus, mushrooms, and goat cheese), both of which were great, and the chicken parm and hanger steak are on our list to try next time.Sit under the grape vines, try the wine, have some garlic bread and order from the sweetest sunset-park server ever.",3.0

"We stumbled upon this restaurant on our way to Green-Wood. We were starving and didn't know the area that well. It was around 2:30 and Yelp actually said it was closed. Lucky for us, it wasn't.Even though they're listed as an Italian restaurant, they serve Mexican food until 4 pm. They have huge, awesome quesadillas and burritos, plus nachos. And there's a back patio that's spacious and lovely.",5.0
"If I could give this place more stars I would. First of all this isn't a ""Carmine's"" type restaurant which is exactly why I LOVE it. Somebody who feels the need to mention they've ordered from their luxury condo on a review about a restaurant will most likely not like the set up of this place. One thing I know for sure I've been to this family operated place on numerous occasions and never once did the sweet little girl overstep her boundaries. She was cute and helpful and handed out the menus! Her family is also one of the most humble and kindest people I've ever been served by. From the chef to the waitresses. Everyone here is great. The type of people who value their customers because they know customers are what keeps them open and I respect that 100%.Their food is delish. I have to admit I haven't tried the full menu but only because I'm hooked on the goat cheese ravioli. Those raviolis are nothing short of amazing. I can't say enough about the sauce it's so creamy and different. It isn't you're typical marinara sauce but it's so good. Also the pasta primavera is mmm mm good too. My husband is hooked on that one. Lots if veggies and the cream sauce is great! He adds chicken to the dish and that makes it all the more delicious. I always pick at his meal.

"I went here based on the reviews from Yelp, and I must say my Yelpers did not disappoint. Walking into this place does remind you of walking into someones house and having them cook for you, but don't let that scare you! Unfortunately, we went during the heat wave so it was a little hot in there as the A/C wasn't doing a thing.

Please be advised that the food during lunch is Mexican while dinner menu is Italian (a novel idea!) We ordered the garlic bread which was fantastic. Just the right blend of butter and garlic and *gasp* it wasn't cold! My bff and I ordered fried calamari as an appetizer and I must say it was outstanding. Fresh, not too much batter and quite tasty. I ordered the lasagna and it was one of the better lasagna's I've tasted. The sauce was outstanding, and it was a perfect blend of meat, cheese and pasta. My only caveat was that I found the dish to be a tad salty.    My bff ordered linguini with seafood and she said it was awesome. I had a taste, and although to me it was just pretty good, the sauce they used absolutely saved the dish. Make sure you bring your appetite because these portions are huge.   If you're a dessert person, you wont be disappointed. I ordered the fried ice cream and the bff ordered chocolate mousse cake. The waitress lights the fried ice cream up in front of you which was very nice. The cake was outstanding as well.    All in all, I will definitely come back here. The presentation of the meals was fantastic, and similar to what you would find in high end restaurants.

"With an eating companion, my lovely wife, in arm, I told her that she had to try out Monsignor's with me.  After all, there was a Yelp review to prove.  A little tealight candle, a nice summer night, and a patio seating area that is literally the backyard of a Brooklyn rowhome, and the only thing left to prove was an in-restaurant dining experience.   I told her was very unlike anything this part of town usually offered.Starting off was a couple garlic bread slices that you get for actually sitting down and enjoying a nice dinner.  Beyond it being somewhat of a lost art, I got to experience again what was sheer joy and love of cooking from the owner/chef.  My wife ordered the meat lasagna, and beyond its very generous portion, the bite that I sampled was a perfect blend and portioning of meat, pasta and my favorite, a slightly spicy marinara.  Delicious.  However, it was my order of the broiled branzino that bumps this to a 5 star experience.  The chef explained to me his technique that resulted in a 4-cheese sauce, perfectly soaking pomme frites (yeah, french fries), and a bed of spinach that spoke to its freshness.  Sitting on top of that delicious combination was a perfect broiled (tender and moist with a crunchy outer skin) branzino.  I can still feel the harmony of the three combining with that perfect sauce blend with the various cheeses bringing out each flavor component.Thank you Monsginor for such a work of art for one's palate to consume.  Not to mention, my wife was very happy with her meal which resulted in further good things happening the rest of the night.",5.0

Not only is the menu rather eclectic, but it's prepared in a really methodical way and the presentation is quite nice! They're also super friendly and welcoming, probably because the restaurant has been very quiet since it opened, though the last time I was there I saw quite a few people come in for take-out. The bonus if you stay, though, is that they serve delicious warm garlic bread to the table. It's a welcome addition to South Slope, if you ask me.",4.0

"Since moving to South Slope, this has been my go-to spot!  I probably frequent this place at least once a week.  I love everything on the menu - you can tell every item is prepared with love.  The prices are extremely reasonable and the staff is friendly.  You must try the risotto - it is amazing!",5.0
"Quaint and cozy with a warm delightful staff, featuring most fulfilling staple Italian plates realized through traditional and Latino influences in the kitchen.  Great stuff, great time, will return!",4.0
Too much cream and cheese in their Marinara sauce.,1.0
"With an eating companion, my lovely wife, in arm, I told her that she had to try out Monsignor's with me.  After all, there was a Yelp review to prove.  A little tealight candle, a nice summer night, and a patio seating area that is literally the backyard of a Brooklyn rowhome, and the only thing left to prove was an in-restaurant dining experience.   I told her was very unlike anything this part of town usually offered.Starting off was a couple garlic bread slices that you get for actually sitting down and enjoying a nice dinner.  Beyond it being somewhat of a lost art, I got to experience again what was sheer joy and love of cooking from the owner/chef.  My wife ordered the meat lasagna, and beyond its very generous portion, the bite that I sampled was a perfect blend and portioning of meat, pasta and my favorite, a slightly spicy marinara.  Delicious.  However, it was my order of the broiled branzino that bumps this to a 5 star experience.  The chef explained to me his technique that resulted in a 4-cheese sauce, perfectly soaking pomme frites (yeah, french fries), and a bed of spinach that spoke to its freshness.  Sitting on top of that delicious combination was a perfect broiled (tender and moist with a crunchy outer skin) branzino.  I can still feel the harmony of the three combining with that perfect sauce blend with the various cheeses bringing out each flavor component.Thank you Monsginor for such a work of art for one's palate to consume.  Not to mention, my wife was very happy with her meal which resulted in further good things happening the rest of the night.",5.0

"This little spot opened up in my neighb a few weeks ago and though I didn't expect much from a little hole-in-the-wall italian restaurant (which is actually manned by latino owners), I have to say that I've been really impressed on both occasions that I visited. Not only is the menu rather eclectic, but it's prepared in a really methodical way and the presentation is quite nice! They're also super friendly and welcoming, probably because the restaurant has been very quiet since it opened, though the last time I was there I saw quite a few people come in for take-out. The bonus if you stay, though, is that they serve delicious warm garlic bread to the table. It's a welcome addition to South Slope, if you ask me.",4.0
"Fantastic little spot, especially if you sit out back. There are grape vines, fig tree, and other old world touches that really got me. And the food was tasty, fresh and beautifully presented. Totally worth the walk down 5th.",4.0
"so i called them like 3 times and they didnt pick up which was very odd since they always do, and right when i was about to place my order somewhere else i canceled because they didnt take amex and like amazing people Monsignor are they called me back true hero's i really wanted to order from them from the start so i did, theyre awesome! in person and delivery is great, had the linguini alfredo and they sent me it with oven baked bread like always yummy, but since they took the time to call back i might as well take some time and write this review 5 stars!",5.0
"Just go. This place is one of those gems you don't want to tell anyone about... but selfishly you want the guy to stay in business so you can keep going back. Seafood pasta was a standout with perfectly cooked fresh pasta, lots of seafood and a sauce that exuded the sea. The branzino was an unusual combination, but delicious. Service was lovely.",5.0
"I love this little place. The backyard is spectacular. Charming, romantic. The staff is so nice. The food is excellent. I know the menu looks weird, but it is fantastic. I went w/ a friend and we split two dishes; they split it for us so that each half-portion was beautifully presented on its own plate. My only gripe is the music. So cheesy. Celine Dion! Please, Monsignors, how about something authentic? like traditional Mexican or Italian, to match the cuisine.",4.0
"Recently went to Monsignor's based on all the stellar reviews here. I was curious about the place because it's just this tiny little spot on 5th Ave offering Italian in an area that is largely endless variations of Mexican or Latin food. My husband and I were happy with our experience. As someone who has worked in the food industry for over 10 years now, I have to temper my review because what makes this place charming and worth-visiting has little to do with the food and I wish the other reviewers would have been more honest. First off, let me say Monsignor's IS very much like stepping into someone's home and having them personally cook for you. The menu items are not strictly what they profess to be. For example NY Steak says bolognese sauce with no such thing on the plate, and onion rings which were actually pan-fried onions. I love onions so I gobbled them up. I think after spotting other cute misspellings on the menu, it's more a case of what's lost in translation.  The menu itself is very eclectic with some Italian and the ubiquitous Mexican offerings in this neck of 5th Ave. Prices are all very reasonable. However, I don't mean any of this to come across as negative. If you go in knowing what to expect then you'll be very happy. The service is as personal and warm as it gets with the owner's adolescent daughter as your waitress and the chef/owner personally bringing food to your table. The lasagna was better than than I've tasted in many old school red sauce joints and my NY steak was delicious regardless of my understanding of the menu. We also tried out their fried calamari which comes with either chipotle mayo or marinara. Being big fans of spicy food, we opted for the chipotle mayo and it was a perfect heat level, not the wimpy stuff that passes for spicy in most other places. Calamaris itself was tasty and came with some fried zucchini mixed in. It's definitely a family atmosphere with the kids milling about and the toys laying around but still very peaceful compared to all the crazy numbers of kids running around in most Park Slope restaurants (Oh God! like the hell that is Two Boots if you go too early in the evening).  The only reason I cannot give a higher star rating is because I reserve that for places where the food is exceptional for it's kind. While the food here is good and fresh and welcome in a stretch of 5th that is rather limited in options, the main draw is the friendly, quirky, and relaxed atmosphere. We will go back and check out more items on their menu. If something in particular blows me away, I'll update this review later.",3.0
