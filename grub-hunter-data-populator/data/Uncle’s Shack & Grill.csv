"i already knew i was gonna love this place even before trying it out xoxoleo, the owner - he has a heart of gold xoxo  he is passionate about his food, has spent so much time perfecting his craft, talking with (and really listening to!) his customers and infusing love into his food, he is on top of his game xoxo  i asked about a million questions the first time i ordered, and he patiently took the time to thoroughly answer (above and beyond!) my questions and it really helped me decide what i wanted.  (and everything i tried was delicious!) i will try more and report back, soon!    : )",5.0
"I have had 3 encounters at this establishment.1st: After seeing that this place was literally around the corner from where I'm staying, and after reading the reviews, I called. and called. and called.... and CALLED!!! this was at 7 pm. there's no way this place could be closed! So, naturally... I walked over. It was shut down! I was sad, because I REALLY wanted the salmon burger! Forgive me, also called on another occasion, to no avail. I convinced myself this place shut down.2nd: this was yesterday. I rode past and saw that indeed, this establishment was open for business. So I ordered early. I ordered and asked how long it would be. I was told it would be ready when I got there. I got there, and had to wait! Water under the bridge. I got my food and walked home. As soon as I got n the house, I realized she never gave me my drink that I paid for. eh, no big deal. I opened my food and saw that everything looked almost perfect... I wanted sweet potato fired and got curly fries instead... NO WORRIES!! They were the most perfect curly fries I'd ever eaten!  Just looking at my salmon burger... This thing really wasn't a ""burger"". It was a piece of HUGE salmon on a burger bun. Immediately I thought to myself was a great size hunk of fish for the price ($6). The fish was cooked PERFECTLY. I mean, it was something I could eat without having to add a damn thing to it. it was seasoned to perfection. Some of the most delicious salmon I've ever had the pleasure of tasting.3rd: this was today. I thought about that mouth watering salmon ALL DAY! I just knew I had to order another one. So I made sure I called early, and I ordered the same thing. I got there, and still had a bit of a wait. My total wait might have been 30-40 minutes from the time I ordered. not a problem at all. I politely asked if since my drink was forgotten the day before, if I could receive it with today's order. The owner asked me why I didn't come back or call when I realized my drink was missing the night before. I told him not to worry about it. He almost gave me curly fries again!!! I corrected him, and added time to wait for my meal but I wanted the sweet potato fries. I did get my drink I paid for the day before. The man on the grill, I just want him to cook all of my salmon forever. not to mention he's handsome. but my food was as delicious as the day before. I am sure I will be returning here during the duration of my stay in Brooklyn.",4.0
"I just hit a three-peat in this place...For brunch I had the  spicy mango wings with fries and their tropical smoothie. It was really good. I took my daughter there after school and she had the purple banana smoothie  (first time she ever finished an entire smoothie) and the chicken fingers. I was pleased both visits...I came in there for dinner like ""Here, take my money"" I ordered  the Tilapia, shrimp and chips  (steamed), the salmon burger, sweet wings, and fish tacos. We split the order and I asked everyone for a second opinion... the meal did not disappoint..the portions were right and then some. You can tell that they use quality ingredients because.... Man oh Man!!! When you guys visit, do not pass up on the cornbread( I mean it). I had the Brooklyn Cream soda...and the label doesn't lie, I tasted it and I love it.I have never had anyone able to convince me to try mussels and I am glad Leo was my first time. ..the curry mussels were not shared...no one even knew I had them in my possession, they were delicious. Definitely worth the three trips and waiting for 11:30 am for them to open.Leo, your vibe was what had me sold from brunch. My daughter was satisfied with her meal and that was enough for me. But I was definitely satisfied with everything I had...I was waiting to take a mediocre bite and it never happened....everything exceeded my expectations. Thank you for making me feel like I was important and as if I was doing you a service, when in all honesty, you've given me a go-to spot that's not gonna break my pockets or give me the ""itis"" (that's quality). We ate and didn't feel like we were dragging after. I look forward to not only your expansion but success....See you soon  (And you know I mean sooner than you think. .lol)",5.0
"Not bad, not bad at all... Ordered for delivery a BBQ salmon burger and tilapia, shrimp and chips. I was reassured by the man who took my order and the delivery guy that the salmon burger was good, and it really was. The shrimp and fries was good too, I could've lived without the tilapia. My total was 19.33, not bad. Also they threw in oatmeal cookies. Friendly customer service and good food, yea I will be ordering from here again",4.0
Do yourself a favor and go to this establishment. Absolutely amazing. Mouth watering salmon burger.,5.0
After reading fellow yelpers reviews and being in the neighborhood my boyfriend and i decided to give this place a try and it was 100% worth it! From the excellent customer service to the delicious food this place is a 5 star quality place in this side of Brooklyn. Not only was the service and food amazing the prices are extremely reasonable.,5.0
"Jerk wings had so much salt I couldn't finish eating it, Basa salad was average, I could of made it better myself, luckily I was home because there was no salad dressing. Smoothies are good, thank God I have something to fill me up until I can have a real meal. I waited an hour and 15 minutes for smoothies!! Never again",2.0

"The rating is based on the location in the neighborhood. Flatbush area really didn't have a strong fish fry place that was consistent until I discovered Uncle's.I ordered delivery last night tilapia, shrimp and chips. The fish is fried in that harlem style way so it wasn't soggy when it arrived (one thing I was super worried about). Portions are big and the chips are nice and big. Leo took my order on the phone - he was super friendly and threw in an oatmeal cookie and corn bread to try out since it was my first time ordering. Both were really good and the oatmeal cookie really really stood out. Heck - i don't typically like oatmeal cookies and this one was amazing.Will be ordering again and again. Wish they stayed open a little later than 8ish.",5.0
"I've had a few items from Uncle's. Flavor has been consistent along with the great customer service. I often get the whitings, shrimp and chips. I always end up eating half later because there is so much food. I also like the grilled shrimp salad and the Island Boy smoothie.",4.0
"A hidden gem with very fresh and high quality seafood. This place seems to get busy too. I had the tilapia, shrimp and chips and it was crisp and delicious. The store itself looks brand new and is super clean and neat. The owner seems to be very neighborhood friendly also. Love this joint.",5.0

"Salmon burger is absolutely delicious and the portion is HUGE. This is not some average cut of salmon. It's thick, juicy, and grilled perfectly. I also had the pleasure of the owner delivering my food & he was such a nice guy! Other businesses in this area could learn a lesson or two from Uncle's Shack (both in terms of food AND customer service!)",5.0
I was working in the area and was in the mood for a good smoothie. Asked around and a fellow yelper suggested Uncles. Ordered the Island Boy smoothie.... Wow! Great flavor to this with a nice mix of fruits and a dash of peanut butter. Front desk person was very nice and cordial. Said there was a special on smoothies (2 small shakes for the price of a large $5). I also ordered the special of the day which was a grilled chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries for $5. Both the meal and smoothies were a great deal for this area as well as delicious. There isn't much in the way of seating here: 2 barstools and 2 benches along the window. Seating is basically for waiting for your pickup order to go or for having a quick meal there by yourself or with just 1-2 more friends. They deliver within the local vicinity. While I waited for my food about 3 lunch orders were called in for pickup or delivery.  Try it and please remember to tip! :-),5.0
I ordered delivery; The service was great and delivered before the expected time. However it wasn't what I ordered. I ordered season fries for my orders and only received regular fries. Big deal? Maybe maybe not I just like to get what I pay & tip for. The food was decent. I'll probably order again with lower expectations.,4.0

"I previously gave this place a mediocre review based on mediocre service. I'm updating my review based on my last delivery. After having a couple bad experiences with this place, I decided to order from here after a couple months. Ordered a burger, fries, fish shrimp and chips, and some jerk wings. Everything was flavorful, although the burger came with no toppings. My and my significant other were satisfied and the order came in a timely manner. Good job guys.

"Tonight was my first time ordering delivery from here. I had a serious craving for a burger and some fries, and as I looked through the menu I decided the chicken strips looked good as well.Well, my burger was exactly what I was craving, it was delicious! It tasted like it was char-broiled on a grill outside, had lettuce and ketchup and American cheese on a white bun. Nothing fancy, but certainly flavorful.I also ordered the seasoned fries, which had a nice kick to them. They arrived a little soggy, but then again that could be my personal preference for extra-crispy fries, which I did not specify in the order. The chicken strips were crispy and moist and also met all expectations.I was also very pleased that they made sure to give me extra ketchup and sauce as I requested. I specified that I like to use ""a lot of ketchup,"" and they made sure to stock me up. Most places do not always read the ""additional information"" sections, but they not only read it, but made sure I was given what I requested.The only only downside to this experience, is that delivery came by car, which meant I had to go downstairs to pick up my food from the delivery vehicle. Considering this is NYC, I expect food to be delivered to my apartment door, especially when there is an additional delivery charge. This is why I rated 4 stars instead of 5.After all is said and done, I most certainly recommend Uncle's Shack & Grill. It is great American Cuisine, at a fair price. I will most certainly be ordering from here again.",4.0
"Worst service ever. Ordered through Grubhub. Estimated delivery was for 4:10. I was lied to at 4:30 and told my food was 5 minutes away. Then the driver shows up 20 minutes later and asks me to come downstairs and get my food. I was not well--sick--so I asked the driver to come upstairs. I was then called by the driver and yelled at and told if I want to get my food I need to come downstairs as the delivery man had 4 other orders and can't find parking. I said I'm sorry, but I can't come downstairs. I was then yelled at again and threatened with not receiving my food. So I told the person yelling at me that not getting my food was fine with me. AWFUL CUSTOMER SERIVCE. DO NOT ORDER FROM THEM.UPDATE: Called the restaurant to speak with the owner and complain and was told the owner was unavailable and was then brushed off for another ""incoming call.""
