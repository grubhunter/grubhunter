"I love this place. The food is consistently delicious, and there's a large variety of what you can order - you can customize tacos, burritos, salads, quesadillas, and fruit juices. The restaurant always appears super clean with great decor, and the staff are really nice. This is a really great Mexican spot. :)",5.0
"Walked past this spot and decided to place an order for delivery. They have a nice selection of items on their menu and all of the usual Mexican staples burrito, tacos (hard/soft), cemitas, quesadillas can be found. The prices are very good for the amount of food I think.We ordered chipotle chicken quesadilla which I thought was pretty good. I enjoyed the taste of the chicken and the portion was just right for one person. I also had a side order of guacamole and chips which I was a little disappointed in because while the guacamole was excellent and fresh the chips looked like store brought tortilla circles. Hopefully they can fix that. We also ordered 4 tacos which were very good as well.Overall I would say the food is tasty and service for me was fairly quick. Originally the guy on the phone told me 45 minutes but my food arrived earlier than that.",4.0
Spicy shrimp quesadilla was so good. Really like the restaurant is very clean and has nice open seating.,4.0
"Previous issues aside, they've cleaned up their act and it has quickly become one of our favorite Mexican spots in bklyn.",4.0
"New spot in town; is it worth a try? FUCK YES!I was skeptical at first b/c I'm used to the taco cart across the street but w/ my friend's peer pressure, I tried it. Best. Decision. EVAR. Yo, this place has everything better. The meat, the variety of mexican drinks, the servicing, and the prices! I got 3 tacos, and was satisfied w/ all 3 b/c they packed on the meat and the flavor was ... ! *rolls eyes back*  I love it. It's my go-to spot for anything taco-related.",5.0
Ordered on seamless after reading other reviews. I've tried a few other similar places and been disappointed. Good arrived super fast and was piping hot. Tacos were amazing!! Similar to my favorite place at home. Cheap too. My new go to on seamless.,5.0

"The food here is very good! However, every time I order they take wayyyy too long to deliver, at least an hour. And if I call to check on the delivery they act like it's no big deal.. . "" oh yeah he's just leaving now"". Obviously its worth the wait bc I continue to order. Just know that if you want a delivery do it in advance. Other than that I have no complaints. Their tostadas are my fave, tortas are great, burritos are yummy. All at a fair price.",4.0
This place is just so so ive had better Mexican food but there aren't that many in the area so this will do if im ever craving mexican,4.0
Great meals made on site right there. They  use fresh ingredients so you can't go wrong with the Mexican food. I go there often cause they have the best quality food among the nearby stores.  Also the little lady that works there in the evenings is super sweet so she'll make sure you're happy as you wait to receive your food.,5.0
"This place is a welcome addition to the neighborhood!I ordered a chipotle chicken burrito, which was a perfect portion, slightly spicy, and filled with cheese and sour cream, brown rice, and beans. I also orders the nachos with queso, which were a little light on the queso. All in all I will certainly come back for more, it was a pleasurable experience and much needed addition the Church Ave.",4.0
Happiness is holding a burrito.Very friendly people run this place. The burritos are made in front of you (think Chipotle). Fresh ingredients and nice fresh juice selection.,4.0
"LOVE this place! So happy we have a quality Mexican restaurant on Church Ave! The tacos are A+++! Been there twice and everything is always super fresh and prepared right in front of you. Burritos are enormous and well worth the money. Horchata is AMAZING. The guac is delicious and fresh as well. I wish this place well and hope they have many years of business to come! The interior is really nice too and a good spot to eat if you are on the go. Its clean, bright, and one of the few stand out places in this stretch of Church ave. Salsas also taste homemade and amazing!!!!",5.0
"HIS: I'm a huge Mexican food fan and tacos are my go-to so, I thought I should try out this place based on its reviews. The restaurant itself is pretty bland and not my favorite. Maybe 2 tables in a big open space where there is plenty of space for me. At first glance it looks like a Chipotle and the food sitting in the containers don't look so great. The menu is way bigger and like I said the reviews had me eager to try it out anyways. 2 Al Pastor tacos (sad how many Mexican spots don't have this in NY) and 1 Carnitas taco. Instead of them pulling from the containers they had the meat cooked fresh in the back. BIG PLUS. They also had homemade Horchata which I liked, not loved but liked enough to order again next time. The tacos were packed and delicious but I'll admit I was disappointed they had NO chips except for some bags of Lays you can buy for $1. The ""hot"" salsa was not hot at all in my opinion as well. Overall I'd be happy to come back but hope one day they add real chips to that menu!",4.0

"Ordering online was a breeze. The delivery time didn't seem long. The food itself, wasn't that great. Rice was decent. I expected them to give me pinto beans but instead I got black beans. The soft taco was meh, steak was tough. Boyfriend didn't care for the burrito, too much rice, not enough meat. The worst part of it all was the nachos with cheese. Completely cold as if they made it in the morning (ordered an hr before closing time) and had it there all day. They couldn't even bother to heat it up. Me being from Texas and this claiming to be ""Tex-mex"".... Not even close.",2.0
Great family style Mexican food.,5.0
The quesadilla was sub par (weird textured tortilla and skimpy on the cheese)The burrito on the other hand was delicious but barely had any meat and had more rice than I would have liked. The horchata was perfectThis place would be 4/5 stars if they weren't so stingy,3.0
"I had hard shell tacos, they were yummy. They don't try to skimp out on the ground beef either. The woman was very helpful as soon as I walked through the door. It wasn't too many people in here, people in this area mostly take their food out. If I'm ever in the area and need cheap/good food, I will defiantly stop in here again.",5.0

"This is the spot for homemade, fresh and healthy Mexican.I got a veggie burrito. They have white flour tortillas and also whole wheat wraps from Aladdin bakeries.  They also have vegetable and fruit juices and smoothies--very reasonably priced.The burrito could have used a bit more flavor, but they just opened and it's a promising start (i may also not be used to the whole wheat wrap which kind of drowns out other flavors).  The owners are a husband and wife who do the cooking--they asked how I might have liked it different--it's clear they are really open to customer feedback and providing excellent service.  The different meat dishes look excellent and made me wish I were eating meat now.As far as the veggie buritto goes, I really liked the big pieces of sauteed onion and the garlic mushrooms.  I will definitely be back.  The price was great and the restaurant is an open and inviting space.",5.0
"I moved here from L.A. and tried many different Mexican restaurants all over Brooklyn just to be let down every time.

Finally good Mexican food and walking distance from my house! Mallenche is the best Mexican food in my neighborhood hands down! Their spanish rice reminds me of my Grandmas rice, super delicious.

"First start by saying chipotle is better than this place. I had a grilled chicken bowl which was mediocre at best, I was looking for something packed with more flavor it was extremely bland. I also got a chipotle chicken quesadilla which had a wheat tortilla which I assumed would be white flour but I guess they don't let you know that unless you go in the store yourself. It was a little more flavorful and I'll attribute that to the chipotle chicken.

I went with the Mexican shredded chicken because it looks the moistest. I had the Mexican rice, black beans, grilled onions and peppers, pico and hot salsa, corn, and lettuce. The burrito was a decent size and very filling but the taste was meh. Chicken wasn't very flavorful even though it was soaked in sauce, rice was tasteless, and the lettuce was manly stem pieces which isn't appetizing.
