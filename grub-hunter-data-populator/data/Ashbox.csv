"Ashbox is one of my favorite spots in Greenpoint. It's a very tranquil Japanese café where you can have a tea, onigiri, or a miso soup and read a book or magazine. I could go here by myself or with my roommates who liked the spot, too. I like that it's a little bit way out of the way and close to the water and bridge. The cafe is never crowded or loud; I love that. It's like a cozy hideaway.",5.0
"This place was really very nice overall and I came really close to giving it a full five stars.  The Menu consisted of several sandwiches and traditional Japanese dishes including half a dozen varieties of onigiri.Pros:The decor is cute and quaint and really makes you feel good.The bathroom is really clean and nice. The onigiri were large and tasty overall.  There is a large array of other traditional Japanese treats.Cons:Cash Only.  Not a huge con, but can put a cramp in your plans if you are not prepared for it.  The bread on the turkey sandwich was very touch and chewy.  It did not impact the flavor but contributed to the sandwich being relatively mediocre overall.The rice in the best onigiri I have had had a wonderful flavor from being seasoned with rice vinegar and flame grilled.  Comparatively the rice in the onigiri at Ashbox was not particularly flavorful.  The overall quality of the establishment is wonderful.  And despite the mediocre quality of the sandwiches the onigiri are really good.  So give this luttle hole in teh wall a try!",4.0
I really wanted to LOVE this place. Coming inside it gave me a warm cozy feeling. But the rest of my experience gave me something otherwise. This is not a place to study in. There are minimal outlets and NO wifi. The food here was mediocre at best and left me with a weird aftertaste. I ordered a matcha latte hoping for the best but it literally tasted like nothing. I could've made a better latte at home. So disappointed considering it's a Japanese joint. I don't think I will return. There are better options for cafes.,1.0
"Everything about this place is amazing - very old spot. Always a pleasure to something so local, full of character and care!",5.0
"Clean, healthy and rice-filled, Ashbox is a cozy Japanese cafe with a delicious light menu. It is also a great breakfast spot as they open early and serve relatively quick. The cafe doesn't have wifi, discouraging people from treating the place as a work cafe. A great place to get that zen on, especially after a crazy work week. We went there on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and ordered happy rice (with salmon), tofu salad, and two ornigris with salmon roe and salted kelp. All were really light, yet filling. The portions weren't huge (as expected from the price), but allowed us to sample a variety of their food I highly enjoyed the tofu salad. Ashbox definitely resembles a feel good spot from its food to its ambience. FYI: Their menu is much larger at the store than what is posted online!",4.0
"I love Ashbox! They're a bit out of the way, and remember to bring cash (or hit up a deli nearby), but the food is awesome. Light options range from miso soup, to homemade tofu and seaweed wraps. They've also got a sandwich and salad menu. Service is pretty speedy.My go-to order? I get the homemade tofu with bonito flakes, avocado salmon seaweed wrap, and miso soup. It comes up to around $10, but more importantly, I don't feel bogged down for the rest of the day. The food is simple yet delicious and filling.When the ladies at Ashbox call my name to let me know that my order is ready, I know that I'm in for a treat.",5.0
"I think for starters, I ordered the wrong thing. The pork sandwich was not too good. It was bland and too much mayo. The rice ball was great and I think this place probably excels at Japanese stuff. However, the biggest downfall was that this lovely spot didn't have wifi! So sad. I had to leave immediately!",2.0
"Ashbox is a great, quiet little coffeeshop. We visited on a rainy Saturday morning, and I got a cappuccino. We grabbed a table and played a board game, and no one seemed to mind. The coffee was great, but the food menu looked super interesting, and I want to go back for lunch one day.",4.0
"Very cute and cozy place! Good coffee, good service, affordable prices. It's a perfect place to work/study as they have tons of seatings with accessible outlets. I went on a Friday afternoon so can't say how busy it is on weekends. The only reason it's not 5 stars is because they don't have wifi.",4.0
"Really lovely little place. No wi-fi and cash only. Has an old-school feel to it and cute decor. The rice balls are awesome, you can pick from a bunch of different flavors, which are all tasty. I had some of the sandwiches as well, which were for the most part very good. Lots of seating and generally not crowded. The coffee is hit-or-miss, but the green tea latte is above average. The eggs are nothing special, wouldn't have them again. Service is friendly. Prices aren't too high, we usually pay around $20 for breakfast for two. Great spot for a low key meal.",4.0
All of their food is very nice quality and tastes great.,4.0
"I've never had any of their sandwiches but I have had their Japanese offerings. Onigiri, miso soup, rice dishes, etc. It's a small selection of delicious Japanese foods, but worth. The onigiri and miso are some of the best I've had!Everything is fresh and healthy here. The staff is sweet, and there's places to sit down with your friends. Recommended walk to in Greenpoint. :)",5.0
"This is a super cute spot for lunch. Great teas and sandwiches. It's a nice combination of Japanese offerings and American food. Sandwiches for about $6. They have a daily lunch special for $6.50, which is always good and an easy way pick your lunch when you can't be bothered to think about it. There's no wifi, so it's not a great spot to do work, but laptops are allowed if you don't need access to the Internet. The only thing that's bad about it is that it's WAY up in Northern Greenpoint, so unless you live or work nearby, it's not very convenient to get to. :-/",5.0
"A decent little lunch spot. I am a big luncher, so I like finding restaurants that do only that and don't worry about dinner. I had the lunch special - pork bagel with a salad. The pork was thick and tender, and the bagel was nice and warm. The meat was served on the salad so you could construct your own bagel, though I wish it had been assembled for me. I was really taken by how tasty the dressing on the salad was. A good portion size as well. And with my tea, lunch was still under $10. Pretty good deal.I'll definitely be back - want to try their soup next.",4.0
"Best place to get lunch, if you have cash on hand. From the amazing onigiri, huge salads, and tasty sandwiches, it's pretty much infallible. The lunch specials are really good price-value, and the atmosphere is really nice. The southampton tea blend is insanely comforting to me.",5.0
"I am fan of their Rice Balls.  I think it is the best in NYC.Compared to what you can find in Japanese grocery stores like Sunrise Mart, they are made fresh, they use half brown (Haiga) rice and far better.I also like their salads, they come in 2 sizes and you can get large for under $8 and they are huge.",4.0
"I came because Yelp said there was free wifi but there's not.. So in-spite of that, they don't accept cards so that makes things even more interesting. I love the atmosphere. The bell on the door makes it feel especially fun. They have comp water as well as milk and sugar you can add yourself once you get your coffee. The restroom is actually really cool. Wifi and card acceptance would make it 5 stars in my opinion.",4.0
"Quirky Japanese cafe in Greenpoint. A bit of a walk from the train but we drove here so that wasn't an issue.Their salmon onigiri was really good but I wasn't impressed with the macha latte (green tea latte) they offered. E had a smoked salmon sandwich and a cappucino. He liked the sandwich but said the coffee was just OK so I guess there's nothing really special about their coffee either.I do like how they did the decor inside and the customers who come here are very quiet and respectful. I had to lower my voice a lot (a stretch) since I didn't want anyone else overhearing my convo.They close at 4pm on Saturdays, closed on Sundays. Plan accordingly.",4.0
"Overpriced. I was disappointed when I ordered the turkey, avocado sandwich. For $10- I got a sandwich that literally had two very thin slices of deli meat on it, with greens and bit of avocado on it. Also, the time I waited for this sandwich doesn't make sense, considering there wasn't much to it.",2.0
"The pot of gold is at the end of the rainbow. I promise you it is, well at least, Ashbox is at the end of Manhattan Ave. I just kept walking and walking and when I could see the water, I also found this charming place for lunch. How cute, quaint, cozy and oh so Brooklyn.There is a wind chime on the door and something about those things always makes moments magical. The whistling of the wind through the chimes feels mystical. This place serves up some great vegetarian Japanese options. I had some miso soup chocked full of tofu and seaweed and also an onigiri rice ball, accompanied by a nice tall iced soy latte. Excellent, refreshing light meal. The place is very charming and inviting. You could linger around here for awhile and just catch up on the daily news in the WSJ or just chat with a friend. I love that it is so close to the water. After enjoying a wonderful lunch, it is great to just go stroll along the water a bit.",5.0

There's certainly plenty of space to ""spread out for an hour"".I'm partial to the ambiance because the background music reminds me of Pilotwings 64.

I feel the need to write this even though everyone has already made it clear that this is a tiny shiny bright spot full of idiosyncrasy and delight. It makes me feel like I'm in a Miyazaki film. People read the newspaper over tea while listening to French jazz music. All of the women working wear little bonnets with flowers. The onigiri and miso soup made my heart melt. I'm happier just remembering it.,5.0

"Ashbox is a tiny little coffe-shop gem in Greenpoint. The best part about it: it's WAY more than a coffee shop. Sure, they have delicious coffee, beautiful teas, and creamy green tea lattes, but they also have an incredibly diverse (and delicious) menu of food. They even carry whole-wheat everything bagels, my personal favorite that are inexplicably hard to find. The Onigiri (brown rice balls), with salmon, kelp, or plum in the middle, all wrapped in seaweed, are AHH-mazing. The egg salad sandwich is made with free-range eggs, and is perfectly filling without being doused in mayo. Whatever you choose, it's prepared carefully and right in front of you. Even the tofu is made in-house!

great little gem in the middle of warehouses in greenpoint bk.  went here for a late brunch and it was well worth the walk over the bridge from LIC to BK.  small japanese inspired cafe.  they dont have your traditional brunch menu but the food is great.  We ordered turkey sandwich on ciabatta bread and the teriyaki pork on ciabetta bread. and both were very tasty.  i also ordered the grape vinegar healthy drink and it tasted weird it at first but it is actually pretty good! they have a broad selection of teas to choose from and they are not expensive at all.  only downside about this place is that they close early.

They make good use of soy sauce and bonito flakes, which may be why Daniel K. thought it was strange. I just thought it was flat out delicious. I ordered the turkey & scrambled eggs, served with brown rice and a salad. It was divine! Paired with the ""Japanese Puffy Bread"" (chocolate) of my schooling at Tokyo Jogakkan I was in heaven.

Don't bring your loud friends here.I only wish they were open more often (closed at 4 on Saturdays and completely on Sundays). The hot chocolate was good, but it was like 80% foam. Iced coffee was strong, just the way I like it!",4.0
"It's official:  Greenpoint is the headquarters of wonderful, adorable cafes in Brooklyn.  Ashbox is a little hideaway, tucked into the warehouses below the Pulaski Bridge.  I had the very simple, very good egg salad sandwich.  The egg salad was mixed with corn and peas, and the whole wheat bread was really hearty.  I could have stayed here all day, but I wanted to check out another place nearby.  I loved the mismatched chairs and calm music.  Definitely recommended.",4.0
"This is a classic Yelp review in which I go NO PLEASE DON'T COME HERE PLEASE because it's so quiet and quaint and makes you escape very briefly to a Japanese country cafe or something similar (do those exist??) and they have good tea and once again it is QUIET and very unlike most establishments in the neighborhood.  So, while the selfishness in me wants to give it 1 star so it can stay the way it is, I know mom&pa's need all the support they can get.  Drink your tea at Ashbox.",4.0
"i'd venture to guess that you'll never come here unless you live north of greenpoint ave. or if you live slightly south of greenpoint ave. and want to get away from it all.this place is in the middle of nowhere.  but only 3 blocks from our apartment.  so i guess we live on the outskirts of nowhere?anyhoo...it's a really cute coffeshop with wifi and some light Japanese-tinged? fare.  i don't drink coffee so i had a cup of earl grey to go.  it was piping hot and good.very nice little spot in north greenpoint.  you can grab a cup and stroll down to the utterly unpolluted, pristine Newtown Creek.  you may even see dolphins.",4.0
"I had the lunch special (teriyaki pork sandwich) and my girlfriend had a salmon rice ball with seaweed, tea and a small salad. Generally we agreed the food wad good but not great, although she loved the rice ball.",3.0
"Ashbox Breakfast is such a nice breakfast alternative- no carby bagel here. Spring greens and really well done eggs make for a perfect first meal of the day. I'd recommend having the dish with tea rather than coffee. Although their coffee is just fine, tea lends itself much better to the Japanese flavors. Really nice staff, calming environment.",4.0
"Love it, teriyaki pork sandwich is absolutely delicious! the onigiri was yummy and the ice cold glass of green tea left my palate nice and refreshed. will definitely go there again.",5.0
Perfect coffee shop when walking across the Pulaski bridge. Japanese twist and great selection of teas. The Japanese puffy bread with tea really hits the spot on a cold day.,5.0
"Food 7 + ambiance 6 + value 6 + service 5 = overall 6.5 / 10 (decent/good)Ashbox is a sentimental favorite of mine.  It grew out of the woodworker culture of old Greenpoint and opened months at least before there was any other slightly elegant eatery in northern Greenpoint.  Ashbox is quiet, warm, and calm.  It's one of few cafes at which I actually do enjoy hanging out for extended periods of time.  My favorite menu items are their tartines with butter and jam and, when they have them, their chocolate chip cookies with walnuts.",3.0
"wow. amazing. small and cozy without feeling overcrowded. i wish my apartment looked the way this place does inside- warm, light and breezy. indescribably delicious food, not terribly expensive, delicious coffee. all of this  in a tiny corner on the edge of the world (or at least the edge of greenpoint) that feels like somewhere else entirely. wonderful.",5.0
"This cafe is a real gem and I feel fortunate to have it within a block from my apartment.  The Japanese owner puts love and attention into all of the great items on  the somewhat small menu, and the daily specials and teas are wonderful.  The coffee absolutely sucks though..it's not a coffee shop and that's not what she does best.  She's also not the best at dealing with customers. She hired some nice younger people to deal with the counter though in the recent year or so, so that helps. I tend to take my food to go because I'm just not a fan of the light music and mega quiet atmosphere.  On one hand, i get it, on the other hand it's TOO quiet for a casual cafe and i hate the wind chimes on the door because I seriously feel like i'm disturbing the peace when i walk it.  For as often as i come into the place, I never feel like it's my local either, and that's a little annoying because i kind of feel like some recognition of the neighbors would be a nice thing since it's in such a small pocket of Greenpoint.  That said, though, it's the food that keeps me coming back and if i want a non-spa-like cafe atmosphere, there are two others a block away!",4.0
"Ashbox is great. Located between Ash St and Box St at teh very top of Greenpoint, Ashbox is an excellent place to get coffe, breakfast, lunch or a snack. The menu is pretty typicaly coffee house fare, but everything is prepared with a bit more care than at other places. The fruit salad has flacks of fresh mint, the waffles (for brunch) come with a ton of great fruit, not just a slice of banana, the water has a hint of lemon, etc. The space is also quite nice. It has a lived in feel without at all feeling dirty or run down (makes sense as it's a new renovation). The cedar lined bathroom is a nice touch. The prices are totally reasonable, especially for the brunch plates. The people are also exceptionally friendly.My only complaint is that I don't live closer!",5.0
This is a great place to bring your computer and appetite. Free Wi-Fi! Amazing sandwiches! Delicious coffee! Class-A joint.,5.0
"Pretty much the perfect coffeeshop. In fact, I'm writing this review from Ashbox. Free wireless, good coffee, appropriate musical selections, slightly dented furniture, sun drenched/rain drenched/open. Very cute, unpretentious, rarely too full to get a seat. Secluded location by the Pulaski. Highly recommended.",5.0
"I joined yelp to review ashbox, that's how much I love it and I completely agree with the ""perfect coffee shop"" comment below.  Although there are many wonderful coffee shops in the area of North Greenpoint, this is by far my favorite.  The coffee is great, the homemade miso soup with homemade tofu is delicious, the atmosphere is warm and inviting, it is a wonderful space for either relaxing or getting work done because the music is the perfect volume, usually classical,  light streams through the front windows during the morning and afternoon.  Visit and enjoy!",5.0
"One of the first places I discovered in Brooklyn, Ashbox makes a great place to grab a cup of tea and unwind.  There food is tasty and and varied (where else can you find a sundried tomato & brie sandwich and rice balls on the same menu) and the free wifi is an added bonus.  My only gripe about the place is that it's cash only.  But that won't stop me from going back!",5.0
"Super cute little cafe with nice light and a cool eclectic menu (homemade tofu? vegan tahini cookies? rice balls?) The peppermint iced tea comes with fresh peppermint leaves. It's got an out-of-the-way, undiscovered feel - case in point, I am writing this review at 4 pm on a weekday and am the only person in here!",5.0
