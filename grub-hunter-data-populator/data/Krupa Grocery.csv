"The minute we walked in we knew we had made the right decision for brunch....great atmosphere, super friendly staff, and every single plate on every table looked phenomenal.  Of course we were here on a mission...lemon ricotta pancakes.  Ever since having insanely good lemon ricotta pancakes at Plow in San Francisco (good enough to choose instead of breakfast at Dotties which is saying a lot) we have been on the desperate search for an NYC equivalent.  Today we finally met Plow's match...but I am getting ahead of myself. First things first I have to mentions their Bloody Mary...it is big an phenomenal and extremely reasonable at $9.  It is the first Bloody Mary I have had that can match recently closed Applewoods. It is perfectly balanced and not bitter. You can tell they use quality ingredients.  And unlike many places that try to serve you $12 mediocre 8oz bloody Mary's (yes I am talking to you Mayfield and Colonie) this is a serious 16oz Bloody Mary. The coffee is also really excellent as well AND they actually give you refills...a real test given how rare it is these days. On top of that they even gave my wife a refill on her decaf Americano.  It is small things like that that really stick out these days.  Okay so onto the food.  Obviously we got the pancakes which were incredibly moist and light and fresh...and of course served with proper real maple syrup (they don't give you enough syrup but don't hesitate to give you more when you ask...which given the cost of real maple syrup I don't blame them).  While Luluc still holds crown for best pancake (which is almost a donut at their place), this place now holds the crown for best Lemon Ricotta pancake in my book.  As you have to balance out a stack of pancakes with a protein infusion (else end up collapsing from the sugar crash), we got the lamb burger (although it was really tough to decide on that as the shrimp burger looked great too). The lamb burger was also phenomenal...real fresh and topped with the perfect balance of pickles and some secret sauce. Really excellent.  Make sure to get the fried fingerling potatoes...also really good. The whole experience was just top notch across the board.  Made me wish it was Saturday instead of Sunday so I could repeat the whole experience again tomorrow. Finally they get major props for not being cash only and taking Amex.  I also like how bill automatically has calculation for total if splitting it...a really nice touch that just further reinforces this place has their act together.  We will definitely be back very soon to try dinner.",5.0
"Our favorite place in Park Slope so far. We have been here probably 5 times now and every single time we get the same dishes and they are always, always, amazing. I get the farro salad, it's always perfectly balanced with the sprouts, pecans and apples! One of my favorite salads ever. My wife always gets the steak. The steak is always cooked perfectly to our medium rare standard and the bone marrow is always amazing. Wish they could double the bone marrow portion though! My son always gets the lamb burger and fries. He eats it all!!  Again, every single time the food is amazing and the service is great. I have only tried one of their many beers and it was really good. They have some decent house wines on tap. The one thing I would improve is their dessert selection. Last time we were there they had a chocolate cake concoction that not even my 9 year old chocolate addict could eat past the first bite. We mentioned this and were not charged for it. I can't remember the name of the dessert we used to love but I think it was a flourless chocolate cake that came in a mason jar. Like a mousse! That was great!Prices are fair for the area.",5.0
"I wandered into this place on a Saturday night after  catching a movie at the nearby Pavillion and was so pleasantly surprised! Dinner and drinks were delicious! I highly recommend the flank steak.... cooked to perfection and paired with some really great sides. We also had one of the cheeses, the salami, and an additional appetizer that were all perfect. I recommend the sangiovese and the honey brown beer (though I warn it's served in glass with a stem so you must be secure in your masculinity)The service and atmosphere were also quite pleasing. I'll definitely be coming back again soon.",5.0
"I have visited this place twice. The first time was when I was looking for breakfast on a weekend. We went here because it was open at 7am, but their kitchen was closed on the weekend. It was a sad trek since we weren't from the area. The place is beautifully decorated. And the bathroom is beautiful, which is their redeeming quality, plus the waitstaff. They were very attentive. We decided to go back for dinner. Their menu looked pretty interesting and we thought we were going to get exotic dishes, as their food had cool names. We ordered the shishitos and fingerling potatoes, which were pretty much basic dishes that were hipsterfied into high prices. When the food arrived, I was so disappointed. There are a ton of restaurants out there with lower prices and amazing flavor. The mussels and mushroom ragu gnocchi came out, as well. Mushroom ragu was not worth it. The gnocchi had a nice taste, but was overdone. The mussels were a great portion, perhaps the best thing to get here and came with some toast for dipping in the sauce. If you're in the neighborhood, you may want to check it out, but it is not worth the travel time.",3.0
Amazing food and menu is updated regularly which keeps me coming back (but please never get rid of the fingerlings!). Also great drinks selection and fabulous wines on tap. I would give it 5 stars but I think the brunch portions could be slightly larger and I don't want this place to become too popular! Also wish the kitchen was open later!!,4.0
"Brunch has become a favorite past time of mine on the weekends and I'm always looking for a cute little neighborhood spot that not only has quality food and but good coffee too. This definitely fit the bill! I'm new to the neighborhood so it was nice to feel very welcomed and comfortable in a new place. I went on a Sunday and we beat the rush before noon, which I would advise as it seemed to get pretty packed around then. They also can take reservations too if you are planning ahead. I'm a sweets girl and always want a waffle or pancake if given the choice...so of course I got the ricotta pancakes! Oh my word...so good! But also, who can finish all of this? Especially after getting an appetizer of chicken wings with white BBQ sauce. yum!! I know I know...my eyes are always bigger than my stomach. I hate wasting food too, so I advise bringing along a friend to share in these delights! Mine happened to get the breakfast gnocchi, which was fantastic! Overall, lovely brunch spot I plan to visit much more in the future!",5.0
"Had a amazing meal here after running the Rock n Roll Brooklyn half marathon!  13.1 miles will give you a heck of an appetite as you can imagine. We beat most of the rush and were lucky to be seated right away. I forget our servers name sadly but she was very friendly and attentive the whole time. She offered to put in an appetizer for us while we looked at drinks. I had a blood orange mimosa and my friend had a cider. We picked out two cheeses for a starter while waiting in breakfast. Out meal entrees were quite spectacular; breakfast gnocchi and lemon ricotta pancakes. The gnocchi was served with crisp bacon bits, spinach and a squash purée topped with a fried egg. Well composed flavored, and great presentation. The bite of lemon ricotta pancakes I had was also awesome! I could see pieces of ricotta in the pancakes the the blueberry compote on top really complimented the dish. If in Brooklyn again I would definitely return here for breakfast.",5.0

"I like this place. Krupa boasts an interesting and original menu, and their food is much, much more elegant than any neighborhood restaurant really has any right to be serving. Windsor Terrace is so lucky.As with a few restaurants in this brave new world, sometimes they get cuter with their flavor combinations than one might like.* But overall, we've enjoyed nearly everything they've put in front of us (mussels, chicken & the egg, monkfish, bass, pastas, gnudi, roasted beets, soups, shrimp & grits). Not even being seated next to my friends' parents for a surprise awkward double date could ruin our meal here.** Personally, I hope they bring back the burrata dish with the warm weather, and then they'll never get rid of me. _____________*The gnudi on the fall menu was one of the best things I've ever tasted, and the winter gnudi didn't quite work for my palate.**Just kidding, I like you guys better than your sons.",5.0
"Was in the area with a big group and needed some brunch grub. It was a beautiful day and we stumbled into Krupa Grocery as they had an open back space to sit outside.I had a mason jar of bloody mary ($9) which was decent but not much to it. It didn't come with celery or any typical green either, just a small wedge of lemon. They also offer several craft beer taps and local wines.The wings appetizer were crispy and tender with a creamy sauce likened to a mini soup on the side. 7 wings per order ($11) sprinkled with some greens, shaved radish, and shishito peppers.However, the food was explained as it being a la carte so the mains did not come with any sides. However, they portion the sides larger for sharing. It was great for a group but not so sure about coming here if I lived in the neighborhood by myself due to this odd setup.The salt/vinegar and curry fingerling potatoes side was $7 and tasty but as I said, portioned as a side enough for 2 or 3 to share.The skate po'boy sandwich was the star of the show. Crispy and flaky, topped with pickles and a remoulade sauce with a new pickle on the side is just an explosion of flavor and perfect for a warm spring weekend.The food was fresh and inventive with a breezy outdoor seating with a full view of the the above tenants dry their underwear along the clothesline is kind of very ""Brooklyn."" Along with its great location by the park and friendly service it is a place I would like to check out again when I am in the area.",4.0
"this is the cutest most chillest delicious little spot i've found in a long while.stopped in for a drink and a snack late afternoon and was super pleased.white gazpacho for me, egg toast with babaganoush for my sister. mine was a delight, i didn't get to try hers because she inhaled it.i liked the outdoor patio seating, we chilled and drank and chatted for a while - service was attentive but they didn't bother or rush us either.can't wait to come back for brunch!!",5.0
"This place is by our new apartment, so based on the reviews (and the exterior we passed by often) we came in.  Again, I was sick, so I can't speak for the beer list (though it was impressive), the ambiance was very chill.  I got the mussels, which were really different than the usual and nice and spicy and thick.  The mountain of toasted bread was perfect for dunking.  Boyfriend got a lamb burger, not our usual, but it was pretty awesome and spot on.  The fries are magical, thick and still crispy.  It's  not our normal type of place, but to get something a little different or just some bar snacks and a beer, it seems to be a good spot.",4.0
"I have been to Krupa many times and I have never been disappointed. This weekend was no exception.

"Let me get this checkmarked right off the bat : KITCHEN IS CLOSED ON TUESDAY. You can come in for a drink, hot or cold beverage or a small snack to spend the time but do not expect a meal.  After paying a visit to Krupa Grocery twice, my opinion of this fantastic , fairly new Park Slope treasure is cemented in my book. Not to say it wasn't cemented after the first visit; it was. I just wanted to cement it some more to be REALLY sure. You know how it could be sometimes with our fickle minds and hearts. I was impressed with this addition right off the bat and so far, the people I have brought here with me or  have recommended it to have been very happy themselves. What I like :- Awesome space and ambience. Yes, it kind of does work within the narrow scope of what a 'trendy' Brooklyn restaurant is nowadays but it's done tastefully. I like their minimalist style a great deal.- The outdoor beer-gardenesque benches out back are nifty.- Craft beer selection is pretty decent, in the 6-7 range and on rotation; the coffee is AWESOME (and I'm picky to the point of rarely drinking coffee I didn't prepare myself)- Service has , thus far, been very friendly and attentive. I have never been here when it's busy. Both times were either for lunch or an early dinner- The menu changed in-between my visits spanning a month and a half. I enjoy this part of any restaurant, when it's employed.  Surprises = fun! Now, on the topic of the food; I commend every aspect of it. The schnitzel sandwich was heroic;  the pickle and the pickled onion just made a for a good old time. I was devastated when I didn't see it on the menu my second go around, but recovered rather quickly. The mussels were among my favorite, and I'm talking either #1 or #2  , of my favorite mussels in Brooklyn. The white wine sauce was so flavorful and of spot-on consistency that I inhaled four more pieces of bread just to get that sauce in me some more. The pancetta was delicious with perfectly crisped bacon, not interfering with a soft interior. I truly believe you can't go wrong with this restaurant and it's quickly become one of my new favorites in this area and Brooklyn as a whole.",5.0
"Outstanding!  Everything about this place was great.  I had two rye Manhattans- perfectly made with Mitcher's Rye.  We shared the blistered peppers and a flatbread.  We each had the mussels (on the recommendation of good authority) and they were some of the best, if not the best I have ever had.  We shared a cheesecake dessert as well.  The service was superb - attentive without being on top of you.  Price wise everything is more than reasonable.  I'll be back and maybe I'll see you there.  Salute.",5.0

"I've been to Krupa three times, and twice in the past week - it's that good. The food is simply delicious. Let me tell you about three dishes:The gnudi. My god, the gnudi. Each bite is pretty much perfect, and way richer than any dish has a right to be with so little meat. I've had this twice and would order this every time if I wasn't worried about burning out on it. Order this and you will be happy.The breakfast gnocchi. I know people have raved about the breakfast gnocchi in reviews and it's a great dish. Note that it's not a little bit of beet greens, but a good amount that flavors it all. I'm not a biggest fan of beet stems (they remind me too much of chard stems) so that was a bummer.The beef tongue charcuterie. This isn't on the winter menu, but I had it as an appetizer in the fall and it was melt in your mouth amazing. I really hope they bring this back because I can't imagine a better way to start a meal.I'm pretty excited to try more of the menu the next time I'm there!",5.0
"I have now been to Krupa Grocery for lunch and dinner and was eminently satisfied both times. The menu food is limited, which I like because it makes choosing easier.  The beverage menu on the other hand is extensive, although both times, there were beer options listed that were not available. No worries, the very friendly and helpful waitstaff got samples of similar beverages from the bar so we could try prior to ordering. The decor is comfy and the music selection is great. The shrimp burger with seaweed salad and Korean cabbage is not to be missed, same with the sea salt caramel pot de creme. And the squash ""fries"" are pretty dynamite too. My only complaint is pricing - it's not outrageous but for $14 a burger, I don't want to have to pay an extra $3 for my fries, even if they are fingerlings and very tasty, especially at lunch. It just seems wrong. And that pot de creme is $10, pretty steep. But it's so delicious I'll order it again and again.",4.0
"Ate here a year ago on last visit and returned this trip with a few local friends to show them the place. The menu changed a little but all the dishes were well received and shared among 6 folks. Ate in the backyard which is now finished and a lovely outdoor space on a summer evening.The mussels were the best I've ever had, the sauce a tomato based melted pancetta purée required us to ask for more toast to gobble up every drop. They had a baby turnip dish that also required two orders so everyone could sample more. I ate the steak which came with a huge salty bone full of creamy marrow on a potato purée. I don't drink alcohol (anymore, but believe me I know my booze) but the aperitifs were quite well received and the wine on tap, while not appropriate for a Californian sensibility, was also well received by the other diners. We ate every appetizer too so no room for desert, but those deviled eggs were desert! The theme of freshly made house pickles kept popping into dishes and was a unique string that continued thru several dishes.My guests were quite content, the wallet was not hit hard at all either. I still can't believe this place opened in the old hood. What a change, it's like Manhattan in the Terrace now!! Highly recommend you check it out.Oh noticed baby changing station in the restroom this time, that explains all the Mommies with prams flocking there for morning coffee I saw one day.

"In the former lovely Indian newsstand, opened Krupa Grocery in their namesake. Around the corner from my former abode, magic happens in the kitchen. This is new Brooklyn and the best of it. As I was sitting waiting for my food, I watched the kitchen action and just knew, this would be special. The menu is varied and eclectic.Brazino- $28Salt & vinegar potatoes- $10Burnt sugar pot de crème $10Brazino was bathed in chilies, vegetable stock served with preserved lemons and blistered tomatoes- complex & finger lickin' good. The potatoes were hot, salty & a bit  naughty tasting of Spanish origins and a perfect co-plate. To finish the pot de crème with crème fraiche on top and a house made biscotti. Less crème fraiche would allow the butterscotch notes of this lovely desert to shine through and the great bite of the housemade biscotti. One suggestion would be to serve bread from Brooklyn, there is so much greatness locally and put it on the table, cause with a $28 main, bread should be automatic otherwise, this restaurant is far more than a local spot!",4.0
"what a gem... Great food, excellent service and amazing coffee.Brunch was amazing, started with a roasted beet salad which was amazing it came with a very light yogurt sauce which added an awesome layer of creaminess. I got the egg gnocchi which melted in my mouth. egg was perfectly cooked great saltiness from the tiny bits of panchetta  and the toasted breadcrumbs put the whole dish together. On the other side of the table was sunny side up eggs with Andouille sausage and grits just the way it sounds yummmmmmyyyyy...... service was great, water and coffee was refilled without a peep.

I spent about 50% of my meal without a drink, and had to spend as much time focusing on finding a waitress to get me another as I did on how good the food was.Krupa also provides communal tables that they don't tell you are communal tables: four-tops out back that end up seating two couples. Had I realized that they were communal, I would have requested a table inside. I understand the thought and necessity behind communal tables, but the bottom line is that I don't care to hear a stranger's take on the cost of living in San Francisco or his/her opinion on the (diminishing) relevance of American Apparel.

"The only really good meal I've eaten in Windsor Terrace where I've resided for 5 years. Windsor Terrace food ranges from bearable to simply disgusting. So I'm super pleased, I hope it remains consistent. We had the liver pate deviled egg, the hangar steak, and the incredible mussels. Really above average mussels in a lamb, chili paste, white wine broth. 4 stars as 5 is reserved for a meal so orgasmic it can't be described in a forum such as Yelp.",4.0
"Full disclosure, my group and I know an investor in the restaurant, but when they made top 10 best new restaurants, had to finally try.  It is a small place, but they fit all 14 of us last weekend on a busy Friday.  Perfect for a winters night! Firstly, service was excellent.  Very attentive, great suggestions on beer, wine and what to get (cause there is so much yumminess).  Didn't rush us and handled our chatty crowd with no stress or mess ups.We probably ended up ordering the entire menu and everyone was happy.  Apps were good, but entrees were the stand outs.  I got their play on gnocchi - loved.  Pork belly was a HUGE hit, as was the burger.  Tried the steak, sauce was delicious.The only negative was a handful of my husband's muscles didn't open, but the broth was soooo good, paired with country bread, who cares?  Cheeses were a very small portion too, but nice choices.Great wine options and beer.Can't wait to go in the summer!  Have a cute outdoor space and I love the communal table concept personally.Kudos!",5.0
"I've been here twice and my general impression is that it's hit or miss, but mostly hit.  The first time I went I was with 3 other people and we got a bunch of things and shared.  We liked almost all of them (although the roasted peas and risotto balls were meh) and we all agreed nothing we got was bad.  We also agreed it was pricy but overall worth it for a once-in-a-while type meal. The second time, I was with two different people who both got the lamb burger and liked it, although one ordered it well done and it was pink inside.  I got the smoked eggplant and thought it was pretty bad.  I knew the smoke flavor would be prevalent, but it was overpowering and lingered in my mouth for an hour afterwards.  The dish supposedly had other subtle flavors in it such as coriander, mint, and cucumber, but they were almost completely overpowered by the smoke flavor.  The only other flavor that came through was the mustard in the sauce on the bottom of the plate.  For me, a whole dish worth of smoke and mustard flavor is not a good thing. Only a few weeks had passed between my two visits and the menu had changed quite a bit, which normally I'd say is nice but considering the big ""miss"" I had the second time and the couple ""meh""s from the first time, maybe they should spend less time thinking of new menu items and more time perfecting what's on the current menu.Service was good both times despite being at the farthest table outside.  They even brought out complementary bug spray when needed during my first visit.",3.0
"This place is amazing. We went Saturday, and sadly arrived in the hour between shifts when the kitchen is closed (4-5pm on Sat only), but I was determined to eat here. So we waited. At 5:01pm we ordered the pickled eggs with pate, so so so good. The delicata squash fries were good (we happen to make delicata squash at home whenever we can find it, so this was good but the squash is so easy and delicious it's hard to mess up). And the lamb burger, wow. Cooked perfectly, full of flavor, excellent! The space is cool too, very nice bar with wine on tap, I love that! Oh and the pickles, they do lots of pickles we had 4 or 5 different kinds and they were all so different and delicious. The sweet one that came with the burger has my heart. Cannot wait to come back!",5.0
"WOW, do I wish we had a place like this in Park Slope - - A place that serves comfort food in an upmarket setting, keeping the strollers at bay and allowing for easy conversation while chowing down on boiled peants and possibly the best lamb burger I've ever had in my life.- A place where the staff is knowledgable about their wines without being prissy (and serving a Gobelsburger Rose TRUST me, they know from good wines).- A place with a sense of humor as well as a sense of style, in the Upper East Side of Brooklyn... a neighborhood just under the radar enough for those in the know to still be able to walk in and find a seat available any time.- A place you can walk out of at midgnight sated, and walk into at dawn hungry.This is what Stone Park Cafe wants to be but isn't, what Blue Ribbon was without the price tag and baggage, what Ozzie's tried to be for a while.It's worth the long walk for me. Can't wait to go back.",4.0
"Absolutely delicious, well-flavored food. Excellent service. The only down side is that it's quite loud and a bit cramped. We had risotto balls and shishito peppers as appetizers, both fabulous. My Arctic Char was crispy skinned and creamy inside, so good. My husband's steak was perfectly cooked, marinated and thinly sliced. The waiter very sweetly indulged my desire to mix bubbly and tap water. He really seemed to care that we loved our food and had a satisfying dining experience. It's not cheap, but worth every penny for a special night out.",4.0

"My group went for dinner, and with the six of us, we pretty much ordered everything on the menu. And *everything* was a hit. Sitting in the secluded outdoor patio, we were well-attended during our leisurely dinner. A refreshing summer sparking negroni. Blistered shishito peppers. The mussels were universally loved (extra toast was needed to sop up the sauce). The three country toasts sound simple but tasted oh-so-good (smokey babaganoush, earthy peas). And my gnudi - oh the gnudi! Light but not too light, perfect dressing. I'm a vegetarian and there were many options -- easily labeled on the menu. Although Windsor Terrace isn't the easiest for me to get to, I'll be back.",5.0
"The staff here are for the most part pills. Like, not nice hipster wanna be meanies. Honestly, if I wanted that much attitude I'd a headed to W'berg. Come on Park Slope, be a little more critical of your service and make way for nice people to go with the great product this place offers.",2.0
"My friend and I stopped by for Sunday brunch. It was busy but we were seated quickly which was nice.I ordered a coffee and they had ALMOND milk which I haven't been able to find anywhere else. Kudos!We had the plate of meat with some different pickles, eggs pickled in beet juice with pate, and random yumminess and a salad to start. We ordered the ricotta pancakes and pork belly in grits for our mains. The food was great! I already love ricotta pancakes but these came with a rhubarb jam which I never had before but really made them stand out. The pork belly and grits were delicious as well. The pork belly still had some of the fat on it and it just melted in your mouth. I think this place is new so it's great that the place fits the area and food is awesome. I will def be going back for dinner.",5.0

And the lamb burger, wow. Cooked perfectly, full of flavor, excellent! The space is cool too, very nice bar with wine on tap, I love that! Oh and the pickles, they do lots of pickles we had 4 or 5 different kinds and they were all so different and delicious. The sweet one that came with the burger has my heart. Cannot wait to come back!",5.0
"WOW, do I wish we had a place like this in Park Slope - - A place that serves comfort food in an upmarket setting, keeping the strollers at bay and allowing for easy conversation while chowing down on boiled peants and possibly the best lamb burger I've ever had in my life.- A place where the staff is knowledgable about their wines without being prissy (and serving a Gobelsburger Rose TRUST me, they know from good wines).- A place with a sense of humor as well as a sense of style, in the Upper East Side of Brooklyn... a neighborhood just under the radar enough for those in the know to still be able to walk in and find a seat available any time.- A place you can walk out of at midgnight sated, and walk into at dawn hungry.This is what Stone Park Cafe wants to be but isn't, what Blue Ribbon was without the price tag and baggage, what Ozzie's tried to be for a while.It's worth the long walk for me. Can't wait to go back.",4.0
"Absolutely delicious, well-flavored food. Excellent service. The only down side is that it's quite loud and a bit cramped. We had risotto balls and shishito peppers as appetizers, both fabulous. My Arctic Char was crispy skinned and creamy inside, so good. My husband's steak was perfectly cooked, marinated and thinly sliced. The waiter very sweetly indulged my desire to mix bubbly and tap water. He really seemed to care that we loved our food and had a satisfying dining experience. It's not cheap, but worth every penny for a special night out.",4.0
100th review yeah ! One of the best place to eat in Brooklyn. The backyard is so calm and really nice for the sunny days! Are you looking for a farm to table? Just go there and enjoy!,5.0
"My group went for dinner, and with the six of us, we pretty much ordered everything on the menu. And *everything* was a hit. Sitting in the secluded outdoor patio, we were well-attended during our leisurely dinner. A refreshing summer sparking negroni. Blistered shishito peppers. The mussels were universally loved (extra toast was needed to sop up the sauce). The three country toasts sound simple but tasted oh-so-good (smokey babaganoush, earthy peas). And my gnudi - oh the gnudi! Light but not too light, perfect dressing. I'm a vegetarian and there were many options -- easily labeled on the menu. Although Windsor Terrace isn't the easiest for me to get to, I'll be back.",5.0
"The staff here are for the most part pills. Like, not nice hipster wanna be meanies. Honestly, if I wanted that much attitude I'd a headed to W'berg. Come on Park Slope, be a little more critical of your service and make way for nice people to go with the great product this place offers.",2.0
"My friend and I stopped by for Sunday brunch. It was busy but we were seated quickly which was nice.I ordered a coffee and they had ALMOND milk which I haven't been able to find anywhere else. Kudos!We had the plate of meat with some different pickles, eggs pickled in beet juice with pate, and random yumminess and a salad to start. We ordered the ricotta pancakes and pork belly in grits for our mains. The food was great! I already love ricotta pancakes but these came with a rhubarb jam which I never had before but really made them stand out. The pork belly and grits were delicious as well. The pork belly still had some of the fat on it and it just melted in your mouth. I think this place is new so it's great that the place fits the area and food is awesome. I will def be going back for dinner.",5.0
"Re: my previous review, I got a nice note from the owner acknowledging the mistake. As I said, the rest of my experience was a good one save for that blip. If I'm back in the neighborhood, I may stop by Krupa after all. The food was great and it's a wonderful Brooklyn atmosphere.",4.0
Had brunch here today and it did not disappoint. The coffee brew was strong (with constant refills) and their grilled cheese was perfection. Will definitely return for more!,4.0
"No food between 4 and 5, at least on Sunday whenI was there. Yet they will plunk a food menu in front of you and never say you can't order anything.  There were a lot of staff people working when we walked in and any one of them could have informed us about this food break. Not until, sitting at the bar, when we tried to order food were we informed that we're here during the hour that nonsensically no food is served.Beer and wine selection is good if that's all  you're going for. besides that's do not like this place. Like it less and less each time I go.",2.0
"The 4.5 stars was what got us here. Another time when yelp has failed us. Over toasted buns which took forever to come. When we requested to change the buns, the waiter gave us a black face as black as the buns. Oh, should I mentioned this happened almost half year ago. For me to come and write a review after this period means how badly memorable the experience was.",1.0
"Came here for Happy hour after work and they have beers on tap for about $4. Pretty good deal. Owner and waitstaff are nice. Had their po boy sandwich which was good and big. I had a taste of their fried chicken sandwich which was the same thing but the fish tastes better. Also had their almond croissant, which was not house made. Do not recommend.",4.0
"I lived in NYC for ten years, and I think I just found the best brunch I've had in my decade of living here. Krupa Grocery's brunch is out of this world. My favorite dish is the breakfast gnocchi. It's an explosion of flavors, textures and fun surprises like delicious panko flakes galore.

"So far, not so good. Sitting here for the third time and yet more service issues. 10 minutes for drinks on a slow afternoon? Server doesn't realize we don't have our drinks or why? Disorganized and slow considering how many staff members are on right now and the inside is nearly empty. Food is good, but some if the combinations really makes it seem as though someone in the kitchen is trying too hard. Maybe just try making food that's approachable.  Strawberries with haricot vert and truffle vinaigrette? Trying too hard. Also, burrata is not a main course. Decor?

"Really enjoyed our recent dinner here. Great ambience and a small outdoor area in the back which wasn't open yet but looked really cute. We had a cheese plate of two cheeses, both very good. I had the lamb burger (very lamby, slightly gamy but in a good way), hubs had the fried skate (solid).",4.0

"Love the fresh and quality ingredients used in their dishes. It was our 3rd trip here. Today, we started with country toast with peas and fava bean spread, and the cod fish fritters. The cod fish fritters were nice and crispy on the outside while still creamy inside. The country toast had a great sweet freshness from the pureed favas and peas. Our entrees were the roasted stripe bass and the hangar steak with bone marrow. Both were perfectly seered and seasoned. Hard to choose which was better. For dessert, we had both a chocolate parfait with cherries, and a cheesecaje topped with warm blueberries. Both were spot on. The atmosphere is unpretentious and casual, with great selections in tap. Had a kamboucha infused with lemongrass, and also a raspberry beer. My friends and family all love this place.",5.0

"I love what they did with this space. The transformation is amazing. We went for brunch and it was good. The portions were pretty small and it seemed quite expensive for what we actually got. The menu feels very limited and small. Pork belly, lamb, liver...along those lines. Eh. I have heard a few people in the neighborhood say they didn't like menu, I could see why. There are also no kid friendly dishes for people with kids. The service was ok but a bit awkward. Assuming they are just adjusting. I hope they modify or add to their menu a bit, and really hope they do well. This neighborhood needs good restaurants.9/19...update. We have gone back a few times and I wanted to update this review because the food is really excellent at this place. The atmosphere is great and Iced Coffee is amazing. I think the only problem with this place is what you get for the price. Its very expensive and small to decent portion sized but nothing on the side, not even a few greens. Some of the dinners are almost appetizer size. I have no problem paying for good food, but the portion size and price is a little out of whack here.

"i just went here for brunch and it was the best brunch I've had in a while. we walked in and got a table immediately (around 1:40pm). it was surprisingly child-free for a park slope area establishment. i sampled everything on the table we ordered. here it is, in sequence:i had my doubts about the iced green tea because it was ""with mango"" but the waitress assured me it was unsweetened. it was refreshing and i was happy that it was quite light on the mango flavor (if not imperceivable). my friend's bloody maria had a smokey salted rim (winning detail) and a nice balance of horseradish and other spices with a stalk of celery. we were delivered an appetizer of cod croquettes ON THE MF'ing HOUSE!! (it's not even my birthday!?)  these were tasty fried spherical fish cakes with a slight crunch on the outside in a lemon sauce with wispy greens. the camembert arrived with two pieces of bread and some preserves. a nice piece of cheese. if you like camembert, you won't be disappointed.the grilled cheese appeared glistening from pan frying, with perfectly melted cheddar cheese (?) in the middle along w jam, crispy bacon, and oiled micro lettuce. the most appealing part (to me) was the crispy cheese on some of the exterior of the bread (that perhaps oozed out of the middle and crisped while cooking). the bread was both firm and soft at once, and appropriately crusty. this dish was served on a wooden board with pickles and pickled radishes. my boyf has called this the best grilled cheese he's ever had.i ordered the PEI mussels. they were garlicky in a reddish, mildly spicy broth with occasional salty bites of pancetta. the sichuan peppercorns were not overwhelming but definitely present, an interesting twist. the mussels are served with grilled bread drizzled olive oil, perfect for dipping into the broth. mussels with bread  are far superior to mussels with french fries, amirite? our waitress said this is her favorite dish and i see why. i'd definitely order this again.lord child, the ricotta lemon pancakes though! it tasted like they came with a raspberry sauce but it was actually plum. it is almost like a dessert, while not overly sweet, but definitely decadent. my friend can be a light eater, and threw in the towel after eating only half and I finished the rest after eating my entire portion of mussels--they are that good! a must!the service was attentive without being invasive. our waitress was adorable and knowledgeable.  as soon as we finished drinks, we were offered refills. empty dishes were immediately cleared. when someone left the table mid-meal, they returned to find their napkin folded. we were warmly greeted when we entered and thanked for our patronage upon leaving. the manager (?) owner (?) checked in with us to see how we were enjoying our meal. holy shit, customer service.i will be returning for many more brunches and bringing friends for dinner! get it south brooklyn!",5.0

"I cannot say enough good things about Krupa.  I've been three separate times and I've always been impressed with their food.  The beer cheese toast, the lamb burger, and the mussels were all divine.  Furthermore, the ambiance is lovely and intimate, and the changing menu makes each visit unique.  You can't go wrong here!",5.0

Service was very good and I'm glad that the manager brought our second round.  Great addition to the neighborhood!",5.0

"This is exactly the kind of place I keep lamenting that we don't have in Park Slope. The food was fantastic and the service was so friendly. I had a dinner date here with my 10-year-old who fell in love with the rice balls and the cod fritters.  I was head over heels for the chicken liver pate in the pickled eggs.  And the sausage and sauerkraut with cheese toast were perfect on an arctic night.

"You guys probably thought my reviewing days were over. SO DID I!...until my boyfriend moved to South Slope and Krupa Grocery came into my life.I have been to this place at LEAST five times since they've opened, often in the span of 14 hours--because I just like them that much. It's easy to look at their menu and think they're probably overdoing the weird food combination thing, but they're really not. Krupa is a cozy, unpretentious neighborhood spot with lovely people and yummy food.Here are the Cliff-notes:-Everyone who works there is super attractive and super nice.-You can go there for hot morning beverages and pastries; weekend brunch delights; as well as lunch and dinner fare. It's a resto for all seasons.-Some people have complained that there's no menu on their website. That has been resolved, although you should know that it changes quite a bit.-They have lots of good beer, a good amount of decent wine, and very little in the way of girlie fruity fancy cocktails.

Get a glass of the lambrusco instead.-Most everything I've had there is great. BUT if you get nothing else, you should absolutely get the gnudi (dinner) or the gnocchi (brunch). They taste like getting a warm hug. They sell out all the time, and once you try them, you'll understand why. The Chicken & the Egg starter is also delicious, and I've enjoyed the chocolate brioche French toast, hanger steak, and Montauk squid to great success.Worth a visit if you're in the neighborhood!

"Really think Krupa Grocery is a solid four and a half stars, but Yelp doesn't allow half-star ratings, so four it is.My wife and I have visited perhaps five times so far and we intend to keep on visiting. We like the food, the ambiance, the general ""feel"" of the place, and the service has been quite good.So what's not to like (i.e., why didn't I rate it five stars)? Well, we each had a Bloody Mary on a couple of visits. The first time we had them they were quite good - nice spice, nice kick, tasty. However, the second time we tried them, they were seriously oversalted and had too much of one of the ingredients (not sure which one). It was as if the person making the Bloody Mary mix got interrupted while doing it, couldn't remember whether he/she had already added the spices and the salt, and went ahead and added them again. This kind of inconsistency is unfortunate.Another miss for us is their refusal to post their menus online. We mentioned to the bartender on one visit that it would be nice to be able to review the menus online, and he said, ""You're preaching to the converted. I've suggested that several times but the owner just doesn't seem interested in doing that."" Finally, Krupa is, to us, somewhat overpriced. Glasses of wine are ~$12, a lot for a neighborhood place. The menu does show lower priced vat wines by the glass, but on a couple of our visits those less expensive wines weren't available. And because the menu items are strictly a la carte, if you want a side dish you have to order it separately. As a result it's easy to run the old tab up pretty quickly.Thus the four stars instead of five.For the most part, though, these are quibbles. The food is good, the service is friendly, and the place itself is comfortable and inviting. It has nice, clean lines, and the tables and the bar are well laid out. It's a pleasurable place to while away a couple of hours, and you'll enjoy a good meal as you mingle with your neighbors.

"Finally.  Thank you Krupa Grocery for breaking through as the first true destination place on Prospect Park West (not counting Double Windsor, a great bar indeed).  Have been a couple of times for lunch and finally went for dinner.  Have yet to be disappointed.  Highlights have been cavatelli with lamb bolognese peas and mint, squid with watermelon and chilies, gnudi with chard, butterscotch pot de creme (suprisingly not too sweet which was perfect), and crispy pork belly with coddled egg grits and chilies.  All perfectly cooked and delicious.  Only slight misfire was skate sandwich whose bread/fish ratio favored the bread a bit too much, but this is nitpicking a bit.

I really enjoy trying new wines here, and they always have a good selection of craft beers on tap. If you're into cocktails, the bartenders can cater to all tastes. Some of my favorite menu items have been the steak served with a generous portion of marrow, the gnudi (which changes seasonally), mussels, blistered shishito peppers, and the pot de creme. They always have a salad or two on the menu, and my favorite was one that included strawberries this past summer. Finally, their baristas are not messing around and always pour a perfect espresso. If you're into iced tea, get the Mango Mate - it's super refreshing.",5.0
"This is an amazing addition to the neighborhood. Chef Dom is phenomenal and everything he puts out is top notch. The patio is perfect for date night and all the staff is friendly, accommodating, personable and make you want to come back! Enjoy!",5.0
"Amazing. Simply amazing. I ordered the Ricotta Eggs on Toast with chili honey sauce, and it was fantastic. They also make their own corn beef hash, which is an accomplishment in itself. And second, it was the best corn beef hash my (self-titled) food critic friend has ever had. The service was great, and the server even poured us new waters when he handed us the check. He and this place get an A++ in my book.",5.0
"The food and service are great--4.5 stars. I had the lamb burger--surprisingly light in texture, with a decadent sauce. My husband had the pork belly. Very creative menu. Nice drink options. Wish the burger came at least with salad in addition to the cucumber; it would help justify the price.",5.0
We stopped by for a latte and a hot chocolate.  Both were served in a glass. Both were lukewarm. The latte came with an espresso spoon that almost disappeared in the liquid. The atmosphere at Krupa is so pleasant that you don't want to leave. Even lukewarm beverages don't change that. We would happily have stayed another half hour if we didn't have to meet friends.,3.0
"I really liked this place. The waitress was really nice and helpful. I had some type of fish sandwich which came with a pickle (but for the price, I wish it came with a side) and some iced coffee. Both were good. We sat outside which was really pleasant. I would go back next time I'm in the area.",5.0
The only bad thing I can see was the stupid bee trying to get to my mussels!  The mussels and codfish fritters were amazing...the seasoning was on point and amazing.  The staff was very attentive and made recommendations.  Nice selections of beers on tap and wines.  The backyard area is perfect for a nice evening of drinking and dining.  Truly a great addition to the neighborhood!,5.0
"Went in one morning for a cup of coffee to go. I ignored for a good 15 minutes. I was eventually given a cup of coffee but the containers for milk on the counter were empty. Once I was given a little milk, I tasted the coffee out on the street. Luckily, I was standing right next to the public trash can because that's exactly where that cup of coffee went. I have never tasted anything worse. 8 hour old, burnt coffee, found at the bottom of a pot in someone's office would taste better. That's how bad it was.",1.0
I can't wait for this place to open for dinner. Lovely people and really delicious food. They even have an outdoor patio!,5.0
"Had the Skate Sandwich and the Salt and Vinegar Fingerlings. Both were executed brilliantly and the Skate was super fresh with a crispy crust.They also have amazing things on tap from Ice tea to Cocktails to excellent sours and Brooklyn's finest craft beers (e.g. Other Half)However, the best thing I had was the espresso. The coffee they use is amazingly roasted and the flavor was tremendous. I can't say I have had an espresso as flavorful as this. So go for the food and drink but do not leave without having an espresso.",5.0
"Have to give a shout out to one of my all-time favorite restaurants!  The food is sooo amazing here and its practically steps away from my apt that it's becoming a serious problem for me.  I want to eat every meal here.  I kid you not, everything I've tried here is on-point and the service is always top notch.",5.0
"Definitely one of the top restaurants in Park Slope - shall we go to Stone Park, Applewood, Talde or Krupa?    This place has the menu, the execution and a pretty great staff.  Lamb burger (which does not taste like lamb btw) is pure crack - a simple preparation on a brioche.  Mussels are great, cod fritters on a warm summer day are divine, lemon ricotta pancakes were simple and delicious.  Moderate portions overall and IMO moderate prices (if you've priced out fresh food and rent lately).  So appetizers are a must if you re hungry.  No dessert here, i've been meaning to ask if they plan on it in the future.  Cocktails - nothing short of fantastic.  I will say best classic cocktails in park slope, i have not really tried any of their signature libations so i cannot yet comment.  The little wine i have tasted was quite good.  Beer - decent selection of local and microbrews...plus Guinness.   And lots of unusual on tap items that change regularly.  Actually, a lot of things change regularly which is awesome for regulars.",5.0
Totally delicious! Had the Agnolotti with goat cheese and sheep's milk ricotta and hazelnut panko. I could eat it every day! Can't wait to go back and try some more dishes and their new cocktail menu.,5.0
really like this place much needed on PPW- great food and good wine.. BUT the bartender ( the female  one) is the most sullen bartender i have ever encountered..also- me and my friend had 4 rounds of drinks and not one buy back...seriously?,3.0

Portions were tiny for the price. Over complicated brunch and one of the worst bloody's I've ever experienced. Might be good for dinner but takes itself too seriously brunch-wise. Won't make this mistake again.,2.0
"Hands down the best restaurant in the neighborhood. Excellent food, great craft beer taps and cocktails, and high-end coffee too. I highly recommend it for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or just drinks.",5.0
"Wow, everything we had was fantastic. The flavors are both deep and punchy. We shared some charcuterie (pickled tongue -- amazing) and addictive chard stems, then scallop special (perfectly cooked, great flavors), a side of shishito peppers, and the best steak I've had in ages. My husband had a nice glass of Lambrusco and I asked the waiter to surprise me with something in the scotch/whiskey/bourbon arena. I told him a little of what I tend to like and he nailed it with a great rye I had never tried before. You can also have a less pricey meal, but before we knew it, it felt like we were celebrating. Welcome to the neighborhood, Krupa Grocery!!",5.0
"great food, great cocktails!!The host made us feel welcome as soon as we arrived and throughout our meal.

Definitely headed back soon!",5.0
"Ever since Krupa accommodated my husband and I for a late 2 hour lunch a few months ago, it has become our go to spot. They are always open-- breakfast, lunch, and dinner-- and the food is awesome. Thus far, we have indulged in the skate sandwich, breakfast gnocchi, beer cheese toasts, and veal schnitzel. I am thrilled to have such a great spot close by us!",5.0
"The food here is very good overall, but the portion size is more suited for a lunch than dinner, especially considering their prices. We had the pea salad which was very good and flavorful, but small for it's price. The lamb burger and eggplant main had good flavor but again for the price I would expect a salad on the side or more couscous with the eggplant. One can get a great burger with duck fat fries nearby at Lot 2 for the same money. I hate when I leave a restaurant still hungry. Bread on the table would also be a good addition. Nice atmosphere, comfortable outside garden to eat in, but have entrees that feel like entrees.",4.0
"Looks nice but the portions are so small we had to go across the street for bagels after eating there to make up for it. The egg dish was basically just an egg on a nice piece of toast, and the gnocchi, though tasty, was a tiny portion too. Maybe ten pieces hiding under a single egg? We will not return. The place was empty during prime brunch hours, and I can see why.",2.0
"Nice decor but when you order an $11 glass of wine you expect to get a full glass of wine.  No joke, the pour was no more than half of a standard glass.  The food followed this pattern:  An appetizer of ""Chard stems"" was literally a tiny plate of swiss chard stems.  Really?  Our other app was also too little for what we paid.  Mussels were delicious but in general just plain too expensive for what you get and for this neighborhood.",2.0
"I was not planning on writing a review, but when i awoke this morning only wishing I had more mussels and a straw for the sauce, I felt compelled. I sat at the bar with 4 friends and ordered a good sampling of starter and main course items.  Everything was good! The apple salad was light and crisp with small pieces of pecan tossed in, the beet salad was served with  yogurt and was divine. I can't say enough about how good the mussels are. The sauce had lamb and a wonderful red sauce that we fought to get our bread in. The skate po 'boy was piping hot and delicious! With a remoulade and pickles, it was perfect. The bar was fun, the bartender made us a special Christmas margarita with chili liquor that was awesome.  Overall, a great night. We will be back.",5.0
"My husband and I went to Krupa Grocery for dinner last night (Saturday) and had a perfectly enjoyable meal.  My husband had met the owner, Pat, at the opening night party for Celebrate Brooklyn and, after hearing about the restaurant, we were happy to  try a new restaurant in the neighborhood.  We sat outside in the backyard, which was casual and fun on a beautiful evening --pine picnic tables make the space family fun.  We eat mostly vegan and were happy to find a number of starters and sides and salads that we could eat that were totally yummy--bruscetta, beet salad, fingerling potatoes, roasted peppers, roasted swiss chard in garlic and chili sauce,  The entrees were mostly non-vegan (which looked delicious for sure!) so we did non order vegan but ordered a delicious ghudi (which did have some ricotta--sorry vegan purists!).   On the way out, Bob (the other owner) said the chef would be happy to adjust any dish that could be adjusted to accommodate vegetarians. We will definitely come back.  The beer and wine list are awesome! We will be back with our two teenagers!",4.0
