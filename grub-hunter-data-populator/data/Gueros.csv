"Just off the Park Place Shuttle train stop, this place was LIT just a week ago. Maybe it was the weather or the popularity but there were tons of people enjoying Gueros. There's outdoor and indoor seating, they serve margaritas and have a standard but limited menu. Tacos only - Sorry burrito lovers.I came here specifically for the nachos and they did not disappoint.  The nachos were very basic but delicious - cheesy, loaded with crema and topped with guac - nom. My favorite taco was the avocado pepper, because its sour creamy taste was unique and expertly done. The steak taco was also delicious.Will be coming back and hoping to snag a seat outside this summer.",4.0
"I hate this place.As far as tacos, they are A-ok[1]. Not sure why anyone would pay $4-4.50 for a taco, let alone one of THESE tacos, but clearly a lot of people do. During HH M-F 4-7pm tacos are $1 off, but still..I just don't get the popularity of this place. Moreover, it attracts the worst people to the neighborhood.People with total disregard for everything and everybody.People who double park and keep the music blasting from their cars for hours while enjoying their tacos, even well after the place has actually closed.People who take their drinks out then leave their dirty plastic cups on your stoop.People who bring a boombox to a restaurant.People who easily pick a fight. And this is a neighborhood where minor quarrels end up in major shootouts. Last summer at least three brawls erupted at this place. And the owners are well aware of the problems, but chose to focus on cashing in and nothing else.You think I'm exaggerating? Then consider this: this place has a bouncer. Yes: A TACO PLACE WITH A BOUNCER! Have you ever heard of a taco place who needs to have a bouncer to keep its patrons in check? This may be the one and only.You want numbers? Click this link: nycopendata.socrata.com/…and in the ""search"" field type ""605 Prospect Place"". You'll find A TON of complaints. As of today, more than 90 different complaints[1]. Basically a complain is filed every single day their outdoor area is open.And good luck bringing the issues up with management. They think that, since the problems are not actually happening inside their establishment, they are not responsible for the behavior of their customers. Ok, so if their customers are keeping the entire neighborhood awake at night they have nothing to do with it. If people buy their margaritas at Gueros and then toss the plastic cups in the street they have nothing to do with it. In other words: this place is only interested in making money; the fact that they actually made the neighborhood a worse, less livable place since they open their business is none of their concern.May they rot in hell.----------------[1] You want great tacos? Walk 20 min. to Chilo's: yelp.com/biz/chilos-bedf…Same chef as Mayfield, better tacos, lower prices, nicer environment, full bar.[2] You will also note the timely response of the NYPD to the complaint, some times 6-7 hours later... A noise complain filed at, say, 8pm, is addressed the morning after. Thank you, NYPD; why bother?",1.0
"Two words: Queso dip.Okay, so that's not the only thing great about this spot, but definitely something you should try. It's really simple menu: tacos, tequila, and nacho variations (what could be better?) Everything was excellent! Side note: It's a small space (super teeny tiny) so just keep that in mind if you're trying to come in a group.",5.0
Loooovvvvvveeeeee the margaritas!!! Loooovvvvveeeee their shrimp nachos!!!! Great service!!!!!,5.0
Food is unique in flavor with the exception of the beef taco. Fried Chicken and Shrimp taco are delicious.The Margrita on rocks will have you very satisfied!,4.0
"3 Words. Nachos. Avocado Jalapeno Taco. Margaritas (half and half). Ok more than 3 words. But check it. I love this spot for it's Austin style taco jam. But really the other stuff is ok. If you wanna feel nice and fat the nachos are where it's at. So good. If you wanna leave feeling a little more bouncy, get ye self a taco. And margs. Well. They really know how to make em here. I like the half and half, half frozen half not. All frozen and ya brain will be frozen! Best to call for pickup as it can take a little while for delivery and then it will be cold. You can also pick it up and eat there.",4.0
"UG. This most likely is a biased review because I HATE THIS RESTAURANT WITH A MIGHTY AND FEARSOME FIRE.As a neighbor, they are TERRIBLE.  Almost every morning, there's a pile of lime rinds that are spilled all over the sidewalks.  The streets outside are sticky with leaky garbage or remnants of the a-holes with margaritas from the night before.  Imagine a taco stand that needs to hire a bouncer.  Yes, a BOUNCER.  That's the kind of clientele that comes here.  The outdoor seating area attracts mobs of people who think it's appropriate to do some or all of the following things:- yell loudly to people half a block away- bring their own music- take margaritas to drink on the stairs of neighboring buildings- sit on the table- stand on the table- move the gates further onto the sidewalks when they need more room- hang out outside the restaurant after it's closed for HOURS- have friends park outside and play their music at window rattling levels while they chat with them- order 7 margaritas for themselves at one go - also at 11:00 pmMeanwhile, the bouncer sits there and says nothing.  Way to do your job.  Speaking of doing your jobs, not sure why it takes so friggin long to get a couple tacos.  The food is fine.  I actually like the fish taco and the fried avocado taco (hence the 2nd star).  But at $5 a pop, it ain't cheap.Do yourself a favor and head over to Chilo's where the tacos are just as good and half the price and if you decide to act like an animal, it's actually a BAR and at least that behavior is somewhat expected.",2.0
"I've been here twice. The first time I had a seat outside next to a couple and their friend. The girl seemed to be on something other than the half and half, she was kneeling down acting like a sex kitten. I'm just saying. This place gets crowded and it was luck for us to find seating outside! The second time I ordered from the Yelp app and my food took over an hour. And they had the nerve to say 10 more minutes when I walked in. It took 30 more! The Food: the half and half taste great. The tacos taste amazing. I love the cilantro it gave it that zest! I prefer hard tacos but if you can get me to eat soft tacos your food must be amazing. 4 stars for my wait!",4.0
"I am totally in love with this place. In fact I am so in love that I am happy that they are not within walking distance as I fear that I could eat here daily. I have tried several of their tacos, their quesadillas and chips. All of it has been fresh and made right in front of me.  The margaritas are amazing and a great buy. You honestly only need one especially if you intend to drive home.So the reason for me not giving five stars is the seating situation. One time I had the experience of seeing a customer who had paid for food being told by the bouncer they couldn't sit outside because they closed the outdoor seating space at 9pm. It was about ten minutes to 9 and we quickly started to try to inhale our drinks as we were afraid to get the boot. Some words were exchanged between the bouncer and the customer. The bouncer told us that we could take our time because we had been sitting outside from before.... Confusing.The inside is so tiny that it is hard to find a table inside. While you can order food to go you can't order the drinks to go so you end up drinking while standing in the middle of the floor where you are either blocking the bathroom line or the ordering line.This past Sunday we didn't stay as the vibe was off. There were numerous cars double parked in front of the eatery and it was so packed that one couldn't drink and stand. One of the customers passed a drink to someone in one of the double parked cars.... The vibe was just off.So food and drinks are a five. But the seating and bouncer are a zero.  Stop by if you see no line.",4.0
"I came here with a friend who said they have the best nachos! We ordered fried chicken nachos- delicious. The small one for $8 was way too much food for one person.

"HELL YES. I've lived in this neighborhood for 6 months now, and I'm upset I hadn't known about this place until recently! I was laying in bed last weekend, and realized I really wanted some Mexican food, but was also looking to take a little walk through my neighborhood. I found out this place was 2 blocks away! Where have I been?!?! ANYWAY, THE FOOD.I ordered a quesadilla and two tacos: The Fried Shrimp Taco and the Blackened Catfish Taco. I ordered them online and went to pickup. I told the staff my name when I walked in and the woman behind the cash register gave me a warm smile and went, ""oh yes!"" Like she KNEW ME AND WAS WAITING FOR ME MY WHOLE LIFE. (OK maybe I'm being dramatic but I was very hungry! Forgive me 0:) ).The food was so yummy and was VERY well priced. $16 for a delicious meal that filled me up and was beautifully crafted? I can't wait to show my roommates this place.",5.0
"This is one of my favorite places to visit. Mainly because of the quesadillas which are simply amazing. I have tried the fried chicken and the steak quesadilla which are both delicious. I also love the shrimp tacos. The quesadillas are a little overpriced but I guess you pay for the quality. Another highlight of this place is the nachos which are delicious because the come with with melted cheese along with other things. You can add chicken, steak, avocados, etc. I will continue to be a customer here. The only reason I gave this place four stars was because there is not a lot of places to sit.

This has become one of my favorite to-go places in my neighborhood! Those margaritas will have you F*CKED up...seriously. I had to cancel my evening plans! Oh well. I love the steak nachos  here! They always have a special - great prices!!Love the staff here - they're super nice:),5.0

"Let me first say the tacos here are really good. The frozen margarita I had however, I couldn't say the same for. I probably should have gotten it on the rocks. I had the grilled chicken tacos and my friend had the steak nachos (which was pretty large in size) and both were VERY good! So I won't penalize them too much for the subpar drink I had.The toppings they put on the tacos are a perfect combo of crunchy and tasty. The food here is definitely good enough for me to plan a trip back here! The area Gueros is located in is the perfect definition of gentrification. It was pretty eye opening and surprising to me. It's very easy to get to; straight on the 2 or 5 to Franklin Ave. and you can take the shuttle to Park place from there if you don't want to walk 5 or 6 blocks after taking the 2 or 5.Inside is very tiny. Like super tiny lol. You walk in and that's pretty much it. It's not easy to get a seat so you may have to wait a bit standing with your food until a table (about 2 or 3) or stool (9 or 10 I estimate) open up. I totally see myself coming back here to try what else they have on their menu, as everything sounded really good. Fyi, I got a 7 oz frozen margarita (tasted a bit like slush water with liquor) and 2 grilled chicken tacos, which were on the tiny side but packed a punch with flavor, for a total of $13!

It tasted good and was very strong. I had a buzz after one large margarita. The prices aren't bad. I had 3 tacos and a large margarita and my order was $25. Well $35 because I ordered another margarita right before I left. It was so damn good I couldn't resist. This place is very small so it's definitely not the place to go to for a birthday celebration or to hang out with a large group of friends. It's more of a quick stop or take out.

"Good food, excellent service. I randomly came here after leaving the mechanic and having a sudden crave for tacos. It's a medium sized shop with sidewalk seating on a nice cozy block. I first ordered a shrimp and breakfast taco which were really good. Since I decided to dine and have a margarita (which was extremely refreshing, seriously might be the best one I ever had) I ordered two more tacos, the brisket and fried chicken). The brisket had a bit too much green peppers for my liking whoever it was really good and so was the fried chicken. Overall it was a great experience, I just felt I was missing something. Either a slightly larger taco or a bolder taste. Nonetheless I will be back.",4.0

A true Texas favorite for breakfast. The margaritas here are pretty good and so is the compuesto! I can't believe they even make it here in NY, but low and behold, true Tex Mex in Brooklyn. Love it and will definitely be back!!",4.0
Orale! Tortillas like Peking duck really work for the shrimp taco! Yummy! They were out of the bloody maria...beer selection is good,4.0
You got people sitting there for hours. You know the place is small so be fucking considered after you eat let others who are standing a chance to sit and enjoy their food as well,1.0
"Good food, excellent service. I randomly came here after leaving the mechanic and having a sudden crave for tacos. It's a medium sized shop with sidewalk seating on a nice cozy block. I first ordered a shrimp and breakfast taco which were really good. Since I decided to dine and have a margarita (which was extremely refreshing, seriously might be the best one I ever had) I ordered two more tacos, the brisket and fried chicken). The brisket had a bit too much green peppers for my liking whoever it was really good and so was the fried chicken. Overall it was a great experience, I just felt I was missing something. Either a slightly larger taco or a bolder taste. Nonetheless I will be back.",4.0
This place rocks! I showed up here belligerently drunk the other night and got 7 tacos. The tacos were some of the best I've ever had in my damn life.I tipped the chef $10 because I had no regard for personal finances at this point and he made me 2 custom tacos (deep fried catfish) they were bomb. 10/10 would eat here again.PS the margs are strong AF.,5.0
"After Chavela's, Gueros is the next destination taco shop. It is small, and while they have seating space, most people do takeout, which is different from Chavela's. They have a wide variety of tacos (all of which are pretty delicious), and they also serve margaritas.",4.0
"Tacos are GREAT.  But pricy.Seating is a MESS.  You get a number on a stand when you order, and then it's like some sort of free-for-all, eyeing people who look like they're maybe finishing up, waiting for someone to stand so you can throw yourself at the table.  I don't really know what the answer is unless they wanted to move to a bigger place, as the problem is just popularity.",4.0
My oh my those margaritas!!!! I came here on a Tuesday night not expecting much. But as soon as I walked in the vibe was flowing! The place is small so you are very close to those eating around you. Luckily the vibe here is so open that everyone talks to everyone! Curious what they are eating? They'll be happy to let you know! One margarita in I realized these puppies were no joke. I couldn't even finish a second one! The tacos were to die for. And the salads even better. You can customize things to your liking with no or little charge. One of the best mexican places I have been to in a very long while. I hope to be a regular at this 'cheers' type restaurant.,5.0
"I've been on the hunt for good gross queso like they have in the south since moving here a year ago, and now I've finally found it! Here's what I mean:- The kind of queso you find in a cheap Tex-Mex restaurant where everything is covered in cheese, the beans are refried, and there's no fancy add ons like radishes in your taco leaving you wondering if what you've always known to be Mexican exists in this city. - Creamy hot cheese dip with a little kick to it. - Does not taste like it came out of a Tostito's jar.

"Can there be a better relaxing Happy Hour? If you just want a place to kick back with one or two friends. Scarf some down delicious food and drink awesome beers at a great price. Gueros might be your new go to joint.Nestled off the corner of Franklin on Prospect Place, Gueros has one of the best happy hour deals. $1 dollar off all tacos and $3 dollar beers. That's a pretty awesome deal. But you must be asking yourself several questions? Is that really a great deal? How great are these tacos? Does anyone actually care about me? Don't worry I'll answer all of that. The tacos are usually priced between 3.50 and 4.50 depending on which one you get. Regardless of which one you select you will be in heaven. These tacos are the best in the neighborhood. Deep fried avocado with jalapeno! Blackened catfish! Brisket! Hanger steak! I'm in heaven here. The beers are a good variety of bottles. I usually go with some Sol but they have other beers, some of which are on the low end but not all. Lastly, no. No one cares about you, except for me. Which is why you should trust me and my reviews. The guacamole here isn't anything special. It's really all about the tacos, beer and my friends LOVE their margaritas.",5.0

"Gueros has officially won my heart over. Since the last review, I have dined in-house on multiple occasions, and I have loved it every time. I also discovered the nachos; which can either be delivered or eaten in-house with great results. My key to actually being able to sit down is never ever going during rush hours, which basically means right when they open for about a two-hour window. Everything i experience at Gueros is good, but not extravagant. so, if you are looking for some solid tex-mex, with gooey fake cheese, and one-size/taste-fits-all margarita; then Gueros is the place for you. ** In the alcohol section, but 'Not Sure', I mean they have margarita. 1 margarita.",4.0

"I'm not sure if I went to the same restaurant as every other person who reviewed this place, but honestly this was a far cry from the best tacos I have ever had, and as you can see from my other reviews I rarely hate.Lets get the whole location/ambiance talk out of the way first:Seating is limited inside and outsideLine here is usually pretty crazy, but moves at a decent pace.If you are staying after ordering, you will get a number and the food will be brought to your tableCredit cards are accepted.Food:Fried shrimp - Delicious, crispy with good sauce, was my favorite of all of themFried Chicken - Just like the fried shrimp this one was also delicious and crispyPork Shoulder - Dry, Flavorless, had to use a ton of lime and dip it into my beans in order to eat, least favorite of all the items I tried here (all 5 people who ordered this along side me agreed)Steak taco - Steak was chewy, lacked flavor for the most part, nothing memorableChips with Guac - Standard Chips and Guac, nothing to write home aboutBeans and Greens - Delicious, smokey, definitely unlike other ones I have had beforeOverall the food does not justify the prices, commotion and wait here.",3.0
"Had tacos last week and they were delicious! I had the brisket, fried shrimp and grilled chicken tacos! The brisket was mouth watering good! The fried shrimp was good and had fresh and lightness even though the shrimp was fried. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars bc that grilled chicken taco was blah! The taco fell apart the toppings were blah but that chicken itself was tasty! I will definitely go back. Love the boutique taqueria feel of it and the staff was welcoming.

The food here is great! The patrons are a mixture of different people from all walks of life. The inside is pretty small that's why I'm giving it 4 stars but there is also outside seating. The noise level is pretty loud so if you want an quiet laid back vibe this isn't for you. They serve frozen or regular margaritas and they get you pretty drunk.

I actually recommend the fried avocado and jalapeño taco, even if you're not vegetarian. Fried shrimp is delicious as well, especially with the pickled onion. Love me some fried foods with pickled, crunchy veggies :). I always judge a Mexican place by their guac and I was not disappointed. I recommend getting a thing of it and adding it to your tacos for a smooth finish.",4.0
"The BEST TACOS I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE! This is what I have told all my friends and now my fellow yelpers. Every time I bring someone here they instantly become hooked. This is definitely my favorite Mexican spot in Brooklyn and I have never had a bad experience here. Normally I go for the Steak, Shrimp or Catfish tacos. I can never seem to have just 2. Oh and the margaritas are also the best I have ever had. That says a lot since this is the ONLY place i order margaritas from. They are made with fresh lemons yummmy. I would give this place 10 stars if  I could. NO EXAGGERATION! Fair warning, due make sure you grab the empty seats fast as they go pretty quickly.

"Can there be a better relaxing Happy Hour? If you just want a place to kick back with one or two friends. Scarf some down delicious food and drink awesome beers at a great price. Gueros might be your new go to joint.Nestled off the corner of Franklin on Prospect Place, Gueros has one of the best happy hour deals. $1 dollar off all tacos and $3 dollar beers. That's a pretty awesome deal. But you must be asking yourself several questions? Is that really a great deal? How great are these tacos? Does anyone actually care about me? Don't worry I'll answer all of that. The tacos are usually priced between 3.50 and 4.50 depending on which one you get. Regardless of which one you select you will be in heaven. These tacos are the best in the neighborhood. Deep fried avocado with jalapeno! Blackened catfish! Brisket! Hanger steak! I'm in heaven here. The beers are a good variety of bottles. I usually go with some Sol but they have other beers, some of which are on the low end but not all. Lastly, no. No one cares about you, except for me. Which is why you should trust me and my reviews. The guacamole here isn't anything special. It's really all about the tacos, beer and my friends LOVE their margaritas.",5.0

"Gueros has officially won my heart over. Since the last review, I have dined in-house on multiple occasions, and I have loved it every time. I also discovered the nachos; which can either be delivered or eaten in-house with great results. My key to actually being able to sit down is never ever going during rush hours, which basically means right when they open for about a two-hour window. Everything i experience at Gueros is good, but not extravagant. so, if you are looking for some solid tex-mex, with gooey fake cheese, and one-size/taste-fits-all margarita; then Gueros is the place for you. ** In the alcohol section, but 'Not Sure', I mean they have margarita. 1 margarita.",4.0

"I'm not sure if I went to the same restaurant as every other person who reviewed this place, but honestly this was a far cry from the best tacos I have ever had, and as you can see from my other reviews I rarely hate.Lets get the whole location/ambiance talk out of the way first:Seating is limited inside and outsideLine here is usually pretty crazy, but moves at a decent pace.If you are staying after ordering, you will get a number and the food will be brought to your tableCredit cards are accepted.Food:Fried shrimp - Delicious, crispy with good sauce, was my favorite of all of themFried Chicken - Just like the fried shrimp this one was also delicious and crispyPork Shoulder - Dry, Flavorless, had to use a ton of lime and dip it into my beans in order to eat, least favorite of all the items I tried here (all 5 people who ordered this along side me agreed)Steak taco - Steak was chewy, lacked flavor for the most part, nothing memorableChips with Guac - Standard Chips and Guac, nothing to write home aboutBeans and Greens - Delicious, smokey, definitely unlike other ones I have had beforeOverall the food does not justify the prices, commotion and wait here.",3.0
"Had tacos last week and they were delicious! I had the brisket, fried shrimp and grilled chicken tacos! The brisket was mouth watering good! The fried shrimp was good and had fresh and lightness even though the shrimp was fried. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars bc that grilled chicken taco was blah! The taco fell apart the toppings were blah but that chicken itself was tasty! I will definitely go back. Love the boutique taqueria feel of it and the staff was welcoming. Also seems they have a connection with the neighborhood which is great.",4.0
"I went here on a recommendation and have no regrets. Grabbed some nachos to share with a carnitas taco and frozen math. Prices were decent and the food was pretty authentic. The space is small but if you time it correctly, there is four outdoor tables that are nice on a summer day. I will definitely be back here again!",5.0
The food here is great! The patrons are a mixture of different people from all walks of life. The inside is pretty small that's why I'm giving it 4 stars but there is also outside seating. The noise level is pretty loud so if you want an quiet laid back vibe this isn't for you. They serve frozen or regular margaritas and they get you pretty drunk.

"I was one of the first customers of Gueros, I have ordered from them for years now. I have introduced this restaurant to about 50 people in the beginning and those people went on to introduce this restaurant to a lot more people. I have walked to this restaurant from my apt in Crown Height  numerous times in the heat and the snow. And have ordered delivery from this restaurant as many times as I have walked in to patronized it in person.I have brought people here from out of town and out of the country. I have raved about Gueros so much so that when people visit they know that it is always on the list of ""must haves"". I have enjoyed the avocado tacos, queso an chips and everything else on the menu for years. As of late when I call the people that answer the phone tell me that I am no longer in the delivery zone. I am one block out of the zone, which is where I have always lived in Crown Heights. As a long time customer I would expect the same respect from a company I supported to support me. But now that our neighborhood is starting to feel like WILLIAMSBURG our neighborhood restaurant has decided to accommodate a certain demographic an exclude the people who have been there since the beginning. I remember when there was no line, no outside an barely a margarita. And the people taking your orders were cool and not pretentious.I know other people from the neighborhood who also decided to stop patronizing this restaurant, to which I replied ""NO NO NO it's wonderful"", they also have been around since the beginning an will no longer patronize due to not feeling appreciated.

The tacos here are amazingly creative combos on soft corn tortillas- flavor explosions in the mouth.I went with brisket and fried avocado/jalepeno taco. The brisket with cheddar, rajas, roasted onions and au jus was delish. The fried avocado/jalepeno with jalepeno buttermilk , pico, beans is inventive and tasty.

The fried chicken was a tad dry and the grilled steak ain't really do anything for me. I've eaten at a lot of taco spots and I wasn't particularly wowed. Not to say they weren't good, but when you pay $13 bucks for three tacos you're expecting over the top flavor.

Simple menu, and fair price point.Two tacos were enough to fill me up, and same with my fiancé.She got the Chorizo and Brisket.I got the Brisket as well and the Grilled Catfish.Incredibly fresh and flavorful.I bet they could fit a few more people in if they pushed the side bar back closer to the wall.",4.0

"I took some friends here a couple weeks ago as I'm very fond of this place. Unfortunately, it wasn't the best first experience for them and now I'm rethinking going there every again myself.One of the servers went to get an ice bag from the back. She proceeded to break the ice on the floor which is normal but the issue came when she put the bag on the serving counter (where they orders go before serving or packaging for take away) and continue to try breaking the ice. I was so shock to see after she accomplished her task, that she never cleaned the counter off or even washed her hands.  She when straight back to serving people outside and packing food for delivery/takeout.This was so disappointing as she never even thought about it in anyway. This is the only reason I've given this place 2 stars. Health should come first most of all in a restaurant. It's important that you stress this to your staff especially since you don't know who's a health inspector. Lucky for them my GF wasn't there at the time. CLEAN, CLEAN, CLEAN!!!!!!!!!!",2.0
Love love margaritas  steak nachos is to die for,4.0
"I ordered the nachos and was supremely disappointed - maybe I didn't look closely enough at the ingredients but I HATE it when restaurants use that runny, processed, fake nacho cheese on nachos instead of real cheese. I'd still give this place another shot to see how their actual tacos and burritos taste, but the nachos are one big HELL NAH.",3.0
"The Tacos here are addicting! The combinations of toppings are insane! I ordered chicken nachos, a Margarita, Blackened Cat Fish Taco, fried shrimp taco and grilled hanger steak taco. YOU CANT JUST ORDER 1 or 2 !!!! The Outdoor seating and vibes were cool. This is definitely a hippy spot! Very small for large groups. Good take out spot. 1 Margarita left me nice and Tipsy!!!! The service was fast and the waiter brings food to your table rather quickly. There is a jug of free lime water that you can pour. I love the authentic mexican taste here and I LOVE BROOKLYN!!!!!!",5.0
"Life changing tacos, in a rapidly changing 'hood.  The place is off Franklin Ave a shockingly gentrifying part of Crown Heights. This is a take-out joint with a few spots to sit with some house-hot sauce and a bathroom.I went with two tacos and chips and guac. The tacos here are amazingly creative combos on soft corn tortillas- flavor explosions in the mouth.I went with brisket and fried avocado/jalepeno taco. The brisket with cheddar, rajas, roasted onions and au jus was delish. The fried avocado/jalepeno with jalepeno buttermilk , pico, beans is inventive and tasty. Fresh fried chips are my downfall with good limey guac. There are so many tacos to try and nice stores to window shop along the route the from Franklin Ave.stop on Eastern Parkway. WOW!",5.0
"Gueros has some legit food, but only come here if you're ordering to-go. Every time I've ventured to Gueros, the tables of this tiny shop have been occupied by diners who had long since finished their food and were casually chatting over nursed beers and often-empty cups of water. The staff makes no attempt to encourage these squatters to move along and allow new patrons to eat in, so be prepared for an element of frustration as you turn in circles trying to find a small slice of tabletop nirvana to enjoy your delicious tacos.",3.0
"had a craving for tacos, loaded up Yelp and here I am. small spot with a couple of tables and a stool & bar setup. quick friendly service. Ordered the Fried Jalapeño & Avocado taco, Fried Chicken taco and the Grilled Hanger Steak taco. The most enjoyable of the three was the Jalapeño joint. The fried chicken was a tad dry and the grilled steak ain't really do anything for me. I've eaten at a lot of taco spots and I wasn't particularly wowed. Not to say they weren't good, but when you pay $13 bucks for three tacos you're expecting over the top flavor. Didn't get a chance to partake in the margaritas as I was on the clock.umm... i'd eat here again, but I know too many spots and can't justify returning to pay 4.50 for a taco. Gueros, alright stuff.",3.0

"So I got the vegetarian taco (x1 as I was not hungry) when I came here with Miss Sarit. there is minimal seating, so best to come during non-peak hours. Please note that there is no AC inside so if you come on a hot day, try to sit outside or prepare to die.The tacos here are really good, however can be hit or miss. As Miss Sarit and I were soon to discover; they vary in size / quality. She ordered the same taco as the table next to us, and hers was around half the size! It happens I guess. It was undeniably delicious.About the tacos, they are a bit on the pricey side at around 3.50$/taco. In my neighborhood of Sunset Park tacos of same quality go for $1.20 - $1.75/each. Aside from that, for 3+ dollars it better be a good taco. Miss Sarit ordered the guacamole which came as battered and fried avocado that looked so good I was tempted to cast my food allergy away and order one myself!

I thought they had the best nachos around BUT!  I was still waiting after two hours for delivery and they were not answering the phone because its so busy, I get that its Saturday, but it gets worse.

He was obviously on something and getting very angry, hitting his phone and yelling. I never raised my voice once and I went and grabbed my boyfriend to come stand with me at the door because he was getting so emotional and throwing his body against the wall, yelling at his phone and saying if it was a woman he'd love it and then kept saying I love you to the phone. Crazy..It was creepy and disgusting customer service. I finally got through on my own phone to them and they said they will refund me when they get the signed receipt back. Then I tried to be nicer and told him I was sorry for his rough evening and to try to have a good evening but he's still throwing himself against the wall and yelling ""nooooooo"" because his phone is broken. I feel bad about the phone but seriously!! Is he in first grade throwing a tantrum when it's his job to be the face of this company? In conclusion, beware of the delivery service.

Yummy tacos and great drinks!! At first it looks like a whole in the wall. Super quaint . But one you order and receive your food and drinks it's incredible. The freshness of the tacos are Devine. I also tried the salad and it is the most amazing salad.,5.0
"Food: Five stars!!! The tacos are absolutely scrumptious. I have had the carne asada tacos (nicely charred, savory smoky flavor), tacos al pastor (tangy pineapples balance a savory fatty meat), catfish tacos (soft fleshy white fish with slight spice), and the fried chicken tacos (adequately fried with white meat, less spice, more BBQ flavor). They are all good, it just depends what you feel like. Queso nachos with carne and queso nachos with tomato salsa are good too. Great snack to go along with the happy hour margaritas! $5 from 4-7pm on weekdays. The tacos are the highlight of this place! I've eaten at Chavella's for the last two years, and I think it's refreshing to have tex-mex tacos and support a new local business. I prefer Gueros any day!Drinks: Amazing frozen Margaritas! Be sure to get them and even better if you do during Happy Hour!Atmosphere: Slightly crowded. Tables turn quickly.",5.0
"Food is good but good luck getting it delivered. For one, no one answers the phone.

This week I ordered and after an hour of waiting decided to call and check on it. Phone rings and rings and rings and no one picks up. Tried calling about 10 times. No answer.

That vegetarian one is full of tangy pickled onions and blistered zucchini that make me pity anyone wasting time with a meat option. Oh but the queso. Those chips are fresh, hot, salty, totally on point, and the queso is my stock reply to any ex-Texan looking to talk smack. When I Seamless from Maya, a voice in the back of my mind always says, ""You could have gotten Guero."" Delivery usually gets things wrong, and the food is a shadow of its in-restaurant self, but hey, live and learn. Just go there when you feel you're zen enough to fight for your right to guero.",5.0
Delicious. Try the roasted veggie tacos and homemade guacamole. Drooling now just thinking about it.,5.0
"High volume, low key and casual lunch spot for tex-mex eating with fresh juice with your Tequilla and tacos of great variety to serve all palates.  It is great food ""down and dirty"" style.",4.0
"Holy crap go eat these tacos.  I don't care what you're doing right now.  At work?  Stop it. Gueros.  First born child coming into the world? Don't care.  Gueros.   I popped in here with a friend to grab some tacos and have a beer or two and it didn't disappoint.  They've got a kickass brisket taco (didn't know that was a thing) and an awesome hangar steak taco as well.  You know what?  I had the chorizo taco and was pretty damn impressed as well.  Vegetarian?  They've got some stuff there for you, too.  I didn't have it, but I'm sure its fantastic.  They say that people reach the end of their lives and have several regrets.  Working too much, not spending enough time with loved ones, and not having enough Gueros.  Don't be one of those people.  Some other reviews noted that the place can get a little crowded.  That's true, so be smart about when you get there.  But if you do get there and its crowded, grab a reasonably priced beer and chill for a little bit.  Also, they accept credit cards and there's no minimum.",5.0
Yummy tacos and great drinks!! At first it looks like a whole in the wall. Super quaint . But one you order and receive your food and drinks it's incredible. The freshness of the tacos are Devine. I also tried the salad and it is the most amazing salad.,5.0
"Food: Five stars!!! The tacos are absolutely scrumptious. I have had the carne asada tacos (nicely charred, savory smoky flavor), tacos al pastor (tangy pineapples balance a savory fatty meat), catfish tacos (soft fleshy white fish with slight spice), and the fried chicken tacos (adequately fried with white meat, less spice, more BBQ flavor). They are all good, it just depends what you feel like. Queso nachos with carne and queso nachos with tomato salsa are good too. Great snack to go along with the happy hour margaritas! $5 from 4-7pm on weekdays. The tacos are the highlight of this place! I've eaten at Chavella's for the last two years, and I think it's refreshing to have tex-mex tacos and support a new local business. I prefer Gueros any day!Drinks: Amazing frozen Margaritas! Be sure to get them and even better if you do during Happy Hour!Atmosphere: Slightly crowded. Tables turn quickly.",5.0
"Food is good but good luck getting it delivered. For one, no one answers the phone. Once you can actually place your order they will tell you an estimated time which is normally double whatever it is they say. Last week I ordered and they forgot the drinks (along with being really late) The guy was unapologetic and came back a half hour later to bring them. This week I ordered and after an hour of waiting decided to call and check on it. Phone rings and rings and rings and no one picks up. Tried calling about 10 times. No answer. Finally the delivery guy gets here and forgets half of the order. Tried to call back to tell them and no answer of course. Do yourself a favor, go in, drink a big margarita so that you are drunk and will be oblivious to any bad service that you may have.",2.0

"Man, I've got a thing for tacos and this place is great. I'd go with the shrimp and catfish tacos with a side of guac. Portions are good and it's pretty speedy. They do, however, need to get the heating situation under control. They've got some heaters inside and a sad rag that helps keep the door closed, but we were frozen during and after our meal.",4.0
"I've been here several times and I am never disappointed with the tacos or margarita . The tacos average about $4 a piece . Parking can be difficult and sometimes there isn't available seating ( reasons for the 4 stars ) . Worth the wait?! Uhhh yea ! It's a short drive for me but I'm always willing to make it . At $4-$5 a piece per taco, it's pricey because it adds up , BUT definitely worth it .",4.0
"My boyfriend and I often go to gueros and have a great experience with great food, tonight was nothing like that. Three girls were at the register taking orders, handing out orders, ect... We waited on a short line, ordered our food and grabbed a table. After a long wait and one wrong order brought to our table, my boyfriend got his three tacos, I was told mine would be right out. He started eating, not wanting them to get cold, and I patiently waited on mine while keeping an eye on the waitresses. They looked extremely frazzled the entire time, no one had a clue what was going on and one stood around not doing a thing. My boyfriend finished his tacos and mine were nowhere in sight and no one came to apologize. I approached the girls and said I wanted my money back, they didn't even know what I was waiting on. I got my money refunded, got no apology, and nothing to compensate. It was 8:20 when we ordered our food and sat down, at 9:00 my boyfriend finished his food. I'm extremely upset by the service, THE PLACE WASNT EVEN BUSY. We've been in this place when it's packed, not a seat around, and have gotten our food much quicker and had much better service. Not planning to visit gueros again anytime soon. And to top it all off a roach was on the seat of the table next to us who had equally as bad an experience.",1.0
"3.5-4 starsI really do like this place a lot. I like the casual ambiance, the margarita machines spinning by the register, and the taco selection - there are so many!However, I do feel like the wait can be a little too much sometimes and surprisingly, it can be pricey $$$. I think you go in thinking it'll be cheaper than it ends up being. But in terms of food, the tacos are good. The Picadillo is my favorite, and it seems to be a lot of other peoples too, since I find it sold out a lot. If you like tacos, this place is great. Just know you're going to be spending a little more than you'd like for them. Also, avoid during peak hours! The line can get a little insane.",4.0
This is a review I should have posted a couple of years ago. Because I was born and raised in Texas I am a harsh critic when it comes to any food remotely considered Mexican or Tex-Mex. I still haven't found a go-to Mexican spot in NYC. It's like searching for the Holy Grail.I like Gueros. It is good for Brooklyn. I wish the place was a bit larger but they serve flavorful tacos and are in walking distance of my house. Score! Today I had a bloody Maria while I waited for my order. Great spice although not enough alcohol. The avocado and jalepeno taco is by far my favorite. Today they weren't as good as they normally are. I'm not sure if that means they are falling off or just having an off day. I will still patronize Gueros and just assume they are having an off day.,3.0
"If you don't want to deliver food, that's fine. But don't offer delivery in that case. Ordered at 7pm, called at 8, 9, and 10 to check in on the order and was told each time that our order would arrive about 10-15 minutes later. Our food never arrived, and we were still charged for the order. Obviously, that's mildly unacceptable.",1.0
"You know what, this place gets 4 stars for food; the tacos are AMAZING. This is why, living only a few blocks away, I made a point to come back to Gueros after my first visit. Unfortunately, my second visit here wasn't as pleasant. The first visit featured a nice, bustling atmosphere, friendly cashiers & waiters, and great food. Last Wednesday, however, was my second visit, and it was tainted by a seemingly unscrupulous cashier. It was around 4pm and I decided to take a gal pal and her 5-year old son here to try the delicious tacos I'd been raving about. Since it was a beautifully sunny day, we decided to stick around and dine in. Once there, however, we noticed the male cashier applying a ""credit-card-machine-isn't-working, cash-only"" policy very selectively. He applied it to my party-who was forced to walk to the convenience store and get cash from an ATM. But the cashier didn't apply the policy to the three guys that came in after us. He also didn't seem to have subjected the other patrons to the policy, as he was engaged in back-n-forth transactions with each of them, bringing receipts to their tables and requesting their signatures. After observing his curious behavior a bit longer, I mentioned to him how it seemed the credit card machine was back up and running. He then explained that the machine WAS in fact working, just taking longer than usual to process a transaction. Ahh, so that's what it was! This cashier must have cared so much about our time and hunger that he preferred we walk down the block to get cash (and risk us not returning) then subject us to a longer-than-normal credit card transaction. A truly altruistic individual, that cashier. Would this be a good time to point out that all the other patrons where white and we weren't? Or would that be an unfair use of the race card? Anywho.. after this cashier picked up on our incredulous stares his spidey senses must have went off; he immediately placed a sign in front of the cash register, which put the world (the entire world this time) on notice, that the credit card machine was out of service. Nice save, my man, nice save. To conclude, i'll be fair and note that the tacos were worth the energy expended in walking down the street to get cash. So for those who will choose to eat here despite my review, do try the blackened catfish taco, in addition to the chicken and steak tacos.",3.0

"Gueros is a great little joint in Crown Heights that I love to visit. Being a vegetarian, it can be hard to find good tacos. Is it too much to ask for more than peppers, onions, and rice?

Watch out, because they can have a huge line, and being small there are minimal places to sit. They are also a little pricey, but what isn't these days?

"I'm not pleased! I walked into this restaurant after grabbing a table outside in the outdoor seating area. Which was still relatively crowded. After ordering food for hubby and I: blackened catfish, brisket, chorizo, and steak taco, a quesadilla, beans and greens, a margarita and a soda ($32) I took my number and my drinks to the table and waited patiently for my food. My beans and greens arrived and I began eating. They were pretty good. Moments later a waitress came outside and began packing up our table while I was in the middle of eating saying they were closing. She took the condiments took my number and then took the table. I told her we weren't finished and she said they were closing. She took my napkins put them on the bench although moments later they went flying onto the floor.

"I'm still upset with my fellow Texans-living-in-Brooklyn for not telling me about Gueros! I stumbled upon it with a friend after having a few drinks. First let me say that I lived in Austin, TX for six years. I cannot tell you how many times I've longed for a good breakfast taco or, well, any taco, but I had given up on finding any decent Tex-Mex in NYC.And then I found Gueros. I tried the fish taco and the fried avocado taco. Delicious! And the queso? The bomb! (I know nobody says that anymore. Still.) So I asked if they were affiliated with Austin Gueros at all, and they are! They're owned by the same company.This place is a slice of Austin, Texas in Brooklyn and it's about damn time! Check them out. You won't be sorry you did.",5.0
"Guero's has 9 quintillion reviews, so I'll just add my two cents:- the fried avocado is truly excellent- the al pastor is not authentic, per se, but delightful and flavorful- the nachos are wonderful if you are all taco-ed out (if such a thing exists)- they do not make burritos (don't ask)- frozen margarita is better than on the rocks- you will wait- it will be worth it",5.0

"Ok, the tacos are still epic. In fact, I feel like they are even better than ever. However, it pains me to say that the last few times I've been here I've noticed the service has gone downhill. A couple of times there has been an employee who lets her rowdy friends monopolize the majority of the tables in this small space, once with food that was clearly from the bodega on the corner, not the restaurant itself. Then the other night I was there and it was crowded (for a good reason! Gueros' food is tops!) but the staff was getting orders wrong left and right. At one point, all the customers were trading ""Are you kidding me?"" looks. Not a good sign.Gueros, when you're good, you're so good! Get back to doin' you the way you deserve to be done, girl!

After I ask him again, he says ""did you forget the tip?"" WOW! I usually leave a tip electronically when I order online. I never have cash. But since this was a replacement meal, I completely forgot. I just so happened to have a few dollars today so I offered to run up and get it but he chuckles and says he needs to leave. Afterwards, I realize just how fuckin awkward and rude that was. I didn't really need the attitude especially when a tip isn't required.

The margaritas kicking a powerful punch adds some extra awesomeness.We've honestly not had a taco there that we didn't like, but our fav's are the blackened catfish, the brisket, the al pastor, the fried avocado and jalapeno, and the breakfast tacos (yep, just listed about half of their menu).This place gets really busy, and is super small, so don't go when you're feeling particularly claustrophobic. There's some seating outside, which helps in the warmer weather.Get a couple of tacos and a margarita, split some guacamole, and be totally satisfied.",4.0
A welcome reprieve from the sorry state of most NY Mexican places. A great place to stop in for lunch and margaritas on a weekend afternoon. Their tacos are fantastic for the most part and they make a mean plate of nachos with serious queso not the nuclear orange movie theater stuff. Good margaritas as well even if they aren't my favorite drink.I lived in SF before coming to NY and lamented the inability to get good Mexican here easily. But after discovering this place and a recent trip back to California I'd say Gueros is on par with most of the good Mexican you can get out there.,5.0
"I'm still upset with my fellow Texans-living-in-Brooklyn for not telling me about Gueros! I stumbled upon it with a friend after having a few drinks. First let me say that I lived in Austin, TX for six years. I cannot tell you how many times I've longed for a good breakfast taco or, well, any taco, but I had given up on finding any decent Tex-Mex in NYC.And then I found Gueros. I tried the fish taco and the fried avocado taco. Delicious! And the queso? The bomb! (I know nobody says that anymore. Still.) So I asked if they were affiliated with Austin Gueros at all, and they are! They're owned by the same company.This place is a slice of Austin, Texas in Brooklyn and it's about damn time! Check them out. You won't be sorry you did.",5.0
"Guero's has 9 quintillion reviews, so I'll just add my two cents:- the fried avocado is truly excellent- the al pastor is not authentic, per se, but delightful and flavorful- the nachos are wonderful if you are all taco-ed out (if such a thing exists)- they do not make burritos (don't ask)- frozen margarita is better than on the rocks- you will wait- it will be worth it",5.0
Great place to stop by if your looking for good tex-mex styled food. The fried chicken tacos are delicious as well as their guac and chip dip. Its better to come here during happy hour because the tacos are $1 off.,4.0
"Ok, the tacos are still epic. In fact, I feel like they are even better than ever. However, it pains me to say that the last few times I've been here I've noticed the service has gone downhill. A couple of times there has been an employee who lets her rowdy friends monopolize the majority of the tables in this small space, once with food that was clearly from the bodega on the corner, not the restaurant itself. Then the other night I was there and it was crowded (for a good reason! Gueros' food is tops!) but the staff was getting orders wrong left and right. At one point, all the customers were trading ""Are you kidding me?"" looks. Not a good sign.Gueros, when you're good, you're so good! Get back to doin' you the way you deserve to be done, girl! You're worth it!",3.0
My favorite is the picadillo tacos and the cheese nachos with picadillo.  Love the food and the service but I make sure to get here soon after opening to avoid the crowds.,4.0
"AWESOME.  Really amazing tacos.  I had the fried avocado, fried chicken, and blackened catfish.  The avocado and chicken were both fantastic, but it was the catfish that set me over the edge.  Cooked and seasoned perfectly, moist with tons of flavor and the right amount of toppings, it was definitely one of the best tacos I've ever had.  I also like how Gueros grills their tortillas to be a little crispy, so that one tortilla is substantial enough to keep the taco from falling apart.  I'm not a fan of the double layer of tortillas.If Gueros wanted to open another location in Prospect Lefferts Garden, I'd be in heaven.",5.0
"The owner was nice enough to reach out and offer a free meal to make up for my previous experience. Definitely appreciated the effort. But then the delivery guy gets to the door. Rings the buzzer. I rush down from the 4th floor and he hands me my food. I say thanks and get ready to run back up the stairs. He then says ""did you forget something"". I said ""what"" and he said ""never mind"". After I ask him again, he says ""did you forget the tip?"" WOW! I usually leave a tip electronically when I order online. I never have cash. But since this was a replacement meal, I completely forgot. I just so happened to have a few dollars today so I offered to run up and get it but he chuckles and says he needs to leave. Afterwards, I realize just how fuckin awkward and rude that was. I didn't really need the attitude especially when a tip isn't required. Come on Gueros, your ""customer service"" just gets better and better :(I texted the owner and he said he would look into it. These employees are too ridiculous for me.",2.0
"Be still, my homesick Texan heart! If you're craving some AMAZING breakfast tacos and tex-mex-- this is THE place. Anyone that doesn't like this place must hate life and/or mexican food. Either way, this place is heaven on earth.I had the bacon + cheese breakfast tacos (nom), my friend had the breakfast taco with potato and chorizo (the chef's recommendation), and we shared the queso (AMAZING).INSIDER'S TIP: If you really want to feel like you're in Texas, go to the corner deli and get yourself a Dr. Pepper/Diet DP to accompany your tacos and queso.

"A very high Four and a Half stars.  Awesome.... best Mexican I have had in NYC!  I know its Tex-Mex but it is the best of any variation I have yet to come across.  Blows nearby Chavelas out of the water (I actually sampled the two back to back one gluttonous afternoon), and that place is pretty decent.                Space is small but well-appointed, the staff is laid back and friendly and the happy hour specials of 1 dollar off already cheap tacos and 3 dollar beers makes the already great value even more exceptional.  Those tacos, though are unbelievable.  The best of the best might be the ingenious beef brisket taco.  The staff told me the brisket is slow cooked with rajas and some type of cheese mix, whatever it is it is amazing.  All of the other options are fantastic too tho from the more unusual Tex-Mex specialties like the crunchy fried chicken and the crazy but excellent fried avocado with jalapeno to the more traditional carne asada and al pastor complete with pineapple.  On the weekends they offer special breakfast tacos with the options of ""migas"",  which is eggs cooked with vegetables and deep frown corn strips, and a build your own option where you can pick two additional items like potatoes, chorizo, and avocado. Everything is incredible and so easy on the wallet.  I am sure I am going to be here way to much.  On tiny thing is keeping them from a full 5 stars would be the fact that they don't include those tasty Margaritas in happy hour.  That's pretty easy to fix in case you guys read this!PS The place is in Crown Heights not Prospect Heights",5.0
"Hallelujah! It's about time we got some legit Mexican in the neighborhood. Now, I know this is Tex-Mex, but it is legit. We decided to take the ankle express through the boons over to Gueros.

"Bummed that the new Chavela's is always too busy to get your quick taco fix on? I was, thus I was perhaps unduly excited to see that Gueros had finally opened. A real step up from the other taqueria that formerly occupied this location, Gueros offers some damn delicious tacos at pretty reasonable prices ($3-$4) in a welcoming atmosphere. The cozy yellow walls really warm up the space, and a combo of bar-style and minimal table seating, along with some outdoor benches, give you a couple spots to get your grub on. They sell margaritas for $8 or $12 dollars and the on-the-rocks version was spot on. Definitely real fruit juice and none of this processed crap that certain restaurants serve up. I can't speak for the frozen version, but I would vouch for these. Beers and sodas in glass bottles (Mexican Coke? Can someone confirm or deny?) round out the drinks menu as well. I suggest the chorizo taco or the fried avocado, and by reports the el pastor is good as well.

"The food was good, decent. But the workers are really unprofessional and not very sanitary. One woman was piercing her ears and touching people's food.

"The tacos are great, and the margaritas are sure to start your night off with a bang, or end your night before it starts. I like the al pastor and blackened catfish tacos.

"OMG THIS PLACE. I could eat here forever. Except only during happy hour. Crushed margarita is awesome but don't take it outside, it's illegal and they won't say anything.

"The second stop on a mini-Bklyn food tour, we found unexpectedly good Tex-Mex style tacos in Prospect Heights.  Gueros is located off Franklin Ave, in a wide space brightened by big windows and warmed by yellow walls.  Seating available bar style, at small tables, or on their sturdy wooden benches outside.  Order at the counter and they'll bring the order to you when ready.We had tacos (of course), trying the blackened catfish, al pastor, fried shrimp, and chorizo.  Fave (by majority count) was the catfish: delicious, smoky, and nicely paired with its toppings.  The least interesting was chorizo.  Still, these were all pretty well-made tacos, from toppings, fillings, to tortillas.  None of the salsa toppings are very spicy; if you want heat, they have habanero salsa in bottles for adding on.  Another nice surprise was their house made margarita; it sat temptingly in a large container at the counter and turned out well-blended and refreshing.Wish Gueros was in my neighborhood.  While not a destination stop, its a really solid casual food option.",4.0

"This place was awesome! Wish it were a little bigger, but then we would have just sat around and ate more tacos and had more bloody marias, so perhaps it's not such a bad thing.The tortillas appear to be made in house, maybe? All I know is they taste a lot better than most of the mexican/tex-mex places around here. We had a service glitch, with them getting my order slightly wrong and not actually letting us know our food was ready, but whatever, things happen.  When we did get our (slightly less hot) tacos, they were great! We ordered three each, and that made us happy and pretty full. Nah, really we probably could have eaten more, or at least had more drinks.We both had the fried avocado and jalapeno, and all the raving is indeed justified, we both agreed that was our favorite of the bunch.  I had the fried shrimp, and a potato and cheddar breakfast taco (they forgot the chorizo). These were both delicious. My friend enjoyed her chorizo and avocado breakfast taco and her catfish one as well. I definitely want to try all the other selections!The margarita from the machine was surprisingly boozy! Not bad at all.

"Ooooooohhhhhh, this is the stuff.  Seriously.  I am a Texas transplant, and have been on a quest for Texas-quality food since I moved up here 5 years ago.  I've found some pretty good stuff, but never understood WHY THE HELL NO ONE UP HERE WAS DOING BREAKFAST TACOS.  After all, they're a major food group where I come from.And then I went to Guero's.  Breakfast tacos!  THAT ARE DELICIOUS!  And, as of the second time I went there, large!  I have to admit that while I love this place, and have since my first visit, I originally thought it was a bit over priced for rather small tacos.  But when I went back the second time, the tacos had grown and the prices hadn't.  That's what I call awesome.I have only had breakfast tacos here, but I am dying to try the regular tacos as well.  I highly recommend the migas tacos and margaritas.  I also love the queso, but it makes me feel like such a fat ass that I have to order it sparingly (like once a year).Final note:  it often looks really crowded, and like you'll never get a seat, with a line out the door.  Don't despair!  Not once have we failed to get a seat, either at a table or at the bar, no matter how packed the place was when we walked in.  And follow the rules: no grabbing an open seat until AFTER you've ordered (that is a rule I invented, but still).",5.0
"The second stop on a mini-Bklyn food tour, we found unexpectedly good Tex-Mex style tacos in Prospect Heights.  Gueros is located off Franklin Ave, in a wide space brightened by big windows and warmed by yellow walls.  Seating available bar style, at small tables, or on their sturdy wooden benches outside.  Order at the counter and they'll bring the order to you when ready.We had tacos (of course), trying the blackened catfish, al pastor, fried shrimp, and chorizo.  Fave (by majority count) was the catfish: delicious, smoky, and nicely paired with its toppings.  The least interesting was chorizo.  Still, these were all pretty well-made tacos, from toppings, fillings, to tortillas.  None of the salsa toppings are very spicy; if you want heat, they have habanero salsa in bottles for adding on.  Another nice surprise was their house made margarita; it sat temptingly in a large container at the counter and turned out well-blended and refreshing.Wish Gueros was in my neighborhood.  While not a destination stop, its a really solid casual food option.",4.0
"Ate the (1) vegetable taco and (2) fried avocado and jalapeño taco. Both were very tasty.  Somewhat small portion size. Easily accessible water jug. Lines sometimes form near door, making ingress/egress tricky. Will definitely go back.",4.0
Other Yelpers do not lie. The fried avocado/fried pickled jalapeño taco was amazing. Even better than the fried avocado taco I had at Austin's highly praised Torchy's taco truck just two weeks ago (sacrilege some may cry!).,5.0
"This place was awesome! Wish it were a little bigger, but then we would have just sat around and ate more tacos and had more bloody marias, so perhaps it's not such a bad thing.The tortillas appear to be made in house, maybe? All I know is they taste a lot better than most of the mexican/tex-mex places around here. We had a service glitch, with them getting my order slightly wrong and not actually letting us know our food was ready, but whatever, things happen.  When we did get our (slightly less hot) tacos, they were great! We ordered three each, and that made us happy and pretty full. Nah, really we probably could have eaten more, or at least had more drinks.We both had the fried avocado and jalapeno, and all the raving is indeed justified, we both agreed that was our favorite of the bunch.  I had the fried shrimp, and a potato and cheddar breakfast taco (they forgot the chorizo). These were both delicious. My friend enjoyed her chorizo and avocado breakfast taco and her catfish one as well. I definitely want to try all the other selections!The margarita from the machine was surprisingly boozy! Not bad at all. The bloody maria was very spicy and good, but ended up being too much for my friend with all the spicy food. Their hot sauce is also really good! Will be back.",5.0
"I can't stop coming here, I was sad to see the original taco place leave as they were really good too! but happy Gueros came in it's place. My closest girl friends live in walking distance to Gueros and when we want a nibble or quick catch up, we always end up here!Great tacos at reasonable prices! Love their fish, shrimp and veggie tacos. The nachos are great as soon as they arrive on your table but don't wait too long to eat them or the cheese will turn into a glop of orange goo....yum!The margaritas are always slammin' and pretty strong! The only down side is the space, it's pretty tiny and get packed during peak hours. Try to go early in the day or mid-afternoon if you want to grab a table.",4.0

There is barely one egg in your taco.Gueros, it's clear you care about quality and you are charging a pretty penny based on your location and the fact that no one in Texas would pay this much for a tiny little taco.  So get your act together and stop skimping on 2 inexpensive but very necessary things . . .

"The woman handling take-out orders here is just down right RUDE.  Let me first say, that this is the first time that I've felt so strongly about an establishment to take the time to write a review.  The story goes..........my girlfriend and I walk into an extremely busy restaurant at 9:30pm on cinco de mayo.  Everything went well but after waiting 25 mins for our food (and witnessing people that were behind us get their orders), my girl decided to ask her about the status of ours.  After asking her name, the employee says ""oh, I just gave your food away.""  GF replies politely ""why?? We've been standing here the entire time.""  The employee claims she called out her name and someone claimed the food.  GF proceeds to ask her if she checked the customers' receipt, to which she replies ""no"" and beginning to take a disrespectful tone with her.  At this point, my GF is visibly upset but surprisingly hadn't lost her temper.........yet.  Right then, our order seemed to be coming up and we were all going to chalk it up to a misunderstanding.  But the employee then proceeds to say to my girl ""are you gonna stop crying about it now??""Up to that point, my girl was respectful even despite her rude demeanor.  But that was the last straw.  What a ridiculous thing to say to a customer, a local who lives right up the block that is a potential repeat customer.  We both work in the industry.  I have for 17 years with extensive experience in boh and foh and the way this woman deals with people is astonishing.  While in line, we were even noting how this could become a regular spot for us as long as the food was good.  Not a chance now.  Rude.

"The tacos here are delicious, as are the nachos. The price is alright, though I'd be happier with it if the service were better. I've ordered to go a few times and it takes a long time and they've yet to get my order right on the first try. This place has gone on my list of places to go when I have absolutely nowhere I need to be and can wait however long it takes them to actually get the food ready. Sometimes, a delicious taco is worth the wait.",3.0
"I loved the food at Gueros from the first day it opened. However, I dont think I will be returning anymore. While the food is delicious (the ground beef, fried avocado and jalapeño, and  roasted vegetable are my favorite) reasonably priced, and the drinks are spot on . . . the service is atrocious! Today I watched my taco sit for 20 min . . . because apparently it takes 20 min to get an order of chips and salsa together (mind you the chips were sitting in a bin and the salsa in the finishing station). Patrons who ordered after I did came and went before I got my food. Even when the chips and salsa were finally handed over, every to stay order was dolled out (even though they ordered 15 min after I did) and the staff checked their phones while my food continued to sit. The problem is this happens every time. I only go right when they open or I order ahead of time but regardless the service takes for ever and my food is cold and soggy by the time I get to eat it even when i start the second i walk out the building. Long story short: good food, horrible service. Dont do there if you are hungry, in a hurry, or cranky.",3.0
"This place is terrible!!!! People are tripping if they like this place.My partner and I have ordered four times and this are our experience:-Rude rude service! Seriously, the craziest worst I've ever had. The guy at the counter asked ""what do you want?"" then shoved my take-out bag at me and didn't say thank you or anything! Definitely a wtf moment.-soggy, cold gross tacos! -tiny, overpriced tacos! Ten bucks gone and still hungry.-the final straw was when my partner ordered breakfast tacos and not only were the eggs rubbery and burnt, they had spooned the beans IN BETWEEN two tacos! Are you telling me your cooks can't even find the interior of the taco??? That's called not being able to assemble a freakin taco and therefore not being able to make tacos!!Rant done. Hope this place closes down.",1.0

"The closest thing I've found to taco perfection in NYC.  Don't get me wrong, the tacos, the atmosphere, the drinks all warrant 5 stars.  So why not give it to them? Well, they committed some very serious cardinal sins.The 2 Completely Unforgivable Sins of Gueros.#1 They only wrap the tacos in one, I repeat, 1 little corn tortilla  With all the salsa and meat juice, the thing falls apart before you can eat it.  WRAP THESE THINGS IN 2 TORTILLAS!#2 They say they use 2 eggs in their breakfast tacos and I have doubts they even use 1.  It's sad really.  Eggs and salsa are the king and queen of breakfast tacos.  You are missing the King! There is barely one egg in your taco.Gueros, it's clear you care about quality and you are charging a pretty penny based on your location and the fact that no one in Texas would pay this much for a tiny little taco.  So get your act together and stop skimping on 2 inexpensive but very necessary things . . . TORTILLAS AND EGGS!!!",3.0
"The woman handling take-out orders here is just down right RUDE.  Let me first say, that this is the first time that I've felt so strongly about an establishment to take the time to write a review.  The story goes..........my girlfriend and I walk into an extremely busy restaurant at 9:30pm on cinco de mayo.  Everything went well but after waiting 25 mins for our food (and witnessing people that were behind us get their orders), my girl decided to ask her about the status of ours.  After asking her name, the employee says ""oh, I just gave your food away.""  GF replies politely ""why?? We've been standing here the entire time.""  The employee claims she called out her name and someone claimed the food.  GF proceeds to ask her if she checked the customers' receipt, to which she replies ""no"" and beginning to take a disrespectful tone with her.  At this point, my GF is visibly upset but surprisingly hadn't lost her temper.........yet.  Right then, our order seemed to be coming up and we were all going to chalk it up to a misunderstanding.  But the employee then proceeds to say to my girl ""are you gonna stop crying about it now??""Up to that point, my girl was respectful even despite her rude demeanor.  But that was the last straw.  What a ridiculous thing to say to a customer, a local who lives right up the block that is a potential repeat customer.  We both work in the industry.  I have for 17 years with extensive experience in boh and foh and the way this woman deals with people is astonishing.  While in line, we were even noting how this could become a regular spot for us as long as the food was good.  Not a chance now.  Rude. Inconsiderate.  Do not go there.  I want my money back.",1.0

The food is excellent!  Now that I have mentioned that .. Let me get to the heart of my review. I witnessed the line cook wearing latex gloves. He patted another employee who was leaveing for the day on the back(no disposal of the gloves)...He stepped away to retrieve more products from the storage area off to the side.(no disposal of the gloves) He puts away the products along the line.. (No disposal of the gloves) Returns to the line and handles food.. (No disposal of the gloves).. Cleans his working area and wipes his hands on several rags around his waist. (NO DISPOSAL OF THE GLOVES).. The whole purpose of wearing disposable latex gloves is to minimize cross contamination of germs etc.. After you handle food.. dispose of the gloves. His hands may be clean but the gloves have touched everything in sight and need to be removed.....Retrain the staff.,3.0

"I had the worst delivery experience of my life when I ordered from here. I called up on a Sunday when they were busy, and they told me it would be about an hour wait. No problem. Then they called me a few minutes later to say it might be more than an hour because they were slammed. They estimated it would be 60 to 90 minutes. Alright, that was long enough so we might need a snack, but I appreciated them telling me. I told them that wouldn't be a problem.We popped in a movie, had some nuts and raisins to hold us over, and waited patiently. After two hours, I was getting a little concerned, so I gave them a call. The woman there told me that our order was done and sitting there, but they didn't know where the delivery guy was. ""He should've been back by now. We're getting a little worried actually."" Uhm, OK. But she said she had my number, and she could call me.Fast-forward another 30 minutes. I had to call them five times in a row before they picked up. It was now around 10:30 p.m. on a Sunday, so I guessed most of their calls were from frazzled customers. The woman said the delivery guy had picked up our food and left 20 minutes ago to drop off four orders, including ours. I told her at this point she should probably comp. at least part of the order, seeing as we had been waiting hours for our food. She said, ""You'll have to figure that out with the delivery guy.""The delivery guy called a few minutes later. He was nice, and quickly agreed to comp half of our order. I felt sorry for him because he was having such a rough night, and told him I didn't blame him.The tacos would've been pretty great if they'd been hot. The avocado one was especially tasty. The thing is, they'd been sitting on the counter for 45 minutes before they got to us, so they were soggy and cold. At this point we were so delirious with hunger we ate them in a couple of minutes.The kicker is that they forgot our side of beans They had charged us for it (before the delivery guy partially comped us).Guero's has the potential to be good if they get their service together. The woman I talked to said ""Sorry"" about our wait, but she didn't seem genuinely apologetic. I get that they were understaffed and had a flood of orders, but at that point they should've a. stopped taking delivery orders and b. started comping the ones that were taking hours to go out. Instead they sent us cold food and messed up our order. That's on top of it taking almost three hours to get to us.",2.0

Fortunately, the stars aligned, and a taco joint serving delicious breakfast tacos opened up a couple blocks from my apartment. Keep in mind that Gueros only serves breakfast tacos on Saturdays and Sundays and only until 4.Oh guys. These breakfast tacos. They are as delicious as they are tiny.

"The wait was too long at Chavela's so we ended up going to Gueros.  The tacos were excellent.  I ordered the blackened fish.  Yum.  My only regret is not getting the fried avocado and jalapeno as my friend's looked amazing.  We saw so many orders of vegetarian nachos coming out that looked so delicious that we had to order some.  I can hands down say they are the best nachos I've ever eaten.  There's half an avocado sliced on top of them.  Perfect.  Why not a 5 star experience?  The place is TINY and seems like it has a bit of a cult following.  It was cold out so unless we wanted to freeze we were jammed in there on top of everyone who was eating.  I felt like I was in the way of everything. Also, the woman at the counter was pretty rude.  Other than that, if your'e in the area and want some delicious tacos at a good price, I'd go here.",4.0
"Mmmmm....  I've been into tacos lately. And the bonus here is that Gueros is in my 'hood. Happy am I. And hungry am I. So let's eat.The roasted vegetable taco. Refried beans, roasted zucchini, corn, red onions, pico de gallo. Exactly what you'd expect with roasted veggies--tasty, tho a little hard to eat, as the ingredients were a little too wet and the tortilla fell apart.Blackened catfish. The catfish was super moist and intensely flavored. There was a nice smokiness and char to it. The pico, lettuce, and crema rounded it out perfectly.My fave of the 3... The fried avocado and jalapeño. The fried avocado wasn't too heavy but perfectly crispy and creamy. The creaminess mellowed out the jalapeño, and the pico, lettuce and crema made it all work. This was totally well-balanced.Overall, the tacos were a little on the small side, but otherwise filling and tasty. I welcome new food options in my neighborhood, as I'm pretty much always hungry.So I'll definitely be back here... it's a given.",4.0
"I ONLY HAVE EYES FOR YOU, fried avocado tacos! My favorite taco in New York, for sure.I've eaten in at Guero's, done take-out once, delivery twice (um, maybe within the same week). Always really sweet, laid-back service. There's a counter for ordering where they'll take your name and after a couple minutes they'll bring out yr food (WHICH IS SO GOOD).Skip the guacamole and chips (the one mediocre thing I've had here--the chips are kinda flavorless and lack salt) and focus on tacos.

Black beans with a little bit of a thick soup, some greens, topped with a finely grated very dry cheese, tons of flavor. Margaritas are also solid (frozen or on the rocks year-round).

"When I first heard about the breakfast taco phenomenon from some Austin natives, I knew my stomach would not rest until I had had them. Fortunately, the stars aligned, and a taco joint serving delicious breakfast tacos opened up a couple blocks from my apartment. Keep in mind that Gueros only serves breakfast tacos on Saturdays and Sundays and only until 4.Oh guys. These breakfast tacos. They are as delicious as they are tiny. You'll eat two (at $3 each), and you will want to run it back about two more times. I recommend purchasing as many tacos as you have cash in your wallet. What a way to start your day.",4.0

"The wait was too long at Chavela's so we ended up going to Gueros.  The tacos were excellent.  I ordered the blackened fish.  Yum.  My only regret is not getting the fried avocado and jalapeno as my friend's looked amazing.  We saw so many orders of vegetarian nachos coming out that looked so delicious that we had to order some.  I can hands down say they are the best nachos I've ever eaten.  There's half an avocado sliced on top of them.  Perfect.  Why not a 5 star experience?  The place is TINY and seems like it has a bit of a cult following.  It was cold out so unless we wanted to freeze we were jammed in there on top of everyone who was eating.  I felt like I was in the way of everything. Also, the woman at the counter was pretty rude.  Other than that, if your'e in the area and want some delicious tacos at a good price, I'd go here.",4.0
"Mmmmm....  I've been into tacos lately. And the bonus here is that Gueros is in my 'hood. Happy am I. And hungry am I. So let's eat.The roasted vegetable taco. Refried beans, roasted zucchini, corn, red onions, pico de gallo. Exactly what you'd expect with roasted veggies--tasty, tho a little hard to eat, as the ingredients were a little too wet and the tortilla fell apart.Blackened catfish. The catfish was super moist and intensely flavored. There was a nice smokiness and char to it. The pico, lettuce, and crema rounded it out perfectly.My fave of the 3... The fried avocado and jalapeño. The fried avocado wasn't too heavy but perfectly crispy and creamy. The creaminess mellowed out the jalapeño, and the pico, lettuce and crema made it all work. This was totally well-balanced.Overall, the tacos were a little on the small side, but otherwise filling and tasty. I welcome new food options in my neighborhood, as I'm pretty much always hungry.So I'll definitely be back here... it's a given.",4.0
"I ONLY HAVE EYES FOR YOU, fried avocado tacos! My favorite taco in New York, for sure.I've eaten in at Guero's, done take-out once, delivery twice (um, maybe within the same week).

There's a counter for ordering where they'll take your name and after a couple minutes they'll bring out yr food (WHICH IS SO GOOD).Skip the guacamole and chips (the one mediocre thing I've had here--the chips are kinda flavorless and lack salt) and focus on tacos. The breakfast veggie tacos are good, the roasted vegetable taco is also very delicious, but man oh man the fried avocado & jalapeno tacos are the STAR.

"This place is a warm n' welcome Mexican outpost in a desert of hair salons and bodegas. It's got some of the best tacos I've had on this side of the Mason Dixon.Outside, long raw-wood benches let patrons wait for subway-trapped friends, soak up some sun, or simply enjoy their dinner under the  stars.There's a sprinkling of cafe tables and a short bar dotted around the warmly lit interior. Slightly off-hours are best, 'cause the seats fill up fast with patrons and delicious kitchen aromas.The counter-folks are friendly and funny, and they look like they're having...fun with their  new restraunt!  What did I order? The fried catfish taco is firm, flakey and refreshingly...not breaded. The pulled pork taco is a robust and spicy treat. Their house Chorizo simply sings. Dios mio, I only wish they were wrapped like the sturdier two-tortilla models i enjoyed in Texas.

"This place is a warm n' welcome Mexican outpost in a desert of hair salons and bodegas. It's got some of the best tacos I've had on this side of the Mason Dixon.Outside, long raw-wood benches let patrons wait for subway-trapped friends, soak up some sun, or simply enjoy their dinner under the  stars.There's a sprinkling of cafe tables and a short bar dotted around the warmly lit interior. Slightly off-hours are best, 'cause the seats fill up fast with patrons and delicious kitchen aromas.The counter-folks are friendly and funny, and they look like they're having...fun with their  new restraunt!  What did I order? The fried catfish taco is firm, flakey and refreshingly...not breaded. The pulled pork taco is a robust and spicy treat. Their house Chorizo simply sings. Dios mio, I only wish they were wrapped like the sturdier two-tortilla models i enjoyed in Texas. A solid Mexican and Texan beer selection make this little shop a solid choice for lunch or dinner.",4.0
"LOVE this place. Not expensive at all. Although it can add up when you tack on chips and guac and sides, etc. it can get up there. BUT, this is why you plan ahead and share! The most I have ever spent there was $22 on a meal (but I had a large margarita and chips and guac with my tacos). Otherwise, if you just want to settle on tacos, they range around $3-4 each.Definite must haves:fried avocado tacos (GET IT)blackened catfish tacoshouse made chips and the GUAC. Please get the GUAC. You won't regret it.One last thing. The fresh margaritas are amazing. You have the option of frozen or on the rocks. I wish there was in Greenpoint is all I have to say.",5.0

"Gueros is AMAZING!  The nachos are the best nachos EVER!  The delicious, ooey, gooey queso!!!  And don't get me started on the margaritas!!! Real juice, quality Tequila and for the price - cant be beat! The tacos are great - not huge or authentic Mexican but high quality products and always hit the spot!  My faves: fried chicken, shrimp and picadillo! It has become our go-to take out at least twice a week - it's an ADDICTION!   Keep up the delicious food!  So glad it's in the neighborhood - only wish it would be open a little later!",5.0

"If ever there were a taco to be found in this town, it's here.

Create-your-own breakfast tacos are available until 4pm on the weekends and are equally filling. We didn't try the margaritas, but they're made with fresh juice and look delicious. Don't skip the guacamole--it's also made with super fresh, local ingredients and is chunky perfection. The portions are bigger than you'd expect, so start with two tacos.

"Best margarita I've ever had: fresh lime juice, low sugar.  Tacos are all interesting and fresh.  I prefer the corn tortillas.  The veggie taco, al pastor, brisket, and shrimp tacos were quite flavorful and as well. Not happy with the lines and waiting, but when 2 cooks have to serve 20 people, what can you expect?  The owners are friendly and the prices are good! I also love that this place composts everything. They recycle the bottles and cans, and only foil and outside trash is actually thrown away (although they could do a better job of delineating the two, since I always see compostable materials in the trash.) All in all, a great place for a quick bite.",4.0
"I love Gueros!  Outdoor seating is a must in the summertime.  Perfect combo, eat outside, 1/2 and 1/2 frozen margarita, fried avocado taco, queso and chips.  Laid back atmosphere and counter service is perfect for meeting up with friends after work.  I dream about this spot regularly!!!",5.0

"I keep trying to like this place, but the food is sub-par and the waits are always ridiculous. The queso is the one thing that is made well there, but the chips are always overcooked and too greasy. How hard is it to mess up chips? The fish and shrimp always taste a little old and are a bit rubbery. The pastor has no flavor. On the upside, the people are nice and the margaritas are pretty cheap, but Chavella's is a lot better for food and is less crowded.",1.0

"The only reason this place isn't getting 5 stars is because sometimes it takes quite a while to even place an order let alone get your tacos. But Gueros is awesome. I was born and bred as a southern California taco fiend and this place is one of the best I've visited since I've been in NYC. I think you can usually judge a place by the quality of its hot sauce and its chips, and this place wins in both arenas. The Chips and Guacamole are AMAZING - fat, crispy, slightly greasy, adequately salted chips with simple yet tasty guacamole. And their HOT SAUCE is hot and perfect. I think I have eaten about 30 fried avocado jalapeño tacos - I can't get enough. They even have a roasted vegetable taco (good, but hard to win against fried avocado).Various friends have raved about the awesomeness of the meat tacos (I think the fried chicken taco has been the biggest hit), and the selection of meats does look so delicious that sometimes my vegetarianism is tested.Regular margaritas are awesome and after just 1 small margarita and two tacos I leave happily tipsy. And they have taco happy hour ($1 off a taco).Breakfast tacos (veggie) are also delicious if you can stop by on a weekend morning.

Another 20 minutes later (50 min at this point), I went back up to ask for a refund as waiting 50 minutes for 2 tacos is insane when people who just came in 10 minutes before were already eating. The cashier finally moved my ticket up and my 2 tacos came out an hour after I ordered. Turns out I wasn't the only irrirated person, as they had also completely forgotten about the order before me and that dude was pretty pissed too.As this place grows and gets more popular, they really need to think about who they put at  the counter to man orders.

"This place has great food. The ground beef taco is simply amazing, and the fried chicken taco is great too. I have to knock a couple of stars off though, because the English lady that answers the phone is the rudest order taker I have ever come across in the great city of New York. She has no concept of customer service.  My rate of actually getting an order in with her hovers at around 50%. She has hung up on me before, told me that, yes, they take credit cards, but no she won't take mine because she's busy and doesn't need to, and generally copped an attitude literally every time I've spoken to her.  She left my wife on hold forever and then came back on the line and called her a bitch when my wife asked if she was going to be able to order. In short, the great food has this lady getting too big for her britches. She does her job astoundingly poorly. She should be fired. We don't order from Gueros anymore. After all, it's just Mexican food. There are other options that won't leave me feeling like they're doing me the favor of letting me order from them.",3.0

This is a great neighborhood place! XOXO",5.0
"Terrific!  Very cute little place with very good tacos and sides.  We tried five or six of their tacos, and almost all were quite good.  Personally, I usually prefer traditional Mexican street tacos (ala Sunset Park--soft, pliable, greasy, nothing more than meat and a pile of cilantro and salsa--hecka tasty), but these--which are decidedly NOT greasy (the tortillas are rather dry, but in that fire toasted way a lot of people like), are good in their own way.  Good ingredients, good combinations.  The fried avocado and jalapeno taco is super good!  The meat in the steak tacos (brisket and hangar) is noticeably high quality and cooked with skill.  The only taco I didn't like much is the fried chicken taco, which was a little too bland and way overcooked and dry.  (Why not make it with thigh meat?? So much tastier and juicier, plus it's cheaper! If you stick with breast meat, you gotta work hard to not overcook it.  And pickled onion or slaw would pair with the fried chicken better than lettuce and tomato, in my opinion.)  The chips and cheese were awesome (and a huge portion).  We went during happy hour, so tacos were all $1 off, making them a very fair price, particularly given the quality of ingredients.  I look forward to trying more of the sides next time!  My only other rec/wish: that there would be a standard Mexican offering of delicious ground salsas (red, green, hot, mild) to top each taco with, rather than just hot sauce.Note: don't just look at the board to order; pick up a menu, as it details everything so you know what's actually in each taco, as the combos are all different.Also note: if you are looking to do anything other than stuff your belly (i.e., if you care about the food you eat), ignore the reviews that say Tacos de los Muertos on Washington is better or as good.  Not even in the same league.  Muertos tacos are bigger, sure, and aren't bad if you know what you're getting, but just nothing anyone might call quality or artisinal or whatnot.  No comparison.",4.0
"5 stars? What am I thinking? You should NOT go here. Because then I won't be able to get a seat to get my fill of tasty tacos. I'm vegetarian mostly, so I've only experienced the beans, guac, fried avo and grilled veg tacos, but wow. So good! The margaritas are also awesome. This is pretty much my go-to place, and I think I've been there basically three times a week since I found out about it. Totally different from Chavela's, both are worthy of love and adoration.",5.0
Kind of addicted. The only reason I don't give 5 stars is the space is small and sometimes during their busy hours there can be a wait. Hopefully they will expand. The staff is also really nice.,4.0
"Went for first time last week to get takeout and got 5 different tacos to try at home.  Overall the meat was a bit dry, and 3 of the tacos were laughable in how little meat/food was in the tortilla, we thought maybe the rest fell out in the bag somewhere, it didn't.  Only one taco was impressively full and would be considered a good value.  Normally I'd give this experience 1 or 2 stars, but since this was only my first time, giving a 3 until I head back a couple more times to see if the experience changes.",3.0
"I decided to give Guero's a try after reading about it in NY Mag.  I'm a Texas transplant and was excited about a place that seemingly had authentic breakfast tacos.  Guero's was SUCH a disappointment!  Their breakfast tacos are super small and overpriced, not good, the wait to go was really long, and they managed to get both my order and the order before mine wrong.  This was particularly frustrating after the long wait just to get our order.  They do not have enough staff or space to deal with the amount of customers in there, and the tacos themselves were just a disappointment all around.  I would avoid this place if you are looking for anything resembling authentic breakfast tacos.",1.0
"Super tasty at a not too bad price. The fried avocado and jalapeño taco and the steak are my top two, and the shrimp are really good as well. The only warning I will give is to be weary of the quesadillas which are WAY overpriced. At  $7 they are already the most expensive item on the menu, but to add chicken or steak it's an additional $3.  $10 for a quesadilla would be fine, however they are soooo tiny, and they come with nothing. They are using their small soft taco shells to make them and one will not fill you up unless you are a small child. While they are tasty,  for the same price, you could go to Taqueria de los Muertos around the corner and get a quesadilla (using a burrito shell) with beans, guacamole, salsa on the side and a drink. I paid $20 for two thinking it would be a good lunch, but really it was a really expensive amuse bouche. I hope they fix that pricing error, or make the quesadillas larger enough to warrant the price. Otherwise/over all, an excellent addition to the neighborhood. Also, best guacamole in the area.",4.0
"yum! it's nice to have such good food so close to my house. so far I've only tried the shrip tacos and guac but I hope to try the margaritas soon.  the prices are reasonable, the staff is pleasant and somehow they've created a good amount of seating in a tiny spot. good luck Gueros!",4.0
"This place has great food. The ground beef taco is simply amazing, and the fried chicken taco is great too. I have to knock a couple of stars off though, because the English lady that answers the phone is the rudest order taker I have ever come across in the great city of New York. She has no concept of customer service.  My rate of actually getting an order in with her hovers at around 50%. She has hung up on me before, told me that, yes, they take credit cards, but no she won't take mine because she's busy and doesn't need to, and generally copped an attitude literally every time I've spoken to her.  She left my wife on hold forever and then came back on the line and called her a bitch when my wife asked if she was going to be able to order. In short, the great food has this lady getting too big for her britches. She does her job astoundingly poorly. She should be fired. We don't order from Gueros anymore. After all, it's just Mexican food. There are other options that won't leave me feeling like they're doing me the favor of letting me order from them.",3.0
"I've been patronizing Gueros for a couple of months now and, while there have admittedly been a few minor ""new-biz"" glitches (a slightly botched order, slow delivery, etc), the food and drink are consistently delicious, reasonably priced and the vibe here is really friendly/nice. This is a great neighborhood place! XOXO",5.0
