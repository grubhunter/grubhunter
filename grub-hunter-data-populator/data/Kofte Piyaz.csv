"Really really like this tiny hole in the wall!  Ever since visiting Istanbul, we've been sort of on a kick to check out good Turkish restaurant across the city.  Read great reviews about this place so when the opportunity arose to visit during off-peak time (we didn't want to wait for a table since it's a small place), we went.  The menu is somewhat limited, but we were fine with what's on it.  Ordered the chicken kabab platter and the beef meatball platter.  Sooo yummy. Chicken was tender, juicy, and just right. Beef meatballs were also right on point. I often find Middle Eastern beef a little too gamey, but this dish did not taste that way.  The warm potato salad is also recommended. I wish they offered Turkish breakfast!  The hunt for NYC Turkish breakfast continues.",5.0
"Bruh. Kofte Piyaz is the best. The tasty sausages. The freshly baked bread. The sumptuous almond pudding. And to top it all off, the coolest old guy ever in charge",5.0
"Absolutely lovely cafe! :Staff: There was one man working when I went; he was very kind and interesting to talk to. He also was attentive, but not overbearing; quick to serve, but let me sit there and enjoy my tea and book. Atmosphere: it is a small space, 4 tables with 4 chairs at each. Everything was very clean. There were small pictures on the walls.Food: Unfortunately I did not try much [yet!]. I had their turkish apple tea, which was delicious, of course, and their cacik. Cacik is a yogurt-type dish that has cucumbers, garlic, and mint in it. I never had it before, but man is it delicious!! So fresh and refreshing! The menu items were fairly priced. Heads up - they have a credit card minimum of $10. Overall, 10/10. Great cafe for an intimate get together, or alone time.",5.0
"Don't be discouraged if you walk in here on a weekday and it's utterly empty. It's a blessing in disguise because you'll have the best service ever.  I had the grilled meatball sandwich and boy was it delicious. Basically it's meat, a piece of romaine lettuce, some tomatoes, all sandwiched between soft warm toasted bread. Simple yet amazing with every bite. Of course I finished it off with their lentil soup. Whether or not you're a fan of lentil, you should try this. End your night with their homemade almond pudding. Do believe the hype, it is good.I can't wait to come back to try the rest.",5.0
"We got the mixed grill, lentil soup, white bean salad, and a tomato coban salad. The meat was very fresh but the portion was very small. The salads that we ordered were amazing and refreshing. The salad that came with the mixed grill was too salty. The lentil soup was nothing special and too watery in my opinion. The aryan yogurt drink was the same, seemed kinda watered down. Overall a wonderful experience and would gladly come back again.",4.0
"If this were ""Kofte Pizazz"" then it would have a real flair and uniqueness about it. Whereas if it were ""Kofte Piyano"" then it would be a badly spelled music store that also did kebabs. And if it were ""Kofte P*nis"" then it would be your p*nis looking like a Kofte Kebab, which would be... weird. And would probably mean you should see a doctor as soon as possible.What to get: Kofte KebabWhat else: Starlight is sitting on my lap, waiting to see the vetJust a short and sweet appraisal of one of my favourite kebabs in NYC. The reason I like it so much is that Steve Gutterberg told me I had to like it. And by Guttenberg I mean Yelp. I was looking for delicious kebabs and Yelp told me to come in and try this Kofte. So I did.The wait time wasn't too long (under 10 mins) and the kebab was juicy as hell and tender as a dream, tasty and spiced and delicious. A real concoction of kebab heaven. It's definitely one of the better Koftes in the region. I haven't always been thrilled by North American kebabs, and compared to the vast majority, this is pure heaven. Compared to what you get over in Europe, it may not be stratospheric but it certainly hits the spot and if you're a fan of kebabs, you should not miss out on giving it a try. They're very friendly people, too.And if it were Kofte Pilau, it'd mainly just sell rice dishes. In fact it's not, and it doesn't, and Starlight's hair is getting all over my keyboard because she's nervous. And that's about all I have to report today.",5.0
"Small, unassiming gem of a place with a peach of an owner who obviously takes pride in his cooking and rightfully so. I had its namesake meatball with cheese. Nothing like American meatballs--smaller, lighter, grilled, and perfect for hot summer days. Also had the Turkish coban salad, which was ok. Next time, I will try the white beans salad instead.The owner gave each of us a free piece of chicken shish kebab, ""to get a taste."" I now know what I'll definitely be getting the next time, as well as its famous lentil soup.And if you do not get the almond pudding for dessert, well, no one can help you. Even my bf, who's allergic to dairy AND nuts, couldn't resist and scarfed it down. To paraphrase Woody Allen, the stomach wants what the stomach wants.",3.0
This place is amazing. The food is incredible quality. We got the lamb platter and mixed platter. I highly recommend the wheat pilaf. It's small and often ran by the owner who is sooo nice. He's quiet at first but once you engage him he's so smiley and friendly.,5.0
"When I first received my dish, I was annoyed. I was annoyed because I was expecting something hearty. I ended up realizing what I received was delicious and light. I got the grilled beef meatball main course which came with a juicy grilled tomato, romaine lettuce which was drizzled with oil and salt, and the most amazing (and small) pieces of meatball. I imagine the rest of the menu being just as good, if not better, which is why I couldn't give this place 5 stars. Can't wait to try the rest.",4.0
You know that feeling that you thought something was going to turn out good /yummy but turns out to be a huge disappointment.... Yeah....I really wanted to like this place just because the owner/chef/waiter was so nice! Yes! ONE person in charge of everything....This place was sooo small too....I felt like the area was extremely cramped...for table seatings...only three...if I knew this place was going to be this cramped I would of never came...I can't belive this is an actually restaurant... I ordered the oblong meatball....that also has a variety of specific spices and herbs used in their meatballs ...It is traditionally served with a salad...my salad was drowned in salt and oil....I didn't touch any of my salad! It Was kinda gross....,2.0

"Strolled in to Kofte Piyaz around 3ish yesterday since I was still hungry after eating the lunch I packed -- so much for trying to cut down on my food expenses! The restaurant is teeny tiny with only four tables but there is also bar seating along the counter. Since it was rather late, the place was empty but the owner came out from the back to greet me with a huge smile and welcome as soon as I walked in. I decided on the grilled meatball sandwich which came with romaine salad and fresh tomatoes. This was a delicious sandwich! The meatballs were so tender and flavorful, with the perfect balance of spices. The bread was hot and toasty and the tomatoes were fresh and ripe. Solid sandwich. There is a $10 cc minimum and I had zero cash but he said don't worry about it since I didn't know -- aw! He insisted that I not get anything else just to reach the minimum but I said I was eying the almond pudding anyway. He went ""OKOK fine because I know you will LOVE it. My almond pudding is really good"", hha. He seemed genuinely excited for me to try it as he hurriedly went to the back to get it. Well, I was glad I ordered it. I LOVED it. The almond pudding was creamy, sweet and just absolutely divine. I could not eat it fast enough. There are sliced almonds throughout which gave it a nice texture. The heavy sprinkle of cinnamon on top really brought it all together. I look forward to coming back for the soups and platters!Two lunches. One dessert. All in an hour. Worth it.

The soup was average quality--I'm having trouble understanding why people have called it ""famous."" The largest disappointment was the mixed platter (I split this with my boyfriend). For $15, I got a small plate of under-seasoned (if not unseasoned) grilled meat. There were about 6 pieces, each about the size of a golf ball. Though we were told this is a dish that serves one, I do not think this would be appropriate for one person to eat, nor was it appropriately priced.

An oasis in a drought of greasy food and dingy restaurants, every part of this simple menu is amazing from the lettuce to the bread to the meat, no sauce needed",5.0
Wonderful little neighbourhood gem. The food is really good and my favourite is the kofte sandwich. The owner is very friendly and attentive to your needs. Prices are more than reasonable and if you are in the area you have to give it a try! Also it provides a lovely alternative to the usual latino food which is predominant in sunset park!,5.0
"I was excited to try this place out after reading all of the stellar reviews. Unfortunately, it was a massive disappointment. There are so many better options in the area for this type of food.This is the type of meal that has just given up on itself completely. Something, ANYONE, and I mean anyone, could make at home with no issue at all. The grilled chicken kabobs consisted of 4 small cubes of very dry chicken, a pile of soggy lettuce with ZERO dressing or even salt, and 1 very small soggy ""grilled"" tomato. It's like they had a good concept, and then stripped what could have been a decent meal down to its most bland form.The Coban salad was no better. If you read the description of what it's supposed to be, and then completely forget to add the onion or lemon juice, and then soak it in too much oil, that's what you're going to get. If eating a bowl of parsley is your go-to lunch, then this is for you!The customer service is also incredibly poor. If you mess up an order, you should not treat the customer as though they were the one who made the mistake, and then not offer any way to fix the problem. An all around disappointment.",2.0
"Made the trek out to Sunset Park w/ my boyfriend to try out this little cafe on 5th Avenue. The owner/server/chef was very charming and kind- and his food was equally amazing. We tried the lentil soup (probably one of the best I've ever had), the turkish coban (pronounced shoh-bahn) salad, and the mixed platter for apps and entrees. The platter could've had a bit more meat in there but when paired w/ the salad it was just enough to fill our stomachs and leave room for the plat de resistance: the almond pudding! E and I paired it with cups of traditional turkish tea and we fought each other for the last bite (the only time I've ever seen my bf fight me over dessert). All in all, the meal cost around $37 for both of us including tax and tip. Sooo good.Extra star earned for playing Anggun's Snow on the Sahara. Yesss.",5.0
The food here was absolutely amazing. I came with two of my friends and they ordered entrees and I got a lamb sausage sandwich and it was totally bomb. We all got the almond pudding for dessert and it was the best dessert I've ever had. I would come back just for the dessert. The place is really small and cozy and the guy does everything by himself. Definitely going to come back!,5.0

"This is a small restaurant with just a few tables and the menu is very limited. I had the red lentil soup, mix platter, turkish tea, turkish coffee, almond pudding and baklava. The soup is creamy and sour. It was ok. The mix platter consist of grilled meatball, meatball with cheese, chicken, and lamb sausage with a little bit of salad. I like that the salad was tossed in dressing. The mix platter of various meats was delicious. The Turkish tea was nothing special, tasteless, and the cup was tiny. The Turkish coffee is served in this very cool looking cup and it is very tiny as well. The coffee was very bitter, not a fan. The almond pudding was my favorite and the baklava was disappointing. I would come back for the meat and pudding and skip the rest.",3.0

"OK so I recently moved into the neighborhood after having lived in Manhattan and Park Slope, I was unsure of what to make of the food options around. I must say Kofte Piyaz has easily been the highlight of this neighborhood for me. Literally everything I have had there is delicious, flavorful and tastes so fresh. The owner is extremely friendly and welcoming without being annoying and you can sense that he tries his best to make everything he serves as good as it can be. The best items I had were the lamb sausage (MUST HAVE INCREDIBLE!) as well as the white bean salad, the eggplant and the borek. The mix meatball platter was also excellent but I just loved the lamb sausage so much that that's all I get now.....I've had Turkish food in Turkey and this is honestly better than most of what I had there.....Finally, it is soooo cheap!

I'd recommend the Lamb for sure), and very affordable, but what cinches this as a must for me is the attitude of the place: Small and cozy, with a very personal feel.

I spent $40.00 on delivery, waited an hour and didn't receive my full order. Once the order arrived, he told me that he delivered all the right food. After arguing with me, he insisted I was wrong.

"This place is a hidden gem.Two weeks ago I wanted to take my buddy, who was in town, to a great place in the neighborhood on the cheap (he's someone who appreciates a good deal more than an expensive restaurant). My girlfriend took a look at Yelp to see what was highly rated and found Kofte Piyaz.I don't consider myself an expert when it comes to Middle Eastern food but this place did an amazing job of sticking to a simple, tasty and amazingly priced menu.When we arrived we were greeted with a smile and allowed to take a seat wherever we liked. The seating is cozy and very clean. After looking at the menu for about 5 minutes we decided to try a little bit of everything from the Borek and Red Lentil Soup to the Sampler Platter and Meatball Sandwich. For dessert we had two Almond Puddings.Here are my thoughts:Borek- A nice light dish that got my appetite going. I wasn't blown away by it but it was a nice starter.Red Lentil Soup- Wow! One of the tastiest soups I've ever had. Perfect temperature and a nice mild spice.Sampler Platter- Best idea ever. Don't know which meatball you'd like? Try them all! I believe this is a recent addition to the menu and it's a smart one. The lamb sausage is my favorite but the others were amazing as well.Meatball Sandwich- It was the same meat my girlfriend and I had on our sampler platter and considering there was not a crumb on my friend's plate he seemed to enjoy it as much as we did.Almond Pudding- Everyone was making audible noises at our table as we shared this tasty dessert. It was so rich and sumptuous. We were told we got the last two for the weekend. Good thing he wasn't open Monday or else my girlfriend and I would have gone back for more!Overall Kofte Piyaz was a simple, tasty, tiny gem. I feel like I'm the only one in my neighborhood who knows about it. I'm sure that's because the owner makes you feel welcome with his smile and cooks everything fresh when you order.I almost forgot the best part! Total bill for dinner for three with a 20% tip?....ONLY FIFTY DOLLARS?!! Yes, only $50 bucks.I usually spend more than that on dinner for two not including tip when I go out.I'll be back Kofte Piyaz.

My only suggestion would be to either use more meat or smaller bread rolls, because there were some bites that were too bread - heavy. I also got the red lentil soup and it was great. The restaurant itself is small,  with only three tables I think, so just know that it is more of a cafe than an expansive restaurant.

"So I did a big bike ride today and after a couple of hours peddling, started to get a little hungry.  Usually I'm keen for any excuse to grab some Mexican fare in Sunset Park, but I was already slated to have Mexican for dinner.But then I saw a sign for meatballs and I hit the brakes and turned around.   Was this an Italian joint?  A spinoff from the uber hip ball empire from the Lower East Side/b-burg?Nope.  It's a Turkish joint.  Too obvious, right?  Just mention Turkey and everyone thinks of a meatball, not a furniture empire. Say what?But it looked interesting enough to draw me closer.  And there were 2 small tables out front, which means I could park my semi sweaty ass in an outdoor seat plus I didn't have to lash every component of my bike to a pole, which you have to do when leaving it out of sight.   The owner was very nice and I ordered a lamb sausage sandwich, then kicked it out front, watching the street characters including the dirty old man next door flirting with middle school girls. Not soon after did my sandwich arrive, perfectly sized on a nice semi-crunchy roll.  Unlike a lot of Brooklyn bun-based meals, this wasn't looking to over impress and could be eaten in one sitting.  The sausage was also nice, cut in half and easy to chew.  This, plus a drink, was around $7.  Someone at the other table shared a couple of cups of Turkish coffee, which I'd like to try (the Ottomans introduced it to the rest of Europe and have their own style).The food was great and I'll be happy to stop by again on foot or bike.  Plus I love the fact that one can enjoy some Turkish food in an otherwise Latino nabe that was formerly a hub for Norwegian, Irish and Polish immigrants.  God bless America.  God bless Meatballs.  In Brooklyn we trust.",4.0

It looks like Park Slope gentrification is on its way to Sunset Park.If Green Fig Cafe was a good harbinger of great things to come in Sunset Park, Kofte Piyaz (which translates to meatballs & white bean salad, the latter of which I haven't tried yet) is an even more promising indication that the gentrification of Sunset Park, at least initially through high quality ethnic food in a beautiful setting at close to Park Slope prices, is on its way.Outside looks like the facade to Bar Tano, only smaller. The sign reads Grilled Meatball, but whats inside is so much more! It's like an upscale diner with bar stools, 4 maple tables and tasteful faux-wood vinyl flooring).The meatballs are very good, however the red lentil soup, thoroughly liquified, with dry mint sprinkled in a mound on top is a Brooklyn dining MUST-HAVE; possibly the best Red Lentil Soup I've ever had anywhere, though I can't call myself a connoisseur. When they have it in stock, the Cracked Wheat Pilaf with warm cooked tomatoes and red pepper is a real treat, somewhere between a finely prepared risotto and red beans & rice, minus the beans and with those cooked tomatoes mixed in. To top it off, the Almond Pudding with almonds pieces and cinnamon is simply TO DIE FOR. Best dessert I've ever had anywhere in Sunset Park, though I don't want to know how much sugar he uses. It's very very sweet.Amidst the taco trucks, fried chicken places, Mexican & Salvadoran holes in the wall, and the shitty only-for-late-(drunken)-night eating Sunset Diner three doors down, don't overlook this Turkish gem of a restaurant. The owner Murat tells me that the Park Slope set are making their way here to the heretofore unknown stretches of pavement of the mid-30s & even 40s down 5th Avenue.

"So glad I finally decided to come in here after walking by so many times. Really delicious food, so inexpensive. Stepping off of noisy 5th ave, the interior was surprisingly calm and thoughtfully designed. The red lentil soup, which comes sprinkled with crumbled mint leaves, was so delicious and light. Even the bread that came with was notably tasty. I also shared the white bean salad, Turkish salad, and mixed meat platter. The portions were generous for the price, and all very flavorful.

"SO, so good!We shared the borek--a yummy spinach pie--to start.  Mixed meat platter was fantastic, and a great intro to the menu.  Lamb sausage was my favorite, but everything was great, and it was nice to get to try everything.  The salad the meat came with was delicious--fresh, crispy and light with a lovely lemony dressing.  Fresh pita was warm and soft.  No almond pudding the day I went (I'll be back!), so we had baklava, which was very nice.The owner was very friendly and helpful, and directed us to a place where we could buy wine since it is BYOB.I'll be returning frequently!",5.0

"So I did a big bike ride today and after a couple of hours peddling, started to get a little hungry.  Usually I'm keen for any excuse to grab some Mexican fare in Sunset Park, but I was already slated to have Mexican for dinner.But then I saw a sign for meatballs and I hit the brakes and turned around.   Was this an Italian joint?  A spinoff from the uber hip ball empire from the Lower East Side/b-burg?Nope.  It's a Turkish joint.  Too obvious, right?  Just mention Turkey and everyone thinks of a meatball, not a furniture empire. Say what?But it looked interesting enough to draw me closer.  And there were 2 small tables out front, which means I could park my semi sweaty ass in an outdoor seat plus I didn't have to lash every component of my bike to a pole, which you have to do when leaving it out of sight.   The owner was very nice and I ordered a lamb sausage sandwich, then kicked it out front, watching the street characters including the dirty old man next door flirting with middle school girls. Not soon after did my sandwich arrive, perfectly sized on a nice semi-crunchy roll.  Unlike a lot of Brooklyn bun-based meals, this wasn't looking to over impress and could be eaten in one sitting.  The sausage was also nice, cut in half and easy to chew.  This, plus a drink, was around $7.  Someone at the other table shared a couple of cups of Turkish coffee, which I'd like to try (the Ottomans introduced it to the rest of Europe and have their own style).The food was great and I'll be happy to stop by again on foot or bike.  Plus I love the fact that one can enjoy some Turkish food in an otherwise Latino nabe that was formerly a hub for Norwegian, Irish and Polish immigrants.  God bless America.  God bless Meatballs.  In Brooklyn we trust.",4.0

We had filled ourselves with salad, delicious Turkish bread, and simple but fantastic kofte  (meatballs), when he came to our table pushing almond pudding.  No way, I thought, he is just trying to clear inventory before it goes bad.  But it was Sunday and we had nowhere to be, so we said ""why not"".  I'm happy to report that this was a very wise decision.  Again, simple, but incredibly well balanced, it was a perfect afternoon dessert and was gone in a matter of a couple minutes.  Bottom line:  give it a go, you won't be disappointed... unless you are in a rush.",4.0

"I'm bumping this little joint up a star, because I had another fantastic time here, and I can't get over how good the food is for such little money. Dinner for four (with appetizers and dessert) was $56. Fifty-six f-ing dollars! Sure, we brought our own wine, but still - I've paid much more for much less many times in my life. Kofte Piyaz makes me feel like a genius just for knowing about it. It's great for a casual, romantic meal, yet you can still impress the hell out of your friends by bringing them here.The food is the star of the show: the red lentil soup and table bread are out of this world. I'm not exaggerating by saying it's worth going out of your way just to have a bowl of the soup here! The eggplant with garlic and tomatoes was typical, but very well executed. A warm potato salad took things a little outside of the Turkish theme, but proved a worthy deviation. The tangy mustard dressing made this humble dish seem elegant, yet bold enough to hang with the other flavors going on here. The mixed grill plates have some stunners on them: the meatballs and lamb sausage are amazing, and with a side this under $10 plate is a meal for two! I normally skip dessert, but here I will not - both the baklava and the almond pudding are top notch. Kofte Piyaz is also a personality driven restaurant. That personality is that of Murat. It's his place. He designed it. He waits the tables. He cooks all the food. The guy is warm, very funny and takes great pride in his restaurant.

The coban salad and red lentil soup are top class. As a one person production, sometimes the dishes at Kofte feels a little pre-made and then heated up. But this is still a restaurant with fantastic meat dishes. A wonderful gem and highly recommended!",4.0
Wow!!! Tried this place for the first time with my friend Harry and wow. Very good service and the mix platter was amazing and the red lentil soup was amazing as well. The almond pudding was so good that I will be back to this place again.,5.0
"Probably one of the very best dining experiences I've had to date. The food, ambiance and service was above and beyond. We ordered our food and order 2n'd and 3rd's as it is affordable and everything is delicious, we couldn't help ourselves.  I will have to come back here every time I visit Brooklyn from now on.

"am on a gluten free sugar free diet so was looking for some place not too far from the hospital we were visiting to get some real food and stumbled upon Kofte Piyaz.  We've always loved Turkish food and this place really is a gem.  A small restaurant with a precise menu that the owner is able to handle and handle well.  We tried the beef kofte, the chicken kofte (really more of a chicken kebab), the buckwheat pillaf (interesting but dull), the salad that comes with the sandwiches (a bit too salty but still tasty and FRESH) but the star of the show was the RED LENTIL SOUP.  I've been to Istanbul twice and loved the food - and have had various renditons of this classic Turkish soup both in Turkey and around NYC - but this was by far the best one I've ever tasted.  Can't wait to go back and have it again soon!  Prices are really inexpensive and portions are great for the price and just because. Service was charming and efficient - it's a one man show and the owner/chef/waiter/dishwasher is charming, kind and proud of his accomplishments - as he should be!  Kudos for a wonderful, affordable spot.",5.0

"Awesome little spot! Had the chicken kabob sandwich, and though disappointed they didn't have any sauces, the owner (very nice guy btw) insisted that the chicken was marinated and the sauce would only serve to distract. He was right! the chicken is juicy and marinated to perfection, and the lettuce lightly dressed with oil. The bread was also very fresh.I definitely plan on going back!",5.0
"Yes, finally a bit more diversity in Sunset Park. Open now for only a few weeks, Kofte Piyaz is a very intimate, contemporary Turkish restaurant, and from what I can observe perhaps the only one of its kind in the area. I welcome, the owner and chef Murak (and hopefully I spelled his name correctly) to the neighborhood.Food was tasty and fresh. The spinach grilled with filo (appetizer), and the meatballs with cheese and lamb sausage served with fresh greens and grilled tomato, accompanied by warm Turkish bread, all combined for an enjoyable early evening dinner. I had my eye on baklava since we first arrived, but considering how full I felt after eating so much, I decided against it. Next time though, for sure. I normally never pass on Baklava.I will correct the first reviewer, Mara, by saying that there are actually four tables, not three (perhaps being new they recently added the forth table). The counter with round stool seating and the well-placed lighting throughout give the place a cafe-like charm. According to Murak, the menu is evolving, so I'm looking forward to seeing more authentic Turkish dishes.",5.0
"Based on the reviews I've read, it appears there's a HUGE discrepancy between delivery/takeout vs sit-in food quality. For one, the takeout portions don't look nearly as abundant as the photos I've seen on yelp, and while I can imagine this is something pretty common in most restaurants, this was more than obvious here. Secondly, when I saw that my sandwich didn't come with romaine salad and grilled tomatoes as clearly stated on their menu, I called the place up and inquired, to which the person on the phone responded, and I quote: ""the salad and tomatoes are IN the sandwich."" I looked inside the sandwich and saw two pieces of lettuce and fresh (not grilled) tomatoes and immediately knew he was lying through his teeth. In addition, the lettuce was completely soaked in grease. All in all, a terrible experience for me, personally. But again, I can speak for their sit-in service. I should have taken 33 dollars and flushed it down the toilet, and it would have been better spent than on the awful food from here. So I guess the main takeaway is don't ever order takeout from this place.",1.0
"My husband and I wandered down down to Kofte Piyaz for dinner tonight, on a neighbor's advice, and we just loved it. The place is spotless and lovely, with a few cozy tables and a mirrored view of the chef/owner cooking up their homemade treats. The red lentil soup was incredibly fresh - it tasted as though it had been made just for us! I had the kofte, which were perfectly fried and not at all greasy, and just the right balance of aromatic herbs. The owner was incredibly nice and brought us a small sample of the piyaz, the white bean dish which is another specialty. Everything was so fresh, even the homemade lemonade. We finished the meal with baclava, which was also delicious; I'm Greek but I prefer Turkish baclava because it's not overly sweet with honey, but more nutty. This one didn't disappoint!Everything about the place, and the owners, is wonderful. We're so happy to welcome this new gem to the neighborhood and will be back many times, I'm sure.",5.0

The Bakalava was a cheap sugary mess, the kind you get in any low rent  so called Greek / Mediterranean establishment. sweet congealed honey, nuts so small and tasteless, they could be peanuts or  almonds instead of walnuts or pistachios .

"Now let me start by saying that it was a great surprise to find a Turkish restaurant in Sunset Park. As a girl coming from the Balkans region, I am used to the Greek and Turkish cuisine so it is great to see a little Turkish joint amongst the zillion mexican places:) On the review....this would have easily been a 5 star review, hadI not ordered the borek. I tried the beef kofte sandwich which was A++, the bean salad which was B- and the Borek which was utterly disgusting. First let me get the awful out of the way - the borek...was a joke, it was a tiny square, flat as a piece of pita bread, soggy with oil and tasted like I was eating a piece of cardboard soaked in oil. A borek should have at least several layers of filo pastry with filling to  get a good consistency and taste. This was one flat layer, thin as pizza and completely soaked with oil. I can make it better, which means it was prettay bad. The bean salad was not bad but nothing spectacular either, I would give it B-/ C+. It probably could have used some more spices and tomatoes. On to the really good: I will come back of course because of the amazing sandwich I got . I did not expect to get a huge sandwich when I ordered the grilled beef kofte with cheese. i was expecting a bun but instead got a  baguette sandwich with at least 4 pieces of kofte. It was really delicious, the bread was great and the kofte were awesome- grilled nicely with great balance of herbs- just like back at home. I could not figure out what the cheese was( I think it had melted by the time I got to the sandwich) but it did give the perfect final touch. I would order this over and over again especially for the great price of around $6.

I had the kofte sandwich and the fries- all of it was so good we ordered a second batch of fries which come out hot and crispy and salty..

"Get one of the sandwiches.  The bread is amazing and the meat is perfectly spiced.  Get the piyaz-- it is light and healthy.  Get the lentil soup--this is proper Turkish lentil soup, so it is pureed, not like the soup you may find at a Lebanese restaurant.  In order to understand just how good this place is, and why there are not more selections, such as kababs and things like that, you have to know what subgenre the restaurant falls into.  It's a proper kofte cafe.  Stop in for the chicken or kofte sandwich.  Have some turkish tea or turkish coffee.  Your total bill may come to six dollars.  It will be worth it.  I go there at least 4 or 5 times a week, and I used to live with two Turkish guys in the middle of a Turkish-American community.  It's BYOB, so enjoy with your friends.  The sandwiches are the best deal, by the way, and I'm a cheap bastard.  They are also my favorite thing on the menu.  I stick to piyaz, the turkish salad, the lentil soup, and the sandwiches.",5.0
"This place is great, and adds a little culinary variety to the neighborhood. I've stopped by for lunch a handful of times, and the owner is very friendly, the food, baklava and coffee is delicious. Delivery can be a bit slow at times, but I think it's only the owner and one other woman helping to run the place? I highly recommend if you're looking for some Turkish in Sunset.",4.0
"Great addition to the ethnic options in Sunset Park. The Turkish meatballs are sublime, and everything is very fresh and not the least bit greasy. The place is small, but cozy, and the owner Murat is incredibly welcoming. You feel like you're having dinner at the house of a friend who happens to be a great cook. Bonus: everything is incredibly cheap, with no one dish hitting the double digits.",5.0
"Had a lovely meal here with my 3 yo daughter, who adored the chicken soup.  The grilled meatball sandwich could have used some dressing, but overall I was happy with our meal and delighted to have a new and decent restaurant in the neighborhood.",4.0
"Great addition to the neighborhood, the friendly owner makes you feel more than welcome. I have tried and enjoyed the lentil soup, pilaf, grilled meat sandwich, various salads, turkish coffee, apple tea, rice pudding and sweet squash dessert.  I recommend them all.  Also accomodating to vegetarians as well as meat eaters.
