"What was the best meal I had last year? Tough to say. Though my meal at Bergen Hill was a rememberable one for sure. I kept hearing about Bergen Hill from friends, and now I'm doing the same. I can't stop raving about the place. I finally made my first trip last summer. No tables available, but that's cool. We got to sit right in front of the chef. There's no better spot. My man was cooking right in front of us. Letting us try things. Telling us all kinds of information. That's where you want to sit. We got three dishes and a nice bottle of white. We started out with the cauliflower toast, with raisins, pine nuts, and grape. Amazing starter. Next up was the Hen of the Woods, mushroom purèe. kohlrabi. pickled hon shimeji. My mouth is watering thinking about it. For our main we got the Octopus, onion purèe, farro, broccolini, raisin, harissa vinaigrette. This completed the slam dunk that was our meal. I love octopus when it done right. And they do it better than just right. They do it perfect.  We also got some cocktails. One cocktail I got was unbelievable, it was called Bone or something like that. One of the tastiest concoctions I've ever tasted. It was such a great experience. All while they're playing great tunes, providing us with impeccable service, and a wonderful atmosphere. Bergen Hill is more than a restaurant. It's an experience. They hit on every level. Now stop reading this and make plans to check them out.",5.0
"This is a very very small restaurant that does not lack any flavor.  The kitchen is right in the public eye as you are able to dine at the chef's table.  The two recommended dishes here are the hamachi and octopus.  The hamachi was so fresh and went well with the avocado puree.  The octopus was the best octopus we ever had.  It was grilled to perfection and had so much flavor.  The kale caesar was different but worth a try though the dressing was really strong.  Don't forget to order the red velvet cake with cream cheese ice cream for dessert!My only complaint is the size of the dishes.  My wife and I devoured each dish as it came within a minute or two.  But overall, worth a try.",4.0
"4.5 stars: Went to Bergen Hill for my birthday after reading so many rave reviews and had a delicious time -- though some dishes just didn't quite meet the hype.Came on a Thursday evening for a 7:30 reservation and was seated immediately by our very kind and knowledgable waiter. This restaurant is indeed small. But there's still space for parties of 4-or-so.The ambiance is home-y and warm (the chef makes everything on a standard cook-top that's right in-the-open!) but I'm not sure I'd call it mind-blowingly romantic. Perhaps it's just me, but some of the furnishings and wood made the space feel a little dated.Anywho, onto the food!We ordered a bunch of dishes to share (that's the way to do it), including:-Hen of the woods mushrooms-Cauliflower toast-Hamachi tartare-Hamachi ribs and collar bone special*-OctopusThe hamachi ribs and collar bone special was the clear winner. There was only one of this rare dish available and my friend and I were the lucky diners who got to enjoy it!I'd never had these cuts of yellowtail before but now I'm not sure I'll be able to eat any other part. The ribs were so meaty, yet so delicate, and the collar bone was insanely flavorful. The sweet, sticky sauce the chef used made this dish unforgettable.My second favorite dish was the octopus, and this is coming from someone with high octopus-expectations (I know that sounds pretentious; bear with me). The meat was perfectly cooked -- which is no easy feat. And the sauce and farro that accompanied it were outstanding as well. It's up there with some of the best octopus I've ever had.The cauliflower toast and hamachi tartare were also tasty, though not as memorable as the hamachi special.I wasn't blown away by the hen of the woods mushrooms. Perhaps I've just been spoiled by the mushrooms at L'Artusi, but these lacked the warmth and nuttiness I was hoping for. Overall, Bergen Hill is an impressive restaurant serving meticulously crafted, fresh food. Looking forward to my next visit!",5.0
"Anyone who reviews Bergen Hill less than a 5 was clearly born without a mouth. Otherwise, they would have tasted what I tasted and given this place the  that it deserves. I'm not going to go into too much detail about the food, but you should really know the follow things:- Fried fingerling potatoes: Do it. - Carrots: Just do it. - Octopus: Do it, really. Both ways if available. - Squid: Did you do it yet?Really though, you can't make a bad choice. And did mention how amazing the staff was? They were very knowledgeable, super sympathetic and accommodating for a coeliac diner, and some of the friendliest people you'll meet in Court Street. PLUS, as if that wasn't enough, our waiter (maybe the owner?) topped off our wine for free during the last course because he wanted the meal to finish perfectly balanced. Honestly, if you haven't been here yet, there's no time like the present.",5.0
"Had an excellent meal at Bergen Hill last night.  As others have already alluded, it's a real panty-dropper.  Small, intimate and romantic with a great beverage program and a menu full of items that are just about perfect for sharing with your partner.  If you're looking for a good date spot or just somewhere to get cozy over some good food and drink, this should be added to your short list.The well-curated wine list and carefully chosen cocktails provide all the social lubricant (or otherwise) you may need to get the sexy train out of the station.  The menu is dominated by seafood, so if that is not your thing for whatever reason, that may be a deal-breaker.  If you're still on board (see what I did there?), there are a few raw items to start things off with.  They offer oysters, tartare, as well as crudo.  For some segue items before hitting the heartier fare, they have a few different types of toasts (cauliflower, salmon or lobster), which are basically crostini on steroids, as well as a couple salads (kale or mushrooms).  Lastly, the heavier items on the menu consist of either langoustine, octopus or squid, all of which are prepared in creative fashion, which I will let you discover at your leisure.Everything sounds, looks and smells amazing, so I don't think there are really any bad decisions to be made here.  Sex in the bathroom isn't necessarily out of the question, but it's a pretty small space and there is only one bathroom, so you've been warned.  Aside from that, this place is a win.  We had seats at the bar directly in front of the food prep area, so it was cool to interact with the chefs and be able to watch everything being prepared.  If you prefer a table, there are a handful of two- and four-tops ringing the room, as well as a decent amount of outdoor seating when weather permits.  The icing on the cake was the service; our server, as well as the bartender and the chefs, were all super nice, helpful and friendly.  They've created a really chill vibe at Bergen Hill (replete with a killer soundtrack, too), and you would do well to check them out.",4.0
"Sloth... one of the seven deadly sins... deadliest when it causes one to miss fantastic restaurants in one's walking radius, forcing a person to endure substandard fare at other lesser establishments.The fault is all mine.  I have known about this place for years.  Every time I walk by I think, ""I should go here.  People seem to like it"".  Several friends have disavowed knowledge of my existence based solely on the fact that I haven't been to Bergen Hill.  They are all correct.  You should not be friends with someone who hasn't eaten here.All that to say, I have finally rejoined the ranks of the worthy.  This. Place. Is. Fantastic!First: The drinks are outrageous... some of the best cocktails I've had.  You can't go wrong.  They go down way too easy.  The Set Sail was my poison... perfectly balanced flavors.Second: The service is unpretentious and engaging.  It's like you're being served dinner at your best friend's house**.  The staff is extremely knowledgeable about all the food and drinks.  They will guide you to the perfect meal no matter (although in all fairness, it's pretty hard to go wrong here).Third: This is some of the best seafood for miles around.  I'm not kidding.  Every dish they brought out just kept getting better and better.  We had 5 items, which made a perfect meal.  Now, while everything was perfect, the standouts were the fluke (PURE. CRACK), the salmon toast, and then the octopus.  I'm now resolved to go back here just to order all the other things I didn't get the first time.Fourth: The atmosphere.  Pro tip... sit at the bar all the way to the left if you can.  There, you'll get to watch Tony work his magic up close.  And if you're really lucky, like I was, a couple of Tony's regulars will be sitting next to you speaking in Soprano-ese as they eat: ""Tone... Tone... o ma gaaad Tone"", ""Tony, this is fu-king ah-maze-in"".So, learn my lesson... don't let sloth stop YOU from experiencing Bergen Hill.**Provided that your best friend is not a douche who invites you over for dinner and makes you bring your own food.",5.0
"Do you like intimate date spots that are at the same time beautiful and laid back?Do you like inventive dishes that look beautiful and taste fantastic?Do you like sexy?Do you want to get laid?This is a small, elegant place with a lot of character, both in the decor and in the dishes. The space is dominated by the bar and the open kitchen (tiny, and with no oven) featuring a butcher-block counter, and a long glass case gleaming with delicious-looking slabs of raw fish. Tables are covered white and blue tiles for a Mediterranean feel.Cocktails are $13, and they are delicious. Poppy Gibson (Aquavit, blanc vermouth, lemon juice, cucumber simple syrup), was deliciously refreshing, and I liked the three little pickled red onion rings in it. In the Char No. 8 (bourbon, Zucca, peated scotch, butters) I loved the smoky undertone.Dishes are medium-small size-wise, perfect to share. I feel that 5 dishes was perfect for 2 people. Keep in mind that prices do not necessarily correlate with size. Chef Andrew D'Ambrosi and his sous-chef Anthony Mongeluzzi previously worked at Le Cirque, and what they create is culinary adventures in flavor: ambitious, really good-looking, and oh so damn tasty!Here is what we had:- Black bass crudo (tomatillo, smoked ramp ponzu, radish, spring greens; $20).- Langoustine (egg yolk carpaccio, matchstick potato, crustacean sauce; $18).- Octopus (onion purée, farro, broccoli rabe, raisin, harissa vinaigrette; $28).- Lobster salad toast (lobster, pickled heart of palm, tarragon oil; $18).- Hen of the woods (mushroom purée, kohlrabi, pickled hon shimeji; $13 -a mushroom 3 ways).- and Grape an yuzu sorbet ($6) to end the evening.It's hard for me to pick just one dish out of a fantastic dinner. The langoustine dish, with its luscious egg yolk carpaccio, would make the most sexy breakfast you've ever had. The octopus, tangled in an embrace of farro and broccoli rabe, is first poached in white wine, and then left to rest for a day, so that the sugars in the wine and the natural fish gelatin caramelize together with the natural gelatin, resulting in a texture that is both nicely chewy and meaty.Do yourself a favor: take a date here. You'll thank me.",5.0
"If you like fresh seafood, well thought-out cocktails, and cozy seating, then you'll love Bergen Hill. They're a relative newcomer to the neighborhood, and their menu is probably one of the most unique ones I've seen.Some things you really need to know before coming to Bergen Hill:-they serve mostly fish (most of it raw). There will probably be cross-contamination with shellfish, so if you're deathly allergic, you'll probably want to skip BH.-they don't really have a full kitchen, and do everything at the bar. They have table top burners for the cooking.-portions are made for sharing and not gigantic, so it's best to order a few things (though with the prices, it does add up).We started out with cocktails. I had a drink with the wonderful name of the Jebroni (bourbon, Salers and Cocchi Americano). Strong and tasty. Also tried the Poppy Gibson, which was Aquavit, Vermouth and cucumber simple syrup. Very refreshing, though a few slices of cucumber would've made it a perfect summertime drink.They also have two of my absolute favorite beers (Saison Dupont and Hitachino).Our bartender/server/manager/everything Laura was great. Super friendly, and really knew her wine and liquors.For food, we started out with the black bass (served raw over tomatillo, ramp ponzu and spring greens). The acidity of the ponzu gave the dish a ceviche-feel, though it was decidedly raw. The bitterness of the ramps and the sweetness of the tomatillos were a good balance.Like I mentioned before, the portions aren't gigantic, which wasn't a problem because it allowed us to order more late night dishes. Our second was the hamachi (with radishes and jalapenos over an avocado sauce... the menu description is a bit off). It was essentially like thick-cut hamachi sashimi with mild jalapeno crudite, sprinkled with togarashi on top. A lot of contrasting flavors, but none of it masked the freshness of the fish. Definitely recommended.Ended the meal with their house-made ice cream. You don't listen to someone describe a toasted marshmallow ice cream served over a graham cracker crumble and choclate sauce without ordering it. You just don't. And it was amazing. It was a deconstructed smore that combined sweet and salty. Amazing way to cap off the meal.Love, love, love Bergen Hill. Hope to be back soon!Also, review #1400!",5.0
"This small, elegant little restaurant is making some of the most beautiful and tasty food in Brooklyn, and it's all the more astonishing when you realize they are doing it without the benefit of flame. In the tiny kitchen, with what looks like just a few induction burners, Andrew D'ambrosi and his staff churn out a brief, focused menu of toasts, vegetables, and seafood. If you only have a chance to order one of each, I would probably recommend the cauliflower, the hen of the woods, and the octopus, respectively. That said, after a few visits, I've yet to come across something I don't love. So you should probably just order everything on the menu...and I suppose you could bring friends to help you eat it all, if that seems more reasonable than doing so yourself. There's nothing wrong with the kale panzanella, I'll never say no to burrata in any form, and the black bass and the hamachi have been steady winners. The small plates all seem to combine the sweet and the savory, balanced by a hint of acid and always keeping texture in mind. Most are complex in terms of ingredients, but the overall effect is simply...very, very good. To go along with such excellent eats, they have friendly and knowledgable staff who will offer great recommendations, as well as a smile and a joke here or there. They make damn good cocktails, and play damn good music (of the eclectic variety: The Strokes, Mos Def, Cream, Zeppelin...things I like). Honestly, Bergen Hill WAS one of my favorite restaurants in Brooklyn. Then they served me the char siu hamachi collar and ribs. This Chinese barbecue treatment of the fish, a rare special from what I understand, was easily one of the most unique and delicious dishes I've ever had the pleasure of stuffing into my face. I made a mess of myself extracting every morsel from between the bones, and I just hope it's on the menu each and every time I return.Now Bergen Hill is one of my favorite restaurants anywhere.",5.0
"Summary:  Affordable for well-composed food. A great spot for a date if you get the corner table.  Better with smaller groups.Atmosphere: Bergen Hill gets a 5 for atmosphere. Always on the look-out for fellow Yelpers, this spot is a great choice for a 3rd (or however long it takes you to get there) date.  This warmly designed interior pulls off neighborhood cool and casual without pretentiousness. You have the choice of bar seating, which faces the kitchen or a small nook of a dining area.  The nook area has 4-6 tables making reservations prudent.  The two end tables are technically 3 tops that could be used as 2 tops. These are key tables for a date as they are adequate size for the family style of service, but tight enough where you will likely be touching under the table quite a lot.  The grid style window will collect snow creating that wonderful quaint winter- romantic mood. NOTE: If with a girl that is just a friend, add someone to the party or indicate it's not a date.  This place was mostly couples.Service:  This is one happy set of servers for a Sunday.  There wasn't a formal hostess when we arrived and it was slightly confusing as staff was busy servicing guests.  Once finally identified, the host/waiter sat us at the table and was quite animated in making sure we had great descriptions of all the food and our needs were met.  All staff appear to be very well-versed in the menu.  I thought it was adorable that he said multiple times, ""I'm going to bring you the food and make sure to describe it to you.""  Indeed, this did occur. While a bit much,it could come in handy given the number of food allergies people appear to have these days.The Food: The menu, to me, is quite affordable give how much effort must go into the food.  5-6 dishes serves 3 people.  On food alone, I have to give it a 4, but atmosphere rounded it up.  While individually each dish is delightful, my issue is that the total composition of the menu lacks a unified point of view, which I'll explain below. Though it keeps it interesting, it doesn't quite allow me to get to know the chef's soul. I'd like to see him commit a bit more and do the hard work of bridging the entire menu into 1 orchestrated perspective.  Hamachi - 4 stars.  Great job on cutting the fish. It was nicely sliced in even, not too thin or thick, texture.  The fish was very fresh, sans any fishy flavor. You lost a star because the white soy ponzo needs to go just a bit longer to correctly salt/flavor all the way through or alternatively go just a bit of a kick further on the togarashiSalmon Toast - 5 stars.  While it may not be the favorite for everyone that evening, the salmon cucumber and herb with feta mixture was the best executed dish of the evening.  Where as the Hamachi is elegantly pallet-cleansing, Japanese,  the Salmon reminds you of rustic Italy.  Still delightful. But these are far different points of view.  Langoustine - 5 stars.  What a delightful re-envisioning of matchstick potatoes. I think it's absolutely brilliant to use the egg as flavor glue keeping the matchsticks together in a way reminiscent of a birds nest a la Asian cuisine. However, this dish is distinctly Modern American in feel, both a positive and a negative as I am on dish three and my brain is trying to orient its pallet vs. having dish after dish build toward a collective chef's point of view. If your food is making love to my mouth, you've just switched gears abruptly 3 times, and not in the good way.Octopus Bourguignon - 5 stars, not on the main menu.  The tenderness of the Octopus is to be applauded, likely the creature died happy being massaged into the perfect texture for a dish. The wine reduction was well executed to infuse the classically french flavors into the octopus thereby removing all the fishiness. The reduction was served over potato (?) fluff that held up less well in the sauce. I think this was the point and therefore am not reducing stars for this, though possibly a slight bit more potato could have been interesting... only slight more though. Same point as above on the abrupt switch. My mouth was American and now its French. Maybe some people are into that, but for me the transitions need to be smoother, dish to dish.Brussel Sprouts - 3.5 stars.  The reality is that everyone else loved this dish for its flavoring. I agree, but believe the Chef slightly overcooked, as I think you want Brussel sprouts to have just a slightly bit more crunch/springiness.  Flavoring was simple and classic.  It served its purpose of having green vegetables for dinner and was good, just not in the same league as the other dishes.Dessert - This changes each night, but was 5 stars and worth trying.Desert composition - 5 stars.  A toasted sweet bread-like thing with slight salt mixed among homemade specialty ice cream. Strawberry sorbet with brandied cherries.  5 stars. Great execution on the brandied cherries.",5.0
Seriously amazing food! The octopus was awesome.....I'm a big fan of octopus and they did it perfectly. Oysters were also very good. Loved the bottled cocktail.

"So much to love about this place.It's a cozy spot with intimate seating and a welcoming atmosphere. I've seen this location go from being a stuffy living room-esque wine and cheese bar (Calpurnia) to an over-the-top red Moulin Rouge-esque fondue bar (Bourgeois Pig), to the current understated and elegant small plates bar, Bergen Hill. Starting off, the bartenders are some of the warmest and most hospitable people you'll find. They are also super knowledgeable and professional and are happy to give tips and suggestions. We started with cocktails and I really loved the Poppy Gibson, which was super refreshing and delicious. You have to give major credit to any restaurant that can turn out such deliciously tasty and well thought out plates without the benefit of an actual kitchen (induction burners for the win!). We were initially just going for drinks, but ended grabbing some food as well. Shared the black bass (tomatillo, smoked ramp ponzu, radish, spring greens) and the hamachi (white soy ponzu, onion, jalapeño, togarashi). Wow. Both dishes were amazing and the fish was extremely fresh and the flavors were so vibrant. We finished with their house-made ice cream, which was toasted marshmallow with a graham cracker crumble and chocolate. Who could ever resist ordering something like this? Not us. It was swoon-worthy.While we were there, a couple came in and explained to the bartender that between the two of them, they had shellfish allergies, gluten-free, dairy-free, and a general dislike of certain foods, including mushrooms, and what could they eat here? Seriously?? Now my first reaction would have been to throw them out of the place, but the bartender was a much better person than me and worked patiently with them to figure out what plates they could eat and offered to substitute certain things for them. That's stellar service there, folks. So glad this place is in my neighborhood! I'll be back.",5.0
"Came here last night to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. I was lucky enough to make a reservation ahead of time and sat at the counter directly in front of the chef. The place is very intimate yet cool at the same time. The menu is tapa style but larger then the usual tapa sizes elsewhere. We were told to order 5-6 dishes to share. The waitress was very informative and came off knowing her stuff which is always a plus. We started off with a bottle of their white wine (forget the name however very decently priced) and also got one of their signature cocktails ""Char 88"", not my style but definitely my boyfriend's style. Anyway, we ordered 6 dishes total: the cauliflower toast, salmon toast (SO GOOD), kale salad with poached quail egg (HOLY HELL SO GOOD), octopus, fluke tartar (BEST TARTAR IVE HAD) and langostino. All were very tasty and made very well. The dishes were deep and complex with loads of flavor that all meshed so well together. What I enjoyed the most was that the chef himself would serve the plates to us and would describe the dish as well; made it feel very personal. Lastly, they were kind enough to put a candle on our dessert which was THE BOMBBBB! I cant stop thinking about it. They served us a bacon stuffed cinnamon roll with a maple frostinggg! OMGGGG! It was so damn good! I could eat like 5 of them. It was overall a very nice experience. The place is costly ($220 after tip & tax) but definitely worth it for a special night out.

Thank you!We got to try their seasonal take on their char no. 8 cocktail which is slightly sweeter but chilled prior to serving instead of on ice.I thoroughly enjoyed my char no. 8 cocktail, as it's peaty, slightly sweet and very smooth with the scent of citrus (orange peel garnish).",5.0
"Came back here a little over a year later. While the menu is roughly the same, I found the food to be a lot saltier and not as naturally flavorful.

"This is for dinner on a Saturday night in November 2015. Most courses were well composed, but we thought they were not as amazing as they should have been for the price. Here's what we had:Food:-Cauliflower Toast -- good, but not $12 worth -Baked Oysters  -- not very good at all, a special -Hamachi Crudo -- $18 for what should have been a $12-$14 dish -Roasted Carrots side -- excellent (see below)-another side (can't remember the name, and the sides aren't listed online)Cocktails:-Char No. 8-Poppy Gibson (I think)The cocktails were scrumptious. Perhaps I could be convinced to go back just for drinks. The carrots were the winners for us out of all the dishes, although each one was well-balanced. The carrots came with cheese and pine nuts and were perfectly roasted. We agreed that if we went back we might just get some of the veggie sides, which were more appropriately priced for what we got.  In terms of service, it was excellent. The people who were dining before us were lingering for a while (like over 30 minutes past our reservation time), so they gave us complimentary glasses of wine while we waited and were overall very apologetic. But overall, we weren't blown away. We both agreed we wouldn't be likely to go back for dinner.",3.0

"This is for dinner on a Saturday night in November 2015. Most courses were well composed, but we thought they were not as amazing as they should have been for the price. Here's what we had:Food:-Cauliflower Toast -- good, but not $12 worth -Baked Oysters  -- not very good at all, a special -Hamachi Crudo -- $18 for what should have been a $12-$14 dish -Roasted Carrots side -- excellent (see below)-another side (can't remember the name, and the sides aren't listed online)Cocktails:-Char No. 8-Poppy Gibson (I think)The cocktails were scrumptious. Perhaps I could be convinced to go back just for drinks. The carrots were the winners for us out of all the dishes, although each one was well-balanced. The carrots came with cheese and pine nuts and were perfectly roasted. We agreed that if we went back we might just get some of the veggie sides, which were more appropriately priced for what we got.  In terms of service, it was excellent. The people who were dining before us were lingering for a while (like over 30 minutes past our reservation time), so they gave us complimentary glasses of wine while we waited and were overall very apologetic. But overall, we weren't blown away. We both agreed we wouldn't be likely to go back for dinner.",3.0

"I asked for a table by the window when I made the reservation - great tip! We were there for lunch - sunny day, and we had the view of the lake and the buildings south of the restaurant. It was quite noisy. Attentive service; we waited about 30 minutes between first and second courses. Food was beautifully presented. We had the heirloom tomato/ peach salad (simple and tasty). Unfortunately the romaine was a bit salty. For mains we had the salmon (perfectly cooked); the tuna albacore and lobster clubhouse were pretty good. Overall a lovely experience and nice treat.",4.0

"I think I might just find another destination restaurant adding to the ""Brooklyn is the New New York"" list. Restaurant scene wise, of course. It is a cold, snow-stormy night. But a die-hard foodie myself and with the help of Uber, I got across the other side of the bridge with no issue :) On arriving, I noticed Bergen Hill is actually just across street from my another BK fave - Dover. Great, Court / Smith street are now officially a tasty gold mine for me :)Entered the restaurant and greeted immediately by the friendly host. I requested to be seated at the bar in my reservation and they honored my request - extra point! Inside the restaurant it was cozy, dim lit, super chill vibe with open kitchen. Exactly the kind of restaurant I like. Menu was simple yet well defined, categorized as ""seafood"", ""toast"" and ""veggie"". So is the wine list, short yet well curated. I ordered the Char No.8 to start, made of bourbon, zucca, scotch and bitter. It is perfectly smokey and smooth, as suggested by the name. Onto the food. I got the Squid under ""seafood"" and Hen in the Wood under ""veggie"". The veggie arrived first. It is actually mushroom three ways - butter mushroom puree, charred kohlrabi, and house pickled shimeji. Let just say, beyond imagination. After all the me-too veggie dish -  kale, roasted brussel sprouts and cauliflower I have had in the city, this one is truly refreshing. The dish is small but thoughtful and packed with flavor. Then come my main dish, squid. It is actually calamari chopped into tagliatelle shaped and dressed with pomodoro, lardo and gremolata. Fantastic! How often you ever seen calamari in pasta shape? Great knife skill. The pomodoro, oh the pomodoro, not your grama's home-made red sauce. It strikes a perfect balance between sweetness and spiciness, beautifully herb-ed and garlicky; and just right consistency. The squid which is slightly springy, adding interesting texture to the dish than regular tagliatelle would.  in one sentence, it is one great idea and well executed. It's not often seen from a young chef like Andrew D'Ambrosi.

"Stuffed my face last night at Bergen Hill. Could not have been happier. I'm not usually one for raw seafood, but I was sucking it down like it was going out of style.

"My fiancé and I have lived in this neighborhood for over 8 years now and have eaten at dozens of excellent restaurants, with and without hype, with and without Michelin stars. Bergen Hill is hands down our favorite. The menu is mostly seafood, about half raw and half cooked. We generally go for the raw dishes but have eaten nearly everything on the menu at this point and can attest to how carefully and beautifully planned each dish is. The menu is small but so perfectly executed you can't order wrong no matter what you order. That being said, get the Hamachi! That's my favorite and each time we scrape the plate for every last bite (if I were at home I might even lick it!). The fluke crudo, new to the menu, is also a new favorite, similar to ceviche flavors (but again, way better!).We generally get a bottle of Rioja which is a great value wine there but have tried other wines also great and pair well with the food.

During ramp season we were treated to baked oysters with ramp butter and creamed ramps that I wish could be on the menu year round! Bergen Hill is low-key and comfortable, intimate but not stuffy.

"It's our new favorite restaurant in all of NYC.   Here's why:My bf, his sister and I tried Bergen Hill  a few weeks back after I heard a chef friend mention it.  Having never heard of it, I was surprised by the pretty solid feedback online (that rarely happens), and rolling the dice, we decided to make it a birthday dinner spot.Walking in is like walking into a hobbit house.  It's so small! But really cozy, and once you're seated at one of their maybe four actual tables, you start to really like that you are like, five feet from the whole kitchen and bar.  It's also worth noting that the atmosphere feels so homey and quaint.  The service is super friendly and the chefs seem happy and the customers seem to love what they're eating  and, I don't know?  This somehow makes YOU feel happy too.But enough about that, the food:Having three people was perfect because we got to order nine courses and dessert (you don't really NEED nine courses but you'll want them).  We also started off with some of the best cocktails I've ever tasted.  Really, the bartender knew her stuff!Three people with very different tastes all agreed that the mushrooms and hamachi were our favorite, and without spoiling anything, I can seriously say everything was delicious.  The first course, lobster toast, reassured us that we had made a good choice in where to dine that night.  The second course, the mushrooms, had us dancing to black hole sun (for real) and making the line cooks laugh.  The third course, eggs and caviar (oh manzo) had me asking our server for the chefs name... and that's just how the meal progressed.  We were all smiles when we left. I think I was even a bit giddy because I was making heart motions to chef Andrew and thanking all the chefs profusely (so, so not like me).  Such a great dining experience.  We will definitely be bringing ourselves and newbies back!",5.0

"This restaurant came highly recommended by one of our foodie friends as the ""best restaurant in Brooklyn... if not NY"" I wholeheartedly agree... and there are a lot of great spots. The restaurant is small, atmosphere intimate and romantic. The food is out of this world. They offer very innovative dishes that anyone would like. For instance, it converted someone that didn't really like mushrooms or octopus to lick the plate. I would heartily recommend the Hen of the Woods, Hamachi, and Octopus. Fresh, incredible flavor and perfectly cooked. I have never had such tender octopus. All of those dishes blew us away, although they initially didn't pop off the menu. We also tried the Squid and Deviled Egg toast, which were both great and with a very creative spin. If you have room at the end, we split the homemade cream cheese ice cream. This flavor deterred me at first but exceeded expectations and tasted more like salted caramel. Great wine selection and cocktails to compliment the meal. The service was also incredible. It was a somewhat busy night but the server was one of the best we have had- amicable, thoughtful, professional, patient and gave us great recommendations throughout. I would heartily recommend this spot as a must try.",5.0

The chefs prepared a special tasting menu for our group and the variety, quality and timing of all dishes were top notch.  Stand-outs include the lobster toasts, black bass and octopus.  No dishes were disliked.  The wine list is limited but very well selected.  The recommendations were spot on.Thank you for a memorable evening, Bergen Hill!  My guests have been raving about our experience here last night all day long.",5.0
"top notch all around!! came on saturday night on the later side since i knew they were booked until about 10p, walked in and a table was available - score! ordered some delicious glasses of wine while we browsed the menu. the service was outstanding, attentive but not overly and very helpful in providing suggestions for wine and dishes. we ordered the hamachi which was super fresh and buttery, exactly the way it should be. the squid tagliatelle which by far was our favorite, we were amazed by this dish since we've never had squid cut as pasta before. the flavor and texture were harmonious. we also had the special which was a handmade beet ravioli with goat cheese and the lobster salad toast also very tasty. the waiter was great! every time he brought a dish he explained what everything was and how it was prepared which i commend because there's not enough of that type of attention anymore. will definitely come back, the ambiance is quaint, intimate and rustic. a wonderful experience all around. bravo to bergen hill!",5.0
"I had an epic feast here a few weeks ago.  So much food!  So good!     I like that the space is unpretentious.    I almost walked past at first because having read the reviews I imagined like others in this culinary echelon the facade might steampunk me to death but happily it was a peaceful neighborhoody little blonde wooded space where the whole experience was really about the sensual experience of the food and the dynamic with the lovely chef Andrew making it all in plain sight.   i wish i took pictures but I was too busy moaning over the flavors while stuffing my face and bopping to songs that all seemed to have been selected from my fondest highschool mixtapes (90s).  the whole meal was fantastic and really unforced.  THE ORDER:  I loved the Hen of the Woods.  Those mushrooms rocked my world,  I dont have the vocabulary to express what was so right about the harmony of the oil and heat in them but it was special ,    Hamachi was incredible,  I echo other reviewers sentiments about the Octopus.  I too  loved the Cauliflower Toast,  I was really impressed with the squid as a pasta too. and the desert special so yummy.    (Also got the Kale salad!   also so very good.   but confronted with too much awesome food to eat I might skip this to save more room for my hamachi next time).  In the middle of our meal an elderly woman from the neighborhood approached the chef to express her appreciation for the food.  She exclaimed it was the best she ever had.  She had stars in her eyes while she said it.  I felt like I did too. ""Magical"" was a term i heard here more than once as the softspoken chef Andrew lovingly described components of each dish.   Magical is right.  The whole experience was magical.",5.0

But really cozy, and once you're seated at one of their maybe four actual tables, you start to really like that you are like, five feet from the whole kitchen and bar.  It's also worth noting that the atmosphere feels so homey and quaint.  The service is super friendly and the chefs seem happy and the customers seem to love what they're eating  and, I don't know?  This somehow makes YOU feel happy too.But enough about that, the food:Having three people was perfect because we got to order nine courses and dessert (you don't really NEED nine courses but you'll want them).  We also started off with some of the best cocktails I've ever tasted.  Really, the bartender knew her stuff!Three people with very different tastes all agreed that the mushrooms and hamachi were our favorite, and without spoiling anything, I can seriously say everything was delicious.  The first course, lobster toast, reassured us that we had made a good choice in where to dine that night.  The second course, the mushrooms, had us dancing to black hole sun (for real) and making the line cooks laugh.  The third course, eggs and caviar (oh manzo) had me asking our server for the chefs name... and that's just how the meal progressed.  We were all smiles when we left. I think I was even a bit giddy because I was making heart motions to chef Andrew and thanking all the chefs profusely (so, so not like me).  Such a great dining experience.  We will definitely be bringing ourselves and newbies back!",5.0
"This is the place where I really notice the missing 6th star on yelp. Or maybe like 8 out of 10 stars. We neeeeed more stars if we are to review Bergen Hill!Portions are small, place is small....that is the end of my ""nay"" list""YAY"" list: everything elseFrom service to unique presentation and flavor combinations...I was doing my ""this is so delicious"" dance in my seat after every bite - literally. We had the hamachi, black bass, lobster toast, squid, and octopus. I cant pick a favorite - just try them all! Any1 not into seafood should be brought here b/c you will leave a fan! The chef is incredible - especially given that their kitchen is behind the bar. Each dish had combinations I have not experienced before (and that's what it was - an experience- not just dining) - homemade ponzu sauce, riesling marinated octopus....It is the perfect place for dates because of how casual but impressive it is all at once!",5.0
"This restaurant came highly recommended by one of our foodie friends as the ""best restaurant in Brooklyn... if not NY"" I wholeheartedly agree... and there are a lot of great spots. The restaurant is small, atmosphere intimate and romantic. The food is out of this world. They offer very innovative dishes that anyone would like. For instance, it converted someone that didn't really like mushrooms or octopus to lick the plate. I would heartily recommend the Hen of the Woods, Hamachi, and Octopus. Fresh, incredible flavor and perfectly cooked. I have never had such tender octopus. All of those dishes blew us away, although they initially didn't pop off the menu. We also tried the Squid and Deviled Egg toast, which were both great and with a very creative spin. If you have room at the end, we split the homemade cream cheese ice cream. This flavor deterred me at first but exceeded expectations and tasted more like salted caramel. Great wine selection and cocktails to compliment the meal. The service was also incredible. It was a somewhat busy night but the server was one of the best we have had- amicable, thoughtful, professional, patient and gave us great recommendations throughout. I would heartily recommend this spot as a must try.",5.0
"It's been awhile since I've written a review but my experience here last night was so phenomenal I can not miss the opportunity to sing the praises of Bergen Hill.  I hosted a party of eight for a special occaission, including people with dietary restrictions.  Drew helped me hash out the details beforehand and couldn't have made the process easier. The chefs prepared a special tasting menu for our group and the variety, quality and timing of all dishes were top notch.  Stand-outs include the lobster toasts, black bass and octopus.  No dishes were disliked.  The wine list is limited but very well selected.  The recommendations were spot on.Thank you for a memorable evening, Bergen Hill!  My guests have been raving about our experience here last night all day long.",5.0
"top notch all around!! came on saturday night on the later side since i knew they were booked until about 10p, walked in and a table was available - score! ordered some delicious glasses of wine while we browsed the menu. the service was outstanding, attentive but not overly and very helpful in providing suggestions for wine and dishes. we ordered the hamachi which was super fresh and buttery, exactly the way it should be. the squid tagliatelle which by far was our favorite, we were amazed by this dish since we've never had squid cut as pasta before. the flavor and texture were harmonious. we also had the special which was a handmade beet ravioli with goat cheese and the lobster salad toast also very tasty. the waiter was great! every time he brought a dish he explained what everything was and how it was prepared which i commend because there's not enough of that type of attention anymore. will definitely come back, the ambiance is quaint, intimate and rustic. a wonderful experience all around. bravo to bergen hill!",5.0
"I had an epic feast here a few weeks ago.  So much food!  So good!     I like that the space is unpretentious.    I almost walked past at first because having read the reviews I imagined like others in this culinary echelon the facade might steampunk me to death but happily it was a peaceful neighborhoody little blonde wooded space where the whole experience was really about the sensual experience of the food and the dynamic with the lovely chef Andrew making it all in plain sight.   i wish i took pictures but I was too busy moaning over the flavors while stuffing my face and bopping to songs that all seemed to have been selected from my fondest highschool mixtapes (90s).  the whole meal was fantastic and really unforced.  THE ORDER:  I loved the Hen of the Woods.  Those mushrooms rocked my world,  I dont have the vocabulary to express what was so right about the harmony of the oil and heat in them but it was special ,    Hamachi was incredible,  I echo other reviewers sentiments about the Octopus.  I too  loved the Cauliflower Toast,  I was really impressed with the squid as a pasta too. and the desert special so yummy.    (Also got the Kale salad!   also so very good.   but confronted with too much awesome food to eat I might skip this to save more room for my hamachi next time).  In the middle of our meal an elderly woman from the neighborhood approached the chef to express her appreciation for the food.  She exclaimed it was the best she ever had.  She had stars in her eyes while she said it.  I felt like I did too. ""Magical"" was a term i heard here more than once as the softspoken chef Andrew lovingly described components of each dish.   Magical is right.  The whole experience was magical.",5.0
"Just finished having an amazing dinner here. I must admit the menu is a little different. The ingredients they put together ignite a fire of flavors in your mouth. Just close your eyes and try everything. I had the kale salad and the fennel toast. The chef Andrew is amazing. Just watching him cook, you know he loves it. He also explains your meal as if you were a top chef judge, down to spices.  It is a very intimate setting. Perfect for a date night. I was at a meeting, so we sat at the bar. When sitting at the bar, you get to see everyone else's meal being made. It is family styled tapas servings, so they recommend that you share. My dinner mate had the fish which he said was cooked to perfection. They actually season everything, which requires slow eating and savoring. YummThe servers are very attentive and friendly. I like that they explain the menu if it's your first time. They also have outdoor seating .",5.0
"Here's a good name for a restaurant... ""Pretension Hill"". Just a thought.I'm literally agitated as I write this review. I feel like I need to vent or I'll explode (leave that to your imagination). Let me preface by saying I'm not some pretension foodie, who pretends they have a refined pallet, thinks that eating is a hobby, and overpaying for a properly seasoned dish somehow validates my pointless existence. If anything, I'm a real New Yorker, and an ""Eatie"" . I enjoy good food, at a good price. I make a decent living, and could afford to eat at places like this, but I expect exemplary service, food quality, décor, portion size, and unforgettable flavors for this money. I got 1 out of 5 on this meal, so I have that goin' for me, which is nice.Don't get me wrong about Bergen Hill, I got exactly what was to be expected. I was dragged here on a date, who'd been here previously; otherwise I wouldn't be caught dead in a place like this. (She didn't want to go to Hooters;).I really like the neighborhood for its yuppie upscale vibe, but with that comes a price, and well, the pretension. Not that NYC is lacking in that dept.I was a regular at Chance, and Osaka (both about ten blocks away on Smith st, and Court Street, respectively) and was a big fan of their Sushi and Fusion for many years, so I assumed there might be some similarities in BH's menu. As it turns out the price is about double at BH, and the portions about half to a quarter of the size.We were seated immediately, the place was about half full on this chilly winter weeknight. Knowing ahead of time allowed me to pre-plan my meal (thank to Yelpers suggestions), and we ordered pretty much everything that was suggested (the menu is quite small though, so really it doesn't matter).We got the Himachi, the Oysters, the Tuna, and the Squid.""Sadly"" they were out of the eggs and caviar dish (did they run out of eggs??)Also, I was looking forward to getting the Lobster toast, and the Wood Hen Mushrooms, both favorably reviewed, but my date claimed both dishes had no taste (ironically), so we skipped 'em. I wasn't sure what Himachi was, but when the dish was served I recognized it for what it was, plain yellowtail sushi. A quick google search said ""Himachi"" is farm-raised Yellowtail... good to know BH, so much for quality. Real Yellowtail is supposedly wild caught. For 4 small slices and some ""fancy"" (gmo?) Soy Ponzu sauce... $18. Any 50% off Japanese restaurant in Brooklyn will yield you 18 pieces of Yellowtail Sashimi\sushi for the same price. Oh, and an extra buck for spicy mayo... just as good, if not better than this dish.The oysters were very good, but small. 6 oysters for $16. The 3 respective sauces were very tasty too. I could've eaten another 60 oysters though :/Any city happy hour, $1-2 each, just as good.$18. The Tuna portion was equivalent in size to 3 pieces of Tuna sashimi at any Japanese restaurant, but cubed, and mixed with some slivered olives and other nutty paraphernalia. It tasted, well, like Tuna; nothing special in the least, even with all the extra ingredients. I was really craving some soy sauce to smother the dish in, but was too embarrassed to ask for it (you know, cause of how hard the chef worked to create this culinary masterpiece).Any sushi restaurant, 3 pieces of Tuna sashimi 3-9 bucks. Here, $18.  P.S. my date loved the Tuna. Figures.Some Yelpers complained that they didn't see the point of preparing the Squid dish to appear as pasta. The dish was very decent, the sauce good, and there was a bit of crunch to it that was a pleasant texture to me, as if they added ground up tortilla chips into the dish. Perhaps it was whatever ""gremolata"" is? Maybe?? FYI, one pound of spaghetti and sauce at home, $7. Another 50 cents for tortilla chips. Here $18 for three tablespoons worth.2 cocktails we had were just ""meh"". Not worth reviewing. $13 a pop.Oh, the Piece de Resist-mediocre of this meal was finished off with a dollop of pre-melted vanilla ice cream, with a hint of some berry concoction, and something akin to granola. Basically a $1.50 yogurt parfait from McDonalds, but 1/4th the portion. Pretension Hill price, $8Service was very good. But the servers attempt to play up the ""unique"" ingredients was lost on me. Who cares if the dish contains truffle butter and marinated pistachios if it doesn't do anything in the dish, except maybe placebo effect. I love hearing neighboring table hemmin and hawing, ""ooooh, it really has artisanal sundried marinated caraway stalks in it???"" Overall the bill came up to just over a C note, plus tip. UGH!Listen, I understand they have to cover their exorbitant Carrol Gardens yuppie lease, and the prices reflect it, but there is no excuse for these tiny portions and bland flavors. I'm not saying I'm expecting the portions to be family sized like in Carmines (although the prices are about the same), but at least meet us half way.2 Stars, at best.",2.0
"This place gets 10 out of 5 stars from me. It was the perfect experience. From the food, to the drinks, to the staff, absolute perfection. It has an open kitchen, so you can see the chefs preparing the food. And if you're lucky enough, you get to sit right in front of the executive and sous chef. You get to watch them cook and chitchat with them about the food, and life. It's pretty fun. Now for the food, I could find no flaw. From the first to the last course. I love seafood and my boyfriend doesn't eat it. This was part of my Valentines day surprise, and I could not have asked for a more perfect place. Every course was executed, and timed perfectly. How does one make fish taste like pepperoni? They know the secret. And hands down the BEST octopus I've ever had. I wanted to eat ours, our neighbors, and everyone else's portions. And possibly the best compliment, my boyfriend ate and liked it all, and he never eats seafood. The place was packed but felt so intimate as if we were there alone. Anthony the sous chef is phenomenal. He was hilarious and gave us lots of cooking tips. I wish he offered a class, because I'd be the first person to sign up.

"I love the fresh and simple yet perfectly refined menu here! Great ambiance - the inside looked charming too, but we came here on a warm night so decided to sit outside with a bottle of white wine and enjoyed petting our table neighbor's dog next to us. The fancy toast concept is actually really cool - simple ingredients paired together and served on dense, buttery thick toast. We ordered the burrata and tuna tapenade toast, which was delicious! I really appreciated the waitress's helpful advice not to order 2 toasts as it would have been too heavy and you wouldn't be able to finish the rest of your meal. She would have been right - that bread is good, but it'll get you! We had the octopus ""pasta"" which was really just octopus pieces cut into very thin strips that resembled pasta. What a nice take! The simple tomato sauce tied it all together, and you really did get all your money's worth here in octopus! We also shared the kale panzanella, which was a nice take on a classic Tuscan dish. The buttered croutons were made from the same delicious bread as the toast, and the kale was cooked perfectly tender. I'd love to come back here for another delicious meal!",5.0

"Incredible food and awesome staff. Favorite restaurant in Brooklyn, and have tried everything on the menu - nothing I would change about either the space or the food.

The octopus is to die for, and everything on the menu (food and drink) is great. Everyone is very friendly and loves to chat.",5.0
"For our first time here, we went on a Monday in the early evening for a chill evening... it did not disappoint!! (4.5 stars).  We sat outdoors and decided to sample a few things-- the hen of the woods mushroom dish was earthy and amazing (the daikon in it actually complemented the mushrooms very well) and the lobster toast was oh so yummy! Oh and how could we forget the pasta made of calamari with the spicy tomato sauce.... Wow! Very unique, tasty and a great substitute for those avoiding pasta. On a sad note: neither my wife nor I enjoyed the cauliflower toast-- the flavors didn't  mesh well together for us.Also, thanks to Meg our super sweet waitress for bringing us two  glasses of champagne on the house to help celebrate my wife's last day of residency!!

"Really short review: Best meal of any kind I've had in a yearThe rest of the story: There is a certain kind of New York restaurant that when done right is better than any of its ilk in my home of the San Francisco Bay Area. This is a bold statement, I know, especially considering that I dearly love Alembic in the Haight, Penrose in Oakland and many other small plate specialist restaurants. Our chefs are creative, the ingredients are top-notch, sourced locally and cooked and assembled with care. Then we come to NYC (Brooklyn has reached food parity in this category with Manhattan), and positively stumble into the big leagues.The inside was small, intimate, lots of wood and candle-lit. Music was low and not raucous. There were tables available inside and out but at 9:30 pm there was a nice breeze and we opted for al fresco dining on the sidewalk.The inside was small, intimate, lots of wood and candle-lit. Music was low and not raucous. There were tables available inside and out but at 9:30 pm there was a nice breeze and we opted for al fresco dining on the sidewalk.The bartender came outside and asked us what type of water we wanted (tap water in NYC is very good). I looked him straight in the eye and asked if he knew how to make a Vesper. This was a test. His answer was an immediate ""yes"". His bona-fides established, I said, ""do you have Cocchi Americano?"", and he said ""That is how we make the Vesper here."" To myself, ""Time to pay attention here, this joint ain't playin'"". By the way, a Vesper, along with being James Bond's favorite drink, is 1/3 vodka, 2/3 gin with a couple of capfuls of white Lillet (or for those in the know, the Cocchi). I order it when I need a brain cleanser, mood elevator and shock to the system in a glass.We started with New Brunswick oysters that certainly needed no sauce other than the liquor that the sea provides. For those who don't enjoy oysters unadorned, they provided a trio of sides which were so good that while we didn't use them on the outstanding oysters, we kept them in case there was something else to use them on: a cocktail sauce, marinated peppers and a smoky vinaigrette.Next was the Hamachi. This was my favorite sashimi, reimagined by a master. I do love sashimi and eat it perhaps three times a week, so it was another test of their chef. The Japanese have a method of layering flavors that doesn't take away any of the flavor of the main ingredient, which this chef did. The fish was served raw, on a bed of an avocado puree, topped with a light chili powder, marinated onions and a type of radish that was a perfect accompaniment. My wife and I fist-bumped at this point. We knew we were in for a gastronomic home-run.The waiter removed the immaculately clean Hamachi plate and put down the 'Kale Caesar'. It was explained that the chef marinates the kale instead of blanching it to remove the bitterness without losing its ""kale-ness"". Added to that: a soft-boiled quail egg, some Parmesan, avocado and croutons. Again, the chef had recreated a well-known dish brilliantly. Each bite combined the flavors while not losing the fact that kale was the star. Kale-haters beware, this might change your mind about it.OK, the warm-ups were over, next came the best dish I've had in a very long time, the ""Squid"". What arrived looked like a plate of tagliatelle with a rich red fishy-sauce. I've ordered it before, hell, I've made it before. But wait up, there was something different here. The tagliatelle wasn't made from dough, it was made from the calamari itself! The chef painstakingly sliced up the calamari in ribbons and served it covered with an extremely rich and intense pomodoro/marinara sauce. The ocean was in every bite, carried by olive oil, garlic and tomatoes.At this point, we are ecstatically sated, listening to a pleasantly incomprehensible stream of French from a party a couple of tables down and trying to figure out a way to extend the experience. When the waiter came out we asked him what he had for desert (there wasn't anything on the menu). He said, ""Well, we do have a couple of ice creams. A salted apple/caramel and a kaffir mint."" ""Bring both."" We said. ""Oh, by the way, the mint tastes exactly like Froot Loops-infused milk; astoundingly so."" he said. He was spot on. Kaffir limes are tasty, but a tad bitter and the bitterness is there, but other than that, Froot Loop City. The caramel/apple was also perfectly balanced.Finally, price... You can't get out of a Manhattan restaurant of this caliber for less than $150 and $200 is more common. Our bill before tip was $119. I don't know if that's an effect of being in Brooklyn or what, but it was a welcome surprise.Final tally:Food: 10 (First time I've given that score) Service: 9 (nearly perfect - personable and professional) Price: 4 (I would have happily paid 1.5X for that experience) Ambiance: 8 (tree-lined quiet Brooklyn street, Summer breeze, soft music)",5.0
"Really good! We stopped by on a Wednesday night because we saw they had $1 oysters at the bar. $1 oysters win for me any night of the week :) The bartender was great. Really attentive, offered suggestions. We had oysters (delish and fresh), the cauliflower toast (really good! definitely try), the egg and caviar toast....this one I did not love but I think it was just my personal opinion. I am not a huge caviar fan and the fishiness of it ruined the taste for me. If you like caviar, you will probably love it! And then the grand finale...the Hamachi...holy crap this was good! I am going back for that alone. Fresh raw hamachi with an avocado sauce...DO IT.I really enjoyed the ambiance, and the food. I am only giving it 4 stars because the prices are a bit high for what you get. Especially the drinks. My boyfriend got a draft beer, it came in a highball glass and it was $10. For draft! Also, I think $13 is a lot for all of the specialty cocktails since the pour was not exactly heavy.",4.0
"What a great spot.  I'd give this 5 stars, but I'm trying not to be a star whore.By way of bias disclosure, this is just the kind of place that I like.  Relaxed, casual, yet passionate.  Everyone was passionate, passion about the food, passion about the drinks.  Passion right down to the tunes they played.I ate at the bar and was greeting by an extremely professional and extremely friendly bartender.  She knew her drinks and she knew the menu very well.  She also had plenty of good food/wine matching tips.  Not to mention just being really nice generally.I started with the hen of the woods with a mushroom puree, kohlrabi and pickled hon shimeji.  I thought the idea of this dish was really genious, particularly combining mushrooms with a mushroom puree.  I've already copied the idea in my home kitchen - imitation being the highest form of flatery, need I say more.  The textures and flavors worked really well together.Then I had the octopus with onion puree, faro and broccoli.  It was perfectly balanced, particularly that little touch of heat from the harissa.  The octopus was tender, although I prefer it when it has slightly charred crust.I would definitely go back here.  Great atmosphere and food.",4.0
"Wow! Simply amazing food here. Every dish was tasteful. The plates are small to share dishes. We were 2 people and we ordered 5 dishes plus desserts. Every dish is perfect here. I can't wait to come back and try out some of their other plates. The servers are friendly, sweet, and best of all help you with choosing the dishes that would fit your style. Make sure to order the tuna it's a very tasteful tartar dish. The cauliflower dish was excellent as well. Check this place out you won't regret it.",5.0

"Small & intimate spot, i.e., leave your bags at home.  Watching the chefs cook is a study in space management. Reservations are fairly easy to make. But I also like Sunday dinners, reservation sleeper days. The food was delicious.  We had the octopus, cauliflower toast, salmon, and the scallops. I want to bring more people to this place but given the size, it'll be a party of 2.",4.0
"I love the fresh and simple yet perfectly refined menu here! Great ambiance - the inside looked charming too, but we came here on a warm night so decided to sit outside with a bottle of white wine and enjoyed petting our table neighbor's dog next to us. The fancy toast concept is actually really cool - simple ingredients paired together and served on dense, buttery thick toast. We ordered the burrata and tuna tapenade toast, which was delicious! I really appreciated the waitress's helpful advice not to order 2 toasts as it would have been too heavy and you wouldn't be able to finish the rest of your meal. She would have been right - that bread is good, but it'll get you! We had the octopus ""pasta"" which was really just octopus pieces cut into very thin strips that resembled pasta. What a nice take! The simple tomato sauce tied it all together, and you really did get all your money's worth here in octopus! We also shared the kale panzanella, which was a nice take on a classic Tuscan dish. The buttered croutons were made from the same delicious bread as the toast, and the kale was cooked perfectly tender. I'd love to come back here for another delicious meal!",5.0
"I've been to Bergen Hill now about 5 times, each time has been excellent! The service is great and the food is amazing. The place is small so best to reserve. I've tried almost everything on the menu and am never disappointed. The Langoustine and the Hamachi are my favorite. Once they had baked oysters with a ramp butter and I've never tasted an oyster so good in my life! The ice creams are also delicious, and the flavors change every time I'm there. Love this place!",5.0
"Incredible food and awesome staff. Favorite restaurant in Brooklyn, and have tried everything on the menu - nothing I would change about either the space or the food. Try to sit at the chef's table when possible: it's so fun to watch the chef prepare all the dishes, and the chef will almost always provide you with tastes if you're nice and strike up conversation. The octopus is to die for, and everything on the menu (food and drink) is great. Everyone is very friendly and loves to chat.",5.0
"For our first time here, we went on a Monday in the early evening for a chill evening... it did not disappoint!! (4.5 stars).  We sat outdoors and decided to sample a few things-- the hen of the woods mushroom dish was earthy and amazing (the daikon in it actually complemented the mushrooms very well) and the lobster toast was oh so yummy! Oh and how could we forget the pasta made of calamari with the spicy tomato sauce.... Wow! Very unique, tasty and a great substitute for those avoiding pasta. On a sad note: neither my wife nor I enjoyed the cauliflower toast-- the flavors didn't  mesh well together for us.Also, thanks to Meg our super sweet waitress for bringing us two  glasses of champagne on the house to help celebrate my wife's last day of residency!! Just a perfect ending to a great meal :)",4.0
"Really short review: Best meal of any kind I've had in a yearThe rest of the story: There is a certain kind of New York restaurant that when done right is better than any of its ilk in my home of the San Francisco Bay Area. This is a bold statement, I know, especially considering that I dearly love Alembic in the Haight, Penrose in Oakland and many other small plate specialist restaurants. Our chefs are creative, the ingredients are top-notch, sourced locally and cooked and assembled with care. Then we come to NYC (Brooklyn has reached food parity in this category with Manhattan), and positively stumble into the big leagues.The inside was small, intimate, lots of wood and candle-lit. Music was low and not raucous. There were tables available inside and out but at 9:30 pm there was a nice breeze and we opted for al fresco dining on the sidewalk.The inside was small, intimate, lots of wood and candle-lit.

"KenScale: 9.0/10Ever since I visited Battersby, I have been enamored with visiting tiny neighborhood restaurants in NYC (whether in Manhattan or Brooklyn) that nevertheless offers high level of culinary sophistication. Bergen Hill fits that profile just about perfectly. It is a tiny restaurant in Carroll Gardens that looks more like a bar than a restaurant suitable for drinks with some small bites than serious dinner meal. Don't let the restaurant's decor or the relatively short menu fool you. I boldly declare that I've had the best seafood at Bergen Hill since my visit to Le Bernardin last summer. The restaurant is helmed by Andrew D'Ambrosi (a Top Chef alum who also happened to be on the same season with Stephanie Izard from the Girl and the Goat in Chicago that I absolutely loved). There are no meats, only seafood dishes and some vegetable options. My dinner on Sunday night went on a great start with the tasty cauliflower toast with raisin, pine nut, caper and grape. Really loved the texture of different elements on the toast. Then came more vegetable dishes. Barley risotto tastes creamy yet I was surprised with how light and delightful the dish was. Hen of the woods (mushroom) was also outstanding, with great texture. Afterwards, three outstanding seafood dishes came along. Scallop with winter squash was exquisite, with perfectly cooked scallop working so harmoniously with winter squash to create awesome flavor. Squid in the form of ""calamari tagliatelle"" with pomodoro really looks like a pasta and even tastes like one, but there is no pasta noodle at all. I was absolutely blown away by how the restaurant was able to manipulate the texture of squid like this. Octopus was also outstanding. Great texture, and again the flavor of surrounding ingredients like farro and raisin displayed that restraint that further enhanced rather than undermined the taste of octopus. I really loved the fact that each seafood was accompanied by healthy vegetable pieces while at the same time maintaining great (but not over-the-top) flavor. Even the only dessert offered by the restaurant was a winner, a delightful buttermilk vanilla ice cream on top of a pistachio crumble, accompanied by chocolate ganache and yuzu gelee. I think I remember some critics complaining that the portion of each dish was a bit on the small side, but I beg to disagree. I ordered six total dishes for a party of two before dessert, and was absolutely stuffed.     I made a reservation about a week in advance for a Sunday dinner, and didn't have much problem. I was seated at the bar when I arrived, and was really glad I ended up sitting right in front of chef D'Ambrosi, who was very friendly and openly shared his culinary vision, future goals, experience at the Top Chef, etc. The restaurant has a full bar with some serious cocktail offerings (I liked both of the cocktails that I tried: rum-based Set Sail and bourbon-based Char No. 8). My trip to Carroll Gardens all the way from Manhattan was absolutely worth it. and I hope to come back here again soon. Definitely one of the highlights of my restaurant experience this year!",5.0
"Short overview: citrus happy; complex/""interesting"" combination of flavors; novel treatment of seafood; gimmicky. Maybe I am conservative or unimaginative, but when it comes to seafood, I tend to prefer that the seafood be the star. Bergen Hill is not that. I don't know the story but based on my dinner here, it feels like their modus operandi seem to be ""redoing seafood"" rather than focus on seafood. It feels like seafood for people who don't actually like seafood? You know? It's like, yes, frappucino is a coffee drink, but do you order frappucinos because you like coffee or because you like milk shakes?Seafoods generally have rather delicate flavors, so for me, the best preparations bring out the flavor of the creature itself. Here, the seafood is just an element of the dish. We hit a good note to start: the lobster toast was delicious. The salad was very flavorful - like the notes kept coming, one new flavor with each chew. Plus, they added chunks of tail meat on top, which gave you a good taste of the lobster. The toast was probably pan toasted and heavily lathered in butter - like the prototype of toasts. I can eat that toast with anything or nothing. The next course was hamachi, which was served with avocado puree, pickled radish, ponzu sauce, etc. For the first bite, I didn't mess around with any of the trimmings and had a piece of the hamachi with just a bit of the ponzu. The hamachi was DELICIOUS, so much of the fish flavor was present. The cut of the fish had the perfect amount of heft and chew. Then I had it with a bit of everything on the plate and it wasn't a cacophony exactly, but it's just way too much of a distraction. The avocado puree, especially, added nothing to my experience. Our last plate was the squid tagliatelle, this was easily the dish I liked the least. The ""tagliatalle"" was actually squid cut up like pasta. I guess that's an interesting idea, but I didn't get it. Squid, as a pasta, doesn't really work  in terms of a texture or a vessel for sauce, which was actually decent. Flavor wise, I didn't really get much squid either. Whatever processing was done to tenderize or detexturize the squid enough to approximate al dente pasta took out any flavor from the squid. So, then squid was just pointless.Good cocktails though - would come back for that and toast.",3.0
"GO HERE. We had dinner here for our first wedding anniversary and it is easily one of my favorite restaurants in NYC. The atmosphere is cozy and intimate and the chef and our server were so warm and accommodating.  Our server even gave us a heads-up that we might be ordering too much which is always appreciated. We got to sit right in front of the head chef and it was incredible to watch him prepare everything and talk to him about how he creates the dishes. The cocktails are outstanding and our server was exceptionally helpful with recommending drinks we would enjoy. Now onto the food! We had the hamachi, the octopus, the cauliflower toast, and the hen of the woods. Everything was delicious but the octopus and hen of the woods were incredible. I'm super picky about octopus and this was the best I've ever had-it had such a rich flavor it almost tasted like steak! The hen of the woods is a must if you like mushrooms. We finished with the cinnamon rolls which were out of this world. I am really into dessert and this is one of the best I've ever had. A couple of things that didn't bother me but may be worth noting for some people-it is a small space so the seating is tight. If you are someone who hates NY restaurants where you may have to squeeze a bit to sit down this could be a drawback. The music is not your typical restaurant soundtrack-the night we went it was mostly alt. rock and and rock from the 80s or 90s. We didn't find it intrusive but it wasn't what we were expecting.",5.0

"It's defined as a seafood restaurant. Similar to tapas, this restaurant feeds 3-4 dishes for two people. We stumbled into Bergen Hill at about 7:15pm on a Thursday. There were barely any people, maybe since it had just down poured. The hostess brought us to the bar right in front of the kitchen, a fantastic choice. The menus are on small clipboards, a unique intimate vibe, especially when paired with the environment. It had fun music and an ambient lighting arrangement. In my appreciation for culinary surprises, I asked Chef Andrew D'Ambrosi to surprise my girlfriend and I with 4 dishes. He smiled and agreed. As he cooked, he explained his process of each dish. He even explained his inspiration for each dish. We were surprised with one dish after the other: hen of the woods, hamachi, squid, and octopus. We originally ordered three dishes, and Chef D'Ambrosi asked if we rather had squid or octopus for our last dish. Previous yelp reviews mentioned we MUST have the octopus, so we went with both.I could not recommend this restaurant more; from its delicious original food, to its gracious hospitality, or maybe it's the romantic, intimate environment.

The toast was probably pan toasted and heavily lathered in butter - like the prototype of toasts. I can eat that toast with anything or nothing. The next course was hamachi, which was served with avocado puree, pickled radish, ponzu sauce, etc. For the first bite, I didn't mess around with any of the trimmings and had a piece of the hamachi with just a bit of the ponzu. The hamachi was DELICIOUS, so much of the fish flavor was present. The cut of the fish had the perfect amount of heft and chew. Then I had it with a bit of everything on the plate and it wasn't a cacophony exactly, but it's just way too much of a distraction. The avocado puree, especially, added nothing to my experience. Our last plate was the squid tagliatelle, this was easily the dish I liked the least. The ""tagliatalle"" was actually squid cut up like pasta. I guess that's an interesting idea, but I didn't get it. Squid, as a pasta, doesn't really work  in terms of a texture or a vessel for sauce, which was actually decent. Flavor wise, I didn't really get much squid either. Whatever processing was done to tenderize or detexturize the squid enough to approximate al dente pasta took out any flavor from the squid. So, then squid was just pointless.Good cocktails though - would come back for that and toast.",3.0
"GO HERE. We had dinner here for our first wedding anniversary and it is easily one of my favorite restaurants in NYC. The atmosphere is cozy and intimate and the chef and our server were so warm and accommodating.  Our server even gave us a heads-up that we might be ordering too much which is always appreciated. We got to sit right in front of the head chef and it was incredible to watch him prepare everything and talk to him about how he creates the dishes. The cocktails are outstanding and our server was exceptionally helpful with recommending drinks we would enjoy. Now onto the food! We had the hamachi, the octopus, the cauliflower toast, and the hen of the woods. Everything was delicious but the octopus and hen of the woods were incredible. I'm super picky about octopus and this was the best I've ever had-it had such a rich flavor it almost tasted like steak! The hen of the woods is a must if you like mushrooms. We finished with the cinnamon rolls which were out of this world. I am really into dessert and this is one of the best I've ever had. A couple of things that didn't bother me but may be worth noting for some people-it is a small space so the seating is tight. If you are someone who hates NY restaurants where you may have to squeeze a bit to sit down this could be a drawback. The music is not your typical restaurant soundtrack-the night we went it was mostly alt. rock and and rock from the 80s or 90s. We didn't find it intrusive but it wasn't what we were expecting.",5.0
"Let's relax everyone. Here's what's up...The food is good. Very good. Inventive combinations, and a lot of them are well executed. They definitely know how to prepare seafood  Nice, casual atmosphere: I like how the kitchen is exposed. The negatives- some dishes were too busy and flavors were lost. Main complaint is the portion size for the price. Like i went for pizza after. But I'll probably go back for a drink and a couple of tasty snacks.",3.0
"This place is as good as it gets.  Great food, great drinks, friendly staff.  I routinely bring people here for a great experience.",5.0
"Definitely some of the best food I have ever eaten. I've done a lot of fine dining in my lifetime and this place is at the top. Such impeccable use of flavors. The menu is small and the dishes aren't over complex and are truly something wonderful. The service was great. Our waitress explained the menu, and was very attentive throughout our entire dinner. I recommend the lobster toast, Hen of the Woods mushrooms, oysters, and squid ""pasta"". We also had the special of the day which was their potato leek soup with lobster and bacon. It was delicious. For desert, they had one option and it was an amazing one at that. An almond cake with strawberry ice cream and lemon. I will be returning. Bravo.",5.0
You know why this place is five stars? Because it has the best bartender in all of New York. He really knows how to make a drink & give great customer service. I really felt a part of the Bergen Hill family.,5.0
"This was a great way to close out my time and food experiences within Brooklyn.  The service was also great and I ended up having a great conversation with the bartender that just added to the experience.I started off the meal with the hamachi which was absolutely delicious.  I then followed that up with the octopus.  Being the third time I'd had octopus in a week, I think this was the best one I had.  The last dish was the best one.  The calamari tagliatelle was inventive and delicious.  It's pairing with the pomodoro sauce made for a wonderful experience.I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone near Cobble Hill.",4.0
"It's defined as a seafood restaurant. Similar to tapas, this restaurant feeds 3-4 dishes for two people. We stumbled into Bergen Hill at about 7:15pm on a Thursday. There were barely any people, maybe since it had just down poured. The hostess brought us to the bar right in front of the kitchen, a fantastic choice. The menus are on small clipboards, a unique intimate vibe, especially when paired with the environment. It had fun music and an ambient lighting arrangement. In my appreciation for culinary surprises, I asked Chef Andrew D'Ambrosi to surprise my girlfriend and I with 4 dishes. He smiled and agreed. As he cooked, he explained his process of each dish. He even explained his inspiration for each dish. We were surprised with one dish after the other: hen of the woods, hamachi, squid, and octopus. We originally ordered three dishes, and Chef D'Ambrosi asked if we rather had squid or octopus for our last dish. Previous yelp reviews mentioned we MUST have the octopus, so we went with both.I could not recommend this restaurant more; from its delicious original food, to its gracious hospitality, or maybe it's the romantic, intimate environment. I loved every aspect of this place and cannot wait to return to try everything else.",5.0
"I meant to write a review of this place after I came for my birthday dinner in October. My boyfriend and I liked it so much that we came back for our anniversary yesterday! I was afraid that my expectations were set so high after a special night that it wouldn't live up but YO. This place is amazing.Both times we sat at the chef's table - one experience was super chatty and the other was more subdued but it was still great either way to be so close to the action. I'm aspiring to mere competence in the kitchen but these guys really know their way around.The cocktails were inventive and delicious. I have no idea what I was ordering most of the time but it was all flavorful and unique. The Set Sail in particular is perfect for this time of year - it was on the spectrum of Manhattans but more complex and a little sweeter.The first time we ordered cauliflower and lobster toasts, hen of the woods, hamachi, and swordfish. It was too much food for two people but we rallied and pushed through because food. The restaurant knew it was my birthday and brought out a complimentary dessert which was very thoughtful.The second time we tried to be strategic about it and ordered the lobster toast and hen of the woods again as well as the tuna and squid.I should say that although the cauliflower toast was not my favorite, it was still really good and all of this food is superlatively delicious. I want to come here all the damn time.",5.0
"My wife and I went to eat here based on yelp reviews, and we are so glad we did. We didn't have a bad bite to eat. We had the black bass, hamachi, eggs & caviar, hens of the forest (mushrooms), and swordfish. I won't describe the dishes, as other reviewers have done that very well (Katya D.)Everything was amazing, food-wise, as well as the service.We sat at the bar, and Andy (head chef) was great at explaining what we were eating and how he came up with the dish. He was really friendly, humble, and made the experience that much better. When he found out we were there to celebrate an anniversary, he even whipped up a dessert for us, on the house. It is great when you are able to find these hidden gems, where you go in not knowing what to expect, but then getting blown away when you do. One of the more memorable meals I have had, and I have been to several of the great restaurants in the city, so that is saying something. Most importantly, my wife also had a great time. We are definitely coming back to sample some more of the menu. You will not be disappointed.",5.0

"I don't even want to write this review, because words don't do this food justice. But I will, because the world needs to know about Bergen Hill.I went here with my boyfriend for my birthday. I love to cook and love to eat, and spend a lot of time reading about food, so when I read the reviews of Bergen Hill (named for the actual hill that slopes up Carroll Gardens), I was palpitating with excitement.We arrived and sat at the ""chef's table,"" i.e. a few inches away from the micro kitchen that Chef Andrew uses to churn out his heavenly bites. Choosing was difficult; the menu is on the pricey side and we are not very rich, so we wanted to make the most of our plates. We ended up ordering four dishes:1. Lobster toasts: Lobster rolls are arguably my boyfriend's favorite food, and I'm from Boston, so we absolutely had to try this. It takes lobster to another dimension - it was creamy and fresh, and the richness was cut with thin slices of hearts of palm. The lobster is brought in from Maine, and its freshness is palpable.2. Hen of the woods: This is essentially a deconstructed mushroom salad, and since mushrooms are my favorite fungus, we had to order it. Seared hen of the woods mushrooms sit atop the most luscious mushroom purée, dotted with tiny white mushrooms whose name I unfortunately don't remember. There was umami up the wazoo and I was licking the purée off the plate.3. Hamachi: Beautiful slices of raw hamachi were topped with a magical ponzu sauce and paired with radishes and avocado cream. Simple and stunning, it the sweetest, creamiest hamachi I've ever had.4. Calamari ""pasta"": In this dish, the calamari stands in for the pasta, so you have smooth, tender strings of calamari in a lick-the-bowl delicious pomodoro sauce. Simple, generous, unbelievable.5. Pistachio roll with butter and brown sugar ice cream - They surprised me at the end of the meal with a rousing rendition of happy birthday and dessert on the house. I am normally not a huge fan of pistachio-flavored desserts, as they are usually just green colored and don't actually taste like pistachio. This roll, described as a cinnamon roll but with pistachios instead of cinnamon, was unbelievable. There were pistachios tucked in everywhere, and it had the most tender crumb. The ice cream was stunning (seriously, if they opened an ice cream shop I'd be there every day), and the whole thing was topped with fresh wild strawberries.Throughout the meal we got to chat with Chef Andrew and Chef Tony, both funny, kind, humble people who turn food into art. This was both one of the most delicious and one of the most enjoyable meals I've ever had, and I'll be back as soon as possible.",5.0

"This is how good Bergen Hill is: the night before eating here my boyfriend and I dined at an NYC dining mecca: Per Se. But the meal we talked about most during and after the trip? The one we had at Bergen Hill.I don't want to set expectations too high, because this is a totally different type of experience, but if I had the opportunity to eat at one or the other again, free of charge? I'd chose Bergen Hill.We arrived in Carroll Gardens having a couple of pre-selected options in mind. We walked by Bergen Hill first and were immediately charmed, but we checked out the other places before making any final decisions. We went with initial impressions and trotted back to BH asap. We opted to sit at the bar overlooking the very teeny tiny kitchen, which ended up being awesome- we chatted with the chef and his staff for a good portion of our meal (he's funny and had great advice as to other places we should check out while we were in NYC). We were dining pretty early in the evening, so we were one of three occupied tables, which probably accounted for the extra attention.I started out with the Poppy Gibson cocktail. So, so good. They topped it off with perfect little slivers of pickled onion, which, to some, might sound odd, but it added the perfect amount of piquant. (Boyfriend had something equally nice, but I cannot remember now what it was).The food. It's all small plates, meant for sharing. You know. What all the cool kids are doing these days. It was hard to not order every thing on the menu because it all sounded so good. But here's what we ended up with:- Hen of the woods mushrooms - umami deliciousness on a plate, with the cutest mini pickled mushrooms you'll ever see.- Fennel ganoush toast - they took the worst part about baba ganoush- the eggplant- and turned it into something I would want to eat every. single. day. Not joking. I turned to my boyfriend and said, ""I have to figure out how to duplicate this because I want to eat it for lunch all the time."" When we had finished almost all our courses and decided we wanted to add another we nearly ordered this again. But didn't. Cause new things.- Black bass - wherein I learned that I might not hate radishes. So clean. Not overdone. Perfectly married flavors.- Hamachi - our add-on course. So glad we got this. It was just beautifully done and deserves the praises others have previously sung. - Octopus - so, so tender. And it had raisins. And I loved it. My hatred of raisins is well known. And now I have to rethink this entire raisin hate thing. But seriously, octopus is so often hit or miss (usually a tough, chewy, miss) but this was fucking velvety. Overall, top to bottom, one of the best dining experiences in recent memory, if not all my memory. Post Script: And thank freakin' god for a newish, awesome restaurant that doesn't seem to have the same damn menu as every other restaurant on the block. You know what I'm talking about- the inevitable charcuterie-esque apps, a fancy roast chicken, lots of meats. a fancy burger... that whole gastro-pubby type/new american thing. Which, yes, I love too, but dear lord it's old. The respect and homage to fish and seafood here is amazing and should be noted.",5.0

"I reserve my reviews for places I think are truly noteworthy, and this place is definitely the sardine's whiskers.The staff was attentive, knowledgeable, upbeat and extremely friendly. It's obvious that they enjoy working there. The space uses a lighter wood tone which offsets the low lights so the ambience was warm and cozy but without being too dark (at least at night). The layout for the space was efficient and well planned, and was just that right size where its not too big or too small. As for the food...I ordered three dishes. The Cauliflower Toast (with Raisin, pine nut, caper, and grape), the Tuna (with green olive, currant, jalepeno, and almond), and initially I order the Sardine (with eggplant caponata, pickled carrot, basil, pine nut) but alas it was out for the day. (I'll just have to come back and order it again soon!) The bartender suggested the Squid (with pomodoro, lardo and gremolata) which she said was the favorite of the matrie'd. She also suggested a wonderful rosé that ended up being the perfect accompaniment for the food. Looking over the drinks/wine menu it appeared that they took great care in choosing items that would nicely compliment and not be too overbearing for the food. All three of my dishes were spot on. One of the things that drew me into this place was the menu has some not so obvious flavor combinations. Not knowing exactly what to expect was a bit of the fun and then it all ended up being quite pleasurable which of course made me even more satisfied. If the chef was searching for balance, I would say that from my experience saw it pervade the entire establishment. I was also lucky enough to try a fourth dish. I struck up a conversation with a regular who not only introduced me to the chefs, but also shared a bit of his Hamachi (white soy ponzu, onion, jalepeno, togarashi). I was really thrilled by the dish. I expected a bit of a lift from the ponzu but the tang of the dish was really forward in a good way and really highlighted the fish. I can't wait to order it next time.I also took note that the staff was paying attention to the pace at which I ate and expedited to me perfectly. The portions were in that perfect sweet spot for the cost.  To be completely honest for the quality of product you are getting, this place it is a steal.

The one we had at Bergen Hill.I don't want to set expectations too high, because this is a totally different type of experience, but if I had the opportunity to eat at one or the other again, free of charge? I'd chose Bergen Hill.We arrived in Carroll Gardens having a couple of pre-selected options in mind. We walked by Bergen Hill first and were immediately charmed, but we checked out the other places before making any final decisions. We went with initial impressions and trotted back to BH asap. We opted to sit at the bar overlooking the very teeny tiny kitchen, which ended up being awesome- we chatted with the chef and his staff for a good portion of our meal (he's funny and had great advice as to other places we should check out while we were in NYC). We were dining pretty early in the evening, so we were one of three occupied tables, which probably accounted for the extra attention.I started out with the Poppy Gibson cocktail. So, so good. They topped it off with perfect little slivers of pickled onion, which, to some, might sound odd, but it added the perfect amount of piquant. (Boyfriend had something equally nice, but I cannot remember now what it was).The food. It's all small plates, meant for sharing. You know. What all the cool kids are doing these days. It was hard to not order every thing on the menu because it all sounded so good. But here's what we ended up with:- Hen of the woods mushrooms - umami deliciousness on a plate, with the cutest mini pickled mushrooms you'll ever see.- Fennel ganoush toast - they took the worst part about baba ganoush- the eggplant- and turned it into something I would want to eat every. single. day. Not joking. I turned to my boyfriend and said, ""I have to figure out how to duplicate this because I want to eat it for lunch all the time."" When we had finished almost all our courses and decided we wanted to add another we nearly ordered this again. But didn't. Cause new things.- Black bass - wherein I learned that I might not hate radishes. So clean. Not overdone. Perfectly married flavors.- Hamachi - our add-on course. So glad we got this. It was just beautifully done and deserves the praises others have previously sung. - Octopus - so, so tender. And it had raisins. And I loved it. My hatred of raisins is well known. And now I have to rethink this entire raisin hate thing. But seriously, octopus is so often hit or miss (usually a tough, chewy, miss) but this was fucking velvety. Overall, top to bottom, one of the best dining experiences in recent memory, if not all my memory. Post Script: And thank freakin' god for a newish, awesome restaurant that doesn't seem to have the same damn menu as every other restaurant on the block. You know what I'm talking about- the inevitable charcuterie-esque apps, a fancy roast chicken, lots of meats. a fancy burger... that whole gastro-pubby type/new american thing. Which, yes, I love too, but dear lord it's old. The respect and homage to fish and seafood here is amazing and should be noted.",5.0
Surprisingly good food. Small comfy space. Really enjoyed our evening. Would certainly return and recommend to a friend.,5.0
"I visit this restaurant by using yelp, it listed with 4 or 4.5 stars in most of the review. At some point, I have a little bit disappointed on certain dishes which I really expect a bit more.However this restaurant is nice and clean, out door sits are also available, very simply but nice looking restaurant. (at least I think it is). I just like the environment. Although the food is pricy and small, I will still give a 4 stars rating since the services from the waitress/waiter, they are extremely nice and professional. The octopus is really salty and that's why 1 star is gone from my review.Hope this help.",4.0
"This place just opened up next to my office, so I figured I would give them a try. From service, to presentation, to quality of food, this place is top notch!Had an amazing experience and will definitely be back with friends in tow.",5.0
"Fresh, inventive, beautifully plated food that is orchestrated by an excellent waitstaff. Our waiter very patiently let us sample four types of wine before we settled on a bottle we loved--granted, it was a bit slow on a Tuesday night.",4.0
"I reserve my reviews for places I think are truly noteworthy, and this place is definitely the sardine's whiskers.The staff was attentive, knowledgeable, upbeat and extremely friendly. It's obvious that they enjoy working there. The space uses a lighter wood tone which offsets the low lights so the ambience was warm and cozy but without being too dark (at least at night). The layout for the space was efficient and well planned, and was just that right size where its not too big or too small. As for the food...I ordered three dishes. The Cauliflower Toast (with Raisin, pine nut, caper, and grape), the Tuna (with green olive, currant, jalepeno, and almond), and initially I order the Sardine (with eggplant caponata, pickled carrot, basil, pine nut) but alas it was out for the day. (I'll just have to come back and order it again soon!) The bartender suggested the Squid (with pomodoro, lardo and gremolata) which she said was the favorite of the matrie'd. She also suggested a wonderful rosé that ended up being the perfect accompaniment for the food. Looking over the drinks/wine menu it appeared that they took great care in choosing items that would nicely compliment and not be too overbearing for the food. All three of my dishes were spot on. One of the things that drew me into this place was the menu has some not so obvious flavor combinations. Not knowing exactly what to expect was a bit of the fun and then it all ended up being quite pleasurable which of course made me even more satisfied. If the chef was searching for balance, I would say that from my experience saw it pervade the entire establishment. I was also lucky enough to try a fourth dish. I struck up a conversation with a regular who not only introduced me to the chefs, but also shared a bit of his Hamachi (white soy ponzu, onion, jalepeno, togarashi). I was really thrilled by the dish. I expected a bit of a lift from the ponzu but the tang of the dish was really forward in a good way and really highlighted the fish. I can't wait to order it next time.I also took note that the staff was paying attention to the pace at which I ate and expedited to me perfectly. The portions were in that perfect sweet spot for the cost.  To be completely honest for the quality of product you are getting, this place it is a steal. (but shhhhh lets keep that a secret!)If I lived in the neighborhood I would most certainly be a regular.",5.0
"Just a really wonderful place- perfect for date nights. Their cocktails are fantastic and all the food we have had there is amazing. Favorites from our last visit were the hamachi and the lobster toast. Reservations definitely recommended, the seating is pretty limited.",5.0
"I loved my solo dinner at Bergen Hill. I sat at the bar and enjoyed excellent service and delicious food. The bartender recommended three dishes, since they are small portions; I probably could have ordered only two, as I was unable to finish all three. The hamachi dish was the highlight by far, and I highly recommend you order it. The restaurant is cozy, which means it might not be great for a large group but it is great for assuring contact with the chef and other kitchen staff, if you like seeing into the process a bit more. Amazing what they churn out from the tiny kitchen at Bergen Hill.",4.0
"went for drinks and dessert and the place did not disappoint.  the menu itself has freshly prepared seafood bites.  (think crab toast and delicately sliced raw fish).  drinks and dessert were spot on...and the service was lovely.  It's definitely a cozy environment, one where we can't wait to go back to!",5.0
"I wouldn't go back. It was my first time and I traveled all the way from Connecticut to meet some friends who live in Brooklyn. I've read so many good things about them but they were very disappointing. When you end up paying $100 for dinner and you leave the restaurant hungry you know that they forgot the reason they are in business - to feed people. Small portions - too small - expensive, cramped, noisy, your clothes smell like food after. To top this off... We've been told we have to leave at a certain time because another party was coming in. I wouldn't go back. This place wasn't worth it.  Service was so and so...",1.0
"I tried to avoid writing a review to keep this place to myself, but I guess I'll let everyone in on their awesome octopus. Everything I had was great, but the most memorable item was the octopus. I probably would skip the toast, but I came here a while ago and I'm sure the menu changes.I'd recommend sitting at the bar so you can see the chefs' do what they do best.",5.0
"I love this place. The food, the atmosphere, the wine list, the service... It's all really good! It's in the coziest little space and the decor makes it extra inviting. I've been there twice. Let's get down to it:The first visit I only meant to go for a glass of wine and an app... So we ordered the Cauliflower toast and two glasses of rose. Who knew something with ""toast"" in it's name could be so freakin' delicious? Since that was good and we were a glass of wine in, we ordered the Kale Panzanella. What a nice new way to have Kale in light salad with generous sized croutons and thinly sliced mild cheese. We decided we were on a roll and went for a double: the hamachi (the couple next to us ordered it so we had to upon seeing it!) and the lobster toast. These two were even more delicious then the first two. The second visit I dragged one of my UES friends there knowing she'd be impressed. Our food selections weren't quite as good as my first visit, but everything was still delicious none the less.  We did the Cauliflower toast again (a must!) as well as the Kale Panzanella. She too loved the toast - and the salad was a nice add on, though not a must have in her opinion. Next we ordered the Hen of the Woods - in my friends exact words it ""wasn't amazing, but it was good"". The hamachi was once again a huge win and my friend loved it. My ideal menu would go back to my first visit (Cauliflower Toast, Lobster Toast, Kale Salad and Hamachi), but I'd still be open to trying some new things. The people next to us on the last visit had the Octopus and it looked amazing - but we were two full to order it. I'm also eager to try the black bass. We'll be going back for a third visit soon:-)",4.0
"4.5Really fantastic meal. The mushrooms, barley, scallops and octopus were all delicious and unique. Everything was inventive and different and had many flavor layers. It was really a great meal. In addition to the food, the service was excellent. Relaxed and normal but really great. I would give one piece of feedback to improve an almost excellent restaurant. The prices seemed a little high for the portion sizes and ambience in the restaurant. The food was excellent, don't get me wrong, but it seemed a bit overpriced relative to the neighborhood and offering. Related, the bottles of wine were a bit overpriced - like 3x the retail price, rather than maybe 2x? Can't wait to bring friends here!",4.0
"Great service by the bar and great atmosphere. The food was pretty good, not too memorable. My favorites were the hamachi and the hen of the woods mushrooms. The other items I got had an odd acidic taste and the flavors were a bit confused especially in the crostini.",3.0
"Chef Andrew makes miracle in this quaint part of Brooklyn. Great food! If you are in the area or looking for something different, give Bergen Hill a try. We were very fortunate to sit at the counter, right in front of the Chef. The setting was so intimate, the experience itself worth 5 star. We had 5 dishes in the following order: - Hen of the Woods -Cauliflower Toast -Hamachi-Octopus- Barley Risotto The tempo of the dishes were perfect. The new course came when we have just a few more bites of the previous course. Every dish was so carefully assembled. The ingredients in each dish were harmonious, yet stood out individually. The flavor continued to develop in your mouth if you savor it a bit longer. Chef Andrew passionately explained each dish with such joy. We felt so privileged to have this ""front seat"" view of his tiny kitchen and watch him making magic. Personally I love a shorter menu because you know it is carefully crafted by the chef. They are giving you the best food! ""Happy cook makes happy food.""  - Chef Andrew",5.0
"Ate and loved the oysters, lobster toasts and cioppino, plus a delicious gin drink (okay, two). The service was great and I definitely recommend sitting at the bar if it's just the two of you, as there just might be extra food treats in store. It's now in my top 5 in the hood.",5.0
Tiny joint with amazing food and killer cocktails. The menu might not give the best description of the food but go with it--you will be thrilled with the results. Be sure to order about 3 dishes a piece as they can be on the small side. Will go back again and again.,5.0
"This is incredibly overdue, but my husband and I went to this restaurant a few weeks back for our anniversary and had a meal to remember. We sat at the bar and loved watching the care and dedication that went into each and every plate that they put out. We ordered a round of plates (the hamachi and octopus were personal favs) and couldn't get enough...so we ordered seconds of a few dishes. The music selection was on point to boot - the chef and my husband bonded over the old school hip hop that was mixed in. We live in Long Island so don't venture into Brooklyn too often, but definitely plan to go back.",5.0
"Came here on a weekday with a friend around 6:30 so it was easy to to get seats. The place looks nice. Its a small place with dim lighting and great music. Great ambiance. But lets talk about the FOOOOOD!!!!!The food was fantastic. The Cauliflower toast was amazing. Very light and refresing. If spring could taste like something, it'd probably be that. We also had the Hamatchi, Salmon, Tuna, Octopus, and mixed mushroom dish.The Hamatchi was our favorite. It was super fresh. The mix of lime and avocado was perfect and the fish had a great texture.The Salmon could be an acquired taste as it has the texture of smoked salmon but its cured in beet juice. My friend didn't like it as much but I thought it was pretty good,The Tuna was another super refreshing dish. It has a lightness to it and of course the fish was fresh. There are a little jalapenos in it so if you aren't used to eating spicy you might want to avoid it or ask them to tone it down a bit. The Octopus was probably the least favorite for the both of us. It was tasty but I was expecting a different texture. I expected it to have a bit more of a bite. It was too soft for my liking. The broccoli rabe mixture lining the plate was very good though. It had a little bit of mustard in the broccoli rabe so it was very interesting and delicious.The mixed mushroom dish might also be another acquired taste if you're not into mushrooms. The mushrooms have a very nice earthy taste, and theres also a mushroom puree on the bottom. We both thought it was very good.Overall, the place was great. The wait staff was super friendly and very attentive. We had a few glasses of wine too and they were always checking up on us to see if we were good. If you're thinking about going, I would definitely get the Hamatchi, Tuna, Cauliflower toast, and mixed mushrooms. You do have to get a few dishes as the dishes run on the small side, which is just an incentive to try all the things they have. I would definitely go back again if i had the time.",5.0
"Fiancé and I were searching for a last minute place to celebrate. Bergen Hill did not disappoint. The staff was incredibly friendly and attentive. I love how detailed and helpful the hostess was. She not only seated us, but waitressed as well. I also noticed her seating a table of 4 behind us at a corner table. She suggested that the ladies should sit in the middle, while the gentlemen sat at the ends. As ladies probably wouldn't mind rubbing knees. Adorably insightful.We sat at the Chef's table to be closer to the chef (obviously). He welcomed us and was all smiles. I kept peeking over the counter to get a better look at how he plated the food. He even picked up one of the entrees so I could get a better look. How thoughtful! Since neither of us are big drinkers, we did not pair our meal with any wine or cocktails.However, by the looks of it they had a wide selection of wines and special concoctions on the menu. Our hostess/waitress mentioned that their portions are made small to medium sized, and for 2 people she suggested we chose 5-6 items on the menu. We picked the scallops, hamatchi, octopus,  hen of the woods, & the lobster toast.The Lobster Toast came out first. The toast was thick enough to hold the weight/moisture of the lobster salad. I was afraid that it would get too soggy like some places. I can't remember all the other ingredients, but there was a pickled vegetable(s) of some sort that gave it a sweet/tangy/crunchy flavor. I love anything crunchy, and it matched perfectly with the lobster. Next we had the Hamachi. I always mention that I am not a big seafood lover, and if anything has too much of that ""fishy"" aroma, I pretty much cannot stand. The fish was cut at a nice thickness (not so thin that you felt you weren't getting your money's worth), and incredibly fresh! Garnished with pickled radishes, it was divine. Although the puree underneath it was a little on the saltier side for me, I never enjoyed raw fish so much at a non-Japanese restaurant. Eating it was almost as enjoyable as watching him slicing up the fish to serve to us.3rd was the Hen of the Woods. This may have been my favorite. Pan seared oyster mushrooms (I believe). Lightly seasoned, crispy mushrooms over a mushroom puree. Simple and delicious. Yum.4th came the Scallops. Perfectly seared, served with fried quinoa and baby carrots and squash?. You could tell how fresh the scallops were just by cuttting into them. Like butter. Melt in your mouth scallop-y goodness. My Fiancé was never a big fan of quinoa. It reminds him too much a of a loofah. But, the way Bergen Hill prepared it, he couldn't help himself.Our last entree was the Octopus. Nicely seared, served with what looked like barley and white raisins. I thought white raisins would be a little strange with octopus. How wrong I was. The onion puree went really well with the charred taste of the octopus. I would say at this point, I wasn't over the top full, but comfortable. Either way, we had to get the dessert. Marshmallow ice cream - made in house! Whaat? I thought it was going to be too sweet. In fact it must have shown on my face because the chef assured me how delicious it was. We pretty much ended up licking the plate clean... need I say more? If you don't know, you need to go find out. This is definitely the next restaurant that you want to put on your list to try out. Great atmosphere and even better food.",5.0

"My husband and I were surprised with an amazing meal at Bergen Hill tonight. We were trying to check out Dover but the wait was too long. After looking over the yelp reviews we decide to give it a try and am I ever glad we did. We tried the Kale Panzenella, Pea and Goat Cheese Toast, Hen of the woods, hamachi, Scallops and Octopus (it's a small plates place. We not just fatties).  Each dish was amazing and beautifully presented. If I was forced to pick I would say the Hamachi and Octopus were our favorites but everything was really wonderful. The vibe is intimate and bonus points to whomever is in charge of the music - nice eclectic mix. Definitely recommend.",5.0
"While expensive, Bergen Hill is totally worth it. We started off with yummy cocktails, which were good but all cocktails frankly have a goodness to them. Then, had the cauliflower toast. I am not always a huge fan of cauliflower, but this toast was great. It used wonderful bread and a cauliflower reduction maybe? Anyway, the highlight was the fish - the black bass, which had a tender juicy consistency and at concurrent amazing smokey taste; and the squid, which was presented as if it were pasta. All in all, a great experience.",5.0
"Yes!Easy and chic, comfortable and hip, Bergen Hill is one of those restaurants where you're going to hear a lot of ""oh my god""s and ""this is sooooooo good"" going on all around you. Because - oh my god - everything was sooooooo good!Knockout dishes were the squid - a calamari tagliatelle in a zesty pomodoro sauce, the octopus with an onion puree and farro, and the scallops with winter squash. The seafood in each dish was seriously the most tender I have ever experienced, and one will be hard-pressed not to rethink calamari and octopus after delighting here.Wines were excellent too, and asking the server to pair with the dishes produced very good results.If there's space available, by all means sit at the bar. There you'll get the opportunity to witness chef Andrew D'Ambrosi's magic right before your very eyes.Highly Recommended! (And just a block from the F train!)",5.0
"Really excited to be one of the first reviews for this fabulous new restaurant.  And after eating here, I'm sure that I'll be far from the last.Came here with some foodie friends, and despite our differing preferences and dietary needs, we were able to have a fabulous dinner.  I started my night with ""A Day Apart""- a gin cocktail always makes me happy, but the complex flavors and the interaction with the absinthe was something to remember.   I continued with a poppy gibsou (I think that's what it was called) and it was pretty good as well.As far as food went, we all were reaching over one another to try the varying plates.  To start, the ""pea"" toast was great - refreshing with the mint and pea puree, but deep with the goat cheese creamyness.  The cauliflower was also quite good, though I'm not a huge fan of raisins.  For the seafood dishes, I remember hamachi (amazing jalapeno puree served with it), scallop (mustard greens? nice), and the tuna (again, jalapeno but with green olive was an interesting pairing).If you find yourself looking for something different, or perhaps just in the neighborhood, I'd highly recommend Bergen Hill.",5.0
"This was my first of many visits to Bergen Hill. It's quaint and stylish without trying to hard. We sat at the far end of the bar so we could be a part of Chef Andrew Dambrosi world as he and his chefs prepared our courses. We started with burrata and tuna toast, followed by the lobster toast.

"Do you love sashimi and/or crudo? Do you delight in delicious seafood? Run, don't walk, to Bergen Hill. Chef Andrew D'Ambrosi has some seriously amazing flavor combinations going on.

"My husband and I were surprised with an amazing meal at Bergen Hill tonight. We were trying to check out Dover but the wait was too long. After looking over the yelp reviews we decide to give it a try and am I ever glad we did. We tried the Kale Panzenella, Pea and Goat Cheese Toast, Hen of the woods, hamachi, Scallops and Octopus (it's a small plates place. We not just fatties).  Each dish was amazing and beautifully presented. If I was forced to pick I would say the Hamachi and Octopus were our favorites but everything was really wonderful. The vibe is intimate and bonus points to whomever is in charge of the music - nice eclectic mix. Definitely recommend.",5.0
"While expensive, Bergen Hill is totally worth it. We started off with yummy cocktails, which were good but all cocktails frankly have a goodness to them. Then, had the cauliflower toast. I am not always a huge fan of cauliflower, but this toast was great. It used wonderful bread and a cauliflower reduction maybe? Anyway, the highlight was the fish - the black bass, which had a tender juicy consistency and at concurrent amazing smokey taste; and the squid, which was presented as if it were pasta. All in all, a great experience.",5.0
"Yes!Easy and chic, comfortable and hip, Bergen Hill is one of those restaurants where you're going to hear a lot of ""oh my god""s and ""this is sooooooo good"" going on all around you. Because - oh my god - everything was sooooooo good!Knockout dishes were the squid - a calamari tagliatelle in a zesty pomodoro sauce, the octopus with an onion puree and farro, and the scallops with winter squash. The seafood in each dish was seriously the most tender I have ever experienced, and one will be hard-pressed not to rethink calamari and octopus after delighting here.Wines were excellent too, and asking the server to pair with the dishes produced very good results.If there's space available, by all means sit at the bar. There you'll get the opportunity to witness chef Andrew D'Ambrosi's magic right before your very eyes.Highly Recommended! (And just a block from the F train!)",5.0
"Really excited to be one of the first reviews for this fabulous new restaurant.  And after eating here, I'm sure that I'll be far from the last.Came here with some foodie friends, and despite our differing preferences and dietary needs, we were able to have a fabulous dinner.  I started my night with ""A Day Apart""- a gin cocktail always makes me happy, but the complex flavors and the interaction with the absinthe was something to remember.   I continued with a poppy gibsou (I think that's what it was called) and it was pretty good as well.As far as food went, we all were reaching over one another to try the varying plates.  To start, the ""pea"" toast was great - refreshing with the mint and pea puree, but deep with the goat cheese creamyness.  The cauliflower was also quite good, though I'm not a huge fan of raisins.  For the seafood dishes, I remember hamachi (amazing jalapeno puree served with it), scallop (mustard greens? nice), and the tuna (again, jalapeno but with green olive was an interesting pairing).If you find yourself looking for something different, or perhaps just in the neighborhood, I'd highly recommend Bergen Hill.",5.0
"This was my first of many visits to Bergen Hill. It's quaint and stylish without trying to hard. We sat at the far end of the bar so we could be a part of Chef Andrew Dambrosi world as he and his chefs prepared our courses. We started with burrata and tuna toast, followed by the lobster toast. Both were fantastic.

The kitchen is tiny and, working off glorified hot plates, it is nothing short of a miracle that they produce the quality of food that found itself on our plates. They essentially eliminated the excuse that one can't cook amazing food in New York-sized kitchens. ""Damn you and your perfection, dear chefs!"" But I digress.

The hamachi was outstanding. Hen of the woods was rich and and the pickled mushrooms on the plate were an interesting touch. The striped bass was very good also.

"This past Sunday,  I experienced Bergen Hill for the second time in a month and it was yet again, a fantastic evening.   We were able to eat at the Chef's Counter and we had such a wonderful experience, from beginning to end.  We ordered five of the fish dishes -- hamachi, black bass, arctic char, octopus and calamari, and none of us could choose a favorite as they were all unbelievably delicious.  We also ordered the barley risotto and pineapple dessert, which were exceptional.  The service was phenomenal.  At the end of the meal, we were given sparkling wine on the house as they knew it was our anniversary, and we thought this was so kind and generous.  As we spoke about how much we loved the food, the chefs and servers seemed so pleased, so modest, and so gracious.  They truly seemed to enjoy watching -- and listening to -- how much we were loving our meal. I can't speak highly enough of this restaurant.  We have eaten at many wonderful restaurants in this -- and other -- Brooklyn neighborhoods, and this place is unbeatable.  Having the opportunity to hear the chefs talk about the development and creation of each dish is an unparalleled experience.",5.0

We sat at the counter which I recommend because you get to see all the dishes on the menu as they come up. The chefs were also very friendly and helpful.

"This was my first time at Bergen Hill - it was a lazy Sunday and my fiancée and I were looking for something nice to celebrate. We decided on this restaurant when we came across it on Yelp and saw that it had several good reviews and we were somewhat close by at the time.When I first stepped in, I expected a completely different experience. The place is small and not particularly fancy. I immediately lowered my expectations. We decided to sit at the bar for a better experience (something I recommend to anyone planning on eating here). The longer I sat there, the most I came to appreciate the ambiance. It was very relaxed - normally, when you go to a restaurant for great food, you have to sit in a suit for 4 hours as they bring out your thousand course meal. This was different - it was relaxed and friendly... almost hipsterish.Although this isn't a 5-star (in terms of class) restaurant, the service is top notch. Don't expect them to fold your napkin when you go to the restroom or be uber professional. The service is attentive, effective, and prompt. There was, at no point in time during the dinner, that my glass of water was empty or that I had to ask for more water. The staff is very friendly and courteous. We also were able to speak with the sous chef (Anthony) - as Head Chef Andrew D'Ambrosi was off that day - during the meal. Service was top notch and fits very well with the atmosphere.The food is what really sets this place apart though. Here and there, some of the items were a little on the salty side, but the food was overall... delicious. All the food comes in small plates, like tapas. Between my fiancée and I, we ordered 5 plates: octopus; Hamachi; scallops; hen of the woods; and lobster toast. We expected to still be hungry at the end - but we left with full bellies (after dessert of course). My personal favorites were the scallops and lobster toast, but all of the plates were VERY good. For dessert, we had the marshmallow ice cream - also very good. All ingredients were very fresh and everything (or at least everything we had) was made in house - yes, including the ice cream.The best way for me to convey how satisfied I was with this restaurant is this - I plan on coming back.",5.0
"I live half a block from this place, and until reading the five start reviews on here, I didnt visit it.  It is a very tiny place.  We walked in on Tuesday at about 7.30pm and beause we didnt have reservations, we sat at ""the bar,"" literally right in front of the two chefs.  Im not sure but I feel fairly certain that one, if not both, of the chefs own the place.  In all seriousess, sitting right in front of the chefs, I felt like I was on an episode of Top Chef.  If you eyeball the menu, you'll see its broken into four sections.  They are all small plates, and its recommended you order 2-3 per person.  As is the case in such restaurants, the plates actually are small, so I agree with the recommendation.  Of the seafood 1/4 of the menu, only two of the ten or so items are cooked.  The rest are raw, and they're not items you can ask be altered and cooked, because it spoils the integrity of the food.Their cocktail menu is pleasing to many, as I heard those around me speaking, but I didnt want alcohol.  They had no non alcoholic beverages other than water.  I did have the waitress make me a mocktail - sweet and cucumber-like.  $8 but generally cocktails $12 range.Every item I sampled was entirely unique, and unlike anything else I'd ever had.  It was a bit awkward sitting in front of the chefs, because we literally had to whisper about what we liked, because we literally felt guilty not finishing something or liking it, because the chefs actually asked if we did not like the dish.  They were very kind, but still, I found it uncomfy.  In fact, the server misheard one of our dishes.  We'd ordered broccoli soup but instead ended up with a barley dish.  The chefs heard this, and allowed us to keep the dish, but still comp'ed it from our bill.  I thought that was beyond fair.My favorite dish was the scallops (not raw!)  The only dessert available is a sorbet, which was slightly disappointing to me.

So I walked in, hiking shoes on, plastic bags in hand and was offered a seat at the bar without too much attitude. I had the lobster toast, which I requested without Tarragon oil. Really great lobster, very fresh and flavorful, and not puny in size. I also had the kale panzanella, which took a few minutes to adjust to, as the kale is heavily marinated. I prefer my kale roasted and left to its own devices, but the dish was interesting and grew on me.  The beer on tap that day, Reissdorf Kolsch, was very fresh and light, in a good way. The one offering for dessert did not appeal ( chocolate ice-cream with crumbled cookies or something to that effect. As described, it did not sound interesting ) so I had to pass.  I cannot wait to go back and try the black bass and hen-of-the woods dish.",4.0
"This restaurant was nothing like what I assumed it would be from the outside. Quasi-sushi type small plates and nice cocktails in a wood and tile atmosphere. It's somewhat hard to describe.

"A true gem.

"My review is partially influenced by the fact that we originally had reservations at Nightingale 9 but they refused to seat us because we were late (see my review there) so we were grumpy and frustrated and really wanted to go someplace that would seat usWe chose Bergen Hill because its next to my yoga studio and on my walk home from yoga, 2 waiters said hello to me, and invited me to come in and eat some time.  See-every contact matters!  We were a party of 4 and immediately seated at a corner post at the bar.  Everybody was incredibly friendly, welcoming and cheerful.  The music was eclectic and fun, and the decor is interesting without being distracting.  It's a small but warm space; but be aware there are only a few tables and much of the seating is at the bar.The food itself is delicious and unique.  It's seafood, and its not ""new American"" or Asian fusion--its more just interesting, fresh seafood preparations with paired cocktails, some salads and some other apps.  The food is meant to be shared but the portions are not so tiny that you can't make a meal out of some of them.  Much of the fish is sushi grade freshness which is appropriate as many preparation are raw.  We had the pleasure of watching the executive chef prepare much of it, and then having a great chat with him after our meal.We had a rare experience at Bergen Hill: We felt just for a short while that we were on vacation.  The vibe is so relaxed, friendly, pleasant and personal.  The staff were all chatting with us that it felt more like a big dinner party.  When we were paying the bill, the waiter was apologizing for slow service, and we all looked at each other and were like ""the service was slow? we never even noticed!""Service goes a long way for me--I am willing to forgive a LOT of things, even bad food, if i feel that folks are making an effort to provide me with a positive experience.  Here, they really want you to feel relaxed, comfortable and welcome--they are not looking for some cold distance dining experience.  Luckily the food is tasty enough that I don't have to forgive anything!",5.0
"This is a very chill and intimate spot for dinner and cocktails. The staff is very friendly and engaged, and the wood paneling sets a great mood. I highly recommend the whiskey cocktail that they serve, ""Char No. 8"", and getting several plates to share with the table (tapas style). We ordered the fluke, salmon, octopus, and mushrooms, among other things. The fish items are prepared with seasonal vegetables, which heightens the experience. There are some great vegetarian / vegan options on the menu, as well. If you grab a seat at the bar, you can watch the chef in his element and enjoy some friendly banter. I'll definitely be back.",5.0
"This restaurant experience was perfect in every way. Our server (forgot her name) was smart, attentive, and friendly. Heck, even the waiter who just filled our water seemed to care more than average. The courses were spaced nicely, a sign of an organized kitchen! We had the fennel toast which was outstanding. The hamachi was outstanding. Hen of the woods was rich and and the pickled mushrooms on the plate were an interesting touch. The striped bass was very good also. Nothing was over salted which is a biggie for me--I like to taste the ingredients, not just a pile of salt! The cocktails and wine selection were varied and interesting. Glad I came before this place is ""discovered"" and I can't get in!!",5.0
"This past Sunday,  I experienced Bergen Hill for the second time in a month and it was yet again, a fantastic evening.   We were able to eat at the Chef's Counter and we had such a wonderful experience, from beginning to end.  We ordered five of the fish dishes -- hamachi, black bass, arctic char, octopus and calamari, and none of us could choose a favorite as they were all unbelievably delicious.  We also ordered the barley risotto and pineapple dessert, which were exceptional.  The service was phenomenal.  At the end of the meal, we were given sparkling wine on the house as they knew it was our anniversary, and we thought this was so kind and generous.  As we spoke about how much we loved the food, the chefs and servers seemed so pleased, so modest, and so gracious.  They truly seemed to enjoy watching -- and listening to -- how much we were loving our meal. I can't speak highly enough of this restaurant.  We have eaten at many wonderful restaurants in this -- and other -- Brooklyn neighborhoods, and this place is unbeatable.  Having the opportunity to hear the chefs talk about the development and creation of each dish is an unparalleled experience.",5.0
"This is truly a special place and i will definitely be back. Every dish we had was unique and tasty. We shared the hens of the woods, cauliflower toast and lobster toast as appetizers which were exceptional. For entrees we shared the lobster bisque and the tuna. Loved the bisque but the tuna just good, not great. I also had the gin mixed drink on the menu which I enjoyed. We sat at the counter which I recommend because you get to see all the dishes on the menu as they come up. The chefs were also very friendly and helpful. Its a tiny space so you are packed in but its not uncomfortable and its easy to carry on a conversation. Total tab including 3 glasses of wine was approx $124 before tax/tip - cheap for what you get!",5.0
"This was my first time at Bergen Hill - it was a lazy Sunday and my fiancée and I were looking for something nice to celebrate. We decided on this restaurant when we came across it on Yelp and saw that it had several good reviews and we were somewhat close by at the time.When I first stepped in, I expected a completely different experience. The place is small and not particularly fancy. I immediately lowered my expectations. We decided to sit at the bar for a better experience (something I recommend to anyone planning on eating here). The longer I sat there, the most I came to appreciate the ambiance. It was very relaxed - normally, when you go to a restaurant for great food, you have to sit in a suit for 4 hours as they bring out your thousand course meal. This was different - it was relaxed and friendly... almost hipsterish.Although this isn't a 5-star (in terms of class) restaurant, the service is top notch. Don't expect them to fold your napkin when you go to the restroom or be uber professional. The service is attentive, effective, and prompt. There was, at no point in time during the dinner, that my glass of water was empty or that I had to ask for more water. The staff is very friendly and courteous. We also were able to speak with the sous chef (Anthony) - as Head Chef Andrew D'Ambrosi was off that day - during the meal. Service was top notch and fits very well with the atmosphere.The food is what really sets this place apart though. Here and there, some of the items were a little on the salty side, but the food was overall... delicious. All the food comes in small plates, like tapas. Between my fiancée and I, we ordered 5 plates: octopus; Hamachi; scallops; hen of the woods; and lobster toast. We expected to still be hungry at the end - but we left with full bellies (after dessert of course). My personal favorites were the scallops and lobster toast, but all of the plates were VERY good. For dessert, we had the marshmallow ice cream - also very good. All ingredients were very fresh and everything (or at least everything we had) was made in house - yes, including the ice cream.The best way for me to convey how satisfied I was with this restaurant is this - I plan on coming back.",5.0
"I live half a block from this place, and until reading the five start reviews on here, I didnt visit it.  It is a very tiny place.  We walked in on Tuesday at about 7.30pm and beause we didnt have reservations, we sat at ""the bar,"" literally right in front of the two chefs.  Im not sure but I feel fairly certain that one, if not both, of the chefs own the place.  In all seriousess, sitting right in front of the chefs, I felt like I was on an episode of Top Chef.  If you eyeball the menu, you'll see its broken into four sections.  They are all small plates, and its recommended you order 2-3 per person.  As is the case in such restaurants, the plates actually are small, so I agree with the recommendation.  Of the seafood 1/4 of the menu, only two of the ten or so items are cooked.  The rest are raw, and they're not items you can ask be altered and cooked, because it spoils the integrity of the food.Their cocktail menu is pleasing to many, as I heard those around me speaking, but I didnt want alcohol.  They had no non alcoholic beverages other than water.  I did have the waitress make me a mocktail - sweet and cucumber-like.  $8 but generally cocktails $12 range.Every item I sampled was entirely unique, and unlike anything else I'd ever had.  It was a bit awkward sitting in front of the chefs, because we literally had to whisper about what we liked, because we literally felt guilty not finishing something or liking it, because the chefs actually asked if we did not like the dish.  They were very kind, but still, I found it uncomfy.  In fact, the server misheard one of our dishes.  We'd ordered broccoli soup but instead ended up with a barley dish.  The chefs heard this, and allowed us to keep the dish, but still comp'ed it from our bill.  I thought that was beyond fair.My favorite dish was the scallops (not raw!)  The only dessert available is a sorbet, which was slightly disappointing to me. Oh and thankfully, they take cards.  Unlike some places, which are equally expensive, yet expect you to only pay in cash.  Keeping in mind that there was only one cocktail ordered, I think our bill was $90.I quite enjoyed the very eccentric soundtrack.  It started off with an emphasis on really old school hiphop, but went on to include show tunes and other randomness.  Lastly, the entire experience was about 90minutes.  I am aware that many people like that - a lengthy meal experience.  I just happen to be unlike many people, in that I get slightly anxious after an hour passes.And, there you have it!",4.0

"One of my more memorable NYC dining experiences.

Every single dish we ordered - the kale salad, the trout toast, the octopus, and the squid tagliatelle - was unique, inventive and absolutely delicious. The chef served us the entrees right from where he had been cooking them on the burners in front of us, and hopefully he could see how thrilled we were to discover that the tagliatelle was not actually pasta but a bowl of spaghetti-thin strips of calamari. It's really unbelievable that the staff is able to cook everything on the menu with a few burners and a small oven.

"As a fan of Top Chef, I had been meaning to check out Bergen Hill since it first opened late last year.  My wife and I, on the spur of the moment, decide that we'd drop in Saturday night.  While the Chef's Counter and tables were fully booked, the bar seating was open for walk-in diners and quickly grabbed the two remaining seats.  What followed was one of the more memorable dining experiences we've ever had. We ordered the Oyster special , Hen of Woods vegetable dish, Cauliflower toast, Fennel toast, Hamachi crudo, Salmon crudo, and Octopus.  Every dish blew us away. How Andrew & his sous chef are able to create food of that quality on an induction burner speaks to their talent.  The octopus was the best I've ever had.  More tender than the best sushi restaurants in the city, 15 East included.While we opted for wine, the cocktail menu looked equally appealing, which isn't surprising given the number of cocktail bars they own in the East Village.  I'll definitely work my way through their cocktail list on the next visit.The staff was incredibly friendly and added to the overall charm of the place.  We got to chatting with the owner Ravi, who we learned lived across the street and had been putting in extra time here since the recent NY Times review.    He was extremely humble and seemed genuinely interested in meeting the customers and getting their feedback, a lot of whom you could tell were local, ourselves included.  He even bought some drinks and shared a few glasses of wine with us toward the end of the night.Hopefully they can expand the restaurant in order to offer a full dessert menu and add more seats, which will better accommodate me once the crowds start taking the Mecca here from Manhattan via the F Train (who am I kidding, it will clearly be the Uber set.) While Dale is the more well known of Top Chef alum in Brooklyn with some solid restaurants to his credit, I definitely think Andrew's food further merits a trip from Manhattan, which I cannot say for the prior.  He definitely has the cooking chops to build his own mini-empire in his own unique style.",5.0

"From the interesting pairings of flavors to the entertaining music and open setting, Bergen Hill will make you feel at home while surprising your palate.  Chef Andy and Chef Tony introduced my friend and I to unexpected flavors and textures.  Our server, Meg was incredibly knowledgeable, funny and made us feel like we were talking to an old friend.  I highly recommend this restaurant for friends, family and dates.  I'm afraid that soon enough I won't be able to get a table here but with the tempting food, tunes and staff...they deserve to be booked every night.",5.0
I will dream about this meal.  We stumbled upon this place and I cannot wait to go back.  Get the octopus!!!!!,5.0
"Love this place! Cozy, intimate decor, serious but unpretentious about the menu, awesome cocktails and well-priced wine selection. And food was totally delicious - favorites were hamachi, octopus, cauliflower toast, and kale. But everything was awesome. Perfect place with small group of friends or for sitting at the bar on a date.",5.0

"I don't often venture outside Manhattan just for dinner, but I thought it might be fun to try this place because I read it was good in the ny times. My friend and I got a table without having to wait, which was pretty cool considering how popular the restaurant is. The waitresses were all very outgoing and made us feel very comfortable, definitely quality customer service! Most of all, the food was beautifully done. We ordered a bunch of different things and each came out individually, having its own interesting, delicious qualities, and in a sequential order that surprisingly made perfect sense. We ended with the fantastic salmon dish, which was a great choice to give us as our last dish because it was so light yet so satisfying. This was the kind of food that you could definitely eat a lot of without feeling overly stuffed. Also, the price is very reasonable. I'm not sure why it has four dollar signs on its yelp page because a dinner for two came out to $50, which I'd say is actually an amazing deal...",5.0
