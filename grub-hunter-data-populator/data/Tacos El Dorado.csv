"is this truck for real? ... am i.. dreaming? 11/17/15 - my belly was growling super loud and I didn't want home food, but didn't want something mediocre/overpriced from seamless.. hopped in my car and drove less than 10 mins to this GEM. It was raining so there wasn't a line, but as soon as I ordered, 3 people appeared behind me! Glad i was able to beat the rush =P + 2 chicken tacos+ 1 steak (asada) tostada + chicken enchiladas w/ beans and rice. ------------------------------------------------------------------------I would order all of those dishes AGAIN. no hesitation. + enchilada platter was STUNNING. visually beautiful. and tasted beautiful lol. Sliced avocado on top with queso fresco. you know when you put your fingers together and make a kissy face/sound (is this an italian gesture?) because the food is just that good?... yeah.. that's what i did. + tacos were super super fresh and chicken was seasoned perfectly. + tostada was SUPERB. omg. do it. order this. guac and bean spread on it! ------------------------------------------------------------------------I will definitely return to this food cart. Thank you to the lovely ladies who served me Tuesday night!",5.0
"SO GOOD! I love the tripa tacos. The truck is great. Currently learning the hard way that their delivery from the main restaurant isn't on point, still waiting for an hour for a $50 order :(",4.0
"The food is so good here, but every time I come here they try and over charge me $5 and I always have to argue with them.",1.0
"Finally made the decision to try these out after seeing some late night crowds. Got 2 tacos of each - carne asada, carnitas, and al pastor. I was shocked how good they were! Really struggled to find a good place in the neighborhood. Highly recommend",5.0
The food is ehhh but the service is so bad you might as well not order it. Nobody speaks good English and the order took over an hour and I live 10 minutes away. Just don't waste your time.,1.0
"this is my favorite neighborhood taco place! we're predominantly vegetarians so we only get the veggie burrito ($5.50) , cheese enchilladas, ($7) and veggie tacos ($7). and wow, are they heaven. we order from here at least once a week and have been doing so for over 3 years! love it dearly. the green tomatillo salsa is to die for, and they really should jar it. come here!!!! it's all soo good, you won't be disappointed.",5.0
"I regularly eat at this little Taco truck but not only because it's close to my place. The tortillas here are so fresh and the salsa verde is amazing, 5 for their Bistek tacos and fast service. It's simply one of the best cheap food outlets around Ditmas Park if not all Brooklyn.I saw someone rating them 2 because they didn't accept some cards or certificates. Dude! This is just a truck, you probably should've tried their other outlet (The brick-and-mortar at Flatbush Ave near Clarkson Ave).",5.0
"Taco truck was gone but there is another location on Flatbush! All I can say is that place is amazing! Hands down one of the best mexican taco places in Brooklyn! Ordered tacos, quesadillas, burrito and mexican soda. Everything was delicious! The guys at that spot cook it right there in minutes! I went there with a mexican who's always criticizing Mexican food in US but she said that place was really good which is a good sign. And while we were waiting on our order another Mexican guy walked in. Will be coming back for more tacos again and again!",5.0
I love that this taco truck is so close to home. I'm from SoCal and crave a fresh taco or hearty burrito and this place never disappoints. I usually get a spicy pork burrito for my husband and it always hits the spot. I love the chicken enchiladas. The rice is moist and seasoned well and the beans are delicious. The chicken burrito is so good that I usually order it with the enchiladas so I can have it later. That's how much I love Mexican food and how much this little taco cart satisfies my cravings. Well worth trying this place out!,5.0
"I'm working my way through the menu, but keep getting stuck on the pastor and carnitas burritos. They couldn't be any better or any fresher.  I find myself craving them whenever I'm hungry.  Do yourself a favor and stop by this amazing food cart.",5.0
"This place is both conveniently located a block from my domicile and a block from the subway.The price is right, the folks are nice, the food is pretty good, and the wait has never been more than 10 minutes even with 3-5 people ahead of me in line.",5.0
"Always amazing food and super nice service. Can't really beat it. I would drink the salsa Verde, it's that good.",5.0
"I don't know why tacos el dorado would have any less than 5 stars! Fast, fresh, made to order and the best tacos and burritos I've ever had.",5.0
"Really exact what I want having grown used to LA Mexican. Same exact satisfaction. Although I never know when they will be there. But when they are, I order",5.0
I will update this review to 4 stars when I see that they have stopped selling restaurant . Com certificates.     I went here because I had one and apparently they say they don't accept them.  That's annoying and I travelled here because of the certificate going a good bit out of my way.  I ordered a burrito anyway.  It was very tasty and the green sauce was great.   The people were friendly.   This is just a street cart.  Not an actual restaurant.  I will update the review to 3 or 4 stars when I see that they stop selling the certificates that they don't accept.   Annoying to travel and then have it rejected.,2.0
"Delicious, inexpensive and fast! My favorite is Edsalada de Pollo!!",5.0
"This little taco truck WINS. 5 stars across the board. Affordable food truck prices for fresh, delicious, and filling authentic Mexican food. I had a roasted pork taco and two chicken tostadas that filled me right up and were absolutely delicious. All for $7. Fantastic.",5.0
Chicken Tacos have been a bit lackluster lately. But their Sopes are killin' it. Try the Lengua Sopes for a dynamite taco-truck experience.,4.0
"Update on the pricing from the previous review, tacos are $3 or 3 for $7. I'll try to remember to snap the menu and some other pictures next time I stop by.I lived around the corner for ten months without ever seriously considering the food. What a fool I was, it makes all other Mexican options in the neighborhood look like child's play.The girls working are always in good spirits, I'm particularly impressed when they get busy how they can still be social with all the customers. During dinner hours the corner ends up being a social hub for the neighborhood, my inner anthropologist loves to eavesdrop on all the conversations.",4.0
This place was great. Affordable and everything was made fresh. Close by and delicious. The red hot sauce and green sauce were amazing. Lot of menu options,4.0

"I love this place. They cook everything fresh and unlike many food trucks that show pics of meals with all the trimmings but only give you a bit of crappy iceberg lettuce, here you get the lettuce, the avocado. Everything. Plus yummy sauces. The meals are cooked to order so be prepared to wait if you don't call ahead. I've only had the arroz con pollo. Should try something else but I like it! The ladies cooking are always fast, efficient and friendly. I'll be trying delivery for the first time tonight.",4.0
"3 veggie tacos is 7 bucks and comes with delicious homemade red and green salsas, sliced cucumber and radish, and perfectly juicy lime wedges. heaven. much better than many other taquerias in the city. the beans are perfectly flavored and the green sauce is to die for.PS: i noticed someone rated this place 2 stars because they don't accept restaurant.com certificates -- i have to wonder whether that certificate wasn't for one of the other, unrelated 'el dorados' in brooklyn. those are brick and mortar, this place is a food truck. just a guess about what happened there.",5.0
"The food's definitely better than at the Myrtle-Wyckoff trucks, or the couple of other Mexican carts I've tried in the city. The only downside is that the steak (despite being nicely stewed) has a fair amount of gristle in it, which is maybe not so bad in a taco but does detract a little from the enjoyment of the burrito. Their green salsa is also great and had just the right level of spice to my taste.",4.0
"You can't go wrong with $2 tacos, $5 burritos, and a cheap and good assortment of breakfast, quesadillas, tortas, soups, hamburgers, and Ecuadorian food. Free delivery too!",4.0
"Yum! We usually order from here at least once a week! Love the tacos, burritos, and papusas!",5.0
