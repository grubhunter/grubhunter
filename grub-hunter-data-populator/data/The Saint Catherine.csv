"I really like this bar. It's cozy but has a large amount of space. There are beautiful lights lit all around the room that make it feel more intimate.Honestly, every time I've visited this bar there haven't been a lot of people, which I view as a great thing but obviously some would say differently. It's never too loud and the bartenders are always friendly. I ordered a cocktail tonight and the drink was very strong but still delicious. They have a small but solid selection of cocktails, drafts, wines, and liquors.  Definitely a great bar to stop in if you need to relax and take a break! Saint Catherine is fun for groups and for solo hanging out, it's almost like a coffee shop but with much better atmosphere.",4.0
"I've walked, driven, and skipped by this place and said I need to try it. It finally happened on a Saturday (Halloween to be exact) after laundry with a friend. I like the feel of this place when you walk inside. It was brunch time so it was pretty bright and with a good amount of people inside. We decided to sit at the bar. The bartender at the time...I don't remember her name was awesome. She was friendly without being too much. She also made sure we had everything we needed.My friend and I shared the baked eggs and French Toast. So happy we got the baked eggs....so delicious! I believe my friend asked for an extra piece of bread to drag through the dish to pick up the scraps...lol. The French toast was equally good too, but the star was the baked eggs. The cocktail to be had would be the craftman ...such a nice way to have bourbon. Especially when it's 2 for 1!Definitely will be back!",4.0
"Update on my review:  I was not aware that my brunch did come with home fried potatoes ( thanks Sara, for reaching out to me).  I thought I had to order them on the side, but my husband, who paid the bill, said that they were included in the $13.00 brunch price. So this makes it totally reasonable price ( a bargain in most places). My husband had the baked eggs and said that they were very good as well and that the rosemary toast was delicious. I do want to add that the side of thick cut bacon was very tasty as well. I updated my review to 5 stars as I think it is great when owners reach out to reviewers to clarify any issues and offer us Yelpers a 2nd chance to try them again and this is what Sara did.  It shows that they care about their patrons and  it is much appreciated as I do try to give fair and reasonable reviews.",5.0
"Early Saturday evening, electropop lounge music plays and serves as great background noise at a relatively quiet bar that welcomes romantic conversation.I wasn't crazy about their selection of drinks, but that may be more my personal taste. The drinks menu was still unique and inspired. I wished they did not run out of the white sangria I wanted to try initially, made with peach, strawberries, and lemon thyme.The food here is a worthy contender on this strip of restaurants, and just as inspired as the drink menu. The dish to grab here is the baked brie. It comes topped with jam and a side of rosemary toast. Each of the ingredients gets a chance to shine in your mouth and then blend together harmoniously. It's the main reason I'll be coming back.It's great for groups too as a bar with relaxed service, unique drinks, and great food,",4.0
Best artichoke dip I've ever had. Worth the 30 minute wait. Props to the Sunday night chef. Pretty good beer selection. Good date spot as well. Would have given 5 stars if the Bartender hadn't cold shouldered the +2 we added to her 4 guests. Black chick with dreadlocks and plaid shirt. Dropped her and extra large tip left without acknowledgement.,4.0
"3.5Great place to catch up with friends. Very chill vibe and not too loud or too many people.I didn't love my brie/jam dish. It was mainly jam. However, would definitely go back.",4.0
"It's rare I wander by Prospect Heights, but I'm thinking I need to start making more trips, due in part to little gems such as The Saint Catherine.Tucked onto the corner of Bergen and Washington, this place has a dark yet romantic ambiance, candles flickering on tables as jazz renditions of Wu-Tang Clan play overhead. The bar is full, the drink list is refreshing, and the small yet sizable menu is satiating. I went for an order of mac & cheese, which was creamy and full-bodied with big noodles. The beau ordered a turkey sandwich with apples and brie that was tasty. We were pretty split on the artichoke dip, however; I found it to be a little pungent, while he found it to be amazing. I was digging the cans of Austin Eastciders, which were very dry and refreshing. I was there for an old roommate's birthday party, and they accommodated us well and reserved us a nice line of tables along the windows facing Bergen. However, the food seemed to come out in a reverse order; my old roomie and her friends ordered before the beau and I arrived. We ordered about 15 minutes after they did, but we got our food first and they didn't get theres for another 10 minutes after we did! Go figure. Heh. I really enjoyed the vibe this place threw out, and maybe I can convince the old roomie to have more events there so I can find an excuse to come Prospect Heights-way!",4.0
"I've been to this bar a few times now with Ingrid S. and while I really like it I'm kind of teetering between 3 and 4 Yelp stars. Bartenders I've experienced are super nice and chill, their beer selection is pretty good, their food menu looks okay and their Happy Hour is okay ($1 off draft beers and $1 meatloaf sliders with a minimum purchase of 3...I'm not really a meatloaf person, meh). The Saint Catherine has a cool, rustic, hipster vibe and it would make for a good intimate-isn date or group gathering, but I just feel like there isn't much else here that would make this a destination bar for me.Yelp says that 3 stars represents ""A-OK"" and that's pretty much sums up my thoughts. A-OK.",3.0
"Two pints. Three sliders. My bill was $11.38. WHUT. If you're looking for an incredible deal, come to The Saint Catherine's happy hour, and stay for the Tuesday night Trivia.Came here for some drinks and a dinner and was welcomed by a very friendly and outgoing bartender. The place gets hoppin as the night wears on, and the crowd is mostly youngish.I still can't get over my bill. Such a good deal. Great service. I will be back a lot.",5.0

"This place is very charming and the staff were very friendly. However, I thought the food was overpriced for what we got for the food we got. I ordered the mac and cheese from the brunch menu and when it arrived, I found out it to be underwhelming. The mac and cheese came with a side of salad, but it was drizzled with generic salad dressing - nothing special, it was a bit of a sad salad. As for the mac and cheese itself, it didn't have any texture, it was all cheese and pasta and after a while, lost its appeal. I also felt like that might be a mac and cheese I would be able to make at home. I did want to like this place more.",2.0
"This place is my favorite brunch spot in Brooklyn. Delicious, affordable food (try the baked eggs, the charcuterie board, or the smoked salmon sandwich) and really solid cocktails.

"Super cute bar with a great happy hour, nice food menu, good music, and awesome bartenders. Can't help but like it! I stopped by earlier in the afternoon (I think I was there from about 5-8 on a Tuesday) and it was very quiet, but in a nice, off-the-beaten-track way. Had a great conversation with some of the bartenders/regulars, and tried some good beers. They have a solid beer selection, and all the beers are $2 off on happy hour, which means you can get stuff for as low as $3 for a pint. Can't really beat that. I'd say this is a great place for a chill couple of drinks with some friends, but not somewhere to get loud or expect a crazy party.",5.0
"What gets me out of my apartment and out on the town more than anything else? A fear of dying alone and a never satisfying need of social acceptance. But besides that, it's my neighborhood's newest bar. The Saint Catherine!The beers they have on tap is ever changing. This could be annoying to some but I never know what beers will be on tap when I go and I like a good changeup. They honestly change their selection as any bar I know. They never created a serious cocktail menu but that's not their thing and I respect that. Some bars attempt to do so, when they shouldn't and you end up paying $12 dollars for a dark and stormy which tastes as if they made it in the dark while they were being tossed around by a violent storm. The bartenders are great. Really nice people. Alana, Alahna, Elana, however it's spelled, is a real great bartender. Super friendly. Joe my man who also works at Bierkraft is another great guy. Good people, serving me drinks and making me laugh. Just like my uncle when I was 12. Shhhh don't tell my dad. The food is solid! They have sandwiches which are phenomenal. I've had the turkey, the meatloaf and the eggplant. All of which hit the spot. They have a roast pork sandwich which sounds just like a Cuban which I suppose I eventually will get. Same goes for the Italian they have. For a dollar you can upgrade upgrade upgrade for some potato salad as opposed to regular salad. And if the Simpsons taught me anything (Well I based my whole life around it) you don't make friends with salad. The one slightly negative thing I will say is, don't upgrade to the Mac and Cheese. I didn't care for it. They have dips and humus which are really great. Lots of options at The Saint Catherine. You just can't go wrong. Unless you order the Chilean Sea Bass, they don't serve that and thus you'd be wrong.Some people's reviews talked about how it was a no thrills bar and you know what at first it was just a basic bar. However it has evolved. They know their not in Manhattan where they can put some awful product out and expect patrons to come in just because their alcoholics. I may have a drinking problem but as a true Brooklynite I care where I do it! Sunday nights you can enjoy their Sunday night supper. Meals kick off at 8 and 9 o'clock you get live music from a guest musician. Tuesdays they have trivia. Five rounds. Three of which consist of art, sports and current events with two random rounds. Fun times. $50 dollar bar tab to first place. They serve brunch, which I still need to hit up and have baked goods which I haven't had yet. Lots of people swing through during the early parts of the day with their laptops to work, blog and/or watch porn. What degenerates! Who does work while they are in a bar? I also like their management's personality. They care. They give a damn. They constantly post on Facebook. They put up funny stuff. They do great work with their chalk board outside. They show pictures of their cat. They ask patrons for help with their logo, ideas and want input. They want to make people happy. They make me very happy. So I'm glad not have only dropped their first review but now their first five star review. I'm sure it won't be their last if you know what I mean.(I mean other people will really like this place and also give it five stars if you were confused)",5.0

There wasnt table service which was totally fine. I really wanted a cheap beer ( dont judge me) and asked for a coors light, however they only had a Budweiser. Eh, not my favorite.We quickly started looking over the menu, and decided 3 sandwiches and 2 apps.One app was the artichoke dip. It came out pipping hot! it had a really great texture and was perfect for the table. We also got the beef jerky, it was ok from what i remember.The 3 sandwiches we ordered were all fancier versions one could get at their local deli.We ordered an eggplant parm, italian and the salt sandwich. The salt was amazing! It came with speck, avocado, lettuce, tomato with chipotle mayo. It tasted like a fancy blt!All of the sandwiches came with sides of either chips or salad, but you could do mac and cheese or potato salad for an up-charge.If i lived in the area i would come back, but from what my local friends say its a little expensive to make it your local hangout.",3.0

"Drat! I wanted to be the first to review. Nevertheless, St. Catherine is a solid spot on the burgeoning Washington Ave bar scene. They may still be figuring it out but so far straight-forward concept with a dozen interesting beers, full bar, sparse tables outlining the edges, low lights and candles and a hodge-podge of retro-cool jams. You know the drill, it's called a ""Brooklyn Bar.""Fortunately, so far, the bar hasn't become over-crowded and overly loud. What would make it stand out a little bit more would be something unique. It has that ""Brooklyn Bar"" vibe down pat and it does do it well, but where's the something to make it distinguished? Like signature drinks? themed beers? food? music-style? weekday night activities? Something that makes you say, Oh I've been there they have good X,Y, or Z. Maybe just being pure and simple will work out fine, we'll see. If St. Catherine stays mellow, I'll continue to check in on her.",4.0

"Was having a good time until the bill came.We were told on the first round that our tab was $8.00 - a bottle of Crispin and a draft - and that was the happy hour price that was going until 8PM on a Sunday.We continued to order, under that assumption.When the bill came it was higher than we anticipated, and the bartender told us that she made a mistake in the beginning that lead us to believe that bottles were a part of happy hour.It's like, c'mon.  Really?The macaroni and cheese was good.Honestly if it weren't for that error this could  have been a 4 star review.",2.0
"Stopped in here after doing some biking in Prospect Park.  Big fan of the buy one get one free cocktails at the bar.  (Please note, this is AT THE BAR ONLY)  We came for brunch.  My meal started off with a bloody mary and then I ordered the egg sandwich and my friend got huevos rancheros.  The egg sandwich was delicious!  I was a bit leery at first because it had speck (crispy prosciutto), but it was super delicious.  I added on a side order of the thick cut back, and it did not disappoint.  The food portions were great, not too much.  They take cards as well as cash.  The bartender was helpful with the menu and with the drink selection.  Plenty of water was given through out the meal and no one rushed us to get out.  Definitely a place I will come to again!",5.0
"Came here with my friends to watch the World Cup.  Food and ambiance were ideal.  the chef is really sweet and accommodating,  it was a pleasure interacting with him regarding my food order .  I felt that my dish was prepared with love and it certainly tasted amazing.  (I talked directly with the chef because I places a special request, but the server was great as well.)",5.0
"We enjoyed our Saturday night here.The Good: -The huge windows are nice. -Whoever was in charge of the turntable handled it pretty well. -There was no crowd--a plus if you're like me and into boring nights out. The Not-so-Good:-The bar tender, while nice enough, took a long time to acknowledge me--""me"" being one of only a half-dozen patrons being waited on by two tenders. -Then, *he served me a shaken Old Fashioned and asked if I wanted a cherry in it. Those of you who know and appreciate what an Old Fashioned is may want to skip cocktail menu. *In fairness, my friend ordered an Old Fashioned from the other tender who seemed to know how to make one.",3.0
"World Cup + artichoke dip + happy hour?! Yes, please! This is a great bar and my only regret in writing this review is that it's going to be crowded from now on. The music is good and the scene is low key but not divey.",5.0

"One of my favorite bars in the area! I've been going to trivia Tuesdays with a group of friends every week and it's always a lot of fun, plus happy hour starts again right after the game and it doesn't get much better than that.  Try the mac and cheese!",5.0
"Drat! I wanted to be the first to review. Nevertheless, St. Catherine is a solid spot on the burgeoning Washington Ave bar scene. They may still be figuring it out but so far straight-forward concept with a dozen interesting beers, full bar, sparse tables outlining the edges, low lights and candles and a hodge-podge of retro-cool jams. You know the drill, it's called a ""Brooklyn Bar.""Fortunately, so far, the bar hasn't become over-crowded and overly loud. What would make it stand out a little bit more would be something unique. It has that ""Brooklyn Bar"" vibe down pat and it does do it well, but where's the something to make it distinguished? Like signature drinks? themed beers? food? music-style? weekday night activities? Something that makes you say, Oh I've been there they have good X,Y, or Z. Maybe just being pure and simple will work out fine, we'll see. If St. Catherine stays mellow, I'll continue to check in on her.",4.0

"Great selection of craft beers on tap and rotates so we would always be pleasantly surprised. They have a few hard to find offerings of whiskeys, like FEW, 287.The staff is friendly and bartenders know their stuff.Gets tough to get second or third rounds when the place gets packed. Tipping well on the first round helps this process on busy nights.The menu has enough treats so you wont have to wander out when you want a snack or a quick bite. Coffee is awesome and so is their egg sandwich for brunch.If youre lucky, you might even get to meet Brad, one of the owners, knows every beer on tap, friendly and relaxed. JayZ and Beyonce would agree, if they knew him.",4.0
This place I would recommend in a heart beat. The bartenders are very friendly and personable the food is amazing all the time. And the atmosphere is very inviting. They will soon have outdoor space available. But I  can't say enough about this place.,5.0
"Man, i would give the Saint Catherine 5 stars, but i know it would just be a personal bias--it's one short block away from my apartment on of Dean st. I can *almost* see my apartment from inside. And the warm inviting open windows of this new establishment are a very VERY welcome addition to a corner that had a windowless church/event hall, a liquor store, a barber shop, and nothing for as long as i've lived here. A chill bar serving food late into the night that i can walk to from my apartment in under a minute? YES PLEASE.But objectively, this place still deserves a solid 4 stars, I'd say. I had high hopes for the Saint Catherine when the space was clearly being renovated  a few months back. I was hoping it wouldn't just be another coffee shop (got enough of those) or just another bar (i love the Bearded Lady, but i feel like Minor Arcana and the Waystation leave PLENTY to be desired), and was thrilled when A) i discovered they'd have a decent all-day menu of real food! and B) the renovation ended up being not too hip, not to divey, but just right.The drinks are great and varied, but i barely care about that; there are so many bars--what i care about is the food. I've been there late at night before, but i also swung by a few weeks back for breakfast/brunch on a saturday around noon. I had a pretty delicious no-frills breakfast--two eggs, challah toast, a delicious side salad, and some strange thin prosciutto-like bacon called ""spec."" I also had a damn decent cup of Intelligensia coffee (no espresso machine though, only drip!). It was so good i eagerly look forward to coming for a late night dinner on a weekday (I get home from work fairly late so the fact their little kitchen is open until midnight is a boon).The space itself is so, so relaxed. It's a quiet corner of Washington to begin with, but the Saint Catherine is blessed with a nice open corner spot--there's no awkward shimmying between narrow spaces; not even a little bit. It's actually quite BIG by bar standards in this neighborhood! The decor is pseudo-rustic but in the most subtle way--lots of dark wood, plastered walls, etc. There's a door in the back that strongly suggests a backyard space will arrive sometime in the future...i sincerely hope so because that could well upgrade it to a 5 star neighborhood spot.",4.0
"St. Catherine is the least common denominator of Brooklyn, beers, wood veneers, and vegetables. As a cafe/bar, it hits all the notes, but it doesn't thrill. If I didn't have several intriguing alternatives on Washington Avenue, I would be grateful for St. Catherine's presence, but at this point in the avenue's gentrification, I don't really need it. I also have one snotty gripe that I will then atone for with a compliment. First:The bartenders don't know their beers. The last time I was here, I ordered a beer, and the admittedly kind and friendly bartender responded, ""Are you sure we carry it?"" Yes. It's on your menu. ""What does the label look like?"" I...don't know? ""I'm such a girl; I can only remember the beers with the pretty labels."" OK, I think I am a little offended now. But then: some friends brought their 9-month-old and said St. Catherine's might be the most baby-friendly bar in the neighborhood. Something about the bar being mostly empty, and a thoughtful server bringing out some cut-up white bread for the baby, which I guess is what babies eat.
