"AwesomeHonestly, by far, the best bar in Brooklyn.  I know it is personal taste, but a dark bar that plays metal music and serves a 6 dollar beer and shot combo.  Strangely, the food is even very high quality.  They have all of the bases covered.  Velour paintings on the wall, more metal music, affordable, and an awesome staff.  Tip: All drafts are 4 dollars during Happy Hour.   If I could live in this bar, I would.  It's that cool.  Thanks",5.0
"Outdoor seating - yesHomemade biscuits and gravy - yesCheesy cheeseburger - OMG yes Sexy staff - yesAlcohol in the mimosa - .....barelyI understand they're bottomless for a set price, but, after drinking SEVEN over brunch, I should feel buzzed or something. I drank so much orange juice, people started calling me Donald Duck. Not cool!!",4.0

"Came here to watch a Mets Playoffs Game with a friend.  Place is a bit divy, but the drinks are cheap, running between $4-6 dollars for beer on tap.Also got some fries which was a big portion.  The place is a bit out of the way from the train, but overall it was a good time.",3.0
"Dang, why have so few mentioned the pickles here? They make them on site, and where there are pickles, there are delightful pickleback shots! Cheap and delicious drinks, it's perfect and low-key.I've seen a few shows here and enjoyed it thoroughly. Great sound system and an intimate stage.",4.0
"#This bar rules. Love the #Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and #Chili-Lime Roasted Peanuts and the #velvet paintings.#But this time came for the #Burger and Beer Happy Hour special which is now $15. If you read the #Yelp reviews, it used to be cheaper. If it was $10-12, it would make sense. But at $15, it's not #something you'd come specifically to this #bar for.

"The ANCHORED INN which is a great punk bar, with awesome food, lots of good cheap beers on tap and a cool crowd on any given night when there isn't a big show.I love chilling at the Anchored.The Acheron however, gives me anxiety. Love the constantly solid lineups that always perform and props to DanO and crew for running a tight ship but the massive crowds in a small space gives this former extrovert now stricken with a bad case of social anxiety the heeby jeebies. Support Anchored Inn/Acheron, for better or for worse this is the spot for shows and they are keeping it alive in a part of town that's becoming rapidly hostile to anything not corporate.",4.0
"Great bar, great food, and it's a place where everyone knows your name.My wife and I are high school sweethearts and were some pretty hard heavy metalers in our time.

"I've been here a few times enough to tell you that while heavy metal bar by night, it's generally just a really cool, inconspicuous dive bar tucked away in the lesser known or less traveled parts of East Williamsburg, Brooklyn. During the day, it's very chill, and they have nice outdoor seating at front on a nice day. At night, it's happening, and they have a cool, fun crowd. It's probably one of the most diverse bars I've experienced, but I appreciate they make you feel comfortable enough in such an atmosphere, whether it's day or night. Though, it might not be for everyone, especially for those who choose to be more selective.The atmosphere is great, but it's not a huge bar per se. Velvet paintings adorn all the walls. There are tables to one side and their main bar with stools. The beer selection isn't so bad, and they have your common domestics available. Full bar also if you want to get your hard drinks on. Pricing is rather cheap to fair. For what seems like an establishment that may not serve food, surprisingly they do, and they do so till a very late hour. Have yet to try a lot of their food, but hands down, they serve some really awesome fries, namely the Carmen Fries with queso oaxaca, cheddar, bacon, and chipotle mayo ($11). This was an amazing set of fries to have at around midnight, post crazy drinking. Drunkenness did not skew the taste of these fries. They are absolutely worth trying when here. I love the fact they keep their kitchen open so late, and I believe kitchen closes at 1AM.All in all, very cool dive bar to check out if passing through these less traveled parts of Brooklyn. Go during the day, and expect a very laid back and chill atmosphere. At night, the crowds get heavy, and they blast heavy metal for heavy metal loving folks.",4.0

"I first discovered the Anchored Inn a couple of years ago when they had a happy hour beer and burger for $8.00.

I love all of the velvet paintings and it's off the beaten path location. My only complaint in the evening hours is the music is often too loud, and they have hardcore/metal shows next door adding to the volume and then the crowd spills in, and I'm too old for that sh*t.So I was a bit dubious about the atmosphere for brunch, but gave it a shot knowing with certainty the food would be good. And it was lovely! The usual crowds must have all been in bed nursing hangovers. No crowds whatsoever, easily commandeered one of the four empty tables outside, server was right there within seconds.

"Fried chicken cutlet on a house made buttermilk biscuit with honey buffalo sauce and buttermilk herb ranch.Those are the words that lured me to The Anchored Inn brunch today after having inspected the online menu. Last week while walking around the area I even spotted a sign that read ""Chicken Biscuit"" advertising brunch and an outdoor patio.We arrived today, primed and ready to order the chicken biscuit. Sure, I'd glance at other menu items from sheer intellectual curiosity alone and I took the dive environment in stride: I'd soon be having a chicken biscuit.Alas, we were too early as the biscuits were still being made. The responsible part of my mind appreciated the fact that these were homemade biscuits. The impulse driven hunger pang fighting glutton was severely disappointed and blurted out ""french toast!"".Not to curse the French and their toast, au contraire, but to order what to me seemed like a sloppy seconds, what with all the promise of buttermilk dreams and fried lust.I regrouped but fear my wife never did.So ignoring the disappointment of being too early for housemade biscuits, my french toast arrived in a paper serving apparatus that fries usually come in. Napkins? Try paper towels. Cutlery? Try plastic. Water? Self pour in the front. Add self pour coffee or tea and this would start to resemble a Holiday Inn Express. I tease, of course, but just be aware of these things before embarking on a brunch. It's a very egalitarian picnic feel that some may find too casual and others just right.As for me, I was too busy downing the french toast for the simple reason that it was drenched in a delicious dulce de leche sauce. I ordered a side of bacon that proved crispy, fatty foil to the soaking sweet bread. The presentation and plastic utensils reminded me of ordering from the Wafels and Dinges truck.The bathroom was like stepping into a pit of graffiti, which had me wonder about next time bringing a spray can of paint so I can leave my mark on the walls. I did appreciate seeing the name ""Edward Snowden"" scribbled on the wall.Hanging from the walls are fascinating paintings that range from Chairman Mao to fantasy wizards to Vladimir Putin. I could definitely see this as a place to drink and drink again. The absence of the the chicken biscuit was disappointing but I'd see this more as a place to have a main course of beer and side of brunch as opposed to brunch and a drink on the side. That's not meant as a criticism but rather where I see the Anchored Inn's strengths.The music was blasting out doo wop hits from the '50s, adding to the feel like I was in a roadhouse stop on a cross country trip somewhere in Kansas. Having been raised in the ethnic enclaves of northern NJ where this kind of music is a must at weddings, the early morning appearance of Dion DiMucci's ""Teenager in Love"" did test my aural patience.Still,a vastly better atmosphere and quality of eats than anything in my central Queens home turf.

"Needed to find a local place for an impromptu  business meeting.

Not a good way to impress a potential client.I was wrong. We arrived and although the bar was empty were enthusiastically greeted by the young lady at the bar who provided us with beer samples before taking our drink order. When our client arrived we moved to a table without any problem and ordered lunch and more beer. (a necessity - I must admit). We all ordered the Buffalo chicken sandwich and a round of beers. The meal arrived and was good, with just enough spice and burn to necessitate another beer to quench. We finished with another beer which was just as good as the first.Seriously, it was refreshing to find such an unobtrusive yet satisfying establishment in the middle of a warehouse district.

The Brussels sprouts were amazing and you can't go wrong with a bacon wrapped hot dog. Overall the food has been really well done, nicely seasoned, hot and fresh to order.

"Needed to find a local place for an impromptu  business meeting. Yelped some locations, this one came up.I was a bit hesitant - ""pub food / bar atmosphere.."" - I was concerned that if we met at opening time on a Friday (12 noon) we would be greeted with warm flat beer and improperly cooked lunch. Not a good way to impress a potential client.I was wrong. We arrived and although the bar was empty were enthusiastically greeted by the young lady at the bar who provided us with beer samples before taking our drink order. When our client arrived we moved to a table without any problem and ordered lunch and more beer. (a necessity - I must admit). We all ordered the Buffalo chicken sandwich and a round of beers. The meal arrived and was good, with just enough spice and burn to necessitate another beer to quench. We finished with another beer which was just as good as the first.Seriously, it was refreshing to find such an unobtrusive yet satisfying establishment in the middle of a warehouse district. My kudos to the owners. I recommend The Anchored Inn, and will certainly recommend and return.",4.0
"Good food and drink, but if you're not metal or covered head to toe in tattoos, expect to be treated like second class patrons and scowled at by the staff. Table service is better than it used to be, but generally bartenders can't be bothered to interrupt their conversation to pour you a beer (not counting the bartender on Sunday afternoon, she's great). Food is overpriced ($8 for an ""egg benedict,"" not eggs, egg), but tasty. Definite plus is the collection of dictator portraits, and random tchotchkies all over the place.",3.0

"Been to this place a few times due to my proximity to it, and each time it really struck me as a solid establishment with great drinks, food, decor, and atmosphere.  Some have described this as a metal bar, and given it's next door neighbor, The Archeron, it's an easy generalization to make.  I would say its more along the lines of well though out dive-type bar with great food and a friendly neighborly feel.  If you do like metal, The Archeron seems to host gigs next door often and you can hang out at Anchored inn in between sets or before /after.  The metal bar connotation likely comes from the fact that lots of people hanging out at the Archeron strike the average yelper as quite effin metal, and they happen to be hanging here at Anchored as well.  I consistently found music selection to be relatively varied with more of a lean toward Hard Rock / Alternative styles, like Appetite era Guns and Roses, although i heard some chill Mogwai last time I was there.Currently in the summer, the outdoor scene is great and effectively doubles the capacity of the place.  That said, my one gripe with it is that I wish it had more indoor space given that you might very well want to come here for the food and it helps to sit down for eating purposes.  Speaking of, my favorite deal is the happy hour hamburger deal.  $13 gets you a tasty burger with fries combo along with your choice of draft beer.  Really makes for an ideal after work or pregame sorta spot to chow down and chill out.  Overall its a solid unpretentious spot with kitschy yet enjoyable maritime decor that can have a wide appeal for various tastes.  Its off the beaten path in such a way that keeps it from getting too crazy, but good enough to consistently attract a lively crowd.  Definitely get some food if you can, but also good if you just want to drink outside off of a not busy sidewalk.  Real cool spot overall, although I would take off .5 stars for lack of interior space if I could.  Still I have only enjoyed my time here and really can't say anything else negative about it.",5.0
"This place is so rad. after having a complete and total meltdown on the train, i made my way over to grab some rainy afternoon beers and a sammy.

We ordered the french fries with everything on them to share, my pal had the pulled porch sammy (it was the sammy of the day) and I got the vegetarian torta. IT WAS BANGING. We had toyed with the idea of getting the bacon wrapped hot dog (that everyone on yelp is raving about) but were quite satisfied with our meals. We continued to drink the Friday afternoon away while Mandy kept us company. I'll have to make it out here more often than when a bud is playing a show next door.",5.0

I thought it was like a joke or something. It wasnt bad, it was just so little.My coworkers got fried chicken sandwich with BBQ Chips that were way too salty.The only reason I give 2 stars is because it's on a cool block full of famous grafitti and you can sit outside and enjoy the scenery, it may be a cool place to go drinking, but I would stay away from the overpriced bad food though.",2.0
"The quintessential neighborhood bar for this part of Brooklyn.All the bartenders live around the area and are super accommodating. Sometimes the bar is a bit understaffed. In my book, this is all the more reason to tip well and be polite, because, like most locals in the area, they are trying their hardest to pursue a career in the arts while working another job.The drink selection is excellent: they rotate it out on a pretty regular basis, and can always boast 1-2 seasonal brews and at least one interesting, more specialized ale. They also have a good happy hour and good shot-and-beer specials. The cocktails, with names ranging from the Pearl Necklace to the Morning After Pill, are like their names: strong and unique.They also have growlers.The burgers--I can't stress this enough--are excellent. They are maybe the best bar burger I've had in New York. All the other food is good too, but if you are going to try one thing, get the burger: especially considering that during Happy Hour, you get a burger with fries and a beer for $12. A really good deal.As for the ambience: I love it, personally. The paintings on the walls are all from the personal collection of the owner's wife, and they have a full diving suit suspended from the ceiling. Heavy metal/loud music has been playing every time I go there. There's a venue that specializes in heavy metal bands right next door, so this choice makes sense. Personally, I like this about this place: I like knowing what to expect, and I like being able to unwind to music that's harder than the day I had.Overall, just an awesome place that locals love, and lacks all the pretense, but none of the quality, of other Brooklyn bars.",5.0

"There are velvet paintings of Putin, Mao, and Chavez in this bar, along with its just-kitchy-enough-not-to-be-annoying nautical theme. I looooove it. I love the salty atomsphere (Anchored Inn, duh), the metal/punk musical selections, the fairly inexpensive beer ($4 for Yeungling draught), and the patrons who, at least last night when I went to see an oi show, were cool music-scene people and not vapid hipsters. There was even a true metalhead, and I have seen about two real metalheads in Brooklyn since I've been here (and no the bartenders at St. Vitus don't count). Long hair, leather vest, and all, this man was helicoptering and air-guitaring. Now that's what I'm talking about. Anyway, the bartenders are pretty, lanky girls in motorhead shirts, so that doesn't hurt either. They were a bit slow with the service, but then, it was fairly busy - they were still really nice, though. Small but not cramped, this bar is everything I've been looking for and more. I loved the blue lights on the ceiling - I spent a good amount of time staring at those. Great atmosphere, affect, music, people... I think I should probably move to Bushwick. Oh and I forgot to mention, the Acheron is right next door - teeny, tiny, dark and adorable music venue not listed on Yelp, and I'm not about to list it either... this industrial corridor of Bushwick is relatively untouched by tourists and traffic in general, and along with others, I'm sure, I'd like to keep it this way.",5.0
"Place was amazing with black velvet paintings on the wall, and then there were other sculptures hung from the ceiling (ahem-scuba diving gear). There's also this great loft ladder in the back.

"I've never had a bad thing here.  In fact, everything has been quite exceptional.  This is an awesome dive bar tucked in a special little area.  Their carnitas tacos are very authentic (I've eaten tacos in Mexico, and they're comparable).  I've also eaten their burger (delicious, but super messyyyyyy mmmm) and the romaine salad is badass!  As a lover of brussels sprouts, they're also deliciously prepared here.  Tried their cookies and loved those too!  Great service and just overall great vibes here.  Happy that I have such a great place to drunk and grub within walking distance of my home.  :)",5.0
"Lunch specials here are the shit. Great beer selection. Great food. Great service. No complaints. The place keeps the music at a tolerable noise level, and has cute kitschy decor. It has a bunch of black velvet paintings plastering the walls. The bartenders are usually trendy and young, to go with the music and the patrons. Its basically your typically willliamsburg experience. Not a dancing-type place, but you won't get hit on creepily as often as you might in a bar that does have dancingDefinitely go with a lagunitas IPA and a bacon wrapped hotdog.",5.0

"There are velvet paintings of Putin, Mao, and Chavez in this bar, along with its just-kitchy-enough-not-to-be-annoying nautical theme. I looooove it. I love the salty atomsphere (Anchored Inn, duh), the metal/punk musical selections, the fairly inexpensive beer ($4 for Yeungling draught), and the patrons who, at least last night when I went to see an oi show, were cool music-scene people and not vapid hipsters. There was even a true metalhead, and I have seen about two real metalheads in Brooklyn since I've been here (and no the bartenders at St. Vitus don't count). Long hair, leather vest, and all, this man was helicoptering and air-guitaring. Now that's what I'm talking about. Anyway, the bartenders are pretty, lanky girls in motorhead shirts, so that doesn't hurt either. They were a bit slow with the service, but then, it was fairly busy - they were still really nice, though. Small but not cramped, this bar is everything I've been looking for and more. I loved the blue lights on the ceiling - I spent a good amount of time staring at those. Great atmosphere, affect, music, people... I think I should probably move to Bushwick. Oh and I forgot to mention, the Acheron is right next door - teeny, tiny, dark and adorable music venue not listed on Yelp, and I'm not about to list it either... this industrial corridor of Bushwick is relatively untouched by tourists and traffic in general, and along with others, I'm sure, I'd like to keep it this way.",5.0
"Place was amazing with black velvet paintings on the wall, and then there were other sculptures hung from the ceiling (ahem-scuba diving gear). There's also this great loft ladder in the back.

"i don't think i'm exactly what one would call an early adopter. maybe in some ways, but despite all my awesome cred, i am rarely the first one to try a new place.not true with the anchored inn.down the industrial side of meserole street, past a basement music store and some dark lofts, lays little waterbury street. and down waterbury street is the anchored inn.nautically themed, but not over the top, the bar was pleasantly hopping on an early saturday evening. a nice beer selection, but nothing to crazy along with a well stocked bar and interesting food-centric specials, can pretty much assure that i'll be back.the bartender told us that there will be pancakes there next week. who doesn't love pancakes?! i'm bringing my own syrup.",4.0
Good deals but SO FREAKING LOUD.  Im not a bitch and I enjoy loud music but damn dude.  and its all metal.  I live real close and was happy it opened but man its loud.  so loud it distorts and stresses their speakers.  DAMN!!,2.0
"first off- this place is LOUD. if you aren't into that you will have a bad time. the drink specials are GREAT, as are the drinks. the vibe is pretty neat with a lot of pictures all around the bar area. looked like there was an upstairs but i didn't investigate. they have ""pickle backs"" (a shot of pickle juice) and it's delicious. spicy, salty & refreshing!",4.0
"Had the pleasure of lunch at Anchored Inn while visiting my Daughter in Brooklyn this week.  She did not steer me wrong about the Burger here. OMG, Amazing!!!  Will definitely hit this place up again next trip.",5.0
"Great atmosphere,  bar staff is cool as hell and they just started serving food. Favorite spot in Bushwick by a longshot!",5.0
"This place is fantastic. It's not too far from my apartment, but truth be told it's in an a very industrial neighborhood so I was always a bit wary walking over there at night for a drink. My friends and I did finally stop in one night, though, and it's one of my new favorite spots. There is a wide variety of beers to chose from, both on draft and bottled, and the decor is hilariously awesome - velvet paintings, pictures, and specifically, one of a thoughtful looking Putin, gazing down on the bar's patrons. We ordered some food while we were there, too, and honestly, it was really, really good. I had the bacon wrapped hot dog, which came with a variety of sauces and a beer mustard - all delicious and gone within a few seconds of being placed in front of my face. My husband got the burger and fries - the burger was nice and pink, and the fries were crispy and crunchy. This place may look like a bit of a dive bar, but the friendly atmosphere and delicious food definitely prove it to be much more than that.",4.0

"Amazing location...  I mean it is smack dab in the middle of a warehouse district in East Williamsburg/Bushwick border.  Great black velvet paintings of Putin, Chavez, and Kim Jong Ill.  And a great $5 PBR and Whiskey shot special.",5.0
"friendly staff, cute kitch, lots of long beards, heavy metal, $3.00 PBRs, I can't say it was without charm, but the BURGER WAS DISGUSTING.  I asked for it well done and the bartender--friendly as can be--said ""it only comes one way.""  I asked what way was that?  He said they serve 2 thin patties stacked on top of each other.  He promised they were delicious, though.  I almost walked out but he looked SO sincere.  I thought, well, if they're thin patties they will probably be at least medium.  WRONG.  Fried on the outside, bloody and cold on the inside.  Really vile if you don't like that sort of thing.  I will say, though, the place was packed and everyone seemed to be having a good time so if you don't feel like drinking at home, it is a viable option.  Just eat first.",2.0
