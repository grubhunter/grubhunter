"Food: I really love this place. I have only been here for brunch, however, every meal I have had has been absolutely wonderful. If you're looking for a consistent neighborhood brunch spot, just come here because you will not be disappointed. My favorite is when they have the baked eggs on the menu with the ground beef. It comes with a tomatillo sauce and a biscuit and it is actually perfect (this is special and is not always available.) Aside from that I have had the grass fed burger, potato bowl, BLT, Mofongo and the breakfast sandwich (which are all very tasty) If you can handle a truly spicy margarita, go for it because they definitely have a kick!Service: Wait staff is always welcoming and nice. Pros: Consistent great food.Cons: Brunch waits can be long and there almost always a wait, however, they will take your number and text you when your table is ready so you can go to a local coffee shop and wait.",5.0
"I enjoy this little neighborhood spot! I've only discovered it a month ago and already been a few times (thanks to a crazy bus detour). What drew me to them?1) they were open for business right at 8:30 after I've dropped both kids to school2) I could sit down and enjoy an actual breakfast not a corner store baconeggandcheese that you eat and walk1st impression on 1st visit? This is a cute place. Ohh grabbing the window seat! Menu is small, but i like that. DEFINITELY GETTING THE POTATO BOWL...With An Egg!! And Avocado!!! Yassss!!Service....Very attentive. 1st visit I was the only one there so it was not that hard for me to have the servers undivided attention, times after I always make it right before the rush but never have to flag server down for anything Food....Yum!!!! Potato bowl=amazing. Looks small but you will be full (I mean it's a small skillet of potatoes!)Had the seasonal omelet with broccoli, mushrooms and tomatoes my last visit and it was really good. The omelet fillings did not disappoint. I will be a little sad when the bus route normalizes again because it will be a bit harder to get to. Until then I will be there after I drop my kids off to school having a delicious breakfast...will I get through the entire menu?? #goals",5.0
"What a cute, little place. The only downside of it was the wait. Probably was one of the longest 45 minutes we had to wait because we came here starving. Even on an empty stomach, I was unable to finish my potato bowl with fried egg and bacon. I'm not the type to take home leftovers, but the potatoes the next morning made me do the happy dance.My honey latte was also a nice finish.",5.0
"ugh wtf Brooklyn.......you are so trendy it makes me want to make fun of you. But this shit is good. DamYou know the story my work takes me to XXX neighborhood I take to my yelp app to see whats sexy and then I roll in for lunch. Yet another great meal in Bushwick. Amazing service. Food, coffee all great. I do not know anyone in Brooklyn but the food makes me legit want to move there.",5.0
"Totally worth the 1/2hr waiting. Party of 4, came for brunch on a Saturday, and left very satisfied with the prompt service and well executed food. We had the steak and eggs, ranchero benedict, mofongo, grass-fed burger, and hot white and dark brownies. The steak perfectly medium, and the bacon and huancaina sauce, definitely a nice finish to the dish. The staff were very kind and friendly, and kept us hydrated with water and coffee at all the time. Highly recommended and definitely coming back!",5.0
"Oh, warm Eggs Benedict get in my belly. On my first full day in New York, as I hunted for an apartment in 15 degree weather, I happened to find Cafe Ghia nearby a place I was checking out. What looks like any old place from the outside, I checked my trusty yelp guide on what Cafe Ghia had to offer.Breakfast, at 3pm? Why not! As I stepped in, greeted by a full bottle of water, the warm air, and a kind waitress/bartender, I felt at so much ease. Being new to the city, it's hard when you're alone but this was a great spot to grab a quick bite to eat by yourself and be at peace. The Benedict was spectacular. It just warmed up my soul and gave me nourishment for the rest of the day as I roamed around Bushwick and Williamsburg. I'd definitely come back...while maybe I won't have the chance now that I'm working full time and the weekends may be a bit more crowded - it's worth it.",4.0
"Food: 5Drink (Cappuccino): 5Service: 5Cleanliness: 5Atmosphere: CozyIf I could take the cooks home with me, back to California, I would. There is one thing my brother is good at, and it's finding amazing places to dine that honor the gluten free food concept with style and allure. (By the way, my brother has had an allergy to gluten since he was a little one, before the trend.) So... for all you celiacs out there (or wannabes monitoring your gluten intake), this is a great spot for breakfast along with a couple lunch choices as well. You may experience a very tight fit if you're any larger than a party of six while dining here. The space is small (at least for what I'm used to), but the seating is spaced out comfortably, making the size almost unnoticed once you're inside. Once my mother and I had their incredibly potent almond milk lattes, my love for Cafe Ghia began. Kind of an ongoing theme... the latte was small, maybe even only 8 ounces, but after a few sips my eyes perked open a bit. The best choice, according to the local (my bro), is the Rancheros Benedict which is indeed, gluten free. Two poached eggs atop two grilled corn cakes, avocado, sauce and a side of greens. ""Good morning tastebuds!""  The proportion was perfect for me, but the two egg breakfast was huge, my dad could only finish half. It could potentially be enough to split with another person if you're a senior citizen like him...or just have a small appetite. Cafe Ghia, doesn't look too fancy on the outside, but inside is very clean and makes you want to keep coming back for breakfast again and again.",5.0
"Must try the eggs Benedict. They use corn griddle cakes which taste slightly sweet, which are made with corn meal, you must eat this with their thick cut bacon which lays on the griddle cakes and then they lay the poached eggs on the top with a sauce and tomato salad on top. Their salad is amazing. It has sesame seeds and a yummy vinaigrette. Must try their honey coffee latte. I asked for extra honey though. The cafe is small though and their is a wait time. They take your name and number.Overall id highly recommend this cafe its very hip.",5.0
Tucked under an antiquated sign bearing a remnant of Bushwick's historically Puerto Rican neighborhood is Café Ghia - a quirky yet cozy neighborhood café established in 2011 and owned by Bushwick locals (who also own the next-door coffee shop - The Wyckoff Star). A few friends and I wandered here on a 10:00AM Saturday morning and were seated immediately at the bar.  We ordered the: Seasonal Omelette with Cheddar CheeseBiscuits with Bacon and Mushroom GravySteak & Eggs (the best dish)Our dishes were both tasty and aesthetically pleasing and the staff were extremely welcoming and attentive. We received our food within 15 minutes and the portions were just right. Really can't think of any complaints!,5.0
"Not one little complaint about Cafe Ghia. I've been here twice, and both times were pleasant experiences. I tell myself that I moved to Brooklyn to be able to take my pick of amazing places like this one! The last time I was here I had the ranchero Benedict with bacon and I forgot what my husband had because I was mesmerized by the ranchero!!!! Instead of regular hollandaise sauce for the Benedict, a sauce is made with feta and ummm... I dream about it! Also, instead of the classic English muffin a corn cake is used  and its adds the perfect sweet balance to the savory sauce . Needless to say I finished my whole entire plate out of want not need . This place is also located in a nice neighborhood for walking. There's a handful of graffiti walls and outdoor sculptures that I'm sure will increase your insta/snap popularity.",5.0
"I was really looking forward to my meal here, but the experience was subpar. I ordered the steak and eggs (minus egg), with a side of dressed greens, and a Belgian waffle. I asked for my steak to be done medium, but it came to the table well-done, which I wasn't too enthused about. The steak itself didn't have much flavor.. The little flavor it did have, had an off taste to it that I just couldn't place. The sauce that came with the steak had a nice texture, but was also on the bland side, as far as taste goes. On the upside, the steak was very juicy, which I did enjoy. The potatoes were lovely, and my favorite part of the plate. I also really found the dressed greens to be quite tasty. As a last note, I would definitely recommend the Belgian waffle! The fruit they add on top is sweet enough that no syrup is needed, and the homemade whipped cream is heavenly. All in all, the cafe had a nice atmosphere, and the menu had some lovely sounding items, but the main courses just weren't a hit.",3.0
Neighborhood gem! Haven't made it to Cafe Ghia until recently but it is a local gem. Food is delicious! I got the stacked waffles with eggs and bacon and my husband got the vegan tofu scramble. Both tasted delicious. We went when it was 9:30am so seating was ample despite the cozy spacing. We saw kids with family there too so very nice neighborhood vibe. Will definitely be coming back!,5.0
"Came here with the boyfriend for Saturday brunch - The wait was 30 mins but we ended up being seated in about 45 (only cons) the place is small so I guess I understandOrdered the honey latte and eggs Benedict - the latte was very good, sweet, but not too overbearing. The eggs had a small spice kick to it which made it perfect! My bf ordered the burger - have to say that the grass fed beef they use is amazing!!! The burger was very good I would def recommend it",4.0
"The food is good, but it's grossly overpriced for really small portions. I get that the U.S. of A. has issues with portion sizes, but it is just frustrating for the amount of money you're shelling out for this stuff. I also felt judged for being squaresville in a sea of hip staff with cooler-than-you glasses and clothes. There is a possibility this was me projecting.",3.0
"Came here before walking to knockdown center for the surrounded forest exhibit. Friend found this place on Yelp and wanted to give it a try. Location is about 5 minutes away from the L train. Friend ordered the ranchero egg Benedict, didn't like the cornbread which was used instead of the biscuit, broke off easily. I ordered the steak and eggs, simple and to make but slice of steak was a little small for such a simple dish. Another friend decided to try the baked eggs and biscuit which was not on the regular menu, it's on the chalkboard located behind the bar. There was a piece of white plastic inside the biscuit, be careful when eating here! Also the chairs have splinters which are very sharp so be careful when you sit.",1.0
"Idek if I can leave a review because I literally get the same thing over and over again....oh, what the hell! Carry on...That's what makes it good.

The mimosas are served in such a huge glass, the service is always exceptional, and the food is consistently good. There can be a wait though, but trust me when I say it's well worth it.Speaking of waiting, being that I have some restaurant experience, I love when waiters/waitresses can turn a table quickly. It's something I look out for. When you know you're always crowded that's very important with customer service.

"Fantastic steak and eggs! Hanger steaks are incredibly difficult to cook, but Ghia somehow does it right. Probably the best I've ever had. Pro Tip: go for the MegaMosa. It's a pint of mimosa and they're acceptably strong. You really cannot go wrong here.",5.0
"My husband and I made a special trip through Bushwick to Cafe Ghia to grab breakfast on our way into the City. We read an article about their breakfast sandwich and we had to give it a try!

We both had the Breakfast Sandwich (scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, on a brioche bun and added cheese). The sandwiches came with seasoned potatoes, as well. They. Were. Delicious! I couldn't finish mine because it was so big, but my husband quickly jumped in to volunteer. If we lived in the area, we'd be back to try the potato bowl or burger!",5.0
"This cafe is literally in the middle of nowhere, and there was still a 20 minutes wait to get inside. That said something right off the bat. The interior was cute but very cramped. I think I almost sat in my neighboring brunch fellow's dish as I slide by to get into my seat. What really pushed this restaurant up to 4 stars was the food. I had the potato bowl with all the toppings (around $11) which I still dream about, and my sister for the brioche egg sandwich (about $13). Neither of us were expecting how large our platters were. We could have easily split one between us. I had a bloody mary which was nice and spicy and my sister had an irish coffee which wasn't even on the menu. She said the irish coffee didn't taste like it had too much liquor in it. I am looking forward to finding an excuse to be in Brooklyn one weekend to heard back.

Thank you.Bloody Mary was.. Okay. I drank it all (of course) but it was nothing to write home about. Garnish was a mini carrot, olive and a 2 inch of celery. Meh.Benedict was.. Phenomenal. The base, rather than a muffin or biscuit, was a thin corn tortilla husk thing that is kind of hard to describe but completely delicious. The potatoes were doused in rosemary which I LOVE.

I had the Rancheros Benedict which is a hybrid of Huevos Rancheros and Eggs Benedict and I really enjoyed it. The corn griddlecakes were so good, and I loved the pico de gallo on top. I had a side of herb roasted potatoes that were really tasty as well.My boyfriend had a burger and he really enjoyed it. It looked really good. He also had the white chocolate house made ice cream that he really liked. Even now, several hours after we had brunch he is still talking about how good the burger was. My friend had the green plaintains with a sausage patty. She really liked hers too. My friend and I had the raspberry ice cream that we both enjoyed. Overall, we had a really good experience at Cafe Ghia. There was a 45 minute wait quoted when we arrived but it ended up being maybe 30 minutes and it was a nice day so we didn't mind waiting outside. I would definitely go back. I really appreciate that they have so many vegetarian and vegan options, and the fact that they have the flexibility to make dishes with bacon/meats in it into a vegetarian friendly version. I really would like it if they made a meat free version of the brioche egg sandwich!!",4.0
I've been coming here for a couple years and their service and food has never let me down. My personal favorite is the breakfast brioche. The bacon is thick and yummy. Would recommend adding cheese. The spot is small but that just makes it cozy. No turnover in the waitstaff so I'm the assuming they're taken care of. Love it,5.0

"We just tried this place and it is GREAT! A cozy little place simply perfect for brunch. The food was flavourful and well-seasoned. Between two people we had the Belgian Waffle, Steak & Eggs and the potato bowl with a side of home-made sausage patty (and this really seems to be home-made, not a type of seasoning one could buy from a supermarket, at least not that I've seen). The portion sizes would fit Goldilocks; not too big, not too small, just about right.The staff is friendly and attentive. When they say bottomless coffee, they mean bottomless coffee! I never had to ask them for refills, they were on point! On Sundays, try to get to the place before 10:30 am. That's when it starts getting crowded. If you arrive before that, there's almost no need to stand waiting. We got there around 10:00 am and were immediately seated. The place is extremely small, at most would seat 30. So if you are one that likes a little bit more space to keep your plates and drinks, I suggest sitting at the bar. Between me and my girlfriend, we'd give Cafe Ghia a 4.5....",5.0
"LOVE this spot for brunch! They have so many delicious and interesting vegan options, remarkable cocktails, and lovely staff and atmosphere. I have tried the vegan mofongo, which is a potato based brunch dish with veggie bacon and sausage, topped with avocado. The flavors and texture were so nicely balanced and the portion was really hearty for just $12. My Bloody Mary was the most delicious I have ever tasted, and I have had many in my lifetime!

Our dishes came out quickly and we were very impressed. My potatoe skillet was amazing with the potatoes being roasted to perfection and some of the tastiest bacon I've ever had. My girlfriend's egg benedict was also scrumptious. It had a spicy kick as well which made the dish really stand out. The only negative was the bees knees honey latte was a bit lackluster but it was a very minor shortfall compared to the overall experience. Definitely would recommend this restaurant, and well worth a second visit.",5.0
"""How's your Bloody Mary?,"" my friend asked. ""Tastes like tomato juice and vodka."" Now, tomato juice and vodka isn't undrinkable, but a Bloody Mary it's not.As for the food? Not sure why I paid $15 for a tiny, dry in spite of being reasonably medium-rare burger. I guess the side roasted potatoes were tasty, but again, not many of them. My friend's mac 'n' cheese was sad, sad, sad looking.Oh, and they gave me a dirty glass twice(!) at the start. Staff was pleasant and attentive otherwise, though.",2.0

"I was not a brunch person. I don't like going out in Williamsburg with my 15 closest hung over friends and cramming into a loud crowded place so that I can pay inflated prices for eggs.

"Hooray for brunch! I highly recommend coming on a weekday for a late breakfast. There will likely be no wait for a table and the service is speedy if you're trying to get-in and get-out. Brought the 'rents here after discovering the neighborhood Vietnamese spot is closed on Mondays. Happy hour starts at 3:00 on weekdays. There's a special for a beer and a burger (veg or carnivorous) for $15. Considering the veggie burger is $13.00 or so that's a pretty good deal. I've had the vegan burger before and was definitely pleased with it. The sprouts on top were a welcome addition. My mum has ordered the BLT Panino and grass-fed burger and had no complaints for either. One thing I appreciate: Vegan/vegetarian options are plentiful. Daily specials have always been interesting and tasty (They've got gazpacho on the menu right now!) I've had the Ranchero Benedict which is one of my favourite brunch options in the neighborhood and it's a really attractive dish.

"Mmm, I love a good brunch and this place delivered.  It was nice to walk in just after they opened and not have to wait too long.  After 12:00 PM though, this place fills up.  They have great service and a nice brunch menu.  Definitely a nice spot to hit up for some good Brooklyn brunch on the weekend.",4.0
Love this place!It's small and the wait is kind of long.  But the breakfast/ brunch is DELICIOUS.  I got the Egg Benedict dish with the corn griddle cakes and it came out cold.  But I ate it anyway because it still tasted amazing.I told the waitress about the temperature and she comped the dish - even though I ate all of it!  So I wasn't expecting that.  Overall I will be going back and trying the Vegan Scramble!  People say it's amazing.,4.0
"Yum! We waited a good 30 minues for a table. Understandable because it's Sunday, and everyone knows that the wait for brunch on a Sunday is going to be ridiculous wherever you go.It was my first time at Ghia's, and I can honestly say that I am eager to go back and try some more stuff. I try very hard to follow the paleo diet, so I was really happy to see that most menu items were actually sorta paleo friendly. Obviously I'm not going to interrogate the restaurant about what kinds of oil they use to cook, but many brunch items didn't have grains so yay!!!I had the potato skillet and added everything except tomato chutney. SO good!!! They forgot to add avocados, so I am going to have to dock a star for that. Otherwise, I thought the prices were really reasonable for the quality of food. They have grass fed meat, and I believe they use local ingredients as well.",4.0
"I've only been here once, but I wasn't super impressed by their breakfast/brunch options. If I come again, which is likely, it'll mostly be because I live a block away. And the place is cute and has good service. I had the Ranchero Benedict while my friend got the Mofongo. The mofongo is definitely the star of the show. I had a bite, and it was so, so delicious. Even that one forkful was bursting with flavor and texture. The Ranchero Benedict was great in concept, but I felt it was lacking a certain draw. It didn't really have me coming back for more. As a twist on Eggs Benedict, it's got two poached eggs (perfectly done) on griddle cakes (which look like cornmeal pancakes?). I wished there was more of the sauce on the dish, because that alone was pretty delicious, but the griddle cakes needed seasoning. A really basic side salad is served with the Benedict, but it wasn't adding much excitement to the dish. We also each got a coffee and paid about $21 each including tax + tip. Our service was good however, and our waiter checked in on us regularly to make sure everything was going well. The wait for the food was as expected as well. For $20, I would have appreciated a better executed, more flavorful dish.",3.0
Food was okay but I put 1 star because one of the server Caitlyn or however u spell was REALLY RUDE! I asked for some napkin and she told me to get some from the bathroom aka toilet paper!! -.- I hope a manager from this restaurant see this review because she is running your customers away. I will NOT be coming back here. Your job is to provide us with excellent service where we would want to come back and recommend others but nope! Not gonna happen. remember her name CAITLYN. can anybody relate to me?,1.0
"Disappointing. Service: decentPrice: standard (~$10)Food: sub-standard I was excited to try this place based on their menu descriptions.  Ordered the tofu scramble.  What I received was half of a plate of cold tofu in what appeared to be a dollop of vegan chili..... I'm really not sure this place grasps what a ""scramble"" is.  I can tell you it is not tomato paste, soggy sweet potatoes and cold slimy tofu. First and last visit here. This is the first time",2.0
Great boozy brunch spot. We got the breakfast brioche and the ranchero Benedict which was delicious and the perfect portion. The breakfast brioche was basically bacon egg and cheese served with potatoes. The ranchero Benedict came with a side of salad. The service wasn't too great but would come back for the food and the mega mimosas.,4.0
"I've been here before and I really enjoy this place but the last time I came I had a stroller . I told the waiter that the baby was sleeping so we couldn't take her out . Can I just say her response was just rude . A simple ""you can leave the stroller by the door "" and when I told her I can't she said ""I don't know what to tell you "" ?? Umm okay .. We left and went somewhere else . I wouldn't have been mad if she didn't have a table right away . But she could have at least given me a wait time instead of that nasty response . It sucks cus I really like the food here .. I had the bacon mofongo and it was delicious .also who can pass up a mega mimosa ? Yum . I can't knock the business though it's a cool place in the neighborhood . That server should fix her responses to people . There is a certain way of saying things",2.0
"One of the very few locations that serve Brunch Everyday. You can avoid the crazy wait and enjoy a peaceful brunch any day of the week when you have some extra time. This cafe is located in an odd spot, not much else going on in the surronding area but people still line up for the food here so it must be good right? Came here on my day off  and were one of the only people ready to grub on weekday brunch. No complaints here! We had our choice of seats and sat quickly down.I opted for the potato bowl with fried egg and avocado. All the toppings are two dollars each and they have many options. The bowl was super filling and very cheesy which ofcourse i love. The potatoes were also piping hot and i burnt the roof of my mouth because i was over eager to eat! What else is new?My person got the steak and eggs which he enjoyed but the portion was really small, he ate his meal in record time.Still kicking myself that i didnt try the waffles or mofongo but that just gives me an excuse to come back.On the black board we also noticed that they had ""Chocolate Mexican cookies (vegan)"" . We tried these and they were so so good and pretty spicy. Totally inspired me to make my own!Overall i like Cafe Ghia but as much as i liked it, i might not go out of my way to go again. I wish the place was in a better location!",4.0

They have grass fed meat, and I believe they use local ingredients as well.",4.0
"I've only been here once, but I wasn't super impressed by their breakfast/brunch options. If I come again, which is likely, it'll mostly be because I live a block away. And the place is cute and has good service. I had the Ranchero Benedict while my friend got the Mofongo. The mofongo is definitely the star of the show. I had a bite, and it was so, so delicious. Even that one forkful was bursting with flavor and texture. The Ranchero Benedict was great in concept, but I felt it was lacking a certain draw. It didn't really have me coming back for more. As a twist on Eggs Benedict, it's got two poached eggs (perfectly done) on griddle cakes (which look like cornmeal pancakes?). I wished there was more of the sauce on the dish, because that alone was pretty delicious, but the griddle cakes needed seasoning. A really basic side salad is served with the Benedict, but it wasn't adding much excitement to the dish. We also each got a coffee and paid about $21 each including tax + tip. Our service was good however, and our waiter checked in on us regularly to make sure everything was going well. The wait for the food was as expected as well. For $20, I would have appreciated a better executed, more flavorful dish.",3.0
Food was okay but I put 1 star because one of the server Caitlyn or however u spell was REALLY RUDE! I asked for some napkin and she told me to get some from the bathroom aka toilet paper!! -.- I hope a manager from this restaurant see this review because she is running your customers away. I will NOT be coming back here. Your job is to provide us with excellent service where we would want to come back and recommend others but nope! Not gonna happen. remember her name CAITLYN. can anybody relate to me?,1.0
"Disappointing. Service: decentPrice: standard (~$10)Food: sub-standard I was excited to try this place based on their menu descriptions.  Ordered the tofu scramble.  What I received was half of a plate of cold tofu in what appeared to be a dollop of vegan chili..... I'm really not sure this place grasps what a ""scramble"" is.  I can tell you it is not tomato paste, soggy sweet potatoes and cold slimy tofu. First and last visit here. This is the first time",2.0
Great boozy brunch spot. We got the breakfast brioche and the ranchero Benedict which was delicious and the perfect portion. The breakfast brioche was basically bacon egg and cheese served with potatoes. The ranchero Benedict came with a side of salad. The service wasn't too great but would come back for the food and the mega mimosas.,4.0
"I've been here before and I really enjoy this place but the last time I came I had a stroller . I told the waiter that the baby was sleeping so we couldn't take her out . Can I just say her response was just rude . A simple ""you can leave the stroller by the door "" and when I told her I can't she said ""I don't know what to tell you "" ?? Umm okay .. We left and went somewhere else . I wouldn't have been mad if she didn't have a table right away . But she could have at least given me a wait time instead of that nasty response . It sucks cus I really like the food here .. I had the bacon mofongo and it was delicious .also who can pass up a mega mimosa ? Yum . I can't knock the business though it's a cool place in the neighborhood . That server should fix her responses to people . There is a certain way of saying things",2.0
"One of the very few locations that serve Brunch Everyday. You can avoid the crazy wait and enjoy a peaceful brunch any day of the week when you have some extra time. This cafe is located in an odd spot, not much else going on in the surronding area but people still line up for the food here so it must be good right? Came here on my day off  and were one of the only people ready to grub on weekday brunch. No complaints here! We had our choice of seats and sat quickly down.I opted for the potato bowl with fried egg and avocado. All the toppings are two dollars each and they have many options. The bowl was super filling and very cheesy which ofcourse i love. The potatoes were also piping hot and i burnt the roof of my mouth because i was over eager to eat! What else is new?My person got the steak and eggs which he enjoyed but the portion was really small, he ate his meal in record time.Still kicking myself that i didnt try the waffles or mofongo but that just gives me an excuse to come back.On the black board we also noticed that they had ""Chocolate Mexican cookies (vegan)"" . We tried these and they were so so good and pretty spicy. Totally inspired me to make my own!Overall i like Cafe Ghia but as much as i liked it, i might not go out of my way to go again. I wish the place was in a better location!",4.0

"Update:I'm going to have to take down a star for general food quality now that I've been a second time.  Honey iced latte is on point (as a latte) but a little lacking in honey flavor so if I head back next time, going to ask for extra honey.   The coffee itself is pretty good and does not taste watered down with the ice so it's just a matter of small personal tweaks to make it perfect. I've sampled two chilled summer soups of the day (strawberry cream, coconut and peach) and both tasted fresh and delicious.  I would totally recommend this as a starter in the $4 cup size or even as a desert for those of you who don't love sweets.  The soup is the sole reason why the rating gets a extra star along with really good service one time when they were out of whipped cream for the waffles and offered me a $2 discount with the check.  That said service was much better on a weekday lunch than on weekend brunch which is not uncommon.  Solo brunches and duos are typically relegated to the bar unfortunately and the three-stool bar at the window is also off limits.  I've had two mains here, the Belgian waffle and today I tried he house omelette.  The Belgian waffle was standard - tasty, filling but nothing special.  I was pretty disappointed with house omelette though.  It was a smaller omelette than usual for the price although that didn't really matter to me.  The omelette itself was very oily which I despise in omelette even though the duck prosciutto/leek/goat cheese mix tasted alright.  It came with wedges which were a bit limp and under flavored.  I don't know if I would visit again for a meal, but would still pop in for soup and a cuppa.",4.0

There were seven of us and the host told us they only accommodate groups of six so we would have to sit separately , but that she would do her best to accommodate us and put us near each other.  We were fine with that and just hoped that we got lucky with tables. The first half of us get called and seated a half hour later. After five minutes the whole row of tables beside them were empty so we were expecting for the four of us to be seated beside them. Instead, she seated a couple right beside them and asked us to sit at the bar. We asked if we could atleast sit at the remainder four tables close to our friends and she said no? She was extremely rude and unapologetic about it. Surely she could have been accommodating and put the two other couples that subsequently arrived at the bar and allowed us to sit near our friends? It genuinely seemed like she was actively trying to annoy us and be mean because it just didn't make sense why we would have to sit at the bar over the other customers who hadn't arrived yet. Anyway, that kind of ruined the atmosphere and got us off to a bad start but the food looked so delicious that we were determined to enjoy our brunch. Unfortunately it was only subpar. I got the breakfast sandwich with a side of Brussels sprouts. The scrambled eggs were absolutely delicious but everything else was below satisfactory. The bacon was just pure fat and the Brussels sprouts and the potatoes were undercooked.The bar tender who served us was very friendly and accommodating so it's not the service as a whole that was bad.

Anyway, that kind of ruined the atmosphere and got us off to a bad start but the food looked so delicious that we were determined to enjoy our brunch. Unfortunately it was only subpar. I got the breakfast sandwich with a side of Brussels sprouts. The scrambled eggs were absolutely delicious but everything else was below satisfactory. The bacon was just pure fat and the Brussels sprouts and the potatoes were undercooked.The bar tender who served us was very friendly and accommodating so it's not the service as a whole that was bad. Overall, I'd give the eggs another go, but not if I had to deal with that host again.",1.0

Came here for brunch with a friend on Sunday & was definitely glad that I did! I got the Ranchero Benedict with braised bacon and it was super yummy! Definitely a good choice. The cold brew coffee was also great. My friend had the BLT Panino which also looked really really delicious.

"I was SUPER excited to come here after scrolling through every single photo on yelp, but alas, was let down.So there was seven of us.

The wait was 45mins which again, was fine; they'd call us. While all this information was a-ok, the way it was delivered was not. We found the host extremely patronising and while seemingly 'nice', it was very superficial and rehearsed and she was slightly passive aggressive.The table of three was called and they were seated. Ten minutes later we were called and we were led to the bar. There were three tables beside each other free; next to our friends. A couple who were called after us were seated next to our friends and the other two left empty. We asked if we could move there and we were told there were other people waiting to which we said but we were waiting and called first etc etc. Apparently nothing could be done.The service at the bar was great, the woman behind it was so nice, so friendly and just generally a great server with a great attitude.My food however was disappointing. Eggs were perfect but the potatoes and Brussel sprouts were undercooked and a bit bland, the biscuit was the best I've had and the constant hot drops in my tea kept me happy.Over all, I would come back for sure to try it again at a less busy time where I could sit at a table so that I could actually talk to my friends. The hostess however; unfriendly and unaccommodating really soured everything and gave out bad bad vibes, so I will be trying my best to avoid her next time I walk in; I'm sure the star rating would then be significantly higher.",2.0

"Ghia is my friend. Less crowded at peak brunch hours and occasionally more delicious than other spots in the neighborhood (cough, Northeast, cough), the menu is excellent overall. Try the lumberjack stack if you're in the mood for decadence, try the vegan scramble if you're attracted by the whole fresh-healthy-flavorful paradox, try the ranchero benedict if you want the most flavorful benny to ever slide down your gullet, or try the breakfast sandwich if you want to be creamed in the fucking face (pleasurably). The giant mimosa is also good, albeit expensive, and there's always some craft on draft. I'm usually a seasonal omelette + bloody mary type of guy. You know the type, I'm really not in the mood to explain myself. The true, fundamental reason behind my good review, though, is the dick mirror in the bathroom (men only... sorry females. Maybe there's a female analogue that I don't know about). The restaurant is named after a certain model of Volkswagen called the Ghia, and the bathroom is plastered with ads for it. There's also a rearview mirror from a Ghia placed above the toilet in a position which allows you to behold your tired, shriveled chode as you piss out your 11 am buzz.

"Not bad. Good atmosphere (quite small, but cozy) but the prices are meh.  Bottomless coffee is pretty clutch though!

"I had a friend in town over the weekend and wanted to take her out to a nice brunch Sunday morning. Called Café Ghia to see if there was a wait and if I could make a reservation. The woman who answered the phone hung up on me the first time as soon as I got a few words out of my mouth. OK, I figured maybe it was a mistake. Called again and asked if I could make a reservation. The same woman answered the phone. Her response, and I quote, was ""We don't take reservations, and I have to let you go. We are really busy."" And then she hung up on me again. I don't care if you are busy. You don't hang up on a potential customer. In fact, don't bother answering the phone if you clearly have no customer service skills. As good as the food was when I went the first time, I most definitely will never attempt to go back to Café Ghia. We ended up going to The Bodega and having yummy food AND lovely service.",1.0

I love my meat, and I love my syrupy delicious treats. This dish hit the spot for me. Filled with sweet potatoes, tofu, kale, and more, this dish was just yummy!Service: Service was alright. Nothing spectacular, but not entirely disappointing either... Our server was not the friendliest, but she was ""somewhat"" efficient. The hostess however, (I believe she was a manager) was super friendly!Coffee: I have to make their Coffee it's own section, because it was just that good. I am normally NOT a coffee drinker, but this was just nice! You could tell that the coffee was fresh, and strong! Just like I like my men! ;-) The sugar that they use is also pretty cool!

It was close to the place we were staying, so we went with it.For those of you too lazy to read the following: Delicious food, great vegan options, awesome staff.

The space is on the small side, but they managed to fit plenty of folks in, and had a reliable seating system. I don't know if it helped that we weren't picky about where we sat, but they were prompt. This is something places in Toronto could maybe learn a thing or two from.Solid, bottomless cups of coffee. So good, I neglected to factor in that I'd be riding a bus from Manhattan to Newark with no bathroom stops along the way. I survived.The vegan scramble I had was worth writing on the internet about (hence why you are reading this). Great portion, flavourful, and decently priced.The decor is rad, too. Since you will inevitably wonder.But the real winner is the service. The servers working were all genuinely friendly and kind, even if it was pretty consistently busy. I hope they all go on to very successful careers in whatever the love, but also pass on their patience to future servers.Looking forward to stopping in next time I'm in Canada Sr.",4.0
"It's a shame that we are moving our office out of the area and that we only just found the deliciousness that is Café Ghia. We love the Big salads that they offer for lunch, they are full of awesome fresh goodies like strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries!  The dressing is yummy and you won't be disappointed by a large pile of iceberg because it comes with a nice blend of greens and beets!  Last but not least we don't mind the stroll over to pick up our food at the Café, they have such a great atmosphere.  The bartender is super friendly and just today while I was there waiting at the bar the chef was out of the kitchen taking pictures of a beautiful sorbet and ice cream that is being served as a special.  Well done Café Ghia!",5.0
"Love love love this place!I am not a breakfast person whatsoever but their breakfast is shit.

"I came to Cafe Ghia for brunch at about 12:30 on a rainy Sunday. Although we were quoted a wait of 20 minutes, we were only standing for five minutes or less when the host seated us at the bar. After much deliberation, I ended up ordering the Ranchero Benedict for $13 and added Braised Bacon on it for an extra $2 at the waitress's suggestion. As the menu describes, this meal consisted of poached eggs on corn griddle cakes with avocado and huancaina sauce, served with a side of greens. The bacon was added under the egg, above the bread, and I HIGHLY recommend adding the bacon. This was no thin, store-bought bacon. This was centimeter-thick, hearty bacon. The sauce was really flavorful, the presentation was nice, I was nicely full afterwards, overall a great brunch item.My friend ordered the Biscuits and Mushroom Gravy with a side of green beans for $10, which he then topped with two fried eggs. He was sick and congested so he couldn't taste much, but from the bite I had, I thought it was good.Overall a nice meal.

When I asked for butter I was told they had cinnamon butter, oh my goodness can someone please give an award to whoever thought of that? Before I ordered my food I didn't even know such a thing existed. The waffles were huge and fluffy, the scrambled eggs were delicious and the bacon was perfection, it was just the right amount of crunchy.

"I came in here off of a Bushwick Daily post claiming Cafe Ghia had the best burger. I've had Tutu's, and I've had Fritzl's (both ranked below Ghia's burger), and both have, in my opinion, been better. (As has Bizarre's, which wasn't ranked.) My gripe and low rating are more so with the customer service than with the extremely meh sandwich. I walked in, and there were about 5-6 other patrons; about 3-4 staff members. This was my first time at the restaurant, so, not knowing the protocol, I stood around and made eye contact multiple times with each of the staff members, waiting for some cue as to if I was supposed to seat myself, or what. I eventually just sat down in the middle of the place, and the waitress continued her banal conversation about marrying a foreigner or something as if I wasn't even there. This soured my experience before I tasted anything, unfortunately, but good food can, in my mind, always make up for a poor customer experience. This food didn't. I'm not sure if I went at a bad time, if the staff were collectively (servers, kitchen) having a bad day, or what. I'd love nothing more than to love this neighborhood spot, which so many seem too.

I wanted to come here twice before submitting a review. The waiters and waitress are very nice and on point. Both visits I came for brunch on a weekday. It wasn't crowded so food came quickly. The first visited I had Vegan scrambled made with cale very tastey to be meatless. Second visit I had an Cinnamon Apple Maple waffle and Tofu scrambled with potatoes. Again food was delicious they substituted the eggs for Tofu for me in the scrambled which is a special. Thanks to previous reviews I tried the coffee which they give free refills. I will continue to come here the food is good with healthy ingredients. They state on menu they purchase from local farmers market and are selective with meat purchases.

Miss the pulled pork sandwich.,4.0
"Incredible and I mean incredible vegan burger. Incredibly fresh made on the spot. They offered vegan and straight carnivore bacon options, fascinating. Great selection of local beers. They were absolutely accommodating in swapping around tables so we could fit our whole party in their tiny space. Their portions however tend to be on the smaller side, relatively speaking.",5.0
"I had a really wonderful brunch experience here the other day. We had a 30 minute wait but that is expected on a Sat/Sun in Brooklyn. The really nice hostess took my phone number and said she'd call as soon as a table opened up. Sure enough, 30 min later, we were in. Sat at a table against the wall among the late risers of Bushwick. There's a good vibe inside, kind of retro, kind of diner-y, kind of Brooklyn, ya know. All the waitresses that tended to us were very friendly and nice despite being so busy. We both got bloody marys which are HIGHLY recommended!! Very nice bloody. I ordered the poached eggs on corn griddle cakes.. and MY GOD, one of the best brunch meals I've ever had. The braised bacon, avocado, and spicy sauce were perfection. I will definitely be going back to Ghia when in Bushwick on a lazy weekend day.",5.0
"I come here for weekday brunch and wifi when necessary. I use to love coming to this place before they deconstructed the menu to charge for every.single.ingredient. The vegan scramble is my favorite...or at least, it was before they removed the tofu cream and jalapeño for an additional $1 each to add. Also, I'm gluten free so I could substitute the bread for the potatoes, which they also started charging $2 for. So voila! A $15 vegan scramble. The omelets are a similar case, with goat cheese being an additional $3. Nonetheless, I've typically enjoyed the food. I've had friends order other items and been wildly displeased with the heavier menu items. Meh. Another place that's definitely taken a fall since Bushwick has become popular. Seems like several restaurants in the area are cutting corners and trying to profit from the crowds. For the regulars, its just more annoying. I went from coming here about once a week to about once every 2 months.",3.0

"Loved, loved, loved my Sunday brunch. I Only had to wait about 20 minutes and we were seated up at the bar which was great. We got to chat with the friendly bartender Stacy.

"Hands down, the BEST brunch I've had in Brooklyn (and even NYC, for that matter). The food is spectacular. Even better is the service. I've been there about 7x in the entire year I've lived in Bushwick.

This past Sunday, I ended up getting the Biscuits with Bacon and Mushroom Gravy. It's GOOD! My friend got the Lumberjack Stack. They don't skimp out on the waffle either. It's pretty big. I always sit at the bar when I go. Stacy (I believe is her name?) is such a delight as your bartender during Sunday brunch. She's friendly, nice, and always doing what she can to enhance the quality experience at Café Ghia. For example, our food took a bit longer than expected (no complaints though because it's worth the wait!). As soon as we paid the bill and was relaxing for a minute, Stacy comes over with spicy chocolate vegan cookies as her way of apologizing for the delay. She didn't have to do a thing to apologize. Still, it was such a nice gesture. As I ate earlier, she recommended I put the fried egg over the biscuits and let it leak. I was in heaven, shortly after..Whenever people visit me from Philly, I always make it a point to bring them here. You'll probably have to wait about 30 minutes to an hour, but just do it.

So sad I feel that Cafe Ghia has gone downhill.  I've always loved it but my last trip there recently the food really was not very good.  I got the 'big salad' with cheese and avocado added to it ($14).  The dressing is usually very good but it was super bland this time.  The ingredients just seemed to be leftover fruits and veggies that were about to go bad.  My friend got the kimchi salad and couldn't finish it -- the proportions of the foods in the salad were way off -- it was insanely spicy and waaaay too much kimchi.I'm not quite sure what happened here because the food last year was pretty good.  I have heard some other friends in the neighborhood say the same thing as well.  Maybe some quality control is in order?  I don't mind paying $14 for a salad if it's going to be VERY good (and it has been before!)...but this was unacceptable.,2.0

"Waitress was friendly and accommodating - but there's only so far that courtesy can take you if the food is bad.This was my first visit.I was excited by the kale/kimchee salad and ordered it.To my great disappointment, there was no actual kimchee in it. It was just kale drowned in spicy mayonnaise - and it was pretty gross. Disappointment #1.The waitress was kind enough to bring me some mixed greens instead. It was boring, but I was just happy to have something else instead.Then I got the Sunday night special - grilled chicken on a millet pilaf and asparagus. The asparagus was the only enjoyable component.The pilaf tasted like patchouli and cardamom. Nasty - but that's just a matter of taste - my date liked it - i can't complain....but the chicken...chicken has a VERY distinctive odor if you defrost it and leave in the fridge a couple of days instead of cooking it immediately. it's a very funky, unpleasant odor. if you've smelled it, you'll never forget it. and that's the smell and taste that came out of this bird... when the bill came, it was $50. My friend just had mac and cheese. I felt cheated and unsatisfied. but i didn't complain to the waitress because in Brooklyn customers aren't supposed to be honest about their experiences. Those that are, are perceived as ""fussy"". So when the waitress asks you, ""How was everything."" You're supposed to say, ""Great"" - even if, at that very moment, you're nervously asking yourself if you're becoming nauseous. If you add the obligatory tip, the final cost would have been $60 - and remember - while in the rest of America the tip is a reflection of your satisfaction with the dining experience, in Brooklyn you are a worthless piece of shit if you don't tip at least 20% no matter what your experience is...i'm monitoring myself right now to make sure i'm not getting food poisoning.I will not be returning to Ghia.",1.0

This is a huge brunch spot and there's usually a wait on the weekend but it's worth it. They'll even take your number and text you when your table is ready. I recommend the lumberjack stack! I get it with their vegan sausage. So good! I've enjoyed everything I've gotten there. As a vegetarian, it's nice to have a place with so many options close by.

I was told that since I was alone, I'd have to wait for a spot at the bar, which coincidentally was full. I waited for THIRTY MINUTES, during which time no spots opened at the bar, but several small tables opened up. Instead of seating me at a two-top (God forbid I should take up more than my allotted real estate as a single diner), they would wait for a party of two to come in and seat them immediately. Seriously? When I asked what the deal was, the hipster waiter was rude and condescending.Needless to say, after this happened a couple times and they made no effort to make room for me, I left and ate at Barcey's down the street, which was a LOT less pretentious.

Which is just not acceptable.The burger I had prior to was good, but once I saw the Giant monster get released from the kitchen I lost my entire appetite.The waitress/seat hostess also didn't allow us to sit at a table even though there was available seats and our food hadn't came out yet. This was weird as you'd think it wouldn't be no problem, but she ran to the kitchen asking ""if it was alright."" Seriously? A group of 4 in a restaurant that has over 8 available seats 30 mins before closing?If they would of allowed us to sit at the table our view of the kitchen would of been prevented thus we wouldn't have seen Ghia's Giant Roach's and this review would of actually been positive... I normally give restaurants another chance when I give them 1 star, but think there is no going back after this.",1.0
"So after walking so many blocks to finally get here, the food was Ok!! The waffle sandwich was good but there was hair in our food. The waitress was really sweet. She apologize n offer another plate of food. Minus the hair I think this would be a good spot.  Some advice,  All stuff in the kitchen hair should be pull off, hair net on, plus a hat. We trust folks to prepare our food and not have accident like this to happen",3.0
"This is one of my go to spots in the neighborhood. The service is always excellent and the food is delicious! I'd say they have the best veggie burger in the area (black bean, yum!). Get there at the right time and get the burger and beer special. My hubs always gets their regular burger. He says it's awesome. I take his word for it. This is a huge brunch spot and there's usually a wait on the weekend but it's worth it. They'll even take your number and text you when your table is ready. I recommend the lumberjack stack! I get it with their vegan sausage. So good! I've enjoyed everything I've gotten there. As a vegetarian, it's nice to have a place with so many options close by. The only thing I can't recommend is their biscuit. I'm from the south and I know a good biscuit. They should really work on that. Otherwise, two thumbs WAY up!",5.0
"The food looked pretty good, but unfortunately I didn't get to eat it.I walked in on a Saturday afternoon. The place was busy, but there was no wait. I was told that since I was alone, I'd have to wait for a spot at the bar, which coincidentally was full. I waited for THIRTY MINUTES, during which time no spots opened at the bar, but several small tables opened up. Instead of seating me at a two-top (God forbid I should take up more than my allotted real estate as a single diner), they would wait for a party of two to come in and seat them immediately. Seriously? When I asked what the deal was, the hipster waiter was rude and condescending.Needless to say, after this happened a couple times and they made no effort to make room for me, I left and ate at Barcey's down the street, which was a LOT less pretentious. I'm glad I did, and I won't be back to Ghia.",2.0
"Ghia is a great little cafe. I love about 100 feet away and love this addition to the block. Great coffee and really friendly servers. The line for brunch on the weekend can be a deterrent, and I have not yet had the weekend menu. The weekday brunch menu is a must. The steak and eggs is some of the best around, and the fully loaded potato bowl is fantastic. Avocado everything. Also, great happy hour. Keep it up guys!",4.0
"Had their Vegan Scramble with a fried egg on top, quite good, similar to a burrito but without the wrap. Got that with a biscuit instead of toast, biscuit was average, nothing to write home about. Sister had a Potato bowl with avocado, which is basically large slices of greasy roasted potato with some cheese and half an avocado on top. It was good but perhaps better as a shared dish as oppose to a meal on its own. Steak & Eggs dish was on the smaller portion side, def wouldn't fill an average male's appetite, only a hipster's appetite. Cute atmosphere, bar seating and about 10 available tables, small space, laid-back service.",3.0

"Love this place and the service! I've been a few times for dinner and brunch, I highly recommend brunch over dinner if you have a gluten allergy. There are only a few things on the dinner menu I can eat (which are delicious... vegan stir fry, salad, sides) but I prefer lots of options. They have a ton of vegan/veggie options which is great for some. For brunch they have delicious mofongo that is out of this world! I got it without the bacon and it was devine. My BF had their burger and ordered it rare, the slabs of bacon he got on it were actual Slabs of deliciousness. And we shared a PINT of mimosa made with fresh squeezed OJ for $11 (correctly called Mega-mimosa) that was tasty and made properly. I've also had a few of their daily brunch specials made with seasonal veggies and fluffy eggs. To top off the great food is the really impeccable service, everyone is friendly and top of their customers without bothering them. The minute your coffee gets low they fill it up before you can ask and they are quick and friendly about everything, even when it's slammed they will answer your questions and pay attention. Anyhoo, two big thumbs up and we will be going back often! Hopefully they can add a dish or two to the dinner menu so I can go for more than just the (outstanding) brunch!",4.0

"Great Carrot Soup in Sorta Hipster NeighborhoodHit this joint because I was visiting someone who lives nearby. Otherwise, I'd have never found the place. It's in a kind of desolate, but actually very interesting part of Bushwick, an area which, according to the waitress in this restaurant, is just being ""gentrified"", by which she seemed to have meant that hipsters, or people from the same socioeconomic demographic who prefer not to be identified as hipsters, are beginning to move in.It's a vegan-vegetariany place. I can't really say a whole lot more than that about the food, because I only went once, and unless I happen to visit this person again, don't really expect to go back, but that's not because of the quality of the establishment, but because you have to take the L to Jefferson Street, which I'm about as likely to do as take the F to Avenue P -- that is, get off at random train stops in the wilds of Brooklyn that most people just never make as their desintation.But the carrot soup was rich and thick and perfectly spiced and yummy on a chilly April evening, and accompanied by a quite delicious wheat bread. If that carrot soup is indicative of the rest of the food, this place is a winner. The server/bartender greeted me with the most geniune smile, and we had a completely arbitrary and quite fun conversation. There I was, walking into this restaurant exhausted and alone, carrying 15 pounds of film-shooting equipment, and I get this warm hello from a stranger. Excellent. By the time I exited, 40 minutes later, I felt refreshed and ready to take the train back to Manhattan where I knew I'd be crowded in with a whole bunch of people and always at risk for the random insult. This restaurant truly ""restored"" me, which, I believe is where the word ""restaurant"" originated.It's cute, and clean, and a little rustic. It has blackboards scrawled with colored chalk displaying the names of dishes and drinks in curly letters. It's got good beer choices. It's not too pricey.

It was painful to see the difficulty she had biting through the over toasted bread. Had there been a touch more tahini dressing, it would've slightly moistened the bread and add flavor. My second visit, this time for brunch, was a lot more pleasant for the following reasons: - We did not have to wait long at 1PM- While outside, we saw someone walk out of a community garden with a hand full of freshly harvested herbs run into the restaurant. What's it for? Certainly not for decor.- Bottomless strong cup of coffee.  We inquired where it's from and server shyly admitted not knowing but mentioned it's been dubbed ""kick ass""- Server checked on us often without being overbearing and even apologized when our orders were slightly behind.- All of us enjoyed the food - french toast, BLT panino and my order of daily scramble of zucchini and cherry tomatoes.  Quality ingredients, when prepared with care and simplicity are always a winner in my book.I'll give dinner another shot for sure.

"If Ghia were on the west coast, it would probably not attract many veg*ns, but in the land of the carnivores, the place with the decent veggie burger is king. It's my #1 spot for brunch; the tofu scramble with kale and sweet potatoes hits the spot every time (add tofu lime sour cream, add jam, if feeling flush add avocado). I never leave with that too-full, greasy feeling one might get from eating at Champs or Foodswings (R.I.P.). The wait staff is generally quite nice and Erin the redhead is my homegirl. The vegan sausage is Field Roast's apple sage flavor so feel free to order it because that shit is delicious.Other vegan things I have vegan liked include the kale and kimchi salad, the ""big salad"" or whatever it's called (totally filling enough to be a meal), the vegan burger, and the tofu and veggie stir fry over rice vermicelli (which is a lot of food for your money).In terms of drinks, the bloody marys are killer (and vegan) and I also heart the Brooklyn Fizz (some sort of tasty gin/st. germain concoction). The only thing I haven't liked is the tempeh bacon panini, which has been weirdly soggy both times I've gotten it. I also feel like the oven dried tomatoes plus the tempeh bacon is a little too much salt. But whatever. I still love you, Ghia.",5.0
"I have a litmus test for restaurants. If they can do biscuits and gravy well, I'm sold. This place knocks those buttery, southern staples to the moon. I have had many a buscuits drenched in sausage gravy growing up, but Cafe Ghia goes the extra couple of inches to deliver an exceptional breafkfast/brunch dish. The rest of the menu is just as impressive. However, a small dining area means you will probably have to wait as more folks catch on to this lil' gem in Bushwick.",5.0

It was actually big cubes of tofu pan fried with big cubes of sweet potato. More like a hash than anything. When I was in for dinner, I got the flat bread of the day which was like a mini pizza. The flavor was delicious and I was told they have all different types of flatbreads and they're usually vegan. I hope to go back soon to try it.",3.0
"It's convenient that I live half a block away from Cafe Ghia because it is fantastic.  The menu features a diverse selection of both vegan and non-vegan dishes.The small but cozy dining room is warm and inviting.  The music was good too.  I was hoping to try the stuffed peppers but unfortunately they were out by the time I got there.  So I settled for grass-fed burger infused with bacon fat.  Enough said.  Perfectly cooked and topped with melting Vermont cheddar with a tomato aioli on the side.  For an appetizer I tried the Tostones Trio ($6) which included 3 fried plantains with seasonal toppings.  My favorite was the jalapeno and goat cheese.Cafe Ghia also has a great selection of cocktails.  I am an avid gin and tonic drinker so I went with the Brooklyn Fizz (Brooklyn Gin, Earl Grey simple syrup, fresh lemon, Boker's Bitters, soda).  On point.The staff/bartender was knowledgeable and friendly.  Will be back soon.",4.0
"Have come to Cafe Ghia a couple times for both brunch and dinner, I  remember thinking it was good for Bushwick but on my last visit they seemed it step it up. It's hard to find a good salad, not just in the neighborhood but throughout most of north Brooklyn. Everything it super small or just glorified mixed greens. However, the Big Salad here is amazing. It's a great size and included so many delicious things that made it satisfying as a meal. My only problem is that you can only add in tempeh or tuna steak but I would like a chicken or steak option. I did add bacon this time and that was delicious. Another amazing feature about Cafe Ghia is the large beverage selection. I had a few different type of drinks but I really enjoyed the Brooklyn Fizz because I am on a huge earl grey kick. I usually hate bloody Mary's but the kimchi Bloody Mary was amazing!I do really wish they had outdoor seating during the warmer months.",4.0
"I came to Cafe Ghia on a late Saturday afternoon in search of brunch. Thankfully, They serve brunch until 4 p.m. (at least) and my weekend dreams weren't killed. It was adequately crowded, but the host took my name and number and called me when the table was ready, so I didn't have to wait in the crowded non-existent front area. My sister and I both ordered tofu scrambles; not the best I've had and not the worst. The tofu was a little too soft and the kale pieces were a little too big and chewy; though I did appreciate the addition of sweet potato to the dish as well as the cilantro lime tofu-cream. I also ordered a side of the breakfast potatoes, which were a nice compliment to the meal. The coffee was good and plentiful; not sure who their roaster is but it was strong without being bitter.I'd like to come back to Cafe Ghia sometime, as I'm not sure I had an appropriate sampling of their menu and would like to try more things.",3.0

"If Ghia were on the west coast, it would probably not attract many veg*ns, but in the land of the carnivores, the place with the decent veggie burger is king. It's my #1 spot for brunch; the tofu scramble with kale and sweet potatoes hits the spot every time (add tofu lime sour cream, add jam, if feeling flush add avocado). I never leave with that too-full, greasy feeling one might get from eating at Champs or Foodswings (R.I.P.). The wait staff is generally quite nice and Erin the redhead is my homegirl. The vegan sausage is Field Roast's apple sage flavor so feel free to order it because that shit is delicious.Other vegan things I have vegan liked include the kale and kimchi salad, the ""big salad"" or whatever it's called (totally filling enough to be a meal), the vegan burger, and the tofu and veggie stir fry over rice vermicelli (which is a lot of food for your money).In terms of drinks, the bloody marys are killer (and vegan) and I also heart the Brooklyn Fizz (some sort of tasty gin/st. germain concoction). The only thing I haven't liked is the tempeh bacon panini, which has been weirdly soggy both times I've gotten it. I also feel like the oven dried tomatoes plus the tempeh bacon is a little too much salt. But whatever. I still love you, Ghia.",5.0
"I have a litmus test for restaurants. If they can do biscuits and gravy well, I'm sold. This place knocks those buttery, southern staples to the moon. I have had many a buscuits drenched in sausage gravy growing up, but Cafe Ghia goes the extra couple of inches to deliver an exceptional breafkfast/brunch dish. The rest of the menu is just as impressive. However, a small dining area means you will probably have to wait as more folks catch on to this lil' gem in Bushwick.",5.0
"I give this One star to the bartender who, when I told him, the $20 flank steak was tough as leather and the $5 side dish of ""roasted corn and tomatoes"" was really just corn and tomatoes, nothing was roasted, all he kept repeating to me ""I'll tell the manager, I'll tell manager..."" Some how I got the feeling he never would tell the manager. I really want to like this expensive cafe with paper napkins in my nabe but they don't seem to listen to their patrons.",1.0
"Cute spot, I've been once for brunch and once for dinner. For brunch, I had the tofu scramble, which had a good flavor, but wasn't actually a scramble. It was actually big cubes of tofu pan fried with big cubes of sweet potato. More like a hash than anything. When I was in for dinner, I got the flat bread of the day which was like a mini pizza. The flavor was delicious and I was told they have all different types of flatbreads and they're usually vegan. I hope to go back soon to try it.",3.0
"It's convenient that I live half a block away from Cafe Ghia because it is fantastic.  The menu features a diverse selection of both vegan and non-vegan dishes.The small but cozy dining room is warm and inviting.  The music was good too.  I was hoping to try the stuffed peppers but unfortunately they were out by the time I got there.  So I settled for grass-fed burger infused with bacon fat.  Enough said.  Perfectly cooked and topped with melting Vermont cheddar with a tomato aioli on the side.  For an appetizer I tried the Tostones Trio ($6) which included 3 fried plantains with seasonal toppings.  My favorite was the jalapeno and goat cheese.Cafe Ghia also has a great selection of cocktails.  I am an avid gin and tonic drinker so I went with the Brooklyn Fizz (Brooklyn Gin, Earl Grey simple syrup, fresh lemon, Boker's Bitters, soda).  On point.The staff/bartender was knowledgeable and friendly.  Will be back soon.",4.0
"Have come to Cafe Ghia a couple times for both brunch and dinner, I  remember thinking it was good for Bushwick but on my last visit they seemed it step it up. It's hard to find a good salad, not just in the neighborhood but throughout most of north Brooklyn. Everything it super small or just glorified mixed greens. However, the Big Salad here is amazing. It's a great size and included so many delicious things that made it satisfying as a meal. My only problem is that you can only add in tempeh or tuna steak but I would like a chicken or steak option. I did add bacon this time and that was delicious. Another amazing feature about Cafe Ghia is the large beverage selection. I had a few different type of drinks but I really enjoyed the Brooklyn Fizz because I am on a huge earl grey kick. I usually hate bloody Mary's but the kimchi Bloody Mary was amazing!I do really wish they had outdoor seating during the warmer months.",4.0
"I came to Cafe Ghia on a late Saturday afternoon in search of brunch. Thankfully, They serve brunch until 4 p.m. (at least) and my weekend dreams weren't killed. It was adequately crowded, but the host took my name and number and called me when the table was ready, so I didn't have to wait in the crowded non-existent front area. My sister and I both ordered tofu scrambles; not the best I've had and not the worst. The tofu was a little too soft and the kale pieces were a little too big and chewy; though I did appreciate the addition of sweet potato to the dish as well as the cilantro lime tofu-cream. I also ordered a side of the breakfast potatoes, which were a nice compliment to the meal. The coffee was good and plentiful; not sure who their roaster is but it was strong without being bitter.I'd like to come back to Cafe Ghia sometime, as I'm not sure I had an appropriate sampling of their menu and would like to try more things.",3.0

"I walked into Cafe Ghia on a hot summer day, hoping to grab a light vegetarian lunch. I ordered an iced tea and the vegan burger. I had tried their beef burger on a previous visit and I was really impressed, so I figured the vegetarian version would be of similar quality. No, not the case. Could I say it was bad? Well...it certainly wasn't any good. Definitely not equal to the price ($13, comes with a side of lettuce). The patty, which mostly tasted like unsalted black bean paste, was so soft it squashed down and seeped out through the sides of the bun when I tried to cut the sandwich...in the end, what I was eating was bean paste salad with a roll. Not recommended.Also, very annoying was the realization that the price of my iced tea ($3.50) did not include any refills, and was essentially a mason jar full of ice. When I asked the waitress/bartender (who was extremely sweet and helpful) why this was the case, she told me that the reason was ""because we brew it here."" Well, that's great. And here I was thinking that every restaurant in America brews it's own iced tea. It's freaking TEA, for crying out loud! You add water to a heap of the stuff and....no, that's it. The entire recipe for tea. I digress.My impression leaving this place was, ""Gee, what a rip off."" The next time I feel like going out to lunch in Bushwick, I think I'll instead go to North East Kingdom where I may spend the same amount of money, but will leave impressed as always by their surprisingly delicious food.

"Came here with a friend for dinner. The bartender took our orders and all seemed well. the food arrived and the bartender had screwed up my order completely because she clearly (she even admitted) was not paying any attention when she took my order. in the time we were waiting she without asking me if i wanted it, brought me a soup which i could not eat due to dietary restrictions. If someone orders a burger with no cheese that would indicate lactose intolerance. so that same logic would suggest that they can't eat a soup with a cream based base! When my food finally came i was given the wrong side dish which the bartender waved off by literally saying "" well at least i got the main part right "".. halfway through the meal i was given a microwaved, tasteless bowl of potatoes that i had i originally ordered, but never brought that was so hot i burned my mouth. to top off the final insult, i was given change when i paid of a 10$ bill and a 1$ bill. This is a move by the bartender knowing i did not have to change to force me to tip the 10$. i did so mainly because i am not an asshole but if i had been i would have just tipped the 1$ due to the horrendous service. I advise you to do yourself a favor and spend your money somewhere else.",1.0

The yogurt and granola, the huevos rancheros type dish, the toast with cinna butter....all perfect.

"Brunch here was supposed to be the start to a beautiful Sunday. My friend had passed by plenty of times with the delicious smell of their food in tow. We got there and was told it'll be a few mins which is no problem. Brunch is usually a 30-45 mins wait. So while waiting, my friend wanted a cup of water since we were told to wait outside. The brunette hostess told us we could not get a cup of water because the bar and kitchen were running behind. This is totally normal and totally fine but the bartenders were talking and standing with there customers. They were not swamped at all. We came back asked if we could just go up ask for a water it wouldn't take long. She said no we're really backed up! Lol this is a joke is what my friend and I both thought. We're waiting in the sun and aren't even offered a glass of water. So we signaled the bartender and asked for two cups of water. He fixed them unless than 2 mins. Handed them to us with no problem and we left right after. The hostess has terrible manners and she didn't even call us since out names were on the list. We were looking so forward to Café Ghia but we will not be visiting this place.",1.0
Just had dinner there and it was spedtacular. Such a laid back atmosphere with classic rock in the background. The mussels were out of this world as was the Tostones Trio.

"So, I only review things when I'm extremely upset/disappointed or extremely overjoyed. If you can't tell by the single star rating, this will be of the former category. I've known this place since it opened and I've been there before. I would say that on previous visits (prior to today) I've been underwhelmed by Ghia, but have returned. I hadn't previously been so underwhelmed that I was unhappy to part with my money in exchange for the meal, or to say I'm never coming back.Today, myself and my fiancee arrived to be seated straight away, in a restaurant with roughly 15 patrons - about half of which had their food already. Great! It's only 10am in Bushwick, so naturally there isn't a great urgency about the place. Should be in and out quickly. Wrong - it took almost a full hour to be served two pathetic breakfasts - and when they came, mine was nearly cold and hers wasn't too awesome. The incredible thing about this place is that a vegan scramble is 10$, and is enough food to be considered a snack, at best. The small, cold, non-filling plate is astoundingly priced at an outrageous number. Anyone saying that a 10$ breakfast is cheap, does not live in Bushwick. Even the new Life Cafe (983 Living Room) is cheaper than that, and is regarded as way beyond overly expensive for the area. There are numerous places you can get a considerably more substancial breakfast for considerably less than that. All of this would have been acceptable to me, except for the fact that the staff showed zero interest in how long we had waited, left us waiting 10 minutes for a bill whilst we SAT AT THE FUCKING BAR, and were noticeably pissed off.Needless to say, I will not be returning to this fucking abomination of a ""cafe"". I'm sure they will continue to bleed money out of rich hipsters who are moving to Bushwick because they're practically the only game on Irving between Flushing and Starr. Unless it's past 11, then you can get delicious arepas around the corner with 100x better service for half the cost. I hate you Cafe Ghia, you are a black mark on an otherwise wonderful area that I've called my home for years now.",1.0

The wine is great, cocktails are great, and I've been for brunch and it's also great. Damn, how many times can I say ""great"" in one review? Well, clearly, Cafe Ghia is great.",5.0

The bartender took our orders and all seemed well. the food arrived and the bartender had screwed up my order completely because she clearly (she even admitted) was not paying any attention when she took my order. in the time we were waiting she without asking me if i wanted it, brought me a soup which i could not eat due to dietary restrictions. If someone orders a burger with no cheese that would indicate lactose intolerance. so that same logic would suggest that they can't eat a soup with a cream based base! When my food finally came i was given the wrong side dish which the bartender waved off by literally saying "" well at least i got the main part right "".. halfway through the meal i was given a microwaved, tasteless bowl of potatoes that i had i originally ordered, but never brought that was so hot i burned my mouth. to top off the final insult, i was given change when i paid of a 10$ bill and a 1$ bill. This is a move by the bartender knowing i did not have to change to force me to tip the 10$. i did so mainly because i am not an asshole but if i had been i would have just tipped the 1$ due to the horrendous service. I advise you to do yourself a favor and spend your money somewhere else.",1.0
"AmazzzzingggggI live in the area and there are few places around here I eat on a regular basis but this is one of them. Healthy food in a semi-food wasteland area, much needed. The food itself is so, so good. I'd say more New American than French, rich and light options, and the drinks are also PHENOMENAL. The yogurt and granola, the huevos rancheros type dish, the toast with cinna butter....all perfect. Ive never been here for anything other than brunch so I cant speak to that but when i come here I tend to linger and the staff is always sweet and relaxed. A little pricey for the portions (...they are pretty small) but still worth the trip. Really nice ambiance inside too.",4.0
"Brunch here was supposed to be the start to a beautiful Sunday. My friend had passed by plenty of times with the delicious smell of their food in tow. We got there and was told it'll be a few mins which is no problem. Brunch is usually a 30-45 mins wait. So while waiting, my friend wanted a cup of water since we were told to wait outside. The brunette hostess told us we could not get a cup of water because the bar and kitchen were running behind. This is totally normal and totally fine but the bartenders were talking and standing with there customers. They were not swamped at all. We came back asked if we could just go up ask for a water it wouldn't take long. She said no we're really backed up! Lol this is a joke is what my friend and I both thought. We're waiting in the sun and aren't even offered a glass of water. So we signaled the bartender and asked for two cups of water. He fixed them unless than 2 mins. Handed them to us with no problem and we left right after. The hostess has terrible manners and she didn't even call us since out names were on the list. We were looking so forward to Café Ghia but we will not be visiting this place.",1.0
Just had dinner there and it was spedtacular. Such a laid back atmosphere with classic rock in the background. The mussels were out of this world as was the Tostones Trio. I had the vegan burger with brussel sprouts for dinner. So incredibly delicious ! Best vegan burger ive had in a long time.:),5.0
"So, I only review things when I'm extremely upset/disappointed or extremely overjoyed. If you can't tell by the single star rating, this will be of the former category. I've known this place since it opened and I've been there before. I would say that on previous visits (prior to today) I've been underwhelmed by Ghia, but have returned. I hadn't previously been so underwhelmed that I was unhappy to part with my money in exchange for the meal, or to say I'm never coming back.Today, myself and my fiancee arrived to be seated straight away, in a restaurant with roughly 15 patrons - about half of which had their food already. Great! It's only 10am in Bushwick, so naturally there isn't a great urgency about the place. Should be in and out quickly. Wrong - it took almost a full hour to be served two pathetic breakfasts - and when they came, mine was nearly cold and hers wasn't too awesome. The incredible thing about this place is that a vegan scramble is 10$, and is enough food to be considered a snack, at best. The small, cold, non-filling plate is astoundingly priced at an outrageous number. Anyone saying that a 10$ breakfast is cheap, does not live in Bushwick. Even the new Life Cafe (983 Living Room) is cheaper than that, and is regarded as way beyond overly expensive for the area. There are numerous places you can get a considerably more substancial breakfast for considerably less than that. All of this would have been acceptable to me, except for the fact that the staff showed zero interest in how long we had waited, left us waiting 10 minutes for a bill whilst we SAT AT THE FUCKING BAR, and were noticeably pissed off.Needless to say, I will not be returning to this fucking abomination of a ""cafe"". I'm sure they will continue to bleed money out of rich hipsters who are moving to Bushwick because they're practically the only game on Irving between Flushing and Starr. Unless it's past 11, then you can get delicious arepas around the corner with 100x better service for half the cost. I hate you Cafe Ghia, you are a black mark on an otherwise wonderful area that I've called my home for years now.",1.0
Great service and delicious food. Must stop by! A small restaurant but it doesn't disappoint. Great beer and wine selection.,5.0
"Cafe Ghia is great. I consider myself an addict; in fact, I am not ashamed to admit I am completely and hopelessly addicted to the kale and kimchi salad. I typically stop here on my bike ride home from Manhattan. It's a great spot to hang out with friends and grab a delicious (and affordable) bite to eat, as well as a nice place to hang out at the bar and read a book. The wine is great, cocktails are great, and I've been for brunch and it's also great. Damn, how many times can I say ""great"" in one review? Well, clearly, Cafe Ghia is great.",5.0
Made the mistake of sitting at the bar. And they were cleaning glasses by dunking them in sudsy water and then rinsing. Rings all kinds of unsanitary to me. Walked out after having been here 4 or 5 times.  Shuckster...,2.0
"One of the worst (and awkward) dining experiences I've had in NYC.  First, we walk in and nobody greets us for 5 mins.  A very socially awkward man who we later figure out is actually the host finally approaches us and points to the bar, we kindly say we are willing to wait for a table.  We wait...and wait... So we walk in to see what's going on.  He then proceeds to tell us that two ladies that had JUST walked in are before us...ummm...NO... After patiently waiting, the socially awkward man takes another 20 mins to clean up the table and have it ready, and when it's finally ready, he goes off to do something else, all the while my boyfriend and I are just standing there staring at the table that was supposed to be ours.. We were hungry, frustrated, and our patience wore thin so we finally left and decided to dine somewhere we are treated like human beings!",1.0
"Finally gave Cafe Ghia a visit since being here in Bushwick now for almost 2 years. Cute and cozy and menu a pleasure. Everything though was super small (our table was too) and kept rocking back and forth. I guess it would help if I learn to eat in small portions such as what they serve but I'm from the south so brunch means to me getting full not eyeing the desert menu or looking to order another drink. The mocha i ordered was a bit tiny as was the OJ, everything was served in small glasses or cups. The Rachero egg dish I ordered was really great but looked so small on the plate even w/the bacon i added extra to it felt more like an appetizer. Will I visit again, probably if I'm in the mood for happy hour or something w/someone but it's unlikely I'll do brunch.",3.0
"Unless it doesn't matter to you, make sure when it is crowded and you are asked to wait 10, 15 or 20 minutes that it is for an actual table.

"Cafe Ghia is my favorite Brunch spot in Bushwick!  The staff is super friendly, very helpful and always open to a nice chat as long as it doesn't get too busy. Flynn is hilarious, Stacy's a riot and Nora is such a sweetheart! Anyways, onto the food!  The Lumberjack Stack is my favorite, with a full Belgium waffle that sandwiches two scrambled eggs and strips of bacon with Vermont Maple Syrup. The Grass Fed Burger is incredible, my boyfriend says it's the best burger he's ever had!  I'm not vegan, but I get the vegan scramble pretty regularly too.  It's a delicious way to get your veggies early in the day!  Try it with the tofu cream or some added avocado.  Their Megamosas (Or big-ass Mimosas) and Bloody Mary's with fresh house-made Mary mix is a good start to whatever weird adventure you're going to get into after in Bushwick!  The restaurant serves brunch seven days a week (Yay!) but if you're planning on dining during the weekend, chances are you're gonna have to wait.  Don't worry though, they take your cell number and call you when the table is ready, so you can grab a cup of coffee at Wyckoff Starr or Cobra Club while you wait, then head back when your table is all set!  Score!",5.0
"We went here for a dinner on a Tuesday night so the place was not that busy and we got seated right away. We started off with some drinks. They had cans of Six Point beer for $5 (16 oz) and some decent specialty cocktails.From there we ordered the beet salad to share which was tremendous (fresh greens, sauteed goat cheese and warm beets). After this delicious salad we were excited for the rest of the meal.Alas, our excitement was premature. The sandwiches were meh as the pork was too porky and the fish was too fishy. We also ordered a mac and cheese to share which was meh.I understand what they are trying to do here and Ghia has potential.

"Went here for dinner.The staff was great but the food was disappointing all around.  The ginger carrot soup was more like a warm pudding which I could forgive if it actually had flavor.  The flatbread was forgettable.  The braised pork shoulder entree was a big mistake.  I should have asked the waitress what to expect but the menu description sounded good enough: braised pork shoulder, savory kimchee corn meal waffle, braised greens, pickleI guess I was expecting a fall off the bone slow cooked pork shoulder. Nope. I mean I'm sure it was braised at some point but calling it pulled pork shoulder would seem more appropriate because it's the kind of meat I would expect on a sandwich. The corn meal waffle turned to mush very quickly which was a killer because the dish seriously needed some texture.  The greens and veggies were lost in a vinegar slurry amongst the mess.  It's a dish that needs to be rethought or taken off the menu.We ended with the chocolate lava cake.  Not bad but I've had frozen microwave versions that were on par or better than this one.I did see some other interesting dishes coming out of the kitchen and like I said, the service and atmosphere were great along with the drinks.I left feeling let down but I wouldn't write the place off entirely.",2.0

The place isn't huge, so even when full, I just can't see it getting so busy that you gotta go running around so much and getting so frazzled you start forgetting tables. But who knows - maybe it was the 2-top that kept playing musical tables all around the restaurant until they settled on an 'acceptable' table. I just wanted to grab the server and tell him to breathe for a second, clear his head, not be so stressed out.",4.0
"Thank you for all the vegan options (plural!), Café G! I felt so fancy eating that pretty risotto-stuffed pepper on your cool but homey dining floor. The big salad is great too. Thank you for making a salad worth ordering.",5.0
This was my favorite neighborhood restaurant when I lived in Bushwick.  Especially delicious burgers cooked in bacon fat (don't let that stop you from getting the bacon - ASTONISHINGLY GOOD).  The kimchi/kale salad is top notch.  The watermelon gazpacho is divine.  I've enjoyed everything I've ordered there.  I look forward to my next visit.,5.0
"Been here once for brunch and the second time for dinner and so far, so good.Brunch was crowded but a blast. Bottomless coffee is a luxury around here and those pint-sized mimoas do wonders.For dinner, it was quieter and gorgeous. Romantic place! The tempeh reuben isn't vegan to order, but the chef tweaked it for me and added mustard for me to still give it flavor. I scarfed that motha down and my friend loved his tomato soup and grilled cheese.Bottom line- they use local, seasonal product and their staff is sweet. The price is right for what they're doing and I'm gonna try and go again soon, even if it's in Bushwick. ;)",5.0
"I came here for brunch on saturday at around 1 and it I was surprised to find that it was pretty busy! especially since its kind of in the middle of nowhere..aka our neighborhood and also pretty new. But anyway, we walked in and we were not greeted by anyone for a really long time. I know it was a busy brunch and that they were apparently clearing a table for us (never communicated that fact, but I could see that it was happening) but it was really awkward standing around forever and I did kind of consider walking out. So besides the service being pretty awkward, I did really enjoy the food! I got the biscuits and mushroom gravy which was just about perfect - except know that the sausage (delicious and house-made and kind of sweet in a way) comes on the side so I cut it up and mixed it into my gravy. There was enough gravy for the 2 big biscuits! which is sometimes hard to find..My boyfriend got the 2 eggs, bacon and potato item and it looked good but I tried the bacon and it was kind of more like a thicker jerky than the crisp-type bacon, kind of weird to me but good. I also noticed that they make their own strawberry jam! which was totally exciting to me and the butter for the toast has cinnamon and sugar in it! Its little details like this that make brunch awesome for me. Real excited about this place being so close to my house.",4.0
"I think this is my favorite brunch location in Bushwick. Sometimes there's a little bit of a wait, but service is pretty fast-paced so it's never an absurd amount of time. The staff is nice and friendly and the food is great. The coffee they serve is delicious, it's the same as what they have at Wyckoff Starr. AND I have to say that it's genius to serve ""mega-mosas"".

Rediscovering our neighborhood as authentic Bushwickites is an exciting endeavor. It only gets better when you discover places like Cafe Ghia.When we arrived it was originally an hour wait. The host/waiter was so nice and accommodating and was just a pleasure to speak to. (I wish we caught his name). We were pleasantly surprised that it didn't even take half that long!We said we would accept seats at the bar or table seating (we weren't very picky). Three seats opened up at the bar and it was just a greater experience from there. The Bartender Stacy was so welcoming and helpful in answering our menu questions and helping with our suggestions and makes a hell of a latte! The FOOD WAS OUT OF BOUNDS delicious! Everything came piping hot and full of flavor. We just couldn't lose! We ordered a:Potato Bowl with all the additionsLumberjack SpecialHuevos RancherosThe Kimchi Bloody Mary IS NOT TO BE MISSED! The team that was running the joint was entertaining and made you feel welcomed.Don't miss the opportunity to visit Cafe Ghia! It's worth the wait to experience this Bushwick Gem!,5.0
"I love living in Bushwick, but it is hard to find nice restaurants to go to without jumping on the subway to head West toward Williamsburg...so when I read on bushwickbk.com about the opening of Cafe Ghia just a few blocks from our apartment I was so pumped!  This Saturday we strolled past Maria Hernandez Park and over to Cafe Ghia for a relaxing brunch.  The space is small and intimate but not too small, I love the simple decor and unique shelving above the bar.  I found out upon our arrival that this was the first weekend for brunch service so I was excited to be a part of their opening!  The menu was just the right size, not too many options, not too little.  The prices were SOOO good- pretty much everything under $10!! woohoo!!The coffee was really good and strong (I am VERY picky about brunch coffee...usually it isn't strong enough for me).  The waitress was really sweet and she kept the coffee coming! So big brownie points for her for that.  We split a waffle for an appetizer and it was covered in pureed pumpkin and like, toasted walnuts on top...it melted in my mouth it was SOOO good.  Fred got the vegan scramble for the entree andi t looked delicious, packed with fresh and local ingredients.  I got the 2 eggs, housemade sausage, and toast.  The toast was served with housemade jam and cinnamon butter (amazing)...the sausage was good, it wasn't the best sausage I've ever had...but I love the fact that it's made in house by their chef, so I know where it is coming from.The food was delicious, the super-fun '60s pop music was playing the whole time, the service was great.I am definitely going back this week or next to try their dinner options.  Local foods, freshly made, great atmosphere, and I can walk there!!!",4.0
"I like it when restaurants open in my neighborhood.  Who doesn't like a little variety, right?  I had brunch at Cafe Ghia over the weekend, and this is what I thought.We ordered the Biscuits and Gravy with a side of Bacon and the BLT with a side of Breakfast potatoes (home fries).  We both had Bloody Mary's.  B's and G - These biscuits are righteous!  I mean knee dip perfect, when that buttery bread hits your taste buds!  Crispy on the outside, but fluffy and buttery on the inside.  They truly give the biscuits from Pies n' Thighs a run for the money.  The mushroom gravy was very good as well.  It was nice and creamy, with the perfect amount of little mushroom slices.  My one complaint with the B's and G at 'Pies' is they are way too salty.  That is not the case with Ghia's version of this breakfast classic.  The bacon on the other hand was way too greasy and limp.  I think they get it locally, which is cool, but does that mean it has to be so soggy and flavorless?  I don't know, maybe it does.  I was not impressed.  I guess I like my bacon crispy and full of smoky pork flavor.  I'm weird like that.  So win on the B's and G, lose on the bacon.BLT - Well, it's fancy..... I will give it that.  honestly though, I am getting kind of tired of this pretentious restaurant blah, blah, meh.... when old classics are  ruined by over cooking, over ingredient-ing them.  STOP!!  'mmmhyes, today's menu consists of wood oven toasted PAN, with a dollup of fronch mustard and oven rrrrddoasted Solanum lycopersicum berries from the far reaches of Jersey of New, with imported, smoked, brined and cured bovinae strips, on a bed  of upstate NY Lactuca sativa. .... mmmhhhh yes...  quite delicious guvnah!'OK, so I might be over exaggerating a little, but seriously!  You get the idea.  Just give me two slices of goddamn bread, toast it, don't toast it, whatever...  some crispy smoked bacon, fresh lettuce, fresh tomato, and let me go to town.  I don't need my tomatoes oven dried or roasted, and I certainly don't need the whole thing smashed in a grill like a panini.  Again, the bacon was not crispy, and bland.  The disappointment of the ""BLT"" really overshadowed the side of breakfast potatoes.  so let's just say they were dazzling.Bloody Mary's - These suckers are tall and delicious!  Nice and spicy,  with plenty of vodka.  If you order this with the BLT, drink it first, it makes everything so much better.***Edit***Overall, 4 stars.  Unlike Northeast Kingdom, this place doesn't feel like restaurant rape. - 1st star...  This might be the place for Biscuits and Gravy!! - 2nd star.   ***edit***  The food is constantly good and the service is always friendly - 3rd star.  And, they didn't give me diarrhea or make me vomit! - 4th star!  They also have free Wi-Fi y'all!!

"Just moved to Bushwick and am making it a point to try as many places as I can. Came here today for an excellent brunch, my first in the 'hood. Had the belgian waffle with pickled blueberries and huckleberries and maple whipped cream ($9) along with a side of scrambled eggs ($1) and a bloody mary ($7?). Also some bites of my friend's biscuit. The waffle was warm and not too sweet. Not nearly enough maple whip, oh mah gah, but still awesome. I'm not a big fan of eggs on their own (i.e. not in betweenst toast and alongsidst bacon), but I ate this entire egg solo. And it was great. A damn fine scrambled egg is deceptively hard to find. I only had one bite of my friend's biscuit (why does this sound dirty?), but it was an AMAZING-ASS BISCUIT. I had to restrain myself from shoveling it into my mouth like a Cookie Monster. Will be back to attack another biscuit/egg combo very soon. As for the bloody mary - delightful. Not particularly stand-out, but there was nothing wrong with it.

"Cafe Ghia is a a jewel with great, home-cooked food and well-appreciated Brooklyn prices. I went here for brunch with a friend and had their magnificent BLT sandwich - the bacon was crunchy and thick and not sparse at all, the tomato was fresh and not mealy, and it came w/roasted potatoes as a side. However: the roasted potatoes COULD have been crispy... or maybe thats just me wishing they were fries. My friend had their delicious daily scramble with sweet and tender butternut squash.Iced coffee and iced tea with refills is another plus. Their iced tea is a Chinese blend and it's a nice change from what you usually get. Our entire meal was $20.I love how this place really had the chance to becoming well-integrated w/the neighborhood- their price point doesn't alienate young 20 something's with small bank accounts but also invites what some would call ""the real Bushwick"" to take part in.",5.0

"Went to Cafe Ghia last Sunday while I was on a short trip to NY. The brunch last til 4:30. Cute little place. I ordered the seasonal omelet which included red peppers, corn and leeks and a side of roasted potatoes. The mimosa was divine. We stayed for awhile chatting and had dessert. The dessert was ok, nothing to write home and tell mama about. It was a butterscotch bread pudding with apple slices. The bread pudding was hard. Also it was a little cold in there, there was a space heater in the corner by the windwo but it didnt help much.",4.0
"I'm surprised I haven't reviewed this place yet. I've been here a few times each for brunch and dinner, and have always had a satisfying experience.

"Just moved to Bushwick and am making it a point to try as many places as I can. Came here today for an excellent brunch, my first in the 'hood. Had the belgian waffle with pickled blueberries and huckleberries and maple whipped cream ($9) along with a side of scrambled eggs ($1) and a bloody mary ($7?). Also some bites of my friend's biscuit. The waffle was warm and not too sweet. Not nearly enough maple whip, oh mah gah, but still awesome. I'm not a big fan of eggs on their own (i.e. not in betweenst toast and alongsidst bacon), but I ate this entire egg solo. And it was great. A damn fine scrambled egg is deceptively hard to find. I only had one bite of my friend's biscuit (why does this sound dirty?), but it was an AMAZING-ASS BISCUIT. I had to restrain myself from shoveling it into my mouth like a Cookie Monster.

"I came here for brunch over Memorial Day weekend since it was on the early side and not everywhere was open yet. I had tried to come once before but the wait was too long (why can't this place be bigger?!). Anyway, even though it was early, it was already packed, with people waiting outside, but we managed to score seats at the bar. I ordered the potato bowl... with the egg... and the bacon... and the avocado (in my defense, I started my diet the next day!) and it was SO GOOD!!! In hindsight, the egg didn't add that much flavor and I will probably leave it off the next time (read: because I will absolutely be eating this here again). The shelving was dope, the orange juice was fresh squeezed and the people working were friendly and helpful. The only problem I had with Cafe Ghia was that they kept refilling my friend's coffee for her, without asking if she wanted it, and when the bill came, they had charged her for all the refills. I'm not sure if that was an oversight, but if it's common practice, that's pretty lame.",4.0

My friend had the burger and said it was to die for. The chef prides herself on offering organic farm to table fare. There is a good mix of vegetarian and meat options .

"I was so excited to have such a cute and well-thought place to be built just a few doors down from me.  I'd been seeing the construction occur for a couple of weeks and the owners (Hannah, Sam, and Scott) were so willing to give me the updates.  I ended up having dinner there with a friend on their second night open and it was such a comfortable experience.  The decor is very Brooklyn--bricks, low lighting, and dark wood floors.  It's awesome how you can see into the kitchen though, and how you can already tell that it is going to be an awesome brunch spot (which I found would be an all week 10am deal!) because the restaurant is all windows that can be opened with the good weather.  My favorite part was the bathroom though.  I have this thing where I know that a restaurant was well thought if their bathroom follows suit.  There's nothing worse then going to a cute/beautiful place to eat and then entering a white fluorescent-lit room--boo.  But Cafe Ghia does a wonderful job!  When you open the door there's a gorgeous black and red round tile covering half of the walls and there are photos of old cars, newspaper, couples, and then of the construction of the restaurant surround the top half of the wall.  There is a masculine well-lit lamp hanging from the ceiling and it's just a well-thought addition to the space.We started off with wine ($5-9)  and ordered their Spreads and Breads which included black olive tapenade, almond-cauliflower , and hummus spreads with carrots, celery, and tortillas/french bread.  We loved the tortillas, but as my friend commented throughout the meal, ""They need to rethink their bread"" because it was a little to crunchy and not quite there.  The tapenade was awesome and I liked how the cauliflower spread was more almond then vegetable.  I ordered the Vegge Sandwhich (to which they give you the option of chips or salad) and I loved the combo of the portobellos and goat cheese--recommended!!!  My friend ordered the Tuna Melt and really liked the lemon aiolli and capers that were on it.This place is still figuring things out--which I like--so everything was a little ""on the fly"" and casual for them.  The service was friendly  and it's just all of the owners coming together to find the ""machine"" of the restaurant.  You will feel like you are supporting local business and relaxing all at the same time...FIND THIS LITTLE GEM FOR YOURSELF!",4.0

My friend ordered the burger. You'd think it'd be hard to go wrong with a burger, but as luck would have it, it's possible at Cafe Ghia. The bun was completely burnt, so we sent it back, without receiving so much as a comment or apology from the waitress. Not seasoned well, and underwhelming.

The third time was around 7 pm on a Thursday night. The same chef that was working Tuesday was on this night and I knew it would be bad. I only got the beet salad. The beets were way undercooked an the salad tiny in comparison to my first visit. Almost insultingly tiny.

The portions were just about right. The staff were always super nice. The atmosphere is cozy. No complaints (except for the wait for a table, but that's not their fault - I'm sure it's less crowded on week days).",5.0
"Great place to have in the neighborhood. I brought my parents. The menu is small, but focused, and they now offer a full bar (only simple mixers for now but a cocktail list is incoming, said our waitress). I enjoyed my tuna melt. Our flatbread app was excellent.",5.0
"My beau and I kept on passing this place and after weeks of waiting around, we went last night.  We were not disappointed with our meal or the delightful service!We seated ourselves in the corner next the window and took in the ambiance.  You feel like you're in someone's kitchen; it's bright, colorful enough without inducing nausea, and cozy.  Our waitress walked right over to our table with a large smile and was perfectly charming.  She was easygoing but attentive.  She went through all of the specials and all of which were very enticing.  We wound up ordering the hummus, the seasonal scallop dish, and the grilled cheese.Hummus: perfectly creamy with the right amount of tahini.  Sometimes you order hummus and it's grainy or too pasty, this was delicious!  It's served with a crusty grilled bread which was awesome on it's own.  The grilled cheese is served on sourdough bread with Vermont white cheddar, fig compote, and chopped almonds.  It is a very decadent combination of creamy, crunchy, sweet & salty.  I could eat one of these every day... but then I would end up in hospital with a heart attack.  The side salad that comes as an option with the sandwich (the other option being potatoes), was light and very topped with a tart sherry vinaigrette.  The seasonal sea scallops were served with parpadelle pasta, cremini mushrooms, grape tomatoes, and baby spinach.  Very yummy!  The scallops were fresh and cut like butter and the portion size was just right.  Only complaint about this dish: the pasta was a little too soft.  I prefer my pasta al dente, but this is only a personal preference, not a requirement (obviously).Our waitress helped me pick out a beer to accompany my meal which was very nice; she wasn't a beer buff but she has a clear idea as to what she liked.  She recommended the Allagash White: a very light and citrusy beer which reminded me of a Belgian white but definitely not as creamy.  Perfect for a warm Friday night.Would we be back?  Yup.  Especially for brunch!",5.0
"Nice owner, good, friendly vibe, lots of windows and healthy and tasty lunch fare. Have only been here in the day, but will be back!",4.0
They have a short menu and lots of special which makes me think they do most of their stuff freshly that day. I love that. Super delicious. Great service. I will be back for sure.,5.0

"Love this place.  Good vibes, great food, friendly staff... one of the only places in the neighborhood that got it all right.  They have a decent amount of vegetarian options for their small menu, and their daily brunch is delicious.  So far, every experience at cafe Ghia has been hassle free and tasty.",4.0
Went there yesterday for lunch and chef had no idea how to cook a burger medium-rare. First try was medium-well (more well than medium) and second effort was medium.  Apparently he relies entirely on meat thermometer. Couldnt be bothered to send it back a second time as was quite hungry at that point. Shame as had the same burger few nights before and it was cooked perfectly and damn delicious.,2.0
Brunch all day! it's great! great neighborhood spot!,4.0
"Went here with a friend for lunch on a Monday, which is probably good, as I'm told it gets busy at night/weekends. The tempeh reuben sandwich exploded with flavor and the service was great. Cash only, though, which is always annoying. Will be going back for brunch sometime.",4.0
"This place is great. Friendly staff, the food is decent but since the cafe just opened they are probably working out some kinks. I love the fact that they have a daily brunch. Oh...and Bloody Marys made with Soju? SIgn me up. So if you go to Northeast Kingdom and the rude blonde "" manager "" there tells you theres a 3 hour wait? Come to Ghia Cafe. They will treat you like a paying customer.",3.0
"I just had to write a review for this restaurant, even though i would love to continue to never ever have to wait for a table. I have been here for drinks, brunch, and dinner, and every time has been amazing. Every sandwich is amazing, from the tuna salad to the grilled cheese. The menu is really simple, but I have tried just about everything on the menu and it is always quality dishes and quality ingredients. And the staff is always super friendly!",5.0

"Mission complete! We encountered excellent cocktails that live up to their enigmatic names, fresh food, and professional, charming staff at Ghia. We ordered the roasted beet salad, the pulled pork, and the veggie reuben. The beets were a touch undercooked and the portions of pork were small for the price (16.00), but due to the quality of the ingredients -- maybe good meat should cost that much. Overall tasty food and decent ingredients. It is amusing that Vermont seems to have a direct commuter line to Bushwick -- Ghia's folks are certainly loyal to their roots and serve VT cheeses and Long Trail beer. I really liked the staff-- professional, cool under pressure, and happy to work there.",4.0
I want to give this place four stars but I feel like there needs to be more options on the Brunch menu! Am I being silly? I might be. THEY MAKE THEIR OWN JAM. This was amazing and probably my favorite part. The service was lovely. No huge complaints. 3.5!,3.0
"My husband and I ate here... food was de-lish. The owner was so nice. Nice ambiance. A good, inexpensive house red wine that I liked. Awesome addition to the neighborhood. Support this place!",5.0
"The food here is really yummy! Their grilled cheese with slivered almonds and fig jam is awesome and just a nice, different take on a classic sandwich. For breakfast, their egg scramble with fresh veggies is cooked to perfection, along with the roasted potatoes that are served along side it. They have some cheap beer choices which doesn't hurt either. Overall, it's a nice option for any meal of the day or for a drink or two with friends in the evening.",5.0
