"The food is great. The beer is great. The reference in the name is great. You get the picture.This is the place you go when your friend with the leg tattoo and bicycle cut jean shorts wants to grab a drink in his neighborhood, or if you're that friend, this is where you wheedle people into meeting you. In all seriousness, it's not every day you find a place doing Cajun food successfully in Bushwick, especially with people serving it in a friendly, efficient manner. Now that the back room is open, hopefully the occasional crowds will subside a little bit, but even if they don't, this is a joint worth visiting.",5.0
Great customer service. Always end up staying for hours when I bring a friend for brunch. The food is heavily influenced by new orleans cuisine and they have multiple options for vegetarians. I've checked this place out on a Saturday night and it was packed. Turns into a bar type vibe.,4.0
"I'm surprised I haven't written a review for HW. Although it's been some time since I've visited, I can say with utmost certainty that my opinion hasn't changed. The staff is great and the drinks are well balanced. Depending on what time of the day/week you swing by, it can get a little hectic, but since they've opened up the back room I'm sure that the traffic jam situation has died down.The only reason I'm not a regular here is because it's quite out of the way from where I live in BK and where I work in Manhattan (alas, like so many wondrous things in the 'Wick). However, if I'm anywhere within a half mile radius of this spot, I usually try to convince any companions to tag along, and with good reason.the food is rich/heavy (no uh, pun intended?) but if you're boozin' hard, you'll probably be thankful for something substantial so soak up all that alcohol.",4.0
"REVISED REVIEW:I came here for breakfast / lunch this past Saturday morning with the s/o who absolutely swears by this place and raves how good it is here.Straight to the point, we walked in was greeted and seated right away.We ordered:- Crispy Chicken Biscuit - Crawfish Mac & Cheese- Crabby Jacques He was right, everything was beyond deliciously good. With that being said, 4 stars for this place. It would have been a 5 star for me. However due to our encounter months back. When he took me here and we were greeted w/ a ""hi seat yourself"" and the waitress was gone like the wind. Totally not acceptable. (I'm still not over that)Maybe, my next encounter. I'll get over it",4.0
"I cannot say enough nice things about this restaurant! I have always had a pleasant experience with the staff and the food- my goodness!! The food is amazing! If I could live in a vat of their shiitake gravy I would die early but it would be worth it. It fills up quick in here, which is no challenge to this organized and efficient staff, but come early to get a great seat. They keep the cocktails, coffee and water (re:hangover) flowing.",5.0
"I was so confused when I found this place on Yelp. I saw two listings (this and Tchoup Soup) with the same address and both had very similar menus with the exception of 1 or 2 dishes. I finally pieced the puzzle together and realized Tchoup Soup is the Creole food featured at the Heavy Woods bar. Why two yelp accounts though? You get free gumbo with check-in at Tchoup Soup but not Heavy Woods. Weird.Nonetheless, we headed over to Heavy Woods for dinner the other night and I was incredibly disappointed. I walked in and stood at the entrance for a solid 2 minutes, which is a long time when you're just standing there. No one acknowledged me. There was no waitress or waiter in sight and only 1 bartender manning the bar. I go up to the bartender and she tells me to sit wherever. I head to the back where it says ""Lounge"" to get away from the noise. There was a couple already seated back there so I was glad to know we wouldn't be ignored.I sat for another 5 minutes while I wait for my boyfriend to arrive then I see a girl walk by so I ask her for 2 menus. She brings them over, then while I'm using the restroom (which is gritty and filthy) she takes away one menu. Maybe she needed it but when my boyfriend arrived she never gave us another. It's a short menu anyway, so ended up deciding on cracklin's to start and the chicken biscuit and pork po' boy for our main. I tried the Kiwi Green cocktail which was a decent summery drink.I'm going to side track here and say we just got back from NOLA the day before so we were riding off the vacation high and was craving more creole food.Cracklin: Crazy small serving, but who should have too much of this anyway, right? My main issue with this dish was how greasy the pork belly was. It was like they let it sit in the fryer for 2 minutes too long. Every bite you took grease would pour into your mouth. It was soo unappetizing. I had to damp it into a napkin before taking another bite.Chicken Biscuit: While the chicken had good flavor, this just didn't do it for me. The biscuit to chicken ratio was off, with almost no biscuit. The dish was too simple, it came with nothing, not even garnish. There were 3 highlighted ingredients, chicken, biscuit, jam, which just left a lot to be desired.Pork Po' Boy: So dry it's crazy. Granted I asked for no mayo, but the slaw and the pork should've been the juicy ingredients. The sandwich had an overwhelming amount of bread which made it even drier (opposite to the chicken biscuit). If they had added more slaw and maybe had juicer pork this wouldn't have been too bad.Service was blah, our waitress was mainly out front and barely checked on us. I really wanted to like this place since it has good reviews but it seems like the chef just handed over the menu to inexperienced line cooks and let them butcher it up.I'd rather head over to Montana's 3 blocks away.",3.0
"We were in the area and looking for a place to have a quick dinner on Friday night so we stopped here as the menu looked good. We walked in and helped ourselves to seats at the bar. The place has in interesting look. The seating was an eclectic collection. As for food, we ordered off of the daily special menu. I had the watermelon feta salad and ordered a biscuit on the side. He had BBQ Cajun shrimp dish.  As for the salad, it was simply the most amazing, tastiest salad I have ever had! What ever slightly spicy delicious dressing they used for this dish, it made me want to lick the plate. The biscuit was slightly over baked but it was still quite good. As for his shrimp BBQ, the taste was spectacular. The only thing we didn't like is that the shrimp came completely in it's shell...legs and all. The dish was really saucy and it was hard to get the meat out of the shell as we were afraid the red sauce would splatter on our clothing. We didn't really feel like working for our food and using our hands to separate the shell. We left quite a few shrimps for this reason. For the service, we sat at the bar so not much to comment on. Someone was available when we needed something. The bathroom grossed me out. It was covered wall to wall in graffiti and grime and no mirror. Would be nice to get a cheap mirror or something from IKEA as us women like to check ourselves out before departing a restaurant.  I wouldn't be totally opposed to coming back if ever in the area again.",3.0
"Came here least night with a few friends for some drinks and a bite. The place has a very cool vibe and plays great music. They have a great list of Cocktails. I went for my usual margarita and it was delicious. We also were with a New Orleans native so please know that this food review is as legit  as can be. we got the crispy pork belly cracklin which was amazing! Followed by the crispy chicken biscuit ( a little to much sauce but still yummy), the catfish po boy, crawfish mac & cheese and jambalaya. All of these items were authentic and delicious. We ended our meal with a slice of chess pie. I have never had it before and I must say it was incredible and a must try! A special thanks to chef J for making these incredible goodies and our awesome waitress Patty!",4.0
"I came here on a Sunday early afternoon for brunch with my boyfriend who is from Louisiana (cajun country). I had gone this past November and fell in love with boudin. And being asian helps with loving pork cracklins. Heavy Woods came recommended by you fellow Yelpers!Let's start with the food. We ordered boudin balls, cracklins, and deviled eggs for appetizers.Boudin balls are basically the balled up fried insides of a boudin sausage (mixture of rice, seasoning, spices, and some kind of meat). For someone craving boudin, I was very happy about these boudin balls. They tasted just like boudin-the-sausage, but without the casing and with a much crispier shell. YUM!The cracklins were perfectly done. They were seasoned with some sea salt, served hot. Thumbs up!The deviled eggs were covered in paprika and very spicy. I enjoyed them but they didn't really blow my mind. Then again, deviled eggs don't really blow my mind in general, so that was to be expected.For our entree, I ordered the Holy Shiitake and my boyfriend had the The Red Eyed Bandit. The Holy Shiitake was basically cheese grits with eggs and bacon covered in a mushroom gravy sauce. The bacon was thick and juicy, but I could only eat one because of the pork cracklins I had been shoveling into my mouth earlier. Grits were different (sweet), but still very tasty. The mushroom gravy was my favorite part, it definitely brought back memories of Texas for me.The Red Eyed Bandit had tassou meat in it. It was well cooked and the biscuits were soft, warm, and moist. The eggs were done well and loaded with spices. This too was covered in gravy. Absolutely delicious!The only reason I'm not giving this place a 5 star is because of the service. It took forever to get our drinks. And even though we placed our food order with our drink order, the food still took a very long time to come out. The place is not that big and there were 2 servers. I have no idea why i service was so slow.This place is definitely worth the trip out to Bushwick. Go on a lazy day when you don't have any plans afterwards!",4.0

Well i dont agree for great customer service because we waited 15min or maybe more to get a menu when it was not busy at all and then people from next table just passed us menu and we ordered food and drinks and ofcourse the server forgot one of the food and of course she didnt realize until we asked her to cancel the menu.  never checked our table and all that happening our server never apologize.

"My roomie and I stopped by around 4:30 on a Saturday to get a Bloody Mary. First, nobody at the bar acknowledged us despite being over staffed for that time of day. (Most employees were on their phones in front of customers, or talking loudly about stupid stuff.)We finally got service, and ordered our $8 Bloody Mary's (really small, and not worth the price.) My roommate paid with a $10 bill, and the bartender did not give her the change. He just went back to chatting with the other employees.I haven't been here for food, but I'm not sure if I will based on my experience at the bar in an off hour.",2.0
"To lead off in a positive tone, the food here and the drinks are incredible. It's really a shame that the customer service is one of the worst examples of human behavior I've experienced. Because of the employees at this establishment I have decided I will never go back to Heavy Woods again. Scorned so much by the behavior that I have been shown and shown again by what I can only assume are money hungry people, I will never miss the opportunity to tell all my friends (and family that visit) to never visit this wonderful establishment. At this point, I have had two terrible experiences while being a 'customer' at Heavy Woods. The latest experience is as such: I walked up to the restaurant, asked Greg (one of the bartenders) if I needed to buy something to sit and work on an art project I'm working on. He said I did indeed, it was dinner time, and the right thing to do. So, ok, I don't drink, but hey, I'll buy someone a beer. Upon walking in, the only place that I saw open was a table with 3 seats, and immediately after sitting down, Greg asks me to sit at the bar so I don't take away the whole table. Ok, you got it Greg, no problemo (I didn't like taking away the 2 other seats anyway). I sit at the bar, strike up a conversation with a beautiful woman, and offer to buy her drink; there goes my part of the bargain to be able to hang out in this establishment (and every other place of business, I get it, the business needs money to survive, no biggie). However, I don't know, an hour goes by, if that, and I had been talking to this girl and showing her my art books, and she was drinking her drink, and one of the other bartenders starts giving me these sideway looks and I can tell she is talking to Nina (I don't know how to spell it, and I think she is a manger of some kind) about me. Now, I might just be paranoid. So I say it out loud to the blonde bombshell I'm swooning, I say, ""They are going to ask me to leave, watch."" To which she responds to take it easy and there's no way they would do that. A few minutes later, the unnamed bartender asks the girl I was conversing with if she'd like another drink, and she says no, she was going to leave soon, and I say no I'm good, I had bought her drink already. The unnamed bartender says (and I'm paraphrasing) 'Well, you need to buy something else.'  Not only is this immediately shocking that I'm basically being told that my money wasn't good enough (drink was $8 with tip) but that this woman has the need to say that. And I said, 'I bought her drink. I already gave you my money.' And the bartender says, 'You didn't give ME money.' Of course, I corrected myself and said ""You're right, I mean I paid your establishment, my bad"".  And this particular bartender then demonstrated something ridiculously selfish (in my humble opinion) and says ""Well, I need to make money too. And you didn't pay ME.""  HA! I wanted to laugh at the ridiculousness of the situation but I was so taken aback that my good deed of buying someone a drink, that my money (that I don't have a lot of, struggling film geek/artist living in New York) wasn't good enough to her business, but rather, because it didn't go right to her pocket, I was considered an issue. And I said, 'Oh.  I'm leaving then.  What's your name?'  And of course, she didn't answer.  Well, for all interested parties, I was there tonight, Thursday night February 5th, eh I want to say around 9P - 10P. Not only did she not answer the simple question of 'What's your name?' but she actually walked away, smirked, and ignored me.  And I said, 'Are you serious, what's your name?'  Again, ignored.  My next move, where's my man Greg, 'Hey Greg, can you come here? I asked her her name and she is ignoring me.' Greg immediately takes to it like Switzerland and says ""That's between you and her.""

Thanks dude.  And this bartender, the woman who needed more money from me more then she desired gaining a new loyal customer (which I am with restaurants I enjoy, banks that I enjoy, cell phone companies, grocery stores, the like) sells out Greg and Nina by telling me that she asked them if it was ok that she asks me to either buy something again or leave. Ok, I understand where I stand now, and it's not where I like to be. I understand that people need to make money, we all live in an expensive part of town, and times are tough, I get it. However, I literally have $1.10 in my bank account as I type this because I gave Heavy Woods my second to last $8 to be able to sit there, and these 'people' are so infatuated with stuffing their pockets with dollar dollar bills y'all that they are cool with sacrificing someone (i.e., me) who would most likely come back time and time again.

"I came here for brunch on Saturday with a friend. She raved about this place so I was pretty excited to try it out. The space is nice, rustic chic, I suppose. My friend and I perused the menu while we chatted about the shit we got into the previous night. It took a long time for water to arrive at our table but I didn't think much of it because I was busy talking to my friend. I ordered an iced coffee (which was absolutely freaking delicious) and the jambalaya, while my friend ordered the crab cakes Benedict. Upon initial spoonful, the jambalaya was actually quite tasty. Spicy and well seasoned. Everything was fine up until the third or fourth bite. That's when I realized that the chef or line cook had sprinkled sea salt into the dish like it was parsley. Every other bite or so was so overpoweringly salty because of the random chunks of salt that overpowered every other taste. I mean come on. My friend's food, had multiple issues. Firstly, it was SO SALTY. Overwhelmingly so. It would be okay if it was just the crab cake that was salty but let's remember that everything is soaked in hollandaise sauce. Lastly, and the most disappointing part was that her crab cake smelled so fishy, like it had gone bad. When my friend offered me a bite I couldn't get over how fishy the taste was. It was actually really disgusting. I'm no crab cake expert but I've had it before on multiple occasions and I have never ever experienced a fishy tasting crab cake. We ended up staying for an hour or so after our meal because my friend had some bloody marys, and I started to feel super nauseous. Like all of a sudden. Now I should preface this with the fact that I was slightly hungover, nothing major, just a light headache. I was so overcome with nausea that I actually ended up throwing up in the bathroom. Now I can't say that this is normal behavior on my part because I don't vomit, I just don't. So I can't say for sure if it was the food, the hangover or a combination of the two.All in all, this place gets three stars because their coffee and cocktails are pretty great. Just skip on the food.",3.0

"My roomie and I stopped by around 4:30 on a Saturday to get a Bloody Mary. First, nobody at the bar acknowledged us despite being over staffed for that time of day. (Most employees were on their phones in front of customers, or talking loudly about stupid stuff.)We finally got service, and ordered our $8 Bloody Mary's (really small, and not worth the price.) My roommate paid with a $10 bill, and the bartender did not give her the change. He just went back to chatting with the other employees.I haven't been here for food, but I'm not sure if I will based on my experience at the bar in an off hour.",2.0
"To lead off in a positive tone, the food here and the drinks are incredible. It's really a shame that the customer service is one of the worst examples of human behavior I've experienced. Because of the employees at this establishment I have decided I will never go back to Heavy Woods again. Scorned so much by the behavior that I have been shown and shown again by what I can only assume are money hungry people, I will never miss the opportunity to tell all my friends (and family that visit) to never visit this wonderful establishment. At this point, I have had two terrible experiences while being a 'customer' at Heavy Woods. The latest experience is as such: I walked up to the restaurant, asked Greg (one of the bartenders) if I needed to buy something to sit and work on an art project I'm working on. He said I did indeed, it was dinner time, and the right thing to do. So, ok, I don't drink, but hey, I'll buy someone a beer. Upon walking in, the only place that I saw open was a table with 3 seats, and immediately after sitting down, Greg asks me to sit at the bar so I don't take away the whole table. Ok, you got it Greg, no problemo (I didn't like taking away the 2 other seats anyway). I sit at the bar, strike up a conversation with a beautiful woman, and offer to buy her drink; there goes my part of the bargain to be able to hang out in this establishment (and every other place of business, I get it, the business needs money to survive, no biggie). However, I don't know, an hour goes by, if that, and I had been talking to this girl and showing her my art books, and she was drinking her drink, and one of the other bartenders starts giving me these sideway looks and I can tell she is talking to Nina (I don't know how to spell it, and I think she is a manger of some kind) about me. Now, I might just be paranoid. So I say it out loud to the blonde bombshell I'm swooning, I say, ""They are going to ask me to leave, watch."" To which she responds to take it easy and there's no way they would do that. A few minutes later, the unnamed bartender asks the girl I was conversing with if she'd like another drink, and she says no, she was going to leave soon, and I say no I'm good, I had bought her drink already. The unnamed bartender says (and I'm paraphrasing) 'Well, you need to buy something else.'  Not only is this immediately shocking that I'm basically being told that my money wasn't good enough (drink was $8 with tip) but that this woman has the need to say that. And I said, 'I bought her drink. I already gave you my money.' And the bartender says, 'You didn't give ME money.' Of course, I corrected myself and said ""You're right, I mean I paid your establishment, my bad"".  And this particular bartender then demonstrated something ridiculously selfish (in my humble opinion) and says ""Well, I need to make money too. And you didn't pay ME.""  HA! I wanted to laugh at the ridiculousness of the situation but I was so taken aback that my good deed of buying someone a drink, that my money (that I don't have a lot of, struggling film geek/artist living in New York) wasn't good enough to her business, but rather, because it didn't go right to her pocket, I was considered an issue. And I said, 'Oh.  I'm leaving then.  What's your name?'  And of course, she didn't answer.  Well, for all interested parties, I was there tonight, Thursday night February 5th, eh I want to say around 9P - 10P.

Portions are small, so be prepared to order multiple items if you've got an appetite. The Angry Hippie was great, I could've easily devoured 2 orders of those creamy eggs and grits.

Portions are small, so be prepared to order multiple items if you've got an appetite. The Angry Hippie was great, I could've easily devoured 2 orders of those creamy eggs and grits. The chili was great too, a deep smoky flavor unlike anything I remember having before. We ordered a couple coffees to go, one of which was really unique, the peanut butter latte. This is a great spot!",4.0
"This place is a brunch gem. The bloody Mary's are goddamn delicious. They have three types: Rosemary, beet, and bacon. I've TRIED EM ALL. Your hippie earthy friends will love the beet one, your guido friends will love the Rosemary, and all the fat americans like me will enjoy the bacon. The food is goddamn delicious. Also the bartender/server was, in a word, delightful. He's the bald bearded plaid wearing one. He is like, an example of how brooklyn hipsters are not complete f***bags? Like- he's just really nice. If you don't like him YOURE THE F***BAG, OKAY? Anyway thanks Heavy Woods. Also/ they put steamed milk hearts on their lattes.",5.0
"Heavy woods has been a staple for me thus far living in bushwick but every time I go there in the morning it's been their weaker crew attending or rather, not attending. Went there this morning for brunch and sat at the bar with my girlfriend for 15 minutes without a greeting and we felt totally invisible. There weren't many people at all so it felt weird and surreal. It sucks because there are a handful of dope employees but we found ourselves traveling down the block to Northeast Kingdom and received excellent service. Sad bout it.",3.0
"Sister bar to the Bodega on St. Nicholas street. It does trendy Cajun style foods like gumbo but they do other dishes as well. They're open early for the morning rush and have great fresh ground coffee and teas. They also have a full bar and if you're a little cash strapped you can try what I call the ""Hipster Special"" which is either a PBR and a shot for $5 or a Narragansett and a shot for $6. They also have expensive wines and whiskeys if you're not drinking on the cheap as well. Friendly staff just like at the Bodega. Near public transportation such as the L subway line a block away on Starr (Jefferson St. station).",4.0
"I don't wanna name names, but I think the chef tried to cook me in a stew here once.  He kept inching closer and closer as I was yankin the legs off all of my shrimp (hundreds of legs) and was pretending like he was asking me how my shrimp was tasting... butttt I mean c'mon.  You knew by the naughty spatula in this playa's hand and the gleam in his eye.  HE WAS TRYING TO COOK ME!  I had another hennessey on the rocks and skedaddled faster than you can say ""Mississippi Mudslide!!""   Pulling the tentacles off all those hot shrimps burned the fingerprints off my fingertips but I got a little aroused by that sauce and that bread loaf....if ya know what I mean heheheh?  Also the bar stools were exceptionally comfortable for a portly playa like myself.",5.0
"I thought the service was really sub-par and the staff was actually really rude.  One of the bartenders was combative with me when I told her that my drink was not properly made.  The charge was $12 for the drink, so I thought at least make it properly. She had the audacity to tell me that she made the drink strong ""but now i regret it"".  If you're not going to fix the drink and still charge me full price the least you can do i shut the hell up.",1.0
"I want to give this place 4 stars, because our food was tasty, and the bartender/server dude was nice and friendly. But the portion sizes were so small!Our duck and okra gumbo, which we got the ""bowl"" size of, rather than the smaller ""cup"" size (and the server assured us the bowl was good for sharing) came in a small, shallow ""bowl"" which was more like a dish. There was a salt-dish sized scoop of rice set in it. A bit miserly? :(",3.0

Don't mind if I do! :DEnd of the night: I'm passed out at a nearby taco place -_-So as not to look like a rookie alcoholic, some tips:1) Order food as soon as you come in (Tchoup shop has good selections) or eat before coming to this place since Happy Hour is until 8pm every day and $10 goes a loooonggg way. They also accept credit cards.2) Do tip your bartenders well- they're really nice and they don't give out attitude with their service. This is most welcome when you're drunk and need a glass of water asap.3) Alternate said glass of water w/ each strong drink and you're all set lest you end up hugging a plant around the corner while the owner of said plant asks you to move to the tree across the street (in a nice way!).Have fun!",4.0

"I ordered for the first time yesterday, and ordered take away so I wasn't in the bar long, but I was in there long enough to see that it was peppered w eclectic, hipster diners and just getting out of work up and coming guys in suits. The Asian bartender that everyone loves (from reading the other reviews) was there and she had a huge smile and a very on top of it attitude. It wasn't quite 4:30 p.m. but like I said there was already a nice handful of people, you can tell this place gets hopping as the night wears on...Parking is easy enough to come by (I found a spot right in front) and the Jefferson L is right there. The food ~ Definitely interesting food choices that I will most likely crave and get despite the price point being a little expensive, but you do pay for quality and diversity any day of the week even (especially?) in NYC. I always over order when ordering from a new place for the first time, rather have leftovers than have to do an emergency run to the taco or halal truck b/c there wasn't enough. We got the Catfish Po Boy...which I highly recommend, as the catfish was breaded and fried to perfection, the wheat artisan bread was sweet, soft and crusty all at the same time...the sauces blended to perfection, what a treat! The other sandwich we got was the Chicken Biscuit...amazing blend of flavors and the biscuit was so delicious and flaky...it's small, but packs a wallop...would have been fine having just that, it's the perfect sandwich for a beer when you get tired of burgers and beers, go get this chicken sandwich and you will be super happy.We got two sides, the Crawfish Mac n' Cheese which I guess is the fancy grown up southern version of mac n' cheese and hotdogs....!? We also got the brussel sprouts which were loaded with bacon, bleu cheese, green apples and brussel all swimming in some kind of sauce good enough to drink...I think two people would probably forgo the sides to save money and just get the sandwiches or only one side...there was leftovers of both the sides but we smashed the sandwiches like hungry orphan dogs.

"Writing this review while currently sitting in Heavy Woods. My boyfriend and I have been here for over an hour and just got our food. When we arrived we sat at a dirty table for at least 20 minutes. The check that the previous dinners left was less than a 10% tip, and now I know why. They were severely understaffed for the brunch service and although our server was very friendly you could tell he was extremely stressed and not happy. We asked for water several times only to be told that they misplaced the water containers and were searching for them. We have both finished our meals and still have not received any water. At one point we were told to make drink orders at the bar which is totally fine but should probably be how all orders are placed considering the slow wait staff. After waiting 40 min after our initial arrival we went to the bar to place our food orders since we did not receive any service after our first drink orders which had been gone. The service and food was so slow that I actually went over to the Bushwick flea while waiting for my food. I bought a dress and got it pinned for alterations and was back before our food even came out. That. Is. Ridiculous. I understand that we were sitting at the last table in the back but several tables around us were also extremely underserved and that is completely unacceptable to me. The food was also not much to write home about. Biscuits too dry, eggs waaaay over done, flavorless grits and gravy. The only thing that was done well were the drinks.

The drink menu is beer-centric, not too many wine options from what I could see. Great playlist. My only gripe was the bartender/ waitress. As I was putting my order in at the bar, she didn't reply to me and looked up kind of blankly, then glanced at my friend. So I repeated my food order and she responded, ""I heard you,"" with this condescending little smile. I didn't like that very much....it doesn't cost anything to be nice! Other than that, loved it. Go if you're in Bushwick!",4.0
"If you have not been to Heavywoods let me point out the most important factor: THE FOOD. Yes, they have your general beer-shot $5 business, cocktails, and a good selection of draft beers, but what other bar in Bushwick has CAJUN-INSPIRED FOOD????  While I wish the chef was cooking it up all week versus Wednesday through Sunday, its still worth making the trip. My personal favorites are Crawfish Mac & Cheese & Chicken Buscuit! The bartenders truly are the nicest, and it's in the perfect location. When by the Jefferson L- Go to Heavywoods!",5.0
"Drinks are overpriced for the area, though good. The ambiance feels a bit like they're trying too hard. Plus, when my beau and friend were there, there was some creepy guy all over a very drunk girl in the corner (and the lights were bright enough that everyone in the bar was witnessing this). Won't be back. Go to Pearl's instead.",2.0

went there today for lunch. it's the perfect place to have a drink or work on your computer. bartenders were chill and the atmosphere is so comfortable. delicious cajun burger. wish they had ketchup. they forgot our order but there was apparently a problem with the printer. it wasn't a big deal. will definitely be back.,4.0
"Love this place for coffee! Every now and then you need a mix of jameson and grumpy coffee and if you are lucky enough to get Erica the barista I guarantee it will be amazing, a great start to your day.Also for dog owners, the baristas have a stash of dog treats to spoil your dog and good rails outside to tie up your dog and keep them in sight while you enjoy your coffee.",5.0
"I guess my review didn't post last night. The bartender working last night is extremely rude! Seriously, just get that guy outta there. This is my neighborhood go to and I would hate to switch it up. I simply asked him what song was playing and he was super nasty about it. I was the third patron there, it would have hardly been a hardship for him. Then as I was leaving he remarked on how happy he was that I was taking my leave. He was clearly drunk and just being unnecessarily nasty. Like I said, why would you have someone like that working there. You should clone Austin so that he can work every night. He's awesome!",1.0
"Even though this place serves too much mustard on their dinner hot dog, I can forgive them because the waiters and bartenders are super sweet. Even though I was being a weirdo, drinking a cheap can of Rolling Rock and sketching in my notebook at the bar, and even reading a novel at the bar, no one treated me badly. This is a bar where I can be myself while waiting to meet friends for beers and Heavy Woods hot dogs.",5.0

I popped into this cute little bar yesterday for Sunday brunch with friends. The menu seems small but the food is really tasty. I ordered the fried Catfish Po' Boy and  a biscuit on the side and was so pleased! The fish was well seasoned and I loved the pickled veggies on top. The biscuit was served with some some sort of hot sauce jam and OMG...I need it in mouth again STAT!  Prices seem fair compared to the quality of the food. At $7 a pop I felt that the mimosas were a bit overpriced. I mean...who can really have just one or two mimosas? I'll be skipping them next time in favor of booze. The Asian server/bartender helping us was a sweetheart but seemed a tad overwhelmed as the place filled up. He's cute though so he gets a pass lol. I'll definitely be back for happy hour one of these days.,4.0

"It's hard to find a cafe in Bushwick that isn't overcrowded, obnoxiously hip, or poorly run. Fortunately, I've found one in Heavy Woods.

And major props to the skinny guy with the tats for his warm service and deep knowledge of coffee.  You rock dude!",5.0
"Ordered a few simple, well-known drink they didn't even know how to make but they proceeded to look for a recipe to accommodate the order. I don't want to pay $10 for a drink never made by the bartender that wasn't served right, didn't taste very good, and had no garnish...not even a lime? Overall, high priced drinks that were not good. Cocktail list did look interesting but their classic cocktails on the back menu had no price listing or descriptions for the less popular drinks.It's a beautiful bar but it needs to some time",2.0

Super tiny bar and super loud. I could barely hold a conversation with the person next to me. Not to mention dark as well. We sat there for a while and no one came to offer a menu or help. We had to fetch it ourselves and even then still got poor service. Never going back.,1.0

"I went here for the first time tonight. It's around the corner from my new apartment. I spent six dollars on a Mac and Cheese that was literally slightly larger than a thimble. I finished it in seven bites, so that's about a dollar a bite. It was an adequate mac and cheese, as far as taste goes, but nothing so special (like perhaps pure gold flakes in the cheese) to make one spoonful worthy of identifying as any type of dish., I commented on the portion and was told ""That is technically a side."" Well, even a six dollar side of macaroni should be larger than this. I took a photo. It is less than an inch thick and four inches across. I am somewhat of a foodie and can appreciate gourmet food and portions, but MAC AND CHEESE? Come on. I guess trust fund kids will pay anything for anything.

The bar is classy and yet rustic and still laid back.   There is a great cocktail menu and wonderful beer selection and always good music playing.  I would like a little more seating added to this place and just a heads up:  You will not be able to get a wine.  If you want wine then head over to Bodega which is a cute wine bar owned by the same owners.,4.0

Whatever, it was hot! the coffee I really appreciated. Very good.
