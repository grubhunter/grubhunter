"AlMar surprised me. I'm usually not a fan or skeptical of ""New American"" local rustic organic places. The dishes sound good, but come up short of anything very tasty, fresh, and overpriced. Coworkers rave about their coffee ($1.75 strong & fresh, I've decided) & food. AlMar's located in a block of hip DUMBO of shiny storefront corporate windows. But inside, it's filled with rustic furniture, a carefully curated antique so Brooklyn finds. Once you get past that potential pretensioness, you realize that the employees are incredibly nice, there's 2 giant communal tables (which always seem to be filled by families or local companies meeting over lunch), and Most importantly- the food is Excellent! The price point is very good for the portions and quality of ingredients. During a brunch meeting, I got the Breakfast Sandwich ($12- eggs were fluffy, the bacon was generously sized, the avocado & cheese on it was super fresh, & the brioche bun soft). It came with some mixed greens. I only got through 3/4 of the sandwich.Recently, had a Literally, 2hr lunch there. I had the 2 Eggs over Polenta ($12). It was a 6"" block of finely milled corn flour (best I've had so far) layered with bits of cheddar, tomato, avocado, and eggs (requested over easy), & surrounded by a maot of sautéed spinach. Only got through 3/4 of this as well. Awesome, Fresh, Delicious. I've tried co-worker's Beet & Goat Cheese Salad, Artichoke Tart, & Farro Salad with mint. All were great. We ended the meal with a tiramisu (in a martini cup)  & blueberry panna cotta (in a cup, blue-infused & some berries on top). Both were def cream-heavy, but tasty & apparently made in-house as well. I wouldn't mind trying their panino & soup Lunch Combo & apparently they carry Blue Sky Bakery muffins (carrot with flakes coconut in the middle). Get their to-go coffee (although it's a bit if a wait) instead of that Starbucks down the street, please! Great place in the neighborhood compared to Dumbo Kitchen, not sure about Superfine. Nice high ceilings, great staff & cook!",5.0
"Mediocre and expensive. We were also overcharged and left hungry.We were immediately seated on a weekday night. That was nice. Bread with olive oil came out right away. Boring white bread. Ok, fine, next, whatever. Ordered two cocktails at $11 each. They were fine.Ordered the Duck Prosciutto Crostini and was very disappointed by the portion size. Two crostinis with minuscule amounts of duck on top for $12 - or wait - I'm sorry, the bill came to $16 for those. I only noticed when we were walking home and I was remarking on how expensive the meal was. Can I have my $4 back?Entrees were boring. Raviolis were standard. The Linguine with Manila Clams & Broccoli Rabe for $18 was not worth the money. The clams were very tiny. They were Manilla clams so no big expectations, but the portion was also small. The portions needs to double for $18.At the end we were both annoyed to have spent $100 on food and drink and be left hungry. Then to find we were overcharged on the appetizer sealed the deal. The waiter might also learn to not interrupt conversations.Enough to complain in person about? What am I going to cause a scene about portion size in the restaurant? Of course not. But I will be telling others to go elsewhere as the food is overpriced and the restaurant experience does not make up for it.We ended up eating somewhere else afterwards to actually eat. Also, reminder to check your bill to make sure you're not overcharged. Cash only, too, which was a pain. Go somewhere else.",2.0

"Uncomfortable seating, but very soft service.  Three of us had dinner mid-week, and had no pressure to leave our 4-top, even after having finished our meal.  We were sitting and talking for about 45min after we  had stopped eating and ordering.  Water was re-filled, and no pressure.The food was mehhh.  I had a salad to begin, and the half-chicken as my main course.  The salad was fine, and the chicken was not moist but pretty dry I felt; also, I thought it could do with some more seasoning.  The side-potatoes were tasty.We had wine, and tap-water.Not bad, but not something which stands out for me.  In this neighborhood though, there are limited choices and this might be a nicer option.I didn't pay for this meal (I paid for wines), and note it is cash-only.",3.0
"Lively and bustling at 2:16PM on a Tuesday. Seems like a popular spot for brunch/lunch, as the place was still busy when I walked in. The staff is prompt and pretty friendly. They leave a wine bottle of water at your table so you can refill yourself as needed.Music is at a manageable decibel but on the louder side. The tables are a bit rickety and chairs are worn, lots of wood and very boho. It's run-down, not dirty, but worn and def no frills. The front side of the restaurant is paned, floor to ceiling windows with a direct street view so it's nice to people watch while you dine. Bathroom is fairly clean and in the smaller side, but definitely decent compared to a lot of others I've seen.I ordered the egg toast ($12), though a couple other options off of the lunch menu looked tasty as well.  They offer half portions of items so that you can mix and match if you like and get half salad, half soup, or half sandwich (The half portions range in price from about $5-$9).Egg toast: Presentation could use some work but it was surprisingly tasty. There's a healthy helping of truffle oil, which I appreciate because a lot places skimp on this. Brioche was lightly toasted and the dish wasn't too salty. The asparagus provided a nice contrasting complement in taste and texture to the toast/eggs/fontina cheese. Perfect light lunch before heading out into the cold again. It was surprisingly filling. Note! This place is CASH ONLY!",4.0
"Dinning at Almar was a delectable surprise! Located in the Dumbo area of Brooklyn, it has a chic and cozy atmosphere. The food was just down right amazing, the drinks were perfect every time, and the staff was so nice. I went with my friend and we each ordered two dishes so we could have more of a variety, let me say our palate's were so pleased!!!! You will enjoy it. Lisa M. Brooklyn",5.0
"Decor and Interior true to the Brooklyn vibe.  Baby and kid friendly; great for large groups (with a reservation).  Brunch menu options are loaded with seemingly fresh ingredients.  What we ordered: - Smoked salmon panino - so flavorful and fresh! Loved the combination of the smoked salmon with the beets and the avocado.  Loved it on the pumpernickel bread as well. - Egg in a cloud - neat presentation, however if you're hungry opt for something a bit more filling (like the egg toast)- Egg Toast - a definite stand out! This dish was absolute perfection. Cooked with truffle oil however wasn't too overwhelming.  The asparagus was a perfect complement.  Having something green on your plate after eating essentially cheese baked on top of an amazing brioche makes you feel better ;)Polenta with sausage - This dish was average.  Polenta by itself was flavorless but was better eating it with the sausage. Overall you won't feel gross and heavy after brunching here.  I will be back to try their dinner!",4.0
"Like the rest of Brooklyn/DUMBO, this place is super hip.  ""Geeky"" cool eye-glasses wearing, skinny @$$ waiter attended to myself and my lunching partner for the day... with too-cool-for-school (aesthetically anyway) tatted up hostess greeting patrons upon their entry.I must mention that the interior is super impressive.  It would be right at home if you dug up this joint and set it upon a Tuscan hilltop.  Big windows for sunlight to stream in, rustic wooden finishes on the furniture, lots of metal and glass adorning the bar... aesthetically pleasing to say the least.Skinny @$$ waiter attempted to sell the ""last dish of its kind"" to me and my lunch partner.  Some kind of pasta course, and skinny waiter stressed that ""there was only one left in the kitchen.""  A hard pass from me, as the mix and match sandwich lunch special looked particularly tantalizing, particularly the aptly named ""pork sandwich.""Alas, while there was but one pasta dish left in the kitchen, there were no more pork sandwiches available for public consumption.  Not much else caught my eye in the way that the pork sandwich did, but I decided on the polar opposite (as far as protein goes) and went with smoked salmon between two slices of pumpernickel.The portions of salmon were too stingy in my eyes, but appropriate I guess for the hood we were in.  As far as taste goes, it was pleasant (kinda hard to eff up salmon).  The texture though left plenty to be desired.  Despite the efforts of the red onion and cucumber in the 'wich, no doubt done in an effort to add a bit of crunch, the sandwich was just soft on soft on soft (creme fraiche, salmon, untoasted bread).  Easiest fix???  Toast the bread.The food can add an extra one star (or even two) if it were more than just satisfactory.  Other than that, I am more than willing to come back to this joint, for a bit of redemption to take place, and for there to be pork sandwiches available for my consumption.",3.0
"Really nice place for brunch/lunch in Dumbo after walking across the bridge!  My sister had the BLT, which she said was hands-down the best BLT she has ever had.  I had a lovely lentil soup and half-salad portion as part of the lunch special.  It was very tasty, but I wished the portions were a bit bigger.We sat at big communal tables perfect for people watching and enjoying the nice atmosphere.Service was a bit hit-or-miss; the waiter seemed to be quite overwhelmed serving multiple tables, and I had to keep asking for coffee refills -- I need like several barrels of coffee to get going, so maybe this is on me.",4.0
CASH ONLYWent here for dinner with a few friends .  If you are looking for high quality food at a decent price in the heart of dumbo then you will want to hit this place up.This restaurant has a really nice decor and atmosphere.  The way they have it arranged makes the seating feel intimate without feeling overly crowded.  They always have a cool old move playing in the back on a projected on the way. Even though there is no audio it adds to the experience.  The restaurant is fairly dimly lit.They have a decent draft selection and make above average cocktails.  Pasta dishes will run you around ~$18 and full entrees somewhere in the mid To upper 20's.  The portion size are medium to small but dishes are full of flavor and well plated.  Meals are served with fresh sliced bread and olive oil.Overall I think you can't go wrong if you are looking for a good place to entertain but you can find better restaurants in the area.,4.0
"I have mixed feelings about my experience here. We went in right at opening on a Sunday for brunch. We were most interested in trying the famous egg in a cloud. But the oven wasn't hot enough for the chef to make it. So we ordered other meals. I could tell that my meal should have been good but it was cold. Everyone else's was hot so idk why mine wasn't. I was ready to give a lower review but just as we finished, they brought us out a free egg in a cloud. The incredibly niceness of the staff, the delicious coffee, and the unique menu earned this place a better review. I would go again in the hopes of a warmer meal.",4.0

"Stopped here for a quick lunch. Got a cup of soup to go for over $5. Umm... I think they forgot to fill the container.  This is not a glass of wine where you use a huge glass for four ounces. If you are going to charge that much for soup splurge for the correct size container so we don't feel cheated. Had I known, I would have gone a few doors down and got organic soup for $3.95- filled to the brim. What a disappointment!! Perhaps dinner is better. But I'm scared to try.

Both bar tenders were friendly and helpful with tips about local sights and music. There is really nothing in DC that has impressed me in quite the same way.

"The service was beyond excellent. Everyone from the hostess to our waiter were super friendly and super attentive. Our waiter (Josh, I believe) was perfectly attentive and always managed to check in on us at just the right time without being intrusive at all. We ordered and shared the baby octopus appetizer which was simply amazing. It comes warm over slightly lower than room temperature potatoes and cold, ceviche like onions and olives right under that. The combination of all the textures and flavors was simply incredible. We loved this dish and wish there was more. It's easy enough for 1 person to eat it all, but since we both ordered pasta dishes for our main course we figured we could share it and it ended up being just right. I had the linguini special which included seafood and it was amazing. The chef took equal amounts of shrimp, mussels and some squid and distributed them evenly across the dish. The portions were just right. To end, we ordered the Tiramisu and it was divine. It came in a martini glass which was a sexy touch, and it was rich, delicious and just enough for both of us to share. All in all, it was a 4.5 star experience. I took .5 of a star off because the music was so random. We heard some salsa and merengue and although we like both, we feel that the music should reflect the cuisine as well as the dishes and inspiration of the overall restaurant. Apart from that, amazing time. Thanks to the staff and the chef for a stellar evening.",4.0
This place has all the worst things about NYC restaurants. Over-priced and mediocre food. We had high hopes based on the Yelp reviews but seriously what was everyone else thinking? The egg in a cloud dish was bland. The panini bread was just okay. Honestly I feel like I've had the same kind of food from a convenience store. The only saving grace was the cappuccino which is what the second star is for. Really wish we had spent that 60$ on something worthwhile.,2.0

"We went to AlMar for brunch, and were (sadly) disappointed in both the food and the pricing. Bloody Mary's were good - a nice kick, but not overpowering - but were about half the size of a traditional one and double the price. After seeing that the bartender used rail vodka for the drink, I'm really not impressed by the $12 per drink price tag. We all had variations of egg/sauteed spinach/smoked salmon dishes. None were particularly inventive, and my friend's $16 special was literally 2 eggs over easy on top of sauteed spinach.

Great food! It was a bit loud inside but not too terrible. Strolled in on a Sunday around 2/230 and there was a 10-15 minute wait. Not a fan of the coffee here but the omelette special of the day was good and the Panino Di Verdura was amazing. Super fresh ingredients--you can really taste the difference.

"AlMar is one of my favorite Italian restaurants. The environment of the restaurant is very inviting, the lighting is fairly low, the ceilings are high creating an open atmosphere and the decor is homey with a touch of rustic. During dinner they projected the 1920 silent film ""Zorro"" on the back wall. It seemed like a nice little touch to make the place unique.But what really stands out is the phenomenal food. To start with they bring out bread for the table with a high quality olive oil. We opted to also start with a bottle of wine. We went with the Bardolino, which came in a one liter bottle for 25 dollars. It was an enjoyable wine, and at 25 dollars it was a tremendous value.The menus change daily, which is a perk and shows the creativity of the chefs as well as the use of seasonal ingredients. If the cured salmon crostini is on the menu when you are there, make sure to get it. It is only two little bites for 12 dollars, but those two bites are tremendous. The crostini is ""Vodka & Beets House Cured Salmon with Avocado & Crème Fraîche."" The beets give the salmon a beautiful color like that of raw beef, and the texture of the fish melts in your mouth. Combined with the chewiness of the bread, the creamy fat of the avocado and the tang of the crème fraîche it all came together perfectly, with the flavors all melding together.For my entree I ordered the pappardelle. The noodles were some of the best I've had in some time, and the combination of mushrooms that came with the dish were great. The sauce had truffle oil in it, and was subtle but very nice.I also thought the service was quite good. They don't rush you through the meal, letting you take your time and enjoy yourself even though the restaurant is quite busy. I will definitely be back here.",5.0
"Almar is a quaint Italian restaurant amdist the cobble streets of Dumbo that I discovered with a few other Yelpers randomly one evening. Even though we showed up really late following a YEE (Yelp elite event for any newbs) they welcomed us in... Yaye they accepted our cult! We got a bottle of red wine (why wouldn't we even though we had just had 10 free cocktails earlier) and in true Italian fashion, I had me some spaghetti with a marinara pepper sauce and lamb meatballs.So good. If I can ever find my way back here (cause let's face it, I can get lost in Dumbo quite easily), I will definitely stop in for a bite and some vino!",4.0

"I came here for a coffee and for lunch on the same day. This place is a hot spot for those in need of a good simple and quick lunch. The place seems to most often be jammed for lunch.

"Mediocre food. Poor service. No credit cards. We had the fig bruschetta, the cod and short ribs. The short ribs were the only dish that had flavor. The server, Danny, was so poor, he barely spoke to us and treated us like we were a burden. The fact that this place doesn't accept credit card for their price point is very short sighted.

"I'm not a big Brooklyn fan because it just seems so far from everything to this die hard Queens/Manhattan chick. But still, certain parts of this boro holds a special place in my heart, thus Dumbo area being one of them.Had a lovely time at AlMar! Host was very sweet and so accommodating when our 3rd dinner partner showed up a tad bit late and we had to move to the table right next to us that could accommodate all of us. Food was very good, presentation for our first course was nice but for the pasta entrees a bit lack luster but still delicious. We started with a few specials of the night, a fresh burrata with heirloom tomato quarters and a few sprigs of romaine, lightly dressed veggies with the creamy burrata was delicious; the chilled asparagus salad with orange segments, pecorino cheese and a sprinkling of toasted almonds was very very refreshing; also had the grilled octopus serving with fingerling potatoes and olives...the octopus was unfortunately very tough but the accompanying potatoes and olives simply dressed in olive oil and were delicious. For our entrees we ordered a mezzi rigatoni in a delicious sausage tomato ragu and also a potato gnocchi dressed in a braised short rib sauce. The gnocchi were melt in your mouth amazing and the sauce was not as heavy as I had expected and accompanied these yummy little puffs of potato goodness perfectly. For dessert we had a flourless chocolate mousse cake that was pure heaven. Our server was super easy to work with and really easy going and not hovering. The decor is very rustic and simple, but at times the noise level was ear piercingly loud so it was hard to talk amongst my group of 3.  Still a solid place for a group or a date night.Would have given 5 stars but one got knocked off because it's CASH ONLY!!!!",4.0

"Former talents from Brooklyn Heights' Noodle Pudding, another one of my favorites and definitely worthy of a visit, bring their genuine sense of hospitality and passion for honest Italian fare to Dumbo. There's something for everyone, and while the menu doesn't change a whole lot from day to day, I've still been coming here 3-4 times per month for the last 3 years. It's that good. Start with a rotating selection of cheeses and cured meats, then move on to Alfredo's Meatballs. For your main dish, you can't go wrong with any of the handmade pastas, and definitely try the prociutto-stuffed pork chop or whole Bronzino if they're on the menu. Vegetarians out there will be impressed by the Kale salad, which completely blew this die-hard carnivore away.

"Came to DUMBO for a light show and got recs from a DUMBO native about this cute eatery.  Decor is warm interior wood tables with industrial lofted space.  The menu is mostly Italian with apps, pastas and main entrees.

The winner was the grilled whole octopus and the roasted red pepper bruschetta.  The whole octopus was fresh, perfectly grilled and totally tasty. The roasted red pepper bruschetta surprised us all as being flavorful and delicious.  The other dishes were nothing special or amazing.   For my main, I got the special with the pork shank cooked down with a white wine and fennel reduction sauce and it was AMAZING. Tender succulent bits of pork falling off the bone while bathed with the rice fennel sauce was delicious. I also tried the Tagliatelle with duck and olives but it was average.

Can't say enough good things about this place. Owners are just wonderful people who are absolutely welcoming. The food is really authentic and is has a unique southern italian fare that you don't often find in most italian establishments in NY. Highly recommend!,5.0
"AlMar is off-the-charts fantastic. Between the relaxed, inviting aptmosphere, wonderful service, delicious food, and well-stocked bar, you really can't go wrong. Not to mention, they offer brunch/breakfast until 4 pm, daily, along with their lunch menu. As for the dinner, Alberto, the chef (and one of my all-time favorite beings), whips up a new menu, everyday. Confession: I was actually the hostess at AlMar, for quite a while. However, instead causing bias, I feel that my experience and familiarity with AlMar only makes me more qualified to provide critique. After all, as a result, I happen to be very familiar with the staff (honest to god, some of the kindest people, who genuinely care about their customers), behind the scenes stuff (everything is super clean & well-maintained), and most importantly, the items on the menu that you NEED to try...Brunch: Egg Toast - - (two words: truffle. oil.) & BACON, + a Bloody Mary.Lunch: (Alberto's) Meatball Parm Panino --THIS sandwich ruined me for all others--Dinner: sorry, can't pick a favorite... just ask what Alberto reccomends, trust me, you won't be sorry. Desert: their Tiramisu, served in a martini glass, is fantastic... and I don't even like tiramisu.Espresso/Coffee: It's damn good, and the bartender/barista will make you just about whatever you'd like.... also, is it just me, or has it become increasingly difficult to get a decent, let alone GOOD, cup of coffee these days? To be fair, I suppose I should mention the one thing most customers aren't thrilled about, which is that AlMar is a cash-only establishment.**HOWEVER, there is an ATM inside the restaurant!!

"My friends and I decided to check out the DUMBO area for lunch, and we had found this place on Yelp.  Granted, a few of their dishes were good (great presentation on the Egg in a Cloud), which is why I am giving it two stars.  However, my Old-Fashioned Breakfast was a huge disappointment, especially since I only requested the eggs sunny-side up and it was overcooked.  I've got to admit that I can probably cook better eggs myself.  What really threw me off was the service of the place.  I hate to say this, but my entire party felt like we were being discriminated against.  Our waiter came (and it looked like he'd rather be anywhere but at work) and took our order without even telling us there were specials or even showing a slight hint of a smile.  It took at least 10 minutes to get our cranberry juice and tea, and then perhaps another 30 minutes before we all received our dishes.  Our water bottle didn't get replaced until I literally had to get up and request it myself at the bar.  When the food came out, the waiter said ""the Egg in the Cloud"" takes longer because it needs to bake"", which of course, we understand that, but could you have told us that while taking our order and then ask us if we'd prefer to wait for all the dishes to come out together?  Holy guacamole, we were starving already, and I know for a fact that my friends wouldn't mind each other pigging out first and sharing dishes while we wait.Then, I see our waiter taking orders with other customers, and he definitely had the peachiest smile on his face and was chatting them up.  Sorry, dude, but if you're going to act all peachy and stuff, you better act like that to EVERYONE.  I might not be fair in taking this all out on the waiter, so let me add this, too - the hostess forgot about us and seated another party before us.  She seemed sweet and all, but learn to manage the wait list, please.  It's not exactly rocket science.Overall, would I go back?  Ehh, perhaps...if my friends wanted to go, but I better get a different waiter this time.  I will say that I did like the ambience (I love the floor to ceiling windows.)  I'll probably also order the Egg in a Cloud or some other salad dishes I saw from the Yelp photos.  But, if I'm just walking around DUMBO myself, I'll pass and check out a different restaurant.  My review might sound harsh, but then again, would you rather I lie or sugarcoat things just for ratings' sake?  Yeah, I thought not...",2.0
"Noted: - delicious smell of seafood upon entering - attractive decor- crowd was mostly AARP, but that could have been the pre-theater hourAte: - salad of arugula with beets, orange, pistachios - fresh, crisp, delicious- appetizer of mussels in white wine sauce - plump, juicy, also deliciousI did not get to try the linguine with seafood, which I attempted to order; my friend Tardy McTarderson was 15 minutes late, and the waiter was told by the chef that putting in an entree order at 7:05 would put into jeopardy our 8pm curtain a few blocks away. I realize this isn't fast food, but we were surprised that all but two of their entrees (short rib and lasagna) can't be produced and consumed within the confines of an hour. We were thus limited to those two entrees or apps, salads, or crostini. In the end, I really liked my salad and mussels, and I left with a favorable impression in spite of myself.CASH ONLY!",4.0

"Excellent food and a friendly atmosphere. Four of us shared some appetizer plates of grilled octopus, fried stuffed zucchini flowers and a mixed cold antipasto platter. Everything was great although the zucchini flowers and the grilled octopus plates were small portions; not really meant for sharing more than 2 people. Pasta dishes were all delicious. My linguine with tomato sauce, grape tomatoes, mussels, clams, shrimp and squid was just like my mom would make. The spaghetti with arugula and avocado pesto & shrimp was very garlicky and tasty. We didn't have any main courses. The desserts (tiramisu', panna cotta and affogato gelato with espresso) were really good too. A bottle, actually two, of Prosecco wine completed a fine meal.The atmosphere is fun and lively. The wood tables and benches are interesting as long as you're not sitting on those benches too long. They are a bit hard and uncomfortable to sit at for a long time. I would return here for dinner or possibly a nice weekend brunch to take in the nearby views on the water.",4.0
"Found Almar by chance. Just walking along Front street.  It is a lovely place.  Simple decor, shabby chic, but really well tied up.  Sat at the bar.  Bartenders are very friendly and attentive.  I ordered the egg in a cloud. It is something like I have never tried before. Great twist on a french toast with ham and this cloud of egg white with the perfectly warmed up yolk in the middle.  A bit of spinach as a garnish.

"Almar is an affordable, delicious brunch option in DUMBO. Casual walk in, cute space with an assortment of small and large communal tables. Service is friendly and attentive, at least at this hour of the day. There will be people with babies most likely. So if you have an allergic reaction to strollers you may want to steer clear. The Egg in a Cloud is awesome. They make a light as air, fluffy egg white supporting a baked yolk while pairing it with smokey ham and fontina. The Almar Breakfast Sandwich isn't breaking any new ground, but it's far superior to most Egg/Meat/Cheese breakfast sandwiches you will encounter due to the ingredients used. If you veer towards the sweeter side in the morning (or just want dessert), they also have a Nutella Panini which should not be missed. Solid Brunch Cocktails that extend beyond the usual Bloody Mary also round out a good morning selection. Will return and plan to check out for dinner.",4.0

The food is hit or miss, oftentimes, most of the stuff that comes out of the kitchen isn't particularly hot, and lacking flavor. The service is really what makes this place awful.

"Loved the Egg Cloud!  The ""soup-bowl sized"" coffee cup was fantastic and the rustic atmosphere and good service was perfect for a Sunday brunch.  Also have been there late afternoon but before 6:00 so they had the same brunch/lunch menu.  I feel like I have just scratched the surface and it has definitely piqued my interest for a return trip there for dinner.",4.0
"My friends and I decided to check out the DUMBO area for lunch, and we had found this place on Yelp.  Granted, a few of their dishes were good (great presentation on the Egg in a Cloud), which is why I am giving it two stars.  However, my Old-Fashioned Breakfast was a huge disappointment, especially since I only requested the eggs sunny-side up and it was overcooked.  I've got to admit that I can probably cook better eggs myself.  What really threw me off was the service of the place.  I hate to say this, but my entire party felt like we were being discriminated against.  Our waiter came (and it looked like he'd rather be anywhere but at work) and took our order without even telling us there were specials or even showing a slight hint of a smile.  It took at least 10 minutes to get our cranberry juice and tea, and then perhaps another 30 minutes before we all received our dishes.  Our water bottle didn't get replaced until I literally had to get up and request it myself at the bar.  When the food came out, the waiter said ""the Egg in the Cloud"" takes longer because it needs to bake"", which of course, we understand that, but could you have told us that while taking our order and then ask us if we'd prefer to wait for all the dishes to come out together?  Holy guacamole, we were starving already, and I know for a fact that my friends wouldn't mind each other pigging out first and sharing dishes while we wait.Then, I see our waiter taking orders with other customers, and he definitely had the peachiest smile on his face and was chatting them up.  Sorry, dude, but if you're going to act all peachy and stuff, you better act like that to EVERYONE.  I might not be fair in taking this all out on the waiter, so let me add this, too - the hostess forgot about us and seated another party before us.  She seemed sweet and all, but learn to manage the wait list, please.  It's not exactly rocket science.Overall, would I go back?  Ehh, perhaps...if my friends wanted to go, but I better get a different waiter this time.  I will say that I did like the ambience (I love the floor to ceiling windows.)  I'll probably also order the Egg in a Cloud or some other salad dishes I saw from the Yelp photos.  But, if I'm just walking around DUMBO myself, I'll pass and check out a different restaurant.  My review might sound harsh, but then again, would you rather I lie or sugarcoat things just for ratings' sake?  Yeah, I thought not...",2.0
"Noted: - delicious smell of seafood upon entering - attractive decor- crowd was mostly AARP, but that could have been the pre-theater hourAte: - salad of arugula with beets, orange, pistachios - fresh, crisp, delicious- appetizer of mussels in white wine sauce - plump, juicy, also deliciousI did not get to try the linguine with seafood, which I attempted to order; my friend Tardy McTarderson was 15 minutes late, and the waiter was told by the chef that putting in an entree order at 7:05 would put into jeopardy our 8pm curtain a few blocks away. I realize this isn't fast food, but we were surprised that all but two of their entrees (short rib and lasagna) can't be produced and consumed within the confines of an hour. We were thus limited to those two entrees or apps, salads, or crostini. In the end, I really liked my salad and mussels, and I left with a favorable impression in spite of myself.CASH ONLY!",4.0

"Excellent food and a friendly atmosphere. Four of us shared some appetizer plates of grilled octopus, fried stuffed zucchini flowers and a mixed cold antipasto platter. Everything was great although the zucchini flowers and the grilled octopus plates were small portions; not really meant for sharing more than 2 people. Pasta dishes were all delicious. My linguine with tomato sauce, grape tomatoes, mussels, clams, shrimp and squid was just like my mom would make. The spaghetti with arugula and avocado pesto & shrimp was very garlicky and tasty. We didn't have any main courses. The desserts (tiramisu', panna cotta and affogato gelato with espresso) were really good too. A bottle, actually two, of Prosecco wine completed a fine meal.The atmosphere is fun and lively. The wood tables and benches are interesting as long as you're not sitting on those benches too long. They are a bit hard and uncomfortable to sit at for a long time. I would return here for dinner or possibly a nice weekend brunch to take in the nearby views on the water.",4.0
"Found Almar by chance. Just walking along Front street.  It is a lovely place.  Simple decor, shabby chic, but really well tied up.  Sat at the bar.  Bartenders are very friendly and attentive.  I ordered the egg in a cloud.

"So i went here with two more people for a random weekday dinner. No reservations needed for the weekday but I have to admit, place was quite packed for a weekday. Rustic and innovative yet casual. I was pretty impressed with their idea of projecting a classic movie on one of the blank white wall( obviously noone was watching it).So we ordered 3 Antipasti between 3 of us. Their portions are pretty small for an italian place actually. We had stuffed zucchini flowers- totally bland, no flavour. Then we had the roasted pepper bruschetta and the ricotta crostini. Loved the bruschetta. So flavorful. Crostinis were ok. As i said portions were small, we got only 3 zucchini flowers, 2 small crostinis and 2 avg sized bruschetta. Then we ordered eggplant parm and fusilli in ricotta sauce pasta to share between 3 of us since we werent that hungry. Eggplant was absolute delish. Lots of basil and herbs. Pasta was just ok too. For dessert tiramisu was the obv choice and let's say it was finished within the min, that's how good it was.

"Hands down one of mine and the boy's favorite places to frequent. We actually accidentally stumbled upon this place and have just kept coming back. I've been here for lunch, dinner and drinks. The bruschette are really delicious (my favorite is the ricotta with honey and truffle oil) and they haven't missed with any of the pasta dishes I've had. The cocktails are also great, my favorite being the Italian Sour (a twist on a whiskey sour). I also love the decor: simple with wood and metal elements.

The lasagna here is fantastic. You can definitely tell that it was made with fresh pasta. The meatball dish was bland other than an overpowering basil taste.

"Great food, but some of the worst service I've experienced in NY. Went on a Saturday night, called ahead and were told that we had missed the cutoff for reservations but that the wait was usually about 20 minutes on a busy night. We showed up, were asked to wait as they set up a table for three (the number of people in our party) and then told the table  for 3 was already reserved and were asked to return in 45 minutes. No problem. I offered my phone number to the hostess, as is typical of  small places with no room to wait, and was told that she ""would call if [she] remembers to, but it gets busy and [she] forgets"" so I wasn't too confident. We returned in 45 minutes on the dot and were ignored by both the manager and the hostess for a couple of minutes before we were told that we would have to wait an additional 5-10 minutes. All fine, we went to the (very small) bar, where menus were literally thrown at us by the bartender before we were told that we could not wait at the bar because the seats were all reserved. At this point, we were ready to leave, but our table was finally ready, so we sat. We ordered the meatballs and the octopus salad, both of which were excellent. My dining companions both ordered fantastic pasta dishes and I ordered the braised lamb.  All of our meals were superb. The braised lamb was tender and the portion was huge. I was complete happy with the food itself. The server was very short with us, and never greeted or checked on us during the meal, which is something I have come to expect at restaurants of this caliber.  I NEVER ask to see a manager, but I was so worked up by that point that I did. The manager came over and proceeded to blame us for not having a reservation. We paid (cash only) and left, unhappy with out choice of restaurant. The food is excellent but this place needs a serious overhaul of management and service style. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone without it.",2.0
"2.5 Stars, but I will give you the benefit of the doubt... Their food is decent, I have had to send things back but they were corrected. The staff is nice, never had an issue there. The real reason this place aggravates me is they do no accept credit cards. Come on AlMar, you are a large, full service restaurant their is no excuse why you should not accept plastic, its RIDICULOUS!! It just seems arrogant.. Dumbo is in such need of restaurant competition, this is why these places are still pulling crap like this, because they know there are very limited options for sit down restaurants.

The panne cotta was definitely lacking - way too sweet, don't recommend it. If they brought their food up to the look of the place they would be solid! But because it was just decent and still pricy, I'm going with a three over all. Also, take advantage of their buy-one-get-one-free happy hour, if you arrive just before six (but beware, the kitchen doesn't open until 6).",3.0
"Food was great and fast but service, atmosphere and crowd (Friday night) was horrible. Wouldn't recommend.",3.0
"This place is amazing! There were five of us, and all we had was really tasty and felt very healthy. The pork sandwich, the salmon sandwich and the soup of the day were our favorites. We will definitely come back!",5.0
"Restaurants with entrees at $20+ really need to take credit cards.  This place has decent food, I just find the cash-only policy to be totally unacceptable in 2014, and a huge inconvenience to customers.",3.0
"My wife and I live in Dumbo.  This is our favorite restaurant.  The food is fantastic and plenty of options.  I almost always order the branzino and one of the bruschette.  Marcello and Alfredo are the owners -- super nice and accommodating.  If you are looking for a comfortable scene and delicious food without any pretense, I suggest you hit up Al Mar.",5.0
The lasagna here is fantastic. You can definitely tell that it was made with fresh pasta. The meatball dish was bland other than an overpowering basil taste. The staff was attentive and above average. The bar menu was definitely made by an amateur. A few of the single malts were listed incorrectly in relationship to what they actually had (which wasn't much) the wine selection was also below average. Three stars because the lasagne dish was that good.,3.0
"Great food, but some of the worst service I've experienced in NY. Went on a Saturday night, called ahead and were told that we had missed the cutoff for reservations but that the wait was usually about 20 minutes on a busy night. We showed up, were asked to wait as they set up a table for three (the number of people in our party) and then told the table  for 3 was already reserved and were asked to return in 45 minutes. No problem. I offered my phone number to the hostess, as is typical of  small places with no room to wait, and was told that she ""would call if [she] remembers to, but it gets busy and [she] forgets"" so I wasn't too confident. We returned in 45 minutes on the dot and were ignored by both the manager and the hostess for a couple of minutes before we were told that we would have to wait an additional 5-10 minutes. All fine, we went to the (very small) bar, where menus were literally thrown at us by the bartender before we were told that we could not wait at the bar because the seats were all reserved. At this point, we were ready to leave, but our table was finally ready, so we sat. We ordered the meatballs and the octopus salad, both of which were excellent. My dining companions both ordered fantastic pasta dishes and I ordered the braised lamb.  All of our meals were superb. The braised lamb was tender and the portion was huge. I was complete happy with the food itself. The server was very short with us, and never greeted or checked on us during the meal, which is something I have come to expect at restaurants of this caliber.  I NEVER ask to see a manager, but I was so worked up by that point that I did. The manager came over and proceeded to blame us for not having a reservation. We paid (cash only) and left, unhappy with out choice of restaurant. The food is excellent but this place needs a serious overhaul of management and service style. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone without it.",2.0
"2.5 Stars, but I will give you the benefit of the doubt... Their food is decent, I have had to send things back but they were corrected. The staff is nice, never had an issue there. The real reason this place aggravates me is they do no accept credit cards. Come on AlMar, you are a large, full service restaurant their is no excuse why you should not accept plastic, its RIDICULOUS!! It just seems arrogant.. Dumbo is in such need of restaurant competition, this is why these places are still pulling crap like this, because they know there are very limited options for sit down restaurants. Its a decent spot just make sure you have cash in hand..",3.0

"We are out-of-towers staying in Dumbo for a week, and searched for Italian in Dumbo.

"What does AlMar do really well? Simplicity & freshness in Italian food. That was what we really wanted that night, and that was what we got. The place feels laid back, and on the weeknight when we were there is wasn't too busy, we didn't have to wait for a table. On the back wall of the restaurant they silently play black & white films, and the space  is attractive and comfortable - sort of rustic-chic. The tables are fairly close together (we enjoyed a bit of table eavesdropping during the evening). Cocktails to start: an Italian sour and a Camparini; both were excellent. Then there was the anchovy bruschetta, and for entrees, a special - a mini-meatballs pasta, and the pappardelle with delightful green things (asparagus, peas, fava beans). Normally we avoid ordering pasta when out, since it's so easy to do at home, but this time we were glad we did. The dishes were not too oily and tasted very fresh. The fava beans pasta gave us ideas for things we could cook at home.

"After spending the day at the BBG and Bklyn Museum, we showed up hungry and unaware that it was still 30 min. before dinner service started. We snagged a table anyway and enjoyed 1/2 priced happy hour drinks until they started dinner service. We ordered crostini to share, my friend made a dinner out of the meatballs and the arugula and fennel salad while I had the pappardelle w/ duck ragu.Crostini w/ mascarpone and pecorino romano, topped w/ honey and walnut. At first sight, the two crostini look small. Then you pick them up and feel the heft and weight. Smooth mascarpone, tangy and tender pecorino and just enough honey to hint at sweetness w/o being intrusive. It was flavorful and balanced.Meatballs in sauce were tangy and bright. I still think Sora Lella's was the best, but these aren't bad. You get two decent sized meatballs to an order. Fennel salad: argula, fennel, orange and pecorino romano. Peppery, buttery, bright and refreshing. The only misfire were the oddly flavorless green olives.Pappardelle w/ braised duck and shiitake mushroom ragu. The pasta wasn't al dente, but the sauce was flavorful and the dish itself came w/ a generous portion of tender duck. The duck itself was just gamey enough to remind you it was duck. Tiramisu: the lady fingers tasted of strong espresso and were still tender w/o being mushy. The mascarpone dusted w/ cocoa was slightly sweet, possibly from vin santo. Served chilled in a martini glass.tl;dr: Come in and enjoy the space and the food.Note: bring cash cuz they don't take credit cards.",4.0

It didn't particularly taste great, but it probably was about what I expected. My girlfriend had the black linguine and thoroughly enjoyed it, commenting a few times on how good it tasted.

We've been going to Almar for four years since it opened (we live across the street). It has only gotten better and better. Just had Alfredo's spaghetti and meatballs - to die for.

"I am a very picky eater, but I can't say one negative thing about AlMar. It is the best local spot in Dumbo that I have been able to find. I seriously love it. I could eat their Kale salad for breakfast lunch and dinner, I'm not kidding. Even though they are cash only and it takes a few extra minutes to get certain things like Eggs In a Cloud, it is totally worth it. Every dish I have had at AlMar leaves me wanting to come back for more. There lunch menu is awesome, and its great that they have a totally different dinner menu because that means I can come back for seconds. Each server, bar tender, and hostess is so nice and helpful! I really love this place and would recommend it to every local! Just remember to bring cash, but if not they have an ATM in the back which is very convenient! I'm not sure why people complain about it being cash only, this is New York people everywhere is cash only! Thats what makes the city so different. Anyways, enjoy!!",4.0
"After spending the day at the BBG and Bklyn Museum, we showed up hungry and unaware that it was still 30 min. before dinner service started. We snagged a table anyway and enjoyed 1/2 priced happy hour drinks until they started dinner service. We ordered crostini to share, my friend made a dinner out of the meatballs and the arugula and fennel salad while I had the pappardelle w/ duck ragu.Crostini w/ mascarpone and pecorino romano, topped w/ honey and walnut. At first sight, the two crostini look small. Then you pick them up and feel the heft and weight. Smooth mascarpone, tangy and tender pecorino and just enough honey to hint at sweetness w/o being intrusive. It was flavorful and balanced.Meatballs in sauce were tangy and bright. I still think Sora Lella's was the best, but these aren't bad. You get two decent sized meatballs to an order. Fennel salad: argula, fennel, orange and pecorino romano. Peppery, buttery, bright and refreshing. The only misfire were the oddly flavorless green olives.Pappardelle w/ braised duck and shiitake mushroom ragu. The pasta wasn't al dente, but the sauce was flavorful and the dish itself came w/ a generous portion of tender duck. The duck itself was just gamey enough to remind you it was duck. Tiramisu: the lady fingers tasted of strong espresso and were still tender w/o being mushy. The mascarpone dusted w/ cocoa was slightly sweet, possibly from vin santo. Served chilled in a martini glass.tl;dr: Come in and enjoy the space and the food.Note: bring cash cuz they don't take credit cards.",4.0
"When visiting AlMar, I was expecting the waiters and waitresses to be inattentive like I had read in some reviews here on Yelp, but I didn't experience any issues. The food was good. We had the whipped ricotta crostini with mascarpone, parmigiano, walnuts and honey. It was very tasty. For my dinner, I had the swordfish. It was a fairly large portion, so that was nice to see. It didn't particularly taste great, but it probably was about what I expected. My girlfriend had the black linguine and thoroughly enjoyed it, commenting a few times on how good it tasted. We were satisfied with all of the service and our bottle of wine, and will likely be coming back at some point in the future.",4.0
"I came here immediately after work because I was dying to try it out and heard how good it was. I was anxious for good food, friendly service and such.Unfortunately, when I arrived, the Chicken Marsala was extremely undercooked, however the service was very accommodating in taking it off the bill and giving me tiramisu which was just okay.",3.0
"I went with a friend to AlMar for Saturday brunch...I was expecting maybe one pasta dish at this Italian restaurant.  I really wanted some yummy pasta carbs.  But no, the menu was mostly a variety of paninos (not paninis...paninos), all of which sounded very good, but still I was underwhelmed.  Our waiter was almost pained to serve us...it was so odd.  We had one question about the specials and it was like we had asked him to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge.  He was very disinterested in us and in the restaurant.  But at least the food was really good...I opted for the Egg Toast and it was yummy and filing.  The brunch pricing is very reasonable, with most items costing $10.  I would absolutely go back, since the restaurant is near my home and very cute inside...plus I want to try a pasta dinner dish!",3.0
"I've been here a few times and everything is always really great. Their meatballs and ricotta crostini are really yummy! I crave their shrimp cocktail with avocado.Most recently, we ordered ribs and pasta with clams. They were both simple and delicious. The ribs were really rich and tasted stew-like. Even though it is not a rowdy crowd, the place gets pretty noisy-so it's not the place to go if you're looking for a quiet dinner (on the weekend at least).",4.0

"Been living in Brooklyn 6 years and don't cook too much .. so we eat out a lot and this is the best all-around restaurant we've found in the boro.  It is the absolute ""go-to"" for brunch, lunch or dinner. Al-fredo and Mar-cello serve ""foodie""-quality dishes without the ""foodie"" pretentiousness or the ""foodie"" over-pricedness.  The waitstaff is friendly, and they have have a great wine, beer and cocktail selection.If you're there for brunch, the BLT is amazing -- and you can also ask them to add an egg.  The salads are delicious as well.  Lastly, don't miss the Tiramisu if it's on the dessert menu that night.  Cash only but this place won't break your piggy bank either.",5.0
"It's a brunch place in downtown Brooklyn that actually lets you make reservations.  If that didn't sell you then I will also add that the food is very good.  It's cozy, its comfortable, it's inviting and did I mention they take reservations?  If you want to go to brunch with a big group, this is the place to do it.",4.0
We've been going to Almar for four years since it opened (we live across the street). It has only gotten better and better. Just had Alfredo's spaghetti and meatballs - to die for. I go often for breakfast and usually get the Old Fashioned which I love. The coffee remains out of this world. Truly great spot!,5.0
"I am a very picky eater, but I can't say one negative thing about AlMar. It is the best local spot in Dumbo that I have been able to find. I seriously love it. I could eat their Kale salad for breakfast lunch and dinner, I'm not kidding. Even though they are cash only and it takes a few extra minutes to get certain things like Eggs In a Cloud, it is totally worth it. Every dish I have had at AlMar leaves me wanting to come back for more. There lunch menu is awesome, and its great that they have a totally different dinner menu because that means I can come back for seconds. Each server, bar tender, and hostess is so nice and helpful! I really love this place and would recommend it to every local! Just remember to bring cash, but if not they have an ATM in the back which is very convenient! I'm not sure why people complain about it being cash only, this is New York people everywhere is cash only! Thats what makes the city so different. Anyways, enjoy!!",4.0

"We went here for my birthday dinner based on the Yelp reviews and they definitely did not disappoint.  We made reservations for 7:30 and got there a little early so we decided to have a couple of drinks at the bar first instead of rushing to eat.  We were having such a nice time at the bar that we asked if we could just eat there instead of at a table and they said ""no problem at all enjoy"" so we did.  Very accommodating. Now on to the food.  The meat and cheese selection that we did was beyond delicious.  We savored every bite before moving on to the beet salad.  Let me tell you.  Those were some of the most delicious beets we've ever had.  Plump and full of flavor.  Our main dishes were really good too.  I had the cavatelli with the seafood.  OMG.  Defreakinglicious!

"FOOD POISONING!!!!!It was my first time at AlMar. I ordered the lasagne bolognese while my two other friends ordered chicken. After 20 minutes of waiting for our food, our waiter apologized and assured us that our dinner would be out shortly. When I tasted my lasagne I noticed that it tasted a little ""different"", I figured it's probably because it's a three meat lasagne and I havent been here before so it's probably just me. I should stuck to my gut and realized that the food was not well prepared. The next day I woke up to horrible joint pains and abdominal cramps, a few hours into my saturday, I was puking and well you know the rest of what happens. It's now Monday, and I'm still sick with a migraine headache and pit stops to the toilet every 10-15 minutes. I decided to call the restaurant and speak to the manager who told me that at least 50 people ordered the lasagne and I received my meat from the same batch (ew? there's a batch of mixed meat laying in the back??) so I informed him that I didnt eat anything before hand or after visiting almar and of the funny taste from the lasagne. He apologized and offered me free dinner but I don't think I ever want to eat here again. As for a review of the rest of the place: The hostess was not pleasant at all - she had a serious attitude problem, this should have been my indication to run while I had the chance Our waiter was nice and attentive but not overly attentive The place is Cash ONLY~ if I paid with my amex I definitely would've disputed this charge. There is only one restroom- I went to use it and a man was peeing with the door ajar - disgusting** The ambiance is nice- dimly lit, ok decor- seriously nothing special for its location The rest of the menu was nothing special either. For dessert we ordered the Tiramisu which was served out of a martini glass, but it looked and tasted like it came out of a pre-made carton. So all in all, the food poisioning was not worth it. I wouldnt give this place a second chance, even though they offered me a free meal to make up for the poisioning.",1.0

"I found AlMar through Chowhound, and booked a reservation for five for my friend's birthday dinner based on the good reviews and the menu.  We had an idea it would be good, but every so often, there's that rare, sensual restaurant experience that surpasses most everything you've enjoyed; it is THAT good.  This was our experience at AlMar.Four of us arrived at this beautiful, rustic, spacious restaurant, and started off with a plate of very fresh oysters, two different octopus appetizers, an eggplant ricotta bruschetta, and a delightful, reasonably priced bottle of red wine.The octopus special had a tomato based sauce which was mostly just stewed tomatoes and not particularly exciting, however it had been cooked to soft, tender perfection.  The other, a grilled octopus appetizer which is a regular on the menu, was accompanied by onions, celery, capers, crisp green olives, and perfectly cooked white potatoes (*just* done, not too soft).  This was absolutely delicious in flavor, and had just the right touch of char in the grilling.  The octopus could have been just a touch softer, but was otherwise sublime.  I could not try the bruschetta (gluten intolerant), but when I asked my companion about it, his eyes rolled back in obvious delight.For the mains, I resisted my initial urge to go with the roasted breast of duck with red wine cranberry reduction, and instead went with the red wine braised rabbit with polenta.  As luck would have it, a late-arriving friend sat next to me and ordered the duck, so I got to sample that, too.  I'm so glad I was convinced to go against my obvious first choice, but not because the duck was any less amazing.  Having tried rabbit on several occasions, I had nearly given up on it as a dish I prefer.  This version not only changed my mind, it put me into a state of pure, sensual bliss.  The chef absolutely mastered the preparation of this gamy meat and bent it to his will; the skin crisp and dark with the sugar from the wine it was braised in, the meat inside juicy and SO tasty.  The polenta  was creamy, buttery, wonderful.  As for the duck, the slices were buttery soft inside and crispy outside with the sugar from the red wine cranberry reduction, which added just the perfect sweetness to the velvety dark, rare meat.  It was accompanied by a lovely mashed squash dish.The birthday girl and her boyfriend split a plate of pappardelle with porcini, cremini, shitake, oyster, royal trumpet and chiodini mushrooms with blueberries (!) and herbs that everyone at the table just raved about.  I was jealous that I couldn't taste it.  The friend to my left had Penne Alla Pizzaiola, which he said was wonderful.Unfortunately, we ran out of time before our show and didn't have time for desert, but it was a good thing, as we were quite full and warm with wine.  It was the perfect evening.I found out later that the chef and co-owner hails from the longstanding Brooklyn Heights outpost Noodle Pudding, which also receives very high accolades.Bring plenty of dough.  This restaurant is *CASH ONLY*",5.0

"Came to AlMar because it looked so nice, the specials on the board outside turned out to be just items on the menu.  Waited about 35 minutes, which is okay for a Saturday night - but tables were open for 10 minutes, cleaned, before they would seat us or other waiting people- no sense of urgency or willingness to get people in tables, and the place isn't that big either.So, the waiter doesn't introduce himself after 15 minutes, just says, ""So, you know what you want?"" We order.  They are out of octopus, tuna (our top two choices), and a few other things.  Soup was bland, candle wasn't lit, had to ask for pepper.  Maybe it just wasn't our night.  Main dishes were okay.WARNING: I guess it's on the bottom of the menu, but the place is CASH ONLY.  All in all, disappointing.  The waiter laughed when we showed him we were charged $26 for a bottle of wine when it was listed as $25.  What's a dollar here or there?  Pretentious or nonchalant, I don't really care, service wasn't good.  Bathroom was a mess.  ugh!    Guess we'll trek back to Astoria next weekend when we have to be in this neighborhood and eat there.",1.0

We love this place.  We come here on a regular basis. The bresaola and arugula appetizer is delicious.  They always have really good specials.  The happy hour makes me very happy. :),5.0

Yum. Yum. Yum. If you go this this restaurant without trying their ribs you are crazy. It's sooo amazing. We also had the bean salad which was very good as well. I would definitely come back when I'm in Dumbo,5.0
"Came to AlMar because it looked so nice, the specials on the board outside turned out to be just items on the menu.  Waited about 35 minutes, which is okay for a Saturday night - but tables were open for 10 minutes, cleaned, before they would seat us or other waiting people- no sense of urgency or willingness to get people in tables, and the place isn't that big either.So, the waiter doesn't introduce himself after 15 minutes, just says, ""So, you know what you want?"" We order.  They are out of octopus, tuna (our top two choices), and a few other things.  Soup was bland, candle wasn't lit, had to ask for pepper.  Maybe it just wasn't our night.  Main dishes were okay.WARNING: I guess it's on the bottom of the menu, but the place is CASH ONLY.  All in all, disappointing.  The waiter laughed when we showed him we were charged $26 for a bottle of wine when it was listed as $25.  What's a dollar here or there?  Pretentious or nonchalant, I don't really care, service wasn't good.  Bathroom was a mess.  ugh!    Guess we'll trek back to Astoria next weekend when we have to be in this neighborhood and eat there.",1.0
"Went to dinner last friday before a performance at St Ann's. Dumbo is not my favorite place to go but Almar might make me change my mind.  The restaurant is warm with dark wood.  My mom and I shared a huge barley, fava bean salad with herbs and mint.  Had the whole fish special and a bottle of rose' with lots of character.  Food was thoughtfully prepared and our server very helpful and although we were stuffed, he brought us some refreshing lemon sorbetto.Very nice evening",5.0

"What a wonderful evening my husband and I had the other night at Almar! The food was just delicious!!!   We split the grilled octopus for an appetizer- grilled to perfection with just the right amount of seasoning.   My husband had the short ribs for his entrée and I had the roasted cod.  Everything was so FRESH, not too heavy and so good!!!  Even though we were so full, we had to try the dessert.  We had a chocolate mousse cake and the blueberry pancetta for dessert- YUM!  We cannot wait to go back to Almar, as it is now one of our favorite restaurants in the area!  Great ambiance, reasonable prices and delicious food made only with the freshest ingredients!",5.0
"we stumbled upon this place while we were in brooklyn one day and was looking for a brunch place. the decor is really cool. i like the look of hte place. spacious with kinda of a bare warehouse-ey feel. the food was really good. i love the food presentation of every dish! i got the eggs in a cloud. it was super cool and interesting. the brioche was amazing! perfectly toasted. yummy! it had ham on top of it and cheese and then the egg cloud thing. idk how they made the egg puff up like a giant cloud but it was good! then it had spinach i assume cooked in olive oil all around the plate. it was soooo fresh and simple and amazing.the veggie fritata i also tried. it was tasty. i love love this place. fresh ingredients, cool casual atmosphere and really cheap actually!!! definitely a great deal for brunch! you gotta check this place out!",4.0

"Very surprised last night when my boyfriend and I tried to have dinner at Almar after Dumbo Arts Festival. We are an interracial couple and the hostess told us we would have to wait 2 hours before we could be seated. We were shocked as the place was half empty. She told us she had not been able to clean all the empty tables yet. Then two Asian girls asked to be seated and my boyfriend heard the hostess tell them it would be 20mins. I asked the Asian girls to confirm and yes they were only given a 20min wait time. I confronted the hostess who started to lose her words as she could not come up with a valid excuse, then I asked to see Mr. Almar himself who basically told us to deal with it. I guess the hostess was following his direction. Don't seat blacks! For the first time I now know what Josephine Baker felt like when she tried to eat in a NY restaurant that didn't serve blacks.",1.0

"I've been here twice now, and it's a real stand out for lunch time in DUMBO. Today I got the pork sandwich. It's got slow roasted (10 hour) pork, which is very tender with a pleasant hint of fat. To add some zest to it, the sandwich has pepperoncinis, red pepper and capers. It's served on a crisp artisanal roll, with a side of salad (read: lettuce). The ambiance is rustic, hip and cozy. A nice combination. And at $11, it won't hurt your wallet.",4.0

"People - brunch isn't a tough meal to do badly. The service was atrocious but that didn't even matter when you account for the bugs flying in and crawling around the joint, lipstick on the water glass, and the most dried out over done egg dishes I've ever had. No apologies from staff or recognition that it took over an hour to bring out our food after three tables [who came in after us] were served. A real shame - DUMBO could use some new brunch spots. And whatever you do, don't walk by the kitchen before you eat because then you definitely won't stay for your meal.",1.0
"Came for dinner after hearing good things about the food, even though Al Mar took over my fave Dumbo spot: Dumbo General Store. Hubby and I split bruschetta, cauliflower soup, and a creamy pasta with sausage and peas. The food was delicious start-to-finish. Fresh, top-quality ingredients came together in just the right way in every dish. My only gripe was a slightly disinterested waitstaff that looked a bit put-upon by the eager diners around them.

I was her because it was highly recommended. The food was ok nothing to write home about. Very Friendly staff though. One thing it was very dark in the restaurant and I was there and it was so sunny and bright outside. The special for apps was the stuffed sardines which was amazing!! The waiter forgot my cocktail I ordered. When I used the Ladies room after dinner it was all the way in the back past the kitchen and was very dark.

"I have eaten dinner here 5 or 6 times now and have never been disappointed. Alfredo, the owner/chef makes the most amazing and authentic Italian food I have ever had in Brooklyn or anywhere else. His food even beats my MOTHER'S and that's saying a lot when you come from an Italian family! There are no words to describe the fresh ricotta crostini - the ricotta is homemade and literally melts in your mouth. The dark red tomatoes he uses in his salads are so sweet they taste like candy. Everything is always perfectly fresh and delicious. On top of the food, I love the rustic atmosphere along with the old-time movies they project on the walls, and really appreciate how cool and accommodating the staff is.

"I have watched this resto go from Mexican to American and now finally Italian. And boy did Dumbo need a good Italian restaurant. It came under new management in the spring and I've been there a few times since then and witnessed changes in decor and staff. There were a couple of times when the service was a bit on the slow side, but the last time I was there, not only was the food amazing, the service and staff were fantastic. It was like a 180. I also noticed a new new sign outside Almar changed from Dumbo General Store. The cheese and meat platter is always good, but this is the case in many good New York restaurants. What got me hooked were the crostinisor bruschettas. There was only with ricotta,mascarpone, honey, walnuts. It was to die for. There was a bean salad that was super refreshing and delicious, yet felt healthy. Finally the braised lamb shanks~they melted in my mouth like butter. I was never much a fan of lamb because of it's super strong meaty flavors, but this one was braised and marinated to perfection. Super tender, juicy with a mini-explosion of all the right complex flavors on my palate. My friend said she was having a ""food moment"" during the meal, the best one I've had to date at that location, better than the dry paninis at Dumbo General, and better than the too cheesy enchiladas when it was a Mexican joint. I think this place has finally found the right chef and management and I hope it stays as good as it was the last time I was there.",5.0
"A welcome addition to the  DUMBO food scene. Have been three times, and this last time was the best so far -- they are really finding their way.The space is very comfortable, the service was terrific and the food - surprisingly, actually - was top notch. We gobbled it up - yummy arugula salad with fennel and orange, unbelievable good grilled octopus, pasta with rabbit ragu and salmon. Really, really good.Tonight was a Thursday, we went early, and the place was laid back, only about 1/3 or 1/2 full. They had old Fellini films silently projected on the wall - great vibe.The wine is great if you know what to order. I almost don't want to write a good review because I don't want the place to get too crowded... but i do want the restaurant to succeed and become a solid local standby that thrives and keeps the bar high. So please, AL Mar, keep that bar high!! Your good efforts are much appreciated and we will continue to dine at your lovely restaurant.",4.0

"My husband and I are regulars at Noodle Pudding, a favorite neighborhood Italian joint, so we were excited to try Al Mar, which was opened by the old chef and manager at Noodle Pudding. We ate early on a Saturday night at the new copper bar. I can't comment on the table service but the bartender was super friendly and attentive. On to the food. I can honestly say I was blown away. I was expecting it to be good, since I've had the chef's food before, but it surpassed my expectations. We started with an heirloom tomato salad and crostini with fresh ricotta and truffle honey. The crostini was creamy, earthy, slightly sweet from the honey and downright indulgent. For entrees we had a squid ink pasta with shellfish and montauk bass with couscous and grape tomatoes. I was a little hesitant with ordering the pasta with shellfish because I usually find that when there are numerous kinds of shellfish in a dish, one or more of the seafoods are over cooked. This was not the case with this version. The shrimp, mussels, scallops, etc were all cooked perfectly. Successful dish. But my favorite was the bass. Super, super fresh and cooked absolutely beautifully. The couscous salad was a fresh and lovely accompaniment on a warm summer night. Really couldn't have been happier with it. The space is a little 'raw' - it probably was originally a factory or warehouse- but the meal was so delicious and comforting that it's makes up for any lack of warmth that the space provides.

"This place looked very inviting while walking in DUMBO searching for a good place to eat. I liked the ambiance, very comfortable and not overwhelming. We were seated promptly and I noticed that the bottom of the menu says ""cash only."" So there is a warning, but it's easy to miss. Also, since it isn't 1822, it is dumb to take only cash. I'll send then a letter via Pony Express complaining about it.Fortunately they have modern cooking appliances despite not having basic monetary hardware. So we started with a salad with goat cheese, beets, orange and nuts. It was really excellent. Just some olive oil, citrus (orange perhaps) and salt, no goopy dressing to dominate the other flavors.The pleasant waiter suggested a wine for me which was delicious and paired well with the cheese in the dish.Next we had the bruschette with buffalo cheese and honey. Another winner. The salty cheese was complemented by just a bit of honey sweetness. The bread was good and also soft, it made it easy to eat without everything falling off the bread. Now lets get to why it was just 3 stars...My wife and I was splitting each dish and asked that the bruschette come first, then our next dish, which was quail wrapped in prosciutto. This took forever. Not the waiters fault I'm sure, but it was perhaps 25 or 30 minutes between finishing the bruschette entirely and the quail. They knew it was coming, not sure why it took so long.The quail had about 1 inch thick or so of prosciutto around it. It was also stuffed with cheese. The first bite was pretty good, but the salt became overwhelming after the second bite. The prosciutto around the quail was bigger than the quail meat and was the only thing I could taste, might as well not even had quail inside. It was hard on the outside too, difficult to cut and once causing the quail meat to squirt out of the meat shell and onto the table. It should be like a piece or two of prosciutto, but this was like 20 pieces.Considering how good the first to dishes were, I will try it again, but it was a bit disappointing the first time. In any case, avoid the quail",3.0
"We came here one night and because the wait was an hour and we had a show to catch at Galapagos, we went to Grimaldi's instead (yes, the wait was shorter at Grimaldi's)...so finally we made reservations to eat here before another show at the Galapagos.  We got there a little late but even though our table was ready, the waitress told us to wait at the bar...and finally, after 5-10 minutes, we got seated.  Then, we waited forever to get our food...probably 20 minutes.  Because we only had an hour before the show, we only ordered an entree.  We got the duck and pork chops.  They tried too hard with the pork chop - gravy instead, breaded....everything was just overwhelming!  The duck did not have much taste.  Perhaps if we had the much-raved appetizers, we might have had a better experience...unfortunately the slow service forbade us from ordering more food....",3.0

"the food was great! the appetizer was amaaaazing!!! have the ricotta bruchetta. u will not regret. Creamy, fresh ricotta on crusty, Italian bread with a bit of honey on top, tons of shaved parmigiana and a drizzle of truffle oil to top it off. So delicious. Still craving it months later. For main course had the rabbit with the polenta and peas. the rabbit was perfect, moist, and not tough. the polenta was a tad lumpy and could have used a bit of pepper. My's friend ordered the salmon with a citrus salad. Yummy salmon just a bit undercooked. the drinks were spot on, balanced and not watered down. Great atmosphere and great staff. Just wished they accepted debit/credit cards. CASH ONLY so a little inconvenient. But really great place to share with friends, family, or a date. Went in the summer and def need to go back.",4.0

"We came here one night and because the wait was an hour and we had a show to catch at Galapagos, we went to Grimaldi's instead (yes, the wait was shorter at Grimaldi's)...so finally we made reservations to eat here before another show at the Galapagos.  We got there a little late but even though our table was ready, the waitress told us to wait at the bar...and finally, after 5-10 minutes, we got seated.  Then, we waited forever to get our food...probably 20 minutes.  Because we only had an hour before the show, we only ordered an entree.  We got the duck and pork chops.  They tried too hard with the pork chop - gravy instead, breaded....everything was just overwhelming!  The duck did not have much taste.  Perhaps if we had the much-raved appetizers, we might have had a better experience...unfortunately the slow service forbade us from ordering more food....",3.0
"The space has a very rustic, informal feel which blends in perfectly with the neighborhood. Everything we ordered from the shrimp cocktail, to the ribeye, to the chocolate mouse was very fresh and delicious. The portion sizes were a little on the small side but overall we really enjoyed it. The old movies projected on one of the far walls was a nice touch.",4.0
"the food was great! the appetizer was amaaaazing!!! have the ricotta bruchetta. u will not regret. Creamy, fresh ricotta on crusty, Italian bread with a bit of honey on top, tons of shaved parmigiana and a drizzle of truffle oil to top it off. So delicious. Still craving it months later. For main course had the rabbit with the polenta and peas. the rabbit was perfect, moist, and not tough. the polenta was a tad lumpy and could have used a bit of pepper. My's friend ordered the salmon with a citrus salad. Yummy salmon just a bit undercooked. the drinks were spot on, balanced and not watered down. Great atmosphere and great staff. Just wished they accepted debit/credit cards. CASH ONLY so a little inconvenient. But really great place to share with friends, family, or a date. Went in the summer and def need to go back.",4.0
"If you think Italian food in little Italy is amazing well guess again! It is at al mar! Marcello and Alfredo has made a new home for me! You must indulge yourself in the crostinis, the short ribs and I kid you not, even the regular pasta dish will blow your mind away! You must go there!",5.0
"Very good food (chef from Noodle Pudding), but service is very spotty... House wine not good.",4.0
Went here for dinner with 3 couples.  Great crostini and apps and we all enjoyed our dinner.  Wine list not particularly good but great mixed drinks.  Will definitely go back.,4.0
