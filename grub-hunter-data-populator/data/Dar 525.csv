"I've been going to this place since the first year it opened. It's one of Williamsburg's best kept secrets. The food is always delicious and the portions are large. I love the tilapia dish and the pizzas the most. The Dar Burger is always well made and if you want something quick and filling, get the lentil soup. My husband always orders the falafel and various side dishes (tapas). The atmosphere is great for families as well as a quiet date. I've never had any issues with service. They're always quick and attentive. The decor is beautiful. This is one of the only 2 Mediterranean restaurants that I ever go to and I am never disappointed.",5.0
"Went here for a friend's birthday brunch (group of 10) and the atmosphere was perfect. It wasn't too crowded for a Sunday afternoon and we had ample time to relax and eat. However, the service was extremely slow especially in terms of refilling drinks.The waitress messed up my order, but offered me a drink on the house to make up for it, which I appreciated. Had a great time, would definitely go back!",4.0
"What a delightful Mediterranean place! I have had the pleasure of dining in and ordering take out and both times were great. The place is affordable! and the portions are generous. They have wine and beer- no spirits but their Chianti was a hit with my picky wine drinkers. I had the lamb shawarma. Absolutely amazing. The chunks of lamb were perfectly seasoned and incredibly juicy. The salad, hummus and babaganoush that came along with it made this a hearty dinner. We also sampled a red pepper dip that was delicious. My hubby went with their sun dried tomato pizza - it was wonderful. Its usually empty when I go to the establishment- i hope that's because everyone is ordering in!",5.0
"Dar 525 is not only a wonderful restaurant, but their delivery is also consistently great, which is what really earns the fifth star. It's sometimes difficult to find food on Seamless that is both delicious and wholesome, and Dar 525 delivers on both. I discovered Dar 525 while looking for somewhere to get brunch on Grand St. My boyfriend and I had a lovely, authentic Mediterranean meal.FoodBaba ganoush- some of the best I've ever had. Would highly recommend.Lentil Soup- this is my new favorite thing to order given the chilly winter weather. Richly spiced and wonderfully savory for a vegetarian soup.Mixed Grill- this is our go to order and we find it's enough for two people if you're not too hungry. It allows you to choose three meats and comes with pita, rice, hummus, baba ganoush, a salad, and pita. Lamb kebab, vegetable kebab, and merguez are all favorites.",5.0
"The eclectic dining scene that Brooklyn has been blessed with as of late is certainly impressive (almost as impressive as this particular writer being able to generate love/accolades/compliments to anything Kings County related, in general).  However, it would be negligent of me to not live by my own philosophy of giving credit where credit is due; and this place certainly does deserve the star rating that currently graces its Yelp page.A friend of mine had done some sleuthing a week prior to my visit to this location (same friend who was subject to my very moody ""2nd Floor on Clinton"" review... just a few reviews ago if you care to peep); anyway, she found that Grand Street in Brooklyn was having their own restaurant week specials... not unlike the citywide Restaurant Week earlier in 2016. From 2/21/16 to 2/28/16, patrons of this joint would be given the option to pick from a 3 course prix fixe menu (again, super similar to any Restaurant Week dinner).  Price of said three courses?  An astoundingly reasonable $18 (ultimately coming out to around $23-$24 after tax and tip were taken into account).Despite having initiated the dialogue to go to this spot, self imposed exigencies prevented her from coming, thereby abandoning a 4 person reservation which resulted in myself being a party of 1... for a time.  Say what you might about this particular writer's moodiness, but he does just as good a job, as Kambei in ""Seven Samurai,"" of putting a group of misfits together to accomplish a common goal (or Nick Fury in relation to ""The Avengers""... for those who lack the privilege/cinematic wherewithal of having viewed the aforementioned Kurosawa master work of Japanese cinema).  While I was not able to recruit 6 other ""samurai"" to my Kambei... I was able to find four for my dinner party  that Saturday; they were all equally excited to partake in what would be a fantastic dinner.Like any leader would, yours truly arrived first to the venue... with the scent of food coming out of the building and into the street generating feelings of excitement for the offerings about to be sampled that night.  Slowly but surely, the rest of my party began to gather, and we were seated. This joint, boasts a lot of space, and I appreciate the layout; while it would be possible for Dar to fit a few more tables onto the floor, they forego this option in lieu of giving their patrons a little more elbow room and privacy.  I, for one, respect this housekeeping decision.  Additionally, the ambiance was also quite pleasant... dark space with soft lighting combined with the all wooden finish of the space amalgamated into a no-pressure romantic environment (if one was so inclined).  The food, however, was rightfully the star of the show.  As there were five of us, we were all willing to try a permutation of menu items and share them amongst ourselves.  For the first course, we got hummus, beet salad, mousaka, and lentil soup.  Each appetizer course (save for the salad) was accompanied with a wide thing piece of naan (which was a gratefully accepted vehicle by which we transported the appetizers into our mouths).  Having been able to try everything, I can say that all apps were tasty, and we were all pleased with our selections.The entrees followed, and the sheer quantity of food per plate was almost excessive (not that I'm complaining).  Being able to pull off quantity AND quality during the second course was the master stroke of the evening.  Each plate had our choice of protein (kafta kebob for the 3 ladies, chicken kebob for ""Tod,"" and mergues para mi).  Though my choice of protein was nowhere near as plentiful as the protein provided to my companions, I was pleased with my selection; the taste of the lamb sausage I had ordered was on point, with an abundance of spices and texture that coupled terrifically with the hummus, rice, baba ghanoush, and salad with pickled peppers  that accompanied the entrees; again, the portions were huge.The baklava (which we all ordered), was just the proverbial cherry on top.  Layers of phyllo containing the cinnamon-y walnut filling and drenched with honey... though I frequently say I am not a dessert fan, you can add baklava to the short list of dessert items that I am fond of every so often (in addition to dutch apple pie, doughnuts [if they are even considered a dessert], and chocolate chip cookies).Well done Dar. You should really think of moving over to my hood... you'd be more appreciated there I think!",5.0
"Great family place for brunch.. the seating is spacious and bright with natural light. For $25, u can have a bottomless brunch with unlimited drinks. I ordered the shakshuka which comes in this spicy pepper sauce. Loved the poached eggs and the heat, but it was a tad too salty. Their pita bread is amazing, light, thin, fluffy, the way i like it. My husband had the chicken kabob platter which is well worth its price. The chicken isnt dry, very tasteful, comes with a refreshing cucumber yogurt and hot sauce. And i had no complaints with the babaghanoush, hummus, rice n salad on the side. The french toast is a great plate to share if u have a big party. Nutella and bananas on toast sprinkled with pistachios n a side of blueberries. It's a big yum and not as sweet as it sounds, so in other words, perfect. Everything was priced reasonably.For the Mediterranean omelette, make sure youre a fan of lamb cuz i could definitely taste the gaminess.Two tables on the outside for outdoor lovers.",4.0

"Came here last night and there was a huge party that left the restaurant with only 3 tables to spare. We waited at the bar and it wasn't a big deal anyway since we were in no rush to end the night. While we waited, one of the guys was more than accommodating and attentive by coming back every now and then to update us on the time. The waitress there was also super friendly and so nice by giving us warm mint tea since we sat by the door that would let in the frigid air every time it opened and closed with each delivery guy. They even brought us some freshly fried pita chips with this addictive zaatar and honey dip. We ordered the usual chicken kebab (large chunks of tender chicken with the just enough charcoal burn) and a kafta kebab sandwich. The prices here are unbeatable and the food is always so good. Rather than my usual side order of babaganoush, we went for the mezze plate and tried the muhamara, moutabel, hummus, 2 orders of baba. Aside from my all time favorite, babaganoush, and my boyfriend's favorite, hummus, the muhamara was definitely a contender. It's a thick purée of roasted red peppers and walnuts with a little spice. It tastes a bit like a romesco sauce. They definitely didn't skimp on the walnuts, which other restaurants sometimes do so that it comes out runny. I loved it on the warm pita but even more so on the kafta kebab and chicken kebab! At the end of the night, they gave us complimentary red sangria and honey semolina cake. Everything was delicious and the service was by far one of the best. They more than made up for the 30 minute wait, which again, I really didn't even mind in the first place. This is definitely going to remain one of my everyday go to restaurants for lunch, dinner, or even a laid back date night. I love the ambiance and the decor. Absolutely unbeatable.",5.0

"Scoped this place on a visit to NYC and was *not* disappointed.  With 3 other friends, we ordered the assorted salad plate with Hummus, Muhamara, Moutabel, Moujadara, and Cucumber Yogurt - all got devoured, but we wound up ordering a whole second plate of the Moutabel, which was the clear, smokey favorite.We also made quick work of the falafel, the fattoush, the shepherd salad, the zaatar bread (it's impossible not to love bread with zaatar on it), the syrian rolls (cheese) - they were like filo mozzarella sticks and were possibly my favorite thing next to the Moutabel.  We also got a side order of merguez, which while good, was maybe the one thing I wouldn't be as quick to order next time.Great service, great atmosphere, and possibly my favorite of all the meals we had over the course of the weekend.  Would love to come back next time I'm in town!",5.0
"Every time I think I find my new favorite brunch place, Brooklyn manages to one up me. Case in point: Dar 525.This place has some of the best Mediterranean food on this side of the river, and with prices/portion sizes that will feed you for days. On my first visit, I got the Mediterranean omelette for brunch ($10), which came loaded with lamb sausage and veggies, and shepherd salad, home fries and pita on the side. The omelette itself was awesome, but I could. not. would not. stop eating those home fries. Also, THE PITA. Dar 525 makes it fresh; it comes to your table looking like a soft little pillow, and I always can't decide whether I want to lay my head down or tear it apart immediately (#2 usually wins).If you're lucky enough to live/work near Dar 525 on the weekdays, they also do a fantastic lunch special. Their platters ($8) come with fresh hummus, rice, salad, pita, and babagonouj. I highly recommend the chicken kebab or chicken gyro, both of which are very moist and full of flavor. I wasn't a huge fan of their babagonouj (it had a weird sour taste to me), but everything else was fantastic.For reasons I still can't understand, the place has been almost or completely empty every time I've been there.

Also the color is beautiful. I dig the Falafel Platter, with extra falafel. Yea its that good! The pizzas are good too, we assumed it would be tiny, but it was enough for one person to eat and not still be hungry. The shrimp and calamari is the best, but the goat cheese is a close 2nd.

"I never thought I would see the day when I would give one of my favorite restaurants a two star rating...smh. The service has completely plummeted. The food remains great (although it was on the salty side tonight, and though still good the babaganouj is different..not as great as before) which is why the food gets a 2 out of 3 stars. They get absolutely NO stars for the service.  Although service had been questionable and has been depleting over the last few visits I always made exceptions because the food was soo good and the service was amazing when I first discovered this gem of a restaurantTo cap off tonight's dining experience we sat down and waited quite a while before ordering although we were the only individuals at a table. While we are placing our order with the waiter he begins to walk away while we are still speaking. We received our appetizer and were not yet given plates and utensils. After five minutes of waiting for the waiter to appear I took it upon myself to take the utensils off an empty table for our use. We then waited 5 more minutes for the waiter to ask him for plates. I did everything but go to the kitchen and get the food and bring the plates back  When we were ready for the bill I tell him I have a ""check in"" offer from yelp...but as I am speaking he walks away again not having heard what I said. He then added gratuity to the bill bc being a party of four is a big party to him and constitutes the addition of gratuity. Definitely not, we had that removed. This place has food too good to go down because of their lousy service. I hope they pull themselves back together for food alone cannot carry a restaurant to five stars, and service alone can ruin any establishment.",2.0
"Mediterranean  pizzas covered in lamb and spices are my delight here. The lamb pizza is really outstanding, it is also rather large and the price is reasonable. I have been here a few times not and each time the service has been acceptable and the food great. They do an inexpensive bottomless brunch that I recommend. Try their Mediterranean  breakfast pizza, it is egg, feta, onions and lamb on a pizza. It is really, really fantastic. Another stand out menu items was there wings of all thing. A friend had them once and they were very above average, if not a bit pricey for wings.Over all come here if you want a change of pace. They pull off both traditional and fusion cuisine quite well and there is nothing near by that can  say it is similar.",4.0
"Love this place from the day the opened! I always get the mixed grill with chicken, lamb and falafel. Yum yum yum! Everything here is so good! The only thing I wish is that it was a little bit cheaper so I could order it from home on days when I don't want to go out.",4.0

"My goodness I have no complaints, only compliments!  Came here for lunch not sure what to expect.  Voila - everything was awesome.  Ordered the $8 chicken kabob platter - wow for that price (or any price for that matter) - it was great.  The portiions were very generous as you may be able to see from the picture.  From the chicken being cooked virtually perfect to the baba and hummus.   Even the rice was tangy and the salad was a great complement.   And then, of course, is the pita.  Its unique in my view and quite amazing.  It kind if looks like a naan and has a light consistency.   The service was good and so is the interior.  They have a happy hour that seems pretty legit but did not partake.   I would be curious about the falafel as I have found many places that cannot cook that right.  That is for another day.",5.0
The five stars are strictly based on their chicken soup which is low-key the best chicken soup i've ever had. It has a light curry and lime flavor to the broth. Its not too overpowering and not bland at all. Really great soup. Will be making this a staple this upcoming winter.,5.0
I love the 5 salad plate! I usually get two orders of the Labne because it's the best!They are very accommodating and will listen to what you need and try to meet those needs. I called super close to their closing time and they still delivered in 15 mins! Thanks!!,5.0

"This place has bang for the buck. The various samplers are all delicious. The chicken tagine was the only thing I've had so far that was mediocre (this sauce was delicious, but the chicken was extremely overcooked).

"I've eaten here many many times, but only once in person. There delivery game is one point! We we came in person we saw three delivery guys coming and going like crazy. The place was pretty empty for a Friday night, so it looks like most of their business is delivery.  I had been looking for a good falafel spot since Mana closed ::pours out beer:: And this place stepped up in a major way.My favorites to order are the Red Hummus, it has a very rich flavor and is pretty filling. Also the color is beautiful. I dig the Falafel Platter, with extra falafel. Yea its that good! The pizzas are good too, we assumed it would be tiny, but it was enough for one person to eat and not still be hungry. The shrimp and calamari is the best, but the goat cheese is a close 2nd. Also I don't know whats in the rice, it must me crack. Because just talking about it is making me jones. Its this buttery rice filled heaven. I don't care if you order or go to the location (its pretty) but just get some of their food in your mouth pronto.",5.0
"I never thought I would see the day when I would give one of my favorite restaurants a two star rating...smh. The service has completely plummeted. The food remains great (although it was on the salty side tonight, and though still good the babaganouj is different..not as great as before) which is why the food gets a 2 out of 3 stars. They get absolutely NO stars for the service.  Although service had been questionable and has been depleting over the last few visits I always made exceptions because the food was soo good and the service was amazing when I first discovered this gem of a restaurantTo cap off tonight's dining experience we sat down and waited quite a while before ordering although we were the only individuals at a table. While we are placing our order with the waiter he begins to walk away while we are still speaking. We received our appetizer and were not yet given plates and utensils. After five minutes of waiting for the waiter to appear I took it upon myself to take the utensils off an empty table for our use. We then waited 5 more minutes for the waiter to ask him for plates. I did everything but go to the kitchen and get the food and bring the plates back  When we were ready for the bill I tell him I have a ""check in"" offer from yelp...but as I am speaking he walks away again not having heard what I said. He then added gratuity to the bill bc being a party of four is a big party to him and constitutes the addition of gratuity. Definitely not, we had that removed. This place has food too good to go down because of their lousy service. I hope they pull themselves back together for food alone cannot carry a restaurant to five stars, and service alone can ruin any establishment.",2.0
"Mediterranean  pizzas covered in lamb and spices are my delight here. The lamb pizza is really outstanding, it is also rather large and the price is reasonable.

This was a pretty good Mediterranean place with very fresh babaganoosh and pita!! I got the falafel pita and my boyfriend got some couscous chicken dish. They were both pretty good but nothing special.

Definitely not the most friendly staff here. But stiff overall pretty good food!,3.0
"This place was good, but nothing special. Very empty. But hey, fast service! We split the falafel platter and the chicken wings. Both were quite tasty, no complaints. The three glasses of wine we ordered were actually more expensive than the food, so the meal was definitely reasonably priced. Nice atmosphere and liked the middle eastern music, but kind of weird because other than us there was only one other table with people. It was totally fine, I just somehow feel kind of indifferent towards the place. Had a nice meal there, but beings as it is not in my neighborhood I doubt I'll make a trip back.",3.0
"AVOID DELIVERY AT ALL COST !!Food arrived in loose and sloppy containers, everything was covered in oily red sauce, really gross... (50 minutes to be delivered by the way...)The starter was made with a can of old beans that have been sitting open for a while and just dumped in a blend sauce.The shawarma's pita bread was soggy ( almost slimy), the chicken itself was terribly salty and tasted rancid : so bad it let us to a non digestible downward spiral.The tajine was, at the best, ""average"", extremely watery though -we thought it was a soup when it came...The $9.00 fattoush salad was just iceberg with old fried pita bread chunks.

Triple thumbs up for this middle eastern food. Everything came out nice fresh and hot. Amazing experience. The waiter (james) was a sweetheart the owner gave us free desserts and a complimentary bottle of wine bc I was a friend of friend. You must order the shrimp and camri pizza was a OMG moment.  It was superb amazing.  A must try. The chicken was just perfect as well. It wasn't oily it was deep fried first and then baked. You didn't need the sauce it was just right.  If you love I mean really LOVE garlic.  You have to try the garlic bread that looks like a pizza. And they are very generous on the garlic drizzle with olive oil and parsley.  In heaven.  The portion of the food is just perfect.  Pita bread amazing as well wasn't dry like other places.  Free wifiI could list everything what we ordered but I rather not.  You have to go check it out yourself and have that amazing experience.  The music was great.  Wasn't to loud but it wasn't to low as well. We're able to hear each other and still enjoy the music.  Will definitely come back and plan an party there.,5.0
This spot was ok. Their sangria wasn't all that good. I loved their hummus. I ate the chicken kabab. The chicken was nicely flavored on the outside but the inside was a bit dry. My girlfriend had the falafel dish and she like it but had better.Service was good. The decor seemed nice and clean. The baklava was weak =(,2.0
"This is the best middle eastern food I've had in NYC. Our group of 7 headed over on a Sunday after church. It's a mid-size restaurant and completely empty on a Sunday afternoon. Loved the hanging tapestry and decorations in the back restaurant area behind the bar.Everyone in the group ordered either a sandwich (like a giant pita gyro) or a platter (same ingredients as the gyro, but with salad, tabouli, and hummus on the side). They bake their pita to order and you can taste the freshness. Their falafel is also the BEST falafel I've had (outside of Greece!). Super crispy on the outside and spiced perfectly. The falafel sandwich is also HUGE and only $5! The platter is also a steal at only $8. This is probably the best value on the menu. Hubby also tried the sausage and my friend had the chicken kabobs. Props to their talented chef for making such a juicy chicken kabob! Great restaurant, highly recommend!",5.0
"This is probably the place I order from most often. Such a good value. The hummus tastes really home made and fresh, I always order a big one to keep around the house so I don't have to get store- bought hummus. The chicken soup total blew my mind recently, very aromatic with herbs and lemon. But the falafel platter is totally my staple. This place is a neighborhood favorite for sure.",5.0
"This place is pretty much always empty, so I have avoided it for some time. But tonight me and my husband went here for dinner and it was so good. We had falafel and it is by far the best I have had in the city. Woooaaaahhhhh. Can't speak for the rest of the menu but falafel sure is good.",4.0
This was a pretty good Mediterranean place with very fresh babaganoosh and pita!! I got the falafel pita and my boyfriend got some couscous chicken dish. They were both pretty good but nothing special. The reason I'm giving this three stars instead of four stars is because our waiter was just not friendly at all and barely came to our table or even spoke to us. Definitely not the most friendly staff here. But stiff overall pretty good food!,3.0
"This place was good, but nothing special. Very empty. But hey, fast service! We split the falafel platter and the chicken wings. Both were quite tasty, no complaints. The three glasses of wine we ordered were actually more expensive than the food, so the meal was definitely reasonably priced. Nice atmosphere and liked the middle eastern music, but kind of weird because other than us there was only one other table with people. It was totally fine, I just somehow feel kind of indifferent towards the place. Had a nice meal there, but beings as it is not in my neighborhood I doubt I'll make a trip back.",3.0
"AVOID DELIVERY AT ALL COST !!Food arrived in loose and sloppy containers, everything was covered in oily red sauce, really gross... (50 minutes to be delivered by the way...)The starter was made with a can of old beans that have been sitting open for a while and just dumped in a blend sauce.The shawarma's pita bread was soggy ( almost slimy), the chicken itself was terribly salty and tasted rancid : so bad it let us to a non digestible downward spiral.The tajine was, at the best, ""average"", extremely watery though -we thought it was a soup when it came...The $9.00 fattoush salad was just iceberg with old fried pita bread chunks. (Even Mc Donalds have been  better and cheaper!)All that for the modest price of $40.00 !",1.0

Triple thumbs up for this middle eastern food. Everything came out nice fresh and hot. Amazing experience.

Delivery has been very prompt (under 30 minutes and food was warm!), when we get takeout they always bring us water, and on the chillier nights mint tea. Overall, very nice restaurant.

"The thing I like about Dar 525 is the straight-up value you get out of your dining experience. It's not just that this spot is affordable and the portions are large enough to take home (though that helps). It's that the food is good. Really good, in fact, if you order right. And the service is spot-on.I recommend the muhamara (nutty, sweet, interesting) or babaganouj (smoked to perfection) as an appetizer and kafta kebab as an entree. Sure, there are some items, that are just standard--the stuffed grape leaves left something to be desired and the hummus lacked the punch I was expecting. Still, these feel like minor complaints. In the grand scheme of things, Dar 525, with it's cheery, Tunisian-touches in decor and attentive service, make it a worth-while spot for middle-eastern dining if you are in the neighborhood.

"Love this spot on Grand Street! Dar is so damn delicious, and at a great price. You can snag one of their platter lunch specials for $8.

Mmm. sauces.Just beware, I asked if they offered gluten free pita, to which the server looked confused and slowly said...uh, yeah. Then my pita came out looking exactly like the non GF pita.

Stopped by to get dinner on the way to a show at the knitting factory. We sat outside (there are just a few seats available). I ordered the grilled vegetable sandwich which was delicious. Large chunks of freshly grilled peppers, onions, tomatoes with fresh warm greens, yum.My bf had the burger and fries, which he said were probably of the frozen variety. We also got the garlic bread which is a large flat bread with real garlic and oil. It was delicious. Service was OK.

I had to practically sit on my hands to let other people get their fair share. I had the Shepherd's Salad, which was the perfect light entree (and only $6), and very fresh. My friends had the falafel platter, lamb gyro, and chicken kebab, and all were very happy.I definitely want to come back with a bottle of wine when it's warmer out; Dar 525 has a patio out front that looks loooooovely for the summer.",4.0
super delicious food and great service too!,5.0
"Thoroughly impressed with this place. Gave an extra star just because.I found it on yelp and was expecting a little take out joint but lo and behold it's actually a very spacious, beautiful, simple and rustic restaurant. Stopped by to get dinner on the way to a show at the knitting factory. We sat outside (there are just a few seats available). I ordered the grilled vegetable sandwich which was delicious. Large chunks of freshly grilled peppers, onions, tomatoes with fresh warm greens, yum.My bf had the burger and fries, which he said were probably of the frozen variety. We also got the garlic bread which is a large flat bread with real garlic and oil. It was delicious. Service was OK. Waiter was friendly (and super attractive) though we did have to make sure we spoke clearly so he got our order right. If I am ever in the area, I would definitely return.",5.0
"We visited from California.  We went to this place twice, cause it was that good.  We went for breakfast  and the other time for lunch.  I have lots of middle eastern food, but this place was so BOMB- Digity!  The coffee is off the hook, the menu was relatively inexpensive.  It was HALAL which made it great.  And of course they accept credit card, which happens to be rare in New York.  If we come back to New York / Brooklyn, we would eat here again.The waiters were very friendly too.",5.0
"Yum! Giving 4 stars since I haven't been in-person yet but ordered for delivery last night. Quick arrival, perfectly cooked and seasoned chicken kebab. Platter is well priced and comes with salad, baba, rice and pita. Also got the veg kebab side. Well cooked and seasoned just a little oily but would try again-probably even better in person. Will be a definite option next time I'm going out in the neighborhood. Great location for those of us on the south side who don't want to walk up to mogador!",4.0
"Food is delicious and a bargain. Ate here for dinner one night and had the falafel platter which was amazing and only $8. My friends enjoyed the pistachio pizza and some other entrees. No one had any complaints except that its beer and wine only-no cocktails.Another time I came here for brunch. One entree and AYCD for $20. The best deal in town. More food than I could finish and so fresh! Omelet with veggies and cheese plus salad, home fries, and fresh bread plus dipping sauce was incredible. My friend loved her nutella and banana stuffed french toast. Bloody marys were great along with mimosas and bellinis. My new go to spot!",5.0
"I'm sure I've reviewed them before, but I needed to come back for more! Holy chicken! Their chicken soup blows my mind!  And who orders chicken soup anyway? You guys.... it is SO special and good and different- yet familiar! Dar: never leave me, I need you, I love you. And your chicken kabob plater. And your prices.xoxo",5.0
"We came here and loved the food. We had the fattoosh salad, the appetizer combo plate and the lamb kabob. Everything was wonderful and the service was quick and friendly.By the way, the enterier is roomy and very nicely decorated. They had arabic  music on the whole time which we enjoyed. It was a mix of traditional and modern.",5.0
"We had a pretty mediocre meal here. The pita was quite good but everything else was pretty weak. The garden salad wasn't great and the dressing was mostly just lemon juice. The chicken tajine was too sweet and gooey and left me feeling a little gross. Maybe I ordered wrong and nothing was horrible, but in a neighborhood filled with amazing restaurants, why bother?",3.0

Chicken Kabob Platter - Grilled chicken, hummus, baba ghanoush, salad, pita, super.They make great coffee too !One thing to mention is you will wait a bit for your main course so order an appetizer if you're famished.

"We decided to check out dar 525 brunch after walking by earlier in the week seeing a sign that said 'join us for bottomless brunch this weekend.'We were really disappointed that they did not offer the deal as it was also listed on the menu. They merely told us that they were in the process of phasing this out and could offer us $5 mimosas (which were TINY).Service was slow, but friendly.  Ambiance is nice.  My open faced mediterranean omelette was really good, though my home fries were served cold. Also tried the hummus which was great.",3.0
Service was soooo bad. I came in here took 3 bites of my lamb kabob rushed over to the restroom to throw it up and came back and nicely just took it to go and then threw it out. It was nasty. The fat server who works here needs to learn a thing or 2 about customer service. He never and I mean NEVER came and asked me if I wanted water if I wanted drinks if I wanted ANYTHING. I only saw him when he gave me the food. He just sat it on my table and left then when he said so you want the check because my whole dish was still there minus what was flushed down his toilet and into the NY sewers. That's why I didn't even bother to tip. I left and would never ever come back. No wonder there's was only one other couple when I was there and upon leaving I hear the guy say that was the worst meal he ever had. Lmao I wanted to say I concur but he left in a hurry. If you want half cooked food come here. If not go elsewhere. They suck,1.0
"So, I did enjoy this place, but it seems like every other Mediterranean place. Fortunately, my family, boyfriend and myself went on a Sunday evening and got served right away (we were almost the only people there). My family had no complaints, they seemed to enjoy the food. I did like my food, but I probably should have asked them to take out the tomatoes. I don't think there was anything wrong with them, I just really don't like tomatoes. Anyway, like I said, the food was generally good; I just wasn't ""wowed"". My boyfriend said it was because I didn't have a meat dish, but whatever.

"I would have loved to sample their fare as I live just two blocks away and have been a longtime Williamsburg resident of 15 years and love nothing more than to eat out once or twice a week 'in the neighborhood'. However, my experience was cut short to just a seltzer. I never yelp reviews, or perhaps I do once a year, and I think this is the first negative one I've ever done. On a Friday I was scheduled to meet two friends for lunch around one. I got there early so I decided to sit at the bar and wait and have a glass of wine to start my weekend. The man behind the bar, presumably the order as he talked down to the only other staffer I ever saw- a cute waitress, took my order which was for the chianti by the glass and disappeared to the back. After a couple tastes to make sure I wasn't having a moment- I asked the waitress if perhaps the bottle was bad or uncorked possibly the day before as it just tasted off. She took the glass of wine, disappeared into the back, and then both came out into behind the bar area and just ignored me. This was rather odd as I was the only person at the bar and there was maybe two tables occupied at all. Let preface this place is ALWAYS empty everyone I walk by. Now I know why...I finally decided to break the silence and asked- to either one of them- ""oh is this sangria in these vats?"" Too which he replied, with a smirk- ""yes, but its OLD. You wouldn't like it"". Then and there I realized what the problem was to this new restaurant in my neighborhood and why it's so empty all the time. Needless to say I asked the waitress nicely for a seltzer and the check, told her I would be next door at a different wonderful restaurant in the neighborhood- Le Barricua- and with that gulped my seltzer to wash down the nasty wine aftertaste I had, paid my bill and was off.

"Arriving early for dinner at 4:50 pm, I found that most of the place was filled with small groups of friends having early meals. Fortunately, my husband & I had some room to sit at the bar to wait for our friends who were on their way coming from Manhattan.  Luckily, I live in Brooklyn, so I did not have to commute very far at all.  Dar 525 is conveniently located close to L train Lorimer Street and L train at Grand Street.  We started off by having a small plate of olives and pita as well as a lentil soup.  One thing worth mentioning is that the restaurant is inviting.  The decor is tasteful. It has a chill lounge vibe with a charming, yet classy feeling to it.  With regal purple plush chairs strategically placed near the bathroom & near the entrance for those waiting to get a table, I find that the space is definitely well planned & thought out in advance.  There are violet velvet curtains that drape around the bathroom areas to isolate them from the pathway from the entrance to the inside.  Calming, cool, exposed brick walls covered all the sides of this establishment.  With distinct shapes & gold framed mirrors hanging sexily on the back wall, & elegantly designed chandelier-like candles hang over your head, Dar 525 has a way of drawing you in.  There is a cobblestone fireplace with no fire or wood by the way & with good reason, since it is summer time & it is quite hot outside.  There are two water closets labeled bathroom in Italicized font which both are unisex.  They were  clean & well prepared with paper towels, hand soap and multiple toilet paper rolls.  From what I see, the dress is casual.  I noticed other tables had families with younger children even babies.  My feeling is that you could bring a date here or even a group of friends even up to 4 or 5 people here.  The prices on the menu are reasonable anywhere from $5 to $17. One can have a choice between vegan, vegetarian, & carnivore/omnivore.  The menu has multiple options, such as rich salads, delicious soups, hummus, babaganoush, olives, moussaka for those who prefer no meat near their plate.  Their pita is light, fluffy, yet satisfying.  Did I mention that it comes in the form of a round puffed pillow?  It makes you want to keep it on your table unimpaled, since it is like a work of art.  ::heart melts::For us carnivores, there are options for fish, seafood, chicken, pizza, kafta, lamb sausage(merguez), and also dessert.  I came with a party of four & was thankfully seated without a wait.  Happily, we sat down and the kind waiter asked us if we wanted beverages.  Our responses were three coffees, an espresso, and water for the table.  There are also other things on the menu for drinks like Arabic tea, mint tea, cranberry juice, Iced tea, lemonade, and others that I cannot recall at the moment.  When I went to Dar 525, I went with three people: my husband and another lovely couple. Between the four of us armed with hugely ravenous appetites, we had ordered:1. mouthwatering chicken wings with two different sauces, one with cilantro and the other harissa based(sizzlingly spicy--well for me, at least)2. calamari pizza with fresh squid and yummy melted cheese and extraordinarily crisp crust 3. a huge garden salad which had fresh cut cucumbers, tomatoes, lettuce, olives, crunchy pita chips on top4. mohamara(walnut and red pepper in a delicious rich paste), 5.babaganoush(stewed eggplant)6. an order of sweet potato fries with ketchup and chipotle mayonnaise on the side which was sinfully & undeniably scrumptious.7. mussels which had the most lickably delicious flavored tomato sauce. It came with a side of garlic pizza, which was overpowering with garlic & yes, that is how I like it!8. babousa & baklava, where were gratifyingly sweet & just hit the spot in exquisite ecstasy9. olive plate and lentil soup--great intense briny appetizer. Think a palatable refreshing taste of olives. The spice ladened lentil soup was accompanied by a huge portion of fluffy pita bread. My all-time favorites are the sweet potato fries and the calamari pizza. I appreciate the crispy flavor of the fries and sweet aromatic smell of the sweet potato flavor.  There was a flavorful purple pepper laced on the calamari pizza which was just heavenly, & my brain still longs for more.*The four of us had a meal that came up to $90 without tip for 9 to 11 entrees which means to me that this was a great deal for those who visit Willyburg and need some delicious Mediterranean food. **When I came, they were in the process of getting a liquor license, so you may want to bring your own wine bottles(not sure if there is a corking fee).***At one point, the owner of the restaurant came over to ask us how we felt about the meal & asked us if we would come back.  Our retorts, ""Why yes, of course!""  It was a lovely time, Dar 525!   Now, that I know that you have a weekend brunch & weekday lunch option, I must come back & try it some time.  =)",5.0
"First of all....OMG!!!!A little bit of a back story....my friend was having one of her birthday dinners here and she had asked me what i thought about the place. Of course I yelped it but to me it was a turn off , but I had told her its fine. So I came into the place expecting to get maybe a small entree or a cheap appetizer, but that was not the case. There was at least nine people in our party and every single one of us got something appetizing! My boyfriend couldn't stop raving about the shrimp and calamari pizza and I had the tilapia fillet. The prices I think were really cheap. For the nine of us the bill came up to 106 i think and some change! he only con to me was the decor but the food really made up for it. You could see into the kitchen and not in a tasteful way plus it just looked like the pace was missing that sparkle but who cares right!!!Loved it....going back again....OOO and two more things lol 1: I like how they put the shrimp and calamari underneath the cheese, I think it gave it a little surprise2: I dont' know what their frying technique is but it's the best. The tilapia wasn't greasy or anything, it was really light and the skin came short of a flake but it was sooooooo good",5.0
"I first ate at Dar 525 when I moved into my apartment down the street.  My mom and I were looking for somewhere to grab a quick lunch, and Dar had a good-looking menu.  We were a bit thrown at first because we were the only people in there (which seems to be a trend as I've dined in one time subsequently, and there were only 2 other tables during a weekend dinner night).  However, we were pleasantly surprised when the food turned out to be wonderful.My mom got the pistachio pizza, and I got a falafel platter - both of which have become go-to delivery orders of mine.The pistachio pizza is delicious and creative - the toasted pistachios on top add a great crunch.  Their falafel is consistently good, and if you get their mixed platter, be sure to try the labne.I generally order delivery from Dar, so I can't speak to the consistency of the restaurant service, but my delivery orders are always at my door within 20 minutes of placing my order (probably because I live down the street, but I'm not complaining!).Overall, go to Dar 525 for solid, consistent and quick Mediterranean food.",4.0
"We ordered Chicken Kebab platter, it came with salad, rice, pita humus and 2 souses. waiting for food takes a bit of time but it worth waiting.

Even the dessert is fantastic.  The owner is always around and he makes you feel like a guest in his home. Wish I lived closer, or I'd totally be a regular.",5.0
"Arriving early for dinner at 4:50 pm, I found that most of the place was filled with small groups of friends having early meals. Fortunately, my husband & I had some room to sit at the bar to wait for our friends who were on their way coming from Manhattan.  Luckily, I live in Brooklyn, so I did not have to commute very far at all.  Dar 525 is conveniently located close to L train Lorimer Street and L train at Grand Street.  We started off by having a small plate of olives and pita as well as a lentil soup.  One thing worth mentioning is that the restaurant is inviting.  The decor is tasteful. It has a chill lounge vibe with a charming, yet classy feeling to it.  With regal purple plush chairs strategically placed near the bathroom & near the entrance for those waiting to get a table, I find that the space is definitely well planned & thought out in advance.  There are violet velvet curtains that drape around the bathroom areas to isolate them from the pathway from the entrance to the inside.  Calming, cool, exposed brick walls covered all the sides of this establishment.  With distinct shapes & gold framed mirrors hanging sexily on the back wall, & elegantly designed chandelier-like candles hang over your head, Dar 525 has a way of drawing you in.  There is a cobblestone fireplace with no fire or wood by the way & with good reason, since it is summer time & it is quite hot outside.  There are two water closets labeled bathroom in Italicized font which both are unisex.  They were  clean & well prepared with paper towels, hand soap and multiple toilet paper rolls.  From what I see, the dress is casual.  I noticed other tables had families with younger children even babies.  My feeling is that you could bring a date here or even a group of friends even up to 4 or 5 people here.  The prices on the menu are reasonable anywhere from $5 to $17. One can have a choice between vegan, vegetarian, & carnivore/omnivore.  The menu has multiple options, such as rich salads, delicious soups, hummus, babaganoush, olives, moussaka for those who prefer no meat near their plate.  Their pita is light, fluffy, yet satisfying.  Did I mention that it comes in the form of a round puffed pillow?  It makes you want to keep it on your table unimpaled, since it is like a work of art.  ::heart melts::For us carnivores, there are options for fish, seafood, chicken, pizza, kafta, lamb sausage(merguez), and also dessert.  I came with a party of four & was thankfully seated without a wait.  Happily, we sat down and the kind waiter asked us if we wanted beverages.  Our responses were three coffees, an espresso, and water for the table.  There are also other things on the menu for drinks like Arabic tea, mint tea, cranberry juice, Iced tea, lemonade, and others that I cannot recall at the moment.  When I went to Dar 525, I went with three people: my husband and another lovely couple. Between the four of us armed with hugely ravenous appetites, we had ordered:1. mouthwatering chicken wings with two different sauces, one with cilantro and the other harissa based(sizzlingly spicy--well for me, at least)2. calamari pizza with fresh squid and yummy melted cheese and extraordinarily crisp crust 3. a huge garden salad which had fresh cut cucumbers, tomatoes, lettuce, olives, crunchy pita chips on top4. mohamara(walnut and red pepper in a delicious rich paste), 5.babaganoush(stewed eggplant)6. an order of sweet potato fries with ketchup and chipotle mayonnaise on the side which was sinfully & undeniably scrumptious.7. mussels which had the most lickably delicious flavored tomato sauce. It came with a side of garlic pizza, which was overpowering with garlic & yes, that is how I like it!8. babousa & baklava, where were gratifyingly sweet & just hit the spot in exquisite ecstasy9. olive plate and lentil soup--great intense briny appetizer. Think a palatable refreshing taste of olives. The spice ladened lentil soup was accompanied by a huge portion of fluffy pita bread. My all-time favorites are the sweet potato fries and the calamari pizza. I appreciate the crispy flavor of the fries and sweet aromatic smell of the sweet potato flavor.  There was a flavorful purple pepper laced on the calamari pizza which was just heavenly, & my brain still longs for more.*The four of us had a meal that came up to $90 without tip for 9 to 11 entrees which means to me that this was a great deal for those who visit Willyburg and need some delicious Mediterranean food. **When I came, they were in the process of getting a liquor license, so you may want to bring your own wine bottles(not sure if there is a corking fee).***At one point, the owner of the restaurant came over to ask us how we felt about the meal & asked us if we would come back.  Our retorts, ""Why yes, of course!""  It was a lovely time, Dar 525!   Now, that I know that you have a weekend brunch & weekday lunch option, I must come back & try it some time.  =)",5.0
"First of all....OMG!!!!A little bit of a back story....my friend was having one of her birthday dinners here and she had asked me what i thought about the place. Of course I yelped it but to me it was a turn off , but I had told her its fine. So I came into the place expecting to get maybe a small entree or a cheap appetizer, but that was not the case. There was at least nine people in our party and every single one of us got something appetizing! My boyfriend couldn't stop raving about the shrimp and calamari pizza and I had the tilapia fillet. The prices I think were really cheap. For the nine of us the bill came up to 106 i think and some change! he only con to me was the decor but the food really made up for it. You could see into the kitchen and not in a tasteful way plus it just looked like the pace was missing that sparkle but who cares right!!!Loved it....going back again....OOO and two more things lol 1: I like how they put the shrimp and calamari underneath the cheese, I think it gave it a little surprise2: I dont' know what their frying technique is but it's the best. The tilapia wasn't greasy or anything, it was really light and the skin came short of a flake but it was sooooooo good",5.0
"I first ate at Dar 525 when I moved into my apartment down the street.  My mom and I were looking for somewhere to grab a quick lunch, and Dar had a good-looking menu.  We were a bit thrown at first because we were the only people in there (which seems to be a trend as I've dined in one time subsequently, and there were only 2 other tables during a weekend dinner night).  However, we were pleasantly surprised when the food turned out to be wonderful.My mom got the pistachio pizza, and I got a falafel platter - both of which have become go-to delivery orders of mine.The pistachio pizza is delicious and creative - the toasted pistachios on top add a great crunch.  Their falafel is consistently good, and if you get their mixed platter, be sure to try the labne.I generally order delivery from Dar, so I can't speak to the consistency of the restaurant service, but my delivery orders are always at my door within 20 minutes of placing my order (probably because I live down the street, but I'm not complaining!).Overall, go to Dar 525 for solid, consistent and quick Mediterranean food.",4.0
"We ordered Chicken Kebab platter, it came with salad, rice, pita humus and 2 souses. waiting for food takes a bit of time but it worth waiting. The cost of the lunch will surprise you, it's only 8,5$ for this much food. Everything is very tasty, u can literally just point on something in the menu and won't regret you'r choice. Stuff is also really nice and friendly. Place is never get's crazy busy, so there is no waiting in the line to seat. has a TV to watch some sport. Coming back every morning.",5.0

"Not to blow my spot or overstate my case, but the food is very good to amazing, this is probably worth a trip from Manhattan, and everyone giving this 2 or 3 stars _needs their heads examined_ ('sup Freeport, NY?).  The game here is not just focused on kebab and mezze - the lamb burger is amazing and, apparently, so is the pizza; tagine not bad at all - they do several things very well.",4.0

"Made a reservation here for my birthday brunch on a gorgeous Sunday in May (customer service over the phone was great).  Food was delicious, with bottomless mimosas, sangria, and maybe  one other option for $20.

"Found DAR 525 on Yelp while looking for Mediterranean food in the Brooklyn area. We took the trip in from Staten Island and it was WELL WORTH IT. We got there around 7 (made reservations but really didnt have to) and sat immediately. We started off with the Labne and Hummus spread with Pita. The Labne might be my favorite spread I've ever had! My girlfriend loved the hummus as well. And I really love their inflated pita bread is legit.We also wanted to try the Goat Cheese pizza with roasted peppers because of the reviews we read from other Yelpers and i'm really happy we did. it was GREAT! Next time I might make my the pizza my entree. The lamb kebab was awesome, super tender with great seasoning. And if I didnt eat so much Labne and pizza, I would have finished my Falafel too.  The portions are really big, which means bigger plates, which should also mean bigger tables...but it's not the case. tables are pretty small. A lot of plates and you definitely feel a bit cramped up.  Th owner told me he has only been open four months, and i assume that in another four (especially when they get their liquor license), this place is gonna be packed every weekend.

"I'll join the masses and sing my praise of Dar 525. In my book, it takes a LOT to give five stars and although nothing was particularly wrong with our food, but like I said, it just takes a lot.Before going any further, I also think it's necessary to point out that I ordered in and if I have found one thing it's that food is always better when served at the restaurant.Anyway, moving on. I ordered the chicken kebab sandwich, which had lean bar-b-qued chicken, tomatoes, lettuce, and tahini all wrapped up in a pita. It was HUGE and only $7.50! My boyfriend got the hamburger (lame!), but he seemed to enjoy it because there wasn't a scrap left on the plate when he was done with that thing. We also ordered the hummus and pita, which of course was delicious.I definitely plan on coming back here. Great Mediterranean food at an unbeatable price. My next order will be in person... see you soon, Dar 525!",4.0
"One of the best places to eat in Williamsburg ! Great atmosphere, and the food is amazing. The pizza is hands-down one of my favorite options on the menu. Weekend brunch here is a must. The wait staff is very friendly and adds a positive vibe to your meal.",5.0
"My boo and I swung past here on a Thursday night and decided to give it a shot since we've been meaning to check it out... such a good decision. He got the tilapia, I got the kofta kebab, and we've been back 2x since (once for dinner, once for snacks). The food is good, cheap, and the portions are plentiful, like a homecooked meal. I also love that the place is unpretentious -- the decorations are tasteful but the restaurant isn't decorated to be trendy. The food and attentive service speaks for itself.FYI - Its BYOB so grab some beer from the bodega around the corner.",5.0
"Freshest food in the neighborhood-free pita with every order fresh and piping hot right out of the oven! Wonderful salads and homemade babaganoush and hummus!Huge portions and fresh falafel (not dry or oily) so delicious! Give this place a try-sit up front near the window and bar for the best atmosphere. We've eaten here at least 4 times and always been happy with the food and service, had take out maybe 3 times and just as happy.So happy it's now in the neighborhood! Also heard a rumor that Dar is in the Zaytoons family!",5.0
I've had the lamb kebob platter twice: once dining in the restaurant and once delivered. Very delicious. The salads look and taste fresh. Their hummus is really good. When dining in the restaurant they bring out fried pita chips with some kind of honey and spices dip. So good.,4.0
"Best Arabic food I've had in the States so far. Marouch in LA was the defending champion, but the quality and price of Dar 525 gave it the edge. I get the chicken kebab with its gorgeous hummus, baba ghanouj and fattoush sides, and cannot believe the quality for an $11 entree. Super friendly and fast service. Please eat here!For context, I spent 16 years growing up in the Middle East, and travel there often. I look out for Middle Eastern places all the time, and always order the same thing as a means of gauging their relative quality. This place is legit.",5.0

"Oh Dar 525, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways.1. The space is moody and sexy. Like walking onto an Eyes Wide Shut set, everyone that sets foot inside this place gets hotter by 1 point. instantly. It's amazing. 2. The food is shamefully good and the price is right. The food is SO damn good and SO damn reasonable. It feels like you should be paying an arm and a leg but because you aren't you feel naughty. And you like it, a lot. I had the hummus and warm pita, simple and delicious. The shrimp and calamari pizza. Sweet baby jesus, this was the best pizza I've ever had. SO good I'm afraid I won't  ever order anything else when I return. I also had some sort of pastry with crushed pistachios inside of it. Sinful and heavenly all in one. 3. The service was exceptional. Everyone looks super cool as one would expect in Williamsburg but they are also super nice (even if you look like a yuppie). I cannot wait to return and try something else on the menu. Three cheers for Dar 525.",5.0
"I'm going to have to dissent with all the five star reviews based on the food I ordered.  The falafel was pretty mediocre in my book- not well spiced at all.  The best part of the meal was the freshly baked pita bread that came out completely poofed up and slowly deflated as it cooled (so THAT is what pita bread is supposed to look like!!)  They are extremely generous with portions.  The place is deceptively large and the decor and seating is utilitarian, in contrast to the sometimes overwhelming trendiness of nearby places.  They seem to want the focus to be on the food, which I am not opposed to, but this may not be your place if you are looking for a romantic date night.  I may update this review if I come back and try the kebabs or pizza and am blown away.",3.0
"This is a nice restaurant with everything right, the price is good, the portions are great, the ambiance is clean and pretty, the waiters are good, the food is well developed not just default recipes that you could have anywhere, and it tastes like they use high quality ingredients.

"I'll join the masses and sing my praise of Dar 525. In my book, it takes a LOT to give five stars and although nothing was particularly wrong with our food, but like I said, it just takes a lot.Before going any further, I also think it's necessary to point out that I ordered in and if I have found one thing it's that food is always better when served at the restaurant.Anyway, moving on.

My boyfriend dropped his fork on the ground; he was prepared to just apply the 5 second rule, but the server actually HEARD the fork fall from inside the restaurant and brought a new one out without being asked.

"As good as it gets!  You'd usually have to trek over to over crowded Astoria for food like this, but finally an authentic Mideastern option for me here in Wburg.  I called in advance to ask if the food was Halaal, and to my jubilation he said ""Yes, 100%"".  I will be eating here and bringing my friends too. The babaghannoush was described as 'vegetarian heroin' and how accurate a description! High quality ingredients, fresh and flavorful while staying authentic and not gimmicky.  Eat here.",5.0
"REALLY good mediterranean food - very authentic and delicious.  The Kafte Kabob was delicious and the platter was very beautiful and colorful and served a huge helping of hummus, baba ghanouh, salad and amazing mediterranean rice.  Also had the Lamb pizza which was beyond words - SO delicious.

"As good as it gets!  You'd usually have to trek over to over crowded Astoria for food like this, but finally an authentic Mideastern option for me here in Wburg.  I called in advance to ask if the food was Halaal, and to my jubilation he said ""Yes, 100%"".  I will be eating here and bringing my friends too. The babaghannoush was described as 'vegetarian heroin' and how accurate a description! High quality ingredients, fresh and flavorful while staying authentic and not gimmicky.  Eat here.",5.0
"REALLY good mediterranean food - very authentic and delicious.  The Kafte Kabob was delicious and the platter was very beautiful and colorful and served a huge helping of hummus, baba ghanouh, salad and amazing mediterranean rice.  Also had the Lamb pizza which was beyond words - SO delicious. They gave us dessert on the house which was very sweet.The outdoor seating is a nice touch in the front.  I definitely recommend if you are tired of the run of the mill hipster joints in Williamsburg. Coming from a mediterranean background myself, this place does a great job.",4.0
"This place is incredible. Solid service, incredibly delicious food and reasonable prices. I have taken my girlfriend here twice and we left each time wanting more.",5.0
"Seriously people, this is great mediterranean food. and I mean seriously. My favorites on the menu: chicken kebab platter mmm, chicken soup...double mmm, their hummus is always delish, and the owner is super friendly. Order in or go out, the place has a pleasant decor and great service.",5.0
The owner was horrible and rude!!!! I go there about 2 a week and the first time I ordered delivery it was probably the worst experience through any place that delivers I've ever had!! Do not order from here!!!!,1.0
This place is decent at best. Mediocre would probably be more fair. Pizza bottom was soggy..... what's going on with all the stellar yelp reviews?,3.0
"This place is incredible! Their food is out of this world perfection. Seriously, some of the best hummus I've ever tasted - smooth tasting and well textured. I usually get the Spinach Pie with feta, but have also tried the vegetable kabobs, soups, and desserts and have zero complaints. The owner/manager is also very sweet and accommodating. Still need to try this place for brunch! Definitely one of the better stops in Willburg.",5.0
"Dar is a delicious restaurant! Hands down one of the best, most affordable, high quality restaurants in Williamsburg. Have had over a dozen dinners here and it never disappoints-try the chicken kebab platter and don't forget mint tea and walnut baklava. We love these guys!",5.0

"You won't find cheaper drinks in their neighborhood than the BYOB options at this place. Super tasty mezze platters...a great mix of hummus, baba ganoush, tabouli, and mousaka. Seriously, you could just order a couple of those and pour your own BYOB the whole night. DONE. Equally amazing pita bread, crunchy, yet soft and fluffy...a real find.Their za'ater bread was a bit of a disappointment, a bit too dry and hard, and $6??? for a little side of bread?? C'mon that's just crazy! I mean, I still paid for it... it's one of the few places in NYC that I even find it on the menu. Next time though? I'll just make some at home and smuggle it in.One note of extreme criticism--their bathroom is really nasty. I had the unfortunate luck of walking in right after one of their cooks walked out, and he'd pissed all over the toilet seat...AND left the cold water running from sink's faucet.  Really? C'mon man...YOU WORK THERE....man up!",3.0

Great atmosphere great service. I would recommend the pizza all of them are really good. Their platters on the other hand not worth the price subpar flavor. I would go back to this place but only for their unique pizzas.,3.0
"This place is strictly set-up as a ""date place"". The ambiance is dim with candles on all the tables. The table are extremely small. There is music playing. The waitresses are dressed to impress. The food was very good. We both ordered falafel platters and grape leaves as an appetizer. The grape leaves were from a can and I wouldn't get them again but the main courses ruled. I wish that more places including this one were less romantic looking and more man friendly. It seems to be the trend lately. We are just two beer buzzed dudes who wanted to eat something good but were not out on a date. Just sayin.",4.0

"I was attracted by the nice decor, menu selections and low prices.  The food did not disappoint. They start you off with complimentary homemade fried pita chips and a delicious dip made of zataar and morrocan honey. We went on to order an assorted plate of humus, beet salad, foul, tabouleh, and moutabel, safiha, chicken platter and homemade thin yet very delicious pita, reminiscent of a tortilla.  The safiha, moutabel and pita were outstanding!  The chicken platter was huge and delicious. Everything else was good, not necessarily great, but definitely good.  Between three of us wecouldnt finish everything, so we now have leftovers to enjoy tomorrow.  All this food plus an arabic coffee came ot to $31! The service was fine, very friendly, attentive but not overly so.  I noticed other people bringing their own bottles of wine, beer and even whiskey.  I was sad I hadn't thought of it myself.  I will definitely be going back to try some of the many other tempting items on their menu, but next time I'll be bringing booze.",4.0

"FOOD:  5-stars!  Incredibly delicious and tasty.  Best couscous I've ever had in my life.  We got it with chicken (it also comes w/o) which was super tender and juicy.  We also got the assorted plate appetizer.  My favorite was the Labne, homemade yogurt.  So creamy and thick but not dry-thick like some Greek yogurts are.  And the Sheperd Salad and Jawaneh (chicken wings) were also really great.  Highly recommend!ATMOSPHERE:  Casual, pleasant and clean.  The decor is not my style but clearly thought out.  It felt a little thin for the spaciousness with the super high ceilings but it was nice that the tables weren't crammed together.  Also, for some strange reason, the gas furnace is right in the middle of the restaurant between the dining room and the bar.  Probably something they couldn't move without doing too much gas line plumbing but they could at least hide it behind a wall or something.  Very odd.SERVICE:  Excellent!  Our waitress was awesome.  Super nice and attentive but not too hovering.  She even gave us an ice bucket for the Lambrusco that we brought.  And the owner came over to ask how we were too.",4.0

"Was in the neighborhood with half a dozen friends and we picked this place to walk in to, and I'm glad we did. We sat down and started off with 2 big salads, scrumptious mussels and hot pita bread and hummus, along with sweet vodka cocktails. For dinner we munched on shrimp and calamari pizza (on whole wheat, as we specified), fried tilapia which was the perfect crispness and chicken in a date and apricot stew that was sweet and savory. Somehow we had room for dessert and had baklava and banana crepes. By the end of the end our bellies were more than content.

"I've only tried the Kafta kabob platter but it's really good. Both times delivery came just as the estimated given time (25-30 minutes). The platter comes with rice, salad, cucumber yogurt sauce, hummus, pita, and babaganouj. I'd like to go for dine in some time. My husband had the falafel platter and loved it.",4.0
"YAY!!!! Being middle eastern myself, it's always so hard to find cooking like my mom's...and Dar525 is it! The food is fantastic. The owner is so nice, and the interior is comfy and sexy. I definitely recommend going here. And did I mention the amount of food for the price?? $11 for dinner AND I had so much left over - it was lunch the next day. Run...don't walk to Dar525.",5.0
"I tried the brunch here for the first time on Saturday. I was surprised that there was no wait, unlike the other brunch spots around here like Barricou, because the food was fantastic.  We tried two bruch entrees: the herbed egges and merguez and the Mediterranean omelet. The omelet was very tasty and it came with a very fresh shepherd salad and good home fries. The herbed eggs came with a very yummy yogurt dip and a salad as well. Of course, both dishes were accompanied by Dar's freshly-made heavenly pita. The pita is made right before you eat it and it is so good that for the first time in my life, I actually took the left-over pita home and ate it the next day.  We just kept commenting on how delicious everything was and how inexpensive it is relative to other neighboring places. We also had the lemonade muddled with fresh strawberries (under $3!!!) and we loved it. Suffice to say, we will definitely be back for more brunching. Can't wait for brunch cocktails with fresh fruit to be added to the menu!!I also took home an assorted 5 salad platter, which is a great deat at $10.  Every single salad  was delicious.  The stuffed grape leaves were super fresh  and tasty as well, although I wish the portion was a little larger.",5.0
Best Mediterranean food in Williamsburg! Finally!,5.0
"Very authentic dishes at great prices. Food is always fresh and flavorful. It has become my go-to, even their brunch menu is superb. If you're looking to dine out and not break the bank nor gain five lbs you should check this place out. Trying the zatar is a MUST.",5.0
"where should I start !!!! really good balanced Mediterranean food .. Owner is friendly service it's good, and best part the price .. the bread with tahini its out of this world !!!! personally I'm addicted to the smoky flavor of the babaghanouj ... yuuummmm yuuummm I'll be back to this new sexy place in Williamsburg.",5.0
"What's not to love!  Great service and great food at decent prices.  Got the grape leaves, chicken soup, lamb platter, baklava.  Can't wait to go back for falafel.  Love what they did with the decor.  The sky lights make this place, and purple and white?  I feel like I'm on vacation when I'm there!  No wait--for some bizarre reason, they're always empty.  Maybe because it's new?",5.0
"excellent. this is probably my favorite restaurant in wburg. amazing staff, atmosphere, and food. just go!",5.0
"Yeah...this place is worth all the good reviews.  Great food (had pizza and kebab), great service, and great prices.",5.0
"4 stars because it's a nice new place, that has decent decor, middle eastern/mideterreanian feel too it. The food is good, seems authentic and service is attentive. They sell no alcohol for now, but you can bring your own. However, with all the people leaving 5 stars - you diminish the power of 5 stars. This place is a nice neighborhood spot, but it's not incredible. BTW, it's pretty affordable for now.",4.0

"Dar 525: where to begin singing your praises?  Perhaps with the welcoming ambiance of the place (appropriately named ""Dar"", the Arabic term for ""home""), or the equally welcoming and attentive staff.  Or I could begin with its spaciousness and subtly elegant decor, which only enhance the aforementioned ambiance.  And then there's the food--delicious, extremely generous portions that leave you full, but not feeling like a bloated pig.  All the items I've tried have been flavorful and extremely satisfying to all the senses.  There are also some very inventive, very delectable dipping sauces thought up by the owner of the restaurant, who almost always seems to be present and welcomes all of his patrons with kind candor.  All of these things make any meal at Dar525 an extremely relaxing, pleasant experience--and with such affordable prices, all the more so.  Though I do not live in the neighborhood, all these endearing qualities have made a regular visitor out of me.  Soon, they will be getting their liquor license and having belly dancers perform nightly, which is sure  to make me even more of a regular!     In closing, anyone who doesn't have rave reviews for this place must be smoking something other than hookah!",5.0
