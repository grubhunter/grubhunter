"My friend and I were actually going Broadway Lumber because we needed to buy a few tools. We were both super hungry. I figured we would not be able to eat until after shopping. But when I parked my car (yes, amazingly we found parking), we saw this place across the street. We decided to come try it. We didn't even know what we were walking into. Also, my friend is a vegetarian so, we obviously didn't know if they had vegetarian options (Knowing gentrified North Brooklyn, it probably did but still). The set up is very wooden rustic, very hipster. The lighting is very calm. They are attached to this cafe which also looks really cool. Anyway, My friend got the Vegan Pho and he definitely enjoyed it. I got the Bulgogi Cheesesteak, which is some shredded rib eye with rice, egg, kimchi and some veggies. It was fantastic. Honestly, I'm full but not the, ""I hate myself"" full and it tasted great. They offer free Jasmine tea as well!If you're in the area, check it out!",5.0
"I ventured out to Bushwick for a house party, and decided to get a quick (late) dinner at Little Mo, which is located right off the Myrtle Ave. train station. I almost resorted to getting something from a deli/quick marts because I didn't think there would be a sit-down restaurant near hear, but was so glad to have found Little Mo. I love the interior here - cute wooden panel on one side, and art work on the other. My friend and I got the Char Sui Chicken rice bowl and the Classic Pho to share. The rice bowl came with fried egg, pickled carrots, daikon, cucumber, and zesty fish sauce with Chinese BBQ glazed grilled organic chicken breast. The chicken was tasty, tender, and juicy...just wished there was more of the sauce! I think the ratio between rice and the rest of the good stuff was a bit high (aka too much rice).The Classic Pho was absolutely delicious. It's served only on Saturday and Sunday though. The beef and oxtail broth is very hearty and rich, while the assortment of goods in the broth - from bone marrow to rare ribeye to beef meatballs - all add the much needed protein to the dish. The rice noodles were slightly overcooked, but still quite chewy and soft at the same time.",4.0
"Great casual Vietnamese inspired food. More bushwick than Vietnam for sure.Bahn mi sandwiches get the job done, although definitely not my favorite in the city.Bulgogi cheesesteak is a dream come true. That sandwich is bananas. Perfectly emulsified meat/cheese/funk stuffed into a crunch baguette. I would have preferred a softer bread reminiscent of the Italian heroes used in philly, but this works. So dank, so good.Wings - the sweet chili wings are excellent, lots of five spice, adequate sweetness, and crunchy!!! The hot wings aren't as spectacular but still delicious.Great prices, nice atmosphere, perfect addition to the bushwick line up.",4.0

"Please don't bring small children here. Witnessed today huge disregard for their business by this ""play group"" who took over more than half of the large picnic style table for the 2 people eating out of 6 in a 10 person amount of space. This is not a nursery or a play ground this is a restaurant with sought after food that gets busy. But seriously,Great food! You have to get their wings, bulgogi banh mi, shishito peppers, pho..all amazing.",5.0
Okay pho. Only had vegan pho on the weekdays. It was bland. They need to have regular pho on the weekdays. Decently priced. Nice ambiance. Nice service. Would come here if they served regular pho more. Enjoyed their canned wine.,3.0
"Got the lemongrass chicken noodle soup here with a side of spring rolls, kind of pricy like $18 total :( but I was surprised at how tasty everything was for being all gentrified looking (lolol sry)The soup was pretty good, had a really soulful taste like the kind that would kick an oncoming cold out of your system pretty quickly. They weren't stingy on the chicken pieces either which I appreciate so so much.Anyways, I would pass on the $7 spring rolls next time and maybe try a rice bowl (or banh mi!) they sounded super appealing.",4.0
"So delicious. Takes me back to the streets of Hanoi. Really, everything here is fantastic!",5.0

"I've had so many bowls of pho it's not funny (not sure why it'd ever be funny); I'm always hunting for my next bowl, may it be more perfect than the last.Pho sho', their noodle soup is the star of the show: meaty goodness is embedded amongst rice noodles, with savory broth, sweeter than I'd like, but still satisfying. Want tripe? Let your love for it be known, and sing it to the heavens - at least let your cashier know you want tripe in your soup. Wish I had larger cuts of tripe, though.If you have room for banh mi, you'll appreciate the baguette, a crispy, fresh vehicle for deliciousness. Gold star to Little Mo for getting that right.The cafe next door - owned by the same owner - will serve you a Vietnamese coffee if you're in the mood. Or rather, a Vietnamese-inspired coffee, not the real McCoy. Get a pourover instead, and bring cash, as the cafe is mysteriously cash-only, unlike Little Mo.I felt a bit un-hip here, but I'll still schlep to Bushwick for a Vietnamese fix, ready to chow down to beats of Jay-Z.",4.0
"Little Mo is a hip, modern Vietnamese eatery connected to a very cute coffee shop- both instantly inviting and comfortable.I'm writing this over a plate of their excellent Bulgogi Cheesesteak, which is rich, juicy and perfectly complemented by a cold Singa beer, and the solid serving of 70s funk on the speakers.And so begins my weekly Little Mo patronage to try everything on the menu. The gang at Skytown said not to miss the Pho brunch, available only on weekends.",4.0
"Had a vegetable rice bowl with a side of brussels sprouts. Very unique, flavorful mushrooms in a teriyaki sauce that wasn't overly salty or overpowering. It was also very filling.

"This place serves up the best vegan banh mi I've had in New York, hands down. Their veggie option for the sandwich includes grilled japanese eggplant and portobello mushroom, a soy chili glaze, and vegan garlic aioli + the regular fix-ins (pickled vegetables, cilantro, jalapeno, etc.). The sandwich is very reasonably priced at $9, but I recommend adding tempeh bacon for $2 for even more flavor and substance.Despite the simplicity of a banh mi sandwich, I've found it difficult to locate a vegetarian option as impressive as this one. Most places offer tofu, which is fine (albeit too easy!), but the eggplant/mushroom option was unique and prepared to perfection. The ambiance of this place is exactly what you'd expect for this area of Bushwick -- trendy and casual. The employees were nice, the service was quick.I don't live around here, but I'll definitely be back next time I find myself in the area to try the pho, baos, and the delicious-sounding sides!",5.0
"Aw, little Mo. Seriously just a block from the JMZ and damn worth it. We came for the pho brunch (weekends only, and it's never too early for noodle soup) and of course got our hands on some of the delicious matcha lattes and Vietnamese coffee first. THEN, the menu! Appetizers, banh mi, rice bowls, wings, and bao... how do you choose? We wanted EVERYTHING. We ended up getting the classic Pho. It was just the right size, and the noodles/broth were pretty good. The banh mi and vermicelli were ok, but really the pho was the star. Can't wait to go back and try the chicken lemongrass noodles on a weekday!",5.0
"How do I start to explain my happiness, 1st off I biked from Williamsburg to Bushwick just to see if the tales were true.

What did I order ""the shorty"" which is a marinated boneless short-rib  banh mi sandwich which I skipped the bread for rice. As you can see my picture... it's a clean bowl. I almost licked ever inch of my bowl. My girl friend had the ""char Su chicken"" in rice as well, which is Chinese bbq glazed grilled chicken breast which of course was awesome.

"The pho broth here is amazing! I'm Vietnamese and trust me when I say this pho bowl come closely to homemade pho. The broth has this exquisite, distinctive flavored with the combination of fresh scallions, cilantro, and fried onions.  Although there isn't much meat in the classic pho bowl, I still enjoyed it very much, to me, quality food beats quantity any day. Best pho I ever had in NYC by far.I don't like their sandwiches, the mayo on the bread is too sour. The pork belly in the sandwich was tasteless and more on the dry part.

I love brussel sprouts. These were nicely sautéed in a ginger citrus soy glaze. Thick, sweet, I was licking the last drops off of the plate. Definitely get this!The wings were perfect. Each wing was covered (but not drenched) in the almost bright red smoky sauce. The wings were nicely cooked too: slightly crispy on the outside, but nice and moist inside.

Lastly but definitely not the least, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE put the ciabatta bread away. This is not the right type of bread for this. The best way to describe my experience at Little Mo...I just had a regular sandwich, not a banh mi. Maybe if I knew to have that mind set in the first place, I wouldn't have been so disappointed.

It's plainly evident that the kitchen makes sure to use quality ingredients (which probably explains the high price point as well). My favorite is definitely the steak bahn mi -- always tender and juicy.

"Modern flair while still staying true to the roots.Came here for dinner earlier tonight, and for the most part, I was satisfied with the sandwiches we ordered. Things are a bit slow because they just opened up, so seating was not an issue at all.Pros: the bread is fresh-tasting and not too crusty, which is often a problem with banh mi; I didn't leave a gigantic crumbly mess on the table. The volume of ingredients is also spot-on. I felt there was enough filling, and nothing was squeezing out the sides. I also loved the pork belly. I usually go for ""house special"" deli meats with my banh mi, and this was a welcome change.Cons: The jalapeños are way too spicy. I think maybe because they're canned, but the spice level was a common complaint at our table. I love fresh jalapeños because they add a grassy flavor, and every once in a while, you'll get a nice spicy bite. These jalapeños however were undoubtably spicy on every bite and disrupted my enjoyment of the sandwich. Also, the sodas are a little on the pricey end... just a note.Excited to see where things go from here!",4.0

The non-alcoholic drink selection is limited but interesting, with Mexican Cokes and fancy coconut water. Delivery is usually on time. I really like the pork belly banh mi. The short rib is pretty tough. I prefer the sandwiches to the bowls because the ratio in the bowls seems weird. It's like 70% rice, 10% meat, 10% carrots and 10% egg. I prefer to have more toppings in a bowl.",4.0
I had the veggie banh mi and my boyfriend had the pork belly banh mi. Both were amazing! The staff there is really great and the food was tasty. I would definitely go again for the pho brunch or to try a rice bowl.EDIT: Have now also tried the spring rolls and they are also amazing!,4.0
Rice bowls yummy. And omg pho! Definitely worth a try. No tipping needed. Bring food to your table. Will come back to try other items on menu. Also owner of Little Skips.,4.0
"Loved this spot. Great atmosphere and so much seating. We got take away so I can't comment too much on service but the young girl behind the counter was lovely . I ordered the chicken noodle soup and it was one of the best I've had . I also had the rice paper rolls and they were fresh and amazing. We did order spring rolls and ended up with the rice paper rolls, I'm not sure if this was a mistake or that's how they do their 'spring rolls' either way they were yum. Can't wait to come back and try some more things off the menu.",4.0
"Awesome addition to bushwick! love little skips so figured id give little mo's a shot.  I was extremely satisfied with my experience.  I had the shishito peppers, pork belly baos, and sweet garlic wings and homeade lime aid.  Everything was insanly delicious.  The peppers were sweet and savory, and a few random peppers were spicyyyyy.  The buns were sick!  They were not overly fatty and the hoisin sauce added a great sweetness to em.  The wings were just as good as my first two choices.  They were sweet, sticky, garlicky and simply delicious.  id come back for each one of the things i ate individually.  Next time i come im def gonna try the other things on the menu that also sound great.   Most importantly; i got a great meal at a decent price.  I got 3 different things and a homemade limeaid for under $25.  Great deal, that wont break your budget, any day of the week.    Who ever little MO is,  he knows what hss doin. Def hit up little Mo's",5.0
"This place knows what's up. Their chicken wings and cheesesteak bulgogi sandwich are amazing and hit the spot every time. Friendly staff too and good atmosphere. It's a bit pricey but the sandwich is filling on its own and is absolutely worth it.Wish I still lived around there and the place lay on my way from the train.. Highly recommend! Still have yet to try their pho, which is just another reason to come back.",5.0
"I might be a biased reviewer because the only thing ive had from Little Mo was the delivery pho. That being said, judging on the pho alone I wouldn't recommend this place for your pho fix. I was desperately craving pho one night, and I was excited to try this place out as it delivered to my boyfriends address in bushwick.To my disappointment, the minute it arrived (an hour later)i realized i had made the wrong choice.The pho came with the fresh bean sprouts and scallion already inside the hot broth, which wilted them and took away the key freshness and crunch that the sprouts and scallion are supposed to add to a great bowl of pho. Everyone knows that! On top of this, the broth had a weird sweetness that is NOT normal, and i didnt taste much of the soothing anise aroma that is so important in pho broth.The final was the sauce that came. No chili garlic, no sriracha, no hoisin. only that awful hot pepper oil that you get at the chinese takeout! never getting pho here again.",3.0
"Holy frijole. Ashamed I didn't know about this place and live right around the corner. Good as it gets pho- an old family recipe. Their banh mi was EXACTLY what I was craving and the spring rolls with fresh peanut sauce are the bomb dot com. Lovely to meet the family that runs this place, too. Did I mention they deliver and take cards over the phone?? Winter is coming... is your hibernation plan in place yet?!",5.0
After having flown a red-eye from LA to Newark then Ubering to Bed-Sty there was nothing more comforting then sitting down the next morning to a bowl of Chicken Soup and a Brisket Bahn Mi.

The veggie was my favorite- a little sweet and pickly. The buns themselves were soft and perfect. The sprouts were tasty and packed some heat.They have a bunch of good sodas and the guy at the counter told us their liquor license is pending- but BYOB is cool, so you can run over to Mr. Kiwi or the gas station across the street for some brews.There's a nice looking coffee bar in an attached room- we didn't go in, but since they're run by the same folks as Little Skips I'm sure that's solid too.",4.0

The broth was very nice and deep for a veggie broth... based on the color of the broth, I think they might use mushrooms, which is my favorite for a veggie stock.My friend had the baby bok choy, which was delicious, and the kimchi, which was not as good (seemed too soft/mushy, wasn't very tangy and overly sweet). Still, we liked the place and the decor is pretty cool. Pho is only served on the weekends, so be sure to plan accordingly!

"!!Disclaimer!! There is No Pho during the week, only during ""Pho Weekend Brunch"".  Instead they have a lemon grass chicken noodle soup, or pho ga, which is almost shockingly bland. It has a lot of noodles though? Chicken Noodle Soup: Bland and filling. Banh Mi: Pretty decent bread, pretty decent meat, although there is no classic pate/head cheese option, so you get to choose from fried chicken, pork rib, flank steak.  Very bland and also dry, I HAD to put hoisin all over it.  Try Nam Nam for an excellent daikon carrot slaw and use it please.  Or something, get some flavor/moisture in there. Bao: Unfortunately the best part I think because it was pretty salty and had hoisin all over it. Weird momofuku requisite asian menu thing.  I'm realizing this place is technically ""asian fusion"" which I guess means they get to slack off on all the hard-to-make things so maybe this is a harsh review given that they are setting the bar low.  I was so looking forward to a good pho in walking distance though. I also clearly havent tried their weekend pho, given the level of flavor in the other items I would be surprised if it were very good, but will update if I ever go back.",2.0

"I live right down the street, so I was super-excited when I found out they were doing a pho brunch. I've been a few times since it opened, and I have to give this place great reviews.

"!!Disclaimer!! There is No Pho during the week, only during ""Pho Weekend Brunch"".  Instead they have a lemon grass chicken noodle soup, or pho ga, which is almost shockingly bland. It has a lot of noodles though? Chicken Noodle Soup: Bland and filling. Banh Mi: Pretty decent bread, pretty decent meat, although there is no classic pate/head cheese option, so you get to choose from fried chicken, pork rib, flank steak.  Very bland and also dry, I HAD to put hoisin all over it.  Try Nam Nam for an excellent daikon carrot slaw and use it please.  Or something, get some flavor/moisture in there. Bao: Unfortunately the best part I think because it was pretty salty and had hoisin all over it. Weird momofuku requisite asian menu thing.  I'm realizing this place is technically ""asian fusion"" which I guess means they get to slack off on all the hard-to-make things so maybe this is a harsh review given that they are setting the bar low.  I was so looking forward to a good pho in walking distance though. I also clearly havent tried their weekend pho, given the level of flavor in the other items I would be surprised if it were very good, but will update if I ever go back.",2.0

Will definitely be back. To try other stuff. Price point was on point also. Had 2 local colas , boa, and chicken wings all for under $20 with some coin to spare for a well deserved tip. Was perfect amount of food to spit with a friend who was also impressed. 2 thumbs up. Take a boa boys. U did well",5.0
"little skips has always been a key component to my weekend visits to brooklyn, so, needless to say, i was very excited to check out little mo's. i was in brooklyn for three days and spent two of them at little mo's. because i'm in love.pork belly bao: very good. even better with their in-house kimchi. garlicky wings: good flavor. sticky and delicious. lemongrass bahn mi: my favorite! i could eat this again and again. we also tried a dirty matcha and chai latte from their coffee bar...so, so good. the hibiscus donut from dough blew my mind. staff and decor both get a 10/10 - they've created a super comfortable and beautiful space. can't wait to come back for their ph  brunch.",5.0

"Great wings and rice bowls, okay banh mi. The people who work here are always friendly and efficient. The bathroom is pretty amazing.",4.0
This is one of my favorite food places in Bushwick. I wish they had pho every day!,5.0
Finally finally a great place hang out spot restaurant coffee spot . In this neighborhood  gentrification is finally showing its beautiful head. The cheese steak is lit . The wings are a go to if your new . The boylan  soda tops it  off . Only thing needs another bench seating area gets crowded quick . If you want to get on the train and go to the city be my guess . I think I'll head 4 blocks down to mo's (Gotta Go To Mo's),5.0
"cool decor and table signs (they use silly animal pics instead of numbers) and that's about where the  positives about this place ends. split the following with my hubs: - over-priced Pho ($10 for a bowl of VERY watered  down broth and literally 4 chopstick full of noodles) I could easily pay 3/4 the price for 2.5x the amount of food. there was 1 beef ball and 3 slices of meat. what a rip off- pork belly banh mi. it was tasty, nothing special, but also extremely expensive ($10). don't come here. plenty of other great pho places at reasonable prices.",1.0
"This place is great. I live off the Halsey J (definitely out of their delivery zone) but they agreed to deliver to me anyway! Strong flavors in the bao buns, my husband loved the cheesesteak, and we shared the spring rolls -- also delicious with the peanut & coconut sauce. Will be ordering from Little Mo again soon!",5.0
"Rice bowls are great, pho is mediocre, prices are high. But the vegetarian rice bowl is really really really really great.",4.0
"This place was great! I got the little piggy bowl, and felt like one afterwards. Such a great atmosphere too, and all the people working there were so nice ! My girlfriend got the wrong order but didn't even care, because she thought it looked and smelled delicious (surprise! ... Not really) . It was something with chicken, and the bit I tried was amaZeballs.",5.0
"Drove by this place couple times always see people inside. Decided to stop found parking right away. As soon as you walking great vibes. Good music, amazing art work all around. Even in the bathroom. Staff was very friendly. Gave me free coffee with my order. I ordered the boa and the chicken wings.

"Had the pork belly banh mi. It was decent but is cost-prohibitive at $10 plus tax. If it was a few dollars cheaper, I'd be there once a week, as there's not a lot of good food in the immediate vicinity. I like spicy, but the jalapenos are too much for me.

No wifi!! I went to the original skips to find no seats which is what I expected around finals time. I was thrilled to find out there was another one down the road. Little mo had good coffee and cool decor but that's where it stops. No wifi at a coffee shop is insane. I normally buy coffee a sandwich a pastry and more when working at little skips spending upwards of $30. I quickly left little mo. If love to study here but to not have wifi is criminal. Little skips is busy and little mo is slow. Get wifi!!,2.0

"With my limited knowledge of vietnamese food, I can't speak about the authenticity of Little Mo's fusion fare. However, I can talk about my excellent experience eating here.I've been going to Little Skips ever since I moved to Bushwick. It's a great place to take out-of-town guests because they have AMAZING coffee and sandwiches, as well as exceptionally interesting artwork and decor. When I found out the owner was opening up another restaurant, I was thrilled. Little Mo is right across the street from Little Skips, in the strange and surreal land beneath the Myrtle Broadway JMZ stop. Attached to Little Mo, there is also a new coffee shop, which seems a little redundant since Little Skips is right across the street. However, this part of the neighborhood could definitely use more dining options. (Day and Night Deli makes an excellent sandwich, but there's nowhere to sit.)Despite the fact that Little Mo is still very new, the restaurant already runs like a well-oiled machine. Last Saturday, my boyfriend and I went right up to the counter and were promptly greeted and given a flamingo for a table number. We both ordered the vegan pho and an appetizer, helped ourselves to the free coffee from Little Skips and took a seat. Like Little Skips, the restaurant has a refined artistic taste that doesn't come across as pretentious.The food came quickly. The pho was fairly flavorful (although it could have had more vegetables), but our favorite part of the meal was the soy ginger brussel sprouts that we ordered as an appetizer. I would eat those every day!We enjoyed our meal so much that we also ordered a dessert - a mouthwatering mango cheesecake. They also brought us complimentary free tea at the end of our meal, the perfect armor for the cold.All in all, eating here was an enjoyable experience and quite reasonable for the price! We'll be back to try the sandwiches soon.",4.0
