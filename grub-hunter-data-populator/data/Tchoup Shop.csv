"I enjoyed my drop-in at Tchoup Shop. Had a cup of gumbo and a house bloody mary.Appreciated the straightforward nature of the bloody mary. Great mix, with moderate heat profile, simple, not trying too hard. Sometimes they can be overspiced, or like drinking a spiked can of crushed tomatoes. It's a beverage, so keep it shy of milkshake consistency please. Nice pickled green bean, and pickle.Gumbo was delicious. Really delicious. Tough thing to make, and it's pulled off here with all the complexity necessary, without being too rich or spicy. It had heat, and I didn't even ask for the Crystal's. I just enjoyed this terrific rendition.Tons of other great looking menu items btw - wish I had been hungrier!",5.0
"I honestly didn't even think this was the place, I thought it was just a bar. I had this place bookmarked for a while since I love Cajun/Creole food and I have been trying to find something similar in the New York area. I thought Tchoup Shop was just OK, I think the biggest issue I had with all the dishes was the salt factor.The food:Gumbo- This came along with a Yelp check in which was awesome. It was one of the better Yelp offers but I think it came off rather salty and it was kinda too mild in flavor, I did enjoy the piece of duck, though. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Brisket-Duck Liver Boudin Balls- Creole mustard, handmade pickles. I am a big fan of boudin but the ones here were just OK. The flavor wasn't really pronounced. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Shrimp N' Grits- Bacon, hedge hog mushrooms. I enjoyed the overall flavor of the shrimp and grits but it was salty for me, I also thought the texture of the polenta was way too thick. I did, however, really enjoyed the shrimp and the bacon was also a nice addition. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Red Eyed Bandit- Eggs, tasso, biscuit n' sausage gravy. I thought this dish was going to be an automatic winner, it was also one that the waiter recommended, I liked the flavor of the dish but it came off pretty heavy and greasy. The chicken cutlet was nice with the gravy but there wasn't a lot of flavor and the gravy was salty. I did enjoy the biscuit. yelp.com/user_local_phot…",3.0
"My friends and I wandered in here after going to see the Bushwick Collective. It is a nice cozy shop with both bar and lounge seating. We had high expectations because of the good reviews. Two of us ended up ordering the Crispy Chicken Biscuit and the gumbo (which was free for checking in. Thanks Yelp!) Our other friend ordered the quiche. The gumbo was definitely the only highlight of the meal. It had a nice kick to it and the duck was stewed perfectly. The chicken biscuits were very meh. The sauce on them tasted great but the biscuit was hard like a rock and the chicken was tough and difficult to chew. It was disappointing to pay $8 for a tiny, hard biscuit that left us hungry and unsatisfied. The quiche was just okay. There are definitely better brunch spots around.",3.0
"We were really excited for this place, came in with very high expectations due to other yelpers reviews, but as the night went on we were VERY disappointed. We ordered the Crispy Chicken Biscuit, the Catfish Po'boy, and the Crawfish Mac and Cheese. Each dish was edible, but not enjoyable whatsoever. It was just bad. The chicken in the Chicken Biscuit tasted off, as if the meat was either reheated, or old which was an EXTREME disappointed because why would anyone want to eat chicken that's not fresh?! And then have to pay for it?! C'mon.The Fried Catfish Po'boy was just ok, nothing worth remembering at all. And the Crawfish Mac & Cheese was the same, unmemorable and lacking. This place could be great, the ambiance was chill, they had a very cool staff, but there is no love in the food at all! I left the restaurant very angry that I had to pay for food that made me want to cry! I wish I could've went back in time and went somewhere else. Sooooooooo upset. We will definitely not be back.",2.0
"When I left this place I was sad. Like really really sad. Note to self Jana, don't go anywhere bringing in your high expectations with you.I was in New Orleans back in September. So when I read reviews and they mention the following words:Just like New OrleansAmazing Cajun creole foodBold FlavorsYou get sucked up into that shit! I had this place bookmarked and was ready to take myself back to that New Orleans flavor, but I just didn't get there with this food. I have to go back though I'm just not convinced that this is all this place has to offer. I came to Tchoup Soup before 5 and maybe I didn't get the dinner menu. The menu I had didn't even have half of the items some of these reviews are mentioning. When I come back I'll provide an update but for now this place just didn't do it for me.",2.0
"Got there on a Friday evening around 6:30pm. We sat outside and ordered the pork belly cracklin as appetizer and a 1/2 fried chicken and the bbq shrimp as main course. It took about 20min for the pork belly to come. I have never had ""real"" ones so I thought it was good, but my bf claims that it should be even harder on the inside. It took another 10 min for the other two dishes to come out, which was a long time for something that shouldn't take 30min. My bbq shrimp was great. I was forewarned by the waitress that i need to use my hand so i digged in. I used the bread to dip on that yummy sauce. I had a bite of the fried chicken and I thought it was a bit dry. I didn't think it was a bad experience at all but i wish the food came out a little sooner. It was my first time for me and my bf to eat in Bushwick and it was good.",4.0
"Cool little spot in bushwick. First time here with the hubs, 20 min from E.NY. Sat brunch menu looked good but, we opted for the Duck Gumbo. The gumbo was ridiculously spicy but so good.  The duck balls was good as well, and we had earl grey tea which also good.  Will def. Come back.",4.0
"i came here for brunch on sunday and man this place did not disappoint! We started off with the bloody mary's (we ordered the bacon, house and rosemary). i personally prefer my bloody mary's thick and with a bite but this was appropriate since we were eating cajun. it was a bit mild, not over powering with the hot sauce but very tasty.we ordered the pork crackling, gumbo, crawfish mac n cheese for starters and it was all tasty. it was a great starter to our entree. we ordered a catfish po boy, a chicken fried steak with boullanese sauce on a bisket and a tangy chicken biscuit (the name slips my mind atm). and i just found out the menu is rotating, which is pretty awesome. i'll definitely be back to try out the rest of the menu and bringing more friend's along with me.",5.0
"Totally worth the trip. Good and friendly wait staff. Drinks brought timely. Really good dark and stormy and Moscow mule. Had the free cup of gumbo on Yelp. Duck and okra. Yummy. Collard greens delicious. Crawfish Mac and cheese absolutely creamy, crunchy and wonderful. Chicken biscuit was sweet and spicy. Would definitely return.",4.0

"This is the closest I've found to authentic New Orleans cuisine in NYC since Cooking with Jazz closed down. The chef and some of the staff have spent a considerable amount of time in the Crescent City and it shows on the menu.You can safely go ahead and order things like jambalaya and gumbo (with duck and okra) without fear. The sauce that covers the BBQ shrimp is delicious and comes with plenty of bread for dipping. Speaking of carbs, their biscuits are also delicious. They have crawfish mac n cheese, something I'll be back to try in the future.Abita Purple Haze, Pimms Cup. Friendly, engaging, capable staff that gave me recommendations and places to visit in NOLA. There's a front area by the bar with plenty of seating and one massive TV that was playing the Mets game the night I came. There's a spacious back area with more seating and a second bar. Two bathrooms.",4.0
"Can only speak for their brunch...it is AMAZING. One of the best in Bushwick...try it for yourself. I was with a group of four, so we ordered a bunch of things and split it all. Everything we tried was perfect. We especially loved the chicken biscuit. The cocktails were great, service was average. Outside seating...dog friendly.

"My buddy is from New Orleans and I've been dying to try Tchoup Shop.I tell him, listen I have this place that has some outrageous creole food. Except its in Brooklyn.Where in Brooklyn? Don't worry, you're with me, I'm Mister Brooklyn! (I don't tell him years ago Bushwick was a place where my grandfather got mugged. It's all hipsters now)So we're driving in Bushwick at night in this industrial looking neighborhood. I see a bar among the gray buildings.This is it! This is it? A bar. You're taking us to a bar that has cajun food?Yup. It's Brooklyn!Sure enough, we walk through a bar (Hipsters everywhere) and in the back is the restaurant or dining area if you will. We sit and they are rockin' the music! I order a happy hour Left Hand Milk Stout to get the party started. Appetizers are ordered. I ordered the Fried Pork Belly. If this sounds crazy to you, its the most sane thing in the world. Its a decadent dish that's fatty and meaty. Oh, it was so good and I highly recommend this dish for the first time you come to Tchoup Shop.We all order their signature biscuits. My southern bud orders a seafood Po Boy.I ask him: Is it good? Just like home? (Repeat 20 more times)I ordered the Duck Gumbo. The Duck Gumbo is good! Spicy and flavorful, its just spot on.Here's the kicker, my entire meal was under $30 bucks. (I love you Tchoup Shop chef)We both wanted to try their shrimp and grits dish but they were out of shrimp.Out of shrimp? Go to the jerk store! (Sorry, Seinfeld joke)The waiter, total hipster. Didn't write anything down and tells me I ordered a chicken biscuit. I tell him I ordered a ""biscuit"". I should knock off a star but the food was outstanding.Think about this neighborhood. The L train goes straight into NYC. I can see this as an up and coming neighborhood over the next 10 years. Build more Tchoup Shop places, they will come.10 yelp stars!",5.0

"The search for boudin balls is over. Cue Tchoup Shop.I've made it no secret of my food lust for boudin balls. They're not native to these parts (Hello Louisiana), which makes it supremely difficult to find them and so many Cajun establishments somehow neglect this simple staple from their menu. I had all but given up the search, that is, till I found Tchoup Shop (#1) via a Yelp event nearly 4 years ago. Back then they were at DBA (yelp.com/biz/d-b-a-brook…), but they now operate 7 days a week at Heavy Woods (yelp.com/biz/heavy-woods…).These boudin balls are only of one kind, duck liver with brisket, which is nothing less than wonderful. The crispy exterior met with the creamy pate of the duck liver and savory, tender brisket meat is a bite that makes life worth living. It is one thing I would and coud do over and over again. One might balk at the lack of boudin ball variety, but I'm just happy to have any at this point. This is a fabulous start.The accolades don't just stop there. The rest of the Cajun offerings are stellar on their seasonal and often rotating menu of southern inspired items. Red beans and rice, duck gumbo, and catfish po boy are certainly legit. Even the deviled eggs and hush puppies are guilty pleasures; definitely an upgrade from one's usual bar food.Here's to their continued success and hope they'll certainly consider expanding their operations beyond Bushwick at some point. ::coughs:: Queens is open! ::coughs::_________(#!)

My fiancé got the burger special and he felt it was overcooked, but tasted good otherwise.With the bad service, the only thing that could have redeemed the restaurant in my eyes would have been outstanding food...but since the food was not outstanding in the least and certainly not worth the cost, I have to give this place two thumbs down.One last note...there are items on the menu called ""The Beaner"" and ""French Fuck."" I'm sure they think it's funny, but I find it derogatory and insensitive.",1.0

"The food & the service are great! 5 stars for the food! Minus 1 star because the utensils were not clean. We got the duck gumbo, jambalaya, chicken biscuit, boudin balls, & the crawfish mac n' cheese. We love them all but our favorites were the gumbo, the chicken biscuit, & the crawfish mac n' cheese. Everything were perfectly spiced & packed full of flavor. The portion may look kind of small but somehow we were pretty full & we have big appetite. We were here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. The place weren't that busy. We were seated immediately. The service was great! Our cups were never empty! When the waitress see our cups is low, she immediately filled them with water. She's also friendly & polite. All total, we spent about $40. They are inside a bar called Heavy Woods on the corner of Wyckoff & Willoughby. Highly recommended! We'll definitely go back!",4.0
"Traveled here on a snowy day and I do not regret the trip one bit. My first bite of Holy Shit-take left me in a daze, I didn't know what to do with myself. So salty, so amazing.My friend's first bite of the gumbo left her wide-eyed and she just stared at it like ""wtf just happened.""I'm so serious, I can't even. Service was perfect. Thanks guys!",5.0

Food is yummy service is good. This place is a hidden gem Brooklyn. The menu is always changing so try to call ahead to see what they're serving. I think the larger menu stays pretty much the same every year but the smaller one change almost every week. Makes it harder to order out for pick up. That's why I take a quick snap shot of the menu each time I go. I haven't been dissapointed at any of the foods I've selected. It's so flavorful!,5.0
"Went for brunch and it was amazing. The service was friendly and helpful. Food was amazing, definitely coming back to try the rest of the menu.

"Brought my parents here for Fathers Day lunch. We got the catfish po' boy, crawfish mac n cheese, and the chicken biscuit. Of em all, the chicken biscuit was the only really flavorful thing. The mac and cheese did not ahve mych taste. The crawfish tasted fresh but not in a tasty way, not enough seasoning at all. The catfish po' boy was ok. I was really excited about this spot when I saw it and the reviews. Not sure how this place got 4.5 stars but I wasnt really impressed.",2.0
"As a lot of amazing finds begin, I came along with my friends who found this place and wasn't really expecting anything. But damn, I was blown away by the food here. Every single thing was amazing. It started with the free cup of gumbo that comes when you check in through Yelp -- perfectly balanced with bits of crispy duck for pleasant bites of texture. Then, came the soft shelled crab and BBQ pork belly slider that looks kinda freaky bc it's a whole crab sitting between buns (reminded me of Sebastian from the Little Mermaid meeting his fate). But it was my favorite thing I've eaten all year. Boom.Next, there was the crab cakes which I didn't eat much of but was also delicious. And the the crawfish Mac n cheese, which was he server's favorite. That was deliciously cheesy with browned cheese on top (like French onion soup or pizza).Then came some kind of fried chicken sandwich that looked and tasted like it was really well though out. Another delicious plate!He ambiance is very chill (and dark), kinda like a lounge in the back where we sat.I would highly recommend this place for dinner.",5.0
"Great food for a great price.  I find it hard to have real Cajun food in NY.  This is very close.  I have liked everything I've tried here.  I especially liked the chicken biscuit sandwich, the soups, gumbo, really I have liked everything except maybe the Boudin balls.  I have been there twice and each time their dessert of the night was great.  I liked their mac and cheese but the last time it needed salt.  Otherwise I really enjoy it.  T",4.0

Served with a spicy mayo. Delicious!Price: not worth it in my book.. Decently priced but probably won't come back bc of the service and not worth paying for it.,3.0

But no way near a fried catfish po'boy. The gumbo, on the other hand - woo wee! That was delicious, and tasted just like NOLA to me.  Had the boudin balls as well, which came which a refreshing yet spicy dip that I would recommend.   And props to all the Abita on tap and good happy hour specials.  I'll definitely be back to try something on the menu w/o a bread base.",3.0

The ""Awesome Deviled Egg"" was a tad salty for my taste but it was very creamy & delicious. The Green Onion potato salad was perfectly balanced & seasoned to perfection! The Fried Catfish Po Boy was served on a baguette with a creamy & spicy mayonnaise & sweet pickle slices. The catfish itself was crunchy, yet light & also seasoned really well. The Pork Po Boy was awesome! The pork was lean, tender, & extremely flavorful & the spicyness of the mayonnaise smeared on the crispy baguette & the sweetness of the peach chutney all balanced each other out & was superb!

"I've been coming here for almost a year now, and it's by far the best restaurant in the area. My favorite things on the menu are the pork belly cracklin, gumbo, crispy chicken biscuit, and jambalaya. If you're coming here, make sure that you order something that comes with a biscuit, because it's one of the best biscuits I've ever had. As much as I love this place, I do have to dock one star because of how slow they are. After ordering, it usually takes about 20 minutes for the food to come out, even if they aren't busy. That being said, the food is worth the wait. Just don't come here if you're in a rush. Most importantly though, make sure you wear stretchy pants.",4.0

If you've tried to find anything resembling Creole/Cajun cuisine in NYC you obviously do.I've been majorly disappointed in most of the so called Creole/Cajun places in the NYC area (Delta Grill, and Stan's Place were really disappointing.and Great Jones Cafe was so-so  ).The Tchoup Shop pop-up in DBA  is the most authentic NOLA inspired dining experience I've had in NYC area. They get  it right. Spicy doesn't mean purely hot. There is a kick to the dishes but it's also rich and flavorful. Other restaurants seem to think excess cayenne or salt make it  Creole. From the rich, thick , dark roux , to the properly dressed po-boy's, Tchoup Shop does NOLA cuisine justice.The gumbo is hearty, thick and flavorful.  A rich and dark roux, as opposed to the more water-y soup other places pass off as gumbo.FYI- If you're tasting chunks of celery or green pepper the gumbo  has not been cooked long enough.The po'boys I've had (catfish and shrimp) weren't as large as i remember from times in the South but every bit as flavor-able.Truthfully the only disappointment I've had here were  the crab fingers.It didn't taste bad , but was small for the price ($10) and a bit of a chore to eat..

"Tchoup Shop is my first taste of New Orleans in Brooklyn. Deep Fried, Heavy, Bold and Filling!Everything on the menu sounds interesting!

(FYI, this is the third full meal of the day and it is not even 2 pm yet!)Watching the chef preparing our food at the makeshift popup kitchen is a treat in itself.

"You'll find this New Orleans cuisine gem tucked away in a bar called Heavy Woods. I was a bit skeptical at first because gumbo and po' boys can only be so enticing on a sweltering hot summer day. We ordered the chicken biscuit, pork belly and a small gumbo soup. A little pricey, but totally worth it!! We started out with the pork belly appetizer, which was great! Really flavorful and they give you this mayonnaise sauce to dip the pork belly in that adds a little kick to each bite. The chicken biscuit came in a small tin plate. Delicious chicken sandwiched between two buttery biscuits from heaven smothered in a delectable sweet barbecue sauce. The gumbo was hearty and so delicious. The quality of food here is great and really authentic. The atmosphere is a bit divey, but in the most perfect way. I'll be coming back for more Southern comfort food soon enough.",5.0
"So my husband and I decided to try something  new after a very long week and decided to come here, TERRIBLE MISTAKE DO NOT COMES HERE!!

Waiting another 20-30 minutes for our food to come out, the pictures did no justice for the the way the food was presented and how it tastedFirst of all the ""burgers"" are rhe size of sliders, very small for $12 nothing on the side! Not worth it at all. Secondly the chicken fried pork tasted like something that I whipped  up at home in ten minutes after downing a bottle of wine to the face. I asked the waitress very politely for hot sauce and she NEVER brought it until after I was done she asked if I still wanted it...umm NO?! MY DINNER IS COLD NOW THANK YOU FOR NOTHING",1.0

"I've been coming here for almost a year now, and it's by far the best restaurant in the area. My favorite things on the menu are the pork belly cracklin, gumbo, crispy chicken biscuit, and jambalaya. If you're coming here, make sure that you order something that comes with a biscuit, because it's one of the best biscuits I've ever had. As much as I love this place, I do have to dock one star because of how slow they are. After ordering, it usually takes about 20 minutes for the food to come out, even if they aren't busy. That being said, the food is worth the wait. Just don't come here if you're in a rush. Most importantly though, make sure you wear stretchy pants.",4.0

I've never seen such a happy staff. ( I work in the wedding industry.. I see alot..) They went BEYOND what we expected from them. They left the kitchen impeccable and stored our leftovers away,  which we enjoyed the next day, feeding 15 people. ...again.. so much food! Communication from day one was great, and I personally think Simon should give himself a big fat raise..

"You hear about this being a top chef's restaurant and you begin to giddy with joy.  But you notice that this place is not what you think. It's a gastropub type atmosphere with that southern/cajun/creole vibe and friendliness. While the beer selection is amazing. The food can be a little bit underwhelming.  The gumbo that I got had too much of a smoked flavor/smell to it. It was as if it was burnt.  The spices/flavor/spiciness was masked by that smoky burnt taste. And that just ruined the soup.  The biscuit that I ordered with it was also burnt. But the brisket sandwich...now that is some good brisket. Unfortunately, the bread could not withstand the gravy that came with the brisket. By the second bite, the bread had become nothing more than a pile of mush. While this restaurant has some promise, I wouldnt come here expecting anything gourmet, rather come here expecting food that accompanies the drinks, which is the main highlight of this place.The area is great, so its definitely worth the try. But go with lowered expectations and drink merrily and watch some sports on the TV's on the walls.",3.0
"I love it that they provide a different type of eatery in my neighborhood other than spanish food (good but SALTY!!) I think that it is also cool that they serve it in a bar with rustic atmosphereThe flavors of the food is good, quite great. But what I dont like is the portions and the price. I ordered like 5 dishes, and I paid about 70 bucks for an order to go. Everything came in a soup cup. I was confused as hell.I ordered the shrimp, it came with crusty bread that looked about half a loaf. When I opened the container, it had tons and tons of spices like bay leafs, lemon, etc etc. And only 3 pieces of shrimp...I was pretty dissapointed because I paid for shrimp, not half a loaf of bread that I can dip into the shrimp juice/spice mixture. The told my hubby that the food is good but they are pushing out food that I can get at a food truck type of quality. But not worth the price, certainly I dont here often....only once in blue.Also because this place is a bar first (heavy woods) and a restaurant/food joint second it isnt good for groups. It isnt a sit down dinner place, and certainly not good for children. Especially with their patrons, that are much more chic and hipster. When I went to pick up my order, there was a guy who was friends with the bartender...he was drunk and high as hell, talking all sorts of gibberish. lol. So yea, NOT GOOD for kids.",3.0

I loved the red beans and rice, but my ""I'm-way-more-cajun-than-you"" friend insisted they weren't all that and a bag of chips. We also had some sort of crab and pork meatball po' boy, which to me was really more like a swagged out bahn mi, but was pretty great as well.I'll definitely go back for the chicken biscuit and a few other snacks again; just bring some good company and drink a lot because you'll be ignored by the staff (table full of dishes, not enough silverware for 2 people to eat like humans, basic shit like that).",4.0
"Went this past Saturday.  I'm not sure if my expectations were blown out of proportion from reading these reviews, but my reaction? Meh. I'm guessing the beer goggles  (food is cooked in a corner of a sports bar - which is by far the most interesting quality about them) contributed to the overly high praise of the reviewers?  Menu items certainly sounded ambitious, but delivery missed its mark.The duck confit sandwich - an essentially dolled up grilled cheese with tasty morsels of ducks on overburnt (black) toast pieces - did not merit its high price (12 bucks). The more reasonably priced serving of the daily gumbo (chicken and boudin sausage) was rather bland and mediocre - though it was piping hot.",3.0

"It's INSIDE Heavy Woods! My sister and I walked back and forth in front of the place for a while until we realized it shares space with Heavy Woods. I have no idea why they want to distinguish one from the other. But who cares? When the food is this good, they can do whatever the hell they want to. My sister and I agreed that the food here is pretty much perfect in every way. The food is tasty, expertly prepared, and perfectly proportioned. I had something that was a variation on an Eggs Benedict that had biscuits, gravy, thick bacon, and spiced fried eggs on top. It was heavenly. Every bite was satisfying with a burst of fun flavors. What's more, the serving size was made for a human, not a giant, and so when I was done, I felt perfectly satisfied without feeling stuffed.Tchoup Shop is now officially on my ""I Love Bushwick"" list of go-to places for food. So damn good. Can't wait to introduce more folks to the magic.",5.0
"So I previously raved about this place because their food is delicious. That hasn't changed I assume but the service is TERRIBLE! After waiting for 15 minutes to be waited on the waitress came over and took our food and app order. We didn't want alcoholic beverages, we just wanted water. She got a little crabby after pushing us to buy drinks and we still refused. 20 minutes goes by and no water and no app. I get up and ask her for water because we are really thirsty. She says okay. No sorry or anything. After 5 minutes she grabs a growler of water and 2 cups and puts it on our table and walks away.  We wait another 20 mins and still no app or food or any correspondence with any wait staff. I ask the bartender to tell our waitress to check if our food is ready because they had plates waiting outside of the kitchen for about 10-15 minutes with no waitstaff checking on them. Even if that was our food it would've been cold at that point. She went over to check food and was annoyed that she checked because our food wasn't there. We walked out immediately. Neither of us (my boyfriend and I) have ever walked out of a restaurant. This fully deserved it. It's disappointing because I really wanted that burger. The waitress was absolutely horrible and didn't care at all. If she wanted us to buy drinks so bad to boost her tip she should have just done her job and been a good waitress. Never wasting an hour being starving here again.",1.0

"The foods amazing. The service is laughable. Don't come for the service. Come for the food. Gumbo was incredible and had a serious kick. I loved the red beans and rice, but my ""I'm-way-more-cajun-than-you"" friend insisted they weren't all that and a bag of chips. We also had some sort of crab and pork meatball po' boy, which to me was really more like a swagged out bahn mi, but was pretty great as well.I'll definitely go back for the chicken biscuit and a few other snacks again; just bring some good company and drink a lot because you'll be ignored by the staff (table full of dishes, not enough silverware for 2 people to eat like humans, basic shit like that).",4.0
"Went this past Saturday.  I'm not sure if my expectations were blown out of proportion from reading these reviews, but my reaction? Meh. I'm guessing the beer goggles  (food is cooked in a corner of a sports bar - which is by far the most interesting quality about them) contributed to the overly high praise of the reviewers?  Menu items certainly sounded ambitious, but delivery missed its mark.The duck confit sandwich - an essentially dolled up grilled cheese with tasty morsels of ducks on overburnt (black) toast pieces - did not merit its high price (12 bucks). The more reasonably priced serving of the daily gumbo (chicken and boudin sausage) was rather bland and mediocre - though it was piping hot.",3.0
"The food here was amazing! I'm not well versed with New Orleans cuisine but I know great food. HOWEVER the service sucks. Please hire people that aren't socially awkward. A quick hi won't kill you, as a matter of fact....doing your job and serving customers is a part of the gig (this is my 3rd time here). Try the deviled eggs and bacon ends!",3.0
"It's INSIDE Heavy Woods! My sister and I walked back and forth in front of the place for a while until we realized it shares space with Heavy Woods. I have no idea why they want to distinguish one from the other. But who cares? When the food is this good, they can do whatever the hell they want to. My sister and I agreed that the food here is pretty much perfect in every way. The food is tasty, expertly prepared, and perfectly proportioned. I had something that was a variation on an Eggs Benedict that had biscuits, gravy, thick bacon, and spiced fried eggs on top. It was heavenly. Every bite was satisfying with a burst of fun flavors. What's more, the serving size was made for a human, not a giant, and so when I was done, I felt perfectly satisfied without feeling stuffed.Tchoup Shop is now officially on my ""I Love Bushwick"" list of go-to places for food. So damn good. Can't wait to introduce more folks to the magic.",5.0
"So I previously raved about this place because their food is delicious. That hasn't changed I assume but the service is TERRIBLE! After waiting for 15 minutes to be waited on the waitress came over and took our food and app order. We didn't want alcoholic beverages, we just wanted water. She got a little crabby after pushing us to buy drinks and we still refused. 20 minutes goes by and no water and no app. I get up and ask her for water because we are really thirsty. She says okay. No sorry or anything. After 5 minutes she grabs a growler of water and 2 cups and puts it on our table and walks away.  We wait another 20 mins and still no app or food or any correspondence with any wait staff. I ask the bartender to tell our waitress to check if our food is ready because they had plates waiting outside of the kitchen for about 10-15 minutes with no waitstaff checking on them. Even if that was our food it would've been cold at that point. She went over to check food and was annoyed that she checked because our food wasn't there. We walked out immediately. Neither of us (my boyfriend and I) have ever walked out of a restaurant. This fully deserved it. It's disappointing because I really wanted that burger. The waitress was absolutely horrible and didn't care at all. If she wanted us to buy drinks so bad to boost her tip she should have just done her job and been a good waitress. Never wasting an hour being starving here again.",1.0

"The chicken biscuit that is served at Tchoup Shop is undoubtedly the best chicken biscuit I've ever eaten in my life, and quite possibly the best thing involving chicken and/or biscuit I've ever eaten in my life, come to think about it.  This thing defies logic.  The chicken is unfathomably tender on the inside, falling apart like the most perfect of braised meats, yet the outside of the chicken is so crispy and saucy and zesty- it's just not fair to other pieces of chicken out there in the world.  The biscuit that it is served on is remarkably buttery and hot and moist.  They tie it all together with hot pepper jelly and cilantro.  While you couldn't make a meal out of the chicken biscuit alone, it is large and satisfying to all the senses- probably the best $7 item that one could purchase on a Sunday afternoon in Brooklyn.  Compliment it with some gumbo, boudin balls, or any of the other exceptionally-right-on items that are served up each weekend at this lovable pop-up restaurant, and you are going to be one happy camper.  Possibly wash it down with some of d.b.a's [ yelp.com/biz/d-b-a-brook… ] wonderful adult beverages, and you will likely be re-evaluating your favorite places to hang out in Bucktown.",5.0

"What the hell is a pop-up restaurant????

The creole mustard kindof has a wasabi like texture but a completely different effect.Crispy Confit Chicken Wings - Good ass wings..

"I literally wanted to eat everything on the menu. And I almost did. I tried the chicken biscuit, the gumbo, mac and cheese, pork belly cracklin, deviled eggs, and steak.

"I was born in and lived in New Orleans for years.    Tchoup Shop's food is some of the best NOLA cuisine you will find anywhere.   If I'm ever feeling a little hometown sickness, Tchoup Shop is the cure.     It doesn't hurt that they are hosted by d.b.a, with their awesome beer selection.   Great place to kickback on a Sunday.   I laugh at everyone waiting in their brunch lines as I make my way over here.  Muahahahah.",5.0
"Outside patio with makeshift tent and grill as kitchen. Who knew a simple grill could prepare such delicious food?? Order a couple of beers from the endless selection at the bar, kick back and relax. We ordered the duck gumbo, the oysters, the fried pork tail to start. Great flavor and taste to perfection. We also ordered the chicken biscuit and the catfish po' boy. My friend loved the chicken biscuit so much he was tempted to order one to go. I personally loved the po' boy - the catfish was sweet and tender and crisp but not oily. SO GOOD. Afterward we took a stroll in the beautiful neighborhood, attempting to walk off our health averse meal.",5.0

"The chicken biscuit that is served at Tchoup Shop is undoubtedly the best chicken biscuit I've ever eaten in my life, and quite possibly the best thing involving chicken and/or biscuit I've ever eaten in my life, come to think about it.  This thing defies logic.  The chicken is unfathomably tender on the inside, falling apart like the most perfect of braised meats, yet the outside of the chicken is so crispy and saucy and zesty- it's just not fair to other pieces of chicken out there in the world.  The biscuit that it is served on is remarkably buttery and hot and moist.  They tie it all together with hot pepper jelly and cilantro.  While you couldn't make a meal out of the chicken biscuit alone, it is large and satisfying to all the senses- probably the best $7 item that one could purchase on a Sunday afternoon in Brooklyn.  Compliment it with some gumbo, boudin balls, or any of the other exceptionally-right-on items that are served up each weekend at this lovable pop-up restaurant, and you are going to be one happy camper.  Possibly wash it down with some of d.b.a's [ yelp.com/biz/d-b-a-brook… ] wonderful adult beverages, and you will likely be re-evaluating your favorite places to hang out in Bucktown.",5.0

"Damn good & damn impressive.  New Orleans is one of my favorite cities in the world and its cuisine could go toe to toe with any other city on the globe.  OK, its probably impossible to recreate the experience fully in NYC for the simple fact that you cannot get the fresh ingredients(dayboat shrimp, crawfish) but these guys come pretty damn close, and its downright astonishing that they can do it with that tiny portable set-up.  Everything was excellent , standouts included the Duck-liver & Brisket Boudin Balls, fried baby artichokes with a delicious crawfish infused dill aioli, a melt in your mouth griddled duck confit sandwich well served by the brilliant selection of a delicious pumpernickel bread, the exemplary chicken biscuit, really good deviled eggs (which I am always a sucker for), and the bbq oysters.  Unlike what I was expecting, the oysters were completely different from the char grilled oysters served at Dragos in New Orleans, but were completely excellent in there own wholly different way.  The bar is dark and somewhat dank but it does not take away from the experience at all, besides they have a great branch of the establishment in NOLA.  They guys are way cool and you can tell they are putting their hearts and souls into this pop up.  I would love to see what they could do with their own place.  The prices are super gentle, befitting its extra casual setting.  The fact of the matter is this is most likely the closest you can come to getting the real deal New Orleans food experience without getting on a plane, but you really need to get on that plane.***100th review & I am glad it was one for this special event",4.0
"I came here with the double L's and did not realize Tchoup was not open this weekend.Fortunately for us, they left some gumbo and biscuit to please the crowd.I noticed everyone came here looking for some NOLA style flavour and were quickly disappointed.I was a bit nervous since L, is barely 2 years old and it was weird to have a baby in the bar and soon this bar got really crowded and crazy.We were waiting for our gumbo, that the girl bartender Sylvia estimated to be ready in 30 minutes. This was an hour or so ago, when she advised the time of the gumbo.She didn't even mention the biscuit until I inquired about them and lucky they could deliver the biscuit a lot quicker than the gumbo.L was hungry and we were already waiting for this damn gumbo forever.We got the biscuit, they burned it - I want to say despite the fact it was burnt around the edges, these biscuits were still good.We ended up ordering another order of the biscuits.3 hours later, FINALLY damn gumbo comes out and the guy with the dreads said, the person didn't know how to make rice and this is why it took so long, since they had to redo the rice.He made a unfavourable comment about Houston, but meanwhile homeboy is from Dallas - I wouldn't talk about H-Town, when you're from Dallas...okay!So yeah, talking mess about H-Town, when he didn't even want to admit he's from Dallas. Like really, don't act like you're so above H-Town and act like you're such a creative soul, but meanwhile you were hesitant to admit that you're not a native New Yorker and you're actually from Dallas.Anyways, moving on - The dread dude, I forgot his name, but he gave us a little bit of the gumbo without the rice and I want to say the gumbo was a bit too salty sans rice.With the rice, was less salty, but I really would have prefer if they took it easy on the salt.Also, I want to say the dread dude kept saying how he was going to be ""extra"" heavy handed when he ladle our soups into the metal bowls. Ummm, okay, I am sorry, but lucky we had the biscuits because the serving size of this gumbo and supposedly it was ""heavy handed"" was really sad.They didn't have any spoons, but the dread dude didn't even tell me this instead he kept telling me supposedly this lady was going to bring us another spoon.He made me wait and wait and he kept telling me spoon was coming shortly.Okay there were only three ladies there and one was a friend of Sylvia's who had to pitch in to help her friend out and nobody looked like they were looking for a spoon or getting me a spoon.I finally asked the brunette bartender, she had no clue about this spoon and she came back to say we actually don't have any spoons, but she found two forks.Ummm okay, I want to say the girl bartenders were all cool and sweet, but seriously the dread dude got to go. Why lie about the spoons and give us this run around about the gumbo. He kept saying it's coming and yada yada - meanwhile we waited 3 hours for this gumbo.Like seriously, this gumbo was not worth 3 hours of wait time!Biscuits were good and that's all I have to say!I would give this place another chance, but definitely when they're back in town.d.b.a should also take the Tchoup advertisement off of their chalk board, rather mislead people to come in and walk around aimlessly looking for food.If they're not there, just let people know only a very veryyyyy LIMITED menu is available.Also, there was this weird dude there, not sure if he was on crack or whatever - he was there before I got there and stay there after we left and the whole entire time he was there, I saw him in 5 different ensemble and he passed out flyers. But they actually weren't even flyers, they were just a Japanese post card that he handled it to me after he bowed to me.I didn't take the postcard, so he took it back and pass it to another table. Then he went to the side of the bar and grab all these miscellaneous cards, flyers and magazines and threw them onto the bar.Then he comes around me and opens up this realty magazine and leaves it there open and walks away.The fill-in bartender girl asked me what's his deal - I am like I don't know, but that fool is crazy.",2.0

"If you are not spending your Sunday afternoons in Williamsburg, you should be. Three coolers, two grills and one chef add up to one of the most sublimely enjoyable back garden barbecues in New York.DBA Brooklyn is a fine place to enjoy an assortment of well selected and constantly rotating beers and cask ales. The hard liquor selection is also well curated. The real surprise here is that in addition to such an agreeable array of liquids is the quality of the cooking.  The chef Simon Glen and his assistant cum waitress Melanie provide an almost impossibly perfect Sunday afternoon experience. The food is truly exceptional. Start with the wings. Grilled then tossed in a red pepper chili glaze, they arrive with a nice sprinkling of scallions. Next, the peel-and-eat shrimp. Colossal, they arrive simmering in butter, garlic, rosemary, lemons and Cajun spice. Make sure you suck the heads, and ask for extra bread, which is toasted on the open grill - you will want it to sop up every last drop of this sauce.  These two items are, for me, the franchise players. The rest of the menu is top to bottom solid. The oysters, the boudin and the three cold salads are all worth the very gentle pricing. I know that since this is my first review on Yelp and it is an enthusiastic one, the shill factor is high.  I want to be clear.  I do not work at DBA, am not the chef, and don't even know him. I stumbled upon this four weeks ago have been back for four consecutive Sundays. I wanted to spread the good word - Tchoup Shop deserves it.It is rare when one finds a menu that is from left to right on point and delicious.

"My buddy who went to Tulane has made DBA his LSU bar and DBA has made Tchoup Shop the food choice and it is a very good choice.Where to start? How about the Chicken Biscuits. A fried chicken thigh on a nice flaky biscuits with I think honey. These are raved about but were not my favorite thing I ate. The Shrimp Po'Boy was incredible, like a southern favorite served on east coast bread. But the best thing I had was the Boudin Balls made with Beef and Fois Gras, fry them up and serve them to me!Tchoup is a set place but Sunday's at DBA you can get some of this amazing food for yourself.",5.0
"I absolutely LOVED the food. I couldn't decide what to get so a couple of friends and I split a bunch of stuff.  The deviled eggs were deliciously flavorful and creamy, not a big fan of potato salad but really liked it here, pickled green beans had a nice kick, pork belly was the right combination of crispy and tender, the burger and brisket-duck liver boudin balls just melted in my mouth, hot sausage was really tasty and just loved the crawfish mac & cheese. There was a good amount of crawfish morsels, very tender and not rubbery. A very warm buttermilk biscuit that hits the spot.We sat at the bar and was greeted by a friendly and helpful bartender. Even got to meet Simon and was able to tell him how happy he made my taste buds. All in all pretty great. I don't even live in Bushwick and will be back for more,",5.0
FOOD : Great food.  Oysters were the best - had a tangy sweet sauce in them with some scallions.  Excellent.  The chicken biscuit is very good - agree with some of the previous reviewers that I havenot had chicken that good before.  The soft shell crab is very tasty too.  The gumbo is nice - but get a biscuit along with it.  The pork belly was ok - not bad but wouldn't order it again.  The duck liver balls were the only think I didn't care for.. But then I don't like duck. DRINK : This is at the back of a bar - so you get your beer from the bar.  Lots of nice beers on draft. DECOR : The food is in a small courtyard outside at the back of a bar.  I really liked it - went early so got atable outside... Weather was great and you can smell the bbq.  Not sure how it would be when it gets real crowded. SERVICE : No prblem wth the service. The waitress comes to the table to take the order for food and the drinks are self service from the bar. OVERALL : Definitely go for the oysters and the chicken biscuit.,5.0

The patio is small but charming, and if there's one place where NYC is more pleasant than in the summer, it's Nawlins. And hah, the L train is actually more pleasant than air travel these days.

"These WillyB hipster bars are getting kind of fancy, no? Cajun food in a bar? Really great idea. It's just a small area in the back of the bar - separate from the bar itself. Kind of odd, but they made it work.Too bad it was disappointing. It wasn't bad at all - definitely better than the usual bar food, not badly flavored. But it was just okay - nothing stuck out, nothing amazing. The only things I can recommend are the boudin balls - deep fried brisket and duck liver - and the sausage gumbo. Those were good. The one thing I really did not enjoy was the fried pig ear and cauliflower salad - it tasted bitter to me, though I managed to finish off the deep fried pig ears, of course....On the other hand, if you're drunk, you'd probably think this was delicious.",3.0
Outstanding high quality beer selection and amazing southern food coupled with passable service and a cool local crowd. Try the chicken biscuit. It doesn't get any better.,4.0

The best New Orleans food overall I've had outside of the south.

I can't judge the boudin sliders fairly because I swoon for anything boudin. Rice and beans wasn't as good as Willie Mae's but was better than most of what I've had in the quarter.

"My buddy who went to Tulane has made DBA his LSU bar and DBA has made Tchoup Shop the food choice and it is a very good choice.Where to start? How about the Chicken Biscuits. A fried chicken thigh on a nice flaky biscuits with I think honey. These are raved about but were not my favorite thing I ate. The Shrimp Po'Boy was incredible, like a southern favorite served on east coast bread. But the best thing I had was the Boudin Balls made with Beef and Fois Gras, fry them up and serve them to me!Tchoup is a set place but Sunday's at DBA you can get some of this amazing food for yourself.",5.0
"I absolutely LOVED the food. I couldn't decide what to get so a couple of friends and I split a bunch of stuff.  The deviled eggs were deliciously flavorful and creamy, not a big fan of potato salad but really liked it here, pickled green beans had a nice kick, pork belly was the right combination of crispy and tender, the burger and brisket-duck liver boudin balls just melted in my mouth, hot sausage was really tasty and just loved the crawfish mac & cheese. There was a good amount of crawfish morsels, very tender and not rubbery. A very warm buttermilk biscuit that hits the spot.We sat at the bar and was greeted by a friendly and helpful bartender. Even got to meet Simon and was able to tell him how happy he made my taste buds. All in all pretty great. I don't even live in Bushwick and will be back for more,",5.0
FOOD : Great food.  Oysters were the best - had a tangy sweet sauce in them with some scallions.  Excellent.  The chicken biscuit is very good - agree with some of the previous reviewers that I havenot had chicken that good before.  The soft shell crab is very tasty too.  The gumbo is nice - but get a biscuit along with it.  The pork belly was ok - not bad but wouldn't order it again.  The duck liver balls were the only think I didn't care for.. But then I don't like duck. DRINK : This is at the back of a bar - so you get your beer from the bar.  Lots of nice beers on draft. DECOR : The food is in a small courtyard outside at the back of a bar.  I really liked it - went early so got atable outside... Weather was great and you can smell the bbq.  Not sure how it would be when it gets real crowded. SERVICE : No prblem wth the service. The waitress comes to the table to take the order for food and the drinks are self service from the bar. OVERALL : Definitely go for the oysters and the chicken biscuit.,5.0
Chicken Buscuit and gumbo both blew my mind! Can't wait to go again!,5.0
"Go here and eat. I've uploaded a photo of the BBQ oyster. I will be attempting to recreate the duck and Boursin fritter for the rest of my life. The patio is small but charming, and if there's one place where NYC is more pleasant than in the summer, it's Nawlins. And hah, the L train is actually more pleasant than air travel these days. So yeah, for the time that Tchoup Shop is open, go here and eat.",5.0
"Great food by great people.  I think you can buy the pepper jelly that is served on the chicken biscuit by the jar - I could drink it, it's so good.  I've heard people complain that it's a little pricey for the size of the potions, but I disagree.  It's the perfect amount of food, and worth every penny.  Try it!",5.0
"These WillyB hipster bars are getting kind of fancy, no? Cajun food in a bar? Really great idea. It's just a small area in the back of the bar - separate from the bar itself. Kind of odd, but they made it work.Too bad it was disappointing. It wasn't bad at all - definitely better than the usual bar food, not badly flavored. But it was just okay - nothing stuck out, nothing amazing. The only things I can recommend are the boudin balls - deep fried brisket and duck liver - and the sausage gumbo. Those were good.

"I've been going to Tchoup Shop for 2 years now and it's never failed to impress me. Every item on the menu is amazing and I could easily write about them all, but I'll stick to a few of my must haves. The cajun burger and hot link are my personal favorites this summer, both perfectly seasoned with the right amount of heat. The two staples have to be the biscuit and peel 'n eat shrimp- they're life changing and a must have on your first visit. Some may complain that the service can be on the slower side, but for a Sunday afternoon BBQ, it's just right. With all the great press, things have started to pick up over the last few weeks and they now have a few waitresses to help things run smoothly. It's incredibly affordable, so make sure you tip them well! If you haven't gone yet, why not?!?",5.0
"The only thing I can complain about is the fact that I can't get this food everyday and sometimes it can take awhile to get your food when it gets busy at DBA since it is only available two days a week.  I am from New Orleans and LOVE creole/cajun food.  This is hands down as good as it gets outside of New Orleans.  The gumbo is fantastic, the biscuits are amazing, the soft shell crab is done perfectly and everything I have ever tried here has been delicious.  I wouldn't be surprised to see this guy start his own restaurant in the near future.  Truly representing NOLA cuisine in the best way possible!",5.0
"My first time at the DBA Bar, I wanted something strong. The bartender suggested an espresso stout or something, about 9-10%. Good stout. On to the food...I played it safe since it was my first time and got the Crispy Chicken Biscuit with homemade red pepper jelly and the Thai Chili pickled green beans. Green beans, which I rarely go out of my way to eat, were great...spicy and pickled and juicy.  The chicken n biscuit were pretty damn good...the red pepper jelly definitely makes it..not too sweet, some crispiness on the chicken, nice thick biscuit..I'm no expert on Southern Cuisine, but this meal altogether was done well. After talking to the two guys running the operation(who were cool as hell), they gave me two boudin balls(pause) on the house to try. Maybe not the tastiest things of the day, but definitely some nice crunchy texture on the outside and mixed well with the homemade mustard. I'll be going back next weekend to try out the pork tongue, belly, and whatever random parts they'll be cooking up....look forward to adding one more star",4.0

The gumbo, red beans and rice, cajun wings and broiled shrimp all were flavorful.
