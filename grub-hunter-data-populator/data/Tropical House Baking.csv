This place is not glamorous but I could careless!!! I get my hair done in Brooklyn so every time I come to Brooklyn I need to get some Caribbean food since Harlem is seriously deprived in the Caribbean section...... Long story short this place good next time I'm in BK I will be buying a dozen frozen chicken patties,4.0
"So I was born and raised in Crown Heights and I think I only went to this bakery once as a child--I don't know why we didn't go more but better late than never. I was actually playing around with the Yelp app and tapped the monocle feature (you tilt your phone and nearby business pop up) and saw Tropical House Bakery. Tropical House Bakery is an Asian-Jamaican bakery where you can get your savory and sweet island baked goods. After reading the reviews, I bookmarked it to try the next time I'm home. I'm really glad I checked this place out! It's a no-frills place--can comfortably hold three people at a time and as mentioned in other reviews, you have to place your order through the bulletproof glass; you place your money in the box thingy and swivel it to the other side to get your food. I ordered two beef patties, two chicken patties and one veggie patty with coco bread. I didn't get to try the chicken and veggie patties (step-father ate them...grrr) but the beef patty was on point. It was nice and spicy with a flaky but not too flaky crust, which is just the way I like it. I'll definitely get more the next time I'm home--I'll just have to do a better job hiding them ;-).",4.0
"I was in the area for work and googled the closest patty restaurant in the area. I read the previous yelp reviews so I was not surprised to find a bullet proof glass. I was surprised to find out that is run by Jamaicans of Asian decent. The patty was very good. I ordered a mild beef patty, which was very tasty. I would say this place is definitely better than Golden Krust. If I am in there area, I am definitely coming back!",4.0
Dennis!!! The best of everything! Been coming here for thirty years...nothing better for Jamaican baked goods. Nowhere better in Brooklyn. Love Dennis and his family.,5.0
"Best patties in town, since long time.",5.0
"I had the beef, and chicken patties with coco bread. Both were oversized and packed with flavour. The chicken patty was mildly spicy. Try it out if you're in the area!",5.0
"Hands down, the best patties you will ever have. Golden Krust who?? This is a Caribbean bakery joint owned by Chinese Jamaicans. I'll admit, part of the reason I like  coming to this spot is because I love hearing the Jamaican accents of the Chinese owners. But know that I keep coming back here because the food is really bomb.com...I usually get a pattie (beef or chicken) and some coco bread. And it's hella cheap! I'm talking less than $3 cheap! They also have all the Caribbean bakery items that my West Indian fam reminisce about when they were youngins. Breadfruit, coconut cake, sugar buns... Trust me, this is a spot to hit up if your cash flow is low, but your stomach doesn't know (I rhymed, haha...and yes, it was intentional...sue me! Lol!)",5.0
The best patties you ever want to eat.. once you go here you will never go anywhere else..,5.0
"I'm not used to going to bakeries with bulletproof glass. I'm not saying they don't exist, I just tend not to visit them. With that said, one day while craving a beef patty and missing the taste of the homemade patties that my grandmother used to make, I ventured in to find a little lady behind lots of glass and a line that almost extended to the sidewalk (that last point is a pretty good sign). I ordered a beef patty though there were many other options on the menu. It was recently baked and hit the hunger spot. For a $2 snack it wasn't bad, but I wasn't overwhelmed. I wouldn't run past this place, but wouldn't exactly run to it either. Again I'm biased and was comparing it to beef patties of the past filled with love and bundled in nostalgia. Totally not a fair comparison, but it's my reference point.",2.0
Of course I stopped by for a patty an coco bread something I've eaten growing up and this place did not disappoint. Been around for many years and glad their still going strong.,5.0
"I grew up around there, left for US Navy 24 yrs. later I still  keep coming back to Brooklyn to that store for Beef Patty I get a 50 box to go and I smash 10 before I hit the NJ turn pike!! the best beef patty in history when you bite into one the meat falls out and burn your tongue cause it is so fresh and tasty!!",5.0
This place been around for more than 10 years and considering how gentrified Crown Heights is getting Im glad this establishment still exists. The quality of the food is still great!,5.0
"Strongly in the running for Best Crown Heights Pattie, The dough is a smidge tougher than Silver Krust, which in this case is a good thing, as Silver Krust's excessive flakiness and tenderness has a little bit of a too-French feeling. The filling is savory and meaty. The patties are just the right size to offer the perfect filling-to-crust ration in every bite. The coconut tarts are delicious as well, with a strong hit of spice that lets you know you're eating Caribbean. You can tell this restaurant has seen 30 years of Crown Heights michegas because the friendly staff is completely encased in industrial-strength bullet-proof glass, but the food that comes through the turntable makes you glad they've survived this long and hope the encroaching gentrification doesn't kill the excellent long-time businesses on Schenectady Ave.",5.0
"Fantastic, fresh and authentic Jamaican Beef patties. It's a small place that can get very busy, so you may have to wait on line for a few minutes but it's well worth it! My personal favorites are the regular beef patty and the beef and cheese patty. Staff is very pleasant.",4.0
"I bypassed my usual beef patty spot in Brooklyn to try this new one and was pissed. LOL. I wasnt put off by the bullet-proof glass divider because safety comes first. What I was put off by was the untasty patties and hard ass coco bread. The patties reminded me of the frozen patties you get in the supermarket. I am sorry because I saw the rave reviews on Yelp and couldnt believe what was in my mouth when I tasted them. Shockingly I enjoyed the veggie patty better than the beef. Next time I want my mouthwatering spicy patties I will trek it to my regulart spot at ""Pitkin Caribbean Bakery.""",2.0
"I never ordered my patties from the other side of bullet proof glass before. It was kind of off putting and made me feel like should I really be here?! The answer was yes. The veggie patties were  really good and cheap. I would not stop here if I wasn't passing it, but I am glad I made the stop.",4.0
Bangin patty's. $1.70 each !! Great flavor inside of them.Throw some cheese on it!!!Hit this spot up.,5.0
"You order through bullet proof glass and place your money into a revolving platform. Delicious, juicy, moist, fluffy, are all accurate descriptions of their patties. Unlike other beef patties I had, you can actually see the pieces of ground beef when you bite inside. They are just peppery enough to have you wanting more but not so much that your mouth burns. Always served piping hot, careful if you may burn your mouth. They also serve veggie and chicken patties, I liked the beef the mostThey also have a large selection of sweet pastries. I enjoyed the currant roll, almoat like raisin bread. Their giant coconut macaroon was moist and chewy. Coco bread is just bread that's slightly sweet, didn't taste any coco or coconut Homemade ginger beer was had plenty of ginger but was much too sweet and not very carbonatedAt 1.50 a patty, I'll definitely be back!",5.0
"Decor: 3.5/5-The place is bullet-proof. The transfer food and money, there is a bullet-proof turn table lolService: 3.5/5-very friendly Asian ladyFood: 5/5-Whoa! The Beef patties were great, stuffed with ground meat and only $1.50 each!Two were fairly filling",5.0

"Dem patties jamaican me craaazy!Have just one, and every time you walk down Schenectady, you'll ""FOLLOW YOUR NOSE!"" Cause trust me- it WILL know!

I CROWN these: THE BOMB!  Baffled to see not a single review, I had to do a little extra sleuthing ... Dennis Young is ""Jamasian""- a Chinese Jamaica. Speaking to his Korean wife, I found out this humble little bakery stand (it's all point and take away- no sit and eat) has been around for close to 30 years (29 and change)!  I've thoroughly enjoyed my AHA moments while seated on a nearby Eastern Parkway bench savoring every tasty bite of those curry-inspired chicken patties. They're my faaaave AND... the best $1.50 you'll find yourself spending here in Brooklyn!~Too, I've decided it makes PERFECT sense:1. HOW one might master the art of the Jamaican patty in 3 decades2.  WHY their assortment of baked goods can be found locally within grocery stores3. WHY this Crown Heights gem is a must-try!! While there's a large variety of breads (coco!) and treats, I'm always blinded by my passion for these patties! They're always oven hot, baked and NOT fried, and service behind the glass window is always uber-friendly!  Preferring my crust less crunchy, and more hearty, one look at these picture-perfect golden pockets, and you too will be running this way for some homemade Jamaican goodness!",5.0
