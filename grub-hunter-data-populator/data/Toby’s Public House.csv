My kids took my husband and I here and told us that the mushroom ravioli were going to change our lives!  They sure did!  Hands down these are the best raviolis we've ever had.  The pizza was phenomenal and we can't wait to come back for more.,5.0
"Cool atmosphere. I have to applaud the waitress. Why on earth they had one server on New Years Eve to cover the door, all the tables, food, and running to the bar for the entire restaurant is beyond me. She also had to bus all the tables. Insanity. We were a walk in table of 5. We waited awhile but were happy to do so. The food was very good. I recommend the prosciutto/asparagus/mozzarella appetizer. Also the Bufalina pizza was delish. If you want a bar atmosphere with great pizza, this place is definitely worth 'checking-in' to.",4.0

"I was SO disappointed. This used to be one of my favorite places to go when I visited my sister.  Now, the food was not memorable and the service was lack luster. The service was not acceptable. The hipster waiter spent more time on his cell phone behind the counter then he did with our service.  I will not go back.",2.0
"The magherita pizza wasn't as crispy as I imagined it to be. Waitress wasn't attentive to us but she was with every other table.

"One of the most expensive, but delectable pizzas I've ever had. $18 for an individual pie, no bigger than a frisbee, is no steal, but it's damn delicious!I got the buffalo mozzarella and tomato with additional prosciutto. Fresh quality ingredients. Ugh it was AMAZING! Crispy, salty, sweet, robust.... Perfect. I ate the entire pie!! Lol never happens. Service was great, very sweet and helpful so I don't understand the off putting reviews about it.Will totally be doing it again! 4 stars for pricing, it's Brooklyn, not Manhattan. Take off $4, and it would be totally fine.",4.0
"Went here as it is down the street from friend's place. Nice, cozy little cash-only corner pub. Pizza menu has some interesting choices that all sounded delicious. We started with the Spinach and Artichoke dip which comes with toasted crostini bread. OMG it's scrumptious. Pesto adds to the flavoring and not too greasy or cheesy. Not a heavy appetizer like you typically find in the nasty chains with chips. We finished it with the spoon served with it. The pizza. Baked fresh right there in a wood-fired oven I believe? Had the smoked pancetta and it was so delicious. Food that when you take your first bite you black out from your conversation and have flash backs to other foodgasms?! Yeah, it was that good. Pancetta, black garlic. Ate the whole thing. Screw leftovers. Highly recommend and the bartender was awesome with beer recommendations and refills.",5.0

"Came here on a Monday night and it was already crowded by 7pm.  It feels more like a fancy craft beer house (lots of wood, tin ceiling, 1930's vibe), but they serve both amazing craft beer as well as some of the best pizza around.  We got the sopressata with extra sauce and were blown away.  Perfectly cooked crust, crunchy and very flavorful.  The cheese was light and not greasy, the sauce was abundant and spiced to perfection.  And the meat was very high quality and not overly salty like in many places.  Also, if you're feeling guilty about all the beer and pizza, they also have an amazing spinach salad.To top it all off, server was very fast and friendly, despite having a full restaurant to service.Note: cash only.",5.0

"Six of us (I'm sorry, SEVEN including a baby - this made our waitress more angry than anything I have ever done) visited Toby's at 6PM on a Sunday evening. The waitresses, from the absolute second we walked in, were so angry at our existence the food just could not be enjoyed. They discussed us loudly at the bar (and not discretely at all), rolled their eyes when we ordered individually (paid as a group, but each person ordered their own item, I am pretty sure this is normal) and continually responded to requests with ""I'll get YOUR waiter,"" when both women waited on us interchangeably. When I asked if there was maybe a piece of bread to give the baby, just to hold him over because he was hungry while the food was waiting to come out, she said ""I'll put it in the oven, it will come out in a few minutes,"" and then did not bring it until well after the food arrived. The bread she brought was two pieces of stale bread and she charged $5 for it. Overall, just rude and disgusted by us for no apparent reason.The food was fine, the beer was fine, but no the service was too rude on a dead Sunday night to even deal with it again.",2.0

"This review is 90% based off the amazing food & service, 10% based on the adorable three year old I sat next to for the beginning of the meal.My friend and I headed into Toby's on a Tuesday night with the intention of diving into an amazing pizza. All but two or three tables were full. We had the privilege of sitting next to the most well-behaved toddler with the cutest sweater & best table manners I have ever seen. He was such a sweetheart and I fell in love. He left before we got our food but I will never forget him.But I digress...The service at Toby's was super quick. Our waitress was very friendly & attentive without being overbearing. She let us take our time and understood that I was taking a little extra time to order because I was so wrapped up in conversation with my toddler friend. We ended up ordering the spinach artichoke dip, which was amazing, and the tartufata pie. Truffle cream, ham, mushrooms, leeks, mozzarella & I believe ricotta. Good god. It was unreal. After my first bite, I was already dreading what my life would be like once the pie was finished. The crust was just soft enough with the proper amount of crispness. The cheese tasted incredibly fresh. And you could put truffles on an old shoe and I'd be pretty stoked about it. I miss that pie so much. I love Toby's Public House.

"Today was my 3rd time at Tobys, and I can't understand why this place isn't packed at all times!! But I'm kind of glad it's not, living in Williamsburg I'm surrounded by mediocre food that people seem to be happy waiting more than an hour to eat. The vibe here is relaxed, waitresses are very attentive but the star here is the food. The pizza is sooooo good, spicy soppresta pie with black garlic can't be beat, and the pie with the truffle cream sauce, leeks ham and mushroom is perfection. The mushroom ravioli with truffle cream sauce might be the best I ever had, the truffle and cream not so overwhelming that you can't taste the mushroom. My father had the pappardelle with lamb Ragu and feta, he thought after the pizza he would be taking that home. Nope he ate every bite, and being Italian we know good pasta he said it was one of the best he ever had. Meat and cheese plate was on point, and the small plate of asparagus with buffalo mozz, prosciutto and balsamic glaze was by far my fave app. And I def wouldn't describe it as small!! We were also treated to a plate of buffalo muzz with basil and truffle oil which I would gladly eat every day if my cholesterol wasn't in danger of skyrocketing lol homemade key lime pie, if you have the room, is to die for. Not overly sweet and had the right amount of tartness. If your hungry and don't want to wait 2 hours to eat give this place a try. FYI best Bloody Mary I've had in a long time!!",5.0

"Searching for a good beer and pizza place in Brooklyn should not be difficult. I think there are more such establishments per capita here than anywhere else in the US, maybe the world, excepting Italy. But the search for that perfect place continues. There are certainly highlights here - the warm kale salad was large, full of fresh vegetables, tasty, and at $12, reasonable even. Unfortunately, I think the space and the pizzas are a bit of a miss. Nothing wrong with the atmosphere per se, but they have too many TVs. If you are into that, fine, but I really don't eat in places with the blue glow of whatever sports is on that night. I don't have a TV in my house, and I don't think they add to the atmosphere of a restaurant either. What is this, the Midwest?The pizzas were also a bit underwhelming and overpriced. We first ordered a pizza we thought had artichokes and spinach but turned out to have one of those mystery meats we didn't know the word in Italian for. The waitress happily replaced it, which definitely was an extra star kind of experience. But it came back and I was still disappointed. Primarily because it was sauceless. The sauceless status of this pizza was not at a all a clear from the menu, but we couldn't very well return this pizza as well. So we ate dry bread with some overlooked vegetables on it. I think that pizza without sauce is just stupid. It's not pizza according to me. The bottom line is that the menu is confusing. I'd make sure you know what you are ordering here, lest you be dissapointed as well.",3.0
"GOOD PIZZA. BAD SERVICE. CASH ONLY :( Went here once right after moving to the area. Sat down to order only to be informed that Toby's is cash only. Fortunately (for them) there's a conveniently placed ATM near the restroom. Unfortunately (for you) that means an ATM fee north of $1.50 added to your check. My guess is they own the ATM or at least get a cut of the fees. Ok fine. I used the ATM to get cash to pay for the meal (which was delicious) but having to go through the archaic and irritating process of pulling out paper fiat currency because the owners don't want to deal with credit card fees really rubbed me the wrong way. After all, this IS 2014, right? Look, I get it - credit card fees suck for restaurant owners but making customers jump through hoops in order to give you their money sucks for the customer. The food was outstanding and the service was great but I won't be going back to Toby's. I rarely carry cash and I'd rather spend my money at a place that doesn't make me jump through hoops to give them my $$$. That should tell you something considering that this place is LITERALLY less than 500 feet from where I sleep. Sorry, Toby's. Too many other options that take plastic. If you ever change that policy I'll be back. Open your mind, Quaid. The future is now.-CUPDATE: Gave Toby's another try because I happened to have cash on me at the time. My g/f and I walked in and the place was busy. There was one two-top and a few seats at the bar. The waitress that was on duty asked if we'd like to sit at the bar and we said no, we'd prefer to sit at the table. She rolled her eyes and mumbles something about how now she had to wipe it off then she walked away in a huff. Five minutes later she hadn't come back. So we left. Seriously. Bad. Service. We walked across the street to Giuseppina's and found it to be MUCH more enjoyable. The food was AMAZING. The atmosphere was warm and inviting and the service was outstanding. Skip Toby's.",1.0
"My favorite! And whenever I have visitors it's a must and becomes their favorite and a tradition. Glad that I have a lot of visitors! I pretty much keep things the same and sharing is best! Dirty Martinis made from Bam, (bartender extraordinare) a Salad, they are all delish! Mushroom Ravolis are to die for...

"This place is definitely worth checking out for some tasty craft beers, and mouth watering pizzas. Grab a buddy or a group of friends and hang outside on the wooden benches. I recommend doing the outside seating, only because inside the actual bar will sometimes feel like a sauna in mid July. The pizza is freshly made, crispy and with just the right amount of drool worthy sauce. Before coming here, I had never come across black garlic...and lorrrrd yes, it's one of the most amazing things I've ever tasted. Try this place out...you won't regret it.",4.0

"I've probably tried at this point almost every single pizza pie and at least half of the appetizers at Toby's. Thanks to my ex boyfriend. But I must say, this is one of the best pizza places in New York. It's so good that it moved from Brooklyn to Manhattan. It's traditional Italian brick-oven style thin crust yet still triangular pizza. I think that its not just the perfect crispy crust is what lends to this but the toppings are so fresh and of outstanding quality. One of the bartenders here once noted that they change their pizza menu seasonally and their specials for ingredients and produce that is fresh in season. I love that. They also have a beer mug club. I think there is an actual sign up list or waiting list for the mugs on the ceiling and it can take up to over a year to get off the list and get your name on one of those shiny white enormous mugs. First, the beer selection is always quality and changes each week. You get deals on various drafts I believe during happy hour with them and when filling up the fun mugs I think they come out to be a little bit bigger than a regular sized pint so you are definitely winning and part of the 'cool kids crowd'. I am so freaking jealous because HE has one now. On this particular voyage my friend Tony and I decided to nurse our awful hangovers with enormous amounts of pizza this past weekend. I opted to try the Fig Pizza with Gorgonzola cheese and Prosciutto. I had never had it before and couldn't see the specials board for the week because I'm blind so decided that this was a wise decision. It was both sweet and savory though and tantalizingly delicious with those pillows and pillows of prosciutto layered on top of the caramelized figs. I had never had the Merguez either and tried to lure him into getting that. It comes with lamb sausage and feta. I was intrigued. But he finally decided on getting something traditional, the Del Macellaio, sweet Italian sausage with red onions and mozzarella. He really really enjoyed it and was glorified to know that there is really great pizza out here and thus we exchanged slices. Personally, I always recommend the Smoked Pancetta. The black garlic is OUT OF THIS WORLD. The Tartufata is a little on the heavy side but interesting with its creamy black truffle sauce, white truffle oil, crimini mushroom, and parma cotta ham. Oh, and the Cipolla! I hope it still exists. I didn't see it on its menu recently. But its mozzarella, caramelized onion and gorgonzola cheese and deserves at least eight or nine exclamation points followed by an o-face. I cannot say that any of their pizzas are actually bad. I always seemingly want to have a slice of everything.For appetizers - get their mushroom ravioli. The sauce that this is immersed in is an explosion on your taste buds. The giant shrimps wrapped in pancetta with white beans and rosemary with white wine is another solid choice. If you manage to have room for desert for the love of God get the desert calzone. GET THE DESERT CALZONE. It's enormous and meant for like 4 people to share, but worth it. Stuffed with nutella and ricotta cheese and covered with powdered sugar and drizzled chocolate sauce. You will thank me later. Also, do not forget to check out the bathrooms before you leave. I'm serious. Some parents of the Slope are mildly offended because a lot of kids go here on weekends and early week nights because its pizza. But there are nudey girls from old Playboys all over the walls. I think it is tasteful and awesome. Also, if Bam the bartender is in, make sure to buy a pack or two of his BAM beef jerky! It's great and made from grass fed beef and low sodium soy sauce, coming in two different flavors of original and kill me. Kill me isn't as spicy as it may sound but really great if you are into things with a strong kick. His beef jerky was also featured on the Cooking Channel's Mo Rocca's Food(ography). I love Toby's. And you should too!",5.0
"This is going to sound stupid but they have an amazing arugula salad. My boyfriend and I stopped here while visiting some friends in Brooklyn. It has a great atmosphere, and the pizza was pretty good. At our table we ordered: 1. Fig Pizza2. Quattro Formaggio Pizza3. Margherita PizzaAll were great. The Fig pizza has fresh figs and lots of prosciutto. It actually was a little too much meat for me.

"Searching for a good beer and pizza place in Brooklyn should not be difficult. I think there are more such establishments per capita here than anywhere else in the US, maybe the world, excepting Italy. But the search for that perfect place continues. There are certainly highlights here - the warm kale salad was large, full of fresh vegetables, tasty, and at $12, reasonable even. Unfortunately, I think the space and the pizzas are a bit of a miss. Nothing wrong with the atmosphere per se, but they have too many TVs. If you are into that, fine, but I really don't eat in places with the blue glow of whatever sports is on that night. I don't have a TV in my house, and I don't think they add to the atmosphere of a restaurant either. What is this, the Midwest?The pizzas were also a bit underwhelming and overpriced. We first ordered a pizza we thought had artichokes and spinach but turned out to have one of those mystery meats we didn't know the word in Italian for. The waitress happily replaced it, which definitely was an extra star kind of experience. But it came back and I was still disappointed. Primarily because it was sauceless. The sauceless status of this pizza was not at a all a clear from the menu, but we couldn't very well return this pizza as well. So we ate dry bread with some overlooked vegetables on it. I think that pizza without sauce is just stupid. It's not pizza according to me. The bottom line is that the menu is confusing. I'd make sure you know what you are ordering here, lest you be dissapointed as well.",3.0
"GOOD PIZZA. BAD SERVICE. CASH ONLY :( Went here once right after moving to the area. Sat down to order only to be informed that Toby's is cash only. Fortunately (for them) there's a conveniently placed ATM near the restroom. Unfortunately (for you) that means an ATM fee north of $1.50 added to your check. My guess is they own the ATM or at least get a cut of the fees. Ok fine. I used the ATM to get cash to pay for the meal (which was delicious) but having to go through the archaic and irritating process of pulling out paper fiat currency because the owners don't want to deal with credit card fees really rubbed me the wrong way. After all, this IS 2014, right? Look, I get it - credit card fees suck for restaurant owners but making customers jump through hoops in order to give you their money sucks for the customer. The food was outstanding and the service was great but I won't be going back to Toby's. I rarely carry cash and I'd rather spend my money at a place that doesn't make me jump through hoops to give them my $$$. That should tell you something considering that this place is LITERALLY less than 500 feet from where I sleep. Sorry, Toby's. Too many other options that take plastic. If you ever change that policy I'll be back. Open your mind, Quaid. The future is now.-CUPDATE: Gave Toby's another try because I happened to have cash on me at the time. My g/f and I walked in and the place was busy. There was one two-top and a few seats at the bar. The waitress that was on duty asked if we'd like to sit at the bar and we said no, we'd prefer to sit at the table. She rolled her eyes and mumbles something about how now she had to wipe it off then she walked away in a huff. Five minutes later she hadn't come back. So we left. Seriously. Bad. Service. We walked across the street to Giuseppina's and found it to be MUCH more enjoyable. The food was AMAZING. The atmosphere was warm and inviting and the service was outstanding. Skip Toby's.",1.0
"My favorite! And whenever I have visitors it's a must and becomes their favorite and a tradition. Glad that I have a lot of visitors! I pretty much keep things the same and sharing is best! Dirty Martinis made from Bam, (bartender extraordinare) a Salad, they are all delish! Mushroom Ravolis are to die for... Order them as an app (and then save sauce for pizza crust dipping!) and one of their veggie pizzas- usually the Primavera. Servers are always super sweet + great. Visit enough and these lovely ladies or Bam may treat you to a round. Super small spot but worth the wait.",5.0
"This place is definitely worth checking out for some tasty craft beers, and mouth watering pizzas. Grab a buddy or a group of friends and hang outside on the wooden benches. I recommend doing the outside seating, only because inside the actual bar will sometimes feel like a sauna in mid July. The pizza is freshly made, crispy and with just the right amount of drool worthy sauce. Before coming here, I had never come across black garlic...and lorrrrd yes, it's one of the most amazing things I've ever tasted. Try this place out...you won't regret it.",4.0
Mushroom pizza with truffle oil is one of the best pizzas around! Its a small 6 slice pie. Get other things to share! Mussels are lacking in flavor and I prefer white wine sauce than red sauce mussels. Meatballs were pretty good. Key lime pie was delicious too!,4.0

"I've probably tried at this point almost every single pizza pie and at least half of the appetizers at Toby's. Thanks to my ex boyfriend. But I must say, this is one of the best pizza places in New York. It's so good that it moved from Brooklyn to Manhattan. It's traditional Italian brick-oven style thin crust yet still triangular pizza. I think that its not just the perfect crispy crust is what lends to this but the toppings are so fresh and of outstanding quality. One of the bartenders here once noted that they change their pizza menu seasonally and their specials for ingredients and produce that is fresh in season. I love that. They also have a beer mug club. I think there is an actual sign up list or waiting list for the mugs on the ceiling and it can take up to over a year to get off the list and get your name on one of those shiny white enormous mugs. First, the beer selection is always quality and changes each week. You get deals on various drafts I believe during happy hour with them and when filling up the fun mugs I think they come out to be a little bit bigger than a regular sized pint so you are definitely winning and part of the 'cool kids crowd'. I am so freaking jealous because HE has one now. On this particular voyage my friend Tony and I decided to nurse our awful hangovers with enormous amounts of pizza this past weekend. I opted to try the Fig Pizza with Gorgonzola cheese and Prosciutto. I had never had it before and couldn't see the specials board for the week because I'm blind so decided that this was a wise decision. It was both sweet and savory though and tantalizingly delicious with those pillows and pillows of prosciutto layered on top of the caramelized figs. I had never had the Merguez either and tried to lure him into getting that. It comes with lamb sausage and feta. I was intrigued. But he finally decided on getting something traditional, the Del Macellaio, sweet Italian sausage with red onions and mozzarella. He really really enjoyed it and was glorified to know that there is really great pizza out here and thus we exchanged slices. Personally, I always recommend the Smoked Pancetta. The black garlic is OUT OF THIS WORLD. The Tartufata is a little on the heavy side but interesting with its creamy black truffle sauce, white truffle oil, crimini mushroom, and parma cotta ham. Oh, and the Cipolla! I hope it still exists. I didn't see it on its menu recently. But its mozzarella, caramelized onion and gorgonzola cheese and deserves at least eight or nine exclamation points followed by an o-face. I cannot say that any of their pizzas are actually bad. I always seemingly want to have a slice of everything.For appetizers - get their mushroom ravioli. The sauce that this is immersed in is an explosion on your taste buds. The giant shrimps wrapped in pancetta with white beans and rosemary with white wine is another solid choice. If you manage to have room for desert for the love of God get the desert calzone. GET THE DESERT CALZONE. It's enormous and meant for like 4 people to share, but worth it. Stuffed with nutella and ricotta cheese and covered with powdered sugar and drizzled chocolate sauce. You will thank me later. Also, do not forget to check out the bathrooms before you leave. I'm serious. Some parents of the Slope are mildly offended because a lot of kids go here on weekends and early week nights because its pizza. But there are nudey girls from old Playboys all over the walls. I think it is tasteful and awesome. Also, if Bam the bartender is in, make sure to buy a pack or two of his BAM beef jerky! It's great and made from grass fed beef and low sodium soy sauce, coming in two different flavors of original and kill me. Kill me isn't as spicy as it may sound but really great if you are into things with a strong kick. His beef jerky was also featured on the Cooking Channel's Mo Rocca's Food(ography). I love Toby's. And you should too!",5.0
"This is going to sound stupid but they have an amazing arugula salad. My boyfriend and I stopped here while visiting some friends in Brooklyn. It has a great atmosphere, and the pizza was pretty good. At our table we ordered: 1. Fig Pizza2. Quattro Formaggio Pizza3. Margherita PizzaAll were great. The Fig pizza has fresh figs and lots of prosciutto. It actually was a little too much meat for me. The Formaggio pizza was seriously covered in cheese, and the Margherita pizza might have been my favoriteThe beer selection was great. When in Brooklyn, it's worth a stop.",4.0

"Pizza is great but the service was horrible!  I will never return to this place. The waitress was hostile, sulky and unhelpful. Slamming chairs, sighing at requests and telling us to ask the bartender is not acceptable! We were charged a 20% gratuity due to the # in our party. If it was up to me I would have given $2. The bartender was playing death metal. Soccer was on all 3 tv's but asking to turn on the volume of the game was unacceptable. The tables were dirty and sticky!! The bathroom is wallpapered with soft porn. Despite this EVERY table was a family eating pizza. They need to decide what they are: dive bar or family friendly restaurant. This ""edginess"" will not fly in Columbia waterfront location they are opening. It's too expensive for only good pizza. That neighborhood has plenty of good pizza in the hood...

"Toby's moments of brilliance are surrounded by painful experiences, and the tip of the needle seems to be leaning more in favor of the painful side of things as of late.From the disinterested bar staff to the broken front door to the sardine-like atmosphere (in terms of both toppings and logistics) -- Toby's throws a lot at you before it throws you a damn fine pizza, and damn fine pizza is what they sling. There's no denying that. But they're each around $15+, individually-sized and paid for by cash only. Even if you come here exclusively for pizza, you're going to be digging for extra sheets of your hard earned paper. And while the warm blanket of melted cheese might temporarily soften the blow, the sting of being moderately bamboozled somehow always comes back to haunt you the next day.One other thing should be said: the servers (table) here are consistently sweet and attentive.

Given that there is only 1 bathroom, both men, women, and children will be using this. So why the owner would decide to line the walls with pornography is not understandable to me. Not just one or two pictures- literally all four walls covered with it. I cannot imagine if I brought my kid there for lunch and they ended up walking into a bathroom like that.

"Came in on a Saturday night while visiting a friend in the neighborhood. We used to be roommates in the same area years back, and do I wish this place was here then. A bit surprised to find the place relatively un-packed. Most tables were full but there was seats at the bar, so we popped ourselves down there. The bartender was really friendly and inviting, went through the draft selection with us. They had a great selection of craft beers and some imports available, but we opted for pitchers of the Toby's Cheap Beer. Not sure if this was just a regularly available cheap American adjunct lager with their own name on it but it was cheap indeed and was just what we were looking for. We decided to split two pies, a Del Mac and a Sopressata. Holy crap. They came out at a perfect serving temperature from the from the brick oven. Generally I'm not the biggest fan of this style za but there's always exceptions to the rules. Crust had a nice enough char and crisp with a bit of chewiness to balance it out. Sauce to cheese ratio was spot on, with not overly sweet sauce or overly salty cheese. The meats? Perfect. We destroyed both pies and a few pitchers, and were very happy with life.Only minimal downside is it's cash only and it's not in my neighborhood. All the more reason to return though.",5.0
"I LOVE this little tavern! Situated right on a quiet street corner with little outside tables lining the edge, this is truly the best little pub in the area.It's not the biggest place, but there are plenty of long tables on the left side and a medium sized bar which could accommodate probably upwards of about 20 if it had to. Huuuuge Tv's everywhere so you're not missing anything going on sports wise. Great selection of beers of tape including Hefeweisses, Rademacher, and (of course) Brooklyn Lager. The real kicker is the little brick oven pizza at the end of the bar. I'll be honest - I didn't really expect a tavern to be putting out such good pizza, but Brooklyn never lets me down. They serve 12"" homemade pizzas with sauce that was excellent and definitely not your industrial sized food delivery can kind;  also, the quality of the mozzarella was high and it was ever-so-fresh and delicious melted over my pie topped with mesculan greens.Service is amazing and cute bartender Cris is really friendly and very attentive.

"I have given this some thought and its taken me some time to post a review because well, honestly its one of the few decent food options in this 10 block area. I have lived on and off in south slope for the last 15 years and was here well before tobys opened but remember when they did. When the hip coffee shop was a spanish hair salon, etc so I've seen the area change for the better and am a native Park Sloper born and raised. I guess my point is, to keep it short, the pizza is good but the atmosphere and staff just keep me from actually liking/enjoying this place. Ultimately, the vibe is one of screw the customer and your lucky to be eating/drinking in our establishment. I sat at the bar once eating and drinking with my girlfriend and a good portion of the time we could just hear the staff talking shit about different customers while waiting for drinks from the bartender. I have been a  waiter and bartender before so I do understand but I think its them and the lack of discretion is just not cool. Some of the staff can be nice and I see them around the hood and say hello but others can just be super lame.God forbid you add a topping to one of the pizza's - i was lectured about the region of italy where the meat was from and how it would clash if i added spinach on top and honestly its was just rude the way I was spoken to. I am a humble person, well educated and from BKLYN so I know its not me giving attitude or whatever! The long haired skinny bar tender dude on more than one occasion I've wanted to just punch in the face. He's cocky and not polite - its this arrogant defensive vibe I don't get, you don't have to be any customers bitch or welcome us with 'flare' but look, people are paying a lot of money to eat and drink at your establishment so don't be a jerk. People work hard to be able to eat out so when they do it sucks to be treated poorly. I'm not asking for you to put on fake smiles or pander to tourists, just be cool and polite that's expected in the service industry.The only reason I go here ever is because i want the pizza and dont have the time or energy to go Le Paddock or any number of pizza places in close proximity. So maybe once every couple of months I'll go here but its always the same result.

"I have been going to Toby's since they opened.  It used to be my favorite pizza place, and it definitely used to deserve five stars.  However, in the last couple of years the place has declined to the point where I had to write this review.My favorite pizza at Toby's is the Tartufata - a delicious pizza topped with truffle oil.  One day, I went to Toby's with my girl and noticed that my favorite pizza did not taste much like truffles.  I asked the waitress about it and she said they had different guys making the pizzas and they were not too consistent.  She graciously took the pizza back and added more truffle oil.The next time I went, the pizza came back drenched in some type of oil.  However, it wasn't even truffle oil and it did not taste like a Tartufata.Today was the end of Toby's for me.  I ordered a Tartufata and it again did not taste much like Truffles, but it was still good.  I had a couple of beers and an overall nice time.  My girl and I decided to take another pie home and add the truffle oil ourselves.  When we got home, we realized that the pizza they had given us was tiny (much smaller than the one we just had), and had a few no-topping, bare spots of dough I the middle of the pie.I feel so very sad to say that I will not be going back to Toby's.  Their small pizzas and high prices used to be justified by the awesome favors - that is no longer the case.  Good bye Toby's.",2.0

If you're not in a group of 4+ they tend to seat you right near the bathroom (trust me, close enough to smell).

I'm not asking for you to put on fake smiles or pander to tourists, just be cool and polite that's expected in the service industry.The only reason I go here ever is because i want the pizza and dont have the time or energy to go Le Paddock or any number of pizza places in close proximity. So maybe once every couple of months I'll go here but its always the same result. I hate to write something negative just gotta vent, I've been to Toby's maybe all together 20-30 times since they opened, and this has been my overall experience.",2.0
"When I first accidentally strolled into this place I was expecting a standard Brooklyn-style laid back pub: good beers, good food, fun people. What I didn't expect to find was some of my favorite pizza in town, ridiculously good meatballs, one of the better draught lists that's always rotating, bartender-made beef jerky, and a cheers-like vibe that has me coming back over and over. Simply put, I'm slightly glad these guys are a bit out of the way because it means the crowd is always local, the prices will stay in their reasonable range, and he good food and beer will keep flowing.",5.0

"I have been going to Toby's since they opened.  It used to be my favorite pizza place, and it definitely used to deserve five stars.  However, in the last couple of years the place has declined to the point where I had to write this review.My favorite pizza at Toby's is the Tartufata - a delicious pizza topped with truffle oil.  One day, I went to Toby's with my girl and noticed that my favorite pizza did not taste much like truffles.  I asked the waitress about it and she said they had different guys making the pizzas and they were not too consistent.  She graciously took the pizza back and added more truffle oil.The next time I went, the pizza came back drenched in some type of oil.  However, it wasn't even truffle oil and it did not taste like a Tartufata.Today was the end of Toby's for me.  I ordered a Tartufata and it again did not taste much like Truffles, but it was still good.  I had a couple of beers and an overall nice time.  My girl and I decided to take another pie home and add the truffle oil ourselves.  When we got home, we realized that the pizza they had given us was tiny (much smaller than the one we just had), and had a few no-topping, bare spots of dough I the middle of the pie.I feel so very sad to say that I will not be going back to Toby's.  Their small pizzas and high prices used to be justified by the awesome favors - that is no longer the case.  Good bye Toby's.",2.0
"Ate here on a Sunday afternoon. My friends and I ordered 3 pizzas which we split with each other. One got the special (don't remember what was on it but it had ham), I got the Merguez (lamb, cucumber, feta cheese, and tomato) and another got the Margherita. All were delicious. I felt sorry for the waitress because the place was busy and she was doing all the serving by herself but she did a great job!",5.0

"Decent place to catch a game- the TVs are huge and blaring- but more of a bar than a restaurant. Can't fathom why people bring their babies there except that most of that stretch of Brooklyn seems to have alcohol abuse issues.The real story - food portions are really small, expensive and it's cash only. If you're not in a group of 4+ they tend to seat you right near the bathroom (trust me, close enough to smell). Service is mixed; if they get to know you they'll warm up a bit, but generally they seem to prefer serving their friends.All in all, given the lack of options in the area, still best to avoid.",2.0

"It's been a while since I had really GOOD QUALITY PIZZA!!!!!!!!!!! And I gotta say, Toby's, they really know how to serve it up by flipping awesome pizza with interesting toppings. Toppings such as black garlic, smoked pancetta, and even white truffle cream, to name a few! About 12 inches big, all their pizzas are cooked in a small wood burning oven that is custom made with bricks. Their pizza was absolutely delicious and the dough, slightly salty, was stretched thin. I've already tried slices from 7 different pies and I gotta say their Smoked Pancetta ($16) and Tartufata ($18) is a most definite must! Both pies were remarkable as it was savory, intense and flavorful. With an amazing looking bar and wooden décor, this restaurant is humming with coziness and a sense of neighborhood unity! My only qualm is that this restaurant is small and seems like it can only seat about 20-25 people. If you come here, come early, if not then expect to wait.

In the back of Toby's is a nearly perfect example of this kind of set up, and hence, this kind of pizza. For purposes of this review I'll say it's perfect, because I've eaten at many celebrated pizza joints over the last decade, and it's been a while since I've had pizza this good. Years, I'd say.

"Toby's Public House, with its beautiful brick exterior, appears much larger than it is. Inside, however, there is a long bar to the right, and room for the exposed oven in the back, with the remaining square footage dedicated to a handful of tables. It seems that people come here for any combination of the following three things: pizza, beer, and sports. On my first trip to Toby's Public House, I tackled 'em all.Let's start with the food - we ordered two pizzas: the Fig (with mozzarella, gorgonzola dolce DOP, rosemary, prosciutto di Parma) and the Spicy Pecorino (with arugula pesto, mozzarella, cherry tomato). And yes, they taste as delicious as they sound. Less grease, more cheese, and all flavor, these skinny, little guys are sure to please even the most skeptical pizza critic.  If you're hungry, you can take down the pie all your own, which is split into roughly six personal-sized slices. If not - hey, there are always leftovers. The cheap-ass inside me almost wishes they weren't so tasty, because, truth be told, they are a bit on the expensive side, and unfortunately for my wallet, I think I've found a new spot in Toby's.Anyway, on the waitress' suggestion, I had an Avery Karma, a draft previously unfamiliar to me hailing from Boulder, Colorado, that was the perfect compliment to pipin'-hot, wood-fired pizza. I believe it is technically a Belgian-style pale ale, however, I'm sure the brewer had a tough time putting this one in a genre as it pours much darker than it tastes. Regardless, it was an awesome beer, with or without the pizza.Lastly, in alignment with its namesake, Toby's Public House also positions itself as your standard neighborhood bar, with whatever New York sports teams are playing at the time on the TVs. I could be wrong, but given they had both Yankees and Mets games on when I was there, it doesn't appear as if Toby's picked sides. Not that there's anything wrong with that - what's important is that Toby is a tried-and-true New Yorker, regardless of cross-town affiliation - and, sometimes, that's the only side that matters.",4.0

"This has suddenly become one of my favorite places in BK to go for a drink,  grab a pizza, AND score some amazing beef jerky.  That's right: beef jerky. Various flavors- and they're all amazing!I love the smoked pancetta pizza with the black garlic, and the soppresata pie's great too.   I hear the desserts are killer but I end being so full from the multiple pints of frothy brew and the sack o jerky that precede my piegasm that I'm going to have to make a special trip to try one.The beer drinkers club is cool too. Not sure how to join, but I dig it!",5.0
"I want to love this place ... heck, I even joined the beer club here for the ability to have my own personalized mug hanging on the ceiling offering me discounted drinks during happy hour and a free t-shirt.I want to love it's quaint space, with tables down the left and bar taking up at least a 1/3 of the room , wood walls and exposed brick everywhere. I want to love the outdoor seating with the extra half-seats on the end of tables to make it easy for people to hang out.I want to love their tv's hung on the wall, almost always tuned into the local NY sports of the night, and to love their tasty pizza and constantly changing beer list.I really, really want to love this place, but if you're a 15-20 minute walk from my house, you can't be cash only ($6 for beers + $15 for pizza means I almost always have to go to the ATM in order to eat here), you have to not tell me it's impossible to have my computer on the bar (explain to me again how it's a safety concern), and you have to not tell me I can't use your private wifi network when unexpected work means I need to take care of something immediately and then tell me 'Hey, it's just not your night'.This place is always crowded, so they probably wouldn't miss me much if I don't come very often, and that makes me sad. Because I really do want to love this place.",3.0
"Originally started this review back in August (8/6).  So what, I'm behind, finally catching up.  Sunday night before the rain, the wife and I grabbed two seats at the overly crowded bar and restaurant.  The space is tight in the restaurant but managed well and can get a little warm in the summer months due to the brick oven. But that brick oven is why you should go to this place.  The kitchen turns out some fine pizza.  We split the basic MARGHERITA pizza which left us only wanting more.  They have a decent selection of draft beers as well as those who prefer bottles.  Will definitely be back!  Even with other pizzerias near by, this should be your stop of choice.  And you Manhattanites who don't want to come out here, there's now one on Mulberry street for you.  Brooklyn location is CASH ONLY",4.0
"A gem on an unsuspecting corner in Sunset Park. I watched the Euro Cup here a few weeks ago and Toby's Public House provided a great environment and delicious food/drink. Their brick oven pizzas are all homemade, the ingredients are fresh and spectacular! The beer selection (on tap and bottled) is also great.We tried the funghi pizza with the black garlic - yum! And the fig and gorgonzola pizza- also delish. (They were nice enough to do half with out prosciutto for me since I'm a vegetarian). All in all a chill spot to watch the game, kick back a few and hang out with friends!",4.0
"Nice beer selection, good ambiance, excellent beef jerky for sale (made by Bam himself), and delicious food.This place is a gem for a great pizza. They use local, artisanal, and quality Italian ingredients: buffalo mozzarella, parmigiano, etc. Salads are top notch (the ""chopped"" was a fun mix of chickpeas, lettuce, shaved ricotta salata, fennel, and more) and so is the antipasti. Asparagus with truffle oil, buffalo mozz, and prosciutto is a fantastic side. My friend B swears by the Nutella and sweet ricotta calzone, although I have never had it.It is a true neighborhood bar with awesome laid-back staff and local clientele. Aside from the drunken idiot Devils ""fan"" (sorry, that hat was way too new for us to think you were a fan before last week) who tried to fight my friend for no reason, everyone has always been super friendly and hospitable. Cash only, which blows because I can't just come here and spend $10... and neither will you, given the awesome menu and solid beer selection.",4.0
"I've only been here three times since moving to the neighborhood and every time I've had a good experience. The first 2 times was with my husband. We both had pizza and it was very yummy! The service was great both times despite the place being packed and very loud.The third time I came I feel is worth a detailed mention, mainly due to the fact that we brought a 6 month old baby with us. I know a lot of reviews have mentioned their poor treatment due to the fact that they brought in their children in, we didn't have such treatment. My father, brother, sister -in- law, and their two kids were in town visiting. Since we had a 12 year old and a 6 month old with us, my husband and I were initially going to take them to Giuseppina's. We walked all the way there and found out that it was closed. Since it was raining out we didn't want to walk far, so the next closest pizza place was Toby's. I decided to call ahead and ask if they'd have room for the 6 1/2 of us and if they'd mind us bringing the kids in. The bartender told me right away that they do not except strollers and had no high hairs or booster seats. I explained that we did not have a stroller and that the baby would just sit on our lap, there is no need for a high chair or booster. He said to go ahead and come in that the place was empty. There was no attitude detected from him when we talked.. We arrived and were seated immediately, the place was empty since it was mid afternoon. The server was super nice and didn't seem bothered at all by the baby. We ordered 5 pizzas for the 6 of us and all if them were very good, the group favorite was the tartufata. I should also mention that the tiramisu is amazing, it puzzles me how a previous reviewer said it wasn't very good! So overall I give Toby's a thumbs up so far. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because I do not agree with their posting a $15 minimum per person to sit at tables. My family has owned and operated restaurants for over 30 years and there is far more tactful ways to get across to patrons that the tables are for dining only. I am also on the fence about the cash only policy. Due to their price points, its very hard if not impossible for 2 people dining in to spend less then $100 if you plan having a full dining experience by ordering an app, pizzas, desert, and drinks, yet the ATM only dispenses a max of $120.As far as people posting that they are rude to patrons with kids, I have to wonder why they would even want to bring kids to a place like Toby's. In my mind, Toby's is more of a sports bar then an actual restaurant. Any bar is not really a place to take your kids. We only did it because of our circumstances at the time, but if it was anytime after 4pm and we had other options then there's no way I would've taken kids there.",4.0
"I like this place. It seems to have a lot of regulars. The service was extremely friendly.  The pizza was good (although I wished I ordered the ""special"" pizza that everyone sitting around us ordered as it looked better than ours). Not a lot of wines by glass - its more of a beer place.",4.0
"Toby's Public House, with its beautiful brick exterior, appears much larger than it is. Inside, however, there is a long bar to the right, and room for the exposed oven in the back, with the remaining square footage dedicated to a handful of tables. It seems that people come here for any combination of the following three things: pizza, beer, and sports. On my first trip to Toby's Public House, I tackled 'em all.Let's start with the food - we ordered two pizzas: the Fig (with mozzarella, gorgonzola dolce DOP, rosemary, prosciutto di Parma) and the Spicy Pecorino (with arugula pesto, mozzarella, cherry tomato). And yes, they taste as delicious as they sound. Less grease, more cheese, and all flavor, these skinny, little guys are sure to please even the most skeptical pizza critic.  If you're hungry, you can take down the pie all your own, which is split into roughly six personal-sized slices. If not - hey, there are always leftovers. The cheap-ass inside me almost wishes they weren't so tasty, because, truth be told, they are a bit on the expensive side, and unfortunately for my wallet, I think I've found a new spot in Toby's.Anyway, on the waitress' suggestion, I had an Avery Karma, a draft previously unfamiliar to me hailing from Boulder, Colorado, that was the perfect compliment to pipin'-hot, wood-fired pizza. I believe it is technically a Belgian-style pale ale, however, I'm sure the brewer had a tough time putting this one in a genre as it pours much darker than it tastes. Regardless, it was an awesome beer, with or without the pizza.Lastly, in alignment with its namesake, Toby's Public House also positions itself as your standard neighborhood bar, with whatever New York sports teams are playing at the time on the TVs. I could be wrong, but given they had both Yankees and Mets games on when I was there, it doesn't appear as if Toby's picked sides. Not that there's anything wrong with that - what's important is that Toby is a tried-and-true New Yorker, regardless of cross-town affiliation - and, sometimes, that's the only side that matters.",4.0
Really good food and beer!  Me and a buddy stopped by before a show and the owner was great! Will definitely stop by again!,4.0
Nice spot for gourmet pizza and good beer. I will definitely be going back. Downside is Cash only and happy hour is only at the bar.,4.0
"This has suddenly become one of my favorite places in BK to go for a drink,  grab a pizza, AND score some amazing beef jerky.  That's right: beef jerky. Various flavors- and they're all amazing!I love the smoked pancetta pizza with the black garlic, and the soppresata pie's great too.   I hear the desserts are killer but I end being so full from the multiple pints of frothy brew and the sack o jerky that precede my piegasm that I'm going to have to make a special trip to try one.The beer drinkers club is cool too. Not sure how to join, but I dig it!",5.0
"I want to love this place ... heck, I even joined the beer club here for the ability to have my own personalized mug hanging on the ceiling offering me discounted drinks during happy hour and a free t-shirt.I want to love it's quaint space, with tables down the left and bar taking up at least a 1/3 of the room , wood walls and exposed brick everywhere. I want to love the outdoor seating with the extra half-seats on the end of tables to make it easy for people to hang out.I want to love their tv's hung on the wall, almost always tuned into the local NY sports of the night, and to love their tasty pizza and constantly changing beer list.I really, really want to love this place, but if you're a 15-20 minute walk from my house, you can't be cash only ($6 for beers + $15 for pizza means I almost always have to go to the ATM in order to eat here), you have to not tell me it's impossible to have my computer on the bar (explain to me again how it's a safety concern), and you have to not tell me I can't use your private wifi network when unexpected work means I need to take care of something immediately and then tell me 'Hey, it's just not your night'.This place is always crowded, so they probably wouldn't miss me much if I don't come very often, and that makes me sad. Because I really do want to love this place.",3.0
"Originally started this review back in August (8/6).  So what, I'm behind, finally catching up.  Sunday night before the rain, the wife and I grabbed two seats at the overly crowded bar and restaurant.  The space is tight in the restaurant but managed well and can get a little warm in the summer months due to the brick oven. But that brick oven is why you should go to this place.  The kitchen turns out some fine pizza.  We split the basic MARGHERITA pizza which left us only wanting more.  They have a decent selection of draft beers as well as those who prefer bottles.  Will definitely be back!  Even with other pizzerias near by, this should be your stop of choice.  And you Manhattanites who don't want to come out here, there's now one on Mulberry street for you.  Brooklyn location is CASH ONLY",4.0
"A gem on an unsuspecting corner in Sunset Park. I watched the Euro Cup here a few weeks ago and Toby's Public House provided a great environment and delicious food/drink. Their brick oven pizzas are all homemade, the ingredients are fresh and spectacular! The beer selection (on tap and bottled) is also great.We tried the funghi pizza with the black garlic - yum! And the fig and gorgonzola pizza- also delish. (They were nice enough to do half with out prosciutto for me since I'm a vegetarian). All in all a chill spot to watch the game, kick back a few and hang out with friends!",4.0
"Nice beer selection, good ambiance, excellent beef jerky for sale (made by Bam himself), and delicious food.This place is a gem for a great pizza. They use local, artisanal, and quality Italian ingredients: buffalo mozzarella, parmigiano, etc. Salads are top notch (the ""chopped"" was a fun mix of chickpeas, lettuce, shaved ricotta salata, fennel, and more) and so is the antipasti. Asparagus with truffle oil, buffalo mozz, and prosciutto is a fantastic side. My friend B swears by the Nutella and sweet ricotta calzone, although I have never had it.It is a true neighborhood bar with awesome laid-back staff and local clientele. Aside from the drunken idiot Devils ""fan"" (sorry, that hat was way too new for us to think you were a fan before last week) who tried to fight my friend for no reason, everyone has always been super friendly and hospitable. Cash only, which blows because I can't just come here and spend $10... and neither will you, given the awesome menu and solid beer selection.",4.0
"I've only been here three times since moving to the neighborhood and every time I've had a good experience. The first 2 times was with my husband. We both had pizza and it was very yummy! The service was great both times despite the place being packed and very loud.The third time I came I feel is worth a detailed mention, mainly due to the fact that we brought a 6 month old baby with us. I know a lot of reviews have mentioned their poor treatment due to the fact that they brought in their children in, we didn't have such treatment. My father, brother, sister -in- law, and their two kids were in town visiting. Since we had a 12 year old and a 6 month old with us, my husband and I were initially going to take them to Giuseppina's. We walked all the way there and found out that it was closed. Since it was raining out we didn't want to walk far, so the next closest pizza place was Toby's. I decided to call ahead and ask if they'd have room for the 6 1/2 of us and if they'd mind us bringing the kids in.

"Sometimes you really fall in love with a place, and cherish the evening you spent there with a bit of nostalgia that is quite difficult to explain.Sometimes this place is really fancy and striking, and you experience something so totally out of the ordinary that night that you will remember it forever.Sometimes this place is just really down to earth and comfortable, and gives you the best it can.Toby's is this kind of place.It's almost easy to miss at night walking down on 6th avenue when you don't know the neighborhood. But once you are in there, you don't want to leave. It's at least how I felt that night, cozy at the bar, attended to by Bam, one of the best barmen I had in a while. He doesn't look like Emeril, not even remotely. He knows how to pour a mean Italian wine, and give suggestions to indecisive customers like us who wanted to try everything on the menu but were not feeling quite hungry enough to do so. We shied away from the salads - which all looked and sounded amazing - and skipped appetizers (clearly, a mistake; check out their menu and drool with me...most of them are prepared in small ramekins and placed in the wood-burning oven. Shrimp wrapped in smoked pancetta, white beans, garlic, rosemary, smoked paprika and white wine. Cauliflower with  pecorino toscano, truffle oil, breadcrumbs and capers. You know what I mean?) to focus on pizzas.And oh man.What a delightful idea.I don't know what did it that night. First night in NYC in seven years - and the first one with my man; a warm, comfortable place with mugs hanging from the wooded ceiling, and where regulars are chatting while loudly supporting their team on TV; a perfect alignment of the stars; or the nice, comforting heat radiating from the brick oven manned by a Sicilian wonder. But I felt unmitigated happiness. The pizzas had a lot to do with it as well.We started with the Cipolla where mozzarella, caramelized onion and gorgonzola were engaged in the most savory of dances with prosciutto di parma on a very nice crust, perfectly charred on the edges but still wet in the middle - just the way I love it. We devoured it. And went back to the menu.This time, I decided on smoked pancetta, accompanied by tomato, mozzarella, crimini and black garlic. If you are unsure about this guy, fear no more. Black garlic is the perfect mix of molasses-like richness and tangy garlic undertones. It has a tender, almost jelly-like texture with a melt-in-your-mouth consistency similar to a soft dried fruit. It's heaven. And genius on a pizza.When we finally left, exhausted after a day of traveling and intense city walking, I felt like home. I was also shrouded in sadness because I knew that I wouldn't be back before a long time. The magic happened just like that. And really, you should experience it as well.",5.0

"Okay, Toby's, so you really don't need my yelp, but here it is anyway.  I remember eating a pizza with burnt crust  while sweating in the heat of the brick oven shortly after they opened, but that was my only negative experience.  The pizzas are vastly improved and while on the pricey side, the ingredients are top notch.  Also, the ventilation is much improved.  The dessert calzone is so good it will haunt your dreams- filled with oozing ricotta and nutella!  Bring friends and save room if you plan on ordering it, because it's too good for two people to finish in one sitting.  Yet there is one drawback to Toby's- its size and the crowd it draws during sporting events.  Yes, that's how they make money, but I hope they make enough so that they can expand to have a room separate from the bar area, which gets pretty packed when a Yanks game is on.  In nice weather, there are a few cute tables outside which are lovely if you can score one.  Have to admit, the combo of sports bar and high-end brick oven pizza is a little weird, but seeing as how the neighborhood had neither before it opened, you'll find it evenly divided between families and dudes in jerseys.  Heads up though- it's still cash only.",4.0

"Okay, Toby's, so you really don't need my yelp, but here it is anyway.  I remember eating a pizza with burnt crust  while sweating in the heat of the brick oven shortly after they opened, but that was my only negative experience.  The pizzas are vastly improved and while on the pricey side, the ingredients are top notch.  Also, the ventilation is much improved.  The dessert calzone is so good it will haunt your dreams- filled with oozing ricotta and nutella!  Bring friends and save room if you plan on ordering it, because it's too good for two people to finish in one sitting.  Yet there is one drawback to Toby's- its size and the crowd it draws during sporting events.  Yes, that's how they make money, but I hope they make enough so that they can expand to have a room separate from the bar area, which gets pretty packed when a Yanks game is on.  In nice weather, there are a few cute tables outside which are lovely if you can score one.  Have to admit, the combo of sports bar and high-end brick oven pizza is a little weird, but seeing as how the neighborhood had neither before it opened, you'll find it evenly divided between families and dudes in jerseys.  Heads up though- it's still cash only.",4.0
Pizza is better than the fancy place across the street.  Bartenders are highly knowledgeable.  And they make the best caramelized onions in the world.  Which is random for a bar.  And they don't hustle you ot.,5.0

"My FAVORITE place!!! It helps I love 2 blocks and consider it ""my local."" Toby's has the best pizza there is. GO! You will not regret it. The awesome staff always takes care of you. ANY friend visiting Brooklyn has to experience this place. Our go-to's are the Mushroom Ravioli, Spinach Pizza, and Tartufata Pizza. Dip you crust in the ravioli sauce! Love Love Love Toby's, and if you're in to sports, they've always got the game on you want to see.",5.0
"Toby's is a place that lives up to its Yelp reputation!  It is a restaurant with a nice local feel.  A long bar on the right, tables and chairs on the left, and the guys making and baking the pizzas in the wood burning oven in the back. I personally loved that they had basketball, soccer and the news on the large screens and decent background music that did not preclude listening in to the conversations at the tables adjacent to ours!But alas we came to eat!  We began with a very fresh Arugula salad and followed with an excellent buffalo mozzarella pizza with a superior thin but tasty crust, fresh tomato sauce and a generous portion of cheese.   We only had water to drink but our server brought us a bottle to be sure we had enough and we did not have to ask for extra cheese and hot peppers because they were delivered with the pizza..I do wish that restaurants who do not take credit cards would post so on the door, but otherwise it was a great first visit to Toby's and I am sure it will not be our last!",4.0
"Growing up in DUMBO, I was a huge Grimaladi's pizza fan so, when I moved to South Slope, I was sad to not have a delicious pizza place close by... and then I found Toby's! Their pizza's with truffle oil are absolutely delicious and I take anyone who comes to visit here now.",5.0
"I like to consider Toby's a hidden gem, only because a lot of people haven't seem to have heard of it when I ask.

I would especially recommend the Tartufata and Smoked Pancetta. Don't forget to save room for the Nutella calzone, though it does have a bit more ricotta than I'd like. Toby's also has a very nice selection of beer.Staff is always super friendly.

Many incorporate imported Italian meats and local vegetables, and the owners cycle through a number of interesting specials. The beer selection is pretty good, with about a dozen mostly German beers on top at standard Brooklyn prices. The best deal is probably the antipasta, which is massive and can be used to lower the number of pizzas required by the table. It's about five times the size of Lot 2's across the street and about the same price.My only complaints are layout related: it's too small and too loud when games are shown.

"I live in the neighborhood, born and raised. So I was kind of excited to see Toby's Public House spring up and hence my boyfriend brought me there for some dessert tonight. He ordered a gin & tonic and Iordered the gelato and nutella dessert and asked for a side of hot chocolate. Well! The waitress snapped the biggest attitude she could find as she replied ""we don't do that around here! sweety, it's 85 degrees outside and you want a hot chocolate!?"" I felt humiliated. The dessert ended up being pretty good & my boyfriend was satisfied with his gin & tonic (I ended up ordering a pino grigio). When the bill came, not only was I astounded at the price point, but it was then that we found out it was cash only. WTF? With those prices your telling me they can't accept credit cards. OK. My beau goes inside to hit up the ATM but it doesn't dispense the much needed cash we're strapped over. The bartender replies ""Oh, yeah that's only happened a few times in the past"". Oh really? Then get a new ATM machine or start accepting credit cards. Furthermore, upon his ATM ""withdrawal"" withdrew the money from his checking account. TWICE! Without ever dispensing any cash. SO we had to drive to WAMU and drive back to pay them for their tasty dessert but HORRIBLE wait service. I'll still go back to try the pizza, but if I see this waitress there, I am turning right back around and coming back another night.",1.0

"This place is fucking cool! Dark wood everywhere, tiled ceiling, craft beer, outdoor seating, and a red brick wood fired pizza oven. My kind of place. Server and bartender were a bit hipstery, but I never hold that against anyone as long as they're friendly and competent. I was early for dinner, so I grabbed a Stoudt's Lager (good) and ordered what I had planned on ordering. I got the smoked pancetta pie, which also had fresh mozzarella, sauce, porcini mushrooms, and the real reason I got this: black garlic. This is something I haven't seen used on a pizza before, and its superb. It tastes sort of like roasted garlic that's been soaked in balsamic vinegar. They used it sparingly here as its a very strong flavor, but I almost wish there was more. The crust here is a great example of the NY-Naples hybrid style: well fermented, crisp, airy end crust with a soft, wet under crust. The smoked pancetta I should've mentioned already, as they weren't stingy at all; it was absolutely covering the pie. It could've been a little more reservedly applied and crisped up a bit more, but this was high quality stuff. The porcini mushrooms added a bit of meatiness, the fresh mozzarella a nice milkiness, and the tomato sauce added nothing. It didn't have much flavor to begin with, and was completely overshadowed by the quality of the other ingredients. The pie could've even done without it altogether, as it already had enough flavors contending for the spotlight. Tomato sauce aside, this pizza had flavor to spare and more than enough going for it. If it was constructed a bit more carefully, we'd be talking best-in-city. This place is expensive (my pie was $17) but worth it. My pizza was ~12"" too, so you do get a bit of quantity to go with your quality. Hopefully this Toby's gets more press, as it definitely deserves it. That a place like this in a well internet-literate area could go under the radar is a testament to 2 things: how much hype figures into restaurants getting coverage rather than merit, and how fucking great Brooklyn pizza is.",4.0

"Rule number 1 when making Margherita pies: You don't bake the damned basil with the pizza, you put it on after the pizza is baked. Isn't this a no-brainer?????? I guess not at Toby's. The salads are amazing though, which sort of saves the experience here. Their beer list is good to considering the area. Their other pies are tasty too, but it just annoys the hell out of me that they destroy that beautiful basil!!",2.0
Great place to meet friends. Lots of yummy-smelling pizzas that I can't eat b/c I have a wheat allergy. I wish they had a *gluten-free crust* option b/c there only a few salad options. My husband said the pizza he had was tasty.,3.0
"Their house salad was as amazing as house salad can be - a giant portion for $8, perfectly dressed, cherry tomatoes sliced in half (YES!) and DELICIOUS for November, and love me some fresh parmigiano reggiano.My boyfriend and I ordered two pies, and slightly regretted it afterwards, because we thought one would not be enough.  We ordered the margherita - good, not mindblowing; boyfriend said he wished it had a 'little something more.' And we ordered the special pizza of the night - spicy pecorino, caramelized onions,  and prosciutto.  The special was Amazing.  It was a perfect combination of salty (prosciutto), sweet (the onions... oh my god yes) and spicy (the cheese); I just wish it had a little less cheese.  The cheese was so heavy compared to the amount on the margherita, and I think it really hindered us from conquering the two pies.  Crowd seemed to be a typical mix of BK neighborhoodies, but they could give a shit about you, so don't worry.  It's tucked away enough where it's not one of those places that makes you feel awkward as hell for coming in.  There are a surprising amount of tv's up in the tiny bar (four) all of them showing ESPN, which made me gag a little.More caramelized onion pizza please.",4.0
Was passing through ny for work and was directed by the locals here. Had about 8 craft brews on tap. Smoked Panchetta pizza was delicious. Black garlic was slightly sweet and accompanied the sauce well.I enjoyed the Sly fox O'Reilly Stout. Sweet malts and creamyness finished with a gentle hop bite,5.0
"Perhaps the best pizza I've had in NYC. Forget the trendy spots like Giuseppina's and Lucali. This is a *bar* first and foremost, with TVs and a great beer selection, which also happens to have a brick oven. Plus a bar tender that bears a striking resemblance to Anthony Kiedis circa 1990 who also makes his own beef jerky, which is fantastic.A word to the wise--get there early if you don't want to wait, and if you see any pizza that features black garlic and/or truffle oil, put down the menu and order it immediately. Trust me on this one.",5.0
"I am going to miss exactly two things about Brooklyn. First. the people at Toby's public house. The most surprisingly warm and genuine people I could have imagined meeting.

I highly recommend the asparagus antipasti, which is served with buffalo mozzarella and prosciutto and drizzled with truffle oil and a balsamic reduction. It's very small and seating is extremely limited, so go early or plan to wait a bit. It's cash-only, but there is an ATM by the washroom. Recommended!",5.0
"Rule number 1 when making Margherita pies: You don't bake the damned basil with the pizza, you put it on after the pizza is baked. Isn't this a no-brainer?????? I guess not at Toby's. The salads are amazing though, which sort of saves the experience here. Their beer list is good to considering the area. Their other pies are tasty too, but it just annoys the hell out of me that they destroy that beautiful basil!!",2.0
Great place to meet friends. Lots of yummy-smelling pizzas that I can't eat b/c I have a wheat allergy. I wish they had a *gluten-free crust* option b/c there only a few salad options. My husband said the pizza he had was tasty.,3.0
"Their house salad was as amazing as house salad can be - a giant portion for $8, perfectly dressed, cherry tomatoes sliced in half (YES!) and DELICIOUS for November, and love me some fresh parmigiano reggiano.My boyfriend and I ordered two pies, and slightly regretted it afterwards, because we thought one would not be enough.  We ordered the margherita - good, not mindblowing; boyfriend said he wished it had a 'little something more.' And we ordered the special pizza of the night - spicy pecorino, caramelized onions,  and prosciutto.  The special was Amazing.  It was a perfect combination of salty (prosciutto), sweet (the onions... oh my god yes) and spicy (the cheese); I just wish it had a little less cheese.  The cheese was so heavy compared to the amount on the margherita, and I think it really hindered us from conquering the two pies.  Crowd seemed to be a typical mix of BK neighborhoodies, but they could give a shit about you, so don't worry.  It's tucked away enough where it's not one of those places that makes you feel awkward as hell for coming in.  There are a surprising amount of tv's up in the tiny bar (four) all of them showing ESPN, which made me gag a little.More caramelized onion pizza please.",4.0
Was passing through ny for work and was directed by the locals here. Had about 8 craft brews on tap. Smoked Panchetta pizza was delicious. Black garlic was slightly sweet and accompanied the sauce well.I enjoyed the Sly fox O'Reilly Stout. Sweet malts and creamyness finished with a gentle hop bite,5.0
"Perhaps the best pizza I've had in NYC. Forget the trendy spots like Giuseppina's and Lucali. This is a *bar* first and foremost, with TVs and a great beer selection, which also happens to have a brick oven. Plus a bar tender that bears a striking resemblance to Anthony Kiedis circa 1990 who also makes his own beef jerky, which is fantastic.A word to the wise--get there early if you don't want to wait, and if you see any pizza that features black garlic and/or truffle oil, put down the menu and order it immediately. Trust me on this one.",5.0
"I am going to miss exactly two things about Brooklyn. First. the people at Toby's public house. The most surprisingly warm and genuine people I could have imagined meeting.

"When you put your average bar and brick oven pizzeria together, you get Toby's Public House, located in Brooklyn's Park Slope.

Although it's not an eyesore, it's nothing we haven't seen before.As far as the wine goes, it's served to you in a highball glass, and that was a first for me.

"A gem in the rough.  The space is a bit small, but that also adds to it's charm.  The brick facade and interior is really nice, it's dimly lit, a talkative bar area, a brick fire oven, and all-wood tables add to the atmosphere.  Toby's is nestled in a corner of 6th Avenue and 21st Street--with not much in the way of restaurants or anything fancy going on.  In fact if you keep walking toward 21st, the nice residential area really starts turning a bit industrial.  Definitely a joint that looks like it belongs in Park Slope instead of South Park Slope. They have great thin crust pizza, but the tips of slices may get soggy after a while.  They have gourmet toppings like black truffle oil, buffalo mozzarella, arugula, crimini mushrooms, etc.  Overall, it was a really good pizza experience.  I didn't feel weighed down after three slices like I do with cheap oily pizza.  Definitely one of the best pizza options in the (South) Park Slope.  The best option if you want a cool place to bring your friends for pizza and drinks, but don't want to travel too far.",4.0

"While I have yet to sample the allegedly delicious pizza here, I did enjoy the cheap beer, and that said cheap beer was named after the establishment.

Now, whatever you do, do not sample the jerky. Even if there's a 2 for $5 special like when we went here. It is ridiculously thin, dry, flavorless, and worst of all, disappointing. When I see ""Dr. Pepper Jerky"" and ""Root Beer Jerky"" my imagination conjurs up a wedding of beef and soda followed by the raunchiest honeymoon sex ever, all occurring in my mouth.

"A gem in the rough.  The space is a bit small, but that also adds to it's charm.  The brick facade and interior is really nice, it's dimly lit, a talkative bar area, a brick fire oven, and all-wood tables add to the atmosphere.  Toby's is nestled in a corner of 6th Avenue and 21st Street--with not much in the way of restaurants or anything fancy going on.  In fact if you keep walking toward 21st, the nice residential area really starts turning a bit industrial.  Definitely a joint that looks like it belongs in Park Slope instead of South Park Slope. They have great thin crust pizza, but the tips of slices may get soggy after a while.  They have gourmet toppings like black truffle oil, buffalo mozzarella, arugula, crimini mushrooms, etc.  Overall, it was a really good pizza experience.  I didn't feel weighed down after three slices like I do with cheap oily pizza.  Definitely one of the best pizza options in the (South) Park Slope.  The best option if you want a cool place to bring your friends for pizza and drinks, but don't want to travel too far.",4.0
"Three words: Smoked Pancetta Pizza.Thin crust, so flavorful and crisp, topped with a delicate tomato sauce and fresh mozzarella topped with thin strips of smokey pancetta, its light saltiness balanced beautifully with the sweetness of the sauce and--OMG--black garlic.... little black morsels of sweet deliciousness.if you live in the Slope, are visiting the Slope, or just want to scarf down some out of this world gourmet pizza, I *highly* recommend Toby's!",5.0
"Is this Sunset Park? I don't think so but regardless, we came here last night and to my surprise the place was packed throughout the night.  Non-stop customers, and non stop pizzas coming out of the brick oven.  The reason to come here is because you want brick oven pizza, and you don't want to have to go far.  The pizza is definitely great.  We got the Quattro Stagioni and the sausage pizza special that day.  A pie averages to about $15 and is super good.  The servers are very attentive, and while normally, I don't like places that have so many TVs, this place was fine.  We sat at the bar until we a table opened up outside.  All in all, a great experience. I would come here again to sit outside and eat some za.",4.0
"While I have yet to sample the allegedly delicious pizza here, I did enjoy the cheap beer, and that said cheap beer was named after the establishment. I also enjoyed its proximity to my friend Giac's apartment, as it means future pizza and beer can be had with a minimal amount of stumbling around afterwards. Now, whatever you do, do not sample the jerky. Even if there's a 2 for $5 special like when we went here. It is ridiculously thin, dry, flavorless, and worst of all, disappointing. When I see ""Dr. Pepper Jerky"" and ""Root Beer Jerky"" my imagination conjurs up a wedding of beef and soda followed by the raunchiest honeymoon sex ever, all occurring in my mouth. Instead, this jerky was the equivalent of a shotgun wedding followed by the birth of a child that's clearly not yours.",3.0

And then, oh and then - dessert!  We had two nutella ricotta calzones, and then some surprise extra desserts due to the whole birthday thing.

"My boyfriends been living in Toby's hood for about 6 months and being a brick-oven pizza lover, Toby's is a major reason I pushed for him to get the apartment.  We'd stopped for a beer after a long summer bike ride back in August, and finally just went for dinner.  It's a great neighborhood staple pizza place/bar/hangout.  The crust was the prodigal son of Crispy and Crunchy, the sauce an immaculate lovechild between Sweet and Salty.  The service was nice, and our waitress was super attentive.  Too attentive, maybe, since the sneak attack came as she eagerly refilled our sodas any time they got empty, only to find out later that we'd be charged for refills.  I'm sorry, but $12 for two people to drink SELTZER?  That's sneaky, Toby's.  That's a pet peeve of mine.I digress.  I'll be eating Toby's again, perhaps ordering out and drinking my own $2.50 two-liter of seltzer in the apartment.  I'm also looking forward to experiencing the nutella calzone in all of it's glory sometime soon.",4.0
"This place has good and bad points:Good: no strollers,OK beer selection, bar tenders are not bad, good food, nice interior and it's clean.Bad: thy let kids in, way over priced food, WAY to BIG TV's ( there is no place in here that you are not confronted by one)I may stop in for a beer if I am in the area but not going out of my way for this place.",2.0
"Came here for my sister's birthday dinner last night, and it was pretty awesome. We called ahead and let them know there would be ten of us, and we were seated immediately (which ended up being more of a timing thing, but still, great) and were given wine and beer, things that I thoroughly enjoy.For my food, I had the manicotti, which was completely wonderful - and served to me straight out the oven, the sauce was still bubbling! I also sampled the pizza, which was great - crispy crust, delicious sauce, and some quality prosciutto. I approve, wholeheartedly. And then, oh and then - dessert!  We had two nutella ricotta calzones, and then some surprise extra desserts due to the whole birthday thing. I don't know what it was, but there was chocolate, and it was a little crispy, and it might have been the greatest thing in the entire world.Anyway, they took very, very good care of us. It was an excellent experience, and I will return.",4.0

I also love the fact that this seemed to be a neighboorhood spot.  I don't know if I'd go back though - while the pizza and calzone were delicious, I'd probably want to try out other pizza places before going to this one again.CASH ONLY!",4.0

"The owner of our neighborhood hardware store overheard me and my girlfriend discussing pizza and strongly recommended this place. A few months later on an unseasonably warm late-winter day we were walking not far and decided to give it a try.Walking into Toby's took us a bit by surprise. From the online menu we expected tasty, well-prepared food, and ultimately we were not disappointed. However, the bar itself is a single tiny, crowded room, with a large TV in every corner blaring sports. There's hardly a seat in the room where there isn't a TV in your face. I have no idea why anyone would want to eat a meal in a room surrounded by televisions, but we had no desire to. Thankfully, the nice weather meant that there was outdoor seating, although it did require us waiting an extra 10 minutes to be seated.The chickpea dip we ordered as an appetizer was terrific - not quite a classic hummus, but with a good and unique taste. The pizza we shared (Spicy Pecorino) had a wonderfully light crust, oven-baked and crisp, with good fresh ingredients and delicious sauce.Honestly, this would be a a 5-star review of the food if this place had a nicer space. As it stands, you're lucky to to get a seat in a room where you'll barely be able to concentrate on your meal for all the televisions showing games you wouldn't be able to watch because this place is too popular for anyone to linger long at their table. If Toby's sold their TVs to get some more seating it would be twice as nice restaurant.",3.0

"A great place to go after work before it starts getting too crowded.  LOVE every pizza I've tried - latest being the Funghi. The mushroom ravioli is to die for, and the salads are yummy & really fresh.  Also love the Dessert calzone and the strawberries with gelato.  Bam is always friendly and helpful.  Definitely an asset to the South Slope.",4.0
"Incredible brick over pizza. Fresh ingredients that taste amazing, and just about every single pizza is outstanding. The beer selection is a little boring, but the Avery pale ale is still pretty darn good. The tiramisu is AMAZING. Let me repeat -- best tiramisu is easily the best I've ever had.",5.0
"Went here on a Sunday and sat at the bar.  The bartender seemed very jacked up.  The pizza was ok, the mozzarella was by far the main attraction, however it needs a better dough to compliment it.  The pie gets weighed down and becomes very soggy,  there's something about the sauce that I can spot, but I noticed some tomato skins on my slice.  Overall I think the place is cool, it's in a cool quiet location near the cemetary.",2.0
"I just returned from here...  I have also heard that it's the same owners as Kitchen Bar.  The atmosphere is that of a sports bar-meets wood fired pizza place, almost everything in the place is a dark brown color.  The layout leads me to believe that it could get crowded easily, so I suggest getting there early if you plan on staying late.   And yes, lots of tastefull nudes from the early days of Playboy on the walls of the bathroom. Also in the bathroom: check out their wine-cork ceiling!The staff is friendly and pretty responsive, although they have been open less than a week so that's possibly subject to change.  However, I think moving forward the place will be friendly and welcoming.The Toby's Cheap Beer they have on tap is really kick ass, and only 9 bucks a pitcher.  Overall the beer selection looked good.The antipasti we had was to die for-  the Ricotta was like nothing I had ever had-  light, slightly sweet and subtle.  The Fresh Mozzarella was like something from another planet-  easily the best I'd ever had.  Also served with some bread sticks fresh from the oven and melt in your mouth good.  I could have just had those all night.The pizza was what I would expect of a wood fired pizza.  Tasty but not something to write home about.  I was more than happy to eat it, but it was pretty small, slightly larger than what I would call a ""personal size"".- not something you could share. That wouldn't be so bad, but it was on the pricey side for what they give you-  the one we had was $14 and the slice and a half left me unfulfilled.  I know that the cost of wheat is through the roof, so I'm guessing that attributes to the price.  If the cost of wheat comes down, I hope to see the prices drop by 2 - 4 dollars a pizza.  I will most certainly be back here many times through the summer-  it's a welcome addition to the neighborhood.",4.0

"Came here on a rainy January afternoon w/the hubby and another couple.  I pretty much agree with the others here: this is a good, solid restaurant, but it's really just too expensive.  Check it out, you decide:Here's what our bill was: $97.  Here's what we got (everyone shared everything):Large house salad2 pizzas One calzoneDessert calzone2 sodas, one beer, 2 coffeesPeople, please.... come on.    This should have run us $60, max.   The pizzas were good but small (for $14 each), the calzone was so-so (cheese and ham inside, the ham was cold inside).  The dessert calzone was, however, RIDICULOUS.Service was spotty- server was lovely and wonderful, but disappeared at the end and we couldn't get drink refills or the check.  Fine enough, though, but they had the nerve to charge $3 for a coke or a coffee.So if you're a cheapskate like me, you can prob find a dozen better deals in town.  But if you're somehow recession-proof, go for it- and get two dessert calzones.  Trust me.",3.0
"4 stars for the gentrifying greenwood heights as gina said.  i am loving every new place that opens in my neighborhood, bring it on! my good friend lives right across the street from here though and we have been to have several beers.  they have a great, unique selection of beers on tap.  i highly recommend their house ""Toby"" draft beer - $9 for a pitcher - a steal!  i will be back soon to try the pizza and i will report back.i'm not sure what kind of crowd will frequent Toby's, but when I went it was mostly 35 & over except for our little group.  That won't stop me from coming though, it's a great place to get together  with a big group of people.4/12/08 - update -a pitcher of Toby's ""cheap"" draft beer has been raised to $11",4.0
"Ridiculously expensive! I would give it 2.5 if it could. I shared a caprese salad with my husband.  3 slicesof mozzerella, 3 tomato wedges, $12!!  We split a pizza that was pretty tasty, but nothing special for $16.  Beers are a great deal, though and the atmosphere is nice, as is the waitstaff.   Love the idea of it, love having it close by, waaaay overpriced. We didn't expect it to be more than $40 for pizza and one beer each, but ended up having to get more cash out since they don't take credit cards",3.0
"This neighborhood gem is home to my favorite pizzas in NYC. Perfect crust, inventive yet non-ridiculous toppings all in a great corner bar in Greenwood Heights. Highly recommend the ""Del Mac"" and Spinach pizzas, but have never had one I didn't absolutely love.",5.0
"The pizza and appetizers were unmemorable and the environment a bit like an upscale sportsbar but when we were told to leave our table as others were waiting (though we had not lingered, had already paid, and were finishing our drinks) we all decided never to return. Seriously? What restaurant does that? It's inexcusable to value turnover more than people, particularly when the food is not worthy.",1.0
"I get excited about any new pizza in the area, so it gets a star for that alone.  It's mainly a bar, but they have lots of different pizza, a few appetizers and salads, and a few deserts.  We had the margherita pie, which was pretty good, but not amazing.  We also had the meat and cheese plate.  It was good, but they didn't give enough bread and then charged extra for more.  The food is kind of expensive.  They have a good selection of beer... and of course wine and cocktails.  It's cozy and I'd definitely go back.",4.0
"4 stars for pizza; 2 stars for the service, which is unfortunate. The pizza is delicious, but very overpriced. The waiter copped an obvious attitude when we failed to bite on any of his up selling - e.g. another pizza, the desserts, etc. Dude, relax, it's Sunday brunch and you work at a glorified Pizza parlor. From his attitude, you would think that you just walked in to a place like French Laundry or Alinea for table service and told the waiter you only want a glass of water and an appetizer. We ordered two pizzas for three people. Oh the horror! Very unfriendly, preoccupied with his cell phone and just an all around jerk. Would love to return for the food, but if this guy is working, I'm turning right around. Calm yourself, buddy. Oh and one more annoyance -- what is it with new businesses thinking they are too cool for credit cards? Is the cut on the ATM machine THAT good? Your pizza is so expensive to begin with, I highly doubt they will notice if you hike the prices 3% to cover the transaction fees. Finally, for you stroller wielding yuppies, leave the kids at home as these guys don't allow strollers inside -- which I would actually love to give them +1/2 star for!",2.0
"Toby's is AMAZING! I have had everything on the menu and it is all spectacular. Totally worth the $$. Great beer, nutella calzone, and great people that work there. You can't go wrong!",5.0
