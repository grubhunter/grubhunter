This place had amazing Bloody Mary's and the Bacon is to die for. The Kale salad was just as good. Great vibe with great food!Will be back,5.0
"I wish I could give them more stars. My favorite location by far. There was a wait time to be seated, so we headed to the bar. Beer and cocktail menu gets a thumbs up. Special of the day was Stout waffles and Jameson glazed fried chicken. AMAZING.Absolutely going back for brunch.Ps. Shoutout to Wilmer and Nicki. Great service!",5.0
"I'm a fan of this spot, haven't gone back in awhile, but this time we went at night, and it was a bit packed.  Nice weekend night vibe.  They had some good specials for the chicken and waffles I think it was a spicy chipotle on corn bread waffle.  I got the pecan waffle with my chicken and waffle.  Didn't get to try any of the drinks but the bartender looked like he was having a good time.I'm going have to stomach next time to eat more.",4.0
"Worth the trip to BKLYN :)Went for brunch with the Fam. Has the hipster vibe (if you are into that). The prices were a little high, but the food was good - so i didn't mind the splurge.",3.0
"I was finally able to get to Sweet Chick! My girlfriends and I went to Brooklyn Winery for a tour and tasting and afterwards wanted something outside of the winery to eat. Of course I turn to Yelp and I see Sweet Chick is walking distance so we went for it. The service was great from beginning to end. It was a Tuesday evening around 8pm and we were seated immediately. Our server was excellent!! Very personable, full of life, and acoomodating. I hate when I don't get the name but he was awesome. They serve welch's grape soda by the can! How cute! We ordered the Mac and cheese for an appetizer and it was delicious!!!! For my entrée, I ordered the fried chicken bucket with mashed potatoes. There was a seasoning or a bit of an aftertaste with the chicken that I wasn't too fond of. Weird because I ate it all and actually enjoyed it so I'm not too sure what that was about. My cousin barely ate her chicken because of that issue. The server asked if she liked it and she said not really. When the bill came, the server on his own took her chicken and waffles off the bill. She didn't ask for that nor complain so that was very nice of him. We didn't drink this time because we were way up from the winery, but I will return.",4.0
"Could not believe the wait was still 45 minutes at 2pm and there was a never ending stream of people going in and out until 4pm.  This place must always be packed.  Luckily, they have a texting system that they put your information into, so you don't have to loiter around wasting time and can go do something else (in our case, Peter Pan!)I have to mention that the music here is freaking awesome.  Old jams from the late 90's/00's that you've forgotten about, e.g. Chingy, Craig David, old JT, old JLo... had me singing the whole time I was there!  5 star music!!We were seated at the end of the bar, by choice.  It was that or sharing a 4 person table with another couple.. no thanks.  Our waitress/server was very friendly and was all smiles all day.  I ordered the obligatory chicken and waffles.  It came with 3 butters - herb (rosemary, IIRC), lemon, and blueberry.  The lemon was my favorite.  The chicken is a leg and thigh and has a very crunchy, though somewhat standardly-seasoned skin.  Inside was juicy and a bit on the salty side.  I ate mine with a self-concocted syrup and hot sauce mix.  The waffle was hot and fluffy, but also tasted like a standard Belgian waffle.  It's not hard to please me when it comes to Belgian waffles.We also ordered a side of biscuit and chicken sausage gravy.  It was okay.... we both thought the rosemary or whatever herb it was in the gravy was far too strong for our tastes.  SO liked his eggs benny, but I didn't have a bite.Was it worth the wait?  I'm sure the wait is even worse during peak brunch hours, so I'd probably pass on a second time as it was a good meal, but not so good that I would wait that long for it when I can probably get something similar at many other places.Pros: music, service, tasteCons: wait, chicken sausage gravy",4.0
"Came here for brunch and ordered chicken and waffles with a side of macaroni and cheese. The food was delicious, except the chicken had some weird tangy taste to it.

"The wait times here can be crazy so be prepared. I'm glad they have a system in place where they can send you a text message when your table is ready.

Everything else on the menu is great and I haven't had a bad experience to date.",5.0
"I've been going to the Ludlow Street location for a couple of years now, but this was my first time eating at the original. The music is loud, the atmosphere dark, seating can be a little cramped, all pretty similar in vibe to the Manhattan outpost. The food is also the same- delicious and worth coming out for. Crawfish hushpuppies are my go to appetizer here, their fried chicken has some of the most flavorful, crispy, slightly spicy breading I've ever had. It's perfection. The mashed potatoes with gravy is also a must. I finally tried a bite of the General Tso's chicken and waffles, and while it seems like a gimmicky dish it's actually very well done. They really put a lot of effort into their food. Cocktails are well crafted too.They seat people till 1:30am, even on a Sunday, which I just love. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because of the service. I've never been treated like anything other than gold in Manhattan, but here our server seemed to dislike his job, and look down on us for daring to come into the restaurant. Every interaction was greeted with a snarky sarcasm, even when he made mistakes. Disappointing, just no need for that type of nonsense, especially when the product is so great. I would still come back if I was around, but all things being equal, I'd prefer to go to the location in the city.ETA as of March 2016: That waiter got fired right quick, go without fear of snarky service!",5.0
"I went here today with my kids for brunch. I really enjoyed myself. Luckily we got there at about 11:30 because after that it started getting really crowded and there was a wait for a table.Our waiter was courteous, informative & attentive. He asked if it was our first time, & then made suggestions. We had already studied the menu so we knew what we wanted. I also liked that extra napkins are in the table you don't need to hunt down the waiter for more.The eggs Benny my daughter ordered was good. Flavorful and she asked about getting her eggs cooked differently & the waiter suggested she can get them poached a little longer. Myself and my son ordered the chicken & waffles. It was very good. The chicken was cooked perfectly. Crunchy crust and just the right amount if spices. The waffles were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Three different flavored butters come with it as well. Herb, honey/lemon & blueberry. I liked the blueberry flavor the best.We also ordered a side of biscuits & gravy. We got the sausage one. It's made from chicken sausage. It was a little pricey ($6 for one) but the flavor was good. My son really liked it. We also got biscuit with butter and jelly. The jelly had some type of citrus in it. Either orange or lemon. It was good too.Bellini's were small but were good as well.The only reason I'm not giving five stars is because it's  small in there and I didn't care for the cafeteria style seating we had to sit at. And I felt rushed because people were waiting to sit so we felt like we couldn't stay longer.Overall, it was good, well prepared, flavorful food with good service! Great music as well..I'd go back.",4.0
The place is tiny with long picnic style tables and attached bench seating. Very busy and very noisy.  This is NOT a place to bring kids or a stroller. Chicken and waffles with assorted sweet butters were good though so I'd come back.,4.0

So i have a wonderful friend who loves to eat what it seems only brooklyn cuisine. But while going through her reviews i came across this place. The pictures make it look to die for and my friends review only made me want to visit even quicker. At first glance it is the A typical brooklyn bar that sells food.  After looking at the menu(even though I had my heart set on chicken and waffles already) i order the chicken with general Tso's sauce and cheddar waffle. While i waited i had me a drink which was very flavorful. There was a hint of cinnamon and other flavors i just couldnt put my hand on it. It held me over until my food came. I took a gamble with ordering the general Tso chicken because i hadnt had that kind of chicken in a while. My review of it was mehh. Nothing fancy but also nothing to go crazy for. The Tso sauce is sweet and spicey at the same time and maybe i was being kinda greedy but i did not enjoy it. The waffle was great couldnt have been better. Next time and yes there will be a next time i will go for the regular chicken. But this time around i will leave it with a mehhh.,3.0
"Sweet is Chick is Awesome! This was my first time at the Williamsburg location. I've been the the LES location once before and absolutely loved it. Last night my friend and I went around 8pm and it wasn't that busy at all! It was perfect because we got a table as soon as we arrived. I remembered the Mac n' Cheese being sooooo good. I knew that we had to order it. We shared the starter portion. It was the perfect amount to share as an appetizer. Then we each ordered the chicken and waffles. I had the original, which were incredible. I'm usually not a huge waffle person, but the waffles here are so sweet and tasty. My friend ordered the rosemary and mushroom waffles and she also loved them. Also, they had on the wall as a special fried brussels.

A great location for a Southern brunch. The chicken and waffles were perfect and they came with a bonus of 3 craft butters that uniquely enhanced the chicken and waffle pairing. The one downside is that the restaurant is small and they cram in as many people as possible. It is hard to walk around the tables and if you are a party of two you will most likely be sharing a table with another party of two so prepare to accidentally eaves drop or make some new friends. This is a popular location so come early or put your name in and then walk and explore some of the cool neighboring stores.,4.0

"The juiciest fried chicken and the best waffles I've had in a while! So happy I chose this place for this dinner. The must order dishes are the Chicken and Waffle $16. With 2 fat chicken pieces and 4 waffle quarters, we chose the rosemary ones. The honey it came with was spicy, beware! and 3 different butters. On top of this magnificent dish, we got a bucket of chicken $17 (comes with 3 pieces of chicken and 1 giant biscuit made with what i can only assume, a full stick of butter, which was good, though my friend loved it and ate all of it)The cornbread $2 is small and nothing special. It barely tastes like corn, but it has other vegetables in it. It was very fresh and soft, but not a winner.Another huge MUST GET is the Mac n' Cheese! this thing that looks pale white cream and incredibly boring was actually the funnest, richest and cheesiest mac n cheese ive had, and the pasta cooked soft yet firm. It was one of the favorites of the table and it was gone in less than a minute! My vegetarian friend got the veggie option, where the crust is exactly like the friend chicken but the texture obviously of a dense sponge. It was fine. Nothing I can say, I am a carnivore. The Shrimp and Grits $22 were very good, juicy fresh shrimp in a great sauce. But if I had to choose, i'd go with the fried chicken and waffles. The texture here was just too soupy, too mushy.The cocktails were strong and not very sweet which works. Great service but 6 of us were cramped in one of the wall picnic tables and it was not comfortable, they should not put 6 people there, ever! Also gave us the wrong check, and when the server took it back to fix, it went from $120 to $187. Um, no problem but how does that even happen?Parking is okay on the weekdays, reservations encouraged because it looks like they always have a full house, no lines, but just rightly packed. LOVE YOU SWEET CHICK!!! Too bad I don't live in Brooklyn anymore.",5.0

"Can there be southern comfort food better than this in New York? *Strokes beard and ponders while looking wistfully out of window, shakes head* No...no there simply cannot be better southern comfort food than this in New York.The interior of this place is darling, country, and rustic. Waitress was great and even helped in making decisions with dinner. Tried a beverage called the sweet chick because I enjoy redundancy. It was refreshing and tasty, not too heavy, very light. But besides this, LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THE BEST MAC AND CHEESE EVER. Gooey, creamy, and delicious mac and cheese with a salty and amazing Ritz cracker crust. Best I've ever had. Ever. Side of collard slaw was great, tangy and bold. The buffalo fried chicken and waffles. How do I even articulate the flavor of this meal? Does the image of me slamming my fork down after my first bite and yelling ""HOLY SHIT, THAT'S INCREDIBLE!"" help?? Buffalo chicken was juicy and tender and VERY spicy. Ripping it off the bone, dunking it in blue cheese and putting it on a soft and delicious celery/carrot waffle was almost a religious experience. The meal of a lifetime. Epic. If I could eat one meal forever, it would be found here.",5.0
"Probably one of my least favorite places to eat in. I work only a few blocks away, so I obliged when one of my friends wanted to go here. I've been here twice. The music is always too loud and it's too dark. The first time I've ever been here, the service was HORRIBLE. We were never checked in on. I had to ask the hostess for something, because our waitress was not in sight. I had the classic chicken and waffles. The waffle was meh at best. The chicken was spicy.I went again last night with friends who were dying to go. Again, I obliged despite my better judgement. Why didn't I trust my judgement? I ordered the Mac & cheese and just classic waffles. The service was much better, but the waiter was extremely sarcastic and I used every ounce of my self control not to lose it. I asked the waiter about the mac and cheese. I wanted to know if they have different types, use several cheeses, etc. His response was ""it's mac and cheese."" Later on, my friend is eating the mac and cheese and she bites on a piece of meat. I thought she was joking, because I hadn't tasted any meat and the waiter told me that there was no meat in it. Later on, I bit into the same thing. When the waiter comes back the conversation went like this:Friend: Excuse me, is there meat in this?Waiter: NoFriend: Well, I bit into something. Waiter: Does it taste like meat?Friend: YesWaiter: So there you have it. It's meat. Are you freaking kidding me? I spent way too much money on this place. I refuse to spend another dime on this place.",2.0
"The hostess that was controlling the wait list on 1/1/16 needs some customer service training. We had a misunderstanding and came in when the wait was 30 minutes, so we said okay and waited. Instead of taking our name for her list she insisted that we walked away so our name wasn't down (although I stated my name a few times in our conversation). It wasn't until we kept waiting and realized we should have already been seated that we asked her again and she finally put our name down. It was upsetting considering the fact that she looked at us many times and I'm sure she had ""man I should put their name on the list"" on her mind but she instead said nothing... also by this time we saw several people put their name down that came in after us -_-.Aside from that, the food was so good! The chicken and waffles were fantastic and lived up to the expectation. I also think that they have a great selection of flavored butters for your waffles (blueberry was so good).

I LOVE this place in both locations.  My go to items are the Fried Chicken Bucket and Mac-N-Cheese every time...i love them.  They must brine or season the chicken before they bread it and you can taste the different flavor profiles.  Great vibe and people .....they play 90's Hip Hop and great music.  Its like you are going out...and you are just out to eat.,5.0
Came for that good ol Mac n CheeseHold the bacon tho... I'm so sincere about my no flesh diet,4.0
"The juiciest fried chicken and the best waffles I've had in a while! So happy I chose this place for this dinner. The must order dishes are the Chicken and Waffle $16. With 2 fat chicken pieces and 4 waffle quarters, we chose the rosemary ones. The honey it came with was spicy, beware! and 3 different butters. On top of this magnificent dish, we got a bucket of chicken $17 (comes with 3 pieces of chicken and 1 giant biscuit made with what i can only assume, a full stick of butter, which was good, though my friend loved it and ate all of it)The cornbread $2 is small and nothing special. It barely tastes like corn, but it has other vegetables in it. It was very fresh and soft, but not a winner.Another huge MUST GET is the Mac n' Cheese! this thing that looks pale white cream and incredibly boring was actually the funnest, richest and cheesiest mac n cheese ive had, and the pasta cooked soft yet firm. It was one of the favorites of the table and it was gone in less than a minute! My vegetarian friend got the veggie option, where the crust is exactly like the friend chicken but the texture obviously of a dense sponge. It was fine. Nothing I can say, I am a carnivore. The Shrimp and Grits $22 were very good, juicy fresh shrimp in a great sauce. But if I had to choose, i'd go with the fried chicken and waffles. The texture here was just too soupy, too mushy.The cocktails were strong and not very sweet which works. Great service but 6 of us were cramped in one of the wall picnic tables and it was not comfortable, they should not put 6 people there, ever! Also gave us the wrong check, and when the server took it back to fix, it went from $120 to $187. Um, no problem but how does that even happen?Parking is okay on the weekdays, reservations encouraged because it looks like they always have a full house, no lines, but just rightly packed. LOVE YOU SWEET CHICK!!! Too bad I don't live in Brooklyn anymore.",5.0
"Food was great, menu was limited (which can be a pro for the indecisive like myself, a con for frequent visitors wanting to try new things), restrooms were clean, service was average, ambiance was cool and casual and the tunes were great!I had the vegetarian chicken and waffles and was in love! The veggie chicken tasted so much like the real thing - soo good!",4.0

"Can there be southern comfort food better than this in New York? *Strokes beard and ponders while looking wistfully out of window, shakes head* No...no there simply cannot be better southern comfort food than this in New York.The interior of this place is darling, country, and rustic. Waitress was great and even helped in making decisions with dinner. Tried a beverage called the sweet chick because I enjoy redundancy. It was refreshing and tasty, not too heavy, very light. But besides this, LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THE BEST MAC AND CHEESE EVER. Gooey, creamy, and delicious mac and cheese with a salty and amazing Ritz cracker crust. Best I've ever had. Ever. Side of collard slaw was great, tangy and bold. The buffalo fried chicken and waffles. How do I even articulate the flavor of this meal? Does the image of me slamming my fork down after my first bite and yelling ""HOLY SHIT, THAT'S INCREDIBLE!"" help?? Buffalo chicken was juicy and tender and VERY spicy. Ripping it off the bone, dunking it in blue cheese and putting it on a soft and delicious celery/carrot waffle was almost a religious experience. The meal of a lifetime. Epic. If I could eat one meal forever, it would be found here.",5.0
"Probably one of my least favorite places to eat in. I work only a few blocks away, so I obliged when one of my friends wanted to go here. I've been here twice. The music is always too loud and it's too dark. The first time I've ever been here, the service was HORRIBLE. We were never checked in on. I had to ask the hostess for something, because our waitress was not in sight. I had the classic chicken and waffles. The waffle was meh at best. The chicken was spicy.I went again last night with friends who were dying to go. Again, I obliged despite my better judgement. Why didn't I trust my judgement? I ordered the Mac & cheese and just classic waffles. The service was much better, but the waiter was extremely sarcastic and I used every ounce of my self control not to lose it. I asked the waiter about the mac and cheese. I wanted to know if they have different types, use several cheeses, etc. His response was ""it's mac and cheese."" Later on, my friend is eating the mac and cheese and she bites on a piece of meat. I thought she was joking, because I hadn't tasted any meat and the waiter told me that there was no meat in it. Later on, I bit into the same thing. When the waiter comes back the conversation went like this:Friend: Excuse me, is there meat in this?Waiter: NoFriend: Well, I bit into something. Waiter: Does it taste like meat?Friend: YesWaiter: So there you have it. It's meat. Are you freaking kidding me? I spent way too much money on this place. I refuse to spend another dime on this place.",2.0
"The hostess that was controlling the wait list on 1/1/16 needs some customer service training. We had a misunderstanding and came in when the wait was 30 minutes, so we said okay and waited. Instead of taking our name for her list she insisted that we walked away so our name wasn't down (although I stated my name a few times in our conversation). It wasn't until we kept waiting and realized we should have already been seated that we asked her again and she finally put our name down. It was upsetting considering the fact that she looked at us many times and I'm sure she had ""man I should put their name on the list"" on her mind but she instead said nothing... also by this time we saw several people put their name down that came in after us -_-.Aside from that, the food was so good! The chicken and waffles were fantastic and lived up to the expectation. I also think that they have a great selection of flavored butters for your waffles (blueberry was so good). So aside from needing to do better with their seating service, Sweet Chick is a go.",4.0
"Had late night dinner last night and I am very happy that I came to check this spot out. There was a wait but it was worth it. Ordered One of their specialty drinks and it was pretty good. My entree was the chicken and waffles. I had the spiced pecan which tastes amazing and the chicken was great as well. I tasted different types of butter. Once was a blueberry one but I forgot the other ones. They tasted good though that's what matters lol. Service was also great. Very attentive. Overall, I had no complaints. Would definitely come back!!",5.0
"I think they should rename the ""Mac and cheese"" to ""shell pasta with a cheesy, creamy white sauce."" It was very tasted and well seasoned but the name doesn't fit. The fried chicken was great!

I was sad that I saw something on IG and when we came it wasn't on the menu, only to find out later there is a secret menu! Dang. But don't come for between lunch and dinner...

"There is not a single thing I don't love about this place. Hands down, the best chicken and waffles I've ever had. I will never get sick of them. They have unique flavor combinations, like chicken cordon bleu waffles and General Tso chicken waffles, but I am a sucker for Mike's hot honey fried chicken with bacon cheddar waffles. So good. I usually always get the same thing, because it's so incredible, but their whole menu is probably just as delicious. Their mac and cheese has a Ritz cracker crust and is incredible. Also, they have daily some ice cream sandwich specials and I've never had one that I didn't totally totally love. The service is always great and even though the restaurant is small inside, it's usually pretty easy to get a table. I've never waited longer than 25 minutes on a weekend at prime dinner hour. They are considerate enough to let you go hang at a bar until your table is ready and call you so you don't get stuck waiting in the cold (there isn't much, if any, room to wait inside). And their cocktail menu is unreal. The Tiger Tiger Woods Ya'll is my personal favorite, but they also have Purple Drank, which you must try. For the portions and the quality and the service, the prices are spot on. The atmosphere is cute and quaint. It's a great place for a date or birthday dinner or just a girl's night out. They have a full brunch menu and even vegetarian chicken options which are equally as delicious. There is not a single thing you could order that would disappoint. If you are in Brooklyn or even just in New York, you need to try this place.",5.0

I usually don't mind, and I drag who ever is with me to this bead shop nearby, but if your hungry, sometime you may not be in the mood to wait out in the streets, however on November morning I was waiting outside to be seated and I saw a really weird woman jogging by, completely topless, and i'm talking national geographic, so... I mean there are some things to do while you wait I guess. lol. the food is good, I always get the chicken and waffles and have never gone for dinner actually. I love love love teh different butters they bring out, but you don't really get enough waffles to eat all the butter and I fell hella bad for having all that butter left over. I am picky about my fried chicken, its not the best, and its not the worst, but in my opinion its crispy to the point that its too hard and the batter had waaaaay too much rosemary in it.

"Ive heard about this place awhile ago so my sister and I decided to take a trip here for dinner on Saturday February 27. We arrived at 7pm and was told the wait would be 40 mins so the hostess took our name and number and would call us when our table was ready. The place is cozy and has a hippy chic feel with a picnic style table in the middle, a bar, and a few tables surrounding. There isn't any room to wait for your table or you will be bumping into guests. If anyone recalls this was a windy, cold night. We browsed the neighborhood shops and returned to see how much longer the wait would be. We stood by the door and they had a curtain blocking the cold from outside but it didn't really help. FoodBecause of the wait, we looked over the menu and already knew what we wanted as soon as our waiter arrived. We ordered the mac and cheese and cornbread to start. The mac n cheese was creamy and had a ritz cracker topping, it was good. The cornbread was my favorite it had a down south feel with actual corn in it and a hint of sweetness. For my entree I got the chicken and pean spic waffle and i don't really like waffles but the waffle literally melts in your mouth. The chicken was very moist and just ok. They have a variety of waffles. My sister ordered the shrimp and grits, it wasn't your typical shrimp and grits, it was a red based sauce with peppers, onions and a little spice to wake up your palette. Very good.Overall I would come again if I'm in the area to check out the waffle options. The service was just ok, nothing to write home about.",4.0
"Good sh*t Sweet Chicks on stepping up your fried chicken & waffles! And this is why it's good to always give places that you think have better potential or that people keeps buzzing about a second chance when you weren't impressed the first time!First off, thumbs up that their bacon cheddar waffles, rosemary & mushroom waffles or any of their waffles that use to be only on their specials is now officially an addition to their regular menu! That being said, I finally got to try the bacon cheddar waffle without it being sold out this time and.... MY GOODNESS IT WAS SOO DARN SCRUMPTIOUS. They even give you three different flavored butters now; pink lemonade, blueberry, and mixed herbs butter. The fried chicken? Well I never knew you could tell them what type of meat you preferred until I went ahead and just asked for dark meat chicken only. It was soo juicy and even the batter this time wasn't hard or overly crunchy like my first experience here. The chicken was seasoned better as well, I could taste and smell the fresh rosemary!I've always loved all their interesting dessert options... I could never pick. But since the donut ice cream sandwich isn't sold out like the first time, I ended up picking that! Freakin goood. The donut is more like a soft crumbly muffin!",4.0
"Sweet Chick has always been on my list of chicken and waffles to try. Unfortunately, I can't be eating that all that often so it took a while to visit Sweet Chick until today. Friday 3:30 pm, no lines and a few empty tables every now and then. Odd hours seem to be the way to go!My party of three ordered the chicken and waffles, chicken and waffle sandwich, and the sweet chick waffles. Didn't get to try the special waffles, but the original is good. Crispy warm waffles yum. The chicken was very well seasoned. I've tried a few chicken and waffles at other establishments and some of the meat on the inside can be bland. The portion for the chicken and waffles was decent. Although my friend who ordered the chicken and waffle sandwich was kind of disappointed with the size of his sandwich. He was however, given a big portion of fries. His exact words being ""I expected to see fireworks, but I only saw a few sparks"" when he described his sandwich, and he swore he tried his best taking time to savor it haha.It's gonna be a while until I have a craving for Chicken and Waffles again, but Sweet Chick has definitely squeezed its way to the top of my revisit list.",4.0
"Seriously the BEST brunch I have ever had. There was unfortunately a long wait, but it was well worth it. We got there and there was an hour and a half wait, so we put our name down and then wandered around, had a couple beers at Brooklyn Brewery (highly recommend). When we got back to the restaurant, we had to wait a few more minutes before being seated, but the service was pretty quick and extremely friendly. I ordered the sweet chick waffles, which came with fresh berries and three types of homemade butter (berry, lemon, and herb. SO good). My boyfriend got the steak and eggs, also amazing, and then we shared a side of fried chicken and side of macaroni and cheese. Everything we got was seriously delicious, we ate every single bite. I also got 2 mimosas, which tasted so fresh. They were definitely made with fresh squeezed orange juice and good quality champagne. Overall, a wonderful experience, even though there was a long wait. Would definitely go again!!",5.0
"The best chicken and waffles I have ever tasted. You must go and try. My boyfriend and I came for brunch and we were not disappointed. The restaurant has a very cool vibe, and the staff are friendly. We started with a side order of Mac n' Cheese for an appetizer. It was SO decadent and delicious. I would go just to order that if I was craving it. It didn't survive long enough for a picture. Sorry, just trust you need to order it. The main attraction, chicken and waffles. I ordered mine with original waffles (you can order different types), and my boyfriend ordered the bacon cheddar waffles. The waffles were golden crispy and so soft on the inside. The chicken, super moist. There is just SO much flavor in one plate. And just incase there wasn't enough flavor, I say that sarcastically, they give the chicken and waffles with 3 types of butter. Original, garlic/herb and a raspberry type. Just a heads up, it does get busy. We came around 11:30a.m, 30 mins after opening, and it was already almost full. We paid $68 for 3 plates+appetizer+2 iced coffees. Iced coffees are $4 each btw.Overall, this is a hidden gem of Queens/Brooklyn. We WILL be coming back.",5.0

"Firstly, walking in, the hosts find it more important to talk to each other about the scheduling mistake their higher-up made, what they had to go through and what they thought they deserved because of it, instead of even acknowledging the guest that walked in, for about 10 seconds of standing within 3 feet in front of them, in plain sight. It was a little after 5pm. The restaurant was probably at 30% capacity with what looked like a full staff on. Not busy or chaotic at all. Moving on.As a single, I happily sat at the bar where I was given a menu after about 3 min of idly sitting there. I saw it was happy hour and so I asked what was offered. The bartender girl rapidly told me with an expressionless face, then quickly turned away before I could even say thank you. I ordered with a different bartender, a guy who was stoic but not necessarily rude or impolite, and received my food a short while later. The food was really good. Got the classic chicken and waffles. Delicious enough for me to not mind the $17 price tag or portion size at all.As I ate my meal, I looked around and observed how every employee in there never smiled unless they were off to the side, chatting with their coworker. The misery was draining. Nobody checked in on me, not even once. The bartender girl filled my water once, but didn't even look at me or acknowledge me clearly saying, ""thank you"". She wasn't even facing me.I finished my food and drink, cleaned up my space and waited to get the attention of the bartender girl for my check. She asked if there was anything else she could get for me, and I responded, ""No thank you, I'll ju--"" Whoop! There she quickly turned away from me again while I was mid-sentence. This style of service wasn't exclusive to me either. I saw other guests standing at the door, waiting to be seated in an uncrowded, relatively calm restaurant by people who just couldn't be bothered. Happy, enthusiastic guests talking to their unhappy, unamused servers and bartenders.Now, I've worked in the service industry for almost 10 years, and I have to say that this is some entitled ass shit. I always tip 20%+ even when the food and service isn't amazing, but wow, do I not like the people running this place. I still tipped over 10% because I am not a complete asshole. You shouldn't act as though you're doing your paying patrons a favor by even gracing them with your presence. People spend their hard-earned money to escape to restaurants for good food, good company, and good times. Not... This.I guess some people in Brooklyn are just too pretentious and unpleasant for my taste. I mean, really, I hope you all are at least aware of how bad your collective service and energy is.",2.0

"What a good surprise. After a long walk around in the cold we looked through the windows at Sweet Chick. The huge plates of chicken and waffles lured me and my rumbling stomach inside.We reserved a table for two and had to wait for about 45 minutes: of course because such a place is obviously popular amongst New Yorkers! Others guests coming in had to write down their phone number so they could ring them when they had a table available. Since I have a Dutch phone number, I had to make sure I was back half an hour beforehand.After walking around the streets for a while, we were seated at our table. Unfortunately they were out of ginger beer, but instead I was offered delicious ginger lemonade which the staff made. Much better than ginger beer! Then our food arrived. We were so happy we waited for this! Such delicious soft waffles with crispy chicken (I would recommend 'the original' with cheddar and ham). I couldn't eat the huge amount but I was very happy to see that you at least get very large portions for the money you pay.All in all, highly recommended! Great food, cozy atmosphere and very friendly service!",5.0
"Let me start this saying that my dad found this place and insisted we go. I've been on a healthy kick so I protested too much. No, seriously, I did protest too much. Never protest. This was worth the extra arsecheek I just earned.Chicken is well-seasoned and not too greasy. Waffles (I had dried cherry) are light, fluffy, moist, crispy on the outside... holy lawd. Comes with some berry and lemon butters to try. Cool vibe, cool music (I swear to God I'm not a hipster, so this is legit). Waitstaff is really nice and helpful; my mom got the bacon waffle by accident and though they promptly amended it they also comped a couple things which was sweet of them to do.There's a good reason they were packed.",5.0

And this is why it's good to always give places that you think have better potential or that people keeps buzzing about a second chance when you weren't impressed the first time!First off, thumbs up that their bacon cheddar waffles, rosemary & mushroom waffles or any of their waffles that use to be only on their specials is now officially an addition to their regular menu! That being said, I finally got to try the bacon cheddar waffle without it being sold out this time and.... MY GOODNESS IT WAS SOO DARN SCRUMPTIOUS. They even give you three different flavored butters now; pink lemonade, blueberry, and mixed herbs butter. The fried chicken? Well I never knew you could tell them what type of meat you preferred until I went ahead and just asked for dark meat chicken only. It was soo juicy and even the batter this time wasn't hard or overly crunchy like my first experience here. The chicken was seasoned better as well, I could taste and smell the fresh rosemary!I've always loved all their interesting dessert options... I could never pick. But since the donut ice cream sandwich isn't sold out like the first time, I ended up picking that! Freakin goood. The donut is more like a soft crumbly muffin!",4.0
"Sweet Chick has always been on my list of chicken and waffles to try. Unfortunately, I can't be eating that all that often so it took a while to visit Sweet Chick until today. Friday 3:30 pm, no lines and a few empty tables every now and then. Odd hours seem to be the way to go!My party of three ordered the chicken and waffles, chicken and waffle sandwich, and the sweet chick waffles. Didn't get to try the special waffles, but the original is good. Crispy warm waffles yum. The chicken was very well seasoned. I've tried a few chicken and waffles at other establishments and some of the meat on the inside can be bland. The portion for the chicken and waffles was decent. Although my friend who ordered the chicken and waffle sandwich was kind of disappointed with the size of his sandwich. He was however, given a big portion of fries. His exact words being ""I expected to see fireworks, but I only saw a few sparks"" when he described his sandwich, and he swore he tried his best taking time to savor it haha.It's gonna be a while until I have a craving for Chicken and Waffles again, but Sweet Chick has definitely squeezed its way to the top of my revisit list.",4.0
"Seriously the BEST brunch I have ever had. There was unfortunately a long wait, but it was well worth it. We got there and there was an hour and a half wait, so we put our name down and then wandered around, had a couple beers at Brooklyn Brewery (highly recommend). When we got back to the restaurant, we had to wait a few more minutes before being seated, but the service was pretty quick and extremely friendly. I ordered the sweet chick waffles, which came with fresh berries and three types of homemade butter (berry, lemon, and herb. SO good). My boyfriend got the steak and eggs, also amazing, and then we shared a side of fried chicken and side of macaroni and cheese. Everything we got was seriously delicious, we ate every single bite. I also got 2 mimosas, which tasted so fresh. They were definitely made with fresh squeezed orange juice and good quality champagne. Overall, a wonderful experience, even though there was a long wait. Would definitely go again!!",5.0
"The best chicken and waffles I have ever tasted. You must go and try. My boyfriend and I came for brunch and we were not disappointed. The restaurant has a very cool vibe, and the staff are friendly. We started with a side order of Mac n' Cheese for an appetizer. It was SO decadent and delicious. I would go just to order that if I was craving it. It didn't survive long enough for a picture. Sorry, just trust you need to order it. The main attraction, chicken and waffles. I ordered mine with original waffles (you can order different types), and my boyfriend ordered the bacon cheddar waffles. The waffles were golden crispy and so soft on the inside. The chicken, super moist. There is just SO much flavor in one plate. And just incase there wasn't enough flavor, I say that sarcastically, they give the chicken and waffles with 3 types of butter. Original, garlic/herb and a raspberry type. Just a heads up, it does get busy. We came around 11:30a.m, 30 mins after opening, and it was already almost full. We paid $68 for 3 plates+appetizer+2 iced coffees. Iced coffees are $4 each btw.Overall, this is a hidden gem of Queens/Brooklyn. We WILL be coming back.",5.0
"Fried Chicken Waffles. I might still be working these off a month later, but totally worth it. Deliciously naughty and best hangover food I can imagine.",4.0
"Firstly, walking in, the hosts find it more important to talk to each other about the scheduling mistake their higher-up made, what they had to go through and what they thought they deserved because of it, instead of even acknowledging the guest that walked in, for about 10 seconds of standing within 3 feet in front of them, in plain sight. It was a little after 5pm. The restaurant was probably at 30% capacity with what looked like a full staff on. Not busy or chaotic at all. Moving on.As a single, I happily sat at the bar where I was given a menu after about 3 min of idly sitting there. I saw it was happy hour and so I asked what was offered. The bartender girl rapidly told me with an expressionless face, then quickly turned away before I could even say thank you. I ordered with a different bartender, a guy who was stoic but not necessarily rude or impolite, and received my food a short while later. The food was really good. Got the classic chicken and waffles. Delicious enough for me to not mind the $17 price tag or portion size at all.As I ate my meal, I looked around and observed how every employee in there never smiled unless they were off to the side, chatting with their coworker. The misery was draining. Nobody checked in on me, not even once. The bartender girl filled my water once, but didn't even look at me or acknowledge me clearly saying, ""thank you"". She wasn't even facing me.I finished my food and drink, cleaned up my space and waited to get the attention of the bartender girl for my check. She asked if there was anything else she could get for me, and I responded, ""No thank you, I'll ju--"" Whoop! There she quickly turned away from me again while I was mid-sentence. This style of service wasn't exclusive to me either. I saw other guests standing at the door, waiting to be seated in an uncrowded, relatively calm restaurant by people who just couldn't be bothered. Happy, enthusiastic guests talking to their unhappy, unamused servers and bartenders.Now, I've worked in the service industry for almost 10 years, and I have to say that this is some entitled ass shit. I always tip 20%+ even when the food and service isn't amazing, but wow, do I not like the people running this place. I still tipped over 10% because I am not a complete asshole. You shouldn't act as though you're doing your paying patrons a favor by even gracing them with your presence. People spend their hard-earned money to escape to restaurants for good food, good company, and good times. Not... This.I guess some people in Brooklyn are just too pretentious and unpleasant for my taste. I mean, really, I hope you all are at least aware of how bad your collective service and energy is.",2.0
"This place left me speechlessEverything was incredible- Mac and cheese, Brussel sprouts, corn bread with Gruyere and onion, their original chicken and cordon bleu chicken and bacon and cheddar waffles with three flavored butters...I didn't know how to come up for air and take a breath, the food was so amazingly delicious.The fried chicken was very lean and perfectly juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside.They also serve an interesting drink I've never come across- hard root beer.Waffles were perfectly Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside- fluffyBrussel sprouts were in some sweet glaze Mac and cheese was just oozing I want to live here",5.0
"What a good surprise. After a long walk around in the cold we looked through the windows at Sweet Chick. The huge plates of chicken and waffles lured me and my rumbling stomach inside.We reserved a table for two and had to wait for about 45 minutes: of course because such a place is obviously popular amongst New Yorkers! Others guests coming in had to write down their phone number so they could ring them when they had a table available. Since I have a Dutch phone number, I had to make sure I was back half an hour beforehand.After walking around the streets for a while, we were seated at our table. Unfortunately they were out of ginger beer, but instead I was offered delicious ginger lemonade which the staff made. Much better than ginger beer! Then our food arrived. We were so happy we waited for this! Such delicious soft waffles with crispy chicken (I would recommend 'the original' with cheddar and ham). I couldn't eat the huge amount but I was very happy to see that you at least get very large portions for the money you pay.All in all, highly recommended! Great food, cozy atmosphere and very friendly service!",5.0
"Let me start this saying that my dad found this place and insisted we go. I've been on a healthy kick so I protested too much. No, seriously, I did protest too much. Never protest. This was worth the extra arsecheek I just earned.Chicken is well-seasoned and not too greasy. Waffles (I had dried cherry) are light, fluffy, moist, crispy on the outside... holy lawd. Comes with some berry and lemon butters to try. Cool vibe, cool music (I swear to God I'm not a hipster, so this is legit). Waitstaff is really nice and helpful; my mom got the bacon waffle by accident and though they promptly amended it they also comped a couple things which was sweet of them to do.There's a good reason they were packed.",5.0

"First things first, there is a wait no letter what time of the day you get there. Don't sweat it. The food is totally worth it.

We took the opportunity to visit local shops just down the street and bought some cute clothes. When our table was ready, we eagerly anticipated out meal. One of the specials that day was the biscuits and gravy. Three out of the four of us ordered that and it was amazing!I got mine with the mushroom gravy. The meal was also served with poached eggs. Soooo delicious. The service was quick and courteous. I believe the only think that caught me off guard was the price of drinks. Mimosas, Bellinis, etc. Cost as much as the entrees (around $10).

They have private tables as well as picnic bench seating in the middle. Like being outside, only... inside.Started out with the duck liver pate. It was good but oh so rich. Could probably share among 3 or 4 people.For my chicken and waffles, we went with the rosemary/mushroom waffle to share. The waffle was excellent, and the chicken was crispy and moist (don't you just love that word?) without being overly greasy.Service was quick and waitstaff was nice.

"My husband and I recently relocated from Raleigh, NC to NYC and after 5 years there, trust me we got a very good idea as to what ""southern"" food is. We were excited to try Sweet Chick for this reason.We went on a Sunday during brunch and the hostess informed us there would be a 1.5 hour wait. We scurried on down to Station for a drink in the meantime. We were notified in less than the time we were told, which was a pleasant surprise.We sat down at a table near the door, which was a little draft but on a 55 degree late January day, it was no big deal.We each had a beer, my husband the seasonal special and I an Ithaca Flower Power IPA, both very good.I ordered the shrimp and grits, which had a bell pepper sauce on it. It was surprisingly, very very delicious. There were 5 shrimp, probably pretty average for a restaurant serving. The dish was not dry at all and the shrimp were cooked perfectly, tail on.My husband had the chicken and waffles. It came with a full waffle, two pieces of fried chicken, and three different types of butter (a savory, an orange, and a blueberry). The chicken itself was moist and about a 7.5/10 by southern standards. The waffle itself was very good, we both especially liked the orange butter with maple syrup.We definitely plan to go back to get the full menu with more waffle options and I'm sure different toppings. All in all, definitely worth the trip and worth a recommendation!!!!",4.0
"Just finished eating still sitting in the restaurant enjoying a cocktail. Absolutely wonderful. I've been to plenty of places from bottom of the barrel to Michelin star and Sweet Chick gets it. Wednesday night. Good crowd despite the rain. We were seated immediately. Great music selection mixture of pop, R & B and hip hop. Waiter came over timely to take drink orders. I had the So Fresh, So Clean  one word amazing. I'm a sucker for a great cocktail and So Fresh, So Clean is definitely that. Well balanced, aromatic and satisfying if you love bourbon and fernet a must try. I had several. My guest just had lemonade boring lol I also had the Tiger Tiger Woods Y'all. It's was good but not as good or memorable as the So Fresh, So Clean. We ordered the Mac & cheese, crawfish hush puppies, fried chicken Parmesan and Nashville hot fried chicken. Mac & cheese was great. Well seasoned, cheesy and gooey. Perfect blend of cheeses. Only complaint is I wanted more of the ritz cracker crust.The hush puppies were divine. They were light and crisp had great crawfish flavor. Remoulade and sweeter sauce (forgot the name) were great accompaniments.  The Nashville hot fried chicken was so good. Fluffy Belgian waffle with Dulce de leche sauce (not too much sauce or too sweet) with spicy fried chicken. I didn't need any syrup on my waffle just amazing.  The chicken well seasoned, still juicy, crispy and spicy. My only complaint is I got a thigh and leg and I would have preferred a breast. But delicious nonetheless and I cleared my plate.My guest had the  fried chicken Parmesan. She said it was incredible. Her waffle didn't need any syrup, either, barely needed any butter. She said she would definitely order this plate again.The house butters that accompany the chicken and waffles, honey lemon, berry and rosemary are all phenomenal.  Tommy our sever was wonderful attentive, helpful and kind. I will definitely be back with friends. Definitely want to try dessert, was way to stuffed this time around.",5.0

Finally, I found such a place in Sweet Chick.The chicken is seasoned to perfection, and the skin is crispy. The rosemary-mushroom waffle is divine and doesn't need a drop of syrup. The blueberry butter that arrives among a trio of butters is superb. This is my go-to meal. I've now developed a chicken-and-waffle problem, and all Williamsburg outings end here. I've taken southerners here, and they have been wowed.Look, this place isn't terribly cheap, the desserts are so-so and the cornbread is more like a stiff pudding.

The food is great but be advised there is ALWAYS a wait . I would get there at least an hour before u decided u wanna eat!,4.0
"YummmmmmmmI had this place book marked for so long! Seen it on the news for best chicken & waffles a few times!Place is small!! Not really a large group spot.  Cool tunes playing,  dim lighting,  large bar,  candels lit making it a very cool ambience. Def a hipster vibe! Tables really close together.....i could here ""a date gone wrong"" clearly at the table next to us....LOL Great bar! Great beer selection!The food::: we started with the bbq pork sliders...swweeet, tangy bbq sauce and a large serving of tender pulled pork on a soft bun.....delish!! They have different combination chicken and waffle dishes, like cordon blue and parmigiana (which came with a parmesean waffle!)....and my choice bacon cheddar waffle with chicken....waffle had lil pieces of bacon and chesse and had a great flavor. The chicken is out of this world....tastes like its soaked in seasoned buttermilk for weeks!....lol Has a little spicy kick, crispy skin, and tender juicy meat!! Dish is served with flavored butter, herb, lemon and berry....all 3 were soooooo good!Had a yummy beer......slyfox pikesland pilsner.....smooth and refreshing! Service was great,  food came out quick, waitress new her stuff and had great recommendations.Cant wait to come back! only 4 stars because the serving is way too small, small pieces of chicken....its not cheap, so why not a little more?",4.0

"Much like searching for Bigfoot or a chupacabra, good chicken-and-waffle meals are hard to find in NY -- one could argue anywhere. Finally, I found such a place in Sweet Chick.The chicken is seasoned to perfection, and the skin is crispy. The rosemary-mushroom waffle is divine and doesn't need a drop of syrup. The blueberry butter that arrives among a trio of butters is superb. This is my go-to meal. I've now developed a chicken-and-waffle problem, and all Williamsburg outings end here. I've taken southerners here, and they have been wowed.Look, this place isn't terribly cheap, the desserts are so-so and the cornbread is more like a stiff pudding. Still, the chicken and waffles are perfection. Just go already.",5.0

"WAFFLES. WAFFLES. WAFFLES EVERYWHERE. Oh my goodness, the joy that was brought to my heart upon arriving here. We had to wait 30min to be seated as it was packed on a Sun, but wow was it worth the wait. I had this amazing bacon cheddar waffle with chicken of course because what's chicken without waffles when doing brunch. And let me say it was not just simply chicken. It was a chicken marinated in buffalo sauce. The picture will say it all. Also had a bomb banana spice cake with ice cream. I mean what a way to finish off my meal. Also, biscuits? No disappointment there. I've been meaning to go back and best believe I will after this review that I finally got around to writing. Its close quarters, but not uncomfortably so, and the atmosphere is just really relaxed. Go, go, GO. As always... Happy eating. -Marie-Madeleine.",5.0
"Had my eyes on two different chicken and waffles joints (Sweet Chick and Pies & Thighs) My girlfriend, Michelle, and I decided on Sweet Chick first only because she's already had Pies & Thighs, and let me tell you, it's been so hard to go to Pies & Thighs after eating at Sweet Chick... I ordered the special that day which was the Crawfish Chicken & Waffles; it was heaven on a piece of fried chicken, there was a sauce that was very creamy, and loads of crawfish on it! Idk when this special will be back but I'll make sure to come by if it does.  They also provide you with 3 different kinds of butter made in house, I believe the flavors are lemon, berry & rosemary... God it was delicious. Michelle ordered the chicken cordon bleu waffles which in my opinion are the best waffles on the regular menu! Loads of flavor, creaminess, and chunks of cubed ham!But believe it or not, what ACTUALLY keeps me coming back to this place isn't the chicken and waffles, it's the Mac & Cheese and I'm so sorry for not having a photo of it, but if you plan on coming here, you gotta get this, it's the type of dish that... If you hated your entrée, and you ordered the Mac and cheese, you'd still leave with a happy tummy. Its made with Gruyere, fontina and white cheddar cheese topped with ritz crackers crust!Long Story short - Chicken & Waffles done with a unique/familiar twist.  Mac & Cheese... best I've ever had.",5.0
This place is the bomb. Best chicken and waffles in life. And the Mac n cheese is unreal. Ya gotta go hereeeeee! Expect a long (but worthy) wait.,5.0
"DEFINITELY GO HERE. If you take anything from this review, it's to order the Mac and Cheese. It's my favorite!  Gruyere, fontina and aged white cheddar make for a delicious cheesy meal. The toasted ritz crackers on top are also a great touch. The shells are soft and are perfect for holding all the cheese. The chicken and waffles are an obvious choice. I've been here a couple times, and they are always solid. My personal favorite is the chicken cordon bleu, which features chunks of ham with the cheese. The buffalo chicken is not too spicy, and the bleu cheese waffle compliments it well. The one thing I don't like? The General. It's supposed to be a play on General Tso chicken and rice meal, popular at Chinese food restaurants. The sauce reminded me of a slightly sweeter soy sauce, and the broccoli and rice flour waffle was just alright. It tasted like the other waffles, so it was nothing special.",5.0

"My friend from Georgia was excited to find out there was a chicken and waffles place nearby so we decided to check it out. We were not disappointed in any way. The ambiance and interior of the place are very quirky, rustic, and charming. You notice this from the moment you open the door and the door handle is a wrench to the different types of tables inside (including picnic benches). The food is great. There are a bunch of different types of chicken and waffles and you can order any combination that you want regardless of how they're paired in the menu.I got the buffalo chicken and blue cheese waffles. The chicken was good. It was spicy but not too spicy so you enjoy every bite. My friend got the Parmesan chicken and waffle and he loved it as well. The only problem I had was the wait time. Out waitress came and we asked for a couple minutes to finish deciding but ended up waiting a lot longer than we needed for her to come back. The food also took a while to come out but I would say it was worth the wait.",4.0
"I been wanting to try this place for a very long time and I was craving for some fried chicken. We started off the Mac and Cheese (gruyere, fontina, aged white cheddar, ritz cracker crust.) It was rich and creamy. That itself could have been a small entree. Next we got the Crawfish Hush Puppies. It was warm and fluffy. It goes pretty well with the remoulade sauce. It gives the hush puppies a nice sweetness to it. For my entree, I got the Sweet Chick Bucket. It comes with 3 pieces of fried chicken, biscuit, and collard slaw. I like the sourness taste of the collard slaw. The biscuit wasn't really warm and fluffy. It also lacked the buttery taste to it. The fried chicken was a total fail for me. The drumstick was nice and juicy. The other 2 pieces were so DRY!!! I mean DRY!!! I was so craving fried chicken. I had such high hopes. It did not satisfy my cravings.",3.0

"After a good 2-ish years on Bedford, Sweet Chick is still slinging some of the finest fried chicken and waffles in the city. My last visit occurred this past Sunday. Super Bowl Sunday. They had a couple of timely specials on the menu; a lobster version of their biscuits and gravy (representing New England) and a coffee rubbed chicken and waffles dish (representing Seattle). While both sounded outstanding, I had to opt for the classic fried chicken and waffles. As always, it hit the spot. Perfectly fried chicken - crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside - accompanied with four quarters of a fluffy Belgian waffle. Can't forget the hot sauce and maple syrup - it's an essential ingredient. If you come here for one thing only, make sure this is it.My brunch date went with the chilaquiles since we're both huge fans of the savory Mexican comfort food item. Sadly, this missed the mark by a wide margin. It was almost a completely emulsified version of something I've only experienced as a crispy fried tortilla dish with beans, eggs, Cojita cheese, and green sauce. To say we were both disappointed is an understatement, but hey - can't win 'em all.Knowing how good 98% of the menu is (I've tried almost all of their pastries and they're to die for as well), one miss would never keep me from returning over and over.

While I've definitely have had better fried chicken in New York and I would caution diners that this is not the place to go if you're looking for the best fried chicken on earth, it's not a bad option. I have a thing for eating both a savoury and sweet for brunch so I order the chicken to go along for the real reason I come to sweet chick: the waffles! The waffles are cooked very well. Golden, with a touch of crispiness, and a soft inner layer. If you're a fruit person, the waffles a la carte with the ricotta and fruit topping is a good choice. If you order the chicken and waffles, they will give you a fun selection of flavoured butters (think berry butter, herb butter, etc.) and syrup. All in all, Sweet Chick keeps me coming back.

No biggie though... the food was worth it.We waited quite some time for our order to arrive, but it was a busy hour so we didn't complain. I ate a chicken and waffle sandwich with a side of salad that had walnuts and some kind of spicy pepper... may have been jalapeños. The chicken tasted very fresh and complimented well with the great, lightly cinnamon tasting waffle. It's not your typical fried chicken from your local fried chicken spot-it's lighter in a way. It was a quarter of a portion, but very filling with the salad. My friend ordered a chicken and waffle dish, which was also tasty.

For beverages, our friends had the Bloody Mary, my boyfriend had the Mimosa, and I had the Bellini. Our friends had the Chicken and Waffles and Smoked Pork Hash. I tried a piece of the chicken and waffles, but didn't really enjoy it too much because the chicken wasn't crispy or moist. It felt cold and dry. As for the waffle, it was pleasant to eat. The Smoked Pork Hash was very hearty and delicious.My boyfriend tried the Eggs Benny and I took a bite out of it too. I really wasn't too thrilled with Sweet Chick's version of the Eggs Benedict because they added shredded smoked chicken along with the biscuit and poached eggs with Hollandaise sauce. The chicken felt very dry once again. It was very different and unique, but I didn't like the taste and didn't feel the flavors were united together.I tried the Shrimp and Grits. I love grits, but Sweet Chick's version of the shrimp and grits wasn't superb. Although it was huge in portion size and will fill you up, I didn't feel it was very unique. The grits was all bell pepper sauce with smoked paprika and I think it was too much and overdone. I was also very thirsty afterwards.Our friends also ordered pastries too. My boyfriend and I didn't try it since we were ally stuffed. Overall, I felt our experience was A-Okay. not excellent or over the top, but not bad or horrible either. Although I was a little uncomfortable here and the food was mediocre, I would still come back and give this Sweet Chick another chance.",3.0

This freaking chicken and waffle sandwich is my favorite thing . I heard Nas is buying into this place.   That's chill.  I saw him perform last night at house of vans.  For some reason I thought eating a few mushrooms before hand was a good idea.  Wrong.   Towards the end of the show my mind began to melt.  I had to take a cab home and couldn't tell where I was.  Luckily Meg calmed me down over the phone.  Shrooms as an adult are scary,5.0

"Been wanting to come to sweet chick for a very long time! Shared the chicken and waffles and mac and cheese with my fellow hungry girlfriend while we were still eyeing the shrimp and grits at the table next us......The chicken was very good with really interesting seasonings and perfectly crispy, the waffles were also delicious since they bring you an assortment of butters. ( the lemon butter was our favorite)As for the mac and cheese. SO creamy and rich. They also make it was huge pasta shells so you get tons of cheesiness in every bite. We loved it because really what's not to love.Sometimes I love Williamsburg for spots like this because people are actually friendly..or maybe I'm just friendly but we also had a great conversation with the people at the table next to us while eating. Well, the tables are pretty much made for eavesdropping anyway.Fun experience but from other reviews I have a feeling some of their other menu items are not as great but I will be coming back for a Bloody Mary ( they looked amazing) and more fried chicken!",4.0

This place every single time has  nothing but exceptional service(Jennyfur) and food. I have a tendency to always try one of the specials.

I can't remember  exact name of dish it did start with a v. But it was delicious. The chicken perfectly charred and still  juicy! What's the secret?  The waffle needed no syrup!  Yes I just said that...it needed no syrup. IT was perfectly paired with the chicken.

"I am what you call a believer--a believer that a merry wedding of sweet and savory is the ultimate and unquestionably perfect union. So when you bestow upon me such an immaculate concoction such as Sweet Chick's chicken and waffle--there is no greater bliss that can be experienced by any man. Their bacon & cheddar Waffle is hands down, the best waffle I've ever had. So good, that I bought a second one to-go, which I later forcibly shoved into my boyfriend's mouth despite his protests that he had just eaten. Their bacon cheddar waffle is moist and fluffy--the most necessary elements in a perfect waffle. Their fried chicken is crispy and succulent--drizzled with their genuine maple syrup, it's enough to make a believer out of any man/woman/reluctant significant others. Wash this merriful union down with one of Sweet Chick's worthy drafts, and if you're still hungry, dig into some of their duck confit sliders--which are tasty, that is--if you aren't tempted to order another waffle.",5.0

"3.5 stars. Add another review to the Chicken and Waffle List. The Waffle was the real MVP here, it was perfectly cooked, crispy on the outside but fluffy on the inside. and combined with the butters and the maple syrup, it was definitely the star of the show. Seriously, I'm not usually one for breakfast foods but I could have repeats of that waffle again and again. Speaking of the butters, they provide you with 3(classic, blueberry, and herb). Surprisingly, the herb one stood out the least to me, while the classic and blueberry were a perfect balance.As for the chicken, I got a drumstick and a breast. When it comes to chicken, you gotta judge it by the crispiness of the skin, and the juiciness of the white meat(hard to pull off well, so that's when you know you've got good chicken). The skin was perfect; good seasoning without being overly greasy or overly salty, and not strong enough to overpower the combination with the syrup, butter, and waffle. However, while the drumstick was still juicy, the breast meat was quite dry and i had to douse it in hot sauce and syrup to make it palatable. Additionally, both pieces of chicken were rather small...i was expecting them to be twice the size.For $16, it came with one waffle(divided into quarters) and two pieces of chicken. Not bad, but coming from the South I've had better.",3.0

"Ate here for the first time today, and it happens to be National Fried Chicken Day!  There was no wait for a table surprisingly.  They had 18 different types of Chicken & Waffle flavor combinations in honor of this special day.  No other menu options were offered though.  All of the chicken and waffle flavors (except Curry and Blackened) are also available in a Vegetarian (seitan/mock meat) option.  Note: There are no vegan or gluten free chicken and waffle options.   Strict vegans and gluten free people should skip this place.I selected the original flavor (Vegetarian) and the Rosemary & Mushroom waffle, which is the type of waffle our waiter recommended.  The fried veggie chicken was good and crunchy on the outside - not oily as I was expecting - and had a little bit of a spongey mock meat texture, but the waffle was excellent, light and fluffy and delicious.  Eaten together with the waffle, it tasted pretty good.   I only ate 1 of the two chicken pieces because it was filling and I wasn't crazy about the texture.  I could see how a lot of vegetarians would love this, but I have had so many other vegetarian chicken and seitan dishes that are way better than this so I would not order this dish again personally.  (Some places that have better seitan or vegetarian chicken dishes include: Champs, Wild Ginger, Mexican Radio, Bliss Grand, Vegetarian Paradise 2 and Buddha Boddai, and all of these places are vegan.)However, the person who brought me here ordered the blackened chicken with grits waffles, along with a non alcoholic ginger drink and they LOVED it. Also, the service was excellent.  So, even though this place is not for me and it is not a place I would intentionally dine at, I will still give this place 4 stars.",4.0
"Sooooooooo soooooo goooooooodI've been here many times and each time I try a different chicken and waffles dish. Each time the combination is delicious and leaves me and my stomach happy. Some of the best chicken and waffles I've ever had. These guys sure do know what they are doing.In addition to their regular menu, they always have some daily specials. Their cocktail names are very creative much like the drinks themselves. I like the Tiger Woods y'all.The play some cool old school hip hop and are usually slammed. So be prepared to wait.  But well worth it.",5.0
"All I can say is that this place left me in a food coma. No lie! I ordered chicken and waffles with a side of mac n cheese. It was more food than I could finish, but I did try.  The mac n cheese was by far the best I have ever had.  It was delicious.  I don't know what type of cheese is used, but it definitely gave it a distinct taste that I absolutely loved.  The waffles were light as air,  and the flavored butter was different.  The chicken literally fell off the bone.  The only downside was the small quarters,  and not so comfortable chairs.  It's more of a rustic setting, but folding chairs really aren't the only option in keeping with that theme,  in my opinion.  Nevertheless,  I forgot what I was sitting on once I started eating.  Bottom line: great food, close to home, and won't break the bank. Win,  win!",4.0
"Oh my goodness do I love this place. A few of my girls went to our gym's new location on 3rd and Wythe (if you're looking for a great bootcamp in Williamsburg, check out Warrior Fitness Bootcamp's new location!!) and we decided to go out to dinner afterwards. This is a place that I have been dying to try after seeing it on a food show, so it was the perfect opportunity. We were a very large party (8 in total), so all of us expected a wait but when we heard an hour and thirty minutes, our hearts sank because we were SO hungry. So we put our names down on the list and ventured out to another restaurant. We ended up going to Sea, which was about a 30 minute wait but to all of our surprise, we waited about 20-25 minutes at Sea and received a text that out table was ready at Sweet Chick. Needless to say we booked it back over there. Man was this a GREAT choice!!The atmosphere is so laid back and the music.was.so.great!! I'm talking 90's & early 2000 hip hop and R&B - the good stuff. We were all dancing in out seats while we ate. Now this was my first fried chicken and waffles experience and I'm so happy I took the waitress' advice and got the fried chicken with the hot honey and the bacon cheddar waffles. MY LIFE IS NOW COMPLETE. I don't know what more to say than the fried chicken was crunchy and moist all at the same time, the waffles were incredibly tasty and fluffy and that spicy honey made my life. Although I have nothing to compare this to, I believe the bar is set very high. If anyone has any suggestions for me to try other good fried chicken and waffles, please message me because I will gladly join the FC & W following.We basically all got fried chicken + waffles but I tried the shrimp and grits the my friend had and it was soooooo good. I am getting that the next time I go. I will definitely come back and I definitely recommend this place for a good night with you favorites. You will not be let down.",5.0
"I am what you call a believer--a believer that a merry wedding of sweet and savory is the ultimate and unquestionably perfect union. So when you bestow upon me such an immaculate concoction such as Sweet Chick's chicken and waffle--there is no greater bliss that can be experienced by any man. Their bacon & cheddar Waffle is hands down, the best waffle I've ever had. So good, that I bought a second one to-go, which I later forcibly shoved into my boyfriend's mouth despite his protests that he had just eaten. Their bacon cheddar waffle is moist and fluffy--the most necessary elements in a perfect waffle. Their fried chicken is crispy and succulent--drizzled with their genuine maple syrup, it's enough to make a believer out of any man/woman/reluctant significant others. Wash this merriful union down with one of Sweet Chick's worthy drafts, and if you're still hungry, dig into some of their duck confit sliders--which are tasty, that is--if you aren't tempted to order another waffle.",5.0
Terrible hostess...seated multiple guests out of order and was very rude when asked about it.,1.0
"Get this I ordered chicken and waffles and got 2 pieces of the most exhausted dried out chicken. Still can't believe they gave me all dark meat at that, shit was so dry it look like chicken jerky, For 17 bucks  lol besides that food was good I switched my friend a wing for a breast. My drink was good as well, Crap dark meat from kfc the nerve!",1.0
"I'll keep simple,There was no wait which I enjoyed BUT there's no reason why food that taste just alright should be so overpriced. The atmosphere was great but our waiter was just a tad bit rude with some remarks when the person I was with asked a few questions. I probably won't go back but obviously this was just my experience.",3.0
"3.5 stars. Add another review to the Chicken and Waffle List. The Waffle was the real MVP here, it was perfectly cooked, crispy on the outside but fluffy on the inside. and combined with the butters and the maple syrup, it was definitely the star of the show. Seriously, I'm not usually one for breakfast foods but I could have repeats of that waffle again and again. Speaking of the butters, they provide you with 3(classic, blueberry, and herb). Surprisingly, the herb one stood out the least to me, while the classic and blueberry were a perfect balance.As for the chicken, I got a drumstick and a breast. When it comes to chicken, you gotta judge it by the crispiness of the skin, and the juiciness of the white meat(hard to pull off well, so that's when you know you've got good chicken). The skin was perfect; good seasoning without being overly greasy or overly salty, and not strong enough to overpower the combination with the syrup, butter, and waffle. However, while the drumstick was still juicy, the breast meat was quite dry and i had to douse it in hot sauce and syrup to make it palatable. Additionally, both pieces of chicken were rather small...i was expecting them to be twice the size.For $16, it came with one waffle(divided into quarters) and two pieces of chicken. Not bad, but coming from the South I've had better.",3.0
Chicken and waffles was great here I ordered the house bacon which was pretty thick and was not so chewy But the meal was overall very filling You get your money's worth out of the delicious food and nice restaurant decor,5.0
"Ate here for the first time today, and it happens to be National Fried Chicken Day!  There was no wait for a table surprisingly.  They had 18 different types of Chicken & Waffle flavor combinations in honor of this special day.  No other menu options were offered though.  All of the chicken and waffle flavors (except Curry and Blackened) are also available in a Vegetarian (seitan/mock meat) option.  Note: There are no vegan or gluten free chicken and waffle options.   Strict vegans and gluten free people should skip this place.I selected the original flavor (Vegetarian) and the Rosemary & Mushroom waffle, which is the type of waffle our waiter recommended.  The fried veggie chicken was good and crunchy on the outside - not oily as I was expecting - and had a little bit of a spongey mock meat texture, but the waffle was excellent, light and fluffy and delicious.  Eaten together with the waffle, it tasted pretty good.   I only ate 1 of the two chicken pieces because it was filling and I wasn't crazy about the texture.  I could see how a lot of vegetarians would love this, but I have had so many other vegetarian chicken and seitan dishes that are way better than this so I would not order this dish again personally.  (Some places that have better seitan or vegetarian chicken dishes include: Champs, Wild Ginger, Mexican Radio, Bliss Grand, Vegetarian Paradise 2 and Buddha Boddai, and all of these places are vegan.)However, the person who brought me here ordered the blackened chicken with grits waffles, along with a non alcoholic ginger drink and they LOVED it. Also, the service was excellent.  So, even though this place is not for me and it is not a place I would intentionally dine at, I will still give this place 4 stars.",4.0
"Sooooooooo soooooo goooooooodI've been here many times and each time I try a different chicken and waffles dish. Each time the combination is delicious and leaves me and my stomach happy. Some of the best chicken and waffles I've ever had. These guys sure do know what they are doing.In addition to their regular menu, they always have some daily specials. Their cocktail names are very creative much like the drinks themselves. I like the Tiger Woods y'all.The play some cool old school hip hop and are usually slammed. So be prepared to wait.  But well worth it.",5.0
"All I can say is that this place left me in a food coma. No lie! I ordered chicken and waffles with a side of mac n cheese. It was more food than I could finish, but I did try.  The mac n cheese was by far the best I have ever had.  It was delicious.  I don't know what type of cheese is used, but it definitely gave it a distinct taste that I absolutely loved.  The waffles were light as air,  and the flavored butter was different.  The chicken literally fell off the bone.  The only downside was the small quarters,  and not so comfortable chairs.  It's more of a rustic setting, but folding chairs really aren't the only option in keeping with that theme,  in my opinion.  Nevertheless,  I forgot what I was sitting on once I started eating.  Bottom line: great food, close to home, and won't break the bank. Win,  win!",4.0

"My recent trip to Williamsburg for a Brooklyn Brunch, we went here. The brunch options are traditional but everything is very well-executed and delicious. Fried chicken and waffles are delicious!",4.0
I've been here a couple of times and both times had the chicken and waffles. The waffle is light and crispy. Chicken is well seasoned and crispy.  I wish I knew how they made them. So many other restaurants the waffle is so thick and heavy. It's a small restaurant so if you come during brunch hours you should expect for there to be a wait. Staff is always friendly. So if you're trekking out to Williamsburg this a good place to drop in.,4.0
"The mac and cheese was the only standout dish on the menu. It was excellent. I ordered the $18 Chick Bucket. The chicken comes with a basic salt and pepper crust, extra pepper that is perfectly crunchy but flavorwise, it's only average.  It comes with a buttermilk biscuit that is a true work of art, however, the side of mashed potatoes is on par with that of KFC. The potatoes were creamy but served at room temperature at best and I'm pretty sure the gravy came out of a can. I do have to give thanks to the hostess Caitlin? who moved us from the table adjacent to the door to the communal seating in the middle of the restaurant. The temperature outside was below freezing and you could feel it all throughout the restaurant. I was wearing three layers and a Carhart jacket which I didn't take off, but the overall experience was enjoyed by the friend that suggested it.",2.0

"Sweet Chick has definitely stepped up their chicken! The first couple of times I visited the chicken had no flavor and was very bland. But after my last 2 visits I was pleasantly surprised. The chicken had flavor and I couldn't help myself but to ask  for more. The biscuits are also amazing!! They give you jam and a few other butters for you try out. My favorite is the lemonish butter. Sweet Chick is pretty small and if you're looking to try it for brunch or on the weekend, get ready for a long wait. For brunch, we waited about half an hour- close to 45 minutes.  The waffles, chicken, biscuits and mac and cheese are great. You will not be disappointed. If you go for dinner- try their Sweet Chick Cocktail. Its delicious!!",4.0
They take your name/number and contact you when your table is ready so the wait isn't too bad for a dinner. The Chicken and Waffles comes with a choice of 4 different waffles. I had the Bacon Cheddar waffle that was fluffy and had a nice texture. The flavored butter that they give you is quite good and a little goes a long way. The syrup is pretty boring but I am not a fan of using a lot of syrup anyway so being a bit lighter works well.The fried chicken had a heavily seasoned hard outer crust but the chicken inside stays very moist. The seasoning is a bit on the sweet side so it works when getting the chicken and waffles but my friends who got the chicken bucket would've preferred something more savory.Overall a good place to get your fried chicken fix.,4.0

Moral, if you can, come during non busy hours.Staff here is great, attentive and make great drinks. They have a nice cocktail list, and of course my favorite Gin and Cucumber.The food:-Chicken and waffles: Waffles were perfect, moist and flavorful and came with three types of butter. One of the better waffles I ever had paired with chicken. The chicken itself was very moist inside and had a nice crisp outside and had a very interesting spice profile, reminiscent  of rosemary to me, very unique taste. -Mac and cheese with bacon was delicious. Cheese was flavorful and smooth and it had nice chunky pieces of bacon for the perfect bite.-Duck sliders: comes with 3. Duck itself was delicious, I would call this a pulled duck by comparison, though i did not love the buns, a bit on the hard side, should have been potato rolls.Overall great place, delicious food and drinks and of course delicious Chicken and Waffles",4.0
"Went to this spot twice once for brunch earlier this year and once last weekend for the in between menu (chicken n waffles only). I must say the food and service both times were on point. I absolutely loved the chicken n waffle platter I ordered on both visits. I tried the mac n cheese plate this time around as an appetizer and it was delicious. My only minor complaint is that the place is small and they do not do reservations so wait for Sunday brunch could be a bit long if you're in a hurry to eat. Gotta come early. Also it is difficult to seat a large group so it's best to come with a crew of 4 or less. I came with a party if 6 my first visit so wait time was about two hours. The food was worth the wait for me.

Not a super slow, I'll take my time and look around kind of process. The biscuits were a little dry, the chicken was good. The waffles were fluffy and the mac and cheese was cheesy enough but could have used a little more seasoning. The shoestring fries were great and the iced tea was decent. I'll give it another go, but I need to be wow'd.",3.0
"Nice spot in Williamsburg in the Bedford area for a fried chicken meal. Seats are mostly picnic style with a couple of tables but you'll be squeezed together with other patrons. I'll have to say the waffles to me were the stand out. The spicey peacan waffle i couldn't get enough of. Crispy, soft and scrumptuous. Fried chicken i've had better which to me was your standard fare. Skip the corn bread as it was crumbly and the brussel sprouts came out too oily for us. The almonds in the sprouts though was a nice touch. Biscuits were a plus too as it was soft and buttery.",3.0

"The wait is ridiculous and personally not worth it for some chicken and waffles. We waited 2 hours to be seated for a party of 2, and after putting our name and number down so that they could call us when the table is ready they ""forgot"". When we finally were seated the service was pretty good, our waiter was pretty attentive and gave us the time and space we needed. The chicken and waffles were good, but definitely not the best I've ever had. It comes with some pretty tasty butters (blueberry, lemon, basil something) which took the waffles up a few levels so that was good. We had the peach sweet tea as our drink (boozy version) which was delicious.  Overall it was good, however I refuse to wait 2 hours at this spot.",3.0

"I love this spot. I'm from Seattle some anything that looks ""hipster"", organic, cage free chicken/ meat makes me scream. Anyways we waited about an hour for 14 people party and they were sooo amazing. Service was on point. Everyone loved the food and it was completely reasonable. It was someone's birthday party and we didn't have reservations and made her day. It was a bunch of people meeting for the first time and they really made the experience oh sooo amazing.I got the traditional chicken and waffles with syrup on the side. We all ordered tasty beverages to go along.Honestly it was a great way to spend out Saturday evening.THE second time (because I had to come back) was even more memorable. I was on a date. I should mention that, but really I don't know IF I called it a date or he did. ANYWAYS....We were fatty pants. We had the mac & cheese (in between menu), because we wanted to try it. The flavors were perfect and defiantly a much need to order when YOU go. Then, I got the sliders on the appetizer menu and the cheese sauce on top of the chicken was OUT OF THIS WORD. I still think about it time to time. I need to go back. If you're in the area, please STOP BY...",5.0
"I had the waffle & chicken with Mac and cheese and  cornbread . The fried chicken was really good. The waffle were ok, it came with three different butter which my boyfriend loved.

"I don't want to compare, but Sweet Chick does right by fried chicken. Had the fried chicken sandwich and the Kale b.l.t. No complaints at all. Everything came out at a timely manner and all the employees were super friendly and attentive. The fried chicken sandwich was sweet, savory, and a good amount of spicy that I very much enjoyed. Loved loved the extra crispy thick cut pieces of bacon on the kale salad. For me that was the real icing on this fat kid's cake haha. Food tastes great. Will be coming back here for more deliciousness!",5.0
"Went with a friend, on her recommendation.  I was very pleasantly surprised with my meal - plain chicken and waffles with a side of scrambled eggs with cheese.  Ridiculously delicious and great service.  I had the boozy lemonade, too - delightful.  It looks like it's always packed and we had a bit of a wait - maybe twenty minutes, max - but shorter than the estimate.  It's worth the wait, just stick around.",5.0
"DIdn't really love being stared at by a waitress before being seated at the communal table, but eventually we were seated. Only to wait for menus and then wait again for our order to be taken. Yes, that is the normal progression when one goes to a food establishment, but this should be a speedy process, an attentive one, a proactive one. Not a super slow, I'll take my time and look around kind of process. The biscuits were a little dry, the chicken was good. The waffles were fluffy and the mac and cheese was cheesy enough but could have used a little more seasoning. The shoestring fries were great and the iced tea was decent. I'll give it another go, but I need to be wow'd.",3.0
"Nice spot in Williamsburg in the Bedford area for a fried chicken meal. Seats are mostly picnic style with a couple of tables but you'll be squeezed together with other patrons. I'll have to say the waffles to me were the stand out. The spicey peacan waffle i couldn't get enough of. Crispy, soft and scrumptuous. Fried chicken i've had better which to me was your standard fare. Skip the corn bread as it was crumbly and the brussel sprouts came out too oily for us. The almonds in the sprouts though was a nice touch. Biscuits were a plus too as it was soft and buttery.",3.0
"Oh my god loved it. Went here for brunch and we split fried chicken and waffles and the shrimp and grits. The grits were the star. Flavorful, tasty and warm they were perfect.

"4 stars because it's the best mac and cheese I've ever had and waffles were very good. We ordered the chicken and waffles and mac and cheese. I'm not a fried chicken person but I did hear it was good so I was hoping it'd convert me. It didn't. Chicken had a really thick crisp to it so it felt like a lot of work to chew through. The skin did however taste pretty good with syrup drizzled all over it. So that was new for me. Praise the lord for soul food. I tried both the rosemary and mushroom waffle and spiced pecan waffles. Out of the two, I personally liked the rosemary and mushroom because it made the waffle taste more like a lunch item as opposed to breakfast. The butters are awesome when you pair them with the waffle. There was regular, herbs and raspberry butters. My favorite was the herbs because it was out of the ordinary. The mac and cheese however was the highlight. Rather than using tiny macaroni, they use large pasta shells. This allows each piece to scoop and soak up more cheese. That means more cheese per bite! I got this to share but it would have been enough for a meal for one person. I recommend getting it even if you don't like it cause its that good! I would definitely come back again for the mac and cheese!I went at 5pm on a Monday. It was empty. During that time, they have an extremely limited menu.

"My home girl suggested this place and said the chicken and waffles were worth the visit. We came here via whip and traffic wasn't too bad but the lack of parking resulted in me making a series of circles around the area. We got so lucky and found parking on Bedford and N6. The wait was forty minutes and was told we can receive a text when our table was ready. We went to another bar in the meantime and within thirty minutes received a text that our table was ready. So when we were seated, it was definitely a lack of privacy since we were sitting next to a couple and we looked like a group hanging out but we totally didn't know each other. The dining area is definitely tight and small but we had no choice. We ordered an assortment of items. The mac and cheese and crabcakes were a plus-plus. The cornbread was...not my cup of tea. They added some spices to it but the flavor was all over the place. I also didn't like the chicken but the waffles were fluffy. My friend was surprised that I didn't like it but it didn't taste good to me, at all. The drinks were delicious; try Turks and Caicos, you will get a nice buzz. The blend was unique. Despite the busy atmosphere, our food and drinks came with a timely fashion so service was good. But I wasn't too hyped about the place, it seemed very ""regular"" to me. I'm happy I got to score a visit but I don't see myself coming back here.",3.0
"We walked in around 10:30AM on the Sunday before Labor Day and were seated right away (this was to our surprise - the place was packed).

The iced coffee was also to die for.My husband had the Eggs Bennie (pretty good) and I had the chicken and waffles (out of this world!). We also had some sort of scone and it was delicious.Our waitress was a little short with us (no smiles) at first (eh, it was early), but totally turned around when the kitchen took forever on our food (people who sat down way after us got their food before us). And, she over compensated for the slowness and comped the scone and my iced coffee refill.Did this place fulfill A) my craving for some excellent chicken and waffles and B) my yearning to experience brunch in Brooklyn? Yes, precisely.",4.0
"Cute, cozy, perfect place to be on a cold Sunday night.Food: The Mac & Cheese starter was fabulous - very rich and flavorful. The Chicken & Waffles were just good. Wasn't a huge fan of the chicken - the meat was good but the skin/coating, usually my favorite part, was too hard and shell-like, not crispy or easy to bite into. I really enjoyed the flavored butters that came on the side. Décor/Vibes: Cute, chill and hipster-y, long communal table in center, candles, mason jar glasses, old school hip hop musicService: Took quite a while to place our orders and close our check at the end but our server was friendly!Fun place for a laid-back group meal.",3.0

I always ask for hot sauce! The waffles come with 3 types of butters. It's a lot of food. I always feel like I'm not going to be able to finish... but then I always manage ;) I thoroughly enjoy the throwback hip hop and r&b, and TIP: bar seating is first come, first serve if you want to by-pass the wait for a table.",4.0
I ordered BBQ chicken with waffles. It tasted like spicy chicken wings in average bar. Part of my chicken was still cold. Waffles were too soft. Not very good experience.,1.0
"My home girl suggested this place and said the chicken and waffles were worth the visit. We came here via whip and traffic wasn't too bad but the lack of parking resulted in me making a series of circles around the area. We got so lucky and found parking on Bedford and N6. The wait was forty minutes and was told we can receive a text when our table was ready. We went to another bar in the meantime and within thirty minutes received a text that our table was ready. So when we were seated, it was definitely a lack of privacy since we were sitting next to a couple and we looked like a group hanging out but we totally didn't know each other. The dining area is definitely tight and small but we had no choice. We ordered an assortment of items. The mac and cheese and crabcakes were a plus-plus. The cornbread was...not my cup of tea. They added some spices to it but the flavor was all over the place. I also didn't like the chicken but the waffles were fluffy. My friend was surprised that I didn't like it but it didn't taste good to me, at all. The drinks were delicious; try Turks and Caicos, you will get a nice buzz. The blend was unique. Despite the busy atmosphere, our food and drinks came with a timely fashion so service was good. But I wasn't too hyped about the place, it seemed very ""regular"" to me. I'm happy I got to score a visit but I don't see myself coming back here.",3.0
"We walked in around 10:30AM on the Sunday before Labor Day and were seated right away (this was to our surprise - the place was packed). I ordered a mimosa (not worth the $9), my husband ordered a bloody mary with bourbon (worth EVERY penny). The iced coffee was also to die for.My husband had the Eggs Bennie (pretty good) and I had the chicken and waffles (out of this world!). We also had some sort of scone and it was delicious.Our waitress was a little short with us (no smiles) at first (eh, it was early), but totally turned around when the kitchen took forever on our food (people who sat down way after us got their food before us). And, she over compensated for the slowness and comped the scone and my iced coffee refill.Did this place fulfill A) my craving for some excellent chicken and waffles and B) my yearning to experience brunch in Brooklyn? Yes, precisely.",4.0
"Cute, cozy, perfect place to be on a cold Sunday night.Food: The Mac & Cheese starter was fabulous - very rich and flavorful. The Chicken & Waffles were just good. Wasn't a huge fan of the chicken - the meat was good but the skin/coating, usually my favorite part, was too hard and shell-like, not crispy or easy to bite into. I really enjoyed the flavored butters that came on the side. Décor/Vibes: Cute, chill and hipster-y, long communal table in center, candles, mason jar glasses, old school hip hop musicService: Took quite a while to place our orders and close our check at the end but our server was friendly!Fun place for a laid-back group meal.",3.0
"Ate here on a Saturday, I wish we could have made reservations because the wait was over an hour--but my party was late so it wasn't a deal breaker. I ordered the chicken and waffles..the Waffle was great and I wished I simply ordered just the waffle without the chicken. The Chicken was very greasy and left much to be desired by way of taste. I also ordered a Boozy Ice Tea and it was decent. The location is very small. I don't regret the experience, but I don't think I'll go again.",3.0
The waffles are the perfect temperature and very soft!The chicken is perfection - crispy skin and moist on the inside.I went with the classic chicken and waffles and I couldn't be more happier with it.I highly recommend you get the honey as well to add on.My entire dinner party got a different kind of chicken and waffles.  The chicken parm and the buffalo ones looked.....delish.Definitely a good winter spot to go to when its sweater season.,5.0
"Eggs benedict worshippers, look no further! The Eggs Benny was one of the best brunch meals I've ever had. Perfect seasoning and flavor! The biscuits that the eggs benedict laid on were also delectable and rounded out the meal. My friends ordered the signature Chicken & Waffles, which was much to their delight as well.Somewhat long wait but forgiven because it's a small spot.. definitely worth it!",4.0
"Original chicken & waffles... My taste buds died and went to heaven. Mac and cheese on the side... Praise the lordt. There's really not much else I can say.I mean we were seated by the window. It was around 7pm in early October. There's these candles in Mason jars, there's wood all over the place, the windows are almost floor to ceiling so you feel like you're seated outside. The vibe was just awesome.",5.0
"So, my cousin and brother are here from the west coast and we decided to try someplace new to eat. We walk in on a Friday afternoon, around 3:00pm, and it's a good crowd for it being the middle of the day. We get seated immediately, and look at the menus...They need a disclaimer on their website saying that they don't serve the full drink menu all day. Anyway, we finally decide to order. We get chicken and waffles, a chicken and waffle sandwich, and a side of gravy. All of the food was solid, but the gravy was the best part to all three of us. Next time, I'm definitely getting biscuits and gravy. Our bill was what you would expect for this neighborhood.",4.0

"Finally went last night with my boyfriend and it was one of those meals where you eat and feel really happy inside. They did a different take on Chinese take out and elevated it to another level with ""The General,"" which is General Tso chicken with broccoli waffles. I'm all about innovation and mashups so it automatically won me over and of course, so did the taste. It doesn't have the usual General Tso flavor, but it is fried and then doused in this sweet sauce. You also get three different types of butter to eat with your waffles: herb, lemon and berry. I liked herb the most! Even the regular flavor was really tasty! And the waffle combos are always interesting. We also ended with shishito peppers which wasn't the best idea. Should've gotten some veggies with the chicken instead! They do, however, give you a generous portion of those peppers which, layered enough, turned out pretty spicy haha..They are not a regular menu item though. There's a lot of things I like about this place: the Edison light bulbs, the ambiance, the music, the FOOD, the menu selection!Definitely come here to try a different combinations of savory fluffy waffles and their unique specials like chicken parm and waffles!! Curious about the mac and cheese and will probably check it out next time :).",5.0
"So my friends and I have never been to a brunch together so we decided why not go to Sweet Chick for our first experience. One of my friends reached there first and they told her the wait was 45mins to and hour. By the time the rest of the group reached it was 30mins after that so we waited about 15-20mins to get seated. We had to stand outside because there is no waiting area unless you wanted to be in the waiters way and have your tush in someone's face (Luckily it wasn't that cold and all the snow was melting). My friends and I decided that we were tired of waiting outside and stood by the entrance where we were constantly hearing ""excuse me"" because we were standing in front of someone's table and the waiter kept coming back and forth. The hostess at the door noticed how impatient we were waiting and offered us these muffins that helped calm us down a bit. Not to mention that it was a Sunday and they had the old school hip hop and r&b playing which took my mind off my empty stomach. Right before we were seated I noticed that everyone was eating chicken and waffles so I thought it must be good and ordered exactly that with a side of organic eggs and a mimosa. It was AMAZING!! The chicken was juicy and tender and the waffles were so soft and sweet. The eggs were just right and the mimosas were better than most. Our waitress was super attentive and friendly. This is a place I will definitely recommend for some good chicken and waffles. Great for a few friends but not a large party of 20.",3.0
"If you've forgotten why you hate ""Brooklyn,"" this may be the reminder you need. My visit was probably beyond repair the moment I was ordered to sit at the bar instead of one of the many empty tables.The tiny two-piece poultry component in the chicken and waffles wasn't going to win me back. Influences include frozen Banquet chicken. While I see a nice-looking wing in a photo here, the pieces I received could be categorized as ""other.""The cherry waffles were actually good, as were the flavored butters.

I tried some of the blueberry pancakes and wished I ordered that instead. The only thing that the kids were upset about was about their drinks.

Been to sweet chick twice so far! Both times for brunch. The first time was about a year and a half ago..and back then I thought their Fried chickens and waffle was just okay.

Juicy on the inside and crispy on the skin. Exactly what I was looking for. Along with their own herb and marination it was beyond good! I've provably been to at least 20-30 fried chicken places in ny or out of state to fulfill my obsession of fried chicken. Here at sweet chick I def recommend it. I have yet to try their dinner menu tho! I have friends that went and say that the dinner menu has more selections of fried chicken and is way better than brunch.

"I was craving chicken and waffles and this place came up and it's been highly recommended by friends. Very happy I came here! The service is great and the food is to die for! Get the Mac and cheese as an appetizer and of course their famous chicken and waffles. They have a large menu and for the vegetarians they have something for you as well ;) I highly recommend this place for waffle and chicken lovers, they also have amazing cocktails at reasonable prices. The dessert menu was also amazing, they have coconut rum creme brûlée!! Come here hungry and you'll leave beyond satisfied.",5.0
"Cool, trendy... I had the classic chicken and waffle. Could not go wrong with that! Love the atmosphere, if you go on the weekends you might find yourself waiting a lengthy amount of time but it's definitely worth the wait! Williamsburg definitely the place to be, if you find yourself over here definitely should stop by!",4.0
"Unbeknownst to me, I stumbled into one of Brooklyn's best fried chicken joints. I would avoid the ""hot honey"" add-on. It's not so much hot but more so a deluge of pure sugary comatose. The mac 'n' cheese is so-so, although I like that they use pasta shells instead of the conventional elbow pasta.",4.0
Great take on the traditional chicken and waffle. Great rustic decor and pleasant waitstaff. Reminds me of a neighborhood gem from a small town in the Midwest,4.0
Definitely worthy of all the calories I gained in one meal! My server was very attentive so that was a plus to my experience :) shrimp grits is my favorite and recommend it... Very exotic taste.,4.0
This is definitely my fav spot! The chicken is amazing and the waffles are perfect! Staff is also attentive and the wait wasn't bad at all considering it was a bit packed. The corn bread is a must!,5.0
Looking for overprice fried chicken and waffles this is definitely a place for you restaurant was very small you were literally sitting on top of each other clients that were waiting for a table was literally standing over you service was good prices was outrageous just for fried chicken waffles,2.0
"Their vegetarian fried chicken is absolutely delicious (moist, crispy on the outside and tasty). I kept on asking my boyfriend to try my ""chicken"" and make sure it wasn't real chicken. The waffle is also delicious. Overall I can say it was an amazing experience. Drinks and service were also great.",5.0
"Went to get Chicken and Waffles this time, first time I was here with a friend, we just got desserts. Desserts are very very filling and so sweet, it's hard to finish one plate alone. Both of us struggled to finish the desserts actually, so there's that.We got the Rosemary and herb & bacon and i forgot what else for chicken and waffles.I liked the rosemary one better, it was a good blend of herbs within the waffles. They were not that bad either, a bit fluffiness. The chicken was okay, wasn't over fried to the point where it was dry. The bacon waffles had huge chunks of bacon in it, so that was a plus.",3.0
BEST CHICKEN N WAFFLES hands down!! I came here and yes there is a wait but it wasn't too long and it is sooooo worth it! They also have 3 hand made butters and it just added that extra flavor. Chicken was Sooo juicy and had just the right amount of spices. Great for brunch with friends or a cute brunch date.,5.0
We came for Sunday brunch. The service was great! But the food was average. Good but not worth a second visit. I was most surprised about the mediocre coffee. Expected more robust flavor. The music was on the loud side for a Sunday morning which made it challenging for conversation.,3.0
"This place is amazing! I wanted to order everything from the menu but went with the Bacon Mac And Cheese that was out of this world. And chicken and waffles was just as amazing. Cons are that it is very pricey what do you expect from the neighborhood, 4$ for a can of welchs soda!! Four flipping dollars!! For a can of soda that's 75cents in the store!!",4.0
"My brother raved about their fried chicken, so I came here with high expectations. We ordered chicken and waffles, their special cornbread of the day -- sage cheddar, and a bucket of fried chicken. The chicken and waffles were great, the chicken was moist and the bacon cheddar waffles were delicious as well. Sadly, everything else was so-so or subpar compared to many other restaurants that make fried chicken. My bucket consisted of three, very dry pieces of fried chicken, and a sizable biscuit that was lukewarm. Two pieces of breast, though one of the pieces looked like a round piece of deep fried I'm-not-sure-what (so I can't say for sure those were really two pieces of breast). The third piece was a wing that was moderately moist and I was hungry so I ate it. I've been to lots and lots of places that specialize in fried chicken but this was just so, so disappointing. Oh, and the grape drank... don't get it. It tastes like cough syrup (maybe I should've known better and not order any drink that contains welch's grape juice but I had high hopes for this place when I walked in).",2.0

"Chicken and waffles!!!! Maybe my favorite food ever so I am bias. This is a classic chicken and waffels, they give you three butter spreads the lemon one is delicious. We also got a side of mac and cheese which was nice and creamy with bread crumbs on top, nom nom. My friend and I split the waffles and the side and that was plenty of food for the two of us.

"This place is Southern comfort food with a hipster twist! Came here with a group of friends and we ordered a bunch of items and ate family style:-Duck sliders-Fried chicken basket-Cordon bleu chicken & waffles-Fried brussel sprouts-Bacon cheddar cornbread-Kale BLT salad-Collard and carrot slawPoint blank everything was delicious! The duck sliders were flavorful and juicy- the perfect starter to set the tone for the rest of the meal. The fried chicken was tasty/crispy along with the buttery biscuit that came with it. The cordon bleu sauce was additional perfection! It wasn't too heavy or creamy and didn't overpower the chicken. The waffles came with 3 different butters: honey, blueberry, and herb. The honey had the right amount of sweetness and was the perfect complement in my opinion.My favorites of the meal were the cornbread and the kale & bacon salad, just a burst of delicious flavor in every bite. The bacon was thick cut and succulent. The fried brussels sprouts were ok/my least favorite (I'm not a fan of the vegetable itself but it just tasted like fried oil) and the collard and carrot slaw was interestingly delicious! Very unique flavor.The dining area is comprised of benches and long tables. And like most places in Williamsburg, it's mason jar central! A very intimate and chill vibe along with good music makes for a great place to chat over delicious food with great company!",4.0
This place was amazing and we can't wait to go back. There can often be a lengthy wait but the fact that they call you to let you know your table is just about ready is genius. I had the classic waffle and their Kale BLT Salad -- both were excellent!!! I'd have a hard time trying something different next time. We wanted to try the hushpuppies but they were sold out. A friend who dined w/ us had the General Tso Chicken and Broccoli Waffle and I tried it and couldn't believe how good both items were. We will definitely visit again!,5.0
"Delicious Fried Chicken and Waffles- although I think that their waffles really outshine their fried chicken- totally delicious nonetheless.  I got the classic flavored waffles and their waffles are sweet, fluffy, chewy, moist and absolutely delicious. Remember to try all the yummy butters they offer too (lemon, rosemary, blueberry)! Slathering on the maple syrup and hot sauce really enhances the flavors.  Cute rustic décor with benches and mason jars.  Would love to come back here for brunch ;)",5.0

"This place was very good if you are looking for this type of place and atmosphere. Their ""thing"" seemed to me to fried chicken. It is a small place with a few big tables in the center and some smaller ones around it. We had a party of five, so I was basically sitting with another couple on my left at the same table. That is OK because it is Brooklyn and everything is tight. Two of us had the bucket of chicken including me. It came with three big pieces of very good fried chicken, a biscuit and a side of collard green coleslaw. All were excellent. One person had fried chicken and waffles. I tried the waffles. They were also very good. Another had duck  and dried cheery waffles. I would recommend that as well. Overall good food and a good time. Go if you like fried chicken.",4.0

"First time here. My boyfriend and I walked from the house about 2.5 miles straight down Bedford Ave. To get there. As soon as we walked in it was packed. Small spot but not unusual for a store front business area off Bedford Ave. We immediately saw the tables full and notice to seats at the bar. We are no strangers to sitting at the bar to be served so easy first choice !                                                                                              The food and drinks on point, but you knew that! The customer service was awesome too. Attentive staff and just pleasant overall. I had the general chicken with broccoli waffles. Freshly made so I was impressed. The tso sauce wasn't as sweet as I expected but the syrup for the waffles took care of that! Those butters were amazing (blue berry, lemon honey and rosemary) gave me some ideas to blend my rosemary and butter at home for like I rice dish or something. My boyfriend had the fried chicken with spicy pecan waffles and that lemon honey butter with it brought out the flavors even more so. We had some great liquor drinks I the Sunglasses and Advil which I can see maybe after two of those you might need to wear those sunglasses and take 2 maybe 3 advils. My boyfriend had the Tiger Woods y'all drink and it was strong for me.  Ok about those black and white sweet chick socks? I saw them on the wall I'm a cyclist and I cycle all around the US and I know those socks would've brought some attention when I ride BUT y'all didn't have any and wouldn't even sell me the pair pin to the wall and if you did I offered to buy both pairs and just not one pair. But your very nice staff said he couldn't but was hoping to have some in stock in a couple of weeks. He did warn me to call first to check before coming in I even asked if there was a online store and just my luck no internet store either. Hope you get some in soon. I'd really like a pair (or two)!",4.0
"After a red-eye flight to NY and getting lost on the subway for two hours, this place definitely hit the spot for a tired, ravenous traveler.

Very cool vibe. We sat at the bar - I loved watching the bartender do his thing - every movement was perfectly timed, everything was under control, and every customer was taken care of (he noticed us wondering about the butters and he immediately came over and told us about them). What a pro. Food - this was my first meal in NY and boy did it amaze me. My friend got the chicken and waffles with three types of butter (blueberry, lemon, and herbs) and I got the black-bean cake and egg scramble. Holy crap how do they make black beans taste so good?

Came here on a Friday night around 10:00 and was seated immediately. Ordered the crawfish hush puppies which were ok but lacked crawfish flavor but the sauces it came with were good.

Visited this place for the first time with some friends.  They've got a really nice spin on the Traditional Chicken and Waffles.  It was a late Saturday night and it wasn't too crowded.  They've got a real friendly and attentive staff.  Narrowed it down to the Fried Chicken Parmesan and General Tso's.  I ended up going with the General Tso's Chicken and Waffles which was a nice change to the traditional chicken & waffles I'm used to.  The chicken was prepared in your usual Generals Tso's sauce and crispy.  There was broccoli in the Waffles which was a nice twist.  Overall great experience and definitely recommend this place if you're looking to try out some new variations to the usual Chicken & Waffles.,5.0

"Did you know that if you go to Sweet Chick for their weekday brunch (11am - 4pm) and get the signature fried chicken and waffles, you get a free beer with that? I'm not talking about some stale, Miller Lite draft bullshit. I'm talking about a glass of good beer. Like Mother's Milk Stout. You're welcome.Other Reasons to Love Sweet Chick:  1. That fried chicken is superb. As is the waffle, and the multiple butters served with.2. The shrimp and grits is ridiculously rich and tasty (only available on the weekends.)3. They have vegetarian 'chicken' for your vegetarian 'friends.'4. The coffee is excellent.5. The owners are awesome guys.That's plenty, especially since good (free) beer and good fried chicken and waffles on a weekday is all the reason you need to get over there.",5.0
"Ordered their bacon salad as a light lunch and it turned out really good. The mixed greens were not  smothered in dressing and the salad featured nice big juicy chucks of bacon.

In fact,  I just witnessed her chasing down a customer who left their iPhone on the table. Can't wait to sample more of their dishes.",5.0

"Sweet Chick has some amazing chicken and waffles, on top of drinks and a really well balanced menu. As Queenie and I said, 609 Yelp reviews could not be wrong - total five star level meal. The wait on a Monday night at 8 was 10 minutes, and fairly accurate.Holly was our super cheerful staff person, who enthusiastically went through the night's specials and knew the menu inside out. She had great timing all evening, was a seamless multi-tasker, and was pleasant. (But there was a mishap where we didn't get a plate of brussel sprouts we ordered, but she was so super sorry and hopped to it right away that I forgave her instantly. Her instant ""oh no"" reaction makes me think that this doesn't happen often to her.)Attention to detail is clutch here. The menu is hand drawn, the chalkboard wall doodles out the specials, and the drinks are prettily garnished, even for being served in mason jars. (Are mason jars ironic yet? No? Okay.) Every dish has its own custom sauce/syrup/butter to complement that one dish. I loved their varied and unique menu. From the SIX different kinds of waffles to go with the chicken, to short ribs, to duck, to crawfish hush puppies, I wanted to try EVERYTHING. They also have vegetarian friendly options.Perry and I ordered the chicken and spiced pecan waffle and the kale BLT salad to share. The rest of the menu will wait for another time. The chicken was moist, flavorful, and tender. The breading was crispy and well seasoned and has a spicy kick to it embedded in the crumbs. By itself, the chicken was spectacular. Then there's the various butters and syrups and hot sauce that just add so many fun combinations. The waffle was amazingly fluffy and light, scented with cinnamon and nutmeg, and flecked with large pecan halves. I wish that they chopped the pecans and gave me more of them in the batter to oomph the nuttiness. The kale salad was good, but was a mixed greens with arugula, so they must have run out of kale and didn't say anything to us. We rolled with it, its vegetables. It had a creamy dressing and big thick, half slices of bacon on top and cherry tomatoes. It didn't wow us, but it did come after the chicken. Ambiance and neighborhood is full on, distressed wood, specialty beer in a mason jar, midriff baring hipster. The place is more table and bench rather than chairs, so try not to come in a bandage dress because you're just not going to be able to sit comfortably. Communal tables are a thing, so be prepared to share your gossip with your twelve closest elbow bumpers. Recommend for the food and drinks. Service may be bumpy if you're with picky people.",4.0

I'm not really a vegetarian - I just hate chicken.  But at Sweet Chick I can have the best of both worlds - fried vegetarian chicken on a waffle.  Holy crap was that good.  Still thinking about it.

"I had seen the owner/chef featured on CBS morning show , so I had to try the food.The waffles were exceptional. I had gotten the classic waffle and fried chicken . The waffle was sweet, delicious , melt in your mouth good and the chicken was a golden brown and perfectly season.  The food was nothing short of awesome .  Waffles are served with 3 types of butter to use .Butter options were never explained when server bought out the food. herb butter, sweet honey lemon butter and a berry butter. (I had to ask for regular butter )My husband had gotten the hot watermelon fried chicken which was a featured special. He said it did not any hot spicy taste to the chicken. So that was just ok.Now for the outline of the visitPros- Fast service, excellent food, variety of choicesCons-  No refills on ice tea, ( who doesn't refill ice tea ) tight quarters , butter options weren't explainedI can't wait to come back to this place. #bravo",4.0

"First time having chicken and waffles! Upon my entrance to the little restaurant, I was greeted by a very kind and enthusiastic waiter in which appears to be the only waiter there. Me and Rob got a window seat. When I say window, I mean literally in front of this big window with no windows on them. The breeze was great, but you'll get on the pass byers stare at not you, but the amazing chicken and waffles  that one could probably smell from quite afar. The chicken was some of the best fried chicken I've ever heard. It had just the right crisp and the meat was very tender and juicy on the inside. I also like that you're able to choose from a selection of waffles, including one with bacon. Alongside with that, we also ordered the Mac n' Cheese, which had to be one of the most astounding Mac n' Cheese that I have ever had in my life time. It was macaroni shells with a rich creamy cheesy sauce, topped with breadcrumbs..absolutely brilliant, I could eat the whole plate. I also like that they have a little bar there, and sell various drinks. We tried the Bloody Mary, interesting as it sounds, but we were surprised to find out that it taste like a spicy tomato v8, with cayenne. Spice was definitely a big factor, I was not a big fan of it because the flavors were just too overwhelming. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone!",5.0

"WOW. This place has some of the worst customer service/employees I've ever dealt with in a restaurant. I placed a large lunch order for my entire department at my company, and they messed it up. This is really not a big deal, it was a large order, frankly I deal with this happening all the time. What the problem is, is that I called to alert them that there was a mistake, and at first he said he could refund me since they wouldn't deliver a replacement. So I called back a few minutes later after consulting my bosses, and the guy working there literally argued with me for 10 minutes about how he talked to his bosses and they actually ""decided"" that it was my mistake and that they just prepared what I told them to, but I not only had the list in writing, but also just got off the phone with my bosses minutes before ordering to double check the order. I knew what I wanted, and I know what I ordered. Honestly I felt insulted that this dude was trying to tell me that I was wrong because the kitchen receipt was wrong...a receipt that he rung up. Seriously, just own up to your mistake. I don't really even know what the point of arguing about it was since he refunded me anyways, though hesitantly. All of this AFTER he gave me the bags and told me to have a nice day, even though I hadn't paid. I could have walked out without paying, but I didn't. I feel like that should have counted for something that I was honest, but apparently not.

"The location is very tight on space and the wait can be extremely long at times, but in my opinion it is worth it. The staff makes up for the space and wait with their amazingly bubbly personalities.The chicken is well seasoned and one of the best fried chicken I have had.

"Got lucky when my bf and I came at 1:00 on a Saturday and managed to get a table in 5 mins. Got a Bloody Mary while waiting at the bar because everyone else seemed to have one. Hearty, a touch spicy, with an amazing piece of bacon in it = a yummy start. My bf and I both just got the chicken n waffles dish... like why would I get anything else my first time here? The waffles were so fluffy but not dense at all. With a tiny bit of raspberry butter and syrup, omg drool. I got 2 big pieces of chicken. The breading is serious: super thick and crunchy. The chicken itself is so juicy. It was def marinated in some kind of spice that I couldn't put my finger on. By the second piece, I was honestly a little tired of it and wished the chicken was just plain. But that's probably just me, because my bf seemed to love it. In any case, I'm not complaining. Somehow I walked out feeling full and satisfied but not disgusting as I would've expected. Great chicken, delicious waffles; would definitely come again.",5.0
They hostess would not allow us entry with a SERVICE animal. Manager was brought out and said the same thing. I pointed out that their policy was illegal. But he still refused us entry.

"We ordered 4 dishes. Eggs Benny, Chicken and Waffles, Smoked Pork Hash and Pancakes with Blueberry compote. We arrived at 11am sharp and saw a bunch of people walking in already and they just opened! luckily we got a seat for 3 by the front window. The decor is pretty and comfortable. Chicken and waffles were spot on! I can actually say they were better than pies & thighs and pies and thighs was my fav chicken and waffles restaurant. Eggs Benny was cold. I guess they waited to serve everything when all the food was done but they could've put the dish on a hot plate to keep it warm. This meal was alright. Buttermilk Pancakes with blueberry compote wasn't anything special. Pancakes could be softer and moist. The butter they served on the other hand was good. Lemon, Herb & Raspberry? 3 different kinda of butters. Raspberry was the favorite out of all 3. Smoked pork hash had a citric/sour taste. Definitely didn't like it and had to pack it to go instead of having the restaurant throwing it out. My mom eats anything so I packed it for her. Will come back for the chicken and waffles, fresh pressed Oj and the French pressed coffee!",4.0
"The service at the bar is exceptional. No waiting and you are able to get the best drink ever.  May I humbly recommend the Bloody Mary with the slab of bacon and the hot pepper or the Boozy Peach Tea. When you finally do eat, if you have the shrimp and grits you will experience nirvana.  The creamy grits and the rich sauce with the amazingly succulent shrimp make this the best meal in Williamsburg. I liked the biscuits and sausage gravy but not as much as the grits.  Very amazing brunch spot.",5.0

GREAT I honestly had no idea what to expect. My mister and I showed up around 11:15 and handed a menu and a cozy little spot toward the back instantly. Although it was a great fit for the time of day in ratio to the amount of people there - I can tell this is a tight fit later on in the day/night. I started off with a peach tea which was absolutely refreshing and amazing. We had the biscuits and jam and chicken and waffles - the food came out in less than 15 minutes which shocked me but it was delicious and fresh. hot sauce was a great accompaniment to the crispy seasoned chicken and the lemon butter (gasp) PERFECTION. a must go for those wanting southern style food in a cozy area of Williamsburg.,4.0

"This place is a great place to eat when you want something simple and inexpensive.I know sweet chic was known for their chicken as waffles and i LOVE chicken and waffles so i had to try theirs. Their chicken and waffles came with a large waffle, two or three large pieces of fried chicken (it was the thigh and the leg-- i hate the thigh but it was okay). This dish was also served with 4 different types of butters, i believe one was honey, blueberry and i can't quite remember the other two but they were delicious. I also tried their blueberry lemonade which i wasn't crazy about... it was more of a seltzer than a lemonade.

"The wait for Saturday was quite long, and I had no idea where I should stand cuz the space was so small with the waitresses running all over. It was also impractical to wait outside in the snow lol The hostess was alright, not too friendly but not terrible either. We salivated just from looking at the fried chicken on other people's tables. The menu had a good, solid selection but really who would pass on the fried chicken and waffles?! It was great, well deserved its popularity. Egg Benny was good too, but beware of how full you'll be afterwards! Oh, get their bacon on the side. Would love to try other things on their menu as well.",4.0
"Definitely worth it. Great atmosphere. Great cocktails. The mac and cheese was stand out, as was the classic chicken. I prefer a slightly crispier waffle, but then I've been spoiled by Roscoe's, so that's probably unfair. But the flavor was wonderful. The boudin ball appetizer was excellent! Our table also shared the chocolate donut ice cream sandwich, which was very rich, so I'm glad we split it three ways. Perfect for a couple bites with coffee. Service was way above par and food came out quickly. I'd definitely go again.",4.0
"As soon as we were seated, we were told our only option from their menu was the classic chicken and waffles until 6pm. We were an hour short of trying a variety off the menu, but it took out the guess work and the indecision amongst 4 people asking eachother ""What're you getting?"" I don't know. ""What are YOU ordering?"". It's a typical pre-dinner conversation for us. I digress. The chicken is delicious, delicious, delicious. The waffles were good with the blueberry, herb and honey butter selection. Definitely a place I would return to, to try the rest of what's on their menu (perhaps a little earlier in the day for their brunch or later in the evening for their dinner). It's got a very old school atmosphere which I love. Their Arnold Palmer threw me off a bit though. Try it and you'll know what I mean. That means you've gotta take a trip to this place and don't forget to order the chicken and waffles!",4.0
"Wanted to try Sweet Chick before the Dandy Warhols concert at Music Hall.  This was a Saturday night and, when the BF and I saw the crowd waiting for a table, thought we might have to look for a bite elsewhere.  The hostess said '25 minutes' - which ended up being TRUE - surprisingly, to-the-minute, true - and so happy we waited!Drinks were good, but a little pricey for the random glass size you may receive.  Also, is it too much to ask for water to be COLD at a restaurant?  I get the whole 'repurposed vintage glass bottle and mason jar glasses', but, there's not much less refreshing than tepid water from a mason jar.  Really, there's not.So, one star off for the glassware/water and...  we wanted the pickle plate and it had 'sold out a while ago'.  This is a PICKLE PLATE and it was 730 on Saturday night.  You still have a good 6 hrs of dinner service ahead and you're sold out of pickles?  A food you really can prepare heaps of in advance?  So boo that the pickle plate had sold out.As for what we did eat, it was all amazingly delicious.  We had roasted sprouts, biscuits and cornbread to start.  The cornbread was very delicious, but super tiny.  The biscuit was the size of a child's head, and also delicious.  For mains, I had the Hot Honey chix and waffles.  Perfectly spicy honey drizzled on their crispy-skinned, juicy chicken.  The waffles were super fluffy and made a great accompaniment.  The BF ordered the cordon bleu chix and waffles - and again - very delicious.  Very savory and rich with all the cheese.  An interesting combination that they pulled off well.We enjoyed our mains SO MUCH we went back for dessert post concert!  The S'mores jar was beyond decadent.  Exactly what you want from a mason jar (ie: not warm water).  The specialty donut was also very good, but.... that s'mores jar.... yum yum.",4.0

I didnt want my 1st Sweet Chick experience to be ruined by a waffle i wouldn't like, they also give a few tasty flavored butters & hands down the honey butter is awesomeness!!",4.0
"Loveee this place. Great food: I got the hot honey fried chicken and waffles, the kale salad and rosemary cornbread and everything was amazing!What's more, their drinks were unique and delicious. The place itself it small and cute with great vibes. Very Brooklyn. I highly recommend - I cannot wait to go back!",5.0
Easily the best chicken and waffles plus cocktail menu I've seen in New York. Eat here now. Bring a date. Show everyone how great you are at picking restaurants.Get the duck pâté because you understand how delicious it is. Get the mac and cheese because you know it's not just for kids. It's also a complex gourmet starter. Get a cocktail and discuss gastronomy with the friendly staff. Duck sliders? Yep. Perfect. See you there. Found my new favorite place.,5.0
Great atmosphere...music and ambiance. Best waffles hands down! And the chicken!!!! Was A1!! The price was reasonable and drinks as well. Will come back for brunch! Right in the heart of the north side of WiilyB,5.0
"I went to Sweet Chick for the first time the other day based on a few recommendations and curiosity from having walked past it a few times. I was a bit disappointed that when we walked in from the rain, the server directed us to a semi-crowded table next to two couples. I then asked if we could sit at the empty table across the room, which he stated was reserved for parties of 3 or more. Listen...it's Tuesday afternoon and it's raining pretty hard. What is the likelihood that you will run out of seating before we're done eating? After agreeing to sit in a less than ideal spot right next to another group of folks, two women came in and where immediately seated at the table we wanted. No third person. The restaurant never did fill up, in fact, tables emptied around us as we ate. Did it matter that we were two black women asking to sit there instead of the two white woman who were just shown to that table? Of course. The staff all seem incredibly nice but that stuck out for me. Other than that annoyance, the service was above excellent, our waitress was kind and suggested amazing dishes, and the food was amazing! The vegetarian fried chicken was fantastic and the waffles come with a variety of flavored butter. I was really hoping to have an equally wonderful experience that some of my friends had, but I'd be willing to try again.",3.0
"This place is a great place to eat when you want something simple and inexpensive.I know sweet chic was known for their chicken as waffles and i LOVE chicken and waffles so i had to try theirs. Their chicken and waffles came with a large waffle, two or three large pieces of fried chicken (it was the thigh and the leg-- i hate the thigh but it was okay). This dish was also served with 4 different types of butters, i believe one was honey, blueberry and i can't quite remember the other two but they were delicious. I also tried their blueberry lemonade which i wasn't crazy about... it was more of a seltzer than a lemonade. Greeting: Yes, and seated right awayFood: GoodAtmosphere: HipsterAttire: CasualWould I come back?: Yes",4.0
"The wait for Saturday was quite long, and I had no idea where I should stand cuz the space was so small with the waitresses running all over. It was also impractical to wait outside in the snow lol The hostess was alright, not too friendly but not terrible either. We salivated just from looking at the fried chicken on other people's tables. The menu had a good, solid selection but really who would pass on the fried chicken and waffles?! It was great, well deserved its popularity. Egg Benny was good too, but beware of how full you'll be afterwards! Oh, get their bacon on the side. Would love to try other things on their menu as well.",4.0
"Definitely worth it. Great atmosphere. Great cocktails. The mac and cheese was stand out, as was the classic chicken. I prefer a slightly crispier waffle, but then I've been spoiled by Roscoe's, so that's probably unfair. But the flavor was wonderful. The boudin ball appetizer was excellent! Our table also shared the chocolate donut ice cream sandwich, which was very rich, so I'm glad we split it three ways. Perfect for a couple bites with coffee. Service was way above par and food came out quickly. I'd definitely go again.",4.0
"As soon as we were seated, we were told our only option from their menu was the classic chicken and waffles until 6pm. We were an hour short of trying a variety off the menu, but it took out the guess work and the indecision amongst 4 people asking eachother ""What're you getting?"" I don't know. ""What are YOU ordering?"". It's a typical pre-dinner conversation for us. I digress. The chicken is delicious, delicious, delicious. The waffles were good with the blueberry, herb and honey butter selection. Definitely a place I would return to, to try the rest of what's on their menu (perhaps a little earlier in the day for their brunch or later in the evening for their dinner). It's got a very old school atmosphere which I love. Their Arnold Palmer threw me off a bit though. Try it and you'll know what I mean. That means you've gotta take a trip to this place and don't forget to order the chicken and waffles!",4.0
"Wanted to try Sweet Chick before the Dandy Warhols concert at Music Hall.  This was a Saturday night and, when the BF and I saw the crowd waiting for a table, thought we might have to look for a bite elsewhere.  The hostess said '25 minutes' - which ended up being TRUE - surprisingly, to-the-minute, true - and so happy we waited!Drinks were good, but a little pricey for the random glass size you may receive.  Also, is it too much to ask for water to be COLD at a restaurant?  I get the whole 'repurposed vintage glass bottle and mason jar glasses', but, there's not much less refreshing than tepid water from a mason jar.  Really, there's not.So, one star off for the glassware/water and...  we wanted the pickle plate and it had 'sold out a while ago'.  This is a PICKLE PLATE and it was 730 on Saturday night.  You still have a good 6 hrs of dinner service ahead and you're sold out of pickles?  A food you really can prepare heaps of in advance?  So boo that the pickle plate had sold out.As for what we did eat, it was all amazingly delicious.  We had roasted sprouts, biscuits and cornbread to start.  The cornbread was very delicious, but super tiny.  The biscuit was the size of a child's head, and also delicious.  For mains, I had the Hot Honey chix and waffles.  Perfectly spicy honey drizzled on their crispy-skinned, juicy chicken.  The waffles were super fluffy and made a great accompaniment.  The BF ordered the cordon bleu chix and waffles - and again - very delicious.  Very savory and rich with all the cheese.  An interesting combination that they pulled off well.We enjoyed our mains SO MUCH we went back for dessert post concert!  The S'mores jar was beyond decadent.  Exactly what you want from a mason jar (ie: not warm water).  The specialty donut was also very good, but.... that s'mores jar.... yum yum.",4.0

"47%Pretty good, if not the best chicken and waffles.***Came here with a small group Oct '13 for brunch.  The chicken & waffles, approx $14 (Dish rating 50%) werent bad, but not among one of my favorites.  There are some good qualities and some less memorable.  There was nothing unpleasant about it. PIC;yelp.com/biz_photos/swee…*What I liked about my chicken and waffles were;- Maybe this is more a service issue, but they were happy to give me 2 (out of 2) pieces of fried chicken thigh meat, which is my favorite cut.- The chicken underneath the breading was more juicy than usual.  The flavor of the chicken was intense than usual.  Im guessing the bird might have been brined prior before frying.  It was good chicken, and thats the best part of the dish.- There is nothing in the breading or condiments that obscure the natural flavor of the chicken.- Serving temperature was appropriately hot.*What I found less memorable was;- Every other component, although inoffensive, was more pedestrian.- The fried chicken breading seemed to lack character I could discern.  I'm glad it wasnt over seasoned, but if there was an spice or flavors thrown in, it was too subtle to make any statement.  - The texture of the batter gives a nice soft crunch, but it also seemed to fall off at greasier parts of the chicken a bit too easy. Its not bad, but not memorable.- The waffles and maple syrup used seemed like your usual restaurant variety.  I didnt find either essential and could have omitted either.  The waffles were fairly fluffy and worked okay.The execution seems to be there.  The concept appears more conventional.Value seems about average considering its $14 for two piece chicken and waffles.  The quantity of food isnt bad for the average diner, but the quality and more conservative level of creativity isnt enough to make it a steal.Service was about average.  Although our server seemed alright to me, my dining companion was not so fortunate.  He ordered a pastry plate that was to include a pear bread pudding, among other items.  It was a bit awkward that Sweet Chick ran out of their bread pudding as part of their pastry plate, and just gave him something else without offering an explanation or apology.  Were it that service be more upfront, it would have been entirely understandable.    When my dining companion followed up, the server just shrugged and said they ran out of the bread pudding.  The server did give him another different kind of pastry, which was nice, but I think it was silly to try pass it off as if we wouldnt notice.  Id advise to make sure what you order comes through.Ambiance isnt bad.  The decor resembles a rustic older house or bar, like so many Williamsburg restaurants.  Theres plenty of natural lighting, and it lends itself well to brunch.  Acoustic levels are comfortable and not loud.  Its a welcoming environment.Overall Sweet Chick isnt bad, but im not so inclined to return anytime soon with the abundance of dining options near by.",3.0
God bless the person that made these chicken & waffles! Actually my first time having chicken and waffles and I adore the blueberry butter that comes with it.,5.0
came here for an event with Vashtie that featured food. I love food .. you can tell by my yelp account. That fried chicken OMFG so flavorful and juicy tastes like it was made in my house. I messed up my Nars red lippie and I didn't care! The pulled pork was okay butttttt the mac & the vegetarian food was top notch. I despise coming to hippyville but the food and the service are totally unmatched. I would love to cook with the co-owner I have my own twists that would be great for his curry chicken ;) I also heard the desert was super delicious so I will be back ...  traveling all the way from Brownsville to try it :D,5.0
"I came here for a friends birthday not expecting to have a good time. But the food and atmosphere really changed the ballgame for me. I never saw so many options for fried chicken in my life. And if you know me, I know my fried chicken. So as we sat down, we were promptly attended to and our drinks were ordered. I had the tiger, tiger woods yall, which was a nice boozy Arnold Palmer and my guess had a drink special that was really sweet and fruity. For dinner we ordered a side of Mac and cheese. This must be ordered at each table of four because if you're having this between two people the guilt isn't distributed equally. It's so rich and flavorful from the different cheeses that just melts so perfectly in your mouth. And a side of collard greens. Which tasted like your standard collard greens which makes me happy. It was salty and smokey with a nice tang of sour. And for our main course I had the chicken special of the day. Which was a super spicy chicken with sweet delicious waffle from heaven. The waffle was drizzled over with condensed milk and it tasted like awesome it was so fluffy and sweet with a little bit of crunch. It paired out so well with the moist and spicy chicken that I was thoroughly enjoying. My guest had the general tso, it was really good because I ended up eating one of their piece. It reminds you of a nice cozy evening having chinese food and watching an episode or two of the Big Bang theory. Damn you Sheldon. But the one thing that threw me off was the rice in the waffle. It made the waffle so much more dense. The texture was really off to me but my guest really liked it. Overall we really enjoyed our stay here and I'm excited to come by here again. Definitely get the chicken and waffle no matter what mix it is, it will be worth it.",5.0
"Should've expected long lines for a place right near the subway station - 1.5 hours on a Saturday night!  The ambience is cozy and the food is decent.  I got the pork belly special but it ended up having TOO much fat and not enough meat - the perfect fat/meat ratio should be more like 1/3.  Plus, the portions seemed a bit too ""Willamsburg-y"" to be filling.  It's supposed to be comfort food right?? Not a bad place just a bit overrated.",3.0
"Quite a disappointing vibe from the staff. Came in for a Thursday brunch and felt being watched....quiet uncomfortable.  We weren't greeted by a host, so I thought the tables were for grabs.  But as soon as I approached a slightly ""bigger table"" the staff immediately escorted me to smaller one since it was just the two of us. Anal munch?  Even though the restaurant were part empty, I guess its just restaurant policy especially for ""hot spot"" like this. My waitress was also quiet skeptical of my age (I get it I look young, but we are not trying to pound shots on a Thursday morning...we just want something to sip on. Chilllll)  Point being- It just doesn't felt like the usual chill- Brooklyn spot. Maybe it was the loads of Manhattan suspects surfacing on Bedford Ave... Ordered the Chicken & Waffle, Mac & Cheese, Fruit salad (side).  Very reasonable portion.  Like the other reviewer said - the fried Chicken was bit boring, the Waffle outshine the chicken being very light and fluffy and not too sweet.  It also came with 3 different version of butter (herb, regular, and rhubarb) Food does the job, Location is ok, Price is alright, Staff were just meh.",3.0
"Being from California, we are definitely deprived of some REAL southern/soul chicken and waffles joints.  We have a chicken n waffle chain in SoCal, but after trying Sweet Chick, this place puts all California chicken and waffles places to SHAME. This place is conveniently located in the heart of colonial Williamsburg and only a block away from the Bedford station. We walk in on a Thursday around 11am and no wait at all for a party of 2.  I noticed a full bar off to the side.  And a chalkboard in back that says ""Free beer with Chicken and Waffles!"" UHHHMM hell yes?!Water came to us in an old alcohol bottle and my bf and I giggled to ourselves cuz we assumed it was an old Hennessy bottle.  We ordered the chicken n waffles ($16) and the pulled pork sammich with shoe string fries ($11).  Our waiter told us we also get free soda with the chicken n waffles order, so yay, free sprite as well.  So when the food came out to us, we were very pleased!  Chicken was cooked perfectly, not too soggy, not too crunchy, and was very tender inside.  Waffle had just the amount of fluff to it without being too soft or chewy.  They also provided different types of butter.  I remember mumbling ""why can't California have chicken and waffles like this!!!""  The pulled pork ended up being alright, but still ate it all nonetheless.  Loved how the shoestring fries were cooked.  Would definitely come back to fulfill my chicken and waffles craving next time we're back in NY!",4.0
"The customer service here is terrible! We waited 20 minutes waiting for a table, and when we first stepped in, there was an empty table of four people and they didn't seat us! We waited 20 minutes and checked in again and they said the table was taken but no one was there. They DON'T take reservations, yet they held that table. I religiously checked with the hostess who didn't seem to be the brightest one. She doesn't have good work ethics. The table has been vacant for the past 20 minutes (once again) and the table is still empty. HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!!!! HORRIBLE HORRIBLE! I would not suggest it because of its service. Food is pretty good, but the customer service kills the experience. If you don't wanna wait and are accustomed to fair waiting periods, this is not the place for you!",2.0
"Me and a couple of friends went for brunch. I know it's expected to be packed on a Sunday but I wasn't expecting the place to be so small! It's very cramped and the wait was about an hour for a party of three! Ridiculous! Be prepared to have to share tables with strangers if necessary. Staff was nice and they were playing throwback 90s music. As for the food, it was pretty good. I got the two eggs (scrambled) with home fries and toast and a side of house cured bacon. Greatest bacon I've ever tasted! Eggs were delicious. Home fries, not so much. My friends got the chicken & waffles and they were pretty satisfied. Cute trendy spot but I don't see myself coming back",3.0
I was looking forward to the chicken and waffles but the chicken batter was not to my liking.  It was dark and overpowered by thyme. The waffle was excellent though and two of the three butters provided were great (the butter with thyme was not doing it for me and I LOVE thyme on everything). To drink I had a boozy peach ice tea which hit the spot on this sunny day. The bartender was making some complicated drinks for the people next to me and they were raving about them. I will need to experiment. All in all I thought the place was ok. I will go back to try the other dishes and make a more informed decision.,3.0

I did it because I thought I should try something unique. I'll admit that I almost ran to the kitchen to change my order because it just sounded too weird. But good news- it was INCREDIBLE. Margarita syrup. What is that? I loved it. Drinks were great, food was great, prices were fair. Our server was attentive and friendly and made great recommendations. We loved her! We went at 7pm on a Tuesday and were able to get a table. Pretty sure the situation would have been different had we shown up on a weekend. Great!",5.0
"Always always always great food, they never disappoint. I do miss the days when we didn't have to wait for a table, but it's well worth it. I have had the BLT salad... Can't go wrong with slab bacon, the dressing was light just how I like my salads. Chicken and waffles are awesome... The different flavor butters makes it outstanding. The ultimate eat here is the Shrimp and grit... The best I've had in NY. It is very close to southern style grits, reminds me of Charleston.",5.0
"Just visited this place today after a while of curiosity. Does this place live up to it's hype?Yes and no.  On one hand, the chicken is delicious and perfectly seasoned, but there was only two small pieces of it. The waffle is good but had no crunch factor which I enjoy from a waffle.  I think what I enjoyed the most was the whipped butters they give you. They had thyme, sweet lemon, and blueberry flavors.  The lemon one was absolutely, positively, downright delicious and addicting. I could've ate a whole jar.  Hah.  I should've asked them what they put it in. I'll be dreaming of that butter tonight... Anyways, this place is definitely a treat which will probably leave you still pretty hungry...at least I was.  Very small portions with a big price-tag. 2 orders of chicken and waffle was $40 ( with tip and tax).  MMM that butter though.. YUM! Paula Deen sure would approve ya'll.",4.0
"Best chicken and waffles i've ever tried in nyc hands down! The place has a very urban, cozy feel to it & a very chill atmosphere.

They also don't take reservations, which can kill your morning or day if trying to eat here in a group.That said, if you want some really good shrimp and grits, this place has it! The shrimp comes in a ""stewed"" like red sauce with A LOT of vegetables - which they could actually easy up on a little (too much). Very delicious! I'd come back just to eat that again.I also sampled my friends chicken and waffles. It was ok. The waffles weren't anything special or fluffy. No warm syrup here either.",3.0
"Service was solid. Food was amazing. Chicken and waffles were perfection. I really appreciated that the chicken wasn't heavy and not at all greasy. Although I'm not huge on adding butter to my food, I do have to admit their lemon butter and blueberry butter were out of this world. The syrup has a little kick of cayenne/lemon/honey flavor to it. It really complimented the dish. My friend and I agreed we would definitely go back. The restaurant itself is also super cute. They have the cutest shirts for sale, I wanted one sooo bad.",5.0

"Amazing place! Food was excellent...from appetizers to mains, it was perfect. I ordered one of last night's specials (the nacho chicken and waffle). I did it because I thought I should try something unique. I'll admit that I almost ran to the kitchen to change my order because it just sounded too weird. But good news- it was INCREDIBLE. Margarita syrup. What is that? I loved it. Drinks were great, food was great, prices were fair. Our server was attentive and friendly and made great recommendations. We loved her! We went at 7pm on a Tuesday and were able to get a table. Pretty sure the situation would have been different had we shown up on a weekend. Great!",5.0
"Always always always great food, they never disappoint. I do miss the days when we didn't have to wait for a table, but it's well worth it. I have had the BLT salad... Can't go wrong with slab bacon, the dressing was light just how I like my salads. Chicken and waffles are awesome... The different flavor butters makes it outstanding. The ultimate eat here is the Shrimp and grit... The best I've had in NY. It is very close to southern style grits, reminds me of Charleston.",5.0
"Just visited this place today after a while of curiosity. Does this place live up to it's hype?Yes and no.  On one hand, the chicken is delicious and perfectly seasoned, but there was only two small pieces of it. The waffle is good but had no crunch factor which I enjoy from a waffle.  I think what I enjoyed the most was the whipped butters they give you. They had thyme, sweet lemon, and blueberry flavors.  The lemon one was absolutely, positively, downright delicious and addicting. I could've ate a whole jar.  Hah.  I should've asked them what they put it in. I'll be dreaming of that butter tonight... Anyways, this place is definitely a treat which will probably leave you still pretty hungry...at least I was.  Very small portions with a big price-tag. 2 orders of chicken and waffle was $40 ( with tip and tax).  MMM that butter though.. YUM! Paula Deen sure would approve ya'll.",4.0
"Best chicken and waffles i've ever tried in nyc hands down! The place has a very urban, cozy feel to it & a very chill atmosphere.

The chicken is flavorful, juicy and has just enough breading. It's seriously some of the best fried chicken I've ever had in Brooklyn.If you haven't been yet, GO.",4.0
Had high expectations for the fried chicken here. Something was off about the chicken. It wasn't gritty enough. It tasted like healthy fried chicken. The skin was crispy but dry and lacked oil resulting in a weird texture. There was good flavor though and the inside was moist. I got the mushroom and rosemary waffle which was excellent. Tasted like a regular waffle except for two pieces of mushroom that was inside. We also got the bucket of fried chicken which came with good collard slaw and a dense tasteless biscuit. The duck sliders are delicious. The mac and cheese is very creamy and the ritz crackers make a good topping but nothing that special. Do not get the spiked ice tea! It tastes like cough medicine and no sweet tea flavor at all! It was nasty. Atmosphere is nice and staff is friendly. Wait was 20 mins on a sunday night,3.0
Very good! Me and my guy ran into this place and tried it on a whim. I was not disappointed! He got the chicken and waffles and I got the blueberry pancakes with a side of chicken. Everything was GOOD. The chicken was particularly BOMB because it was so flavorful and juicy. Few restaurants serve good fried chicken like that. Highly recommended!,5.0
Everything I have had here is excellent!   The vegetarian fried chicken is definitely a game changer.    Somewhere you can go with carnivorous friends and everyone still leaves happy.   I've had both the original vegetarian fried chicken and the Nashville hot vegetarian chicken and it was to die for!      Once the biscuit was a little stale but overall very consistent and a place I always look forward to visiting.,5.0

We added our name to the list and waited in the car for about 20 mins -- they called us on our cellphone when our table was ready...and asked us how far we were so that they could hold out table! Awesome!!PROS: food was great and fresh; very polite staff; and, good location as far as a variety of things to do (but it's pretty far from my home).Waffles--fresh, light, very tastyFried chicken-- crispy, flavorful, fresh, and good!Home fries -- good, but not unique. I wouldn't order them again. One order is enough for 2-3 people. Blackberry lemonade -- no thank uPeach iced tea -- (you will have to add sweetener). CONS: very small; not a good place for an intimate date (we couldn't hold hands or have a nice conversation -- the ""small"" table was too large); too many flies (don't sit by the window); and, it is extremely loud (similar to Red Robins).

"Wow, this chick really is sweet.Before we continue, if you cannot deal with hipsters, then it's going to be rough for you here.That being said, it was pretty infuriating walking through the heart of the hipster Williamsburg area of Bedford Ave right where Sweet Chick is located, but it was still more than worth it for the amazing food here.The place itself is really nice, with good music playing (hip-hop is what I heard most of the time), and a nice atmosphere with the wide open storefront where they also have some outdoor seating. It is kind of a bummer to get seated at the long communal tables, but just pretend you are on the TV show Girls, and you will feel cooler.Anyway, the food here is incredible. There is so much good stuff on the menu that it was tough to choose, so instead we just got way too much food for two people. I didn't pull my favorite obese person action of ordering 3 entrees for two 2 people, but the 2 entrees we did order happened to be huge and consisted of way more food than their price tag would typically buy you in this area.We got the Sweet Chick Bucket ($17), which consists of 3 huge, delicious pieces of fried chicken, some really refreshing and tasty Collard & Carrot Slaw, and a pretty good Buttermilk Biscuit. This was incredibly good, and looks ridiculous when they bring it out in a huge bucket (don't be alarmed though, the bottom half of the bucket is filled with paper so it's not quite as much food as it looks like it might be).We also got the Sweet Chick Chicken & Waffles ($16) and opted for the Bacon & Cheddar Waffles instead of the original. This dish included 2 more pieces of some of the best fried chicken I've ever had, along with some really delicious waffles. Again, this was practically a bargain for how much food it was compared to some of these silly places these days that charge $20+ for a smaller fried chicken meal.In addition, we also tried the Cornbread ($4) (because one biscuit clearly isn't enough for 2 people), which was decent, and the Mac & Cheese ($8), which was awesome. It was super addictive and some of the best I've had. It was shells instead of the usual elbows, and it wasn't too cheesy, which is how I like it so it doesn't feel like you are eating straight up liquidy cheese.I would definitely recommend the insufferable trip on the L train to get here for an extremely satisfying, hip meal, at a great price.",5.0

However, I think their Eggs Benny is the winner for king of the menu.The biscuit is big, but not a dense mess like some ""homestyle"" biscuits can be, and the chicken + ham combination is excellent. It comes with potatoes which were also excellent. Then there were the cheese grits. Nice, coarse grits with a strong cheddar flavor. I really need to get my act together and dip into my Southern by proxy background and learn to make these, because I absolutely love grits. These did not disappoint.So, the Eggs Benny grabbed my attention, but the apple, ginger, strawberry lemonade made my eyes widen. I almost thought they were just listing 3 separate kinds of lemonade.

This place is so good  if you crave fried chicken. I had the chicken and waffles. The chicken was moist the breading was crunchy and just slightly spicy. The waffles were cooked to perfection. I didn't use one of the 3 flavored butters because it did not need it. If you are remotely interested in eating there at peek hours but your name on the list and then go walk around Bedford and come back 5 minutes earlier than what they told you.

"I'm still coming down from my high off of this place...I think I had one of my best brunches EVER here. I can say without an ounce of hesitation that I had the best chicken and waffles of my life here, too.At 1 p.m. on a Sunday, there's a crowd, but the announced 25 minute wait was merely 15, and I got a prompt text message from the hostess telling me to scurry on back.

Talk about absolutely refreshing, hell, effervescent! It wasn't overtly sweet but had a nice medley of tea and lemon. On a warm and muggy Sunday afternoon, this absolutely hits the spot. Next, let us discuss the best chicken and waffles ever. EVER. EVER, I SAY! The waffles, the perfect consistency. The chicken, freshly fried, hot, greasy, with a slight hint of peppery heat in the skin. The maple syrup I doused it all in, REAL. (Never give a born and raised New England girl the fake stuff! She'll throw a fit. Don't test me now...) every bite was divine, and I became satiated yet sadder with each passing bite, as I knew the time of complete consumption was nigh.The beau got the pancakes with blueberry compote.

"been for brunch and for dinner - and ironically, i have been head-over-heels for everything i've ordered here EXCEPT the chicken and waffles... the chicken was...difficult to maneuver? i guess there wasnt enough meat on it or something but i found it almost impossible to eat. BUT despite the chicken, i loooove this place. for brunch, i got shrimp n grits and it was awesome (never had that dish like that before- it was in a soupy kinda sauce.. f'ing delicious) and a bloody mary which had a lovely little bacon garnish (swoon)when we went for dinner my friend and i split the white chicken chili and it was INCREDIBLE, and we shared two types of chicken and waffles-  the chicken parm and the hot honey. the waffles were awesome and the flavoring of the chicken(s) were great but like i said before, i think there wasnt enough meat on it and i couldnt even really cut a piece of edible chicken off the bone without destroying the entire chicken breast and skinning it of all of its glorious friedness + parmesean topping.in sum - ill be back for everything except the chicken",4.0

"Ok, so I patronized this restaurant on a whim. I very rarely visit Brooklyn, especially Williamsburg, so I at first was a little reluctant to try this place; but I'm glad I did.We arrived at about 3:30 p.m., and were told that there would be a 25 minute wait, which ended up being only a good 15 minutes. We were then immediately seated and given menus. As I glanced over the menu, the waiter notified us that there'd be a very limited brunch menu. So, because we were seated at about 4 p.m., the restaurant only prepared foods listed on the ""in between"" menu (4-6 p.m.). This menu only reflects a select set of brunch entrees. I wasn't too please about that, but I dealt with it as I had no choice.  I immediately ordered an Arnold Palmer soda, that I ended up asking to switch out for a regular grape soda because it didn't taste too great.  If you're going for a non sweetened style soda, then the Arnold Palmer is for you.  Moving on to our food orders, I ordered the chicken n bacon cheddar waffles. My daughter also opted for the chicken n waffles, however she chose the cherry waffles w/ a side of Mac n cheese.  Alongside each chicken n waffle entrée comes 3 styles of butters, and syrup. Let me tell you... The fried chicken was amazing.  I'm very skeptical and picky about my fried chicken, but this place did their thing! The chicken was fried crispy, flavored well, and arrived to my table piping HOT. The waffles were pretty soft, and easy to cut and chew. I do NOT like crunchy waffles, so I was very pleased with how they were prepared. I didn't too much enjoy the mac n cheese.  Definitely wasn't the southern style mac n cheese that I'm used to, and my daughter felt the same way. We pushed that to the side right away.We ate our food so fast, that the next thing we knew, we had a desert menu handed to us. It took us about 2 seconds to order the upside down strawberry cake w/ lemon ice cream and caramel sauce.  Oh... my... gawd..... I thoroughly enjoyed this.  PLEASE, do yourself a favor and order this during your next visit.Overall I had a pretty good experience with a few disappointments here and there, but now I'm very well prepared for my next visit. I forgot to add above, that  I was not charged for the soda switch. Extra star given.",4.0
Food was amazing! Everything was great. I ordered chicken and waffles with a side of mac. Omg..mouth watering and the mac and cheese was a different tastier kind of mac Ive ever tasted. It was creamy and I love the little crunchies put on top of it. Even better. Loved everything. Oh and I had a peach bellini and I must say they werent cheap on the wine side. I tasted the wine more than the peach nectar! (smiles) No complaints. Great family spot and date night setting too. Went in the daytime and it was a fairly nice crowd. Will be returning and certainly recommend this spot!,5.0
"Myself along with a two others decided to venture to Williamsburg to check out this staple. There was a bit of a wait however they took my phone number and we went to get coffee while we wait. They called and said our table was ready, however it took us about 6-7 minutes to get back to the place..Expecting that they had given our table away, they kindly sat us.Of course their flagship entree is Chicken and Waffles, however two things caught my eye as we walked to our table.. The Eggs Benedict and the Bloody Mary with bacon in it. Yes, bacon.I decided to pass on the Bloody Mary as I didn't feel like indulging in a beverage at that time of day, however I could not resist the Eggs Benedict. My friends got the Chicken and Waffles, and the vegetarian (not vegan friendly) Chicken and Waffles. The first thing I wanted to try was the vegetarian dish, as it could have fooled anybody for the real deal. It tasted fantastic, and with the exception of the expected slightly chewy consistency it tasted EXACTLY like chicken. Well done Sweet Chick.Next I tried the famous Chicken and Waffles. It was really fantastic and exactly what it sounds like. Make sure to go easy on the syrup as the waffles are delightfully light, however can easily soak up more syrup than you expect.My Eggs Benedict was wonderful on all accounts. The eggs were poached correctly, along with a good hollandaise sauce to boot. Bacon complimented the dish, and I even think there was some chicken thrown in. It was a heavy meal, but expected to be so. The hash on the other hand could have been better. It had a slightly burnt flavor, and had definitely been made earlier in the day.Throughout the meal our server was great, however when it came time to pay he kind of insinuated that we should not receive any change from our bill however this would have resulted in a 40% + tip. This insinuation was more than a ""do you need change?""Between the servers tip suggestion and the hash, this establishment does not receive the 5th star, however I would highly recommend this restaurant.",4.0

"Tonight was my first time there. Food was good; wait was long (not surprising for a Saturday night). I had the chicken and waffles with the milk honey jam and a cheddar bacon waffle (the waffle was more sweet than savory like I thought it would be but I was still good.)

"From living in the south, I feel like I have gotten a pretty good grasp on southern cookin'. For Sweet Chick being in the north - not too bad.They had all the right basics waffles and chicken, a pickled plate, mac and cheese and crawfish hush puppies.The mac and cheese and the crawfish hush puppies were my favorite.We did order duck sliders which were very mediocre. The service was friendly and prompt.",3.0
Chicken and waffles! chicken seasoned to perfection. waffles were soft inside and nice and crunchy outside. Absolutely recommend. I'll give them a pass for the flies lurking inside because it was a hot and wet day.,5.0

"I'm not real sure how I've never reviewed this place...I think I've been here a handful of times now. By far, one of my most favorite places for chicken and waffles. Mind you, it goes a step beyond your simple chicken and waffles...they have varieties...yes, variety! (and they also have brunch)The decor...the ambiance, is cool.There's wood everyone, but the country feel, not the beer hall feel. It can get loud, but certain seats have an intimate feel, which there is also a communal table or two.The food:-general tso's chicken and rice & broccoli waffles - awesome, super awesome...covered in sauce and deliciously spicy-regular fried chicken with bacon & cheddar waffles - super delicious, moist chicken...and bits of thick-cut bacon IN your waffle-shrimp and grits - deliciously awesome-the mac and cheese is good-the duck sliders - good, but not completely necessary and is not a mealTLDR: obviously I think this place is awesome, so don't waste time and get yourself some chicken and waffles",5.0
It should Def be a bigger place because the wait times ate horrible. But good food nonetheless,3.0
"Ok, so I patronized this restaurant on a whim. I very rarely visit Brooklyn, especially Williamsburg, so I at first was a little reluctant to try this place; but I'm glad I did.We arrived at about 3:30 p.m., and were told that there would be a 25 minute wait, which ended up being only a good 15 minutes. We were then immediately seated and given menus. As I glanced over the menu, the waiter notified us that there'd be a very limited brunch menu. So, because we were seated at about 4 p.m., the restaurant only prepared foods listed on the ""in between"" menu (4-6 p.m.). This menu only reflects a select set of brunch entrees. I wasn't too please about that, but I dealt with it as I had no choice.  I immediately ordered an Arnold Palmer soda, that I ended up asking to switch out for a regular grape soda because it didn't taste too great.  If you're going for a non sweetened style soda, then the Arnold Palmer is for you.  Moving on to our food orders, I ordered the chicken n bacon cheddar waffles. My daughter also opted for the chicken n waffles, however she chose the cherry waffles w/ a side of Mac n cheese.  Alongside each chicken n waffle entrée comes 3 styles of butters, and syrup. Let me tell you... The fried chicken was amazing.  I'm very skeptical and picky about my fried chicken, but this place did their thing! The chicken was fried crispy, flavored well, and arrived to my table piping HOT. The waffles were pretty soft, and easy to cut and chew. I do NOT like crunchy waffles, so I was very pleased with how they were prepared. I didn't too much enjoy the mac n cheese.  Definitely wasn't the southern style mac n cheese that I'm used to, and my daughter felt the same way. We pushed that to the side right away.We ate our food so fast, that the next thing we knew, we had a desert menu handed to us. It took us about 2 seconds to order the upside down strawberry cake w/ lemon ice cream and caramel sauce.  Oh... my... gawd..... I thoroughly enjoyed this.  PLEASE, do yourself a favor and order this during your next visit.Overall I had a pretty good experience with a few disappointments here and there, but now I'm very well prepared for my next visit. I forgot to add above, that  I was not charged for the soda switch. Extra star given.",4.0
Food was amazing! Everything was great. I ordered chicken and waffles with a side of mac. Omg..mouth watering and the mac and cheese was a different tastier kind of mac Ive ever tasted. It was creamy and I love the little crunchies put on top of it. Even better. Loved everything. Oh and I had a peach bellini and I must say they werent cheap on the wine side. I tasted the wine more than the peach nectar! (smiles) No complaints. Great family spot and date night setting too. Went in the daytime and it was a fairly nice crowd. Will be returning and certainly recommend this spot!,5.0
"Myself along with a two others decided to venture to Williamsburg to check out this staple. There was a bit of a wait however they took my phone number and we went to get coffee while we wait. They called and said our table was ready, however it took us about 6-7 minutes to get back to the place..Expecting that they had given our table away, they kindly sat us.Of course their flagship entree is Chicken and Waffles, however two things caught my eye as we walked to our table.. The Eggs Benedict and the Bloody Mary with bacon in it. Yes, bacon.I decided to pass on the Bloody Mary as I didn't feel like indulging in a beverage at that time of day, however I could not resist the Eggs Benedict. My friends got the Chicken and Waffles, and the vegetarian (not vegan friendly) Chicken and Waffles. The first thing I wanted to try was the vegetarian dish, as it could have fooled anybody for the real deal. It tasted fantastic, and with the exception of the expected slightly chewy consistency it tasted EXACTLY like chicken. Well done Sweet Chick.Next I tried the famous Chicken and Waffles. It was really fantastic and exactly what it sounds like. Make sure to go easy on the syrup as the waffles are delightfully light, however can easily soak up more syrup than you expect.My Eggs Benedict was wonderful on all accounts. The eggs were poached correctly, along with a good hollandaise sauce to boot. Bacon complimented the dish, and I even think there was some chicken thrown in. It was a heavy meal, but expected to be so. The hash on the other hand could have been better. It had a slightly burnt flavor, and had definitely been made earlier in the day.Throughout the meal our server was great, however when it came time to pay he kind of insinuated that we should not receive any change from our bill however this would have resulted in a 40% + tip. This insinuation was more than a ""do you need change?""Between the servers tip suggestion and the hash, this establishment does not receive the 5th star, however I would highly recommend this restaurant.",4.0
I just wanted to let everyone know that the chicken is delicious. Went on a Saturday afternoon and it was crowd but the chicken was worth the wait. I had home fries as well. If you are in the area check it out.,4.0
"Tonight was my first time there. Food was good; wait was long (not surprising for a Saturday night). I had the chicken and waffles with the milk honey jam and a cheddar bacon waffle (the waffle was more sweet than savory like I thought it would be but I was still good.)

A small gem that's great to go for my Chicken and Waffles fixes.  Bacon & Cheddar Waffles along with other variations but this is a must have for me and you can pay extra for extra chicken too.  Love to pair it with their Mac and Cheese as well as a good cold drink.  What can be better :),5.0

Solid dining experience but nothing extraordinary...had chicken and waffles and blueberry compote pancakes with home fries. Chicken had a nice crunch and tasted of Rosemary but lacked the typical salty taste you'd get from fried chicken. Waffles were a hit! Home fries were seasoned well with veggies.

We ordered mac and cheese, bacon salad, and chicken and waffles to share. I don't know why, but I felt everything tasted sweet to me.. even the mac and cheese. The fried chicken skin was extremely hard and white piece was dry, but the dark piece chicken meat was surprisingly really tender and juicy. I did like the waffles though. It was light, fluffy, and sweet. Everything that the chicken was not. My boyfriend told me that you could add bacon in the waffles, and I was pretty bummed when they told me it was only a dinner thing. I couldn't try it that time, but I'll be coming back just to try the bacon waffles and fried chicken next time.",3.0
I guess I had high expectations....maybe. But here we go.Loved the look of the place. The service was excellent. My friend ordered the standard chicken and waffles. (original) and I had the special General Tsos chicken with a white rice and broccolli waffle.I though both options were good. The chicken juicy. The General Tsos was pretty tasty too. The rice waffle was just ok...but still cool...The drinks were good...Tiger Woods y'all...was pretty good!However would I bust my hump to go to Williamsburg for this ......not really...it was just ok...not bad....not excellent....just ok... and not worth the pricing.So its cool eats if you're around and you feel like spending the money. However if you can definitely find something comparable and just as tasty at a lower price point.If the price points are going to be so high....can I ask for a more refined meal? Just saying..Love my Brooklyn eateries....but you can kinda miss this one.,3.0

Who doesn't love fried chicken and waffles!I love that their menu is small. Service is awesome and ambience is great.The food is out of this world!,5.0
"i came in for brunch it was busy and they had a wait , i had a reservation. but we killed time by having a drink at the bar - 2 of my party knew they wanted mismosas right. away the bartender makes them n hands them over along with the check. um seriously ? do u not see there 3 other ppl looking at the menu . after she did that they said they rather wait to order from a server - 20 charge i left 3 tip and she mumbles wow waste of time . idk if it was her first or last day but u get tipped for ur service not for pouring oj and champagne into 2 diff glasses by the way. idk i guess i had to come in on a different day because she totally ruined the rest of the experience for everyone",2.0
"Let me start by saying I am very particular about my fried chicken and while it is not something I would order again here, it wasn't bad and I'm sure a lot of people would love it. I could pass on the Mac and Cheese as it reminded me of school lunch pasta shells and cheese. The Duck sliders were really good and so were the bacon cheddar waffles! The Queen of New York Cocktail was good but I'm not a brown juice drinker so I should've asked for vodka. It's a small place with a great vibe and good service.",3.0
I got the Chicken and Waffles! It was very good! And the side of macaroni was to die for! Best macaroni I have ever had. Our server was super sweet too! I really liked this restaurant and I plan to come back! Seriously though you need to try their macaroni!!,5.0
"The food was quite tasty and the service was good. I ordered the gruyère mac & cheese (which was quite flavorful) and an order of chicken with bacon cheddar waffles. It was yummy, but the chicken has an odd flavor that I couldn't quite place (reminded me of something that had been frozen for too long, thus I docked two stars). The portion sizes, however, are great.",3.0
I came in a few weeks ago - this review is a bit overdue. I ordered the classic waffles and chicken dish and it was the bomb! straight up. The waffles were fluffy and the buttery syrup (which they give a generous amount of) was heavenly. The fried chicken was perfect.,5.0

"Came here before catching my flight 2 weeks ago. To my surprise, the restaurant was really empty. My boyfriend and I ordered off the lunch (brunch) menu. We ordered mac and cheese, bacon salad, and chicken and waffles to share. I don't know why, but I felt everything tasted sweet to me.. even the mac and cheese. The fried chicken skin was extremely hard and white piece was dry, but the dark piece chicken meat was surprisingly really tender and juicy. I did like the waffles though. It was light, fluffy, and sweet. Everything that the chicken was not. My boyfriend told me that you could add bacon in the waffles, and I was pretty bummed when they told me it was only a dinner thing. I couldn't try it that time, but I'll be coming back just to try the bacon waffles and fried chicken next time.",3.0
I guess I had high expectations....maybe. But here we go.Loved the look of the place. The service was excellent. My friend ordered the standard chicken and waffles. (original) and I had the special General Tsos chicken with a white rice and broccolli waffle.I though both options were good. The chicken juicy. The General Tsos was pretty tasty too. The rice waffle was just ok...but still cool...The drinks were good...Tiger Woods y'all...was pretty good!However would I bust my hump to go to Williamsburg for this ......not really...it was just ok...not bad....not excellent....just ok... and not worth the pricing.So its cool eats if you're around and you feel like spending the money. However if you can definitely find something comparable and just as tasty at a lower price point.If the price points are going to be so high....can I ask for a more refined meal? Just saying..Love my Brooklyn eateries....but you can kinda miss this one.,3.0
"Sunday brunch.  Is it still considered brunch at 2pm?  I'm not up on my brunch knowledge.  I was torn between the classic chicken and waffles or the shrimp and grits.  I went for the chicken and waffles.  Great fried chicken (not the best I have had) but crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside.  The waffle was light and not overly sweet.  We ordered a side of grits which were creamy, cheesy deliciousness.  The coffee was a bit weak.  I have never been a fan of french presses.  Oh well.  All in all, a delicious, satisfying meal well worth the wait.  Next time, I'm having the shrimp and grits.",4.0
"I went for brunch on a Sunday .  The restaurant is very cute and small.  They have an extensive bar with a lot of exciting featured cocktails.  I had a very spicy bloody mary, I mean verrry spicy and very delicious.  I love bloody marys that have a little piece bacon, not enough places do that so it was a delicious surprise.  I got the Eggs Benny which is the best eggs benedict of any sort that I have EVER had.  It consisted of biscuits, pulled chicken, tasso ham, and hollandaise.  LITERALLY the best thing ever and I would eat it everyday.The Bartenders, Hollye, and Sam are very sweet and I had a great time!Will definitely come back here next time I am in Brooklyn...

"Went here last night and got the chicken and waffles (bacon and cheddar), duck sliders and mac and cheese.the waffle was outstanding although the chicken was a little over done the syrup they serve is delish.The duck sliders were so good and that pickle is unexpected.Now the star of this meal was the mac and cheese.it was creamy and delish. There is this little crunch from the bread crumbs...its simply devine.Although I didnt have any dessert I will be back there but I think I will go for brunch next time and def try some.the pastry chef is Jamie from this season of masterchef and I would def love to try something...Overall I would return :-)",4.0

The chicken was delicious.  And not to be a snob, but I'm a chicken snob!  The batter was peppery and crunchy and the meat was juicy and soft.  The waffles were also perfect and soft on the inside and crunchy on the outsides.  Even better was the trio of butter; the lemon was my favorite.  So flavorful in such little bits.We did have to wait a LONG time and got a really generous comp off of our receipt from the management.  Which was surprising and really nice.  But knowing how good it is, I would have easily paid this myself.  Def want to come back and try on some of their other dishes.",4.0
"5 stars for food (chicken and waffles), 3 stars for ambiance. Food: really amazing chicken (super juicy and fresh and amazing) as well as waffles, which come in three different varieties -- was impressed by this. Also served a variety of butters, which was awesome.Ambiance: really really really loud music and super cramped quarters. A bit too dim during dinner but the loudness is a bit too much. There's also a specials board in the back but it's impossible to see if your back is facing it. To their defense, one cool thing is that the drinking cups are mason jars!Last: we ordered duck sliders that looked and tasted like beef--I'd avoid and pick something else.In all was great (as you can see I'm giving it a solid four stars) but the loudness does detract.",4.0

"""It's a 40 minute wait for a table or you can sit at the bar"" Saturday brunch time here is really crowded and it's very difficult to get a table. Lucky for me, I came by myself since I was already in the area. I found a seat at the bar right away and had my amazing chicken n' waffles [$16] in front of me within a few minutes. I also had a pear bellini [$9] which was good but fell flat in comparison. This place has been on my list for quite some time and the food was beyond any expectations. The chicken was juicy on the inside but so crispy on the outside. The waffles were soft and fluffy, sprinkled with powdered sugar. What really made this dish fantastic was the maple syrup and the three different kinds of butter on the side- raspberry, lemon curd, and regular. The lemon curd butter was absolutely my favorite- so refreshing and lemony.  Portions are on the big side but not at all heavy. I usually hate brunch but this place has solid food any time of the day. The bartender was friendly and attentive, I didn't feel rushed at all even though there was a group of 8 hipsters waiting for a table and congregating around the bar [as they recounted tales of a drunken night]. I  was in and out in 30 minutes and only dropped about $30. Win.",5.0

I freaking love this place. Been meaning to write a review for months. I only get two things here: chicken and waffles and mac n cheese. I'm obsessed!

"So I went to sweet chicks with my bestie and it was just ok this time around. It wasn't crowded I guess because it's a Wednesday afternoon 5 pm exactly. Got a table right away.  So note to those going from 4-6 the menu is extremely limited. They only have chicken and waffles and Mac and cheese, I believe something else was available but to only have two entrees and one side was a no go. I ended up ordering the chicken and bacon cheddar waffles and the tiger tiger wood y'all drink and a side of Mac. The waffles was good alone with the butter they provided. The chicken was ok I needed a lil more seasoning. The drink wasn't for me. I love cocktails that are more on the sweet side this drunk isn't that at all. The Mac was bland in my opinion and I'm a Mac and cheese fanatic. If your looking for chicken and waffles come here since it's their staple but the menu is somewhat limited.",3.0
"Maybe I should've stuck to the signature chicken & waffles. My review is based solely on the shrimp & grits - which was equivalent to tomato soup. The waitress did take it off the bill, no questions asked, so I appreciate the customer service here - but have to say, I didn't enjoy my meal. We asked for a side bowl of just grits because it was so soupy. Even that didn't help. The vibe is great. Our waitress was ok - but will come back for their signature waffles.",3.0

"Good, but not great food. The service and ambience are worth a visit, and this is a stellar place to grab a few cocktails, but again, the food is a bit underwhelming. The portions here are generous, and the menu is perfect for sharing, but none of the items I tried really stood out. The fried chicken is juicy and crisp, but other than an overwhelming taste of sage, there really isn't much in the way of seasoning. The chicken and waffles are the staple dish here, and they are worth ordering, but you'll need a generous dousing of maple syrup and hot sauce to get a helping of flavor. The sides are fairly standard, but the collard and carrot slaw is delicious, and is both unique and exceptional in comparison to the basics like the mac and cheese or hominy Brussels sprouts. The cocktail menu is solid and worth making your way through. My only comment would be that there should be a few more drinks with bourbon to choose from since the menu is Southern inspired. This is a fun place to check out and the service is stellar considering how busy it gets. The atmosphere is nice and people watching can be fun, but you may have to wait a while for a table depending on when you arrive. Sweet Chick provides a good dining experience that will give you a fix if you're on the hunt for Southern cooking or a place to grab a solid cocktail; I give it 3.5 stars, but that may trend upward once I give their brunch a try.",3.0

"Quite a popular place on Bedford Ave - one of the arteries of Williamsburg alongside cute vintage shops and cafés. When me and small group of friends arrived, we had to wait for 30 minutes to be seated so we strolled the avenue to kill time. Once we were seated, I knew exactly what I wanted - the chicken and waffles - while my friends opted for other brunch choices (and all look delicious!). The waffles were soft (not chewy) and buttery soaking up the syrup and chicken to perfection. And the chicken was lightly seasoned which made this meal quite balanced.

"Sweet Chick is the kind of place you go to if you want to eat food made with different ingredients. No ""Apple"" or ""Beet"" here, so go somewhere else with that, you unrefined philistine.

No charge. We had chicken and waffles and $4 root beers! If you're a prisoner on death row, there are plenty of worse last meals to request. Why I have a hard time shading in that last orange star is because I believe that serving waffles without a butter option, is almost a finable offence.

It was your standard kale salad.This was not a phenomenal brunch nor meal. The next time I have a craving for fried chicken or kale salad, I'll head to Joseph Leonard. I'm glad to have tried Sweet Chick but wouldn't go back again unless there was no wait. The service was lacking. Our party of 3 only had 2 water glasses.

"Checked out Sweet Chick Williamsburg this weekend with two friends. After arriving, I noticed how small the restaurant was inside, which can probably accommodate parties no larger than six people.  After adding a name to the wait list to be seated, the hostess informed us that we could not sit until the full party was present, which is standard in NYC and more than reasonable for Sunday brunch. An hour passed before our friend arrived; however, we now had to wait even longer since there was no table available...My friend got the silent treatment for a good twenty minutes after showing up so late...WE WERE STARVING!We ended up getting seated at the bar, which worked out better since we received prompt service. Two of us ordered the chicken and waffle...to sum it up..juicy, crispy, golden brown chicken, but a little under seasoned. And light, flaky tasty waffles.  My other friend ordered the Benny Eggs...it looked delicious!  The mimosas were strong and the peach ice tea sweetened with bourbon was okay..nothing to write home about.The ambiance of the place is upbeat with background music and an eclectic crowd.Overall, I enjoyed the food, crowd and ambiance. I would return if I was in the area, but I would not go out of my way to make a trip there.",4.0
"Have to say this place makes the best fried chicken I've ever had. The breaking is perfectly flaky, right amount if crunchy, and not too greasy--meat is super juicy and tender. The waffles are fantastic too--I've had the plain ones at brunch time and the bacon cheddar at dinner. That being said, it's pretty pricey. About $3-4 dollars more than I would have liked. Everything else is definitely good, but the star meal is clearly the chicken and waffles. Expect a wait almost always--we got brunch out of sheer luck, there was a cancellation just as we arrived.",4.0
Came here for breakfast with the family and I absolutely loved the food. I had the chicken and waffles. The waffle was light and fluffy but very flavorful. The chicken was juicy... I added hot sauce for extra flavor. The maple bacon was very sweet but sticky due to the fact it was cooked with maple syrup. I will definitely come back here!,4.0
"Delicious. So happy I finally got to this place. My mom got pork sandwich with fries and really enjoyed it. Also got the chicken and waffles. Best waffle I've ever had.

"What a horrible experience! From being told repeatedly that they would give our table for eight away while our party arrived in separate cabs (even though the restaurant wasn't full) to being told they sold out of beer and soft drinks at an earlier function.  Then being told in the most condescending tone  ever ""we're not a BYOB restaurant"" when we asked if we could go across the street and purchase beer for one of our party that doesn't drink cocktails. We wouldn't have asked if the restaurant was stocked as it should be to accommodate a full range of drink options. We were told this was an amazing place with great food and what we got was a rude hostess, an arrogant waitress, and mediocre food ( I had an unrecognizable piece of chicken that was nearly burnt on the outside -I later discovered it was a piece of a breast as a full breast was not on offer). Perhaps I missed something but I thought restaurants were about full experiences that provide great service, ambiance, and most importantly great food. Not the case last night, not at all. Sweet chick was in fact not sweet at all but rather left a sour taste in all of our mouths. Save the cab fare and go somewhere that actually wants your business,values your spend, and is stocked appropriately for trade on a Saturday night!",1.0
"Popped in here with my hubby for a late lunch around 4 on Saturday. It was an impulsive stop in. I wasn't impressed.Waitress gave us drink menus only. When I asked for a food menu, she told us it was chicken and waffles only until dinner service. Ok. Asked how much that would cost and was told $16. Ordered 2 plates.My husband had tap water and I got the Arnold Palmer's with seltzer in it (made by Brooklyn Soda Works exclusively for Sweet Chick). My Arnold Palmer's was just ok -it tasted more like a lemon tea with seltzer, not very sweet. My husband's tap water was warm. Annoying.The chicken was also warm. Not hot. I didn't like the skin, it tasted pretty plain with a little heat to it. I had to go to the bar to ask for salt. They had many salt shakers behind the bar and none on the tables. Annoying.I ate only one piece of chicken and one fourth of the waffle. To be fair, the waffle was good, but it's not enough to make me come back. I feel like I paid $16 for a waffle, because the chicken was so boring and unflavorful. They also gave us a teeny tiny portion of butter. Less. Than. A. Pat. Could you spare it? I couldn't be bothered to ask for more, I was just done. Annoyed.I only tipped 15% and I never do that.I'm confounded by the reviews. Some people are saying this is the best chicken they've ever had. Go eat more fried chicken. I speak from a place of love. You deserve better. You are sitting on a soundstage, telling Maury you love this chicken, and I am in the audience shaking my head at you.",2.0
"It's a cute little place in a great location of brooklyn , however , it was my first time going there today & the service absolutely sucked . for it to be such a small place , i have no idea why and server was absent 95% of the time , and when i needed something i had to flag her down , it was ridiculous . i had the ""sweet chick"" drink which was pretty good , and the mac & cheese . This isn't a place where you could sit and hang out for a while because the chairs are extremely uncomfortable , pretty much food up chairs like the ones they used to put in the auditorium in high school . Their dessert menu looked interesting but by the time my waitress finally came back over my plate was sitting in front of me for about an hour and i just wanted to get out of there at that point . i won't be going back",1.0
Great food great place.I had to ask them for the window table since I wanted to be able to see my bicycle. There was a lot of people but they still managed to give me that table. Of course I've ordered the chicken and waffles and a beer. I really like the flavored butter that the give you with the chicken.Services is also very nice and friendly. Overall a great place.,4.0
"I came here on a Sunday after church with 3 of my friends. We got there kind of late, around 5, so the menu was limited because the menu is limited between 4-6 pm; however it was still amazing! My friends and I all ordered fried chicken with classic waffles and Mac & cheese. Everything was seasoned beautifully!!! And the service was lovely. This is definitely my new spot! It's a very small space, but intimate nonetheless and I love the old, southern, rustic theme. I can rave about this place for hours. I will recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable, scrumptious, new location!",5.0
"I went to Sweet Chick this past weekend (11/2) for Brunch. There was an hour wait but they call your cell when your table is ready, so you can explore the Bedford ave area while you wait. Overall, I was thoroughly impressed by the food and ambiance. I got the Chicken and Waffles with a side of the maple glazed bacon and a Ramona Spritzer. The chicken was completely unreal--seasoned perfectly. I'm not a big waffle person, but the waffles were delicious. Very soft and fluffy.Others at my table got the Shrimp and Grits (looked amazing) and the Eggs Benny.Why did I give 4 stars?: -The eggs benny was too savory and while the flavors were good, did not amount to a great brunch meal. It would be great for dinner though.- The waitress did not split our cards properly, which in the end turned out okay. However, splitting a bill evenly 4 ways should be relatively simple - My friend was charged twice --i don't know if this was the restaurant's fault or a glitch Overall, a great restaurant and a must try!!!!",4.0

An hour passed before our friend arrived; however, we now had to wait even longer since there was no table available...My friend got the silent treatment for a good twenty minutes after showing up so late...WE WERE STARVING!We ended up getting seated at the bar, which worked out better since we received prompt service. Two of us ordered the chicken and waffle...to sum it up..juicy, crispy, golden brown chicken, but a little under seasoned. And light, flaky tasty waffles.  My other friend ordered the Benny Eggs...it looked delicious!  The mimosas were strong and the peach ice tea sweetened with bourbon was okay..nothing to write home about.The ambiance of the place is upbeat with background music and an eclectic crowd.Overall, I enjoyed the food, crowd and ambiance. I would return if I was in the area, but I would not go out of my way to make a trip there.",4.0
"Have to say this place makes the best fried chicken I've ever had. The breaking is perfectly flaky, right amount if crunchy, and not too greasy--meat is super juicy and tender. The waffles are fantastic too--I've had the plain ones at brunch time and the bacon cheddar at dinner. That being said, it's pretty pricey. About $3-4 dollars more than I would have liked. Everything else is definitely good, but the star meal is clearly the chicken and waffles. Expect a wait almost always--we got brunch out of sheer luck, there was a cancellation just as we arrived.",4.0
Came here for breakfast with the family and I absolutely loved the food. I had the chicken and waffles. The waffle was light and fluffy but very flavorful. The chicken was juicy... I added hot sauce for extra flavor. The maple bacon was very sweet but sticky due to the fact it was cooked with maple syrup. I will definitely come back here!,4.0
"Delicious. So happy I finally got to this place. My mom got pork sandwich with fries and really enjoyed it. Also got the chicken and waffles. Best waffle I've ever had. The maple syrup is great and the 3 butters were lovely. I really liked the herb butter. Highly recommend. Kind of pricy for 2 with dishes, tea, and tip whole bill was about $40.",5.0
"What a horrible experience! From being told repeatedly that they would give our table for eight away while our party arrived in separate cabs (even though the restaurant wasn't full) to being told they sold out of beer and soft drinks at an earlier function.  Then being told in the most condescending tone  ever ""we're not a BYOB restaurant"" when we asked if we could go across the street and purchase beer for one of our party that doesn't drink cocktails. We wouldn't have asked if the restaurant was stocked as it should be to accommodate a full range of drink options. We were told this was an amazing place with great food and what we got was a rude hostess, an arrogant waitress, and mediocre food ( I had an unrecognizable piece of chicken that was nearly burnt on the outside -I later discovered it was a piece of a breast as a full breast was not on offer). Perhaps I missed something but I thought restaurants were about full experiences that provide great service, ambiance, and most importantly great food. Not the case last night, not at all. Sweet chick was in fact not sweet at all but rather left a sour taste in all of our mouths. Save the cab fare and go somewhere that actually wants your business,values your spend, and is stocked appropriately for trade on a Saturday night!",1.0
"Popped in here with my hubby for a late lunch around 4 on Saturday. It was an impulsive stop in. I wasn't impressed.Waitress gave us drink menus only. When I asked for a food menu, she told us it was chicken and waffles only until dinner service. Ok. Asked how much that would cost and was told $16. Ordered 2 plates.My husband had tap water and I got the Arnold Palmer's with seltzer in it (made by Brooklyn Soda Works exclusively for Sweet Chick). My Arnold Palmer's was just ok -it tasted more like a lemon tea with seltzer, not very sweet. My husband's tap water was warm. Annoying.The chicken was also warm. Not hot. I didn't like the skin, it tasted pretty plain with a little heat to it. I had to go to the bar to ask for salt. They had many salt shakers behind the bar and none on the tables. Annoying.I ate only one piece of chicken and one fourth of the waffle. To be fair, the waffle was good, but it's not enough to make me come back. I feel like I paid $16 for a waffle, because the chicken was so boring and unflavorful. They also gave us a teeny tiny portion of butter. Less. Than. A. Pat. Could you spare it? I couldn't be bothered to ask for more, I was just done. Annoyed.I only tipped 15% and I never do that.I'm confounded by the reviews. Some people are saying this is the best chicken they've ever had. Go eat more fried chicken. I speak from a place of love. You deserve better. You are sitting on a soundstage, telling Maury you love this chicken, and I am in the audience shaking my head at you.",2.0
"It's a cute little place in a great location of brooklyn , however , it was my first time going there today & the service absolutely sucked . for it to be such a small place , i have no idea why and server was absent 95% of the time , and when i needed something i had to flag her down , it was ridiculous . i had the ""sweet chick"" drink which was pretty good , and the mac & cheese . This isn't a place where you could sit and hang out for a while because the chairs are extremely uncomfortable , pretty much food up chairs like the ones they used to put in the auditorium in high school . Their dessert menu looked interesting but by the time my waitress finally came back over my plate was sitting in front of me for about an hour and i just wanted to get out of there at that point . i won't be going back",1.0
Great food great place.I had to ask them for the window table since I wanted to be able to see my bicycle. There was a lot of people but they still managed to give me that table. Of course I've ordered the chicken and waffles and a beer. I really like the flavored butter that the give you with the chicken.Services is also very nice and friendly. Overall a great place.,4.0
"I came here on a Sunday after church with 3 of my friends. We got there kind of late, around 5, so the menu was limited because the menu is limited between 4-6 pm; however it was still amazing! My friends and I all ordered fried chicken with classic waffles and Mac & cheese. Everything was seasoned beautifully!!! And the service was lovely. This is definitely my new spot! It's a very small space, but intimate nonetheless and I love the old, southern, rustic theme. I can rave about this place for hours. I will recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable, scrumptious, new location!",5.0
"I went to Sweet Chick this past weekend (11/2) for Brunch. There was an hour wait but they call your cell when your table is ready, so you can explore the Bedford ave area while you wait. Overall, I was thoroughly impressed by the food and ambiance. I got the Chicken and Waffles with a side of the maple glazed bacon and a Ramona Spritzer. The chicken was completely unreal--seasoned perfectly. I'm not a big waffle person, but the waffles were delicious. Very soft and fluffy.Others at my table got the Shrimp and Grits (looked amazing) and the Eggs Benny.Why did I give 4 stars?: -The eggs benny was too savory and while the flavors were good, did not amount to a great brunch meal. It would be great for dinner though.- The waitress did not split our cards properly, which in the end turned out okay. However, splitting a bill evenly 4 ways should be relatively simple - My friend was charged twice --i don't know if this was the restaurant's fault or a glitch Overall, a great restaurant and a must try!!!!",4.0
"Sweet Chick is spreading taste the BK way by way of Southern cooking.  SC is a great place for brunch and southern fixins.  Being raised in the south it is hard to find a solid southern influenced meal, so I am always on the prowl.  I have been here a few times, so I will not present to you the following pros and cons of the SC experience:Pros:Variety of optionsPortionAtmosphere BrunchChicken and Waffles The GeneralMac & CheeseSlider VarietyHours Proximity to public transportationCons:The wait can be downright horrible ranging from 45 minutes to 2 hours on the regular for brunch.  Waiting for extremely long times grinds my gears.  The host staff is friendly, however they sometimes over exaggerates the wait time.  The positive thing about the wait is the implementation of the good old call back method.  Since SC is centrally located there are many other watering holes or creep options while you wait to be summoned.  Like any decent place in BK once the hype has been administered and social media has spread the word it can put a damper on the experience for a person who just wants to have a decent sit down without all the maxi-dress and sidewalk purchased fedora crowd clogging up the works",4.0

"Finally got try this place and it did not disappoint. The decor, the vibe and the food were all on point! We ordered the bacon cheddar waffle, Mac &cheese and a bottle of red wine.

This is a great spot for a date or to share stories with friends over some bomb fried chicken. Will most definitely be back!",4.0
"This was my second visit over a period of a few years. And this was the best of those two. Maybe it was because I was intoxicated, but I can honestly say the fried chicken beat out any I've had in a very long time; pretty much in as long as I can remember. Hushpuppies, kale/bacon salad, steak and fries, plus ""buffalo fried chicken"" all were awesome, but that damn fried chicken is the real deal. Tender and yet crisp skin, well seasoned, flavorful, and juicy on the inside without being undercooked. This is no small feat, way to go!",5.0
I knew from other reviews that it would be good. And Sweet Chick did not disappoint. A short wait to get a table but well with it. Shrimp and Grits and Chicken and Waffles were amazing. Will make it a regular stop whenever I'm in Brooklyn.,5.0
"Meh - had such high expectations for Sweet Chick! Especially since I dragged my lilB all the way out to Brooklyn for his second time ever (first time was when I dragged him to Peter Luger's - THAT was way worth it).I had great initial impressions of Sweet Chick - from their large airy windows, to their unique menu offerings, and their fantastic Happy Hour cocktail of the day. We went with an order of the chicken & waffles, chicken bucket, and fried oysters to start, with mac n cheese on the side.The oysters and mac came out first - and was a great starter to our meal. The mac is TDF delicious; we had to control ourselves from gorging on that and only that. The chicken finally came out and it was...lukewarm. Hello?! Why is my FRIED chicken not piping hot? Was it sitting under a lamp until they deemed it was time to bring it out? Sadness :( I also thought the chicken skin was a bit mushy (for lack of better adjective) and reminded me of (gasp) KFC! Super disappointing.We closed out our meal with 2 Purple Dranks - which were alright. We hesitated asking about the temperature of the chicken but just let it go. If it came out hot, this review might have been drastically different. For now - 3 stars for the bomb diggity mac n cheese and their happy hour libations!",3.0

"Adore this place ! Went her last nite for hubby's birthday. Didn't noticed how small the place was, very tight and cozy but well worth the wait. Only had to wait 15-20 mins to be seated which is not bad for a Saturday night. Me n hubby ordered the Mac n Cheese as an appetizer. AMAZING!!! Different take on the traditional Mac n Cheese, using shells instead of elbows and all white cheeses. Extremely creamy and buttery, especially with the ritz cracker crust. The shells still had a bite to it also, wasn't overcooked. As entrees I ordered the Bacon & Cheddar Waffles with Fried Chicken. Again, AMAZING!!!! The syrup along with the savory taste of bacon and cheddar was phenomenal. Kudos to whoever came up   with this combo.  The fried chicken was perfection, well seasoned and peppery. Hubby enjoyed his shrimp and grits, wasn't talking much during the meal which is always a good thing (LOL). They also wasn't skimpy on the shrimps, numerous juicy and large shrimps. Waitress and Hostess was very personable. Great atmosphere, AMAZING food! So what the hell you waiting for ? Take ya ass to Sweet Chicken, trust you won't be disappointed !",5.0
A pricey chicken and waffles joint on Bedford. Caught a little attitude from the hostess because we didnt want to be put in the corner.

So I ended up having to pay $15 for two simple fried eggs. So aggravating. On top of that, our waitress was far from helpful. She looked annoyed when I asked for more water and hot sauce. I will definitely not be going back.",1.0

"I went for brunch today with my best friend around 11:45 am. We were seated right away since there was a blizzard going on outside so the place was practically empty. It did fill up quickly despite the snow and low temps. We both ordered the cheddar bacon waffles and friend chicken with the peach ice tea (sweetened). I added some more sugar to my ice tea because it still had an unsweetened taste. I probably used 8 packets of sugar and the lemon to get it to my desired taste. My friend did not like the iced tea. She tried to add brown sugar but still it did nothing. She did not drink the iced tea at all. I loved the waffles and chicken. I really don't have any complaints. I added some hot sauce which made the chicken taste even better. I really liked the waffles. It was very different. My friend said the waffles were ok, she tasted waffles with a cinnamon taste somewhere else which she liked better but she did like the chicken. There are 3 kinds of flavored butter which was ok, nothing special but nice. I will definitely be back but I hate to admit I was still hungry after I ate.",5.0

The sloppy joes were quite small for $9, but decent. A bit of duck flavor with the sloppy wet consistency.The fried chicken was two small pieces. Although being tasty, they were luke warm to room temperature. Quite disappointing. The waffles were well made with three different types of butter.

I love their drinks & service is great.  Their food is good.  I think this place is worth going to for the experience but nothing stands out.  I'd go back here again.,3.0
"Walking in, this looked like a great local restaurant with wooden benches, chalk board menus on the wall, etc. There's a decent beer selection along with specials. We ordered the yellow beans (turned out to be green beans) and duck sloppy joe sliders. The beans were really well made with a good amount of fat and salt. The sloppy joes were quite small for $9, but decent. A bit of duck flavor with the sloppy wet consistency.The fried chicken was two small pieces. Although being tasty, they were luke warm to room temperature. Quite disappointing. The waffles were well made with three different types of butter. For two appetizers and a side for 2 of us, it was around $41 w/ tax and tip.A bit pricey for what they offered.",2.0

"Came here with a group for a quick small bite and cocktails.Food: waffles and assortment of butters was great! The chicken was average. This is one if those places that seasons chicken by dredging in a mixture of flour, salt, pepper, paprika marinated in buttermilk--that won't cut it for excellent chicken. The skin has ""flavor"" but not the actual chicken.Drinks: above average.",3.0
"YES! Best Chicken 'N Waffles in NY. The waffles were so deliciously fluffy, and not too sweet. I hate when places make the waffle taste like sugar. The chicken was so crispy and juicy, with hints of pepper and paprika. Definitely a must try! I also ordered the Chilaquiles, but I wasn't a fan. The wait was pretty long on a Sunday morning, but you'll find that anywhere in the city. Awesome! Definitely going back.",5.0
The chicken and waffles are the best I have EVER had:) The chicken is crispy and fresh and the waffles with the strip and 3 butters add so much to the meal! I love their Bloody Mary's too and ALL their cocktails are amazing!,5.0
"Just tried it for the first time. Really good but kinda pricey. For appetizers we had the scallops and the pork sliders. Both delicious. I had the fried chicken with bacon and cheddar waffles and a biscuit. Also delicious! The food was pretty much spot on. The waiter was pretty nice too, I was unsure of what beer to get and he gave me a little bit of the beer to try in a small cup. Thought that was very nice. My husband had the ""tiger tiger woods y'all"" drink which tasted awesome and was strong. Good experience here.",4.0
"This is place was nice, service was good. Wait time was on not bad at all. They call you when they have a table ready which was pretty prompt on exact time (our wait time was 45mins). Food was great eggs Benny definitely a must try. Chicken and waffles were good, I had better waffles. Chicken batter was good and very crisp. I give it four stars because price wise, for the chicken and waffles not worth 16 bucks especially if we are only getting two pieces of chicken and the waffle selection is limited.",4.0
"We wondered into Sweet Chick randomly looking for late night eats and they're kitchen is open pretty late. Even though it was 11:00pm on a Saturday night, the place was nearly packed. The hostess sat us at the bar and the bartender was super friendly and served us quickly. I wish they had more beers on tap but that's minor. We got the IPA on tap and a Sweet Chick cocktail (watermelon juice, lemon juice, vodka), which was really strong and full of watermelon flavor! Decor was very down to earth and hipster. There were benches and a lot of wood, very reminiscent of southern decor. The front also opened outdoor which was awesome for great spring/summer nights. We ordered the mac and cheese, one vegetarian fried chicken with waffles and an order of the fried chicken bucket. We shared the mac and cheese, which was delicious, very cheesy and it melted in my mouth! It was enough for both of us to share as an appetizer. As a vegetarian, I never if ever get the opportunity to have faux fried chicken and their rendition was fantastic. It was crispy, warm and super savory. I was full on one piece and took the other home. Waffles were warm but I wish they were crisper and sweeter. My boyfriend raved about the fried chicken and kept thanking the bartender for the awesome chicken (could have been all the alcohol he had though). I left very satisfied! A definite try for vegetarians especially!",4.0
"Came to this gem and had awesome chicken n waffles! Not your average...hidden in Williamsburg amidst a few other eateries.  We enjoyed the Tiger Woods drink and the duck sliders to start, which were absolutely amazeballz! Talk about tender?!

Food 5 stars! Service 0 stars.  Been putting up with the terrible service because I'm seriously obsessed with the Mac and cheese and fried chicken.  After my last visit this Friday I'm throwing in the towel. Waited about 30 mins for a drink so I went up to the bar to see if I could speed this up somehow. The place was not crowded at all as it was around 11pm. They basically told me to wait for the waitress. The worst part is that was the so called manager. I come there regularly so it was very disappointing to be treated that way. That's a big trend in Williamsburg now....these new hipster restaurants with zero service.  I will no longer support places like this. Much rather give to the mom and pops that appreciate your business.,3.0

"HELL YES. This place knows exactly how to perfect chicken and waffles. I came here for brunch last Saturday with my boyfriend (it was his first time trying chicken and waffles) and both of our tummies were beyond satisfied. The waffles are crunchy on the outside, yet thick, moist, and light on the inside. The chicken was also phenomenal. Salty with tons of flavor, and meaty, too! The three choices of butter were on-point as well. The place was really noisy, so I couldn't exactly hear the waiter when he described each of the butters, but one was an herb butter, another was lemon butter, and the last one was some sort of berry butter. I drenched my chicken and waffles in all three, and each one was delectable. Also, THEY TAKE CREDIT CARDS!!!! HALLELUJAH! I love me some cute Brooklyn-based restaurants that aren't ""cash only."" I'm definitely coming back here again.",5.0
"Sweet Chick has amazing food in a convenient location with friendly servers and a nicely-done space. Just do yourself a favor and branch out a bit, because while their chicken and waffles are all really excellent (and the variety of butters that you get are a sweet little bonus), they're certainly not the best place to go in the neighborhood for chicken and waffles (See: Brooklyn Star, Pies & Thies, Sweet Science). Try some of the other menu items - unless you're a vegetarian. In that case, marvel at how awesome their vegetarian chicken and waffles are! (I actually prefer them to the meat version.)",4.0

Waited about 30 mins for a drink so I went up to the bar to see if I could speed this up somehow. The place was not crowded at all as it was around 11pm. They basically told me to wait for the waitress. The worst part is that was the so called manager. I come there regularly so it was very disappointing to be treated that way. That's a big trend in Williamsburg now....these new hipster restaurants with zero service.  I will no longer support places like this. Much rather give to the mom and pops that appreciate your business.,3.0
"Perfect this place rocks. It was a 45 min break but the place is awesome. Love it there the ambiance, decor & the food amazing. Sweeeet love love. The food was delicious & very quick to receive my waiter was amazing she got 10.00 tip just because. New brunch spot. I love sweet chick  management great job !!!",5.0
Came on a Friday when it was a bit quieter than I've seen it on weekends and was impressed with the staple chicken and waffle dish - waffles were excellent !,4.0
"The public school style cafeteria seating was a nice change of seating. The boozy sweet tea was decent. Me and my friend both had the chicken and waffles and while it was not the best that I had, it was not the absolute worst. Overall it was an ok dining experience.",2.0
This is some good fried chicken. I am not a fan of the family style dining that seems so popular in North BK but the chicken is pretty damn good.,4.0
"HELL YES. This place knows exactly how to perfect chicken and waffles. I came here for brunch last Saturday with my boyfriend (it was his first time trying chicken and waffles) and both of our tummies were beyond satisfied. The waffles are crunchy on the outside, yet thick, moist, and light on the inside. The chicken was also phenomenal. Salty with tons of flavor, and meaty, too! The three choices of butter were on-point as well. The place was really noisy, so I couldn't exactly hear the waiter when he described each of the butters, but one was an herb butter, another was lemon butter, and the last one was some sort of berry butter. I drenched my chicken and waffles in all three, and each one was delectable. Also, THEY TAKE CREDIT CARDS!!!! HALLELUJAH! I love me some cute Brooklyn-based restaurants that aren't ""cash only."" I'm definitely coming back here again.",5.0
"Sweet Chick has amazing food in a convenient location with friendly servers and a nicely-done space. Just do yourself a favor and branch out a bit, because while their chicken and waffles are all really excellent (and the variety of butters that you get are a sweet little bonus), they're certainly not the best place to go in the neighborhood for chicken and waffles (See: Brooklyn Star, Pies & Thies, Sweet Science). Try some of the other menu items - unless you're a vegetarian. In that case, marvel at how awesome their vegetarian chicken and waffles are! (I actually prefer them to the meat version.)",4.0
"Where to start? The whole experience was amazing.  I guess I'll begin at the meal. We ordered for a party of three. Two different versions of the Chicken and Waffles and the Skirt Steak. All three were amazeballz!  No seriously... They were so good you would slap you momma to get more.   Don't tell her I said that. We all ended up sharing bites. There was plenty to go around. The portion sizes were generous enough to satisfy my big eating boyfriend. For an appetizer we ordered the elotes style  corn and hominy Brussels sprouts. Delicious!The staff was friendly and helpful. They had some great recommendations for cocktails. The Purple Drank was our favorite, but the sweet tea tasted great too.",5.0
This place is EVERYTHING!!! Outstanding food + service + ambiance!!! Benny is the angel that turns this place into PARADISE!!!,5.0
"The chicken was nicely seasoned and tasted like it was brined well but the waffle was one of the most light and airy I have ever tasted.  The place has become very popular on weekends so the wait can be about 20 minutes or more. I hope they open a second or larger location. The music is very loud too so it was a little hard tho hear my friend talking. They should play more country music too rather than hip-hop.  I even asked the staff to turn down the music, which they barely did. But overall good food, just wish it was a little more comfortable. I'll try to go back during the week.",3.0
"Sweet Chick is a solid restaurant.  Here are my TIPS for eating here:- This place gets super busy.  So if you're coming on the weekend, opt for an off-time (I arrived at 3pm for a table for 2 and there was no wait).  If you do have to wait, there are a couple benches out front.  That are likely already taken.- The space is very small, communal tables or the squished two-tops where you have to 'pull out' the table so you can get into the seat.  Don't bring 10 shopping bags (like the girl sitting next to me).- There are specials on the chalkboard in the back, take a lookie, because when it's busy (or even when it's just kinda busy), the waitresses just aint got time to tell you what they is.- Order the chicken and waffles.  Why would you ever consider ordering anything else?- When you DO order them, it comes with three tasty different butters.  I don't recommend slathering them all on at the same time (one is herb, one is sweet, and one is a fruit kind.  All great individually, but not altogether.  Don't get too excited.. like me).- Fine, if you do consider something else, get the biscuit sandwich.  The biscuits are made RIGHT here.- There are two restrooms in the backGreat food, good service.  I liked this place and am glad I came.  Sweeeeet.",5.0
"Alright, I have not been able to find chicken and waffles as good as Sweet Chicks. I found this place while researching for restaurants to try on our NY trip.  I came here with my bf and cousins and we all got the chicken and waffles and I kid you not, we all licked our plate clean. From the perfectly fluffy waffles to the crispy on the outside yet tender on the inside fried chicken, this place is legit.  Don't let the hipster facade fool you, they know what they're doing. It is pricey (it was $16 when we went) and you're going to think I can get just as good and cheaper chicken and waffles in Harlem, yes you're absolutely right, but you won't be able to enjoy a stroll to the pier and enjoying the nice NYC skyline after your meal.",5.0

"I never got to eat here so this review has nothing to do with food. I brought my 9 year old daughter and wife here for weekend brunch. No tables were available so i asked the b*tchy hostess if we could sit and eat at the bar. She pulled a lie right out of her butt. ""Its illegal for a child to sit at the bar"". I was so dumbfounded by this that I didn't even argue with her. We just walked out. I will never try to eat here again and recommend anyone who appreciates manners or kindness stay far away. DO NOT COME HERE WITH KIDS. THEY DONT LIKE THEM.FYI: it is NOT illegal for a child to eat at the bar with their parents.",1.0
"It's pretty difficult to find a place that does chicken and waffles well. You always get either or. And in this case, the waffles are so good here! Light, fluffy amazing waffles. But the chicken was seriously lacking. The batter was pretty bad and overly fried to a crisp. In a bad way. Was pretty disappointed and the search continues....",3.0
"Best thing I had all week! We had the chicken and waffles and the shrimp and grits. I have never had chicken and waffles so decided it was time to try it.. And if this is how it should taste then I'm hooked. The chicken was very moist and flavorful and with hot sauce added it became this fabulous fusion in my mouth. Loved the variety of flavored butters it came with. Now shrimp and grits is my thing- love it, this one made my pallet happy the grits were so cheese and tasty, the shrimp was well seasoned along wit the sauce, the poached egg on top made the dish. The host was very friendly and polite made me want to come back and I will..",4.0
"MMM...MMM.MMMM!!!!!!  So good!  Cheese grits the best I ever had!!!!  The fried chicken flavorful and crispy.  My margarita was nice and strong and all the different butter options were yummy too!!!  The waffle was so light and delicious but it was not HOT.  I am always so hesitant to get waffles when I go out because I'm always worried about that, but chicken and waffles are great together.  I'll make sure the next time I go back, that I request for my waffle to be nice and hot!!!!!Oh and the music was on point and our server Holly was great!!!!!!",4.0

"We wandered around Brooklyn all day just enjoying the beautiful weather and before we knew it... It was 10pm and we were starving. We happened to walk by Sweet Chick and decided to check it out. Boy was that a great decision! After burning hundreds of calories walking the city streets, of course chicken and waffles is the best idea for a late dinner.He had the sloppy duck sliders to start, and licked his fingers clean when he finished them! I had the classic ""chicken"" and waffles - yep! Faux chicken is available *happy dance*I have to say - amazing. Carnivorous friend couldn't even tell it wasn't real chicken!

"Cute little open, airy spot. The service was excellent - each person was welcoming and very nice. That isn't always the case on Bedford. The waiter was helpful with describing the drinks. I got a 21st amendment watermelon wheat beer that was perfect for summer. My boo got a bloody mary with a big delicious piece of bacon on it. The bacon was better than the bloody, but I mean who didn't expect that?We split the Chicken and Waffles and the Kale salad. I know, I know, Kale salad?? But honestly it was awesome. The dressing was lemony and creamy and there was bacon on it. Big slabs of non-salady bacon. Bacon is a vegetable, right? Sure it is.The chicken was crisoy on the outside with a strong delicious rosemary flavor. The inside was moist (dont you just hate that word? but it was) and yummy. The waffles, which I usually don't care for, were fluffy and tasty. They didn't even need butter or syrup. We split some cheese grits, which were also nice.This place exceeded my expecations.

"I've been dying to come here, and they definitely didn't disappoint!! The meal looks overwhelming but once you start, it's do delicious you can't stop! The waffles are so light and fluffy, they come with 3 butters; an herb, honey lemon and a berry. I had the original chicken and waffles, I tried all 3 butters but the berry was my favorite ( funny enough that was the one I was most skeptical about). The hot sauce was great on the chicken, which was deliciously seasoned and so moist. I washed it all down with a seasonal watermelon beer, which was so good I bought a six pack from a nearby bodega. Highly recommend and I'm definitely coming back with my friend and boyfriend. No regrets, everything was amazing. P.S. The pork sliders were delish!

I had the choice of bourbon or vodka, feeling adventurous I chose bourbon. I like bourbon just not in a bloody marry. The bacon and pepper garnish was a nice touch.   I found the entire experience to be good. I will return for dinner, so I will be able to try the deserts and Mac and cheese.",5.0
"Food & Cocktails were great! The pork belly appetizer made my night and would have given 5 stars, however, I felt the portions were pretty small. We tried splitting the blackened chicken and grits waffles, and I hate to say, I left a little hungry.",4.0

I just visited New York City for the first time this last weekend and could not help but walk into this gem in Williamsburg. I've been to a similar restaurant in San Francisco called The Front Porch and boy both are equally as amazing. What sets Sweet Chick aside is it's hip hop playlist that I absolutely fell in love with. The environment is definitely unique and who can forget the Asian fusion chicken and waffles? Fantastic. Do not think twice about checking this place out. It is definitely a place I'll be back at.,4.0

Pros: Some amazing fried chicken. Juicy and just the right amount of breading. The collard green coleslaw is very good. Get an order of the biscuits too. The drinks are very tasty and not weak. The star of the meal was the fried oysters with bacon; amazing. The waffles are extremely soft and delicious. Con: I wished they had mashed potatoes. Also I couldn't substitute my collard greens for veggies. Pulled pork was average. Overall: I would definitely go back for more.,4.0
"It seems I've kind of been on a fried chicken binge recently. It's cold now, so it's really in my best interest to gain a few extra ell-bees. I was hoping Sweet Chick would drive away the chicken blues that Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken gave me. It kind of did, but I have a few bones to pick. While the chicken was good - nothing mind-blowing, mind you - the two pieces you get with an order of chicken and waffles are sad and anemic. If I am paying $16, I better be getting at least two large and juicy pieces. The waffles were pretty standard and a necessary part of the meal, lest you leave completely famished.DO NOT EVEN CONSIDER ORDERING ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE CHICKEN HERE. Order the chicken and immediately put the menu down. I made the mistake of ordering the smoked pork hash. While the description sounded delicious, the outcome was anything but. It's been a long time since I've been somewhere where I've taken two bites of something and couldn't bring myself to eat anymore of it. Oh my god, the way they cooked that poor pig was blasphemous! Not only was it stringy and dry, but it was completely tasteless. And for whatever reason, my food was lukewarm? Even though the hash came in one of those crazy hot skillets that literally burn your skin off if you touch it! Clearly they had this sucker sitting around for awhile before serving it to me. Probably because nobody orders it. Avoid at all costs.",2.0
"We lucked up by getting a table in the open window on a warm sunny day! They were out of what I originally wanted, the shrimp and grits, and the the eggs benny, so I settled in the chicken and waffles. It was great! The chicken was crispy, flavorful and not greasy! The waffle was crispy but melted in my mouth! The bourbon peach tea was perfect!",4.0
"I would like to give this place more reviews, however, during the weekend they only have 3 items/meals you can choose after brunch and before dinner (the in between menu).

"Items selected:Chicken n' Waffles Carolina Cheese GritsSticky BunPastry Plate - Banana Bread, Corn Muffin, Asian Pear Coffee Cake, Pumpkin Cranberry Loaf, White Chocolate Cranberry SconeIced CoffeeLocated in one of the trendiest sections of already trendy Brooklyn it was just after 3pm when I met my sister from Chicago and a friend from Los Angeles at Sweet Chick for the first of many shared meals over the coming week.  Undoubtedly stylized, perhaps to the point of trying too hard with wooden picnic tables, Edison bulbs, chalk boards, mason jars, plus fanciful duds and suds all accounted for along with over-the-top aloofness from Damian, our server who first condescended to me about the pastry plate before bait-and-switching a sticky bun for the desired bread pudding, I think it can be said that the scene at Sweet Chick left much to be desired and leave it at that...and so how was the food?  Good but not great, the thick toothsome grits and coffee cake stealing the show from crispy chicken entirely reliant on syrup to make up for a lack of seasoning, though the quality of the meat itself was high.  A fine place to drink, see, and be seen there is simply far better food and service to be found throughout the five boroughs than to dedicate a meal to a place that doesn't seem sure it wants to be anything more than another hipster watering hole.",2.0

The restaurant atmosphere is nice; however, the food is rather lackluster.

The chicken was fine, seasoned well enough, the waffles were fine, I got classic,  put together and it was FINE. The corn bread was super cold and had whole corn kernels in it. The Arnold Palmer soda was probably the best thing I had though it was made by some side company... And I would have preferred Lemonade or regular sweet tea.

"I went on a Saturday night around 7pm and had a reasonable wait for a table for 2. We had the hot honey fried chicken and apple cinnamon waffle. Both were spectacular! The waffle was light and well-spiced, while the chicken was very juicy and full of flavor. I think that this dish is a seasonal offering so I will be back to stuff my face before it's gone.

I'm fairly certain this is what's served for dessert in heaven.Sweet Chick also gets bonus points for playing great 90's music. It was an all-around great experience :)",5.0
Pros: Some amazing fried chicken. Juicy and just the right amount of breading. The collard green coleslaw is very good. Get an order of the biscuits too. The drinks are very tasty and not weak. The star of the meal was the fried oysters with bacon; amazing. The waffles are extremely soft and delicious. Con: I wished they had mashed potatoes. Also I couldn't substitute my collard greens for veggies. Pulled pork was average. Overall: I would definitely go back for more.,4.0
"It seems I've kind of been on a fried chicken binge recently. It's cold now, so it's really in my best interest to gain a few extra ell-bees. I was hoping Sweet Chick would drive away the chicken blues that Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken gave me. It kind of did, but I have a few bones to pick. While the chicken was good - nothing mind-blowing, mind you - the two pieces you get with an order of chicken and waffles are sad and anemic. If I am paying $16, I better be getting at least two large and juicy pieces. The waffles were pretty standard and a necessary part of the meal, lest you leave completely famished.DO NOT EVEN CONSIDER ORDERING ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE CHICKEN HERE. Order the chicken and immediately put the menu down. I made the mistake of ordering the smoked pork hash. While the description sounded delicious, the outcome was anything but. It's been a long time since I've been somewhere where I've taken two bites of something and couldn't bring myself to eat anymore of it. Oh my god, the way they cooked that poor pig was blasphemous! Not only was it stringy and dry, but it was completely tasteless. And for whatever reason, my food was lukewarm? Even though the hash came in one of those crazy hot skillets that literally burn your skin off if you touch it! Clearly they had this sucker sitting around for awhile before serving it to me. Probably because nobody orders it. Avoid at all costs.",2.0
"We lucked up by getting a table in the open window on a warm sunny day! They were out of what I originally wanted, the shrimp and grits, and the the eggs benny, so I settled in the chicken and waffles. It was great! The chicken was crispy, flavorful and not greasy! The waffle was crispy but melted in my mouth! The bourbon peach tea was perfect!",4.0
"I would like to give this place more reviews, however, during the weekend they only have 3 items/meals you can choose after brunch and before dinner (the in between menu). We chose to sit at the bar. The spot itself is super cute, the staff is attentive. I only had the mac and cheese, and it was tasty, but nothing to write home about. I suggest that you give it a shot. My friend had the chicken and waffles and she was happy. So, I will try that the next time.",3.0
"Items selected:Chicken n' Waffles Carolina Cheese GritsSticky BunPastry Plate - Banana Bread, Corn Muffin, Asian Pear Coffee Cake, Pumpkin Cranberry Loaf, White Chocolate Cranberry SconeIced CoffeeLocated in one of the trendiest sections of already trendy Brooklyn it was just after 3pm when I met my sister from Chicago and a friend from Los Angeles at Sweet Chick for the first of many shared meals over the coming week.  Undoubtedly stylized, perhaps to the point of trying too hard with wooden picnic tables, Edison bulbs, chalk boards, mason jars, plus fanciful duds and suds all accounted for along with over-the-top aloofness from Damian, our server who first condescended to me about the pastry plate before bait-and-switching a sticky bun for the desired bread pudding, I think it can be said that the scene at Sweet Chick left much to be desired and leave it at that...and so how was the food?  Good but not great, the thick toothsome grits and coffee cake stealing the show from crispy chicken entirely reliant on syrup to make up for a lack of seasoning, though the quality of the meat itself was high.  A fine place to drink, see, and be seen there is simply far better food and service to be found throughout the five boroughs than to dedicate a meal to a place that doesn't seem sure it wants to be anything more than another hipster watering hole.",2.0

"If you have ever taken a bite of some food and thought yyuummm... The mediocrity of this taste amazing then this is the place for you. The restaurant atmosphere is nice; however, the food is rather lackluster. I'm a Steel Magnolia type of girl (I love my big city with a tinge of magnolias, deep fried chicken and corn bread please lol) so I take chicken and waffles very seriously. The chicken was fine, seasoned well enough, the waffles were fine, I got classic,  put together and it was FINE. The corn bread was super cold and had whole corn kernels in it. The Arnold Palmer soda was probably the best thing I had though it was made by some side company... And I would have preferred Lemonade or regular sweet tea. If your looking for amazing(seriously) southern food and are willing to take a trip to Harlem ""Amy Ruth's is the truth!!- signed a chicken and lobster Mac and cheese type of girl (side of corn bread please :)",2.0
"I went on a Saturday night around 7pm and had a reasonable wait for a table for 2. We had the hot honey fried chicken and apple cinnamon waffle. Both were spectacular!

I didn't realize this place was a chicken & waffles place until I got here and my friend said it was probably the best chicken & waffles she ever had. I've enjoyed c&w in many places, but this was the best? I had to find out. I ended up trying the Sweet Chick Chicken & Waffles, and boy, let's just say it certainly did not disappoint. The cheddar and bacon waffle was perfectly light and balanced, and the fried chicken was pretty darn juicy. No words I say can do the food justice, so stop reading this review and go admire all the pretty pictures from other reviewers! Best chicken & waffles ever? I'd say so. I don't normally go to Williamsburg often, but I'd definitely come back to this place next time for another round of chicken & waffles.",4.0

"I love fried chicken. It's actually pretty gross if I think about how much fried chicken I can eat if I didn't exercise some restraint. Those Thrillist slide shows of the 10 new fried chicken places in NYC? Your girl is the target audience. So the other day my boyfriend and I came here with his parents who took a trip out to shitshow Williamsburg from Long Island. I very much appreciate that they were able to experience an ambiance that is described as ""hipster"". In reality though, the place is pretty chill and not that douchey besides the host who missed the memo that the time to audition for a cameo on Fresh Prince of Bel Air is over. All love. So, I was the only one who had chicken and waffles. Mine came spread with spicy honey and apple cinnamon waffles. First, the chicken was pretty juicy and tender, the skin was very good and crispy but not weighed down with grease. I'm a big fan of adding honey to just about anything - fishballs, chicken wings, biscuits, etc. The spicy honey was a nice touch, but the meat itself, while tender, was a little bland. My boyfriend liked the waffles, but personally, I found them to be a little too soft/tender. I'm partial to something a little denser with some contrasting texture between the surface and inside (kinda like baguettes). The waffles here were kinda like crepes. The biscuits were decent but not that buttery. The cornbread was bland and so was the Mac and Cheese. The pulled pork sliders were mediocre but the pickles were good. The Dark Chocolate Old Fashioned is an atrocity. I know that Mast Brothers are trying to take over the world, but time and place, people. UGH.",3.0

A quick search on the  internet and a short drive later we found ourselves at sweet chick . Ok the waffles are fantastic I was never big on waffles but theirs made me a believer . Now this was both are first experience dining on fried chicken and waffles and I gotta say it's a great combination. The fried chicken ? Well I've had way better, over fried ? Reminded me of the Swanson hungry man portion but freshly cooked before being frozen , the drinks weren't worth it. The place does have a nice vibe good music and the service was good.

"I died and went to heaven today! Headed out with my bf for a late Williamsburg brunch. We got there and the hostess was awesome. She let us know the wait for a table for 2 was about 25-40mins but she took my number and said she'd call me when one opened up. We went for a walk but she called us back about 10 mins after saying she had one available.Despite being seated at 3:55pm, we were allowed to order from the brunch menu which ends at 4:00pm; a couple was seated a few mins. after us and were given a diff. menu. The waitress was nice and quickly took our orders, we already knew what we were getting CHICKEN AND WAFFLES: a no brainer from all the good reviews we read. We also ordered some spritzer drink which I can't really remember the name; it was good but had a bitter aftertaste so I was not a fan. Our food came out so fast, and let me tell you, I am not lying when I say its one of the best things I've eaten in a while. The chicken was SO crispy and so well seasoned, I even licked my fingers at some point. The waffles were so fluffy and delicious, they give you 3 diff. butters and though I cannot recall the names, I enjoyed them all. The decor of the place is really cute as well, and I loved their playlist: songs from the late 90s/early 2000s, we were def. in our zone. The best part is that it is not pricey at all, we ate and had a drink all under 60$ for two people: SCORE! I added this spot to my Boozy Brunch list because despite them not offering an AYCD brunch, the menu is amazing and I saw they had mimosas, bellinis, and bloody marys for about $10 and they came in a generous glass. Overall 5 stars for this place, I have ZERO complaints. The food is seriously top 3 and the service was really good. Count on me to be back and VERY soon!",5.0

"Popped in on a Sunday evening.Food...a.maze.ing, Mac and Cheese to die for!Im not much of a chicken and waffles person but because it is their specialty I gave it a try, i dont have much of a sweet tooth so I probably wouldnt order this meal consistently , but it tasted very fresh, the chicken was cooked to perfection, and the waffle was the right amount of crispy and chewy, very well made. Their hot sauce is yummy too.It's not a huge restaurant so if you're in the mood to be private or a little more intimate with the person you came with skip this place it gets very busy and the tables are pretty close to each other.Definitely worth trying, I rated this place 4 out of 5 because I was feeling mushy that day and wasn't feeling being surrounded by so many people, basing it on my experience but if it wasn't for that it gets a 5.",4.0

"We got to Sweet Chick at the end of brunch,  so our only option was the classic chicken & waffles. Chicken was very crispy and juicy. The waffles were very light. Th blueberry butter for the waffles was a very good touch. Def would go back again to try out their full menu.",4.0
"So yummy!  We had brunch here on a busy Saturday.  Although we had to wait for our entire party to arrive to be seated, the hostess helped us ""save"" a table.  We enjoyed drinks at the bar while we waited.  Our waitress was efficient and helpful.  I enjoyed the chicken and waffles.  Perfectly fried. The bacon was HEAVEN.  And they don't rush you out.  Will be back to try the Shrimp and Grits!",5.0
Delicious chicken and waffles. Great brunch spot. It gets crowded here but I didn't wait too long as I went towards the end of brunch. Recommend this place.,4.0
"Went here really late at night, I had some great chicken and waffles! There are a lot of different flavours of chicken available, and a great selection of craft beers! Would highly recommend, some of the best chicken and waffles in the area.",5.0
"Popped in on a Sunday evening.Food...a.maze.ing, Mac and Cheese to die for!Im not much of a chicken and waffles person but because it is their specialty I gave it a try, i dont have much of a sweet tooth so I probably wouldnt order this meal consistently , but it tasted very fresh, the chicken was cooked to perfection, and the waffle was the right amount of crispy and chewy, very well made. Their hot sauce is yummy too.It's not a huge restaurant so if you're in the mood to be private or a little more intimate with the person you came with skip this place it gets very busy and the tables are pretty close to each other.Definitely worth trying, I rated this place 4 out of 5 because I was feeling mushy that day and wasn't feeling being surrounded by so many people, basing it on my experience but if it wasn't for that it gets a 5.",4.0
"Amazing spot!It was Monday morning when I was searching for a restaurant that serves chicken and waffles. A lot of other restaurants are closed or open at 5pm on Monday's. Sweet Chick is open!Went around 2:30pm and there weren't many people there so the food was ordered and made within 20 minutes.The chicken and waffles were spectacular!!!!!!!!! Every bite was like heaven.They were also playing a fair amount of Stevie Wonder and Michael Jackson, which complimented the perfection that was going on in mouth.Definitely recommend this place to anyone!!!",5.0
Had the bacon and cheddar chicken and waffles and the kale salad. Both were good but the chicken and waffles were the standout for sure!,4.0
"Ahh! I love me some fried chicken. The chicken was cooked to a perfect golden crisp with a lovely hint of rosemary.  I ordered the bucket, and I like that you can customize the pieces you want. The slaw was also delicious--it was better than any i've ever had. I went with the biscuit, which was nice and flaky. Others with me ordered the waffles, which i thought were ok. Overall great experience, despite the fact that it was quite noisy inside (but i guess that adds to the vibe).",4.0
"On 10/28, I finally made it to this place. I wasn't able to dine so we had take out. I had the chicken and waffles and they were so good.

"What place doesn't do pick up orders ? Never been here before called for a pick up becauSe a friend said this place was delicious... First mistake they don't do orders for pick up i called a second time to give my credit card hoping the reason they don't do the pick up orders is so they don't get stuck with food if people don't come get to get it, Understandable the answer was still, no you have to go there and place the order?

First off it's a smooth 30 minute wait for a table of 2. But that didn't matter cause it was worth the wait. Food was amazing.

"Came here around 9:30pm on a Friday night, expecting an impossible wait. Fortunately, two seats freed up at the bar and my boy and I immediately sat down for two staff beers ($3) and ordered a BLT kale salad to start. Blair was working the bar and  we had a great time getting to know him and vice versa. My chicken and waffles were the bomb (was the crust made out of panko and cornflakes?), but I missed sampling the trio of butter sauces. The food runner forgot them and I didn't realize what I had missed until I saw someone else receive the sauces with the same dish I ordered. I'm probably better off health-wise without them anyway. If you take the moist and flavorful meat of Pies n Thighs' chicken and combine it with the crispy fried skin of Commodore's chicken, you'll get something close to the godly fried chicken we sampled that night. The boy got the bucket of chicken (3pc), and he was surprised by how much he loved the side of slaw.Thanks for great conversation, service and an overall very impressive first experience, Blair! Chris and I look forward to coming back again to try more dinner and brunch items.",5.0

"I've been meaning to stop by this restaurant and did bc a lot of ppl told me about this place.  I had the Belgian Waffle with General Tso chicken with Macaroni and Cheese on the side.  Even tho the chicken had a lemon citrus taste, it was still good to me.  The drink of choice i chose is the signature 'Sweet Chick' that wasn't bad.  The waitresses are very nice and made my friends and I comfortable.  I would recommend this place.",3.0
"NOM NOM cheese grits.The food here is amazing. At my table, we had orders of chicken and waffles and shrimp and grits... serious smiles and food babies all around. The drinks are delicious. My bloody had an entire piece of thick-cut bacon skewered atop the spicy worcestershire vodka mix. The decor is kitschy southern/farmhouse/Brooklyn (you know what I'm talking about). The service is awesome. We had to a wait a pretty long while for our food, so our waiter apologized numerous times and comped us a round of drinks.Bottom line: yes I suggest, yes I would return.",4.0
"I love this place. It's a nice addition to the thriving neighborhood and the food is AMAZING. Always get fried chicken. Always get waffles. My only complaint thus far is that I tried to make a phone order for pick up and was told that I could only make orders with the bartender, so pretty much if you want sweet chick and don't want to waste any time....yeah, that's just not possible. Change this policy, sweet chick. Not everybody wants to eat in your restaurant because it's loud (sometimes good, sometimes not)",4.0
"Came here around 9:30pm on a Friday night, expecting an impossible wait. Fortunately, two seats freed up at the bar and my boy and I immediately sat down for two staff beers ($3) and ordered a BLT kale salad to start. Blair was working the bar and  we had a great time getting to know him and vice versa. My chicken and waffles were the bomb (was the crust made out of panko and cornflakes?), but I missed sampling the trio of butter sauces. The food runner forgot them and I didn't realize what I had missed until I saw someone else receive the sauces with the same dish I ordered. I'm probably better off health-wise without them anyway. If you take the moist and flavorful meat of Pies n Thighs' chicken and combine it with the crispy fried skin of Commodore's chicken, you'll get something close to the godly fried chicken we sampled that night. The boy got the bucket of chicken (3pc), and he was surprised by how much he loved the side of slaw.Thanks for great conversation, service and an overall very impressive first experience, Blair! Chris and I look forward to coming back again to try more dinner and brunch items.",5.0
This is a decent spot to get some chicken and waffles. I like the waffles it's very good I just don't like how you don't chose what pieces of chicken you get. I want a breast if I am paying 13 dollars for some chicken and waffles. Weird vibe in here on weekend the music was blasted I guess because it is so small could not hear anything which was hilarious. Because I have been here in the afternoon also total 180 in the vibe. Don't understand what it is trying to be.,3.0

I'm a bit far away in SF, but I would go back there in a heartbeat!",5.0
Over rated and over priced. Started with mac and cheese . That was amazing !! Then I ordered the 3 piece bucket. The biscuit was also good that came with it. I did not like the chicken one bit though. I feel like I've had better chicken at one of those rinky-dink chicken places for half the price. I HATED my drink so much I couldn't even finish it.

"We walked about 15 blocks to go to The Meatball Shop, but after telling us there was a 45 minute wait, we hopped a few doors over to Sweet Chicks, and it was a serendipitously perfect move! After bar hopping all throughout Williamsburg, our crew of 6 was starving! We were seated promptly, despite how busy it was in there, and to our delight, the tables weren't squished all atop one another. On a swelteringly humid NYC day, no one really wants to be sitting elbow to elbow with anyone! And you don't really have to do that here. Plenty to room to spread out.The service is super-friendly without any pretentiousness, and our waitress was amazingly polite and patient with the million & one questions a couple of people in our group decided to throw down as the rest of us were ready to pass out from hunger.The menu is what I would call NY southern. They WILL charge you $16 for your plate of fried chicken and bacon-cheddar waffles, but it's so delicious you won't think twice about it. They had specials like a duck confit option and duck sliders. (I'm a duck slut.) The wait for our food was LONG. Our stomachs were starting to eat themselves, and there isn't any bread on the table to quell that hunger while you're waiting, but I will say that it was well worth it. We got a side of mac n cheese to share, but quickly realized we should have ordered a couple more sides as that mac n cheese was quickly devoured. It was delicious. The bacon wrapped oysters were also scarfed down quickly. We probably should have ordered 3 or 4 portions of those.The chicken was super-crispy and seasoned perfectly. I don't remember having a better portion of fried chicken this good in a LONG time in this city. The savory bacon-cheddar waffles were fluffy, tasty, and served with a side of 3 compound butters - honey butter, rosemary sage butter, and blueberry butter. The blueberry was our favorite of the 3, but they are ALL good and they will bring you more of whichever one you like.I suggest ordering an app while your entree will take some time to come out, especially if they are busy. As good as the food is here, I can't imagine them NOT being busy. The staff is awesome and friendly, and didn't yell at my knuckle-head friend who brought his own beer in with him. (They have beer on the menu, please don't bring your own bottle. They have a full bar.) The place is spacious, but cozy and the menu has vegetarian options for the non-meat eaters. Sweet Chick was a fantastic find, and we can't wait to head back over there. Thank the food gods there was such a long wait at The Meatball Shop or we never would have discovered this awesome spot!

"So, two weekends ago I was on the hunt to find a good chicken and waffle restaurant. We originally set out to go to Buttermilk Channel, but after calling ahead and hearing about a 2 hour wait, that was NOT an option. I come on Yelp, and I find sweet chicks. There was no wait when we called, so we head down there.  The wait is about 15 ins long when we get there. The hostess rubbed me the wrong way, but I can't comment on that too much, because her attitude was very indirect, in a direct way! LoL, but I looked past that, and we were seated (after she called someone who arrived after us with the same party number, she got the SERIOUS side eye from my friends and I then seated us). Off the top, the waiter was helpful and the atmosphere was cool They were bumping 90's hip-hop when we were there, and reminded me of my age! LoL. I ordered the chicken and waffles, and a side of macaroni. LOVE the macaroni. The cheese was great, and the little crusted top was awesome! I've said this before and I'll say it again, I'm not a fan of most macaroni not cooked by my grandmother, but this was good! The chicken seemed to be friend to perfection (and TWO plump and juicy pieces, NICE!), and I could taste the bacon on the waffles.

Service is remarkably better than the other neighbourhood eats, but it's still rather relaxed compared to Manhattan -- so if you're not interested in lingering over a brunch cocktail, then you may want to head elsewhere.Our brunch cocktail of choice was the ubiquitous Bloody Mary, which they do perfectly spicy and with the right amount of booze at Sweet Chick. I opted for their cast-iron skillet of smoked pork and potato hash with poached eggs. We also tried their signature chicken and waffles, which had its ups and downs -- definitely a better waffle than the one at Pies 'n Thighs, but the chicken was not nearly as delicious.Considering that Sweet Chick is so easy to get to from the Bedford L stop, it may become our default place to come whenever we get the Southern craving.",5.0

Yeah, it was that good.The serving size of the chicken, though delicious, leaves room for improvement.  Those accustomed to the C&W from the neighboring Pies and Thighs, will feel cheated.The Appalachian Beans were topped with cornbread and a poached egg; it had a sweet taste.  I would not opt for these again.The heirloom tomato salad rocked the effin' house. It was very.  Very.  Good.  It was a special, and I do not know how often it is on the menu, but I will be ordering these again.I want to return and try the ""sloppy duck sliders.""  Though there's no shortage of alcohol, the Brooklyn soda works selection was what we opted for.  They are served in a large glass, it might have been a jelly jar, and they are as refreshing as they are delicious.  Perfect for summer.",4.0
"Was in Williamsburg for a meeting and needed to get a quick dinner.  It had been a while since I had fried chicken, and the place looked promising.  I asked the waiter if it's possible to finish dinner in 45 minutes and he said yes, so I decided to give it a shot.My wife and I shared the chicken and waffles and sweet chick bucket.  I really like the seasoning on the chicken.  The herbs and spice were very fragrant and tasty.  The biscuit and the slaw was average, nothing special.  The waffle, however, was amazing!  We got the rosemary and mushroom waffle, but I think I would prefer the classic one.  The waffle is crispy yet soft, and I loved the sweetness that I didn't even need to use syrup or butter.The atmosphere was good.  We sat by the open window, so that was great for some people watching.  The service was excellent.  Our waiter knew that we were in a hurry so he made sure our food came quickly.  He also came to remind us when it was time for my meeting.  Overall, I would definitely go back for those amazing chickens and waffles.",4.0

Well where should I start?  I ordered pancakes plain. It came with powered sugar. Didn't ask for that. Then I put a lil syrup on then fist bite tastes like eggs. Eggy pancakes.

"Not the most mind-blowing chicken and waffles I've had in NYC (those were at Buttermilk Channel), but definitely delicious anyway. My date and I both got the cheddar bacon waffles, which was a pretty solid choice. We also opted to share the mac and cheese, the duck sliders, and a side of carrots and kale, because we decided that something green and at least vaguely healthy was a necessary addition. The mac and cheese is actually shells, but it was rich and creamy in all the right ways. The duck sliders were good enough, but small and maybe not worth how much they cost. I was pleasantly surprised by how flavorful the carrots and kale were, but once again, a pretty small portion for the price. They also ran out of both cornbread and biscuits, which is a travesty in my book. We did both get drinks as well - the Tiger Tiger Woods Y'all and the 1776. I'm a sucker for a Campari cocktail, so I was pleased. Service was quick at 7:15ish on a Sunday night, and the bill came out to be about $80.Also, when we first came in, they said the wait would be about an hour, so we gave a name and number and went down the street for a drink. Not 10 minutes later, we got a call that our table was ready, so maybe don't be deterred by a long wait time?",4.0
"Probably one of my favorite brunch spots. I moved to NY from the South so it's nice to get Southern style food occasionally. However, I grew up in the Northeast so I want said Southern food to be non-greasy and prepared in more of a gourmet and non-family style way if that makes sense. This place is so delicious and the waffles are perfect. The best part is the 90's and 00's hip hop/R&B playing. I'm always chair dancing while I eat. Reccommended: Chicken and Waffles, cheese grits, hibiscus mint soda",5.0
"Great experience and great food.The service was spot on, even by Williamsburg standards :).  We came to split the Kale BLT salad and duck sliders, but wound up splitting the Chicken & Waffles, Appalachian Beans and Heirloom tomato salad.The Chicken and Waffles is undoubtedly what Sweet Chick is ballyhooed for, and they lived up to the hype.  There were three different flavors of waffle, of which we opted for cheddar and bacon- one bite, I was hooked.  With the other I was reeled.  How long before I was gutted like the fish I had become for this waffle? Yeah, it was that good.The serving size of the chicken, though delicious, leaves room for improvement.  Those accustomed to the C&W from the neighboring Pies and Thighs, will feel cheated.The Appalachian Beans were topped with cornbread and a poached egg; it had a sweet taste.  I would not opt for these again.The heirloom tomato salad rocked the effin' house. It was very.  Very.  Good.  It was a special, and I do not know how often it is on the menu, but I will be ordering these again.I want to return and try the ""sloppy duck sliders.""  Though there's no shortage of alcohol, the Brooklyn soda works selection was what we opted for.  They are served in a large glass, it might have been a jelly jar, and they are as refreshing as they are delicious.  Perfect for summer.",4.0
"Was in Williamsburg for a meeting and needed to get a quick dinner.  It had been a while since I had fried chicken, and the place looked promising.  I asked the waiter if it's possible to finish dinner in 45 minutes and he said yes, so I decided to give it a shot.My wife and I shared the chicken and waffles and sweet chick bucket.  I really like the seasoning on the chicken.  The herbs and spice were very fragrant and tasty.  The biscuit and the slaw was average, nothing special.  The waffle, however, was amazing!  We got the rosemary and mushroom waffle, but I think I would prefer the classic one.  The waffle is crispy yet soft, and I loved the sweetness that I didn't even need to use syrup or butter.The atmosphere was good.  We sat by the open window, so that was great for some people watching.  The service was excellent.  Our waiter knew that we were in a hurry so he made sure our food came quickly.  He also came to remind us when it was time for my meeting.  Overall, I would definitely go back for those amazing chickens and waffles.",4.0
"My first time there was today, and it was amazing!! We walked in and the hostess said that it would be a 10-15 min wait which wasn't a problem because we wanted to get cash. When we came back we were seated right away. The waitress was very friendly and asked us if it was our first time there. She told us about the oh so famous chicken and waffles and other entrées. We def came for the chicken and waffles, which was my first time eating. I got the bacon and cheese waffles with the fri chicken. I tasted the waffles first I almost cried (tears of joy) hehe. It was so delish! The chicken was awesome also very crispy and juicy with flavour. I can't wait to go again. I love the vibe there.",5.0
Not bad.. but Pies & Thighs clearly takes home the winner of best fried chicken in Brooklyn if not the entire NYC.,3.0
"All I have to say is that my daddy was a southern chef and I have been on a quest to find comparable fried chicken. YUM!!!! Daddy would approve!!! Pair perfect fried chicken with uniquely delicious waffles and a huge dense southern biscuit and healthy eating be damned... I got the bucket of chicken!!! Me and my family can't wait to go back... Oh, I forgot - my daughter didn't wait. She went back with her friends days later.   Staff is super friendly. Atmosphere is pleasant -- which is good because it's a little 'cozy' (very easy to strike up a conversation with the folks sitting at the neighboring table - in fact they made several offers for us to share their food - LOL!) Visions of chicken, waffles and biscuits dancing in my head :-)",5.0
"The food at this place is to diiiie for and the service kills too. I'm not gonna write an essay about it - all you need to know is that everything on the menu is a full on treat. Chicken is moist and crunchy, home made pickle plate is a must (!!) and the home cured bacon on the blt kale salad had my mouth watering for days after I ate it. Plus we waited in line for a little while to get in and were surprised to receive two wonderful appetizers on the house.. just for being patient! Would have been entirely worth the wait even without the free food. Sooo good. Too bad I live on the opposite coast and cannot eat here weekly.",5.0
"Chicken is YUM! Waffles also YUM!Mac&cheese is misleading since it was actually Shells & cheese. Light & creamy sauce, not the dense home style kind which we expected. Still yummy in its own right. The wait was ridunculous - 45mins for 2 @9pm on a Friday night. We got takeout instead & ate it on a nearby bench. Beware, the plastic forks & knives are so flimsy that they were almost pointless. Otherwise yummy food!!",4.0
Well where should I start?  I ordered pancakes plain. It came with powered sugar. Didn't ask for that. Then I put a lil syrup on then fist bite tastes like eggs. Eggy pancakes. If I had wanted eggs I would have ordered an omelet. And now two hours later the meal keeps revisiting me. I tasted my companies food they had the chick and waffles the waffles were pretty good the chicken had this weird oily after taste. The waffles and the cup of coffee I had gets it two stars. Wasn't horrible but I can do without.,2.0
"Not the most mind-blowing chicken and waffles I've had in NYC (those were at Buttermilk Channel), but definitely delicious anyway. My date and I both got the cheddar bacon waffles, which was a pretty solid choice. We also opted to share the mac and cheese, the duck sliders, and a side of carrots and kale, because we decided that something green and at least vaguely healthy was a necessary addition. The mac and cheese is actually shells, but it was rich and creamy in all the right ways. The duck sliders were good enough, but small and maybe not worth how much they cost.

"Holy Motherf*cking cow. I'm a new York Native, but the majority of my family is from the south and I'd have to say THE FOOD HERE IS DELICIOUS!My girl and I were spending the weekend in Willysburg (I live in Harlem and she resides in Prospect Heights.) We were extremely hungry after having helped someone move some heavy items. Luckily we were only a couple blocks away from the Bedford Ave. L Station. When I'm hungry, I'm usually HANGRY, so normally we'd enter the first place we stumble upon. Sweet Chick happened to be that first place. I spotted the huge ""Chicken and Waffles"" sign from across the street. We checked out the menu and decided to try it out. I DON'T regret it. The menu was full of my favorite Soul/Southern Food. I almost had a hard time making a decision.I finally decided to order Shrimp and Grits. She tried the Chicken and Waffles. Sweet Chick did not disappoint. It was like heaven in my mouth. The sauce, the shrimp, and the grits were so perfectly blended, I had to forcefully stop myself from eating too quickly and savor the moment. I tried her Chicken and Waffles which were just as good. A lot of fried skin but definitely not over fried. It was really good. The waitress gave us 3 different butters to sample with the Waffles. The Lemon butter was was my favorite. The Raspberry butter were more meh. The service was bad either. Waitress came over right away. Our food arrived maybe 5-10 minutes after we order. She did take a while to come back after the meal to bring us the check but overall she was good. Oh and another good tidbit, I think someone's ipod playlist but the music was AWESOME.

"Four stars because I have only tried two things but have fallen in love with those two items from here.

Their waffles you get to choose from three different flavors/types: classic, bacon and cheddar and dried cherry) along with their mac and cheese (made with shells rather than elbows and the perfect amount of cheese, which according to me is not too little and not overly cheesy). I think these two items here are going to be my staples and it's going to be hard for me to try something else here. Who knows maybe one day I'll get adventurous and be able to write another review but until then their chicken and waffles and mac and cheese it is...

I know the decor is a part of the ambiance but I don't like the long school cafeteria table down the middle of the restaurant. It felt like I was sharing my meal with complete strangers as I was seated directly next to a stranger on either side of me. It makes it hard to have a decent conversation with your partner or lunch date because people are literally sharing their meal with you. I don't want to rub elbows with strangers while eating my meal. That was the only thing that turned me off.

As a kid, I thought brussel sprouts were an actual abomination to both my nose and to my tongue. It wasn't until a friend demanded I eat them at knife point, that I indulged. Thank god for that knife fight, because without it I would never have touched the green jewels of sweet gold Sweet Chick serves up. The drinks are delicious. And they have a rad happy hour. There's always what they call a ""staff beer"" for cheap. Annnd I'm pretty sure this is the only place in the 'burg to have Hell or High Watermelon on draft. Get here. Put your name down. Go to a neighboring bar and get some booze in you. And then come and have yourself a sweet ass time.",5.0
"I have been wanting to try this place for awhile, but I rarely find myself in Williamsburg so when I knew I would be in the area for a party I figured I would eat dinner there beforehand. It was simply wonderful! A friend and I cane here around 8:30 on a Saturday night and did not have to wait. She got the julep drink and I had the tiger woods y'all. Both our drinks were strong but good. We both got the chicken and bacon and cheddar waffles. We also asked for a side of biscuits since we were both starving when we got there and we got a side of the collard and cole slaw. Everything was simply amazing. The biscuits were moist, the waffles were delicious (the three butters were wonderful too), and I loved the cole slaw side. I will definitely be coming back!",5.0
"I came here for brunch last Sunday and ordered the chicken & waffles with a side biscuit and the Arnold Palmer soda. The wait time wasn't too long and what I appreciated about them was that they took my number down and called me when the table was ready. The service was prompt, the food was hot and fresh, tasted delicious. I wish the Arnold Palmer was sweeter though. It tasted bland. I know the decor is a part of the ambiance but I don't like the long school cafeteria table down the middle of the restaurant. It felt like I was sharing my meal with complete strangers as I was seated directly next to a stranger on either side of me. It makes it hard to have a decent conversation with your partner or lunch date because people are literally sharing their meal with you. I don't want to rub elbows with strangers while eating my meal. That was the only thing that turned me off. If I came here again it would have to be not during peak time so that I could choose a more private table.",3.0
So this is a rival of Pies N Thighs ehhh? Well I really enjoyed the Fried Chicken & Bacon -Cheddar Waffles.. Simply delicious with the table syrup. The chicken had a nice spice to it and was crunchy yet tender. I am sure to return again for brunch! Great R&B pandora station made it much enjoyable!,4.0
"For Sunday brunch, there was a long wait, but it was well worth it. Service was great. The food was delicious! The atmosphere was good and the music...the music was...awesome! I'll admit to singing along a bit with the old school soul that was playing, and I wasn't the only one. We had the chicken and waffles, the black bean cake scramble, a waffle with berries, a peanut butter banana cinnamon roll, and shrimp and grits with lemonade and peach iced tea. Everyone was happy. We will be back!",4.0
"Well, I would have loved to have gotten to try it, but by the time I went to tell them that I would try and come back another time I heard the hosted give away ours seats to a walk up, even though we had been waiting 20 mins.  I thought maybe they had been ahead of us, but they said ""nope, Just got here"" and the hostess sat them right in front of us.  Don't know how to say this without sounding like a jerk, but thats never ever okay.",2.0
"My daughters and I ate a late brunch here on a Saturday afternoon and enjoyed the homey decor and friendly service.  We tried the chicken and waffles, sweet waffles with fruit, and shrimp and grits.I lived the shrimp and grits!  The grits were nice and cheesy, and the sauce had lots of tomato and green pepper with the right amount of spice.  There were 4 decent sized shrimp topping the dish along with a poached egg.I had a bite (or 2) of the sweet waffles which were light and airy and accompanied by a trio of flavored butters.  The waffles were topped with raspberries and blueberries and a dusting of powdered sugar.I also tried the chicken that came with my daughters chicken & waffles.  There were 2 medium sized pieces on her dish, which were served piping hot.  The chicken was juicy and quite flavorful.  Not the best I've had, but certainly very good.We enjoyed our brunch and would definitely go again.",4.0
"First, I like the ambiance and the customer service was great. But let's get real, the food is what makes a place. I enjoyed the mac n cheese but I really came for the chicken and waffles.  I'm sad to say I did NOT like the chicken at all.  Turns out they brine the chicken with some mixture overnight that to me gives it a weird taste.  Call me old school but I like fried chicken that taste like fried chicken.  The waffles were good and I did like the different flavored butters they provided.I even had dessert.  I ordered the bourbon pecan pie.  Felt like I was just eating sweetened pecans.  Took a few bites and gave the rest to my Dad who really liked all the pecans.Like a few other reviewers, I'll stick with pies-n-thighs unless you stop brining the chicken.",2.0
This place definitely is the very essence of Williamsburg my wife and I stumbled upon  this place and was satisfied for these reasonsDecorum: modern southern/hippy/ easy going Food: We had the chicken and waffles!!

"Came here with family and I must say the service, food, and drinks were amazing!We started dinner with several yummy appetizers.  We had pulled pork sliders, mac and cheese, and a kale salad which were all delicious.  For our thirsty selves, we had a Purple Drank (which was a mixture of gin and grape soda), root beer, and hibiscus tea.The entrees delicious and the bacon waffles were yummy!So effin good and we will return for more.",5.0

"1 Friday night dining experience(crowded). We'll definitely return. This is NOT the best fried chicken I've ever had!  But that's only because I grew up with a mother and an aunt (not to mention a flock of church ladies) who turned fried chicken into a religious experience. Honestly, I still don't understand the chicken and waffles craze. I never had a hankering to combine the two. Nonetheless, this is a good place for fried chicken and a GREAT place for waffles. I had the bacon and cheese stuffed waffle, and it was wonderful (hot, tender, tasty even without syrup, and not too cheesy). Although we were eating by candlelight, I could tell that the crust on the fried chicken was a little darker than I prefer. (I could taste that it was a little darker than I prefer too.) The dark meat was tender, moist, and tasted brined (a big plus).  But overall I was hoping for either more seasoning in the crust or a more complex combo of seasonings  on the meat. Also, the white meat was just a slight tad dry.  I think just one minute less cooking time would have made it perfect for me. My hubs ordered the aged ribeye and was THRILLED. We also loved the Mac and cheese (killer, smooth, yummy sauce)!  We'll definitely return (perhaps on a Tuesday)!",4.0
Took my father here last year for Father's Day and he loved it we both did.

I was pretty excited about mine too: a bowl FULL of grits with peppers in a rich broth, and a good number of shrimps as well. Definitely more than I could finish in a sitting, despite my best efforts.I thought the service was friendly, especially for a busy holiday Sunday when the place was crowded with families.

"Being an LA native, I grew up on the quirky and brilliant combo of chicken and waffles.

Try not to eat anything before coming!I ordered the chicken with bacon waffles and nearly died in heaven. The chicken was moist on the inside and crunchy on the out. The waffles were perfect with or without syrup but I'm like Will Ferrell in ELF, I put syrup on everything! Especially chicken. Finger licking good. The server also let me try some gourmet butters: raspberry (my fav) and lemon. They make a huge difference. Mac & cheese with Ritz cracker crust- the Gruyere, fontina, and aged cheddar cheeses melted perfectly over shells and very creamy. Definitely an item to share. I had two spoonfuls and was nearly full. Kale blt salad- I mean c'mon... You can't go wrong with kale and bacon! The house-cured bacon. One word. Amazing. Thick and yummy. Get the dressing on the side though, sometimes they like to go crazy. The moonshine/beer is great before the meal. It'll definitely make you feel like a king when they bring your massive plates of food out. On my next visit I had the General Tso's chicken and waffles and was pretty much in a food coma after.

The drinks were definitely overpriced, all over $11 which for places on Bedford is a tad steep. I got the sweet chick basket, had to pay extra for the fries(even though it was the same price as the slaw that came with the meal - no substitutions) which were more of ""crisps"" than ""shoestring fries"".

"I've been here twice so far within the last couple of months and both times the experience was great. The ambiance of this place is typical Williamsburg which is nice. It's small and gets pretty loud when it's busy which is fine if you're expecting it. I would recommend showing up early as it gets packed pretty fast. If you do have to wait, you can always sit at the bar and try one of their drinks. Although ""The Sweet Chick"" can do with a little more alcohol in it, it's pretty good. Both experiences the food was A+. You obviously have to get the Chicken and Waffles which is absolutely perfect. I'm extremely picky about chicken, especially off the bone but this chicken was just so tasty I didn't even care. Also, the Sloppy Duck Sliders are excellent. It seems the staff experience can be hit or miss from other reviews which I can kind of agree with. The first time our server was kind of in a 'blah' mood but she still got the job done so I can't complain too much. The second time Samantha or 'Sam' helped us and she was GREAT! Extremely friendly and had personality which is always a huge plus in my book.Overall, this place is a must try! I definitely see myself going back.",4.0

Also, best perfectly cooked waffles. BUT, when I think of chicken and waffle, I expect layers of mashed potato and gravy in between my waffles and my chicken. Their platter seemed too bare bones with just waffles and chicken sitting on my plate side by side. I really felt as though my boyfriend had missed out on the experience of true chicken and waffles.

My friend got the cornbread, but the portion size was so small for what they charged. I would come back to try the chicken and waffles though if I were in the area. Friendly chill crowd and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.",3.0
"So I checked out Sweet Chick this Friday and It was okay. Went there for a birthday dinner for my best friend and the food was just okay. I ordered the chicken in a bucket and the chicken for my taste was not seasoned enough for me and the biscuit that came with it was buttery brick hard. No Bueno. Doubt I'll rush back to this spot, but the staff were indeed very friendly which made up for my not so great food experience.",2.0

"I've been here twice so far within the last couple of months and both times the experience was great. The ambiance of this place is typical Williamsburg which is nice. It's small and gets pretty loud when it's busy which is fine if you're expecting it. I would recommend showing up early as it gets packed pretty fast. If you do have to wait, you can always sit at the bar and try one of their drinks. Although ""The Sweet Chick"" can do with a little more alcohol in it, it's pretty good. Both experiences the food was A+. You obviously have to get the Chicken and Waffles which is absolutely perfect. I'm extremely picky about chicken, especially off the bone but this chicken was just so tasty I didn't even care. Also, the Sloppy Duck Sliders are excellent. It seems the staff experience can be hit or miss from other reviews which I can kind of agree with. The first time our server was kind of in a 'blah' mood but she still got the job done so I can't complain too much. The second time Samantha or 'Sam' helped us and she was GREAT! Extremely friendly and had personality which is always a huge plus in my book.Overall, this place is a must try! I definitely see myself going back.",4.0
"Def. bookmark as ""top brunch spot"". The food is Amazing: I ordered the shrimp and grits, savory, larger portion size. It was well seasoned and came with poached egg. The Chicken and Waffles were also amazing. Only thing is the wait time on weekends can be over 1 hour, however if you don't mind eating at the bar, you can get in quicker that way. It is a very cozy place for brunch with friends or ""date"".",4.0
Food is good. Waitresses bust their ass. Manager sucks. Very disorganized. Music is ridiculously bad. Communal seating simply doesn't work.,3.0
"Delicious food! I went for brunch on a Saturday and there was no wait, we got a window seat, the banana bread is made in-house and gave my grandmother's banana bread a run for its money. The french press coffee, Brooklyn Roasting Co. beans were nice and strong. I had the shrimp & grits...loved them. I did not have any brunch drinks though. My fiance had the chicken and waffles, they were also great. His only complaint was that the fried chicken was not crunchy. I deducted one star for slow service, our waitress was friendly but slow. I will definitely be going back!",4.0

"Who can say no to chicken and waffles? Tasty chicken, tasty waffles, comes with different flavored butters and maple syrup! IF you order the chicken and waffles it comes with a free drink. Can't go wrong with that. The chicken isn't dry, it's juicy! The waffles do get cold fast so you gotta eat fast.",4.0
"Came in off the street when we saw the sign for chicken and waffles and my bf admitted he'd never tried it. Our order finally came in after 45 minutes (I was told we were waiting for a new fresh batch of fried chicken). Best fried chicken I've ever had. Perfectly seasoned and super crunchy batter. Also, best perfectly cooked waffles. BUT, when I think of chicken and waffle, I expect layers of mashed potato and gravy in between my waffles and my chicken. Their platter seemed too bare bones with just waffles and chicken sitting on my plate side by side. I really felt as though my boyfriend had missed out on the experience of true chicken and waffles.

"Meh. I've experienced better.  Right of the bat I'll say this place is overpriced!! I came here last night with friends for drinks and food. I have to say I was extremely disappointed at the end of the night!! They have no vegan option, so one of my friends was relegated to just eating greens. Not a big issue as it is a chicken and waffle place.  But for me a meat lover the food was ""Meh""! There was no flavor in the chicken or the sides. Only thing I liked was the Mac and Cheese.  But what irked me the most was the service! The waitress opted to cut us off from alcohol without any prior warnings. Didn't tell us what the issue was and just said this is was our last drink.  I assumed it might have been one of my friends was being loud.  Give us a warning!!

"I'm mostly giving this a 2 because of the price and because I don't understand how this got such amazing reviews. I had-of course-the chicken and waffles. It was good, yes, but $13 for two pieces of chicken and a waffle? That's a bit ridic. I know it's a novelty, but it's a bit crazy.

"Came here after a long day in Williamsburg. Right near the L train, so getting back to Manhattan was a breeze. The waffle came with three different butters, not sure what they were but they were delicious. The fried chicken was a bit spicy but that went really well with the maple syrup and waffles. Also has a great selection of beer and drinks. Got myself a can of Hell or High watermelon wheat beer and a mason jar of Arnold Palmer soda. Would definitely make the trip out just to go here again.",5.0
"My buddies and I stopped in to Sweet Chick for a late night drink and snack.  I'm super glad we did!  The mac and cheese was phenomenally good and the bartender was very nice.  He dealt with our bad jokes and tipsy shenanigans nicely, plus, he served a nice size bourbon for me. Thanks for that.  I'd love to go back to eat more of their delicious offerings next time I'm in the neighborhood.  I'd definitely recommend this place to a friend!",4.0
They don't serve anything but chicken and waffles until 6 pm...so getting here at 515- that's what my bf and I ordered. We were both starving and those Chicken and waffles- never had it so good -Those butter balls are amazing! Lemon and berry flavored butter- ahhhh! I wanted to order another serving of waffle! We were both still hungry so we had to wait until 6 to order the Mac and cheese and cornbread. Neither were as good as the previous food- i dont think the mac and cheese is worth the calories- bf disagrees. my recommendation Is skip the sides and dive into the real deal! I'd come here again to try the rest of the menu.,4.0

We walk out and before I hit the corner, which is literally right there, a worker comes out and asks me ""did you not want to leave a tip""? Mind you, we're outside, people can hear her. I was taken aback that she even came outside to ask. Bottom line I told her ""if we wanted to leave one, we would have."" She replies with the same tone, ""was it the service, what didn't you like?"" I said ""I didn't enjoy my meal, so I didn't feel as though I had to tip nor was the service outstanding."" The lady replies ""but you emptied your plate."" This was honestly the boiling point for me, I didn't like the fact that she even came outside to address me in the first place. Very inconsiderate, it was embarrassing and rude.

"Getting a table here can be cumbersome on the weekends (mainly friday night through sunday). I actually had waits of 30 mins or more on prior occassions and passed in favor of other places with no wait on Bedofrd Ave. The biggest draw of Sweet Chick is their Fried Chicken & Waffles. They have other southern comforts on the menu but look around and people will be ordering the chicken and waffles more often than not. I went here after seeing a movie at the nearby theater and met my friends for dinner. We were seated quick on a thursday night around 7 pm. My problem was that they blasted the music, with the speakers above us. I dont get why restaurants feel the need to blast music in an already noisy environment. We were trying to have a conversations and were boarding on yelling at each other just to be able to hear each other. As side from that, the design of the place was actually fitting. I enjoyed the wooden tables and chairs. And the windows allow for a great view of Bedford Ave. It can get a bit dim inside and candles do little to help brighten the place up. Now that I think about it, darkness is usually meant to hide something, so what are they hiding? Maybe nothing. But for a night time blind person like me this can make it difficult to do something as essential as read a menu. But these are minor faults which will not detract from the experience. On to the food. My friends and I ordered the Pork Sliders as a starter. It is 3 pulled pork sliders served on a brioche bun with a pickle. I enjoyed the sliders but was not crazy about them. At $9 for an order of 3 it was not a terrible price. Unfortunately it suffered from being a little on the dry side. It could use more sauce, which I would remember to do for my next visit. Not disappointing, but not a homerun! I enjoyed the bun, which was lightly (and I emphasize the lightly) toasted to a nice crisp while retaining its softness and fresh flavor.Well, what about the main dish and reason for going? First the server. He was welcoming and great. He asked if it was our first time, which when we said yes he talked us through the menu and specials. As self explanitory as it is, it is nice to have great customer service. There are multiple option for the waffles. You have a choice of classic (basically a plain fluffy waffle), back & cheddar, Rosemary & mushroom, and a dried cranberry. I went with the classic because that is the true test of how good it would be. It was a large plate of food. The waffle was fluffy with that just bit of crunch. It had a nice touch of sweetness and held up well to the maple syrup. The fried chicked was crispy and a tadf smokey. Best of all, it was juicy and just overall great. One complaint it the abundance of bones, and how I felt there was little actual meat on it. Lastly, they gave us 3 types of butter. One was a blueberry butter, one was a lemon honey butter, and the last one we couldnt hear what it was. I have to say, the portions were small and hard to share among  us three so we defaulted to each person gets a flavor. I wish they gave us the option of a sampler or a full size of one so we dont have to compete for them. Overall, I say it was good food. At $16 for chicken and waffles I don't this will be a usual visit. It did not wow me to the point of craving to return.

"I ate dinner here last night and I loved it! The hostess was super nice, the bartender made outstanding cocktails! The food was fantastic. I got the autumn daiquiri to drink (2 of me don't judge me) it was so delicious. For dinner me and my gal friend both had the chicken bucket. 3 pieces of heaven! The batter is crispy (yum) and has a herbal flavor (sage?) which was both surprising and delightful. The buttermilk biscuit was traditional, beautiful and appreciated. Now the collard slaw-- holy moly I loved this fantastic side. It's a tangy vinegary slaw with the perfect amount of mayo and it complimented the whole dang shebang. The quality of the chicken was impressive. I don't know if it's organic or free range but I hope it is, and it should be for the price. The meal was around $18 I think, the portion size was perfectly generous but I did shamefully eat the whole thing. honey was yum and hot sauce was franks.

The batter isn't anything magical or phenomenal but it is good. The waffles are better than roscoes. Very light crispy and fluffy. I'm excited to try more things here.

You come to this place to eat chicken and waffles and let me tell you they are just not worth the hype. I have had both better fried chicken and better waffles. The place is pure hype and is located on a street where better restaurants exist. NOT WORTH THE WAIT!!,2.0
"The only thing I loved was the biscuit and the corn muffin I shared with my daughter.  The herbs in the chicken was overwhelming.  As someone who was raised by a southern mother and grandmother the chicken needed some onion, garlic paprika and some salt!  The collard green slaw was not appetizing at all.  Maybe if it was sautéed a bit.  Macaroni & cheese needed to be tighter.  The biscuit was amazing tho,but lemon butter is better suited for fish.  Plain salted butter(preferably Kerry Gold) pr honey butter would have sent that biscuit over the moon!  I was craving fried chicken that night and my craving wasn't satisfied.",2.0
"First time Waffle & Chicken for me and I loved it. I had the Buffalo Chicken with Blue Cheese Waffle - a special. The chicken was just perfect. Really tender and crisp. The blue cheese was a nice contrast to the ""hot"" chicken and the sweet touch of the waffle added nicely. Overall highly recommended.",5.0
"Seating is not ideal, the music is way loud. The chicken I had was old, but the waffles with the blueberry butter was amazing. The rest of the dishes like the Mac and cheese tasted like it came from the box with a sprinkle of bread crumbs, even though it was a bit soupy. The pickled plate was absolutely disgusting. I don't think I'll be going back. It was nearly $100 for two.... not worth it",2.0

"I ate dinner here last night and I loved it! The hostess was super nice, the bartender made outstanding cocktails! The food was fantastic. I got the autumn daiquiri to drink (2 of me don't judge me) it was so delicious. For dinner me and my gal friend both had the chicken bucket. 3 pieces of heaven! The batter is crispy (yum) and has a herbal flavor (sage?) which was both surprising and delightful. The buttermilk biscuit was traditional, beautiful and appreciated. Now the collard slaw-- holy moly I loved this fantastic side. It's a tangy vinegary slaw with the perfect amount of mayo and it complimented the whole dang shebang. The quality of the chicken was impressive. I don't know if it's organic or free range but I hope it is, and it should be for the price. The meal was around $18 I think, the portion size was perfectly generous but I did shamefully eat the whole thing. honey was yum and hot sauce was franks. We sat at the bar and it was a stellar choice. Bravo sweet chick!",5.0
"Why can't fried chicken and waffles be good for my health ???? If they were, I'd be here daily. The fried chicken and bacon waffles were splendid, service was friendly  and place was cute. I like the idea behind the three butters but was not too enthralled with them. However the chicken was crisp, if slightly lacking in salt & the bacon waffles were dreamy. Not cheap though.",4.0
"all i can say is , ""That's delicious!.""Went for brunch. The house margarita of the day, hibiscus, was AMAZING. cheese grits-- off the wall. The eggs benny- love! the chicken and waffles, so good, the pulled pork with the Carolina rub and poached egg-- Delicious. Hollie our waitress was amazing, the owners were very friendly and laid back. Would love to try this spot for dinner.I went with 3 friends and our alcohol bill was 3 times our food bill, but it was worth every penny. an amazing plus, the music is GREAT. someone knows how to pick throw back pandora stations. Eating waffles and southern pork while listening to old school Dr.Dre, Notorious BIG, and Salt n Peppa--- couldn't ask for a better Saturday afternoon!",5.0
"Not impressed at all. This place is like a less delicious Pies n Thighs. Long wait, they ran out of all the things we wanted to order, waitress was annoying, food was super mediocre and not even filling, music was loud.

The shells and cheese were smooth, creamy and enough for two. The chicken was crisp, golden and tender, but not too greasy.

"My mother saw an outstanding review on the local news station and thought it'd be a great place to catch a bite to eat. Knowing how compact and eclectic the area of Williamsburg can be, I gave her a brief synopsis of the ""new"" neighborhood as opposed to the industrial and vaguely unknown area she used to know growing up. My mother is wheelchair bound and it took us almost an hour to find parking on a early summer afternoon in August. There was a very steep incline into the store and the staff was accommodating and even helped me pull my mother up the ramp into the restaurant. It was very small but a great location because the area is filled with bars, quaint shops and specialty stores. Of course we ordered their infamous chicken and waffles and waited patiently as we watched others devour their food. Our plates finally came and I wasn't the least bit impressed. The waffles weren't hot and the chicken was lukewarm at best. Not wanting to judge, before I actually took a bite, I looked for condiments and only saw syrup and had to request butter and hot sauce (never received or was aware that there were three different flavors of butter available). The skin from the chicken easily peeled away from it, as if from a frozen TV dinner. it was a bit dry and to be honest, I would have thought it was from Banquet or Swanson or a similar company if I wasn't actually eating in the restaurant. I gave up on the chicken and ate the waffles, and although they weren't hot, they were really good; light, fluffy and filling. They had an assortment of custom sodas and advertised a free beer with the order which I thought was pretty cool.  All in all I didn't have a great experience with the meal I ordered and I'm a bit hesitant to go back and try something new, but the warm service of the staff and appealing pictures and description of different menu items may persuade me to give it a second shot.",2.0

"After growing up in the suburbs and associating fried chicken with The Colonel or Popeye, one can deduce why I do not hold fried chicken with much esteem. The overly greasy and steroid riddled variance that I've been brought up on gives this Southern staple a bad name. Now I will describe to the best of my ability life after Sweet Chick. I was able to walk in on a weekday night and grab a tale instantly.The environment was fitting for the setting and the staff was congenial. I perused the pricey menu and couldn't elect one selection because numerous items vied for my attention. The menu is pricey, to the tune of I could order a 62 piece chicken breast meal from KFC for the price of one entree but I'd rather pass on the diagnosis of diabetes that would entail with the former. This predicament was further complicated when I the waitress pointed out the equally appealing specials on the chalk board behind me. I went all in and chose the hot and honey fried chicken and waffles. The waffles came out with three butters and served more as a sweet compliment to the savory chicken. The waffles were expertly made with great texture and flakiness. The butters, above average syrup and powdered sugar should all be used sparingly as the waffle on its own with minimal aid accentuates the chicken the way it was meant to. This is truly a case where the sum of its parts were greater than the whole. I would not trek out to get the waffles as a stand alone item but if that is your thinking, you are not taking it as the chef intended. The fried chicken was despicably good. If the fried chicken were a broadway play it would be The Book of Mormon. It is so good it makes me angry that I didn't discover it yesterday. The all too simple combination of Frank's hot sauce and real honey are bonafide game changers. The chicken was meaty and moist, you could tell the pieces offered were selected carefully.. It was fried to a perfect crispiness but lacked the greasiness that is all too common with such a dish. The seasoning wasn't too elaborate but I give the chef credit for showing restraint and keeping it simple because the chicken is cooked too well to be drowned out in a sea of spices. I never got the hype of Momofuku, the chicken isn't that good that you can only sell it sparingly.

The chicken and waffles are served with three different butters. The lemon butter was delicious and made the whole plate taste of the dish even better!Parking is tough because it is all street parking and this is a busy area but after some searching I was able to find a spot.

"We went to Sweet Chick for brunch and immediately fell in love with the place. Motown was blasting, there's a big charming open table in the middle of the room, the bar is cute and the wait staff is friendly.My boyfriend ordered the Eggs Benny (over pulled chicken) and I got the Chicken and Waffles- both were realllllllly good. First thought: Sweet Chick will give Pies & Thighs and the Commodore a run for their $$.  Second thought: (and my only complaint) the prices are totally reasonable WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE CHICKEN AND WAFFLES. For $16 you get one small breast, one small drumstick and a waffle.  It's a little pricey for what you get, but it's right on BedFord next to the L stop, so it's parr for the strip. Either way, we'll be going back again soon.Welcome to the neighborhood Sweet Chick!",4.0
"Yes, yes, yes!!!Last Wednesday I decided to spent a nice evening with my friend. We were looking for a place with good vibe, weren't sure about sort of food we were looking for. Walking down the Bedford Ave, we heard live music, we decided to check Sweet Chick out. We ordered 2 servings of chicken with waffels, it was sooooo good! Three sorts of butter it was served with were just amazing. I always like to experience something new. Sweet chick is right there for you to provide you an unique food experience. The vibe of the place was really nice, atmosphere - totally welcoming. The live music just made it even better :) I highly recommend, I'll be back soon guys! :)",5.0
"We went here for brunch on a Saturday around 11:30 am and had a short ten minute wait. The service was excellent and I loved the casual, yet trendy, ambiance which is typical of Williamsburg. My husband devoured his chicken and waffles and I had the blueberry pancakes which were perfectly cooked. I wish they made egg florentine but they didn't carry spinach. We also had one of their starter brioche pastries which were nice and warm. The place was pretty packed throughout the time we were there but it has spacious seating so you don't feel cramped.",4.0
So I give them four stars  the chicken was good I still like pies and thighs better.The waffles was nothing to run home about but the lemon butter and I believe the blueberries butter was delicious.It was really slow than god the Mac and cheese I give a 4 it's really creamy it's not the traditional.The service was great the bartender Blair gave great conversation and was down to earth I will return,4.0
"I went to Sweet Chick after a long day of apartment searching throughout Brooklyn and I was glad I did. The service wasn't perfect and we saw another, larger, table with a more attentive server order before we were even given water or asked if we wanted drinks, but the food made up for that. I began to look over the menu, skeptically, but realized that they provided ""chicken"" for vegetarians!!! I could not have been happier that 1) I did not have to combine two appetizers and 2) I would get the full experience. The food, when it finally came out (we were starving when we ordered and sorry that we didn't get the Mac and Cheese to start), was delicious! The fried ""chicken"" was beautifully done, though mine was fake chicken, it was still juicy and well seasoned. I used to eat meat, and it was definitely on par with the stuff that I remember! The mushroom waffles were great, as well. They give you a lot of butters to try and I preferred the ones that weren't sweet, and it was so good I had to remind myself that it was butter and I should use it accordingly. My plate was completely clear and wiped clean when I was done... I was a little embarrassed! My friend ordered the regular chicken and waffles and she was happy, as well. We decided to do a dessert. I ordered the bourbon pecan pie and my friend ordered the double chocolate pudding. The pecan pie was to die for and both desserts were EXTREMELY RICH, savory, and tasty but I think we would have been better off sharing one dessert. Neither of us finished more than half of it. We came in on a Saturday night around 6/7 or so and the rush happened as soon as we sat down. I would recommend coming a little earlier because I saw people waiting at the bar for awhile before being seated. The place isn't very big. Also, remember the area you're in. The other patrons weren't totally my cup of tea, but the food made it worth it.",4.0
Great service and great food. Cool vibe and nice and cosy if you're after chicken and waffles.The batter for the fried chicken was a little too crispy for my liking but it was still good. Collard and carrot slaw is highly recommended as a side. Also recommend the general tso's chicken if you want something a bit different and a bit spicy.,4.0
"An east coast/west coast chicken-and-waffle showdown between this joint and Little Skillet is in order-- both offerings perfectly cook the meat to a uniform heat and moisture, sealing in the juices for a full natural flavor without compromising the essential crunch of the batter. Paired with equally duo-textural (in this case, Belgian) waffles with just a hint of sweetness dusted with powders sugar and a trio of butters of varying levels of fruit and spice, this dish is a full celebration of the flavor complexity available in soul food refined over generations. Sweet Chick has a bit of an edge over Littke Skillet as a full-service restaurant as opposed to a storefront carryout, especially with its brunch cocktail offerings, including an understated watermelon bellini with just enough volume to assert both components. Your move, San Francisco.",5.0
Loved the food! Chicken was seasoned to perfection the waffles were fantastic good variety. I also recommend the sweet potato mash although I suggest some salt. I love their club soda as well. Brought my mom here for her bday she loved the theme and food I even got a free dessert for some service mixup very good customer service fresh food,5.0
"I've been walking by Sweet Chick for months now, falsely believing it's chickeney, waffeley goodness was never to be mine since I'm a strict vegetarian. How wrong I was! A few weeks ago a friend and I dropped in for a nightcap and dessert (side note: banana bread pudding, delish) and I saw that they do, in fact, have vegetarian fried chicken. Hallelujah! Went back for the main event today and holy smokes was I impressed. I give this place four stars instead of five for two reasons though. The first is price. 16 bucks for four waffles and two pieces of chicken/fake chicken is teetering on insane. Whatever though, such is Williamsburg. The second mark against Sweet chick is service. I've never be waited on by such a dour, uninterested server before in my life. She made us feel like sitting in her section was an imposition on whatever else she'd rather be doing with her saturday afternoon. It's not like we didn't get our food or she screwed up our order or anything, we just weren't made to feel welcome. Bar staff was also unfriendly when we were waiting to be seated. This place would be perfect if they brought in some southern manners to go along with the cuisine.",4.0
Stay away from the appetizers. The Mac and cheese tasted like velvetta out of the box and the duck sliders tasted like sloppy joes. Go straight to the chicken and waffles.,3.0
"We went to Sweet Chick for brunch and immediately fell in love with the place. Motown was blasting, there's a big charming open table in the middle of the room, the bar is cute and the wait staff is friendly.My boyfriend ordered the Eggs Benny (over pulled chicken) and I got the Chicken and Waffles- both were realllllllly good.

I was very excited about visiting Sweet Chicks today that I came from Coney Island to get some of their famous  Chicken and Waffles. I have been to Sweet Chicks twice before but today will have me not going back for a while.  Today I walked in and the waiter was short with me and my boyfriend. we asked to sit and wait at the bar because we preferred to be seated by the window for our meal and she was a bit snappy about it. At the bar my boyfriend was not asked for his I.D. but when seated by the window I was asked for my I.D. for my drink. When we received our food they forgot to give us the butter and hot sauce so we waited for our waiter to return but since she was writing on the chalk board we asked the bar tender. We ordered the chicken and waffles as usual but one order of the bacon cheddar and the other was rosemary and mushroom. We received two orders of bacon and cheddar waffles. I also noticed while I was looking through the menu two items that I had ordered another time were not there and my boyfriend and I asked if there was another menu. We were given another menu that still did not have what I was looking for on it but when I looked at the Sweet Chicks web page I found it. Throughout our time being seated the waiter came over all but once to check up. Since I have been here twice before I did not expect such service as I received today. The service could have been a whole lot better especially considering that the restaurant was not busy at the time. very disappointing.,2.0

"I've been back to Sweet Chick a handful of time since my original review and continue to love what they're doing at the corner of 8th and Bedford.Brunch - Didn't realize this was happening until recently and a group of three of us rolled in this afternoon. The place was packed as usual, but we were seated quickly. They were experimenting with a corn breakfast sandwich/muffin. Cheese, perfectly over-medium egg and bacon baked right into a sweet cornmeal muffin. $4 each and worth it.Everyone was pleased with their entrees: Shrimp n Grits, Pork Hash & Chicken/Waffles. Just great comfort food. The french press coffee was a nice touch. Great bloody and the Margarita of the Day (pineapple) was perfect for my lingering hangover.General Tso's Chicken - So glad to hear that they added this to the main dinner menu. It's just awesome. The broccoli/rice waffle is the perfect light pairing for the heavy flavor of the sauce on the chicken. Easily one of the most unique and delicious things I've eaten all year.Ambiance continues to be decidedly Williamsburg. 60's-90's RnB playing with attractive and hip servers everywhere. Drinks are great too and the breeze coming in off Bedford is welcome after wolfing down a pound of chicken and waffles.Oh, and of course the people watching is world class.",5.0

"Horrible, Horrible service.When we first entered the restaurant, we were not greeted-the staff looked at us, but did not acknowledge us until we started to move ourselves to a table. One of the waiters ran over and told us to pick a section of the restaurant. We were seated, and someone came over to give us water, but did not give us a menu. We sat looking around for about 5 minutes because the waiters were all hanging out by the bar, chatting with a few people sitting there. We ended up getting our own menus from a basket, when one of the waiters saw that he came over and without apologizing for forgetting the menu's or even greeting us as his server, he just asked for our drink orders. We told him we didn't have drink menu's so he ran and got them. We ordered, our waiter wasn't even the one to bring our food and was inattentive for the rest of our meal. Also, we were not made aware that the night's specials were written on a chalk board wall at the back of the restaurant- we didn't realize they were there until halfway through our meal.Also, I ordered a kale and bacon salad with a lemon vinaigrette on the side, The brought out a white dressing that tasted like sour cream, I asked where the vinaigrette was and they explained that the dressing is lemon in sour cream...which is NOT a vinaigrette, and tasted awful with the bacon.",2.0
"Fantastic waffles!  They come with different ingredients mixed into the batter--bacon cheddar, rosemary, mushroom, broccoli... They're all good and taste even better with the various butters they provide: lemon, blueberry, and herb.  Biscuits are large, but way too dry--however they're good with any of the butters (or a combo of butters--lemon blueberry, lemon/herb..).  Cute interior like many other restaurants in Williamsburg--walls are dressed with old doors complete with door handles, glasses are mason jars, and candles light the restaurant at night.",4.0

"I was yelping vegetarian friendly places in Williamsburg last week and sweet chick came up. I never would have known they had so many vegetarian options.  We went after reading the good reviews and happy we did!  The waitstaff was friendly, helpful, and so attentive. We started with the pickles. The pickles were very crisp, delicious, and had that perfect sour/sweet ratio.  Then I got the veggie chicken and waffles (mushroom and rosemary) and my husband got the vegetarian sweet chick bucket.  When it came, we barely spoke.  We mustered, ""ohmigod, this is so good"" a few times, and then stuffed our faces again. The waffles were soft, crispy, airy, and slightly savory from the mushroom and herbs. I was worried the waffle would be too flavored, but it was a hint of herbed mushroom goodness in the best way. The veggie chicken was seitan and the crunch factor was delightful!  We enjoyed every bit of our meal. The tables next to us also gasped, ""ohmigod so good."" I think it was clear everyone at Sweet Chick was very very happy.",5.0
"I am so surprised this place has such good reviews. If I could I would give this place 0 stars. My friends and I went to brunch there a couple of Sundays back and very much regretted it afterward. I ordered the chicken and waffles, and not even ten minutes after ordering it my food was brought out. It must have just been siting in the kitchen because when it was brought to me it was rather cold. The waffles were alright, the chicken was just plain sad. While eating, we felt a bit rushed, right after we were finished eating we were ushered out. Also to be mentioned, was our waitress who was completely rude. My friends and I aren't even those annoying customers who ask tons of questions about the menu, we knew right away what we wanted, didn't ask her to bend over backwards or anything, and she just had such an attitude, so unprofessional its ridicules. Seriously don't even waist your time here, just head over to pies-n-thighs, which is nearby.

"Waited much longer than advised for a Friday night table for four. Staff was friendly and attentive, but food left a lot to be desired. Very happy that they offer a vegetarian version of the fried chicken - the seitan was tasty and the batter had flavor. The waffle, however was cold and bland and the syrup was a crappy corn syrup version of ""maple.""Prices are steep for a wanna-be Southern comfort food type place. Highlight was definitely the brussel sprouts side!Might give them another chance after they have some time to work the kinks out. I'll give them this - it's better than the bubble tea joint they replaced. I never ate there once in the five years I've lived around here haha.",2.0
"I'd say it has everything you'd want in a great brunch place except for the fact that you have to literally fight your way to get here on Bedford Ave. I don't typically walk away from a place remembering the music but on a Sunday they were blasting a little TLC Don't go chasing waterfalls which I kind of appreciated. I went with the pork hash and it came served in a skillet, poached egg on top which I thought was all good. When I asked for ketchup and hot sauce, it was brought out quickly and with a smile. I've taken a look at the prices and although I haven't eaten there for dinner the prices do seem a bit higher than a Pies N' Thighs (I know totally separate experiences). For the area, you can do a lot better in terms of Southern fare for your dollar but Sweet Chick is a safe choice if you want a place close to mass transit, family friendly, and music that non-hipsters can enjoy.",4.0

The waffle, however was cold and bland and the syrup was a crappy corn syrup version of ""maple.""Prices are steep for a wanna-be Southern comfort food type place. Highlight was definitely the brussel sprouts side!Might give them another chance after they have some time to work the kinks out. I'll give them this - it's better than the bubble tea joint they replaced. I never ate there once in the five years I've lived around here haha.",2.0
"I'd say it has everything you'd want in a great brunch place except for the fact that you have to literally fight your way to get here on Bedford Ave. I don't typically walk away from a place remembering the music but on a Sunday they were blasting a little TLC Don't go chasing waterfalls which I kind of appreciated. I went with the pork hash and it came served in a skillet, poached egg on top which I thought was all good. When I asked for ketchup and hot sauce, it was brought out quickly and with a smile. I've taken a look at the prices and although I haven't eaten there for dinner the prices do seem a bit higher than a Pies N' Thighs (I know totally separate experiences). For the area, you can do a lot better in terms of Southern fare for your dollar but Sweet Chick is a safe choice if you want a place close to mass transit, family friendly, and music that non-hipsters can enjoy.",4.0

"Host was a huge asshole. Came here after an event with a crowd without reservations, but open and willing to spread out, break up, and wait.  Wish I could review the food, but frankly I'd rather spend my money elsewhere.  Having worked in hospitality we all understood the challenges of the situation, but we don't need to put up with that type of poor customer service.  If you want nice people, good drinks, and a laid back atmosphere go next door to Peter's.",1.0

"I came here during the week at around 630 with a friend. We sat by the window because there was a nice breeze and it was pretty empty inside. We got two of the chicken and waffle specials. The chicken was ok (it was fried chicken parm) but nothing special. The waffles were amazing. We also got coconut rice pudding for dessert, which had too much whipped cream mixed in, overwhelmingly cool whip-y. I've never made rice pudding this way but maybe that's normal. The staff was friendly but one thing that always leaves a bad taste in my mouth is being asked to move when I'm in the middle of eating. Someone else sitting by the window complained about the breeze and our waitress came over, asked us to get up, pulled our table (with food on it) away from the wall to close the window and we pretty much had to move the table back ourselves. We didn't make a big deal of it but I was annoyed that my meal was interrupted and I was suddenly very warm. I didn't like that our comfort was sacrificed because the other couple (who hadn't even been served yet) wanted to sit by the window but didn't like the breeze. Here's and idea, don't sit by the window. And then the bill came and it was about $100 with tip. Not a terrible place but I won't be going back here, simply because of the staff's disregard for ALL of their customers (stubborn, I know), which is a shame because the waffles were pretty good.",2.0
Freshly squeezed orange juice! Whaaaaaat!! You can't beat this. Chicken and waffles were delicious!!! The kale salad was good too. Staff was friendly. Place is small and cozy but they accommodated our party of 12. We will definitely be back to try other things on the menu.,5.0
"Love this place for the chicken and waffles i had here. So far this has got to be the best chicken I have ever had in my life!

"Walking around bedford one day me and my friend walk past this sweet chick restaurant, from the outside it looks like a cute,trendy little restaurant, there were people inside, they looked like they were having a good time. So we decide to go in. We sit down the waitress tells us there a limited menu we say ok were not that picky. we look at there menu all they had were drinks and appetizers we already seated they already served us water which may I add was basically the equivalent of drinking  water from a hoes it was warm and smelled. We did not want to be rude and just get up and go.So we both ordered sliders. The sliders were good and defiantly not worth the price we spent max 15 min there we asked for the check and the staff members started staring and obviously talking about us. I mean I know were young but still we didn't look like hoodlums that were just gonna run off and not pay. We pay way we owe and tip a few bucks and leave. I sadly can't add to the amount all the good reviews. I would have liked to have a better experience",2.0
Deeeelicious!! I had the chicken and waffles. The waffles had bacon bits in them and the waffles tasted fresh and home made. The chicken was perfectly crisp and had great flavors.

"Sweet Chick has the same vintagey atmosphere that I have come to expect from Williamsburg restaurants. The wait time was not bad (10 min on a Sunday night) but we were a little put off by the music they were playing. Electronic dance music and R&B played throughout our dinner, but 1950s-era Johnny Cash would've been much more appropriate for the Southern-inspired decor. Like nearly every other restaurant in the area, everything, including the syrup is served in a mason jar, except bizarrely, the check, which comes to you tucked in a drinking glass. We ordered the mac n cheese appetizer ($6), which had good flavor but the huge pasta shells were a bit undercooked. Then, we ordered the regular chicken with bacon cheddar waffles ($16) and the special, General Tso fried chicken with a broccoli rice waffle. The regular fried chicken is only fine, with a rosemary flavor to the meat that I was not crazy about. The bacon cheddar waffle was disappointing. There were only a few, very large bacon chunks and the waffle was studded with raisins that were not indicated on the menu. I found it so off putting that I even asked our waiter if the raisins were in the waffle on purpose. The General Tso chicken was good - the sauce had a nice flavor and the broccoli-rice waffle was interesting. We also ordered the brussel sprouts ($8), which I really disliked. The hominy didn't add anything, and the flavor was incredibly sweet, with even more raisins stuck in there. I have no idea what is going on with all of the raisins at Sweet Chick but I am not a fan. At this point, I knew that I was going to be spending almost $60 inc tip for this meal that I wasn't enjoying, so I offered to make dessert at home instead of ordering one of the $8 desserts available. Bedford Ave is so expensive now that I don't know how anyone can afford to open a restaurant that's not some major chain. Sweet Chick tries, but the prices have to be high enough to pay the rent that the Southern-style comfort food can't meet expectations. Either this place should be serving food that rightfully commands higher prices or they should've opened up a couple avenues east or west of Bedford. Williamsburg has such a vibrant restaurant scene that places can thrive without being in such a prime Bedford location. Brooklyn Star on Conselyea more successfully executes Southern Style comfort food, and I much prefer the fried chicken at Commodore on Metropolitan ($11, inc biscuits) or Pies n Thighs on Driggs ($13, inc biscuit and a side).",2.0

"I was at the restaurant last week (July 5th lunch time), although the food was good, the host was downright rude! He noticed my phone number was from outside NY and might have thought that I was a tourist (but I have been living in NY for 10 years). He never called me for my table after 30 to 40 minutes waiting time. When I confronted him, he has given 4 other reservations, mind you, after me on his list. His excuse was, he called only once. Well, his sassiness didn't stop there. When I was merely explaining myself that I didn't receive any phone call from him, nor my phone showed any missed call or voicemail, he looked annoyed. With his attitude I asked if he's saying that I was lying, and to my dismay, he said and I quote, ""I might just have."" Never once he apologized or intended to apologize in order to calm the situation down. Instead, he even gave me more attitude when he said if he wanted me to tell people who were eating at a table to go away so that he could make a table for me? No need to go there at all. As a customer, I gave this restaurant my money, so did my friends, in exchange for good food and great service, but the host insulted me and my friends in front of other guests and diners. The food was mediocre to good. I ordered the infamous chicken waffle and shared it with my friend because it's quite a big portion. I also ordered a side of home fries potato, this one was okay, nothing outstanding. My friend ordered a side of maple bacon. Don't get this order. The bacons were chewy and sweet. Expect not of your regular American bacon in BLT sandwich. The waffle is one of the best waffles I've tasted, soft and the crunchy level was just enough. But the service earned this review one star.

"Came here for a late Thursday-night dinner with my sister who is a big-time chicken and waffles fan.  Being a novice in the field of this poultry-pastry combo, I was eager to find out what all the fuss was about.  I was worried that it might be a little too sceney considering the Bedford Ave location, but was pleasantly surprised to find a warm, relaxed vibe as we were seated at one of the tables next to the open window looking out onto the street.  We started with the trio of country spreads.  The flavors were very simple, and as a whole they were rustic and satisfying. Also a great value for a group starter as they give you generous portions of each spread.  For our entree we shared the chicken and waffles, and although it was my first experience with this southern classic I can't imagine how they could improve much on the dish.  The chicken was moist, and crunchy on the outside, seasoned nicely.  The waffle was crispy outside and light and fluffy inside, made thick, belgian-style.  I finished my half of it quickly, and probably could have eaten a whole plate by myself pretty easily.I plan to go back and try their other dishes to see how they compare!",4.0

I also ordered a side of home fries potato, this one was okay, nothing outstanding. My friend ordered a side of maple bacon. Don't get this order. The bacons were chewy and sweet. Expect not of your regular American bacon in BLT sandwich. The waffle is one of the best waffles I've tasted, soft and the crunchy level was just enough. But the service earned this review one star. Although the waitress who served us was very accommodating, but the host, please, just replace him. He is bad for business - that's the bottom line.",1.0
"Came here for a late Thursday-night dinner with my sister who is a big-time chicken and waffles fan.  Being a novice in the field of this poultry-pastry combo, I was eager to find out what all the fuss was about.  I was worried that it might be a little too sceney considering the Bedford Ave location, but was pleasantly surprised to find a warm, relaxed vibe as we were seated at one of the tables next to the open window looking out onto the street.  We started with the trio of country spreads.  The flavors were very simple, and as a whole they were rustic and satisfying. Also a great value for a group starter as they give you generous portions of each spread.  For our entree we shared the chicken and waffles, and although it was my first experience with this southern classic I can't imagine how they could improve much on the dish.  The chicken was moist, and crunchy on the outside, seasoned nicely.  The waffle was crispy outside and light and fluffy inside, made thick, belgian-style.  I finished my half of it quickly, and probably could have eaten a whole plate by myself pretty easily.I plan to go back and try their other dishes to see how they compare!",4.0

DID NOT, disappoint. I had the chicken n waffles and my Nana had the Shrimp n Grits! With that and the french press full of liquid gold a.k.a coffee, ooh ooh, and the buttermilk biscuits, and the watermelon bellini...well how the hell is a girl s'posed to walk out sexy when all you really want to do is open the top button of your jeans and lean back in your chair.

"The chicken is decent, the waffles are good (especially with honey and hot sauce) but it's pretty pricey. They do vegetarian fried chicken which my boyfriend said was good mock chicken. I'm giving it a low review though because the staff was so inattentive. I went one night with friends and we sat down and waited 25 minutes to have our order taken. We were definitely giving the help eyes to the host, the waiters, and the bussers. When the host finally came over he was annoyed with us for flagging him down. We asked him how long food took as an estimate because we were running out of time and he was rude to us as we apologized that we'd have to leave because we didn't have time to wait for 20 minutes and then eat on top of that. We even left a few dollars for sitting down and having water, I just couldn't believe how huffy they were. I went back for brunch the next day and actually got to eat. We took some leftovers but the busier packaged one plate into 2 boxes and we didn't notice til we got home. It meant that my boyfriend couldn't eat any of it because only the chicken was packaged. 't just overall isn't 16 bucks good. They did however have amazing music playing.",2.0

"The food here is incredible. Came in for a quick lunch, I got chicken & waffle (C&W)  and my friend got the grilled chicken sandwich which were both delish. We also ordered a side of Mac & Cheese oo God yum! There was a deal if you get a chicken sandwich or C&W, you get a beer or soda for free. The Mac n cheese is really, really good, creamy, cheesy shells. When the entrees came I was stoked, chicken & waffles were perfection. The waffle was crisp yet soft, with crispy flavorful chicken. My friends grilled chicken sandwich was a perfect size, you see juice just dripping from the moist chicken breast. The sandwich was dressed with thick slices of bacon, it had a sirracha sauce that was on point, right amount of heat, but not a lingering discomfort . She ordered it with an arugula salad, great dressing. You can pick fries or salad w/ the sandwich...but then we saw a waiter come out with fries to give to another table, and notice that they looked like potato stix. We were second guessing on the salad... Cuz the fries looked ill, but we will definitely come back to try a lot of other things on that menu.",5.0

It's way overpriced for what you get. The fried chicken bucket gives you three not-huge pieces and a bowl of slaw. That'll be seventeen bucks, please. When you order the chicken and waffles, you get two pieces of chicken and half a waffle. Sixteen bucks, please. And four dollars for a soda? FOUR?I mean, it's all relative; if you make enough not to have to care, enjoy this place with my blessing.

My roommate and I both got the chicken and biscuits, a staple at this restaurant. She opted for the bacon version but I went with plain (I wanted the authentic experience). The batter was perfect, not too heavy. I wish it would have had more of kick to it but not everyone likes spice. So I added quite a bit of hot sauce.

I couldn't eat it. Was this an off-day? All these good reviews? It tasted just old or something. I was so disgusted. Then I figured okay, let me eat my waffle with syrup, which I proceed to do, but it was so dry. I honestly make more amazing waffles with my home waffle maker... My sister got the cheesy waffle, and that had no cheese and was dry. My Coca Cola was good though...I won't go back here. I really wanted to love it, but it was SO expensive.

"It takes a really gross meal for me to not rate a place pretty well. This place was just...a waste of like $18. I got the standard fried chicken with waffle and my chicken tasted really gross. I couldn't eat it. Was this an off-day? All these good reviews? It tasted just old or something. I was so disgusted. Then I figured okay, let me eat my waffle with syrup, which I proceed to do, but it was so dry. I honestly make more amazing waffles with my home waffle maker... My sister got the cheesy waffle, and that had no cheese and was dry. My Coca Cola was good though...I won't go back here. I really wanted to love it, but it was SO expensive. If I had paid $8 for gross chicken I'd say okay, cut my losses, but wow, that was an expensive hit. Yuck. Much tastier spots in the Burg.",2.0
"Crazy cool neighborhood spot with a great vibe.  Super friendly (and hip) staff as well.  I know people come for the chicken and waffles, but the arctic char and pork tenderloin are ridiculously good.  As is their bourbon selection. I'll be back often.  And hope they bring brunch to the table soon.",5.0
I like it but don't get the hype,3.0
Awesome place to eat especially if you want some good Southern food here in NYC. It's a little pricy but the food is awesome. My favorite is the raspberry butter for the waffles.,5.0
"Went to sweet chick earlier today, and it's not what I thought it would be.  The waffles I have to say were the best part of my meal but my chicken was a little cold when it arrived at our table.  I could tell that it was not made fresh then served us, it was probably sitting in the back for a while before it arrived.  If served fresh I probably would of enjoyed it more.  The music was good and the bloody Mary was on point!  Nice experience but don't think I will go back.",2.0

"This was straight up incredible.  Just ate there, and felt like I had to write my first review.Incredibly light, lemony waffles - three kinds of butter and delicious maple syrup.  banging fried chicken.Just go.",5.0
I dont know why this got high ratings. I ordered mac and cheese it was good but I couldve made the same at home. Chicken was too dry on the outside and tastless on the inside. 16.00 for a waffle that was soft and a thigh and drumstick are you kidding? The man who brought our food over had his thumbs on our dishes and buckets that is a no no. Your hands shouldnt be all over someone's plate. The shoestring fries..were a joke. This place is overpriced for the food they serve.,1.0
"I had a great experience here. I ordered the ""Sweet Chick"" (two pieces of chicken and one waffle). The chicken was well spiced and juicy. And the waffle was firm but not too crisp. The waffle I chose (the highlight if the meal for me) was rosemary and mushroom, which comes with three flavors of butter (on the side).  I've had chicken and waffles at a few different places, and this was easily my favorite.",5.0

The cheddar and bacon waffles are amazing. Chicken is delicious too but the last time I came here the chicken was pretty greasy. Yes i know fried chicken is supposed to be greasy but not when you take a bite and grease spills into your mouth. Wish the place was bigger because it gets really packed at night. I still love Sweet Chick and I will be coming back,4.0
"I have only been to Sweet Chick once, however it has wowed me enough to write a review. I had the special of that particular night which was Turkey Leg Confeit with a stuffing waffle, and mashed potatoes. The turkey leg was absolutely incredible and I am not typically a turkey leg person. I was in a rare mood, and it was delicious. The mashed potatoes, were just standard run of the mill and nothing to write home about. Let us move on to the very best part; the waffle! I like waffles, who doesn't like waffles? That in mind, it's rare that when eating breakfast or any other meal for that matter, that I would ever chose a waffle over something else. However, these were the best waffles I have ever had. The batter is just incredible. Its the lightest fluffiest inside, with a nice crisp outside and the homemade butters are on point. Definitely worth a try! I'll be going back for the traditional chicken n' waffles next time.",4.0
"We had a fried chicken craving and decided to make the trip out to Sweet Chick.  The fried chicken and waffles were delicious.  The chicken was moist and had a lot of flavor.  It was very juicy but not oily like some friend chicken.  I thought the waffles were nothing special though the different types of butter they give you for the waffles was cool.  My girlfriend ordered the kale salad which was also pretty tasty.  Also ordered the Arnold Palmer soda which was unique and went well with my chicken and waffles.  I wouldn't make a special trip out to Brooklyn in the future, but if I was in the area I would definitely stop by again.",4.0
"This place is not bad. It's a cute space (kind of laid out like it's the bizarro brother of Allswell, located only a few blocks away). It took a good while for the bartender to take our order, which is fine. It was busy, it's to be expected. We were also talking a lot, and we don't give off the pain-in-the-ass vibe. Overall, service was friendly and better than a lot of other places on the North Side.The chicken and waffles were REALLY GOOD. It's a menu that speaks to my soul. I really have no complaints about the food. But it's a soul food menu with fancy food prices. And it's obnoxious. I just feel foolish paying $9 for a plate of pickled ANYTHING. $16 for Chicken & Waffles? I mean, come on. Get over yourselves. And it's not like it's for a ridiculous crapload of food- not that I'd prefer it. I just think a smaller amount of food for a more reasonable price is the way to go. Nobody wants to pay more than $12 (maybe $14) for Chicken & Waffles. Reel it in. And maybe the chicken is sourced from some awesome farmer in upstate New York (I understand food costs and percentages), but are customers paying for the fancy chicken OR your fancy rent? I think making some small changes to pricing would make this a great spot for everyone, regulars and self-proclaimed food enthusiasts alike.",3.0
"Pricey, but worth it (especially if you or your dining companion is veggie/vegan). The fried chicken is light, not too greasy, and the waffles are savory and filling. Apparently, the vegan chicken is to die for, too. One caveat: don't show up during happy hour and expect a full selection, they have a reduced menu during that time frame. Otherwise, brilliant,",5.0
"Had dinner with friends on 12th October. The chicken was plucking good. We also had the duck ragu, kale slaw and the pate. It was all good the only sound from our table was yumm and mmm. The waite staff was very friendly and accomodating. Very casual and comfortable atmosphere. They will definitely see us again.",4.0
"Nothing to rave about at all.  Had the original chicken w/ bacon and cheddar waffles + 3 piece chicken bucket w/ biscuit.  While the chicken meat was moist, the flour coating was overdone, hard, and seemed burnt.  No comparison to the chicken served nearby at Brooklyn Bowl.  Completely disappointed after reading all the reviews here.  Definitely a one time deal for me and would even prefer Popeye's chicken over what we were served.   Perhaps people rated the chicken after having a few $5 drink happy hour specials that would make anything fried taste good...",1.0
"Came on a Tuesday night with a group of eight. The place wasn't very packed but we had a bit of trouble keeping our table. (We made a 7PM reservation but most of us didn't show up until 7:30PM and they said they were going to give away our table. Luckily we got there before that happened.) For appetizers we ordered the duck sliders, bacon-wrapped oysters, and mac and cheese. The duck sliders and oyster were good but my favorite was the mac and cheese. For the main meal, everyone got the chicken and waffles. For the waffles you can get them classic, bacon and cheddar, or rosemary and mushroom. I tried the bacon and cheddar and the rosemary and mushroom was liked them both. I'm a bigger fan of the rosemary and mushroom though because I could taste the flavor in them better. To top off the waffles they offer three types of butter (lemon, herb, berry). The lemon butter was my favorite with the waffles. Lastly, the fried chicken was good, but not as juicy as I would've liked. I did have a better experience with the chicken here than I did at Buttermilk Channel though; not as heavily breaded and less dry. Compared to Buttermilk Channel, this place is a little more homey/cozy, while I'd say Buttermilk Channel has a more upscale vibe. You get bigger portions here and I like the chicken and waffles here better than at Buttermilk Channel. I enjoyed my appetizers and sides more at Buttermilk Channel though.",4.0
"My boyfriend and I had date night here. Upon entry we were greeted by friendly eyes. The set up if the restaurant was quite ""cafeteria"" like,however with the low light and attempted ambiance it was still quaint. After mulling over the menu and taking notice to the different names of items ""purple drank"" and ""Tiger tiger Woods Yall"" (a drink).. We were quite confused as to the theme IF they even proclaimed one. Moving on we went for what the place was known for CHICKEN AND WAFFLES... I had the Bacon and Cheddar Waffles w/ Fried Chicken. The waffles were actually good. The chicken was only O K I'm not a real expert on fried chicken but it was edible. My boyfriend had the classic waffles with general tso chicken...once again the waffles,GREAT, the chicken was very salty and the soy sauce was rich you needed to drink aaaallll the water on your table. NOW for the drinks...I had ""Sweet chick"" can't recall the liquor but it had watermelon juice a d a spicy brown sugar rim...SOUNDS GREAT RIGHT???.... Mmmmmm it was very watered down and for ten bux I would go two doors down to the bar (which we did after ;) ). Anyway the bf had the ""Tiger Tiger Woods Yall""...which really tasted like a spiked ginger ale *le sigh*. The overall was O K. Would I go back? Most likely not.",3.0
