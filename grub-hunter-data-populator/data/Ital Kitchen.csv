"Delicious food -very reasonably priced - great music/vibes relaxed atmosphere - a small hidden gem.  The waitress was not sociable or attentive  at all despite continued attempts at normal, friendly banter. It seemed to us that she didn't want to be there. She came back to our table after we'd ordered asking if we wanted any sides to which I glanced at the menu, asked about the kale, she said it was small so I clearly declined; She still served the kale ($5).  I opted against bringing it up because her attitude was so grim already, I did not want to interact with her unless necessary.  I had also called to make a reservation ahead of time & upon hanging up the phone, turned to my friends & said, ""Wow that girl sounded soo grumpy""!  Dispite the blatant annoyance we did have a nice time here. Definitely worth coming; I just hope they get a new server or she changes her disposition. The service is as important if not more than the flavors (which were superb).",4.0
Totally love the chef here. He is so attentive to everyone's needs.  I can still taste his provocative approach to his delicacies even days later.I can't wait to go back there today. I might even wait outside today to be the first one in.,4.0
"This place has such a warm, cool vibe, like you're traveling and just stumbled into someone's kitchen. The new backyard is beautiful and there's wifi so you can also do work during the day. BYOB, this place is a well kept secret I'm only writing about because I'm scared it's too well hidden and won't be supported enough. Awesome vegan food and cool owners you can imagine actually becoming friends with. If you live here, it might even make you feel part of the neighborhood-- it did for me. It's important for gentrifiers to think about where we are spending our money, and these are locals who need our business, making delicious food and doing the right thing with sick ambiance.",5.0
"I am a fan. Loved this place, the ambience, the service of the waitress and chef! Hoping that they do well enough to hire another chef to help Mike out with the demand! I highly recommend this restaurant!!!",4.0
"I love the homey atmosphere in here. It's literally like dining in someone's living room. I love the concept of "" homeThe staff is very hard working and friendly. Attentive, giving good advice. We brought our own wine since they are byob. My husband ordered the strawberry lemonade which I'd very gingery. We ended up mixing the lemonade and our Riesling. It was da bomb!On to food. I ordered The fisherman's row which happened to be wild caught salmon with brown rice. The sauce was wonderful. My husband had the jerk chicken, spicy and well seasoned. We shared the avocado salad, fresh mixed greens with lemon juice, good portion. Can I just say,  avocado on tostones is the shit! There were about 5-6 of them in the avocado salad. So goooood! For desert,  my husband had the strawberry shortcake which he liked. Overall this place is a great choice for dinner. Nice ambiance, great staff and reasonable prices.",5.0
"So I walk in, the place is empty, except for just one man sitting at a chess board near the door. I ask does he work there, he says yes. I have to ask for a menu, he hands it to me. after looking for a while, I see that almost everything is soy based. But I call my friend, and she chooses two items. While I'm talking to her, another man walks in and sits across the chess board at the table. I ask who's in charge of the menu, New Guy says ""I am."" I let New Guy know that soy is not a good source of nutrition, especially for men, and start to offer some suggestions. The man becomes enraged and snatches his menu from my hand. Serves me right for interrupting his chess game. Also explains why the place was empty.",1.0
"Oh ital jerk chicken, how I adore thee!When I became vegan, I knew that there were certain cuisines I'd probably have to let go of like Jamaican Jerk Chicken, but now I know I don't need to. As a matter of fact, the vegan jerk chicken may be the best jerk chicken that isn't actually chicken that I ever did have.It's that good! The brown rice and baked plantains were a great compliment to the dish as well.I'd describe the dish as somewhere between ""The Whole Shebang"" sauce from the Boiling Crab (a fine seafood Southern California establishment) and Filipino Sisig (if you're even familiar)When I come back I'll probably order a side of veggies since the jerk chicken doesn't really come with a side of greens, only a green garnish. No biggie.I'll definitely be back! So glad to have found this place.",5.0
"Quiet, relaxed, BYOB! There were only three other couples who came in over the course of our 2+ hour dinner on a Tuesday evening and while the place can't seat many more than that, it kept the atmosphere quiet, intimate, and low key. I had the spicy green thumb salad which was a classic salad with spicy avocado around the edges, making an otherwise normal salad have a kick to it. The Jerk ""chicken""  was also extremely good as we're the fried plantains. I wish I had ordered some brown rice though, as the sauce form the Jerk was delicious and strong and would have been great to put over the rice. All in all it was a great meal for a non-vegetarian and I'll definitely be back.",5.0

"Ital Kitchen is AMAZING! Hands down, the best vegan meal I have eaten in my life (and that's saying a lot coming from a vegetarian who only cooks, and eats mostly vegan meals). High level: great food, great service, great ambiance and overall great place!My husband and I landed in NYC (we're from LA), and were looking for some good veggie options in Brooklyn late on a Thursday night. Yelp made it clear that our options were few, so we were thrilled when we saw that Ital Kitchen was open for another 10 mins. With my grandpa behind the wheel, we rushed over not knowing what to expect, but hopeful that we'd encounter beans and rice, at the very least. We arrived at 10:25pm and learned that the kitchen had just closed. Prepared to go to bed hungry that night, we were pleasantly surprised and extremely grateful when the ladies of Ital Kitchen volunteered to reopen the kitchen to make us a meal.We ordered jerk chicken, kale, plantains, chow mein, and a beef dish (I can't remember the name). Every dish was absolutely delicious! I couldn't get enough of the melt in your mouth, tasty jerk chicken (disclaimer: I don't like faux meats, but this stuff was addicting!). And my grandpa, who was nervous about eating at a meatless/dairy-free restaurant, loved every bit of his meal. He raved about it to everyone we saw that weekend.In addition to having great food, this place also has amazing service. The staff is very friendly-- they engaged in discussion with us, shared suggestions of places to visit, and answered my grandpa's 21 questions.

"Oh my goodness! I am usually only motivated to write when something has gone horribly, horribly wrong, but I am just back home from my first meal at Ital Kitchen (won't be the last) and had to share: I'm smitten.It's a cosy nest of a place (the Google pics really don't do it justice), full of wood, colour and texture (and candlelight, at least in the evening!). A guy playing guitar, reggae tunes and Clapton, U2 etc covers (here Fri/Sat/Sun apparently). He had a lovely easy voice, and perfectly pitched so it didn't intrude on your meal; sometimes I'm a bit dubious of live music in restaurants but this was spot on. The meal - I had the jerk ""chicken"" - was exquisite, and everything else on the menu looked great too. FYI it's a vegetarian restaurant; I dare any carnivore to go here and not be delighted with their meal. Since it was late and a snowstorm there was hardly anyone around and I got to chat a little with both the musician and the chef, a beautiful and gracious young woman. They were just such charming people, and so warm though I was a late customer. What else can I rave about?Really nicely presented food; large white plates; linen napkins; such good value ($12/13 for an entree). Generous portions too, and getting leftovers to go was not a problem.  They do brunch as well - I had a look at the menu and am definitely planning to come back and check that out.",5.0
"We really liked this place.   The food is excellent--unique, flavorful, just the right size portions.  The (fake) jerk chicken was great, as was the lemonade.  The staff were incredibly sweet and welcoming, and the chef chatted with us quite a bit.  Service is slow, but it was  crowded Friday night, and I find that most Caribbean places in the neighborhood are permanently on ""island time"".  We've heard the brunch is great and will be going back for that.",5.0
"I was so happy to be at this place. I came for Sunday brunch with a friend. We both loved the food, the atmosphere, the owner, the service, everything! We had the ackee power pot and the kale salad. They were delicious and special. I can't wait to come back, and I definitely recommend this place to others!",5.0
"This is an awesome little place with a very personal touch. DO NOT be fooled by the size. It is huge in flavors. It is a mixture of top notch French cooking techniques with the ever presence tastes of the Caribbean and actually kind of hard to describe! The kale salad was a great start. You get a sample of their amazing humus and pita while you wait and some sweet live music on the background which is a nice respite from the crazy city hustle. Just try Mike's Veggie Jerk Chicken and/or Chow Mein with a side of their aromatic rice and if you got space get a taste of their soup. The night we went it was Fish and Barley and it was out of this world! Don't forget to order the Ginger Lemonade or the Sorrel. You wont regret it. We also got a taste of their incredibly light version of a carrot cake. Wow!  We go everywhere in the city cause food is our passion and this place was indeed a lovely surprise. We look forward to our next visit. Both chefs, Ingrid and MIke, are the coolest individuals..and they will personally tend to your table. Go now before they get too big and BYOB. Great Eats!!!",5.0
"Oh my goodness! I am usually only motivated to write when something has gone horribly, horribly wrong, but I am just back home from my first meal at Ital Kitchen (won't be the last) and had to share: I'm smitten.It's a cosy nest of a place (the Google pics really don't do it justice), full of wood, colour and texture (and candlelight, at least in the evening!). A guy playing guitar, reggae tunes and Clapton, U2 etc covers (here Fri/Sat/Sun apparently). He had a lovely easy voice, and perfectly pitched so it didn't intrude on your meal; sometimes I'm a bit dubious of live music in restaurants but this was spot on. The meal - I had the jerk ""chicken"" - was exquisite, and everything else on the menu looked great too. FYI it's a vegetarian restaurant; I dare any carnivore to go here and not be delighted with their meal. Since it was late and a snowstorm there was hardly anyone around and I got to chat a little with both the musician and the chef, a beautiful and gracious young woman. They were just such charming people, and so warm though I was a late customer. What else can I rave about?Really nicely presented food; large white plates; linen napkins; such good value ($12/13 for an entree). Generous portions too, and getting leftovers to go was not a problem.  They do brunch as well - I had a look at the menu and am definitely planning to come back and check that out.",5.0
"We really liked this place.   The food is excellent--unique, flavorful, just the right size portions.  The (fake) jerk chicken was great, as was the lemonade.  The staff were incredibly sweet and welcoming, and the chef chatted with us quite a bit.  Service is slow, but it was  crowded Friday night, and I find that most Caribbean places in the neighborhood are permanently on ""island time"".  We've heard the brunch is great and will be going back for that.",5.0
"I was so happy to be at this place. I came for Sunday brunch with a friend. We both loved the food, the atmosphere, the owner, the service, everything! We had the ackee power pot and the kale salad. They were delicious and special. I can't wait to come back, and I definitely recommend this place to others!",5.0
"This is an awesome little place with a very personal touch. DO NOT be fooled by the size. It is huge in flavors. It is a mixture of top notch French cooking techniques with the ever presence tastes of the Caribbean and actually kind of hard to describe! The kale salad was a great start.
