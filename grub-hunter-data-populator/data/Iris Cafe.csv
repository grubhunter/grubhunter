"Iris is a neighborhood favorite of mine (and the significant other) for both brunch and dinner. The local-favorite tipped me to give it five, rather than four, stars.The ambience is casually beautiful and quirky without being too fussy or overly twee (although I could see where others' notions of too-much-twee might vary). But, for me, it's the perfect balance of nice but not too formal that seems like the sweet spot for dates. And the waitstaff is always friendly and is generally attentive and efficient.But the food is the point. And the food is very good. For brunch, we tend to get the chilaquiles or the avocado and cheese sandwich. Both are fairly simple but are prepared with care using great ingredients.For dinner, we've tried most of the items on the menu and all of the mains have been tasty. In particular, the mushroom dashi for the salmon is incredibly full of flavor. For starters, although it might not sound super special, try the warm sourdough with hummus. It has an almost mustardy undertone that is interesting and delicious. And the desserts are awesome, particularly the panna cotta (if/when it comes back) and the chocolate torte with orange zest.",5.0
"Really cute cafe with friendly staff and a warm atmosphere- mostly attended by local families and residents.The dinner menu is pretty limited in my opinion, and I don't think there is good value for the price.The hummus appetizer comes with the smallest portion of hummus and three pieces of bread (these were decently sized.)The brown rice pasta was a hearty portion but drenched with oil which really took away from the dish (photo attached).Overall it's a cute place, but I wouldn't come back unless in the area--maybe the brunch experience is different.",3.0
"Great casual brunch spot. I especially liked the decor inside, with wooden branches sprawling across the walls. The turkey breast sandwich reminded me of a Vietnamese bahn mi, with its carrots and cucumbers. The goat cheese salad was simply delicious.I personally liked their mimosa better than the mojito, which was a bit too sweet for my liking. But overall, good food that can't go wrong. I took one star off because the server was too quick with us, and walked away while we were still ordering.When we showed up at 2 pm, the place was packed. By the time we left at 3, it had emptied out - so pick a good time to avoid waiting!",4.0
"This quaint, cute cafe should only be known to locals. Thank the gods for Yelp! Swung by for some artisanal coffee and a light brunch. The boo ordered a turkey sammy which has slight nuisances of a banh mi and I ordered the avocado toast and 2 eggs any way. The ambiance and locals makes for a relaxing and delicious time for a low key date or even a nonchalant rendezvous.Staff was slow and easy going but given the location, it's well expected. The fast paced life of NYC takes a time out here at Iris. Enjoy the avocado toast, stay for the memories.",4.0
"My 100th review goes out to this brunch gem. Really cute place for brunch with simple, healthy options. I had friends visiting from out of town who wanted to walk the Brooklyn bridge. We wandered around by Brooklyn bridge park and found this spot. They wanted to go somewhere that wasn't ""standard,"" and this place fit the bill nicely. Everything was reasonably priced between $10-$15. I liked that they had fresh, healthy options instead of fattening brunchy foods. You can even order a huge bowl of fresh berries for $6.I got the chilaquiles, which came in a skillet. They were really delicious and very filling. One of my friends got an English muffin with fresh ricotta and honey, which she liked.",5.0
"Venue - Cute rustic cafeBrunch - Chilaquiles comes in a hot skillet, topped with poached egg and avocado. Has a nice little kick to it. Unfortunately I didn't get to try anything else since the entire table ordered chilaquiles.Service - A bit lacking in that it was slow and confused.",4.0
"Lovely little café in Brooklyn Heights. Small, well chosen menu starting with breakfast at 8am. Very good coffee. Sandwiches are very good value for their quality and quantity. We had a Roast Beef Sandwich, Avocado Toast with poached eggs and Yoghurt with homemade granola and berries. From my perspective the Avocado Toast was a bit over priced, with 11$. The Granola was good, but with 10$ also a bit too pricy from our perspective. Thus, only 4 star rating.",4.0
"Cute place for brunch with lots of instagrammable elements like exposed brick, window-side seating, and water served in vintage-y wine bottles. That being said, for the amount of food you're getting, you end up paying way too much. Food tastes okay, nothing to rave about. Tastes like something your friend's mom would make for you if you slept over their house. Ordered the avocado toast with poached eggs (nice touch of flavor from the dijonnaise under the avocado), smoked salmon with pickled onions (the onions couldn't save this bland and over-salted disappointment) and the french toast (this took forever to come out and was completely burnt on one side). Would I have brunch here again? Probably not. Maybe if someone was treating me.",3.0
"A cute cafe in Brooklyn Heights for brunch. This is a great spot if you want to hang out in DUMBO or near the Brooklyn Bridge. The area is quaint and cute, and this small cafe fits right in.food+ BISCUITS: Essentially a biscuit sandwich with jam in between, these biscuits were perfect, thin, and not too heavy. They were almost like biscuit muffin tops? A little crunch on top but still flaky, warm, and soft.+ YOGURT: This yogurt is deceivingly huge. I guess at $9, the price is justified. There is more than enough granola and almonds to cover all the yogurt on the plate, and generous amounts of blueberries and strawberries.+ CHOCOLATE SCONE: Really great. The filling had melted chocolate, that wasn't too sweet, with a crunchy exterior. - CHALIQUILES: This dish is beautifully presented on an iron skillet, but the flavor was missing. The tortilla chips got soggy from the sauce, but nothing about the flavors redeemed the dish. Also, the poached eggs were more hard boiled than poached. ~ FARRO COBB: A very fresh, light, clean brunch option that was like a cobb salad. serviceThe host was really friendly and attentive while our server was just all over the place. We had snacks at the bar and were told we could have the bill transferred to the table, but she forgot. When we asked about our bill, she had to ask her manager whether it was included or not. She spilled water all over the table and didn't clean it up. She placed a hot coffee in front of my friend that had coffee spilled all over the saucer. It was Sunday morning, so I'm sure she was just tired or hungover, but she did not try to clean up when she had made her mistakes.",3.0
"I'm drooling just thinking about this place.My family and I came here on a frigid Saturday morning. This is a tiny (and very warm!) cafe that is hidden away right near Brooklyn Bridge Park. We were welcomed by a very friendly and attentive waitress who was very receptive to my family's--err---special requests (i.e., ""let's substitute x out of y""). Onto the food. I ordered a cappuccino, and my god, if that wasn't the best cap I'd ever drank. But that paled in comparison to my smoked salmon. Let me put it this way, I had every intention to take a picture and upload it to Yelp. THAT DID NOT HAPPEN. Why? Because I  inhaled that dish. So much smoked salmon, so much cream and pickled onions. The combination was heavenly. I would come back here in a second if I didn't live in California.My family was also quite pleased with their food, though my mother was a bit put out that the edges of her french toast were burned. Just a side note. Nonetheless, that french toast was delicious. I would like to know where they got the bread for the toast and order it in bulk.",5.0
"Good days start with good coffee and breakfast! Thank you Iris Cafe for just that! My boyfriend and I went for Breakfast around 10:30 and that was right before the late morning rush on a Tuesday. The menu is small but everything that we ordered was very tasty. We had the smoked salmon with poached eggs, Chilaquiles and avocado toast. Everything was presented beautifully, our meal came out quick and was cooked very well. My only complaints are that the prices are a bit high and I really wanted more toast! They give you two tiny pieces to put the salmon on which is not enough so we got the avocado toast as well. The restaurant is decorated super cute and the service was great. Definitely stop by if you have some free time in the Brooklyn Heights area!",4.0
"I know Instagram has latergrams but does Yelp have later reviews?? Cause that's what this is. My wife and some friends of ours found this little spot while looking for a place with some gluten free fare that didn't insult our flavor receptors.

The exposed brick and rustic feel is commonplace  any more but their little twist made it feel like you were hanging out in the kitchen of an old world cook with drying spices and the like hanging in the windows.If you are in the area, stop by. You won't regretit. Oh! and I had some tea as well. Can't remember the flavor, but if you like tea you will probably order the same one I did. Or not. Who knows.

To be honnest I don't remember what I had because I went to Iris Cafe like 2 years ago (will need to come back to try it again)However I  remember it was pretty good.

"After a nice stroll with the baby across the Brooklyn Bridge one afternoon, I yelped a close by brunch place with four stars and more, and VOILA - Iris Cafe. We walked about 25 minutes to get there from the bridge. Upon arriving, there were no seats available inside but the waitress was extremely nice and kept us posted while we waited outside. It was a nice day in the 50s, so we didn't mind, plus the neighborhood is eye candy any way. We were seated by the window (arguably the best seat in the house in my opinion). I had to laugh when baby's slouchy beanie blended right in with the sea of slouchy beanies in the cafe. I ordered the avocado toast, hubby got the smoked salmon, and we shared a scone. With all the good reviews, we were underwhelmed with both the toast and the salmon, but the scone was delicious! If you are hungry, the avocado toast ends up only occupying a small portion of your tummy, so highly recommend getting something else to fill up.Bottom-line: Cute cafe, not a lot of seating, okay food, chill atmosphere.",3.0

"We wanted to grab brunch on a Sunday morning and I thought this place was cute given the Yelp reviews. We waited maybe 20 minutes to be seated in a quaint little cafe, which I didn't mind. Maybe we ordered the wrong things, but holy crap are the portions small. For $11 of avocado toast, I kid you not I got one tiny slice of bread with some avocados on it and two tiny poached eggs. We also got the chilaquiles served on the skillet. Tiny. I am okay with small portions, but we ordered extremely hearty items. I'm usually stuffed for brunch, but I walked out of there hungry. I was totally not expecting that from a regular neighborhood cafe. If you have those prices for such small portions, either the food or the presentation better blow my mind. Neither was true for this place. I rather pay a few dollars more to be full. Bread, eggs and avocado are not expensive and requires minimum prep. Service was fine, but not overly friendly to make up for the disappointing portions. Rarely does Yelp fail me, but I probably won't be back to this one. There are a lot of great things that I love about Brooklyn, but I think I'll stick to lower east for brunch. Tons of other people seems to love this place though so I'm sure I won't be missed. Just not for me. All yours Brooklyn hipsters! I did enjoy the 2 tacos I ate somewhere else afterwards because I was so hungry.",2.0
"3.5 Stars is more accurate. More of a snack spot. Iris Cafe is a very small restaurant. So small that they have an open kitchen in the back where a team of chefs work together to put together a dish. My companion here was here for brunch just before walking around the neighborhood. We ordered the Avocado Toast, Smoked Salmon with Poached Eggs, and Biscuit with Jam and Butter. Portions are very small that I would say it's more of a snack spot.Avocado Toast - a toast cut into triangle halves and topped with avocado slices. This was a very simple dish but pretty tasty. I wished there was more!Smoked Salmon with poached eggs - very fresh tasting and from the oil on the fish. Poached eggs were topped with red pepper powder which is not too bad tasting but too raw for my taste.Biscuit with Jam and Butter - biscuit was still warm and really soft. The jam was really sticky and came with big chunks. You definitely need to wash your hands after this! Service was friendly. Our hostess sat me down while my companion was still looking for parking and she did not rush me to order right away. I appreciate this!Overall, it's a pretty interesting cafe with tasty foods.

"Came in as a party of two for brunch and ordered the chilaquiles. The chilaquiles turned out to be tortilla chips and salsa with an egg on top. In New York, you're used to being in small spaces but this place takes it to the extreme. They had about two more tables than they should have. You cannot walk in this place without consciously trying to avoid spilling another patron's water when bumped into by a server, which happened to me once; it also happened to another patron, causing him to fall onto my table and spill a glass of water on me. Server took our order twice, but realized it as we repeated it. Interacted with 3 different people in the course of ordering, asking for refills, and paying.

"Based on my great experience here in August, My boyfriend and I decided to come here for their New Year's Eve dinner. It was a prix-fixe menu, and while I found it in the end to be a little expensive, it was, again, delicious! (Their normal non-New-Years-Eve menu is significantly less expensive).In addition to the great food, the atmosphere here is really among the best of the best restaurants in New York. It's a fairly small restaurant, with only room for maybe 25-30 diners at any given time, and the kitchen is right in the room with you, so the whole thing feels very intimate. The décor is quintessential Brooklyn hipster, with antique cameras and other interesting items decorating the shelves, and the service was again fantastic.The real showstopper on this visit was the chocolate and hazelnut panna cotta  but I'll try to rebuild it for your imagination from the bottom up! The base was about a quarter of an inch thick and made of some sort crunchy chocolate cookie. On top of this was a solid two inches of the chocolate and hazelnut panna cotta, and sprinkled generously with great big sea salt crystals. The balance of flavors in the panna cotta was perfect, and I will be thinking about this dessert for a long time to come.As I mentioned earlier, the restaurant is a little pricey, but you end up getting a wonderful romantic experience out of it. I probably wouldn't just come here for any occasion, but if you want to treat yourself (and your date) to a special dinner, this is definitely a place that should be on your list.",5.0

"Went here today for late brunch with friends for a party of 5. Had to wait 30 minutes, but that is okay given it's a rather small location. I did see a table of 2 occupy a 5 seater table and I didn't really think that made much sense to me...Was seated and our waitress was very nice and took our orders promptly. I ordered the chilaquiles. It looks really good, but truthfully I was a little disappointed. Somehow there was something missing that just did not allow it to hit the spot. I was really full afterwards, but not satisfied. I don't know what I was missing.Also, there was another person floating around, and she did not come around to check on us, so I was pretty much completely out of water the entire meal and the dish made me really thirsty. She was the type where she would only come check on you if you asked her to.Cute location, nice ambiance, but I would be hesitant to return again.",3.0

"Came in as a party of two for brunch and ordered the chilaquiles. The chilaquiles turned out to be tortilla chips and salsa with an egg on top. In New York, you're used to being in small spaces but this place takes it to the extreme. They had about two more tables than they should have. You cannot walk in this place without consciously trying to avoid spilling another patron's water when bumped into by a server, which happened to me once; it also happened to another patron, causing him to fall onto my table and spill a glass of water on me. Server took our order twice, but realized it as we repeated it. Interacted with 3 different people in the course of ordering, asking for refills, and paying. We were not sure who we were tipping.",2.0
Went for brunch on a Sunday.   The food was ok and didn't take long.   The portions seemed a bit small and did not include any sides.   The coffee was undrinkable.   The real kicker was the service.  The waitstaff was completely disinterested.  It took 10 minutes after my coffees was served to get milk and sugar.,3.0
"Go prepared to spend $. We dropped in for a coffee and wanted a simple breakfast, so opted for the homemade biscuit. When perusing the limited menu, we should have focused more intently on biscuit, singular. One biscuit. $7.  Insane.

Again, the egg was perfectly poached & so tasty & mixing it w/ the avocado & toast was heavenly. What a great simple dish. The bf ordered the French toast. It was on the sweeter side because they serve it with a delicious cinnamon spread on the toast & a big dollop of whipped cream cheese on the side. When you combine the toast w/ the sweet cinnamon spread & cream cream it is a perfect combo of sweet & tangy. The toast is thick & not soggy so it has a nice little crunch as you cut it w/ your knife. They give you real maple syrup too but you won't need it. Both times I've ordered their ice coffee & it was good. Would love to return & try other hot coffee options when the weather has cooled down. What a great place. Wish I lived closer.",5.0
"Unfortunately, Iris Cafe is no longer what it once was.

"After reading reviews about this cafe, I made my way down to this small hipster cafe in Brooklyn Heights. The praise I read referred  to their dinner menu. Their brunch experience was mediocre.I had a large coffee, avocado toast, and shakshouka. Sometimes you just have to drop $7 for the avocado toast and end up regretting the decision when you realize the same dish could have made at home for much cheaper. Then, you attempt to defend your  decision by reasoning that the high price is a result of Iris being a restaurant, therefore it has to pay for the ingredient, the labor, and the space that goes into making this trendy breakfast treat. Thereby, rationalizing the decision of overspending on toast. The other item, the shakshouka, needed an extra egg. Without the second egg the sauce was left tasting a bit sour and leaving me unimpressed and quietly debating whether I had ordered the wrong item off the menu. Maybe the shakshouka was not their specialty. However, one of the guests seated at the table next to me proceeded to rattle off the same order and I got the feeling that Iris was just another hyped up restaurant with average food and trendy decor. The decor is quintessential ""Brooklyn Hipster"". with the exposed brick and hipster decorations all around the restaurant. You will know it when you see it. Definitely walked in with the presumption that this is yet another hipster cafe that is all style and little substance. I left feeling underwhelmed.",3.0
"It is is a popular and trendy little place that generally meets expectations.

Truly, they are the real stars of this place; eager to create a good dining experience.The sandwiches are tasty and well prepared, and the salads are rather generous.  The brunch items are unfortunately a different story.  The smoked salmon platter was very much a let down.  There is a great deal of fish on the plate, accompanied by a quattro of poker chip sized scallion pancakes - 2 under the fish and two liberally dolloped with creme fraiche. As well on the plate are 2 poached eggs, a clump of pickled onions, and a smattering of fresh horseradish.  The scallion pancakes are too small to be anything but a garnish.  The eggs were tragically overcooked and entirely cold.  the horse radish was excessively biting, and rather that waking up the dish, quickly overpowered it.  The dish is very unablanced, being primary a party platter of fish with an excessive array of condiments and garnishes.  Half the components on the plate are unnecessary, serving only to muddle the flavours and confuse the palate.  It is a dish that requires editing - a little voice in the chef's head saying ""that's enough! Stop it! Now take 2 things off that plate!"" It should be noted that the chef displays a wonderful palate. The flavour combinations work, and work well.

"I was in the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood visiting my friend, and she selected this spot for a late 2pm Saturday brunch. There was a small wait of 5 minutes for a table, but the hostess sat us at the bar at the end of the establishment for the mean time. Imagine a log cabin with natural sunlight shining through the two front windows whose dusty glass panes allowed enough light to pass through to brighten up the room without glaringly blinding us. The seating arrangements vary and accommodate 2-6 people per table, but space is limited! Probably seats only 25 people. I'm a sucker for wooden picnic benches, so if you get a table close to the wall you'll have room to park your coat and bag. Crowd appears to be from around the neighborhood, so expect yuppie Brooklynites talking over coffee. No one was particularly loud, so you can zone out the conversations easily.I ordered the smoked salmon with crème fraiche served upon scallion pancakes. I didn't pay particular attention to the salmon, but at least it wasn't lukewarm. The scallion pancakes were slightly crispy on the outside with a ""hash brown""-like interior. Honestly, the selling point was the crème fraiche. I loved how it was not tangy like sour cream! It felt milky cool, creamy, and refreshing as it cleared my palette in between the bites of scallion pancakes and pickled veggies. Put a dollop of it on the salmon too!If you're in the area and need a nice place to sit down and have a casual conversation over a laid back brunch, I would recommend this place!",4.0
"This was quite the pleasant little surprise on Saturday morning! Tasked with a need for a hearty, healthy breakfast being that I had an afternoon tattoo session ahead of me (would have been a baaaad idea to go on a typical ""breakfast"" of just vegetable juice and maybe some kale chips), the friend I was staying with suggested Iris. It seemed to be the only option close to her Brooklyn Heights apartment. I was dreading a wait for a table. Actually, it was 10 am. I was shocked to learn that anyone eats ""brunch"" at that early hour, being that my brunch is more like at 2pm, but my friend assured me that this is, in fact, a normal brunching hour.I'm still gonna call it breakfast, though.We luckily made it in time to grab the last table in this cozy, rustic cafe with exposed brick and a vintage feel. I immediately ordered up a latte with almond milk and wow, this is easily one of the best I've had... possibly ever (outside of Seattle). I don't say this lightly! I'm an espresso fiend and typically only drink it black. I did have to fight every urge to order up a kir royale. Just saying. I did tie one on the night before and didn't relish the idea of endless bleeding during my session which had me getting my entire side inked up (hellllo ribs)Then on to the avocado sandwich. Wow! It also featured cheddar, lettuce, and a bit of scallion mayo on toasted whole wheat. And...oh. PICKLES seriously made the sandwich all it could be. This was just what the doctor ordered.With this quick offering of superb caffeine and sustenance, I made my merry way to Greenpoint and hours of agony. But hey, at least I didn't pass out.

"We had googled interesting places to have brunch in Brooklyn Heights and this place always came up in our searches so I'd always wanted to try it.  A couple of Sundays ago we finally got a chance to check them out.  We came immediately after the early service at our church.  The place was packed but they told us we could wait at the bar.  The counter was a comfortable size and after a few minutes, we decided to just go ahead and order and eat at the bar.  The bartender / coffee barista was so friendly and welcoming, he gave us some great menu suggestions.  The latte was delicious and so was the ricotta toast - by the way, one of the best in our neighborhood.  We had the poached eggs with avocado and the french toast.  Both were really delicious!  The only ""complaint"" is that the place is always packed!  We have come a few other Sundays, but each time it's just too busy.  Hopefully, we'll someday get another chance.",4.0
"I've been going to Iris on a semi-regular basis since they opened. At first I loved Iris, it had a very relaxed seating arrangement, great coffee from Stumptown and delicious salads. Iris was the first place I ever had avocado toast and in it's first incarnations at Iris it was delicious: crispy bread, tasty avocado spread and the most perfectly cooked eggs I'd ever had. Whenever I was home I went to Iris, and whenever I went I dragged a friend or loved one along with me. Slowly Iris began to shift, the seating became more formalized and like a regular restaurant, gone were the days of lazing around with work and a big, fresh salad. This made sense though, they're small and need to make money, it was a change that felt right and with it came some more delicious additions to the menu like a blue fish salad, the best meatloaf sandwich I'd ever had and many more breakfast options. When my boyfriends family came to town, we knew we had to bring them to Iris. Sharing a meal with them at Iris is a memory I cherish. Then Iris went through some phases. There was the biscuit phase: 5 menu options featuring biscuits. The cast iron skillet phase: delicious, but a rib-sticking, Brooklyn Winter sort of brunch. Then I moved away to the West Coast. I came back to find that Iris had been reborn again. Gone was the amazing and super friendly waitress my boyfriend and I always loved to see when we visited. Gone was the strange and super beautiful painting of a spread of food in a field under a full moon. Gone was the same Neil Young mix they used to always play.A lot of the old standbys were still there, avocado toast, soft eggs and skillet dishes, but they seem to have lost their pizzaz: the last egg I ate in December was hard in the middle, the avocado toast was limp, the coffee super bitter, the skillet breakfast dish heavy with cheese. Maybe we hit them on a bad day, or during a bad transition? I hope that Iris will be reborn again, as it so often is, into a new and exciting form.",3.0

I did tie one on the night before and didn't relish the idea of endless bleeding during my session which had me getting my entire side inked up (hellllo ribs)Then on to the avocado sandwich. Wow! It also featured cheddar, lettuce, and a bit of scallion mayo on toasted whole wheat. And...oh. PICKLES seriously made the sandwich all it could be. This was just what the doctor ordered.With this quick offering of superb caffeine and sustenance, I made my merry way to Greenpoint and hours of agony. But hey, at least I didn't pass out. Thanks, Iris Cafe!",4.0
Lunch -- More of a snack than a full meal. Would have liked a side salad with the sandwich. Same went for the Cobb salad. The food was quite good. Just felt like it lacked that little bit to make it a full meal.Wonderful atmosphere. Friendly wait staff.,4.0

I enjoyed a delightful romantic dinner at the Iris Cafe this past weekend.  The service was good.  I enjoyed my beef entree which was very well prepared and my date enjoyed her meal as well.  The prices were reasonable.  The cocktails were good.  I would definitely return.,4.0
"We had googled interesting places to have brunch in Brooklyn Heights and this place always came up in our searches so I'd always wanted to try it.  A couple of Sundays ago we finally got a chance to check them out.  We came immediately after the early service at our church.  The place was packed but they told us we could wait at the bar.  The counter was a comfortable size and after a few minutes, we decided to just go ahead and order and eat at the bar.  The bartender / coffee barista was so friendly and welcoming, he gave us some great menu suggestions.  The latte was delicious and so was the ricotta toast - by the way, one of the best in our neighborhood.  We had the poached eggs with avocado and the french toast.  Both were really delicious!  The only ""complaint"" is that the place is always packed!  We have come a few other Sundays, but each time it's just too busy.  Hopefully, we'll someday get another chance.",4.0
"I've been going to Iris on a semi-regular basis since they opened. At first I loved Iris, it had a very relaxed seating arrangement, great coffee from Stumptown and delicious salads. Iris was the first place I ever had avocado toast and in it's first incarnations at Iris it was delicious: crispy bread, tasty avocado spread and the most perfectly cooked eggs I'd ever had. Whenever I was home I went to Iris, and whenever I went I dragged a friend or loved one along with me. Slowly Iris began to shift, the seating became more formalized and like a regular restaurant, gone were the days of lazing around with work and a big, fresh salad. This made sense though, they're small and need to make money, it was a change that felt right and with it came some more delicious additions to the menu like a blue fish salad, the best meatloaf sandwich I'd ever had and many more breakfast options. When my boyfriends family came to town, we knew we had to bring them to Iris. Sharing a meal with them at Iris is a memory I cherish. Then Iris went through some phases. There was the biscuit phase: 5 menu options featuring biscuits. The cast iron skillet phase: delicious, but a rib-sticking, Brooklyn Winter sort of brunch. Then I moved away to the West Coast. I came back to find that Iris had been reborn again. Gone was the amazing and super friendly waitress my boyfriend and I always loved to see when we visited. Gone was the strange and super beautiful painting of a spread of food in a field under a full moon. Gone was the same Neil Young mix they used to always play.A lot of the old standbys were still there, avocado toast, soft eggs and skillet dishes, but they seem to have lost their pizzaz: the last egg I ate in December was hard in the middle, the avocado toast was limp, the coffee super bitter, the skillet breakfast dish heavy with cheese. Maybe we hit them on a bad day, or during a bad transition? I hope that Iris will be reborn again, as it so often is, into a new and exciting form.",3.0
"Your senses will be intrigued by this:The creative combination of ingredients on the menu. House made tagliatelle + maitake mushrooms + pine nuts + sage + meyer lemon. Plate will be lick-able.Your 3rd date will be impressed by this:The ambiance with the open kitchen, exposed brick and modest wooden chairs. Weeknight dinner observation: 8 tables, 8 couples. Quiet enough to have an intimate conversation, but loud enough where the background noise blurs the conversations around you.Your regrets will be this:Not discovering this sooner, especially if you live within a 20 minute walking radius from the restaurant.

Came here for brunch on Sunday with the lady. Getting in:- walked in and they had seats at the bar. There was a short wait for a table.

Will def get again- bacon was great Service:- service was great.

"Came here with a friend for brunch. She ordered the Huevos Rancheros and I ordered the Avocado Toast with Soft Egg and Ham and Cheese Biscuit.The Establishment- Very cozy, cute cafe- Pretty busy around brunchtime- The waitresses are dressed like normal people - no easy to tell way of knowing who works there and who doesn't. There's also no pedestal or anything when you enter. So we were awkwardly standing near the entrance for a while before a waitress came. It's small, I get it -- but we felt like fish out of a fishbowl for a good two minutes (slight exaggeration). - You also have to be willing to share tables. They have bench-like setups and there isn't a lot of privacy. Most people are sharing tables.The Food- Everything is in small servings. Do not come here expecting a sizable brunch. In fact, the largest dish is probably my friend's Huevos Rancheros. And even that is small by Essex standards.- My friend said the Huevos Rancheros were delicious but nothing to write home about. There was many different flavors that complemented very well.- The Avocado Toast was absolutely delicious. Creamy and perfect. I would've given Iris four stars based on this alone... until I discovered Iris Take Away has the same thing for cheaper.- Not a fan of the soft-boiled egg. Really had nothing to contribute to the toast at all. Sure it made the toast a little yolky, but it just covered up the deliciousness of the avocado.- I got the Ham and Cheese biscuit because I knew I'd still be hungry. It was surprisingly not a normal biscuit with ham and cheese. The two were baked into the biscuit. I could barely taste the cheese, and there wasn't much ham. It was awful... and they call it their 'specialty biscuit'.The Service- It took them quite a while to get our orders out. So go with good company. They will have to entertain you.- Service in general is pretty appalling. We had to wait to get a water refill (which you will need quite often because the bottle of water is pretty small for a party of 2)- When we got the check, they messed up my order. Probably because the person who got our check was different from our original waitress -- please fix this.- At least they fixed my check by giving me cash to account for the mistake.Very overhyped by the Yelp community.

"went here in search of a nice breakfast/brunch place. the place is tiny and was pretty much packed. there were spots at the bar so we decided to stay and eat at the bar because judging by yelp reviews this place was very worth it. first minus - they don't have special brunch/breakfast deals. everything comes separately. it's fine since the prices aren't that high. but I love to have a side of fries or salad or fruits with my morning sandwich.they had potato chips as a side. after ordering it - realized these were just regular chips in a bag vs fries that I initially thought they are. oh well. returned that. got a comment back from the waiter/maybe also a manager that chips are chips in america and not fries. ok.pepperment ice tea was very nice though. and after everyone around us was served including a couple who came after us, we were offered extra drinks on the house. nice touch.avocado sandwich was very good. blt was ok.staff somehow doesn't feel happy and looks like they're all operating on their own w/o communication between each other...",3.0

"i've been to iris cafe a couple of times now with my boyfriend's family and we all leave content. the staff suggests you order appetizers to share, which can be pretty expensive when you're with a large group of people (and that's without the cost of the main course and/or dessert). usually we order all of the appetizers to share, but my personal favorites are the carrots with pistachio vinaigrette (absolute favorite!), asparagus with cheese and egg, kale croquettes, and brussels sprouts when they have them. my boyfriend likes their mushrooms with ricotta and honey, which is also pretty good. overall, their appetizers reflect a wonderful and curious palette - even if something seems like it won't taste good, the flavors almost always mesh well together and leave you wanting more. appetizers aside, the main courses are rather small and pricey for the amount you get. their tagliatelle, lamb belly, and short rib are all delicious, but, mind you, portions run on the small side. dessert is negligible.",4.0
"I took my brother here for his birthday dinner and as a thank you for (once again) helping me move apartments. The ambiance was absolutely lovely - small place, very quiet, but not pretentious in the least! We split all of our plates, as per the suggestion of the very nice waitress. For me, the winner was the homemade tagliatelle with chantrelles and tomatoes.  My brother's favorite was the buratta on scallion pancakes (which I also adored). We also got the shishito peppers which were super yummy, the octopus in tomato confit (the octopus was cooked to perfection, but the other elements were just OK), and the hen of the woods mushroom with homemade ricotta (probably our least favorite dish, but still very tasty). We also split a bottle of cava, which really hit the spot and worked wonderfully with all the dishes. Dinner was a little less than 2 hours, and the service got a little slow towards the end as they got busier, but overall a very nice spot. I will definitely go back!",4.0

Tacky!For a $4 tea I at least expect a hot water refill or a check in once in a while to see what's happening at the table. Especially after asking our group to wait outside in the cold while a table became available. Absolutely meh. Luckily I always eat with amazing people who made brunch worth the frigid temps, haphazard, clumsy & awkward service. I just think the staff is young & still figuring things out (personality & food service wise) but for the sweet space, decent food- a little mentoring of their young & a few experienced people working tables can go a long way to making Iris a better meal all around.",2.0

"went here in search of a nice breakfast/brunch place. the place is tiny and was pretty much packed. there were spots at the bar so we decided to stay and eat at the bar because judging by yelp reviews this place was very worth it. first minus - they don't have special brunch/breakfast deals. everything comes separately. it's fine since the prices aren't that high. but I love to have a side of fries or salad or fruits with my morning sandwich.they had potato chips as a side. after ordering it - realized these were just regular chips in a bag vs fries that I initially thought they are. oh well. returned that. got a comment back from the waiter/maybe also a manager that chips are chips in america and not fries. ok.pepperment ice tea was very nice though. and after everyone around us was served including a couple who came after us, we were offered extra drinks on the house. nice touch.avocado sandwich was very good. blt was ok.staff somehow doesn't feel happy and looks like they're all operating on their own w/o communication between each other...",3.0
"Romantic and hip atmosphere in a beautiful cobblestones Brooklyn neighborhood. We were with a large group and were able to sample almost everything on the menu. We were all blown away by the presentation and flavor of the dishes. Very gluten-free and dairy-free friendly, we left very full and indulged but feeling healthy happy and light. The desserts were out of this world, without being too sweet. I highly recommend!",5.0
The food is OK. Pricy for the quality though. Nothing to brag about. Service sucked! The place wasn't even busy. The waitress had attitude.,1.0
"i've been to iris cafe a couple of times now with my boyfriend's family and we all leave content. the staff suggests you order appetizers to share, which can be pretty expensive when you're with a large group of people (and that's without the cost of the main course and/or dessert). usually we order all of the appetizers to share, but my personal favorites are the carrots with pistachio vinaigrette (absolute favorite!), asparagus with cheese and egg, kale croquettes, and brussels sprouts when they have them. my boyfriend likes their mushrooms with ricotta and honey, which is also pretty good. overall, their appetizers reflect a wonderful and curious palette - even if something seems like it won't taste good, the flavors almost always mesh well together and leave you wanting more. appetizers aside, the main courses are rather small and pricey for the amount you get. their tagliatelle, lamb belly, and short rib are all delicious, but, mind you, portions run on the small side. dessert is negligible.",4.0
"I took my brother here for his birthday dinner and as a thank you for (once again) helping me move apartments. The ambiance was absolutely lovely - small place, very quiet, but not pretentious in the least! We split all of our plates, as per the suggestion of the very nice waitress. For me, the winner was the homemade tagliatelle with chantrelles and tomatoes.  My brother's favorite was the buratta on scallion pancakes (which I also adored). We also got the shishito peppers which were super yummy, the octopus in tomato confit (the octopus was cooked to perfection, but the other elements were just OK), and the hen of the woods mushroom with homemade ricotta (probably our least favorite dish, but still very tasty). We also split a bottle of cava, which really hit the spot and worked wonderfully with all the dishes. Dinner was a little less than 2 hours, and the service got a little slow towards the end as they got busier, but overall a very nice spot. I will definitely go back!",4.0
"I used to live around the corner from this place, and it was the highlight of my day when I got to come here. I've enjoyed the coffee, cappuccinos and cookies here.

"Decent food- strange beyond strange service. The waitstaff tried hard to be cool & pounded me when I signed the cc receipt. It's like they didn't know what to do with this queer fag femme. Tacky!For a $4 tea I at least expect a hot water refill or a check in once in a while to see what's happening at the table. Especially after asking our group to wait outside in the cold while a table became available. Absolutely meh. Luckily I always eat with amazing people who made brunch worth the frigid temps, haphazard, clumsy & awkward service. I just think the staff is young & still figuring things out (personality & food service wise) but for the sweet space, decent food- a little mentoring of their young & a few experienced people working tables can go a long way to making Iris a better meal all around.",2.0
"So I'm a fan of the food, on two visits it is fresh and tasty.  Leans on spring vegetables and the room is very inviting and conformable.  Really nice setting on a quiet block.  We had a homemade pasta and the asparagus dish.  Really good stuff and well done.  So why not five stars?  Most of the menu is very expensive for what you are getting.  Usually I'm not one to complain about price as long as I'm getting quality, but some of the prices are really out of wack and would make me think twice about return visits.  Would love to see a realistic adjustment so I can make this part of the regular rotation.",4.0

"Iris cafe is one of my favorite spots for brunch or dinner. The people are incredibly nice and attentive and the food is awesome (and reasonably priced).

"I like this place. The service is pretty much on point, the flavors and arrangement of flavors definitely has had a lot of thought put into it. My only qualm is the pricing.

"+ Charming breakfast/brunch eatery + Coffee from Intelligentsia :) :) :)+ White fish toast & soft eggs - so satisfying TIP: The cafe is cash only, but they can run your credit card at the store next door if you want to wait a few extra minutes.Came on a Tuesday morning around 8:30am for some post-yoga grub (I know...I was one of THOSE people in Brooklyn Heights...lol) and this place exceeded my expectations. They're serving INTELLIGENTSIA now and are no longer serving Stumptown coffee. Which is just as well. A nice reminder of my old stomping grounds in Venice, CA. Amazing, smooth, full-bodied coffee. Loved it.Had the WHITEFISH TOAST w/ 2 SOFT EGGS ($9). The whitefish spread was amazing. Umami galore. Coupled with oozy egg yolk? Phenomenal. An incredibly satisfying breakfast. Comes with 2 pieces of toast and 2 eggs - makes for easy sharing. We also got the LOX & EGG SANDWICH ($9). Comes on a buttered french roll w/ medium egg, cucumbers, pickled red onion, capers, and a bit of spinach. Also full of amazing flavors. I found the bread to be a bit too crusty though and the sandwich fell apart due to having so many ingredients in the stiff roll. If you come here with a friend I highly recommend getting the above 2 items and trade halves. The whitefish spread was so good that I asked if they had any packaged in the store next door to buy and take home. Our server said no, they didn't, but she'd be happy to prepare a take-home container for me. Awesome. The ""ladies (milfs?) who brunch"" come sauntering in around 9am. You'll also find random characters getting work done on laptops and people like us...the post-morning-yoga breakfast folk around this time of day.",4.0
"Fantastic. Avocado Toast with Poached Eggs was as good as it sounds. Definitely gets crowded,so go at an off-time or weird day if you don't want to wait.

"Mmmm delicious. It's pretty out of the way, but if you're planning to visit dumbo or something, Iris Cafe is a great place to stop by before the park for a light breakfast.+1 Food: mm we ordered the avocado toast with one soft egg, the smoked salmon with two soft eggs, and a ham and cheddar biscuit. The avocado toast was phenomenal. Tasted so fresh and delicious with the egg. I would recommend getting the egg with this dish because it really makes a difference. The smoked salmon was also pretty good and the egg enhanced the taste once again. It was a bit salty, so the egg helps. Both dishes were really light; I'm not sure it will be enough if you were starving. The ham and cheddar biscuit wasn't as good as I expected it to be. It was very dry and crumbled when I cut it. Couldn't really taste the ham and cheddar either. +1 Atmosphere and decor: beautiful little place. They used natural lighting from outside and it felt so refreshing. They have a bunch of little tables and a bar area with an open kitchen. When I went, it was around 3, so it wasn't crazy crowded, but everything except one table was filled. So expect a wait if you come during peak hours. Iris Cafe was also clean and had beautiful paintings and decorations.+0.5 Service: the waiters and waitresses were extremely polite, but it couldn't save the wait time for our food. I didn't have to wait for a table to sit down, but our order took about half hour to 40 minutes to arrive. I mean we didn't order anything crazy and there didn't seem to be THAT many people, so I was just confused. Since it was an open kitchen, I did see that there were a bunch of people working for such a small place. I don't know what took so long, but good thing I wasn't hungry or I'd be angry. +0.5 Price: the food was really simple and easy to make for how much they are charging. I think instead of coming here in the future, I will end up just making this myself. I just think $2 per soft egg and $4 for a biscuit is a little high. It was delicious though. +1 Overall: good experience. My fellow yelpers were right about the avocado toast and I would recommend this to others as well. Cute little place for a catch up brunch, but make sure you don't come too hungry or if you're in a hurry.",4.0

The cafe is old brick, exposed pipes, tin ceiling, milk paint charming. I brought my son and his roommates from NYU Poly and even they thought the place was cool. They really liked the light fixtures in the front bays; check 'em out. If I had one quibble it would be that all the exposed hard surfaces make it pretty loud inside. The place was packed, however, so one should expect loud.Service was good. We got a table almost immediately at 2:00 on a Sunday afternoon. Even though it was packed, the waitresses were on their game and helpful with making suggestions. The wait for food, even in a packed restaurant was perfectly acceptable. Food was excellent. I had the gumbo special which had a nice little kick to it; nothing overpowering, just a ""hey, I'm kinda spicy"" vibe to it. The roommates had Huevos Rancheros at the waitress' suggestion. They both loved it. The poached eggs and the chili were a good combo. There was so much salmon in my wife's Salmon Salad, she commented it was almost too much, as if there is such a thing. The boy's Chopped Cobb was a little weird, however. He enjoyed it very much and said it was great, but Cobb it wasn't. To me, you order Cobb Salad specifically for the presentation; the nice striped array of goodies makes Cobb Cobb. The Iris Cafe interpretation came to the table pre-tossed without the presentation.

Iris Cafe has gone through quite a change in the past year or so. There is now a sit down cafe with a to-go spot next door.

"Not only is Iris Cafe charming, but the walk there makes you feel like you don't live in the most trashed city in the United States (which may be Detroit or Baltimore or something like that--but you know).Everything on the menu is delectable and full of flavor, yet never over powering. It's ideal for late lunch and dinner. And unlike most places in Brooklyn that serves adult beverages during the day, there's never a pretentious long line or wait. The service is just as easy to digest as their decor and food. I hope that doesn't come off weird...After you eat, go for a stroll under the Brooklyn Bridge, or better yet, grab something from their To Go store just two doors down and have a picnic!",4.0
"Down in Cobble Hill/Brooklyn Heights you'll find this beautiful café in a gorgeous neighborhood.  Make sure to get there before 11am if you don't want to wait around for a table and also be willing to share tables.  -Latte: mmm perfect.  The coffee is strong and it's creamy!-Smoked Salmon and Eggs (asparagus, capers, dill, pickled shallot, two soft eggs): the salmon is very fresh and mixed with the capers, asparagus and soft boiled egg over the sourdough toast, it really tastes good.  -Huevos Rancheros (tortilla, spicy black bean chili, queso fresco, salsa, two soft eggs): it's good.  I like the mix of everything: the salsa, beans, soft boiled egg, and especially the avocado which makes the dish creamier.  The tortilla cuts quite easily and doesn't have that overwhelming taste that some of them do.  FINAL VERDICT: the food is of very good quality, the service is pretty good and it's just an overall nice atmosphere--no rush whatsoever.  I would recommend this place to people in the neighborhood for sure. But the smoked salmon wins over the Huevos!",4.0

"Great vibes, great service, and good brunch at this Brooklyn Heights cafe! The Huevos Rancheros was great. Loved the poached eggs and chili. Large cups for the coffee with free refills. The service is great. Very attentive woman as I have a ton of food allergies and I was able to get the Huevos Rancheros my way. 11AM is the time to go on Sat mornings. I went here with my girlfriends. We had no wait. Loved the brunch and the vibes! We will return!",4.0
Iris Cafe has gone through quite a change in the past year or so. There is now a sit down cafe with a to-go spot next door. The sandwiches (breakfast and lunch) are always delicious.. they no longer serve it to you in the parchment paper but in wire baskets. My favorite is still the avocado sandwich. No more bussing your own tables now. Just sit down and enjoy the casual atmosphere. Still cash only I believe.,4.0

Coffee is excellent for US standards - comes close to tasting like a real Melbourne-style coffee (very hard to find!!). Service was nothing to rave about, but nothing to fault either.

"As a resident of State St, I thought I knew the ins and outs of this little 'hood, but I was pleasantly surprised to walk down Columbia Place and visit Iris Cafe.  I admired the wood and brick interior, with appealingly rough-hewn wood tables.  It has a slight hipster vibe but nothing too offensive, and its menu is small but every option vies for your attention.  On my companion's recommendation, I ordered the avocado toast with two soft eggs.  It was a symphony of textures and packed the protein punch I needed post-Pilates--check that alliteration!  The multigrain toast was nutty and flavorful, and it was the perfect vehicle for its topping of creamy mashed avocado.  This experience was only improved by two perfectly soft-boiled eggs, whose yolks oozed and got into the nooks of the bread.  I look forward to going back and trying one of their other sandwiches, and maybe washing it down with some herbal tea, mmmm.",4.0

"SInce I'll be going to school at Brooklyn Law this coming fall, I decided to snoop around the area for a good cafe so I wouldn't have to resort to studying in the Starbucks down the block.Found this highly-rated little gem on Yelp, and had to try it out. Only about an 8-10 minute walk from the Brooklyn law building, and on a really nice and quiet street.I ordered a large coffee and gingerbread muffin, which came out to be $5.20. Coffee was good, and gingerbread muffin looked like poop and was very moist, but not bad. It was kinda small for the ~$2 though.And since I went around 5pm, the environment was really calm-- great for reading, as the music was kept pretty low and the other customers were into their own books/laptops. A variety of seating arrangements too, from a couch to small tables to tiny cushions on the bay windows at the front of the cafe. I had no trouble at all finding a seat (there were maybe only 3-4 other customers in the store at the time), but from the sound of the other reviews, it can get pretty crowded earlier in the day.Oh, and they sent me off with a baguette when I left (as they were getting ready to close).

"I have never been so divided over a place. food is delicious, coffee is great, cutest interior ever. but as a rule, i don't go there anymore.i used to meet a good friend there for brunch a couple times a month - we'd order our stuff, grab a table and sit back and get our americanos and avocado toast in no time. (food is so simple and good and fresh. sob. this is basically turning into a nostalgic eulogy.) then came the day when they implemented table service and you have to be seated, which would be sweet if staff were at all organized or quick or responsiveness.*** but instead you're waiting for 15 minutes for someone to just acknowledge you've been seated and that you desperately need a coffee, and another 10 minutes to get your goddamn americano. and you're not just sitting and relaxing, because the number of goddamn parents with goddamn toddlers and infants in that place has increased tenfold since i started going there. so. many. babies. they're yelling, shrieking, crying, etc...they're named things like Carmela and Topher and Aiden, and their parents are coddling them and just blech. The thing is, I ceded the spot to the parents who are frankly thrilled to have  an awesome cheapo breakfast spot that is no muss, no fuss and where there annoying kids aren't (widely) considered to be a nuisance. It's all theirs - they deserve it. I have plenty of other spots I can go to.

"Café Iris is an espresso oasis tucked in away from the chaos of Montague Street in Brooklyn Heights. I visited for a latte - they use beans from the Stumptown Roastery. The barista prepared an excellent latte, the milk sweet, not burned and the espresso stood up quite well. The staff was professional and polite, particularly the tall blond at the counter. I would encourage anyone interested in visiting this café to bring something to read, perhaps a sketchbook and certainly an open mind re. the no laptop/ipad policy. There are certainly plenty of alternative cafés should this not work for you. Now, should there be a yoga mommy breast feeding and a baby brigade wailing, well that's Brooklyn Heights et al. during the day. Pro's. Proper espresso. A tasty, comforting menu.

"This place USED to be so great.  My go-to restaurant for lunch with my husband (we both work from home) or out of town guests.  They've made a lot of changes in the past 2+ years - hours, decor, full table service.  Well fine.  But why have they messed with what WAS a really really good menu?  They no longer offer the best meat loaf sandwich ever, or the roast beef dip.  I was in there recently with out of town visitors and there was nothing on the menu I wanted to eat.  They now seem to serve almost exclusively ""grim spa-food"".  My tartine was soggy bread with too-large chunks of barely- seasoned sweet potato on top.  I didn't finish it.  My brother-in-law did finish his kale salad but was still hungry at the end and also finished his wife's sandwich.  Spa-food.  Not great tasting and not enough of it.   Was it any accident there was hardly a guy in the place?",2.0
"Omg, the soft-boiled eggs???? What?!?!The only thing is, they seem to have different special dishes with the soft-boiled eggs everyday. The first time I went, I got the eggs with ham, homemade tortillas and salsa. I fell in love, so I went back again, but they said they only have that on some weekends. So I was saddd.But everything there is REALLY good. They've got such unique tastes, nothing like what I've tasted before. They sometimes have these amazing fruit salads, too, and I really have no idea what makes them so good, but they certainly know how to play with different flavors of their fresh ingredients.Oh and also, awesome coffee!Mmm I just love this place. Makes you feel good. It's the best way to spend your weekend mornings, I promise!",5.0
"SInce I'll be going to school at Brooklyn Law this coming fall, I decided to snoop around the area for a good cafe so I wouldn't have to resort to studying in the Starbucks down the block.Found this highly-rated little gem on Yelp, and had to try it out. Only about an 8-10 minute walk from the Brooklyn law building, and on a really nice and quiet street.I ordered a large coffee and gingerbread muffin, which came out to be $5.20. Coffee was good, and gingerbread muffin looked like poop and was very moist, but not bad. It was kinda small for the ~$2 though.And since I went around 5pm, the environment was really calm-- great for reading, as the music was kept pretty low and the other customers were into their own books/laptops. A variety of seating arrangements too, from a couch to small tables to tiny cushions on the bay windows at the front of the cafe. I had no trouble at all finding a seat (there were maybe only 3-4 other customers in the store at the time), but from the sound of the other reviews, it can get pretty crowded earlier in the day.Oh, and they sent me off with a baguette when I left (as they were getting ready to close). They must've somehow known that I looooove baguettes, so for that reason alone, I will definitely be back. :PP.S. **CASH ONLY** And you're expected to bus your own tables, so don't be a slob!",4.0
"I have never been so divided over a place. food is delicious, coffee is great, cutest interior ever. but as a rule, i don't go there anymore.i used to meet a good friend there for brunch a couple times a month - we'd order our stuff, grab a table and sit back and get our americanos and avocado toast in no time. (food is so simple and good and fresh. sob. this is basically turning into a nostalgic eulogy.) then came the day when they implemented table service and you have to be seated, which would be sweet if staff were at all organized or quick or responsiveness.*** but instead you're waiting for 15 minutes for someone to just acknowledge you've been seated and that you desperately need a coffee, and another 10 minutes to get your goddamn americano. and you're not just sitting and relaxing, because the number of goddamn parents with goddamn toddlers and infants in that place has increased tenfold since i started going there. so. many. babies. they're yelling, shrieking, crying, etc...they're named things like Carmela and Topher and Aiden, and their parents are coddling them and just blech. The thing is, I ceded the spot to the parents who are frankly thrilled to have  an awesome cheapo breakfast spot that is no muss, no fuss and where there annoying kids aren't (widely) considered to be a nuisance. It's all theirs - they deserve it. I have plenty of other spots I can go to. But I will always love Iris Cafe, and will always hold a place for it in my heart.***sidenote: the menu expanded into further awesomeness around this same time, so not all changes were bad. also, there's alcohol now!",3.0
"Café Iris is an espresso oasis tucked in away from the chaos of Montague Street in Brooklyn Heights. I visited for a latte - they use beans from the Stumptown Roastery. The barista prepared an excellent latte, the milk sweet, not burned and the espresso stood up quite well. The staff was professional and polite, particularly the tall blond at the counter. I would encourage anyone interested in visiting this café to bring something to read, perhaps a sketchbook and certainly an open mind re. the no laptop/ipad policy. There are certainly plenty of alternative cafés should this not work for you. Now, should there be a yoga mommy breast feeding and a baby brigade wailing, well that's Brooklyn Heights et al. during the day. Pro's. Proper espresso. A tasty, comforting menu. Cozy, light-filled environment with sufficient seating. Con's. Strollers. Wailing babies. Public breast feeding.",4.0

"Great place for peaceful brekky in a beautiful neighbourhood. We walked across the Brooklyn bridge to here the other day, and it is a pleasant walk.

"Consistently good espresso/cappuccino, never burned, and oftentimes downright excellent.  Order a single shot with 6 oz. milk for a perfect ratio.  Oh, and someone taught these folks the real way to do foam.Service is friendly and quick, when the place isn't packed.  Slows down considerably as it gets busier, but still quite friendly. :)The avocado toast is downright amazing.  The freshness of the avocado can make or break this, but for a coffee shop, it has been remarkably and pleasantly consistent.An extra server during peak times and a credit card machine, and this would easily be 5 stars.  I wish I could pack this place up and take it with me back to Chicago at the end of the month.",4.0

"I really really like this place.  The first time I visited Iris Cafe, I noticed a sense of country-type calm (and I'm from the country, so I knows country-type calm when I sees it).  It reminded me of my favorite little restaurant upstate (including the please-clear-your-own-plates policy.)  The coffee is amazing, and the toast...ooohhhh the toast...with softboiled eggs is lovely (albeit expensive, but I figure I'm really paying for the atmosphere, not the eggs).  I realized when I got home and looked the place up on Yelp that the lovely tranquil feeling I had at Iris was probably because of the refreshing no laptops policy.  It was such a nice change to sip coffee surrounded by people reading the paper, jotting down notes with PENCILS, and having actual, *gasp*, conversation.  Remember conversation you guys?  Like, with the human sitting across from you?  I'll for sure be back to Iris.  It was a delight.",4.0

"I love this tiny place! I stayed nearby at a hotel and was looking for a nice place to get breakfast and some good coffee. I searched yelp for something near me and Iris Cafe popped up. I was not let down. After a little wandering around I found the cafe. They have great coffee - Stumptown, I had not had it prior to this visit, but now I look for it when I am out. For breakfast, I ordered a sandwich that had hard boiled eggs, Serrano ham and some greens, it was exactly what I wanted. I sat here for a couple of hours reading until the crowds started coming in, then I left to make room for others. It is a nice place to try out and if I am in the area again I will definitely make the effort to go back.",4.0
"Walking to Iris Cafe is like entering another world, full of adorable little streets and lovely Brooklyn Heights townhouses. And walk you will, because Iris Café is practically under the BQE. Perhaps it's its distance from the fray of Court Street that keeps Iris Café so welcoming and neighborly--you'll always find a seat here, likely due to their no-laptop rule (which, as a reader and crossword puzzler and not a freelancer, I love).The food is similarly exquisite: I've ordered a different pastry with every visit, and I've yet to be disappointed. And I haven't even gotten to the sandwich menu yet, of which I have heard raving reviews!My only gripe is that the staff of Iris Café likes to keep the front door propped open, even in our current deadly dead of winter. I get that the folks by the kitchen must be hot, but GAH, we are all freezing over here. Oh well. Gives me something to talk about with the strikingly good-lookin' people who frequent this place.",5.0
"The short:The food is awesome. Everything is farm fresh and organic. Portions are intriguing, creative, piquant and healthy sized! Prices are a bargin for the quality of the food. Waitstaff and cooks are incredibly friendly and knowledgable and the restaurant atmosphere is cozy, hip and welcoming. The long:I was in town from Boston and my friend had strongly recommended that I try Iris, I made the trip from Manhattan with a large party and was blown away. The restaurant has an open concept, the dining room and the kitchen are connected and separated only by the bar, which adds for a very charming and amicable feel. Upon entering you are greeted by extremely cordial employees, from the waitstaff to even the cooks (if you are lucky enough to sneak some eye contact when they're not prepping the food). The menu is very creative with daily original specials, the prices are extremely fair for the quality of the food you're receiving as most is from local farmers.My party started with oysters from long island, followed by the smoked trout pate, roasted vegetables and young greens. My partner and I followed with the fish in broth and the pasta of the day, which was a broccoli rabe pesto. We finished with the cheese plate, with local farm cheeses, the chocolate tarte, which was beautifully complemented with sea salt to add an invigorating contrast, and the posset of the day that was made with lavender and some how magically made without eggs and served with crunchy cookies which we were certain to use as spoons. I strongly recommend. Try to go with a large party so you can try a little bit of all the menu, there is so much ingenuity and such little stomachs! I really enjoyed my meals and my experience and it was not too hard on the wallet.",5.0
"This place is a staple for Saturday brunch in an otherwise dull neighborhood for restaurants. Brooklyn Heights is an awful neighborhood for food unless you like mediocre places, but Iris is great on all fronts. It's cute, well-priced, and the food is fantastic. Favorites include the huevos rancheros, which are so tasty and fresh; and the avocado toast with poached eggs. I have never had a pastry or biscuit here I didn't love either. The service is attentive also, no complaints. This place does get pretty busy so I am always impressed at how busy the staff is yet how quick they are. Usually don't have too much of a wait perhaps with a few exceptions. The one thing I don't care for though is the set up- primarily when the temperature is not ideal outside. The lack of one of those canvas restaurant doors in front means every time you open the door either cold air rushes in, in winter, or hot air rushes in, in summer. The heat or AC just don't have a chance against it's power. It also doesn't help that just about everyone coming in insists on standing in the doorway holding the door open with their bodies, or the staff does this as well.

"I lived above this cafe for a couple years and watched it make its transition from full-service cafe to restaurant. It's definitely found it's footing.Located on the more ""happening"" street of adorable Willow Town, Iris Cafe is the perfect spot to meet a friend for conversation over breakfast or lunch. I was surprised by how reasonable the prices are; considering the high quality of food and location in bougie Brooklyn Heights.If you don't have time to sit down and stay then make sure to visit their to-go/grocery location down the street.",4.0
"A cute little cafe on the edge of Brooklyn Heights. It has decent food, good beverages, and a really good vibe. It almost feels like the quintessential Brooklyn cafe that you might see in a movie. A nice little place to go for brunch or coffee.",4.0
Excellent salad nicoise. Great atmosphere. Had a really good gluten free sandwich from the takeaway store as well. If I lived in bk heights id be here a lot.,4.0
"A friend brought me here and introduced me to their lox and eggs sandwich. Simply put, it is to die for. Ingredients all seemed very fresh and worked well together. The eggs added both flavor and texture to the sandwich, and complemented the lox and the just-crunchy enough bread very well.The dining area is small, but it is well-lit and actually feels spacious. It's rather relaxing and makes for a great space for conversations.I'm only traveling through NYC, but I will definitely make my way back for breakfast before I leave the city!",5.0
"I really really like this place.  The first time I visited Iris Cafe, I noticed a sense of country-type calm (and I'm from the country, so I knows country-type calm when I sees it).  It reminded me of my favorite little restaurant upstate (including the please-clear-your-own-plates policy.)  The coffee is amazing, and the toast...ooohhhh the toast...with softboiled eggs is lovely (albeit expensive, but I figure I'm really paying for the atmosphere, not the eggs).  I realized when I got home and looked the place up on Yelp that the lovely tranquil feeling I had at Iris was probably because of the refreshing no laptops policy.  It was such a nice change to sip coffee surrounded by people reading the paper, jotting down notes with PENCILS, and having actual, *gasp*, conversation.  Remember conversation you guys?  Like, with the human sitting across from you?  I'll for sure be back to Iris.  It was a delight.",4.0
"ok, this place gets the two stars it does because my server was kind and the decor is lovely.  now, for my problems: if you have a ""no laptop"" policy, do everyone a favor and post that on your website for all to see. don't wait until i've ordered an expensive coffee beverage and set up shop to condescendingly tell me so.  the woman who informed me was not my server, and it wasn't totally clear to me what role she was playing in the cafe at all.  additionally, it was 2pm, and there were many free tables, so this was just on principle.  on a slightly picky note, the latte was a bit milky for my taste (this happens from time to time, so not a big deal), the price point was a little unreasonable (4.25 for a latte means i'm paying for your restoration hardware decor) and the place is cash only.  i can understand why people like this place--their food looks great, and the street is beautiful and quiet--but i felt unwelcome.  this kind of shop belongs in westchester.",2.0
"I love this tiny place! I stayed nearby at a hotel and was looking for a nice place to get breakfast and some good coffee. I searched yelp for something near me and Iris Cafe popped up. I was not let down. After a little wandering around I found the cafe. They have great coffee - Stumptown, I had not had it prior to this visit, but now I look for it when I am out. For breakfast, I ordered a sandwich that had hard boiled eggs, Serrano ham and some greens, it was exactly what I wanted. I sat here for a couple of hours reading until the crowds started coming in, then I left to make room for others. It is a nice place to try out and if I am in the area again I will definitely make the effort to go back.",4.0
"Walking to Iris Cafe is like entering another world, full of adorable little streets and lovely Brooklyn Heights townhouses. And walk you will, because Iris Café is practically under the BQE. Perhaps it's its distance from the fray of Court Street that keeps Iris Café so welcoming and neighborly--you'll always find a seat here, likely due to their no-laptop rule (which, as a reader and crossword puzzler and not a freelancer, I love).The food is similarly exquisite: I've ordered a different pastry with every visit, and I've yet to be disappointed. And I haven't even gotten to the sandwich menu yet, of which I have heard raving reviews!My only gripe is that the staff of Iris Café likes to keep the front door propped open, even in our current deadly dead of winter. I get that the folks by the kitchen must be hot, but GAH, we are all freezing over here. Oh well. Gives me something to talk about with the strikingly good-lookin' people who frequent this place.",5.0
"The short:The food is awesome. Everything is farm fresh and organic. Portions are intriguing, creative, piquant and healthy sized! Prices are a bargin for the quality of the food. Waitstaff and cooks are incredibly friendly and knowledgable and the restaurant atmosphere is cozy, hip and welcoming. The long:I was in town from Boston and my friend had strongly recommended that I try Iris, I made the trip from Manhattan with a large party and was blown away. The restaurant has an open concept, the dining room and the kitchen are connected and separated only by the bar, which adds for a very charming and amicable feel. Upon entering you are greeted by extremely cordial employees, from the waitstaff to even the cooks (if you are lucky enough to sneak some eye contact when they're not prepping the food). The menu is very creative with daily original specials, the prices are extremely fair for the quality of the food you're receiving as most is from local farmers.My party started with oysters from long island, followed by the smoked trout pate, roasted vegetables and young greens. My partner and I followed with the fish in broth and the pasta of the day, which was a broccoli rabe pesto. We finished with the cheese plate, with local farm cheeses, the chocolate tarte, which was beautifully complemented with sea salt to add an invigorating contrast, and the posset of the day that was made with lavender and some how magically made without eggs and served with crunchy cookies which we were certain to use as spoons. I strongly recommend. Try to go with a large party so you can try a little bit of all the menu, there is so much ingenuity and such little stomachs! I really enjoyed my meals and my experience and it was not too hard on the wallet.",5.0
"This place is a staple for Saturday brunch in an otherwise dull neighborhood for restaurants. Brooklyn Heights is an awful neighborhood for food unless you like mediocre places, but Iris is great on all fronts. It's cute, well-priced, and the food is fantastic. Favorites include the huevos rancheros, which are so tasty and fresh; and the avocado toast with poached eggs. I have never had a pastry or biscuit here I didn't love either. The service is attentive also, no complaints. This place does get pretty busy so I am always impressed at how busy the staff is yet how quick they are. Usually don't have too much of a wait perhaps with a few exceptions. The one thing I don't care for though is the set up- primarily when the temperature is not ideal outside. The lack of one of those canvas restaurant doors in front means every time you open the door either cold air rushes in, in winter, or hot air rushes in, in summer. The heat or AC just don't have a chance against it's power. It also doesn't help that just about everyone coming in insists on standing in the doorway holding the door open with their bodies, or the staff does this as well. It's a minor detail, but I have had notably miserable brunches there because of it. My suggestion to Iris is - put up the door addition at least when it is cold out please!",4.0
"Very cute neighborhood spot.  Feels very Berkeley (Bay Area shout-out).  Stumptown coffee here.  Nice windows to let in light.  Had the poached eggs with ""soldiers,"" which are little strips of toast for dipping.  Yeah this toast?  Delicious!  It was like some wheat/rye/multigrain bread.  Went perfectly and those soldiers went down one by one as they were dipped into the molten egg and then in my belly!  mmmmm.Main gripes -- cafes need more pastries.  Like Tazza.  Tazza has great pastries.  But poor coffee.  Iris Cafe has good coffee but pretty much no pastries.  The sandwiches look good, albeit a bit pricey I'd say.  But I will say this.  Best coffee in Brooklyn Heights.  Not hard since we're dealing with Connecticut Muffin, Sbux, and Tazza.  I can def see myself coming here more often.  Good place to go on a weekend and read.  And the communal tables?  Good touch -- perfect for interacting with fellow Brooklyn Heights peeps.",4.0
"This place is adorable. That goes without saying. When it first opened, it quickly became my New Favorite Place. Great coffee (how cute is the flower they swirl into the cappuccinos?) and tasty, rustic sandwiches.

Because it was a circus. And life is too short.By the time I came back, they had outlawed computers but had also taken my favorite sandwich -- The Ploughman -- off the menu. At that point, all of the cafe's other shortcomings started to become more obvious. It takes forever to get your food half the time. They need a more efficient system. Also, they turned the original Plated Breakfast (which was a perfect combination of soft-boiled eggs and serrano ham) into one of the most disgusting things I've ever eaten. I ordered it without looking at the new description, so it was totally my fault. But still, they should at least call it The Plated Breakfast 2.0 or something.I recently heard that the Ploughman is back on the menu, so I'll go back soon and give the place a fresh review.",3.0

"It's wonderful to have a Real Food restaurant/cafe in Bklyn Heights. Since they opened, I've stopped in on the way to the dog run to pick up a cup of Stumptown. This weekend, I followed up on the glowing NYT and New Yorker reviews and tried Iris for brunch. The accolades are well deserved. The plated breakfast of soft-boiled eggs on a bed of cheddar cheese grits, with ham and whole grain toast with fresh butter is delicious and satisfying. The ploughman's sandwich is lovely. And those cheddar/ham scones--wow, right out of the oven and memorable. Very good coffee expertly crafted by the obligatory young grunge/granola/hipster barista. You go to the counter to order, and often to pick up your food. You're expected to bus your own table. Somehow it works, even with a line out the door on a crisp Spring Saturday morning. I hope this encourages more Real Food restaurants to open and keeps away the processed food chains that line Court and Montague St.",4.0
"This place is situated on a lovely, quaint block in Brooklyn Heights and it's truly delightful.  Everything was fresh and delicious.  I had the breakfast plate, which came with eggs, grits and cheese, toast and ham.  I honestly felt like I was eating food right off of a farm.Also, the place has a non-rushed, casual feel.  It seems as though you could sit for hours and chat with friends or work or read the paper.  And the decor is very soothing, with light blues and blonde woods making you truly feel as though you're in a kitchen in somebody's country house.The only reasons I didn't give this place five stars were: 1) there was no ice this past Sunday, so it was impossible to order an iced coffee.  Which seems weird in the spring; 2) I'm not crazy about the Grey Dog-like method of ordering wherein you go up to the counter, tell them what you want and somebody brings it to you.  Seems like it'd be more relaxing, and it would give an additional person a job, if they had a waitperson for the tables; and 3) as amazing as the food was, we were still hungry when we left.  Not a knock on the food, but the portions could be slightly larger.I would still recommend this place wholeheartedly though, and if I lived in Brooklyn Heights I would probably be in there every day.",4.0

"Breakfast of eggs and such was nice.  Fresh and homemede tasting overall, with tasty fresh pepper and thinly sliced ham adding a gourmet touch.  A wonderful ham and cheddar biscuit.  Dense and moist with a hint of zestiness.  I could definitely get addicted to these.  Good cappuccino, but I personally prefer it a little stronger/bolder.  That said, it's still better than other Broooklyn Heights coffee options.Good tunes.  Mellow, acoustic-guitar based stuff from all eras.  Bottom line: a welcome addition to the area.  Please visit this place; the neighborhood needs it.",4.0
"Iris Cafe is in a super cute spot near the river. It can definitely get crowded on a Sunday brunchtime, but it's easy enough to wait by the bar and drink coffee until a table opens up. Huevos Rancheros and avocado toast & eggs are delish. The service can be a little inattentive at times, but it's a great spot for brunch. Never been there for lunch/dinner but I've heard it's great too.",4.0
"This place is cute and neighborhoody, and a great way to spend a weekday morning reading a magazine and sipping on coffee. I love stumptown coffee, so that's the reason I keep going back. I've never been disappointed with ANY of the dishes, except for the fact that the menu can sometimes be a little pricey for the quantity of food offered.A word to the wise... this place is very ""Brooklyn."" I have seen numerous mothers breastfeeding from time to time. I once saw a 3 year old hipster-in-training adorned in plaid, with androgynous hair, wearing a cape and drinking what he thought was ""coffee."" (I wonder what it really was, unless s/he was actually drinking coffee, in which case, that's terrifying) I love it, but it may not be everyone's cup of tea.",4.0
"It's wonderful to have a Real Food restaurant/cafe in Bklyn Heights. Since they opened, I've stopped in on the way to the dog run to pick up a cup of Stumptown. This weekend, I followed up on the glowing NYT and New Yorker reviews and tried Iris for brunch. The accolades are well deserved. The plated breakfast of soft-boiled eggs on a bed of cheddar cheese grits, with ham and whole grain toast with fresh butter is delicious and satisfying. The ploughman's sandwich is lovely. And those cheddar/ham scones--wow, right out of the oven and memorable. Very good coffee expertly crafted by the obligatory young grunge/granola/hipster barista. You go to the counter to order, and often to pick up your food. You're expected to bus your own table. Somehow it works, even with a line out the door on a crisp Spring Saturday morning. I hope this encourages more Real Food restaurants to open and keeps away the processed food chains that line Court and Montague St.",4.0
"This place is situated on a lovely, quaint block in Brooklyn Heights and it's truly delightful.  Everything was fresh and delicious.  I had the breakfast plate, which came with eggs, grits and cheese, toast and ham.  I honestly felt like I was eating food right off of a farm.Also, the place has a non-rushed, casual feel.  It seems as though you could sit for hours and chat with friends or work or read the paper.  And the decor is very soothing, with light blues and blonde woods making you truly feel as though you're in a kitchen in somebody's country house.The only reasons I didn't give this place five stars were: 1) there was no ice this past Sunday, so it was impossible to order an iced coffee.  Which seems weird in the spring; 2) I'm not crazy about the Grey Dog-like method of ordering wherein you go up to the counter, tell them what you want and somebody brings it to you.  Seems like it'd be more relaxing, and it would give an additional person a job, if they had a waitperson for the tables; and 3) as amazing as the food was, we were still hungry when we left.  Not a knock on the food, but the portions could be slightly larger.I would still recommend this place wholeheartedly though, and if I lived in Brooklyn Heights I would probably be in there every day.",4.0

"I'm writing this review in response to the recent attacks on Iris Cafe's no laptop/iPad policy.I'm a writer, so I appreciate cafes that let me spend hours writing there, but I think it's pretty entitled to believe that you deserve this privilege.  First of all, it's a private business, they don't owe you anything.  If you don't want to go back, go online at Starbucks.  Secondly, anyone that's ever run a restaurant or cafe knows that survival depends on turning over tables.  How many writers you know constantly make substantial purchases to warrant their time there?I think this is bringing into focus a lot of cafe owner's business plans, and many are dealing with this dilemma in creative ways: nytimes.com/2010/08/25/d…eastvillage.thelocal.nyt…So if a cafe wants to offer wifi and laptops, great.  But if they don't, I don't believe we should knock their stars down for it.  What the Iris Cafe should do is offer wifi and laptops during certain non-peak hours.  I was just there between 8:30 - 10 this morning (a Tuesday) and it was packed, definitely not the time for laptops.  But if you're there at 3p and there's nobody around, then yeah, they should relax a little.Bottom line: this is a FANTASTIC cafe--a neighborhood secret, great Stumptown coffee, cute (great tin ceiling), good food, communal feel.",5.0

"I've been here twice in the last few weeks and am thinking of becoming a regular!  Location/space:  It's on one of the quaintest streets in NYC, with wooden houses that have rocking chairs on their front porches across the street (so cute).  They are also next door to a historic building that used to house dockworkers that has great ironwork details (take a gander).  The actual space, itself, is old-school Brooklyn with exposed brick and vintage tables and chairs.  It's a very comfy, relaxed space (though I have to admit that I've only gone after the rush has died down and it may not be so idyllic during busier times).Coffee:  I recently switched my coffee drink to something I'm ambivalent about (I'm on a diet) so I don't love any of the coffees I drink, lately.  Having said that, I generally love Stumptown and don't see that their Stumptown is any different from Cafe Pedlar's (but Pedlar's doesn't have food really and is not a sit-down restaurant-y kind of place like Iris is).  Food:  This is where I've been pleasantly surprised.  I knew that the location was cute and figured they would have good coffee, but the food is above and beyond what I expected, especially for a coffeehouse that could get away with mediocre sandwiches/food.  The first time I went, I got the egg salad sandwich which is not the typical egg salad.  It comes with sliced hardboiled eggs with various and sundry other items (I forget).  Today, I got the ham sandwich which seemed to have small pickles in it.  They ran out of whole wheat toast which is how it's usually made and the waitress suggested I try it on cranberry bread.  That sounded like an odd pairing and I said so (nicely) and the waitress said, ""Haven't you ever had a ham sandwich with jelly on it?""  Can't say that I have.  Anyway, I felt like living life on the edge (heh, heh) so I got the ham sandwich on cranberry bread and it was INCREDIBLE.  Really. Waitstaff:  There is a waitress there with black-rimmed glasses who is friendly and nice but who is a bit slow and unaware.  Both times I noticed that she walks around the room without ever looking at the tables to make sure they don't need anything or making eye contact with anyone so it's hard to get her attention.  The first time, I needed napkins, utensils, a straw and simple syrup for my iced drink (yeah, I know, I shouldn't have had the simple syrup on a diet).  I asked her for all 3 at the same time but each time she came to the table with only 1 item and I had to ask for the others.  There's another waitress who, the first time I was there, was staffing the cash register.  She patiently and cheerfully answered my many questions about their unusual menu pairings.  Today, she was my second waitress (I think the first one was done with her shift because I didn't see her again) and she is the one who suggested I get my ham sandwich on cranberry bread (she also laughed at my lame joke so she gets points for that).  In summary:  adorable space, amazing, better-than-it-has-to-be food, and friendly, if somewhat distracted, waitstaff.  Can't wait to go back to try other meals!",4.0
"I feel like Iris Cafe is good for me, morally, like a brisk walk in the countryside or an essay by Ralph Waldo Emerson. It's good food made simply and well, and even in New York (or perhaps especially in New York) that's not something to take for granted. Lately I find myself coming here nearly every weekend, because it's just so wonderful to start the day with a walk around beautiful Brooklyn Heights, a meal of a delicious biscuit and eggs, and a good cup of coffee. The space gets great light and the decor is pleasantly plain and unfussy. Overall it feels like eating in someone's farmhouse.Now, let's talk about that food again for a minute. I don't want to overhype it because it's not haute cuisine or anything, and sometimes the biscuits are over-chewy or the eggs are over-poached. The whole point here, for me, is not the perfection of the food but just the sensory pleasures I derive from its simple, wholesome goodness. I poke my poached egg with a spoon until the yolk oozes out, scoop up the perfect quantity of yolk and white along with a bite of ham-and-egg biscuit slathered with fresh butter, take a bite and savor the sweetness of the biscuit, salty ham, slippery egg, melted butter. I actually take the time to appreciate each mouthful, and by the time I finish, I'm in a great mood. It's true that it gets very crowded here at rush times - I've never actually been unable to get a seat, but I wouldn't want to linger at a table after I finished my meal. The great thing, though, is how nice (most) people are about the crowdedness. A lot of folks share tables with strangers, and when they're done, they get up and leave to make way for newcomers -  if you stop by I hope you'll do the same.

"It's time for Iris to step up its game and move in more of a Marlow & Sons direction. Most of what's on sale at the new Iris To Go is distinctly mediocre and overpriced, with the exception of the nice local eggs, milk, and Handsome coffee. Why isn't the produce beautiful and local, and why are they selling stupid things like ground supermarket spices? They seem not to have decided on whether they are a gourmet store or a bodega, yet their prices would suggest the former. This wouldn't be a formula for success if there were more competition, viz. Depanneur, Marlow, or plenty of other places in North Brooklyn. Iris, why don't you commit to doing more than looking and acting cute and really bring in the best baked goods (better and crispier baguettes, please), the best local produce, and how about a cheese counter, too?

"Darling, delightful, delicious...I had the loveliest lunch here. I ordered the Proper Tuna Sandwich. It was, hands down, the best tuna sandwich I've ever had. Crusty French bread, perfect soft boiled egg, tuna, haricots vertes and, instead of mayo, fruity delicious olive oil. Amazing.",5.0
"Pros: Simple, good food.  Great eggs and salads.  Small menu so everything is made with care.Cons: Not particularly courteous counter service.  Too few places to sit and eat. Do not even bother trying to go for brunch on Saturday or Sunday.  Lots of people are there to work on their lap tops and nurse a cup of coffee for hours.  They never move to accommodate other patrons, nor does the staff assist with seating at all.",3.0
"It's time for Iris to step up its game and move in more of a Marlow & Sons direction. Most of what's on sale at the new Iris To Go is distinctly mediocre and overpriced, with the exception of the nice local eggs, milk, and Handsome coffee. Why isn't the produce beautiful and local, and why are they selling stupid things like ground supermarket spices? They seem not to have decided on whether they are a gourmet store or a bodega, yet their prices would suggest the former. This wouldn't be a formula for success if there were more competition, viz. Depanneur, Marlow, or plenty of other places in North Brooklyn. Iris, why don't you commit to doing more than looking and acting cute and really bring in the best baked goods (better and crispier baguettes, please), the best local produce, and how about a cheese counter, too? Just because you're the only game in the neighborhood doesn't mean you can afford to be complacent. It's really time to kick it up a notch.",2.0
"Awesome place!!! I don't know  what's their secret but  coffee tastes incredible here.It's located on quite, residential block and if you don't live in the area might be hard to find at first. But it is soo worth it (I drove all the way from Sheepsheadbay here) I would give anything to have this place at least  a little closer to home so I could have it every day!",5.0
"What is going on with these soft-boiled eggs? I cook a lot, love food, but wow, the concept of how great an egg can be, was changed for me here. Very pleasant little place, if a bit pretentious. Great coffee, as mentioned, but not quite as good as places like Abraco or 9th Street. That becomes irrelevant, however, when the food is factored in.",5.0
"Stopped by for a sticky bun and ham and cheese scone.  Both were delish!  I love this hidden, tucked away gem of a place.  Very light and airy place with lots of local produce including milk and eggs!  food is very fresh, people super friendly as well.  Sticky bun was sooo  yummy as was the scone so I assume everything else as well is really good.  Will frequent again soon!",4.0
"There is almost nothing not to love about Iris Cafe. Beautiful and unpretentious little place with high ceilings, brick walls, and thankfully nary an angry artiste in its employ. Stumptown coffee is a lovely addition to the neighborhood, the ham and cheddar biscuits are a dream, and even though I've never bought a dozen eggs here I think it's sort of adorable that the option is there. Also: Soundtrack skews toward bluegrass.",5.0

"My wife and I love Iris cafe.Think old-world, rustic, French country setting, on a beautiful, quiet block in historic Brooklyn Heights. We have made it a weekly tradition to come here (taking advantage of the free internet) while we do our laundry just down the street. Going on three weeks now and thus far we have had the boiled eggs plate talked about in other reviews. Simply delicious...the eggs are boiled to perfection. Not overdone. Unlike any other boiled eggs I've had. Whole grain bread and tomatoes make it perfectly filling. The cheese with Serrano ham biscuit melts in your mouth. Baguettes are wonderfully light and chewy enough. Dangerous sticky buns and the French pressed coffee reminds me of the best brews I had while in Amsterdam. My wife loves the cortado. In short, give this place a visit before you dare step foot in Starbucks a few blocks away. Prices are great too.",5.0

"Iris serves Stumptown coffee; which is a welcomed addition to the not-so-great coffee choices Brooklyn Heights residents have been dealing with up to this point.  The cafe sits on a quiet residential block; it's decor is both imminently pleasing and homey feeling.  The owner is there 95% of the time and she's friendly, helpful, and relatively cheery. The menu is sparse but everything on it is delicious.  Their ham and cheddar biscuits have me rerouting my daily activities in order to swing in and grab one.  They also sell a variety of organic and local grocery items: breads, milk, eggs, and cheese. However, like any good coffee spot with free wifi: come past 10am and every table will have one person at it with a laptop.  Meaning: if you come with more than one person in tow, looking for a table, you'd better hope you find someone that will be okay with sharing a table with you and your party or be okay with reassigning themselves to a table with a fellow laptop user.  In the summer this won't be such a problem as there is a park at the end of the street with benches and tables and it will be easy enough to grab coffee and biscuits and head there, but during the winter when it's cold and rainy I just want to be able to sit down in the warm and not have to play musical tables to do so.All in all this place rocks.  It is a well needed addition to Brooklyn Heights.",4.0

"Disagree.  Offbeat is good, but this place smacked of Williamsburg/Greenpoint hipster pretense.  Overpriced rustic contrarian fare.  Indifferent but hip-looking staff.  The setting and service is definitely coffee shop, not restaurant--we ordered at a counter, sat at a not-yet-cleaned table by the coffee dispensers, then waited while our orders arrived one-by-one.  Everything served on rustic brown craft paper, if that's your thing.  Despite all this rusticity, this place manages to charge prices that are right there with a proper sit-down brunch.  I ordered a mediocre, tepid scrambled eggs concoction that set me back $9 or so and left me hungry.  Point of clarification to a previous reviewer: this is not ""tucked away down by the water""--it is tucked away under the BQE.",1.0

"The cheddar and ham biscuits are the perfect savory snack on their own, or topped with a soft boiled egg. Interested in something a little sweeter, try the Nutella, oat and sea salt bars.

I was starving after I ate there and I am not a big eater. I was really disappointed. It wouldn't take a lot for this place to be great.

"I had high hopes for this place. Visited on a Monday morning a couple weeks back hoping to try their oatmeal, which was sadly taken off the menu because the weather was getting warmer. I was bummed and instead ordered the granola with plain yogurt. Originally, I ordered the granola with the maple yogurt, but apparently they ran out. Another bummer. The granola was nothing to write home about. In fact it was pretty plain and not worth the $5. The larger issue I had with this place is that they decided to install their AC unit while I was there. The drilling permeated the entire room. Not only was I eating crappy granola, disappointed by the lack of maple yogurt and the fact they discontinued their oatmeal, but I couldn't even hear myself think. Why couldn't they install the AC after hours??? Completely turned off by this place.",1.0
