"Five stars for quality and deliciousness and atmosphere We stopped in for brunch There was a large selection of wines, cocktails, beers, and brunch drinks (try the Italian)I like their minimalistic approach to food Excellent quality, excellent pairings, and delicious The atmosphere was rustic and peaceful, clean and calm The crowd was calm as well. Not noisy.Get there early as it gets crowdedI think maybe the seating  arrangements were a little too close for comfort.The smoked salmon was delicious Pulled pork was great for spicy lovers Avocado toast is a must tryThe only down side was the menu is heavy with bread dishes (sandwiches). They dont have too much variety in terms of meat dishes and sidesThey serve one type of desert from four and twenty blackbirds bakery (which is oh so good).",5.0
"I read a recent eater article that explained how yelp reviews should be dismissed/discounted based on their factoring-in of the quality of service (or lack thereof).  I'm not sure I agree with this, especially after my most recent dining experience at rucola. I review dining holistically - there are many factors I consider when I rate a place and I believe the service quality has to one of them. In this case, our server's poor service completely detracted from what was otherwise a great meal. I won't go into specifics, but I really hope this was an off night for him (although... we actually had the same server the first time we visited the restaurant and he was the same. this time was worse). The food, however, is outstanding. From the bread and olive oil, to the pasta (spaghetti is better IMO between the 2 options), the endive salad, the trout, the standout being the beef shank. Absolutely delicious. Super cute atmosphere, dimly lit and very rustic feeling.  A bit tight on space (don't expect space to spread out). Wait time can be long, but there are bars nearby.",4.0
"This place is so overrated. On a recent trip for lunch, I tried to order a turkey sandwich- turkey being one of the ingredients most represented on the very limited lunch menu- and was told, without regret or apology, by the dismissive and rude server, that they were out of turkey. What followed was almost comically bad service, with it taking an hour to prepare a sandwich that consisted of one piece of meat and bread, and a shockingly inattentive- mostly absent- server. Also, it's not cheap!Dinner experiences have been better there but still don't understand the lines/wait/hype surrounding this place.",1.0
Cute brunch place in great BH location. It's designed well with lots of natural light and two tables right beside the window. I wish there were more places like this in BH as the wait is often too long to be reasonable for a relaxing brunch.,4.0
"Very cozy ambiance with a decent brunch menu. Had the avocado toast with tomatoes and shared the French toast with my friend who ordered the salmon plate. All in all, a nice little brunch. The service was good too. Would love to go back!",4.0
"My friend and I had the arugula salad to start, the whole roasted trout (fresh and light with lemon and parsley) and salmon entrees (my friend had this one, but I did have a bite of the wild mushrooms). We both enjoyed the food! Simple food, done well. There is something on the menu for everyone!My take away, is that they're a local restaurant that really succeeds with having great food, and great staff. I'll definitely be back to try other items on the menu- especially one of their pastas! Ideally, getting a few things and sharing would be nice!",4.0
"An out of the way, kind of in the middle of nowhere restaurant that wins points for their full blast air conditioning and rustic decor more than for their food or service.We had weekday breakfast here, which was filling but lackluster. The country breakfast, while a big plate, didn't astound at all: the potatoes were flavorless, the toast was almost burnt, and the smoked pancetta was kind of weak.All in all, an okay breakfast spot if you're in the neighborhood but don't go out of your way.",3.0
"So. darn. good.My boyfriend & I were a few blocks away (he was getting his haircut), and it was around 7pm, so I figured a Thursday night would be the perfect opportunity to get into Rucola without a long wait.  I was right (we didn't have to wait), but it's not because the place wasn't PACKED, it was definitely because we got very lucky and the timing worked out perfectly.  I ordered a glass of their sangiovese and their cavatelli with wild mushrooms for my meal.  The pasta was perfect!  And the portion was huge, so I happily allowed my boyfriend to have as much as he wanted with his steak (which he also said was perfect).",4.0
"Love the food here. Went here twice. Had the cauliflower and eggplants for an appetizer and then moved on to the pastas. Everything was superbly delicious. Made the mistake to get the chocolate pudding and couldn't finish it - it was so good, though! Next time I will share it, no way to finish it otherwise. The service is reasonably nice and pretty fast. We sat at the bar once and at a table another time. The only downside is the huge wait on some weekdays and of course the weekend. It's a bit of a turn-off having to wait 40 minutes for a free spot, but I guess that's a good sign for the restaurant. When in doubt, I'd give 4 1/2 stars, but yelp only allows for full stars so you get my full vote, Rucola....",5.0
"Great place for brunch!  Gorgeous decor with a really distinct rustic weathered-wood theme going on -- I would kill to have this place be my kitchen / dining room.  I came here with a few friends for brunch on a Saturday -- prices are reasonable, and servings are also fair for the price (especially sandwich plates).  I had the smoked salmon platter with deliciously crispy potato pancakes and sour cream, which was good and filling, and also the (very creamy and rich!) yogurt topped with granola / berries / local honey.  The coffee selections are a little bit on the pricey side.  Overall, adorable farm-themed place that I will be looking forward to visiting again for dinner or regular lunch!",4.0
"Cute, quaint, good food, strong hipster vibe.  Not sure about adding all that spiciness in pastas, seems to take a bit away from its simplicity, but the service is great and place very adorable especially if you get a seat up front by the little window alcove.One big plus is this place opens late.",4.0
"This review is coming from an angry place, so take that for what it's worth. I walked in today (which is a touch drizzly - relevant later) and asked whether there's wifi available for me to do work. Someone appearing to be the manager says, ""absolutely."" Sat down at the bar, ordered tea (with intentions on ordering lunch), and asked for wifi password. After logging in, I discovered that their wifi is absolute garbage. Asked the bartender about it - it was her first day so she asked the manager. He told her that the wifi isn't great when it rains, which she relayed to me. I said I wanted to settle up and leave, because I needed wifi. They charged me $3 for the tea and I left. Issues:-Manager should have notified me that the wifi isn't functional on days like today-Manager should have come over to explain rather than dispassionately answering the bartender - or at the very least the bartender should have offered a response other than, ""Shucks, sorry."" -THERE IS NO WAY THEY SHOULD HAVE CHARGED ME $3 FOR A TEA I DID NOT DRINKTalk about first world problems.

I went here for a bacon egg and cheese sandwich which was quite good. I also had the potato gratin which was also good. In fact there was nothing left on my plate. I think the three stars is a combination of the space is cramped and the hostess and servers were apathetic at best. I would have given it two stars but the food was deserving of four stars. The waitress reached for my plate and began picking it up as I still had my hand to my mouth with my last bite of sandwich. When she saw I still had half of the potato gratin remaining and that my utensils were on the plate she picked up and then put down. Also I was dining alone but not once did anyone ask if I needed anything or if the food was to my liking. I'm not sure if I would return...I might because I enjoyed the meal just not the service.,3.0

"This is an updated review, having been back three times in the last few months, I have to say I'm (sadly) not as impressed as i was initially. The good: Both the beat and eggplant apps are still fabulous- simple yet flavorful. We also had a great waitress who was upbeat, aware, and super competent. The blah: Rice ball appetizer with saffron had little to no taste. The porchetta entree involved a small piece of fatty, seemingly low quality meat over a heap of well flavored grains. Meh.

It came with baby carrots that were roasted to hell and back (not a bad thing, they were melty tender).

"My wife and I, upon a friends recommendation, suggested this place for our 10th Wedding Anniversary. Having not lived in NY for a decade we were so out of the loop in terms of the BoCoCa food scene any suggestions were welcome.We were not disappointed at all. I had open tabled a nearby restaurant but figured I would give them a call to see how it was looking for a Saturday night at 7.  As soon as I mentioned our special occasion the kind gentleman on the other end didn't flinch for a second and welcomed me with open arms and a solid guarantee that he would be able to seat us.  It was one of the best meals my wife and I have had in a long time and were so happy to dine at this excellent restaurant. It reminded us a lot of Peasant on Elizabeth Street one of our favorites and similar in cuisine and atmosphere.Thanks man with glasses and a hat and your warm disposition and attentive staff!

"My beau and I had tried to get into Rucola on Valentine's Day this year. Ha! As if. We tried again, and had better luck, on another weekend. Feeling a little indulgent, we settled into our seats at the communal farm table with the well-rounded wine list. A bottle of Sangiovese, fresh bread and some appetizers were the perfect way to start the meal. The roasted beets were delicious, and the fried Brussels sprouts were to die for. On my way out later I noticed that they do call-ahead orders for pick up, and I might just have to start working fried Brussels sprouts (to go) into my weekly grocery list. I got the pasta w/tomatoes and eggplant, and it was great. Perfect size to make me feel satiated, not completely stuffed. He got the roast chicken and polished off the entire plate as well, although commented later on that it was a bit salty. All in all, a great meal in a nice atmosphere. Our server was very friendly and helpful as we were placing our orders, but after we'd gotten our main course we noticed that she didn't come over until we were finished to ask how the food was. I'm sure if we had been noticeably unhappy she would have stopped by sooner, but it would have been nice for a stop-over regardless.",4.0

It's such a great spot for a rainy day, when you want top shelf bread and piping hot soup to warm your heart. And did I mention the pasta? No? Well...it's carbolicious.Service is outstanding -- I've never had a bad experience with a waiter.

This place is cute and intimate; great for a date night. The service is quick and very helpful when it comes to picking a type of wine. The food is tasty and different. It's a nice change from the usual but not your typical Italian restaurant.,4.0
"My boyfriend and I stumbled in to this adorable little restaurant last Tuesday and boy were we glad we did! First off, I've never felt cozier. Very Brooklyn hipster vibe with a down home relaxed feel. NOW LETS TALK ABOUT THE FOOD....We shared the Burrata Crostino with sliced peaches and honey...as amazing as it soundsFlank steak over kale and Gorgonzola ...perfectly cooked with amazing flavorPasta Special which had cheese and corn and shrimp and blew my mind!!! Me and my boyfriend literally fought over these leftovers the next day!!!!The service was excellent, the food was excellent, the vibes were excellent...so nice to find a restaurant with this great of food without the pretentious attitude or price tag.We will be back....this week???",5.0
"My wife and I, upon a friends recommendation, suggested this place for our 10th Wedding Anniversary. Having not lived in NY for a decade we were so out of the loop in terms of the BoCoCa food scene any suggestions were welcome.We were not disappointed at all. I had open tabled a nearby restaurant but figured I would give them a call to see how it was looking for a Saturday night at 7.  As soon as I mentioned our special occasion the kind gentleman on the other end didn't flinch for a second and welcomed me with open arms and a solid guarantee that he would be able to seat us.  It was one of the best meals my wife and I have had in a long time and were so happy to dine at this excellent restaurant. It reminded us a lot of Peasant on Elizabeth Street one of our favorites and similar in cuisine and atmosphere.Thanks man with glasses and a hat and your warm disposition and attentive staff! We walked over to Brooklyn Social for a night cap and vowed to be back to Rucola in the near future!",5.0

"Went for brunch with my husband over the weekend and we were definitely impressed. Great decor, lively atmosphere and a bit tucked away from the ""main drag"" of Smith Street so it feels like you've stepped inside some great secret when you arrive. But let's talk about the food.Every restaurant in New York offers brunch these days, but I feel like it can be a bit difficult to get away from the usual mediocre eggs Benedict and pancakes/French toast that seem to dominate every menu. Rucola's take on brunch was a refreshing change of pace, though they do offer poached eggs and brioche French toast if familiar is what you're looking for. More unique offerings include a Caprese sandwich and a broccoli rabe dish with sausage, heirloom beans and a poached egg. I had the smoked salmon which was served with a very refreshing cucumber salad, crispy hash brown potato cakes (which were a lot like fat latkes) and sour cream with fresh dill. They weren't stingy with the salmon and the cucumber salad complemented the meal quite nicely. My husband got the breakfast sandwich with a side of potato gratin - both of which were fabulous. I have a world of appreciation for a deliciously greasy deli breakfast sandwich, but one made with a soft, airy roll and local bacon and eggs is really something else. We didn't partake in the brunch cocktails, though they had a decent selection (and the Bloody Marys at the next table looked damn good). My only complaint is that Rucola is a small space, and they really utilize every inch of the place, so you're often -- quite literally -- back to back with someone else. It's a bit of a thing to get up to use the restroom, or leave, as a result. But, the food was perfect and the price was right, so getting a little cozy with your neighbors is a pretty small price to pay. Already planning our next visit to try out dinner and dessert.",5.0

"I've only ever come to Rucola at 5:30 on a weekday so it's never been an issue for me grabbing a table.

The portions are perfect and the food is tasty and cooked beautifully. I could eat their crudo every meal, every day, for the rest of my life. The olive oil they use is liquid heaven. Speaking of liquid heaven, their servers are chock full of knowledgeable wine recommendations and I've never not had a delicious glass of wine at Rucola. Even their salads are flavorful and delicious, and it takes quite a bit of convincing for me to truly enjoy a salad. I recommend this restaurant to everyone.",5.0

The food was prepared to perfection, but I would have liked to see the chef's creativity more clearly in a full menu.We did leave a little hungry! At the risk of sounding cheap, I think Rucola would do well to increase the portions slightly for a $95 price tag.

From the very first enquiry email, I knew we'd found the perfect place.

Our guests adored the restaurant, the food, the wine and everything about the evening. Thank you!",5.0

The food was excellent, the attention to detail and execution was impeccable. Every bite I took directly refuted the laws of diminishing returns. Incredible. I was also lucky enough to meet one of the owners, Julian, who sat outside and shared a beer and slice of 420 Blackbirds pie with me. What an incredible guy. It made me really feel at home. As patrons walked out of the restaurant there was a chorus of 'oh my god that was delicious' and 'we have to come back soon'.  I can't rate or recommend this restaurant high enough. If yelp offered 6 stars Rucola would be a ten. If I find myself in Brooklyn again, I will most certainly come back!",5.0
"This was our first meal on our recent NYC trip and we were starving after taking a morning nap after our red-eye flight.We found this spot and the hanging plants on the outside and wood interior made it quite inviting.It was a little on the crowded side for lunch but we got a table. Along with some beers we ordered the following:a Cuban sandwich, a salad, a pizza slice, and a few selections of cheese with bread.We figured they'd bring out the easier-to-prepare items first but we waited a LONG time and nothing came out. Other tables were getting their food and needless to say, we were agitated and hungry.Anyway, I finally spoke with one of the servers and miraculously, the food came out promptly. The server I talked to said they were busy but our server should have asked about bringing out the dishes in the appropriate order.I liked that he apologized for the error but we were left a bit underwhelmed with the food and still upset about the wait.",3.0

"I've only ever come to Rucola at 5:30 on a weekday so it's never been an issue for me grabbing a table. But Rucola is the only restaurant I recommend to people looking for a place to eat in my neighborhood. I have never eaten anything at Rucola that wasn't absolutely delicious. The portions are perfect and the food is tasty and cooked beautifully. I could eat their crudo every meal, every day, for the rest of my life. The olive oil they use is liquid heaven. Speaking of liquid heaven, their servers are chock full of knowledgeable wine recommendations and I've never not had a delicious glass of wine at Rucola. Even their salads are flavorful and delicious, and it takes quite a bit of convincing for me to truly enjoy a salad. I recommend this restaurant to everyone.",5.0
"We came in from out of town for NYE and were directed to Rucola by a friend. It was a great suggestion! The atmosphere was fantastic for a date, a tiny, trendy, hole in the wall in a lovely part of Brooklyn.I hope to eat here again without a pre fixe menu (I'm sure this was a NYE only occurrence). The food was prepared to perfection, but I would have liked to see the chef's creativity more clearly in a full menu.We did leave a little hungry! At the risk of sounding cheap, I think Rucola would do well to increase the portions slightly for a $95 price tag. It just isn't the type of place that can pull off a single ravioli and an ounce of short rib for ""dinner"". Maybe it's the neighborhood...",3.0
"Small menu but it was still hard to make a decision based on the delicious-sounding options. Great wine selection and cozy ambience. Highly recommend the beet salad, roasted cauliflower, and roasted chicken. It was perfect for a chilly, rainy night.",4.0
"A lovely neighborhood restaurant. I have visited 2 times for dinner so far, definitely will go back. Great cocktail, nice service. It can get really busy, I would recommend to avoid prime time, the wait can easily be 40 minutes. For the foods, I was a bit disappointed by a pasta dish  (lagu?) which was painfully salty but other than that one dish everything I tried was very good. I especially liked fish dishes.",4.0
"Perfect for a low key brunch or a delicious dinner. I've tried the short rib ravioli, phenomenal and for brunch the smoked salmon which hit the spot.",4.0
"Food was outstanding, had the sausage rigatoni with crispy polenta. Started with the chef's selection of veggies, meats and cheeses which was also great, the pickled onion was a surprise hit. They also had a reasonably large by the glass wine list and the wait staff seemed to be very knowledgable of everything on there, asked for a couple of recommendations which didn't disappoint! Only criticism is that the service was a little slow but we also weren't ready to order at first so they may have assumed that we wanted to take our time (it was early evening on a Sunday after all).",5.0
"The incredible Rucola team hosted our party of 16 for our wedding dinner in June and we could not have asked for more. It was the perfect end to our wedding day - gorgeous food and wine, intimate setting and lovely and accommodating staff. We eloped from Australia (with a few friends and family in tow) so we chose Rucola based on reviews we saw online and organised the dinner via email. From the very first enquiry email, I knew we'd found the perfect place. Julian and his team were incredibly accommodating in building the perfect wedding day menu and hosting our happy Australian group in their gorgeous space. Our guests adored the restaurant, the food, the wine and everything about the evening. Thank you!",5.0

(so cool that this place is open for breakfast and lunch on the weekdays)  We ordered two cheeses and a salami.  the cheeses were super fresh and the waiter helped us pick cheeses that paired well with the meat.  I especially like the Toma Del Rocca- which was a blended cheese.  Also shared the watercress salad, which was light and refreshing.  Our entrees were the short rib special over spatzle and the rigatoni, both were super flavorful and I especially love homemade pasta, but the short rib was a bit dry .  The price point for this place is just right, and most bottles of wine were 40$ and under.  Overall, this is a cute neighborhood Italian spot that has a friendly knowledgeable staff.  Food is excellent, and reasonably priced. The decor is nice, but it feels really cramped when its a full house, which I think is most of the time.",4.0

GREAT customer service! The menu isn't bad either!Went here for brunch on a Sunday around 1pm. Pretty busy but we didn't have a wait at all. I will say the brunch menu is a bit limited for my taste but I ordered the bacon/egg/cheese sandwich w/ arugula. Not bad! They brew stumptown too -- awesome! The vibe/ambiance is really great and I think this is a great after work/date spot. No doubt a much more extensive menu for dinner.They accept CCs!

Some places hit you with a professionalism that feels kind of cold. I found the staff here to be so warm and welcoming that it felt like home. I seriously wanted to befriend everyone in this place.

"This is probably my favorite restaurant in Boerum Hill.  The menu isn't extensive, but everything I have had there was FANTASTIC.  My husband loves their cocktails, particularly the ""New Rider.""

"This review is way overdue, because we went to Rucola back in November, but luckily I still remember how much we enjoyed brunch! The best part? The sweet potato gratin. I realize that sounds weird - and we weren't sure what to expect, but we could've just gotten 5 of these and eaten them and been happy. The sweet potatoes are cooked perfectly (with tons of butter) and spiced very well. I can't do it justice by describing it, but just know that you should try it. We also got the bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich, with the bacon on the side (because my boyfriend doesn't eat it). The sandwich was very good, but the bacon is definitely the best part :) For the sweet part of the meal, we got the nutella french toast. The portion wasn't as big as I would have liked, but how can you go wrong with nutella french toast? The chopped hazelnuts are a unique touch -- I recommend it!The atmosphere was perfect - and exactly what we expected in Brooklyn :) We sat at the end of a long, communal table.

It reminded me of soft goat cheese, but not as tangy... more mild. Really enjoyed it.Otherwise, we snacked on the melon app, the fried cauliflower, salads, and drinks. All was great!",5.0
"I went here for dinner and it was great! The food was delicious and the service was good. The decor is great, but it is a bit loud. The garganelli was particularly good.",5.0
incredible service ambience and food. the place is on a residential street corner and it is kind of small. however the ambience makes up for it there is always great music playing and the waiters are  really attentive. The desserts are unexpectedly wonderful.,5.0

"Time to add Rucola, a wonderful little restaurant hidden away (but extremely popular) in Brooklyn Heights, to my list of favorite Italian restaurants.The wait for a table was over two hours long but we were lucky and got bar seats much quicker.  To be honest, I preferred the bar over a table - it's a much more intimate experience with the restaurant staff and those you're dining with. Almost everything was notable.  Deliciously marinated mushrooms, thin slices of hot coppa and a surprisingly affordable quartino of very decent red wine (we had the ""Ceregio"" 2011 Sangiovese for $14).The highlight for me were the two pasta entrees.  Shells (Fall squash pureè, broccoli rabe, Pecorino Romano, black pepper, $15) and Tagliatelli (Veal breast ragù, tomato, Grana Padano, $16) both cooked to a perfect al dente and with wonderful, rich, but not overpowering sauce.The Bourbon Pear Crumble ($6) from a famous Brooklyn pie shop called Four & Twenty Blackbirds with a side of whipped cream was an outstanding finish.No question - I'm coming back.",5.0
"Just went here on the recommendation of a nearby store clerk. We both got the slow roasted pork sandwich, which is served with delicious olives on the side. It was perfect. The atmosphere is relaxed and there was so wait at 1pm on a Saturday. Would love to come back here to try dinner.",4.0
"It was a Thursday night around 7pm, a post-hurricane Sandy night, but it was still busy as always, I called ahead to put my name down and it was going to be a 1.5 hour wait. I was happy I could time my arrival accordingly and not have to wait there. Once we arrived there, there was maybe 15 more minutes of a wait but someone constantly kept tabs on us as to when we could expect to be seated. A good start indeed.Immediately when I stepped inside Rucola, I felt at ease. It had a charming rustic atmosphere that I wanted for my future home! We started off with the cheese platter which was pleasant, moist bread, good cheeses. I got the gnoche for my main dish which came with squash, mushrooms and kale. I also wished I had a bit more sitting/breathing/eating room. I like the sauce, it was a white sauce but it wasn't heavy at all. I did wish there was a little bit more of the mushroom and kale however. Plus, complimentary dessert! Delicious chocolate mousse.Overall, superb service and a wonderful atmosphere.",3.0
"3 stars only because I came here on New Years and they were not on their game for the biggest night of the year. Under normal circumstances this is a solid, good restaurant that most people will love. On New Years though when reservation is at 10:30pm and I sit down 30 min later that a negative but they made up for it with our first round of drinks being comped so that was gracious of them.""See they know how to take a reservation but they don't know how to hold the reservation. and thats really the most important part of the reservation. The holding. Anyone can just take them""- Jerry Seinfeld Their 5 course fell short. Croquette to start was very good , in my opinion the best part of the meal. Needed very little to no improvement except that they gave you one which was weak. almost an amuse not a course. 2nd course was a beautiful plating of an octopus dish that would have been great except they have cut the octopus so razor thin you get no texture or flavor from it when its on the plate with the onions and capers. You lose the octo and the main star of the dish is basically lost in a small pool of olive oil.3rd course was black pepper strozzapreti with some black truffles. Someone went ape shit with the black pepper and had everyone! at my table coughing. I made mention to the server about it saying ""I think someone went a little crazy with the black pepper"" she replied""oh really, you can never get to crazy with black pepper"" as she walked away. A friend of mine at the table simply wanted to retaliate by saying""oh you can never go too crazy on a tip"". Had their not been forced gratuity this staff would've gotten stiffed off the industry lunacy of 20%. Again! the servers get the tips not the cooks. The cooks cook all day the servers come in late and all they do is run our the manufactured product that took all day to make and kiss your ass to make you feel good. Yet they make more money producing less and having less talent and skill. Not hard to kiss someone's ass and make them feel good for literally 10-15 min of total social contact in a 1.5 hrs sit. You sat us late, but comped us a around. Poorly paced the meal where the first 3 courses are flying and then its a stand still , not even a crawl for 30 min and then another 20 min after that sitting there. You rush food then slow it way the fuck down. Midnight came and a table of 8 got 6 glasses of champagne. Without anyone coming back to bring the other two until I said something. We even sent a drink back that was not for us, we could have been dicks and taken a drink we never ordered. Told us you would take it off our bill, no shit!4th course was fantastic, roasted venison was great, not one complaint everyone loved it and anyone would and should.5th course , Tiramisu in a cup. Fuck you it sucked! aspire for something more on New Years. come on, this place is so much better than that.Overall, service sucked. For New Years the entire meal wasn't that great. Been here for brunch and dinner both times were great. I would give 4 stars but you sucked ass on New Years when you should've picked up your game. I expected better because I've gotten better. I left there concluding I should have gone elsewhere for dinner and that was the most disappointing thing since I actually like this place.",3.0

"My evening at Rucola was a long time coming. The first time I tried to go there a private event has the whole place blocked off. The second time I tried to go there we were kindly told there was a 2 hour wait. No thanks. The 3rd time we tried to go, there was a 2+ hour wait. Maybe we should have gotten the hint, and stopped trying to go on the weekend. So, on a pleasant Thursday evening we trudged down the hill to Boerum hill, ready for the crowds. Thankfully, there were none. But, this time we were inside! The minute you walk inside it's like you've entered a little oasis of rustic Italian joy. The lighting is perfect, and everyone is just so calm and welcoming, I was entranced.The food was perfection. Everything delicious and fresh, and beautifully presented. Highlights include the house made spaghetti with clams, and the chocolate pudding. but really, i can't pick a favorite item. I just can't wait to go back so I can try more. The drinks were delicious too. Creative cocktails, and an excellent wine and even beer selection. When I was younger my mother used to tell me that you can tell a really good restaurant by their bathroom. And, if I were to only rate Rucola on their bathroom they'd get 5 stars. Why? It was a fantastic bathroom. Painted steel blue, it even smelled nice....and there was plenty of paper towels and soap to go round. Definitely ranks in my top 3 restaurants. I am in love.",5.0
"Venturing out to Brooklyn last week, my wife and I decided to go to Rucola. Upon arriving, we were told that the wait for a table was an hour and a half.

We ordered the meat and cheese plate which was spectacular, my wife ordered a pasta dish which she liked,  and I ordered the dorade for my entree.

"Rucola is a hidden gem in the middle of residential Boerum Hill, and it just sort of emerges from among the brownstones as you walk along Dean St.  You wouldn't know from its exterior, but this place is hopping for brunch, so my boyfriend and I squeezed in between two other brunching couples and quickly made the decision that, yes, we were getting cocktails.I got the Rucola Bloody Mary and was blown away by its veritable punch of flavor and spice.  This is not the kind of bloody mary that you suck down because it tastes like V8 and vodka.  As I kept drinking it, I was impressed that the spice only seemed to build, but never reached painful levels.  My boyfriend got a cocktail that involved Scotch but I can't recall the name, and while he liked it, once he tasted my drink he immediately ordered one for himself as well.  For food, I got the bacon egg and cheese sandwich, boyfriend got the broccoli rabe plate, and we shared the sweet potato gratin.  My sandwich was a standout--it was served on a fluffy roll, with wonderful chewy bacon, 2 fried eggs, some type of cheddar-y cheese, and arugula.  I loved all the flavors together, and just wished that the eggs had been runny.  Maybe you can request that?  The broccoli rabe platter was amazing.  Legit, amazing.  Tender broccoli rabe, tasty beans, an egg with a runny yolk, and a sausage, all mixed together.  It hits all those spots--savory, salty, snappy sausage, and some veggies.  Then the sweet potato gratin was just an explosion of cheesy goodness.  It was a really small little square of this confection, but it was so flavorful it didn't really matter.  If you're in the mood for something healthier, the yogurt and granola that many people were ordering looked delicious and seemed like a decent portion.",4.0
Let me keep this short and sweet. Being in the service industry myself I know how annoying customers can be. I showed up with my sister a few minutes before lunch closed and we couldn't find a restaurant anywhere for an hour. The gracious staff here took our lunch order despite the time and were super friendly!!! They made me want to be a better server / bartender just by the excellent customer service they provided. I hated to be that customer coming in when the kitchen closes but they assured we were no bother !! Amazing food as well good god!!!! Thank you so much!!!!,5.0

"Love the warm rustic vibe. Love the food even more.Started with the Chef's antipasto with cheese and veggies (no meat, no fennel, as they totally catered to our request). Roasted cauliflower was the star of the plate, with a strong supporting cast of 2 delicious cheeses (don't remember which ones), pear jam, roasted beets w/ balsamic, olives, eggplant caponata and warm crusty bread.For entree, we went with Garganelli with tomato-almond pesto, cherry heirloom tomatoes and zucchini--hearty and comforting. Perfectly al dente garganelli tubes were bathed in a slight nuttiness from the pesto, creaminess and a little tang from the tomatoes. Spectacular. Hell, I'd bathe in it too!And when it came to dessert, my friend asked me split one or get two?...  Two, duh! My motto: never skip dessert! She was leaning more chocolate, I was leaning more blueberry. Went with the Chocolate pudding with olive oil sea salt & whipped cream. Rich, deep cocoa flavor with bursts of zing from the flecks of sea salt--this ain't your typical Jell-o pudding! It's amazing, as I love a good sweet & salty combo. And the blueberry almond cake with sea salt and whipped cream was tart, airy, not terribly sweet, nutty, buttery... a good balance of textures and flavors and altogether delicious.Drinks were dangerously refreshing as well and simply elevated our already amazing meal.Simply put, it's places like Rucola that are making me fall in love with Italian.",5.0
Great place to eat and drinks are wonderful. All of the seafood is delightful; I had the whole trout and it was spectacular!  And the complimentary bread-yum.The waitress and the bartender here were so nice too; they seemed genuinely happy to serve you!

"amazing dinner, though i'm surprised how busy it was for a thurs night at 930p. i think it's the proximity to barclay center. anyway, we sat outside as it was a few decibels lower than the indoor dining area. it was a perfect setting. service was amazing. generally, it's hard to get any attn outside esp since there are only two tables, but someone checked up on us at least every 5 min to refill water and to see if we were ok. food was amazing as well. for two, we ordered - crudo of branzino. favorite dish of the night- coppo, finocchiona and sapore del piave. could've passed on the finocchiona but it wasn't terrible, just a lot of fennel. i did like the side of pickled fennels that came w the meats- tagliatelle. i didn't try this but my date said it was delicious, and ate it all. - roasted chicken: well flavored and juicy, though i'm not big on white meatdessert was delicious. chocolate pudding was overly decadent. but, INTERNET THERE WAS PIE. blueberry lavender for the night i was there.overall, an amazing restaurant located on a sleepy street. delicious food, unpretentious atmosphere. god, i love brooklyn.",4.0

And the blueberry almond cake with sea salt and whipped cream was tart, airy, not terribly sweet, nutty, buttery... a good balance of textures and flavors and altogether delicious.Drinks were dangerously refreshing as well and simply elevated our already amazing meal.Simply put, it's places like Rucola that are making me fall in love with Italian.",5.0
Great place to eat and drinks are wonderful. All of the seafood is delightful; I had the whole trout and it was spectacular!  And the complimentary bread-yum.The waitress and the bartender here were so nice too; they seemed genuinely happy to serve you! It's small so call ahead same-day to put your name on the list or grab a drink if there is room at the bar. Our wait for 4 on a sunday night was about 20 minutes.,4.0
"amazing dinner, though i'm surprised how busy it was for a thurs night at 930p. i think it's the proximity to barclay center. anyway, we sat outside as it was a few decibels lower than the indoor dining area. it was a perfect setting. service was amazing. generally, it's hard to get any attn outside esp since there are only two tables, but someone checked up on us at least every 5 min to refill water and to see if we were ok. food was amazing as well. for two, we ordered - crudo of branzino. favorite dish of the night- coppo, finocchiona and sapore del piave. could've passed on the finocchiona but it wasn't terrible, just a lot of fennel. i did like the side of pickled fennels that came w the meats- tagliatelle. i didn't try this but my date said it was delicious, and ate it all. - roasted chicken: well flavored and juicy, though i'm not big on white meatdessert was delicious. chocolate pudding was overly decadent. but, INTERNET THERE WAS PIE. blueberry lavender for the night i was there.overall, an amazing restaurant located on a sleepy street. delicious food, unpretentious atmosphere. god, i love brooklyn.",4.0
"Crowded. A good place to catch up, have a conversation over wine and cheese as the service is slow. Overall they use fresh ingredients, everything was flavorful and well seasoned. The roasted brook trout and crispy polenta were amazing.",4.0
"The food and service here is out of control good.  I have had the experience 2 previous times in my life where I woke up the next morning still blushing over how good the food was the night before and this was my third.  We feasted!

The absolute standouts were the brussels sprouts, short rib, and rigatoni.  Thank you for such a great experience.",5.0

"I've had this place bookmarked for ages so am glad I finally got to try it last night for dinner. Knowing they didn't take reservations, we put our name down on the list and went to the Brooklyn Inn for a drink while we waited for our table. The 45 minute wait was expected for a Friday night at around 8. They called us back about 40 minutes later but when we got there, we were told that our table wasn't actually ready yet because the people were just finishing up dessert. Maybe they didn't expect us to actually come back so promptly, but it was a little annoying. We got seated about 10 minutes later.The restaurant is so charming and cozy with it's tall open windows with indoor planter boxes. The lighting above is made out of what looked like milk bottles that covered the dim yellow light bulbs. I love the dark old weathered fixtures that give the place such character. Our waitress was friendly and great at describing the popular dishes. We started with a bottle of the Montepulciano and a bunch of appetizers: the pickled fennel, the Sapore del Piave cheese, eggplant caponata, roasted carrots and grilled octopus. The big chunks of fennel were lightly pickled, crunchy and refreshing. The waitress described the Sapore del Piave cheese as similar to a cheddar and the best cheese she's ever had in the world - big call, lady. With that statement, I had to try it. When it came out, I thought it was more nutty and hard than a cheddar and while it was delicious, I don't think I'd say it was the best in the world. But could I say that about any cheese? There's just too much good cheese out there. I was a little disappointed to see only three thin slices of the cheese, but I did really like the homemade pear jam it came with.The roasted carrots were served on a bed of black lentils topped with goat cheese. Delicious! Carrots can be one of the most boring things to eat in my opinion but these were great. The grilled octopus was served on some pinto beans and was pretty good, and the eggplant was tasty but not that memorable. For the main, I ordered the roasted chicken. Divine. The skin was crispy and light and the chicken was so juicy and tender. It was served on top of a creamy celery root purée with some sautéed spinach. I certainly ate the entire dish with minimal sharing.When it was time for dessert, our famously upselling waitress recommended the Four & Twenty Blackbirds fig crumble. I had no idea what Four & Twenty Blackbirds was but apparently it's one of the best pie places in Brooklyn, and as a Californian, I love figs so of course I ordered it. It was magical. It tasted like Christmas, and the fresh whipped cream on the side was perfection.Great spot! I'll be back.",5.0

We were recommended the chicken breast which is normally something that never really would catch my eye on a menu but I am so glad we ordered it here...so moist and flavorful!

It was perfect to pairing to the chicken I eventually ordered, along with the beet salad. Very delicious. Granted, not exactly cheap dining, but tough to find in Cobble Hill/Boreum Hill.

It's usually a place I'm happy to have in our neighborhood.But when they fall short, man, do they fall short. They definitely have issues sometimes with staffing sometimes. I remember once spending literally two hours there for breakfast, 1.5 of which were enduring incredibly slow service. Most of the time, a restaurant will comp your coffee or send over side dish or SOMETHING to make up for this, but nope. In terms of personality, I've had experiences here where the staff were the nicest people ever, and experiences where I felt like I was an unwelcome guest in someone's house. It seems to be luck of the draw.One thing that does really get me about them is the almost complete and total lack of options for vegetarians/vegans for many of their meals. I am not saying that you have to provide this, but come on, you're in Brooklyn. The fact that a vegan is stuck literally with bread and jam if they come for breakfast is pretty unfortunate.",3.0

"I have to admit that Rucola is hands-down one of my favorite restaurants in Brooklyn, and not just because it is a block away from my apartment, but because it is consistently delicious! The restaurant itself is very small, and you have to prepare to wait if you plan on getting dinner on a Friday or Saturday night. However, they allow you to call ahead or walk over and put your name on the list and they will call you when you're table is ready. As for appetizers, I strongly suggest the speck alto adige paired with the toma della rocca( the soft, luscious creaminess of the cheese is heavenly and they serve it with a side of cinnamon apples= unreal!) Their homemade focaccia is awesome! I appreciate how fresh all of their food is and that every meal is made to order. Every dish I've had off of their dinner menu has been delicious; however, my favorite has to be the rigatoni. It's understated, yet so fresh and the homemade pasta is to die for! As far as lunch goes, the pork sandwich is the way to go! The only negatives for Rucola are that 1. They no longer serve the sloppy joe which was unreal (I still crave it regularly) and 2. As far as brunch goes, the nutella french toast isn't anything to write home about.  I was actually quite surprised that they served something that I could've easily made at home (toasted wheat bread with nutella smeared in the middle) and a few hazelnuts on top. Overall, definitely worth going to Rucola over and over again!",5.0
"Rucola is, above all, an attractive restaurant..  All brick, and wrought iron, panels and Brooklyn.  Despite that, the food is good too; pretty well priced (very few dishes broke $20) and tasty (I loved that my papardelle with stewed lamb was so understated - just a few chunks of meat, and pasta sauced very lightly with broth and a little tomato).  Dessert was another high point; our rhubarb crumble was very good, although a little too much crumble and not enough rhubarb, while the chocolate pudding with sea salt was, according to my friend, the best he'd ever had. Certainly, we preferred Rucola to Brucie, which it reminds me a lot of. Having said all that, I found the appetizer plate we started with to be almost entirely a waste of space, other than some excellent olives and pickled fennel.  So maybe next time I'll just stick to the pasta.  In any event, a worthy addition to the neighborhood, which I suppose I'm now supposed to call BoCoCa. Be warned; the restaurant is very loud indeed.  I found myself screaming most of the night.",4.0
"We had about 30  minutes to get in and out and they have no problem graciously and  quietly moving the courses through the time we had.The pasta with shrimp, although small shrimp. had a delicious kick to it - the squash dish was perfect, adding green olives for a salty addition - the melon/proscuitto was very nice - bibb salad was fine - fried cauliflower with a hint of lemon was a scrumptious side!",5.0
"Rucola has done an amazing job in establishing an interesting and Brooklyn-appropriate theme inside their quaint space.  A buddy and I arrived for a quick breakfast and were pleased with the delicious coffee (Stumptown maybe?)  I had the broccoli rabe and cheese scramble and was satisfied, buts not won over by the slightly runny eggs, although I liked the combination of eggs and broccoli rabe.  My dining companion had the egg and kale sandwich which I admit, looks better to me than what I was having.  All in all a nice experience with good service.  I'd certainly return for lunch or dinner to try some of their signature dishes.",4.0
"Don't walk. Don't pass go. Don't collect $200. RUN to Rucola. I don't live in the neighborhood. I don't even like Italian food in general, but this little romantic spot in the heart of Boerum Hill is absolutely amazing! From the moment we walked in, we were treated ever so graciously by our host and waitress. Their customer service is impeccable! The ambiance is perfect for a cozy evening out with your family, impressing a few out-of-towners, a much-needed late night dinner with your best friends or a delicious dinner with your love. We tried to order an eclectic mix of everything on the menu. Here are my favorites (mind you, this list includes EVERYTHING we ordered - yes, it's that good): Chef's selection of cheese, meat and vegetable antipasti (if you think it's too much, don't miss out on the pickled fennel - it's to die!), Roasted Carrots salad (so full of flavor - a must), Crispy Brussel Sprouts, Garganelli with short rib ragu (the house-made pastas change, so I apologize if you miss out on this incredible burst of flavor), whole roasted brook trout and the roasted chicken. I honestly don't think there is a single thing on the menu that could disappoint.  We also had a special of chicken liver mousse with kumquat on a crostini which melted in our mouths. You'd think after all of this that we would have no room for dessert, but we couldn't help ourselves. Along with Stumptown coffee and tea, we ordered the Buttermilk Panna Cotta with pear, almond and fennel pollen as well as a slice of almond cake with blood oranges (and salt, oh my!). There are no words to describe how wonderful our experience was at Rucola. I cannot wait to return for brunch!",5.0
"Two & a half in a good way, kind of...Some of the food was very tasty and the technical skill of the kitchen was quite evident with some of the dishes, particularly with the quail and the veal spiedini(however meager), squash roasted with pumpkin seeds, ricotta, and and brown butter, and the Pork shank slow cooked with mustard and cabbage .  None of the dishes were particularly exciting or innovative however and some dishes verged on being downright boring (fusilli with kale and walnut pesto. The antipasti was maybe the only thing that was below average due in large part to a selection of vegetables that left a lot to be desired and a yellowish sauce that verged on offensiveness in both flavor and appearance.        Service is the definition of spotty,  with some of the servers displaying warmth and professionalism, and others demonstrating that particular brand of eye rolling condescension that all too often helps give Brooklyn  a douchy bad name.     The room was very nice, and the place is well served by the quiet classic charm of its location in this mostly residential stretch of Brownstoneland once known as South Brooklyn.The biggest problem with this place is unquestionably the minuscule portion sizes that certainly didn't justify the prices.  $14 for the tiny plate of the above mentioned fusilli, and the two puny skewers, maybe holding two inches of meat with the spiedini are par for the course here.  I don't think I will be rushing back, particularly if I am the one paying.",3.0
"Probably my favorite neighborhood spot for a nice dinner. I love how they are tucked away on a residential block in the heart of Boerum Hill. I've been here several times but recently came with my aunt and uncle on a cold windy night. Rucola really hit the spot. The ambiance is warm and inviting and the staff is friendly and helpful. The wait can get long and since they don't take reservations, come on the early side! Food- we started off with some of the vegetable antipasti, specifically the marinated olives, balsamic roasted beets and eggplant caponata. It all went superbly with the great bread they bring to the table. I don't even like eggplant, but they somehow made it so tasty that even I enjoyed it. For the main I got the sardi- a housemade pasta with butternut squash puree, kale and mushrooms. It was excellent. They have tables for small parties and then they have one long table in the center of the restaurant, good for big groups or just family style seating with strangers. Can't wait to go back again soon.",5.0
"Rucola, welcome to the neighborhood. I walked by so many times as you were getting yourself ready, and now that you're open, I'm just so happy. For both of us. I apologize for not coming by sooner, but my friends are...well, idiots. Each time we decided where to dine, I would float your name, which I'm sorry to say has induced long, drawn out yells (a la the commercials of a cough-drop brand that shall remain nameless). It was enough to make a man not want to suggest you again.But now that we have been in, your name no longer invites cough-drop-related idiocy, but rather visions of the gorgeous ironwork of your exterior, and the rustic, cozy feel of each candlelit table. Your name now brings to mind the lusciously soft focaccia you offer at the outset of every meal, and the perfect bite of the rye cocktail (the name of which slips my mind) and the subtle humor of naming another after Rick Ross. Your name makes my mouth water for the stuffed artichoke appetizer, and the duck bolognese special that made me glad of the night I chose to come in. Perhaps the bolognese was a bit too salty, and the cod entree a bit too bland. There may have been a disconnect in the service, as our waiter clocked out and left as we ate. But you know what? I'm not claiming to be perfect either. So let's be friends. We might as well, because I'm going to be coming around, whether you like it or not.",4.0
"Hidden gem!!! Amazing staff, amazing food amazing ambiance and overall style. Nice place to come with a friend for lunch of dinner. Went with a friend near 6 (fairly slow) so we sat by the window seat, and probably the best seating! The food was great overall moderate servings but don't be fooled as it is enough, ""it's quality not quantity"" trust me! For drinks my friend had root beer no complaints there and my lemonade was perfect! A bit of an orange twist, not too sweet not to sour. We ordered (Rigatoni) and (spaghetti) and we had ZERO complaints as the food is very presentable and delish!! We both agreed to come back and try everything on the menu, for sure with more people. It started to pick up around 7 so if you want to avoid the crowd, come before 7 but people in the area seem pretty nice. Also didn't feel pressured or rushed out, nice and relaxed staff again quality not quantity. Water glass never reached halfway as our waiter was very attentive.",5.0
"Very, very delicious. And thanks to the superbowl, easy for our group of 4 to snag a table. We shared an antipasti plate-which I'd highly recommend. While others ordered mostly pasta items, I went for a combination of veggies and the soup.The soup was good, and the vegetables were amazing. Perhaps one of the best brussels sprout dishes I've tried. I also snagged a few bites of the husband's roasted carrots and thought they were equally delicious. I'm not usually a cooked carrot person, but these were so nicely roasted & seasoned that they tasted more like sweet potatoes than carrot. Yum. Chocolate pudding to end, and we left happy. We'll be back soon!",4.0

"We had about 30  minutes to get in and out and they have no problem graciously and  quietly moving the courses through the time we had.The pasta with shrimp, although small shrimp. had a delicious kick to it - the squash dish was perfect, adding green olives for a salty addition - the melon/proscuitto was very nice - bibb salad was fine - fried cauliflower with a hint of lemon was a scrumptious side!",5.0
"Rucola has done an amazing job in establishing an interesting and Brooklyn-appropriate theme inside their quaint space.  A buddy and I arrived for a quick breakfast and were pleased with the delicious coffee (Stumptown maybe?)  I had the broccoli rabe and cheese scramble and was satisfied, buts not won over by the slightly runny eggs, although I liked the combination of eggs and broccoli rabe.  My dining companion had the egg and kale sandwich which I admit, looks better to me than what I was having.  All in all a nice experience with good service.  I'd certainly return for lunch or dinner to try some of their signature dishes.",4.0
"Don't walk. Don't pass go. Don't collect $200. RUN to Rucola. I don't live in the neighborhood. I don't even like Italian food in general, but this little romantic spot in the heart of Boerum Hill is absolutely amazing! From the moment we walked in, we were treated ever so graciously by our host and waitress. Their customer service is impeccable! The ambiance is perfect for a cozy evening out with your family, impressing a few out-of-towners, a much-needed late night dinner with your best friends or a delicious dinner with your love. We tried to order an eclectic mix of everything on the menu. Here are my favorites (mind you, this list includes EVERYTHING we ordered - yes, it's that good): Chef's selection of cheese, meat and vegetable antipasti (if you think it's too much, don't miss out on the pickled fennel - it's to die!), Roasted Carrots salad (so full of flavor - a must), Crispy Brussel Sprouts, Garganelli with short rib ragu (the house-made pastas change, so I apologize if you miss out on this incredible burst of flavor), whole roasted brook trout and the roasted chicken. I honestly don't think there is a single thing on the menu that could disappoint.  We also had a special of chicken liver mousse with kumquat on a crostini which melted in our mouths. You'd think after all of this that we would have no room for dessert, but we couldn't help ourselves. Along with Stumptown coffee and tea, we ordered the Buttermilk Panna Cotta with pear, almond and fennel pollen as well as a slice of almond cake with blood oranges (and salt, oh my!). There are no words to describe how wonderful our experience was at Rucola. I cannot wait to return for brunch!",5.0
"Two & a half in a good way, kind of...Some of the food was very tasty and the technical skill of the kitchen was quite evident with some of the dishes, particularly with the quail and the veal spiedini(however meager), squash roasted with pumpkin seeds, ricotta, and and brown butter, and the Pork shank slow cooked with mustard and cabbage .  None of the dishes were particularly exciting or innovative however and some dishes verged on being downright boring (fusilli with kale and walnut pesto. The antipasti was maybe the only thing that was below average due in large part to a selection of vegetables that left a lot to be desired and a yellowish sauce that verged on offensiveness in both flavor and appearance.        Service is the definition of spotty,  with some of the servers displaying warmth and professionalism, and others demonstrating that particular brand of eye rolling condescension that all too often helps give Brooklyn  a douchy bad name.     The room was very nice, and the place is well served by the quiet classic charm of its location in this mostly residential stretch of Brownstoneland once known as South Brooklyn.The biggest problem with this place is unquestionably the minuscule portion sizes that certainly didn't justify the prices.  $14 for the tiny plate of the above mentioned fusilli, and the two puny skewers, maybe holding two inches of meat with the spiedini are par for the course here.  I don't think I will be rushing back, particularly if I am the one paying.",3.0
"Probably my favorite neighborhood spot for a nice dinner. I love how they are tucked away on a residential block in the heart of Boerum Hill. I've been here several times but recently came with my aunt and uncle on a cold windy night. Rucola really hit the spot. The ambiance is warm and inviting and the staff is friendly and helpful. The wait can get long and since they don't take reservations, come on the early side! Food- we started off with some of the vegetable antipasti, specifically the marinated olives, balsamic roasted beets and eggplant caponata. It all went superbly with the great bread they bring to the table. I don't even like eggplant, but they somehow made it so tasty that even I enjoyed it. For the main I got the sardi- a housemade pasta with butternut squash puree, kale and mushrooms. It was excellent. They have tables for small parties and then they have one long table in the center of the restaurant, good for big groups or just family style seating with strangers. Can't wait to go back again soon.",5.0
"Rucola, welcome to the neighborhood. I walked by so many times as you were getting yourself ready, and now that you're open, I'm just so happy. For both of us. I apologize for not coming by sooner, but my friends are...well, idiots. Each time we decided where to dine, I would float your name, which I'm sorry to say has induced long, drawn out yells (a la the commercials of a cough-drop brand that shall remain nameless). It was enough to make a man not want to suggest you again.But now that we have been in, your name no longer invites cough-drop-related idiocy, but rather visions of the gorgeous ironwork of your exterior, and the rustic, cozy feel of each candlelit table. Your name now brings to mind the lusciously soft focaccia you offer at the outset of every meal, and the perfect bite of the rye cocktail (the name of which slips my mind) and the subtle humor of naming another after Rick Ross. Your name makes my mouth water for the stuffed artichoke appetizer, and the duck bolognese special that made me glad of the night I chose to come in. Perhaps the bolognese was a bit too salty, and the cod entree a bit too bland. There may have been a disconnect in the service, as our waiter clocked out and left as we ate. But you know what? I'm not claiming to be perfect either. So let's be friends. We might as well, because I'm going to be coming around, whether you like it or not.",4.0
"Hidden gem!!! Amazing staff, amazing food amazing ambiance and overall style. Nice place to come with a friend for lunch of dinner. Went with a friend near 6 (fairly slow) so we sat by the window seat, and probably the best seating! The food was great overall moderate servings but don't be fooled as it is enough, ""it's quality not quantity"" trust me! For drinks my friend had root beer no complaints there and my lemonade was perfect! A bit of an orange twist, not too sweet not to sour. We ordered (Rigatoni) and (spaghetti) and we had ZERO complaints as the food is very presentable and delish!! We both agreed to come back and try everything on the menu, for sure with more people. It started to pick up around 7 so if you want to avoid the crowd, come before 7 but people in the area seem pretty nice. Also didn't feel pressured or rushed out, nice and relaxed staff again quality not quantity. Water glass never reached halfway as our waiter was very attentive.",5.0
"Very, very delicious. And thanks to the superbowl, easy for our group of 4 to snag a table. We shared an antipasti plate-which I'd highly recommend. While others ordered mostly pasta items, I went for a combination of veggies and the soup.The soup was good, and the vegetables were amazing. Perhaps one of the best brussels sprout dishes I've tried. I also snagged a few bites of the husband's roasted carrots and thought they were equally delicious. I'm not usually a cooked carrot person, but these were so nicely roasted & seasoned that they tasted more like sweet potatoes than carrot. Yum. Chocolate pudding to end, and we left happy. We'll be back soon!",4.0

"Wow - helloooo adorable date spot! Well off the worn path of Smith Street, I actually visited here with a couple girlfriends.  I had called ahead to put my name on the wait list which is not the same thing as having a reservation FYI (those are only available for parties larger than 5) and the manager called me when my table was available - we only waited about 10/15 minutes.  I tried the pasta special of the evening which I found to be just meh but my girlfriends had the spaghetti and roasted chicken dishes and loved them. Their bread is pretty outstanding as is the antipasti. Outside seating is minimal but the restaurant itself is very warm and inviting, and the restrooms are actually something to write home about - super clean, roomy and pleasantly scented by candlelight. Would love to go back for a romantic date night or to try the brunch.",4.0
I went here for my birthday dinner last week and I was really blown away. I heard great things about this restaurant and it exceeded my expectations. The atmosphere is lovely and the food was outstanding. I really enjoyed the fusilli (the homemade pasta is amazing)and the Dorade was really tender and creatively prepared. Best of all was the exceptional customer service. We were given free Prosecco because my partner let the waiter know it was my birthday and they didn't charge us for our dessert - a divine dark chocolate pudding. Thanks for making my birthday so delicious!,5.0
"I think this might be our new favorite place.  Went there on Sunday and met there with friends who had been there or a while, just having cocktails and beers waiting for the kitchen to open.  The staff was very attentive and accommodating and I really enjoyed the rustic decor.The cocktails were delicious and we ordered some food to share.  Twice we ordered the Chef's Selection (yes, it was that good!) and it was different each time, and delicious both times. Loved the olives and the beets and the cheeses went really well with my Rose (and my friends' cocktails).  We also ordered the two pasta dishes which were outstanding.It got really crowded just after the kitchen opened, so I can see that there might be a wait and I would say it was a bit loud.",5.0
"We arrived early on a Saturday night, at 5:15 pm before the kitchen opened at 5:30 pm and the waiter gave us a choice of tables and let us know we could order drinks. We ordered drinks, yummy cocktails, and then he came with great bread & oil and took our order even though the kitchen wasn't officially open. We got the arugula salad - great flavor, very fresh, and the rigatoni with meat sauce, and the roast chicken main dish. Everything was excellent! Service was a 10. Did not feel rushed. The place fills up very fast and by the time we left at 6:30 pm it was packed and people were waiting outside. Also, its way too small inside to wait at the bar for your table. The whole bar was full with people eating. So if you have to wait they usually tell you to wait outside or they will text you if you go to another bar to drink or wait.",5.0
"Perfect in every way! Beautiful residential location. Cute decor. Friendly and efficient service. Ridiculously reasonable prices. And oh, the food...! I went with a group of 6. I had the roasted carrots. Delicious and different. Several of us had the risotto special...red wine, sausage and treviso raddicchio. One of the most delicious and perfectly prepared risotti i've ever had. We were all swooning. Every bite had a slightly different flavor...lemon, thyme, fennel, sausage, etc...We all tasted each other's dishes and all were superb. Servings seemed a bit small, but we were full by the end of dessert...which was also delicious. A black-bottom oat pie...oh, alright, I confess...I had 2 desserts...shared the chocolate pudding with olive oil and salt. Very different and delicious. This might be my new favorite place. Can't wait to return!",5.0
"Here's one of those times I schlepped out to Brooklyn and forgot to complain about it!So, my co-worker and lady friend Ricca was having a birthday party. She lives in Brooklyn, is very VERY pro-Brooklyn, and this was a constant drain on our friendship. But since it was her birthday, and since my other co-worker and lady friend Jill R. sent me special e-mails just to make sure moi would be attendance, how could I say no? Well, I guess by opening my mouth and making that one consonant sound that forms the word, but I decided to acquiesce, suck it up, and take one for the team.This place was cute. Dark, intimate... things I like in a place where I ultimately spend my evening. But it was loud. Loud as in, you cannot here what the person next to you is saying unless they are screaming on the inside of your earhole. I'm getting a migraine just thinking about it. I know I complain about loud places a lot, but this place... ugh. It was one of the top 5 worst.The food was good, but the weird style of ""everyone take whatever you want"" was a little haphazard. As was the bill when that finally came. As were cocktail orders that took a little bit too long to come in. I think this place might be fine - good even - if it was for lunch or a weekday evening they weren't getting slammed with 50 people, but the night I went? I didn't really have a good dinner.Might try this place again, but not any time soon.",3.0

"Food was very good--we had the pork sandwich and the pizza of the day.

No one ever checked in to ask how our food was; the greeting and overall interactions were cold and unwelcoming. Moreover, the waiter brought our check before we asked for it, and didn't ask if we wanted anything else. Ironically, we were hoping to order coffee and dessert, but that put us out of the mood. N.B.: the place was half empty, so it wasn't as if the server was too busy to check in, nor had we camped out there for hours, wearing out our welcome.On the fence about going back, since there is no shortage of good choices (Bldg on Bond, Ganso, etc.) nearby.",3.0
"So I returned to Rucola, with super high expectations after my first trip here. The food was still very good, however not as fantastic as last time. (I'd give it 3.75 stars this time, versus 5 last time.) I ordered several vegetable antipasti dishes: beets, fennel, fried cauliflower, and the slow roasted parsnips to share. For my entree, I went for the brook trout, again. The vegetables for the most part were excellent (especially the cauliflower). However, everyone at my table was in agreement that the parsnips were over salted. This was disappointing as they would have been incredible had they not had such a heavy hand with the sea salt. I had a bite of the Sardi pasta again, which was as good as i'd remembered. The texture was just impeccable. As for the brook trout, not as much attention was paid to it as last time, it seemed. The thinly shaved garlic did not garnish the lemon slices this time. The biggest disappointment was that the texture of the bottom half of the trout was a bit mushy. Perhaps it was just frozen from the night before, as It was a Sunday evening. For dessert, we ordered the Four & Twenty Blackbirds pie of the day: a chocolate, oat, and pecan pie. Crispy oatmeal was on top of a layer of chewy, sweet pecans. Beneath the pecans was a small layer of chocolate ganache. This was served with some of the best whipped cream i've ever tried. The pie was reminiscent of a freshly baked, chewy, chocolate chip oatmeal cookie. So good. I will be back to Rucola again, though probably not on a Sunday. Hopefully if will be more consistent on the busier nights, as I was super excited after my initial visit, having found my new favorite restaurant in the neighborhood.UPDATE: I've returned to Rucola several times and have had nothing but great experiences since. Also, i've got to mention they have an awesome wine selection,, and the New Rider was one of the best drinks i've ever had!",5.0

"I was blown away by my experience here on Saturday night. My sister had coordinated with the managers to have them host our party of 10 for a pre-fixe birthday/wedding shower dinner. Half an hour prior to our reservation, we called to ask if they would be able to accommodate an additional 5-6 people. They let us know that the kitchen was prepared for only 10, but that they would do what they could to accommodate the additional guests.The food was excellent. I especially loved the pesto pasta, the impossibly moist roast chicken--I normally find chicken excruciatingly boring--, and the crazy bold chocolate pudding. DELICIOUS. I didn't even get to try a bite of the fluke because it was such a favorite at the table. The arugula salad w/ radish and the farro salad, however, were lacking in flavor. The staff who tolerated our noise, requests, filled-past-capacity-with barbarians row of tables were super patient, efficient, and effective.Most of our guests aren't from Brooklyn and are huge gastrosnobs, so I was a bit nervous to have them try a local restaurant I had never been to. Rucola certainly did not disappoint or embarrass us. Everything from the ambience, to service, to the unending circulation of food was perfectly balanced and executed. If anyone needs a place to host a large group, Rucola is the place. I'n my experience, prix fixe bday dinners are a guaranteed disappointment: there's never enough food and booze, the service is shoddy, and the bill way too large. That is absolutely not the case at Rucola.My fiance and I will definitely be back soon. Thank you so much for the fantastic dinner!",5.0

"Rucola is a favorite of my girlfriend and me.  The menu is fantastic, the atmosphere can't be beat, and the wine list is reasonably priced.  We just went back to Rucola for our anniversary, and the folks at the restaurant made us feel very special.  We venture out from Manhattan for this, and it's definitely worth the trip.",4.0
"This is what I have to say 'bout Boerum Hill newcomer Rucola.I am super happy to have it in the neighborhood. It's exactly what we needed.Everyone that works there is outrageously friendly. Which stands out to me, especially given the hipster pedigree.The place is gorgeous. Sure, it's small, and a little loud. Who cares? The wine list is full of serious bargains, and the cocktail list is not messing around either.The food isn't quite there yet, but nothing was off to the point of mentioning it. I just think they haven't hit their stride in the kitchen, but I fully expect they will. Can't wait to see what they do for breakfast.",5.0
"I was blown away by my experience here on Saturday night. My sister had coordinated with the managers to have them host our party of 10 for a pre-fixe birthday/wedding shower dinner. Half an hour prior to our reservation, we called to ask if they would be able to accommodate an additional 5-6 people. They let us know that the kitchen was prepared for only 10, but that they would do what they could to accommodate the additional guests.The food was excellent. I especially loved the pesto pasta, the impossibly moist roast chicken--I normally find chicken excruciatingly boring--, and the crazy bold chocolate pudding. DELICIOUS. I didn't even get to try a bite of the fluke because it was such a favorite at the table. The arugula salad w/ radish and the farro salad, however, were lacking in flavor. The staff who tolerated our noise, requests, filled-past-capacity-with barbarians row of tables were super patient, efficient, and effective.Most of our guests aren't from Brooklyn and are huge gastrosnobs, so I was a bit nervous to have them try a local restaurant I had never been to. Rucola certainly did not disappoint or embarrass us. Everything from the ambience, to service, to the unending circulation of food was perfectly balanced and executed. If anyone needs a place to host a large group, Rucola is the place. I'n my experience, prix fixe bday dinners are a guaranteed disappointment: there's never enough food and booze, the service is shoddy, and the bill way too large. That is absolutely not the case at Rucola.My fiance and I will definitely be back soon. Thank you so much for the fantastic dinner!",5.0
"Ate here a few weeks agoi gotta say it was pretty damn good.the bronzino with olives was off the meat rackthey also got a great beer selection.only reason their getting a 4 is cause the service sucked that day, and my friend didn't get his bronzino he got the other fish instead cause the waiter wasnt paying attention. by the time he got his branzino he was too pissed off to eat cause i was already done with mine lol",4.0

The dinner was very good- I had an excellent grilled trout and my wife had perfectly done chicken.  For whatever reason we had the impression going in that Rucola was an Italian restaurant- the name threw us I guess.  But they seemed to be majoring in New American, with a minor in Italian.. never the less, we enjoyed it very much and would recommend.",4.0
Very cute place. Very good drinks. Really nice menu - very veggie friendly - lots of options at reasonable price points... and BEST OF ALL... they will seat you until midnight. Which is amazing. Arrived with 3 friends at 11.15pm and we left happy and sated.Late night date spot!,4.0
"The food and the drinks here are always delicious. Clean, highbrow, complex cocktails, and warming, hearty food. Even the asapragus is good.

In the dozens of times I've eaten there, I've found them to be pretty cold. There are a couple of male waiters that will smile back at you or share a kind casual word, but all in all they are concerned with getting your order, capable of answering any and all questions about food and drink with expertise, and only going to have conversations with their colleagues.I once saw a waiter eating the chocolate mousse from a shot glass in the back of the bar and told him it looked pretty tasty. He blushed and joked about being ravenous, then exclaimed about all the great ingredients with true sincere joy. I felt like I'd won a big prize and/or seen a unicorn.I've learned to not take out of towners here because of the indifferent service, but NYers know the deal, and I love taking city types to the beautiful yummy spot.",4.0

"I visited Rucola last week for dinner. It's definitely the kind of place where you can expect a long wait, but we happened to walk in an hour early for our reservation and a table was opening up. Sweet!We ordered the chef's selection of antipasta, crudo, and the roasted chicken entree and drinks. Both the antipasta sampler and the crudo were amazing. The chicken was incredibly tender and meshed well with the sauteed spinach and celeriac potatoes. In short, dinner was exceptional.

Still, the roast chicken is delicious, and my mom liked her fish. The pasta is a skip, in my opinion. The waitress told my dad the squash pasta was pretty light, but the sauce turned out to be just the opposite, and he wasn't thrilled. The place is wildly loud. They don't do reservations, but you can do same-day call-aheads. Overall, I like rucola, but wouldn't go back too often.",4.0

"I had brunch at Rucola amongst several Brooklynites sharing a long cafeteria style table. They definitely pack you into this place. Sitting right next me was a woman holding a newborn baby boy. He was adorable and didn't cry, so I was happy to be in the presence of him. Normally I steer clear of restaurants where I'm forced to dine so closely with anyone under the age of 10. I ordered a risotto patty with a fried egg and béchamel sauce, on a bed a arugula. It was enjoyable, albeit very small for the price I paid. Their coffee is also a bit pricey since you don't get free refills, but our server was a delightful young man who gave us free refills anyway simply because we asked about it. Rucola has a beautiful decor, and is located off the beaten path of Smith Street, which is nice. I'd like to come back and try their dinner or have a drink at the bar. The staff is friendly and welcoming at this restaurant, and good service is always a reason to come back at least one more time.  Helpful tip: you can call ahead of time during brunch and put your name on the list.",3.0

"I've been to Rucola twice now. I hope Building on Bond knows it has some serious competition - competition that is blowing their stale menu out of the water. Since I first went to Rucola a few weeks ago, they've already changed up their menu. The Bloody Mary's aren't cheap, but the mix is good and I love pickled fennel so I'll gladly part with $10 or maybe even $20 for that pleasure. The last time we went, my husband and split a pork sandwich and ordered all of the sides - polenta, Brussels sprouts, and pancetta. It was the perfect amount of food and everything was delicious. We spend around $65 (including tip) for three cocktails, one entree, and three sides. The ambiance is really nice at Rucola. It's a quiet block and the decor is the ever-popular rustic mix of old wood, aged metal, and handblown glass. It's very charming and unpretentious.

I had the Brook Trout, which was a whole fish with olives, lemon, and Parsley (I think?).  It was quite good even though I don't like Olives...My favorite dish though was the Fairy Tale Eggplant.  Crisp, with capers on top, and the most delicious eggplant dish I've ever had.  Def a try!",5.0

"Horrible and slow service, food is nothing special. I came here for lunch on a Monday at about 2pm.  The restaurant was nearly full, but we got a table almost immediately.  Inside the decor is really pleasant and low-key and I had high-hopes for the food. On the waiter's recommendation, I ordered the Fried Mortadella sandwich and a lentil soup.  My dining partner ordered another sandwich.  Should be quick, right?We waited over an hour for a bowl of soup, during which our waiter never came back to check on us or explain why it was taking so long.  When he finally arrived with the soup, he told us ""Your sandwiches should be right up.""  The soup tasted like something that I make at home, not anything special or particularly delicious.  After another 45 minutes, our sandwiches arrived.  That's right --- an hour and 45 minutes for two sandwiches.  NO EXPLANATION.  The house recommended Fried Mortadella sandwich came on a SUPER DRY BODEGA BUN.  Seriously, I've would have gotten a better deal by going to the bodega down the street and getting an egg on a roll.  Inside the sandwich, they slapped in a few slices of Mortadella and a small egg.  It was so dry, it was like eating a sponge. Did I forget to mention that no one refilled our bottle of table water?  And our waiter had disappeared for the rest of the afternoon? And no one on the waitstaff would even look me in the eye?Seriously Rucola, get your act together.  If you run out of soup, let your customers know.  If you ran out of bread, don't run down to the bodega and get day-old buns and then toast them without any butter and try to pass them off as a $9 sandwich.  I would have been fine with a different dish, but this kind of service beyond the pale.  If you can't get your act together for making soup and sandwiches, I shudder to think what the dinner service is like.",1.0

I think I am in love... I absolutely adore this place and would most def come back to try the rest of the menu. Tried the chef's selection (I know nothing special) but it was huge! There was 2 of us and it filled us up pretty good and we sort of regreted ordering another app + entree but it was worth stuffing ourselves full. Tried the veal speidini and it was delicious with the Rigatoni and parsnip side. My favorite would be the parsnip just because I loved parsnips... the Rigatoni was a bit too buttery but had a smooth texture that melted away in your mouth. Sadly did not get to try dessert as we were too full... I love the ceiling!,4.0

"The first time I got here, my dining companions and I all decided that they needed to get their Front of House act together.  The second time I came here, my boyfriend and I had a 45 minute wait and then were squeezed like sardines into the long middle table.  The third time I came here, we came right when they opened, as our friends brought their baby girl.Third time is the charm.  Although, since we got there right when they opened there weren't many other diners for the waitstaff to service.Overall, the food is good. Pastas are yummy in particular.  And they have a solid duck dish.  In the three times I went, over a span of the summer, their menu didn't change, which was disappointing, especially as their website had said their menu changed weekly.  However, the clientele, in my opinion, isn't of your Boerum Hill muster.  (Do I sniff a Manhattanite?).  Everyone just seemed really bougie for no reason.  But, I've been there three times so what does that say about me?Also, I think they're trying to cram too may people in the restaurant at dinner.  It's WAY too loud and very cramped when you need to get up.Every time I come here, I tell myself I shouldn't bother with coming again.  Who knows if I will make a fourth?",3.0

One of the few times that my girlfriend ordered better than I did. Overall this is a great restaurant but I highly recommend getting there around 6:30 just to make sure you get a table.

I think I am in love... I absolutely adore this place and would most def come back to try the rest of the menu. Tried the chef's selection (I know nothing special) but it was huge! There was 2 of us and it filled us up pretty good and we sort of regreted ordering another app + entree but it was worth stuffing ourselves full. Tried the veal speidini and it was delicious with the Rigatoni and parsnip side. My favorite would be the parsnip just because I loved parsnips... the Rigatoni was a bit too buttery but had a smooth texture that melted away in your mouth. Sadly did not get to try dessert as we were too full... I love the ceiling!,4.0
this place is perfect and we ordered half the menu so i'm fairly certain that nothing will disappoint.  Terrific service that will make you feel at home and insanely good food.,5.0
"The first time I got here, my dining companions and I all decided that they needed to get their Front of House act together.  The second time I came here, my boyfriend and I had a 45 minute wait and then were squeezed like sardines into the long middle table.  The third time I came here, we came right when they opened, as our friends brought their baby girl.Third time is the charm.  Although, since we got there right when they opened there weren't many other diners for the waitstaff to service.Overall, the food is good. Pastas are yummy in particular.  And they have a solid duck dish.  In the three times I went, over a span of the summer, their menu didn't change, which was disappointing, especially as their website had said their menu changed weekly.  However, the clientele, in my opinion, isn't of your Boerum Hill muster.  (Do I sniff a Manhattanite?).  Everyone just seemed really bougie for no reason.  But, I've been there three times so what does that say about me?Also, I think they're trying to cram too may people in the restaurant at dinner.  It's WAY too loud and very cramped when you need to get up.Every time I come here, I tell myself I shouldn't bother with coming again.  Who knows if I will make a fourth?",3.0
My family and I were in Brooklyn for the day and decided to have lunch here. We were pleasantly surprised with the simple menu and the friendly staff. The pricing was very reasonable in my opinion and the food was delicious.,5.0
"Bah ! That's what I said walking out of this place, after spending $ 60 ( we were two people) ... and eating almost nothing! (and drinking only water!)Portions are ridiculously SMALL, and you pay for a full size!Food is nothing special, sandwiches seemed decent ... but if I want a sandwich maybe I'll just go to a deli !Decor of the place is the only reason why I think they get so many clients...place looks cool. Service was slow and not the best in general.I was so DISAPPOINTED ... especially considering that I wanted to go to Rucola for so long!",2.0
"My wife and I live half a block and spotted this place when they were working on it!To tell the truth our first visit wasn't totally satisfying. The staff was super friendly, but the food... But from our second visit this place has definitely became our favorite restaurant in the area! not only the waitress remembered our names (I was stunned! and I'm sorry I can't recall hers...) but the food improved so dramatically. My wife loves the sea bass, and I can't resist the duck breast, whichever way they decide to present it! Very cozy, great for dating your loved one. Check out the bomboloni in the breakfast hours too!",5.0
"Had a great dinner here. Appetizers/mains were excellent, the dessert sure hit a spot. Good atmosphere, our server and the host was great and very good about the wait time/list.  Between the 4 of us we ordered the trout, skate, pork loin & chicken. All amazing. Desserts we got the blueberry almond cake (my fav), choc cream & apple pie - all done really well. I don't live in the neighborhood but I'm definitely coming back.",4.0
"I've been wanting to try Rucola for awhile and when we called and they said there was no wait, we finally went for it. We ate on al fresco and the whole thing was pretty damn nice. We started with the roasted carrot salad (pretty incredible) and the chicken liver/foie gras (suck it California). I had the petite filet and my girlfriend had the spaghetti. One of the few times that my girlfriend ordered better than I did. Overall this is a great restaurant but I highly recommend getting there around 6:30 just to make sure you get a table. Saturday nights are busy (really busy) so get there early and enjoy...",4.0

"We went 2 weeks ago. Granted, the restaurant is new and probably has some kinks to work out. But... service was sloppy and the food was mediocre. I got the roasted chicken and while the veggies were nice, the chicken was SUPER dry. Disappointing but not horrible. The really unfortunate part of the meal was the part I was most excited for: the stuffed artichoke appetizer. It looked great when it arrived (25 minutes after we ordered it) but when we tasted it, we both made faces. It tasted... bad. Like spoiled. Not good. Gross, in fact. It didn't taste right. It was strange. My boyfriend's meal was more normal - he got fish cheeks or something like that. His cocktail was good too. We waited over 30 minutes between appetizer and main course. No wonder my chicken was dried out by the time it arrived! Rucola is 3 blocks away from our apartment so I'm sure we'll try it again. But we're certainly not rushing out to eat there. Side note- we did see both Emily Mortimer and Michelle Williams there that night. Either Rucola is a hip little spot or everyone who lives in my neighborhood is just so thrilled to have another option for dinner that isn't Building on Bond or Jolie.",3.0

As we hit the bricks, she continued, ""I'd like some good food made from fresh, local vegetables.""Now by this she could have meant ""let's go to the greenmarket and buy stuff for you to cook"" but I was still feeling a bit under the weather from the night before, so I thought frantically and recalled hearing about Rucola because of their proposed a la carte CSA thingy. I had signed up for the email list but only received 3 emails from then indicating that they had items (but they all sounded good: garlic scapes, heirloom beets, and baby lettuces. If only either of us liked beets). Anyway, we walked in to Rucola at 3:45 on a Saturday afternoon. The block was pristine, and the same atmosphere carried over into the restaurant. The place felt both sleek and comfy, attributes that don't often coexist. There was only one other occupied table inside, though four other parties arrived over the course of the meal and the tiny outdoor tables (which were taken when we arrived) turned over as well. But what I really wanted to relate to you was the smell. When we walked in, it smelled so intoxicatingly good that I knew right away we'd hit paydirt. We had eggplant caponataescarole salada slice of the pizza of the day (capers, mozz, sauce, hot peppers)a slice of the seasonal frittata (cippolini, piave, zucchini) mimosaglass of roseespressodrip coffeeThe eggplant was great. If I'm not mistaken it had capers, pine nuts, mint, and a little sundried tomato. When my mom makes it she puts in celery and I don't think she uses mint. Usually my mom's methods form my preference, but I think Rucola's version was better. The foccacia that came with it was solid but not spectacular (could have been better if it was warm and a little crispy on the edges). The pizza was also great. The sauce was from cherry tomatoes I believe they said, and it was intensely sweet and flavorful. The cheese was applied sparingly but tasted excellent, and the peppers were even more sparing, which was good because a little went a long way. The escarole was extra fresh and the crutons it came with were nice. The rose, recommended by the server (a friendly blonde lady named Jess [ica?] I belive) was more than sufficient. I thought the frittata was slightly bland, but my wife loved it. The espresso was great, though tiny. This gets five stars because of (1) the high quality of the food and ingredients, (2) the extremely reasonable prices, (3) the seeming intent behind it (emblematized by the CSA idea and the local ingredients, and (4) the virally charming overall atmosphere, including the service and decor.",5.0

"We went 2 weeks ago. Granted, the restaurant is new and probably has some kinks to work out. But... service was sloppy and the food was mediocre. I got the roasted chicken and while the veggies were nice, the chicken was SUPER dry. Disappointing but not horrible. The really unfortunate part of the meal was the part I was most excited for: the stuffed artichoke appetizer. It looked great when it arrived (25 minutes after we ordered it) but when we tasted it, we both made faces. It tasted... bad. Like spoiled. Not good. Gross, in fact. It didn't taste right. It was strange. My boyfriend's meal was more normal - he got fish cheeks or something like that. His cocktail was good too. We waited over 30 minutes between appetizer and main course. No wonder my chicken was dried out by the time it arrived! Rucola is 3 blocks away from our apartment so I'm sure we'll try it again. But we're certainly not rushing out to eat there. Side note- we did see both Emily Mortimer and Michelle Williams there that night. Either Rucola is a hip little spot or everyone who lives in my neighborhood is just so thrilled to have another option for dinner that isn't Building on Bond or Jolie.",3.0

"There is nothing more exciting in my book than finding the perfect restaurant half a block from your apartment - and lucky us, Rucola is right on the corner! I have been anxiously watching as the restaurant came into being and waited for the perfect night to try it out. We went on a Friday night and it was super packed. No problem, the super nice guy who greeted us took our name and cell number and called us when our table was ready - perfect! First bit of excitement was the intriguing cocktail list - rye with sage? Yes please! We tried 4 different cocktails and all were really unique and tasty. For apps we had the stuffed artichoke and asparagus with shredded egg. Enjoyed both a lot, but not as much as our mains - soft shell crab with pancetta and peas and a delightful lamb special with fresh greens. All was very flavorful, seasonal and fresh! If it couldn't get better... Then there was dessert: some of the best tiramisu I have ever had. A very generous slice with great flavor and not overly sweet! The service was really friendly even though they were very busy. The only negative is the space is a bit small for how popular Rucola already is proving to be!",5.0

Seems like a neighborhood bar, the guy beside me was talking to staff and diners alike who all lived around the area!Friend came, we were sat promptly...host made sure to check in with us even though we had to wait 15 mins or so. I had that ear-shaped pasta with salt cod and broccoli rabe...LOVED it. I polished it off...was about to lick my plate. The broccoli rabe was amazing...not bitter at all. The salt cod was..interesting, wasn't too salty or overwhelming. Only complaint: TOO LITTLE (well, I am greedy so...) My gf had the baked pasta with cheese...same thing, amazingness in too little a portion.

My wife started with the leek soup and I had the Olives and a cheese plate. We shared a bottle of wine that was recommended by the waitress and it was a home run. For our mains we both had Rigatoni and again, so good. Delicious. For desert we had a salted caramel apple pie which rivaled the best. This place is terrific and a must go.

"Rucola certainly has a charming interior and is located on an equally charming block of brownstones. There are ups and downs with this place for sure, but I waver more on the positive side than the negative - Probably between 3.5 and 4 stars.I think it's lovely when it's not too packed and the pastas are usually very well executed and tasty. The cocktails are also quite good, though perhaps not at the level of some of Clover Club's better mixes. The downsides probably come alongside their popularity. I appreciate that they let you leave your phone number and suggest you get a drink around the block at the Brooklyn Inn, or you can go for a stroll and know that they will indeed call you and seat you once you get there. However when it is packed (and it often is, any day of the week), service does get slow and sometimes the food suffers. I hadn't noticed it so much at dinner, but brunch was cheek to jowl and the rigatoni was overcooked. Poached eggs with tomato and parmesan and toast tasted eerily like the rigatoni, or some kind of breakfast pizza. And though we weren't chomping at the bit to eat, the wait for our food was rather larger than the portion size. We even ordered the homemade bread with butter and jam (be warned that this is actually two pieces of toast with the jam already spread - reasonably tasty, I like jam that's not too sweet), but it came at the end of our extensive wait, a split second before our food. It would've been a nice filler with our coffee.I don't harbor any bad feelings for them though because they aren't a bunch of @$$holes, and I think they're still trying to get their legs under them in the course of their surging popularity.

"Who knew that Boerum Hill was such a happening place!  The energy at  Rucola is palpably youthful and enthusiastic.  Located in an historic building in Boerum Hill, the decor is homey and warm with lots of wood adding to its charm.  There are two large farm tables as well as regular tables and bar seating.  When we got there, the regular tables were all full, so my two companions and I opted for the farm table, something that I was initially somewhat ambivalent about, but wound up feeling like part of the two groups of young people (under 40) that were sitting next to us.  One would think that a menu with only four main entrees would be sparse.  In reality, the opposite is true.  With its choice of appetizers, cheese, meat, and vegetable platters, sides, and pasta, there is actually a great amount of choice both in foods and in eating styles (i.e. tapas, full meal, vegetarian).  The young women next to us opted for a selection of appetizers and sides, while my party opted for a more traditional meal, eager to taste the main courses.We were offered drinks just a little while after being given our drink and regular menus and we passed on the interesting-looking cocktails in favor of less adventurous beer, wine, and plain vodka and soda with lime.  The bar (and the restaurant itself) was full, and while we waited perhaps a little longer for our drinks than we anticipated, the people-watching made the wait more than tolerable.  Our appetizers came soon after our drinks.  The market squash salad was tops, and went well with our meat platter (Italian meats) which was quite generous.Our dinner choices were LI monkfish, Chatham cod, and duck breast.  All were cooked perfectly--i.e. the duck was rare but not too rare and both fish dishes were moist and appropriately flakey.  The flavors and textures were magnificent!  The LI monkfish was served on a bed of Farro (a wonderful grain) ,carrots and capers, and was well presented with thin slices of squash running across the top.  The Chatham Cod was accompanied with mussels, on a bed of chickpeas, and tomatoes, and was simple and delicious.  The duck was exquisitely and subtly flavored with just the right amount of cherries, and rounded out with swiss chard and pieces of turnip. The portions were quite appropriate.We shared the chocolate torte for dessert.  It was the perfect finish to a great meal, especially with the hazelnut brittle and whipped cream which accompanied it.A caveat to the old and grouchy:  If you don't like the enthusiasm and energy of the younger generation this is not the place for you.  The restaurant is noisy when crowded.  Also, the food is extremely fresh and cooked to order, and therefore wait tmes are appropriate to fine dining.However, if you're old (our party were all over sixty) and love to be infused with the energy of the young while enjoying fantastic food, put on your sneaks and run to this place!By the way, the prices are really reasonable and below what you would pay for an equivalent meal on Fifth Avenue in Park Slope.",5.0

"I've been here several times but have never reviewed before, and I had such an amazing experience last night I thought it was high time I yelp'ed for this place.  I used to get frustrated at the long waits (and the waits can be very long!) but since we were planning a big group, we were able to get reservations easily.  We had a birthday dinner with 12 friends last night and and it went off like clockwork.  We emailed with Aiden to confirm details and even changed the head count a few times--he responded quickly and always said ""No problem, we'll take care of it"".  When we arrived the table was ready to go.  Servers immediately took our drink orders and food orders shortly after.  All of the food came out together and quickly I might add--we finished a 3 course dinner for 12 in 1.5 hours.  That's pretty damn impressive.  Let me add, its not as if we were in a rush, nor did we feel that they were rushing us--they were simply very prepared and on top of things.  The food itself was DELICIOUS and we had some vegetarians in the group but there was a great vegetable antipasti and a pasta entree for them.  Their preparations are simple and the menu is small but it's got crowd-pleasers on it including pasta and roast chicken so even the pickier eaters can find something.  It's well prepared, tasty and filling--we walked out of there totally stuffed!  They even brought me a dessert with a candle so my friends could sing to me :)  All in all, a VERY good place to have a group.  Thanks Rucola for making my birthday dinner such a success!!",5.0
"Word to the wise: Perhaps it's not such a good idea to visit a restaurant on their second day open. I learned this the hard way when I showed up at Rucola in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn. The anticipation of the opening of this new spot that touts northern-Italian cuisine was palpable when I arrived on Friday to a swarm of patrons outside the door. Probably because it's the baby of alums of the Prime Meats, Death & Co., and Cafe Boulud ""restaurant titan trifecta."" And I fell for it. I even waited for over two hours to be seated, which I would never do! This time was an exception, as the hours pass pleasantly when you have a friend who works at a bar down the street and you're not yet famished. Cut to us merrily merging forces and sitting at a table for three at 10:15 pm.With some trifecta power of our own and a short listed offering of 5 plates and 2 desserts, it was only natural to order the whole menu. Turns out even that was not enough and we wound up having to double up on items. It also would have been considerate if they had mentioned one minor  detail: They had no power! Excuse me? How could you confidently invite patrons to spend a pretty penny (yeah, it wasn't cheap) on what they think is a fully supported menu of food worth a 2-hour plus wait, and you don't have a functioning fridge and burner? Well it didn't go unnoticed, as our food left much to be desired - and we ordered everything!I will commend Rucola for the ambiance set by perfectly placed rustic wooden tables, romantic candle-lighting, and an extremely genial front of the house. Our server was genuinely bubbly and Julian Brizzi, managing partner and ""name-taker"" of the night, was all smiles and enthusiasm as he jotted our phone number and nonchalantly mentioned it's a 2-hour wait for 2 - which couldn't help beget the ""don't call us, we'll call you"" sentiment.If you still feel hungry after a meal out, there is a screw loose somewhere. I don't appreciate dishes overpriced for their portions, but can give a pass if the food is at the least thoughtful and tasty. But the leave-you- feeling-hungry, uninteresting, pricey fare doesn't jive with me. And this was Rucola in a nutshell. Two bottles of wine made this pill easier to swallow, but my party was still all too aware of our disappointment. We wound up with two meat and cheese plates - the second, one of those duplications that came at the end of the meal when we still needed more to put in our mouths. These were acceptably edible and as interesting as a charcuterie board might be, showcasing three of each, but in a portion that did not reflect the $19 a pop price.Move to the two salads on the menu that looked almost identical. One presented itself as an octopus salad, but had more tasteless arugula than the thread-thin fish. The other with radishes and dandelion greens was as robust and intricate as it sounds: not. Whatever else was in them to contribute some sort of flavor failed. It was unfortunate that the octopus was another repeat dish. But excitement abounded when the pasta plate approached, as surely this was fail-safe. We were so confident in this homemade fettuccine carbonara with ramps that we doubled up on this dish right from the start - only to be informed post-ordering they only had one left (hence the second, but unfulfilling helping of octopus salad.) Well, we found it wouldn't have been worth the carb consumption. A blessing in disguise? How do I know this pasta did not meet anyone's tongue in the kitchen? Because they would have dumped the whole batch had the overload of salt assaulted them as it did us. The resulting taste was akin to the all too familiar experience of merrily salting along when the loose cap of the shaker demonically flies off, a flood of salt crystals rushing out like a broken dam. When it comes to salting, a heavy hand can be a bad, bad thing - and it was. The only thing that was notable by comparison was the whole fish on the bone, decorated with clams and a simple lemon, oilve oil, and basil pesto. This was good as far as these things go, but nothing outstanding, as one might hope for with such a hefty price. An assorted cookie platter was not a comprehensive dessert by any stretch but the hodge podge sufficed as little sugary nibbles. The chocolate cake tasted like it was compliments of Betty Crocker, living up to the after-thought it probably was without an appearance menu. And the soupy rice pudding - ah, make that two. Oh right, hungry still - was the best of the three options, with a rhubarb compote that added a spruce of color if not a benign sweetness. Hunger plus mediocrity equals over $80 per person? So I guess we won't be doing that again - not unless I can be assured that all the electrical appliances are powered and there is a salt patrol on duty. Even with these things, the thought put into the dishes needs to be more deliberate, focused and creative. Not to mention better supported by substantial ingredients.",1.0

"Really excited to have this place in the hood!Went here the other day with a few friends.

Love the milk bottle chandeliers!But more importantly, the food is great. The best things on the menu that night were well curated meat and cheese plate, a really unique and DELICIOUS charred fava bean dish, and an outstanding handmade pasta with ricotta.

"Just went for a cocktail, cheeses and coffee/dessert.  Staff was very curteous and attentive and the chocolate pudding w salt was phenomenal.  Espresso was robust and great complement to the dessert.  Atmosphere warm and romantic.  Well worth the short walk from our downtown brooklyn hotel.  Highly recommended.",4.0
"After walking past this spot dozens of times since it opened, I finally rallied some troops and tried it out. Rucola is always packed, so calling about an hour ahead of our arrival and making a non-reservation reservation was key to minimizing the wait time. The decor is great here, with the whole reclaimed wood / old-timey light fixture thing in full effect, but I already knew that after my extensive surveillance. I would say it's cozy bordering on cramped. The waiters have sort of a tough time navigating between tightly spaced tables. The noise level is high. Not too big a deal, unless you're like me and your voice cracks like a 12-year old boy when you have to raise your voice.  We had some interesting cocktails, good wine, and pretty great food. I had the LI Duck and it was stellar. The price point here is maybe slightly high, but if they can keep a packed house every night then it's clearly not too high.After our meal here, I'll be only slightly less envious in future when walking past and seeing all the happy people inside. The experience is not perfect, but it's a strong addition to the neighborhood and I'll be returning. I'd go 4.5 stars on this one.",4.0
"This place feels like a little restaurant in the West Village....except you are in Cobble Hill. Intimate and romantic...nice selection of wines...lovely pastas! Can't wait to try the larger entrees, we opted for the two pastas and loved the kale pasta...it was creamy goodness. It's a tight squeeze navigating to the table but once you are there, you are comfy. We didn't sit at the communal table though...so can't comment on that. The bar looks like a great place to grab a bite solo. Great neighborhood joint and worth trying out if you don't live here! Yummy chocolate torte too!",4.0
"A wonderful place! Fabulous simple italian food done perfectly. Great warm atmosphere with perfect lighting. We had a party of six and we all felt it was a really special place- most of us had the housemade rigatoni with bolognese, my mom had the whole brook trout and we all had the chocolate pudding with olive oil and sea salt which was to die for. The roasted brussel sprouts and the canneloni beans and escarole were also great.Good beers and wine list- and it looked like they knew what they doing in the cocktail department. Go and enjoy!",5.0
"Sat at the bar after getting engaged and had an awesome dinner. :) Terrific duck and small plates, tasty wine list and well-made cocktails. I would highly recommend for a romantic evening, a small dinner with friends or as a random walk-in when you don't feel like cooking. Excellent version of what every site on Smith St. claims to be, but this place actually performs!",4.0
"I've been here several times but have never reviewed before, and I had such an amazing experience last night I thought it was high time I yelp'ed for this place.  I used to get frustrated at the long waits (and the waits can be very long!) but since we were planning a big group, we were able to get reservations easily.  We had a birthday dinner with 12 friends last night and and it went off like clockwork.  We emailed with Aiden to confirm details and even changed the head count a few times--he responded quickly and always said ""No problem, we'll take care of it"".  When we arrived the table was ready to go.  Servers immediately took our drink orders and food orders shortly after.  All of the food came out together and quickly I might add--we finished a 3 course dinner for 12 in 1.5 hours.  That's pretty damn impressive.  Let me add, its not as if we were in a rush, nor did we feel that they were rushing us--they were simply very prepared and on top of things.  The food itself was DELICIOUS and we had some vegetarians in the group but there was a great vegetable antipasti and a pasta entree for them.  Their preparations are simple and the menu is small but it's got crowd-pleasers on it including pasta and roast chicken so even the pickier eaters can find something.  It's well prepared, tasty and filling--we walked out of there totally stuffed!  They even brought me a dessert with a candle so my friends could sing to me :)  All in all, a VERY good place to have a group.  Thanks Rucola for making my birthday dinner such a success!!",5.0
"Word to the wise: Perhaps it's not such a good idea to visit a restaurant on their second day open. I learned this the hard way when I showed up at Rucola in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn. The anticipation of the opening of this new spot that touts northern-Italian cuisine was palpable when I arrived on Friday to a swarm of patrons outside the door. Probably because it's the baby of alums of the Prime Meats, Death & Co., and Cafe Boulud ""restaurant titan trifecta."" And I fell for it. I even waited for over two hours to be seated, which I would never do! This time was an exception, as the hours pass pleasantly when you have a friend who works at a bar down the street and you're not yet famished. Cut to us merrily merging forces and sitting at a table for three at 10:15 pm.With some trifecta power of our own and a short listed offering of 5 plates and 2 desserts, it was only natural to order the whole menu. Turns out even that was not enough and we wound up having to double up on items. It also would have been considerate if they had mentioned one minor  detail: They had no power! Excuse me? How could you confidently invite patrons to spend a pretty penny (yeah, it wasn't cheap) on what they think is a fully supported menu of food worth a 2-hour plus wait, and you don't have a functioning fridge and burner? Well it didn't go unnoticed, as our food left much to be desired - and we ordered everything!I will commend Rucola for the ambiance set by perfectly placed rustic wooden tables, romantic candle-lighting, and an extremely genial front of the house. Our server was genuinely bubbly and Julian Brizzi, managing partner and ""name-taker"" of the night, was all smiles and enthusiasm as he jotted our phone number and nonchalantly mentioned it's a 2-hour wait for 2 - which couldn't help beget the ""don't call us, we'll call you"" sentiment.If you still feel hungry after a meal out, there is a screw loose somewhere. I don't appreciate dishes overpriced for their portions, but can give a pass if the food is at the least thoughtful and tasty. But the leave-you- feeling-hungry, uninteresting, pricey fare doesn't jive with me. And this was Rucola in a nutshell. Two bottles of wine made this pill easier to swallow, but my party was still all too aware of our disappointment. We wound up with two meat and cheese plates - the second, one of those duplications that came at the end of the meal when we still needed more to put in our mouths. These were acceptably edible and as interesting as a charcuterie board might be, showcasing three of each, but in a portion that did not reflect the $19 a pop price.Move to the two salads on the menu that looked almost identical. One presented itself as an octopus salad, but had more tasteless arugula than the thread-thin fish. The other with radishes and dandelion greens was as robust and intricate as it sounds: not. Whatever else was in them to contribute some sort of flavor failed. It was unfortunate that the octopus was another repeat dish. But excitement abounded when the pasta plate approached, as surely this was fail-safe. We were so confident in this homemade fettuccine carbonara with ramps that we doubled up on this dish right from the start - only to be informed post-ordering they only had one left (hence the second, but unfulfilling helping of octopus salad.) Well, we found it wouldn't have been worth the carb consumption. A blessing in disguise? How do I know this pasta did not meet anyone's tongue in the kitchen? Because they would have dumped the whole batch had the overload of salt assaulted them as it did us. The resulting taste was akin to the all too familiar experience of merrily salting along when the loose cap of the shaker demonically flies off, a flood of salt crystals rushing out like a broken dam. When it comes to salting, a heavy hand can be a bad, bad thing - and it was. The only thing that was notable by comparison was the whole fish on the bone, decorated with clams and a simple lemon, oilve oil, and basil pesto. This was good as far as these things go, but nothing outstanding, as one might hope for with such a hefty price. An assorted cookie platter was not a comprehensive dessert by any stretch but the hodge podge sufficed as little sugary nibbles. The chocolate cake tasted like it was compliments of Betty Crocker, living up to the after-thought it probably was without an appearance menu. And the soupy rice pudding - ah, make that two. Oh right, hungry still - was the best of the three options, with a rhubarb compote that added a spruce of color if not a benign sweetness. Hunger plus mediocrity equals over $80 per person? So I guess we won't be doing that again - not unless I can be assured that all the electrical appliances are powered and there is a salt patrol on duty. Even with these things, the thought put into the dishes needs to be more deliberate, focused and creative. Not to mention better supported by substantial ingredients.",1.0

"Th food is always great as is the coffee. I haven't gone for cocktails yet so I am not sure how they are. The service, however, leaves something to be desired.

"Really excited to have this place in the hood!Went here the other day with a few friends. We arrived before the dinner rush (around 6:30) and our party of 4 was seated right away - although maybe we got lucky because within 30 minutes the guy at the door was putting people on a waiting list.It's in a beautiful space and the decor is comfy and creative. Love the milk bottle chandeliers!But more importantly, the food is great. The best things on the menu that night were well curated meat and cheese plate, a really unique and DELICIOUS charred fava bean dish, and an outstanding handmade pasta with ricotta. Everything looked and tasted like it was made with a lot of love.2 fantastic bottles of wine and an amaro digestif later we were all in foodie heaven.Sort of want to go back every night to taste the new things on their ever-changing menu.

"Sometimes I wish I could eat every meal at Rucola. Seriously. I'm obsessed.First, their food is delicious. Their menu isn't the most extensive, but there's something for everyone, and I've never had a single bite of something there that I didn't like. The food isn't too heavy, it's well prepared, and it's amazing.I highly recommend the chef's selection of meats and cheeses to start--going with what s/he chooses is a totally safe bet. For main courses, I'm generally a pasta or chicken orderer--not the most adventurous things on the menu, but I've never been disappointed.The other thing that I have to give Rucola a big shout-out for is their service. the restaurant is, justifiably, ALWAYS crowded, so I often stop by thinking I might not be seated or there will be a long wait, but I don't mind because the staff is SO nice. They're never frazzled by how busy they are (or if they are it never shows), and their kind and beyond professional with their patrons. It's the only restaurant that I return to over and over again equally for the food as the service.In the interest of fairness, I will give two cons: 1) I was a little intimidated by their sample menu online at first, so I didn't rush to Rucola as soon as I found it. 2) I'm not obsessed with the focaccia they serve at the start of the meal. That's right, the worst things I can say about Rucola are ""I'm sometimes a whimp about menus I see online"" and ""I'm not obsessed with the thing they give you for free.""For dessert, have the chocolate pudding with olive oil and sea salt--you'll be hooked too.",5.0

"I don't live anywhere near here, but I have eaten here quite a few times, often after attending arts events in the area. Last night's visit was a pleasure, as always. At 9 pm the place was packed and had a nice vibe, but fortunately it started to clear out and we were treated attentively and seated after a pretty short wait. (Once before we had been told honestly that it was a 45 minute wait, but they offered to call us when a table opened. Nice.)  The wines are always tasty choices, reasonably priced, as was the cheese and the tapenade that we ordered right away. I could not resist trying one of several new salads on the menu. It was both tasty and an extremely huge plate full of the very freshest baby carrots, blanched and chilled, and ricotta, with some yummy nuts. I probably should have added a pinch more salt, which they do put on the table in a tiny dish. It was really enough for four people, so my equally large plate of yummy gnocchi was unnecessary but delicious. I ate it all. My boyfriend ate things we had eaten before, notably the rigatoni which is out-of-the-park home-run delectable, always. They typically have things like trout, duck, and chicken entrees on the menu, too. I tend to like the pasta offerings, and usually one of them is vegetarian or near-vegetarian. We sat at a table near the kitchen, which meant a lot of traffic near our table but also prompt attention from the staff. I mentioned to our server that I was too stuffed for dessert, which seemed sad since it was my birthday. They then brought out a sweet, tiny helping of delicious chocolate pudding that the two of us a shared. A really fun and satisfying night.  Looking forward to my next visit.",5.0

"We went to Rucola on the recommendation of two separate friends for an anniversary dinner.  After being told it would be 60 to 90 minute wait, we grabbed a seat at the bar to try the cocktails knowing it would be a long wait.  The host came over within minutes to seat us, and maybe that should have been a sign.  The service was VERY rushed - the waitress was behind the host asking for our dinner order within seconds of being seated at our table. We were granted a few minutes, and placed our order while enjoying the appetizer we ordered at the bar.  Our dinner plates were out about 5 minutes later, when we were hardly through our appetizer.  The risotto was fine, but the fusilli was a beige mush.  The cocktails were delicious, and the setting was charming.  I hope it was just an off-night, but unfortunately for them, I won't go back to find out.",2.0
"Super good. Service was excellent, everything from salad to dessert was superb.

If I'm spending more than $50, give me a seat back, please! Notwithstanding this very minor gripe, I'll definitely return.",5.0
"We live around the corner and want so badly for this to be our neighborhood spot. The place is very nice and cool and dinner is delicious - really very good. Brunch is just such a disappointment, we have been for brunch/breakfast/lunch about 10 times this year and for the prices the portions are just too small. One egg for 10 -12 bucks, today it was chicory salad, with chopped egg so fine you could barely see it, 2 fingerling potatoes cut in half and three 2 inch by 1/2 slices of house smoked salmon for $14. I always leave with my pocket much lighter and still very hungry. Mixed drinks are very small for the standard NY prices..$12-14. The only other thing is that if you sit in either of the two aisles be prepared to get knocked, elbowed, smacked by a purse or water spilled on you because they have not left enough room for the customers to sit and servers to comfortably work. they need about a foot more room on each side - this alone has ruined my expensive meals before. For perspective I have lived in the East Village for 14 years and Brooklyn for two, I am fine with small spaces and paying premium...but sometimes I just feel like i am being taken advantage of here. I will go back for dinner, but I think I have given up on going any earlier.",3.0
"We went to eat here for the first time last week and we very excited.  Pros:  great food!  The cons:  by the time it arrived, we were ready to leave.  Our server that night repeatedly passed our table, glancing to see empty wine and water glasses, then continuing on, often to ""chat"" with other tables for 5-7 minutes.... and not taking orders as the room is small enough the hear the topics of coversation.  Slow food isn't a large issue when it's really good AND when you're not sitting there out of wine and can't get anyone to stop by.  The odd thing is that there also appeared to be 2 managers and 2 other people working the room, glancing at tables,  but still no one ever stopped by, or noticed these things.  If your service matched the quality of the food (in terms of attentiveness - everyone was very nice) you would be a great neighborhood place.  We'll come back because everyone can have an off night - but this was very, very off.",3.0

"Rucola is a very cute, quaint restaurant on a quiet street in the neighborhood.  BF and I sat at the bar as the place fills up and i don't think it takes reservations.  Drinks were fantastic - approx $10 each.  I got the trout - served head and all and BG got the rigatoni which was delicious.  Fish was good and pasta was great (though pasta portion was a bit on the smaller side for a main course).  My only complaint - menu is a bit limited.",4.0
great bloody mary.  spicy and tangy.  nice looking place with a very comfortable vibe.  perfect for a weekend afternoon.,4.0
"We went to Rucola on the recommendation of two separate friends for an anniversary dinner.  After being told it would be 60 to 90 minute wait, we grabbed a seat at the bar to try the cocktails knowing it would be a long wait.  The host came over within minutes to seat us, and maybe that should have been a sign.  The service was VERY rushed - the waitress was behind the host asking for our dinner order within seconds of being seated at our table. We were granted a few minutes, and placed our order while enjoying the appetizer we ordered at the bar.  Our dinner plates were out about 5 minutes later, when we were hardly through our appetizer.  The risotto was fine, but the fusilli was a beige mush.  The cocktails were delicious, and the setting was charming.  I hope it was just an off-night, but unfortunately for them, I won't go back to find out.",2.0
"Super good. Service was excellent, everything from salad to dessert was superb. Tasteful cocktail menu with none of the ""hey, we're mixologists"" bartender shtick that makes me want to order a Schlitz in disgust.  Nice atmosphere, though I'm not at all a fan of the bench seating trend that seems to be catching on in NY, particularly in Brooklyn. If I'm spending more than $50, give me a seat back, please! Notwithstanding this very minor gripe, I'll definitely return.",5.0
"We live around the corner and want so badly for this to be our neighborhood spot. The place is very nice and cool and dinner is delicious - really very good. Brunch is just such a disappointment, we have been for brunch/breakfast/lunch about 10 times this year and for the prices the portions are just too small. One egg for 10 -12 bucks, today it was chicory salad, with chopped egg so fine you could barely see it, 2 fingerling potatoes cut in half and three 2 inch by 1/2 slices of house smoked salmon for $14. I always leave with my pocket much lighter and still very hungry. Mixed drinks are very small for the standard NY prices..$12-14. The only other thing is that if you sit in either of the two aisles be prepared to get knocked, elbowed, smacked by a purse or water spilled on you because they have not left enough room for the customers to sit and servers to comfortably work. they need about a foot more room on each side - this alone has ruined my expensive meals before. For perspective I have lived in the East Village for 14 years and Brooklyn for two, I am fine with small spaces and paying premium...but sometimes I just feel like i am being taken advantage of here. I will go back for dinner, but I think I have given up on going any earlier.",3.0
"We went to eat here for the first time last week and we very excited.  Pros:  great food!  The cons:  by the time it arrived, we were ready to leave.  Our server that night repeatedly passed our table, glancing to see empty wine and water glasses, then continuing on, often to ""chat"" with other tables for 5-7 minutes.... and not taking orders as the room is small enough the hear the topics of coversation.  Slow food isn't a large issue when it's really good AND when you're not sitting there out of wine and can't get anyone to stop by.  The odd thing is that there also appeared to be 2 managers and 2 other people working the room, glancing at tables,  but still no one ever stopped by, or noticed these things.  If your service matched the quality of the food (in terms of attentiveness - everyone was very nice) you would be a great neighborhood place.  We'll come back because everyone can have an off night - but this was very, very off.",3.0
"I love the food here, but the service is generally pretty awful. You will wait about 15mins to have your order taken with not so much as a glass of water during lunch. I've watched the staff text or do everything else before taking an order. I've watched customers get up and leave out of frustration because no one took their order or they just simply forgot too. Go for the food but bring lots of time and patience.",2.0
"Get the veal spiedini and the arugula salad. And the pastas are yummy. I also grab a coffee from the counter now and again. I would say that the entrees are just okay, but that's always the way with Italian places. And from the outside, it's just about the coziest looking place in the universe.",4.0
This is my favorite restaurant.  The food is five-star caliber at neighborhood prices.  The wine list is both broad and deep.  The chef worked at Danielle and Cafe Bouloud and just wanted his own place.  The manager worked at Prime Meats and is super-welcoming.  The staff are all-stars of the industry and just make you feel good to eat there.  The design and decor are aesthetically superlative.  The atmosphere is upbeat and welcoming.  And the last time I was there I saw Michelle Williams and Jake Gyllenhaal on a date!,5.0
"great atmosphere, kind & knowledgeable staff.  i've been twice.  once, i sat at the bar with a friend and had wine and the meat & cheese plate with their house focaccia.  the focaccia is terrific and the meat & cheese plate delicious.  some restaurants don't fill up the plate with meat and cheese and there is only enough for two people to each have a little taste, but this was a nice serving and a good variety of flavors.  the restaurant is a little expensive for my budget but the cheapest glass of wine was delicious and i didn't feel like a slouch ordering the cheapest glass on the menu because the wine menu is very thoughtfully chosen.  another time, i was with a big group and we shared a lot of dishes.  we had a reservation but the group before us arrived late so we had to wait a bit.  the staff was very apologetic and i really don't know how they could have helped the situation.  its a small restaurant.  i had the trout and it was very good.  i tasted my friend's pork shank and it was so tender i wished i'd ordered it.  the chocolate pudding is delicious; definitely order it!  i never would have thought to order it but i really enjoyed it and think i am addicted.  my friends and i splurged on a big celebratory meal and i was really happy with the food, service and atmosphere.  while it is expensive for my budget, i think the prices are fine for the neighborhood and the great quality of the food and wine.  i felt every penny was well-spent.",5.0

"Hi again. Here to update my review.  Please Steve W., no nasty personal emails. I'm probably old enough to be your mother-- you wouldn't do that to your mother, would you? I've lived in this neighborhood longer than you may have been alive-- so when you were 1 and starting to eat solid foods I was a recent college graduate going out to nice restaurants so I feel qualified to give what may be a broader view of the neighborhood dining scene  as well the tragedies of 'not getting into Frankie's'.  In essence, I still feel generally the same about Rucola-- it's all becoming abundantly clear (more on that in a bit).  Still, the positives: achingly friendly staff, so you only want the best for them.  They leaned out the size of the farm table, I can only imagine they were tripping over themselves.  The menu was so much more generous in both portion size and options. I generally enjoyed the food-- but certain things like waiting 1 hr more than what was expected (1hr +1hr= most of the night is over before being seated) and an extended period of time between courses as well  exceptionally over-salting most dishes. Hey, I adore salt, it's practically endemic to me-- but not like: can I have a little chicken for my salt? I never thought I would mention salt being an issue anywhere, ever.  All this is easy to correct or it will suss itself out-- so all's good.Still, I had a lovely evening marred only slightly by the little things.  As mentioned above, I've been in the neighborhood longer than I have lived in any other place in the world. I have ushered in literally all of the restaurants that emerged in this neighborhood--I'm friends with most of the chefs and owners because I love food and dining and would visit and eat at their restaurants weekly. For example, last week I was at Grocery and Charlie and Sharon acknowledged they were weeded because their tiny restaurant triples in size on warm summer evenings--so the 'slower' pace was met with personal appearances, about 5, seriously 5 additional little courses in between what was ordered and copious wine and apologies as well as incredibly warm and professional service.  I guess what I'm saying is that you either want to 'get into to Frankies' or Rucola-or you want to be taken care of with expert food and service and a dining experience that caters to perhaps a more sophisticated diner.  And by sophisticated, I don't mean 'older' or stuffy-- just a little more experienced, seasoned and careful.",3.0
