"This is where all started! Long lines and almost 45 min wait just for a brisket sandwich. It's THAT good! Simple and consistent: they only sell brisket sandwiches. And yes, they are the best ones you can eat in your lifetime. It's so good that when I found they were opening a joint in east village I got so excited I couldn't stop talking about what I was going to eat. Obviously the restaurant is ten times better because they don't only have brisket by pound but they also have a killer pulled pork and barbecue ribs that compete with the best barbecues in the country. This place is top rated and it's claimed to be one of the best in the states. Their beans are just the perfect dish for winter. It's like a chili but packed with brisket and pulled pork! A M A Z I N GAnyway, going back to this little joint in the middle of smorgasburg fair, it's worth the wait and they have a nice smokey brisket that melts in your mouth paired with pickles, onions and their special barbecue sauce with a little sprinkle of sea salt on top. A nice tip is to ask the butcher to rub the bread's interior in the cutting table where the magic happens. That way you have a nice flavor in the bread. Top top top quality! All Mighty Quinn and King of the barbecue!",5.0
"Terrible!!! Nothing was good, Brontosaurus Rib was OK, Burnt ends overwhelmed with spicy hot bbq sauce, in order for you to taste nothig!! And don't even think of trying the beans... too sweet!",1.0
"I just got Mighty Quinn's delivery. I thought I was ordering a brisket sandwich but just got plain meat by itself, which was a little disappointing. The option on the delivery site said I had to choose ""naked"" as the option, and there was nothing else, although in the picture it was a sandwich, so that was confusing. The broccoli salad was OK, I ordered the fries originally but they were out. I think this place is way better at the restaurant, not recommended for delivery. It was cold when it arrived to me, but when I had it in the past at the spot it was super good.",3.0
I first tried Might Quinn's in Smorgasborg Dumbo. It's very tasty. I personally like fatty brisket they mostly had lean but their bread and sauces were pretty good. Recently my husband and I dined in in their restaurant... They have a good selection of bbq but the brisket was still rather dry for me.,3.0
Aaron Franklin has ruined brisket for me. Ruined it. Nothing was the same.Buuut my brisket sandwich at Mighty Quinn's was pretty good. The slaw is a fine compliment.,4.0
"I don't like eating the same thing over and over. Usually. Every Saturday, though, I trek to Williamsburg and fight the crowds of Smorgasburg for my brisket slider. The pulled pork is amazing, the toppings are well-made and the sea salt is a must-have. The brisket, though. They cut it right in font of you. Don't go grabbing it off the table, you'll want to wait till they put it on the slider. They have a $5 mini and a $10 regular. If you want to enjoy all that is Smorgasburg, go with the mini. Five dollars never bought me more happiness in this city, and I have still have room for some of the other great foods.",5.0
"I've been to Smorgasburg numerous times and always noticed the looooong line at Mighty Quinn's, but I was never wiling to wait since there were so many other options.  On my most recent visit, while my hubby waited for food somewhere else, I decided it was time to wait for Mighty Quinn's.The line was long, probably about a 30 minute wait, but to be honest I don't know why it takes so long since there are not a ton of options for people to ponder over.  Maybe it's the arrogant guys who think its sly to friend someone at the head of the line and pretend they are with them in order not to have to wait like the rest of us or maybe it's the MQ gal who chats them up even though they obviously cut.Anyway, let's talk about the brisket, it is pretty damn awesome.  Melt in your mouth tender.  Sandwiches are cut and topped to order.  Toppings include BBQ sauce, hot peppers, cucumber slices and onions.  Paired with the brisket it's a little piece of heaven.I now understand why the long line is always continuous and I may be inclined to wait on it again.",4.0
"I love their pork burger!! I tried at Brooklyn Bridge park. I ate two big ones (trying to forget that I'm in diet  =p) Try to arrive earlier for Brooklyn bridge park, after 2pm, the lines are crazy. Small burger definitely not enough for a skinny girl, coz you gonna love it too!",5.0

"As a barbecue obsessed individual, when I saw Mighty Quinn's occupying a stall at Smorgasburg a few weekends ago, I knew I'd found lunch.Pit Master Hugh Mangum abides by slow-cooking his high quality barbecue meats with plenty of wood and time. The freshly-sliced brisket is topped with a light sprinkling of sea salt and some delicious barbecue sauce. It's a picture-perfect combination. I almost didn't want to take a bite.Wow! What a brisket sandwich! The meat had a perfectly charred black exterior giving way to a red smoke ring interior. I can see why Mighty Quinn's is a top spot among barbecue lovers - this was delicious. My only complaint was that the brisket could have been a little juicer. I thought it was somewhat dry and could have had a little bit more fat on it.Next stop - checking out one of Mighty Quinn's restaurant locations, which are based on the fast casual cafeteria model (and ordering the entire menu). Anyone want to join?",4.0
"Pretty good! The brisket and pulled pork were both a little drier than I expected given the rave reviews. The flavor was definitely there though. It could have just been the batch I was given.

"I cant help but drool when I think of Mighty Quinn's. First saw them while waiting in line for the ramen burger in Williamsburg, they too had a long line. We saw them again the next day at the Smorgasburg in Dumbo and had to try it. At first we were going to get the 'small' portion since it was $5, but when we saw how small it was compared to how huge the big is, might as well go big! We tried both brisket and the pork. Probably the most tender meat I have ever had! They wiped our bread bun w/ the juices from cutting the meat on their cutting board. Pure deliciousness!!!!! Totally worth the 30 min wait, and worth the $9, worth the hype! If you like bbq, you will not be disappointed!",5.0
"Love this place, how they transform this place from the former German bier bar to this long needed good BBQ place in the east village.First of all, this place is semi-outdoor, they kept their window and front door open. The staffs are very friendly and very fast as servicing. The atmosphere  is modern, and clean.  The one thing I always order is the brisket sandwich, they alice the meat per order, as they got the order, the cutter would cut the meat up for you, but here the part to impress me. They don't just cut the meat, but they give you 80%lean, 10% fat and 10% of the burnt end and dices it so it give you a different texture as every bite.  Another unique part is they season it with sea-salt at the end to bring out the meat favor. And you can add more topping to the sandwich to make it extra delicious. If favor ken enough, their homemade BBQ sauces are placed at all tables for your use.",5.0
"This is transported from my Smorgasburg review, but this is THE place to go there.Mighty Quinn's has the longest line of the place and it could easily take 15 minutes. It's a big smoker with two men slicing large hunks of brisket and lamb. They offer a lot of meat for even their small sandwich, a great deal at $5. After the meat is packed on a brioche bun, the brisket is served with a BBQ sauce and pickled onions, while the lamb comes with a white sauce and chiles.The brisket is incredibly tender, but I've had great brisket.Shredded lamb this good though? Never before. It really was packed with a flavor and the burnt bits added so much smokiness and texture.The last time I went, they were sold out by 4:00. Be early and the wait is worth it.",5.0
"Outstanding Texalina (Texas & Carolinas fusion) barbecue! I would argue even better than than Fettesau, although that's no chump bbq either. The burnt ends and sausage are my faves. But the chicken wings are excellent as well. You just need to get your own blue cheese dip for them. The slaws, both vinegar and mayo varieties, are winners and the locked peppers, onions, cucumbers all go well together. Best of all, this doesn't make you feel overly stuffed or sluggish afterwards.",5.0
"Best BBQ downtown hands down. Note this place is cafeteria style do you can go anytime and not have to worry about waiting more than 30 min for a seat.

"Being big BBQ fans and reading the pretty unanimous love for Mighty Quinns, this was maybe the only place we knew we were for sure going to try heading to our first Smorgasburg adventure.  However, after getting to the Williamsburg event early and seeing a diverse group of food vendors with such unique food items I thought I may be making a mistake using up precious belly-space on traditional BBQ.  When we got to the Mighty Quinns tent and only saw 3 people in line at ten minutes to eleven, armed with the knowledge that the lines get longer than maybe every other vendor there and selling out early happens frequently, we decided to go for it and I'm glad we did.The brisket was the best I've ever had by a landslide.  What was unique about it to me was how light it was, not overly fatty and heavy yet still extremely juicy and flavorful.  The Pigtrip BBQ blog has been to their brick-and-mortar location and noted in their writeup that they use the 'cadillac of smokers.'  Given that MQ's website gives credit to sourcing the best ingredients, I have to wonder if they go with wagyu brisket and all it's ridiculous intramuscular fat.  I decided to add some of their house made pickles on top for some crunch and acid to cut through the fat and enjoyed it on the waterfront overlooking the NYC skyline and for those three glorious minutes, life did not suck.Besides the memory of the food itself, something that will live with me forever was watching the brisket being unwrapped first from the tin foil, then the saran wrap, where it went to the cutting board where it absolutely quivered as it was being cut.  The first person in line went with the brisket sandwich and the woman doing the butchering took the saran wrap that just held the brisket and wrung the juices onto the brisket buns.  For my money, that was as good as food porn gets.",5.0
"I waited on the line for 20 minutes at Smorgasburg only to have them run out of brisket two people before me !!!

The pulled pork was awesome! Tender, fatty, juicy, unctuous pork on a brioche bun with slaw and a squirt of bbq sauce. This was maybe the best pulled pork sandwich I've ever had, and right up there with the one from Bob Gibson's at the Big Apple BBQ I had earlier in the summer time.",5.0

"Being big BBQ fans and reading the pretty unanimous love for Mighty Quinns, this was maybe the only place we knew we were for sure going to try heading to our first Smorgasburg adventure.  However, after getting to the Williamsburg event early and seeing a diverse group of food vendors with such unique food items I thought I may be making a mistake using up precious belly-space on traditional BBQ.  When we got to the Mighty Quinns tent and only saw 3 people in line at ten minutes to eleven, armed with the knowledge that the lines get longer than maybe every other vendor there and selling out early happens frequently, we decided to go for it and I'm glad we did.The brisket was the best I've ever had by a landslide.  What was unique about it to me was how light it was, not overly fatty and heavy yet still extremely juicy and flavorful.  The Pigtrip BBQ blog has been to their brick-and-mortar location and noted in their writeup that they use the 'cadillac of smokers.'  Given that MQ's website gives credit to sourcing the best ingredients, I have to wonder if they go with wagyu brisket and all it's ridiculous intramuscular fat.  I decided to add some of their house made pickles on top for some crunch and acid to cut through the fat and enjoyed it on the waterfront overlooking the NYC skyline and for those three glorious minutes, life did not suck.Besides the memory of the food itself, something that will live with me forever was watching the brisket being unwrapped first from the tin foil, then the saran wrap, where it went to the cutting board where it absolutely quivered as it was being cut.  The first person in line went with the brisket sandwich and the woman doing the butchering took the saran wrap that just held the brisket and wrung the juices onto the brisket buns.  For my money, that was as good as food porn gets.",5.0
"I waited on the line for 20 minutes at Smorgasburg only to have them run out of brisket two people before me !!! AHH i was so mad at it was only 2:30 so make sure you get there early if you want the brisket. It looked so amazing so I was bummed out but hey they are coming to the city soon so I will have plenty of opportunities to sample it.Still, they had some amazing pulled pork as a backup and were extremely apologetic for running out of the brisket. The pulled pork was awesome! Tender, fatty, juicy, unctuous pork on a brioche bun with slaw and a squirt of bbq sauce. This was maybe the best pulled pork sandwich I've ever had, and right up there with the one from Bob Gibson's at the Big Apple BBQ I had earlier in the summer time.",5.0
long wait but solid BBQ option - reasonably priced with good beersribs look great bunch there is no small portion of it. get a bit of everything meat wise. sweet potato casserole is a must have,4.0
"Really nice and fun atmosphere with a lovely smell of fire in the air. The sausage was super well seasoned. The ribs were decent, but were too fatty for my taste. The sides were really good too (sweet potatoes, and slaw). The selection of beers also make this place a great spot.",4.0
"Wasn't sure that this place would live up to all the hype, but it turned out to be pretty legit! We made sure to get our sandwiches from here first, with rumors of running out quickly. The pulled pork was tender and juicy, with a delicious bbq sauce drizzled on top. Brioche bun was a great complement to the huge portion of meat (even for the small sandwich) and was a great way to start our food tour. Can't wait to try the pulled lamb!",5.0
I liked brisket after eating at the Smorgasburg Mighty Quinn's. They had the longest line there. Didn't stop me from getting seconds. So fatty and delicious!,5.0
"The first time I when to Smorgasburg I saw the line and was like, like most people, this must be something good but am I going to wait on this line or am I going to look around for something else.  This Saturday, I realized why people wait on this line.  Buttery bread, soaked in the juices of the smoked brisket.  You add pickles, red onions and red peppers and you now have a fusion of in your mouth food fucking that you will not forget!! Just do it for yourself and bring your friends so they can 'gasm to!",5.0
