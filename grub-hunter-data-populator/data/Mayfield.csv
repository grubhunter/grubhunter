"Came in on a recommendation. Not disappointed. Service throughout was excellent.Oysters were on a special. I had 6. Been a long time since I had any. Had another dozen :)A bit later had the mushroom ravioli. Tasty. Really tasty. Really, really tasty. Later still had the cauliflour with cheese. A bit salty, but otherwise nice.Much later still, had the Berkshire pork chop. Perfect. Sitting here, I am wishing I was back there eating another one! Super creamy mash, and nice fried greens. Dessert was excellent. Had a taste and passed onto Dark North.Sitting at the bar gave me excellent conversation. Especially over the several hours that I was there. Where else can you meet pizza store guys, Danish event manager, and musicians who have toured Europe :):):)",5.0
"Perfect spot for great food and great conversation. I came here on a Sunday night with my dad and boyfriend. We ordered cocktails, entrees and dessert and loved everything. The wait staff was so friendly and I love the casual ambiance. There's plenty of seating which is a huge plus. We had the Berkshire pork chop, trout, and fish & chips. I wasn't paying attention and apparently missed the part where it says the trout is an ENTIRE fish - eyeballs and everything. Needless to say, it arrived and I was freaked out. Thankfully my boyfriend will eat anything and we switched. Even though it really was tasty, admittedly.We also got spoon bread (so good), ricotta donuts (omg), and I had the ""I'm a Lady"" cocktail (obsessed). Overall, everything was great and I can't wait to go back!!",5.0
My first experience at Mayfield was satisfactory but my most recent dinner was not enjoyable.The waitress was great and fast so I did tip her accordingly but I left feeling disappointed with the food.I ordered a few dozen oysters and kept the menu to order more dishes but after tasting the oysters my table decided to leave.The oysters were not shucked properly and there were bits of shells in each oyster.,2.0
I love the Mayfield! I've always enjoyed the oysters. Their fresh pasta is delicious every single time! The other night I had the gnocchi with pork ragu. I enjoyed it alot!!!! The gnocchi was so good.  The one concern was that the meat was on the salty side.Had it with the hard cider which was good. My company had a burger with salad. What I like the most about the place is the ambiance. The wait staff is a tentative but not overly hovering. The space feels intimate without being crowded. It's a really nice balance. I've enjoyed myself there every time I've been.,4.0
"I was supposed to grab dinner with my friend in the city, but she changed it up last minute to come here. I went from Brooklyn to the city and back to Brooklyn, but I can't even be mad because everything was perfect! What we ate...- Spoon Bread: I'm not even sure what this is, but I know that it's delicious. My friend said it reminded her of cheesecake, I thought it was more like if grits could be baked. It's magic!- Lobster Baos (special): these came three to an order, each stuffed with a small pile of lobster. It wasn't so overwhelming that I was eating the sea, but I could definitely tell that it was lobster. The greens on top pulled it all together with the freshness and crispness it needed. - Seafood Hushpuppies (special): Six pieces of YUM. Like everything else, these came out perfectly - they weren't greasy at all, and they were a pretty good size for an appetizer. - Cacio e Pepe: it may not look like much, but it was surprisingly filling. It was creamy, and they used just the right amount of pepper. - Cheesecake: it was cheesecake and it was gooood. Not much to say other than that I liked the marmalade on top. - Ricotta Doughnuts: I wasn't sure how ricotta would work as a doughnut, but it totally does. It was so soft and pillowy! Coated in sugar and served with a generous swipe of chocolate on the side, it reminded me of a churro. Service was great. Our waiter seemed a little surprised that we (two little Asian girls) (I'm 5 ft nothing and in the taller one) could clean our plates. Maybe we were hungry, or maybe the food was just that good - or both. Anyway, he was awesome. He obviously did well with up-selling, since we got 2 of the 3 specials for the night. Our waters were always full and our table clear. We came in at 6:30 on a Wednesday night and we were able to be seated without a problem. It did start getting pretty busy by the time we left, though! Good thing they have ample seating an a pretty open space.",5.0
"I made reservations for 3 people for brunch at 12pm. Got there about 2-3 minutes early and it was already packed; we waited about 20 min to get seated. The Atlantic Eggs Benedict plate was very good, the yolk was perfectly syrupy and the hollandaise was delicious. The home fries were a little dry though(like they had been made too far in advance ). My friend got the steak platter and she enjoyed it overall. The main drawback for us was that the food was no where near hot enough. The Bloody Mary was horrible, salty and bitter, almost undrinkable so stick with the Bellini's!!!",4.0
"Went here with friends for brunch before heading over to the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. I ordered the kale salad and wiped my plate clean. My friends got the French toast and shrimp and grits, both of which looked really good as well!",4.0
"To sum it up, it's basically a casual brunch spot where you actually spend the time enjoying the company you're with rather than fawn over the dishes being served. Good service & okay food.The place was busy, with a small group waiting outside. The front of the restaurant had a brunch vibe but as you moved your way back, it was more of a bar with the  TV and high tops. The lighting was a mix of modern and art deco. It was loud and boisterous; it was happening neighborhood spot with a very mixed crowd. There were even a couple kids running around. The service was helpful, very helpful because I requested a table with natural lighting and we moved to a different table after we were seated. I will say, this is not an instagram-friendly restaurant because there were only 3 tables that had access to solid natural light, the rest were mixed lighting which gives off this horrid yellow tint to the dishes. My friends ordered the Bloody Mary and I, the iced tea. I'm having a dryanuary but that didn't stop me from having a sip. The Blood Mary was a bit chunkier than what I'm used to, as if there was pulp of some sort in it. Little smokey, and they incorporated green beans in the drink rather than just placing it atop the drink as a garnish. It was a solid Bloody Mary, well-balanced and not overwhelming; some places make the drink spicy for spicy's sake so it's gimmicky almost. For food, my friend ordered the traditional Eggs Benedict and I ordered the shrimp and grits. In regards to my dish, the collard green and ham hock was a bit salty. The shrimp was over seasoned, maybe it was being cooked in broth and seasoned and finished over a skillet or something but it was very strong. I could barely taste the shrimp over the seasoning. I really appreciate the head-on style though, I was sucking the head like I was at a boil. I wasn't a fan of the dish as a whole, but it wasn't necessarily off putting.  There are worse offenses you could do in this city and the service saves the restaurant.I noticed my friend polished off his Eggs Benedict, but barely touched the potatoes (which are my favorite, yaaas starches). The potatoes were cut like a hash, little square cubes but deep fried and called 'home fries.' Because the cubes are small, they were deep fried hardened bricks, harder than a crouton. You could've built a building's foundation with them but they were salvageable  only when dipped into my brothy-grits mix. I'd come here again if I was in the neighborhood and needed a spot, but it's not a place I'd necessarily travel for.",3.0
"Food is very tasty but too salty.We ordered the spoon bread (a suffle), which was good. Then, mushroom ravioli and brussel sprouts salad. The brussel sprouts were so salty we had to order something else, burger with fries, and they were also too heavy in salt.Interesting mix of ingredients with a cool decor. A but too pricy for the neighborhood, but it's the new trend I guess.",3.0
"Food: loved the smoked salmon platter.. It came as a build your own with a bagel, cream cheese, onions, tomatoes, capers and the salmon.. Salmon is smoked in house... Friends got smoked salmon Benedict and Blt with fries.. The fries were greatService: our waitress was friendly and helped answer questions about the menuAmbience: love the open kitchen and bar... However the place was too loud to have conversations, not sure if that's always or just at brunch",4.0

"Damn good! And surprisingly good for vegetarians. Being from California, I'm quite the connoisseur of kale salads, and the shredded kale salad here was an exemplar of the genre. I had the cauliflower custard for the entree, which was STFU good. Seriously, highly recommend this dish. The custard was wonderful, the farro was super tasty and a great textural contrast. We had doughnuts and gelato and sorbet for dessert, and they were good too. My husband had the mushroom ravioli, which he enjoyed despite usually disliking mushrooms. Service was great. Ambiance is nice, comfortable, and unpretentious. I was worried that it'd be too loud when I first walked in, but my husband and I got seated in the window and had no problem with noise.",5.0
"What a wonderful restaurant! I will definitely be back if I am ever in Brooklyn. I loved the atmosphere. My friend and I sat in the middle by the high top tables for brunch on a Saturday afternoon.Customer service was 5 stars! Our waitress was so bubbly the entire time and checked in on us at the right moments, but still gave us our space. My friend and I were beyond happy by her friendly attitude. Iced coffees were $4 each and delicious. Instead of packets of sugar, our waitress gave us simple sugar syrup! What a nice touch! (Now, show me a restaurant who gives customers condensed milk for their sugar and I will have seen everything.) I got the eggs any style for $12 and it was well worth it. Nothing too fancy, but on the other hand I didn't really order anything fancy. The potatoes were cooked perfectly, the bacon was a bit burnt to my liking, and the toast didn't have butter. No worries, both of us were to lazy to ask for butter/jelly/ ketchup. The show stealer was the small SALAD...oh goodness the vinaigrette was PERFECT.",4.0
"I came here for brunch recently and thoroughly enjoyed their Poached Eggs dish which comes with grilled tasso ham, grit cakes, sauce charon, and scallions. It's assembled the same as an eggs benedict w/ the grit cakes as the base, followed by the ham, eggs, sauce and scallions. The home fries it came with were deep fried and deliciously crispy, but a little too heavy for my taste. The restaurant itself is pretty big (long and narrow, several 4-tops, a full bar), plus a small outdoor patio. We sat in the patio, which I immediately regretted. There's a large tarp covering the patio which blocks out most of the sun (awesome), but unfortunately creates a sauna-like environment. Because there are no fans or air breezing through, the hot air just sits in there, baking its poor patrons that just wanted a relaxing patio brunch. Our server was cute and attentive (small brunette w/ bright lipstick), and thankfully kept our waters filled up. I happened to be sitting on the bench where the hot sun was creeping in just enough to melt my back and my sanity. As much as I enjoyed the meal, I couldn't wait to get out of there.",4.0

"When my boyfriend and I start a trek down Franklin Ave on a Friday night out, we usually wind up at Chavella's or Barboncino.  And there's nothing wrong with either of those - but last week, we decided to press a bit beyond creature comforts and look for something new.Upon first glance across the street, we couldn't quite tell what Mayfield was.  What we could see through the window is a bunch of people having a good time.  The menu wasn't posted outside, so we dorked out and looked it up online.  (I know, I know...)  We took about five seconds to take a brief glance... oysters...spoon bread... cocktails... okay we're in.  We wanted something unusual and a casual-yet-smart vibe - and Mayfield totally delivered.We were seated at the bar first, waiting a table for two.  The bartender immediately impressed by asking if we wanted our cocktail traditional (with egg white) or not.

"There's an old idiom. Service with a smile. How about a smirk? A genuine sense of concern? Maybe a fake sense of concern? Apparently the manager on Wednesday, August 12th 2015, believes in service with no care for the customers whatsoever. I love Mayfield. The food is fantastic. The drinks are wonderful. The waiters and waitresses are always friendly. The place itself is gorgeous. The owner Lev can always be seen helping out. As a result I had previously given the place a five star review. I have recommended it to lots of friends of mine who are looking for a great meal on Franklin Avenue.  This past Wednesday I chose Mayfield to be where my family would take me out for my birthday. We had a party of six, and we came ready to eat. As expected the drinks were tasty and creative. I loved the mezcal cocktail. Our small plates were delicious. And our server was knowledgable and nice. After that things took a turn for the worse. My father is a 70 year old man. When asking for our main dishes, he was thinking about the trout. He asked our sever if it had any bones. She said no. As it turns out, it did. Right there in the first bite. Is this an awful thing? No. It was a genuine mistake. My dad may have been disappointed, but I told him not to worry. I had complete faith that the restaurant would rectify this. Our server apologized, brought over a new menu and he ordered the Cuban. I felt bad. My father was sitting there, hungry. While everyone else had this delicious food out in front of them. I shared my collard greens and spoon bread with him. After five minutes. The manager came over and told us that the Cuban would take 10-15 minutes to make. We asked 10-15 from right now. He said, ""Yes"". Once again is this anyone's fault? Or something to let ruin a special night? No. I felt confident that within 15 minutes my dad's sandwich would come out and he'd love it. These things happen. 30 minutes later we call the manager back over. My father is starving. He wants to eat, and everyone is done with their meal already. The manager never came by to check in and see if he could do something while an elderly patron sat there with nothing to eat for over half an hour. He then informs us, it's 10-15 minuets from when the kitchen takes the order and there were orders in front of his. This is where we have a problem. 1) That's not what he stated earlier. He said 10-15 from right then. 2) If that's the case, wouldn't you move his order in front of other orders seeing how the establishment already messed up his first order. The manager seemed as if he couldn't care. He looked miserable, as we were these loud patrons who were complaining about a frivolous issue. We sat there. Waited. Didn't complain. Spent lots of money on a special occasion. And in the end my father left without eating an entree. My dad left hungry, without an apology from the manager. Our server was great and she felt awful. We still left her a nice tip. In the end though nothing was done to rectify the bad situation, and I felt completely disrespected. I think Mayfield is a wonderful place. After a night like though I can't see myself ever returning or recommending it to my friends.",2.0

"Full disclosure I came to the restaurant because a cousin, who I only see at family gatherings owns it.   That said, Holy Crap this is good. I met my family here because we have a tradition of celebrating August Birthdays all at one time. We have 7 family members all with August Birthdays. The owner our cousin said have it there so we didThe restaurant is a little hard to find. Cuz doesn't have a big sign saying Mayfields. We were meeting at 11AM. I thought we were going early to beat the brunch crowd?  Thing is at 11AM the place was already 3/4 full. I looked around thinking it was because someone was having a party. Not the case. The place was full of people in groups of 2 maybe 3 having brunch.  We were the biggest party. The space is a long with a kitchen that you can watch your food being prepared. There is also an small outdoor patio where you can eat. Now the food. YUMMY.  The menu is small; however, the execute the food so well you do nor care. No matter what I sampled it was well seasoned and well prepared. I had a margarita, kale salad, and yogurt with granola and fruit. Yeah, yeah I know I'm a guy what am I doing ordering that? I just was not in the mood for anything heavy. Both were nice sized portions. The relatives ordered the French Toast, Eggs Benedict, the smoked salmon version of Eggs Benedict, omelet, etc. since I sampled almost everything ... When I come back I would order all of these dished. All the egg dishes came with home fries which were ridiculously crispy on the outside; yet soft and creamy on the inside. I totally recommend this place.",5.0
"Mayfield is my family's go-to spot for many occasions: taking friends and family out, business lunches, romantic dinners, brunch and oyster happy hour! We have had so many memorable times here over the past few years.Brunch is exceptionally good. While it isn't the most affordable, you get a lot of food and it doesn't seem that much more expensive than other brunch spots near by. The bacon egg and cheese and the poached eggs with grilled Tasso ham and grit cakes are two of our favorites. The steak and eggs is also perfect every time. While I wouldn't regularly have lunch at Mayfield due to the slightly pricey menu, it is a great option for business lunches and special occasions. The inclusion of a beer or glass of wine makes it an extra special experience.There are so many great options for dinner and the oysters are always a go-to accompaniment with dinner. We used to always get the fried oyster bellies, but we're sad when they were taken off the menu due to high oyster belly costs. The fish and chips is huge and a great item to share. Other notable dishes are the gnocchi, spoon bread and collards. My only small critique would be that we have had a few unpleasant experiences trying to get a table before the other party arrives. When we take friends or family out for dinner and we are meeting them, we would really like to be able to go 10 minutes early and make sure we get a seat as to make it easier for the other party. We often have to negotiate with the hostess to let us sit 10 minutes and order a drink before the other 1/2 arrives and we have also had to plead with the hostess to allow us to sit at a regular table instead of the high tops. When having a long dinner with friends and family, it's really best to be sitting at a comfortable table in comfortable chairs. When we have not been permitted to sit at a regular table, we often order less and opt out of extra drinks and desserts as it is not as comfortable. I completely understand when it is incredibly busy and the hostesses do not want to give up a table before the rest of our party arrives or the high tops are the only option, however, this always happens when the restaurant is barely occupied. As loyal customers, it would definitely make us feel better to have less of a discussion regarding seating when there are options available. Despite seating issues, we can't praise Mayfield enough and we recommend this restaurant any time we have the opportunity. We will absolutely be back soon!",5.0

The manager seemed as if he couldn't care. He looked miserable, as we were these loud patrons who were complaining about a frivolous issue. We sat there. Waited. Didn't complain. Spent lots of money on a special occasion. And in the end my father left without eating an entree. My dad left hungry, without an apology from the manager. Our server was great and she felt awful. We still left her a nice tip. In the end though nothing was done to rectify the bad situation, and I felt completely disrespected. I think Mayfield is a wonderful place. After a night like though I can't see myself ever returning or recommending it to my friends.",2.0
"Really tasty food, fun atmosphere and good cocktails and wine selection.  I've been here for dinner twice and brunch once.  The kale salad is great, as is the cauliflower cream dinner entrée.  Great options for vegetarians and omnivores alike!",4.0
"I have been here so many times and this is my favorite restaurant in this neighborhood.At dinner time before 9 pm this place very crowded and some time you have to wait and they DON'T take reservation .Staff : hostess is very friendly , waitress are nice and helpful, they know all the menu.I highly recommend the pork chop for entrée",5.0
"Fantastic place on Franklin Ave. that never disappoints. The food is delicious. From the fried chicken sandwich to east coast oysters, to steak tartar, everything is consistently good. Not only that, there's a great neighborhood feel. The staff is very friendly, and is talented at making recommendations. The last time I came by, the waitress and I bonded over the delicious txakolina rosé they have by the glass. As Franklin Ave. continues to blossom, this place is definitely a staple.",5.0
"Nice place.  A lot of interesting dishes on the menu.  Pretty good seletion of beverages too.  Portion sizes were pretty good, especially for the prices.  The do have outdoor seating out back, but that area is kind of small and maybe a little cramped.  Servers were nice too.Chicken liver moouse was good, but I did feel like that dish was missing something, like a little touch of sweetness to bring out the flavor, and/or potentialy just more seasoning.Lamb ribs were tasty, though I didn't get a whole lot of cumin flavor.The cauliflower custard was good, and a pretty substantial dish.",4.0
The trout here is EVERYTHING!!!!! The pork chop is amazing as well! The happy hour Oysters are small yet flavorful!!! This would be my second review for mayfields and soooo much more satisfying! Kudos!,5.0
"The Cuban is absolutely delicious! If you are after a sandwich that is hot, hearty with a little spice kick, this is for you my friend! I also had a bite of a friends' Chicken spicy slaw which was equally tasty. Both dishes come with the option of fries or salad. I Ioved the chipotle/Siracha mayo. The wait for a table on a Friday night was about 40minutes- well worth it though",5.0
"Full disclosure I came to the restaurant because a cousin, who I only see at family gatherings owns it.   That said, Holy Crap this is good. I met my family here because we have a tradition of celebrating August Birthdays all at one time. We have 7 family members all with August Birthdays. The owner our cousin said have it there so we didThe restaurant is a little hard to find. Cuz doesn't have a big sign saying Mayfields. We were meeting at 11AM. I thought we were going early to beat the brunch crowd?  Thing is at 11AM the place was already 3/4 full. I looked around thinking it was because someone was having a party. Not the case. The place was full of people in groups of 2 maybe 3 having brunch.  We were the biggest party. The space is a long with a kitchen that you can watch your food being prepared. There is also an small outdoor patio where you can eat. Now the food. YUMMY.  The menu is small; however, the execute the food so well you do nor care. No matter what I sampled it was well seasoned and well prepared. I had a margarita, kale salad, and yogurt with granola and fruit. Yeah, yeah I know I'm a guy what am I doing ordering that? I just was not in the mood for anything heavy. Both were nice sized portions. The relatives ordered the French Toast, Eggs Benedict, the smoked salmon version of Eggs Benedict, omelet, etc. since I sampled almost everything ... When I come back I would order all of these dished. All the egg dishes came with home fries which were ridiculously crispy on the outside; yet soft and creamy on the inside. I totally recommend this place.",5.0
"Mayfield is my family's go-to spot for many occasions: taking friends and family out, business lunches, romantic dinners, brunch and oyster happy hour! We have had so many memorable times here over the past few years.Brunch is exceptionally good. While it isn't the most affordable, you get a lot of food and it doesn't seem that much more expensive than other brunch spots near by. The bacon egg and cheese and the poached eggs with grilled Tasso ham and grit cakes are two of our favorites. The steak and eggs is also perfect every time. While I wouldn't regularly have lunch at Mayfield due to the slightly pricey menu, it is a great option for business lunches and special occasions. The inclusion of a beer or glass of wine makes it an extra special experience.There are so many great options for dinner and the oysters are always a go-to accompaniment with dinner. We used to always get the fried oyster bellies, but we're sad when they were taken off the menu due to high oyster belly costs. The fish and chips is huge and a great item to share. Other notable dishes are the gnocchi, spoon bread and collards. My only small critique would be that we have had a few unpleasant experiences trying to get a table before the other party arrives. When we take friends or family out for dinner and we are meeting them, we would really like to be able to go 10 minutes early and make sure we get a seat as to make it easier for the other party. We often have to negotiate with the hostess to let us sit 10 minutes and order a drink before the other 1/2 arrives and we have also had to plead with the hostess to allow us to sit at a regular table instead of the high tops. When having a long dinner with friends and family, it's really best to be sitting at a comfortable table in comfortable chairs. When we have not been permitted to sit at a regular table, we often order less and opt out of extra drinks and desserts as it is not as comfortable. I completely understand when it is incredibly busy and the hostesses do not want to give up a table before the rest of our party arrives or the high tops are the only option, however, this always happens when the restaurant is barely occupied. As loyal customers, it would definitely make us feel better to have less of a discussion regarding seating when there are options available. Despite seating issues, we can't praise Mayfield enough and we recommend this restaurant any time we have the opportunity. We will absolutely be back soon!",5.0

"Came here mainly for their $1 oyster happy hour, but stayed for a light meal.The inside is very charming and extremely spacious. The front area is completely open and can get a little drafty on chilly days, therefore the bar or back is a better bet. Ordered a dozen oysters (Montauk pearl), the hand-rolled spaghetti, and a side of spoon bread. The oysters were less than perfectly shucked (some near cuts with errant shell pieces and such) but they were delicious and came with a side of vinaigrette and cocktail sauce.The spoon bread was tiny, but sort of charming in its miniature perfection. Warm, fluffy, and just a little creamy, this was actually a nice offset to our spaghetti. The wonderfully thin and al dente spaghetti came with lots of clams, toasted breadcrumbs, fennel sausage....and A LOT OF SALT. Ugh. It could have been a wonderful dish, but with the excessive level of sodium, it couldn't be saved. By picking off the sausage and avoiding the sauce as much as possible, it was a ""pretty okay tasting"" dish. Why on earth would you salt a dish covered in sausage?This is a very appealing restaurant and I wish my experience had been better.  I would go back to try different foods, but that salty spaghetti is a waste of a perfectly good dish.",3.0
"The food was delicious. However they've raised their prices. I ordered 1 entree, 1 beer and split the cost of an appetizer and my share came to $42 with tax and tip.

All of which are reasonable and completely understandable. I appreciate the owner taking the time to contact me in a well crafted and endearing message. I already said I would be back, so they did not need to contact me.

"Mayfield is a place where, when sitting at the table with friends undecided on what to order, you complicate matters further for by saying ""I've literally never had anything here that wasn't amazing.""  In short, Mayfield can do no wrong.  They strike a perfect balance between ""comfort"" and innovation.  The food is ALWAYS prepared and presented perfectly.  I am almost ashamed to say how many times I've eaten at Mayfield, but it's enough to know what I am talking about.  The staff is also spectacular.  Jamie is a waiter we've seen there seemingly since they opened and he's, hands down, one of the finest waiters I've ever seen.  He is serenity itself even on a frantic Saturday night.  And lest I forget about the space...Mayfield is a breath of fresh air in the Brooklyn restaurant scene (shades of Alameda in Greenpoint). It manages to be neither Edison bulb/Victorian shooting-gallery nor stark mid-century modern/apocalyptic-future prison. It's a glorious combination of elegant yet restrained subway tile-work and invitingly familiar woodwork. And I still gawp in delight at the exposed wiring on the ceiling.  We live in Bed Stuy, but happily made the 15+ minute trek to Mayfield.  Frankly, a little too frequently--I'm having Mayfield tattooed on my love handles!",5.0

I'm looking forward to coming back again, hopefully for their $1 oyster happy hour.",4.0

"Mayfield is a place where, when sitting at the table with friends undecided on what to order, you complicate matters further for by saying ""I've literally never had anything here that wasn't amazing.""  In short, Mayfield can do no wrong.  They strike a perfect balance between ""comfort"" and innovation.  The food is ALWAYS prepared and presented perfectly.  I am almost ashamed to say how many times I've eaten at Mayfield, but it's enough to know what I am talking about.  The staff is also spectacular.  Jamie is a waiter we've seen there seemingly since they opened and he's, hands down, one of the finest waiters I've ever seen.  He is serenity itself even on a frantic Saturday night.  And lest I forget about the space...Mayfield is a breath of fresh air in the Brooklyn restaurant scene (shades of Alameda in Greenpoint). It manages to be neither Edison bulb/Victorian shooting-gallery nor stark mid-century modern/apocalyptic-future prison. It's a glorious combination of elegant yet restrained subway tile-work and invitingly familiar woodwork. And I still gawp in delight at the exposed wiring on the ceiling.  We live in Bed Stuy, but happily made the 15+ minute trek to Mayfield.  Frankly, a little too frequently--I'm having Mayfield tattooed on my love handles!",5.0
"Been living in the neighborhood for almost 2 years and FINALLY got there- wish I did it sooner. 3 girlfriends and I went there ate a bunch of dishes family style because the menu was awesome. We had steak tartar, kale salad, mushroom ravioli, ricotta gnocchi with pork ragu (brown and delicious), and brussel sprouts. The sprouts were awesome and totally different from the regular roasted with bacon type. So good. I can't wait to go back!!!",5.0
"I love this place. The service was excellent, super attentive and friendly. The place was crowded but we got a table in five minutes.My meal was absolutely delicious. Just one of those perfectly blended dishes. The side order of bacon was the biggest side order I've ever seen. Two of us couldn't finish it.I was jealous of my brunchmate's burger and might have to return just to have one.Oh and the bloody Marys are no joke. I can't wait to go back.The only downside was the tile and brick walls don't do anything to absorb sound, so it's a bit loud. Worth it though.",4.0
"Just after I posted this review - which generally praised the place, but for their indifference to the saltiness of the food - I got harassed by the owner and his staff, with vicious, foul email barrages. I had to block the garbage. Even more reason to avoid this place. Grow up, boys. And go away. Two stars for what would otherwise be three star food, docked because of the shockingly promiscuous use of SALT.Holy cow, was the food SALTY, to the point of being almost inedible. Really, folks. Your food has lots of promise, and seems to be mostly delicious, but some dishes are so salty as to be inedible. The ceviche shrimp was tasty and good sized. But the salt was excessive. Burratta was also too salty, with salty lox (not smoked salmon). Again, nearly though not quite inedible. Then the fried broccoli. So salty that we sent it back. Same for the nearly inedible lamb ribs, also close to inedible. What gives? Seriously. What are you doing? Is anyone in the kitchen actually paying attention? On the plus side, service was friendly, and it's right near the subway. But this is to be AVOIDED until the kitchen gets its act together.",1.0

"3rd times the charm... Been to Mayfield 3 times now and ready to roll out a solid review. It's a great, new American style spot. Let's start with the food.I had Fish and Chips twice (lame, right?). The fish is pollack--a solid choice, when fresh, and Mayfield's take delivers. Comes neatly topped on a big bowl of thin, crisp English-style fries, with a healthy serving of malt vinegar, ketchup, and tartar sauce (100). Thoroughly enjoyed the meal both times.Though none of the more creative menu offerings appealed to me personally, I don't always dine alone. Certain that my compadres enjoyed their more adventurous choosings. Some highlights included the Shrimp Ceviche and the Boar Belly entree. Solid beer choices; wines look alright, too.Service is not overly friendly, nor should it necessarily be. Their style's more on the side of solid and professional. Waitstaff as a whole is attentive and makes it happen.So, as you've probably gathered by this boring review, this is a solid, if slightly mundane spot buoyed up by its trendy, fun location. Perhaps it's telling that I can't, for the life of me, remember what I had the second time I ate there; but it's nonetheless a fun place to come with friends, drink some good beers and unwind. A solid 4 stars.",4.0

"OH MY GOSH! I was blown away by this beautiful restaurant which was right in my own backyard. My friend and I were starving after exploring the art exhibits during Target First Saturday at the Brooklyn Museum. We quickly searched Yelp for nearby restaurants which had a decent menu as well as dessert options. That is how we stumbled upon Mayfield. We were not prepared for the experience we had that evening. I ordered the burger since I wasn't interested with the other menu items due to my dietary restrictions. According to our server, it was the best burger in the City, so I was anxious to see whether it would live up to the hype. I have eaten at a quite a few burger joints as you will tell from the list I have in my profile, but my palette and my mind were pleasantly surprised by the symphony of flavors. First of all, the $15 Mayfield burger is HUGE. I had to figure out how to dig in, but when I did it was DELICIOUS. The ingredients included an egg? What on earth I thought, but it worked. The individual portion was crazy and it came with fries. Our appetite was more than satisfied and we somehow managed to make room for dessert since that was our original motive for dining at this establishment. I loved the space, great for couples, large groups, happy hour with colleagues, or to catch the game.",5.0
"This great spot just popped my Crown Heights restaurant cherry! The four block walk from the trains was fairly short, and that was during a very frigid night. The chef  was good enough to set up a prix-fixed 6 course dinner for my Oyster group of 12, and each plate was only better than the one before it.This was our menu that night:1st Course: Montauk Pearls (LI), Moon Shoals (MA), Kusshi (BC) 2nd Course: Cornmeal-fried Blue Points, house smoked salmon, celeriac remoulade, horseradish cream 3rd Course: Roasted Island Creeks, creamed chard, prosciutto chip, lemon sauce Choron (The favorite of the night!)4th Course: Oyster chowder, potato, scallion, jalapeno 5th Course: Buttermilk fried quail, spoon bread, collard greens 6th Course: Ricotta donuts, cinnamon sugar, Nutella The space itself is absolutely large once you step inside. The ambiance is dim and comfortable. The bar is large with lots of seating. They have an impressive craft beer list, wine, and original cocktail list. I had the Wild and Free which consisted of Gin, Montenegro, Grand Marnier, Honey, & Lime. Refreshing and tasty! The happy hour specials are ridiculously good- $1 oysters! How can you beat that?Despite the size of our group, the service was impeccable. Everyone was friendly, polite, and cleared plates without being too overbearing or intrusive. The chef came out a few times to check on us to see how we liked everything. We LOVED everything. Out of all the courses we were served, the group favorite was the Roasted Island Creeks with creamed chard, prosciutto chip,  w/ lemon sauce. We begged the chef to put that on the regular menu. Honestly, there was not one bad bite at this dinner, and their price points are amazing.Certainly a fantastic date spot, and they proved to me that they can handle large groups. I cannot wait until my next visit.",5.0
"I'm honestly conflicted with my ranking. I want to give more but my wait experience was unbelievable. My mom, ""twin"" and I stumbled into this nice establishment after a Black History Month Event at the Brooklyn Museum. The wait was approximately 30-45min, which is reasonable. So I signed us up around 8:40p. Standing patiently, we order a round of drinks at the bar. We see a table open, finally! The hostess sits two people at a four person table, which my party thought was for us. We were obviously ""hAngry,"" but it made no sense to wait at another establishment for an additional 40min. Her excuse was, they made their reservation late. Last I checked, we arrived before them and this party of 3 will fill this table with more hungry folks ready to chow down! We didn't get seated until 10:30p, an hour after our reserved text messaged time of 9:37p. Now onto the food and drinks! I had a nicely prepared rye old-fashioned. Mom had an organic amber ale and ""twin"" ordered the prosecco. We ordered rabbit confit as our appetizer. It was lovely, fell off the bone. Entrées were two burgers and a fully de-boned trout. Desserts were passion fruit sorbet, apple upside-down cake and ricotta donuts with nuttella. Damn those donuts were heaven!The meal was great! The ambiance got ""hood,"" only with their music.

"We went there for brunch and it was excellent. Very nice ambience and service. I ordered omelet which was good (not extraordinary in taste, but good and quite large). Home made fries were excellent.

"BEST NEW YEARS EVE DINNER :) Thank you so much. I booked a reservation last minute (day before/morning) for 7 people which they accommodated. The food was incredible, everyone loved everything. Big hits: duck pappardelle, the pork belly, and the fried chicken sandwich. Also, even though there was really only one vegetarian entree, my friend appreciated that it was inventive and interesting, not just a boring pasta dish like a lot of places. The cocktails were delicious, service attentive and not rushed. Really fun time. We had been for brunch many times but never dinner. Made me really wish I had brought my family here when they visited. We will be back soon!",5.0
"The service was beyond pleasing - friendly and attentive. Our waitress also memorized all our orders and we had no issues with receiving our food. I had the burger and it was GREAT! I will certainly come back. The serving was more than enough and I even shared with a friend with no issues. The fries have so much flavor. I will say not all meals are created equal, a friend ordered the ravioli and the serving was extremely small - thank god, he ordered an extra side.  My other friend raved about the spoon bread but wished the serving was bigger.",4.0
"Best oyster happy hour ever. I was expecting your average $1 oysters that I usually cover in cocktail sauce and mignonette, but NO. These were AWESOME. I'm coming every day. Obsessed. Also great beer and wine selection.",5.0

"OH MY GOSH! I was blown away by this beautiful restaurant which was right in my own backyard. My friend and I were starving after exploring the art exhibits during Target First Saturday at the Brooklyn Museum. We quickly searched Yelp for nearby restaurants which had a decent menu as well as dessert options. That is how we stumbled upon Mayfield. We were not prepared for the experience we had that evening. I ordered the burger since I wasn't interested with the other menu items due to my dietary restrictions. According to our server, it was the best burger in the City, so I was anxious to see whether it would live up to the hype. I have eaten at a quite a few burger joints as you will tell from the list I have in my profile, but my palette and my mind were pleasantly surprised by the symphony of flavors. First of all, the $15 Mayfield burger is HUGE. I had to figure out how to dig in, but when I did it was DELICIOUS. The ingredients included an egg? What on earth I thought, but it worked. The individual portion was crazy and it came with fries. Our appetite was more than satisfied and we somehow managed to make room for dessert since that was our original motive for dining at this establishment. I loved the space, great for couples, large groups, happy hour with colleagues, or to catch the game.",5.0
"This great spot just popped my Crown Heights restaurant cherry! The four block walk from the trains was fairly short, and that was during a very frigid night. The chef  was good enough to set up a prix-fixed 6 course dinner for my Oyster group of 12, and each plate was only better than the one before it.This was our menu that night:1st Course: Montauk Pearls (LI), Moon Shoals (MA), Kusshi (BC) 2nd Course: Cornmeal-fried Blue Points, house smoked salmon, celeriac remoulade, horseradish cream 3rd Course: Roasted Island Creeks, creamed chard, prosciutto chip, lemon sauce Choron (The favorite of the night!)4th Course: Oyster chowder, potato, scallion, jalapeno 5th Course: Buttermilk fried quail, spoon bread, collard greens 6th Course: Ricotta donuts, cinnamon sugar, Nutella The space itself is absolutely large once you step inside. The ambiance is dim and comfortable. The bar is large with lots of seating. They have an impressive craft beer list, wine, and original cocktail list. I had the Wild and Free which consisted of Gin, Montenegro, Grand Marnier, Honey, & Lime. Refreshing and tasty! The happy hour specials are ridiculously good- $1 oysters! How can you beat that?Despite the size of our group, the service was impeccable. Everyone was friendly, polite, and cleared plates without being too overbearing or intrusive. The chef came out a few times to check on us to see how we liked everything. We LOVED everything. Out of all the courses we were served, the group favorite was the Roasted Island Creeks with creamed chard, prosciutto chip,  w/ lemon sauce. We begged the chef to put that on the regular menu. Honestly, there was not one bad bite at this dinner, and their price points are amazing.Certainly a fantastic date spot, and they proved to me that they can handle large groups. I cannot wait until my next visit.",5.0
"I'm honestly conflicted with my ranking. I want to give more but my wait experience was unbelievable. My mom, ""twin"" and I stumbled into this nice establishment after a Black History Month Event at the Brooklyn Museum. The wait was approximately 30-45min, which is reasonable. So I signed us up around 8:40p. Standing patiently, we order a round of drinks at the bar. We see a table open, finally! The hostess sits two people at a four person table, which my party thought was for us. We were obviously ""hAngry,"" but it made no sense to wait at another establishment for an additional 40min. Her excuse was, they made their reservation late. Last I checked, we arrived before them and this party of 3 will fill this table with more hungry folks ready to chow down! We didn't get seated until 10:30p, an hour after our reserved text messaged time of 9:37p. Now onto the food and drinks! I had a nicely prepared rye old-fashioned. Mom had an organic amber ale and ""twin"" ordered the prosecco. We ordered rabbit confit as our appetizer. It was lovely, fell off the bone. Entrées were two burgers and a fully de-boned trout. Desserts were passion fruit sorbet, apple upside-down cake and ricotta donuts with nuttella. Damn those donuts were heaven!The meal was great! The ambiance got ""hood,"" only with their music. It was confusing to me for a warm decor like this to be playing club music and dimming the lights drastically after a certain time while people are trying to eat.

"Although I have travelled to more than thirty countries, I strangely have never been to Brooklyn until this May. My visit to Mayfield at Brooklyn was a pleasant surprise. The atmosphere, the food and the service were top-notch, and I will definitely return to the restaurant.First of all, Mayfield has a young, hip vibe, which makes it a great restaurant for both group dinners and dates. The simple and elegant decor definitely elevates the mood of the restaurant. Unlike other NYC restaurants, Mayfield gives a fair amount of space between tables and provides privacy to the diners. Second of all, the restaurant provides great food and drinks for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians. I loved the cauliflower custard - the cauliflower and the broccoli were crunchy on the outside and soft inside, the risotto was flavorful and the cauliflower custard's smooth texture complemented the dish well. My friend who is a regular customer at Mayfield enjoyed all the drinks she has there thus far.Third of all, both my friend and I were impressed by the service. My friend who was not used to eating Cuban meat only had a few bites of her Cuban Sandwich. The waitress immediately noticed that and offered to either bring her a different dish or take it off the check. My friend opted for the latter and was satisfied with the service. Mayfield is a gem at Brookyln, and I will definitely return to the restaurant and try the kale salad that seems to be a big hit here. Yelpers, come to this awesome restaurant!",4.0

The only soulful thing about this restaurant is their music which I thoroughly enjoyed. They played oldies but goodies..James Brown, The temptations etc.I ordered the eggs benedict which was pretty good. And my friends all seemed to enjoy their meals....quail with collards, fish and chips, and burger with fries.  The one miss is that they don't have any drink specials which is a big miss for me!!All in all, Mayfield is a solid restaurant. Nice location, friendly and attentive staff, good music, and good food. I probably wouldn't come back for brunch on my own because there are equally solid brunch spots with drink specials. However, I will be back to try their dinner menu...hopefully they have happy hour.",4.0
"Let's talk about the brunch. Drinks are small and expensive. Even the COFFEE is $4 and comes in like 4-6 oz servings that you will wait for and get very serious side eye if you ask for refills while waiting at the bar. You will definitely wait 30-45 minutes for a seat. If you are by the windows in the winter, it will be cute but you will DEFINITELY be cold. Avoid the omelets. The fillings are minimal and the egg is mostly tasteless. The poached eggs looked ok, but had a weird pink sauce on them that was apparently good, but looks well, weird. Basically, it's a basic brunch spot. You will have some brunch. It will be fine. It will be forgettable. You probably won't gush to your friends about it, but you probably won't feel that bad about it either. You will be exactly fine, like your fine brunch.",3.0

Dinner was brussels with chili sauce, totally scrumptious and a huge portion, then the gnocci with pork shoulder blew us both out of the water. Mouth watering gnocci and SO much pork! Yum.

The food is simple and delicious.  We started off with the fried oysters.  I wasn't blown away by them.  I thought they could use a bit more flavor but loved the idea that they were served on a bed of smoked salmon.  Buh-bye greens.  You're so 2012.  For my main entree I had the trout with fingerling potatoes that was finger licking good.  Perfect portions and lovely presentation. I even went the distance and had the apple upside down cake with a dollop of ice cream.  Perfect way to end a meal.  All this goodness was accompanied by several perfectly made gold rushes.Bravo Mayfield!

"I've been here a handful of times for brunch and twice for dinner, and all but one time I have been exceptionally happy with my food and drinks. The coffee at brunch is served in personal French press pots, which I thought was a very nice touch. I know that yogurt, granola and fresh fruit sounds like it would be a plain option, but honestly theirs is so good that I find it hard to branch out and try new things there on the brunch menu. The one thing I had that I didn't like, which they may or may not still have since I haven't been back for dinner in quite some time, was the fish and chips. They were just really lackluster and nowhere near the best I've had. That was disappointing, but otherwise this place is generally great with food.The interior is also really well-done. It's a great place to bring a date. Low-lit, clean lines, modern fixtures, but the wood makes it still feel nice and warm. I love the way that the bar is open to the kitchen - on more than one occasion I've gone in for drinks by myself and felt entertained by both watching the kitchen staff and talking to the bartender.

"I'm human, so I've been known to be an idiot from time to time, so as I write this review, I can admit that I didn't visit Mayfield with the most positive thoughts.

Well, it's conveniently located (I'm lazy),  I pride myself in being knowledgable about the neighborhood dining options (I'm greedy) and well...I didn't hit the 400 review mark from sitting at home snacking on TV dinners. The decor is cozy and comforting, much more open than the previous restaurant that lived at this location. Plus we learned that they are working on making over the backyard to allow for outdoor dining. Cool. One note of caution- check the menu out in advance. The entree menu is very limited with only 4 or 5 options, so this may not work with the picky eater. We started out with fried oysters that were placed over a bed of salmon. Quite tasty my friends. Most of the plates on the menu are actually small plates, but if you are hungry like me, you likely want to skip to the bottom of the page to the entree section. My friend had the trout (whole trout with head on) and I had the pork chop. Everything was really tasty and the portions were perfect for us, but you should not expect to have any leftovers. We spent around $160 dining for 2, but let's be honest 1/2 of that check was in support of our thirst for alcohol.",4.0

"Very pretty restaurant.  A welcome addition to the changing neighborhood, but still a bit rough around the edges.  Service was very friendly and warm.  The food and drinks weren't quite a hit, although you can tell the owners try quite hard.  Maybe time will see these things corrected.  I want very much to like this restaurant.  We'll be back a few times to see if we just chose poorly.  Maybe we went on an off day.A friend said he gave this restaurant 4/5 because it didn't have a bread basket.  I give it 3/5 because of the food and drinks.  I'd characterize the food, overall as ""OK"".  Not quite ""Meh"".  If I could, I'd give this restaurant 2.5 stars.Bellini: B-Watery.  Not much flavor.Bloody Mary: B-Wasn't my favorite.  I liked how spicy it was, but I thought it was too alcoholic.  I know some people would disagree with this sentiment, but the goal isn't to get drunk here.  The goal is to enjoy a drink.Coffee: DWhen they brought out French presses, our interest was piqued!  Nice!  Unfortunately for us, these 12oz French presses had one scoop of coffee whereas they should've had 2 or (preferably) 3 scoops of coffee.  It was watery and tasteless.  I hated the coffee.  To the waitresses credit, she said if we had complained about the coffee earlier she would've give us new, stronger coffee.  We just didn't complain about it until we were ready to leave.  As it was, she removed the coffee charges from the menu, which was greatly appreciated (but they should just serve stronger coffee rather than rely on complains from customers.)Tomato Soup with Cheddar Cheese Sandwich: B-My wife said neither soup nor sandwich stuck out.  Soup was blandish and sandwich wasn't vibrant or dynamic; it was something that could easily be cooked at home.  She described the sandwich as ""boring"" and the soup as ""meh"".Traditional Eggs Benedict: BNot nearly enough Hollandaise sauce.  We asked the waiter for extra sauce which she gladly did for free, but nevertheless, we shouldn't have had to ask for more to begin with.House Corned beef Tongue Hash: BNote quite a hash.  Probably more like tongue strips in potatoes as a side order to poached eggs.  As with the Eggs Benedict, there was not enough Hollandaise.  I asked for more, which the waitress was only too happy to give for free, but still, I shouldn't have asked for more to begin with.  There really wasn't enough sauce.",3.0

He had such a good time at the bar that he asked me to join him when I finally got home. I did and we got some snacks and drinks and it was fun. Ended up meeting a local chef sitting at the bar and he got us a round and then we got him one . It really felt like a neighborhood place that night. Final verdict? Happy hour is the time to go, but it ends by 6pm!!! I am never in time for that after my commute home and that bums me out. Still, it's a nice place and fun t hang at the bar.

"Nice, welcoming restaurant that serves wonderful food, prepared with care and great attention to ingredients. Great place for a low key date, to catch up with friends or family, or even to just catch a game at the bar[1] while having a beet and eating oysters.The people behind this restaurant are clearly ambitious: they put a lot of passion and thinking in bringing their idea to life, and in my view it paid off. You would have a hard time finding a fault in their execution.Named after singer Curtis Mayfield, the ambiance is certainly soulful, with exposed bricks, rustic wood floors, expandable wooden high-top tables, and Guastavino-like tile work on the open kitchen. Or the use of the power cords on the ceiling as a decorative geometric pattern. The feel is at the same time casual and sexy.The menu, divided between raw bar, veg, seafood, meat, sandwiches, entrees, and sides, is not going to win praise for originality; in the end, this is still mainly comfort food that should please everybody. However, things are kept interesting by a menu that rotates around seasonal ingredients.And certain dishes are actually surprising. Their take on fried chicken and collards, for example, features a buttermilk fried quail ($20). They make their own corned beef tongue, served with kraut and creamy grain mustard ($10). The roasted Brussels sprouts dish features Dante: an aged sheep's milk cheese from Wisconsin.The best dishes I've tried so far include:- Nantucket Bay scallops with smoked salmon and caviar cream over a Johnny cake ($16; a seasonal dish). Delicate and tasty.- The Berkshire pork chop saltimbocca[2] with caramelized onion farro and grilled radicchio ($22). A well executed porkchop: charred on the outside, nice and juicy on the inside. Also, I love radicchio!- Roasted Brussels sprouts with squash and picked mustard seeds ($10). As tasty and gratifying as it sounds.- Fried clam bellies with tartar and cocktail sauces ($13). Crisp on the outside, melt-in-your-mouth on the inside. Best late night dish I've had in months!For dessert, the apple upsidedown cake with ice cream and caramel ($6) is simple and tasty; enjoy it with a glass of Applejack from Laird & Co, as our bartender suggested. Cheese cake with graham cracker crumbles, pomegranate, and fig sauce was as surprisingly light as it was flavorful ($6).If there are a couple of things where Mayfiled can improve would be a more substantial list of beers on draft, and a bread basket. A good bread basket can go a long way in setting the mood of the table.Mayfield also features a really nice oyster happy hour: $1 Malpeque every day (weekend included!) 5-6:30pm. And they have some interesting (and affordable!) cocktails; my favorite being the Lord Byron[3].-------------------------------------------------[1] The TV is kept on mute, luckily.[2] This dish was a big surprise to me, since saltimbocca in Italian is a completely different dish: veal, prosciutto or ham, and sage, rolled-up and pan-seared.[3] Aptly described by the bartender as ""A Negroni on steroids"".",4.0
"It's the rare case that a restaurant gets better with age but somehow these chefs manage to pull it off.  Every dish that we had was flawlessly executed. The flavors were bold and nuanced. The mushroom ravioli sounded like a throwaway dish, and we ordered it for our toddler but we ended up fighting her for it shamelessly. Pork shank was fall off the bone tender. Even dessert here is perfection. Pineapple upside down cake tastes like your grandmother made it. And the cinnamon ice cream? OMG, it's a party in your mouth. Simple flavors perfectly executed.",5.0

"Just had one of the best meals I've ever had at Mayfield's. Sampled my friends dish, which was the prawns, ham, on top of a fried green tomato special. Absolutely amazing. And only $13. I would have paid more!!!Also had the scallops, asparagus risotto, and rock shrimp. Delicious. The one thing was the waiter was a little bit too pushy in trying to get my friend to order a meal. Came back to the table 4 times with only two minute breaks in between each time pressing her to make a decision. There were a number of tables that were completely empty, so it is not as if there was a queue of people waiting to be seated.  He needs to calm down. But all in all a fantastic meal.",5.0
"This place had been on my list for quite a while and I finally made it there last weekend for brunch.  Really enjoyed it.  We were a group of 4 adults and 2 toddlers, but as luck would have it, there was a 6-seater just waiting for us when we walked in.  Boom!Among us, we had the fried clam bellies (generously sized, lightly battered, delicious dipping sauce), the shredded kale salad (light, savory and delicious), the french toast (challahhhh!), the cuban sandwich (decadent and delicious, as it should be), a burger (juicy and well-appointed), and the fried quail (lightly battered, tender and delicious, but pretty small portion).  Everything was well received.  The bloody maries were good, there's a nice beer selection, and although the place was slammed, the service was polite and attentive.  I liked the vibe of the place, which is lively and cool, but not over the top with flannel, hunting boots, beards or tattoos.I'd definitely return here, particularly for brunch, and recommend it highly.",4.0

I went for brunch and chose their French toast which was delicious! I wasn't the only one who was happy. Because everyone on the table enjoyed their meals as well.

"Add Mayfield to the list of new additions to Crown Heights. My boyfriend and I ate here during the week of Hurricane Sandy, when everyone was off from work and had cabin fever. Mayfield had recently opened and was packed. The service was sparse but that was due to the weather. We both had the burger which was tasty.We decided to try them again before making any other judgments and we got our chance on New Years Eve. We had some oysters to start and I had the PEI mussels and fries. As others have said this dish is flawless--the broth was rich and there were plenty of mussels, and it came with two flavorful pieces of bread. My man-friend had the octopus and he ate every bite. We also got the lemon cheesecake to top off the evening. Our waitress was friendly and attentive and even gave us a bit of bubbly so we could toast to 2013. I like how easily Mayfield transitions from a fancy restaurant to a causal bar, and they were playing great 70's hits (before my time, I know, but I can still enjoy them). The price point is higher than most places in the neighborhood but I think it is fair given how Mayfield presents itself. I definitely want to stop by more often for a drink or two. Glad to have you around, Mayfield!",4.0
"I really wanted to like Mayfield, but after two visits I have concluded that I don't like this place.  I didn't feel welcomed, service was substandard, and the food lacked flavor. Both visits were during brunch, and it wasn't crowded either visit, so getting seated was no problem.  The menu offered fish and chips and shrimp and grits but I wanted fish and grits.  I was told I couldn't have it that way, and there are no substitutions off the brunch menu.  What kind of one trick pony chefs does Mayfield employee that can't mix and match meals?  Or maybe it's not the chefs but management not wanting the hassle of figuring out the cost; but is it really that difficult? No problem, I order an omelet with egg whites, spinach, onions and mushrooms.  When my food arrived there was no fold over, and the contents of my omelet was simply covered by the bland eggs. The spinach salad looked just like the spinach that was supposed to be in my egg omelet.  I didn't eat it.  A waiter comes and asks if I'm done.  To which I reply yes. He removed an entire plate of food and never asked if everything was ok?  No problem.  Empty glass on the table no one asks if I would like another drink.  OK.  I requested another drink with the guy who removed my meal, and he never returned to say how long it would take.  The original waitress walks by so I ask her about the drink and she says in addition to the one you already ordered?  Kind of snippy I thought considering there was no follow up by her or the guy who removed my plate.  Little thing called service is why you go out to eat, or is it?  There are so many new places to eat in Crown Heights don't waste your time on Mayfield.  Actually, it won't be hard for you to miss the place considering the lack of signage on the exterior. Keep on walking, you'll be glad you did.The one star is for the ambience.",1.0

Great place for a low key date, to catch up with friends or family, or even to just catch a game at the bar[1] while having a beet and eating oysters.The people behind this restaurant are clearly ambitious: they put a lot of passion and thinking in bringing their idea to life, and in my view it paid off.

"After spending a long day in Brooklyn, I decided I'd like to eat somewhere that wasn't in Williamsburg.  After Yelping some places in Bushwick and Bedstuy, my friend and I settled on Mayfield in Crown Heights.  Prior to this visit, I don't think I'd ever set foot in Crown Heights so it was cool to see such a mixed crowd of old and new Brooklyn.  I especially appreciate when a good restaurant takes a chance and opens in an area that doesn't have 234509874350987 other trendy restaurants, so Mayfield already earned some cool points from me.The decor here was pretty cool.  Exposed brick, super high ceilings, very industrial chic like many restaurants these days.  The staff was very friendly and attentive, so that was a plus.  Also, the hostess was wearing what can only be described as a clown shirt with leggings underneath.  I understand this is Brooklyn, but you just can't throw leggings on and a clown shirt and think that shit's cool (it's not).Started the meal with the kale salad and I was not mad at it.  The kale and the apples were shredded, topped with bread crumbs, pine nuts, and a light vinaigrette.  Definitely different, but enjoyable.  After that we decided to split the burger and a pasta dish. Their burger was definitely a solid restaurant burger.  It was pretty big too, probably 6 - 8 oz and packed loosely which is always good.  It came with standard toppings (lettuce, onion, tomato) and some decent skinny fries.  As good as the dish was, it just lacked that wow factor.  That thing that makes you want to tell your friends about it.The hand rolled tagliatelle on the other hand, was phenomenal.  It had a corn puree mixed in as the sauce and was topped with lam bacon, a fried egg, and summer truffles.  Heaven!  Although the pasta was slightly too al dente, it tasted so damned good I just kept right on eating.  This definitely had that wow factor that the rest of the meal lacked and for $14 is a definite steal.Overall, I would definitely come back to Mayfield.  This place has a lot going for it, but through the whole dinner all I could think of was the lobster roll I had earlier that day from the Red Hook Lobster Pound stand at the Brooklyn Flea.  That's never a good sign.",3.0
"I live a block away from this place and have eaten here a lot (usually about once a week for several months). It's a great neighborhood spot, although often quite crowded and with a sizable wait at peak meal times. For your best experience, timing is something to keep in mind.My favorite things on the menu are the sandwiches, and they're the things I've had the most. The burger is the heartiest of them--it's quite large, and most of that is the beef. You can add bacon, cheese and/or fried egg if you want, no extra charge. (Sometimes they forget to tell you that.) The fried chicken sandwich (it's made of thighs that have been pounded out, as best I can tell) and Cuban aren't as meaty, but they're all generously sized and delicious. They all come with more fries than I've ever been able to eat.

"Came for dinner on a Monday. The food was good, but not overly exciting. The beef tongue was served with sauerkraut and mustard which complemented the tongue nicely. The Cuban was a huge crispy, toasted shell encompassing oozing fatty, cheesy goodness.Overall, I liked the atmosphere, and the food was great, but it just feels like more of a neighborhood place and not worth going out of your way for.

"There are a lot of great choices for food in Crown Heights but my husband and I come back here again and again. The food is excellent with a wide variety of choices (from hearty main courses to southern-based sides) to suite your needs. They have an excellent selection of spirits behind the bar. The servers are pretty nice (apart from one awful hostess with a god-complex...), and know the menu well. I also like the decor which goes an extra mile with the regular ""Brooklyn distressed/heritage theme."" Bonus points for the music, which is always spot on and fun.",5.0
"After spending a long day in Brooklyn, I decided I'd like to eat somewhere that wasn't in Williamsburg.  After Yelping some places in Bushwick and Bedstuy, my friend and I settled on Mayfield in Crown Heights.  Prior to this visit, I don't think I'd ever set foot in Crown Heights so it was cool to see such a mixed crowd of old and new Brooklyn.  I especially appreciate when a good restaurant takes a chance and opens in an area that doesn't have 234509874350987 other trendy restaurants, so Mayfield already earned some cool points from me.The decor here was pretty cool.  Exposed brick, super high ceilings, very industrial chic like many restaurants these days.  The staff was very friendly and attentive, so that was a plus.  Also, the hostess was wearing what can only be described as a clown shirt with leggings underneath.  I understand this is Brooklyn, but you just can't throw leggings on and a clown shirt and think that shit's cool (it's not).Started the meal with the kale salad and I was not mad at it.  The kale and the apples were shredded, topped with bread crumbs, pine nuts, and a light vinaigrette.  Definitely different, but enjoyable.  After that we decided to split the burger and a pasta dish. Their burger was definitely a solid restaurant burger.  It was pretty big too, probably 6 - 8 oz and packed loosely which is always good.  It came with standard toppings (lettuce, onion, tomato) and some decent skinny fries.  As good as the dish was, it just lacked that wow factor.  That thing that makes you want to tell your friends about it.The hand rolled tagliatelle on the other hand, was phenomenal.  It had a corn puree mixed in as the sauce and was topped with lam bacon, a fried egg, and summer truffles.  Heaven!  Although the pasta was slightly too al dente, it tasted so damned good I just kept right on eating.  This definitely had that wow factor that the rest of the meal lacked and for $14 is a definite steal.Overall, I would definitely come back to Mayfield.  This place has a lot going for it, but through the whole dinner all I could think of was the lobster roll I had earlier that day from the Red Hook Lobster Pound stand at the Brooklyn Flea.  That's never a good sign.",3.0
"I live a block away from this place and have eaten here a lot (usually about once a week for several months). It's a great neighborhood spot, although often quite crowded and with a sizable wait at peak meal times. For your best experience, timing is something to keep in mind.My favorite things on the menu are the sandwiches, and they're the things I've had the most. The burger is the heartiest of them--it's quite large, and most of that is the beef. You can add bacon, cheese and/or fried egg if you want, no extra charge. (Sometimes they forget to tell you that.) The fried chicken sandwich (it's made of thighs that have been pounded out, as best I can tell) and Cuban aren't as meaty, but they're all generously sized and delicious. They all come with more fries than I've ever been able to eat. So does the fish and chips, which is similarly tasty and over-large.My favorite appetizer is the fried broccoli, which sounds weird but is somehow actually great?

They also gave us a side of popcorn (not sure if that was part of the ceviche, but it was pretty stale so we didn't really eat it).For appetizers, I had the manilla clams, which came with chorizo and a few prawns. Super delicious and hearty.I also got a chance to try the buttermilk fried quail, which was even better. A bit on the salty side, but it was fried perfectly and you could definitely taste the quail meat.

"First of, I'd like to say how much it breaks my heart to write this review. Second of, I will probably be back to Mayfield....that out of the way I just want to talk about the only fish(not shell fish) dish they have on the menu. It's the trout with the potatoes. The fish is salty and a little blend. BUT, It is well cooked(baked/grilled) but that's where it ends for me. I like salt but this is way too much. Then there's the lemon. If I find one more pit of lemon inside my fish, I'm gonna freak out!! Worse than the pit is the slice of lemon. WTH! I don't want to come across that in my food!! It does not improve the taste AT ALL...fortunately for them I cannot give the bad without the good....the potatoes are great(the ones that don't touch the salty fish sauce). The wine list is definitely up to par and the pot de crême temps me(I don't like sweets). Come here, have everything else. If you want fish, you have been warned!

"If you needed any further proof that Franklin on this side of Eastern Parkway has officially become the new Smith Street, this place will put the issue to rest for good. It turns out it winds up being the representation of this in the good way!  The food is delicious, I've been several times and always enjoyed everything Ive gotten.  A must order is the houses superlative version of southern  Spoon Bread, its consistency and amazing point somewhere between biscuit and pudding.  Its probably best to get it with the delicious fried quail, done in full on southern fried chicken fashion, albeit in miniature.  Even if you don't get the quail, make sure you order the Spoon Bread a la carte as a side, its that good.  Octopus, served alongside pork belly on my most recent visit, was perfectly cooked, not overly chewy or rubbery, always a good indicator of skilled hands in the kitchen.  All the vegetables/salads, like an effervescent kale salad and creamy beet salad, were uniformly excellent and unique.       The space is impressive and it would have perhaps been impossible for even the most aggressive gentrifier to believe it would be found on this strip 5 years ago.  Its huge, spacious and sleek, done up in all light wood.   A striking, long handsome bar   with a solitary TV tucked up in the corner showing sports adding a little casualness to the proceedings, leads to a fantastic looking open kitchen,.  Service has been pretty solid every time.  One thing the place could definitely improve is the drinks, they are minuscule, @ least 2 dollars too expensive and decidedly not tasty.  One drink in particular, better & better tastes like you would imagine window cleaner might.  Maybe stick to beer and wine for the time being, but nevertheless come here for an enjoyable meal in a shockingly upscale joint.  This place is great news for anyone looking for yet another good meal option in this area, and yet more bad news for any of the areas renters who surely saw their rents skyrocketing even more when this place opened.",4.0
"Brunch goodness all around! I really enjoy this place, because unlike so many other locations in this grand city, the portions are nice and big. I really hate going out to eat in order to need to go out to eat again after. They have some of the creamiest grits. I usually order the poached eggs (which is basically eggs benedict with a cumin-y sauce instead of bechamel and crunchy grit patties replacing the english muffins) and even with grit cakes on my actual dish, I still order a bowl of grits on the side (if they have them). I've also tried the shrimp and grits--the shrimp unfortunately had seen fresher days, so I never ordered it again. The drinks are strong and the servers are usually always pleasant (working the brunch shift is stressful, so god bless 'em for holding it down with a smile). My only gripe is that it can get mighty cold if you're sitting on the left side of the restaurant. The vents for the A/C blow directly on everyone sitting across from them, so plan to bring a scarf or something to throw over your shoulders, and you'll be just fine.",4.0

I am not hesitating on the five stars. And I am not a five star guy.  The sea scallops were cooked perfectly.  That is a rarity to be sure. The bed of shrimp-scamp risotto took it over the top. Splendidly briny fresh oysters.  I could go on. My wife insists the ambiance down to the graphic design of the menu drew us way in to the elegant AND homey interior.  Yes we also had the steak tartar.  The bartender topped us off with an Italian digestif that took it all down with silky perfumed rightness.  Check it out.,5.0

A bit greasy, but yummy.- Fish and chips: Considering we'd just had some amazing fish and chips a few weeks before at Docklands, it was hard not to compare. These fell a little short, but not by much. My husband always gets the BLT as he says it's the best he's ever had. Can't wait to keep going back and trying new things!",5.0

It turns out it winds up being the representation of this in the good way!  The food is delicious, I've been several times and always enjoyed everything Ive gotten.  A must order is the houses superlative version of southern  Spoon Bread, its consistency and amazing point somewhere between biscuit and pudding.  Its probably best to get it with the delicious fried quail, done in full on southern fried chicken fashion, albeit in miniature.  Even if you don't get the quail, make sure you order the Spoon Bread a la carte as a side, its that good.  Octopus, served alongside pork belly on my most recent visit, was perfectly cooked, not overly chewy or rubbery, always a good indicator of skilled hands in the kitchen.  All the vegetables/salads, like an effervescent kale salad and creamy beet salad, were uniformly excellent and unique.       The space is impressive and it would have perhaps been impossible for even the most aggressive gentrifier to believe it would be found on this strip 5 years ago.  Its huge, spacious and sleek, done up in all light wood.   A striking, long handsome bar   with a solitary TV tucked up in the corner showing sports adding a little casualness to the proceedings, leads to a fantastic looking open kitchen,.  Service has been pretty solid every time.  One thing the place could definitely improve is the drinks, they are minuscule, @ least 2 dollars too expensive and decidedly not tasty.  One drink in particular, better & better tastes like you would imagine window cleaner might.  Maybe stick to beer and wine for the time being, but nevertheless come here for an enjoyable meal in a shockingly upscale joint.  This place is great news for anyone looking for yet another good meal option in this area, and yet more bad news for any of the areas renters who surely saw their rents skyrocketing even more when this place opened.",4.0
"Brunch goodness all around! I really enjoy this place, because unlike so many other locations in this grand city, the portions are nice and big. I really hate going out to eat in order to need to go out to eat again after. They have some of the creamiest grits. I usually order the poached eggs (which is basically eggs benedict with a cumin-y sauce instead of bechamel and crunchy grit patties replacing the english muffins) and even with grit cakes on my actual dish, I still order a bowl of grits on the side (if they have them). I've also tried the shrimp and grits--the shrimp unfortunately had seen fresher days, so I never ordered it again. The drinks are strong and the servers are usually always pleasant (working the brunch shift is stressful, so god bless 'em for holding it down with a smile). My only gripe is that it can get mighty cold if you're sitting on the left side of the restaurant. The vents for the A/C blow directly on everyone sitting across from them, so plan to bring a scarf or something to throw over your shoulders, and you'll be just fine.",4.0
"Favorite place in the area. I've been for Brunch and dinner several times, and it's always been great. The omelette might have been the most well constructed, solid piece of egg I've ever had. The corned beef tongue is especially delicious. The brunch bartender, Sean, is an awesome, very friendly guy.",5.0
I am not hesitating on the five stars. And I am not a five star guy.  The sea scallops were cooked perfectly.  That is a rarity to be sure. The bed of shrimp-scamp risotto took it over the top. Splendidly briny fresh oysters.  I could go on. My wife insists the ambiance down to the graphic design of the menu drew us way in to the elegant AND homey interior.  Yes we also had the steak tartar.  The bartender topped us off with an Italian digestif that took it all down with silky perfumed rightness.  Check it out.,5.0
"It's hard to fault this place. The staff is friendly and works their butts off. The food is solid. They have good Happy Hour specials including $5 drafts and $1 oysters. The restaurant itself is really adorable and they have a nice little patio in the back. (And free refills on sodas!)I've tried the following from their menu:- Fluke ceviche: Refreshing and delicious, perfect for summer- Sweet pea ravioli in parmesan broth: Very tasty, but nothing too memorable- Hamburger: Comes with unlimited toppings and is GIANT. A bit greasy, but yummy.- Fish and chips: Considering we'd just had some amazing fish and chips a few weeks before at Docklands, it was hard not to compare. These fell a little short, but not by much. My husband always gets the BLT as he says it's the best he's ever had. Can't wait to keep going back and trying new things!",5.0
Awesome! Love the vibe and the food is warm and good! I went there last night for my birthday! The chef was very welcoming and made my night ! Thank you again!,5.0
"The vibe at Mayfield is super chill and inviting, and it looked exactly as I hoped it would when I walked through the doors - dim lighting, exposed brick, the pub version of a big ole hug. I knew my friend had picked just the right spot for us to sip a couple of beers and catch up. But, admittedly, something peeved me a little - and I realize that it could just be a personal preference, so forgive my subjectivity. When we asked for a table for 2, the hostess told us it would be 10-15 minutes. I immediately noticed that right in front of us were 4 completely empty tables, each with room for 4 people. Now, if there were one or two tables like this free, I wouldn't have thought twice about it. But 4? I couldn't wait to see the party of 16 that was about to fill those seats!After 10 minutes waiting for a seat at the full bar, we snagged a pair and settled into some drinks. I got Crispin cider (I'm still on my cider kick y'all) and she got a Pilsner. After another 10 minutes at the bar, we gave up on waiting for a table and decided to eat at the bar. Right as we were about to order (20 minutes in), the hostess asked us if we wanted to move to a table (isn't that how it always goes?), but at that point we stuck to the bar. I mean at the end of the day, it's all tables, right? The bartender was super sweet, attentive and helpful in helping us pick drinks. I got the burger and fries which were awesome (the fries were addictive and came with a yummy spicy mayo), and my friend's cauliflower custard looked intriguing, but I was too much of a wuss to try it. She highly recommended it though! By the time we left, none of those 4 tables of 4 were ever filled - except for one. With a party of two.",3.0
"2 words: FOOD POISONING. And other 2 words: HORRIBLE MANAGEMENT. Let me tell you my story, I promise it's worth a read:I ate here with 2 friends a couple weeks ago. We then parted ways, and didn't see each other or eat together again. About 24 hours later, all 3 of us were up ALL NIGHT with the worse food poisoning we've ever had. I've gotten sick in 3rd world countries, and this was worse. All 3 of us were up all night and the entire next day - I'll save the graphic detail but we were camped out in our respective bathrooms.I went back to speak with the owner, because I wanted him to know what was happening to avoid getting other people sick. His response was: there was a stomach flu going around, in fact he discovered that many of his staff had it. I told him (based on the irrefutable evidence above) that his restaurant was 100% responsible for getting us horribly sick (whether through rotten food, sickly staff, or both), and asked what he intended to do to make it up. The least he could do was comp our meal. He said there's no way he could do that, since he didn't have full proof that his restaurant had caused our illness.That is just not how you run a business. When you have customers who live in the neighborhood, have come to your new establishment several times, then you get them deathly ill, cause them to miss days of work, etc., you TAKE RESPONSIBILITY and do something to make it up to them. How incredibly stingy to not just say ""Wow I'm so sorry that happened, sure you can have your 60 bucks back and I hope you'll try us again in the future.""I will never eat here again, I will recommend that everyone I know to avoid this place, and I am filing a complaint with the NYC Dept. of Health. If you've ever had food poisoning this bad, you'd understand why I'm going to such great lengths to save people from it in the future.",1.0

"My friends and I came here for dinner on a weeknight, and we took advantage of their great happy hour (half priced drafts, woo!), and then sat down to order food. Unfortunately, the great value didn't extend to the food menu, but I enjoyed the offerings anyway. I opted for the cauliflower custard entree, which came with caramelized onion farro and roasted broccoli. Although it sounded like health food, the custard was extremely rich and definitely satisfied me. Others at the table got the corned beef tongue plate, the brussels sprouts, and the spoon bread as a side. The brussels sprouts really are just brussels, though they are delicious, so be aware that it won't be a real meal. Basically, my friends found that the portions of the non-entrees were delicious but small, and afterwards we went to a pizza place since they were still hungry.",3.0
"Went last night for dinner. First thing - they have an automated reservation system so you can go down the street for a drink while you wait!The food was delivious.

"I live very nearby and have been here for brunch, dinner, and drinks multiple times. It's a nice, ""upscale"" establishment, but I've  had a different experience every time. The inconsistency is annoying, given the price point and generally how the place has tried to position themselves in the neighborhood. Best experience- friendly, casual brunch with attentive but not overbearing service. I had the beef tongue hash and bloodies. My spouse had the burger and beers.Worst experience- this past NYE we met a friend at the bar for drinks at 7 pm. He ordered two Widow Jane ryes on the rocks. His bill was $34. We were certain it was a mistake and asked the bartender, who told us that the charge was correct and it was their top shelf....  A straight up lie. We regularly order this elsewhere on the street and it costs no more than $10.  I'm currently writing this review from Catfish, a block away, where they charge $8 for a pour of Widow Jane rye. We were certain the pricing issue at Mayfield was just a mistake in their computer system, but we were too classy to push the bartender on his lie. It did, however, sully my opinion of this place forever. This place can be sometimes be decent, and their bathrooms are pretty, but generally I have other faves on Franklin Ave where we go for a consistent and honest experience. I would never take friends from out of town or out of the neighborhood here because you're taking the risk of it sucking and/or the bartender being dishonest.",2.0

The pine nuts really did it. Simply delicious!I would go back just for that. And maybe the French toast too.",4.0

Anyway, back to Mayfield. Service was attentive despite the # of diners. Food was satisfying. I had the cuban sandwich w fries. It was sweeter than I'm accustomed to, but it had a good ratio of meat to bread to sides. My friend had the fried oysters. We split the brussel sprouts - the mustard seeds were tasty.

"We had dinner at Mayfield on a weekday. Happy hour includes beer and dollar oysters which were great. The Brown derby cocktail was excellent! Unfortunately, That's where the good ends.Waited for the food for over 40 minutes while the place was practically empty. The work in the kitchen was visibly idle. As for the food, it was mostly mediocre. The crab meat soup was mostly cream--imagine eating a bowl of warm cream with some crab meat in the center.The brussels sprouts were the best part of the dinner: warm, crispy and lots of flavor but the portion was miniature. For their price you would expect a more substantial portion size. The lamb chili was ok, with the major complaint being it that it was over salted.Overall, I would recommend Mayfield for happy hour and oysters but would not order anything beyond that.",2.0

"Every time I come to Mayfields I'm treated to great food, great ambiance and a great and accommodating staff! A great spot for brunch but equally as delish for dinner, a few stellar dishes to try are the fish and chips, the kale salad, brussel sprouts and their venison stew, which might just be the best thing I've ever tried there! Perfect for a date or when you're just in the mood to throw back a couple of drinks with your friends, Mayfields is the bar you can go to when you want reliable service, spectacular meals and an all around good time:)",4.0
"A really nice, open restaurant with a good brunch.  The prices are very reasonable and they serve individual french press coffee which was a nice treat. The service was a little slow, but our waitress was nice and made up for the wait. Also, there's a cute little patio out back that I want to check out next time. All around, good brunch menu, nice presentation and spacious open dining area made me very happy.",4.0
"We had dinner at Mayfield on a weekday. Happy hour includes beer and dollar oysters which were great. The Brown derby cocktail was excellent! Unfortunately, That's where the good ends.Waited for the food for over 40 minutes while the place was practically empty. The work in the kitchen was visibly idle. As for the food, it was mostly mediocre. The crab meat soup was mostly cream--imagine eating a bowl of warm cream with some crab meat in the center.The brussels sprouts were the best part of the dinner: warm, crispy and lots of flavor but the portion was miniature. For their price you would expect a more substantial portion size. The lamb chili was ok, with the major complaint being it that it was over salted.Overall, I would recommend Mayfield for happy hour and oysters but would not order anything beyond that.",2.0
"This is an awesome place for lunch. For $13 you get a large meal and a beer/wine and $1 oysters on top of that. The vibe is cool, decor is sweet and the food hits the spot. I went in a group recently and all the red meat was cooked to the correct temperature,  so kudos to the cook. Loved the skinny fries, steak sandwich, fish sandwich, burger, and the tongue.",5.0

"Came to happy hour here on a Monday and got some oysters and drinks. Everything is pretty standard stuff, but what was nice was just how cheap things were for happy hour. Oysters were $1 each and drinks were $4. The quality was OK, but considering it was so cheap, it was worth it (although I don't know if it would've been worth the money had it been regular time). I've never really tried oysters before, but it was decent although the size of the oyster was pretty small.Anyway, will be back to check out the rest of the menu. I love the ambiance here - it's literally a hole in the wall, and sort of reminds me of a speakeasy because the entrance is difficult to notice and easy to miss. It's nice and cozy inside, and the staff is pretty personable.",3.0

"I've been to Mayfield's twice and both times were stellar! The ambiance and the food did not disappoint. Service was perfectly in tune with my mood both times - need more direction and just enough attention. The restaurant made great decisions on their interior design and musical selections. I very much appreciate the hints of art deco and jamming to ""Luchini"" by Camp Lo over dessert.The first time I had dinner and I was seated in the back close to the kitchen. My friend and I decided to celebrate our new fortunes that night. We shared the kale salad and grilled octopus. Score! Kale salad was fresh, light and had the perfect texture and acidity. Octopus was cooked perfectly! Not chewy, well-seasoned and complemented by an unexpected combination of proteins. Unfortunately, they ran out of venison, so we opted for the Grilled Pork Chop -- another star dish...the pork / ribs were moist and tender, yes...lip-smacking hella yum. We definitely felt the Southern comfort with grit cakes and sauteed greens. Lastly, we had the chocolat pot de creme for dessert ... we were much too polite, next visit we'd get our own.The second time I also went for dinner, this time, I sat at the bar. I was in the mood for an entree that was hearty and under $20. I opted for the lamb ragout with pappardelle. The sauce was full of flavor, meaty with lamb and the pasta was cooked to perfection, gentle and firm enough you want to cradle it with your fork and eat it for two hours as long as it stayed warm. Unfortunately I did not have two hours to spare, but in the brief time I was there, my ears were graced with Motown.Love the food, people, food, decor, food and music.

Totally worth it! The drinks are strong, the bread is delicious. The oysters (you can choose from RI, MA, or CA) are on point, and the food is just...incredible. I had the pork chops...the consistency was they fell right off the bone like a perfect rib. And I also had the squash ravioli...amazing. You can't find food like this anywhere else.

"Solid restaurant.  Nice decor... warm, but not stuffy.  Think American, earthy minimalist... Anyway... Sat at the bar and had the kale salad and the trout.  LOVED the kale salad... I eat a LOT of kale salad and this was one of the better ones that I've had. Salty, tangy, lots of tasty cheese, the right amount of sweetness from the apples, perfectly shredded kale... yum.  They give you a pretty hefty portion. The salad and one of the small plates could easily be a meal.    My girlfriend had the octopus with the pork belly and white beans.  It looked amazing. I will definitely have to try that next time I go. For my entree I ordered the grilled trout.  I asked for it without the Bearnaise sauce, so it was essentially just grilled trout with a few roasted potatoes. Delicious. The fish was stuffed with some lemon and tarragon. I appreciated the fact that they were able to get so much flavor into the fish instead of relying only on the sauce.  Really nice. The servers were very nice.  I'm on a restricted diet, and they didn't seem that annoyed with me 5 million questions. Very solid dining experience, no complaints here.",4.0
"I could care less about the food, I only care about the bathroom. Mayfield gets a solid 4 stars from me and I'll tell you why. Nice and spacious restroom with a nice decor. The water mixture was just right and the hot was not too hot, yet not too cold. There was also a speaker playing music in there which I consider a plus. It shows that extra thought was put into the planing of the bathroom, as it should be. The only negative I really have is the amount of water on the floor around the sink, that is how bacteria thrives and can spread. The soap dispenser was functional as was the paper towel dispensing set up. The trash can's foot opening kick peddle was working which seems to be a rarity these days.

"I'm so glad that my husband, our little girl and I were able to eat at Mayfield during our visit to Brooklyn last week.  We loved Mayfield--everything about it.  From the simple yet really nice decor and feel of the restaurant to the food and the service staff.  We arrived at happy hour (about 30 minutes before dinner time).  We started off with 6 oysters and a couple of their draft beers.  We ordered 6 additional oysters and would have kept ordering more if I didn't have my heart set on the buttermilk fried quail (which was amazing--the quail itself was seasoned and breaded lightly and to perfection.  But my fave on the plate was the spoon bread....oh my--just a puff of buttery goodness.   Before the quail, my husband and I split the Grilled Octopus appetizer-it was served with Glazed Berkshire Pork Belly, White Beans, & Arugula..I think we devoured it in like 30 seconds.....so good! For dinner, my husband had the Berkshire Maple Blt and he loved it.  We swapped tastes and were both equally pleased with the other persons plate.  Unfortunately, we had no room in our bellies for dessert but hopefully on our next trip:).Lastly, I want to acknowledge the staff for being so kind and friendly and most importantly for being patient with our little girl.  She's 16 months old and has recently developed a disdain for sitting down so although she's behaved and adorable, she still on the loose and at times might get in the way.  The restaurant was pretty quiet when we got there so initially we were the only table which made it a little easier.  As the restaurant got a little busier, we tried to eat a little quicker in hopes of getting our busy bee out of there before she wreaked too much havoc on the place.  The waitstaff was so wonderful about it, all of them playfully acknowledged her and didn't seem to mind an additional helper.  I waited tables for over 10 years so I know that it takes a certain personality and atmosphere to make people feel welcome and Mayfield did just that.  Thank you!

Went in for a quick lunch before an appointment. Great service and friendly staff. I had the oyster po boy minus the bread. Great meal but why minus one star?

"Any time you find a place in a liminal neighborhood that tries to serve you half a grapefruit for $5, you know where that neighborhood is headed. The food at Mayfield is good. It is not special. You are paying a premium to pretend you are eating somewhere that is not Crown Heights. The dim lighting, exposed brick, cloth napkins and thoughtful tile applications are a harbinger of a neighborhood soon doomed to be overtaken by an army of tasteful, inoffensive yet interchangeable new American restaurants - each fated to feature a massaged kale salad and the occasional special on blue point oysters.",3.0
"After a couple of failed attempts at visiting Mayfield, I was finally able to get there! The ambiance is lovely, with dim lights (especially past 8:00), loud jazzy music, and an old-meets-new combination of exposed brick, dark wood, and smooth tile.I was a little confused at first by the menu, which our gracious server was happy to explain. She said that the two pastas as well as the dishes labeled ""entrees"" are, indeed, entrees, and that the rest were more of a small-plates style. I ordered the Mussels, which came with a few toasty pieces of bread and had plenty of vegetables and mushrooms in the broth, making it more than just a dipping sauce. I also ordered a side of Spoonbread, not knowing what it was, only to fall in love with it one bite at a time. My DP ordered the Kale Salad, which was extremely tangy and bright and a surprisingly large portion. The kale was finely chopped with pine nuts and apples, making it very easy to eat. No big pieces of greens flopping all over the place. He also ordered the Chicken Liver Mousse, which is basically a mini mason jar of pate served alongside a few crostini. Perfect for a sharing situation but not so much for an entree... we can't say we weren't warned!Service was friendly and attentive, and there are about a dozen other menu items that I can't wait to try next time!",4.0
"Only been here for BRUNCH, since dinner items are a bit odd. I got the benedict and it was good. The place is huge, no wait for a seat unless you come here in a large group. The coffee is a little weird here. It's French press, but looks kind of watery.",4.0
"Holy mother of God.How has this place not blown up like Barboncino...the dinner I just had was better than any I have ever eaten. And I promise you, nobody eats more than I do. I started with the house wine, which could have been ""not just the house wine,"" and tasted somewhere between fine and good. At $6 for the happy hour price, it was delectable.Then I had the shredded kale salad. I like to pretend to be a health nut, but deep down I think kale tastes like grocery bags just like everybody else. But this shit was BANANAS. What did they do?I finished with the scallops. Nobody likes scallops! They're like snails without the snobbish reputation, and the only reason people eat snails is to achieve a snobbish reputation. But these were amazing! The green risotto, who knows what that flavor was supposed to be, was good, fine, nice, but it was the mushrooms that really ""tied the room together"" and made me go nuts.***I just read this review and wondered, why did I order two foods I don't even like?",5.0
"Burger is a real value with fried egg, bacon, onions and cheese. Very good portion with tasty fries. Fried quail, on the other hand, is a really skimpy portion. I know that quail is a small bird, and I appreciate the attempt to push the envelope, but there just isn't enough meat on the bones to justify the price, or, more importantly, to feel full. My wife isn't a big eater and even she didn't feel satisfied with the portion. The fried batter was excellent, however: light and crispy. Atmosphere is raucous even when half-empty due to the acoustics. Might not be a good date place for that reason. But the interior LOOKS great. Staff was very friendly and service was good. We'll give it another shot and try some of the other food. Maybe if we had the BLT or some other more filling/better value dish, we could bump it up another star.",3.0

"I never write reviews on Yelp - but I just had to write a negative review resulting from a bad experience elsewhere. So chiming in with some positive feedback to balance out the universe.

"Holy crap. Just got home from dinner at Mayfield and, DAYUM, it was so good.Really lovely experience all around: service, food, ambience, etc.We got several things and split - not a one disappointed.Kale Salad (so fresh, so green).Buffalo Mozarella (pesto w ramp, snap peas, holy moly).Steak Tartare (deeeelish...horseradish put it over the edge into heavenly).Burger (w/ cheddar and caramelized onions and frieds - nom).Trout (really delish flakey skin...probably my least favorite of all, but still VERY good).If I wasn't moving back to Texas in 7 days, I would certainly be making this a neighborhood regular thing. Looks like they have great happy hour specials ($1 oysters and drinks). Great addition to the hood!",5.0
Went in for a quick lunch before an appointment. Great service and friendly staff. I had the oyster po boy minus the bread. Great meal but why minus one star? Too heavy on the salt and my server agreed. I was filled and full. I wish I had some more of those delish oysters! The meal was served with a mixed green salad and celery root slaw. I'm happy they took my no bread account request. I'd eat here again.,4.0
"Any time you find a place in a liminal neighborhood that tries to serve you half a grapefruit for $5, you know where that neighborhood is headed. The food at Mayfield is good. It is not special. You are paying a premium to pretend you are eating somewhere that is not Crown Heights. The dim lighting, exposed brick, cloth napkins and thoughtful tile applications are a harbinger of a neighborhood soon doomed to be overtaken by an army of tasteful, inoffensive yet interchangeable new American restaurants - each fated to feature a massaged kale salad and the occasional special on blue point oysters.",3.0
"After a couple of failed attempts at visiting Mayfield, I was finally able to get there! The ambiance is lovely, with dim lights (especially past 8:00), loud jazzy music, and an old-meets-new combination of exposed brick, dark wood, and smooth tile.I was a little confused at first by the menu, which our gracious server was happy to explain. She said that the two pastas as well as the dishes labeled ""entrees"" are, indeed, entrees, and that the rest were more of a small-plates style. I ordered the Mussels, which came with a few toasty pieces of bread and had plenty of vegetables and mushrooms in the broth, making it more than just a dipping sauce. I also ordered a side of Spoonbread, not knowing what it was, only to fall in love with it one bite at a time. My DP ordered the Kale Salad, which was extremely tangy and bright and a surprisingly large portion. The kale was finely chopped with pine nuts and apples, making it very easy to eat. No big pieces of greens flopping all over the place. He also ordered the Chicken Liver Mousse, which is basically a mini mason jar of pate served alongside a few crostini. Perfect for a sharing situation but not so much for an entree... we can't say we weren't warned!Service was friendly and attentive, and there are about a dozen other menu items that I can't wait to try next time!",4.0
"Only been here for BRUNCH, since dinner items are a bit odd. I got the benedict and it was good. The place is huge, no wait for a seat unless you come here in a large group. The coffee is a little weird here. It's French press, but looks kind of watery.",4.0
"Holy mother of God.How has this place not blown up like Barboncino...the dinner I just had was better than any I have ever eaten. And I promise you, nobody eats more than I do. I started with the house wine, which could have been ""not just the house wine,"" and tasted somewhere between fine and good. At $6 for the happy hour price, it was delectable.Then I had the shredded kale salad. I like to pretend to be a health nut, but deep down I think kale tastes like grocery bags just like everybody else. But this shit was BANANAS. What did they do?I finished with the scallops. Nobody likes scallops! They're like snails without the snobbish reputation, and the only reason people eat snails is to achieve a snobbish reputation. But these were amazing! The green risotto, who knows what that flavor was supposed to be, was good, fine, nice, but it was the mushrooms that really ""tied the room together"" and made me go nuts.***I just read this review and wondered, why did I order two foods I don't even like?",5.0
"Burger is a real value with fried egg, bacon, onions and cheese. Very good portion with tasty fries. Fried quail, on the other hand, is a really skimpy portion. I know that quail is a small bird, and I appreciate the attempt to push the envelope, but there just isn't enough meat on the bones to justify the price, or, more importantly, to feel full. My wife isn't a big eater and even she didn't feel satisfied with the portion. The fried batter was excellent, however: light and crispy. Atmosphere is raucous even when half-empty due to the acoustics. Might not be a good date place for that reason. But the interior LOOKS great. Staff was very friendly and service was good. We'll give it another shot and try some of the other food. Maybe if we had the BLT or some other more filling/better value dish, we could bump it up another star.",3.0

"I went here on a leisurely Sunday night with my girlfriend and will definitely return for repeat visits. The smart, nautical Art Deco design manages to give the space versatile appeal. Mayfield is casual and intimate, laid-back yet sophisticated. The kind of neighborhood place where you could have just a chill glass of wine, throw a small party, or go out on a casual date. The service is warm and attentive--from the front door to your table and back out again.The food we tried was decent. Not stellar, but definitely tasty enough to warrant further menu exploration on another visit. The kale salad with Fuji apples was fresh, dense, and generously portioned. While the apples added a pleasant sweetness, the salad could benefit from a touch of acidity to lighten the dish and cut through all that roughage. The grilled cheese and tomato soup special was a delight. Enhanced by a spicy, smoked chili creme fraiche and scallion sprigs for zing, the soup was a winner. The grilled cheese was simple in that ""less is more"" fashion, and it made for a satisfying sidekick to a bangin' soup. Let both the adult and the little kid in you go satisfied.For dessert, we opted for the lemon cheesecake. In terms of flavor? Lovely. Both creamy and zesty with a graham cracker crust that crumbled delicately in your mouth. In terms of texture? I could do with way less pomegranate seeds. They gave the cheesecake a jarring candy bar crunch. The tartness from the pomegranate seeds worked well, but perhaps less seeds and more jus is the way to go.There is a T.V. located at the bar, but it's presence is neither offensive nor distraction. Moderately sized and positioned higher than most TVs at bars, it satisfies those who want to watch a game without intruding upon the experience of  those who despise such distractions.Watch out for the bathrooms, though.

The decor is simple, lovely and surprisingly elegant: Stevie Wonder on the stereo and the TV in the bar on ""mute.""Being that we made it before the end of happy hour, my husband indulged in some $1 oysters, which he proclaimed were delicious (I'm not an oyster fan).We started with the delicious heirloom beet salad with hazelnuts. So good! My only complaint here is that the portion was rather small--only 2-3 bites for each of us. But it was so flavorful.Next, we shard the seared scallops and the pork chop. The scallops were prepared perfectly, served atop root vegetable puree. We're talking ""melt-in-your-mouth"" delicious. But two scallops for $11? Yes, they were large scallops, but... add one more to the plate and it'd be perfection!The pork chop was served with caramelized onion faro and grilled radicchio, a hearty portion, cooked just right and extremely flavorful. The radicchio was a bit charred, but that's how I like it, so... happy me!We had the most delightful server: John. Friendly, professional and helpful. Even as the restaurant started filling up (and the volume level rose), he did not miss a beat. The service was excellent.We had not planned to order dessert, but upon reviewing the menu, we decided to try the lemon cheesecake with pomegranate. And OHH are we glad we did! It was absolutely scrumptious--a refreshingly light cheesecake, with just enough lemon to give it a delightful zing. And the pomegranate added a juicy pop of flavor. So refreshing and delicious!All in all, we left contented and satisfied, if not stuffed. Definitely not the place to go when you're looking for a big, filling meal.

"Talk about an awesome place to share date night with that special someone, a glass of wine with an old friend, or show off Brooklyn to your snobby Manhattan-ite friends. Mayfield's has this cute, rustic ambience that immediately makes you feel at ease. The hostess will come out of the woodworks to get you seated (as the restaurant is small and narrow) and make sure you have a drink ordered. The staff is more than friendly; your water glass will never reach half empty, and your wine glass will be refilled before you can take the last sip. I arrived at 5:50 on a Friday and was seated immediately. I recommend coming for oyster happy hour ($1 oysters) served with mignonette and cocktail sauce. If you're a meat lover, you're in luck, as almost every item (even the ""Veg"" and ""Seafood"") is cooked with some sort of bacon or prosciutto (although we were assured they could be left out).  I had a hard time deciding between the duck, the gnocchi and the ravioli, but truffle sauce trumps all and I had the gnocchi. You know how anywhere you order gnocchi, it comes in a huge bowl and you're full before you finish half? Not here. The gnocchi is light and served in a small portion so you definitely will leave full and happy but not feeling stuffed and regretting that last bite. I tried a bite of my friend's fried oyster and it was cooked perfectly. It seems you really can't go wrong with anything you order. I can't wait to make the trek back again!!!",5.0

EAT UP.",4.0
This place is terrific! I was looking for an oyster spot near my house in flatbush to celebrate getting into grad school and found this place. Every item that was brought out was delicious from the oysters to the ribs to the kale salad. The service was great as was the ambiance of the place. We were sitting at the bar and what I will say is those seats are tiny and hard!  Will deff be going back!,4.0
"In a word: OBSESSED. My husband and I came out to the hood to visit our friend's new apt and they suggested we try Mayfield. We had no idea what a treat was in store! We started with $1 oysters (which were small but tasty) and then dove right into the entrees. I had the special soft shell crab blt with fries and was completely blown away! It was salty and crispy and bacony and not at all heavy. As a hot sauce lover I was psyched to get a side of sriracha spiked mayo to dip my crispy, not overly salty fries into. My husband got the scallops with ramp risotto which was incredible, and our friends got the whole roasted brook trout (which was cooked to perfection) and the pork belly (which I didn't try but looked amazing). The drinks were spot on and the service was fantastic. We'll definitely be back soon!",5.0
"Beautiful interior. The food here is very good...and creative. My favorite is their Scallop dish. You can tell that some thought went into this menu and there is something for everyone. I imagine it's not easy to do this and keep the menu rather small. Great job, Mayfield team. I'm not crazy about some of their interpretations of classic cocktails, but I see no reason that someone else wouldn't like them.  Also, they're one of the few places I've been to that stocks Apple Jack Brandy; when the friendly bartender was unaware of the rather obscure drink I ordered ( I saw it on Rachel Maddow) using this ingredient, he asked for the recipe and whipped it up for me anyway. The gesture was appreciated and I can't wait to become a regular here.Great for date night.",5.0
Deliciousness. Recently moved into the area and am loving this place.Good food and good cocktails. The only thing is that it can get a little chilly when they have the AC going.

"Absolutely delicious, from start to finish.  The kale salad was probably the best one I've ever had, and I love kale salads.  My entree of pappardelle with braised veal and rosemary was unbelievably delicious.  It was rich and savory, with tender bits of veal throughout.It was our first visit, it was Valentine's Day, and we didn't make reservations.  We did, however, show up early--around 6:00.  My only (and tiny) gripe is the uber-hip hostess.  There were TONS of tables open, and no reservations until 7:30, but getting a table involved her pow-wow'ing with two other employees.  I've worked service, and it really shouldn't have been so painstaking.  Not even taking a star off for that, though, as the service otherwise was impeccable, and the food was amazing.  So glad to have an upscale dining option in the neighborhood.",5.0
"Happy hour here is great - dollar oysters and four dollar drafts. The draft selection may be a bit limited (3 beers to choose from), but it's local and pretty decent. However, no deals on cocktails or wine is kind of a bummer. The staff is pretty nice though, and the decor is very cutesy by Crown Heights standards. Plus, as you would expect given the name, the music is hip and fun.However, dinner is less good. It may sound super delicious, but the portions are rather small and some of the food is boring. The Berkshire BLT was good for a few bites, but the thick cut bacon was mostly fat, which gets pretty gross pretty quick. Plus, its not nearly as good a deal.TL;DR - I might be back for drinks, but not for dinner.",4.0
"So happy to have this place in the neighborhood. We had dinner there last night for the first time and everything we tried was delicious. Dinner for two with 1 drink each, and app and 2 entrees came to $76 with tip. Not cheap, but definitely worth it.I don't even usually like octopus, but the grilled octopus salad w/ pork belly was fantastic. The pork chop saltimbocca was moist and the farro was flavorful. The Papardelle w/ veal was cooked really nicely and not at all skimpy on the meat. Its felt as much like a meat dish as a pasta dish.",4.0

Monsters. some waiters could be on their slow game so try not to be too much in a hurry or don't take it too much to heart.  Sometimes working a brunch shift could be tough if you yourself were out enjoying your libations, and then working the brunch shift when all ya really want is a PBR with your burger or a mimosa with your hash browns... ease up the food is amaze.  The crowd is dirtbag chic so dust off your tee shirt and/or plaid shirt that you left on the floor from the night before, and go eat.  This place is dope. EAT UP.",4.0
This place is terrific! I was looking for an oyster spot near my house in flatbush to celebrate getting into grad school and found this place. Every item that was brought out was delicious from the oysters to the ribs to the kale salad. The service was great as was the ambiance of the place. We were sitting at the bar and what I will say is those seats are tiny and hard!  Will deff be going back!,4.0
"In a word: OBSESSED. My husband and I came out to the hood to visit our friend's new apt and they suggested we try Mayfield. We had no idea what a treat was in store! We started with $1 oysters (which were small but tasty) and then dove right into the entrees. I had the special soft shell crab blt with fries and was completely blown away! It was salty and crispy and bacony and not at all heavy. As a hot sauce lover I was psyched to get a side of sriracha spiked mayo to dip my crispy, not overly salty fries into. My husband got the scallops with ramp risotto which was incredible, and our friends got the whole roasted brook trout (which was cooked to perfection) and the pork belly (which I didn't try but looked amazing). The drinks were spot on and the service was fantastic. We'll definitely be back soon!",5.0
"Beautiful interior. The food here is very good...and creative. My favorite is their Scallop dish. You can tell that some thought went into this menu and there is something for everyone. I imagine it's not easy to do this and keep the menu rather small. Great job, Mayfield team. I'm not crazy about some of their interpretations of classic cocktails, but I see no reason that someone else wouldn't like them.  Also, they're one of the few places I've been to that stocks Apple Jack Brandy; when the friendly bartender was unaware of the rather obscure drink I ordered ( I saw it on Rachel Maddow) using this ingredient, he asked for the recipe and whipped it up for me anyway. The gesture was appreciated and I can't wait to become a regular here.Great for date night.",5.0
Deliciousness. Recently moved into the area and am loving this place.Good food and good cocktails. The only thing is that it can get a little chilly when they have the AC going. Have been here for both brunch and dinner and will definitely be back for more. And next time I will be getting the burger that everyone around me always seems to be ordering.....,4.0
"Absolutely delicious, from start to finish.  The kale salad was probably the best one I've ever had, and I love kale salads.  My entree of pappardelle with braised veal and rosemary was unbelievably delicious.  It was rich and savory, with tender bits of veal throughout.It was our first visit, it was Valentine's Day, and we didn't make reservations.  We did, however, show up early--around 6:00.  My only (and tiny) gripe is the uber-hip hostess.  There were TONS of tables open, and no reservations until 7:30, but getting a table involved her pow-wow'ing with two other employees.  I've worked service, and it really shouldn't have been so painstaking.  Not even taking a star off for that, though, as the service otherwise was impeccable, and the food was amazing.  So glad to have an upscale dining option in the neighborhood.",5.0
"Happy hour here is great - dollar oysters and four dollar drafts. The draft selection may be a bit limited (3 beers to choose from), but it's local and pretty decent. However, no deals on cocktails or wine is kind of a bummer. The staff is pretty nice though, and the decor is very cutesy by Crown Heights standards. Plus, as you would expect given the name, the music is hip and fun.However, dinner is less good. It may sound super delicious, but the portions are rather small and some of the food is boring. The Berkshire BLT was good for a few bites, but the thick cut bacon was mostly fat, which gets pretty gross pretty quick. Plus, its not nearly as good a deal.TL;DR - I might be back for drinks, but not for dinner.",4.0
"So happy to have this place in the neighborhood. We had dinner there last night for the first time and everything we tried was delicious. Dinner for two with 1 drink each, and app and 2 entrees came to $76 with tip. Not cheap, but definitely worth it.I don't even usually like octopus, but the grilled octopus salad w/ pork belly was fantastic. The pork chop saltimbocca was moist and the farro was flavorful. The Papardelle w/ veal was cooked really nicely and not at all skimpy on the meat. Its felt as much like a meat dish as a pasta dish.",4.0
"I have been to Mayfield several times now both for a bevvy and to have dinner.Every time has been a hit for me. The food is fantastic but also, the bar guys know their stuff.

"My fiancee and I come here about two sometimes three times a week all for different reasons. The hospitality from the great manager Keith to the bartenders, servers, etc are great. They offer happy hour oysters from all over the coasts ranging from $1-$3.50 each. Every oyster option is great. BuT I can't forget the drink happy hour being just as reasonable. Whey have a seasonal menu with fresh greens and local meats. Our favorite special is the prime rib and fingering potatoes with a side of delicious brussels sprouts. The fish in chips, trout, burger, and Cuban are a few of our other favorites. Brunch is just as yummy- our favorite is steak and eggs and the French toast. The coffee is strong and french pressed as well which I can appreciate. Mayfield has brought so much character to our area and the chef, staff, and environment is perfect for larger groups, two people, or even yourself if you want to sit at the bar.

Pretty tasty too, but not out of this world.I was a little disappointed that they didn't have more vegetarian / vegan options but the Cauliflower Custard (with butter and egg) was really freaking delish.

Pretty small portion (to Americans) - although Europeans would have been pleased and I was perfectly satisfied.Friends ordered the whole trout, orecchiette with broccoli rabe, burger and the gnocchi and there were full stomachs, plenty of smiles, and no complaints.Two friends ordered drinks that were both meh.

Harborage or conditions conducive to attracting vermin to the premises and/or allowing vermin to exist.6) Accurate thermometer not provided in refrigerated or hot holding equipment.They racked up a whopping 51 points and this means the inspectors came back just two weeks later, and if nothing had changed they would have been shut down.

"I went to Mayfield for the first time for dinner.  It happened to be a Friday around 7pm but there was no wait for a table, however, I suspect if we had arrived closer to 8pm there would have been a wait.  We were seated at the high tables in the back, adjacent to the open kitchen.  It's always interesting to see how the kitchen runs, and I generally find that it's a great way to plan one's order.  Watching the dishes as they're carried out to other diners helps to fill-in the sparse description in black and white that appears on the menu.  Unfortunately, it's not enough to distract from the extremely uncomfortable stools at the high tables, which feature a chair back that hovers over the seat and leaves the sitter with the choice of perching on the front edge or leaning forward into the table at a 45° angle. Kale salad is one of my current favorites, and trying Mayfield's Shredded Kale Salad ($9) version made me realize two things: (1) I genuinely enjoy the the taste of kale, and (2) the chef at Mayfield hates vegetables.  The kale is very finely shredded and mixed with ricotta and pinenuts that barely register, honey crisp apple that hits the taste buds, and breadcrumbs.  Between the apple and seasoned breadcrumbs this salad is closer to an baked apple crisp than a salad -- this dish did not work for me.If I had any doubts about the role of vegetables in the menu here, trying the Cauliflower Custard, with brown rice and broccoli ($15) relieved me of any questions.  The cauliflower was indeed completely unrecognizable as a creamy, form-shaped custard.  Its accompanied by broccoli and rice that are recognizable, but sit atop a heavy brown sauce that envelopes them -- like a suede boot into a mud puddle, there was just no way to salvage the vegetables and grains from the overwhelming sauce.  Overall these flavors were complimentary together, but I didn't want to eat an entire meal of heavy sauces, with little texture, that drew no inspiration from the main vegetable ingredients.    On the other side of the table: My boyfriend initially ordered the fish and chips, but happened to see the pile of deep fried, oily, crispiness headed for another table and quickly changed his order to the burger ($15), which he had with bacon, blue cheese, and grilled onions (all were FREE add-ons).  His general sentiment was that Mayfield is 'reasonably priced food & drink, but not michelin star worthy.  Come here to stay close to home and have a solid burger & beer.'",2.0

"My issue with this place is the service.  I live three blocks away, and came here with a group of six around 11pm on a Thursday night, and the bar seating area was full.  The hostess would not let us sit at any of the dozen (yes, dozen!) empty tables at the front of the restaurant because they were ""prioritized"" for people who were ordering food and not just drinks.  I can understand that approach in a full restaurant during busy hours, but at 11pm in a half-empty restaurant it was a very petty move. The worst part was that the hostess raised her eyebrows and smirked at us when we pointed out that one of the women in our group was pregnant, and then still wouldn't allow us to sit.This incident really changed my mind about giving this place anymore business.  It's disappointing when nice places like this just aren't as gracious as they could be.",2.0
"Mayfield is everything you want a restaurant to be. Excellent food, the quality of the produce is fantastic. The kale salad is to die for. I would suggest requesting a fried egg on top, makes for an excellent, protein rich meal. The fries are hands down the best. I have no clue how they do it but fries are a must, ask for some extra Sriracha mayo! If you are in the mood for something else, I highly recommend the trout although having said that the burger is also great. The bartenders are funny, friendly, and most importantly excellent when it comes to making drinks. My very small annoyances with Mayfield are twofold. Firstly, one of the male servers can be quite obnoxious. Whenever I go, I try and avoid his section as best I can. Secondly, I would like to see a stronger beer selection which includes lighter, crisper beers for hot summer days. None of these negatives would ever deter me from going to Mayfield but changing these two aspects would certainly warrant 5 stars from me.",4.0
"-The service sucked-The food was a huge disappointment-I'm definitely coming back here...Bazinga! (Kudos to those who get that reference). Alright, I'll stop playing my screwed up version of 2 lies and a truth  ;)Went a few days ago on Saturday evening. We were a party of 3 and we decided to arrive around 7pm to try to beat the dinner rush. That was a great decision because by 7:45pm the place was full. Food: One of our party was a strict vegetarian (no fish), and we were all impressed that the many vegetarian options weren't the usual lame throw-aways like tossed salad and ""roasted veggie plate"". You can tell that the chef put a lot of thought into making everything on the menu shine. -Kale salad: generous portion and really delicious-Cauliflower custard my veggie friend had was absolutely delicious-I had the grilled octopus with pork belly. The octopus was perfectly cooked and tender and pork belly was great consistency. (Not too fatty, not too lean). Other friend had the trout which he inhaled in 5 minutes flat. I managed to snag a bit before the destruction and it was perfectly seasoned and the skin had a great crispiness. -Scallops with bacon was great also. Scallops had a nice sear. And the scallops were NOT bacon wrapped but instead the bacon (looked more like a hearty pancetta to me), was chopped, rendered and used as kind of a garnish. I wouldn't have complained if there was more bacon though... but that's my bias. ;)-Dessert was the apple upside down cake served warm with ice cream. Enough said. Not cheap, but not pricey either. And the quality of the food was great.  3 apps, 3 entrees,1 dessert, 4 beers, 1 whiskey and 1 coffee. $48 per person including tax and 20% tip. ps.

"The food is phenomenal. You literally can't go wrong with anything, and you can go very, very right by choosing the burger. It's perfectly cooked and comes with as many toppings as you like, no extra charge. Bacon and blue cheese? No problem. Sauteed mushrooms and cheddar? Done. It's the best burger in the neighborhood by far. Runners up include the mussels, the brussels and Hell, everything else. They also change their menu seasonally so you know the product is fresh and cared for. Drinks are great, too, and they have a small but compelling list of rotating craft on tap. Prices are decent and their oyster happy hour is top notch. I'm holding back a star, though, because I find the bartenders to be awful. Not unskilled, mind you, but pushy and annoying. What if I want to sit at the bar, eat some food and watch a game while enjoying a single craft beer? What if I don't want another? Do I need to be harrassed every five minutes for it? What if the person with me just wants to eat a burger and drink some water? Does she need to be heckled into getting a cocktail? No. These goofy dudes need to realize that pushing drinks on your customers only works in frat bars banking on binge drinking teenagers, not neighborhood bistros with a sophisticated menu and well curated cocktail list.

"Stumbled upon a nice jewel in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn. The vibe was great, the noise level was perfect for me since I actually enjoy a slightly less than quiet loud active place to eat. I sat down at the counter and happen to spark up a conversation with someone that worked there about the beef cheek. I mention that I had never had beef cheek and that I didn't think I would be up to it. Little did I know I was speaking with the owner and just as quickly as he walked away he came right back with a plate of beef cheek. I must say it was amazing and I thought that was a very cool gesture from the owner. All in all the food was great and the vibe in that area of BK couldn't have been better.

"Delicious chicken liver mousse. Tasty, generously portioned brunches: you definitely feel like you're getting your money's worth at brunch. The place gets a bit mobbed but that's because it's one of the best restaurants in the neighborhood. It's a little pricey but worth a splurge. My one criticism is about the service: if you're charging Manhattan/fancy Brooklyn prices, the service needs to match up.

"I went to Mayfield for the first time for dinner.  It happened to be a Friday around 7pm but there was no wait for a table, however, I suspect if we had arrived closer to 8pm there would have been a wait.  We were seated at the high tables in the back, adjacent to the open kitchen.  It's always interesting to see how the kitchen runs, and I generally find that it's a great way to plan one's order.  Watching the dishes as they're carried out to other diners helps to fill-in the sparse description in black and white that appears on the menu.  Unfortunately, it's not enough to distract from the extremely uncomfortable stools at the high tables, which feature a chair back that hovers over the seat and leaves the sitter with the choice of perching on the front edge or leaning forward into the table at a 45° angle. Kale salad is one of my current favorites, and trying Mayfield's Shredded Kale Salad ($9) version made me realize two things: (1) I genuinely enjoy the the taste of kale, and (2) the chef at Mayfield hates vegetables.  The kale is very finely shredded and mixed with ricotta and pinenuts that barely register, honey crisp apple that hits the taste buds, and breadcrumbs.  Between the apple and seasoned breadcrumbs this salad is closer to an baked apple crisp than a salad -- this dish did not work for me.If I had any doubts about the role of vegetables in the menu here, trying the Cauliflower Custard, with brown rice and broccoli ($15) relieved me of any questions.  The cauliflower was indeed completely unrecognizable as a creamy, form-shaped custard.  Its accompanied by broccoli and rice that are recognizable, but sit atop a heavy brown sauce that envelopes them -- like a suede boot into a mud puddle, there was just no way to salvage the vegetables and grains from the overwhelming sauce.  Overall these flavors were complimentary together, but I didn't want to eat an entire meal of heavy sauces, with little texture, that drew no inspiration from the main vegetable ingredients.    On the other side of the table: My boyfriend initially ordered the fish and chips, but happened to see the pile of deep fried, oily, crispiness headed for another table and quickly changed his order to the burger ($15), which he had with bacon, blue cheese, and grilled onions (all were FREE add-ons).  His general sentiment was that Mayfield is 'reasonably priced food & drink, but not michelin star worthy.  Come here to stay close to home and have a solid burger & beer.'",2.0

"My review has to be based on the bar alone and not food for I could barely understand the menu enough to order anything, so I didn't.  Welcome to the new Crown Heights Brooklyn.  Was semi-excited to see a new place replacing Roadhouse, until I went there.  The remodel looks great.  Can't say a bad word in those regards, but I'm not spending money at a place based on the looks.  The bar prices here are unreasonable.  I'm from Upstate and lived in Western NY for a long time.  We drink Labatt Blue/light out there regularly.  The minute I saw they had Labatt Blue I was excited because I can't find it at a bar anywhere here.  Then I noticed the price:  $4 a can.  If you take anything away from my review Know that you can get a 12 pack at Target at Atlantic Terminal for around $10.So since the beer is overly priced I opted to try one of the cocktails.  I chose the Planters Punch or something like that.  I figured it would be on the rocks in a rocks glass because that's the way the description made it sound.  Ordered my drink and watched over the bartender to see how it was made.  Skimpy pour for a $12 drink with lots of simple syrup and lime juice.  To top it off he pours it over ice in a tall glass and fills it with soda water.  That wasn't in the description and really got to me.  So I am handed my drink with no straw (not sure if it is supposed to have one or not) which isn't a problem except for all the booze is at the bottom so I have to suck down a bunch of gross soda water to get tiny amount of booze that I paid for.  Needless to say the GF and I finished up our drinks and made a hasty retreat. Sorry for the long review, just couldn't justify throwing out a 1 star rating without letting readers know why.  This place will do well in the neighborhood.  It's exactly what is becoming the norm.  It's just not for me.P.S.- sorry to JR for insulting this ""ground breaking"" establishment.  Pretty sure I can go to Williamsburg and find one on every corner.  I never bashed this place.  Just gave my honest opinion and experience there.  If you are cool with getting taken to the cleaners for drinks and food go for it man.  As I left off with originally, It's just not for me.",1.0
"Having eaten at Mayfield twice now, it's time to review it. It's hard to find fault with their approach: fresh, largely local food, done very well, and served up in a great setting. Lots of classic dishes with twists, and a great drink selection to boot.Food: As I've been here with a couple of groups, I've been lucky enough to try most of the menu. Here's how it went: kale salad (as good as they say); ceviche (delicious, tangy, comes with popcorn - need I say more?); heirloom beets (even my carnivorous friend liked them); roasted Brussels sprouts (these made me actually like sprouts); and fish and chips (as a Brit I can attest to their being as-good-as/better-than the original). The scallops deserve special mention for deliciousness, and if you're looking for meat, the braised veal is unmissable. Don't usually go for dessert, but a mouthful each of the chocolate pot, lemon cheesecake, and apple pie left me wanting more.Service: friendly, without being cloying.Atmosphere: relaxed, low key. Great music selection, and not too loud.Writing this has made my mouth water - I can't wait to go back!",5.0
Nice place and very good food.  It is a hipster spot so I saw Kale salads flying out of the kitchen.  I don't get the Kale craze so I didn't order it.  The scallops were great and the gnocchi was very good.  Portions are on the small side so I will definitely order more food next time.  Good service and good food will definitely be back.,4.0
"My boyfriend and I chanced it and came to Mayfield on a Saturday night at 8pm. The wait was about 25 to 30 minutes. The hostess was very polite and let us know that our wait could be shorter as many eat at the bar. We joined those at the bar and surveyed the cocktail list. They had many options from savory to refreshing and sweet. We tried the Brooklyn Lemonade and the Mezcal Peach. The lemonade is delicious! Very refreshing. I would skip the Mezcal Peach. We couldn't taste peach at all and the small glass was only filled about halfway. The wait was true to what the hostess said and we were seated near the front which was quite cold. The waiter also didn't visit us as much as the tables in the back but he seemed overtaxed with several big tables. We had to ask the water-server to get him to take our order. We split the kale salad which was so uniquely flavored with Apple and Parmesan. We also ordered the sunchoke soup, but due to the busy kitchen, it wasn't delivered until after our entrees which meant it was on the house! I had the scallops for an entree which were delicious. The dish was small, so I'm glad we got the spoon bread (a softer but delicious cousin of corn bread). My boyfriend enjoyed the pork chops which had an amazing BBQ sauce. We saw many orders of pork chops fly by us during the course of the night! We finished with a slice of the pineapple upside-down cake. The cake was perfectly executed and had a burnt sugar coating to it which was delicious. Over all, I rate Mayfield highly, but recommend skipping a late Saturday night in favor of a less busy weeknight.",4.0
"beautiful restaurant with great potential.

"Truly great seafood, and well made. The plating was beautiful.  There's something for everyone: vegetarian, large plates, and even burgers and BLT's.  Nice cocktail list, not overly sweet. Inside it's warm, not too loud, and charmingly trendy.  Beautiful wood. Couple hot guys working there, but a lot of hot male patrons. All and all the vibe matches the food. Highly recommend!",5.0
"I tried this spot for the first time on friday night and was 100% satisfied with everything I ordered. There was a little wait (about 20 minutes) but to be expected on a friday night at a good spot.

Burger looked & tasted as if it was from a deli/bodega, heated from frozen -- not worth the 15 bucks, or even half that. Fries were not bad, but cold. Cuban was ok.Theme seemed to be overpriced food.

"How excited we are... We live in crown heights. We are also big food lovers and follow all the restaurants opening around the area. Was very excited to try mayfield and they surely came through. The new renovations look amazing and it actually looks big. We started with the trout ceviche and kale salad and both were amazing. For entrees we had the scallops and parapadelle with lamb. All dishes delivered with great flavor. For desert we had the brown sundae, finishing a wonderful meal a great note. Very grateful for this new gem on Franklin.",5.0
"My review has to be based on the bar alone and not food for I could barely understand the menu enough to order anything, so I didn't.  Welcome to the new Crown Heights Brooklyn.  Was semi-excited to see a new place replacing Roadhouse, until I went there.  The remodel looks great.  Can't say a bad word in those regards, but I'm not spending money at a place based on the looks.  The bar prices here are unreasonable.  I'm from Upstate and lived in Western NY for a long time.  We drink Labatt Blue/light out there regularly.  The minute I saw they had Labatt Blue I was excited because I can't find it at a bar anywhere here.  Then I noticed the price:  $4 a can.  If you take anything away from my review Know that you can get a 12 pack at Target at Atlantic Terminal for around $10.So since the beer is overly priced I opted to try one of the cocktails.  I chose the Planters Punch or something like that.  I figured it would be on the rocks in a rocks glass because that's the way the description made it sound.  Ordered my drink and watched over the bartender to see how it was made.  Skimpy pour for a $12 drink with lots of simple syrup and lime juice.  To top it off he pours it over ice in a tall glass and fills it with soda water.  That wasn't in the description and really got to me.  So I am handed my drink with no straw (not sure if it is supposed to have one or not) which isn't a problem except for all the booze is at the bottom so I have to suck down a bunch of gross soda water to get tiny amount of booze that I paid for.  Needless to say the GF and I finished up our drinks and made a hasty retreat. Sorry for the long review, just couldn't justify throwing out a 1 star rating without letting readers know why.  This place will do well in the neighborhood.  It's exactly what is becoming the norm.  It's just not for me.P.S.- sorry to JR for insulting this ""ground breaking"" establishment.  Pretty sure I can go to Williamsburg and find one on every corner.  I never bashed this place.  Just gave my honest opinion and experience there.  If you are cool with getting taken to the cleaners for drinks and food go for it man.  As I left off with originally, It's just not for me.",1.0
"Having eaten at Mayfield twice now, it's time to review it. It's hard to find fault with their approach: fresh, largely local food, done very well, and served up in a great setting. Lots of classic dishes with twists, and a great drink selection to boot.Food: As I've been here with a couple of groups, I've been lucky enough to try most of the menu. Here's how it went: kale salad (as good as they say); ceviche (delicious, tangy, comes with popcorn - need I say more?); heirloom beets (even my carnivorous friend liked them); roasted Brussels sprouts (these made me actually like sprouts); and fish and chips (as a Brit I can attest to their being as-good-as/better-than the original). The scallops deserve special mention for deliciousness, and if you're looking for meat, the braised veal is unmissable. Don't usually go for dessert, but a mouthful each of the chocolate pot, lemon cheesecake, and apple pie left me wanting more.Service: friendly, without being cloying.Atmosphere: relaxed, low key. Great music selection, and not too loud.Writing this has made my mouth water - I can't wait to go back!",5.0
Nice place and very good food.  It is a hipster spot so I saw Kale salads flying out of the kitchen.  I don't get the Kale craze so I didn't order it.  The scallops were great and the gnocchi was very good.  Portions are on the small side so I will definitely order more food next time.  Good service and good food will definitely be back.,4.0
"My boyfriend and I chanced it and came to Mayfield on a Saturday night at 8pm. The wait was about 25 to 30 minutes. The hostess was very polite and let us know that our wait could be shorter as many eat at the bar. We joined those at the bar and surveyed the cocktail list. They had many options from savory to refreshing and sweet. We tried the Brooklyn Lemonade and the Mezcal Peach. The lemonade is delicious! Very refreshing. I would skip the Mezcal Peach.

"Lovely addition to the neighborhood though the price point is decidedly high for Crown Heights so not sure how well they will do for the long haul.( This place reminds me quite a bit of Cornelius on Vanderbilt though Cornelius has better value though Mayfield wins on the more inventive menu).  I visited in the first month of opening and writing this review is making me want to go back.I shared the shrimp ceviche with my tablemates. It was tasty and the shrimp was fresh but nothing to write home about.I had the saltimbocca porkchop. Im glutenfree so the kitchen was accommodating and subbed the faro with fingerling potatoes. The porkchop was a lovely, juicy and well seasoned delight and the prosciutto made a crispy and salty crust. Truly yum. The major let down on the plate was the radicchio which was a burnt mess- there was nothing grilled about it. The kitchen was sparing on the fingerlings (Three-really?)My dinner mates had the buttermilk fried quail and spoonbread and the other had the whole trout. The whole trout was superfresh and delicious and I think ended up being the best dish on the table. Though the plate would have  been elevated with some sort of legume to balance out the fish and bearnaise and a few more potatoes please. Also the bearnaise was pretty hohum and didnt actually add anything to what Nature had already provided.The fried quail was lackluster. The batter was overpowering (too heavy for the frail quail) and the quail was just seasoned with salt. On the upside the quail wasnt overcooked but serving the quail with a honey like sauce was trite. The spoonbread reminded me of some sort of souffle because it was very creamy and rich but it was too sweet for my taste. The collards were undercooked and had too much tabasco and reminded me that people who dont know how to cook collards should not put said collards on their menu (too many chefs in NYC to name mind you).We didnt try any dessert but I imagine they would be good.

"Now that this restaurant has been open for a while, i can say that the 4-star review I initially gave them was well-earned. The food here is consistently fantastic and the service is getting better.

"Boosting my old review to 4 stars.  Mayfield settled in, sorted out the kinks and ...  it's pretty awesome.  It's a big space, well laid out. and carefully done without falling into the way-too-precious trap.  It feels fun and polished almost all the time and has become the ""fancy local"" joint for the area.  Still loving your twisted, inspired menu and my only kvetches with it...  the octopus & pork belly was better before some baked beans started joining them, and that beef tartare has gently faded to ""pretty darned good"" from it's original ""eyepoppingly awesome"".",4.0
"We tried out Mayfield's twice now to see if we could get a better experience, but was underwhelmed compared to our expectations. Probably because the prices are a bit high, and we ended up more impressed with the ambiance than the food.  The fact is that they are serving iceberg lettuce salad with their burgers and this was a let down, and the scallop appetizer is probably the smallest portion (3 tiny scallops) we've ever witnessed.",2.0
We were very excited about this place. Food is better than average. We would like to go there regularly but I am afraid the professionalism expressed by the kitchen does not extend into the dinning room. I like tentative service but these guys are constantly at your table trying to take the plates away. Even when the plate is full. Couldn't finish a sentence before someone was asking me an insincere question about the food or whatever. LET YOUR CLIENTS RELAX AND ENJOY THEIR MEAL.,3.0
"Service was horrendous, rude and at some points plain stupid. Full open kitchen of unattractive chefs who make no eye contact or attempt to be friendly to diners seated right at their purview. Menu is heavy on shellfish, fellow diners enjoyed their oysters but described the house wine as 'too floral' 'bothering me' and were unable to finish a second glass. No complaints about the entrees. Seating was uncomfortable and awkward. Will not return.",2.0
"We came to Mayfield because Barboncino--a neighborhood favorite--had an hour long wait, and we were delightfully surprised by the excellent service and delicious food at such spanking new place! Even though the place was packed with a pre-halloween, post-hurricane crowd, we were greeted and checked up on multiple times by the owner.  Everything we ate and drank was delicious.  We had an affordable bottle of Savignon Blanc, the kale salad and brussel sprouts to start, the scallops and cuban sandwich as mains, and the brownie sundae for dessert.  Everything was just beautifully prepared and tasty, with hints of unique flavors.  You can tell that a lot of care and talent was put into these dishes.  My favorite items were the brussel sprouts and the scallops, but I'd order EVERYTHING again.  Enjoy!",5.0
"Excellent food, great service. The only downside is when it's busy the wait can be over an hour and there's little area to stand once the bar fills up.",5.0
"This is actually a 3.5 star review. I want to like this place more than I actually do- I've been here twice, once for my birthday dinner when it opened up and once yesterday for brunch. It's really great to be able to walk to a sort of fancy spot in Crown Heights, but I think a lot of the hype this place has been getting has been because of what its doing where its doing it, not for the actual quality of food and service. My birthday dinner was nice, I honestly can't remember much more than the cauliflower (excellent) and oysters (good). I'm writing this review based on brunch yesterday. We were seated way way back at the last seat in the restaurant, which was fine because the server warned us it would be dark and kind of isolated. We were hungry so we decided to pass on the ambience (which is somehow simultaneously cozy and sort of sleek) and sat in a dark corner next the bustling kitchen. Our servers were fairly attentive and nice enough- they weren't very focused on us, but it wasn't a big issue. The menu had tasty looking stuff on it- fried clam bellies, kale salad, etc, but I wanted BRUNCH. We ordered the challah french toast and an omelette with cheddar, spinach and mushrooms. The wait was short, which is rare during busy brunch hours, and was very much appreciated. However, there might be a reason for that....we realized after a few bites that the omelette we had been given, though delicious, was absolutely, definitely not ours. You know how lots of times you don't taste what's in the omelette til you get closer to the middle? Once we got there, it was clear that our cheddar/spinach/mushroom omelette had been replaced by a spinach/onion/salmon omelette. We ate it anyway because we were starving and it was actually quite good, but sorry to whoever had ordered it? Anyway. The french toast was really delicious- soft, fluffy, not cloyingly sweet, with the right amount of cinnamon and vanilla. But the mini pitcher of syrup they provided us with was both empty and actually a little greasy. This place has a ton of potential. The food is great, the ambiance is nice, and the restaurant is sorely needed on this strip of Franklin. I just don't think it's reached the level of attentiveness and professionalism to merit the NY Times reviews and hype it's gotten. Mayfield, we like you, but you can do better!",4.0
"Ate here tonight for dinner.  Atmosphere was great, with dim lighting, exposed brick walls, and industrial vibe.  Food was delicious.  As others have said, the mussels were plentiful and the broth delicious.  Apparently we were there right at the tail end of happy hour, so we got some excellent $6 glasses of wine. The service was attentive and friendly.  Overall, it was a really cute spot for a date night, and we'll definitely be going back!",4.0
Very tasty and inexpensive. Love this place.,5.0
"Ok so we've been anticipating the opening of this place. Great addition to Franklin Ave.  we went here the night after Sandy, the place was packed and understaffed -- but still managed to deliver.  The burger is the gourmet version of a corner bistro burger.  The fries thin cut and French style. The brussel sprouts with squash and Dijon vinaigrette gives joesph Leonard's a run for its money.  But the real winner was the Cuban sandwich. Melt in your mouth pork, dripping with cheese, a crunchy pickle -- sheer perfection. Best Cuban I've had outside of Miami proper (Enriqueta's to be exact). We didn't try dessert -- by the time we were ready for it everything was sold out -- but it gives us something to look forward to the next time!",5.0

"I heard about this place and while I travel to Brooklyn like NEVER, decided to give it a try.  Smart move.  The food was just amazing.  You could really taste how fresh it was and while the presentations were very attractive and appetizing you can tell the emphasis here is on TASTY not ""pretty"".  You must try the spoon bread side, while true to the Southern taste, at Mayfield it becomes more of a corn mousse that can be enjoyed wholeheartedly without that ""rock in stomach"" feeling the original can engender.  The main courses just incredibly delicious and the desert indescribably so.Mayfield is so comfortable you can feel at home if you just came in to have a beer and watch the game (its hardly a ""sports bar"" but there is a large bar area with a TV turned to sports) or if you came from Manhattan or other distance for a truly outstanding meal.Can't wait to come back and try the burger and also the brunch menu.",5.0

"Down on Franklin Avenue you'd never have expected the bustling restaurant that awaits until you push open the doors and step inside this busy, well appointed space with exposed brick walls and wooden tables.  The wait staff are great, polite, efficient and ever so busy attending to the crowds.  Unfortunately the food was only so-so, maybe I shouldn't have ordered the Pappadelle but, hey, it was on the menu and it's one of my favorite pastas.  When it arrived I did not judge because it's all in the taste.  Okay, firstly I did not order thick egg noodles with over salted meat sauce.  The pasta was thick and hard and did not resemble or taste like Pappardelle (note to chef: please go try Remi, Empori, Falai for some good Pappardelle).  My hubby had fish and chips and friend had the mussels.  On a positive note the fries were consistent, crisp and delicious.  My husband thought his fish batter was too thick but I found it okay.  Mussels were standard, nothing exceptional and we all shared the Kale salad which I thought was very good and well sized to share.  I'm not sure if we'd return, probably not.  If you live close by the space is great and a nice place to be.",3.0
"crazy good, not just 'oh yeah, some...food...since i'm already going out to dinner anyway' but 'i want to eat THAT food and i will make a point of making plans just so i can go to mayfield'. seriously, everything we got was amazing. the sunchoke soup is rich and lovely, with the crab (so fresh and clean tasting) as such a great, unexpected detail. the brussels sprouts--we couldn't stop eating them, they're addictive, caramelized and a really good salty/sweet/tart mix. the fried quail--i thought it would seem sort of paltry--not at all the case--is super luxe and crispy and tasty. i actually couldn't finish the sides, since there was quite a lot. my friend had a roasted fish (trout, i think) which was also delicious and included the skin as a perfectly-crisped pan roast should. oh wait--it's also really nice inside, cozy and bustling at the same time. as much as i wanted to walk in and get a table immediately i was actually really happy to see it humming and packed when we got there. it's always nice to feel the energy of a place that's happily doing well, even if they're just getting going. the staff are really nice and welcoming, and made a good effort to get us comfortably folded in to the bar and friendly vibe for a drink while we waited.",5.0
"I absolutely adore this restaurant.   They've nailed the upscale-casual vibe perfectly.   The room itself is warm and inviting, yet spacious for a NYC restaurant--the kind of place where you can mill about talking and drinking after finishing dinner.  The food, however, is the real star.  It's new American, and stays true to the moniker--think of classic american dishes, made with high grade ingredients.   The menu is pretty extensive--and everything I've tried has been great.    If going you have to have the kale salad that has apples and ricotta. The cubano is out of control--perfectly tender pork that melts in your mouth.  The ceviche and fried clams also stand out.   I read some of the other reviews about it being overpriced.  I suppose it's on the higher end relative to the other places in the vicinity, but I think it's actually a great value, if not underpriced,  for a restaurant in this category serving this quality of food.  These dishes would certainly cost twice as much in Manhattan (the Dutch comes to mind specifically).   This place is a sure bet for anyone thinking of trying it.  Couldn't recommend it enough.",5.0
