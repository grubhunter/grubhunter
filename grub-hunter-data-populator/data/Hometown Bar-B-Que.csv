"This was one of the best BBQ places around NYC. Everything we had there was amazing and the ambiance at the restaurant was also pretty cool. It could accommodate families and couples. It had 2 rooms with communal seats and some tables. The wait to order food was not that bad and we were in line for about 10 minutes. I wish I could have gone there with more people, so that I could have tried more things on the menu. The only down side is that this place was hard to get to, even with car. Parking was not that difficult to get (since it was a Sunday) but there are no subways nearby. Jerk spare ribs- SO GOOD! One of the best ribs I've had. It was cooked to perfection. When you bite into it, you can see the different balanced layers of meat and fat. It was not too overly fatty but the fat just enhanced the flavor. It was cooked medium so that I meat tender but not chewy, hard or dry. The rub was more on the smokey side and it was not too spicy or overpowering. Pulled pork sandwich- I have never tasted a more moist, tender and juicy pulled pork. I always hated bbq sauce on pulled pork and this one was just marinated in the pork's juices (but it was not oily or fatty).  The sandwich came on a simple, toasted fresh bun with some cole slaw. Sticky wings- the flavoring was great. Once again not that spicy or too sweet. It had a great sesame taste. I wish the wings were more crisp but I always liked my wings well done. Beans- I personally did not like this but my boyfriend loved it. I guess it depends on how you like the sauce that the beans are cooked in. The sauce was very thick, dense and cooked down...sort of like a mush. It was heavy on the burned taste (it had burnt ends). I personally like my beans to not have a heavy sauce. Mac and cheese- I love it because it had this awesome queso sauce that pour on top of the mac and cheese. Why didn't someone think of this before!!Corn bread- Decent. Not the best or worst.",5.0
"Pretty good BBQ overall. Located in hipster Brooklyn, this is great area to come for food, by-the-water gazing and taking a trip to Ikea nearby. Came here for Sunday food, but even coming relatively early on a Sunday still ended up with a 45 minute wait. Don't worry though, the line is a bit deceiving (as in we thought it was shorter than it really was!) The place itself looks really really cool (all dark wood) with cafeteria bench style seating. There is a main area where you can order food, a separate bar area and a general seating space. There is also a second area where there is another bar area and seating. I would recommend Hometown BBQ start venting the air in the main room - it smells too smokey to the point my lungs know it may hurt to breathe. Just a thought... Now to the food: Brisket - Delicious though not the best I've ever had. Great flavor, slightly dry in certain spots but overall I really liked it. Lamb belly - Holy crap this is deliciously decadent. The best part of the meal - amazing at first bite and oh so decadently fatty by the end. You need a beer in hand while eating this. Do not miss getting lamb belly. Mac and Cheese - Tasty but not the best I've ever had. They have a wonderful selection of beer so make sure to get some beer when eating delicious BBQ food. Pretty good BBQ that is cheaper than some of the places in the city. Worth it to come and try their food.",4.0
"Love the BBQ here. The space is huge with two large rooms (each with it's own bar) and a bunch of communal tables. My first time was a little awkward since there is no host to greet/seat you and it's completely self serve. You walk up to the counter (if there's no line) and order your meats and sides. There's a rack around the side with utensils, plates, napkins, and the all important sauces. Then just grab an open seat and get to business.I went with 3 friends and we ordered 1lb of brisket, 1lb of pulled pork, vietnamese wings, mac and cheese, baked beans, and some corn bread. Everything was great but the stand outs were def the brisket and mac and cheese. Also a big fan of the hot and sweet sauce.I'm not a big drinker but they have a ton of beers on tap too.",4.0
"If there's anything that I crave regularly, it's BBQ, and when I have a BBQ craving, there's nowhere I long to go more than Hometown Bar-B-Que. It's a special occasion due to its location in Red Hook, but that almost makes it more special -- you've come all this way, and you might as well make it count. There's no denying that the line is LONG -- our compatriots took one for the team and waited in the hour-plus long line while us ladies held down a couple spots at the bar and ordered the bloody mary's (which our man-friends were able to drink in said line -- I'd definitely suggest going in a group so you can score a spot, or at least have someone on eagle eye duty. We didn't have trouble finding a place to sit, and I wonder if it's because it was FREEZING that day. I digress, you're here to hear about the food. To start, the bloody mary is delicious, but unusual. It's a bit sweet and not too spicy, like the candied bacon that garnishes it. It's right up my alley, but if you're generally not a sweet pickle/relish fan you probably won't be into it, that's the vibe. We got brisket, pulled pork, and a MASSIVE beef rib, and it was more than enough for the four of us. My favorite thing was the rib, but due to the price it's more of a shareable bite than an order for yourself item. The brisket is super solid, very peppery, and super juicy, and the pulled pork is everything pulled pork should be. There are two kinds of sauce, and I like to mix 'em together. Sides wise, I haven't tried the beans, but the queso mac and cheese is TO DIE FOR and the collards are also top notch. I wish sauce wise they had a slightly less sweet option and a slightly less spicy one -- maybe something vinegar based? The two they have are on the extreme ends of the spectrum in both directions and it's a bit overpowering. You want to be able to taste this meat, but it does benefit from a bit of a saucing.",4.0
Good Q. Side street parking. Brisket and ribs are sure fire. Cornbread great. Eat here.,4.0
"If Hometown was anywhere else in the city or Williamsburg, you'll never be able to find a seat. This bbq joint is designed as a southern style where everyone orders from the counter and then you find your own seat. There are many seats here with two separate rooms and two separate bars. You can be on benches in the louder area or you can go to the more family friendly separate room with regular tables. The food here is easily one of the best in New York. They have all the usual pulled pork, brisket, ribs, chicken, and even bacon. The sides can be beans, Mac and cheese, okra, etc. The bar is full and beers are craft. This is a hipster and foodie dream place!We had the pastrami bacon to start, followed by jerk ribs some pulled pork, some beans, Mac n cheese, and brisket. Knowing us, we had small portions of everything to try. Only complaint is the bacon is just too fatty and salty. That'll take some beers and water to wash down for sure. Everything else we had was delicious and filling. You'll be surprised how quickly a quarter pound of meat will fill you up. Thankfully, we slowly but surely chipped away at the meat mounds. This is worth a drive from anywhere to eat!",5.0
"Went on a Saturday night around 6pm and the line wasn't so bad...however, it does move very slowly! The menu isn't very extensive and drinks are sold separately at the bar. Here's the breakdown:-brisket: a bit on the chewier (read: dry) side. meh, i've had better-lamb belly: pretty darn good. fatty, a little gamey. so yum! my fave of the meats.-chicken: a-okay. interestingly, it has a ginger/scallion sauce on the side that is very reminiscent of a Chinese ""white cut chicken.""-jamaican jerk ribs: pretty standard ribs. i liked them, would probably order again-sausage: you can definitely taste that they're homemade and very fresh (not smokey, and not over-seasoned with salt/nitrates). -mac and cheese: bleh. way too salty and cheese is overwhelming. pass. -potato salad: my fave side. just perfect. -coleslaw: it's alright, just had to order some vegetables, because everything is fatty meat or carbs. The bar had a nice variety of beers on tap. Got my six point sweet action and this mild cider that tastes like carbonated apple juice my brother really liked. :P",4.0
"I'm from South Carolina, so I have high standards for bbq. Hometown hit the spot. Good bbq is SO hard to find in NYC, so after this place kept popping up on foodie blogs and such, I put it on my list of places to try. My boyfriend and I were planning a trip to Ikea today, so it was the perfect time to go to Hometown for lunch! It's a very spacious restaurant, with two large seating areas, two bars, and a stage for live music in one of them. The line moves super quickly. You give the first person your meat order, and the second person serves up the sides and rings you up. Both of the people we interacted with were friendly and efficient. Our total was about $40 for the pulled pork sandwich, brisket sandwich, medium side of mac and cheese, and medium side of collard greens. Both of the sandwiches had excellent flavor! They were super juicy and the meat was very tender. I liked the pulled pork better because it had ""hometown slaw"" on it and a bolder flavor. They really didn't need any extra sauce or anything though. They have two types of sauce-one is a bit spicy and the other is sweet. The bread on each was great too, and the meat didn't make it soggy. The sides were amazing. The mac and cheese had roasted chiles in it and a distinct, delicious flavor. The texture was perfect-not overly saturated with melted cheese, but not hard and dry either. The collard greens were so full of flavor! They had smoked pork shoulder bits in them. I've eaten a lot of mac and cheese and collard greens, and these were definitely some of the best I've had. Don't let the trip to Red Hook deter you-it's an easy walk from the F and G trains, and lots of other great bars and restaurants in the area!",5.0
"Damn good BBQ and service. There's not much else in the area but well worth the trek. We caught the M61 from Borough hall which dropped us off right across the street. We came for lunch on a Saturday and there was no wait. The place is huge - one bar area and another area for BBQ. It's all self serve - you order and seat yourself. All the utensils, water and take out boxes are by the counter.Brisket (1/4 lb) - juicy and flavorful. The outside looks charred but it's actually the rub they use that makes it look that way. The  guy cutting the meat even gave several of us in line a sample. Beef ribs (1 lb) - very tender and came right off the bone. Minimum order is one poundJerk ribs (1/2 lb) - goodMac & cheese - so bad but so good, they even had bacon or ham bits in itCollard greens - standard greens to offset all the fatty goodnessExcellent service as well, my husband loves BBQ so he tends to over order. We originally ordered a half pound of brisket in addition to all the meat above and the guy told us it was  too much and recommended a quarter pound. We were so glad we took his suggestion because we still had leftovers to take home!",5.0
"This BBQ joint dishes out one to the most tastiest BBQ in Brooklyn, NY. The place resembles that of a barn, open, wide, with high ceilings, which has been decorated wtih string lights, that is made to look like you are eating under the stars. The seating are very informal, typical backyard like furnitures, that goes well with the team of backyard BBQ.  There's are communal tables for those who don't want to appear to be eating alone and likes the company of strangers. They have a bar that appears to be well stocked with bourbon, whiskey, and other quintessential spirits that goes well with smoked meat.Now on the the star, the BBQ.  I tried the following:Jerk BBQ ribsBrisketVietnamese hot wingsSticky Asian RibsPulled pork tacosSmoked ChickenCorn breadCollard greensMac & CheeseCole SlawSo what's the verdict?My favorite had to be the Brisket.  It was smokey, with good seasoning, and the right amount of fat that melted in your mouth as you devour it.  Add on their house special sauces (the ""stick"" and the ""hot and sweet"") and you got yourself a killer brisket.  the brisket was tender, juicy, and just plan delicious.  Been her twice and order brisket both times.The second favorite is the Vietnamese hot wings. This thing is tangy, sweet, and spicy all in one.  How can you go wrong with that? It came with blue cheese dipping sauce which I didn't care for much, but the hubby like it.  So I guess some will like it and some will be happy without it (like me)This is followed very closely by the Sticky Asian Ribs (the reason why I came back the second time because I didn't get to try this one and I was disappointed with the jerk bbw ribs, but more on this later).  Similar to the Vietnamese hot wings, the right balance of hot, sweet, and tangy.  Only reason this thing came second is that I found the meat on the dyer side.  It's still moist, but I would have like ti to be more moist and less dry.  The pulled port tacos were also very good, but not memorable enough to even crave for more on my next visit.  I think they can certainly elevate this more but adding more flavor profile when building the taco itself.  I know what you are thinking, you say you want to pork to be the star of the dish, why add more stuff?  Well, if you just want to pulled pork, then order just the pulled pork and not the taco.  If you crave taco, then you want that additional condiments that go with a good taco, like onions, cilantro, pico de gallo, etc. Smoked chicken was also good. Moist and flavorful. .... ammm I have nothing else.Jerk BBQ ribs - maybe I am not a fan of any jerked type of meat (lol, silly thoughts). Meaning I also don't like jerk chicken. This may be why this was my least favorite.  It just found it dry, overcooked even, and just blah.  Never ordering this again. The sides....loved the corn bread.  They brushed them with watered down honey.  Each bite is a surprise.  The sweetness if not overwhelming, but just the right amount.  The gritty texture makes it takes more authentic.  Loved these.Mac & Cheese was my husband's favorite side.  I am okay with it.  I think it could me more creamier and smooth. But still not bad at all. For the rest, they are just okay.I do like this joint a lot.  Hoping to bring more friends next time I visit.",4.0
"Let's get straight to the meat. I shared the brisket and the lamb belly. The brisket was moist and tender. It didn't quite fall apart, yet it cut apart very easily. The burnt ends were balanced; that is, they added flavor but didn't overwhelm the interior. The lamb belly was a unique option I haven't seen else where. The meat retained the unique flavor of lamb and was served pulled. I was overwhelmed by how greasy it was. Nonetheless, it was a unique option that I'd suggest trying.The sides were outstanding! I would recommend any of the sides I tried which included the collard greens, baked beans, and mac'n'cheese. The collard greens had pork mixed in with it which added a degree of savory I haven't tasted before in collard greens. The baked beans had burnt ends mixed in and were some of the most flavorful barbecue beans that I've ever tried. They were both tangy and smokey. I'd highly recommend the beans. The mac'n'cheese was made with a queso dip like cheese which was an interesting take on the dish.Hometown has about eight draft beers on tap with a majority being craft options. The self service style made the experience convenient after you picked up your food, but the wait for food was pretty long.",5.0
"Came here saturday night and waited like an hour to get seats. This place was sooo packed, and the line for food was ridiculously long. They have limited seats and you gotta turn your inner savage mode on to get seats. Anyways we (3) got brisket, beef rib, pulled pork, jerk baby ribs and pork belly. They were all sooo soft and delishh. My personal faves were brisket and pork belly. They literally melt in your mouth. It was full of fat so that's prob why it tasted so good but still it's worth it! I love their sauce too. Spicy house sauce was really spicy so dont try if you can't handle. For sides, we got corn breads, mac and cheese, beans, slaw and sour pickles. Besides soup pickles and corn breads, i was not impressed. Pickles are pickles so you can't go wrong with it but it mashes well in your mouth with meat. I dont really like corn breads but my friend bought like 6 and said he doesnt regret buying so many. Next time I come here i wanna try lamb meat! Portions are big when it comes to bbq and ended up taking some home. Def try to avoid weekends!",4.0
"This review is coming after my second visit to the place and the verdict still stands- great BBQ! The only difference between my first and second visit was the line, and boy was it a big difference. If you're coming in for dinner, especially a weekend dinner, be prepared to wait upwards of an hour! Grabbing seats is probably the only thing worse than waiting on line. With a line like that people it's basically a professional game of musical chairs. But with that all being said, going for lunch I didn't have any of these problems and was able to thoroughly enjoy the food, so eat wisely!As for the food, like many of the reviews below have said- so so good. My favorites among the BBQ were the brisket and sausage; I think they're a must-get when you're eating here. Unfortunately they were out of the lamb belly and spare ribs by the time ordered so I can't speak on that. I found the Jamaican jerk and beef ribs to be a little dry, but nothing that their BBQ sauce couldn't fix.The sides that stood out were the collard greens and corn bread. I prefer my Mac and cheese on the creamier side so this didn't wow me, but my friends really enjoyed this side. The disappointment was definitely the beans. They did not taste good. The slaw was nothing special just regular slaw, which is fine because I NEED slaw with my BBQ. Drinks are very fairly priced and they have a good variety of draft and bottled beers. I didn't get to try the dessert but I'm not worried because I will be back!",4.0
"My first run-in with Hometown BBQ came when I attended Meatopia, a meat lover's paradise that takes place on the piers over in Hell's Kitchen. There, I met some of the people and pit masters behind Hometown, and I was thoroughly impressed with everything they presented that day, especially the beef rib.Needless to say, I made it a priority to get over there and try more.Hometown is a mix of Texas and Carolina styles - serving up a healthy smattering of both beef and pork, dry and sauced - but it has a heavy NYC influence to the flavor profiles, and the pit masters take lots of free license concerning BBQ fusion ideas.As I mentioned in my Guide to Regional BBQ Styles, I believe that NYC is emerging as its own distinctly amazing BBQ style, especially given the varied immigrant communities that touch on the lives of all in this great city.Hometown takes advantage of that diverse cuisine-culture, as all of the ownership, management and pit masters come from either New York, Brooklyn or elsewhere in the five boroughs. As a result you have menu items like (1) Jamaican jerk baby back ribs, (2) Italian sausage, (3) Chinese sticky ribs, (4) Vietnamese lamb belly banh mi sandwiches and chicken wings, (5) Jewish pastrami-spiced bacon (sinful!), and (6) Oaxacan marinated wood fired chicken and tacos.As you can see, the menu is quite varied. And the pit masters will grab anything that comes their way and spin it into a great BBQ fusion dish, whether it's beef tongue, duck, or whatever, on any given day. Turkey and chicken make a solid presence here. My only regret is that I was too full to try the turkey, wood fired chicken, and Vietnamese chicken wings.So here's what we had:(1) Lamb Belly: this was actually our least favorite of all the meats, but that is by no means an indictment of quality. Think of it this way: You can choose five pounds of gold, or ten pounds of gold. Which do you choose? Ten, of course, but five is still awesome. This meat had all the great soft, yet sticky-crisp flavors that you associate with belly meat, but with the fat flavor of lamb. I can definitely see how this might go well on a banh mi sandwich, as per the menu offering.(2) Pulled Pork: This was delicious, especially when adding a little bit of the spicy (bright red) BBQ sauce to it. The meat itself wasn't over sauced at the outset, of which I was highly appreciative, and it had both a nice sweetness and pickle-pop to it that didn't overpower.(3) Brisket: This was probably my favorite. It was very juicy and had tons of smokey flavor. If you're a smoke fiend, then add a touch of the smokey BBQ sauce (darker colored container), and you're instantly transported to wood-fired heaven.(4) Italian Sausage: I loved this Brooklyn spin on the classic BBQ joint sausage link. While I do love me some Texas hot links and classic Bavarian sausage, this was a welcome change of pace. It was cleverly served with a light tomato sauce, though it didn't taste exactly like a traditional parsley and cheese Italian link. The pungent smoke, fire roasted peppers and aged provolone added a whole different dynamic to the meat that truly made it Italian BBQ fusion.(5) Jamaican Jerk Baby Back Ribs: Wow. These were really interesting. The jerk spice and sauce create a nice thin bark on the outside, but the smoke causes the flavors to permeate through the entirety of the meat. This was a unique execution of baby back ribs.(6) Pastrami Bacon: Pastrami and bacon are two words that perhaps don't belong together in the NYC Jewish community, as it is straight up not Kosher for Passover, but this was pure heaven as far as sinful eating goes. Crispy, fatty, meaty and all around perfectly cooked, this grill-kissed slab bacon came with a velvety honey mustard sauce that actually paired great with all of the meats we tried.We didn't get down on any sides. Next time. We were so focused on the meat that we lost sight of the other goodies on the menu. I wish we ordered some whiskey sour pickles. My eyes were so dazzled by the meat selections that I completely missed them when I was reading the menu. BBQ + Pickles = Heaven. I am ashamed...The bars here are great, too, by the way: one in the front, one in the back. They have a Texas vibe, and the drinks are somewhat reasonably priced for the city. My Tecate and neat Jameson came to $13: $4 for the beer and $9 for the whisky.The atmosphere here is awesome. It feels like you're in a warehouse barn that has several fires burning. The smells are invigorating, warm and inviting. This was a perfect refuge from the downpour and cold weather that was happening the day I came here.That's the back room. In the front (through the door to the right of the bar), there's another big bar room with more tables and a small stage for live music performances. This is the counter where you order your food:REVIEW CUT FOR LENGTH",5.0

"Driving around Red Hook with no particular destination in mind, we turned a corner.  ""I smell barbecue, are we near Hometown?!""  Low and behold we were, we parked right in front and noticed no one standing around - it was a sign that we should eat.  It was 4:40 on Saturday afternoon, but hey why not.  Once inside we found a line of about 20 people, not bad.  Even with that short of a line, it took about 30 minutes.  Approaching the front of the line, with 3 people ahead of me the unthinkable happened - they ran out of spare ribs AND baby backs; I was crushed.  Luckily there was lots more to choose form and since we were there we felt the need to try as many items as we could and ordered quite a bit.Beef Rib - huge and I think the best thing I tasted. It was incredibly tender, fall off the bone, with a great beefy flavor.  Excellent.Brisket - juicy and slightly fatty with a nice bark.  Melt in your mouth delicious.Pulled Pork - was good, even better when the BBQ sauce was added to each bite.Lamb Belly - kind of amazing, succulent with a great lamb flavor without being gamy or greasy.  Not your typical BBQ, but worth a try if you like lamb.Hot Wings - I never thought I'd go to a BBQ place and order hot wings, but after hearing about how good they were I couldn't pass them up.  They were divine.  Fried perfectly without being heavy and covered with a sriracha honey sauce - they were sweet and spicy and delectable.  The ranch dressing served on the side is awesome.As if that wasn't enough, we tried some sides as well.Collard greens, potato salad, coleslaw and pickles.  All were good and went well with the meat; were they purely original and amazing? No but they did the job and enhanced the meal.Nice beer selection at the bar.I enjoyed the vibe of the place; energetic, some great music playing, string lights adorning the ceiling.  It was a lovely evening.  We may have eaten dinner super early, but being able to enjoy the Hometown experience made it all worth it.  Don't be afraid to over order - there are takeout containers with the utensils so you can take leftovers home.",4.0
"Very spacious and chill restaurant. It's a place where you order your food, pay, they give you a stand with a number, you find an available place to sit, and when your food is already, someone will bring you your food. You order drinks at the bar, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic. The menu is on the wall. You get your own forks and napkins at the condiment area. In the same area there are also to-go boxes and bags that you can get yourself if you didn't finish your food. And free self serve water. We ended up sitting at the bar, since the tables were pretty much all occupied. Sitting at the bar is a good option. The counter was spacious and there are hooks under to hang your coat and bag. We had:1. Jamacian jerk baby back ribs, a half rack for ($17). It wasn't spicy. Ribs were pretty good, well smoked, and the sauces that they have makes the meat taste even better. 2. Brisket tacos, topped with salsa verde, pickled red onion, sour cream, and cilantro. 3 for ($12). This was not that memorable. Just okay and for the price it should've been bomb. 3. Collard greens with smoked pork shoulder, small size for ($4). Needed some greens to go along with the meats and the pork made the greens taste a lot better.4. Hometown slaw, small size for ($4). I don't think they put mayonnaise. It was missing that. 5. Arnold palmer, which is mix ice tea and lemonade drink ($3). Between the 2 of us, it was the right portion and we were full. This is a good spot to hang out. Group friendly.",4.0
"To get to Hometown Bar-B-Que from my apartment in Manhattan, I hop on the A train for ~20 minutes then switch over to the B61 bus for another 15-20 minutes, and the trek is absolutely worth it.  The vibes are perfect are in this barn-style BBQ joint, and the smoky, delicious aromas overtake you as soon as you approach the entrance.  The food tastes as good as it smells, and it stands up to BBQ I've eaten in Texas.  The pulled pork was tender and moist, complemented by Hometown's sauces and the sweet but not too creamy coleslaw.  The cornbread wasn't spectacular, but the meal itself was finger-licking good.  I need to go back and try the brisket and ribs, and just about everything else on the menu.",5.0
"This has consistently been the best BBQ I've had in the Northeast (even after many visits to Dinosaur BBQ in Syracuse, NY). The brisket is always smoked to perfection, the collard greens are just PERFECT, and the mac & cheese is ooey gooey goodness.

"The lamb-belly, beef-rib, and beef-brisket are phenomenally & sensationally cooked, but, unfortunately, get boring after a few bites. It's very succulent, overwhelming meat, and it needs something to cut the fat, maybe some lemon-lime-grapefruit-orange zest and/or juice, but the two sauces they provide really don't do it for me, at all. The sauces are tasty on their own, but they are too thick and too sugary for the meat, and don't actually enhance the experience, but, rather, are conflicting & actually disguise the meaty-meatiness. So maybe next time I'll just order these meats in sandwich form, which is a shame, but I'm sure they will be delicious. Jamaican Spare-ribs and Sriracha Chicken-wings are definitely a winner, and absolutely crowdpleasers, as are the amazing beans with brisket. The potato salad is hit or miss, one time it was way too raw-vinegary, caustic and acrid, but last night it was bangin' spot-on terrific. And I really just do not like their mac and cheese or their cornbread. Awesome location, secluded and spacious. Helpful, friendly staff. Nice atmosphere, warm ambiance.",4.0

There, I met some of the people and pit masters behind Hometown, and I was thoroughly impressed with everything they presented that day, especially the beef rib.Needless to say, I made it a priority to get over there and try more.Hometown is a mix of Texas and Carolina styles - serving up a healthy smattering of both beef and pork, dry and sauced - but it has a heavy NYC influence to the flavor profiles, and the pit masters take lots of free license concerning BBQ fusion ideas.As I mentioned in my Guide to Regional BBQ Styles, I believe that NYC is emerging as its own distinctly amazing BBQ style, especially given the varied immigrant communities that touch on the lives of all in this great city.Hometown takes advantage of that diverse cuisine-culture, as all of the ownership, management and pit masters come from either New York, Brooklyn or elsewhere in the five boroughs. As a result you have menu items like (1) Jamaican jerk baby back ribs, (2) Italian sausage, (3) Chinese sticky ribs, (4) Vietnamese lamb belly banh mi sandwiches and chicken wings, (5) Jewish pastrami-spiced bacon (sinful!), and (6) Oaxacan marinated wood fired chicken and tacos.As you can see, the menu is quite varied. And the pit masters will grab anything that comes their way and spin it into a great BBQ fusion dish, whether it's beef tongue, duck, or whatever, on any given day. Turkey and chicken make a solid presence here. My only regret is that I was too full to try the turkey, wood fired chicken, and Vietnamese chicken wings.So here's what we had:(1) Lamb Belly: this was actually our least favorite of all the meats, but that is by no means an indictment of quality. Think of it this way: You can choose five pounds of gold, or ten pounds of gold. Which do you choose? Ten, of course, but five is still awesome. This meat had all the great soft, yet sticky-crisp flavors that you associate with belly meat, but with the fat flavor of lamb. I can definitely see how this might go well on a banh mi sandwich, as per the menu offering.(2) Pulled Pork: This was delicious, especially when adding a little bit of the spicy (bright red) BBQ sauce to it. The meat itself wasn't over sauced at the outset, of which I was highly appreciative, and it had both a nice sweetness and pickle-pop to it that didn't overpower.(3) Brisket: This was probably my favorite. It was very juicy and had tons of smokey flavor. If you're a smoke fiend, then add a touch of the smokey BBQ sauce (darker colored container), and you're instantly transported to wood-fired heaven.(4) Italian Sausage: I loved this Brooklyn spin on the classic BBQ joint sausage link. While I do love me some Texas hot links and classic Bavarian sausage, this was a welcome change of pace. It was cleverly served with a light tomato sauce, though it didn't taste exactly like a traditional parsley and cheese Italian link. The pungent smoke, fire roasted peppers and aged provolone added a whole different dynamic to the meat that truly made it Italian BBQ fusion.(5) Jamaican Jerk Baby Back Ribs: Wow. These were really interesting. The jerk spice and sauce create a nice thin bark on the outside, but the smoke causes the flavors to permeate through the entirety of the meat. This was a unique execution of baby back ribs.(6) Pastrami Bacon: Pastrami and bacon are two words that perhaps don't belong together in the NYC Jewish community, as it is straight up not Kosher for Passover, but this was pure heaven as far as sinful eating goes. Crispy, fatty, meaty and all around perfectly cooked, this grill-kissed slab bacon came with a velvety honey mustard sauce that actually paired great with all of the meats we tried.We didn't get down on any sides. Next time. We were so focused on the meat that we lost sight of the other goodies on the menu. I wish we ordered some whiskey sour pickles. My eyes were so dazzled by the meat selections that I completely missed them when I was reading the menu. BBQ + Pickles = Heaven. I am ashamed...The bars here are great, too, by the way: one in the front, one in the back. They have a Texas vibe, and the drinks are somewhat reasonably priced for the city. My Tecate and neat Jameson came to $13: $4 for the beer and $9 for the whisky.The atmosphere here is awesome. It feels like you're in a warehouse barn that has several fires burning. The smells are invigorating, warm and inviting. This was a perfect refuge from the downpour and cold weather that was happening the day I came here.That's the back room. In the front (through the door to the right of the bar), there's another big bar room with more tables and a small stage for live music performances. This is the counter where you order your food:REVIEW CUT FOR LENGTH",5.0
"mmmmmm, what a gem this is in bklyn! I loveeee how soft their brisket is here. Their pork tacos are to die for, their different variety of ribs and lastly, their lamb is not gamey at all. Super wallet friendly for the amount they give you. I highly recommend this spot- after eating here, you can definitely walk over for Steve's key lime pies.",4.0
"Driving around Red Hook with no particular destination in mind, we turned a corner.  ""I smell barbecue, are we near Hometown?!""  Low and behold we were, we parked right in front and noticed no one standing around - it was a sign that we should eat.  It was 4:40 on Saturday afternoon, but hey why not.  Once inside we found a line of about 20 people, not bad.  Even with that short of a line, it took about 30 minutes.  Approaching the front of the line, with 3 people ahead of me the unthinkable happened - they ran out of spare ribs AND baby backs; I was crushed.  Luckily there was lots more to choose form and since we were there we felt the need to try as many items as we could and ordered quite a bit.Beef Rib - huge and I think the best thing I tasted. It was incredibly tender, fall off the bone, with a great beefy flavor.  Excellent.Brisket - juicy and slightly fatty with a nice bark.  Melt in your mouth delicious.Pulled Pork - was good, even better when the BBQ sauce was added to each bite.Lamb Belly - kind of amazing, succulent with a great lamb flavor without being gamy or greasy.  Not your typical BBQ, but worth a try if you like lamb.Hot Wings - I never thought I'd go to a BBQ place and order hot wings, but after hearing about how good they were I couldn't pass them up.  They were divine.  Fried perfectly without being heavy and covered with a sriracha honey sauce - they were sweet and spicy and delectable.  The ranch dressing served on the side is awesome.As if that wasn't enough, we tried some sides as well.Collard greens, potato salad, coleslaw and pickles.  All were good and went well with the meat; were they purely original and amazing? No but they did the job and enhanced the meal.Nice beer selection at the bar.I enjoyed the vibe of the place; energetic, some great music playing, string lights adorning the ceiling.  It was a lovely evening.  We may have eaten dinner super early, but being able to enjoy the Hometown experience made it all worth it.  Don't be afraid to over order - there are takeout containers with the utensils so you can take leftovers home.",4.0
"Very spacious and chill restaurant. It's a place where you order your food, pay, they give you a stand with a number, you find an available place to sit, and when your food is already, someone will bring you your food. You order drinks at the bar, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic. The menu is on the wall. You get your own forks and napkins at the condiment area. In the same area there are also to-go boxes and bags that you can get yourself if you didn't finish your food. And free self serve water. We ended up sitting at the bar, since the tables were pretty much all occupied. Sitting at the bar is a good option. The counter was spacious and there are hooks under to hang your coat and bag. We had:1. Jamacian jerk baby back ribs, a half rack for ($17). It wasn't spicy. Ribs were pretty good, well smoked, and the sauces that they have makes the meat taste even better. 2. Brisket tacos, topped with salsa verde, pickled red onion, sour cream, and cilantro. 3 for ($12). This was not that memorable. Just okay and for the price it should've been bomb. 3. Collard greens with smoked pork shoulder, small size for ($4). Needed some greens to go along with the meats and the pork made the greens taste a lot better.4. Hometown slaw, small size for ($4). I don't think they put mayonnaise. It was missing that. 5. Arnold palmer, which is mix ice tea and lemonade drink ($3). Between the 2 of us, it was the right portion and we were full. This is a good spot to hang out. Group friendly.",4.0
"To get to Hometown Bar-B-Que from my apartment in Manhattan, I hop on the A train for ~20 minutes then switch over to the B61 bus for another 15-20 minutes, and the trek is absolutely worth it.  The vibes are perfect are in this barn-style BBQ joint, and the smoky, delicious aromas overtake you as soon as you approach the entrance.  The food tastes as good as it smells, and it stands up to BBQ I've eaten in Texas.  The pulled pork was tender and moist, complemented by Hometown's sauces and the sweet but not too creamy coleslaw.  The cornbread wasn't spectacular, but the meal itself was finger-licking good.  I need to go back and try the brisket and ribs, and just about everything else on the menu.",5.0
"This has consistently been the best BBQ I've had in the Northeast (even after many visits to Dinosaur BBQ in Syracuse, NY). The brisket is always smoked to perfection, the collard greens are just PERFECT, and the mac & cheese is ooey gooey goodness. The vibe of the restaurant is great, the playlist is usually on point, and the bartenders always attentive.Can't ask for much more in a BBQ joint!",5.0
"The lamb-belly, beef-rib, and beef-brisket are phenomenally & sensationally cooked, but, unfortunately, get boring after a few bites. It's very succulent, overwhelming meat, and it needs something to cut the fat, maybe some lemon-lime-grapefruit-orange zest and/or juice, but the two sauces they provide really don't do it for me, at all. The sauces are tasty on their own, but they are too thick and too sugary for the meat, and don't actually enhance the experience, but, rather, are conflicting & actually disguise the meaty-meatiness. So maybe next time I'll just order these meats in sandwich form, which is a shame, but I'm sure they will be delicious. Jamaican Spare-ribs and Sriracha Chicken-wings are definitely a winner, and absolutely crowdpleasers, as are the amazing beans with brisket. The potato salad is hit or miss, one time it was way too raw-vinegary, caustic and acrid, but last night it was bangin' spot-on terrific. And I really just do not like their mac and cheese or their cornbread. Awesome location, secluded and spacious. Helpful, friendly staff. Nice atmosphere, warm ambiance.",4.0

Brisket has the perfect bark as you would hope.  The  ribs are tender but not mush that slop off the bone like you see with fake BBQ.  A little tug and this smokey meat pulls off the bone with ease with no sauce needed or desired, which is a true test of proper BBQ.  If you need sauce, your not eating BBQ.  Next up.. Pastrami bacon?  As if the visit wasn't a home run already?  Now it was a grand slam... Thick cut slab bacon with an intense pastrami rub.  As for sides, I only had the beans and corn bread, which were both equally stellar.   The beans could almost be considered BBQ since they were packed with copious amount of burnt ends.  If you didn't have an amazing view of the Statue of Liberty only half a block away you may think your in another part of the country more well-known for BBQ",5.0
What can I even say. Overpriced but delicious. You must eat everything hot and right away because once the food gets cold it's no longer good. Probably the best pulled pork I've ever had. So juicy and flavorful. The brisket was great hot but once it gets cooler it's dry and not as good. The Mac and cheese was EXTRA cheesy. Great and flavorful but only hot. Like I said the colder it gets the worse it gets. The wings were delicious but a little too spicy for my taste. The cornbread was amazing. Usually cornbread is dry but this one has a honey butter glaze and it's the perfect side. Spent about $53 on this meal to share with a friend. A little too much food but wanted to try everything.

"Hands down best BBQ in Brooklyn!!!Finally made it over here after seeing and hearing great things about this place. The location is a bit inconvenient  as Redhook is on the edge of nowhere, nowhere meaning minimal transportation but its totally worth it!You can smell the BBQ from outside before you even walk in. Walk past the picnic style tables and jump on the line! The menu is an amazing array of Bbq meats you really cant go wrong with any selection. If Im not mistaken I think they will give you a sample if you ask for it. Considering the fact that there is no actual table service this place is pricey but its worth it. If you are not getting a sandwich they weigh the meat by the pound.I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with cole slaw and the queso mac n' cheese. The pulled pork was delicious on a yummy soft bun. Cole slaw can truly be a hit or miss but even that was delish. The mac n' cheese was amazing. The blend of cheese whatever that was was so good! It had a bit of a spicy kick that I loved!

Sides were Mac n cheese, corn bread, beans and potato salad. Brisket - they knocked the brisket out of the park. I had a solid end cut and the bark was perfect. Great smoke ring. Didn't even need a knife to cut it. Pulled Pork. It was good, but probably my least favorite. A bit fatty for me. Sausage - spot on. They have their own take and it was excellent. Chicken - excellent. All of the sides were great. I've never been a potato salad guy by they really did it well. My only regret was not getting a beef rib. Will definitely be back.  For you fellow jersey folks, the area was easy to get to and parking not a problem. A fairly kid friendly area and good walking to be had.",5.0

"One of the closest Texas experiences you can get up here in Brooklyn! Came here with a fellow Texas transplant a couple weeks ago, and we were both thoroughly impressed. The place has counter service. Lines can build up during peak hours, but moves pretty quick. We got a pound of moist brisket, a beef rib, jalapeno sausage, cole slaw, and mac&cheese. Everything was superb. Brisket was ultra-moist and fatty, snap apart tender, no knife needed - it just melts in your mouth! Good without the sauce if you're a purist, but the two sauces supplied at the table side were both delicious - one a more traditional/sweet one, and another tasting slightly spicy (almost like Sriracha infused). Beef rib was great - meat was super tender with a beautiful bark. Jalapeno sausage was good too. No disappointments on anything we ordered.Love the vibe of the place too. Wooden tables, strung out lights, live blue-grass band playing, Shiner on tap. Seriously, there were times I forgot I was in NY and thought I was back home in Texas.  Billy Durney has a real winner here...although not surprising at all given that his craft has been honed with the likes of Wayne Mueller (a real Texas BBQ legend and class act). Make no mistake, if Hometown BBQ set up shop in Texas it could hold its own. This place is definitely worth the trek to Red Hook for any BBQ lovers out there.",5.0

But I could have made a meal just of the sides. The potato salad was the best I have ever had. Loaded with dill, it killed me to share it. The BBQ beans had huge chunks of burnt end brisket in it. Incredible, meaty flavor. Not spicy.The Mac and cheese was awesome. We got sauce on side, as it is spicy and the daughter was eating it. I recommend always asking for sauce on side because it is incredible and you will get more sauce. The wings were okay, but not worth ordering over anything else.",5.0
"A winning combination of nitrates, twang and alcohol. With a couple of guys in flannel plucking out some country tunes on a small stage in the back, three of us valiantly tried to consume several pounds of protein-based food, with a solitary side of cucumbers thrown in for good measure. We failed, of course, but not without stretching the lining of our stomaches or ensuring that we would not need to eat again until sometime the next afternoon. There are other barbecque options in New York, sure, even ones that don't require taking the Ikea ferry or walking half a mile from the F train. Some of those options are really top notch - God knows, I've eaten at nearby all of them. Hometown is the most balanced option, where there's a great atmosphere, solid selection of beverages and a quality food. Being so far out means there's much more space than at a place like the original Mighty Quinn's, where it can seem like you are supposed to have a pound of brisket in seven minutes. Here's there time for another round. They've also figured out a way for ordering to move at a reasonable place - please take note Fette Sau - while still allowing you to customize your order. A couple of the stranger things on the menu, mainly the thick cut pieces of bacon and Korean smoked wings, wound up being favorites of the table. Brisket and pork were nice as well, there's certainly plenty of work that went into getting this food to table. And since many people have to journey pretty far to enjoy this, that's only fair.",5.0
"Hands down best BBQ in Brooklyn!!!Finally made it over here after seeing and hearing great things about this place. The location is a bit inconvenient  as Redhook is on the edge of nowhere, nowhere meaning minimal transportation but its totally worth it!You can smell the BBQ from outside before you even walk in. Walk past the picnic style tables and jump on the line! The menu is an amazing array of Bbq meats you really cant go wrong with any selection. If Im not mistaken I think they will give you a sample if you ask for it. Considering the fact that there is no actual table service this place is pricey but its worth it. If you are not getting a sandwich they weigh the meat by the pound.I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with cole slaw and the queso mac n' cheese. The pulled pork was delicious on a yummy soft bun. Cole slaw can truly be a hit or miss but even that was delish. The mac n' cheese was amazing. The blend of cheese whatever that was was so good! It had a bit of a spicy kick that I loved! I will indeed be returning here to try other things on the menu perhaps maybe the brisket next time!",5.0
Great bbq + a cool space + live music + great beer and whiskey selection = five stars.,5.0
Vietnamese wings... I have never tasted wings this amazing/ brined smoked and fried - leaves you with you licking your fingers because the glaze is beyond amazing - matched with the Pear Margarita !!!! Speechless - love the smell and atmosphere !!!,5.0
"Their sticky ribs are a bit overpriced but very flavorful and yummy. The pastrami bacon was juicy n fatty. Spare ribs can be better, tips were a bit dry. But their sauces are very good for this purpose. One of the things i learned this meal was to never order chicken when there's a table of meat. As good as siracha wings are, they will not beat the beef. I didnt have a big enough party, so i need to come back for the brisket. Sadly, sides are no good so that part of the meal was very lacking.",3.0
"Stellar BBQ. I travel to Texas so I'm always on the lookout for good Q. We were there on Sunday afternoon and the line was totally manageable. I had the brisket, pulled pork, chicken and sausage. Sides were Mac n cheese, corn bread, beans and potato salad. Brisket - they knocked the brisket out of the park. I had a solid end cut and the bark was perfect. Great smoke ring. Didn't even need a knife to cut it. Pulled Pork. It was good, but probably my least favorite. A bit fatty for me. Sausage - spot on. They have their own take and it was excellent. Chicken - excellent. All of the sides were great. I've never been a potato salad guy by they really did it well. My only regret was not getting a beef rib. Will definitely be back.  For you fellow jersey folks, the area was easy to get to and parking not a problem. A fairly kid friendly area and good walking to be had.",5.0
"Wow! I will never understand the hype about this place?  Just because they charge you $16 for a half a pound of brisket, and $8 for some pickles doesn't mean it's the best brisket you have ever had!   And don't worry I have had my fare share of mouthwatering amazing BBQ's all over the country!  This ain't one of them...There meat was below average, both in taste, and  texture,  it wasn't smoked enough, you felt it in the dryness of the meat..so yes when I confronted them they refunded my brisket, but I don't believe poeple should be fooled...  Bottom line:  this should be an example of how to make money, there business plan is amazing!  The decor, the location, and the way they serve you is perfect.",1.0
"I'm always looking for a great BBQ place in New York, being a lifetime New Yorker I am so glad that I came across Hometown bbq let me just say this place is AWESOME.  I've been to a few in the city and I have enjoyed most but Hometown is hands down the best!!! From the brisket to the homemade Italian sausage Hometown has it all.  it's a perfect just hang out have great BBQ a few drinks and enjoy the ambiance. And don't forget the cornbread...... the food is delicious bbq is on point!!!! You won't be disappointed... And if you happen to go on the weekend and it's crowded please DON'T BE SURPRISED IT'S NEW YORK PEOPLE!",5.0
"One of the closest Texas experiences you can get up here in Brooklyn! Came here with a fellow Texas transplant a couple weeks ago, and we were both thoroughly impressed. The place has counter service. Lines can build up during peak hours, but moves pretty quick. We got a pound of moist brisket, a beef rib, jalapeno sausage, cole slaw, and mac&cheese. Everything was superb. Brisket was ultra-moist and fatty, snap apart tender, no knife needed - it just melts in your mouth! Good without the sauce if you're a purist, but the two sauces supplied at the table side were both delicious - one a more traditional/sweet one, and another tasting slightly spicy (almost like Sriracha infused). Beef rib was great - meat was super tender with a beautiful bark. Jalapeno sausage was good too. No disappointments on anything we ordered.Love the vibe of the place too. Wooden tables, strung out lights, live blue-grass band playing, Shiner on tap. Seriously, there were times I forgot I was in NY and thought I was back home in Texas.  Billy Durney has a real winner here...although not surprising at all given that his craft has been honed with the likes of Wayne Mueller (a real Texas BBQ legend and class act). Make no mistake, if Hometown BBQ set up shop in Texas it could hold its own. This place is definitely worth the trek to Red Hook for any BBQ lovers out there.",5.0

"If you love BBQ then head over to Redhook, Brooklyn & check out Hometown BBQ. As soon as I stepped my foot in the door, I was slapped in the face with the smell of delicious smoky meat. This huge barn style restaurant is filled with tables, two big bars (one in the front room & the other in the back room), & a stage for live music (check out the board for event dates). If you like brisket, order the ""fatty"" version so you can get a moist piece since the lean meat is sorta on the dry side. The brisket pairs well with Hometown's ""Sticky"" sauce. When I saw the pastrami bacon, I was so disappointed that I didn't order a pound because I did not want to share it. It was a quarter pound of beauty. It was so juicy & flavorful that I ate it alone: no sauce, no side, just the meat. I was left wanting more. Both the brisket & the pastrami bacon had a memorable crusty bark that was well seasoned & added some sweetness to the meat, which I loved. I am not a fan of lamb but I like to explore new things so I got the lamb belly. The flavor was musky & it wasn't as gamy as I expected it to be but I added some of the ""Sweet & Spicy"" sauce to fix that. Then to end my meat journey, I ended with the Korean Sticky Ribs, which are smoked & fried. The meat is tender & glazed with sticky sauce.There are so many BBQ joints in NYC & Hometown BBQ is by far one of the best so add them to your list.",5.0
"I really wanted to like this place as it was recommended by a good friend.The menu is packed with standard Barbecue fare, we chose brisket, the Chinese sticky ribs, collard greens, potato salad and cornbread. The brisket was good, but it was a little dry, and not warm enough.The potato salad was more like a potato spread, it confused me. A simple mayo and yellow mustard based potato salad would have been great.The cornbread was topped with what I think was simple syrup before being served, making it just too sweet.The Chinese sticky ribs were great, very nice.The collard greens were perfect, just perfect.I've been cooking this type of food most of my adult life, my standards are high.What I know is that if you keep things simple the food is better. They're missing the mark ...I also think the price point is a little high.Simple white bread would have been a great addition.I'll be back for the pulled pork sandwich soon ...",3.0
"So good. The sauce, the meat, the flavor, and their dining room is just a pleasure to be in with the BBQ smell all around you.

This is the most inefficient system on the face of the earth.  I will never return.  Standing in line for well over an hour while they serve one party at a time.  Seriously...one party at a time!  The food was good -- but not excellent.  Plenty of good barbecue places that don't take 1.5 hours to get served.,1.0
"Suddenly, New York is a BBQ heavyweight. Thanks in large part to places like Hometown Bar-B-Que.Being in Red Hook, they have a sprawling outpost just north of the Erie Basin. But even with a huge bar, dining room, and bandstand area, this place gets packed. Like, if-you-don't-get-there-by-2:00pm-on-a-Saturday-you're-screwed sort of packed. For good reason - the BBQ'ed lamb belly itself is worth the long subway trek from the city.Besides that unique menu item (I've never seen lamb belly on a BBQ menu), they do the prerequisite brisket that's become ubiquitous around these parts. They also feature a giant beef rib that's almost a meal all by itself. Price wise, it's about what you'd expect to see at fellow charred meats juggernaut, Fette Sau. It's all sold by the pound, but beware of the sticker shock with the rib. It's $25/pound and our rib weighed close to 1.75 pounds. That equates to almost $50 tacked onto the check. I thought there was an error on the bill until we realized what was happening. Keep that in mind when your eyes become bigger than your stomach during the ordering process.From an ambiance and quality perspective, this is as close as I've come to feeling like I'm in Austin. It's the kind of place you could spend several hours at. You'll be broke from hanging for said hours, but it'll be worth it.",4.0
"So to be fair, I was deathly ill when my friends and I waited an hour+ in the longest line for BBQ I've ever see in my life. I mean DEATHLY ill. I shouldn't have been out, mama would not have been proud, and my fever/flu/cough/cold was preventing me from smelling ANYTHING. And I mean ANYTHING....which is how I suppose I lasted an hour+ waiting for food after trekking downtown and across the ferry (from East Village) on an empty stomach. My friends were dying over the smell, growing hungrier by the second and salivating with every step we took closer to the cashier. But not me, I have no idea what Hometown smells like. That's a pretty amazing feat, to be sitting in a BBQ pit for 2 hours basically and not even know it. I win. So though my nose couldn't advise, I guessed this was going to be pretty good- given the massive line that snaked all the way through one room to another in the warehouse sized space. Two bars, strong bloodies, sprawling wood tables, live music, and chicken wing samples make the wait pretty bearable, especially in good company :) I will say, if the line get this insane (can't imagine what it's like in Summer ugh) and the space is THIS huge, how is there not a 2ND CASHIER?!??? One person takes orders and money while another serves the food up... behind a counter that takes up approximately 1/1000th of the building space.... why not expand, make two lines, get things moving faster?? There is AMPLE room. Truly I'm perplexed by this. Though I definitely wasn't tasting food at full capacity, my belly knew well enough this is finger-licking goodass BBQ. The ribs, SAUCE, mac & cheese, and baked beans were a comfort to my cold, but the cornbread was just OK- lacked moistness. Mighty Quinn's has better. And speaking of Mighty Quinn's, my only complaint about Hometown is that it's quite pricy for BBQ. A $40 dinner might be normal at a restaurant (where I don't stand waiting for over an hour sipping bloddy mary's) but seems a bit high for meat and 3 sides? Pretty certain last time I ate Mighty Quinn's and got the same meal I paid $12-15 less, so not sure who's valuing the market price of beans and pasta noodles at Hometown but I think they might be overcharging on the sides a bit. Other than that, PLACE IS ACE!!",4.0

"When it comes to BBQ, there is no playing around. Either you have it or you don't. Hometown Bar-B-Que has it. (And its in Brooklyn thankyouverymuch)I've seen BBQ places lose their quality.

Juicy and tasty, it was something I didn't know I would like but I was wrong.Korean Sticky Ribs: We had two orders, it was ok. I wish I ordered more brisket.I want to point out, there was sauces on the table. I was in a meat coma at this point. The BBQ was cooked so perfectly, there was no need for sauce.Lets continue to sides.Queso mac and cheese: I ordered a large, it was large and in charge! Creamy and dreamy, it was a fan by all of us.Sour pickles: I liked it but they were overkill at this point. One or two would have been nice, My youngest didn't like them so we were all eating his portion. Burnt ends and beans: Deelsh!

"Hometown is the most hyped up, written about, and overrated restaurant I've ever been to other than Peter Lugars. The place is indeed beautiful and spacious (especially if you're not trying to get here during prime weekend times) but the food just isn't that good. It's not necessarily ""bad"" perse but I wouldn't rate it as above average. My girlfriend and I tried the cornbread ($3/slice), lamb belly ($12/.5lb), pulled pork ($11/.5lb), siracha wings ($8/6), whiskey sour pickles ($4/sm side), and burnt end beans ($6/med side). The way it works is that you order everything you want per weight (there are minimum weight requirements depending on the meat) at the counter followed by sides, and then you pay and find a seat. They then bring you the food when it's ready. There is a full bar on the side you can order from as well.The good:-The cornbread was moist and flavorful. -The lamb belly (don't think fatty pork belly, it's basically like pulled pork with lamb meat). This was super tender and had a good flavor to it. -Service was friendly-Space is quite beautiful in an industrial kind of wayThe not so good:-The pulled pork was nearly flavorless. There was no smokey flavor to it, no seasonings, and though it was tender, it needed one of their two BBQ sauces on it to give it any real flavor. -The whiskey sour pickles weren't anything special and mind as well come from a vlassic jar. -Prices for everything was a bit steep-Beers weren't that cold-The location is not easy to get to via train/subway but wasn't an issue for me as it was a quick 2 mile bike ride. The bad:-The burnt end beans had a good amount of meat in them but not only was there no smoke flavor or real seasonings but it just tasted overwhelmingly like jarred tomato sauce. -The siracha wings were more gristly than most wings I've had and despite me not liking spicy things (the wings were for my girlfriend) I was actually able to have one of the wings without experiencing any real heat (really defeating the purpose of a siracha hot wing).Even in some of the glowing reviews of the place reviewers have been a bit disappointed with their ribs so that's why I skipped that. The banana pudding is supposedly amazing so if I ever come back for more of the lamb belly and cornbread (unlikely) I'll have to check that out.

"Holy. Crap.  Best BBQ in NYC!  The bark on their meats is unreal.  They smoke and barbecue all of their meats on site.  The meat is wonderfully juicy, tender, and seasoned.  Went here twice with my coworkers and both times, our eyes were bigger than our stomachs but no one complained about that.  The portions are generous and so damn tasty!  The shirt rib is monstrous and probably my favorite.  The turkey breast was the most shocking, I have never eaten a turkey breast that was so flavorful and juicy.  The jalapeno and cheese sausage was irresistible.  We all were beyond words with the flavors and veteran barbecuing technique.    I love the ambiance, it's super chill and communal.  I dream of this BBQ and whenever someone mentions BBQ, this is the first place I think of.  I even went to a famous BBQ place out in St. Louis, which doesn't even come close to the awesomeness of Hometown.  Hometown is the real deal, don't believe me try it for yourself.  You won't be disappointed.",5.0

"This place was awesome!  The ribs were perfectly smoked and their BBQ sauce is amazing.  Their mac & cheese had the perfect amount of cheese, cheesy but not overly cheesy.  Their baked beans were very hearty.  The pieces of brisket gave them a nice touch.  The coleslaw was very fresh but I wasn't too much of a fan.  The potato salad was creamy and tangy which was pleasantly different.  I tasted the brisket which was great!  The chipotle chicken also had a nice smoke flavor to it.  The salsa verde and pickled onions on top were a great touch.  I ordered a quarter chicken and they were considerate enough to ask if I preferred white or dark meat.What did it for me though was the sriracha hot wings.  These wings were by far the best wings I've ever tasted.  Hands down.  If you're a sriracha fan (I'm obsessed) these are a must-have!  They're crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, right amount of spice and just overall great flavor. *Note: I tend to have a higher spice tolerance.  The cilantro ranch sauce that came with the wings was thick and tasted homemade.Side note: I waited 45 minutes but you're able to have drinks while you wait in line which makes it more tolerable.  The staff was very friendly and attentive.  They have a station where they keep their plates, utensils, napkins, etc.  It was very convenient to package your own food and go.  No waiting around for servers.",5.0

We waited for a long time and maybe if the food wasn't so amazing, I would have been pissed.

"Hometown is the most hyped up, written about, and overrated restaurant I've ever been to other than Peter Lugars. The place is indeed beautiful and spacious (especially if you're not trying to get here during prime weekend times) but the food just isn't that good. It's not necessarily ""bad"" perse but I wouldn't rate it as above average. My girlfriend and I tried the cornbread ($3/slice), lamb belly ($12/.5lb), pulled pork ($11/.5lb), siracha wings ($8/6), whiskey sour pickles ($4/sm side), and burnt end beans ($6/med side). The way it works is that you order everything you want per weight (there are minimum weight requirements depending on the meat) at the counter followed by sides, and then you pay and find a seat. They then bring you the food when it's ready. There is a full bar on the side you can order from as well.The good:-The cornbread was moist and flavorful. -The lamb belly (don't think fatty pork belly, it's basically like pulled pork with lamb meat).

All of it. The best though? The sticky ribs. Don't leave without putting one of these in your mouth.A few notes:1.

"Hometown has recently earned a reputation for being the best BBQ in the city, and it is pretty immediately obvious why. It is incredibly authentic to Texas BBQ standards, particularly Austin or Hill Country bbq markets, with lots of wood and a pervasive haze of meat smoke that fills the air. The space is pretty huge, taking up a fairly large warehouse, though there isn't as much seating as you'd expect, so be prepared for a wait. The bar is big and has a nice selection of Texas beer and some craft choices, but nothing goes better with bbq than a Shiner. The food is decadently wonderful and incredibly succulent. The sriracha wings are a must order for anyone who likes spice. They have a perfect crispness to the skin and the sriracha is perfectly glazed on, not just globbed on top after cooking. The white sauce (is it ranch, or bleu cheese, or yogurt?) is perfect with these to take out some heat as well. The wings nudged out even the amazing brisket (get the moist, not the lean) for favorite dish at our table. The brisket is clearly cooked for eons with love and attention and has an incredible ""bark"", or skin surrounding it that is packed with texture and flavor. Slather on some of the delicious ""sticky"" and hot sauces from the table too as these together create a delicious potion of flavor and heat. The jerk baby back ribs were also solid, but they didn't compare as well to the other delicious items. These had the same sauce as the wings, though weren't nearly as heat packed. The skin and seasoning was perfect on them, but I could have used a little more heat or jerk flavor. Still delicious though and I'll never get sick of tearing ribs apart with my hands like a caveman.

"IN SHORT: When you finally decide to start exploring the limits of the city beyond Manhattan, Hometown Bar-B-Que in Red Hook should be one of the first stops. With a festive, vibrant atmosphere and a ton of meat for a carnivorous party, it is the perfect restaurant for those looking for a little adventure. But yes, it's okay if you take an Uber to get there.THE STORY: Sometimes, it can be hard to love New York. It can be hard to love the sweltering heat of the subway in the summer, the mountains of black sludgy snow in the winter, the feeling of getting hip checked by Elmo in Times Square, the claustrophobia of the dank, underground corridors of Penn Station. It can be hard to love a city where there is always someone in the room with more money or more power, where a 50-year old walk-up apartment can sell for $1,000 per square foot, and where a 1-mile cab trip can cost $20 in traffic.Yes, New York can be really hard to love. But if there is just one lovable thing to take away from the city, it is that New York has an uncanny ability to be everything to everyone all at once, and that itself is a little magical.Deep in the post-industrial neighborhood of Red Hook at Hometown Bar-B-Que, New York can be Texas, Kansas City, an old barnyard, or your grandfather's garage. Here, with barbecue that upholds the essence of that local culinary culture, New York can fulfill your Southern fantasies and satisfy your nostalgia for country, all while providing pounds of juicy, tender ribbons of meat.Indeed, led by New York-raised Bill Durney who trained with some of the great pitmasters from around the country, Hometown Bar-B-Que has created the barbecue of the city.The Beef Ribs are the unanimous star, with lightly smoked meat coated with a thick layer of dark, cracked peppercorns that falls apart under its own tender weight, though the Brisket, also cooked roughly Texas-style, is a close second. The beef brisket has a classic layer of thick ""bark,"" the crunchy, sweet, caramelized crust that seems to bind all the juices of the meat together while it is smoked. The effect of the smoke is subtle, just one flavor of the complex, beefy experience, but it marries perfectly with the house ""Sticky"" sauce, whose tomato-based Kansas City influences are evident.While the cow is the most beloved animal on the menu in this massive, 4,500 square foot space, the Jerk Chicken is also a casual success - soft, slightly spicy, and not the least bit dull. Most people won't write home about the sides, but at a recent work dinner in one of the two spacious dining rooms, the coleslaw was praised for its freshness and crunch, and the dense, moist cornbread was finished ravenously.Because of its size, Hometown Bar-B-Que has become a great place for groups, particularly large parties of 15 or more people who can be served family style with a pre-selected menu. For just an ordinary night with friends, however, regular service is at the counter through the bar and pit area. Here an American flag mural covers a large wall, string lights decorate the wood beam ceiling, and live music plays on Friday and Saturday nights for a charming and authentic effect that makes every guest from Bushwick to the Bronx feel that they are suddenly down home in New York.With such gorgeously prepared meat, Hometown Bar-B-Que would be a good restaurant even if it was in the heart of the barbecue belt. But because of the way it has occupied New York's conscious, it is now a great restaurant. It is barbecue for New York, whatever we want that to mean.It may be easy to hate New York, but Hometown Bar-B-Que will make anyone fall in love with it, if only for a night.More on onehungryblonde.com",4.0

The pulled pork sandwich was served with cole slaw on the sandwich, and you can add their sticky sweet BBQ sauce or their hot and spicy. Both are very good.

"""Get on your bikes and ride!"" Hometown Bar-B-Que is an excellent destination for Manhattanites to plot into their weekend cycle tour of the boroughs; my friends and I rolled in, locked up our rides, and ordered just about everything on the menu between the six of us.As a longtime Mighty Quinn's brisket fan, I came ready for a fight. Can't say Hometown was able to beat the ""champ"" as I saw it, but there were those with me who had a more difficult time saying so.All that brisket business aside though, the undisputed Heavyweight Champion of Brooklyn is no doubt the Beef Rib. This behemoth cannot be ignored - the crusting on it was incredible, rich and complex, and the meat inside was more moist and juicy than the finest filet mignon.Throw a belt on this one, no one is going to dethrone him.Just for fun, get yourself a quarter pound of the Lamb Belly, too. It's different than a lot of other NYC BBQ offerings, and plays nicely with the sauce.",4.0
"Tuck away in Red Hook, this place is a gem. Space? Decor reminds me of some of the great eateries in Austin, TX with lights, wood furniture everywhere, music and happy voices all over.  There was a live band when we went on a Saturday and it made the vibe perfect.  The owner and the staff are the utmost hospitable folks around and made sure everyone had a good time.  There is also a lively bar with a nice selection on tap. Food? I loved the smoked meats and all of the delicious sides.  Enjoyed the brisket, spare ribs, sausages, and pastrami bacon. The mac and cheese has a nice spice to it, collard greens and potato salad is on point, and the beans were eaten up by our party.  And you must try the dessert: banana creme and chocolate pudding.  Tip: you'll have to wait in line, but there is ample seating by the time you order.  And you can take your leftovers and they'll be just as good the next day. Will come again just to experience good food and great vibes.",5.0
"I wanted to give this place 5 stars so bad but the wait time is ridiculous. We stood online for an hour on a Sunday evening around 7. It was packed! Maybe they need to add more employees. But the good it's like a BBQ indoors. The food is really good. I had the macaroni and cheese, collard greens, cornbread, potatoe salad and chipotle chicken all costing $34 without drinks. The staff is friendly and they had a band playing in the other room. I'll definitely come back just not on a weekend.",4.0
"It was a bit of a journey to get here, if you have a car (or grab a friend with a car), I recommend driving. Looks like an oldschool barn, and has two spacious rooms with plenty of seating. The wait was a little agonizing- the line moved soooo slowly. 10 ppl in front of us and we waited 30 min. I was eyeing everyone else's food... growing hungrier by the minute. When it was finally our turn, we ordered ambitiously: pulled pork sandwich, 1/2 lb brisket, korean sticky ribs, pastrami bacon, pickles, and slaw. (this was for 2 ppl, don't judge because you will regret not doing the same). The korean sticky ribs and pastrami bacon were definitely interesting and definitely delicious, highly recommend trying. We ordered those sides specifically to cut through the heaviness/fattiness of so much meat. Love the casual country vibe, and ate so much food that I could barely walk outta there.",4.0
"This place was advertised to me as ""the best BBQ in NYC"", a lofty claim for an establishment of any kind.  But I had read it over and over again.  So, when my friend told me she was making the pilgrimage out to Red Hook to try it, I decided to tag along as her support system for the long journey and to try the best brisket in town myself.Womp womp wooooomp.  Brisket was dryer than a piece of burnt toast!  I'm sure this was just an off day, but c'mon!  The space was very cool, and the sides were actually great, but the main event was nothing special in the slightest.  I have had better brisket from many places in the city, and they didn't require 2 subways and 2 buses to get there.  It seems that the more and more I follow the claims of ""best whatever in the city"", the more and more I find them to be....not that.  Maybe I'm in the wrong here, and I hope I just went of the wrong (freezing ass cold) day.  But, regardless, I do not see myself venturing back out to see if these guys will prove me wrong.",2.0
"I have never been more surprised at such glowing reviews for a restaurant I would never return to. I have so much to say about this placeSet-UpThis is one of the strangest set-ups I've ever seen.  There is one menu displayed against the wall where you order food.  One guy takes your meat order and then the other guy takes your ""sides"" order and then totals you up and you pay.  I looked around to see why he didn't ask for my beverage order then realized I have to go to the bar.The BarI ordered two diet cokes.  The bartender filled up my two glasses with 3/4  ice.  When I mentioned to her ""not so much ice"", she said ""there are free refills"" however too much ice had nothing to do with me being too cheap to buy another diet coke; I just don't like a lot of ice.  The ""bartendress"" should not have made assumptions.  All she had to do was dump 1/2 the ice out and fill my diet cokes from the tap but instead she choose to dump the entire ice contents with attitude and force.  (I would not want to meet up with her in an alley).  They should have a separate station for soft drinks.  Of course, this is just my opinion but it was a nuisance to have finally gotten your food and then have to go to a bar to get your soda.  It wasn't busy when I went but what if it was? Does that mean my food gets cold while waiting to get my soda?The AtmosphereIt had a nice homey atmosphere with a main room where you order the food and can sit in that area go to the back room where you sit family style with long benches.  Against the wall is comfy seating but if you sit in a chair, you have to be a child or kind of thin to be comfortable. This was my first (and last) time here but it seemed like there were little kids everywhere running around.  Fine, I get it that this isn't a place you dress in tuxes and evening gowns but I did find all the kids annoying (and yes I know this is the result of parents not controlling their kids and not the restaurant's fault).   And maybe it was just my bad luck but they were playing awful music and was too loud.The FoodAll complaints could be forgiven if the food were better.  One of us got 1/2 rack of the baby back ribs.  She almost never complains but she said it was inedible.  It was very fatty and tough.  She wound up bringing it back and they were courteous and replaced it with something else.  I had the brisket sandwich which was good but nothing spectacular (and needed help from the sauces on the table).   The corn bread was also good.  The mac and cheese was flavorless, had a weird consistency and was left over; no one wanted it (did you ever hear of anyone passing up mac and cheese?).   Surprisingly, the best thing were the beans which were sweet and meaty with big chunks of brisket.  The StaffThe two guys who handled the meat and sides were sweethearts and patient with all of us who were here for the first time but the bartender with an attitude kind of erased my good feelings.Last WordI guess for a neighborhood place, it's okay. When we went it was only about 6:30 but 1/2 hour later there was a long line.  I respect that they obviously have something here that people want and are willing to put up with long lines and inconvenience.   I might have enjoyed some other options; the problem is there isn't a compelling reason for me to return.",2.0
"Believe the hype. I think I have a new favorite BBQ place. Usually, when I go out for BBQ (or what we call BBQ in New York), places usually excel at one thing and the rest is just okay. Not so with Hometown. They do everything well or extraordinarily well. And I should know, I went with 3 drunk friends, and we basically tried everything on the menu. Note to self: don't ever do that again.A breakdown of our meal:-Brisket: nice and fatty, with one of the thickest smoke rings I've ever seen. Moist and cut thick.-Pulled pork: good, but not great. Add some of the delicious sticky sauce to it.-Jerk baby back ribs: jerk flavor wasn't overpowering, but they were nice and smoky. Also great with the sticky sauce.-Sriracha hot wings: yum. Crispy and not too spicy. 6 to an order. Of course, we did two orders.-Lamb belly: One of my favorite things on the menu. As fatty and as juicy as you'd expect.-Collard greens: because vegetables are healthy, right?Yes, Hometown is a bit out of the way, but it's definitely worth the journey. They have a great bar, sports playing on the TV, and tons of communal tables. Hope to be back when the weather's nicer!",5.0

In summart: damn good food, in the middle of nowhere with a long wait.",4.0
"""Get on your bikes and ride!"" Hometown Bar-B-Que is an excellent destination for Manhattanites to plot into their weekend cycle tour of the boroughs; my friends and I rolled in, locked up our rides, and ordered just about everything on the menu between the six of us.As a longtime Mighty Quinn's brisket fan, I came ready for a fight. Can't say Hometown was able to beat the ""champ"" as I saw it, but there were those with me who had a more difficult time saying so.All that brisket business aside though, the undisputed Heavyweight Champion of Brooklyn is no doubt the Beef Rib. This behemoth cannot be ignored - the crusting on it was incredible, rich and complex, and the meat inside was more moist and juicy than the finest filet mignon.Throw a belt on this one, no one is going to dethrone him.Just for fun, get yourself a quarter pound of the Lamb Belly, too. It's different than a lot of other NYC BBQ offerings, and plays nicely with the sauce.",4.0
"Tuck away in Red Hook, this place is a gem. Space? Decor reminds me of some of the great eateries in Austin, TX with lights, wood furniture everywhere, music and happy voices all over.  There was a live band when we went on a Saturday and it made the vibe perfect.  The owner and the staff are the utmost hospitable folks around and made sure everyone had a good time.  There is also a lively bar with a nice selection on tap. Food? I loved the smoked meats and all of the delicious sides.  Enjoyed the brisket, spare ribs, sausages, and pastrami bacon. The mac and cheese has a nice spice to it, collard greens and potato salad is on point, and the beans were eaten up by our party.  And you must try the dessert: banana creme and chocolate pudding.  Tip: you'll have to wait in line, but there is ample seating by the time you order.  And you can take your leftovers and they'll be just as good the next day. Will come again just to experience good food and great vibes.",5.0
"I wanted to give this place 5 stars so bad but the wait time is ridiculous. We stood online for an hour on a Sunday evening around 7. It was packed! Maybe they need to add more employees. But the good it's like a BBQ indoors. The food is really good. I had the macaroni and cheese, collard greens, cornbread, potatoe salad and chipotle chicken all costing $34 without drinks. The staff is friendly and they had a band playing in the other room. I'll definitely come back just not on a weekend.",4.0
"It was a bit of a journey to get here, if you have a car (or grab a friend with a car), I recommend driving. Looks like an oldschool barn, and has two spacious rooms with plenty of seating. The wait was a little agonizing- the line moved soooo slowly. 10 ppl in front of us and we waited 30 min. I was eyeing everyone else's food... growing hungrier by the minute. When it was finally our turn, we ordered ambitiously: pulled pork sandwich, 1/2 lb brisket, korean sticky ribs, pastrami bacon, pickles, and slaw. (this was for 2 ppl, don't judge because you will regret not doing the same). The korean sticky ribs and pastrami bacon were definitely interesting and definitely delicious, highly recommend trying. We ordered those sides specifically to cut through the heaviness/fattiness of so much meat. Love the casual country vibe, and ate so much food that I could barely walk outta there.",4.0
"This place was advertised to me as ""the best BBQ in NYC"", a lofty claim for an establishment of any kind.  But I had read it over and over again.  So, when my friend told me she was making the pilgrimage out to Red Hook to try it, I decided to tag along as her support system for the long journey and to try the best brisket in town myself.Womp womp wooooomp.  Brisket was dryer than a piece of burnt toast!  I'm sure this was just an off day, but c'mon!  The space was very cool, and the sides were actually great, but the main event was nothing special in the slightest.  I have had better brisket from many places in the city, and they didn't require 2 subways and 2 buses to get there.  It seems that the more and more I follow the claims of ""best whatever in the city"", the more and more I find them to be....not that.  Maybe I'm in the wrong here, and I hope I just went of the wrong (freezing ass cold) day.  But, regardless, I do not see myself venturing back out to see if these guys will prove me wrong.",2.0
"I have never been more surprised at such glowing reviews for a restaurant I would never return to. I have so much to say about this placeSet-UpThis is one of the strangest set-ups I've ever seen.  There is one menu displayed against the wall where you order food.  One guy takes your meat order and then the other guy takes your ""sides"" order and then totals you up and you pay.  I looked around to see why he didn't ask for my beverage order then realized I have to go to the bar.The BarI ordered two diet cokes.  The bartender filled up my two glasses with 3/4  ice.  When I mentioned to her ""not so much ice"", she said ""there are free refills"" however too much ice had nothing to do with me being too cheap to buy another diet coke; I just don't like a lot of ice.  The ""bartendress"" should not have made assumptions.  All she had to do was dump 1/2 the ice out and fill my diet cokes from the tap but instead she choose to dump the entire ice contents with attitude and force.  (I would not want to meet up with her in an alley).  They should have a separate station for soft drinks.  Of course, this is just my opinion but it was a nuisance to have finally gotten your food and then have to go to a bar to get your soda.  It wasn't busy when I went but what if it was? Does that mean my food gets cold while waiting to get my soda?The AtmosphereIt had a nice homey atmosphere with a main room where you order the food and can sit in that area go to the back room where you sit family style with long benches.  Against the wall is comfy seating but if you sit in a chair, you have to be a child or kind of thin to be comfortable. This was my first (and last) time here but it seemed like there were little kids everywhere running around.  Fine, I get it that this isn't a place you dress in tuxes and evening gowns but I did find all the kids annoying (and yes I know this is the result of parents not controlling their kids and not the restaurant's fault).   And maybe it was just my bad luck but they were playing awful music and was too loud.The FoodAll complaints could be forgiven if the food were better.  One of us got 1/2 rack of the baby back ribs.  She almost never complains but she said it was inedible.  It was very fatty and tough.  She wound up bringing it back and they were courteous and replaced it with something else.  I had the brisket sandwich which was good but nothing spectacular (and needed help from the sauces on the table).   The corn bread was also good.  The mac and cheese was flavorless, had a weird consistency and was left over; no one wanted it (did you ever hear of anyone passing up mac and cheese?).   Surprisingly, the best thing were the beans which were sweet and meaty with big chunks of brisket.  The StaffThe two guys who handled the meat and sides were sweethearts and patient with all of us who were here for the first time but the bartender with an attitude kind of erased my good feelings.Last WordI guess for a neighborhood place, it's okay. When we went it was only about 6:30 but 1/2 hour later there was a long line.  I respect that they obviously have something here that people want and are willing to put up with long lines and inconvenience.   I might have enjoyed some other options; the problem is there isn't a compelling reason for me to return.",2.0
"Believe the hype. I think I have a new favorite BBQ place. Usually, when I go out for BBQ (or what we call BBQ in New York), places usually excel at one thing and the rest is just okay. Not so with Hometown. They do everything well or extraordinarily well. And I should know, I went with 3 drunk friends, and we basically tried everything on the menu. Note to self: don't ever do that again.A breakdown of our meal:-Brisket: nice and fatty, with one of the thickest smoke rings I've ever seen. Moist and cut thick.-Pulled pork: good, but not great. Add some of the delicious sticky sauce to it.-Jerk baby back ribs: jerk flavor wasn't overpowering, but they were nice and smoky. Also great with the sticky sauce.-Sriracha hot wings: yum. Crispy and not too spicy. 6 to an order. Of course, we did two orders.-Lamb belly: One of my favorite things on the menu. As fatty and as juicy as you'd expect.-Collard greens: because vegetables are healthy, right?Yes, Hometown is a bit out of the way, but it's definitely worth the journey. They have a great bar, sports playing on the TV, and tons of communal tables. Hope to be back when the weather's nicer!",5.0

"Good place, extremely pricey!  There's multiple menus along the line to the counter which is cool.  I ordered a small amount of moist (tasted lean) brisket, a slice of the pastrami bacon, 1 beef rib, a small pickle and cornbread.  Outside of the fact that the brisket didn't taste like a moist brisket should (I know my brisket) I  didn't exactly love the cafeteria style setup.  Almost everything outside of meat and side service is self service.  From the utensils, to the to go containers, to ordering drinks, self self self.  Honestly the pastrami bacon made everything worthwhile, best thing I've eaten in a while.  Highlights: the beef rib, pastrami bacon (all bacon should be made this way), whiskey sour pickles and the cornbread. The food service and bartenders were cool.  It's pretty far out in Brooklyn but with the Ikea shuttle and the B61 there's ample ways to get there.  If it wasn't raining I would've explored the area more as there were many places to explore in that area going towards downtown Brooklyn.  Negatives: they need to step their bathroom game up.  While the bathroom I used in the back was nice, there was one, with no stalls so the lines that build are annoying.  I was told by an elderly lady the same bathroom situation was up front. I loved the fact however that there was a 2 - sided flusher, 1 for 1 and 2 for 2.  They were clean, smelled nice and there was ample toilet paper in there. Expect long lines toward the counter for food.  Even on a rainy day, in the early afternoon the line was long but they've figured out how to move it along fairly quickly.  Oh and getting wifi is not an easy feat.",4.0

Coleslaw, very good, really different, definitely thumbs up.Cornbread, good gosh this is totally worth the extra charge. It was so good you could dream of cornbread as a dessert.  It did not even need butter and we all know everything is better with butter.Pulled pork sandwich, if you love North Carolina pulled pork then this is it.

The pork was afreakingmazing!  I did not eat the top of the bun, but all the juicy goodness had soaked in the bottom of the bun and yes I ate it.

The beans were good, but i thought this was a little too sweet for my taste.

Not super smokey but a solid cup of collard greens.Brisket: i found this to be slightly disappointing. It was a bit dry but overall not bad. The bark was tasty though.Lamb belly: this is actually pulled and if you don't eat it fast  enough, the fat congeals. It was gamey but not overly so. It was tender and not dry. Definitely different and worth getting!The sausage: it was good. Great snap to it, kind of soft inside, great flavor, but that honey mustard really compliments it. Beef rib: highlight of the meal. Juicy thick beef rib with a fantastic bark. Tender and fatty, it was really a joy to have. I took the bone home to put in a chili!Overall i would definitely get the beef rib and cornbread every time!",4.0
"I've seen Hometown BBQ pop up on many ""Best of..."" lists as of late. I've been to many BBQ places in NYC, some better than others. Hometown BBQ is absolutely deserving of being on any of these lists. It's an adventure and an experience.My trip to get BBQ was also my first trip to Red Hook, so I got to take in some of the scenery of new areas of Brooklyn as the beau and I cruised down Columbia and Van Brunt Streets on the B61. The bus drops you off one block away, and the smell of smoking wood hits your nose immediately. Upon entering the lofty meat warehouse, I was pleased to see a relatively short line and tons of meat being sliced up in the far left corner. The menu provides many meaty options, from meats served by the half pound to sandwiches, wings, and tacos. Many traditionally BBQ-y sides are for sale as well, such as corn bread, collard greens, and mac & cheese. As much as I wanted a $25 piece of rib (and I'm not being facetious), the beau and I opted for sandwiches. I went the pulled pork route, while he opted for the brisket. We also split corn bread and mac & cheese.The food is just as wonderful as everyone claims it to be. The pork was so tender and melted in my mouth, and it was not bogged down by tons of sauces, truly letting the flavor of the pork and smoke come through. The brisket was delightfully tender as well, and it had a small bite to it. The mac and cheese, served with creamy queso, was so good, I had to stop myself from getting another order. (The food baby was already big enough from the sandwich.) The beau made a very lofty claim that the cornbread was some of the best he's EVER had. It was cake-like yet had that good cornmeal grain to it, along with a sweet honey-soaked top crust. After eating, we just sat there for about 15 minutes. We did not have the power to rise from our seats as our bodies did their best to start the digestion process.

"Four visits: an absolutely spectacular place. Newly opened when first visited, the brisket and ribs are unlike any other bbq north of the mason Dixon line. We met Bill at the smoker - a giant wood fired operation inside a couple of shipping containers around the corner from the joint itself. We sniffed it out, literally. Bill explained his process while poking a couple of fatty briskets and pork shoulders.Crusted in true Texas style, heavy pepper rub with little else.The full spare ribs are nearly the size of my forearm. Crusty and exploding with juices. Specked with pepper flakes and salt chunks. Pink almost all the way to the bone. The meat tears away easily from the bone.

Slightly spicy.The chicken wings are the only weak link - smoked but small and a little dry.Slightly pricey but the best bbq in NYC.",5.0
Best BBQ I've had in a very long time. This place makes the best BBQ beef ribs that I've had in New York. This place also does mostly dry rubs which I prefer because I don't like getting messy. Some dishes have a wet rub like the siracha wings which is nice if you wanna get messy.  Mac and cheese is pretty good. The cornbread is great. The potato salad is a little weird because it's mashed potatoes but tastes exactly like potato salad. I'd definitely come here again and this place easily becomes my #1 spot for BBQ in New York.,5.0
"All I can say is that visiting hometown today changed my life. I never knew what brisket was til today..... What in the hell was I waiting so long for.???? This place is on the expensive side but I could care less cuz it was worth every penny. I will definitely be going back to this place. The brisket, wings and ribs were off the hook. Mac and cheese was good and my liked the the greens. Place is good to go",5.0
"Came here early, got near everything on the menu. Pulled pork was Juicy, half of the brisket was great, other half was ok, but that's how it goes. The sticky ribs were the best thing on the menu, perfectly executed, little chew, little snap and tender meat. Turkey was by far the best I've ever had (I smoke my own annually and thought mine was pretty good, pales in comparison). St. Louis Ribs were ok, the Sticky Ribs is where its at. Pastrami bacon was perfectly smoked and then grilled, delicious. Sausages were great, corn bread was awesome. Beef ribs were good but I was full by the time we got it, will get it first next time.In short, get the sticky ribs, turkey and brisket (fatty side) and pastrami bacon with a side of corn bread and roll your ass home after for a nap.",5.0
"This is such an amazing place. Open seating arrangement is perfect for any size group. The smell of smoked meet is inviting. The food is freakin' delicious. The drinks are there if you wish so. Just an amazing time all around. On a good day, it could be a bit crowded - first time I came the line was around 40 minutes. But you can buy drinks separately while waiting to buy the food.",4.0
Some of the best pulled pork and brisket anywhere. I like the relaxed environment because you know the food is awesome if the seating and serving aren't the best. Worth it though. Good sides with delicious baked beans and corn bread. And the beer selection isn't bad,5.0
One of the best places for bbq in the city. Brisket is great. Spare ribs are bangin'. The lamb belly is amazing. It's all great.,5.0
I sampled the brisket here. It's pretty well cooked and moist. The outside crumbly and peppery which is awesome. I wish they could have fresh sauce make with meat juices.,4.0
"If it ""blows your mind"" why don't you leave a 5 star review? Yelp is so funny sometimes. 4 stars for mind blowing food? Pssshh. You can't spare a star? (in Jerry Seinfeld's voice). I've spared!5 stars because this is THE best BBQ I've ever had and the absolute best you'll ever find in NYC. I've been to Austin, TX to ""some of the best BBQ places in the world"" and Hometown takes the cake. Every single thing on the menu is incredible. Their potato salad will make you never want to eat another potato salad again and their brisket will make vegans change their minds. Thanks for bringing your TX swag to NYC, Hometown.",5.0
"cool little hot spot. I just moved back to Brooklyn from Austin Texas. This little bbq joint is has a relaxing atmosphere and its family friendly too. The bbq here is not as good as Texas bbq but still pretty good, especially if you need a bbq fix. I really liked the macaroni and cheese and I am not a Mac and cheese person. It's so cheesy and I like the red peppers in it too. I loved the corn bread it was so good and moist. The brisket was ok and pulled pork was very good. I will came back again with my little family. I would like to try other things on the menu.",4.0
"Four visits: an absolutely spectacular place. Newly opened when first visited, the brisket and ribs are unlike any other bbq north of the mason Dixon line. We met Bill at the smoker - a giant wood fired operation inside a couple of shipping containers around the corner from the joint itself. We sniffed it out, literally. Bill explained his process while poking a couple of fatty briskets and pork shoulders.Crusted in true Texas style, heavy pepper rub with little else.The full spare ribs are nearly the size of my forearm. Crusty and exploding with juices. Specked with pepper flakes and salt chunks. Pink almost all the way to the bone. The meat tears away easily from the bone. The fat is rendered into the meat and the cartiledge is almost melted away.Lamb bahn mi - crusty baguette - juicy lamb belly. Smoke flavoring throughout. Bark mixed well with the tender meat.

"A bit overrated.The meats were quite good - the brisket, the pastrami bacon, and the pulled pork.  The jerk ribs, however, were inconsistent even across the half-rack and were fine, but nothing to write home about.The sides were rather disappointing.  The potato salad had too much vinegar, the collard greens were rather flavorless other than having too much heat to them.  The beans were the highlight from among the sides, but were on par with what they should have been...nothing special.Live music started a bit too late, but the band was good.  Of course, getting a table in the room in which the music was being played was quite a feat.The ridiculous and bothersome aspects of this restaurant are as follow:1.  The line on a Saturday evening (not even prime time) wraps around the place and will easily take an hour to navigate.  The limited staff do nothing to aid with coordinating seating, don't do anything to move the process along or make sure that anyone is comfortable whatsoever.  Also, while you may agree that it feels wrong to lock up a table for the hour that you'll be in line, you really need to do so, otherwise you'll have bought your food and spend a long time waiting for a table to free up, by which time your food will likely be cold.2.  The prices are a bit high across the board for what you're getting.  I get that this is a hot-spot for the time being, but you would think it was conveniently located in a prime area of Manhattan the way they charge.  The sides are actually quite a ripoff.  I also think that there is something wrong with a place that doesn't show you the ultimate weight of the food you ordered and just presents you with a dollar amount at the end.  I am accustomed to either seeing the scale weight register in a place visible to the customer or getting an itemized receipt.  It generates an uncomfortable feeling.  Their business model is great, in theory, because they have a skeletal staff that is not available to you for anything that you'd find in a customary restaurant.3.  I find it odd that a BBQ place does not give you slices of white bread with which to make a sandwich, mop up sauces, etc.  Pretty hard to understand, since that's always been a part of the offerings at BBQ restaurants near and far.  Given the pricing and general attitude toward the customer, the experience, and the value, it is probably the nominal cost of ""free"" white bread that is a factor here, but I highly recommend that the owners revisit the subject and consider a change in policy.All in all, I enjoyed most of the food, but the experience was lacking.  I am unlikely to return to Hometown and, judging from the way we were handled, Hometown is riding too high on its buzz and that of Red Hook overall to care.  We'll see if the market forces its hand toward doing a little more for its customer.",3.0
"This place is in a random industrial area. Not much around it and there is not an easy way to get there. But its totally worth it. Some of the best brisket I've had. The place was nice.

"Seriously delicious, seriously pricey, but seriously worth it. Since first trying Hometown back in April, I have since been back on a monthly basis. It's just about whenever I get a hankering for some BBQ, Hometown has quickly become my go to spot. I like the vibe inside, there's always parking outside and the food is right.The last time I was here it was Fathers Day. And let me tell you what a shit show Fathers Day was in a neighborhood that is stroller central. There was a line wrapping around the room out the door! If you've ever been to Hometown, you know that room is big too, so that line was really freaking long!I waited on that line for about an hour. We grabbed drinks, chatted with other guests and waited very patiently. Right when we got to the counter, the man ahead of us ordered the very last of the lamb belly and I was visibly upset. But the counter guy cut me off a little sliver to taste. It was delicious and super nice of him.As always, the beef ribs are amazing. Two people can share one because they are HUGE! I also love the pulled pork. The brisket is good, but there is better brisket out there (looking at you Fette Sau!) As for sides, the cornbread is some of the best I've ever had. For $3 a piece, it is expensive, but SO GOOD still. And the Mac and cheese with queso topping is delicious. The counter guys are so cool, they'll layer the queso topping for you.Service and food are top notch here! Prices are steep, but I'm still coming back. My wallets not mad and neither is my tummy. :)",4.0

The meat crumbles if you over handle.  The bark is sooooo flavorful. amazing!!! They have been open for 2 years. The owner, Bully, is a funny and awesome guy. He tries to greet and say goodbye to his customers. He truly knows how to make BBQ. He even helps to clean the tables.  If you have to travel an additional hour, This is well worth the trip.

Took the free ikea ferry from manhattan and came across this wonderful location! My bf and I were gonna visit Brooklyn crab but since the delay was too long we're so happy we came here. Baby back ribs were amazing! The dark meat chicken was a bit raw but the ribs were great as well as the relaxed vibe Is relaxing after a pleasant day working on oyster reef restoration on Governor's island. Would be amazing when they are able to get a ferry which goes from gov isle to redhook. At 7 pm on a Friday we got food as well as a seat and no probs - cant wait to return in the wintertime and listen to the bluegrass concerts,4.0
"So I got a Pork Rib, Beef Rib, a slice of the moist version of the Brisket, and the Cornbread. The total of the bill was $55. Ouch.

I heeded the advice of others and didn't get any other sides.Sauces - The Original BBQ was really good, so was the hot version.

"Beef rib on a bone as big as my forearm (THE BESTEST)!! Spicy sriracha wings topped with a wonderful heavy hand of cilantro paired with a delicate creamy cheesey dip. Sticky ribs. Mac and cheese, with velvetta cheese no doubt. Tangy coleslaw. And health it up with a side of collard greens. Beers on tap. Live music. A projector. The American flag boldly painted on a red brick wall. And stacks of wood waiting to be tickled with fiery flames! Picnic tables encourage large groups and sharing. I think this just may be the best bbq in NYC. The only thing I could've done to top it off was wear a plaid shirt! The only con is that this place is pretty far from the subway.

"Absolutely delicious.  In my opinion, it's the best BBQ in NYC.  My wife and I had the beef rib, a half rack of spare ribs, a half rack of jerk ribs, a small side of pickles, a medium side of slaw and a large side of mac n cheese.  The total for the food only was a whopping $104 for two people. And while we did take home two spare and two jerk ribs, we polished off the rest.  Again, it was $104 for the food alone, before a single drink, so don't believe the $$ pricing on Yelp.That said, it's totally worth the schlep, especially on a nice summer day.  We'll be back for sure!",5.0

It will ruin all other BBQ for you if you know good food and have any sense of taste and decency whatsoever. It will make Dino BBQ taste like cafeteria food. Everything here is great. The guys behind the counter are super fast and kind. The beer list and drinks are fantastic.

"Never refusing a chance to eat BBQ, some close friends from NYC called me and wanted to meet for dinner.  Being big carnivores as well, we decided on Hometown BBQ.I've had Hometown BBQ bookmarked for a while and ogling the menu beforehand, I really wanted to sample the lamb belly (lamb being one of my favorite proteins).After reviewing the menu we decided on beef brisket, lamb belly, pork belly, and four sides (cornbread, baked beans, mac & cheese, and potato salad).Unfortunately, when we placed our order the server said the lamb belly was sold out.What?  Really?  It was only 7:50PM, the restaurant was only 40% full, and I would think they would have stock for the dinner crowd.  Needless to say I was very disappointed.In lieu of the lamb belly, we ordered the Jerk baby back ribs.- Beef brisket was okay.  The bark was average as it just didn't have that nice fresh caramelized outer layer.  Seasoning of the bark was very tasty though; I could taste a nice earthy tang of either strong coffee or espresso.  Overall I think the brisket may have been sitting a little long in the heating tray.- The pork belly was served pulled which was fine, but I prefer the Fette Sau style of sliced pork belly where you can see the nice gradient of bark, fat, and meat.- The Jerk baby back ribs were disappointing.  The jerk and smoke flavor were very muted jerk and just didn't assert itself.- Side dishes I found to be very tasty, as I really liked the potato salad with it's nice tangy vinegar seasoning and creamy mac & cheese (which I believe uses a nice subtle white cheddar).At the end of the meal we all agreed Fette Sau, while being a little more expensive, was clearly better tasting BBQ all around.I think Hometown BBQ would be a great food experience for those who have yet to try real BBQ (real slow wood smoked style meat), but having tried several BBQ restaurants both locally and in Texas; Hometown BBQ ranks just OK in my BBQ book.",3.0
"The day nearly started in disaster!  We made the trek from NJ to Redhook, only to find the restaurant closed due to an unforeseen power outage...  Ryan, the head man for the day, assured us that the problem was being worked on, but that without power they could not serve us due to potential health code violations.  However, sure enough, public works were on the scene taking care of the problem.  It was a beautiful day, so we opted to wait.  About 20 minutes later, I'm glad we did.We were the only ones to hang around initially, so we were the first up to be served upon the day's opening--being that it's cafeteria style, first come, first serve.  Seating was clearly not a problem.  So much delicious BBQ!!!  Meats:Beef Rib: Seasoned with only salt and course pepper, the top quality meat shines on it's own.  Far and away the highlight, this is beef ribs being done right.  The pepper crust makes for a spectacular bark.  The meat was moist and delicious, properly rendered, with just the right consistency and pull from the bone.  It cuts perfectly with a plastic knife.  While all of the BBQ was quite good, this beef rib is reason enough to come here.Spare Rib: Moist, meaty and delicious, these large ribs are on the money.  Once again, only a simple salt and pepper rub is used, allowing the meat to shine on its own.  I appreciate the simplicity, but I'll admit I used just a touch of the sweet BBQ sauce as I like the balance it gives to the natural sweet pork flavor.Brisket: Seasoned much like the beef rib, making for a nice salt/pepper crust.  The fat is rendered perfectly, leaving moist, delicious and tender meat with a phenomenal bark.  He sliced us a version incorporating parts from both the point and flat--best of both worlds,  A little bit of excess fat for sure, but hey, that's brisket!  Just a top notch version.Pork Belly: A very good version.  Not quite on the level of Fette Sau which may be the best version I've sampled, but definitely on the level.  This version was chopped, giving it more  similarities with pulled pork, than giving it its own identity.  I'm not sure it justifies the price difference vs. the pulled pork.Lamb Belly:  A very interesting option.  Liked it, but didn't love it.  However, for this order, it offered a perfect counter flavor to the other meats.  A little gamey, with that distinct lamb flavor, it definitely stood out.  If I only had this, I would have said the restaurant was pretty good, but it simply wasn't my favorite--and I truly enjoy lamb.  There wasn't anything wrong with it, but the flavor was a little too much for me personally.  Sides:Burnt End Baked Beans: Wow!  A unique version.  The way this was seasoned reminded me of a chilli base--not too spicy, but with that flavor profile, in a tomato base.  Nice texture to the beans, with a generous portion of burnt ends.Collared Greens: Decent version.  Not over the top with the vinegar which I appreciate, with just a touch of some tasty pulled pork in the mix.  Not sure why, but I'd have appreciated a touch more bitterness to them.Whiskey Sour Pickles:  Simply not my thing.  Way too sour for me, but this is a matter of personal preference.  I prefer a pickle with just a touch of vinegar that's just past being a cucumber.Corn Bread:  Nice consistency, with a sweet glaze on the outside without being too sweet on the inside.  I'd have preferred a bit of corn chunks on the inside for flavor and texture.  A decent sized portion for the $3.The staff was very nice.  Many went out of their way to ask us how we were enjoying our meal.The establishment was clean--I would hope so considering they had just opened for the day!Parking is a little tough.  There's a lot next door for Fairway, but I'm not sure how happy they'd be with restaurant patrons parking there.  I stuck with the street.Only 2 bathrooms.  A little tight given the size of the restaurant and the fact that they have 2 bar areas.  I imagine this gets a little tight on a Fri or Sat night.The price point was a little high, but not obnoxiously so.  We went with a beef rib, 1/3 rack of spare ribs, 1 lb brisket, 1/4 lb pork belly, 1/4 lb lamb belly 1 piece of corn bread and 3 small sides.  I'd expect that to be about $100-$120, but we wound up paying about $140.  This would not deter me from returning.",4.0
"this place is just alright. i'm a little disappointed because i had high hopes for this place after trying to many good bbq joints in brooklyn. we came here on a friday night and the place was slightly packed. it took about 15 minutes to find an open table.we ordered a pound of brisket, corn bread, mac n cheese and potato salad. the brisket was okay. it wasn't as juicy as the bbq places (ie.",3.0
"Beef rib on a bone as big as my forearm (THE BESTEST)!! Spicy sriracha wings topped with a wonderful heavy hand of cilantro paired with a delicate creamy cheesey dip. Sticky ribs. Mac and cheese, with velvetta cheese no doubt. Tangy coleslaw. And health it up with a side of collard greens. Beers on tap. Live music. A projector. The American flag boldly painted on a red brick wall. And stacks of wood waiting to be tickled with fiery flames! Picnic tables encourage large groups and sharing. I think this just may be the best bbq in NYC. The only thing I could've done to top it off was wear a plaid shirt! The only con is that this place is pretty far from the subway. We were so far away that even Uber couldn't get us. But I'm going to make the trek and get back here again someday. I promise!",5.0
"Absolutely delicious.  In my opinion, it's the best BBQ in NYC.  My wife and I had the beef rib, a half rack of spare ribs, a half rack of jerk ribs, a small side of pickles, a medium side of slaw and a large side of mac n cheese.  The total for the food only was a whopping $104 for two people. And while we did take home two spare and two jerk ribs, we polished off the rest.  Again, it was $104 for the food alone, before a single drink, so don't believe the $$ pricing on Yelp.That said, it's totally worth the schlep, especially on a nice summer day.  We'll be back for sure!",5.0

"I enjoy it. Straightforward to purchase, friendly staff, open space, decent cost as well as the most significant the food is greatest of what Brooklyn offers. The food reminds me and comparable to Oklahoma Joe at K.C. Best is I can have it all year round. I expect it do not get overly popular , if it does the line would be out the door and around the block. I 'd baby back ribs ,sausage as well as the most delightful melts in your mouth briskets that I've ever tasted. The hours are a bit odd and I wish they'd carry a bigger IPA beer collection but it is about the food.",4.0
"Wow, did I just read an elite Yelper say to skip this place and go to Dinosaur BBQ? That is the most backwards thing I've ever heard. Seriously. It is no wonder that Yelp's stock is in the proverbial toilet. The bar needs to be set higher.Hometown is nothing short of 5 stars. It is the best of the best in NYC. It will ruin all other BBQ for you if you know good food and have any sense of taste and decency whatsoever. It will make Dino BBQ taste like cafeteria food. Everything here is great. The guys behind the counter are super fast and kind. The beer list and drinks are fantastic. It's awesome to come here and slob out on meat and get a little buzz before you deal with the soul-draining experience of shopping at Ikea around the corner. Again.....THE BEST. PERIOD.",5.0

"Being partial to Texas BBQ, I use caution when going to a BBQ spot outside of Texas, especially Austin, TX. Believe me, I found Hometown BBQ to be quite awesome and it most certainly got my approval. I felt quite at home with the rustic décor and the full bar was an added plus. Before ordering, I had a couple of gin and tonic to clear the ol' palate. I ordered lamb belly, pork spare ribs, brisket (lean and moist), collard greens and Texas style queso mac and cheese. The meats were well seasoned and smoked to perfection. The collard greens with house cured bacon and the mac and cheese were absolutely awesome. By the time I got to the counter to order, the housemade jalapeño cheddar sausages were sold out. My fellow foodies had ordered a couple of items that I was able to sample. Smoked pit beans with brisket burnt ends, baby back pork ribs and pastrami bacon. The pit beans were magnificent!! The baby back ribs were very although I prefer the regular pork spare ribs. The pastrami bacon was different and didn't have me singing songs of praises.

Believe me, I found Hometown BBQ to be quite awesome and it most certainly got my approval. I felt quite at home with the rustic décor and the full bar was an added plus. Before ordering, I had a couple of gin and tonic to clear the ol' palate. I ordered lamb belly, pork spare ribs, brisket (lean and moist), collard greens and Texas style queso mac and cheese. The meats were well seasoned and smoked to perfection. The collard greens with house cured bacon and the mac and cheese were absolutely awesome. By the time I got to the counter to order, the housemade jalapeño cheddar sausages were sold out. My fellow foodies had ordered a couple of items that I was able to sample. Smoked pit beans with brisket burnt ends, baby back pork ribs and pastrami bacon. The pit beans were magnificent!! The baby back ribs were very although I prefer the regular pork spare ribs. The pastrami bacon was different and didn't have me singing songs of praises. I will definitely be back on my next visit to the Big Apple as I want to try the  housemade jalapeño cheddar sausages plus the jerk chicken which I missed seeing on the menu.",5.0
Honestly gave this place a second chance.Thank the lawdy lawd I did! After a good bike ride this hit the spot really good. The brisket was straight up buttah in my mouth. I still have dreams about it to this day. They deserved the second chance fo sho!,4.0
"I have eaten good BBQ around the US and I'll say this very confidently, This is not the best bbq spot in Brooklyn! The brisket was dry, the ribs were flavorless, the Mac and cheese was ok but who could mess that up, and finally the beans were a horrible mush.What's making me leave the 1 star review is the price. I never care for paying the price for quality food but this place is just ridiculous. The food is not worth the money! I could name better bbq for less in Brooklyn but I won't out of respect. I'm not returning to give it another chance. Really disappointed! The joint itself was pretty cool so 2 stars",2.0
"I had a party of 6 and I have to say, the food here was excellent. It has the feeling of a country house bbq. Service was great all around. The guy slicing up the meat gave us a sample of what we had to look forward tooThe meats and sides were delicious.  Brisket was sliced and smoke to perfection. Pulled pork was melt in your mouth. The Mac and cheese and baked beans were great as well.If you come here expecting table side service your not in the right place for it. It is basically like a cafeteria where everyone is on the lookout for a table.  There was a live band playing while we ate. Definitely will be looking forward to going back here",5.0

The place is big and has the BBQ meets NY thing down.Brisket -  it was really good although I like mine a bit more moist (burnt ends are better when they are fatty). Love the sticky sauce.

Wanted to update me review  .... yes the food is good ... so we decided  to head over there last night for valentine's day since this place does not take reservations  we thought we would wait ..... but since this place is set up like a cafeteria style seating ( in anther words you go up to counter order food and sit wherever  you want) ..... The problem with this is that we had a group of people who were hungry  and since there was no clear cut time frame of when we would eat we left .... what  we did notice is most of the restaurant was filled with people who have already ate and just sitting at the table hanging  out not allowing  others to sit and eat ..... to me this is a bad business becuase most couples we saw coming  in left .... and made there way to the next  nearest  resturant ( brooklyn crab)   as we did becuase thats the only other restaurant within walking distance  Funny enough even after we were done we walked back and figure we would get a couple of drinks and grab a couple of ribs to go but instaed  we found that they were closing almost an hour earlier then what they list as a closing time .... really on a sat night and valentine's day?????  Not cool !!! We drove from staten island to eat here wound up taking our money to anther  place .....    sorry won't  be coming back anytime soon unless they get rid of the sit anywhere u like situation   which is ridiculous when you have a group of people ..... I can only imagine how many people have walked out over time  the to go someplace else so for whoever owns this place you your losing a lot of money on your seating policy..... and not able to make some sort of reservation for people who are traveling to your location .........  dont care how good the food may be can not recommend  this place to anyone if you cant sit down and eat or have to wait a ridiculously long time ...,2.0

"Be prepared to empty your pockets for the beef rib, this is one of the priciest pieces of meat at $25 a pound (so about $31 per rib).  It's tasty, but a bit fatty (then again, it's a rib).  Also, don't come super hungry, as we waited on the line for quite a while (although the restaurant cleverly offers drinks for purchase while you wait).  Once we sat down to eat, many enjoyed meatgasms, squirting that ""Hometown Sticky"" in bursts across the table.  There is live music, it seems, as a band was setting up that Saturday evening, but we left before any tunes were heard.  Also, the line extended further and further into the place as the night went on, and those on line watched like hawks for emptying tables, swooping in to claim seats they would likely occupy in forty minutes.  A good time was had by our drunken birthday party in this laid back, Americana-filled space.  TL; DR:  Come somewhat hungry, drink on line, have others save your seats.",3.0

Did like the lamb though , you cant get that everywhere.  Big place i didnt see any waiters.  Can imagine waiting a long time for food later in the evening.  We showed up at 5 it was empty.  Dont think i'll be back though.  Just a little too hipster for me.",3.0
i can not even begin to explain the great tasting pulled pork i just had. i will be back before the week is over just to eat it again. OMG OMG. first off its in Red Hook which is such a cute little area. the place is open huge and spacious great lighting i can't ask for more. I was lost when i first got in but i quickly saw it was very simple alcohol to the right.. food to the left. I was acknowledged as soon as i went up to order. the man preparing my sandwich and the lady taking my money were both very friendly and nice. after ordering i sat down waited about 5 minutes and then the best thing in my life happened i ate by far the best pulled pork sandwich i have had in my life I'm 33 yrs old and a huge pork lover. I have been to other bbq places in nyc and so far this is the best. I'm so happy and excited to have found this place... and it opens at 12 so i can totally go there on my days off with friends and just enjoy a great meal.. the area is so cute too so its great for a date and being alone Again i can't stop thinking about that sandwich and what it did to me. I will be back for another sandwich and ill be trying something amazing.,5.0
"I'm in LOVE with the 'Que!! Hometown BBQ came on my foodie grid map since the Big Apple BBQ, Summer of 2014 and I solely ventured out today in the rain to sample their brontosaurus beef rib. But once I saw the menu, how could you go here and not order everything? Well, as a party of ONE--don't judge me--I practically did. I ordered the beef rib, half a rack of the jerk baby back ribs and the pastrami bacon (the switched from the pork belly which is seasonal) with a side of their Texas-style Queso mac and cheese. The beef rib was a little fatty yet perfectly seasoned. If you don't like black pepper, avoid this but it's oh so worth every pull of the bone. The jerk ribs were tender and the pastrami bacon was different good too.  I LOVED everything I sampled and would reorder agin. I couldn't eat it all so needless to say I have a week's (or two days) worth of food to finish polishing off.",5.0
"The BBQ here is legit!! My go-to options are brisket (best in NY) and the dry-rub spare ribs. Both are so tender and full of flavor. The sauces are delicious but I barely use them cause the meat is so good on its own. Side options are okay. Coleslaw is good, mac and cheese is okay (liquid queso), and corn bread is hit or miss.Service is cafeteria style. Lines for food can get pretty long but the bar is always quick. Tons of tables, great for big groups.There are bunch of big screen TVs that are good for sports and the back room has a stage so check their calendar for live bands.",4.0
"Ok full disclosure, I have met the owner of this place and I have tremendous respect for him and what he is doing for NYC BBQ.We were in NYC to cook at the Big Apple Block Party and I have always wanted to try this place out. We made the trek to Red Hook and lets just say we blew up the menu.We ate Brisket, Beef Ribs, Jamaican Ribs, Korean Ribs, Tacos, Mac and Cheese, Potato salad, and pretty much anything they sent our way.First the brisket, it was very good Texas style brisket and despite being later in the day still moist with mostly salt and pepper being the flavour with the beef. Beef Ribs, oh I how I adore thee. I have been a late bloomer to the beef rib thing most likely because as a child I had some and really did not like them. Turns out I do like them A LOT! THese have some voodoo magic that makes them like the best brisket and the best prime rib got together for a magical night and produced the flavours of the gods. Smokey, Salty, peppery, and above all BEEFY. Tender and moist thee are must have for your visit. If you don't like beef ribs order some and then send them to me, I'll eat your share.The Jamaican ribs had good jerk flavour, I found they were my least favourite but that does not mean I did not like them because I did. They had good spice and were tender and moist.Next up Asian Spare Ribs, OK these I like very much. So much I commented to the owner that I would murder someone I actually liked to get them, The flavours were perfectly balanced. You had the sweet, sour, spices and pork. And they all sang together in a chorus of angelic meatiness that I'm pretty sure someone made a deal with the devil to develop.The tacos were straight ahead pork and brisket tacos but everything was fresh and bright and were the perfect size.THe Mac and cheese is unique because it is noodles and queso which is very creamy and has some kick not hot just kick.The potato salad is like potato salad and mashed potatoes had a crash up as my 5 year old would say. It has a nice smooth texture but with the salad flavours.To sum up, I know Brooklyn is the new darling of NYC food and this place is no different but you pluck this out of NYC and put it in the south or Texas and it would be just as successful.go here, now, really go!",5.0
"After several more visits, Hometown hits the mark. Brisket is great; a bit lean. Lamb belly was underwhelming, extremely fatty (obviously) but not my cup of tea. Sides are delicious. Atmosphere is homey. Definitely a go-to spot in the Hook. One of the best 'Q joints in town.",4.0
"Yesterday was probably my fifth time or so to hometown. Every time its the same. Great flavorful food. Great ambiance and vibe. Bar is great, I like that beers are served in jars now, it's the little things that always matter! The brisket sandwich now has pickles and onions in it which in my opinion make it 10x better. The mac and cheese delicious as always. They even had the Seahawks/Panthers game which even though at the time seemed like a blowout added to the vibe of the bar/dining area. The owner (i presume he is the owner) even came up to a buddy and me asking if we were OK or needing anything else, I was battling a food coma so i was speechless to respond.

"The brisket was dry and chewy. It doesn't melt in your mouth like mighty Quinn's. Also had the sriracha wings, Korean sticky ribs, regular ribs, Mac and cheese and cornbread. The space is huge and felt very Texas like. I never been but I watch enough food network to assume that it's like one of those spots that guy (from diners, drive ins and dives) explores. Expensive for mediocre food. If you want briskets and ribs that melts in your mouth and falls off the bone, I suggest mighty Quinn's.",3.0
"Tends to be pricey and you dont get a lot for your money, but it is filling and true smoked.  We had a sampler of lamb belly, brisket, chicken, pulled pork and corn bread as well as the mac and cheese.  90$.  I can think of other local joints including my back yard where i can get better. Did like the lamb though , you cant get that everywhere.  Big place i didnt see any waiters.  Can imagine waiting a long time for food later in the evening.  We showed up at 5 it was empty.  Dont think i'll be back though.  Just a little too hipster for me.",3.0
i can not even begin to explain the great tasting pulled pork i just had. i will be back before the week is over just to eat it again. OMG OMG. first off its in Red Hook which is such a cute little area. the place is open huge and spacious great lighting i can't ask for more. I was lost when i first got in but i quickly saw it was very simple alcohol to the right.. food to the left. I was acknowledged as soon as i went up to order. the man preparing my sandwich and the lady taking my money were both very friendly and nice. after ordering i sat down waited about 5 minutes and then the best thing in my life happened i ate by far the best pulled pork sandwich i have had in my life I'm 33 yrs old and a huge pork lover. I have been to other bbq places in nyc and so far this is the best. I'm so happy and excited to have found this place... and it opens at 12 so i can totally go there on my days off with friends and just enjoy a great meal.. the area is so cute too so its great for a date and being alone Again i can't stop thinking about that sandwich and what it did to me. I will be back for another sandwich and ill be trying something amazing.,5.0
"I'm in LOVE with the 'Que!! Hometown BBQ came on my foodie grid map since the Big Apple BBQ, Summer of 2014 and I solely ventured out today in the rain to sample their brontosaurus beef rib. But once I saw the menu, how could you go here and not order everything? Well, as a party of ONE--don't judge me--I practically did. I ordered the beef rib, half a rack of the jerk baby back ribs and the pastrami bacon (the switched from the pork belly which is seasonal) with a side of their Texas-style Queso mac and cheese. The beef rib was a little fatty yet perfectly seasoned. If you don't like black pepper, avoid this but it's oh so worth every pull of the bone. The jerk ribs were tender and the pastrami bacon was different good too.  I LOVED everything I sampled and would reorder agin. I couldn't eat it all so needless to say I have a week's (or two days) worth of food to finish polishing off.",5.0
"The BBQ here is legit!! My go-to options are brisket (best in NY) and the dry-rub spare ribs. Both are so tender and full of flavor. The sauces are delicious but I barely use them cause the meat is so good on its own. Side options are okay. Coleslaw is good, mac and cheese is okay (liquid queso), and corn bread is hit or miss.Service is cafeteria style. Lines for food can get pretty long but the bar is always quick. Tons of tables, great for big groups.There are bunch of big screen TVs that are good for sports and the back room has a stage so check their calendar for live bands.",4.0
"Ok full disclosure, I have met the owner of this place and I have tremendous respect for him and what he is doing for NYC BBQ.We were in NYC to cook at the Big Apple Block Party and I have always wanted to try this place out. We made the trek to Red Hook and lets just say we blew up the menu.We ate Brisket, Beef Ribs, Jamaican Ribs, Korean Ribs, Tacos, Mac and Cheese, Potato salad, and pretty much anything they sent our way.First the brisket, it was very good Texas style brisket and despite being later in the day still moist with mostly salt and pepper being the flavour with the beef. Beef Ribs, oh I how I adore thee. I have been a late bloomer to the beef rib thing most likely because as a child I had some and really did not like them. Turns out I do like them A LOT! THese have some voodoo magic that makes them like the best brisket and the best prime rib got together for a magical night and produced the flavours of the gods. Smokey, Salty, peppery, and above all BEEFY. Tender and moist thee are must have for your visit. If you don't like beef ribs order some and then send them to me, I'll eat your share.The Jamaican ribs had good jerk flavour, I found they were my least favourite but that does not mean I did not like them because I did. They had good spice and were tender and moist.Next up Asian Spare Ribs, OK these I like very much. So much I commented to the owner that I would murder someone I actually liked to get them, The flavours were perfectly balanced. You had the sweet, sour, spices and pork.

I could've just picked one and been fine, but of course we ate it all. The collard greens are really good, and I liked the potato salad, but many people said it had too much dill.

"I agree with a fellow reviewer in that the worst part of coming to Hometown BBQ is waiting in what can be quite a lengthy line. That and the large picnic tables where you have to try your luck at finding a seat make the experience, to me, only 4 stars instead of 5.Away from those two things, this place serves phenomenal food. The casual atmosphere, the extensive beer options at the bar (and likely bourbon, too, but I'm a BBQ and beer kind of person) and a user friendly self serve water/plate/silverware station make it an easy choice when in the mood for BBQ. When I ate here recently, for a belated birthday dinner, I was happily impressed with the variety of meats on offer as well as some interesting combinations (pork belly tacos!).We were a party of 4 and waited for about 25 minutes on a late Saturday afternoon/early evening in line to order our food. We managed to secure the end of one long picnic table just before ordering (a miracle) and had: beef brisket, beef rib (which looks like something out of the Flinstones it is so huge), pork belly, lamb belly and pork belly tacos. We also shared some collard greens and cornbread.The brisket was the best I have had city wide, I think. The pork belly was tremendous. The lamb belly we were served was more skin than meat therefore I don't feel like I can honestly comment on it. The pork tacos were really a treat, 3 served in an order with jalapenos on the side. The home run was the beef rib. I tend to be a pork rib girl, but my friend who had eaten here before said we had to do the beef rib because it was so amazing. It is - she didn't steer us wrong. It was devoured. We even had one of the group try to pick it up to gnaw off of which is quite a feat given its giant nature. The meat practically fell off the bone and was succulent beyond what I could imagine. The collards were good and the cornbread a solid 8 out of 10. All in all, if you can handle the wait for a seat and for the food (which is served by the lb) and manage to drag yourself to Red Hook (IKEA!), I would recommend this joint for some tasty, finger-liking BBQ.",4.0

Didn't have luck. They we were, with our trays trying to find seating for 4 with other groups hovering over tables. While thinking we would have to take it to go, a gentlemen in the back table got up with his group and offered up his seats. Come to find out he was the owner/pitmaster (his arm was in a sling).

The one meat that was good was the turkey as it was smoked and not covered with heat. The mac and cheese was cheesy and not too bad.

The first time I went here I had the pork tacos and they were excellent the second time it almost tasted like the pork was marinated in mayo. The brisket was ok and the cornbread is Delish! But I've had way better!,3.0
"Place is ok, but we've had better.  Flavors seemed just a touch subdued.  The sriracha wings does not taste like sriracha, basically just their hot and sweet sauce.  The jalapeño cheddar sausage did not taste like jalapeño or cheddar.  The jerk ribs did not taste of jerk sauce, and the beans with burnt ends at Mighty Quinn's are better.  We also tried the Korean sticky wings, which did not taste like any Korean flavor we are aware of.  Overall, the food was not bad, but none of them tasted like how they were described or named.  I found myself wishing the flavors were a little stronger.",3.0

Came Saturday night but the 90 minute wait was too much so had a do-over Monday and we were first on line. Brisket was tops but the ribs and pulled pork were also very good. The corn bread was fantastic. Mac and cheese solid. Only the slaw was eh. Plus a few Michter's American whiskeys. Place is great. The owner/pitmaster was working the register.

4 stars for the brisket alone. Yes beef is the way here. The brisket was thick slices and a perfect moist/firm texture. A pretty straightforward black pepper rub was flavorful but not overpowering. Just great. I didn't have room for the beef rib too unfortunately. They are popular. It is also a casual red hook hipster honkytonk vibe with families and old folks from the neighbors alongside the hip bbq dudes. Feels like Chicago hip or Seattle hip rather than NYC hip. Service was fine from intelligent but bored servers. I also tried the pork spareribs which were dry. Lightly smoke and thickly coated in a black pepper rub.And also the lamb belly was good but so rich I would share it.Coal slaw was watery and bland. The pickles were also bland. The sauces are called sticky and hot & sticky. Good names. Not my cup of tea but I respect them. Can't give five stars to a place with lame sides and dry ribs but run over just for the brisket and the vibe. I came by at 7ish on a Wed and it wasn't too busy.,4.0

"I ordered the brisket, pulled pork, and lamb belly. All were excellent. lamb and pork were a bit too fatty if that is possible, but excellent flavor and doneness - all extremely tender but still moist (probably added by the extra fat mentioned.) The lamb is a stand out but I'm not sure if that is simply because of how unique it is. Pulled pork has a sweet fruit flavor I couldn't place. Brisket was standard but delicious. All were at risk of being overshadowed by the mashed potato salad: it is perfectly seasoned. I don't know why I never thought of using mashed potatoes for potato salad.  The live band was not playing yet but I can imagine that would have made my experience even better.

All in all, I'd hoped to have some real TX brisket, but I would hit up Hill Country or Blue Smoke instead, especially given the line (we magically got there when it wasn't too long, it grew twice the size as we were in it). Plus, the fella remarked how weird it was they didn't give any bread, which is really true Texas-style. I guess they want to make you order the sandwich instead. It just seems wrong.",3.0
"Been here before and loved it. Arrived tonight w/friends visiting nyc at 7:20pm by taxi from Manhattan. Got in line, when we got to the front at 8:10pm we were told that they were completely out of meat...major bummer. I understand as they make everything for the day, but we were in line for almost one hour. And we arrived at 7:20... I still love hometown, but they should have come out sooner to let people in line know they were out of food. Heading out in the cold now to see where else is still serving",1.0
I have no pics of the half chicken I got because culinary myopia set in and all that existed in the moment was that half chicken and me. So juicy and tasty even without their sauce.. The red beans.. Good lord..one of the wonders of the world. Just give them a try and see for your self.,5.0
"I trekked all the way from Westchester, NY to Red Hook, Brooklyn for this place since Eater had announced it The Best BBQ in town. It took about 15 minutes for a friend and I to find parking on an early Saturday afternoon and another half an hour wait in line, which left us ample time deciding what to get (We literally wanted to try everything). We decided to order half a pound each of brisket, baby back jerk ribs, lamb belly and a side of corn bread and macaroni and cheese. Half a pound of three types of meat and two sides was actually enough for two people and anymore would've ended up with leftovers. The meat is served Texan-style on a tissue paper. The lamb belly and brisket were both weighed from the butcher and we waited at our table for the baby back ribs. The brisket worth the hype. Hands down best brisket in all of NYC. That smokey center seasoned with simply salt and pepper and that sweet black ring around the tender and elastic texture of the inside was everything. The lamb belly was also seasoned the right amount despite others saying it might need a little more salt. The lamb taste was rich, but not too gamey. The baby back ribs had a fall-off-the-bone texture inside and suberb smokey flavor. The mac and cheese had bit of a kick to it but cheese sauce was overpowering. The corn bread I thought was average, but I guess a palate cleanser from all that meat. The sweet sauce complimented the brisket the most. The decor was Texan with its rustic and spacious feel, but the atmosphere was very Brooklyn and hipster. There's definitely a charm to this place in addition to amazing and mouthwatering BBQ meat.",5.0
"Showed up at 7:45 and there was no food left (save for sides and brisket).  Why advertise open till 12:00 when you may not have food?  I get that it's super cool to have a long wait for your awesome food, but f' off.",1.0

There is no hostess, its sort of a first come first serve for the tables, if its packed you can just sit by the bar and keep your eye out for when people leave.

Brisket, pulled pork, sausage and jerk chicken. Went with the brisket, beans, mac & collards.The brisket sandwich was $11, sides were $4. The brisket served on a Caputo onion roll with Brooklyn brine pickles had the right combo of fat and lean plus the pickles and onions on that bread was a winning combo. The standout sides were the perfectly cooked smokey sides and the beans.

"This is my favorite restaurant.I do not throw those words around lightly. Also, notice I didn't say it like ""this is my NEW favorite restaurant"" or ""this is my favorite BBQ restaurant"". No, there is no qualifier to this place, and I've never said that folks. I first had them at a rooftop BBQ where they catered. And they were soooo delicious. Not a month after that event, a group of four of us took the trek out to Red Hook. Here's the thing. It's not the easiest place to get to. But knowing what awaited us, we knew it'd be worth it.Thursday night at 7pm is sparse (I hear it gets pretty packed on the weekend). And the decor is so cool. Almost exactly how I thought it would be (sans any sort of saw dust), but there were two bars, two dining areas, very country barn-esque. Our bar tender was super cool. I ordered the town tea (peach tea vodka), and because I'm not an alcohol-loving gal, it was absolutely perfect.And the way the ordering of the food goes...it's just cool guys. Laid back, watch them cut and weigh the meat, have it piled onto a giant silver tray. It's just great experience. Pulled pork was probably my favorite, the sides (are the stars of any BBQ for me)...the beans, the cornbread, the mac & cheese, the slaw...just heavenly. I love the spice of the beans, the honey glazed top of the corn bread, the cheeziness of the mac, the how perfect it goes with everything-ness of the slaw. It's just an awesome place for a great meal.And you don't feel like a bloated fat pig after. What BBQ that's delicious doesn't make you feel guilty about all that you ate.And then the live music! It was just such a perfect compliment to the mood of the entire experience that is Hometown BBQ (you could picture floating down a swampy river on a lazy summer afternoon).AND the people! I mentioned the awesome bartender, the cool guys at the food station, and the sweet boss man (reminds of a teamster, but somehow even cuddlier). I cannot wait for them to actually sell their delicious sauces!If they were closer/easier to get to, I would be there at least once a week. But for now, it's like that guy (or girl) who is so cool, but doesn't even try.",5.0
"On business trips across the U.S. I always made it a point to try local BBQ joints. With 75 or so destinations under my belt I was challenged to find a go-to place after moving to Brooklyn. I've been through the ringer of Fette Sau, Mighty Quinn's, Dinosaur, Hill Country and the like. None of these (or anywhere else across the country) compared to my experience at Hometown...Brisket:By far the best I've ever had. Fatty, juicy, mouth watering deliciousness with the perfect smoke flavor and well seasoned crust. IMHO the only way to judge a BBQ joint is the quality of their brisket. Nailed it 10/10.Beef Rib: This was a massive portion of outstandingly executed meat. Definitely on par with the brisket, I was completely amazed at its texture and overall flavor profile. 9.5/10Pork Ribs: The pork ribs were the less desirable of the bunch. Very tender but overpowered by a heavy rub, I believe it's the same rub that was used on the brisket. Pork being a lighter meat is a bit more sensitive and would be better off being more subtle in flavor/texture. 7/10Sides: I'm usually not big on sides, why ""waste calories"" when you have a delicious carnivorous feast in front of you. But I took the plunge and tried the Mac n Cheese, Potato Salad & Cole Slaw. Fresh, full of flavor and a nice addition to our meal. 8.5/10 Desserts: Too stuffed to try but they all sounded and looked amazing as they passed by.Atmosphere: Authentic, Fun & Lively. 10/10Staff: Knowledgeable, Friendly & Patient. 10/10Owner: I had the opportunity and pleasure to meet Billy. What a nice guy, we talked shop for a few and his passion for BBQ resonated as the conversation progressed. I would normally give this a solid 4 stars (ribs) but Billy pushed it way over the top. He's a restauranteur to look out for and a force to be reckoned with in the growing NYC BBQ scene. 100/100If you haven't already, just go here and be absolutely blown away. Hope you enjoy, I sure did and will be back soon.",5.0

The brisket served on a Caputo onion roll with Brooklyn brine pickles had the right combo of fat and lean plus the pickles and onions on that bread was a winning combo. The standout sides were the perfectly cooked smokey sides and the beans. Full of meat and slow cooked for 14 hours, the owner said- the sauce they are sitting in is so rich and intense it is almost MOLE- like...unlike any beans I have ever tasted. All American great barbecue with a BK twist!",5.0
"I'm from Kansas City and damn I definitely approve of this place. Top notch food, nice atmosphere, friendly service. Owner is a nice guy and greeted us when we walked in!",5.0
"This is my favorite restaurant.I do not throw those words around lightly. Also, notice I didn't say it like ""this is my NEW favorite restaurant"" or ""this is my favorite BBQ restaurant"". No, there is no qualifier to this place, and I've never said that folks. I first had them at a rooftop BBQ where they catered. And they were soooo delicious. Not a month after that event, a group of four of us took the trek out to Red Hook. Here's the thing. It's not the easiest place to get to. But knowing what awaited us, we knew it'd be worth it.Thursday night at 7pm is sparse (I hear it gets pretty packed on the weekend). And the decor is so cool. Almost exactly how I thought it would be (sans any sort of saw dust), but there were two bars, two dining areas, very country barn-esque. Our bar tender was super cool. I ordered the town tea (peach tea vodka), and because I'm not an alcohol-loving gal, it was absolutely perfect.And the way the ordering of the food goes...it's just cool guys. Laid back, watch them cut and weigh the meat, have it piled onto a giant silver tray. It's just great experience. Pulled pork was probably my favorite, the sides (are the stars of any BBQ for me)...the beans, the cornbread, the mac & cheese, the slaw...just heavenly. I love the spice of the beans, the honey glazed top of the corn bread, the cheeziness of the mac, the how perfect it goes with everything-ness of the slaw. It's just an awesome place for a great meal.And you don't feel like a bloated fat pig after. What BBQ that's delicious doesn't make you feel guilty about all that you ate.And then the live music! It was just such a perfect compliment to the mood of the entire experience that is Hometown BBQ (you could picture floating down a swampy river on a lazy summer afternoon).AND the people! I mentioned the awesome bartender, the cool guys at the food station, and the sweet boss man (reminds of a teamster, but somehow even cuddlier). I cannot wait for them to actually sell their delicious sauces!If they were closer/easier to get to, I would be there at least once a week. But for now, it's like that guy (or girl) who is so cool, but doesn't even try.",5.0
"On business trips across the U.S. I always made it a point to try local BBQ joints. With 75 or so destinations under my belt I was challenged to find a go-to place after moving to Brooklyn. I've been through the ringer of Fette Sau, Mighty Quinn's, Dinosaur, Hill Country and the like. None of these (or anywhere else across the country) compared to my experience at Hometown...Brisket:By far the best I've ever had. Fatty, juicy, mouth watering deliciousness with the perfect smoke flavor and well seasoned crust. IMHO the only way to judge a BBQ joint is the quality of their brisket. Nailed it 10/10.Beef Rib: This was a massive portion of outstandingly executed meat. Definitely on par with the brisket, I was completely amazed at its texture and overall flavor profile. 9.5/10Pork Ribs: The pork ribs were the less desirable of the bunch. Very tender but overpowered by a heavy rub, I believe it's the same rub that was used on the brisket. Pork being a lighter meat is a bit more sensitive and would be better off being more subtle in flavor/texture. 7/10Sides: I'm usually not big on sides, why ""waste calories"" when you have a delicious carnivorous feast in front of you. But I took the plunge and tried the Mac n Cheese, Potato Salad & Cole Slaw. Fresh, full of flavor and a nice addition to our meal. 8.5/10 Desserts: Too stuffed to try but they all sounded and looked amazing as they passed by.Atmosphere: Authentic, Fun & Lively. 10/10Staff: Knowledgeable, Friendly & Patient. 10/10Owner: I had the opportunity and pleasure to meet Billy. What a nice guy, we talked shop for a few and his passion for BBQ resonated as the conversation progressed. I would normally give this a solid 4 stars (ribs) but Billy pushed it way over the top. He's a restauranteur to look out for and a force to be reckoned with in the growing NYC BBQ scene. 100/100If you haven't already, just go here and be absolutely blown away. Hope you enjoy, I sure did and will be back soon.",5.0
"I love this restaurant! I'm not a meat eater but I love the meat at Hometown bbq. The pulled pork is amazing, so much better than Mighty Quinns'! The corn bread is delicious too. The  jerk baby backs are good, but I prefer the  spare ribs.",5.0
Incredible- had the baby back ribs and the brisket. Truly outstanding!!,5.0
"This place is delicious!!!!!! Best brisket sandwich ever!!!!! You stand in line, order your food, get it on a tray and sit down and eat it on a a park like table. The bartender is really nice, I wish I caught her name. But overall I really love this place. Ribs are good too, wings are delicious!",5.0
"This place has some amazing brisket, been to countless bbq places and this has to be my favorite brisket place. So nice juicy tender.  Location is not the easiest to get to, but definitely worth the trip. Lines can get ridiculously long but moves at a good pace.They also tend to run out of selections of food. Cannot blame them since they have some good tasting bbq here.",5.0
"Best brisket in NYC! Next time I would ask thm to slice it thinner because thats just how I like it, but the flavor was smoky and delicious, the BBQ sauce was great, and the BEEF Rib was fall off the bone tender and delicious! This is spot is a gem it has an old honky tonk texas feel inside great bar and selection of alcohol.",4.0
"Brooklyn meets the Dirty South a.k.a. Texas (because this place is fine competition for those Southern finger-lickin' barbecue joints). The meat here is tender. They have a diverse menu (diverse enough for a barbecue joint), and the sides are fine and taste like perfection. Lamb belly: tender and delicious- they offer you a good amountBrisket: tenderRibs: They almost fall off the bone.I highly recommend trying the corn bread. I honestly have had better corn bread, but the corn bread here isn't that bad. The only reason I say that is that it could be softer. Macaroni and cheese-- HMM... tasted like all the other ones I have tried.Overall, this place is an amazing barbecue joint and can take you back to the dirty South when you are looking to escape the hustle and bustle of Brooklyn. I honestly would come back here again-- for a drink or two or to watch a game on their screens. They also play country music here, and dang, one of the waitresses here can hold her own vocal-wise.",5.0

"It's really a great place. I missed it because I was so focused on Fairway. Went there last Sunday afternoon. I got the Beef Rib and my partner, Louis, got the brisket. Brisket is usually the first to be sold out, but not here! We were relieved. The baked beans with burnt trimmings is fantastic! The Mac & cheese is just ordinary. Should have gone with the collard greens. The price for their sides are steep. $4 for a small. They have a bar on another wall, but I really wish they had more non-alcoholic choices - only root beer and something that resembles O'Douls. The place smelled so great walking in.

"My husband & I just finished eating here. After reading all the good reviews, and BBQ being one of my favorite food, we had to drive down to Red Hook, and check it out. When we first walked in, we were both a little confused on the ordering system, one of the owners came right over, and explained everything to us, he was extremely nice, giving us a brief disruption, showing us the place, and making small talk. I am all about customer service! And this place has it! You can tell right off the bat that they care about their restaurant, and the customers, this you don't see so often anymore. Especially in such a large establishment. Ok on to the food....the ordering system is basically standing on line, ordering your meat first (we had the pulled pork, brisket & wings) they cut the meat right in front of you, give you the amount appropriate for you, and weight it. Then you order the sides (we got macaroni & cheese, potato salad, and baked beans) after that you pay, get your utensils, and sit down. Basically cafeteria style, reminded me of high school. The drinks even soda you have to order from the bar. I've been to other places with this style of ordering, it doesn't bother me, except the fact I had to go to the bar for soda, and keep getting up for drinks. It would have been nice if someone would at least take drink orders. But other then that which isn't much, doesn't make me dislike the place. The pulled pork was delicious, so was the brisket, the macaroni & cheese had a good kick to it, I don't know what was in it, but it was a little spicy. Would I order it again? Hell yes! So was the potato salad! While eating another owner came over and asked how the food went, great guy! Funny personality, explained that the wood on one of the walls came from a hundred year old barn that was destroyed after hurricane sandy, thought it was nice to speak to us, and many of the other people eating. I've ate at a lot of BBQ places in Brooklyn, and this one is one of the BEST! It has a unique taste, but a very delicious one! Can't wait for a nice warm night to go on a Friday night when they have a live band, enjoy some BBQ food and beers. Thanks for the GREAT hospitality! Keep it up! Thanks for a great dinner!

"Wow.  This might be my new favorite BBQ place in New York City Limits, surpassing the storied Fete Sau.  Hometown came highly recommended from my sister who doesn't eat four-legged animals so I was skeptical to say the least.  Thankfully, she was right and I had an epic meal with leftovers for the next night.This place is another reason to come to Redhook, in the bowels of Brooklyn.  I would definitely live here if it weren't so freakin far from a subway.  I guess that's what makes it even cooler.  Pretty standard counter service BBQ layout here.  Very open floor not too crowded with tables.  Nice long bar  with a couple ladies tending your needs.  You can smell the faint aroma of smoked meats as you walk down the street but as soon as you step inside, your nostrils are engulfed with olfactory hues that will make you drool.   Tuck that lip in, boy, you got some work to do.  Not crowded on a Thursday night, we have a drink at the bar and discuss our game plan before heading to the counter.  We thought we had it figured out but chaos ensued when we find out that they are all out of beef rib, lamb belly & pork belly.  From yelp reviews, the beef rib and lamb belly are supposed to be the two best things here and pork belly is pretty much my most favorite thing in the world so needless to say, I am a little disappointed.  The pitmaster talks me off the ledge by handing me a bit of fatty brisket and I put my game face back on.  Plenty of other items to indulge on tonight.  We opt for every other meat on the menu: brisket, pulled pork, sausage, spare ribs, baby back ribs & chicken.  Chicken is for the birds (British word for women) so I didn't care to waste any precious stomach space with that.  I tend to find that BBQ restaurants do one thing really well and everything else just ok (Dinosaur: Wings, Hill Country: Brisket, Daisy Mays: Ribs, Mighty Quinn's: Burnt Ends).  That wasn't the case here.  Everything we ate was excellent.  The standouts definitely being the brisket and spare ribs.  I will probably skip the baby backs next time and just get another spare rib or two instead.  Besides the brisket rivaling Hill Country, these spare ribs were some of the best I've ever had and could take the cake over Daisy May's.  A heavy rub gives them a nice bite and just a gentle clench of the teeth will leave you with a mouth full of heaven.  As for the sides, they do those well too.  I think this place is now the hometown (pun intended) of my favorite baked beans and cornbread.  Off the hizzy for shizzy.  I didn't try the mac n' cheese but I hear it's nothing special.  Who cares, come here for the meat and you won't be disappointed.",5.0

"Amber and I were going to New York City for our fifth wedding anniversary and also to see my sister who lives there. The only time I have been to NYC was when I was eight or so with my family. My wife and I went on a ""diet"" before the trip so I was limited to how much barbecue I can eat. When we travel, I put a lot of focus on food so we knew our waistline was going to increase. Traveling out of town with me is not easy. I try to hit up as many BBQ joints as I can. I know my wife gets annoyed with how much barbecue we eat so we decided on one stop on this trip. Hometown Bar-B-Que located in the Brooklyn was my choice.Lately, it seems like New York City is a hotbed for barbecue. You would think the two would not go together. A Yankee smoking meat? Where would the smokers go? Texas Monthly BBQ editor Daniel Vaughn caused a stir when he said ""The brisket I've had in NYC lately is better than a lot of places Texas"" in this article. I find some truth in that statement. Some of the places I have been to in Texas do not put their heart and passion into the 'cue and it shows. Hometown Bar-B-Que is owned by Billy Durney. Check out an interview of him here. Hometown just celebrated its one year anniversary. It would have been opened for business earlier, but Hurricane Sandy had other ideas.The first thing you will notice on the menu is the price of the meats. This is New York so it is definitely not cheap. Brisket is 28 bucks per pound. Franklin is charging $20 per pound right now which is the most I have paid. We ordered a quarter pound of moist brisket and pork belly, a link of jalapeño-cheddar sausage, and a half rack of jerk baby back pork ribs. I wanted a beef rib too, but I did not want to break the bank. We also got a side of Texas-style queso macaroni and cheese. The brisket was outstanding. It was very comparable with the stuff you would find at good places in Texas. There was a nice smoke flavor, and the meat was tender. The influence of Wayne Mueller of Louie Mueller showed with the peppery bark. I wish I had ordered more. When I bit into the brisket, I regretted not getting the beef rib. I knew it would have been great.The flavor of the pork belly was superb. The sweet rub played well with the smoke. I have seen pork belly sliced but not pulled before. Every bite was rich and savory. I was disappointed in the house-made jalapeño-cheddar sausage. The grit and pop were on point, but I did not like anything else about it. There was something off about the flavor profile. I expected more heat and to taste more cheese. I gave up after a few bites. Hometown also serves a beef link but was not available today. I normally go with spareribs but went with the baby back ribs instead. It was recommended to me so I could not pass it up. The half rack of the jerk baby back ribs was delicious. The unique Caribbean inspired jerk rub packed a ton of flavor. The spices were not overwhelming and made a great duo with the sweet undertones. The meat was juicy and smoky. We ate every single one. The macaroni and cheese was very cheesy but good. It was essentially macaroni and cheese with queso poured over it.It was worth the hour long subway and bus ride. Daniel Vaughn might be on to something. If Hometown Bar-B-Que was located in Texas, it would absolutely do well. Brisket is king here in Texas, and Billy can smoke a mean one. The highlights of the noteworthy menu included Sriracha hot wings, pork belly tacos, and lamb belly banh mi. I want it all. Maybe next time when I go back. I am thinking of hitting up Delaney Barbecue too. Maybe I should start a crowdfunding so I can do a NYC BBQ tour?",5.0

"$$$ The BBQ is very very good. The decor, bar, space is fantastic and like a bbq dream. The only turnoff is that it's a bit overpriced. I get that it's Brooklyn, even Red Hook, but It loses its love when the portions for 2 ppl to go comes to $60. I'm used to NY prices, I get what they are doing here, I've eaten at Blue Smoke, Dino, Hill, etc. Two meats (1/2 lb) and three sides. Brisket, lamb belly, Mac and cheese, collards, beans. Again, the meats and sides were delicious. And we are full at the end. Some of the charm of bbq is the plate special where you order your meats and sides are included. I get it, They charge by the lb and side sizes (most people would probably want medium-large $8/each). I do not regret ordering this food to go for mid-week dinner, it was delicious, just feel a little short sided for the buck. You should go eat and drink here! Just know that you will be paying premium price for premium bbq and you will pay for that side of corn bread. Not that there's anything wrong with that.",4.0

"Ill get to the point: Sandwiches vs meat: Ditch the sandwich option and go for the plain meat instead. You will get more meat for your money. Also, they drown the sandwiches In sauce, and me personally, Id rather put sauce on my sandwich myself. Ask for a roll on the side. (See below). Brisket: On par with some of the best Ive had. Good crust. Good texture, Good smoke flavor. Just the right amount of fat. Not too much, and not too little. Not earth shattering, but outside of Texas, pretty damn good. Pork belly: Wow. This is like pulled pork on steroids. Really really good. The temperature needs to be just right to get the fat to the right consistency. Ribs: Wow! the spareribs are to me the show stealer. The texture is amazing The rub is what is key. A coarse pepper based rub, sweet and tangy at the same time. There is an addictive taste quality about this that I cant describe. Sides: OK. not the best, but not the worst. I had the beans and slaw. Cornbread: Wow again. Sweet, crusty, crumbly. Perfect for sopping up the grease from the meats. One gripe is that they should give some plain cheap white bread (i.e Wonder) to go with the meats. This is a custom at BBQ joints across the south. I did however ask for a roll on the side and they obliged. All in all I think this is some of the best Ive had outside of the Midwest/south. The spareribs in  my opinion was the star. I think if you read through these reviews, you will find differing opinions, but I don't think you will have a bad meal if you go here. It is expensive, but its New York. I would come here again for sure.",4.0

"$$$ The BBQ is very very good. The decor, bar, space is fantastic and like a bbq dream. The only turnoff is that it's a bit overpriced. I get that it's Brooklyn, even Red Hook, but It loses its love when the portions for 2 ppl to go comes to $60. I'm used to NY prices, I get what they are doing here, I've eaten at Blue Smoke, Dino, Hill, etc. Two meats (1/2 lb) and three sides. Brisket, lamb belly, Mac and cheese, collards, beans. Again, the meats and sides were delicious. And we are full at the end. Some of the charm of bbq is the plate special where you order your meats and sides are included. I get it, They charge by the lb and side sizes (most people would probably want medium-large $8/each). I do not regret ordering this food to go for mid-week dinner, it was delicious, just feel a little short sided for the buck. You should go eat and drink here! Just know that you will be paying premium price for premium bbq and you will pay for that side of corn bread. Not that there's anything wrong with that.",4.0

"Ill get to the point: Sandwiches vs meat: Ditch the sandwich option and go for the plain meat instead. You will get more meat for your money. Also, they drown the sandwiches In sauce, and me personally, Id rather put sauce on my sandwich myself. Ask for a roll on the side. (See below). Brisket: On par with some of the best Ive had. Good crust. Good texture, Good smoke flavor. Just the right amount of fat. Not too much, and not too little. Not earth shattering, but outside of Texas, pretty damn good. Pork belly: Wow. This is like pulled pork on steroids. Really really good. The temperature needs to be just right to get the fat to the right consistency. Ribs: Wow! the spareribs are to me the show stealer. The texture is amazing The rub is what is key. A coarse pepper based rub, sweet and tangy at the same time. There is an addictive taste quality about this that I cant describe. Sides: OK. not the best, but not the worst. I had the beans and slaw. Cornbread: Wow again. Sweet, crusty, crumbly. Perfect for sopping up the grease from the meats. One gripe is that they should give some plain cheap white bread (i.e Wonder) to go with the meats. This is a custom at BBQ joints across the south. I did however ask for a roll on the side and they obliged. All in all I think this is some of the best Ive had outside of the Midwest/south. The spareribs in  my opinion was the star. I think if you read through these reviews, you will find differing opinions, but I don't think you will have a bad meal if you go here. It is expensive, but its New York. I would come here again for sure.",4.0
"After a long-overdue climb at BKB and a visit to Fairway, my hunger was on overload. Hometown was very close so we made it happen.When we arrived there was live music going on in the front that seemed passable, but we headed to the more proper restaurant in the back. The meat line was non-existent despite the place being reasonably full so we ambled up to the bar.The guy serving the meats was wearing a chef coat with ""Evan"" on it, and we proceeded to have 5 minutes of banter about the wonder of being named Evan. He then gave us a ton of great recommendations and some extra food. I don't know if non-members of the Evan fraternity would have the same experience, but the service was excellent.The ribs were really well cooked. They needed a drop of sauce but were good once that was added. The jerk chicken was excellent and ended up in an egg scramble the next morning. The potato salad was also really good - lots of dill and definitely homemade. I wouldn't call our selections earth-shattering but this was damn fine BBQ. On an unrelated note, I noticed that several reviewers gave this place two stars because it is far from where they personally live.

"The trip into red hook from the upper west side was well worth it for Hometown's amazing barbecue. We ordered the brisket, mac and cheese, Korean BBQ sticky ribs and collard greens. The brisket was cooked to perfection and had a fantastic smoky flavor. The highlight of the meal had to be the Korean sticky ribs that were covered in a delicious sweet glaze.   The line was about 20 minutes on a beautiful weekend Saturday so not a long wait at all when it comes to such a popular place.  Not only was the food great the restaurant had a laid back vibe and a live country band adding to the authentic Hometown experience that I highly recommend for those who love barbecue, music and beer.",5.0
"Finally great BBQ in NYC! Brisket, ribs, jerk ribs, beef ribs were all outstanding! Great sides, we had the collard greens, potato salad, cornbread, and slaw. All were very good!

"For food alone it's 4 or 5 stars, but the other factors weigh it down....Food-Brisket was tender and deliciously seasoned.-Mac N Cheese was gooey with a bit of zest.-Cornbread was sho'nuff.-Beans were nothing special but still tasty.-The mega rib was pretty good but F'ing pricey. It's impressive to marvel at but the size to consumable meat ratio is pretty skewed.-No room for desserts. An excuse to return. Also want to return for the turkey plate and wings.Service-If you don't get here early you're in for a stand. The place fills up fast and looks to only be manned by two chefs.-Bar service was lacking. The bartender was not very smooth but, to be fair, she desperately needed help on a Friday evening shift. Looked like plenty of people in an official capacity hovering about but not wanting to chip in. She was really, really, painfully in the weeds. The natives were restless.-Good beer and whiskey lists though.Decor-No frills, as it should be.-Would be fun to take in the tunes some night.-Great community space.-Family spot earlier in the evening, with parents cutting the kids loose.

"There has been a lot of grumblings about this place and I have been dying to try it. You would think this place was BBQ heaven however it fell short for me. The brisket was ok, I prefer Morgans. The spare ribs were super dry and had way too much black pepper/pepper corns, the pickles were bland, collard greens were just ok. The sweet sricha sauce and bbq sauce was pretty good. I liked the service and the space was certainly nice.

Brooklyn Industries and the flannel industry sighed in relief, as they would have lost a sizable chunk of their customer base.  It takes a bunch of sucker transplants to put up with such an energy suck of an experience.

"Great find. It's definitely a bit of a hike to get here, but it's a wonderful spot nonetheless.Went here for a friend's birthday celebration in the afternoon. Large, open space that had a pretty good-sized crowd. Our group was already comfortably spread out on one of the large tables. It's a simple process. Drinks at the bar, Food at the counter. If you have a really large order, they'll give you a number and bring it out to you.I wasn't that hungry so I was looking for something a little smaller. I ordered the smoked sausage sandwich with jalapenos and cheddar and a side of cornbread. Wow, delicious! The sausage was served on a baguette with pickles and spicy mustard. I could tell it was good quality since there was none of those little chewy fat bits that you usually find in sausage. I hate those. This sausage was meaty, spicy, and just a hint cheesy. Really hit the spot. The cornbread was excellent. Some of the best I've had, and went really well with the hot sauce.Also enjoyed the Bloody Mary. They make it with Guinness and garnish it with candied bacon! Would like to go back in the summer months.",5.0
"I had the chance to come here for dinner last after hearing recommendations that it's the best Barbecue joint in the city. Unfortunately, I didn't experience it that way, but it's still a recommend in my book. The atmosphere was very nice and comforting along with the music and the chatter amongst customers enjoying their food. The wait on the line is one of the reasons I gave it a 4 star review since, logistically, the restaurant has the potential to be much better in that department. The other reason is slightly minor but disappointing. Basically, the majority of the food choices (Jerk Baby Back Ribs, Sausages, etc) were already out by the time I ordered and this was during dinner on a Saturday night. Again, logistical problems were at play. Though, the food that I got to order and taste were the main highlights of this establishment. Flavors from the brisket and pulled pork really made a difference and the side dishes of potato salad and Mac and cheese were comforting. A minor inconvenience was price to portion ratio but if you're willing to ignore that then I recommend coming here at least once to try. I'm sure there are other barbecue joints with better value for the quality of food.",4.0

"2nd visit. Brisket here still wins over any other brisket. Great bark which makes it very tasty. 2nd time they ran out of turkey by 5PM. This time, tried the Spare Ribs. Again great bark. But not very smoky in taste and meat (although not tough) wasn't falling off the bone. Not bad, but not great either. Also tried the Chipotle Chicken. A bit overdone and very plain tasting - not even a hint of Chilpotle or spice. Queso Mac and cheese was very good and this time I tried the cornbread, which was good - moist and tasty - but could have been a touch sweeter. But the most memorable thing about the visit ... unfortunately ... was the wait. An hour and ten minutes from the back of the line (which was at the entrance). This place needs help in moving things along at the counter - lots of help. There are only two counter people who cut the meat, serve you, and collect the money. And it seems like people just take their sweet old time about ordering. Each ""party"" takes a good 5 minutes. The line couldn't have had more than 25 people on it, yet it took 1 hour 10 minutes and I arrived at 3:45PM on a Sunday. Honestly, even if this place was exceptional, I would not go back unless I heard that they improved their speed. There is really no excuse for a line of that many people to take that long.",3.0

"So if you want to talk about BBQ in NYC and don't mention Hometown, you clearly don't know what you're talking about.  I first came across Hometown at the Big Apple BBQ last year and absolutely fell in love with their BBQ since.  Finally made it to their location in Red Hook about a year ago and can't stay away from the place.  Every single thing I have ever ordered from them has been top notch and amazing.  In fact I loved this place so much I even had my wedding reception here.  I first met the owners Lianna and BIlly a few months back when we started to think how cool it would be to have a wedding reception at Hometown.  From the moment I met the two of them, my now wife and I knew this was the place for us.  Granted I would imagine not too many people have had their wedding reception there, you would never know that from the perfection they executed the event with.  Billy and Lianna both sat down with my wife and I and discussed what we wanted on the menu.  Having tried most everything on their menu and been overly satisfied with it all it actually made for a difficult decision.  We went with the Beef Rib, Brisket, Chipolte Chicken and a WHOLE HOG for the main course with the Siracha Wings and the Lamb Belly Banh Mi for the apps.  When I tell you everything came out amazing is an understatement.  Lianna (who is more of the logistical expert) was SO COOL when explaining everything and planning our big day down to every last detail.  The rest of the staff who was present at the reception were also equally as awesome and made us feel really awesome and stress free.  I know having a wedding reception at a BBQ spot may be too outside of the box and out of the  question for some people but for us it was perfect.  Aside from our awesome experience lets talk about the food and location.  The location is in the now really trendy area of Red Hook at the end of Van Brunt St. right across from the Fairway.  The building itself is pretty huge with two separate rooms and two separate bars.  The main room is also shared by the service counter with a very attentive staff there to answer any of your questions about any of the meats served.  The menu is up on the wall and having been a frequent customer for a while now I understand that the menu changes slightly from time to time so to have a traditional paper menu is not practical.  You basically order the meat by the pound and the service folks will prepare it right in front of you.  Once you have your food you can move over to the bar to grab one of the craft beers or whatever.  There is a ton of seating in either room so its pretty cool.  Now to the food.....  Like I've said probably 20 times in this review the food is AMAZING.  This is not only my opinion but the opinion of many local and even national food critics.  Billy (the owner/ pit master) has participated and competed in BBQ contests throughout the country.  I was actually bummed to find out he wouldn't be there for my reception but Lianna informed us he was actually in Memphis for Memphis in May (for you that don't know what that is, it's one of the largest BBQ competitions in the country).  Pretty good excuse to not be around.  Either way, the food, regardless of what you order is phenomenal.  My personal favorite is the Beef Rib.  Costing around 35 bucks for a whole beef rib may seem expensive, but when you see the size of it your concerns will be dispelled.  They are absolutely gigantic!  The only way I can describe the way it tastes is imagine eating the best porterhouse steak you have ever had and couple that with the texture and tenderness of Filet Mignon.  It is out of this world.  Hometown is also know for their brisket (having won the brisket category in the Kingsford invitational this year) and it is really really good.  I have eaten brisket at all the big brisket places in NYC (Fette Sau, Blue Smoke, Dinosaur, etc) and Hometown's can't even be compared.  A really cool aspect of NYC BBQ is that there is not a set standard so BIlly and the other pit guys at Hometown can really play with different ideas for their BBQ and take some of the influence from the different areas of the country and make it their own.  Moving on the the other menu items, the other ribs are awesome (the even have jerk baby backs which being in Brooklyn is a cool shoutout to the Caribbean population) and the spare ribs are fall off the bone.  The other menu item that you are committing a sin if you don't order on every visit it the siracha wings.  Blended with the perfect smoke taste and tang from the sauce, these are the best wings I have ever had in my life. Overall, Hometown is one of, if not my favorite restaurant in NYC.  Not only are the staff and owners amazing people, they really hit the BBQ genre of food on the head.  I can't say enough good things about this place.  AND if anyone out there ever had the idea of have a wedding reception in a fun out of the box way, this place is a great place to check out.",5.0
"What I love about this place is that you can step inside on an early summer evening and grab a beer by the bar and listen to a blue-grassy band and nosh on BBQ and feel like a world away from New York. Maybe it's the air off the bay nearby, but really it feels like a glorious getaway. It feels like a homecoming; you can let your hair down.Don't come a prime time and expect speedy grub: the line can be long. Good things take time. This place does not serve food in a New York minute. But if that's what you're looking for, this isn't the right spot for you tonight, hun.Try the wings. Thank me later.",5.0

Everywhere else I've had it in NY is bland and dry. Here, $14 for a half pound is pretty ridic but everything about it is so perfect and worth it. Second best protein wise is the lamb belly. Why? Because I wasn't expecting it on the menu. I'm tired of that pulled-pork ish because everyone does it. Surprisingly the only time I've had absolutely terrible pulled pork was in Nashville, TN.

For a self service place, it is extremely slow just to get your food.  On a Sunday we waited about 40 mins just to get to the front of the line to order the food when the line was not that bad.  Chipotle can handle the same line in under 10 minsThey should observe the efficiency of Hill Country in the city.  Same type of cuisine and much more pleasant dining experience and customer service. This place really needs to relook at their efficiencies. Everything is self service. U pick up your food, utensils, and drinks and hope to find a seat for you and your friends after waiting on that long line.  On the upside the slow service allows people time to finish eating so u can have a seat.

"So if you want to talk about BBQ in NYC and don't mention Hometown, you clearly don't know what you're talking about.  I first came across Hometown at the Big Apple BBQ last year and absolutely fell in love with their BBQ since.  Finally made it to their location in Red Hook about a year ago and can't stay away from the place.  Every single thing I have ever ordered from them has been top notch and amazing.  In fact I loved this place so much I even had my wedding reception here.  I first met the owners Lianna and BIlly a few months back when we started to think how cool it would be to have a wedding reception at Hometown.  From the moment I met the two of them, my now wife and I knew this was the place for us.  Granted I would imagine not too many people have had their wedding reception there, you would never know that from the perfection they executed the event with.  Billy and Lianna both sat down with my wife and I and discussed what we wanted on the menu.  Having tried most everything on their menu and been overly satisfied with it all it actually made for a difficult decision.  We went with the Beef Rib, Brisket, Chipolte Chicken and a WHOLE HOG for the main course with the Siracha Wings and the Lamb Belly Banh Mi for the apps.  When I tell you everything came out amazing is an understatement.  Lianna (who is more of the logistical expert) was SO COOL when explaining everything and planning our big day down to every last detail.  The rest of the staff who was present at the reception were also equally as awesome and made us feel really awesome and stress free.  I know having a wedding reception at a BBQ spot may be too outside of the box and out of the  question for some people but for us it was perfect.  Aside from our awesome experience lets talk about the food and location.  The location is in the now really trendy area of Red Hook at the end of Van Brunt St. right across from the Fairway.  The building itself is pretty huge with two separate rooms and two separate bars.  The main room is also shared by the service counter with a very attentive staff there to answer any of your questions about any of the meats served.  The menu is up on the wall and having been a frequent customer for a while now I understand that the menu changes slightly from time to time so to have a traditional paper menu is not practical.  You basically order the meat by the pound and the service folks will prepare it right in front of you.  Once you have your food you can move over to the bar to grab one of the craft beers or whatever.  There is a ton of seating in either room so its pretty cool.  Now to the food.....  Like I've said probably 20 times in this review the food is AMAZING.  This is not only my opinion but the opinion of many local and even national food critics.  Billy (the owner/ pit master) has participated and competed in BBQ contests throughout the country.  I was actually bummed to find out he wouldn't be there for my reception but Lianna informed us he was actually in Memphis for Memphis in May (for you that don't know what that is, it's one of the largest BBQ competitions in the country).  Pretty good excuse to not be around.  Either way, the food, regardless of what you order is phenomenal.  My personal favorite is the Beef Rib.  Costing around 35 bucks for a whole beef rib may seem expensive, but when you see the size of it your concerns will be dispelled.  They are absolutely gigantic!  The only way I can describe the way it tastes is imagine eating the best porterhouse steak you have ever had and couple that with the texture and tenderness of Filet Mignon.  It is out of this world.  Hometown is also know for their brisket (having won the brisket category in the Kingsford invitational this year) and it is really really good.  I have eaten brisket at all the big brisket places in NYC (Fette Sau, Blue Smoke, Dinosaur, etc) and Hometown's can't even be compared.  A really cool aspect of NYC BBQ is that there is not a set standard so BIlly and the other pit guys at Hometown can really play with different ideas for their BBQ and take some of the influence from the different areas of the country and make it their own.  Moving on the the other menu items, the other ribs are awesome (the even have jerk baby backs which being in Brooklyn is a cool shoutout to the Caribbean population) and the spare ribs are fall off the bone.  The other menu item that you are committing a sin if you don't order on every visit it the siracha wings.  Blended with the perfect smoke taste and tang from the sauce, these are the best wings I have ever had in my life. Overall, Hometown is one of, if not my favorite restaurant in NYC.  Not only are the staff and owners amazing people, they really hit the BBQ genre of food on the head.  I can't say enough good things about this place.  AND if anyone out there ever had the idea of have a wedding reception in a fun out of the box way, this place is a great place to check out.",5.0
"What I love about this place is that you can step inside on an early summer evening and grab a beer by the bar and listen to a blue-grassy band and nosh on BBQ and feel like a world away from New York. Maybe it's the air off the bay nearby, but really it feels like a glorious getaway. It feels like a homecoming; you can let your hair down.Don't come a prime time and expect speedy grub: the line can be long. Good things take time. This place does not serve food in a New York minute. But if that's what you're looking for, this isn't the right spot for you tonight, hun.Try the wings. Thank me later.",5.0
"Had a pulled pork sandwich and a half pound of spare ribs, plus cole slaw, corn bread, and a draft beer.  The sandwich was very good.  The spare ribs were better than ribs in an average restaurant.  There were some flies in the place, but not too many.",4.0

That means something because he talks about Salt Lick like it was sent down from the gods. I've had almost everything here but by far the Brisket is my favorite. Everywhere else I've had it in NY is bland and dry. Here, $14 for a half pound is pretty ridic but everything about it is so perfect and worth it. Second best protein wise is the lamb belly. Why? Because I wasn't expecting it on the menu. I'm tired of that pulled-pork ish because everyone does it. Surprisingly the only time I've had absolutely terrible pulled pork was in Nashville, TN. MUST GET: Mac and Cheese, cornbread (then douse the sweet and sticky bbq sauce on it), and potato salad. BRISKET. BRISKET. BRISKET. BRISKET. BRISKET. BRISKET. BRISKET. BRISKET.",5.0

For a self service place, it is extremely slow just to get your food.  On a Sunday we waited about 40 mins just to get to the front of the line to order the food when the line was not that bad.  Chipotle can handle the same line in under 10 minsThey should observe the efficiency of Hill Country in the city.  Same type of cuisine and much more pleasant dining experience and customer service. This place really needs to relook at their efficiencies. Everything is self service. U pick up your food, utensils, and drinks and hope to find a seat for you and your friends after waiting on that long line.  On the upside the slow service allows people time to finish eating so u can have a seat.

"Was totally excited to dine here after reading a spread on Hometown in Thrillest. But I have to tell you I was sincerely and truthfully disappointed. The line was terribly slow for starters, we went midday on a weekday so the place wasn't packed. They were just slow for no reason.

Another thing that turned me off to this place was the site of them throwing out food. The carver literally was cutting brisket and ribs, weighing out of the pieces for orders. Then in front of our faces they were throwing out ribs, chunks of meats... Big pieces not scraps. Wasteful and sad when Meals on Wheels, and City Harvest exist. When asked why are they throwing out food? He simply chuckled and lied, ""Oh, those are scraps we make our beans with"". Then shortly after he proceeded to throw out scraps of paper, plastic and trash in the same trash can as those ""beans destined scraps"". This is just another well dressed and advertised hipster hole. Shoot go to ""Brother Jimmys"", at least you get what you pay for there. Or better yet, do it yourself.

"Location is a slight disadvantage, but it's also good for us customers in that it will not get too packed. Hometown is near Brooklyn's Ikea so maybe you wanna stop buy after buying some furniture and soggy pizza?The bbq meat is tasty and juicy, but it can get pretty pricey. Runs about $20-$25 a pound of meat on average, but don't be fooled, it can fill you up really quickly. I ordered half a pound of brisket, pulled pork, ribs, and a slice of cornbread to share with my buddy. The cornbread is pretty delicious--one of the best I have eaten. The meats were also very tender and flavorful. My favorite was the pulled pork. The brisket comes in a close second, but the ribs were good also. If it is your first time, like mine, I would suggest getting a few meats to see what your preference is (or maybe that's just the fatass in me speaking). They have a little sauce and water station so you can get your own supplies. They only have 3 sauces, but plenty of bottles of each. The meats itself were plenty juicy, but maybe some people need an extra kick. Hometown is like a cafeteria style restaurant in that you find your own seats and serve your own water. When you first enter the place, you can immediately get on line to order whatever foods you want. They will hand it to you in a tray and you can find some empty seats. I can see how it can get crowded because they have tables of 4, which is really good for privacy. So if more people come, the tables may be gone. However, when I went, I did notice an extra seating area that was closed. I don't know how big that area is, but they seem pretty prepared for a full house.

"Came on a Saturday night. Live music by JD Patch was great. Place was lively a lot of people having a good time drinking and eating. This place is a little off the beaten path, but it's probably a blessing in disguide because if this place was closer to the masses it would be too busy and crowded to have a good time. Parking also was a lot easier given the proximity.     Down to the food. I cannot say enough good things about quality control here. The owner was constantly checking on the meat to make sure it was served to his liking. Barbecue is a cuisine that is easy to get wrong. Everything has to be smoked perfectly. Too much or too little and it is not right. The line moves a little slowly as they have everyone going to one station to get their meat and sides, but it wasn't too bad. It took me about 15 minutes to get to the front of the line. I am sure during non-peak times it is a lot faster. Bartenders waited on my quickly.     We tried to get a little bit of everything because I am huge fan of the food and have travelled to various parts of the country to eat it. We had, brisket, spare ribs, jerk ribs, pastrami bacon, and jalapeno sausage. The brisket was perfectly smoked. It has the perfect amount of fat and the seasoning was really good. Very juicy. Spare ribs just had salt and pepper and were also done well. The jerk ribs had a nice flavor and the patrami bacon was very good too. The sausages which are made on premesis were one of my favorite parts of the meal.     Side orders were also very good. Some barbecue places don't pay as much attention to the sides as they worry more about meat. This is not the case here. The mac and cheese is really good. Burnet end baked beans had I nice sweet flavor and big chunks of burnt ends. We also had slaw and potato salad which were solid. Great selection of alcohol and beer as well.     I had a great time at hometown and will come back again soon. I am glad the owner goes through great lengths to make sure his product is superb because real barbecue fans can be unforgiving. They are doing barbecue justice. Good job.",5.0

"In Brooklyn's fair city Where the girls are so prettyI met a nice woman named Molly MaloneWe talked about 'cue andWe'd both tried a few andShe sent me to Home Town to try the brisket.""Oh try, oh try-oOh try, oh try-o,It's melty! and smoky! so try, oh try-o.""She was right -- the brisket was exceptional. Also very good: jerk baby back ribs. Lamb belly was smoky & tasty; pork belly was tender but not exciting. As others have reported, the kitchen was out of beef ribs before the dinner rush had even begun, and I wish they'd resolve that issue. Molly Malone had told me the sides were...just fine, and for the most part I found them unexceptional, though I liked the vinegary cole slaw a lot, and the whiskey pickles were good too. The corn bread's sort of cakelike -- sweet and dense. But really, it's the brisket that wins the show -- so wherever you are, Molly Malone, thank you for the tip.",4.0
"Absolutely amazing brisket!  I went to a party catered by Hometown BBQ a couple weeks ago and after several portions of brisket, jerk baby back ribs, mac and cheese later i was a believer.  My wife and i went out to Red Hook today to fill ourselves with everything we could related to BBQ.  Empty stomachs prepped for the challenge we ordered brisket, full rack of jerk baby backs, 9 pork and brisket tacos(what a treat), mac + cheese, smoked pit beans, collard greens, Hometown slaw, Whiskey sour pickles.  Yeah that was just for two of us :).  Shiner Bock, IPA, pilsner, couple of Evan Williams with pickle back shots later and we had a few ribs to take home for later.   These guys know what they are doing.  It is only a matter of time before you see trophies and banners lining the walls with wins at BBQ competitions.  I spend a lot of time in BBQ places around the country and can say without hesitation the brisket is the best i have had.  The tacos were a surprise and refreshing break between bites of pure brisket heaven.  Oh thats right half of them were brisket tacos :). We walked out stuffed very happy to have a place like this a few miles from our home.  The Brisket is off the hook in Red Hook!",5.0
"One of the best pulled pork sandwiches I've ever had and their banana pudding was delectable. Also enjoyed the Sirachi chicken wings and Sirachi bbq sauce. Great space and atmosphere.

"Craving some real good beef brisket for the last few days, i yelped this place out since i was in nearby Dumbo. Having had spectacular brisket from a food truck a few weeks before, my bar was set high.Out of several in-a-row mediocre eating experiences, i was really hoping this Red Hook hipster eatery would get my thumbs up, unfortunately i was again disappointed. The few quick reviews i read (very positive) didn't prepare me for the huge Saturday evening line out the door to the order window (about a 45 minute wait) , or the lack of table service. It took us about 5 minutes to get oriented, and figure out how this weird place worked (just get on line like cattle to slaughter).While waiting on line, one nervously looks around the establishment trying to eyeball a seat, there were four of us, and the long beer festival hall tables didn't make the task easy. Once at the order ""window"" the ""butcher"" asks you what you want, and cuts off pieces of it, and weighs it right on the spot. The meat prices average $25-$30 a pound. Some things were cheaper, like the sausage, which they ran out of .The beef ribs are $25 a pound, bone and all (are you f*cking kidding me?!?) were too rich for my blood to even try. Though I suspect if its like everything else I tried, good thing I didn't waste my money.So we ordered we ordered the beef brisket, dark Chipotle chicken, lamb & pork belly, and a side of Mac n Cheese ($8 for large). Out of all those things, the cheesy mac was the best tasting, garnering a 7/10 on my subjective taste scale.The Brisket was just ok, at a 6/10. Not even close to the cheaper and much better brisket I had from the food truck. I hate myself for not remembering what it was called.The lamb belly was very dry, and had no taste (though it had a spicy rub) 3/10The pork belly was dry and tasteless too 2/10The chipotle chicken was spicy and decent tasting, but super dry 3/10My friends pulled pork had no taste, and a weird mushy consistency 2/10Their potato salad (is that what it was??) had a weird tangy-mixed with coleslaw type formula. I kinda liked it, but it was weird nonetheless 4/10Other notes...The cashier didnt say thank you when I was done ordering and gave this kidults their due tip.The banjo playing band from Flyoverlandia, sucked.Parking took a little time to find (Saturday night, and lots of other establishments in the area).On the plus side, the beer was good.All in all I spent close to a C note and was very disappointed.Though I've never had Dallas BBQ's brisket, their Beef ribs are AWESOME, and you get a huge rack (like 3-4 pounds) for 15 bucks, with a bunch of sides. How these hometown a-holes can charge $25 a pound (thats like 1-2 ribs) for beef, is beyond me.Tommy says skip it.",1.0
"I had the brisket,  pulled pork,  beef rib and spare ribs with a side of slaw.  Over $90 for food alone and it was seat yourself/serve yourself.  I guess i should have paid more attention to the prices but just too expensive.  Atmosphere was nice except for the 10 toddlers running around the place.  For those reasons I won't return.  Got there before 5 and beat a very long line to wait for food.  Food was good but very very rich. Ribs disappointing and dry.  Pulled pork very moist as was the brisket and beef rib.  Slaw tasted dirty, metalic like it hadn't been washed. Overall it is good but not a good enough experience to repeat.",3.0
"Came on a Saturday night. Live music by JD Patch was great. Place was lively a lot of people having a good time drinking and eating. This place is a little off the beaten path, but it's probably a blessing in disguide because if this place was closer to the masses it would be too busy and crowded to have a good time. Parking also was a lot easier given the proximity.     Down to the food. I cannot say enough good things about quality control here. The owner was constantly checking on the meat to make sure it was served to his liking. Barbecue is a cuisine that is easy to get wrong. Everything has to be smoked perfectly. Too much or too little and it is not right. The line moves a little slowly as they have everyone going to one station to get their meat and sides, but it wasn't too bad. It took me about 15 minutes to get to the front of the line. I am sure during non-peak times it is a lot faster. Bartenders waited on my quickly.     We tried to get a little bit of everything because I am huge fan of the food and have travelled to various parts of the country to eat it. We had, brisket, spare ribs, jerk ribs, pastrami bacon, and jalapeno sausage. The brisket was perfectly smoked. It has the perfect amount of fat and the seasoning was really good. Very juicy. Spare ribs just had salt and pepper and were also done well. The jerk ribs had a nice flavor and the patrami bacon was very good too. The sausages which are made on premesis were one of my favorite parts of the meal.     Side orders were also very good. Some barbecue places don't pay as much attention to the sides as they worry more about meat. This is not the case here. The mac and cheese is really good. Burnet end baked beans had I nice sweet flavor and big chunks of burnt ends. We also had slaw and potato salad which were solid. Great selection of alcohol and beer as well.     I had a great time at hometown and will come back again soon. I am glad the owner goes through great lengths to make sure his product is superb because real barbecue fans can be unforgiving. They are doing barbecue justice. Good job.",5.0
"I'll start by saying we drove from Staten Island to Red Hook Brooklyn to try this place, and I'll end by repeating it was worth every mile and maybe 20 more.You order by the pound here, and while you discuss your options Billy (the owner) is handing you samples to get the BEST idea of what you'd like. We had the half hog, brisket, and beef run with a side of corn bread, cole slaw and beans.Every item can be cut with a fork and downed with a perfect beer pairing.hooray for authentic family owned wonders like Billy and Hometown BBQ",5.0
"YUM. I had the lamb banh mi and a cornbread. I added more sauce to the lamb as it was a bit dry, but other than that... fantastic. I recommend not eating the entire cornbread as it's really heavy.

"In Brooklyn's fair city Where the girls are so prettyI met a nice woman named Molly MaloneWe talked about 'cue andWe'd both tried a few andShe sent me to Home Town to try the brisket.""Oh try, oh try-oOh try, oh try-o,It's melty! and smoky! so try, oh try-o.""She was right -- the brisket was exceptional. Also very good: jerk baby back ribs. Lamb belly was smoky & tasty; pork belly was tender but not exciting. As others have reported, the kitchen was out of beef ribs before the dinner rush had even begun, and I wish they'd resolve that issue. Molly Malone had told me the sides were...just fine, and for the most part I found them unexceptional, though I liked the vinegary cole slaw a lot, and the whiskey pickles were good too. The corn bread's sort of cakelike -- sweet and dense. But really, it's the brisket that wins the show -- so wherever you are, Molly Malone, thank you for the tip.",4.0

The absolute best i have ever had. It melted in my mouth and the flavor was just divine. We were served our food on a cookie sheet.

"Wanted to love this place based on reviews but this place nor food comes near a five star. Firstly, waiting one hour in line to place an order is unacceptable. Secondly, to get attitude from the meat cutter for asking a question n cashier to direct his frustration because he does not have change is even more unacceptable after such a long wait. Guy running around w his daughter, who seemed to be the owner/manager? was quite sympathetic n nice as he apologized for credit card machine being down n later gave us siracha wings. Btw, line was molasses slow before machine went down. Now down to the food...Let us just say that if it were not for the bbq sauce bottles on each table, the meat does not taste like bbq at all. Between all of us, we ordered brisket, pulled pork, spare rib, mac n cheese, cole slaw and corn bread. Our rating:Brisket 3 stars, pink so undercooked and not flavorful...no seasoning taste at all.Pulled pork 2 stars, no bbq taste, alot of fat n skin slab taste. Huge dissapointment.Spare rib 1 star, barely cooked raw n pink n no flavor n dry.Mac n cheese 1 star as cheese n pasta tasted like two entities while it should have fused together, also cheese not melted enough. Cole slaw 1 star, very basic. Corn bread 5 Stars hence why place should be called hometown cornbread and not bbq.Girl serving sides, owner and male waiter this past saturday were all very nice, all others blah. Place is nicely designed but food and service does not represent the high money cost.Do not fret though as you will not be dissapointed nor wait a ridiculous time at Butcher Bar in Astoria.

"Finally made it here.  Best item by far was the cornbread, might be the best one I've ever had.  Mac n cheese really good.  Brisket solid although not as good as Hill Country in Manhattan.  Jerk ribs good, not great.  Fun place but not the best ever as some Brooklynite friends have represented.",4.0
"Best smoked BBQ this side of Franklins (or at least in new York). Ribs were awesome,brisket great, and moist turkey. I couldn't stop eating the burnt ends BBQ beans. Pickles were homemade and a pint of shiner bock!  I will be back as often as possible but for now I'll settle with the 4 pounds I brought home for dinner!",5.0
"I gave Hometown BBQ in Red Hook a try. They claim ""central Texas"" style Q although I never saw lambs belly on a  roadside joint menu. Brisket, Pork Belly, Lamb Belly, and Pulled Pork and a Shiner on tap! All excellent! For those who have never had the good fortune to eat at a Texas BBQ joint, counter service and serving on paper is standard!",4.0
"It was late and the pizza place was closed, so we stopped here. I'm glad we did! The best BBQ we've ever had and great environment.",5.0
"SO Im scrolling through some reviews and tips and Im finding that nobody mentioned how amazing the pulled pork was! But before i get into that ill start from the beginning. We ordered beef brisket (good but not enough flavor, and a little fatty), texas mac and cheese that came with approximately 1 bacon bit. Anddddd drum role pleaseeeeeeeeee.... the pulled pork. The absolute best i have ever had. It melted in my mouth and the flavor was just divine. We were served our food on a cookie sheet. A little odd to me but my mind kept saying finish the pork as fast as you can before everyone else steals it!  In fact it was so good we finished our food in 7 minutes. Enough said, come here and eat your heart out!",3.0
"Wanted to love this place based on reviews but this place nor food comes near a five star. Firstly, waiting one hour in line to place an order is unacceptable. Secondly, to get attitude from the meat cutter for asking a question n cashier to direct his frustration because he does not have change is even more unacceptable after such a long wait. Guy running around w his daughter, who seemed to be the owner/manager? was quite sympathetic n nice as he apologized for credit card machine being down n later gave us siracha wings. Btw, line was molasses slow before machine went down. Now down to the food...Let us just say that if it were not for the bbq sauce bottles on each table, the meat does not taste like bbq at all. Between all of us, we ordered brisket, pulled pork, spare rib, mac n cheese, cole slaw and corn bread. Our rating:Brisket 3 stars, pink so undercooked and not flavorful...no seasoning taste at all.Pulled pork 2 stars, no bbq taste, alot of fat n skin slab taste. Huge dissapointment.Spare rib 1 star, barely cooked raw n pink n no flavor n dry.Mac n cheese 1 star as cheese n pasta tasted like two entities while it should have fused together, also cheese not melted enough. Cole slaw 1 star, very basic. Corn bread 5 Stars hence why place should be called hometown cornbread and not bbq.Girl serving sides, owner and male waiter this past saturday were all very nice, all others blah. Place is nicely designed but food and service does not represent the high money cost.Do not fret though as you will not be dissapointed nor wait a ridiculous time at Butcher Bar in Astoria. You will close your eyes when you bite into their bbq meat especially the pulled pork.",2.0

"Dude, as a texan I seriously am in love with this place. Not only did one of the head guys, Mitch, take time to sit down with us and make sure we were enjoying every bit, we had a typical experience akin to TX BBQ here. Ribs-absolutely delicious, nice peppery crusty and moist outer layer to falling off the bone meat! Brisket-delicious, very very tender and falling apart. Sides were good. I learned about the dedication of the pit master and there is live music alcove next to the main dining hall. Will definitely return here!",4.0
"The food is great, really spectacular. But until they figure out how to more efficiently serve customers, it's not worth coming. A line in the middle of a weekend afternoon can stretch to an hour, and here's the rub: more than half of the tables are empty. They just can't (won't?) figure out a system to serve people quicker. Even if they don't care about all of the people who schlep out here to eat, staffing one person exclusively on sides and allowing one person to exclusively run the cashier would immeasurably improve service (and profits). Or try something else. More people will mean fewer waits. Slow cooked doesn't need to be slow served.",1.0
"We came in here before a grocery trip to Fairway so we wouldn't be so hungry while shopping. This place did not disappoint. The food was really good. I had pork belly tacos, jalapeño cheddar sausage and the queso mac & cheese. Everything was really good, I can't wait to come back. The decor is awesome as well.

"We thought this was going to be just another BBQ spot in Brooklyn but we were SO WRONG!  Hands down the best BBQ in NYC.

"On Sunday, August 31 at roughly 12:30pm, we had a nice first time lunch at Hometown BBQ. It took 15 minutes wait time, which according to many of the lower-starred-reviews here, is pretty quick. When we arrived, there happened to be a lull in the line, so we were fourth walking in. Soon thereafter the line wrapped around the American flagged brick wall to the outside door, and luckily remained inside, as it was almost as hot outside as inside the BBQ cooker. Rows of dining tables were implausibly empty in a two-roomed restaurant which serves at least 100.I can see why ""the wait,"" and I wouldn't want to chance a return for a Thursday to Saturday night dinner to wait an hour to eat: there is only one station on the left for cutting up the meat, and the right side of the counter serves the sides and collects the money. With a second station, Hometown could easily be selling twice as fast and as much, and satisfying that many more devotees, who have trekked from their hometown to the very ends of Red Hook. Why frustrate them? Perhaps they need to ration the precious portions of meat carefully smoked the night before...In the most time consuming part of the serving process, the cutter carefully weighs all of the portions in front of you, although you don't get to see the scale weight. I guess they want to avoid controversy.And once arriving at the serving counter, you better know exactly everything you want to order, because you won't be coming back for seconds or dessert until the next time you dine here.  Of course you've had plenty of time to think about and prepare your order: the menu is written on the butcher paper hung on the wall next to where you are standing.The counter service is friendly and efficient enough. There was room for a tip on the invoice, in addition to the cash tip cup, which I guess like at Katz's Deli, is a tradition for the cutters.  With waiting on line, bringing my tray to the table, and cleaning up, I thought I deserved a tip too. They took my debit card, I signed on the dotted line, but I did not receive a receipt (I forgot to ask as I salivated over my tray.)I ordered the BBQ basics for two:  1/2 pound brisket, 4 spare ribs, 2 corn breads, the Texan creamy mac 'n cheese, and the Hometown (cole) slaw, for just under $50. We were not disappointed. Everything, including the free cold water, was fresh, tasty and excellently prepared and flavored. If we two had alcohol, the bill would have easily been $70+, which is far from outrageous for lunch, let alone dinner, in NYC. The paper-lined-aluminum-sheet-pan looked appropriately filled with food, but my wife wondered how we would finish it all, while I wondered whether it would really be enough. It was just about right. We will return...",4.0
"Awesome place in the middle of nowhere. Very simple menu with very few options. The wait was extremely long, had to wait nearly 30 minutes on line before I was able to order. By the time I got there, they told me the only things that were still available were the pulled pork and the brisket... Somebody should have told us while we were waiting on line that 80% of the menu is now out of stock. I chose the brisket which was pretty good and filling. The sides were tasteless and definitely were not worth it.",3.0
The BBQ is one of the best in Brooklyn.  Smoked Turkey is outstanding.  The Beef Ribs are huge and well worth it.  The Pork and Brisket are outstanding as well and the sides are all worth trying.  The atmosphere and bar area are a great place for groups.  Totally worth a visit.,5.0

When eating a beef rib it's better to just pick it apart with your fingers rather than try to eat it off the bone.  The meat is juicy, succulent and velvety with interlaced fat.  If rendered correctly, in only a way that slow cooking in a smoker can, you will be rewarded with fat that melts like butter in your mouth.  And since fat absorbs aromas it will carry all of that luscious smoke right to your brain.  This makes it on my death row meal list.The atmosphere is great and does a service to the BBQ joint of Texas.  Although it is impossible to recreate the years of history and culture of the Texas meat market turned BBQ joints it is possible to pay homage to them.  Hometown does this well but still in a way that New Yorkers can connect with.  Red Hook is alive here.Staff was friendly and knowledgeable.  They knew what I was looking for when rambling off the cuts I wanted.  Served an au gratis piece of fatty brisket as a way to sample the pit mans skill and sacrifice is a way for them to say ""It's good and you will think so too"". I've been to Fette Sau and other Brooklyn BBQ joints in the past.  They are good especially compared to what's offered in Buffalo.  However, in my opinion this is the holy smoke of Brooklyn central Texas style BBQ.  Make the trip, get out of your neighborhood and see what Red Hook has to offer.  You won't be disappointed.",5.0

When eating a beef rib it's better to just pick it apart with your fingers rather than try to eat it off the bone.  The meat is juicy, succulent and velvety with interlaced fat.  If rendered correctly, in only a way that slow cooking in a smoker can, you will be rewarded with fat that melts like butter in your mouth.  And since fat absorbs aromas it will carry all of that luscious smoke right to your brain.  This makes it on my death row meal list.The atmosphere is great and does a service to the BBQ joint of Texas.  Although it is impossible to recreate the years of history and culture of the Texas meat market turned BBQ joints it is possible to pay homage to them.  Hometown does this well but still in a way that New Yorkers can connect with.  Red Hook is alive here.Staff was friendly and knowledgeable.  They knew what I was looking for when rambling off the cuts I wanted.  Served an au gratis piece of fatty brisket as a way to sample the pit mans skill and sacrifice is a way for them to say ""It's good and you will think so too"". I've been to Fette Sau and other Brooklyn BBQ joints in the past.  They are good especially compared to what's offered in Buffalo.  However, in my opinion this is the holy smoke of Brooklyn central Texas style BBQ.  Make the trip, get out of your neighborhood and see what Red Hook has to offer.  You won't be disappointed.",5.0
What can i say if i ever arrive on death row make this my last meal i will go in peace. Beer and beef rib all the sides my go to spot,5.0
"Hello meat lovers! This place is the bomb!!! Was recommended to me by a friend after an exiting trip to ikea which is only a few minutes away by car. First of all, the place is huge! Old warehouse seems like, awesome look to it! You can easily see it transform into a beer garden at night, does it? The people working there are super friendly too. The menu is very small and could be written on your hand :) I had the lamb sandwich, they made a Vietnamese version of it with daikon and cilantro, super greesy but oh so heavenly. My husband got the pulled jerked chicken, so flavorful, light but rich. We had a side of fantastic beans. So fantastic we bought a large cup to go. Can't wait for my next visit. If you live in the city like us, this place alone is an excuse to leave the island, and if you go to ikea, forget these silly overrated Swedish meatballs, come here and have a food-orgasm.

"So, sorry to those who feel the need to complain about Hometown's location and decrease the stars in their review as a result. Maybe great things are worth a little effort? Ride a bike, take a walk.... Maybe you should move closer? I would LOVE to live near this place and make it my main source of nourishment, community and entertainment. I could live on Hometown's cornbread alone; THE best I have ever had. What a great place and cool staff (Love you Jill!). There's quite a few bbq places around these days and all seem to fall short on either their style or their side dishes, it's about time there's one that gets it all just right - plus great music and a fun spacious layout. Thanks Hometown, looking forward to many good times ahead!",5.0
"Holy BBQ. Straight up, bangin'! This place easily tops all the other NYC BBQ establishments (Hill Country, Fette Sau, etc.). Brisket = ""Outta this world"".  The space is also very nice, and the staff seemed polite, helpful, and not too cool for service industry school. Everybody was friendly and somehow just being in this place I felt like a NYC BBQ insider. Van Brunt Distillery nearby too, which is great to check out.",5.0
I tried- I gave this place a second chance.  Was very surprised how quiet they were for a Saturday night- even having a live band.  With that said our service was terrible.  A group of us went and sat in the back bar- being almost empty you would think the bar,1.0
"Two out of the three meats we sampled rate five stars, hence  the rating. Brisket lovingly trimmed and fondled for moistness was as good as I've come across. A short rib was as meltingly tender as if it had been braised. The pulled pork was the odd protein out. It was delicious and tender, but served at too  low a temperature, so it only rates a 3-4. Collard greens were properly cooked, the pork enriching but not overwhelming their flavor. The spicy baked beans with burnt ends were as good as they get. I was less impressed with the whiskey sour pickles - not sure if more whiskey would help, but I found the faint taste of it to be neither here nor there. Cole slaw was fresh and not overly sauced, just not as spectacular as the greens and beans. Drinks from the bar were good if service could have been friendlier. No such problem at the meat counter.It would be nice if there was some white bread to make sandwiches out of the brisket or pork in true Southern fashion. You can have the bbq as a pre-made sandwich but that strikes me as a bit inauthentic. I would have liked a North Carolina vinegar sauce or a mustardy South Carolina sauce for my pork.We came early, about five and had a short wait. The line ebbed  and rose after that.Reheated the pulled pork at home, and it was quite good.",5.0
"Amazing food!!!  One-pound of beef ribs was a single giant one.  The meat was tender, fall-off-the-bone incredible.  Beautifully spiced and juicy.  The half-pound of lamb belly is life changing!!  Incredible.  The whiskey sour pickles were our favorite side.  The greens are good, the beans and mac and cheese are just ok.  There was live music (Friday/Saturday evening) which was just ok.  It's definitely a young crowd and the crowded line can be annoying, but the food is completely worth it.  Cannot wait to eat more of their amazing barbecue!!",5.0

"Just got home from a trip.  Had a great recommendation from a friend, and had tried a random sampling at South.  However, my wife and I found the brisket and baby back ribs both quite dry.  Not a little bit, either.  The collards were good, but I expect some meaty chunks in there somewhere.  Wife said the cornbread was good, but also a bit dry.  Sauces - not my style.  Sweet sauce had no heat, hot sauce had too much sweet, hog sauce was vinegar.Again, I've heard better about it, and tried a bite before that was good, but this was very disappointing.  Overpriced for what was served.",2.0
"Like many others have said, this is a great addition to Brooklyn BBQ scene.  Brisket was excellent.  I loved the baby back ribs, but I usually like them a bit more chewy. Others in my party thought they were a little dry.  Excellent cornbread, but other sides need work.  Beans were far too saucy, Mac n cheese was far too cheesy. Cole slaw was fair.  This will be my regular BBQ place, but next time I'll skip the sides and just get cornbread.  I look forward to trying other meats next time I go.Decor is great for BBQ joint.  Low key and simple. Not flashy like some places in Manhattan.",4.0
"I have very, very low expectations when it comes to BBQ in NYC. I think Dinosaur is abominable. I have a few places to try, but my god. Disappointment after disappointment. Needless to say, I felt a bit deflated when my father announced we'd be dining here for a family dinner. It's been over twelve hours and I'm still feeling INFLATED. Obviously, it was fantastic. The lamb belly (!!!!!) really stole the show, and we had the least of it. Next up was the brisket, rich and tender. The ribs were a bit dry for my liking, but easily gussied up with the sticky sauce and hot sauce. Sides were OK (other than the UNBELIEVABLY sinful and buttery cornbread), but I'm not looking for the quality there. I'd rather have some bad ass meat than mac. Go. Go now. Cuz this place is going to blow tha fuck up. Believe it.",4.0
"I came here just under a month ago. I think it might just have made me a BBQ addict because I've been chasing the deliciousness high going to way too many BBQ spots in the last few weeks. None have compared thus far.I went with a big group and it's my favorite way to enjoy BBQ sicne it helps you keep costs down (sort of) while still getting a chance to try as much as you'd like. At Hometown, we tried almost everything. Brisket - we started with the moist brisket and it was just about the best thing I've ever tasted. Juciy, meaty flavor on the inside with a perfect coating of smokyness and seasoning. I went up the second time and they had run out of the moist brisket so I begrudingly ordered the lean. It was amazing! I normally dislike lean brisket and I thoroughly enjoyed this one which means they're doing something right in their seasoning/smoking.Pulled Pork - this is usually my go to for BBQ. It's my control for the experiment of how good a place is. Hometown passed with flying colors. Moist and well soaked but still has that meatiness you go to BBQ for. Jerk Ribs - I love jerk seasoning on basically everything and I was glad this was an option. Thing is, it's still BBQ which was a pleasant surprise. They didn't try and force the seasoning and just let it mix well with the smokiness. I say you must get some if you're here.Lamb - Holy Lamb of God! This was amazing. I like lamb so I might be a bit biased but this was unlike anything I've ever tasted. Absolutely tender like lamb usually is and perfectly smoked. I think you can see a pattern here.Sides - We got a bunch of sides and they were all pretty great or amazing. Mac and Cheese was okay. I've had better but still a very delicious side. The real winners in my opinion were the pickles which weren't too pickled, the coleslaw which I'm usually picky about, and the #1 side was the beans. Those beans were an explosion of flavour that complimented the meat perfectly. Now, for some negatives. I doubt their ability optimize their menu. We went on a Thursday evening at about 7pm. It was empty and we luckily didn't have to wait at all. As soon as we started eating the line grew but it never got too crazy. Still, when I went up to order the second time, they had run out of nearly everything and the place was never really packed. This would make me question taking the trip out to Red Hook.For that reason, I questioned not giving a 5 star rating. The reason I settled on a 4 is because I've never had BBQ in Texas or the Deep South so I'm guessing those might still be better. I'm keeping my ability to call those a 5 open. If not for that small hope, this place would get a 5 without a question.The people are great. I met the manager and he was just about the coolest guy ever. I'll head back once I've finished my New York City BBQ quest. So far, this is the clear winner.",4.0
"Bumping up to a 4-star. The beans are superb, so my experience with the sides here has been very positive. Also had the pulled pork this time (good but not memorably so) and the lamb belly (really unique and flavorful, though I wouldn't do more than 1/4 lb per person of it).,",4.0

"If you like long reviews, read on. If not: CORNBREAD CORNBREAD CORNBREAD. Everything else? Eh. Collard greens notably bad. With that said, here's the rest: If you're at all familiar with brisket don't expect too much from Hometown. The fatty brisket (the very enthusiastic and helpful man often behind the counter will help) is the variety to try. Unfortunately, the brisket just lacks flavor--one is compelled, one MUST put the sauce on, or it won't be worth the horrific journey to Red Hook. Luckily the various sauces available are of high quality--find the one that's right for you and you'll be happy. Avoid the jerk chicken which is dry and generally just not very good, even bland, like the attempt of an Illinois housewife or househusband to ""spice things up!""; obviously for jerk you're much better off making a trip to Crown Heights or Jamaica. Let's discuss the sides. They do a weird number where you order meat, then sides--it's just confusing, an unsound method. The collard greens, otherwise one of the delights of life, are to be avoided. They are bitter, almost sour--the taste is totally bizarre and just not the way greens are supposed to taste, full of the languid flavor of summer. The greens were also undercooked. The baked beans were unhappy in their own unique ways, as was the mac n cheese--disappointing. I note this because Hometown isn't particularly cheap, and these sides are simply not worth ordering. What is worth ordering, however, is the CORNBREAD. Wow. One of the five best cornbreads I've eaten, up there with Nashville, TN, Atlanta, Birmingham, and Memphis--real cornbread country. Honestly it would be worth the trip down to Red Hook just for the cornbread. And you could order enough for the week. Now there's an idea...In general, Hometown is kind of overpriced and not very good. But it has redeeming qualities, like the very friendly people behind the counter (they'll convince you to order more than you need, beware), the bbq sauces, and the cornbread. If you find yourself in Red Hook (????) it's not to be missed.",3.0

And perhaps peach cobbler for dessert.  If that happens, I won't need to move to Texas.",4.0
"delish and completely satisfied my bbq craving. Three very hungry bellies ordered the lamb belly, quarter chicken, spare ribs (3), brisket, mac and cheese, pickles and cornbread (2). The cornbread had this obscene honey glaze baked in. It was rich and dense, not grainy like most cornbreads, almost like a dessert. The highlight of the order though was clearly the brisket. We got 1/2 lb of brisket - came out to a slice of fatty brisket and a slice of lean. Both were melt in your mouth but the fatty brisket won out by a long shot. The lamb belly was incredibly flavorful, not at all gamey but had a little too much grizzle for my taste. Spare ribs didn't even need sauce but weren't quite falloff the bone. Mac was good. I wish they would jar their pickles. Good beer selection, great food, a bit of a wait but it was definitely worth it.",5.0

"Beef rib is delicious, but why cant you just get half pound of it? They cut it off the bone and serve it with the bone but ain't like anyone is gonna eat the bone...so I think half pound of beef rib should be an option!The pulled pork is good. The sauces are good.UNFORTUNATELY, the sides are really mediocre in comparison. The beans were drenched in the sauce. The collard greens were subpar--not much flavor, kind of one-dimensional even with the added pork. We got a small in both and we didn't finish either of these. The cornbread was bland, although the honey on top was a nice touch. I'm knocking off a lot of stars though because the SERVICE WAS BAD. They were unfortunately out of brisket, and there was someone in line that asked the server when the brisket would be ready. The server said he didnt know, that it could be as quick as ""5 minutes"" or as long as ""45 minutes."" The customer then inquired if the server could ask someone in the back for a more accurate timeframe as he was interested in getting some brisket to-go after dining in. The server, visibly annoyed by the customer's further inquiry, didnt even bother to ask the pitmaster and implied that asking would be pointless/a hassle because the pitmaster would have to weigh the meat or something. He didn't sound apologetic or sympathetic to the customer.First of all, if the wait could potentially be as quick as ""5 minutes,"" you should get your hiney to the back and ask. What's the harm? The customer wants to buy more food, and REFUSING to SIMPLY CHECK how long til the next batch of brisket comes out is a SLAP IN THE FACE to that customer. Plus, the line is pretty long (we were there on a Saturday a little before 2pm), so if indeed the wait potentially was going to be as quick as 5 minutes, then the customer could've had others go in front of him til the brisket came out. Seriously, train your middle-aged hipster-wannabe servers correctly with some proper restaurant manners. As for my own order, I think they charged me an extra $13 or so. We got the beef rib ($25), 1/2 lb pulled pork ($11), 2 small sides ($8) and 1 cornbread ($3). The total was a little less than $65. That doesn't add up. Unfortunately, we didn't realize this until we drove off, so we weren't able to bring it up. I guess 13 bucks is no big deal in the end, but considering the aforementioned incident, it annoyed me. In addition to training your servers to abide by some degree of service to the customers, please train your servers to do their math correctly.The meats were good. Certainly better than a lot of the other places around town. But if you have CR*P service and start overcharging people for things they didn't buy, that's not gonna do ANY good for the business...EDIT: I was just informed that the beef ribs were $25/pound with it usually being 1.5 to 2 lbs. We asked specifically for a pound. You know how you go to Whole Foods, ask for a pound of salmon, they weigh it at 1.1 pounds and ask hey, is that alright? Yeahhhhh, you guys should really do that so that the customer knows how much they're paying beforehand. Again, CUSTOMER SERVICE, FOLKS...it can make or break a business.",1.0

"This is a great place for barbecue. We had ribs, pulled pork, pulled chicken, sausage, beans. Macaroni salad, coleslaw, and whisky sour pickles. Everything was great.

"I attended a private catered event here, but was lucky enough to be served some menu (and not menu) items. The restaurant doesn't open for a couple of weeks, but the food was so freaking fantastic, I had to write a review.The pork belly was tender and mouthwatering with just the right amount of tang added in the sauce. Was it lime? Was it vinegar? It doesn't matter. I was weeping. It was perfect.Chicken breast was moist with a fantastic smoke on the skin. Lots of people at the event were frankly going chicken crazy, prosthelytizing about how mouth-watering and perfect it was. You would think God was in the chicken. It was that good. The beef rib (which is not on the regular menu, I am told) was so delectable and had a really satisfying bark. I really hope Billy, the owner/chef  offers this as a special, because, damn....DAMN. I'll be dreaming about it. Sides were mac and cheese and baked beans. The mac and cheese was rich, salty, satisfying and sprinkled with bacon. I think you can opt out of the bacon, but why would you? The beans were AMAZING. They were pretty spicy and at least 50% butterbeans. I thought that was a nice twist on a classic side that I don't usually care that much about. The atmosphere  was really fun and casual. Long tables and chairs give the room a picnic feel. There is a back room, possibly for events and private parties. Perfect for live music, which I hope happens often. Seriously, I can't recommend this place enough. Great place for a group of friends to grab some beers or a plate of bbq. Fantastic place to take your out of town guests for an impressive meal and a stroll along the waterfront to have a look at Lady Liberty.So impressed.",5.0

"I have mixed feelings about this place after a couple of visits.  They could use another counter-person to weigh the meats as the line can get quite long even during off hours.  The lamb belly was fantastic.   But I was almost done with my meal by the time my husband got his brisket tacos delivered to our table during our most recent visit.  The brisket on the tacos was kind of skimpy for the price and dry.  The sides, collard greens and beans, were meh.",3.0

Whatever, I always get everything to go anyway. However, I recommend that you use the sauces up front near the counters where you pay, if you don't want to have the sauces the kids sucked on. Other than that, I have eaten here many many times and it is very good. The lamb and pork belly are especially good. The sides are meh. The other meat is always great, fab ribs. Highly recommended!

"I live in Red Hook and have been waiting for this place to open for months. My boyfriend tried the jalapeno and cheese sausage at Red Hook Flicks over the summer and swore we'd be there on opening night, and we were! We braved a thunderstorm, and it was well worth it. I don't eat red meat, so I was very happy to see that they have jerk chicken and a few meatless sides on the menu. The chicken was amazing. Sweet and very spicy. Based on the prices, I went ahead and ordered a half instead of a quarter and it was so much meat that I took a whole quarter home. My boyfriend got the half hog and another sausage (because he said it was too good to not get again), and he said they were both fantastic. My mac n' cheese was super yummy as well. Very reasonable prices for the quality. And they have a full bar with a decent beer selection. The ordering system for food at the counter and drinks from the bar is a bit odd. You order food and pay at one side of the room, and then drinks can either be ordered at the bar or brought to you by waitstaff and paid for there.

"Here's what I tried & what my impressions were:MEAT:1) BRISKET- I had the moist, or fatty brisket..I must say, this was the superstar of the group..Perfectly moist, and smoked to perfection, with the right flavoring.  Another 2 times that I went though, the brisket was dry.  There may be a consistency issue here.  At $28 a pound for inconsistent brisket?  I'm not taking any chances by ordering this.2) LAMB BELLY- moist, but otherwise uneventful.3) BABY BACK RIBS- Dry & bland..Lacked big-time in the flavoring department. They need to go back to the drawing board on these.  4) BEEF RIBS- Flavorful like the beef brisket, but not as enjoyable because the skin was a bit too tough & the meat under it was a bit rough in certain sections & unflavorful.  This indicates that either the meat was overcooked, or cooked a while ago & kept warm, to the point where it dried out.They also sell you like a 1/2 pound bone with the meat, & the portions are usually at least 2 pounds..So at 25-30 dollars a pound, (or whatever exactly they're charging for it -don't quite remember) it's totally not worth it to shell out at least $50 for a piece of meat with a Flintstones-sized bone attached to it.SIDES:1) MAC & Cheese-  Creamy & enjoyable, although one time I tried it, the cheddar cheese was watery because they ran out & were rushing it out of the kitchen.2) Backyard potato salad-  Very uneventful..Tasted as if it were store-bought.3) Baked cornbread- Delicious but reminded me of something in Greek cuisine which is considered a dessert,  instead of real baked cornbread.  As a point of comparison, I use ""John Brown Smokehouse"" 's cornbread-casserole as the gold-star measuring point for what real cornbread should taste like.                                              PRICEWISE:In general, the place seemed quite pricey, compared to what I've spent at other quality bbq joints..At least $70 flew out of my pocket each time, paying for two (no drinks), while not getting a whole lot of quantity, and a limited amount of very good quality,compared to what my expectations were. From my other experiences @ quality bbq joints, the ballpark figure for food for 2 should be around $40-50 (not including drinks) Another thing that irked me was the cheap quality plastic utensils..I understand if your theme is on-the-go bbq on a paper sheet, & metal tray .. but the cheapie knives they provide don't cut into the meat very easily.. The forks also make you feel like  you should be eating  kindergarten food instead of bbq.  They could have at least upgraded to heavier duty plastic utensils..SUGGESTIONS:To save you a lot of aggravation & money, in these tough economic times, if you're going here for the first time & are reading these Yelp comments for suggestions, as I usually do, you are probably hungry.  Grab a couple of slices of the moist brisket (hopefully, it's moist that day), a large mac & cheese & a cornbread..This should hit the spot & do the trick , while keeping your wallet intact.Honestly, with so many other quality BBQ joints out there, I would altogether skip this place, unless you happen to be in Red Hook..On average, I spend about $45 for food for 2 at a quality place like ""John Brown's""  but somehow end up spending $70+ here..Either this place is overpriced, or the guy weighing the meat or the other guy behind the register are applying fughazy math when tallying things up.",2.0

"Memorial Day Monday. I'm in Coney Island and hubby is craving BBQ. Yelp leads me to this place. The line was sick and we actually waited over 45 minutes. Our hunger totally got the best of us, so we ordered the brisket, spare ribs, potato salad, mac & cheese and cornbread.  Overall I wasn't super impressed. I was waiting for this amazing flavor explosion and I didn't get it. The brisket was soft but I added sauce for some more flavor. The spare rib was okay. The potato salad had way too much vinegar in it and it was too smooth (I like to have chunks of potato in mine). The mac & cheese was nothing spectacular, it has some hot pepper which was a nice addition, but my mom's mac is wayyy better. The best part of the meal was the cornbread. Super buttery, sweet and cakey but not too sweet. It was a huge slice and I wanted more. Overall the meal was kind of a let down since we did wait over 45 mins, which for us is unheard of.  The beer was good though, I had a pale ale and hubby was excited because they had ole smokey moonshine.

Tried the weekend lunch sandwiches and they are amazing.  Biggest disappointment is the high price.  Sandwiches on the rolls run about $11-12 without any sides.  Large enough place that you can find seats easily to separate yourself from the abundance of annoying kids whose parents don't believe in old fashioned discipline.,4.0
I was excited to try a different BBQ place in Brooklyn. Despite having exceptional brisket everything else was overly peppery and underwhelming. The most awful baked beans and macaroni and cheese. The potato salad was too vinegary. Although there is plenty of room to sit inside and enjoy a show the food must be good. And this left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Plus it was far too pricey for mediocre bbq. Sticking with Fette Sau.,1.0
"Great BBQ; bad service. It was a quiet Sunday afternoon and there were 5 people ahead of us in line. It took over 20 minutes to place our order! I can't imagine going on a weekend night. They have one person slowly cutting meat and chatting and another person who has to get all the sides and ring you up. It's painful to watch. They might want to check out Mighty Quinn's to see how it's done. Both the lamb belly and spare ribs were excellent, as was the vinegary cole slaw and pickles. I'm a fan of MQ's but liked this better, especially the crusty black pepper on the ribs. The lamb is very fatty so a smaller portion goes a long way.

Tried the weekend lunch sandwiches and they are amazing.  Biggest disappointment is the high price.  Sandwiches on the rolls run about $11-12 without any sides.  Large enough place that you can find seats easily to separate yourself from the abundance of annoying kids whose parents don't believe in old fashioned discipline.,4.0
I was excited to try a different BBQ place in Brooklyn. Despite having exceptional brisket everything else was overly peppery and underwhelming. The most awful baked beans and macaroni and cheese. The potato salad was too vinegary. Although there is plenty of room to sit inside and enjoy a show the food must be good. And this left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Plus it was far too pricey for mediocre bbq. Sticking with Fette Sau.,1.0
"Great BBQ; bad service. It was a quiet Sunday afternoon and there were 5 people ahead of us in line. It took over 20 minutes to place our order! I can't imagine going on a weekend night. They have one person slowly cutting meat and chatting and another person who has to get all the sides and ring you up. It's painful to watch. They might want to check out Mighty Quinn's to see how it's done. Both the lamb belly and spare ribs were excellent, as was the vinegary cole slaw and pickles. I'm a fan of MQ's but liked this better, especially the crusty black pepper on the ribs. The lamb is very fatty so a smaller portion goes a long way. Please please please get more staff and some hustle behind the counter...",3.0
"Easily the best BBQ I've ever had in NY. The pulled pork was absolutely fantastic. The potato salad was the best I've ever had, anywhere - it was light, bursting with flavor and perfectly balanced. The brisket was very good as well. I'm a big sauce guy and I could barely bring myself to put sauce on anything because everything was so good on its own...But when I got around to it the Carolina BBQ sauce and the sticky BBQ sauce were fantastic.",5.0

"Our first visit and we anticipated a great meal based on the Yelp reviews.  We were happy with the brisket....great taste and tender with a nice assortment of sauces.  However, the pork belly tacos were very greasy; the grease literally ran off the tortilla.  The baby back jerk ribs were very meaty and tender, but the spicy taste was too much for baby backs.  I have never had baby back ribs this spicy, and these were over the top hot.  Too bad, they would have been great if the heat was turned down. The sides?  Forget it.  Get ready to spend major bucks for a few spoonfuls of mediocre food. Desserts:  You won't believe what you get for $6:00.  I would be ashamed to serve it.  Check them out before you pay and save your dessert money for something else.Will we go back?  Probably not.  It was good, but very pricey ($80:00 for three adults with no drinks) for Red Hook and if I have to stand in line for food, I want it to be excellent and reasonably priced.",2.0

"I came here on Saturday night to pick up some food - really great experience.  As soon as I walked in, someone who worked at the restaurant caught me looking confused and explained the ordering process (really easy - just walk to the back, wait in line, order delicious meat).  There was a 20-minute wait but a waitress was walking around taking drink orders while you stood in line.  The place is huge with lots of seating, and an awesome live band was playing.  When it came time to order, I got the pork belly, the brisket and the baby back ribs - all were amazing.  Perfectly tender with amazing spiced crusts.  The potato salad was fantastic and vinegar-y, and the coleslaw was also great (not slathered in mayo like at other places!).  The BBQ sauces were also tremendous - there is one that kind of tastes like sriracha :)  I took my food to go, but next time I want to come here and have a few drinks, listen to some live music, and maybe dance a little :p",4.0

"I'll make this short: food was good. I had the pulled pork sandwich but for some reason they throw a dainty amount on a thick hard roll. I'm not being picky, this roll is about 4-5 inches thick making it more of a roll with a slight pork flavor vs a pulled pork sandwich. I ended up eating it off the roll and eating the roll as a side. Also, as others reviews state, service ain't too good. And, their ordering system straight sucks. Hey owners! Do something about it! Having one line with annoyed workers isn't good. By the time you get your food you already have a bad taste in your mouth. Are two lines and a little speed in service too much to ask for? I also had the Mac and cheese which was good. Basically this comes down to them losing business due to service and  ordering system. I honestly may not go back. The food is good but not worth the experience.

"I'd like to start this off by saying that I think the food here is 5 stars and the best BBQ in NYC. I give the service a 3--so average at 4 stars. Food is just wonderful.

"I went there a few days ago, having spent a few weeks in anticipation of its opening, and I was very impressed. I've been to the other big New York BBQ places - Fette Sau, Dinosaur (Harlem and Gowanus), Fort Reno - and this place stacks up with the best of them. There were a few obvious growing pains (the self-serve sauce wasn't labeled and the Pit Master kept apologizing for it, no big deal) but everything at the place has been well-considered, from the menu to the design to the service. The service was great, with a really appreciative, enthusiastic and level-headed staff. Nobody was blowing smoke, and nobody was disdainful either. The nuts and bolts of the operation are apparent all over the place - I sat underneath the stack of wood used to smoke the meat, and the Pit Master had to pick up a few logs and toss them into the smoker while I ate, which was great to see. The polite crew was really working at producing the food, like you would expect at a rural BBQ shack. The ambiance was great, with a good deal of woodwork coming from the Gowanus Furniture company, a woodworker I am familiar with (beautiful, beautiful chopping blocks and shelving throughout). After eating I explored a bit to find another bar closer to the Van Brunt St. side of the restaurant, which felt less family-oriented and more like a gastro-pub, but perfectly paired with the main floor of the restaurant.As for the food - I had the beef rib (one HUGE rib, wet and oily, falling off the bone) recommended to me by the Pit Master and his assistant. It was amazing. The cornbread, which we ate fresh out of the oven, was very impactful - at first I thought it was too rich and oily, but after the first bite through the top layer it was the best cornbread I've had in a long time, and it was the perfect desert after a meal of heavy meat, collard greens and baked pit beans. In total I dropped just short of $30, but I didn't have any beer. It's par for the course, however, when you get a ton of prime meat at a top notch BBQ place in the city. It was well worth it, and the location of the place makes for a much better night out than its competitors.I shall return!",5.0

Went to Hometown on a Friday night (no wait to order the food as others have mentioned) and we had a wonderful time!  The owner Billy came over and introduced himself.  Asked if it was our first time and made recommendations for our meal as well as ordered the chicken wings on the house for us to try because he heard us speaking about them.   We had 1/2lb brisket which is 2 slices of extremely tender (no knife needed) thick Texas style brisket (no sauce on it).  The smoke was fantastic.  The Wings in their homemade sriracha sauce were tender and spiced perfectly with just the right amount of heat.   We had collard greens and beans as sides.  The collards were tasty but the beans in a tomato base and brisket ends were unbelievable.   The bartender (Jill I believe) was so friendly and welcoming.   I am a fan and will be back.,5.0

I typically find brisket dry and tasteless, but the Hometown brisket is a flavor-filled taste sensation. The short ribs, sausages and sides are worth the wait as well. I recommend everyone visit here before the secret gets out and this place becomes mobbed.",5.0
Went to Hometown on a Friday night (no wait to order the food as others have mentioned) and we had a wonderful time!  The owner Billy came over and introduced himself.  Asked if it was our first time and made recommendations for our meal as well as ordered the chicken wings on the house for us to try because he heard us speaking about them.   We had 1/2lb brisket which is 2 slices of extremely tender (no knife needed) thick Texas style brisket (no sauce on it).  The smoke was fantastic.  The Wings in their homemade sriracha sauce were tender and spiced perfectly with just the right amount of heat.   We had collard greens and beans as sides.  The collards were tasty but the beans in a tomato base and brisket ends were unbelievable.   The bartender (Jill I believe) was so friendly and welcoming.   I am a fan and will be back.,5.0
"mmmmmmm brisket!!!! just the thought of it gets me in the mood to leave work and run there *sigh* (wishful thinking). This place is pretty pricey I won't lie, and their beer choices aren't my fav but their brisket, rib and lab belly top the cake!!!!!",5.0
"Slow-ish lunch counter service but oh so tasty. Brisket and beans my favorite. Nice interior, spacious, and more Texas than Brooklyn. Can't wait to try more items here.",4.0
"Delicious! Great service (friendly, quick) and the food was perfect. Macaroni and cheese was to die for and the brisket was cooked brilliantly.",5.0
"I have the good fortune to travel, so my value view of NY restaurants cost to food ratio gets a little skewed.  I stopped by hometown BBQ and this place is just too expensive $11 for a sandwich with just a few scraps of brisket just didn't work for me.  I expected to get a few slices of brisket piled on a sandwich roll, but what I got was a pile of onions and a bunch of candied bark.  The bark was good, but I wasn't able to get a good solid bite of quality BBQ.  With the sandwich they provide you with a side of potato salad, which is served in a small cup usually reserved for ketchup or other condiments.  I don't think this place is worth the expense or the trip.  However they do have a decent bar and $3 high lifes.",2.0
"Came here after reading reviews. Arrived at 9pm on Sunday and three main smoked meats were already sold out, very disappointed. Way too much vinegar in the collard greens. The meats for tender but way overpriced.",2.0

"Lamb Belly Bahn me was fucking amazing. That alone is worth going here. Brisket is also top notch. It is a very bold BBQ. Spare ribs did fall off the bone. The sides are just ok.....mac and cheese is spicy but kinda like Velveeta. The collard greens were tough. Cole slaw was dry and had a lot of black pepper which I like but others were turned off. The corn bread was like eating a stick of butter(in a good way). Backyard potato salad was overdone with vinegar(normally I love this style of potato salad). The Steve's key lime pie is just great but really tiny and the banana pudding is good. Now this place can be pretty pricey(as most of these BBQ joints are). What pissed me off was the games at the checkout for BBQ( I wanted to leave a cash tip) and the bartender(long red beard) who gave me the wrong change(everyone makes mistakes) but got pissy with me when I said it was wrong. Well I was not wrong and I still tipped. Just don't be an ass about it. I know everyone makes mistakes but I was totally chill about it and he was totally defensive.....no need for that. I will be back because the food was good, and I say come here because the food is good. Just be prepared for the ""you are lucky we are serving you attitude"" !",2.0
"awesome meat :-) I had the beef brisket and also tried the pulled pork. Next time I may try the lamb belly, I'm intrigued... Their sandwiches look awesome too.

"I like it. Simple to order, friendly staff, open space, reasonable price and the most important the food is best of what Brooklyn has to offer.

I had baby back ribs ,sausage and the most delicious melts in your mouth briskets that I have ever tasted.  The hours are a little strange and I wish they would carry a larger IPA beer selection but it's about the food.",5.0

Wow...I just luv this place the BBQ is amazing and cant stay away from the place. The beef ribs are so damn big it reminds be of the Flintstones brontosaurus ribs. Amazing flavors. A little pricey though but its worth it. Nice atmosphere and they have a back bar where you can watch football games on Sunday and they serves great brisket sandwiches.,5.0
WOW!!! I sample pretty much the whole menu and it was great. Even the sides were delicious... Don't get me started on the cornbread. I would probably eat another 5 pieces of it.I guess it was worth the hour wait in line. I would recommend going earlier to beat that line.,5.0
"Wow.  So full.  So good.  So much fat.  Had beef rib, brisket, chicken, pickles and cornbread.  So much better than any of the other NY 'cue joints.  Make the pilgrimage - it's worth it.  Note - they will not so much as give you a bun or slice of bread with your dinner, so it's BYOR[oll] if you're into sandwiches.  Strangely.",5.0

"It's a BBQ place. Not fancy, just fun and good food. Brought the buddies and wives for the semi monthly get together. We had a blast and ate like Vikings.

"Hello my fellow BBQ aficionado!!! I'm here to talk about Hometown Bar-B-Que. I usually shop across the street at the fairway market, awesome place. Today after  I finished doing my shopping, I decided to try the new BBQ store on the corner. I'm a guy who doesn't mind the price of a meal as long as I enjoy it. Today I ordered some take out, $12.00 for a pound of ribs (2 ribs), $6.00 for a cup of homemade potato Salad, $4.00 for a small cup of homemade coleslaw, $6.00 for a cup of homemade mac n cheese, and $20.00 two orders of chicken wings  (12 tiny wings). The ribs were tender but lacked taste, the potato salad was bland, the mac n cheese did not taste like cheese at all, and the wings were tasteless and raw. I couldn't finish eating any of it. I should've call the police because I felt like I just got robbed. Guys Dinosaur BBQ is about a 10 min ride and it's way cheaper and it taste 10 x better. O yeah the service is terrible, while I  was waiting for my wings for 25-30 min, there was a table of gentlemen who were waiting for 45 min for their meals. Except for the bartender who seem to be friendly, the cashier and the butcher (butchered the food) had bad attitudes.  I say if you don't like working at this place, find a job you enjoy. Well guys for those who attempt to try this place, don't do drugs. Take care.",1.0

Pretty flavorful baby backs.  It's even better with their bbq sauce. It's not fall off the bone so I didn't like the texture as much...but it's still damn good. The jerk chicken was also good. It had a good kick. Def. get the mac and cheese...it had a smoky flavor.,4.0
I was never crazy about BBQs until i tried this spot.  We celebrated my husband's birthday there that night.  Ordered everything on the menu.  No complain about Anything that we've devour.  It was a cafeteria style restaurant.  order at the counter and eat at any available table.  There's a bar too.  Family friendly.  All the staffs were so helpful.  Definitely going back again and again...,4.0

"Awesome BBQ place, I love the venue and the staff/owner/ambiance/food were all exceptional. It's rare in Brooklyn to find a place that is this good without a major attitude. We went last night for a big group birthday dinner, the place was pretty quiet so we had no trouble taking a giant table for 20 people. Everyone lines up and gets their own food and drinks so there is no fussing over a split tab. The bartender was very friendly and let us taste their special blend red wine- it was light and fruity, a perfect foil for rich BBQ. The Q-master was extremely helpful and steered my girlfriend and I away from the dry brisket (they had run out of wet by this time) toward the most succulent beef rib we had ever tasted, it was meltingly luscious and rich with a seasoned bark, yummy with or without sauce, we also had the pork ribs which I was a little less wowed by but they were still delicious, the sriracha chicken wings which were a dream come true (made to order and delivered separately to the table with a sprinkle of green onion and cilantro and a sweet spicy sriracha glaze), the collard greens which were just lightly vinegar-ed and cooked to a perfect tenderness, and the whiskey pickles which disappeared very quickly. We definitely ordered way too much food but I was happy to taste so many things and take home some leftovers. The friendly owner asked many of our guests if they were having a good time and if they liked the food- and they were and they LOVED the food! He also asked his staff to wrap up the beef rib bone in foil so I could take it home for my dog.
