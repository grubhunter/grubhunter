"Really enjoyed my meal here with some friends. Took a reservation which they said they don't always do around prime dinner times. We had their parpadelle which was excellent! Tender duck and sauce was great. Also had their butternut squash app  which was good too. We had the paella, a little salty and oily for my taste. Scallops which were cooked nicely but there are so little of it. The duck and short ribs were really good! They also give you little little tastings in between courses which is really cute and much appreciated.",4.0
"My business partner and I used to adore battersby and wanted to try Dover. I was at first a bit stunned by the size as I had imagined it to be another quaint place. It's quite large compared to the sister spot. It was a slow night - there were maybe three other tables in the dining area. We got the tasting menu. I have allergies and described them to the server. It seems that didnt always make it back to the kitchen. They kept sending things I could not eat. Normally I dont mind, but with so few people and such reputation, I was a bit surprised. The menu felt very on trend with every current small brooklyn restaurant. I had hoped for a bit more invention. Unfortunately will not be back.",2.0
"We stumbled upon Dover at the tail end of summer for a Sunday morning revival brunch after a long Saturday night and it really hit the nail on the head. The quaint menu, attention to delicate detail (for a meal that is typically overlooked in culinary art....breakfast), and ambiance that made us feel like we were in a cozy local eatery in Vienna. After a return trip for dinner this past week, I think we'll be sticking to brunch.Dover succeeded at their 'compliments of the chef' menu, serving up an exclusive butternut squash soup with whipped cream, homemade banana bread, and other small dishes to tease the palate throughout our meal. Their breads were to die for and my entrè of Squid ink tagliatelle with peekytoe crab would've made for an excellent appetizer. After finishing some oysters, a few chef add-ons, some bread and my entrè, I found myself leaving Dover looking for a large pizza. It's not the place to go if you want to leave full and fully satisfied in both your stomach and wallet. For the price, I couldn't justify the portion size and left Dover wanting a quite bit more.Dover has my heart for exceptional service and top notch attention to detail on both food and cocktails (my Old Fashioned was on point!), but for all of the options that Court Street offers for exceptional values on dinner, I'll leave this one for Sunday morning mimosas.",3.0
"My boyfriend and I came here for brunch on my birthday, and I wish I could give Dover 6 stars - that's how phenomenal the whole experience was. First of all, I loved that I could make a reservation. There is nothing like having the assurance that you will absolutely not have to wait to ease the brunch hanger (hungry anger). The staff was fantastic - I was so thirsty, I thought they'd never be able to quench my thirst with enough water but lo and behold, the attentive server refilled my class at every gulp and I was satiated. We each ordered a bloody mary. I hate when bloodies are pale red and you know it's going to be so watery - these were the opposite of that, a dark red-brown that signaled their intense flavor. The coffee was also great. Foodwise, I ordered the egg avocado sandwich and the pecan cinnamon bun and my boyfriend went with the croque Madame and a side of crispy potatoes. My only regret is that I wished I'd went with the croque Madame as well, which was truly superb, cooked perfectly. I wish the menu had explained that the eggs were hard-boiled - the sandwich was still great, and I ate every bite, but personally I'm not a hard-boiled egg person and it would have been nice to have that flagged. In any case, not a reason to hate on Dover, since it was a very well-executed sandwich. The pecan bun was sweet and fluffy and the potatoes were crunchy and savory. It was a pricey brunch, to be sure, but the experience more than lived up to the price tag.",5.0
"I am from out of town and came at the request of some great friends who are local to the neighborhood. We came for a few drinks to start the night and wow was I impressed! The three of us sat at the bar. We ordered a bourbon drink that tasted like salted caramel (the name escapes me) and a drink the bartender recommended, a tamarind whisky sour, for me.Both were fantastic, to put it delicately. The bartender, I believe his name was Jeff, made our drinks with care and passion. What a great person to welcome me into a new place! He truly is talented at what he does. I would certainly come back just for the drinks and perhaps dessert next time! Highly recommended.",5.0
"There are perhaps 2 schools of thought when it comes to the process of eating:1.  Those who slowly savor each and every tiny little bite.2.  Those who try to jam as much food into their mouth as possible so that their tastebuds are overwhelmed with flavor.  (This is also, coincidentally, a similar trait to that found in crack addicts)I am definitely of the latter school (uhh... not the crack addict part of course *cough cough*).  People often find it embarrassing to sit next to me at a meal... especially at a nice restaurant.  So with that context in mind, let me just say that any meal that can take 3 hrs and not have me feel impatient or bored in between, is a meal deserving of 5 stars.  That meal, was the tasting menu at Dover.7 courses... SEVEN!  With like a million little things in between!  It is definitely a good value for the price, the time and the quality.  Pictures tell a thousand words, but the standout dishes for me were the scallops and the lamb (a substitute that the staff graciously made).I'm glad that this extension of Battersby is living up to the reputation of its beginnings.  It may not have the same intimate atmosphere, but the friendliness of the staff, and the care with which you are served, are impeccable.  The meal was perfectly paced, and it felt like something special.And now I can make reservations online... there goes my bank account.",5.0
"The folks at Dover seems pretty pleased with themselves and I guess it is important that they have their self esteem in place. The food was just ok but the presentation was great, there is  a lot to be said for presentation.     When one of the members of our group inquired about a dessert item the waitress initial tried to fake the description and then came clean by telling us it was a new item and she did not know what it was.    The coffee is lousy (as my Dad would say).  They seemed eager to give us a check on an evening when there were plenty empty tables.   ... And they emphatically do not take American Express cards.",3.0
"Outstanding food.wonderful small plates with in house breads. Four different typesThis was followed by the best paella we have ever had and that includes having this dish in Barcelona. Desert was a knockout. And finally as if I need to say more, the service was warm and professional.",5.0
Dover over the years has maintained an excellent menu with an attentive staff. The noise level however is insufferable. Last night they had ridiculously loud music blaring from crappy speakers. So the screaming at each table had to go up to match. What happened to Dover? It used be a pleasant place for dinner.,3.0
"I sent this note to Dover directly weeks ago and received no response whatsoever, so consumer alert: Dear Dover--On Tuesday evening, my husband and I dined for the first time at Dover. We live in the neighborhood, had heard good things, and were excited to give you a try. The meal was lovely and we left very happy with our experience, but unfortunately later in the night I became extremely ill--nearly ill enough to necessitate a trip to Urgent Care. It was clearly food poisoning and given what I had eaten before dinner/the timing of the illness, it seemed clear I had gotten sick from something consumed while at Dover. My husband and I shared everything except the red snapper dish and he was unaffected, so the snapper seems the likely culprit.Needless to say it was enormously disappointing to be made ill be such a fine and expensive meal, but more than anything I wanted to bring this to your attention to, one hopes, prevent another diner from having the same experience. Please monitor the freshness of your fish more closely. Something was clearly very off.",1.0

"I came across this place on an Eater Best Fried Chicken list and decided to check it out. As a six year resident of NYC, this is top five best brunches I have had since moving here. Each dish (we ordered the sticky buns, gravalax, croque madame, and the fried chicken) was better than the last and we could not pick a favorite. Cannot wait to try it for dinner. It is a slightly pricier than most brunches but worth every penny. This place made me reconsider leaving the restaurant world and going back to being a line cook. Could not have been happier or more impressed. TRY IT!!!",5.0
"A co-worker of mine recently moved to Court Street by 2nd Place, and I immediately asked, ""Have you been to Dover?""He responded, ""I've walked by a few times, but it doesn't look like anything special.""Perhaps he's right. Dover may look just like a hundred other spare, casual restaurants in this city...but that's part of the charm, as far as I'm concerned. They don't need an opulent dining room to attract business; they are full almost every night because the quality of their food remains consistently high, and their hospitality is second to none. Their waitstaff is attentive, but not pretentious. (I appreciate that they will occasionally acknowledge that a bowl is ridiculously large for the tiny appetizer within.)For my part, I've been an enormous fan* of Chefs Joseph Ogrodnek and Walker Stern since they opened Battersby on Smith Street, and so I suppose I was pre-disposed to loving Dover. After five visits, I'm happy to report that there is no 'but' here. I love Dover. As near as I can tell, it's a spacious, more comfortable Battersby where I can make reservations to avoid the two hour wait on a weekday.Much like their sister restaurant, Dover serves fresh, contemporary American food that will range from quite good to astonishingly tasty. Also similarly to their counterpart, the bread basket here is fantastic. Upon ordering, you will be treated to a fresh loaf served with both whipped honey ricotta, as well as an olive tapenade/white bean puree combination. This is in addition to an always-intriguing amuse bouche (probably a soup), and the most explosively cheesy gougères I've ever had the pleasure of eating.  Eventually (and unfortunately), you will have to pay for food as well. I'd urge you to order whatever sounds good on the oft-changing menu, but if you'd like any recommendations, I'm here to serve you:I would start with the octopus. Tender as can be, it is accompanied by chorizo and large white beans virtually swimming in an incredible buttery sauce. That said, you can never go wrong with one of their pastas (try the garganelli) or the cauliflower. If (ooh baby) you like it raw, the hamachi is both stunning and delicious, and the oysters are impeccably fresh. In fact, all their seafood is carefully prepared and sure to satisfy; I've enjoyed cod, bass, and although I usually avoid lobster, the smoked bacon element was too tempting to resist. If you're interested in heartier fare, by all means get the Berkshire Pork (currently on the menu). The only dish I've enjoyed more was the hanger steak served with the pommes puree and oxtail marmalade that I remember so fondly from Battersby's early menus. (Sadly, this option seems to have melted away with the winter, but I'm hopeful it returns later this year.) I personally find the lamb ribs can be a bit too fatty, although the vaguely Thai flavors are still on point.**What am I forgetting? Booze. The bartenders are quite adept with classic cocktails, but their own inventions can be fun as well. I like the Portico, and the passionate tart I am going to marry loved the Passionate Tart. Between the eclectic bottles and the few drafts, I'm sure you can find a beer you'll love as well.I can't believe I've written this much, especially since Dover's food will speak for itself._____________*My fandom is enormous, I am actually not that big a guy.**Everyone has their own preferences though, because I couldn't help but note that the screaming bachelorette party at a nearby table called the lamb ""an orgasm on a plate.""",5.0
Came here for brunch and ended up staying for hours. It's the kind of place where you can't help but order that extra mimosa and linger over conversation. It felt even more enjoyable because there was no long line of people patiently waiting for us to leave so they could get a table. Maybe it was a slow day (it was raining) but I definitely prefer my restaurants on the emptier side. The food was inventive and delicious but dishes were on the smaller side and the meal ended up being pricier than our typical brunch.I did appreciate the super nice service. They didn't have a dessert menu for brunch but our party of 4 was craving something sweet so the waitress came back and told us the chef can whip something up and even offered to surprise us if we didn't have anything particular in mind. It was a nice gesture.I'd definitely return to try their dinner.,4.0
"We came here late on a Friday night for a farewell dinner for friends who were moving to Europe and I think it was a perfect quintessential last Brooklyn meal. We strolled in wearing jeans, sneakers and puffy coats to experience really impeccable service and fantastic food; it was definitely high-end dining in a laid back environment.They start you with two amuse-bouches: gougères and a super delicious cup of squash soup with some whipped foam on top. The only way I can describe this soup is a savory vegetal cappuccino, which sounds disgusting but was amazing. The bread they give you is also great and I loved the labne dip that accompanies it.So far, this is only the free stuff. We ordered the tartare, the tagliatelle with peekytoe crab and the ceviche. The standout was definitely the tagliatelle; chunks of crab with a toothsome homemade pasta, all tossed with a lemon-chile sauce that made you feel like you were eating virtuously (I'm into pretend healthy meals).Our friends got the scallops and the cassoulet, both dishes that were delicious in their own right but the real pièce de résistance was the roast chicken for two. I know, I know - you're saying to yourself ""Chicken? it's basically seitan"" but bear with me. They bring out the chicken first, as if to prove to you they are in fact feeding you a whole bird. Then the entree gets sent out in two courses, the first the anti-diet chicken salad, which is covered in black truffles and then the chicken breast covered in pan juices/crack sauce with grilled radicchio and a root vegetable gratin COVERED WITH MORE BLACK TRUFFLES.The only reason I'm giving Dover four, not the full five stars is because on prior trips, we've had some of their recommended dishes which are less exciting; specifically, the broiled oysters. You can do bivalves better.",4.0
Horrible experience. The space is extremely loud and our party of six couldn't hear a thing. Te server placed us right in the middle of the restaurant next to the bathroom door where people were coming in and out... Then proceeded to ignore us for 10-15 minutes not even bothering bringing a glass of water. Or taking our drink order. This was on a Saturday night and we eventually decided to walk out.This restaurant is extremely pretentious and we were so disappointed based on all the yelp reviews.

"Before I go into my review I want to preface it by saying the food was delicious and our server was attentive, always available, and made sure we were enjoying our meal.1. Wines by the glass were at least two to three dollars too high (mine was the least expensive, at $13) especially given the stingy pour. 2. I ordered the Olive Oil Poached Cod which included a few green olives, some dill, a few cooked green onions and a baked red onion. The fish was okay but even with the accompanying ingredients it was bland. But then it's cod not Dover Sole, and at $32, overpriced. Also for that price the portion was on the small side and if I hadn't had an appetizer I would have left hungry.3. Dessert was to die for but overpriced by at least three dollars.4. While the food says bistro the ambience and decor of the restaurant says diner.5. Music was too loud (James Brown whom I like). I thought it was an odd choice for a bistro. When music is that loud people have to talk over it causing others to talk over them and the domino effect ensues. Didn't make for a pleasant evening.Cost for two: $153, including 20% tip. Not necessarily a deal breaker but If we're going to pay those prices I'll go to some of our favorite upscale restaurants in Manhattan.",2.0
"Walking into Dover on a Monday night my first thought was ""Omg such a cute restaurant, but it looks pretty slow."" I mean its a Monday. My guest and I decided to sit at the bar as we believe service is always better there and it was. From the moment we walked in I must say everyone was the sweetest! I do want to say, if this restaurant was in the city forget about being able to walk in on a Monday. Everything is extremely delicious, I mean everything! As a huge fan of the sister restaurant I expected nothing but the same essence here at Dover. My guest and I ordered the oysters, mushroom ricotta, lobster and lamb. The oysters are perfection, its light and tasty and teases your palette for more. Honestly, I can eat it all day. The mushroom ricotta is extremely flavorful and the added raisins is interesting but finger licking good. The Lobster, yesssss the mouth watering lobster. Easy to eat, flavorful, great portion size and the side of the corn and bacon is delish. Although, I wish they still had the creamy spinach. The lamb, awesome! We were full by the lamb. But still made room for more.Oh! & finally the dessert. The olive oil cake is TO DIE FOR!!! Its so clean, and fresh. Such a simple dessert but the flavor combination really surprises you. Ughhhh. Ughhh. (Sorry just took a mouth watering moment) 5 stars overall. Hands down with a shimmy! So glad this gem is in Brooklyn!",5.0

"We sort of just stumbled upon this place by accident the other day, but I'm so glad we did! It was Superbowl Sunday and we thought it would be smart to try a restaurant we'd normally have a long wait for, so our first thought was Battersby. Not surprisingly, it was closed. We wandered a little further and came across Dover, which ironically is Battersby's sister restaurant and normally does have a long wait. Score! We sauntered right in to the near empty restaurant and got incredibly attentive service (but I imagine a place like this always strives for good service). I love the delicious amuse bouches they gave us throughout the meal - warm cheese puffs, creamy root vegetable soup, and a little alfajor cookie at the end. The homemade breadstick they gave us to start was so incredibly delicious - it was perfectly crisp and buttery on the outside and soft and airy on the inside. The presentation was grand, served with some creamy ricotta butter and crispy papadum.For the appetizer, we started with the pork belly, which was nice and tender. I loved the roasted fruit and vegetables it was served with - pears, sweet potatoes, cabbage, potatoes and shaved watermelon radish on top. It was drizzled lightly with a savory sweet glaze that tied the dish together. For the mains, we ordered the foie gras ravioli and grilled octopus, which was a special that night. The grilled octopus was delicious, with the legs cut into little medallions and strewn about the plate with big white beans, chorizo, roasted piquillo peppers, all sitting in a thick brothy sauce. But I thought the star of the meal was the foie gras ravioli. The dish had chunks of roasted celery root and three perfect little ravioli envelopes filled with delicious foie gras, all topped with a creamy black truffle sauce. The parsley sprigs and crunchy raw celery root pieces on top added the perfect mix of textures. Divine. I tried not to scarf this down too fast so I could savor it.For dessert we ordered the baked Alaska. The meringue was crisped on the outside but still soft on the inside, and filled with a layer of green apple sorbet and another of crème fraiche ice cream. The crème fraiche ice cream was perfect with the toasty meringue but the sorbet actually took away from the dish in my opinion. Loved the little pieces of poached pear this dish was served with though. Yes, it was pretty pricey but I don't actually think it should be four dollar signs on Yelp. There are definitely more expensive places out there.",5.0
"Dover is a restaurant of extraordinaries. While the menu items are extraordinarily delicious and nicely presented, the portions are extraordinarily meager and extraordinarily expensive for the size. Three not-especially-large scallops for my wife were priced at thirty-four dollars--as well a dollop of cod at thirty-two dollars for me!

"We showed up here on a Tuesday night around 8 without a reservation and were greeted and seated immediately. The inside is nicely decorated and the tables have a good space between them which isn't usually the case in NYC. I ordered the tagliatelle which had rabbit and then had the chicken. Both were stellar. They sent off t a few amuse bouches which were also all very good. One was a gazpacho, and another was a asparagus bread puff.

"To know thyself is vital, and I know that I am but a simple food plebe. This made planning to eat at Dover intimidating; reviewing it for you, the Yelpers of Brooklyn, had me feeling fraudulent from the moment I clicked the fourth star. So let me write as simply as I eat: the food was good, the service was good, and the ambiance, sitting inside along a brick wall as the soft late-afternoon spring sunlight cast us all in a happy glow, was delightful.Let's start with what we didn't order. First came some little spherical cheese-puff pastry type thing, maybe the size of a marble. That was followed by a shot glass of refreshing and rich gazpacho and then, a real delight, a plate of fresh seasoned bread and some type of crackery stuff accompanied by a fava bean puree and some ricotta-type cheese. We took up the waitress's offer for a second plate, which came out not only with more bread but also with restocked spreads. Knowing the portion sizes from online photos, we had been a bit hesitant about the prices, but with this many good complimentary appetizers, we certainly got our money's worth. (And stay tuned - there are more.)As for what we did order... As our own appetizer, we got some type of cold-served small potatoes thing. There was a cream sauce and maybe some little orange fish eggs but, to be honest, while it was fine, it was the most forgettable part of the meal. My girlfriend got the cod in a green chile sauce. I went with the grilled tuna. I tried a bite of her cod but that was all she would allow me, given how much she enjoyed it. The tuna was excellent: tender and soft and with a triangle of pink in the middle and flavorful but not overwhelming rub of spices thick on its outside. With it were two salty jolts of anchovies and a bunch of butter beans. If my descriptions are falling short, just know that I would highly recommend the dish.We passed on dessert - we had plans to meet friends for ice cream later - but then, just like before the meal, we were pleasantly surprised. First the waitress brought over a plate with two square-inch brownie bites. What a nice little parting sweet, we said to ourselves. And then, as I signed the check, she came back with two small, individually wrapped cylinders of chocolate chip cookie dough, adorned with instructions to just throw them in the oven at 325 for 10 minutes or so and enjoy. We have made one each over the past two nights and they were fantastic.So yeah. This place is good. Our waitress was a delight. A second waitress, who handled the second serving of bread, was also great and courteous.

"The staff were all very nice and the service was great. My wife and I both chatted with the very knowledgeable bartender who helped us choose drinks. We decided to be adventurous and try the tasting menu. The 5 course menu ran $75 per plate. I expected the plates to be small, but at 5 courses I expected to be satisfied. While all of the food tasted good, the portions were small and the chef's choices seemed to be cost conscious and did not warrant the high charge per plate. We both left hungry and regretful.",2.0
"We sort of just stumbled upon this place by accident the other day, but I'm so glad we did! It was Superbowl Sunday and we thought it would be smart to try a restaurant we'd normally have a long wait for, so our first thought was Battersby. Not surprisingly, it was closed. We wandered a little further and came across Dover, which ironically is Battersby's sister restaurant and normally does have a long wait. Score! We sauntered right in to the near empty restaurant and got incredibly attentive service (but I imagine a place like this always strives for good service). I love the delicious amuse bouches they gave us throughout the meal - warm cheese puffs, creamy root vegetable soup, and a little alfajor cookie at the end. The homemade breadstick they gave us to start was so incredibly delicious - it was perfectly crisp and buttery on the outside and soft and airy on the inside. The presentation was grand, served with some creamy ricotta butter and crispy papadum.For the appetizer, we started with the pork belly, which was nice and tender. I loved the roasted fruit and vegetables it was served with - pears, sweet potatoes, cabbage, potatoes and shaved watermelon radish on top. It was drizzled lightly with a savory sweet glaze that tied the dish together. For the mains, we ordered the foie gras ravioli and grilled octopus, which was a special that night. The grilled octopus was delicious, with the legs cut into little medallions and strewn about the plate with big white beans, chorizo, roasted piquillo peppers, all sitting in a thick brothy sauce. But I thought the star of the meal was the foie gras ravioli. The dish had chunks of roasted celery root and three perfect little ravioli envelopes filled with delicious foie gras, all topped with a creamy black truffle sauce. The parsley sprigs and crunchy raw celery root pieces on top added the perfect mix of textures. Divine. I tried not to scarf this down too fast so I could savor it.For dessert we ordered the baked Alaska. The meringue was crisped on the outside but still soft on the inside, and filled with a layer of green apple sorbet and another of crème fraiche ice cream. The crème fraiche ice cream was perfect with the toasty meringue but the sorbet actually took away from the dish in my opinion. Loved the little pieces of poached pear this dish was served with though. Yes, it was pretty pricey but I don't actually think it should be four dollar signs on Yelp. There are definitely more expensive places out there.",5.0
"Dover is a restaurant of extraordinaries. While the menu items are extraordinarily delicious and nicely presented, the portions are extraordinarily meager and extraordinarily expensive for the size. Three not-especially-large scallops for my wife were priced at thirty-four dollars--as well a dollop of cod at thirty-two dollars for me! I defer to the CIA pedigree of the chef and the need to slowly chew the aesthetic/ascetic vogue food of places like these, but, unsophisticated foodie that I am, I left this restaurant feeling very much hungry and very much ripped-off!",3.0
"We showed up here on a Tuesday night around 8 without a reservation and were greeted and seated immediately. The inside is nicely decorated and the tables have a good space between them which isn't usually the case in NYC. I ordered the tagliatelle which had rabbit and then had the chicken. Both were stellar. They sent off t a few amuse bouches which were also all very good. One was a gazpacho, and another was a asparagus bread puff.

This place is delicious. We had a large group for brunch and samples most of the dishes. They are different and not what you may expect but so tasty!

3 1/2 *s.  Fine dining in Brooklyn.......almost.  High quality meal (tomato salad was nothing special but everything else we had was up there).  Had the lamb main which was cooked the way I like it and delicious.  Nice amuse Bouche and all the little things that make the meal and experience special.  Waitress could have been better - she forgot my red wine to go with my main and when I planned to cancel it and was almost done with lamb she brought it over (extremely late) - that was disappointing and ruined the evening/meal a bit.   Would give this place another shot but not rushing back anytime soon.,3.0
"A little expensive (although, look at the location) but generally very very good. Came with a coworker and had a really good meal.I started with the lamb tartare - lamb mixed with fresh mint, lemon juice, and olives, served with more olives and plain greek yogurt, all with grilled pita bread. So good. The pita were even a cut above the norm (but obviously not Naf Naf caliber). The lamb was flavorful and the fresh mint really set things off. I could have eaten a lot of this. Next for me was the octopus. Good, firm but not too chewy, with nice grilled flavor and served with some thinly sliced chorizo and nice soft cooked white beans. An excellent combination. Specifically, the beans were great with the octopus. And my entree was the hanger steak with oxtail reduction - an incredibly rich, flavorful sauce, all on top of pureed potatoes. The steak was medium rare, and though it wasn't melt in your mouth tender, this cut isn't going to be like that. Really good. They also had stuff on the menu like the ""cavair pie"" which sounded incredibly decadent, and some other really good looking seafood items. Too bad we couldn't try more. Service was attentive without being snooty - they were apologetic about a police car outside doing it's darndest to give everyone in the restaurant epilepsy - it was annoying, but not their fault. I doubt I'll be back in the area again, but this is worth a visit if you're looking for something upscale.",4.0

"My dinner at Dover was one of the first times I've been pleasantly surprised by a highly rated restaurant. Usually, I leave slightly deflated, feeling a sucker  for having bought into the hype of yet another twee pretension factory, full of the kind of people who take photos of every dish and carefully smell all their food before ingesting it by leaning theatrically over the dish and waving their hands like a fan. In fact, let's talk about this habit for a moment before continuing along with the review. I've always thought that to the extent food smells good, it has to smell good in the fleeting seconds it wanders beneath your nose on its way to you mouth.  To assiduously and intentionally  smell all dishes, as if smelling them was some sort of prelude to tasting,  seems to be miss the point.  Anyway, if you do insist on smelling your food before eating it, don't loudly pronounce everything to be ""aromatic"". Ok, all that said, Dover really is pretty good. First, a note about my welcome. I looked most ridiculous. Unshaven, tired, with taped together glasses (my son had broken them), wearing a reebok sweatshirt with a big stain on it.  No one blinked an eye. I got great and cheerful service. The food matched the welcome, mostly.  Great amuse - a tiny gougere filled with sauce mornay, and then a terrific apple celeriac soup. I had a particular soft spot for the cauliflower salad, which was a combination of fried and raw cauliflower, pistachios, raisins and greens sitting in a slightly spicy preserved oil sauce. If the fried vegetables had been not as brown it would have been a perfect dish.   But I also really enjoyed the broad beans, octopus and chorizo second course.   The tomato sauce and giant beans screamed Greek, as did the perfect octopus, but I support the spicy chorizo said Spain in reality. It was good enough that my excellent Thai inflected main, sous vided lamb ribs with peanuts and mint, was a bit of a letdown. One more thing: the black strap rum cocktail is excellent. Right up my alley.",4.0

"I'm not sure about you, but I always take Yelp reviews with a grain of salt. When I read the reviews of Dover while selecting it for my birthday dinner, I thought ""well, atmosphere isn't a huge deal for great food and great food is pricey"".

Dover was none of these things. There are a lot of really great restaurants in my hood right now: French Louie, La Vara, Brucie, Bergen Hill and Colonie- all of which I happily visit over and over. I won't be going back to Dover. Side note: Two people in my party ordered the pork with peaches and both woke up at 3 am sick. I didn't want to make that the highlight of the review - however it's something to be noted, especially as the staff at Dover didn't do anything by way of apology.

"KenScale: 8.5/10Dover is the second restaurant from the due of Walker Stern and Joseph Ogrodnek who have garnered critical acclaims for their tiny restaurant Battersby. I visited Battersby last year, and loved most of the dishes that the restaurant served, and couldn't wait to try Dover. While I think there were some misses (perhaps because I went a la carte this time instead of doing a tasting menu at Battersby that probably has more consistency across the board), I've had some really spectacular dishes so I'm willing to give Dover the same score I gave to Battersby. I started the dinner with a couple of raw oysters with apple and horseradish, a light touch that was pleasant to my palate. For starters, I tried cauliflower with raisins, pistachios and colatura and squid ink tagliatelle with peekytoe crab, lemon and preserved chili. I thought both dishes were a bit too salty (was particularly disappointed with the tagliatelle which could've been really outstanding had it been dressed down), alhtough the crunchy texture of pistachios and the citrusy broth underneath somewhat saved the cauliflower. I did love the larger meals so much better. Lobster was cooked perfectly and worked very well with tomato confit and spinach, but the dish that I was absolutely crazy about was the lamb ribs with eggplant, peanuts and mint. The ribs were incredibly tender and worked very well with the silky texture of eggplant (which tells a lot since I'm not particularly a huge fan of eggplant). I think it is definitely one of the best lamb dishes I've had in a while. For dessert, I had sweet tea creme brulee and baked Alaska with green apple sorbet. While I was not as impressed with the creme brulee, I was totally blown away by the baked Alaska. The normal baked Alaska dish might've been a bit too sweet for my taste, but the green apple sorbet hidden underneath gave an incredible complexity to the flavor that softened the sweetness and instead turned the dish into a winner. I would come back to the restaurant just for this alone!Unlike Battersby, which doesn't seat more than 30 people counting the bar area, Dover was certainly a lot bigger. While that cozy charm was somewhat missing, I still liked the neighborhood spot vibe of the restaurant. I visited for an early Sunday dinner (I do recommend getting a reservation in advance, although the restaurant seems to set aside some tables for walk-ins), and the scene was still relatively tame (which was surprising given how crowded Battersby was from the very moment it opened its door), but by the time I got out, the restaurant was close to fully packed. The restaurant has a full bar, and I do recommend trying a cocktail or two. Dover epitomizes the kind of fine dining institution that Brooklyn represents, a casual looking restaurant that nevertheless produces some high-qualify dishes with exquisite techniques that you normally associate with more fancy places in Manhattan. I highly recommend a visit to this place to see where Brooklyn is in the culinary pecking order of New York City.",4.0
"I don't cross the bridge to BK often. When I do, I come for good food. This time, Dover, the sister restaurant of Battersby. To sum up in one sentence: the food is EMP quality but for half the price.Me and my friend were planning to go Battersby on a Tue night around 9pm. The wait time would be 45 min. So we decided to check out Dover, which was 2 blocks away and just open couple days ago, before we came back to Battersby. Dover is located on Court st. with much bigger space than Battersby, big windows and tables can comfortably sit party of 6. While Battersby was completely packed, Dover was quite empty the time we were there - the restaurant was still less than 1 week old, not surprising. We sat at the bar and ordering drinks since we were going back to Battersby later. From the window where one can peak inside the kitchen, we spotted Walker Stern, one of the chefs and owner of Battersby and Dover. Well, we stayed where the chef was :)The menu was similar to Battersby (per my friend who has been couple times; I have not) but not exactly the same and more concise.  We skipped the tasting menu and making out own tasting instead. Starter: Maine sea urchin, soba, ginger, chili. This was very refreshing. The ginger zest, the spicy kick from chili flakes and the creamy sea urchin perfectly blend together; and the soba was the perfect vehicle to soak up creamy sauce. We enjoyed this dish alot and would return just for this dish.First course: Endive salad and spaghetti Nero. I not a fan of endive but I like this one - light butter dressing with farro and lentils. Healthy and yummy! The spaghetti, oh the spaghetti! It was nothing like I have had elsewhere - crunchy crab meat and fried garlic provided excellent contrast to the spaghetti; the meyer  lemon lent a subtle citrus aroma to the pasta. Very different from most of the pasta dish I have tried, this one is light, refreshing yet packed of flavor. Outstanding!Second course (you can order full size or half; we got two half size): Chatham cod and lobster. The cod was perfectly cooked, soft and juicy; smoked bacon crumbs and cabbage and brussel sprouts; final touch was the beet juice pouring on top. White fish, green veggies and red juice - beautiful presentation.The lobster was simply grilled,paired with tomato confit, creamy spinach. Again, light but flavorful. Entree: we got the lamb ribs. OMG, this is the best lamb ribs I have ever had in the city. It was a fusion dish (Japanese & Moroccan?): the seasoning was sweet miso, with eggplant, mint, peanuts.  The lamb must have been grilled (?) for a long time as the meat were very easily peeled of the bone with a fork. And the bones were semi-soft and you can even sucked out the little bit marrow in it.  the eggplant was the true star of this dish - it soaked up the lamb juice, miso and mint flavor like a little sponge. Oh, I almost forgot the dessert. We had the pistachio, chocolate mouse and the pecan financier. Both are excellent. Not too sweet, just the way I like my dessert. Perfect to go with the french press I got. Without doubt, I had a. No, multiple foodgasm through out the dinner. And our bar tender had never let our wine/water glass empty. The cocktails were also excellent -  I love my french 75. Wine list is concise but well curated. we had a bottle of Italian white, a glass of shiraz and cab to pair with the lamb. Last but not least. Since we were the last customers left, we got a chance to chat with Walker stern, the chef. A brilliant young chef with a very down to earth personality and humble. We had a good meal and we had a handshake with the chef. And of course, we already made plan to come back next week.",4.0

3 1/2 *s.  Fine dining in Brooklyn.......almost.  High quality meal (tomato salad was nothing special but everything else we had was up there).  Had the lamb main which was cooked the way I like it and delicious.  Nice amuse Bouche and all the little things that make the meal and experience special.  Waitress could have been better - she forgot my red wine to go with my main and when I planned to cancel it and was almost done with lamb she brought it over (extremely late) - that was disappointing and ruined the evening/meal a bit.   Would give this place another shot but not rushing back anytime soon.,3.0
"A little expensive (although, look at the location) but generally very very good. Came with a coworker and had a really good meal.I started with the lamb tartare - lamb mixed with fresh mint, lemon juice, and olives, served with more olives and plain greek yogurt, all with grilled pita bread. So good. The pita were even a cut above the norm (but obviously not Naf Naf caliber). The lamb was flavorful and the fresh mint really set things off. I could have eaten a lot of this. Next for me was the octopus. Good, firm but not too chewy, with nice grilled flavor and served with some thinly sliced chorizo and nice soft cooked white beans. An excellent combination. Specifically, the beans were great with the octopus. And my entree was the hanger steak with oxtail reduction - an incredibly rich, flavorful sauce, all on top of pureed potatoes. The steak was medium rare, and though it wasn't melt in your mouth tender, this cut isn't going to be like that. Really good. They also had stuff on the menu like the ""cavair pie"" which sounded incredibly decadent, and some other really good looking seafood items. Too bad we couldn't try more. Service was attentive without being snooty - they were apologetic about a police car outside doing it's darndest to give everyone in the restaurant epilepsy - it was annoying, but not their fault. I doubt I'll be back in the area again, but this is worth a visit if you're looking for something upscale.",4.0

"My dinner at Dover was one of the first times I've been pleasantly surprised by a highly rated restaurant. Usually, I leave slightly deflated, feeling a sucker  for having bought into the hype of yet another twee pretension factory, full of the kind of people who take photos of every dish and carefully smell all their food before ingesting it by leaning theatrically over the dish and waving their hands like a fan. In fact, let's talk about this habit for a moment before continuing along with the review. I've always thought that to the extent food smells good, it has to smell good in the fleeting seconds it wanders beneath your nose on its way to you mouth.  To assiduously and intentionally  smell all dishes, as if smelling them was some sort of prelude to tasting,  seems to be miss the point.  Anyway, if you do insist on smelling your food before eating it, don't loudly pronounce everything to be ""aromatic"". Ok, all that said, Dover really is pretty good. First, a note about my welcome. I looked most ridiculous. Unshaven, tired, with taped together glasses (my son had broken them), wearing a reebok sweatshirt with a big stain on it.  No one blinked an eye. I got great and cheerful service. The food matched the welcome, mostly.  Great amuse - a tiny gougere filled with sauce mornay, and then a terrific apple celeriac soup. I had a particular soft spot for the cauliflower salad, which was a combination of fried and raw cauliflower, pistachios, raisins and greens sitting in a slightly spicy preserved oil sauce.

"Wow, how can this place in any way be related to excellent Battersby?!?!  In all honesty Dover only deserves 1 star but based on the polar opposite experience of Battersby, will give benefit of doubt that maybe everyone quit right before we got there and it was all new temporary staff they stole from CVS across the street. ATMOSPHERE: 1 starWith the cheapest generic Home Depot tiles and Pizza Hut chairs, this place feels like the lobby of a bad condo development or one of the may budget hotels going up on 3rd avenue.  Unlike Battersby and pretty much any other restaurant in the neighborhood, it has absolutely no atmosphere or design sense/charm...it is just this generic harsh room.  I am not saying it needs to copy the Brooklyn theme look with Edison bulbs everywhere, but at least make some statement/effort.  To top it all off they have crappy speakers blasting a Spotify mix of every current Brooklyn band, which I would have no problem with, except the poor tin like sound quality combined with all hard surfaces turns the space into a miserable echo chamber.SERVICE: 0 starsWe purposely took an early reservation (5:30) as we hate being sardined into a restaurant.  When making reservation (4 weeks earlier) and arriving we noted it was our 14th anniversary and that we weren't looking for any special treatment but would appreciate a quiet table.  When we get there, there is literally 1 other couple in the place and when they went to seat us right next to them we asked if maybe we could sit in one of the other 15 empty tables and they curtly said no and that they were fully booked for the evening (they offered to seat us outside but it was well over 90 degrees out and extremely humid).  The other couple had to get up in order for us to sit down.  10 minutes later after no server arrived a different hostess came over and offered to move us which we agreed to and thanked her for even though it was wedged in the corner by the server station.  At this point we were one of 3 tables.  When our waitress arrived, we mentioned we may want to do the tasting menu and asked if she could describe it and her description was so lackluster and unenergetic that we decided just to order from the menu (food review below) along with a bottle of wine.  Just as we were giving toast the hostess seated this very  loud couple right next to us.  Yes, boohoo, this is New York and you can't expect private dining but 90% of remaining tables were still empty.  Combating the loud couple were the very loud crappy speakers described above and the clanking of the plates and constant talking of the wait staff to one another inches from our table.  To top it all off, our waitress never once came back during the 1.5 hours we were there to ask or see how the food was.  Not one check in from ordering to the time we got the check. I am kicking myself for not telling this to the hostess, but I was trying not to bring down our anniversary any more than this whole dining experience had already done.  By the way, when we left 1.5 hours later, 80 percent of the tables were empty so there was absolutely no reason to sardine us in, in such a big space (it is not like Battersby where you have no other option).FOOD: 2.5 starsI can ignore bad atmosphere and service if the food is stellar, which at first seemed like it might be when the chilled gazpacho amuse bouche arrived and a truly phenomenal  bread basket.  We were off to a great start.  We started with the octopus and duck ragu which were both pretty good but nothing to blow you away.  Then came the main dishes of striped bass and cod.  Both were extremely bland and overcooked.  We never send things back, but had the waitress ever reappeared we would have mentioned this to her.  Both dishes seemed like they had been microwaved and were just completely forgettable.  We had already decided to skip dessert, but even if we wanted dessert the list of options of was so non-enticing....parfait anyone? So as much as it pains me to say it, based on our experience, I wouldn't recommend Dover to anyone.  There are literally dozens of far superior restaurants in this great neighborhood (including Battersby) and in fact this whole experience forced us to redo our anniversary a week later at Grocery (where we should have just gone in the first place).....what an incredible difference...the staff is incredibly attentive and friendly (and seems to want to be there) and both the owners took the time to stop by and talk to us.  We hadn't been in years, and were pleasantly surprised that this neighborhood classic has improved with age.  I will follow-up with that review soon.",2.0
"Lackluster, which was sad since I had enjoyed Battersby so much. Seated 35 minutes late with a 9:00 pm reservation. Somewhat gruff tone from bartender while we waited for table. Unimpressive meals across the board (crab ceviche that was somewhat over-sweetened; coconut shrimp soup tasted like an ordinary tom kha at a hole-in-the-wall Thai joint-- and only two puny shrimp(!); a lamb papardelle with tomato ragu that lacked depth; a beef dish with kale chips that was totally drenched in Thai fish sauce). Dishes seemed like they were aiming for something interesting but flavoring and preparation was generally heavy-handed and seemed ""trendy"" more than anything else. Waiter was nice, as was the space, but definitely wouldn't pay this much again for food that didn't taste that good.",2.0
"Made the mistake, I guess, of spending a bunch of money to have the tasting menu. It was a special occasion. The food was all pretty bla, then it started getting bad (big hunks of inedibly chewy duck), all garnished with increasingly large, aggressive, and it seemed lost pieces of various herbs. (On one dish mint, Thai basil, cilantro, and parsley.) We were then given several dessert items, including two what were termed ""thumbprint"" cookies--misshapen items the size of a button that were soggy. Eating this meal, watching the manager rush about the floor and try to bus tables and swoop in to open our bottle of wine, tearing through the foil, making no attempt at talking to us about it or anything (we asked for a wine to pair with this special meal, and I was bummed that the server then recommended the first thing on the list), the fact that a runner not our server told us what we were eating, the fact that she seemed completely out of her depth, the fact that no one seemed to notice or care when we weren't exactly enjoying this meal-- all lead me to believe this is a restaurant that is either failing already or will fail, and for now it'll continue to suck money off of suckers like us I guess.",2.0
"We came here at the beginning of the summer, had the tasting menu and were blown away. We have been thinking about it all summer long and just went back for round 2 with our parents the night before the wedding. Fortunatly it was amazing again! Im sure the individual entrees are nice but you are doing yourself a disservice if you don't get the tasting menu. It starts off light and delicious then gets more complex, interesting, and rich as the courses progress. Come hungry, experience a litany of amazing dishes, leave full and very very happy! It isn't cheap but $95 for around 8 courses is well worth it in my book. The venue itself is clean, simple, and unpretentious. The staff are helpful, friendly, appear when needed, and fade away when you are all set. It gets my highest recommendation, go with friends, and enjoy!",5.0
"I can see why my fellow Elites have given 4 or 5 stars. What better way than to spend an anniversary celebration at Dover?  First, I think the SERVICE is FANTASTIC!  Knowledgeable in recommending dishes including wine selection on their menu.  You can tell Dover has trained their staff well to make sure they've tried the food and drinks themselves in order to provide recommendations to their diners.Second, although I have never been, this place is the same owner as Battersby. Third, the menu changes regularly depending where they can get fresh ingredients. Here's an opinion on my recent experience on 8/5.- Complimentary BREAD - oh man, we had two servings and loved the homemade white bean dip with olive tapenade - Oysters - so fresh and so clean.  I've never had BROILED OYSTERS with ramp butter and I'm glad I did. Packed with so much flavor all in one bite - smokey, bacon bits and ever so lightly heated in the oven for a couple of seconds to give it a warmth plump texture- Heirloom Tomato - creamiest BURRATA, garden-picked basil and herb dressing- RABBIT Tartine - it was their appetizer special of the day and in pate form. three letters, O.M.G.- LOBSTER (half order) - cooked to perfection, a MUST.Now, I don't know if it's because we drank 2 bottles of wine or I was full from the bread and appetizers but the reason why I gave it 4 vs. 5 stars is because the third course missed the mark for me.  We got the...- Wild Stripped Bass - I think the creamy sauce clouded the simplicity of the fish- Lamb Ribs - pretty good but a tad bit salty however, the eggplant was meaty, seasoned and cook al dente.This is another spot that will be hard to get a reservation soon to come.  I would definitely come back here again.",4.0

Personally, I think this was WAY better than Buttermilk. I've never been for dinner, so I can't comment on that, but I really wanna go. Anyway, I've basically tried everything and it's honestly ALL so good. But here are my favorites, in order:1. French toast: It's out of this world. It's somewhere between challah french toast and creme brulee. I don't know how, but it is.2. Ruby Red Shrimp Étouffée: Grits topped with shrimp in some sort of magic sauce with sausage (I think) and chicken. The chicken pieces are basically the best parts of a roast chicken- super tender and delish. Highly recommended. 3. Sausage gravy and biscuits: Done to perfection.The only sub-par item is the Irish Breakfast. Full disclosure... my parents are from Ireland and I eat a real Irish breakfast on the regular, so I'm hard to please. Their Irish Breakfast tasted OK, but it was not a real Irish breakfast. Although the white and black pudding were almost like the Irish kind, there was nothing Irish at all about the sausage. I have faith that they can fix this. I'm happy to consult. haha",5.0
"Wow, how can this place in any way be related to excellent Battersby?!?!  In all honesty Dover only deserves 1 star but based on the polar opposite experience of Battersby, will give benefit of doubt that maybe everyone quit right before we got there and it was all new temporary staff they stole from CVS across the street. ATMOSPHERE: 1 starWith the cheapest generic Home Depot tiles and Pizza Hut chairs, this place feels like the lobby of a bad condo development or one of the may budget hotels going up on 3rd avenue.  Unlike Battersby and pretty much any other restaurant in the neighborhood, it has absolutely no atmosphere or design sense/charm...it is just this generic harsh room.  I am not saying it needs to copy the Brooklyn theme look with Edison bulbs everywhere, but at least make some statement/effort.  To top it all off they have crappy speakers blasting a Spotify mix of every current Brooklyn band, which I would have no problem with, except the poor tin like sound quality combined with all hard surfaces turns the space into a miserable echo chamber.SERVICE: 0 starsWe purposely took an early reservation (5:30) as we hate being sardined into a restaurant.  When making reservation (4 weeks earlier) and arriving we noted it was our 14th anniversary and that we weren't looking for any special treatment but would appreciate a quiet table.  When we get there, there is literally 1 other couple in the place and when they went to seat us right next to them we asked if maybe we could sit in one of the other 15 empty tables and they curtly said no and that they were fully booked for the evening (they offered to seat us outside but it was well over 90 degrees out and extremely humid).  The other couple had to get up in order for us to sit down.  10 minutes later after no server arrived a different hostess came over and offered to move us which we agreed to and thanked her for even though it was wedged in the corner by the server station.  At this point we were one of 3 tables.  When our waitress arrived, we mentioned we may want to do the tasting menu and asked if she could describe it and her description was so lackluster and unenergetic that we decided just to order from the menu (food review below) along with a bottle of wine.  Just as we were giving toast the hostess seated this very  loud couple right next to us.  Yes, boohoo, this is New York and you can't expect private dining but 90% of remaining tables were still empty.  Combating the loud couple were the very loud crappy speakers described above and the clanking of the plates and constant talking of the wait staff to one another inches from our table.  To top it all off, our waitress never once came back during the 1.5 hours we were there to ask or see how the food was.  Not one check in from ordering to the time we got the check. I am kicking myself for not telling this to the hostess, but I was trying not to bring down our anniversary any more than this whole dining experience had already done.  By the way, when we left 1.5 hours later, 80 percent of the tables were empty so there was absolutely no reason to sardine us in, in such a big space (it is not like Battersby where you have no other option).FOOD: 2.5 starsI can ignore bad atmosphere and service if the food is stellar, which at first seemed like it might be when the chilled gazpacho amuse bouche arrived and a truly phenomenal  bread basket.  We were off to a great start.  We started with the octopus and duck ragu which were both pretty good but nothing to blow you away.  Then came the main dishes of striped bass and cod.  Both were extremely bland and overcooked.  We never send things back, but had the waitress ever reappeared we would have mentioned this to her.  Both dishes seemed like they had been microwaved and were just completely forgettable.  We had already decided to skip dessert, but even if we wanted dessert the list of options of was so non-enticing....parfait anyone? So as much as it pains me to say it, based on our experience, I wouldn't recommend Dover to anyone.  There are literally dozens of far superior restaurants in this great neighborhood (including Battersby) and in fact this whole experience forced us to redo our anniversary a week later at Grocery (where we should have just gone in the first place).....what an incredible difference...the staff is incredibly attentive and friendly (and seems to want to be there) and both the owners took the time to stop by and talk to us.  We hadn't been in years, and were pleasantly surprised that this neighborhood classic has improved with age.  I will follow-up with that review soon.",2.0
"Lackluster, which was sad since I had enjoyed Battersby so much. Seated 35 minutes late with a 9:00 pm reservation. Somewhat gruff tone from bartender while we waited for table. Unimpressive meals across the board (crab ceviche that was somewhat over-sweetened; coconut shrimp soup tasted like an ordinary tom kha at a hole-in-the-wall Thai joint-- and only two puny shrimp(!); a lamb papardelle with tomato ragu that lacked depth; a beef dish with kale chips that was totally drenched in Thai fish sauce). Dishes seemed like they were aiming for something interesting but flavoring and preparation was generally heavy-handed and seemed ""trendy"" more than anything else. Waiter was nice, as was the space, but definitely wouldn't pay this much again for food that didn't taste that good.",2.0
"Made the mistake, I guess, of spending a bunch of money to have the tasting menu. It was a special occasion. The food was all pretty bla, then it started getting bad (big hunks of inedibly chewy duck), all garnished with increasingly large, aggressive, and it seemed lost pieces of various herbs. (On one dish mint, Thai basil, cilantro, and parsley.) We were then given several dessert items, including two what were termed ""thumbprint"" cookies--misshapen items the size of a button that were soggy. Eating this meal, watching the manager rush about the floor and try to bus tables and swoop in to open our bottle of wine, tearing through the foil, making no attempt at talking to us about it or anything (we asked for a wine to pair with this special meal, and I was bummed that the server then recommended the first thing on the list), the fact that a runner not our server told us what we were eating, the fact that she seemed completely out of her depth, the fact that no one seemed to notice or care when we weren't exactly enjoying this meal-- all lead me to believe this is a restaurant that is either failing already or will fail, and for now it'll continue to suck money off of suckers like us I guess.",2.0
"We came here at the beginning of the summer, had the tasting menu and were blown away. We have been thinking about it all summer long and just went back for round 2 with our parents the night before the wedding. Fortunatly it was amazing again! Im sure the individual entrees are nice but you are doing yourself a disservice if you don't get the tasting menu. It starts off light and delicious then gets more complex, interesting, and rich as the courses progress. Come hungry, experience a litany of amazing dishes, leave full and very very happy! It isn't cheap but $95 for around 8 courses is well worth it in my book. The venue itself is clean, simple, and unpretentious. The staff are helpful, friendly, appear when needed, and fade away when you are all set. It gets my highest recommendation, go with friends, and enjoy!",5.0
"I can see why my fellow Elites have given 4 or 5 stars. What better way than to spend an anniversary celebration at Dover?  First, I think the SERVICE is FANTASTIC!  Knowledgeable in recommending dishes including wine selection on their menu.  You can tell Dover has trained their staff well to make sure they've tried the food and drinks themselves in order to provide recommendations to their diners.Second, although I have never been, this place is the same owner as Battersby. Third, the menu changes regularly depending where they can get fresh ingredients. Here's an opinion on my recent experience on 8/5.- Complimentary BREAD - oh man, we had two servings and loved the homemade white bean dip with olive tapenade - Oysters - so fresh and so clean.  I've never had BROILED OYSTERS with ramp butter and I'm glad I did. Packed with so much flavor all in one bite - smokey, bacon bits and ever so lightly heated in the oven for a couple of seconds to give it a warmth plump texture- Heirloom Tomato - creamiest BURRATA, garden-picked basil and herb dressing- RABBIT Tartine - it was their appetizer special of the day and in pate form. three letters, O.M.G.- LOBSTER (half order) - cooked to perfection, a MUST.Now, I don't know if it's because we drank 2 bottles of wine or I was full from the bread and appetizers but the reason why I gave it 4 vs. 5 stars is because the third course missed the mark for me.  We got the...- Wild Stripped Bass - I think the creamy sauce clouded the simplicity of the fish- Lamb Ribs - pretty good but a tad bit salty however, the eggplant was meaty, seasoned and cook al dente.This is another spot that will be hard to get a reservation soon to come.  I would definitely come back here again.",4.0

Great spot that we hit up instead of Buttermilk Chanel because we wanted to stay a bit more healthy. We failed at being healthy but the food was awesome.

"Dover has the feel of a neighborhood restaurant - a very sophisticated one, for sure, but as inviting and welcoming as I always imagine the ideal neighborhood restaurant to be.  Even though our reservation was for a rather early hour, the restaurant already exuded a lively, excited atmosphere. Lingering over some interesting-sounding (and tasting) cocktails, we opted to order a la carte.  The hamachi appetizer was good but hamachi, as tatar, ceviche, in whatever form, has become a restaurant cliché, so it is hard to get excited even over a lovely version.  The oysters with choron sauce were really good, so much that I wished I had ordered them without the strong sauce and just enjoyed their briny excellence.  Squid Ink Tagliatelle with peekytoe crab was the star of the evening, beautifully cooked home made pasta, studded with sweet crab and nestling in a pool of Meyer lemon enhanced sauce.  It made for addictive eating.  We also loved the Octopus with butter beans, chorizo and Piquillo pepper.  The nicely charred pieces of octopus went beautifully with the rich beans, the very sweet pepper, and the spicy sausage.  A winner.  The same can be said of the broiled lobster with a small dish of delectable spinach.  The mackerel with broccoli de Cicco greens and chestnut pieces was another full-flavored, tasty dish, a bit on the heavy side, as is the case with a few of the offerings.  Because of that, we only managed one dessert, a ""deconstructed"" vacherin with two different ice creams.  Very good.I give the food 4.5 stars but factoring in the attentive and friendly service and the fun and homey atmosphere, it is an overall 5!",5.0
"Dover disappoints if you are gluten-free or have allergies!Went to Dover for a special romantic birthday dinner and were very disappointed. I'd mentioned that my partner was gluten-free and that we were celebrating a birthday in making the reservation, and mentioned both again when confirming by phone, and both of these pieces of information were neglected. We told our server at the beginning of the meal, and he seemed to not have a clear understanding of what gluten intolerance/allergy was. He repeatedly brought amuse bouche to my partner that contained gluten. They brought us spreads with bread that he couldn't eat, and when we asked for a substitute that took about 30 minutes to bring vegetables so that we were done with that course by the time they brought them out. We continually asked if foods brought to us were gluten free because one of us had an allergy and got an oddly chipper 'Has gluten!' from the woman bringing them, without apology. Worse of all, they assured us that the chicken for two dish was gluten-free, and when it arrived, the vegetables were dripping in a flour based bechamel sauce, which they confirmed did contain gluten. Our server apologized and said that the kitchen told him it was gluten free. THIS COULD HAVE KILLED SOMEONE. In apology they didn't charge for one glass of wine- but didn't take the $68 dish off the meal that my partner could not eat. After all that, they forgot we were celebrating a birthday and never mentioned it. Overall, they are making efforts at seeming elegant with amuse bouche, but have not caught up with service and attention to detail. They are located in the center of foodie culture, but perhaps think being gluten-free is a fad they can snub rather than a real food allergy. If you have any dietary restrictions or allergies whatsoever, do not trust them to respect, and don't expect service or attention reflecting the prices here.",1.0
"Dover is a great addition to the neighborhood. As someone who has yet to get into Battersby, I was super excited to try this place. I went with my good pal Rich B. and our lovely wives. TLDR? Food great, space nice, service good.First impressions were very nice, the space is roomy. The table layout is a bit strange, but that's due to the floor plan, and I'm not going to complain about a lot of room between me and my fellow diners. The sound level was nice, even when the place was full it wasn't too loud. The food was excellent. My friends who'd been to Battersby say it's not quite on par with the oringinal, but I can't judge them by that standard myself. We had the hamachi, cauliflower, and sea urchin appetizers. The cauliflower was the clear winner in my mind. Really yummy. For mains we had the steak, duck, lamb ribs, and the cod. Everyone said the food was excellent. The only complaint that I heard was that the portion size on the cod was small. (which frankly is a compliment) I'm the boring one who got the steak, and it was perfect, if a bit more than I was prepared to eat. Desert? Chocolate mousse (terrific toasted marshmallow topping) and a pecan and caramel confection. Both voted yum+The service was a bit over attentive, but the restaurant has been open for 2 weeks or so. Not going to ding them on that today. Definitely great to have a new place if this caliber around!",4.0

My favorite was the pasta and the octopus but my husband loved the Lobster and Cauliflower.  For dessert we had the ambrosia panna cotta and ended with a few complimentary cookies.  This was definitely one of the top meals we've had in a very long time and we EAT out ALOT at all of NY's hotspots.  I would be surprised if they don't get a Michelin Star!",5.0
"I love this place. The service is warm and attentive, and the little extras like the amouse bouche and the beautiful breads with labne and hummus are amazing. Every dish I've tried (the lobster, the cauliflower starter, and the butternut squash pasta) has been sensational. Love it.",5.0
"I live in the neighborhood and have walked by Dover since it opened up. Having been away from Brooklyn for a while, I wandered in the other night for a quick solo meal at the bar. Perhaps the table experience is different, but the bar experience was quite awkward. The bar itself wasn't super welcoming, and the bartender was not overly friendly or chatty and seemingly occupied with numerous other things. It was nice to be able to peek into the kitchen though. I had a cocktail and the market greens salad. They were tasty if not a bit expensive for what they were (a tbsp of quinoa, and white mushrooms on a $14 salad).",3.0
"Great food, smart staff and amazing wines and cocktails. Yes it's expensive for Brooklyn but I hope this place lasts.",4.0
"Dover has the feel of a neighborhood restaurant - a very sophisticated one, for sure, but as inviting and welcoming as I always imagine the ideal neighborhood restaurant to be.  Even though our reservation was for a rather early hour, the restaurant already exuded a lively, excited atmosphere. Lingering over some interesting-sounding (and tasting) cocktails, we opted to order a la carte.  The hamachi appetizer was good but hamachi, as tatar, ceviche, in whatever form, has become a restaurant cliché, so it is hard to get excited even over a lovely version.  The oysters with choron sauce were really good, so much that I wished I had ordered them without the strong sauce and just enjoyed their briny excellence.  Squid Ink Tagliatelle with peekytoe crab was the star of the evening, beautifully cooked home made pasta, studded with sweet crab and nestling in a pool of Meyer lemon enhanced sauce.  It made for addictive eating.  We also loved the Octopus with butter beans, chorizo and Piquillo pepper.  The nicely charred pieces of octopus went beautifully with the rich beans, the very sweet pepper, and the spicy sausage.  A winner.  The same can be said of the broiled lobster with a small dish of delectable spinach.  The mackerel with broccoli de Cicco greens and chestnut pieces was another full-flavored, tasty dish, a bit on the heavy side, as is the case with a few of the offerings.  Because of that, we only managed one dessert, a ""deconstructed"" vacherin with two different ice creams.  Very good.I give the food 4.5 stars but factoring in the attentive and friendly service and the fun and homey atmosphere, it is an overall 5!",5.0
"Dover disappoints if you are gluten-free or have allergies!Went to Dover for a special romantic birthday dinner and were very disappointed. I'd mentioned that my partner was gluten-free and that we were celebrating a birthday in making the reservation, and mentioned both again when confirming by phone, and both of these pieces of information were neglected. We told our server at the beginning of the meal, and he seemed to not have a clear understanding of what gluten intolerance/allergy was. He repeatedly brought amuse bouche to my partner that contained gluten. They brought us spreads with bread that he couldn't eat, and when we asked for a substitute that took about 30 minutes to bring vegetables so that we were done with that course by the time they brought them out. We continually asked if foods brought to us were gluten free because one of us had an allergy and got an oddly chipper 'Has gluten!' from the woman bringing them, without apology. Worse of all, they assured us that the chicken for two dish was gluten-free, and when it arrived, the vegetables were dripping in a flour based bechamel sauce, which they confirmed did contain gluten. Our server apologized and said that the kitchen told him it was gluten free. THIS COULD HAVE KILLED SOMEONE. In apology they didn't charge for one glass of wine- but didn't take the $68 dish off the meal that my partner could not eat. After all that, they forgot we were celebrating a birthday and never mentioned it. Overall, they are making efforts at seeming elegant with amuse bouche, but have not caught up with service and attention to detail. They are located in the center of foodie culture, but perhaps think being gluten-free is a fad they can snub rather than a real food allergy. If you have any dietary restrictions or allergies whatsoever, do not trust them to respect, and don't expect service or attention reflecting the prices here.",1.0
"Dover is a great addition to the neighborhood. As someone who has yet to get into Battersby, I was super excited to try this place. I went with my good pal Rich B. and our lovely wives. TLDR? Food great, space nice, service good.First impressions were very nice, the space is roomy. The table layout is a bit strange, but that's due to the floor plan, and I'm not going to complain about a lot of room between me and my fellow diners. The sound level was nice, even when the place was full it wasn't too loud. The food was excellent. My friends who'd been to Battersby say it's not quite on par with the oringinal, but I can't judge them by that standard myself. We had the hamachi, cauliflower, and sea urchin appetizers. The cauliflower was the clear winner in my mind. Really yummy. For mains we had the steak, duck, lamb ribs, and the cod. Everyone said the food was excellent. The only complaint that I heard was that the portion size on the cod was small. (which frankly is a compliment) I'm the boring one who got the steak, and it was perfect, if a bit more than I was prepared to eat. Desert? Chocolate mousse (terrific toasted marshmallow topping) and a pecan and caramel confection. Both voted yum+The service was a bit over attentive, but the restaurant has been open for 2 weeks or so. Not going to ding them on that today. Definitely great to have a new place if this caliber around!",4.0
"We live across the street so we decided to give it a try.  Pretty pricey. Example - their tasting ,menu was $90.  The servers were all great, polite without being snobby, which is particularly appreciated considering the neighborhood.  my pet peeve is being in a fancy restaurant and having servers trained to treat customers like gods/goddesses.anyways, ambience wise, it was dimly lit, but not overly dim/dark.  the set-up of the tables was not my favorite.  it lacked a feeling of privacy, because the majority of the tables are just sprinkled throughout a large empty space.  i could almost completely hear the conversation of the table next to us.the regular menu is broken into 4 sections.  they are small dishes so its recommended to order 2-3 per person.  me and my date ordered a dish of endive, a cauliflower dish, a dish of scallops, and a dish of cod.  we topped it off with an AMAZING piece of banana cream pie.  oh man, that pie was something else.  tacky as it might be, i will probably see if i can just order the dessert to go. we left satisfied - definitely not overly full, but thats an american norm anyways - expect to and to eat like gluttons. i dont drink alcohol so our bill wasnt as high as it likely would be for drinkers.  $120 bill for the aforestated,  all of the food was excellent and very innovative.  however, if you are a picky eater, definitely look at the menu before committing.  there arent any ""typical"" or ""usual"" items.  downer for a post dinner treat for me is that they ONLY have french press coffee.  i love a good cappucino after my meal.  and as for the french press, it was only available with whole milk and ""regular"" sugar. i can see why a person would like this place more than i do, but i definitely wont be going back.  mostly because despite the professionalism of the servers, it had a stuffy energy, and i personally prioritize that highly.  id give the food a 4.5, but overall just a 3 for me.",3.0
"Went to Dover last night for dinner with my brother and two friends. We had an 8:30pm reservation, and were seated right away in the middle of the restaurant, which was fun because you could see everything that was happening. The waitstaff is still getting themselves used to everything, which is kind of obvious, but they do a great job nonetheless. The food was really great! A couple of amuse bouches, including an amazing root vegetable soup that I wanted to swim in. The loaf of bread with fresh ricotta was also a great way to start. We got brought two bread plates for the four of us, which was more than sufficient, but we tore through them. Then after they had cleared them away, a waiter accidentally brought us a third. I tried to tell them to take it back bc we didn't need it, but then my brother started eating it, so we go tmore bread! Yum! For the meal we ordered a couple of each courses to split amongst ourselves. Started with the hamachi (really delicious) and the caviar pie (amaaaaaaaaaaaaazing, especially on some of that extra bread they brought). Then we had cauliflower (very good, but not my favorite), pork belly (my brother said ti was mediocre), and the squid ink tagliatelle. The tagliatelle was just absolutely phenomenal. I dreamed about it last night and wish I had another bowl right next to me now. I want to go back and order that, a cocktail, and the endive salad once a week for the rest of my life. For the mains we got the lobster (very tasty, but a bit overly salted. Also in my mind lobster is best just boiled with melted butter), duck (my brother gave it a thumbs down), and lamb ribs (people licked the plate clean). I fought for dessert, and of course was right. We got one blackout cake with beet ice cream and everyone was falling over themselves. Wine was good, but I think a bit overpriced. A couple of cheaper bottles would be nice.Overall it was a really great night. I can't wait to go back... although I'll have to let my bank account recover first.",4.0
"We wanted Dover to be good so badly but ended up disappointed. Excellent (but pricey) drinks to begin along with a tasty bread and dip selection -- this was the best part of the meal. Salads were overpriced and bland. Main courses were small and very pricey. The fish was drenched in sauce and completely ruined. Avoid the outdoor garden space - buggy, loud and cramped.",2.0
"Outstanding dinner at Dover! We really loved everything, from the cocktails, to the bread, to the main course. Just like at Battersby we were completely blown away by the vegetables!!! They are just amazing. And a huge treat is the dessert cocktail - we have been twice and got a different dessert cocktail each time and it would a highlight! Who needs the sweets when you can have a dessert cocktail?!Really love the lamb tartar!We can't wait to go back!",5.0
"Sometimes you're in the mood to sit down and feast, to treat yourself and be indulgent. Dover is my suggestion for when one finds themselves in need of epicure pampering. The menu is divided into four (RAW, FIRST, SECOND, THIRD) and our lovely waiter suggested a couple items per person. We were a group of four and immedialtely decided to share everything ordered. The ceviche was probably the best I've ever tasted. Who am I kidding? Everything was phenomenal! There were a number of specials available including a gnocchi and a short rib that I'm still thinking about and salivating.The only dish that stuck out as less than brilliant was the Cassoulet. It was still very good but in comparison to all of the other dishes sampled, it was just that - ""very good"". Interesting (read: good) beer selection and my friends enjoyed their wine as well. The restaurant has very cute light fixtures that reflect trendy yet cozy light patterns on the ceiling and they have my favorite Mrs. Meyers Geranium hand soap in the restroom. Shout out to the staff - a true pleasure: our waiter was very helpful in navigating the menu and also very personable. I'd love to return for another feast the next time I'm in Brooklyn.",5.0
First time dinner here last night-INCREDIBLE is all I can say-great staff and excellent food and service-so glad someone recommended-the menu was varied and all selections were terrific-the wine list is intelligent-found my favorite Austrian wine and the drink selection explosive-we were all so stuffed we couldn't sample the desserts! We have been all over Brooklyn and Manhattan and just think this spot is vastly superior to the tired and trendy spots in Manhattan and  professionally a cut above most in Brooklyn.-I just hope it stays special as we w ill be back soon!

"Being a Battersby fan my husband and I were totally excited to see that Dover took over the ""Vinzees Magic Fountain"" fries and ice-cream joint on the corner of 1st and Court St in Carroll Gardens.Couple things - ignore the fact that the space is pretty devoid of personality, the bistro chairs look like rentals and the ambiance is nothing like the warm welcoming little kitchen restaurant of Battersby. Once you start eating the food and dig into the experience, you will not notice these little things.We sat at the bar - wine list is totally reasonable and the bartender was super nice, attentive and made fabulous recommendations. The type of service where he was on point but never hovering. Because the space doesn't seem ""fancy"" you forget that you are eating at a fine dining restaurant, but you totally are. We ordered ala carte and surprisingly they started us out with a couple amuse bouche - tiny little pastry puffs filled with creamy warm cheese and then an incredible smooth vegetable root soup so delicious I wish I had a big bowl full. Fresh baked bread served 2 dips (white bean and a ricotta with honey) was addicting - which, of course, we ate the entire loaf plus the little fennel crackers in about 5 minutes (I have no restraint).We ordered:Cauliflower SaladTruffle Chicken for 2Cod with brown butter potatoes, capers and tomatoes (Cod Grenobloise) - small portionThe cauliflower salad was fabulous - with raisins, hazelnuts and I swear I detected a little fish sauce in the vinegary sauce to give it a little unami flavor.Yum.Truffle chicken was so amazing - served in 2 ways, first with the a confit style chicken salad (sounds weird but it's probably my description - really delish) and then in a little black Staub pan is the roasted chicken with only the best parts of the chicken perfectly succulent and with crispy skin and served with melty gruyere and truffle potato hash. Oh, did I mentioned all the black truffles? Yes, tons of them and NO not awful truffle oil, the real deal.Cod was perfect - great size. And since I love anything with capers this hit high for me. Fish at Battesby is always cooked to perfection and this too was that. Clearly these guys know what to do with a piece of fish.We skipped dessert - way too full which honestly is fine by me. Just a note - this is not an inexpensive meal but absolutely worth it. Plus, you can probably order things that are a little cheaper and not drink two bottles of wine ;). Enjoy!

from the bread basket to the dessert and everything in between we enjoyed ourselves. the space is open and airy with huge windows that allows for lots of light.  service was friendly and were helpful with ordering although we felt we over ordered based on the waitresses recommendation-that's okay because we enjoyed it all! pastas tasted homemade  and were by far our favorite choices. menu was seasonal  using fresh ingredients and presented beautifully.  We told the host it was a friends birthday and was bummed that the dessert didn't come out with a candle or acknowledgement BUT the confetti cake was such a delicious dessert -tasted completely different then it looked and we were pleasantly surprised !,4.0
"Wow.  I love this place.  The man and I had a reservation at 10pm on Saturday, so we decided to start out the evening with some cocktails at Brooklyn Social, which is conveniently located only a few blocks away.  Once we arrived, we waited only about five minutes for our table. I think we may have been a few early too.  The place was pretty packed, all tables were taken and the small bar was fully occupied.From the moment we arrived through the end of the meal, service was perfect, attentive without the stuffiness.  Every dish was explained in detail when delivered to the table and I never had to refill my own water-bonus points!Now, onto the food...Amazing. We started with two amuse bouches, a goat cheese stuffed ball of love and a root vegetable soup that was to die for.  Next came the homemade bread loaf- yes a loaf for the two of us...I only allowed myself a small taste, but it was perfection-crunchy on the outside and soft on inside, served with two accompaniments-a whipped ricotta and a white bean and olive tapenade. For starters we split the Hamachi and the Pork Belly-we loved them both, we were torn between getting two or three starters (not to mention that everything sounded so good we wanted to try them all!), but splitting two was plenty for us.  For entrees I chose the Scallops with carrots and almonds (I got the half size potion) and he had the Lamb Ribs. Again neither of us was disappointed, in fact we couldn't stop gushing about how flavorful everything was.We didn't get dessert, but with the check came another little treat-two adorable mini shortbread sandwich cookies with a raspberry or strawberry filling (I can't remember exactly what she said they were, but this is my guess).All in all, our experience at Dover was stellar.  The food is simple, clean and beyond flavorful. We will definitely be going back.",5.0
"I got some resistance on not giving this spot 5 stars, but I'm honest in my reviews and the service, slow drink refills don't grant a 5 star rating. I also wasn't blown away by some of the dishes like everyone else. However, some dishes I did find outstanding, for example, cavier pie (best thing I've had in a while), broiled oysters (everyone liked the broiled vs the raw oysters), cauliflower salad, and cod. Other items that were good: tarjarin, lamb tortelini, lobster, and one person especially loved the octopus (i just wasn't a fan of the butter beans, it threw the texture off for me). The lamb ribs were cooked well but were too fatty. My least favorite was the berkshire pork.",4.0

"Really great food.   I followed the yelp reviewers advice and had the cauliflower salad, octopus and half lobster.   Portion size was just right.

from the bread basket to the dessert and everything in between we enjoyed ourselves. the space is open and airy with huge windows that allows for lots of light.  service was friendly and were helpful with ordering although we felt we over ordered based on the waitresses recommendation-that's okay because we enjoyed it all! pastas tasted homemade  and were by far our favorite choices. menu was seasonal  using fresh ingredients and presented beautifully.  We told the host it was a friends birthday and was bummed that the dessert didn't come out with a candle or acknowledgement BUT the confetti cake was such a delicious dessert -tasted completely different then it looked and we were pleasantly surprised !,4.0
"Wow.  I love this place.  The man and I had a reservation at 10pm on Saturday, so we decided to start out the evening with some cocktails at Brooklyn Social, which is conveniently located only a few blocks away.  Once we arrived, we waited only about five minutes for our table. I think we may have been a few early too.  The place was pretty packed, all tables were taken and the small bar was fully occupied.From the moment we arrived through the end of the meal, service was perfect, attentive without the stuffiness.  Every dish was explained in detail when delivered to the table and I never had to refill my own water-bonus points!Now, onto the food...Amazing. We started with two amuse bouches, a goat cheese stuffed ball of love and a root vegetable soup that was to die for.  Next came the homemade bread loaf- yes a loaf for the two of us...I only allowed myself a small taste, but it was perfection-crunchy on the outside and soft on inside, served with two accompaniments-a whipped ricotta and a white bean and olive tapenade. For starters we split the Hamachi and the Pork Belly-we loved them both, we were torn between getting two or three starters (not to mention that everything sounded so good we wanted to try them all!), but splitting two was plenty for us.  For entrees I chose the Scallops with carrots and almonds (I got the half size potion) and he had the Lamb Ribs. Again neither of us was disappointed, in fact we couldn't stop gushing about how flavorful everything was.We didn't get dessert, but with the check came another little treat-two adorable mini shortbread sandwich cookies with a raspberry or strawberry filling (I can't remember exactly what she said they were, but this is my guess).All in all, our experience at Dover was stellar.  The food is simple, clean and beyond flavorful. We will definitely be going back.",5.0
"I got some resistance on not giving this spot 5 stars, but I'm honest in my reviews and the service, slow drink refills don't grant a 5 star rating. I also wasn't blown away by some of the dishes like everyone else. However, some dishes I did find outstanding, for example, cavier pie (best thing I've had in a while), broiled oysters (everyone liked the broiled vs the raw oysters), cauliflower salad, and cod. Other items that were good: tarjarin, lamb tortelini, lobster, and one person especially loved the octopus (i just wasn't a fan of the butter beans, it threw the texture off for me). The lamb ribs were cooked well but were too fatty. My least favorite was the berkshire pork.",4.0
"Went last night. Service was a bit slow but they acknowledged it and took care of some items from the bill. Also was told it would be an hour and a half for table so we ate at the bar (not my favorite thing ). We noticed several empty tables that somehow stayed empty all thru our meal.   Hmmm All this said, the food was spot on delicious. Can recommend anything you choose. The bartender / waiter made excellent choices for us.",5.0
"Really great food.   I followed the yelp reviewers advice and had the cauliflower salad, octopus and half lobster.   Portion size was just right. Wines by the glass were good.   Our server was very attentive.   Unlike some of the other reviewers I felt the  value was very good.  It was a treat but reasonably priced given all that I got.  The decor is a little sterile so that is the reason for the 4 instead of 5 stars",4.0
It's top notch and this neighborhood hasn't had something like this since Saul. I like it much better than Saul btw. Do yourself a favor and splurge for an excellent meal here.  Can't recall a better bread service...,5.0
"This is a very nice restaurant. Though the layout of it is quite strange, but the food is nothing short of amazing. The service is good as well. We had the pork belly, cod fish, lobster and baked Alaska and more. Since my visit was a while back I can't remember all of it. But the baked Alaska was definitely a must have if you are one for dessert. The portion of this place is quite good we ordered the tasting size so we could try more. Certainly not a everyday joint, but if you have a special occasion consider this the place.",5.0
"As a Brooklun ex pat...living in Maine for the past 10 years...it's pretty phenomenal to see places like Dover popping up In Carroll Gardens.....!!!The server totally got into our insane quirky groove...as we proceeded to order almost everything on the menu....4 people later...the caviar app was mind blowing!  The lobster...the BEST i have ever eaten, and I cool for a living!  WELL DONE DOVER!!!  WELL DONE!!!  Anticipating our return!  CHEERS!",5.0
Great food and ambience ...  They will hold a table at the bar for you if you call ahead of time which is great.,5.0
"My dad was in town and I originally had plans to go to either Del Posto or Ai Fiori, but dropped those reservations in favor of something a bit more reasonable and new. I chose Dover over Battersby for no other reason than Dover was newer (but not too new). Folks may complain about the cost (95$ tasting menu in brooklyn) and yet throughout the meal I occasionally would thank my lucky stars I wasn't spending 180$ at del posto, 'cause there is no way it could be better than Dover. This is not a ""neighborhood"" restaurant, though to the unassuming observer they might think it looks like one.IN SHORT: the take-home of this review is that the food was perfectly designed and executed, every single dish was a revelatory combination of flavors that was never muddled or confused, 5/7 of the dishes made me stop after 1 bite and think ""...wow..."" And for the price, you would have to spend 150 minimum in Manhattan to maybe, 'maybe' get something this nice. Worth every penny.Tasting menu was 7 courses, with a lovely number of little additions here and there (I think 5 total) so you never felt like they were being skimpy with food, I left stuffed.Amuse bouche of puff pastry and mornay sauce (fancy cheese puffs) were obviously straight out of the oven. Bite-sizeShot of vichyssoise, tasted like there was some artichoke in there too, very very nice, light but creamy.Oyster with tarragon and pickled Rhubarb. Strange combo of flavors, each one shined on its own and was surprisingly elegant and refreshing.""First"" course, Hamachi crudo with caviar dotted the plate with pillows of buttermilk foam, and what I think were little pools of sweet-pea puree. The most picturesque of the whole meal, perfectly plated and a gorgeous balance of flavors.Then they brought Fresh Bread and fennel crackers with whipped ricotta and honey, and white bean and tapanade spreads. ""Second"" course, warm asparagus with pecorino and a fried egg. Solid plate but the only one of the evening that didn't wow me, still very tasty and seasonal. ""Third"" course, foie-gras with sicilian pistachios, date puree, apricots? and pickled celery and toasted brioche. Beautiful but small plate, as good as a high end Foie prep should be, even the little bit of celery was a fascinating item to taste.""Fourth"" course, striped bass with artichoke and Barigoule sauce. Not sure what the heck barigoule is but holy sh&t. The bass was the least interesting part of this dish though its only because of how amazing that artichoke and barigoule was...""Fifth"" course, Tajarin. This was the craziest dish of them all.

I honestly broke out laughing half-way through this one, it was just so crazy and surprising.""Sixth"" course, Lamb ribs over roasted eggplant, honestly the eggplant stole the show on this plate, and the peanuts and garlic chips were nice when eaten with the fresh mint leaves.

It was great to go to a newer restaurant with some very capable chefs pulling out all the stops. Hard choice between 4 and 5 stars, Food was 5 stars, service 4, decor/ambiance 2.

"We went for my boyfriend's birthday. When you're spending $300+ on dinner for two, you expect better service than your local diner, you won't get it here.The food was fine, nothing outstanding. I found a long hair in my tagliatelle. The manager said she would comp the plate, as they should since the hair was in my first bite and I couldn't stand the idea of eating another bite. The manager assured us this was an anomaly since the cooks wear hairnets. She probably should have remembered there is a clear view into the kitchen, and not a hairnet in sight. Not cool. We asked to talk to the chef and he tried to convince us the woman with the blue apron on in the kitchen was a server. By the way, the servers wear white button down shirts. Made this experience even more painful. Will never go back. Be warned. Watch out for hair in the tagliatelle and no hospitality.",2.0
