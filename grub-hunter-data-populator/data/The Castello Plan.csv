"Since my first visit a few months ago I wanna come back here all the time.I hate to use the word but this place is actually rustic both food and interior wise. While the interior is a bit tight, the cabin like look makes it feel homey, while at the same time like you are not in Brooklyn anymore regardless of where you sit.  In my few visits I have yet to wait to be seated. The food:You can't miss with neither The Logger nor the Breakfast Plan. Both come with a fresh delicious grapefruit topped with honey and sea salt as a starter, along side a fresh squeezed glass of OJ, and some fresh bread slices.-The Logger comes with two sunny side eggs on top of a shredded potato (which to me feels like it has a cheesy undertone) in the shape of a pancake topped with perfectly crisp bacon and fresh kale-The Breakfast plan is an omelette with some delicious sides of hummus, olives and feta cheeseThe Bloody Mary here is great and they serve Toby's estate coffee which is one of my favorite coffees.They except credit card and prices are very reasonableOverall a perfect spot for a low key brunch",5.0
"i took 2 friends from Paris last night to this very  cute Cortelyou Rd place  and I was SO embarrassed w/ the size of  the cheese and ham plate that arrived- 2 slices of manchego for $7 , one little splash of cabrales cheese $7 , 3 slices of ham $7 etc ...OMG, in Paris you get   a beautiful ""tableau de fromages and sausisons"" for 20 E and leave FULL ...this was the biggest restaurant rip off in my restaurant history ...so we proceed to order some mussels  and $60 later run 4 to buy some chocolate at the Food COOP ....thanks  ! SORRY for the negativity , but needed to vent my disbelief as i see the place consistently packed ... must be drinkers FOR SURE X out",1.0
"I have only written one other five star review for a Brooklyn restaurant before and that was for the Farm on Adderly which is less than a block from this fine establishment ...in fact, today my party of three went to the Farm for brunch and we were presented with a 30-45 minute wait. So, it was obviously the day to try the Castello Plan. I'm so glad there was a wait at the Farm!The Castello Plan is small. Get used to it. If they are crowded you will be slightly jostled by other patrons or staff when they move around. The food will make up for it, trust me.",5.0
"Delicious cocktails and friendly, active bar! Had the Beverley Bee - coming back for another soon. Overall, highly recommend.",5.0
"I came here for drinks on Saturday night after dinner at The Farm on Adderley. We had passed by around 6 looking for a dinner spot and it was super crowded. We came back around 8 and there were only like two or three tables taken. They have 3 tall, long tables that fit 4-6 people (depending on stools available), a small bar with a few seats, and the rest are small, round 2-3 person tables. They also have some seating in the patio outside. The bar is dark, intimate, and romantic, with bare bulbs on the walls and candles on the tables. I loved the wood walls on one side and the brick wall on the other. The windows were large and bar area was pretty. They had shelving covering the entire back wall, with bottles filling up each shelf. Glasses were hanging from the bar in front of that. It's rustic and modern. The tall tables are on one side and the small tables are lower and on the right side of the bar. I liked this because it separated the group vibe from the date vibe. We only got drinks, so I don't know anything about the food here. I've seen great reviews though! 4 of us had beer and wine and 1 person got a martini. She only drank a bit of it because it was really salty. The music was pretty poppy, with Taylor Swift and Adele being two memorable ones that came on. I think the atmosphere would have been near perfect if they had had better music, but it wasn't loud enough to be distracting. The bathroom was cute, clean, and spacious. On my way there I also saw that there was a larger circular table near it. This would be good for groups that want to sit at a normal table, but the downside is that it's next to the bathroom and the bar. The rest of the seats are nice because we had a nice view of Cortelyou Road. We arrived a bit too late for the wine/cocktail happy hour, but it looks like a good deal! $6 for house wines and $7 for the bartender's choice cocktail. There is also a 10 pm-midnight deal, which is $7 for a manhattan or martini.",5.0
"This was hands-down the most pleasant brunch experience I had in recent memory. I came with a large group of about 10 people on a Saturday at 11:30 and we were seated promptly. We were given a choice of where we would like to sit irrespective of the fact that we are such a large group. Drinks, including bloody Maria were absolutely amazing. The food was hearty and done just right. The brooklyn logger and the breakfast plan would have to be my favorite dishes. We were never rush to get food arrived just when you would expect it to. The staff is incredibly friendly and customer centric. Even got a complementary ice cream that was to die for. Will certainly be coming back.",5.0
"I had high hopes for this place. Went here for brunch and at first glance the menu appeared somewhat overpriced and limited. We ordered two bloody Mary's at $9 a piece, a croquet Madame w/bacon at $12 and a Brooklyn lager at $15. The drinks were fairly standard, if not on the weak side, the croquet Madame was actually pretty good and the Brooklyn lager was basically hash brown style potatoes, two eggs, bacon, bread, some fresh kale and it came with a grapefruit and a glass of orange juice.  I think that the main problem with the place is not the food, but the prices and the amount of time that it took for the food to come out. On top of it all, the chairs were fairly uncomfortable and the tables were tiny. I think it's one of those place you try, feel indifferent about the whole experience and never return.",3.0
"Best French toast I've ever had and one of my favorite breakfast spots in all of Brooklyn. Never been for dinner, but love the vibe of this place. Tables are uncomfortably small- but the food is so good that it's worth it.",4.0
"Fresh, good quality food. I've come back again and again for brunch, and they are consistently delicious with all of their dishes. Will come back to try dinner one day.",5.0
"Been here quite a few times.. Seems like the last 3 visits though, the service has changed along with the staff.. Forgetting the half grapefruit of the Brooklyn Logger Brunch dish, I can understand.. When I inquired about it, our server asked if I wanted it immediately.. I answered give me a few minutes, and was told no problem.. And by the conclusion of our meal, and beverages, the grapefruit was never served..",4.0
"My friend and I were up to no good, on one of our local bar hopping escapades. This place has a speakeasy style feel to it, intimate and cozy, so we decided to check it out. It's more of a restaurant than a bar, and we sat down to order drinks. I got a Brooklyn Crossing, since there was an $8 martini special that night. The drink was delicious, and I loved the pickles that came with it! It turns out that special martinis weren't part of the deal, but I got my drink for $8 anyway because the waitress mixed up the info. Pretty nice place for a cocktail!",4.0
"Love this place. Excellent cocktails and really good bites of food. Perfect date spot, or afternoon cocktail stop. I love the cocktail with the Earl Gray and the one with the beets. Is the service really slow? Yes. Are you going to wait a while to order drinks? Sure. But on Wednesdays the cocktails are $7, so start trying to order your next while you're halfway through your current, and you'll be a happy camper.",4.0
"Came here for drinks on a rainy night and loved this spot. It's cute, intimate, nice woodsy decor so you feel almost like you're in a lodge cabin somewhere. The service was terrific as were drinks and appetizers. For drinks I tried a little bit of everything, egg nog (ehh), mulled wine which was really good, just the right amount of spices, and a glass of their red wine, also very good. As a snack we had some of their crostini, excellent and would've ordered another plate but didn't want to go overboard. They have a nice selection of apps and I have heard good things about their brunch. Definitely will be back.",4.0
"Decent food. Tight tables. Limited brunch menu, which includes some kale options for the health conscious. We each got the burger. It took a long time to pop out. The burgers were good, but the fingerling potatoes were bland and the watery ketchup didn't make them any better.$4 for a Coke, is probably the most I've paid, outside of Yankee stadium.Spotty table service. (i.e. I asked for the check and then had to ask again)Overall, nothing compelling, but a nice option, if you're local.",3.0
"I came in at peak brunch time (around noon) but was seated immediately. The staff is attentive and personable. I ordered the Brooklyn Logger plus a mimosa. It was amazing. Simple but amazing. Perfectly cooked, expertly seasoned. Just flawless. I would come back every single weekend.",5.0
"I was here with a friend the past Saturday to get a drink and a bite because I was starving. The reason I give it three stars is because of service and the over priced menu! I understand Ditmas Park is an upcoming neighborhood and Cortelyou RD seems pretty popular but it's still not Manhattan. ($9.00 gazpacho and $7.00 small cheese plates is outrageous). I ended up eating nothing (I went next door instead) just had a cocktail. Anyways... Like I mentioned my friend and I went Saturday night (August 1st) and the place was pretty packed. We got greeted immediately by walking in and seated right away. However it seemed the waitress forgot about us because 10 min later we received our menus and another 10 min the water. Another 10 or 15 min went by and she took our order and then another 10 min my cocktail arrived (it was like a french 75, but had blueberry and thyme) it was pretty good, but not really boozy. My friend had the gazpacho that seemed to be good (but not $9.00 worth). I wouldn't come back, unless the menu changed and they would hire a few more people or a hostess.",3.0
"I am not sure that my 3 stars review is the best one to read if you are still wondering if you should go or not.I was with my friend in Cortelyou. I ve heard about this place from a lot of my friend living in the area but I live in Williamsburg and never had the opportunity to hang out there. Anyway yesterday I went there and we ere looking for a nice place to eat. My friend told me that this place was  new. We didn't look the menu and got in. The waitress welcomed us and show us a little cute table next to the window. A very charming place we thought. As it was a hot day we were getting thirsty.  It took them 10 good minutes I believe to bring water. Then it also took a long time to get our order. There were only 2 ladies waitress in the restaurant. The menu is sml wich sometimes is nice bc you can be quicker. However, I belive that my minus 2 came from the price of this place. I'm not looking at the price of my food usually when I go out in the city bc I usually know the price range of a place and also the area. Ok, we were in a nice hipster place cortelyou but the green gazpacho at $9.00 was out of budget for the area.i order that bc I was feeling nauseous and needed smthing fresh. We looked the other meal and it looked like we were having dinner in the village. The small plate of cheese is $7.00. I know that they will probably not going to change anything. And it is budgeted to be that way but I just want to remain the GM that this is not Manhattan. The taste of my gazpacho was ok. A little bit spicy but good. I believe that my friend who had the cocktail liked it too.",3.0
"Very solid cute place for breakfast.  I ordered the Breakfast Plan which comes with an omelet, grapefruit, feta cheese drizzled with olive oil, olives, cauliflower mash, OJ and I believe something else. For $15 it is extremely filling and you feel good after eating such a healthy breakfast.  My only complaints about this place are that the chairs/stools at the high tables are uncomfortable and the menu is very limited.  However, food is quality and service is superb!",4.0
"Came here for Saturday night dinner with two others and enjoyed it! Cortelyou has undergone some serious gentrification, eh?The decor is simple and rustic. Most of the seats are either outdoors or bar seating, so not suitable for larger parties. Although it take a while for us to snag a waiter to order, it's expected of a place like this. Most people come here for wine and small snacks.Well, I guess we weren't most people...I ordered a cocktail with gin, prosecco and blueberries, and it was clean, fruity and well balanced. I'd highly recommend it! We ordered 5 small bites - guacamole and chips (decent), Stewed Mushroom Crostini (my favorite! The mushrooms are soft and delicious atop a *very* crispy baguette slice), Salmon Crostini (advise against this, it was on the blander side), two salami orders (would recommend).The entrees we ordered were mixed - the Hake Tacos were extremely bland; the Tagliatelle was downright undercooked and just tasted of butter; but the Octopus was fantastic. The octopus was cooked very well, and the tomatoes perfectly accompanied them. The plate itself was aesthetically balanced, and all the flavors mixed well. Because this bar doesn't specialize in entrees, and the Octopus dish was aaamazing, I bumped it up to a 4 star rating.Would be interested in coming back for AYCE Mussel Mondays!",4.0
"Very good food but portions are abysmally small. Someone recommended getting a bunch of small plates and I really wish we had done so. I had the butternut squash gnocchi and my girlfriend had the brisket - priced at 16 and 18 bucks respectively. At an actual brisket place like the Smoke Joint would have been at least a pound of brisket. It was very soft and tender. The gnocchi had a ton of flavor and was very well done. The drinks are priced well but again, more so than I thought reasonable.The staff was very friendly and the ambiance is great. :)",3.0

Very cute spot with a great happy hour on Wednesday where their signature cocktails are $7 all night long.  We initially came in for only drinks but were mesmerized by the smell and look of the food.  We ordered the charcuterie and the onion straws.  Everything was delicious and fresh.  The Rosalita was my favorite drink.  Loved the ambiance.  Definitely a cool place to check out when in the area.,4.0

If the weather is nice you can also sit outside which can also make it nice, especially if it is a nice evening.One thing bothered me, and that is the smell.

"I have been living in New York for twenty years, and I have never received worse service than I did at this restaurant. My friend, husband and I popped in for a drink and some food before a show at 8 pm at the Kings Theater which is nearby.  We waited about 15 minutes before anyone even bothered to approach our table and ask if we wanted drinks. Which, fine. Then the drinks took another 20 minutes to arrive. Which, also fine. It was filling up. I will say the cocktails were decent. Everything went downhill from here.We were very upfront with our waitress that we had an 8 pm showtime and ordered quickly. She asked if we wanted everything to come at once. We said yes. We had a very simple order. Our appetizer came out first, which was fine, if not overpriced for what it was. Then we waited. And waited. And waited. No one even came over to check on us, and we finally flagged someone down. We ordered another round and asked about our food. The waiter was borderline rude and dismissive. He checked and said ""the kitchen is working on it now"". Now, I know what this means. I was a waiter for 10 years. This means they forgot to put the order in and were now rushing it. Meanwhile, literally every table has their food in the restaurant except us. We had an order of mussels and are watching as some tables are on their third bowl. Turns out? There was an all you could eat Mussels special on Monday. We only found this out after we left. We were not told that there was a special or given any details.Another 30 minutes later and we were served lukewarm $14 tacos and a puny bowl of mussels. My husband got testy and was like ""why is our bowl of mussels smaller than everyone else's""? They were like ""oh did you do a double order?"". What? Every single person in the place got a huge bowl and we got a bowl full of ten overcooked rubbery mussels. By this point we just needed the check because we were running late. There was no apology and no effort to improve our experience. A comped drink or dessert goes a long way. At the very least, something should have been done. On top of this, the food was not good. It seems like others have had good experiences, but consider yourself warned. I would never go back.",1.0
can't believe i haven't written a review for this place yet! i've frequented this spot in the past and went again last night. really cute interior space. not great for big groups unless you snatch the booth or the whole counter top bars with stools. a group of 4 is nice. date night works pretty well here. They have $7 signature cocktails on weds! I had the Beverley Bee; a safe option if you like gin and honey with salt but if you're into smoky beverages; there's one with lava salt. to eat: 5 for $30 small eats. we had all the crostinis as well as the guac and chips. didn't get to try the brussel sprouts but the mushroom one is delicious. their bread is a little too crusty so the stewed creamy mushrooms soften it a bit. also had the octopus entree. moist and fresh with potatoes and tomatoes. simple and delicious.,4.0
"I am in love with this jewel in my neighborhood. Not only was the staff just a joy, but their suggestions on what to order was on point. I told the young lady (who's name I'm saddened I forgot cause she alone deserves her own shout out) that I hate grapefruit but after talking to me and asking me questions about my taste pallet she guaranteed that I would enjoy it. She was right. I ate grapefruit with joy for the first time in 39 years. And I'm even preparing it as a breakfast item the way they prepare it at home. So glad I can walk to this restaurant. I plan to hang out there a lot more.",4.0

Every single person in the place got a huge bowl and we got a bowl full of ten overcooked rubbery mussels. By this point we just needed the check because we were running late. There was no apology and no effort to improve our experience. A comped drink or dessert goes a long way. At the very least, something should have been done. On top of this, the food was not good. It seems like others have had good experiences, but consider yourself warned. I would never go back.",1.0
can't believe i haven't written a review for this place yet! i've frequented this spot in the past and went again last night. really cute interior space. not great for big groups unless you snatch the booth or the whole counter top bars with stools. a group of 4 is nice. date night works pretty well here. They have $7 signature cocktails on weds! I had the Beverley Bee; a safe option if you like gin and honey with salt but if you're into smoky beverages; there's one with lava salt. to eat: 5 for $30 small eats. we had all the crostinis as well as the guac and chips. didn't get to try the brussel sprouts but the mushroom one is delicious. their bread is a little too crusty so the stewed creamy mushrooms soften it a bit. also had the octopus entree. moist and fresh with potatoes and tomatoes. simple and delicious.,4.0
"I am in love with this jewel in my neighborhood. Not only was the staff just a joy, but their suggestions on what to order was on point. I told the young lady (who's name I'm saddened I forgot cause she alone deserves her own shout out) that I hate grapefruit but after talking to me and asking me questions about my taste pallet she guaranteed that I would enjoy it. She was right. I ate grapefruit with joy for the first time in 39 years. And I'm even preparing it as a breakfast item the way they prepare it at home. So glad I can walk to this restaurant. I plan to hang out there a lot more.",4.0
"Stopped here for bunch this morning.  I had the logger, which turned out to be pretty awesome and covered most of your basic food groups.  Limitless coffee was a nice surprise. My wife hates her French toast, but once I took a bite I couldn't stop eating it.  I can't explain the texture and taste of it, but it was strangely fabulous.  Had to take a star off for the cranky wife, but otherwise a brunch winner.",4.0
"This is my favorite place in the neighborhood! Tiki Tuesday is my favorite night there, great tiki drinks and staff. The menu is well-rounded and executed consistently. My wife and I usually get the small plates, but I highly recommend the scallops. Super clean and classy entree.",5.0
"I only popped into the Castello Plan for a quick drink but their menu made me stay for their excellent small plates.It turned out their signature cocktails were $7 all night on Wednesdays so that was good timing! So I tried the Kentucky Two-Timer and Old Fashioned Date Night - both were delicious and strong but the bourbon with black pepper had such an interesting taste that I keep thinking about it since!I got peckish after seeing someone else getting served small plates, so we tried five cheeses, charcuterie and some lush cured salmon crostini. It came out on a big wooden board with candied walnut, honey and some red fruit jam and lots of lovely light rye bread. Fantastic! It reminded me of tapas I had in a plaza in Barcelona which I occasionally fantasise about.So, we needed another drink to wash down the deliciousness. My other half had the Calabaza Pesadilla and its combination of pumpkin mezcal and Aztec bitters (not sure what they are) was so citrusy that I wish I'd ordered that. Next time!Really lovely service and beautiful utilitarian interior. This place would make a great place for a first date.",4.0
"Happened upon this place several months ago, and it's become one of my favorite brunch spots! Croque Madame and the Brooklyn Logger are my favorites.

"They've redone the menu and most of the staff at Castello. Some of the items on the menu have the same name, but they've been reworked. The sides have gotten better, but the main courses aren't quite as good as before. I'd probably still be happy if I didn't know how great it used to be.For a while it seemed like their drinks had zero alcohol in them. The bartender in question hasn't been there the past few times I've gone and the drinks seem back to normal. Which is good, since they have an excellent cocktail menu.",4.0
"this place is small and has a very rustic feel to it. Theres lots of wood and exposed wire and metal to give that vintage look. it's very laid back so it's nice for occasions like a date or just a casual meet up. I really like that they have an uncommon selection of beers to choose from. I've had the Monk's Belgium Sour beer while my friends' ordered a New York Third Rail Saison, and a Bells Brewery Michigan Amber Ale. All very different and interesting to try.Their food portions tend to be a little pricey. $7 for small plates which really comes down to a couple of sliced cheeses or meats like Prosciutto, salami or pork shoulder. The Hake Taco was very tasty. It's a very tender fish taco with all the dressings of red and green cabbage, cilantro, guacamole and radish. All the flavors blended and played well together to give a solid deliciousness. However like said earlier about prices 2 tacos for $14 seems a bit excessive.The Mussels was probably my favorite. They weren't overcooked like most places. It's made with a simple broth of cilantro, onion and garlic in addition to the natural juices of the mussels. The slices of bread that came with it was perfect for soaking up the broth in case you can't get enough of that flavor.Service wise, it's very friendly but a bit slow, but that's a given since we came on a saturday night. With all the dishes we order, they took their sweet ass time coming out with very limited table space to work with. Don't expect to get to your next agenda anytime soon.

I took my mom for brunch here on Mother's Day and it was a cool spot. Mom said she enjoyed it. It's a cozy little place with some outdoor seating. The food and drinks were delicious.

Really?!?!??!  I'm sorry but from my understanding, most restaurants in NYC are located on the first floor and I usually don't come across a roach crawling around while dining.As for their food, we went for their all you can eat mussels. Although their price was decent ($10) and the mussels were plump and huge,  the service was absolutely horrendous. The staff would frown on my friends and I whenever we asked for seconds.  The portion they gave us was small so when we did ask for more, they would make us wait at least 15-25 minutes before they took out the next batch. Eventually, they would just come up to us and say,  ""are you all finish"" and when we said ""no"", they gave us an attitude. Let's just say the service was so bad that eventually even the water stopped coming! My only conclusion for this poor behavior on their end was due to the fact that we didn't order anything else except for the mussels and cocktails. Apparently ordering just cocktails was not enough.All in all, my experience here was TERRIBLE AND DISGUSTING!!!

I've been here a couple of times for brunch. Cute cocktail names. The best part about this place is the bread. I've ordered the french toast which was very tasty (not too sweet) and the egg sandwich which was pretty good. My friends have ordered the burger and raved about it (except for the size). Def a must try if you're in the area.,4.0
"I had brunch with my best friend here to celebrate his birthday a couple of Sundays ago. We've known each other for 13 years, but we're separated by over 200 miles now because he's living in Northern Virginia while I'm in Brooklyn (where we met in high school). Since we now see each other so rarely, I am so glad that I chose The Castello Plan for his birthday brunch, because it was such a fantastic experience, it just made the day even more special.We wanted to beat the brunch rush crowd so we met at around 11:30, and success; a few other tables were full, but there was plenty of choice seating available, including outside on their pretty patio (it was a bit too cool out at the time for us to venture there though). Within 45 minutes the place was packed, and with good reason; the food, drinks and service are all a cut above even some of the better Brooklyn brunches.My friend went for the Brooklyn Logger for his brunch, and so they brought out his fresh-squeezed orange juice and half grapefruit first, which he raved about (admittedly, my friend is an enthusiastic guy). We decided to be adventurous with our brunch cocktails, and I got the Cada Semana while he got the Bitter Morning, which reported tasted like a kicked-up, more delicious version of a Mimosa. I'd never tried Mezcal before, so my drink was a chance to try something new. Unfortunately, I have to say the smokiness of the Mezcal didn't really work for me, and there was a little too much bitterness from the Cocchi American; there was enough grapefruit juice and honey to make it drinkable though. If you like smoky Scotch, this would probably be a great brunch drink for you, but I think I'll try out the Bitter Morning myself next time.And yes, there will be a next time! Our entrees were so delicious that I definitely plan to go back to try more. Although not too soon, admittedly; so astonishingly rich! My Croque Madame was heaven on a plate, with the lightly toasted challah made even more flaky and tender with generous amounts of butter, and the eggs, cheddar and ham were a burst of savory deliciousness. My friend was so overwhelmed by the sheer mass of potatoes, eggs, bacon and salad he received that I actually don't recall him saying many words about it at all, but suffice it to say that he cleared the plate.The service was really lovely, very friendly. The ambiance was PERFECT for a casual, lazy Sunday brunch. I've had few brunch experiences as good as this one, this place is definitely a keeper.",5.0
Came for desert and a drink. Both turned out really really well! Toasted almond ice cream (Without sea salt) was amazing!!! Will definitely come again specifically for toasted almond ice cream. Cocktail Kennebunker (probably spelled wrong) was pretty good ... it had a bubbly blueberry taste.,4.0
Was only an ok meal when dining here. Went a while back & I remember having ratatouille and something else. Another time we had several small plates. One of them being a cheese with lavender in it that tasted like soap. Everything else was not memorable. Highly doubt I'll be coming back.,2.0
"I'll admit we checked out this place after a few drinks across the street... so, no doubt, perhaps a bit biased. This was my first foray into this hood in any capacity but I found it pretty charming - no less so this bar/restaurant. Cool decor, helpful staff, reasonable prices... My only complaints listed below:-Very limited menu, which, if I was into any of the dishes, wouldn't have been such a problem.Actually, upon further reflection, that's basically it. The quality of the ingredients was great, portions were right-on as well. We shared an order of the Skate and another dish no longer available - I just wasn't interested by any of the ingredients - neither primary nor secondary.

"Eh. Ok. It's not horrible, the decor is cute, but I have to say I'm not leaving happy about the service. It wasn't bad at first but once my burger came out bleeding when I order medium, has onions all over it when u specifically say no onions, and is not cut in half when I specifically asked for it to be(I was sharing) having to send it back sucked, I got hungry, and usually this is when I just sip on my drink till I get my order except I didn't have a drink and was left feeling super awkward.

I've been here a couple of times for brunch. Cute cocktail names. The best part about this place is the bread. I've ordered the french toast which was very tasty (not too sweet) and the egg sandwich which was pretty good. My friends have ordered the burger and raved about it (except for the size). Def a must try if you're in the area.,4.0
"I had brunch with my best friend here to celebrate his birthday a couple of Sundays ago. We've known each other for 13 years, but we're separated by over 200 miles now because he's living in Northern Virginia while I'm in Brooklyn (where we met in high school). Since we now see each other so rarely, I am so glad that I chose The Castello Plan for his birthday brunch, because it was such a fantastic experience, it just made the day even more special.We wanted to beat the brunch rush crowd so we met at around 11:30, and success; a few other tables were full, but there was plenty of choice seating available, including outside on their pretty patio (it was a bit too cool out at the time for us to venture there though). Within 45 minutes the place was packed, and with good reason; the food, drinks and service are all a cut above even some of the better Brooklyn brunches.My friend went for the Brooklyn Logger for his brunch, and so they brought out his fresh-squeezed orange juice and half grapefruit first, which he raved about (admittedly, my friend is an enthusiastic guy). We decided to be adventurous with our brunch cocktails, and I got the Cada Semana while he got the Bitter Morning, which reported tasted like a kicked-up, more delicious version of a Mimosa. I'd never tried Mezcal before, so my drink was a chance to try something new. Unfortunately, I have to say the smokiness of the Mezcal didn't really work for me, and there was a little too much bitterness from the Cocchi American; there was enough grapefruit juice and honey to make it drinkable though. If you like smoky Scotch, this would probably be a great brunch drink for you, but I think I'll try out the Bitter Morning myself next time.And yes, there will be a next time! Our entrees were so delicious that I definitely plan to go back to try more. Although not too soon, admittedly; so astonishingly rich! My Croque Madame was heaven on a plate, with the lightly toasted challah made even more flaky and tender with generous amounts of butter, and the eggs, cheddar and ham were a burst of savory deliciousness. My friend was so overwhelmed by the sheer mass of potatoes, eggs, bacon and salad he received that I actually don't recall him saying many words about it at all, but suffice it to say that he cleared the plate.The service was really lovely, very friendly. The ambiance was PERFECT for a casual, lazy Sunday brunch. I've had few brunch experiences as good as this one, this place is definitely a keeper.",5.0
Came for desert and a drink. Both turned out really really well! Toasted almond ice cream (Without sea salt) was amazing!!! Will definitely come again specifically for toasted almond ice cream. Cocktail Kennebunker (probably spelled wrong) was pretty good ... it had a bubbly blueberry taste.,4.0
Was only an ok meal when dining here. Went a while back & I remember having ratatouille and something else. Another time we had several small plates. One of them being a cheese with lavender in it that tasted like soap. Everything else was not memorable. Highly doubt I'll be coming back.,2.0
"I'll admit we checked out this place after a few drinks across the street... so, no doubt, perhaps a bit biased.

My only complaints listed below:-Very limited menu, which, if I was into any of the dishes, wouldn't have been such a problem.Actually, upon further reflection, that's basically it. The quality of the ingredients was great, portions were right-on as well.

"It's hit or miss here. Brunch was excellent here last time we came. This time we came for dinner right at open.First, when the plates came out they were visibly dirty with pieces of food on them. I had to wipe mine down with the not so clean handkerchief provided. Fine, everyone has off days even though they were closed between brunch and dinner so not sure how they were so ""off"". Plenty of time to prepare.It took 50 minutes for our food to come. Manchego salad, without any manchego by the way. And gnocchi. Not sure if it's just in the name but ours was greens and a quarter of a blood orange with some sunflower seeds. Pretty good salad really, just too bad it took almost an hour. Now butternut squash gnocchi I understand does take a while. But unless they made it entirely from  scratch, almost an hour doesn't make any sense. We were also like the first to order. Sounds like prep was entirely lacking here. It would have been zero stars really but one star for food actually tasting good, and one star for cold beers on a hot day.That being said, I'll still probably be back for brunch.",2.0

Everything was delicious can't say anything wasn't tasteful but the portion size of some ingredients could have been a bit fuller.

I ordered my eggs over easy and one of them was over cooked but that happens it's understandable but I was surprised they served it to me so obviously over cooked rather than just making a new egg. I would still come here again and try something else out. I had The Brooklyn Logger and wouldn't mind eating it again in the future...with extra kale =)",3.0

We held our office holiday party here and could not have been more pleased with the evening.  Castello Plan is very small and cozy; with a great buzz and delicious food.  The restaurant offers tons of easy to create party menu & bar plans to fit every party size and budget.  The event coordinator was extremely responsive via email leading up to our event and super accommodating with our small party size.  We arrived to find three tables reserved with beautiful charcuterie boards and spiced nuts in a festive display for our guests.  The small plates were presented in perfect pacing during the night and the dessert was amazing!  (ricotta cheesecake).  I was DD for the evening but everyone loved sampling Castello Plan's sophisticated cocktail menu as well as appreciated our host's wine recommendations.  The staff was very attentive and gracious and we will definitely be back for dinner soon!,5.0

"It's hit or miss here. Brunch was excellent here last time we came. This time we came for dinner right at open.First, when the plates came out they were visibly dirty with pieces of food on them. I had to wipe mine down with the not so clean handkerchief provided. Fine, everyone has off days even though they were closed between brunch and dinner so not sure how they were so ""off"". Plenty of time to prepare.It took 50 minutes for our food to come. Manchego salad, without any manchego by the way. And gnocchi. Not sure if it's just in the name but ours was greens and a quarter of a blood orange with some sunflower seeds. Pretty good salad really, just too bad it took almost an hour. Now butternut squash gnocchi I understand does take a while. But unless they made it entirely from  scratch, almost an hour doesn't make any sense. We were also like the first to order. Sounds like prep was entirely lacking here. It would have been zero stars really but one star for food actually tasting good, and one star for cold beers on a hot day.That being said, I'll still probably be back for brunch.",2.0

"Stumbled upon ths place for brunch after being told Farm on Adderley was 1.5 hour wait. I'm glad we came. The place was virtually empty and we were seated right away.We ordered the Brooklyn Logger and the Breakfast plan and shared it between three ppl. I ordered the matching beer for the Brooklyn, and it was the perfect accompaniment.The highlight was the blue cheese grits, which I see, is not on the menu. When it comes back, it is an absolute must have.Although (as they probably should have) they gave us free grits after my wife found a piece of foil in hers. I wouldve eaten the foil if I could gt another round as well.The orange juice was pretty fresh as well.",4.0
"I have lived in Ditmas Park for 2 years and have never stumbled across this little place. (I came here after Lea's turned us away at 1:45pm, even though it was empty, to seat an entire family as we were walking out.)The food was good but the wait was RIDICULOUS. My fiancé and I ordered sunny side eggs with bacon and a burger and it took an HOUR to arrive. Fortunately, my waitress noticed how long our meal was taking and comped our entire meal. I've lived in Brooklyn my entire life and never have I experienced such amazing customer service as I have at Castello Pan. Even though she comped our meal, I left her a tip as she was really attentive and apologetic. I will definitely return. (FYI, The kitchen flooded the night before, thus the long wait)",4.0
"I just wanted to say: we came here for the New Year's Eve party and every course was impeccable. It was classy and fun, everything complex and delicious. I'd recommend it. Standouts: taglietelle, the crostini, and the potato leek soup. As always, the bar didn't disappoint. What a delicious night!",5.0
"Nice brunch spot, not very comfy seating but it's a very small place so figure if you come there it's for the food. Everything was delicious can't say anything wasn't tasteful but the portion size of some ingredients could have been a bit fuller. For example the kale was a couple of leaves, it wouldn't hurt to give a fuller salad considering there was a lot of potato. Pretty skimp on bacon as well. I ordered my eggs over easy and one of them was over cooked but that happens it's understandable but I was surprised they served it to me so obviously over cooked rather than just making a new egg. I would still come here again and try something else out. I had The Brooklyn Logger and wouldn't mind eating it again in the future...with extra kale =)",3.0

I had the french toast. It was pretty good. It is served with sour cream and plum jam. I asked for maple syrup but was told they don't have that... Weird.

I wished I was splitting it with someone. Service was very good.,4.0
"Wonderful service, great cocktails- LOVED the Kennebunk! A fine Bells amber ale for hubby. We shared the Cana de Cabra cheese platter and artichoke manchengo crostini. Both were fabulous.

The music is appropriate and the ambiance is always perfect, combination of cozy, rustic and chic. The mussels I had last night however were just...bad. Very bad. They were tough, not very fresh tasting and way too powerful. Every mouthful felt like drinking seawater...overall bad.

I was so hungry and I was expecting that for 17-something bucks I would be getting a nice big plate of the stuff (hate to make comparisons so I won't name names, but another ---comparable---local eatery offers gnocchi for $16, and at said place there was so much gnocchi that I ended up taking some home in a box--I really tried to stuff it all in my face--errr I mean-- finish..) but alas, here I was definitely kicking myself after eating 3 pieces and being near halfway done.

My first thought was, ""wow, it's like a Williamsburg wine bar without the hordes of people."" (Maybe I don't know the hood well enough, but needless to say I was pleased to see such a nice little spot). Things got better from there. We enjoyed wine and beer that were expertly recommended by our server, and started with a plate of cheese, meat, and crostini -- the brussels sprout and ricotta was insanely good -- all of it terrific. For my entree, I had the cauliflower soup (out of this world) and the grain salad (good, but a little bland). My boyfriend went with the grilled octopus and loved it. Food and atmosphere were both great, but the fifth star here goes to the service. Our server was tremendously kind, genuine, helpful, and attentive without being overbearing.

"Clever Castello...waited so long to eat here and it was worth the wait.  This spot cares about the food it serves and where it is from...flavor combos- check.Ate:Grilled fontina & scallions on fontina- added on Serano for an extra $2comes w/side salad.Grapefruit w/ honey and sea saltStarted with the grapefruit. So simple yet sooooo good. Grilled cheese perfection- period.  One of the best I have ever tasted!  Melted, gooey fontina w/ scallions and crisped Serrano. Perfectly grilled country bread. Side salad had tomatoes, cukes and tumeric onions- w/ lovely tasting dressing. Loved it!",5.0
"What a gem. It was our first time exploring Ditmas Park, and we stumbled across this spot with a friend who lives in the area. My first thought was, ""wow, it's like a Williamsburg wine bar without the hordes of people."" (Maybe I don't know the hood well enough, but needless to say I was pleased to see such a nice little spot). Things got better from there. We enjoyed wine and beer that were expertly recommended by our server, and started with a plate of cheese, meat, and crostini -- the brussels sprout and ricotta was insanely good -- all of it terrific. For my entree, I had the cauliflower soup (out of this world) and the grain salad (good, but a little bland). My boyfriend went with the grilled octopus and loved it. Food and atmosphere were both great, but the fifth star here goes to the service. Our server was tremendously kind, genuine, helpful, and attentive without being overbearing. I don't know her name, but she rocked. All in all, a super experience -- we'll be back in the neighborhood just to enjoy another dinner here.",5.0
"My first time eating here.  Size and ambiance are very charming.  I got the Brooklyn Logger plate I think it was called....some type of squash pancakes, sausage, bacon, scrambled egg, mixed greens salad and potato type thing-y.  It also came with a half grapefruit and freshly squeezed OJ.  Overall, the dish was phenomenal....a great mix of things...and very generous to have included all that with one dish.  In addition, I'm the type who loves a breakfast with a little bit of that and that, so for me it was pure perfection.  The squash pancakes were extremely good and unique.That said, the cook seemed to go a bit heavy on the salt.  I especially noticed it with the egg and the greens.  In addition, they automatically sprinkled the top of the graprefruit with sugar....more than I myself would have normally added.Lastly, they had no A/C.....no fans....this in the middle of a 90-something degree day.  I was dying in there.All in all however, I'd have to say that based on the one meal I got there, and if they could have gone lighter on the salt/sugar, I thought the components of my dish and the overall execution were top-notch.",4.0
Love the decor.  Excellent service with kind waiters and a cozy atmosphere.  Delicious tagliatelle.  Those complaining about the portions should note that they are a normal size in most of the world. Can't wait to try their other dishes and drinks.,4.0
"I am so thrilled to have a restaurant like the Castello Plan in walking distance of my apartment. Atmosphere-wise: it is casual enough that I'm never worried about what I'm wearing but upscale enough that I feel like I'm treating myself just by being there. I wouldn't say this place is great for large groups because it's small inside, but it's perfect for date night or dinner with your visiting parents. The food is really, really great (albeit pricey, but you know you are paying for super-fresh ingredients) and even the simplest sounding things, like the ricotta and Brussels sprout crostini, are supremely delicious and hard to replicate in your own kitchen. I also never feel stupid asking about ingredients I've never heard of before, which is a testament to how friendly their pretty stylish staff is. They have a great wine list and I hope to try more of it this summer.",5.0

"Service was mixed - the person who let us in told us someone would be leaving soon, and then abandoned us. We waited at the bar, but the bartender ignored us too. So we were finally scouting out our own places when a nice person asked if we were looking for a table. She ended up serving us, and was fantastic. If only she'd been our only server, we'd have to rate everything superbly. It was someone late on a Friday, and they were out of several entrees. We ended up just going with small plates. None of them were amazing - the sardines on the crostini were weirdly gelatinous, and the stewed mushrooms tasted blandly floury and creamy. The cheese was good, as was the charcuterie, and the drinks were good. We ended up not wanting to order more food, but I would give the menu a second chance some other time - maybe we just ordered inauspiciously. Again, for wine and cocktails, it's a great place.",3.0
"I gave this place two stars mainly because it was pricey for the portions of food they served. I went for Sunday brunch and had the sweet potato pancakes with a side of bacon. I was shocked when my food arrived that I had three half-dollar sized pancakes on my plate... for $9 no less!! The bacon was tasty but it was soggy, sitting in its own fat for I don't know how long before it was served to me. My boyfriend had the Toad in the Hole and a side of squash blue cheese grits. Both plates again her delicious but again, the portions were tiny! Needless to say, both of us left still hungry. The bloody mary's were pretty good though. Our waiter was nice enough to comp us for one because he forgot to bring it out with the meal. So, again, the food was delicious and fresh; wait staff was very friendly. Overall, it was a nice customer experience. But the prices they were charging for the portions they were serving were a little ridlculous.

"Art and cuisine in motion!My wife and I have been coming here since moving to Ditmas Park in the Summer 2012.  I cannot say a bad thing about this place.The place is wonderfully decorated.  It has a rustic look of old wood and plaster yet very elegant with the stemmed wine glasses hanging over the bar, and cool ceramics embedded in the wall.  The lighting is very well done.  There is always pleasant music playing, but it's not too loud and I never have difficulty hearing when people speak to me.There are some smaller tables to sit at for couples, some communal high tables and the bar.  We always sit at the bar for one reason:  we enjoy seeing the chef work up incredible dishes from his meager 4 stove tops and mini fridge.  This guy is a true artist and he could take on any ""Iron"" chef, anytime, anywhere!  I cannot write about every meal I've had here, but let me tell you: I have yet to be disappointed.The staff is very attentive, quick, friendly and helpful without being overbearing.  They make you feel welcome and cared for.The menu is very well thought out, perfect for sampling several culinary delights.  It's mostly tapas-sized, making for fun evenings of sharing dishes without breaking the bank or the gut.While Castello Plan does not have a full bar, it does have a very well put together wine list that offers plenty of choices of reds and whites by the bottle or by the glass without being overpriced, which is more than a certain popular restaurant across and up the street toward Coney Island Avenue can say!  There are plenty of beers to choose from too.  I'm not much of a beer drinker, but beer people that I've brought here have been plenty satisfied.For me, it's the only place to go for dinner in Ditmas.",5.0

"Stopped by here for brunch today. It was great. We don't spend a lot of time in this neighborhood, but have tried out one or two other brunch spots on Courtelyou before. This is my favorite one so far. It was a beautiful out. I sat outside and enjoyed the special Bloody Maria to start the day. The lady and I shared The Breakfast Plan for brunch, along with a side salad. Everything was great. I like variety, and always prefer getting a little taste of a lot of dishes, rather than a lot of just one or two items. I was a big fan of the eggs, hash, grapefruit and side salad. I didn't love the squash & bleu cheese polenta, but im not a big bleu cheese fan. The kale salad was ok, but overall, it was a great meal, and i love that i had 6 different things to eat. We topped it off with some ice cream. I had the orange sherbert. My date had the salted caramel ice cream. The sherbet was good, but she definitely won on the ice cream selections. Hers was great.We sat there for a while, ate a bunch and had a few drinks. It was a very relaxed setting. i never felt rushed to get out because I'm taking up valuable space like a lot of ny places tend to make you feel - especially on a saturday brunch.Overall, food was great, the waitress was very nice. i definitely want to come back here to try out dinner or just some evening drinks. i would also definitely recommend it to friends as well.",4.0

"There are some serious pluses and minuses to this place. They're doing the wine bar with small plates thing, and charging accordingly. Basically Manhattan prices because they're the only option for this kind of thing - dim lighting, good wine list, wood and brick everywhere - in the neighborhood. At least the only thing snooty about the place is the prices; the service is down to earth, and the background music is often blues and garage rock. I can deal with that.The air is thick with melted butter and the scent of mussels. Those are good smells, but it's a little odd to walk out with my clothes smelling like that. The windows were open, but I could taste the butter in my mouth before I took a bite of food.The food is very tasty, but wallows in heaviness. I understand food being salty in a wine bar, but there's no reason for the bread in the crostini to be so soaked in butter that each piece approaches the weight of a steak BEFORE any of the rich toppings are applied. I'll admit they're delicious, especially the mushroom and artichoke/manchego versions, but damn are they heavy! They sit in your stomach like you just ate at a TGIFriday's, even though going down they're a hundred times more delicious.Just to make sure you get your fill the menu offers items like pulled pork sliders and lamb meatballs. Even though the portions are a little small and the prices high I recommend ordering with restraint.Bottom line: You have a nice experience here. It's a charming place run by charming people.

"Based on one experience, so I can't speak to everything. Mondays: all you can eat mussels for $10. I'm not sure I got $10 worth. The first round was undercooked so a third of them were closed and not particularly appetizing once opened. I was offered more once my companion was already done with his meal. I said yes and it was another 10-15 minutes before they arrived.  I felt disappointed.  My companion was also not very satisfied with what he got.I'm not planning to go back any time soon.  The servers were quite pleasant, but I do think they could have anticipated this issue of the mussels taking a long time and that being awkward for the other party.",2.0

"A cursory glance at Castello Plan makes it look like a gem; the decor is simply charming and is remniscent of something resembling a French villa, menu screams chic at a rather affordable price and the wine/cocktail menu are, to say the least, deadly, delicious and varied.... Did I forget to mention the friendly yet slightly eccentric Bohemian staff?Well love at first sight was all it was at Castello. If you look past the aesthetics, it's not all it seems to be... The wait staff rotated and was definitely flakey; in one night we had 3 different servers and not once did they ask us how our food was or if we needed anything else. Food wise, I'd give it a B. The appetizers - mushroom crostini and the Guanciale weren't too bad; the meals themselves - confit and the lamb - were just ok... Both meats were well-done and I actually loved the side with the confit but the chickpeas with the lamb were A disaster. By that I mean tough to chew, flavorless and just not exciting in the least. The desserts were awful; I've had better truffles virtually everywhere else and the walnut bread pudding was very dry (though deceptively moist). I will say we hit the mark on the alcohol for the night. The rose was delicious as was the cocktail (I believe it was called the Kentucky Rock?).If I come back for anything it'll be the drinks or if someone's treating me. We were there for 3 hours and while we adore each other's company, the long dinner was mostly due to the inattentive staff (again friendly, bizarre and sooo Williamsburg). I think I'm mostly bitter because everything just looked so good and was sooo disappointing. Oh, last mixed review - music was too loud but the playlist itself was good.

"Tonight my partner and I looked up reasonably priced restaurants to go to.  We're new to Brooklyn, and found this little gem.  The Castello Plan is an incredible find.  If you have the good fortune to be in walking distance, you're in luck.  First, I'll get the bad out of the way.  It is a little pricy for a ""reasonable"" place.  However, the food is perfect.  My palette has been called, for better or worse, picky.  So take that for what it's worth.  Also, the service was great with one exception.  We had delicious steamed mussels for our first course.  We were not quite done with them when the main course was served.  A pet peeve of mine.  Outside of that, no other problems.  Also, no cocktails.  :-(Now on to the good.Service: The service was for the rest of the time spot on.  Handsome servers (which is a plus in my book :-) ), and always ready to refill the glass without being too clingy to the table.  Food: Properly cooked.  Our first course, steamed mussels were great.  I've had these in the past where every time you ate one you crunched down on sand.  While there were one or two grains of sand remaining (let's face it, it's going to happen), they were great.  I had a delicious rainbow trout with dandelion greens with a lemon.  Not overbearing, just the right smokiness required.  My partner had ribs.  Also, smoked to perfection.The wine selection was nice, although pricey.Atmosphere: Think a chic version of ""Pirates of the Caribbean.""  And don't be fooled by the chairs.  You will not fall back.Take in The Castello Plan.  Just make sure you have the budget - it's worth it.",4.0

"I came to The Castello Plan on a thursday night around 10:30pm. My good friends were taking me on a tour de Brooklyn in hopes to persuade me to move there. Okay, we're moving regardless...but the tour helped! They took me around to several neighborhoods throughout Brooklyn like Park Slope, Red Hook, Cobble Hill, Downtown, Greenpoint, Fort Greene, Williamsburg, etc. We ended the tour with a stop at their favorite neighborhood: Ditmas Park.We parked the car and walked in The Castello Plan to find a live jazzy band playing some tunes. The place is super small and was packed, but not uncomfortably so. I sat next to a woman that was unpleased with my presence, but I kept smiling at her in hopes that she would liten up. Anyhow, we ordered some beer from their extensive list, listened to the music, and gawked at the beautiful decor in this tiny place.I couldn't have loved the charm of The Castello Plan more. I can't wait to come back!",5.0
"A really great little restaurant/wine bar that doesn't stop surprising. The menu changes constantly and every time the new dishes are a treat. The range is from good to amazing with very few misses. The feel is European, casual, cozy and elegant. The wine and beer selection is not huge but very expertly picked so it's hard to go wrong.It also has a phenomenal brunch menu, one of the most interesting and delicious I have had in NY. Instead of the usual eggs benedict there are soft-boiled eggs with sprats and home-made mayo, chorizo/potato/egg hot pot, prawns and polenta with a fried egg. Deserts sometimes miss the mark but when they are at their simplest- ricotta/honey/dried lemon peel- they are sublime.",5.0

"Based on one experience, so I can't speak to everything. Mondays: all you can eat mussels for $10. I'm not sure I got $10 worth. The first round was undercooked so a third of them were closed and not particularly appetizing once opened. I was offered more once my companion was already done with his meal. I said yes and it was another 10-15 minutes before they arrived.  I felt disappointed.  My companion was also not very satisfied with what he got.I'm not planning to go back any time soon.  The servers were quite pleasant, but I do think they could have anticipated this issue of the mussels taking a long time and that being awkward for the other party.",2.0
"This was a super dope place. Me and the wife came here for food and drinks, to explore the neighborhood, and it was an awesome spot. Quiet, candlelit, different seating options. Great ambience. The food has a base of good with some dishes that were really terrific (cauliflower soup, artichoke and manchego crostini). We had delicious cocktails made well. I would say the bill ended up being just a bit more than we wanted to pay - but it was a good splurge for a Friday night date.",4.0
"Thank you for the recommendation, Amie!I was looking for a spot to have Sunday brunch with a second/third date. He drives (a nice car) so it could've been anywhere. This is not in a neighborhood I normally hang out at. The brunch menu showcased the best of the best. The bloody mary came with the longest, freshest stalk of celery! Already impressed. I ordered a grilled cheese with ham and tomatoes (highly recommended by others) and he got the Stuyvesant's eggs. I enjoyed this meal very much and also wanted what everyone else was having.Next time, salmon lox it is!",4.0
"A cursory glance at Castello Plan makes it look like a gem; the decor is simply charming and is remniscent of something resembling a French villa, menu screams chic at a rather affordable price and the wine/cocktail menu are, to say the least, deadly, delicious and varied.... Did I forget to mention the friendly yet slightly eccentric Bohemian staff?Well love at first sight was all it was at Castello. If you look past the aesthetics, it's not all it seems to be... The wait staff rotated and was definitely flakey; in one night we had 3 different servers and not once did they ask us how our food was or if we needed anything else. Food wise, I'd give it a B. The appetizers - mushroom crostini and the Guanciale weren't too bad; the meals themselves - confit and the lamb - were just ok... Both meats were well-done and I actually loved the side with the confit but the chickpeas with the lamb were A disaster. By that I mean tough to chew, flavorless and just not exciting in the least. The desserts were awful; I've had better truffles virtually everywhere else and the walnut bread pudding was very dry (though deceptively moist). I will say we hit the mark on the alcohol for the night. The rose was delicious as was the cocktail (I believe it was called the Kentucky Rock?).If I come back for anything it'll be the drinks or if someone's treating me. We were there for 3 hours and while we adore each other's company, the long dinner was mostly due to the inattentive staff (again friendly, bizarre and sooo Williamsburg). I think I'm mostly bitter because everything just looked so good and was sooo disappointing. Oh, last mixed review - music was too loud but the playlist itself was good. The Castello Plan is confusing. If I were you, I'd save your money and head to the Farm, Purple Yam or Mimi's. Any option is a safer one...",3.0

"The brunch at Castello's Plan deserves more than 3 stars, but every time I go there the service is just somewhat off, which takes away from enjoying my favorite, the Breakfast Plan. About the sumptuous plate first: it's simple, delicious and utterly satisfying. I love the refreshing sweetness of the half-grapefruit, followed by the green omelet and veggie/spread platter. This particular combo strikes the balance between light and filling, which makes for a perfect late breakfast option.The service however is very spotty. The first time I and a friend came over, right after it opened for brunch, the place was empty besides us and another couple. But the music was blaring very loud. We requested that they turn it down, but they wouldn't do it, as it was ""supposed"" to be so loud (we couldn't hear each other and it was only 11.30 am!). That response was rather strange, as I assumed that the customers' preference should be attended to rather than refused. The next time I came over with another friend our order was  mistakenly served to the couple at the next table. After a few minutes, they hailed the waiter who realized the mistake and simply took the plates over to our table, even though the couple has moved the bread around. That was off putting, but when we expressed concern they told us the food had not been touched and they would simply bring us a new serving of bread. Still, being  handed food that spent some time on another table was not the best service I'd say. That same day, the waitress who was serving us was making us rearrange all the food on the tiny table by ourselves (which is a problem -- why have tables so small that two dishes for two people don't even fit?) rather than helping us out. I thought that as a waitress familiar with the place, with the dishes etc. it was she who was supposed to know how to fit it all on the table. It was strange to have to be taking care of that by myself: I actually ended up having to hold one of the plates on my lap. I will go back to Castello's Plan because the food is a treat. But I do hope that the service will improve. It is a shame that a lovely place like that falls short in this regard.",3.0
"My biggest gripe these days is the lackluster service in this city.  Not always, but more often than it should be.  I have been in the restaurant business for thirteen (""sigh"") years.  I'm all too familiar with catering to demanding customers, smiling when I don't want to, responding to questions when the answer seems so obvious, etc, but sometimes you just have to do it.  It's our job!  That being said, lately my  reviews weigh more heavily on the service I receive than how much I liked or disliked the food.  Okay, now that that's off my chest; The Castello Plan has fantastic, friendly, attentive service and a killer wine list.  I have not eaten here YET but will be back soon to do so.",5.0
"Nice, cozy wine bar on Cortelyou Rd. with outside seating that allows smoking, which I wasn't thrilled about. Great beer and wine list, which attentive waitstaff can help navigate if you specify your preferences. They will gladly bring you a taste as well.Food menu changes frequently. Their crostinis used to be fantastic, and there was more to choose from, but not anymore. Two sprats in oil with lemon wedges for $6 when you can easily get a whole tin of them from any Russian store for less than $2.50 - ridiculous. Charcuterie  and cheese plate has a great presentation and plenty of side items to dip or garnish your mini-sandwich, yet the portions remain tiny. We got 5 for $25 deal and that made things a bit better.Special grape jello dessert with ricotta cheese tasted way too sour and  odd, but hey, I was exploring so you won't have to.",3.0
"First time visiting, I would say the two of us were impressed.  We had a lovely evening outside.  While the service was a bit slow if was mainly because they spent a lot of time talking at the tables.  Our waiter did a great job describing the wines and brought out several out for us to taste.  We were impressed because his descriptions actually seemed to describe what we eventually tasted.  Either we are suggestible, or we found a guy who tastes things the same way that we do.We also had some great cheeses, which we were lucky enough to find at Fairway the next weekend.  Definitely going back.  $60 for two people enjoying wine and a couple of small plates.",4.0
I was about to write a decent review food-wise until I saw the I SAW A ROACH review of this place which got me a bit distressed. Well too late now since I've eaten there a few hours ago and my roaches are digested. So the place came highly recommended by my folks who for some reason decided that it was definitely European and most probably Czech and kept calling it the Czech restaurant. When I spoke in Russian remarking why we have not one waitress but two my parents shushed me saying that these Czechs also understand Russian. For 92 dollars we got brunch for 3 people and had 2 servers. Man these Czechs got it all backwards.,3.0
"I have been to The Castello Plan twice. Both times were good!I sat at the bar on both occasions. I am a big fan of bar seating, as it makes it much easier to learn about a restaurant, its staff, its fans, and of course, its food.The first time I went to Castello, I was with a friend and terribly sadface over some life stuff. The staff was awesome and very forthcoming with the delicious eats and the wine. Both the delicious food and the terrific service improved my mood.Tonight I went in again after a delightful day. Again I got delicious eats. The owner and staff are lovely and friendly without being in your face. They are open to curious customers and enjoy talking about the food they offer. I learned that the chef has Eastern European influences, which is why one dish I had contained sunflower oil instead of olive, and why dill was dominant. (Again, I recommend sitting at the bar if you like learning stuff while consuming incredibly tasty things. But be cool. Don't pester when it's busy. Good customer fu dictates that if you like asking questions, you should probably dine during the quiet times.)Castello Plan may not be the bestest place if you are the kind of hungry that requires three burgers and ALL THE FRIES to satisfy. But for the rest of us, it's worth a stop in to sample some great treats. I love living near a wine bar that also cares about dinnertime. And brunch time. I plan to return.",4.0
"Great atmosphere and very attentive, friendly staff. Why the low star rating? The prices and portions of food are horrendous.Usually, when a main dish is ordered from a higher-scale place, it often comes with ""extras"" and sides. I ordered the ricotta and fruit crepe for brunch (it was $7). My sad little crepe came on a very small dish, and very, very cold (I understand cheese + crepe = cold, but this was like ice cold). Would it have been too terrible to include a small bowl of fruit, or some potatoes on the side? Something?We also ordered a couple of sides: Hash browns and chorizo. They were alright, but really something I could have done at home for much cheaper. The hash browns were just diced potatoes that were cooked on a skillet--No seasoning at all, not even salt. The chorizo was tasty, but cooked in the same manner as the potatoes. So I'm more inclined to applaud their chorizo supplier than their rendition of it.And, well, there's the pot of tea. They added two teabags to a large teapot. Clearly there weren't enough bags added, so the tea was too watery and only marginally better than plain water.Needless to say, we have no plans to go back. This is the kind of place that I'm afraid Ditmas Park is turning into: Overpriced; mediocre; and dare I say, pretentious. The Farm is also very expensive and serves the same kind of food, but at least the food seems special and not something I can just make at home.",2.0
"I so badly wanted to love Castello Plan. It's a beautiful space, and one of the few bar/bistros of its kind near my apartment. But both times I've gone I've been disappointed bordering on annoyed. I won't be back.For a neighborhood spot, the atmosphere is stuffy -- pretentious even. The prices (high) and portion sizes (teeny) seem designed to underscore this air of cultivated superiority. It's the sort of affect you expect in a certain breed of Manhattan restaurant, but it feels out of place in Ditmas. For me, it's the little things that grate most at a place like this: the way the owner skulks around his small domain scowling; the fact that the $12 happy hour cheese & wine special came with two small pieces of bread and the teeniest side salad I've ever seen (they couldn't have thrown in one more grape tomato, a couple more sprigs of basil?). There's just a stinginess, a lack of warmth and hospitality. It feels like the opposite of what a neighborhood wine bar should be. It's the opposite of other nearby gems, like the wonderful Sycamore or Vox Pop, which feel like centers of the community.",3.0

We requested that they turn it down, but they wouldn't do it, as it was ""supposed"" to be so loud (we couldn't hear each other and it was only 11.30 am!). That response was rather strange, as I assumed that the customers' preference should be attended to rather than refused. The next time I came over with another friend our order was  mistakenly served to the couple at the next table. After a few minutes, they hailed the waiter who realized the mistake and simply took the plates over to our table, even though the couple has moved the bread around. That was off putting, but when we expressed concern they told us the food had not been touched and they would simply bring us a new serving of bread. Still, being  handed food that spent some time on another table was not the best service I'd say. That same day, the waitress who was serving us was making us rearrange all the food on the tiny table by ourselves (which is a problem -- why have tables so small that two dishes for two people don't even fit?) rather than helping us out. I thought that as a waitress familiar with the place, with the dishes etc. it was she who was supposed to know how to fit it all on the table. It was strange to have to be taking care of that by myself: I actually ended up having to hold one of the plates on my lap. I will go back to Castello's Plan because the food is a treat. But I do hope that the service will improve. It is a shame that a lovely place like that falls short in this regard.",3.0
"My biggest gripe these days is the lackluster service in this city.  Not always, but more often than it should be.  I have been in the restaurant business for thirteen (""sigh"") years.  I'm all too familiar with catering to demanding customers, smiling when I don't want to, responding to questions when the answer seems so obvious, etc, but sometimes you just have to do it.  It's our job!  That being said, lately my  reviews weigh more heavily on the service I receive than how much I liked or disliked the food.  Okay, now that that's off my chest; The Castello Plan has fantastic, friendly, attentive service and a killer wine list.  I have not eaten here YET but will be back soon to do so.",5.0
"Nice, cozy wine bar on Cortelyou Rd. with outside seating that allows smoking, which I wasn't thrilled about. Great beer and wine list, which attentive waitstaff can help navigate if you specify your preferences. They will gladly bring you a taste as well.Food menu changes frequently. Their crostinis used to be fantastic, and there was more to choose from, but not anymore. Two sprats in oil with lemon wedges for $6 when you can easily get a whole tin of them from any Russian store for less than $2.50 - ridiculous. Charcuterie  and cheese plate has a great presentation and plenty of side items to dip or garnish your mini-sandwich, yet the portions remain tiny. We got 5 for $25 deal and that made things a bit better.Special grape jello dessert with ricotta cheese tasted way too sour and  odd, but hey, I was exploring so you won't have to.",3.0
"First time visiting, I would say the two of us were impressed.  We had a lovely evening outside.  While the service was a bit slow if was mainly because they spent a lot of time talking at the tables.  Our waiter did a great job describing the wines and brought out several out for us to taste.  We were impressed because his descriptions actually seemed to describe what we eventually tasted.  Either we are suggestible, or we found a guy who tastes things the same way that we do.We also had some great cheeses, which we were lucky enough to find at Fairway the next weekend.  Definitely going back.  $60 for two people enjoying wine and a couple of small plates.",4.0
I was about to write a decent review food-wise until I saw the I SAW A ROACH review of this place which got me a bit distressed. Well too late now since I've eaten there a few hours ago and my roaches are digested. So the place came highly recommended by my folks who for some reason decided that it was definitely European and most probably Czech and kept calling it the Czech restaurant. When I spoke in Russian remarking why we have not one waitress but two my parents shushed me saying that these Czechs also understand Russian. For 92 dollars we got brunch for 3 people and had 2 servers. Man these Czechs got it all backwards.,3.0
"I have been to The Castello Plan twice. Both times were good!I sat at the bar on both occasions. I am a big fan of bar seating, as it makes it much easier to learn about a restaurant, its staff, its fans, and of course, its food.The first time I went to Castello, I was with a friend and terribly sadface over some life stuff. The staff was awesome and very forthcoming with the delicious eats and the wine. Both the delicious food and the terrific service improved my mood.Tonight I went in again after a delightful day. Again I got delicious eats. The owner and staff are lovely and friendly without being in your face. They are open to curious customers and enjoy talking about the food they offer. I learned that the chef has Eastern European influences, which is why one dish I had contained sunflower oil instead of olive, and why dill was dominant. (Again, I recommend sitting at the bar if you like learning stuff while consuming incredibly tasty things. But be cool. Don't pester when it's busy. Good customer fu dictates that if you like asking questions, you should probably dine during the quiet times.)Castello Plan may not be the bestest place if you are the kind of hungry that requires three burgers and ALL THE FRIES to satisfy. But for the rest of us, it's worth a stop in to sample some great treats. I love living near a wine bar that also cares about dinnertime. And brunch time. I plan to return.",4.0
"Great atmosphere and very attentive, friendly staff. Why the low star rating? The prices and portions of food are horrendous.Usually, when a main dish is ordered from a higher-scale place, it often comes with ""extras"" and sides. I ordered the ricotta and fruit crepe for brunch (it was $7). My sad little crepe came on a very small dish, and very, very cold (I understand cheese + crepe = cold, but this was like ice cold). Would it have been too terrible to include a small bowl of fruit, or some potatoes on the side? Something?We also ordered a couple of sides: Hash browns and chorizo. They were alright, but really something I could have done at home for much cheaper. The hash browns were just diced potatoes that were cooked on a skillet--No seasoning at all, not even salt. The chorizo was tasty, but cooked in the same manner as the potatoes. So I'm more inclined to applaud their chorizo supplier than their rendition of it.And, well, there's the pot of tea. They added two teabags to a large teapot. Clearly there weren't enough bags added, so the tea was too watery and only marginally better than plain water.Needless to say, we have no plans to go back. This is the kind of place that I'm afraid Ditmas Park is turning into: Overpriced; mediocre; and dare I say, pretentious. The Farm is also very expensive and serves the same kind of food, but at least the food seems special and not something I can just make at home.",2.0
"I so badly wanted to love Castello Plan. It's a beautiful space, and one of the few bar/bistros of its kind near my apartment. But both times I've gone I've been disappointed bordering on annoyed. I won't be back.For a neighborhood spot, the atmosphere is stuffy -- pretentious even. The prices (high) and portion sizes (teeny) seem designed to underscore this air of cultivated superiority. It's the sort of affect you expect in a certain breed of Manhattan restaurant, but it feels out of place in Ditmas. For me, it's the little things that grate most at a place like this: the way the owner skulks around his small domain scowling; the fact that the $12 happy hour cheese & wine special came with two small pieces of bread and the teeniest side salad I've ever seen (they couldn't have thrown in one more grape tomato, a couple more sprigs of basil?). There's just a stinginess, a lack of warmth and hospitality. It feels like the opposite of what a neighborhood wine bar should be. It's the opposite of other nearby gems, like the wonderful Sycamore or Vox Pop, which feel like centers of the community.",3.0
"I am so happy this is right around the corner from my boyfriend's place, because we both agree we'll be going back soon!When the sommelier came over, he inquired after my preferences, and then went to get three bottles and three glasses. ""I think I'll taste some with you,"" he told us. Each glass he would give an abbreviated, broad description, (""full, fruity, bold) which was nice because it's a proven scientific fact that you cannot detect five different notes in every wine, no matter how romantic it sounds. Then while my boyfriend and I followed protocol (swirl, smell, taste) he would knock it back like a frat boy taking a shot. We suspected he might be drunk, or maybe he didn't even work there and was just hanging out. Doesn't matter because we were super happy with the wine he helped us choose. He also pointed at the Brooklyn borough president who was schmoozing at a nearby table. When our friends joined us, we ordered two appetizer plates, and an assortment of cheeses and prosciutto. The wooden platter of prosciutto and cheeses was amazing, but the duck really took the award for the night. I've never had such a sumptuous mouth-feel before. We tasted our friends' sweet potato dish, it was hard to refrain from stealing their plate and eating the rest! Dessert was amazing too: bite-sized chocolate tulips. I would give you a fuller description, but by this point my faculties were severely impaired. I also liked their presentation: vintage-looking silver and raw cut wood platters. We all had such a great time, I couldn't imagine a nicer night.",5.0
"Sweet looking spot... But that's the only positive thing I have to say about it. Keep in mind this review is only based on their brunch (decided on Costello when we encountered a 45 minute wait at Farm).So I ordered my usual brunch dish, a vegetarian omelet - this one with goat cheese and tomato. It also said it came with a salad. It was $12. What I was served was a thin, flat overbooked omelet with three tiny pieces of tomato on top and a teaspoon of goat cheese plopped on top. And the salad?? The salad was three pieces of withered mesclun draped on top of the omelet. So disappointing. On the coffee front, the choices were small or large French press. No refills on  my coffee = sad me.So do yourself a favor- if there is a wait at the Farm, or you want a brunch worth your time and money- head over to Cinco de Mayo for some tasty huevos rancheros.",2.0
"My friend and I visited on a beautiful Sunday and sat in the really cute outdoor space.  The menu is simple. We had olives and one of the cheeses for appetizers......delicious. For the main dish we both had the grilled fish. It had the perfect amount of seasoning and was so tasty that, though this meal was two weeks ago, I'M STILL THINKING ABOUT IT! We topped off with their homemade ice cream (I'm dribbling). You could totally taste each ingredient....lavendar and an olive sea salt blend. Service was great and the waiter was very thoroughly in describing the wines. Highly recommended!!",5.0
"One of my top 5 don't-miss places to go when I visit my daughter. Great wine, yummy nibbles and the atmosphere is perfection.

"There is nothing I don't like about Castello Plan. The end.Ok, ok, I'll be more specific. It's convenient for me (if you don't live in Ditmas Park, don't wonder about the extra half-star I gave due to convenience), being only a few blocks from my apartment. The atmosphere is great. It's chill, cozy, dimly lit, usually comfortable temperature, though I worry about their HVAC system/circulation. The outside part is also a bit cramped, but I can tell that it's cramped from my comfy table indoors, so there's really no reason to complain.Free music! On Mondays and Thursdays there is at least one band/artist. I've always liked the music I heard there. I don't know if I can accurately characterize the ""type"" of musicians that play there, because I've only been there on three of the free music days. I do think they stick to more of a folksy, jazzy, soft sound, rather than some of the louder, heavier tunes you might hear across the street[ish] at Sycamore. Considering the lighting and decor though, I always walk in there feeling the ""folk.""And finally, the food. All I have to say is, ""Iiiiiit's RABBIT THYME!"" One of their menu items which has been out for the last couple of months is called ""It's Rabbit Thyme."" It's probably gone now, actually. They do reinvent their menu on a regular basis, which is great. The dinner menu is somewhat limited (their extensive wine and beer lists probably make up for that), but everything the chef puts on there is pure genius deliciousness! I prefer to grab 3-5 small plates unless there's an entree that looks particularly delicious on the ever-changing menu. Smoked sprat crostini, onion potato truffle puffs, nom nom nom. Can I have it?I can't believe I live within mere blocks of such genius. This place makes me proud to live in DP.",5.0

The staff is friendly and unpretentious, with a warm feeling of camaraderie in the space, which is so nice to see. And then there is the food. Ah, the wonderful, tasty, savor-each-bite food, cooked to perfection every time. The Beef Stew is unbelievable. I can't stop getting it. Only downside is it can be tough to get a seat on weekend nights. What can I say? It's popular. Monday and Thursday have live music, which is also always very well suited to the mood, always acoustic, blue grassy, jazzy, old-timey, jug band or ukulele type stuff.",5.0
"I want to love this place. I really do. I have a happy association from the time I came here with my sister and her husband to celebrate the purchase of their new home.  But my last experience here left much to be desired. I came here with a date on a Wednesday night. I chose The Castello Plan because I wanted to be in a romantic setting, and because of their curated wine selection. In previous visits, the gentleman behind the bar (who was not here on this night) had been so good about recommending wine according to my  likes/dislikes, will suggest cheese pairings based on wine selected, and was generally knowledgeable and pleasant. I was expecting the same, and was terribly disappointed and embarrassed when we were greeted with the opposite. The lady who served us had this ""I can't be bothered"" way about her from the start. I'm sorry, am I keeping you from something? Her impatience was palpable as we were going through the wine list. I asked for a suggestion based on what i usually like, and it seemed to me like she was going ""eeny meeny miney mo"" in her head before settling on a red. Meanwhile, at the table next to us, a couple was fortunate to have someone describe their selections down to the region, type of grape, tannins and so on. Our server wasn't exactly rude -- but she wasn't trying to be helpful at all. And I'm sorry, but if you're going to have the nerve to call yourself something as pretentious as The Castello Plan, then you'd better deliver on that implied promise of a stellar gastronomic experience. When I asked her about cheese pairings, we got more of the same can't-be-bothered indifference. At this point I just wanted to be left with my date, so I said, ""You know what? Don't worry about it. We'll figure it out. Thanks."" But here's the real kicker: the next day, my date asked me if I was okay. Seems he had terrible digestive problems, which he is sure is from the oysters. Yikes! Embarrassment complete.",3.0

"This is a new place that just opened up this past weekend. My friend and I stopped by just to check it out after a late dinner at Mimi's on Sunday.  When we sat at the bar we were greeted by the owner (it could have been just a manager.)Although it is wine bar they do offer a small selection of about 12 bottles of Belgian beer, and one on tap. However, the tap was not working that night (the owner explained that the tap system was missing a component.) We only had one beer, so I can not really comment on the wine. We were told that the bar will rotate its stock of 12 Belgian beers only, some of them from microbreweries, and some from more well known breweries. The staff was very friendly and the bartender was very nice. They also offer some small food dishes that I hope to try next time.So far this is a good bar to visit, and since there is another two bars in the area, this is a good place to go if the others are full, or you want a bit of a change.

"Came here for brunch with my friend and her baby.  We had originally intended to go to Farm on Adderly, but the place was packed along with many of the other places we tried afterwards.  We settled on Castello Plan because there was an empty table.  This place is more like bar than a restaurant with only a few tables.  The chairs are really uncomfortable and they do not have high chairs so it's not really a place for families.  There is no real kitchen and the food is cooked behind the bar on a plancha and burners.  The ventilation was not very good and your clothes will definitely smell of the food you just ate which I do not like.  We had the Castello Plan breakfast which was pretty good, your standard egg dish with fried pieces of chorizo.  The highlight was the half grapefruit with sea salt and honey which was unexpectantly good.  The honey and sea salt really balanced out the tartness of the grapefruit.  Now I must try this at home.",3.0

Have been here a couple of times when they were pretty much closing and let us have a snack or glass of wine, super accommodating.

"I was really looking forward to dining here and brought a friend who is visiting from Italy. I'm sad to say that I was VERY unimpressed with the food. We were dining late, at about 10pm, which was maybe a contributing factor, but my chicken confit was heavy and dry and the pieces of squash on the side were EXTREMELY dry.

"I have been here a few times, usually just for a drink. The selection of wines and beers here is just astounding--I've never seen a place with just an arrayed selection of varietals and prices. Fantastic.I spent New Year's Eve 2010/2011 here at their 10pm seating: 10 courses + 1/2 bottle of wine per person + a glass of prosecco to start + a glass of prosecco to ring in the New Year at Midnight all for $60/person.An AMAZING deal in New York. And so well worth it.The mushroom-onion and fontina tart is one of the most amazing treats of deliciousness ever. EVER.The poached shrimp was way overcooked.And the meal proceeded in that manner: some things amazing, some not so amazing, but nothing utterly unacceptable & all in all a delicious evening.",4.0
"Second time at Castello last night. Both times I really appreciated the look and feel of the place. Dark, candles, well-appointed rustic furniture, and out on the patio, attractive (if still growing) vines growing up and around the wooden frame of the space. And the bathroom is indeed very cool. I love maps and history, so the name of this place totally tickles my fancy.I'm not much of a wine connoisseur, but when we wanted to order a few bottles last night, our server spent about five minutes with us to get us exactly what we wanted. One issue was that several of the cheaper-end bottles of white were gone, but we were still able to enjoy some really nice wine in our price range. I was pleased. Water glasses were refilled a lot, too.I'm not a smoker, but some of my friends were really quite excited that there were ashtrays on the patio.",4.0
"Came here for brunch with my friend and her baby.  We had originally intended to go to Farm on Adderly, but the place was packed along with many of the other places we tried afterwards.  We settled on Castello Plan because there was an empty table.  This place is more like bar than a restaurant with only a few tables.  The chairs are really uncomfortable and they do not have high chairs so it's not really a place for families.  There is no real kitchen and the food is cooked behind the bar on a plancha and burners.  The ventilation was not very good and your clothes will definitely smell of the food you just ate which I do not like.  We had the Castello Plan breakfast which was pretty good, your standard egg dish with fried pieces of chorizo.  The highlight was the half grapefruit with sea salt and honey which was unexpectantly good.  The honey and sea salt really balanced out the tartness of the grapefruit.  Now I must try this at home.",3.0
"The  food is good.  The portions were  small for dinner for the prices charged. They fill the wine glasses half way and cost about $9 per glass, although the selections were good.  On a Saturday night, the restaurant was filled with trendy mid 20- 30 something types trying to impress each other and between them and the background music, it was very noisy .  Too noisy in my opinion,  for a quiet Saturday night meal.  Maybe on another night it could be better.  I think I would try it again keeping the aforementioned issues in mind.  My wife left her wallet in the restaurant and we were able to retieve it  without a problem about 1/2 hour later.",3.0
Great place for cheese and wine. Very friendly waiter. Tiny kitchen puts out some surprisingly great food. Great date night spot. I keep on going back,5.0
"Cannot say enough good things! We live in the neighborhood and have been here many times - for dinner, for brunch on the weekend, for a nightcap or latenight snack - and have never been disappointed.  The food is always excellent (though not the healthiest! just walking in you smell delicious butter), the atmosphere is intimate, cozy, and beautiful (like being inside a ship), and the staff really goes out of their way. Have been here a couple of times when they were pretty much closing and let us have a snack or glass of wine, super accommodating. A great place for a date, taking your parents to dinner if they're visiting, or really any occasion. They also do lots of cool events like all you can eat mussels Monday nights and live music. Love it!",5.0
"I was really looking forward to dining here and brought a friend who is visiting from Italy. I'm sad to say that I was VERY unimpressed with the food. We were dining late, at about 10pm, which was maybe a contributing factor, but my chicken confit was heavy and dry and the pieces of squash on the side were EXTREMELY dry. My friend's fluke was simply run-of-the-mill. One wine was much better than the other (the Syrah being the loser).",2.0
"Dropped in here the other night with a friend when we saw they were having a ""Snow Day Special"" - glass of wine and a bowl of chili for $10. Beautiful interior and very friendly, attentive staff. I was worried the house red was going to be meh, but it was surprisingly good, easy-drinking. And the chili was a hit, too: okra and white beans, and big slices of thick sourdough bread. Very happy overall with the experience.My one complaint is with ventilation - the open-air stove behind the bar and a cold night without the windows open means the room can get a little grill-y at times. But other than that, I was really happy -- will come back again.",4.0

"ive been to the castello plan a few times.the good: the softly steampunk design of the establishment, both inside and out, is downright gorgeous. the food is delicious, and the is service attentive. the bad: pretension. the castello plan is one of the most pretentious places i've been to in the city. i don't know how this is possible, i mean its in brooklyn, eclectic ditmas park no less. every time i walk in to the establishment i feel weird... remember that odd feeling you used to get back in high school, the one you got when you somehow found yourself in the middle of a different social circle? yea. perhaps i need to become a regular at the castello plan to shake that 'outsider' feeling. but alas, i refuse to become a regular there because along with the pretension comes relatively overpriced, stingily portioned food. somehow, despite the inviting atmosphere, everything feels a bit too calculated. that said, what do i know. i'm fully aware that im not a 40 something w.a.s.p. and 40 something w.a.s.p. seems to be the crowd the castello plan aims to serve. its working for them....(to be fair, if one comes for brunch, the pretension isnt really there. brunch 4 stars)",2.0

The waiter was continually prompt, pleasant, and helpful even though we were there several hours and we were pretty much ordering just drinks and a few apps.

Someone in the group compared our rounded booth with wooden walls to being in a hot tub!! It was a nice intimate setting for catching up with a few friends.Cons: My only minor quibble would be that $25 seemed a bit dear for portions of cheese we got, looked to be more about a $20 value to me.

"I've been to The Castello Plan several times and although I have had a few good experiences here, I will not return, and I can't recommend them. For the most part their food was good.

The long waits turned me off a good deal, but I returned there again for brunch at my friend's request. Here's where things really went sour. After pouring some steamed milk into my french press coffee I noticed something inside the milk jar. It was a roach!! Gross!I wasn't completely repulsed since I hadn't taken a sip yet. It was a little disturbing, but I know that no restaurant is immune from pests. What was more disturbing was our waiter's reaction. His exact words when I told him were ""Oh Ok"". He took the coffee back and asked me if I wanted another, to which I declined. There was no apology. We expected maybe they would bring out a complimentary coffee or appetizer, or maybe provide a small discount off the check, customer service 101 right? Nope, that didn't happen. I guess it was no big deal to them. What's worse is that it wasn't some young punk serving us, it was a grown man, possibly the owner. Terrible experience!",2.0

"I'm giving it 5 stars because I liked everything about it - but I'm no wine bar expert, so take my amateur review for what it's worth. Had a short wait for a table at Mimi's and Mimi herself suggested we go have a glass of wine two doors down. We were greeted by a very friendly hostess who was not invasive, but who looked downright happy to see us. The place was almost full, and the three of us filled up a table by the window. We explained we were sent by Mimi's and the hostess at Castello seemed appreciative of that. So I don't think they had some sort of deal worked out - it just seemed like Mimi wanted us to have a comfortable place to wait, and it makes very good neighborhood sense to help out the new guy on the block. Cortelyou Road is starting to percolate with restaurant and bar choices - very exciting.Anyway, the newly opened Castello Plan is absolutely beautiful. With fresh flowers in the window, NO smell of stale beer, and not a moldy peanut in sight, it doesn't feel like a bar. Maybe that's what wine bars are known for? I don't know - since baby not really on the bar scene anymore - wine or otherwise. The music was on the loud side, but the table was cozy enough for the three of us to start our night out talking and visiting and catching up. I had a syrrah from morocco based on the waiter's suggestion (which was based on my using my limited wine vocabulary to explain what I used to like) - it was tart and sweet and got me tipsy almost immediately. I enjoyed it very much. My friends both tried a white that seems to turn to honey in the mouth - that's how the waiter explained it and I took a sip and had to agree. Not the cloying thick honey texture, but definitely the delicious flavor. Don't remember what it was called, but would definitely have a glass next time.Wine by the glass or bottle. I think $8 and up for a glass. Beers on the back page. Small tapas menu, too, but we were headed to Mimi's for dinner so we did not have anything.Felt like a nice place to come with friends or a date. Really most struck by how beautiful it was - oh! And unless I'm wrong, it looks like they will have outdoor seating on the side when things warm up - can't wait to see that.",5.0
"This place is an excellent addition to the (slowly burgeoning) Ditmas Park wining/dining scene.  The wine list is terrific, w/ an old world emphasis; the atmosphere is great, cozy but not cramped; and the servers are friendly (but not intrusively so) and knowledgeable.  I look forward to enjoying the outdoor space in a few weeks.  This spot is clearly a labor of love, and it would be hard to go wrong here.",5.0
"Had walked by this intimate wine/tapas place numerous times as it's near my home.  On summer nights, often with live music, it always looked so inviting.I finally stopped in on this past Saturday night to have a few drinks with a date and I must say I enjoyed my time there very much.  Castello Plan has just a nice, easy-going vibe going on.  Although I am not at all a wine drinker, I still enjoyed myself (my date and I drank cider).  I also enjoyed the cheese plate which was attractively presented and came with some nice ""yum yums"" (blueberries, almonds, honey).I liked that the sommelier/bartender was attentive and knowledgeable but not at all pretentious - which can be a real mood killer at wine bars, imho.I'd definitely like to go back - perhaps to try some of the delicious looking deserts with a selection from their dessert wines.  It's very nice to have a place like this that's convenient to me without having to shlep to Manhattan.---UPDATE:I ate here again August/September 2014.  They now had a full dinner menu and hard liquor, not just wine, etc.  The Ditmas Park 'hood is in the middle of gentrification and Cortelyou has added several eateries and stores.  Had a good time sitting outside, pleasant server, and drink and dinner was good.  (My memory is not so great, but I am pretty sure I had a fish dish).  Still would recommend.  I had a different date this time that also didn't go anywhere, but it's a good date location!",4.0
"Excellent wine selection; great Belgian beer selection. Nice place to meet friends for a laid back drink. Food selections  (mostly for noshing, not a full-on dinner) are very, very good (especially the fluke sashimi). My only criticism was that the first two times I was there, the music was exceptionally loud for a cozy bar, but the last time I was there it was more reasonable. Apparently they have a great brunch offering now, though I haven't tried it.",4.0
"This is primarily a wine bar, and I'm not a wine expert. But I do love beer, and their beer list (selections from Belgium, primarily) is mouth watering. More importantly, the place is just a great hangout. The owner, a guy named Ben, treats both the place and his customers with real passion. You really feel like his 'guest'. He even hung out with us for a while one night, helping us get to know the spirits from his perspective. The food is limited (don't come with a big appetitie) but what they have is delicious. The market salad was farmer's market fresh and the mushroom crostini were outstanding.  It's the kind of place you go and spend hours and hours, laughing with friends. I hope to heck this place stays a fixture in the area. It's both fun and special.",5.0
"We are thrilled that The Castello Plan is in the neighborhood on Cortelyou Road.  The entire experience on Monday night was fabulous - the staff, ambience and extremely well prepared food.  The grilled shrimp-pesto crostini was delectable with the freshest pesto.  This was paired with a glass of Proseco for the happy hour special.  Dinner was an incredible duck confit with fingerling potatoes and rabbit with sweet potato puree with truffle oil.  They created a unique atmosphere and are a welcome addition to the neighborhood.  There is live music some nights of the week - and they even have a late night menu and the kitchen serves until 1 am.  They were reviewed in the NY Times on July 21st and they clearly deserved the positive appraisal.",5.0
"went here for ""barnyard night"" stinky cheese and stinky wine. off the chain.  sweet and friendly service.  heard they have good ""live music"", will check that out soon.",5.0
I LOVE this restaurant.  It is a great place to meet up with friends for dinner but it is also a great place to just go to the bar and have a glass of wine.  The staff is fantastic and everything on the menu is tasty.,5.0
"This is one of the best wine bars in the entire city, and it's right here in Ditmas. We DP residents are very very lucky indeed. I was first attracted to the place because they carry some of the unusual wines that I'm particularly into (although many people can't stand them). The staff there indulges my tastes and biases, while introducing me, not pushily, to other stuff that they think I might like, and it's a winner almost every time. The food plates are incredible. The duck confit, in particular is really hard to turn down. This is a neighborhood gem, and well worth the trip even from the other end of the city!",5.0
"hidden gem. it has to be one of the best restaurants in the whole city. Every dish I've tried (I've been 3-4 times) has been astoundingly tasty. I love this place and I hope that it will have a long, long life on Cortelyou Road..",5.0
"I'm giving it 5 stars because I liked everything about it - but I'm no wine bar expert, so take my amateur review for what it's worth. Had a short wait for a table at Mimi's and Mimi herself suggested we go have a glass of wine two doors down. We were greeted by a very friendly hostess who was not invasive, but who looked downright happy to see us. The place was almost full, and the three of us filled up a table by the window. We explained we were sent by Mimi's and the hostess at Castello seemed appreciative of that. So I don't think they had some sort of deal worked out - it just seemed like Mimi wanted us to have a comfortable place to wait, and it makes very good neighborhood sense to help out the new guy on the block. Cortelyou Road is starting to percolate with restaurant and bar choices - very exciting.Anyway, the newly opened Castello Plan is absolutely beautiful. With fresh flowers in the window, NO smell of stale beer, and not a moldy peanut in sight, it doesn't feel like a bar. Maybe that's what wine bars are known for? I don't know - since baby not really on the bar scene anymore - wine or otherwise. The music was on the loud side, but the table was cozy enough for the three of us to start our night out talking and visiting and catching up.

"While there are plenty of great restaurant options on Cortelyou Road, Castello Plan is by far my favorite! I live in the neighborhood and frequent this cozy little wine bar. Their wine selection is top of the line, and the wait staff is highly knowledgeable and able to make great recommendations. The food, which is miraculously prepared entirely behind the bar, is incredible!!! I've never been let down by an entrée from their seasonal menu. My only complaint is that when the menu changes I can no longer order my favorites (particularly the yam crostini, which is to die for). One nice down time to go which you might not think of is brunch on the weekends. The crowd is light and the coffee is excellent, complete with a personal beaker of warm milk. My words just can't say enough, you really must try it for yourself!",5.0
"I rate this place so highly with one caveat -- quality is good, quantity, at least for brunch, is small -- and by small I mean that portions are more tapas sized. Went there yesterday for brunch with two other adults and two children and I was the only one who was happy. I don't live in Brooklyn but understand this restaurant is a much-welcomed addition to the Ditmas Park neighborhood. My husband and sister-in-law both ordered the Castello Plan breakfast (I think that's what it was called). It was about $14 or 15 and consisted of as I recall, one poached egg (perhaps two) one strip of overcooked house-cured bacon and about a 4 x 3 inch piece of toast with butter and apricot jam. My husband had a meltdown when he saw how small the portions were. My nieces had the (small) ricotta crepes with fruit compote and I had the grilled cheese with scallion which was accompanied by a butter-poached egg. My dish was the most substantial in terms of being filling. Now I loathe the American trend of quantity over quality so this was the inverse, but at times it seemed overly precious and everybody but me left the table still hungry (and in fact went on to get a slice of pizza). On the other hand I do get the sense that the food is selected and prepared with great care. My grilled cheese was perfectly executed -- although I wasn't too keen on the poached egg that was served on some sort of salsa that I didn't find complementary. Just be aware that most of the entrees verged on appetizer size.",4.0
"I love this place - I live in the Ditmas area and can't wait to go back. This is chic yet earthy - a perfect balance.  It is nicely decorated with great attention to details. In addition to the wine being great, the food is delicious. We are so happy The Castello Plan is here!",4.0
