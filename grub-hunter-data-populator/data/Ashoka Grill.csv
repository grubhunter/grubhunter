"The older gentleman who I believe is the owner is very nice! I usually order for delivery but this time I came in  and placed an order for pickup. Not only was it quick and accurate service, he gave me (and also another patron who was waiting on her order) a complimentary mango lassi. Food and delivery service has always been great but today's experience earns them a definite 5 stars. Also, their samosas are amazing and so is their paneer saag, paneer makhani, and their malai kofta (yes, I'm a vegetarian lol). This is the best Indian food that I've tried in the Flatbush area so far.",5.0
If you live nearby and want curry in a hurry order in or just pick up This place is pretty damn solid but you poops will not be,3.0
"First, the bad: It took slightly over 90 minutes from the time I ordered until my food was delivered.Now, the good: The food was fantastic! I've eaten lots of Indian food, and in all honesty, this take-out was as good as the best I've ever had. I would give the food five stars but for the delviery experience, and I'll certainly try again; any place can have an off night.",4.0
"This is my go to spot in the neighborhood when I want Indian food. This review is only based on my takeout experience. Ordering takeout from Ashoka is always a pleasant, simple and satisfying experience. I have never had a problem and the food always arrives, quickly and delicious. It's almost just as good as being there and eating in the restaurant. I have sampled many of their dishes and I truly can't complain about one. The chicken tiki masala is amazing, the curry dishes are all amazing and samosas and nann bread are always perfect. You wouldn't expect that with delivery but like I said they definitely take pride in their food and it shows. The price point is fair but for what you get it really doesn't compare. Everything here is perfectly seasoned never too spicy or bland but just the perfect amount of spice in every dish. They also have the option to adjust the spice level when you place your order which is really great! If you are bored with your Friday night wings and pizza, give this place a try you won't be disappointed.",4.0
The worse service I have ever seen in my life the waiter was trying to force us to order what he wanted and ignored us when we didn't listen and it was cold like winter inside no heater and only one waiter answering phones before taking care of customers sitting there 2 tables including ours got up and left,1.0
"A hole in the wall from street view but inside Ashoka Grill opens up to a nice seated restaurant. The food was delicious and the portions were large. Compared to most Indian places the price was also competitive. The service is what really stood out: the ""bread basket"" that came out once we were seated, the free appetizer, and at the end the server insisted on packing up our leftovers for us while we sat and waiting for the bill--and he brought us a free dessert with it! We went on a quiet Sunday before seeing a show at the college and I regret having a time limit because I would have ordered so much more.Must try: Malai Kofta (I pick this dish everywhere I go as my personal litmus test and their's is sweet, the sauce is rich but not drowning in butter, and the dumplings were large.",4.0
"Man, the pakora was nasty.  The kebab were microwaved.  The prices were too damn high!They brought us taco shells for an appetizer until the food came.  The hell do I want to eat taco shells for at an indian restaurant.  I ate them though lolThe butter chicken, chicken pea masala, and nan were off the chain though!  I dipped the garlic nan into the butter chicken and scooped some chickpeas on top for an incredible bite.Service here is good, they try hard to be helpful but yet again I was the only one in the restaurant so I better have all through attention!If you come here, get the butter chicken and skip the majority of the other foods because they are nasty.  Oh the prices are way too expensive, you get only a few pieces of butter chicken for 10 bucks.  I can go to jackson heights and have an ""all you can get buffet"" for 10 bucks.I might come back for nan n chickpeas.",3.0
I've had take away from this place a few times it can be very hit or miss. Tonight it was really bad. I asked for my food extra spicy it was super mild and not very tasty. The puri bread was so soaked in oil I couldn't eat it. I threw half the food away as it just wasn't tasty and was oily.,1.0
"This place is delicious. Never ate in the restaurant but always got takeout. Always delicious and they had a dinner deal with naan, your choice of curry and an appetizer. I definitely recommend the lamb curry and the samosas. The naan was hot and fresh. This is one of the best Indian food places I've ever tried. Oh, the prices are great!The only downside is the location - it's quite terrible. It's even far away from the junction, but it's still the only decent thing next to the Brooklyn College ""dorm.""",4.0

"This review is for take out. I usually order to go AT the restaurant or phone in orders for pick up. I absolutely adore this place. After my formerly favorite Indian restaurant in Park Slope went to the dogs I couldn't believe my luck when I stumbled onto this place.Pros: Food is fresh and well seasoned. Indian cuisine can be very spicy but Ashoka's dishes are never too peppery.They have a very balanced mix of oriental flavors.Affordable prices and large portions. There's always leftovers when we order from here.Staff are so sweet, polite and helpful they always make you feel welcome.Cons:Service can be slow BUT that's because it is clear that food is prepared fresh to order. However, the longer you have to wait, the more freebies they give you. (Usually bread, samosas or kheer.)So far I can vouch for the curry liver poori, channa saag, curry salmon...",4.0
"The food is pretty freakin fantastic. I was pleasantly surprised by this place. It's very easy to find right on Flatbush Ave just a few blocks from Brooklyn College. My friend and I came here for some good Indian food and that is exactly what we got! She ordered the chicken Tandoori and I got my standard chicken tikka masala for $11. Both were really really good. Especially the chicken tandoori! The food took forever to come but when it did, it was well cooked and fresh off the grill.My pet peeves: I'm not sure if someone called out for the night or if they usually are not busy but there seemed to be 3 people on staff that night: 1 person cooking, 1 person making deliveries, and one person waiting tables/answering phones. This annoyed me because it made the service a little slow, keep in mind, there was only one other party in the whole place and service was still slow. If the food wasn't so damn good I'd give this place two stars. The delivery dude continuously opened the door, understandably, but this invited the 15 degree weather to come in and greet us which wasn't fun. All in all, if you want amazing authentic Indian food for a good price. Please do come here. It is worth the wait. I will be back here since the food is delicious and since it's right in the neighborhood :) Honestly, even if it wasn't in my neighborhood I'd make the effort to come back. That's how good the food is!",4.0
"food: garlic naan wasn't bad. poori was awful. malai kofta was ok. goat ashkari (pretty sure that's what it was) was weird- drowned in spices to mask it's awfulness perhaps? those 3 sauces at the beginning though we're exceptionally good. also the mango lassi ain't bad.appearance: place needs some decoration. when we came in, there were no people but dirty tables. whole venue could use a nice coat of bleach maybe.service: guy put his hands all up on my dishes and utensils when setting the table. wanted my rice taken home until his dirty finger went in it. ugh whyyyytake a ride to bay ridge, Indian is way better over there.",2.0

I highly recommend this place if you're looking for decent indian food.",5.0
Delicious selection of vegetarian dishes. Great flavor and great service! whenever I am town I make a plan to order tons of indian food from Ashoka.

"Dropped by with my sister after taking a tour of Brooklyn College's campus. I chose this place because she's a vegetarian and I love Indian food, so I figured we'd both find something we liked. Very basic interior. Our waiter was such a sweet man with a goofy toothed smile you couldn't help but appreciate because he smiled so much. To start, we ordered two samosa apps, but I couldn't have any because they had corn kernels in them. It's such a silly thing to have an aversion to -- I totally admit that -- since I love nearly every kind of food out there and am quite adventurous. But I just can't get behind corn kernels. The way they burst in your mouth grosses me out, but I digress....  In any case, my sister enjoyed them a lot with the spicy green chutney and the tamarind sauce. For the entree, I had bhuna, which they prepared with goat for me instead of lamb -- even though it wasn't on the menu. It was a tad too spicy for me, but quite delicious. In any case, I certainly don't expect a stranger to prepare a dish to my exact spiciness threshold, so that isn't an issue for me. My sister had the vegetable curry, which she said was wonderful. The naans were so fluffy and hot when they came out. Prep time was average, but clearly everything was prepared fresh. I would visit again for sure. If we didn't have to rush to get a bus, we would have lingered and perhaps had a dessert. Maybe next time.",4.0

The pricing was right, the staff was great and welcoming when I went in there to pick up my food.

"I think the high stars of the other reviewers are based on the fact that it's way out there, deep in brooklyn, so people are saying ""I can't believe there is decent indian out here."",  I couldn't complain about the food, but I wouldn't rave about it either. I even remember thinking the price was high for what I was given, and the service seemed a little ""doddering"" , if that's even a word. Doddering (my personal dictionary): being served by an older uncle type who can't help you because of limited English, and whose attention is hard to get.I wouldn't go out of my way to come here but still I will give it a second chance when I'm in that hood and mood.",3.0
"- I like the fact that they are trying, but there are definitely better Indian places in the area- Not that the food was bad, or the service was terrible, I just think food is tastier at the other Indian establishments- Free sample dessert, with order is a plus",2.0

"i ordered almost an hour ago and the man on the phone is telling me that it is too busy for him to even check if they got my order or not. edit: it has been two hours now. i have called the restaurant for over 33 times because i was getting the busy tone for a while and now it's just endless ringing. i am not sure if my food is coming or not at this point. edit: two and half hours later, i am now being endlessly hung up on. i asked if my order ever went through and before i was hung up on, the man told me ""i dunno"" before just leaving me on the line. my second attempt at asking again, i got hung up on after being rushed off the phone promising me my food was on the way. i don't know what i am waiting for at this point and am not sure if my order was received.",1.0
Very poor costumer service. We placed our order an hour in advance. We when arrive to pick it up they tell us it won't be ready for another 25 mins.  Meanwhile we had picked up another order from the restaurant across the street and they finished it in 30 mins. They may need manage their labor better but this was unacceptable. Will not be eating their again.,1.0

"Great keema naan, amazing curry, flavorful chai and flawless service. Our waiter was extremely nice and the food was seasoned to perfection!

By far one of the best Indian spots I have ever eaten from. Delivery was fairly quick : 20 minutes. Food was hot and fresh. It was delicious. I had the chicken vindaloo and my husband the chicken curry. I also ordered a side of naan and it came with those delicious sauces. Will definitely order from here again.,5.0
"I've been a fan of Ashoka and would quite regularly order from them. However, it has gotten downhill since they received a lot of positive reviews here on Yelp.I ordered online Chicken Tikka Masala Special and Shrimp Curry Special. They forgot to include the naan breads, included only one set of sauces. And the major disappointment was that my chicken Tikka Masala is less than half of what it used to be - to be exact, the cup is smaller than that from a Chinese Take-Out. In addition, they watered down Mango Lassi and it no longer tastes like Mango or a yoghurt drink for that matter. What happened Ashoka Grill?",1.0
"I order from them using seamless. Every time I order, their food is hot, and incredibly delicious! Their chicken tikka masala is one of the best I've tried. I also appreciate the way they blend their spices. I've had Indian food that was way too  perfumey, or not spiced enough. It's not the best Indian food, but for where I live (where jerk chicken is the main option) it's really good.",5.0

"I love the spices in Indian cuisine, so I am happy that my neighborhood is seeing a new influx of restaurants. My colleagues and I eat lunch as a team every Friday and we're fortunate enough to have this restaurant nearby. We ordered the chicken tandoori with nan, biryani and samosa. Oh my gosh... DELICIOUS flavors. We were hooked and will definitely reorder soon. My absolute favorite appetizer is the vegetable samosa.",4.0

"For weeks my roommate and I waited for this place to open up. Everyday we would walk past and stare into the window hoping to see signs of progress.When they finally opened, they did NOT disappoint. The food was worth it. The food is incredible. The chicken biryani is definitely the best I've had on Flatbush Ave, and it is better than the biryani you get in Little Pakistan on Coney Island Ave. The food is not too greasy; it's clearly cooked with care for ingredients and perfect flavor. I've traveled to India and I can attest for the quality of this food. The appetizers are always fresh and piping hot, even if you have them delivered.We have dined in, ordered take out and had it delivered--excellent on all fronts.Not only is the food amazing, but the owners are so incredibly sweet. The woman who does most of the cooking even included little containers of rice pudding for free for us. They also did a great job with the decor. It's a modest building/place but they really put a lot of effort into the details of the place settings. So cute. I love this place and will be frequenting it every week. So glad they opened up!",5.0
"Got a few appetizers to take home to try the place out. I ordered Samosa, Alu tikki and chicken pakora (fritters). I must say, it was pretty damn good especially with all the little sauces that come with it. The Samosa and Alu tikki are pretty redundant, bad decision on my part. The only issue I had was the salt that was on the breading of the Samosa, very salty. Overall, very good - will be going back to get an entree or two.",4.0
"Best Indian delivery in Flatbush, bar none. Their customer service gives them the title. My girlfriend has food allergies and Ashoka has been beyond accommodating. They're willing to cook any curry with oil instead of clarified butter. When ordering delivery, the woman at the front desk even called us back to confirm that the oil they used was allergen free.The food itself is pretty decent, especially given the selection in our area. The banana pakora are fantastic, as well as the classics, Chicken Tikka Masala and Lamb Saag. The Masala is wonderfully creamy, and they'll spice it however you prefer. The free dessert with delivery is definitely a nice touch too.",5.0
Delicious! So excited to have this place open. Ordered from there for the first time today and it was fantastic. The Sambar was filled with fresh veggies and delicate spices. The malai kofta was creamy with just a hint of spice to make it interesting. The owners are really nice and gave me papadums while I waited. They also included a sample of rice pudding for free. Can't wait to try something else from the menu.,5.0
"A local friend is a regular at this restaurant and after she took me here, I *get* why!!!  :)We did a family style dinner and share several items:Bhindi Do Piaza -- Very nicely cooked.  Good flavor.Goan Shrimp Curry -- Shrimp was nicely cooked with good spices and coconut milk.Since we got this dish, we decided to pair it with the Peshwari Naan.  My friend never ordered it before this visit and I'm happy to say both she and I LOVED this naan!  Of course we also had basmati rice too.  :)In addition to this, they brought out papadums while we were waiting for our food, raita with our curry and a small rice pudding with cardamom tea to finish the meal.

Banana pakora for an appetizer. Really tasty a worth the try! The garlic naan was fresh, soft and not burnt at all (as opposed to other places I have been to). Saag curry is one of my favorite Indian dishes and this places honestly perfects it. Chicken korma was made very nicely with the chicken soft and not dried out. A must get is the tandoori chicken. Again, it was not burnt like many other restaurants, not dried out at all and very very flavorful. And the best of all... It is NOT DRENCHED IN OIL like many other Indian restaurants that I have been to. The mango lassi was not too sweet and made just right.

After tax and delivery we spend $17.50 on dinner for both of us, $8.75 each. Not too shabby! The special doesn't include all dinner options, though, so when I want the spiciest dish (vindaloo), I order it off the menu and get a naan and skip the samosas and it's pretty much the same price.The flavors are great and very authentic.

To top it off we ordered a mango salad which was 90 percent chopped ice berg lettuce, 9 percent diced unripe mango and 1 percent brown mustard on top. Are you kidding?

Not only was the food timing perfect but the food itself....EXQUISITE. It wasn't extra spicy. All the flavors together was made nice and mild.

We live somewhat far away so too bad that they don't deliver to us. We really liked every single dish and they even gave us a complimentary small bowl of rice pudding. We loved the panir pakora, banana pakora, chicken tikka masala, chicken makhani, chicken tandoori, mango lassi and all of the different breads. We especially liked the naan with coconuts, nuts, and raisins. We always order the assorted condiments to go with our order. Every single dish is spectacular. They don't judge us for our inability to eat spicy food and they always suggest something tasty. I truly recommend this place.",5.0
"very casual dining, was quiet empty when we got here for dinner on a friday night. its definitely a family business as the owners were our servers. they were caught up with their deliveries so she apologized that our food was going to take awhile. they were extremely attentive and also asked for reassurance if the food was good. it was good but we seriuosly waited way too long. she then brought out some dessert for us to try which was made of cheese and i knew i don't like cheese so i politely declined and i think she took offense. now that puts me in an awkward position. i would probably come back some day but hopefully the wait for the food isn't that long. we had the tandoori chicken and that was ginormous(great for guys!), and i tried the tikka masala which was good but i've had better. the naan was also on the plain side as i like it toasty and garlicky.",3.0
"I order from here all the time, and it is my favorite Indian food place.  I have ordered so many types of dishes and have liked them all.  When I order a lot they throw in free stuff as well. Extremely nice staff, fabulous food and the price is reasonable. Would definitely recommend.",5.0
"Honestly this is the best India food I've hand in a while. The customers here is AWESOME. The staff is super friendly and they even delivery really fast. I Highly recommend this place to all curry lovers out there. Sorry for not have a picture guys, I see curry I eat curry. Didn't have time for food pic. Promise to get some pics next time.",5.0
"So glad there is a good Indian restaurant in my neighborhood that doesn't serve greasy, overcooked,  food.  I ordered take out from Ashoka 2 weeks ago and had Samosas, Naan, Channa Masala andMalai Kofta.  ALL VERY DELICIOUS and very FRESH.  I can't wait to go back and try more menu items.  The staff is very nice and attentive.  They treat you like a guest in their home and all of the above is what's missing in restaurants all up and down Flatbush.",5.0

"Ashoka is delicious! I've been twice in the last two days. The lunch specials are $7.95 for a good-sized portion of an entree, rice, and plain naan. The regular entrees are even bigger. Like most Indian restaurants, vegetarians will be happy with the options. The vegetable curry and vegetable biryani are divine, and the garlic naan is solid. I walked several blocks in 95-degree weather for Indian food last month when I discovered Ashoka, and it was well worth it. Happy to have a great Indian food option in the area.",5.0
"Food is delicious. We ordered Beef Mughal Curry and Lamb Rogonjosh. Both the lamb and beef are very tender. There is only one waitor answering phones, taking orders for takeouts, and handling all tables in the restaurants, so sometimes he gets too busy.",4.0
"Ordered the chicken tikka masala last night and I was blown away by the richness of the sauce. Tasted so good. Delivery was quick, really quick, and the food arrived hot and the drinks cold. If I wasn't moving, I'd eat from here more often. Too bad I lived not too far away for almost a year, and just discovered this savory spot now.",5.0
"I've never had Indian food until this place. It always looked unappetizing, but when I saw the photos on yelp it looked delicious. We've been back several times and I truly love it. My boyfriend had indian food many times and he thinks this place is great too. The service is really nice and it's surprising that the place is usually empty. We live somewhat far away so too bad that they don't deliver to us. We really liked every single dish and they even gave us a complimentary small bowl of rice pudding. We loved the panir pakora, banana pakora, chicken tikka masala, chicken makhani, chicken tandoori, mango lassi and all of the different breads. We especially liked the naan with coconuts, nuts, and raisins. We always order the assorted condiments to go with our order. Every single dish is spectacular.

"Conveniently located a few blocks from my job, I was finally thrilled to see something other than a fast food place or deli available to indulge my palate.

I am from the neighborhood and i am a self described foodie.  I was walking down Flatbush ave looking for a new place to eat lunch with a friend and Ashoka Grill caught my eye.  I love Indian food and sadly we don't have a good place to go eat it in the area. Well that was the case until now!  The service was excellent. The people were very friendly and the food was great. My friend and i shared our food so i can tell you about several dishes.  The Beef Curry and the Chicken Tikka Masala was wonderful. I also enjoyed the vegetable Somosa and Banana Pakora.  The Nan was just right and the Mango Lassi was not too thick either.  I highly recommend this establishment.  Again the food is quite good and the laid back atmosphere is perfect to relax after a long day of work.  I just ordered food a few days after eating here and once again it was great.  Support good spots in your area peoples!,5.0

"DELIVERY REVIEWthe food is okay. the peshwari naan, which i've never had in america, was authentic. the menu is a little uninspiring, so i ordered the Chicken Makhni. i told them to make it spicy, but they didn't indulge as much as i would've liked them to in spicing it up. the food was fresh and not greasy like some indian restaurants i've been to in america where you can literally skim the oil off the top of the sauce. the mango lassi wasn't bad either. the portions were large enough for my boyfriend and i to share.i ordered on a friday at 9:30pm and the order took an hour to arrive, which was disappointing. it's walking distance from my apt, and it wasn't horrible, so i would order from them again.",3.0

I don't think that they taste the food before they send it out. It's flavorless and bland. The meat comes in BIG chunks instead of being minced. People who like this place must not have tried other places. The places I used to go to in Bedstuy were WAYY better.,1.0

"Reading these reviews has quite a chilling effect on me, as they truly doesn't reflect the reality of this establishment. The owners are friendly and a little too noisy in the back of the house for my taste.... The room has quite a stark, undefined decor, with empty walls and unappealing tables layout. I was extremely happy for an Indian restaurant to open in this location, since the area is extremely poorly serviced in terms of any basic place that you can call a restaurant! I have been around, and I know what good Indian food taste like, but I was very disappointed by most of the dishes I had here, I measure an Indian restaurant from their curry vegetable, and Ashoka's curry vegetable is not good (minced broccoli stalks don't belong there)!  The only truly solid dish that the chef seem to prepare well is the chicken tandoori. Chicken tikka masala is such a celebrated staple in NY Indian restaurants, but here you will find that the texture of the meat is somewhat spongy and dry, the lamb is also hard and gamy. Naan bread is good, soups are bad. Most of the dishes come with the same tomato based sauce, truly uninspiring for presentation and flavor. Overall I do patronize this restaurant out of desperation, for lack of available food establishments in the area. I wished that more customer would complain, instead of providing phony positive reviews. The owners should replace the current chef, but they are too proud too see it.  I do want to see the restaurant thriving and serving good Indian food! Maybe Midwood residents are too easy to please, but this restaurant wouldn't last long in a district with higher competition.",2.0
