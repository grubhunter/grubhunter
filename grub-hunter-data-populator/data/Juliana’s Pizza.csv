"Bf talked a lot about Grimaldi's for quite some time. Funny that while i was browsing Grimaldi's, it actually led me to Juliana's. I scanned through their menu, discussed about how Patsy had sold Grimaldi's decades ago to bf, persuaded him to drive to Dumbo to try Juliana's and boy, we were very impressed!Got there on Sat night around 9.20 and was promptly seated. it was quite packed but there was no wait for party of 2. we got David (the older guy) as our waiter and he was such a charming guy. we opted for caesar salad for our app and the no 1 special pizza. we were contemplating on whether to get the small or large one but David suggested to just go with the small size because it was quite big plus it was already late at night. great advice because we actually got two slices of leftovers. ;)The pizza itself was the thin crust type (my liking) and was baked to perfection. It was a bit salty because of the pancetta however it was just a perfect balance of saltiness. bf and i really enjoyed the pizza however i kinda regretted not ordering the arugula pizza (the no 4 specials) especially after seeing 3 tables ordered it. lol, for next time visit! the caesar salad was delicious as well. the generous crusted parm regiano combined with the fresh romaine and crunchy crouton -- perfect starter! i did not want to leave without having dessert so we shared two delicious scoops of pistachio ice cream (from the Brooklyn ice cream factory) to which David said: I'll make it romantic for you two :DOverall I was very pleased with Juliana's. Very fast and attentive service and not to mention delicious foods as well! Will be back!",5.0
"We arrived just before they opened at 11:30am on Sunday, and there was already a line of 12 or so people ahead of us. Gremaldi's, next door, also had a decent line. Fortunately the inside of the restaurant was much larger than it looked from the outside and we were immediately seated. It does not get as crowded as Grimaldi's and we're glad for that.After our waiter explained that the ""small"" and ""large"" sizes were 16 and 18 inches in diameter, respectively, we decided that the small would be more than enough for the 2 of us. We chose to get the margherita with sausage added to it. It tasted very much like Atlanta's Antico's Neapolitan style. It stayed hot the entire time we were there, which was great. In the end, we took out 1/4 of the pizza (2 slices) to go. They have a limited amount of craft beer selection too, but we sadly decided to forgo the beer during lunchtime.Our waiter was exceptional and noticed our indecisiveness right away (how embarrassing of us) and was very helpful in guiding our order selection. He also seemed to be one step ahead of us as he knew what we wanted/needed before we asked him. Unfortunately, I forgot his name.",5.0
"When Julianna's Pizza first opened, we could practically walk right in and get a table...meanwhile hour-long lines were in store for you next door at Grimaldi's. And on the surface, rightfully so.....after all, the Grimaldi name is virtually etched into the NYC Pizza history books.  But I guess the word is finally out. Julianna's Pizza is the newest pizza place owned by NYC pizza godfather and living legend, Patsy Grimaldi.....as opposed to the tourist trap next door...ironically named Grimaldi's! You can google on your own to see see the history and how Grimaldi's is no longer owned by Patsy Grimaldi, but suffice it to say Julianna's is the real deal. And based on my visit last weekend, Julianna's has its own long wait to get in. Seems folks have now caught on.Being the pizza snobs (or aficionados) that we are, my family has frequent and lively debates on who makes the best pizza. Coming from the central NJ area, places like DeLorenzo's in Trenton NJ and The Vault in Bordentown NJ, as well as Manhattan/Brooklyn spots like Joe's (West Village), Tottano's (Coney Island), L&B Spumoni Gardens (Gravesend) are among our favorites.Ever since Julianna's opened, the rest of my family has all agreed that Julianna's is #1 on the list, while I preferred Tottano's and De Lorenzo's...but not taking anything away from Julianna's! We were impressed right from the first visit a couple years ago. We were aware of the Patsy Grimaldi history, and there he was standing out front of the restaurant - hustling for every customer, inviting them to come in and try his pizza rather than stand in the long Grimaldi's line. He's in his 80's, but boy does he still hustle. He moved all around that restaurant - from helping to seat customers to posing for photos to bringing food to tables to spot-checking the pizza ovens for quality. It was no wonder why he was so successful.Fast forward to last week's visit...... I had the #4 pizza special: Tomato, mozzarella, arugula and prosciutto (Italian ham) - and THAT was officially the best pizza I ever tasted. Hands down.Thin crust, charred edges - perfect balance between not too crispy, not too doughy. A healthy dosage of prosciutto (no overly salty either, which sometimes can be the case at other places) and a boatload of Arugula. The arugula was put on after the the pizza was cooked too, so it was cold and fresh (not hot and wilted).My father in law had the Spaghetti & Meatballs and said the homemade meatballs were sensational.Overall, Julianna's has amazing food, a great atmosphere.....and ought to be near the top of any legitimate BEST PIZZA lists.",5.0
"Amazing, fresh, hot, delicious pizza!It was a warm, sunny day by Dumbo, Brooklyn, when we stumbled upon this gem. The view of downtown Brooklyn also looked ravishing from the front of the restaurant (where a long line accumulated).When we were seated, the waiter catered to us right away. He was very friendly and attentive! We ordered a large pizza pie (with half margherita, homemade meatballs, pepperoni and the other half with white cheese, prosciutto, and mushrooms). You cannot do one half of the specialty pizzas listed on the menu, both only ones that you create from scratch and then add on toppings.The soft drinks were served from the vintage bottle with a straw and they have a great assortment of wines. Each table comes with a pizza stand/holder which can be removed if you are not ordering pizza (but I highly recommend that you try their pizzas at least once)!The wait time for the food was not that long, especially since they are lovingly made from scratch (and baked in their coal fired oven). When I first bit into the pizza slice, I knew that the 45 minute wait standing outside in a long line was worth it. I cannot wait to come back!",5.0
"Don't fall for the tourist trap: skip the line at Grimaldi's and go to the REAL Grimaldi's (Patsy Grimaldi actually owns and runs THIS establishment).The pizzas might be a tad bit pricey, but they're pretty darn tasty. Whether you're enjoying the sights by the river, or walking across the Brooklyn Bridge, a trip to DUMBO isn't complete without stopping here at Juliana's. It's a must if you're bringing friends or family from out of town, and want them to get an essential part of that trip to New York experience.",5.0
"I went to Juliana's the day after I had Lombardi's. So what is this, my second real New York pizza? Four stars cause I'm saving my five for a pizza that truly gives me a foodgasm.Going here gave me one of those divine realizations as to why New Yorkers are known for folding their pizza. Before, (I'm sorry) I scoffed at this practice. ""You eat it faster!"" I'd say. I'd grumble, ""Makes the pizza too thick!"" But when the pizza is so thin... as it was here and at Lombardi's... it becomes a necessity. Cause the thing is just too flaccid to--- er. It gives the pizza some structural integrity. So now I'm a fan of the fold!If you're lucky, go sit at the bar. There are five magical seats there that give you a front row view of the guys & gals preparing your pizza. For coziness' sake, they even have the names of your pizzamakers on a little chalkboard by the oven. One man even threw the dough to his coworker, who proceeded to spin and thin it out. If you watch him long enough you can anticipate it and get you slow-mo Snap ready.Fiancée and I ordered a large half-white, half-margherita with pepperoni (Small and large both have 8 slices, btw!). At first I grumbled to her for picking such a basic topping but this pepperoni was far from it! This ain't your grocery or chain variety. This one's special. So judge not by the name and try it, at least. Margherita ended up being the preferred side (sauce was so right... and it looked mouthwateringly delicious), but the white pizza was good too (garlicky but good!). They take card too, so no need to seek an ATM! Only bummer was the size of the Coke. It came in a super tiny bottle. Great if you're tryna watch your calories. Not great if you're trying to down four pizzas.",4.0
"Juliana's is the same owner as Grimaldi's from what I briefly read on the sign as we were walking in through the door. The ambience of the restaurant was modern and relaxed. Though we went there specifically for the pizza, I was a little disappointed they didn't have any appetizers on the menu. They did have salads. We ordered a small margherita pizza with prosciutto, house made meatballs and mushroom. The small was a good size for 3 people. The pizza itself was good. My favorite of the ingredients is the meatball! We then tried the cheesecake, didn't care for the powdered sugar the put on top, and the brookie bridge, which was 2 brownie cookies with ice cream. Oh the drinks are not free refills at least the lemonades were not and I wasn't offered a refill for my tea either.",3.0
"I'm torn in leaving this review because my experience was overall very pleasant.  So why not 5 stars? Ok here's why. The pizza while very good is not NYC pizza. This is a fancy tourist pizza place that is indeed pricey. A small cheese $17. To me NYC pizza is that slice that is fresh out the brick oven and you pick it up with your hands fold in half and your fingers get dusty and the orange oil dips down the middle and your slurping that oil up from the wax paper with your eyes rolling back in pure delight wondering how on earth you can eat anything else again in life.  Then you finish it with an Italian ice and cold Coke! All for a whopping $5 dollars.  And let's be honest that just makes everything taste even more glorious. Julianna's is not this type of place. However, please don't let this review confuse you as a negative. The pizza is indeed quite delicious.  Truly it is.  But it's not that famous NYC SLICE that takes you back to your childhood. I believe a few of you guys will understand my review.  We were seated quickly but I showed up at 12 sharp by 12:15 the line was down the block. Guess I got lucky.  Good luck my yelpers on finding that NYC Slice that takes you back to after school and being 12 yrs old with $5 bucks in your pocket. That pizza is out there...",4.0
"YUM!!Coming from Cali, there really isn't an exquisite ""California"" pizza.  What I considered as good pizza in Cali was Pizza Hut and Papa John's.  Not to say they weren't bad, but they were the only ones I knew.  Thus, I was shocked when I came to New York, and my new friends called the pizza joints I was familiar with as ""trash"".Juliana's was my first official pizza restaurant I tried in the City, and what a great first choice!  I heard about the interesting history of Grimaldi's and the move to Juliana's.  This was known as the ""better"", underground pizza joint.  I was super stoked to try it out after hearing all the hype!I ordered the margarita pizza (simple mozzarella, tomato sauce, and basil leaves), and it was wonderful!  Even though it was popular, I wasn't very fond of the No. 1 pizza special.  I thought it was a little salty and the blend of the affumicata, white truffles, and scallions was too much for m.  The wait for the pizza pies wasn't too long and actually quite shorter than I expected, compared to other made to order pizza joints.  The pizza sizes are HUGE and are made for sharing, so make sure to come hungry!I love bringing friends to Juliana's, proudly calling it a legit pizza place compared to Cali's.  Can't wait to come back and try the other pies and desserts!",4.0
"Juliana's PizzaNY: BK: DUMBO11:30a Thursday 10th March 2016Four StarsI think I like Grimaldi's better.Brief history of Juliana's: It was open in 2012 by the Pat & Carol Grimaldi, the original owners of Grimaldi's who sold their original pizzeria and their name over a decade ago. The place and pies seem more upscale and modern.  I had the pup so I ordered a Large No. 2 to go. In 15 minutes, they brought it out in a bag (I like that they don't give it to you in a box). I walked down to Brooklyn Bridge Park and enjoyed my Cherry tomato, Bufala mozzarella, garlic and sea salt pizza looking out towards the East river and the Manhattan skyline. The crust was very thin in the middle and slice had a droopy tip when folded. The outside crust was thicker and bit plain. However, there was perfect amount of char on the bottom.  There was no sauce but it was not dry at all. The cheese was delicious. The pie was covered in were fresh, sweet, and juicy cherry tomatoes, garlic, and salt. Overall, the flavor was great but I think I want to try a red sauce pie before I make my final decision on which DUMBO pizzeria reigns supreme.",4.0
"So I am a Chicago Gal who loves her stuffed pizza! Pizza to me is a pan pizza stuffed with cheese, ground beef and spinach with a nice tomato sauce on top. My friends took me to Juliana's insisting their pizza was amazing. We waited about an hour in line in near freezing temperatures. Finally when we got a table we were attended to right away and started off with a salad. We ordered the Arugula, tomato, cucumber, red onion, frisee/fresh market and house dressing with goat cheese & walnuts salad. It was my first time trying all of these ingredients together and I loved it!!! For the pizzas/pies we ordered a Margherita pizza (Tomato, mozzarella and basil) & a White pizza (Mozzarella and garlic). Both were delicious!! I used to hate pizza without ground beef or spinach but after trying these two I altered my preferences and was pleased with the quality and taste of these New York Pies!Definitely want to come visit this place again.",5.0
"We quickly devoured our coal-fired margherita pizza at Juliana's one weekday afternoon. I was thinking, should we go to Grimaldi's or Juliana's? Then I learned the history (see below) and opted for Juliana's. The crust is thin with a slightly crisp outside and a soft and chewy inside. The delicious sauce is poured on top of the fresh mozzerella (that Carol Grimaldi makes herself) so that it stays moist and doesn't burn from the 800-degree oven. Beautifully crafted pies using incredibly fresh and tasty ingredients. Note: dried oregano is tossed on top of the pie, so if you're not a fan of oregano (which I am not), you might want to request they leave it off.*Juliana's is actually owned and operated by Patsy Grimaldi. Patsy and his wife, Carol, used to run Grimaldi's in this exact location before they sold their name to Frank Ciolli back in 1998. Ciolli moved the original Grimaldi's next door to the corner spot where it currently operates under the Grimaldi's name. After 15 years in retirement, Patsy and Carol opened Juliana's in the original Grimaldi location (next door to the current Grimaldi's) and is firing out pies as they did years ago.",5.0
"Luckily it was a nice day to wait outside. And the 25ish minute wait turned out to be worth it! We were very hungry so we ordered the baby spinach salad to start, which was delicious and a great kick off to the meal. We then shared a white pizza with onions and roasted peppers. The pizza was big, even for a small. Crust was great, cheese was perfect--the only cons were the unevenly distributed garlic and the scarcity of the toppings. Otherwise delicious!The host and wait staff were kind and attentive, and the restaurant, though small, had a lovely atmosphere. I'd definitely come back!",4.0
"This coal fire pizza was super duper great. After waiting for more than half an hour outside while they restocked the coal ovens, I was ready to devour a great pizza. Lucky for me, my order was taken quickly and the pizza was delivered in just minutes. Wow, I love that kind of service! The place got packed quickly and I completely felt like I was in NY by then. The buzzing restaurant was quickly growing a great vibe and I felt like moving to NY. Great tasting pizza.Pro tip: come here",5.0
"TL;DR: We love this fresh out of the oven, made to order pizzas!We came here on a rainy night so I believe many people decided to stay home. The place was only half full as we arrived and we were seated right away. Their menu consists of soups/and salads, classic pizza bases if you like no-fills, their own specialty pizzas, and a make your own section of all the toppings you can add to your pizza. For a small place like this, they have a pretty extensive drinks list.We ordered the specialty No. 3 and No. 4 because we want to try both the tomato and white pizza version. The No. 3 has mozzarella, sausage, broccoli and mild flavor of garlic; and the No. 4 has tomato sauce, mozzarella, arugula and prosciutto. We didn't think the wait for the pizzas was that long and they came out perfect! You can taste in the crust that the pizza came out of a coal oven and the cheese was melting right when you bite into it. All the ingredients compliments each other. Between the four of us, we were divided whether the white pizza or the tomato pizza is better. It's safe to say, just try both!The only downside to this awesome meal was that the place became really stuffy as the time went on. I think it was because the weather started to turn cold and they turned off the A/C but then it became warm again that night.Overall, it was a great experience and would love to come again!",5.0
Really great pizza and excellent service. I had the classic margherita pizza also the number 4 special is delicious. Patsy Grimaldi came around to talk with everyone. Second time I went the line was amazingly long. I really wish they could have told us how long the wait was for the oven to be done stoking so I could have grabbed a coffee while waiting.,4.0
"FYI, this is not the best pizza in America, hell, it's not even the best pizza on the block. lol So a group of friends and I were eager to try Juliana's since it was deemed best pizza in America by TripAdvisor and since they are in the same family as Grimaldi's. I think it's safe to say that all of us were pretty disappointed, for me the biggest issue was the dough. The dough was super soft and oddly chewy, I am not even sure if they under cooked the pie since everything else tasted fine. The dough was on the soft, kinda oily side and was not very appealing, a very bad sign for me is when you pick up the slice and the tip of the triangle droops down, I really hate when that happens. When such a key component is inferior, it really takes a lot away from the pie. The other issue I had with the pie was that it wasn't exactly hot, it was more like room temp but the pie was served in a fairly quick manner. On the bright side, since Grimaldi's moved back to the corner, this location has become more modern and upscale which is nice but for me, Grimaldi's is still the hands down winner for coal oven pizza.The food:No.4- Tomato, mozzarella, arugula and prosciutto. This is my usual go to pie since I think the prosciutto and arugula complement the pie very well. I liked the toppings of the pie here, I thought the prosciutto had good flavor with a nice subtle sweetness that paired well with the peppery kick from the arugula. The arugula was very pronounced and I enjoyed the flavor, but the damn kicker was the dough. The dough really ruined the pie for me, chewy and non crunchy dough would ruin any pie. yelp.com/user_local_phot…White Pizza- Mozzarella and Garlic. I thought the flavor of this was nice but too one note, and I also really love garlic but the one here was potent as fuck! I remember still having dragon breath the next morning. lol And as before, the dough was oddly chewy. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Margherita Pizza- Tomato, mozzarella and basil. I usually take the Margherita slice as a measuring tool for pizza since it's so elemental but the one here was kinda plain. I thought the Margherita was kinda flat and lifeless. And same issue, pie was chewy.",3.0
"I'm not a big fan of pizza and I'm definitely not a fan of waiting on line.  So, why did I wait 30 mins on a Saturday night for?

"If you love pizza as much as I do, PLEASE try Juliana's. My family was in town from Chicago so, of course, they had to try great New York style pizza. Originally, I was planning on taking them to Grimaldi's, since I've been there a bunch of times, but glad we tried something new.Grimaldi's and Juliana's are right next to each other. It's really hard to compare the two, so you'll just have to try both yourself. I believe they're owned by the same family, but the recipes are a little different. Each will have a ridiculous long line (anywhere between a 1/2hr to an hour), so if you're patient enough, try which ever one has the shortest line. It's so worth the wait. Our family decided to go full out, so we all ordered a drink and two small pizzas (wine with pizza is the best). So for our pizza, we ordered a small classic margarita and a small white pizza. Surprisingly, the small was a lot larger than we thought. Not the personal pan pizza that we were imagining. Between the four of us, we each had two slices of each pizza, which as delicious as it was, it was more than enough. It was just PERFECT. Just enough pasta sauce. Not too much cheese. Warmed to perfection. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. I must say, the pizza, especially the white pizza, doesn't taste good cold. Which is unfortunate, since I wanted to savor every bite. Overall, service was on point, drinks were delicious (pricy, but still worth it), and the pizza...totally worth the wait.",5.0

"I'm slightly disappointed that I couldn't give a 5 star rating. This used to be my favorite pizza spot in NY, but now I'm not too sure.I ordered the meatballs as a side dish and was very disappointed. It came VERY quickly, I'm talking 2 mins after ordering quick! It was dry inside and barely lukewarm. My husband tasted it and told me that my meatball recipe was better!For pizza, I ordered the Special No.4. It was great, I'm glad they still can still whip out flavorful pies. However, it was also a bit on the cold side, and thicker than I remember.

IS INSANE! Its so flavorful, its something that everyone should experience. I also ordered a beer on tap. And all this goodness happened in under 15 minutes.

"After Trip Advisor voted this place the 'Worlds Best Pizza', of course I had to try it. The pizza was pretty good and tasty. I just wish I could eat it fast enough so I could eat it all while it is piping hot. My first bite was delicious and I was impressed. My sister and I shared a large pizza and it was a great size, enough to feel sufficiently full without feeling stuffed. I was impressed with the prices too, considering it's good reputation, they could have hiked up their prices. We ordered a marinara pizza with meatballs and mushrooms. It was a great choice. Although all of the pizzas I saw coming out looked great. We also decided on dessert, I had a brookie bridge, a brownie ice cream sandwich and my sister had cheesecake. My sister really enjoyed hers, as did I. The cookies were amazing, but the ice cream was served to me half melted, and it continued to melt as I ate it, so by the end I just had cookies. So that was disappointing. I'd say stick with the pizza. We didn't have a long wait, about 20 minutes on a Tuesday lunchtime. Once seated, You are quite packed in though and feel like you are dining on one long table as opposed to a table for 2, but I'd rather that than have a longer wait.",4.0
"Great pizza. Not THE best but definitely in my top five! Fresh dough, homemade sauce, fresh mozzarella and fresh toppings. I prefer my pizza to be a bit on the salty and hot side so we ordered the margherita base with pepperoni and black and kalamata olives. The pepperoni curls into a sort of a cup indicating its freshness. My mouth watered ordering the combo and my taste buds weren't disappointed with the flavor combo. The crust was a bit dry and I just kept wishing for the hot oil served at my local pizza place. Also had a tasty Caesar salad with white anchovies. Our waiter was friendly.

The hot, fresh pizza had the perfect chew, and the acidity of the tomatoes didn't overpower the richness of the cheese. The slight basil flavor still came through, and in all, it was a perfect slice. The No. 1 was great too, as anything with that much truffle and rich, fatty pancetta is just a meat flavor explosion. Heh.In all, is the pizza worth waiting in line for? Sure, if it's a short-ish line. I would agree it's the perfect slice, but how much are you willing to pay for it? It should be worth noting that this pizza is just straight up expensive.

If you live in Manhattan and can't be bothered with going down to Brooklyn, I actually really like Luzzo's in East Village for a good, high-quality pie that's fairly similar in taste and texture.

"I have been on a pizza binge lately. Since this was rated as the top pizzeria in America, I decided I had to check it out. Parking in the area was very difficult so we decided to get take out instead. We ordered the #1 with Mozarella, pancetta, scallions and white truffles in olive oil. We also ordered the Margherita pizza which has Tomato, mozarella and basil. The two smalls was enough to feed 3 people. We were stuffed! I really liked the Margherita pizza. The thinly sliced pizza was coated with just the right amount of sauce and cheese. I thought the #1 was okay. It was slightly too greasy for me. The place is right by the water so it was nice to grab some ice cream in the nearby ice cream shop as we waited for our pizza order.",4.0

The pizza is worth the wait.I came with my friends on my last trip here, one of which has never been to the city but has been to the best of Chicago's deep dish establishments and waited over 3 hours to get seated. Here we waited less than an hour and he said he found the pizza to be superior. Yes, it's not fair to compare two vastly different pies but they are both called Pizza and Juliana's wins.My other friends have only been to Lombardi's, and they too agreed Juliana's was clearly much better.Why?

"I am a firm believer that bagels and pizza are still the best in New Jersey, and not New York, but Juliana is surely swaying my opinion. My bf and I were here early on Sunday morning knowing very well that the line at Juliana's could get pretty long on any given day. Having done our research, we wanted to get to Juliana at least 30 minutes early thinking we wouldn't have to wait too too long, if the line was like we imagined. Thankfully we had approached the storefront along with other and noticed patrons just standing around, but sure enough a line was form in no time and to our luck the second party in line. We had strategized our approach to the menu before getting there, but unfortunately were denied when we found out that Specialty pies cannot be changed, altered, but most of all cannot be split. So we had decided on a Large pie, split between a classic MARGHERITA with extra garlic, and a WHITE PIZZA, with sweet onion, ricotta cheese, and sausage.Our pizza was out on time. It was served hot, fresh, with evenly distributed toppings. The tomato sauce was so simple yet so light. The ricotta cheese light and fluffy. It was the perfect balance of ingredients and flavor. The dough was super thin in the middle, doughy but still rather light by the crust. There was no doubt that this pizza was one of the best we've had in a long time, and it obviously showed since the large pie we ordered, was easily consumed by just the two of us.TIPS:-Go early, 30 minutes before opening so that you're not waiting in line the entire afternoon- the Specialty pizza pies cannot be split, only the classics, so select or customize the classics accordingly- spliting the pizza half with a white base, half with a tomato base is possible!",5.0
"Ordered: Margherita pizzaPros--The dough had a nice char to it. The tomatoes used on the pie were very fresh.

"I have been on a pizza binge lately. Since this was rated as the top pizzeria in America, I decided I had to check it out. Parking in the area was very difficult so we decided to get take out instead. We ordered the #1 with Mozarella, pancetta, scallions and white truffles in olive oil. We also ordered the Margherita pizza which has Tomato, mozarella and basil. The two smalls was enough to feed 3 people. We were stuffed! I really liked the Margherita pizza. The thinly sliced pizza was coated with just the right amount of sauce and cheese. I thought the #1 was okay. It was slightly too greasy for me. The place is right by the water so it was nice to grab some ice cream in the nearby ice cream shop as we waited for our pizza order.",4.0
"This has been my favorite Pizza joint in the city back when it was still under the Grimaldi's name. I haven't tried to venture next door, why bother when the real deal is right here at 19 Old Fulton St.What can I say that hasn't been said before? The pizza is worth the wait.I came with my friends on my last trip here, one of which has never been to the city but has been to the best of Chicago's deep dish establishments and waited over 3 hours to get seated. Here we waited less than an hour and he said he found the pizza to be superior. Yes, it's not fair to compare two vastly different pies but they are both called Pizza and Juliana's wins.My other friends have only been to Lombardi's, and they too agreed Juliana's was clearly much better.Why? All the aspects that make a great New York style is there. Good fresh ingredients, good ratio of cheese to sauce, and a crust so good you can eat it on it's own. I don't think I need to go on.",5.0
"I am a firm believer that bagels and pizza are still the best in New Jersey, and not New York, but Juliana is surely swaying my opinion. My bf and I were here early on Sunday morning knowing very well that the line at Juliana's could get pretty long on any given day. Having done our research, we wanted to get to Juliana at least 30 minutes early thinking we wouldn't have to wait too too long, if the line was like we imagined. Thankfully we had approached the storefront along with other and noticed patrons just standing around, but sure enough a line was form in no time and to our luck the second party in line. We had strategized our approach to the menu before getting there, but unfortunately were denied when we found out that Specialty pies cannot be changed, altered, but most of all cannot be split. So we had decided on a Large pie, split between a classic MARGHERITA with extra garlic, and a WHITE PIZZA, with sweet onion, ricotta cheese, and sausage.Our pizza was out on time. It was served hot, fresh, with evenly distributed toppings. The tomato sauce was so simple yet so light. The ricotta cheese light and fluffy. It was the perfect balance of ingredients and flavor. The dough was super thin in the middle, doughy but still rather light by the crust. There was no doubt that this pizza was one of the best we've had in a long time, and it obviously showed since the large pie we ordered, was easily consumed by just the two of us.TIPS:-Go early, 30 minutes before opening so that you're not waiting in line the entire afternoon- the Specialty pizza pies cannot be split, only the classics, so select or customize the classics accordingly- spliting the pizza half with a white base, half with a tomato base is possible!",5.0
"Ordered: Margherita pizzaPros--The dough had a nice char to it. The tomatoes used on the pie were very fresh. Cons--It seemed as if half the slices were over spiced and the other half were just right. Considering I waited in line about 45 minutes and the pies were pricey, I had higher expectations for the taste.",3.0
"6 of us lucked out in avoiding the line completely by taking the outdoor seating that perfectly fit our party. The waitstaff were extremely accommodating (sun was in my eyes, so they lowered the awning for us) and super friendly! And the pizza. Holy mother of all that is good when it comes to thin crust pizza...this. This is the jackpot of perfectly flavored sauces, expertly tossed thin crust, and lavishly mozzarella laden pies. Coming from a pizza snob with a North Jersey childhood and higher expectations than most, this is...hands down, the best pizza I've had in the States.",5.0
"I expected so much more from all of the reviews and hype surrounding it. Growing up in north jersey, I guess I was pretty spoiled when it comes to good pizza. Don't get me wrong, the pizza wasn't bad, but it definitely wasn't the typical New York pizza I grew up with.",3.0
"Did the whole 45-minute wait thing. Worth it? In summary, yes.Oh Juliana's, what a scene you make for those getting off the Brooklyn bridge and exploring the area. You instantly lure us in with those long lines in front of your doors. Something special must be in here, right?Hmm, not so special, but still pretty darn good. After a long 45-minute wait in 30-degree weather, we were welcomed into Juliana's. The server quickly attended to us and took our orders. In the blink of an eye, our 4 large pizzas arrived. Yes, these pizzas were delicious. Hot, fresh, coal-fired taste with delicious sauce. However, although I thoroughly enjoyed the amazing pizza, I honestly feel that I can get pizza just as good elsewhere. So, I don't think Juliana's is worth all of the hype, but there's no arguing that it's really really good.Prices were rather steep ($20 for a large Margherita, $29 for a specialty large pie). Service was quick and like I said, the pizza came out very quickly too. With that being said, I encountered some weird thing. First, I asked for garlic powder for my pizza but they said they don't offer that (what kind of pizza place doesn't?!). Second, if you want Parmesan cheese on it, they come to you with a little bowl, and they will ONLY put it on the ONE slice that you are currently eating. It was just so sketchy.All in all, fantastic pizza but in my opinion, not worth allllll the hype. You're in NY for pete's sake, there's amazing pizza everywhere.",4.0
So this is my first New York pizza I've tried and let me tell you this is some gooooooood pizza! Try to come before 6/7pm if not the crowd will come. If I could I would have takin a whole pie home to Cali :( .. There was 4 of us ladies and we had a large. 2 pieces each. Will post photo,5.0

Very few people love pizza more than me so I feel that I'm well qualified with rating Juliana's Pizzeria a solid 4.5/5 stars. We ordered a half margehrita and half pepperoni pizza so that we enrich our taste buds with a wider taste pallette and boy it didn't disappoint.

To end our delicious meal, my friend ordered the cheesecake and I ordered the Brookie bridge. I'm not much of a cheesecake fan but my friends seemed to like it. As for the Brookie bridge, that's why one star is taken off. I guess my expectations were so high after that pizza.

"So this is the best pizza eh?  I'm glad we got to experience it.  The line wasn't too bad - maybe 30 minutes for a Sunday evening and shorter than Grimaldi's.  We got to sit at the counter overlooking the oven and the pizza making station.  After much debate we settled with the #1 large and a Caesars salad.  The salad was very average and too small to be shared 4 ways.  But that wasn't why we were there anyway.  We saw our pizza come out of the oven sizzling.  We were starved from all the walking and dug in as soon as it was delivered. A few bites in and we realized one pie may not have been enough so we ordered a marguerite as backup.  As for the #1, it was a little salty but it was good.  The thin crust was light but still a little doughy.   The scallions nicely accompanied the cured Italian bacon.  The marguerite was also good but could have used a little more basil.  Even though there were a lot of orders ahead of us by the time we ordered the 2nd pie, our order to pushed to the front so it came just as we finished the 1st.   So if this is as good as it gets here in NYC, I'm glad to say we're not too far behind back in Cali.   In Fullerton we have Fuoco which serves neapolitan style pizza.  My rudimentary pizza taste buds couldn't discern much difference between the two.  This is good, right?  At least for us in Fullerton.  Yay!",4.0
"What can I say about Juliana's that would be even remotely original? Other people have gone through the history (if you're looking for Grimaldi's, you want Juliana's, basically). They've also touted how good the pizza is.I guess I can give you a perspective on delivery. On a Thursday night, we had the brilliant idea of ordering pizzas for takeout and then heading over to the pier (an idea from Victor S. - RIYP). Called them around 8:30, and was put on hold and hung up on. Called them back, and was told they were too busy to take orders and to call back in an hour. So I did at 9:30, and was able to place my order. Was told 15-20 minutes.Even at 9:30, there was a line out the door for a table. So takeout was definitely the way to go. Also, you get to feel like a VIP by skipping the line. Good times. Had to wait another 5 minutes for the two pies, and then we were on our way.Note that they don't do pizza boxes for some reason. Just this weird wax paper bag. So if you have two pies, one of them's gonna have cheese casualties (even with those little tables). Luckily, we only had to transport the pies a block.We just did two normal pies. A regular cheese, and a pepperoni. The pepperoni was delicious and just ever so curled up from the heat of the oven.

Don't get me wrong, I've never met a pizza I didn't like, but Juliana's is just above the rest.The pizza is perfectly balanced - from sauce,to cheese, to dough. It's truly an art and probably a science. It's not over the top or trying too hard.  And, prices are also totally fair, especially for New York.

Got there just after noon on a recent Saturday.  Waited 5 minutes for a table for two.  Big line by the time we left.  The Caesar Salad was better than it had to be next to some of the best pizza you can find in New York City.  Definitely add pepperoni to your pie if you're a fan.,4.0
"The line just grew longer and longer at Juliana's... on a Wednesday evening at that.  Not sure if it's always this crowded on a random weekday evening, fairly early, but it may be because the Brooklyn Half bib pick up festival was going on and people passed by on the way to the F train.I'm sure you can read about the history of Patsy Grimaldi and Juliana's vs Grimaldi's in all of the other reviews, so I'll spare that here.  For me, I enjoyed the atmosphere, food, and service much more at Juliana's than I did at Grimaldi's.  There was no line at Grimaldi's when I was waiting in line at Juliana's, but there was a decent sized one by the time I left.For 3 girls, a large sized pizza was just the right size.  We ordered a classic Margherita pizza and added fresh sausage with fennel, topped with fresh garlic.  This combination was amazing - sprinkled with a little red pepper for a kick.  I'm not sure why there is salt on the table since this pizza is plenty salty already.  The pizza is best served straight out of the oven, piping hot.  I used a knife and fork for most of it and picked it up when it wasn't as floppy near the crust.  The fresh mozzarella is delicious as is the tomato sauce - next time I'll add extra.  The garlic is a must for garlic lovers - you know who you are.  The sausage is actually plopped onto the pizza as raw ground pork (at least I think that's what I saw) - so you're getting the freshest ingredients.If you're going to choose between Juliana's and Grimaldi's, go for Juliana's if you're looking for best pizza.  Grimaldi's if you're trying to go to a place to just ""go"".",5.0

"I went to Juliana's Pizza for dinner after leaving Barclays. The line was insane for dine in around 7pm (a few blocks long). I was close to leaving but decided to stick it out. We waited about 1.5 hours before being seated. Dress according to the weather if you're dining in for dinner (weekend). Luckily, weather was perfect while we waited in line. The restaurant is very small and cramped. I ordered a margherita pizza with sausage and pepperoni.  Our food arrived very fast. I'm glad I stayed in line because Juliana's Pizza lived up to the hype. The thin crust was crispy and airy. Juliana's cheese, sauce, and toppings were very flavorful. Juliana's pizza is simple and tasty. I definitely rank Juliana's Pizza as one of my favorite pies in NYC. Cheesecake caught my eye for dessert. Surprisingly, Juliana's cheesecake was delicious. Yes, soft and creamy goodness. I wanted to order more cheesecake before closing out our check (lol). Our waiter was busy but stayed on top of our table. Definitely check out Juliana's Pizza while in Brooklyn (expect a wait). It's best to make reservations if you can or order takeout if you don't want to wait. Overall, I enjoyed my dining experience at Juliana's Pizza. I give Juliana's Pizza a 4.5 rating.",4.0
MMMMM. We had the margherita pizza with sausage and pepperoni. We sat at the counter so we watched tons of pizzas being made. True talent :).Service was good and the pizza was delicious. The only bummer was that we couldn't eat the whole pizza because we were too full from eating all day. We took it to go but this is the type of pizza that does not keep well. It was soggy but I still ate the leftovers. Definitely worth a visit and try to eat ALL your pizza while you're still in the restaurant.,4.0

"The line just grew longer and longer at Juliana's... on a Wednesday evening at that.  Not sure if it's always this crowded on a random weekday evening, fairly early, but it may be because the Brooklyn Half bib pick up festival was going on and people passed by on the way to the F train.I'm sure you can read about the history of Patsy Grimaldi and Juliana's vs Grimaldi's in all of the other reviews, so I'll spare that here.  For me, I enjoyed the atmosphere, food, and service much more at Juliana's than I did at Grimaldi's.  There was no line at Grimaldi's when I was waiting in line at Juliana's, but there was a decent sized one by the time I left.For 3 girls, a large sized pizza was just the right size.  We ordered a classic Margherita pizza and added fresh sausage with fennel, topped with fresh garlic.  This combination was amazing - sprinkled with a little red pepper for a kick.  I'm not sure why there is salt on the table since this pizza is plenty salty already.  The pizza is best served straight out of the oven, piping hot.  I used a knife and fork for most of it and picked it up when it wasn't as floppy near the crust.  The fresh mozzarella is delicious as is the tomato sauce - next time I'll add extra.  The garlic is a must for garlic lovers - you know who you are.  The sausage is actually plopped onto the pizza as raw ground pork (at least I think that's what I saw) - so you're getting the freshest ingredients.If you're going to choose between Juliana's and Grimaldi's, go for Juliana's if you're looking for best pizza.  Grimaldi's if you're trying to go to a place to just ""go"".",5.0
"Great pizza! Very similar to Patsy's, but a little better. Is it the best pizza in New York? Nope. But it's fresh and delicious and will definitely hit the spot when you're craving pizza! The dining room was absolutely packed, but the service was great!",4.0
"We came here around 3:30 pm on the Sunday and waited in line until they opened around 4. From the appetizers (salad and soup) to the pizza, everything was fingerlicking good. Service was great, kudos at how they handled the chaos of everyone ordering at the same time. I'm keeping this place in my bookmarks and I'll definitely be back for more.",5.0
"I went to Juliana's Pizza for dinner after leaving Barclays. The line was insane for dine in around 7pm (a few blocks long). I was close to leaving but decided to stick it out. We waited about 1.5 hours before being seated. Dress according to the weather if you're dining in for dinner (weekend). Luckily, weather was perfect while we waited in line. The restaurant is very small and cramped. I ordered a margherita pizza with sausage and pepperoni.  Our food arrived very fast. I'm glad I stayed in line because Juliana's Pizza lived up to the hype. The thin crust was crispy and airy. Juliana's cheese, sauce, and toppings were very flavorful. Juliana's pizza is simple and tasty. I definitely rank Juliana's Pizza as one of my favorite pies in NYC. Cheesecake caught my eye for dessert. Surprisingly, Juliana's cheesecake was delicious. Yes, soft and creamy goodness. I wanted to order more cheesecake before closing out our check (lol). Our waiter was busy but stayed on top of our table. Definitely check out Juliana's Pizza while in Brooklyn (expect a wait). It's best to make reservations if you can or order takeout if you don't want to wait. Overall, I enjoyed my dining experience at Juliana's Pizza. I give Juliana's Pizza a 4.5 rating.",4.0
MMMMM. We had the margherita pizza with sausage and pepperoni. We sat at the counter so we watched tons of pizzas being made. True talent :).Service was good and the pizza was delicious. The only bummer was that we couldn't eat the whole pizza because we were too full from eating all day. We took it to go but this is the type of pizza that does not keep well. It was soggy but I still ate the leftovers. Definitely worth a visit and try to eat ALL your pizza while you're still in the restaurant.,4.0
Hands down the most delicious pizza I've ever had the chance to eat. I've been here a couple of times and can't wait to go back in the future. All of the specialty pizzas are great! I'm sure you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The service is also very friendly and welcoming. You can also get a pretty awesome view of the Brooklyn Bridge and lower Manhattan after enjoying a pie at this wonderful place.,5.0
"I'm not much of a pizza enthusiast but Juliana's Pizza may have turned me. We came in right before they were about to close to clean the restaurant in the middle of the day to re-open for dinner so we got lucky and snagged a seat right away! We ordered the No. 4 special (tomato, mozzarella, arugula, and prosciutto). Keep in mind the specials cannot be altered in ANY WAY! The small was HUMUNGOUS. Way more than enough for two people. The pizza was amazing! Light but filling. I would definitely recommend this place to any pizza lover and even non-lover.",4.0
"A tale of how not to eat pizza in New York, as demonstrated by the throngs of tourists waiting outside and the fact that it took me a longer time to sit down than to actually eat the pizza: do NOT use a fork and knife. Do NOT cut the pizza into bite-sized pieces and then lift it daintily to your mouth. This ain't a cucumber crustless sandwich at high tea. And definitely do NOT blot your pizza with a napkin and then eat the sad, oil-less husk of a once beautiful slice. This is what you do. Lift it up with one hand. Fold it in half. Chomp down. Repeat. I can't remember how exactly Juliana's stacks up to Grimaldi's because my only memory of Grimaldi's is waiting 2 hours for pizza that I then devoured in 20 minutes and the mediocre Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory ice cream right after. But I've got the combination of toppings down: 1. Goat cheese.  2. Prosciutto.  3. Sausage with fennel. 4. Arugula.  Sweet onion and pepperoni are optional. And skip the $3.50 ""natural"" sodas. They taste like any other soda in the world.",5.0
"Here's my tip: go for lunch in the middle of the week on a miserably rainy day in late February. The place was almost completely empty-- certainly no line out the door. And of course, the pizza was fantastic. It seems to me there's a pizza spectrum nowadays. On one end, there's your basic ""dollar slice"" that has a certain kind of charm though not really my thing. On the other end, there's more ""upscale"" places that have more exotic ingredients, things like pistachios, eggs, brussel sprouts, etc. Juliana's seems kind of in the middle (toward the upscale end) of the spectrum in that it's traditional/right out of Napoli sorts of ingredients but done perfectly.Oh, and me and the Mrs. split our first egg cream-- I'd get that again for sure, too.",5.0
"I am deeply fascinated by NY Pizza Wars! Seriously, seriously! I want to take sides, I want to argue, I want my guys to win! And Juliana's? That's my people. It's humbling to see Patsy Grimaldi himself playing host and seating customers outside his own restaurant. He is kind of a legend. That kind of service should tell you already this place is exceptional.Decorated in such a cute way in homage to Grimaldi's mother, this place churns out those amazing pies like a craft! They use premium ingredients, fresh mozz, basil and only the best sausage and pepperoni! Service is impeccably probably because Patsy himself sets the tone of the entire restaurant. He walks around and talks to the customers, seats customers, wipes down tables - he's a living legend and he's everything and more in person.If you're a tourist and thinking if you should try Grimaldi's, don't. THIS is the original Grimaldi's run by Grimaldi himself. It's a fresh start under a new name. Don't think twice about it!",5.0
"This place, hand down, best pizza we had on our trip to NY. I had found this restaurant as one of the top places to eat in Brooklyn. So my fiancé and I walked over the Brooklyn Bridge and walked down to to get this amazing pizza I had read about.I was very impressed. Great service! Attentive, knowledgeable and very nice. We had a flight to catch so we ordered immediately when we got there. Feeling kinda sluggish, we ordered espresso shots. Yum! We also gave into a sweet tooth for cheesecake. we did our meal a little backwards since we were waiting for the pizza. The pie was awesome. it came out steaming and we both inhaled half of it immediately almost burning our mouths because we were in a hurry but also excited to try it. Delicious! oh  the sauce used was amazing and we just loved the cheese and topping choices. We didn't have time to finish but took the rest of the pizza togo. no joke, we flew home to FL and had the rest of the pizza for dinner.

They were incredibly quick with getting us seated and having our orders in even on a busy Friday night. Service was great and no complaints there.On to the foood! We tried the Margherita pizza and the salmon pizza (No.5 off their specials). The Margherita pizza was awesome, definitely did not disappoint. The sauce is amazing and just the right amount of cheese on a flavorful thin crust. If you can't decide what to get, do yourself a favor and get this one.We also tried he salmon pizza which was ...interesting. It's topped with smoked salmon, goat cheese, capers aka a lox bagel in pizza form. I didn't hate it but I didn't love it either. Maybe it needed a sauce to bring it all together and actually feel like pizza. Definitely check out this place if you're in Brooklyn!",5.0
Decided to come here after walking the Brooklyn bridge on a Friday (Good Friday) afternoon hoping to avoid a lot of the tourists.  We got here at 3 and the host told us that they are closing at 3.15 until 4pm. Didn't want to go to Grimaldi's next door since we had the one in Hoboken and weren't fans (even though these might be related). Instead of waiting there until 4 - decided to get take out and sit by the water.  Ordered the margarita pizza (large size) which came out to 21 dollars.  The pizza was tasty! The crust is pretty good too and I was able to eat all of the crust.  The downside - they ran out of paper plates for take out which didn't end up being a big deal.  Unlike Grimaldi's next door - they also take credit card here.,4.0
"This is the classic New York style pizza that I grew up loving. This was a treat back in the day and is just as delicious today. The location is the original Grimaldi's with the original oven and headed by none other than Patsy Grimaldi himself. What I love about Juliana's is the superior sauce on the pies. It is well balanced with the sweetest tomatoes with a hint of acidity, perfect consistency, and has the right amount of herbs; just as I remembered years ago. We always have to get a Margherita in the mix every time we come here ($19 large). The crust is perfectly cooked with a nice pull on the dough but lightly crisped on the edges. We also decided to try some of the specialty pizzas. The No.1 ($30 large) is a quite decadent white pie with pancetta and truffle oil. The toppings just work very well together. The No. 2 ($29 large) is also a white pie where the fresh bufala mozzarella reigns true along with the fragrant garlic and small cherry tomatoes.Mr. Patsy Grimaldi is also always around checking on the tables and asking how the food was. He's very welcoming and you can see how much he cares about his pizza.

The pie wasn't exactly round, had a clump of ingredients in the middle and above average bare crust on the perimeter, and only had about 5 basil leaves on it. The Juliana's pie was a nice round shape, was even in ingredient distribution edge to edge, and looked much prettier with about 10 basil leaves on it.Both pies were cooked to perfection.While the taste was similar, Juliana's packed a more natural flavor, letting the ingredients shine through on their own merit. The Grimaldi's pizza was a bit more salty and garlicy in the sauce, with the burnt edges of the uncovered crust packing a bitter smokey flavor. The central bites of the Grimaldis pie were overwhelmingly garlicy as that was where the density of the ingredients lied, whereas the Juliana's pie had a consistent taste on each bite.The fold on both was great, the springiness, sponginess, density and durability of the thin crust was great on both. Cheese was fresh and tasty with both pies.Once a hidden secret, Juliana's is now getting longer lines with increased popularity, but they are still nowhere near as long as the Grimaldi's line.

"My sister and I were in NY last weekend just for a fun sibling weekend. On Saturday morning we decided to be complete tourists and walk across the Brooklyn Bridge on a quest for some authentic New York pizza. We had heard Grimaldi's was good so we went in search of their restaurant. We stumbled upon Grimaldi's and to be honest it looked really grim from the outside. Juliana's which is right next door, on the other hand, looked fresh and inviting with it's bright awning, big open windows, etc. We decided to check yelp to see who had a better rating and Juliana's was the favorite. So, our decision to go to Grimaldi's changed and we got a table at Juliana's.When we walked in they had just opened for lunch. Service was a little slow to get to us at first but Terrence eventually stopped by our table, took our drinks and pizza order, and then we took a minute to read about the history of Juliana's. It turns out Juliana's was actually started by Patsy Grimaldi after the family sold Grimaldi's to someone outside their family. Knowing what they do best, Patsy decided to open up a new pizza joint right next door to Grimaldi's and Juliana's was born!We had ordered a small margherita pizza (about 14 or so inches across) with anchovies (I love anchovies) and when it arrived my life changed... As a Chicagoan I'd like to think I know something about good pizza....but holy crap Juliana's is incredible! The ingredients use were so fresh and of such high quality, the crust was perfectly cooked, and for once in my life I felt so very satisfied finishing off such a giant pizza. When we were done eating I told our waiter Terrence how delicious that pizza was and to this day I'm still extolling how delicious it actually was. I could actually go for a slice right now...Anyway, this place is incredible. The pizza is delicious and if I ever return to Brooklyn there is no doubt in my mind which place I'll go for a pie. In the past I have given quite a few 5 star reviews but after eating at Juliana's I'm not sure 5 stars would be appropriate. Juliana's deserves 6 stars at a minimum, or even a gold star, something letting the world know this place is a true gem.",5.0

"You want some good Brooklyn pizza without walking too deep into Brooklyn, then come here. Small but very nice decor. The staff is attentive and fast. This place competes with another spot next door to it but the only upside I saw to this place was that they accept credit cards. The one next door, said cash only at the door. The pizza was perfect.

"Perfect thin crust and cheesy topping made our pizza (the Specialty Pizza #1) amazing!  This place is run by the original Mr. Grimaldi and you can tell this guy knows his stuff.My husband and I split a large pizza and the thing is humongous!  We managed to still polish it off, however, as we had spent the entire day exploring lower Manhattan on foot.Service is friendly but sometimes spotty (due to high volume inside the restaurant) so don't expect anyone to be hovering nearby, they're just way too busy for that.Despite that, I spent the next week talking about Juliana's to anyone who would listen, and I'm pretty sure I won't be able to really enjoy pizza until my next trip to NYC.",4.0
"*review is based upon my pick-up order experience I ordered a large margherita pizza with pepperoni for a pick-up to share with my roommates. I arrived on time to pick it up but it was already pretty cold. We had to heat it up in the microwave by the time we ate it. Considering that it was cold pizza, it was still delicious. But it wasn't surpassing my expectations as one of top joints for pizza here in nyc.",4.0
"Drove pass DUMBO and my friend was surprised there was no line for Juliana's.  What did we do?  We decided to eat pizza even though we had lunch not long ago.  When we got closer, the place was temporarily closed to clean the ovens even though people were still inside eating.  We decided to wait since sign says they will open in few minutes.  Waited about 15 minutes and finally our time to try this popular pizza.  Got a small margarita pizza between 2, which was actually a good size.  Luckily it's thin crust.  Pizza was yummy.  Dough, cheese, tomato, basil.  Yum.  As for the story behind Juliana vs Grimaldi .... I'm not too certain.  Just want Yummy pizza!",4.0
"My sister and I were in NY last weekend just for a fun sibling weekend. On Saturday morning we decided to be complete tourists and walk across the Brooklyn Bridge on a quest for some authentic New York pizza. We had heard Grimaldi's was good so we went in search of their restaurant. We stumbled upon Grimaldi's and to be honest it looked really grim from the outside. Juliana's which is right next door, on the other hand, looked fresh and inviting with it's bright awning, big open windows, etc. We decided to check yelp to see who had a better rating and Juliana's was the favorite. So, our decision to go to Grimaldi's changed and we got a table at Juliana's.When we walked in they had just opened for lunch. Service was a little slow to get to us at first but Terrence eventually stopped by our table, took our drinks and pizza order, and then we took a minute to read about the history of Juliana's. It turns out Juliana's was actually started by Patsy Grimaldi after the family sold Grimaldi's to someone outside their family. Knowing what they do best, Patsy decided to open up a new pizza joint right next door to Grimaldi's and Juliana's was born!We had ordered a small margherita pizza (about 14 or so inches across) with anchovies (I love anchovies) and when it arrived my life changed... As a Chicagoan I'd like to think I know something about good pizza....but holy crap Juliana's is incredible! The ingredients use were so fresh and of such high quality, the crust was perfectly cooked, and for once in my life I felt so very satisfied finishing off such a giant pizza. When we were done eating I told our waiter Terrence how delicious that pizza was and to this day I'm still extolling how delicious it actually was. I could actually go for a slice right now...Anyway, this place is incredible. The pizza is delicious and if I ever return to Brooklyn there is no doubt in my mind which place I'll go for a pie. In the past I have given quite a few 5 star reviews but after eating at Juliana's I'm not sure 5 stars would be appropriate. Juliana's deserves 6 stars at a minimum, or even a gold star, something letting the world know this place is a true gem.",5.0

"You want some good Brooklyn pizza without walking too deep into Brooklyn, then come here. Small but very nice decor. The staff is attentive and fast. This place competes with another spot next door to it but the only upside I saw to this place was that they accept credit cards. The one next door, said cash only at the door. The pizza was perfect. You can taste the fresh tomato sauce and ingredients. We ordered the Margherita pizza but we added pepperoni to it, something the waiter recommended. Best pizza I had a while.",5.0
"We went on a Fri night around 7pm when the lines were still forming. The manager came out to direct the line to make sure it was not blocking other stores in the area. The only annoying part of lining up was in front of a group of Jehovah Witnesses. The leader of the group even went so far as to hassle the manager for a discount for their group of 15ppl. Even though the manager told her, it would not be fair since he would also have to extend the courtesy to other faiths- Catholics, Muslims, etc. She was very persistent and proclaim, they were big supporters of their business. And add as a reminder that they're neighbors next door. Jehovah Kingdom Hall is also located across the street from them. Nothing personal against the faith. It's experiences like these that really ruin it for local businesses and establishments. I would suggest to other organizations- religious or not, please don't ruin it for locals who are looking forward to trying out the place.  Juliana is voted as the nation's top ten pizza while Grimaldi didn't even make it on the top ten list. Most tourists get confused and opt for Grimaldi's instead of Juliana's when it's the same chain founded by Patsy Grimaldi. Except he did sell the store to a different owner. Juliana proudly display Founded by Patsy Grimaldi on their window sign. Patsy named his store after his mother. Personally, I've dined at both and honestly, it taste the same. I did recall Grimaldi's being a bit more burned though on the crust. Except the secret is the lines are much shorter at Juliana's compared to Grimaldi's ridiculous line down the block. Same soft, thin crust charred from the oven coal fire and delicious toppings. We had their signature Margherita with sausage and mushrooms. What makes Juliana stand out is ""they source their ingredients from nearly 30 different suppliers from local and international, and almost all are ""specialty"" operations"". In addition to special pies, Juliana also offers several salads to be paired with wine and beer as well as desserts. For DiFara fans, although Juliana is a different concept whereas DiFara is more old school. Many don't realize that DiFara has too fallen into that stardom trap. Hence, their increased pricing for a slice. Prior to the hype, it was $2.50 a slice and steadily climb to $6. A whole pie cost $32 and expect to wait 30 mins just to enter the place. Not including another hr or more for placing your order. Thanks to the popularity among the tourists, hipsters, and yuppies. Nobody has time for that nonsense. We definitely plan on returning with our daughter next time. Def recommend the outdoor seating for families with babies/toddlers. Unfortunately, the inside premise of Juliana's does not cater well to accommodate families with smaller children. It's a bit too congested due to full seating.",5.0
"Best Pizza in America? ...NO.Best Pizza in New York? ...Not even.In fact, I'm a little confused about the majority raving reviews, maybe I went on an off day... Or maybe it's just me... But I came in with low expectations already and the pizzas were just unimpressive still.Came here with 9 people, and we shared a large in their specialty pizzas of the majority that was on the menu; #1, #3,#4 and #5. The crust was not too thin or thick, soft with a nice chew... But just my personal preference, I would've liked it a bit more crispier.No. 1 - a no tomato sauce pizza with pancetta, mozarella, scallions and white truffle oil. I really enjoyed this pie a lot, even though this was perhaps the rest of my party's least favorite... Because I must agree with them, it was indeed very salty and the truffle oil was light to non existent.No. 3 - no tomato sauce pizza with mozarella, sausage, and broccoli rabe w/ garlic. My boyfriend loovess anything with the combination of broccoli rabe and sausage. In fact, he thought this would be the winner of them all. Sadly, this was my least favorite and no body enjoyed the pie either. It was boring and bland besides he bitterness from broccoli rabe... The sausages were dry instead of juicy.No. 4 - tomato, arugula, prosciutto, and mozzarella. So this is usually my go-to type of pizza every time I go to nice pizzerias. I lovee prosciutto and arugula, but this was no where on the list of the good ones I've had. The prosciutto they used were so thick and big.. It was hard to bite it off with the pizza... Instead it ended up just sliding off the pizza and getting all messy.No. 5 - sliced tomatos, goat cheese, smoked salmon and capers. Surprisingly very good!I don't know how TripAdvisor gave them the title ""Best Pizza in America"" because that is utterly absurd. Luzzo's, DiFara's, Campania's are a few that I could already name that's much better... I've had Grimaldi's before which was always just okay to me... But I was hoping Grimaldi's new named restaurant would be as good as how everybody who fell into the hype and said it was amazing.**Oh btw; may I also note the service wasn't too good either...

I'm not really a big fan of bacon, and thought it was too salty for my taste. The margherita was good in my opinion, but I've definitely had better from random pizza joints around Manhattan.

"""Why is this line of people wandering down the block?""If you're on Fulton Street in Brooklyn, it's probably because of Juliana's Pizza or its neighboring rival. Rather than motivating me to move on and find somewhere else to carb load for the next morning's race, I was intrigued to see what the long wait and hype was all about. That, and I was craving pizza anyway.Since it was just me, I walked up to the entrance and asked the kind gentlemen directing traffic into the very small restaurant if they had a bar. Yes, they do, but it only accommodates about 6-8 people. He said I could wait for something to open up, so I did. I started chatting with another guy, (also a runner, up from Long Island), who was in the exact same boat I was. Rather than wait for another hour or so to eat, we teamed up and decided to share a table at the hostess' subtle suggestion. Yeah, it sounds kinda weird and certainly had the potential to turn out to be very strange and awkward, but thankfully it was anything but. In fact, we decided to split a Margherita pie, knowing neither of us wanted to lug around a pizza box of leftovers after eating. In hindsight, this would not have been a problem at all because this pizza was so freakin' awesome! This beauty was a perfectly baked Neapolitan style crust from a coal fire oven, topped with tasty tomato sauce and plenty of cheese. Yeah, it quickly disappeared after we each inhaled four slices while chatting about the next morning's Brooklyn Half Marathon and enjoying a local micro-brew. I'm seriously craving it again just thinking and writing about it!Although this was not at all how I envisioned my late dinner playing out, it turned out to be a pleasant, convenient surprise and certainly a humorous memory in hindsight.

"Juliana's is definitely one of New York's elite pizzerias. It's up there with Di Fara, New Park, and Fornino. It's a nice thin crust with a light char. The sauce is good and the fresh mozzarella is uncompromised. The pizza is baked with the basil, so it still adds flavor yet it doesn't offer that element of freshness that uncooked basil has. The pie is very well seasoned; it's one of the best pies in terms of seasoning.On a Saturday night, our wait was about 45 minutes. Juliana's has a wide selection of bottled wines with several wines also offered by the glass. Also, they accept credit cards. All in all, I'd recommend coming here.",5.0

Service was awesome and fairly quick considering that there were PLENTY of mouths to feed.

"I must have different tastes because I did not think this pizza was that great and I prefer Grimaldi's. My friend and I waited maybe 15 min to get a table on the Sunday after 4th of July which isn't a bad wait...but was unnecessary as there were at least 3 tables that were empty!We ordered a pepperoni pizza and the spaghetti and meatballs. The pizza was just ok in my opinion, but I do like a crunchier crust and Juliana's was a little soggy in my opinion. Their famous meatballs were ok. They were very dense and tasted very meaty if that's what you're into. The spaghetti was pretty good. At first our waiter thought we ordered just the meatballs and brought out 3, but then when we explained we ordered them with the pasta, we only got 2. The spaghetti is more expensive, but I don't think the pasta is worth the price of another meatball! So I think they should have been priced the same.Anyway, overall I wasn't really impressed with the place. Our waiter seemed a little distracted even while taking our order and again, there were empty tables but a line outside the door. Just an OK place that I definitely wouldn't want to wait very long for.",3.0

The pizza here is prob one of the best pizza's i've had. great NYC pizza.I recommend the Margherita with pepperoni (the standard. delicious) and the No. 1 (a bit fancier, but the cheese and olive oil with pancetta... amazing, but if you like tomato sauce, just know that this doesn't have it)4 of us ordered those 2 pies (small) and ended up paying around $15 each tax/tip included so a pretty solid deal for 4 slices!I'll def be back!",5.0
"I don't frequent Brooklyn often, but when I do, it's for pizza. And let me tell you, Juliana's was definitely worth the ""trek"" #jokes. I ordered Patsy's Housemade Soup--the Pasta Pasilli--to start and already, I was sold. Delicious and flavorful, it was the perfect start to the meal. My friend and I then decided to split a large Margherita Pizza with Garlic + Onions on top. I've always thought that Grimaldi's pizza is pretty much as good as pizza can get, but somehow, Juliana's managed to prove me wrong. It was amazing. We then finished off the meal with Carol's Cannoli and a slice of New York Cheesecake. I've never been the biggest fan of cannolis, but dang, was that a good one. The cheesecake on the other hand was good, but was nothing spectacular.Throughout the meal, Patsy Grimaldi himself stopped by our table to chat with us, which made me so happy. I mean, I was talking to the pizza god himself! Smiles all around. He even let us snap a photo with him before we left, which unfortunately, did not capture me peeing my pants at the exact moment.

If you're a white pizza fan, like myself, this may be the best pizza you've ever eaten. I have never tasted a topping combo orchestrated so well. This, my friends, is the real deal.Was the service or the setting five stars? No. Was the wait time five stars? No. But this pizza is five stars. I would give it 5 1/2 if I could. Life-changing, brag to your friends, must-do when you are in NYC!P.S. Read a little bit about the history of this place. It's hilarious!",5.0
"""Why is this line of people wandering down the block?""If you're on Fulton Street in Brooklyn, it's probably because of Juliana's Pizza or its neighboring rival. Rather than motivating me to move on and find somewhere else to carb load for the next morning's race, I was intrigued to see what the long wait and hype was all about. That, and I was craving pizza anyway.Since it was just me, I walked up to the entrance and asked the kind gentlemen directing traffic into the very small restaurant if they had a bar. Yes, they do, but it only accommodates about 6-8 people. He said I could wait for something to open up, so I did. I started chatting with another guy, (also a runner, up from Long Island), who was in the exact same boat I was. Rather than wait for another hour or so to eat, we teamed up and decided to share a table at the hostess' subtle suggestion. Yeah, it sounds kinda weird and certainly had the potential to turn out to be very strange and awkward, but thankfully it was anything but. In fact, we decided to split a Margherita pie, knowing neither of us wanted to lug around a pizza box of leftovers after eating. In hindsight, this would not have been a problem at all because this pizza was so freakin' awesome! This beauty was a perfectly baked Neapolitan style crust from a coal fire oven, topped with tasty tomato sauce and plenty of cheese. Yeah, it quickly disappeared after we each inhaled four slices while chatting about the next morning's Brooklyn Half Marathon and enjoying a local micro-brew. I'm seriously craving it again just thinking and writing about it!Although this was not at all how I envisioned my late dinner playing out, it turned out to be a pleasant, convenient surprise and certainly a humorous memory in hindsight. And all of that at only half the cost!",5.0
"Juliana's is definitely one of New York's elite pizzerias. It's up there with Di Fara, New Park, and Fornino. It's a nice thin crust with a light char. The sauce is good and the fresh mozzarella is uncompromised. The pizza is baked with the basil, so it still adds flavor yet it doesn't offer that element of freshness that uncooked basil has. The pie is very well seasoned; it's one of the best pies in terms of seasoning.On a Saturday night, our wait was about 45 minutes. Juliana's has a wide selection of bottled wines with several wines also offered by the glass. Also, they accept credit cards. All in all, I'd recommend coming here.",5.0
"I lived in Brooklyn for seven years and it was my second time back since then. During the first trip we at some pizza place in Soho and I told my partner there is nothing like a Brooklyn slice, so this time we we went with my idea. The location is gorgeous, with views of the pier and the bridge. The place was packed on a Tuesday so that means your in the right area. Service was awesome and fairly quick considering that there were PLENTY of mouths to feed. Anyways, it was the best pizza I ever had, we got the margarita and added pepperoni and extra cheese on it (kinda odd choice I know). Fresh, fresh, fresh, oh lord it was perfect. Crust was not to thin, good amount of sauce, no complaints at all.",5.0
Normally I don't much have to say about pizza as long as it's very cheesy. The pizza here is very good ~ thin crest and very cheesy. Thank god me and my friends were very lucky we didn't have to wait. I heard there is normally long lines,5.0
"I must have different tastes because I did not think this pizza was that great and I prefer Grimaldi's. My friend and I waited maybe 15 min to get a table on the Sunday after 4th of July which isn't a bad wait...but was unnecessary as there were at least 3 tables that were empty!We ordered a pepperoni pizza and the spaghetti and meatballs. The pizza was just ok in my opinion, but I do like a crunchier crust and Juliana's was a little soggy in my opinion. Their famous meatballs were ok. They were very dense and tasted very meaty if that's what you're into. The spaghetti was pretty good. At first our waiter thought we ordered just the meatballs and brought out 3, but then when we explained we ordered them with the pasta, we only got 2. The spaghetti is more expensive, but I don't think the pasta is worth the price of another meatball! So I think they should have been priced the same.Anyway, overall I wasn't really impressed with the place. Our waiter seemed a little distracted even while taking our order and again, there were empty tables but a line outside the door. Just an OK place that I definitely wouldn't want to wait very long for.",3.0
"So most of you probably already know, but THIS is the real grimaldi's. after grimaldi retired, he came back but with Juliana's. so this is pretty much the real grimaldi's minus the long line of tourists. However... there still is a line to wait, so get there early!you know that a pizza is good when the crust is so good you want to eat every last morsel of carb on your plate. The pizza here is prob one of the best pizza's i've had. great NYC pizza.I recommend the Margherita with pepperoni (the standard. delicious) and the No. 1 (a bit fancier, but the cheese and olive oil with pancetta... amazing, but if you like tomato sauce, just know that this doesn't have it)4 of us ordered those 2 pies (small) and ended up paying around $15 each tax/tip included so a pretty solid deal for 4 slices!I'll def be back!",5.0
"I don't frequent Brooklyn often, but when I do, it's for pizza. And let me tell you, Juliana's was definitely worth the ""trek"" #jokes. I ordered Patsy's Housemade Soup--the Pasta Pasilli--to start and already, I was sold. Delicious and flavorful, it was the perfect start to the meal. My friend and I then decided to split a large Margherita Pizza with Garlic + Onions on top. I've always thought that Grimaldi's pizza is pretty much as good as pizza can get, but somehow, Juliana's managed to prove me wrong. It was amazing. We then finished off the meal with Carol's Cannoli and a slice of New York Cheesecake. I've never been the biggest fan of cannolis, but dang, was that a good one. The cheesecake on the other hand was good, but was nothing spectacular.Throughout the meal, Patsy Grimaldi himself stopped by our table to chat with us, which made me so happy. I mean, I was talking to the pizza god himself! Smiles all around. He even let us snap a photo with him before we left, which unfortunately, did not capture me peeing my pants at the exact moment. Ah, well. Thanks for an amazing meal, Patsy! We will definitely be back soon.",5.0
"The wait was worth it, albeit it was cold outside. The staff was very nice and chill, not rushing us to order, eat or leave.  We ordered a large sausage & garlic, a small pepperoni, an order of spaghetti & butter (for a picky eater) & the apple pie with ice cream. Everything was delicious, so delicious that even the picky eater who never eats pizza tried it & really liked it.",5.0
"Being from LA, this is the NY style pizza I always imagined. Seriously, the best pizza I have ever had.",5.0
"Before eating-Juliana's needs to say on their website that they close in the middle of the afternoon to reset the ovens. They said they would reopen at 4, then 4:15, now 4:30 and nothing. I don't mind waiting for a table but if you don't even let people know you close when the hours clearly say open, then you should disclose the real facts. #wastedtimeAfter eating-as expected, the pizza was fantastic and deserving of the high praise we read about. 4 stars because of the unexpected wait time that was out of the ordinary. We would return for sure, just not and mid afternoon closing time.",4.0
Glad to see Yelp got it right here. Juliana's is far superior to Grimaldi's. Their service and atmosphere is just so much better. Grimaldis is a dungeon with plastic forks and paper plates and not even a salad on the menu. Juliana's is a pleasant place to be and the owner is a sweetheart. The pizza is just the icing. Delicious.,4.0
"One of the guys in our group went through the entire explanation of how Grimaldi's became Grimaldi's became Juliana's but there's still the other Grimaldi's....and it made about as much sense to me as that sentence just did to you.The place is crowded and packed, although the line still pales in comparison to the Grimaldi's down the block. We did our order for takeout, and it was not without some waiting and delays that we managed to get our two pizzas.One thing to note, as far as being transportable goes, Juliana's pizza bags kind of suck. Don't do a takeout pizza unless you're taking it very nearby.We got talked out of doing a fancier pizza by the same guy who told us the Grimaldi saga and ended up with a cheese pie and a pepperoni pie. Both pies were delicious. Great crispy crust, wonderful cheese-to-sauce ratio, and the sauce was one of the best I've had on NYC pizzas, both tangy and sweet. The pepperoni  slices were small and just slightly scorched, which added a nice chew and extra flavor. I will note that the pepperoni pizza is a grease bucket; you can tilt a pizza slice and literally watch the oil drip down. But then again, what do you really expect? Basil is a nice touch too.The bottom line here is that the pizza is excellent. So yes, make sure you check this one off your NYC pizza list.",5.0
"Oh my goodness, this is really as good as it gets. You do have to pay the price in the wait though. We waited for almost two hours! The place is not very big but what is nice is that they don't cram people inside by making the seating close. Back to the wait, it was borderline rediculous but when you hear happy customers leaving saying the wait is worth it, there's nothing you can do but stay!Here's the secret though, they actually shut down at 3:15 and reopen at 4 so if you get there around 3:30 you'll only have to wait an hour and be seated right away! THE PIZZA THOUGH. We ordered a marinara with half peperoni half mushroom NOM. The ingredients were so fresh but the peperoni was the super star. Then we got the #3 which was good too but there was no sauce and that is where we went wrong with ordering. Service was great because when we told them we didnt realize it didnt come with sauce, they brought us some. Both pizzas were 30$ each but it fed my family of 5.Cannot wait to go back !",5.0

Best tip: if you can, get the takeout - it really saves you time and you still get the same delicious pizza!",5.0
Pizza and service were decent ! One of my favorite place to eat a pizza! Will definitely come back again.,5.0
"We waited about a half hour before we were seated on a Sunday afternoon, and let me tell you, it was definitely worth the wait! We ordered the special 1, and it is probably one of the best pizzas I have ever had. The ingredients were so fresh and tasty. It was so well balanced, and after eating 3 slices from a large I was comfortably full. Because it's thin sliced and well made, I didn't feel overly bloated or heavy after eating. This is how I can tell they use good ingredients.",5.0
"Juliana's was on our places to go to in NY with the intention of just grabbing a slice, but further research showed that they only serve by the pie so I didn't think about going anymore. However, our itinerary changed and we were able to go to Juliana's in the end and I was SO glad we did! It's right next Grimaldi's, but I heard Juliana's was way better and we have a Grimaldi's back in Dallas. It was storming outside so luckily, the line wasn't horribly long when we went. While waiting, I read an article they stuck on the outside of the restaurant describing the history of the rivalry between Juliana's and Grimaldi's. Very interesting! And made me respect the restaurant even more.Now for the food. We shared the Brooklyn style egg cream and the No. 1 pizza. I've never had an egg cream before, but it's very interesting. Essentially tasted like chocolate soda. The pizza was so amazing. I haven't been eating much during our trip but I ate more than my boyfriend did here. We ordered a large which I think is enough for 2 people. We had a slice leftover that we ate for breakfast the next day, and it made me wish we ordered another pie. Definitely one of the highlights of this trip!",5.0
"We waited 45mins, including a period of ""closure due to oven stocking."" But once re-opened, a large chunk of the queue managed to enter the restaurant including us.Once seated, we were quickly served. Tip: order quickly! Or else you'll face our problem of waiting for everyone else to be done even before our pizza arrived :/ We ordered the Half-half margherita and white pizza w garlic. Pizza was really good, especially noticeable by thin base that does not easily break. But was it out of the States.

"4.5 stars!The most authentic pizza that the Mexicans chefs can come up in this side off the Atlantic :DSimple ingredients, made in front of you.

"$30ish for a pizza? WORTH IT. We decided to go for Juliana's over Grimaldi's per recommendation of other yelpers (a chef from Grimaldi's opened Juliana's right next door). I don't remember all the ingredients of the pizza we ordered but it was #1 of the specialties and it had bacon. I'd honestly say getting a specialty pizza is worth it, especially if it's your first time. Don't get a classic.. You can get a margherita pizza anywhere. We asked the waitress what she liked and we just went for it. If you're a smaller party try to get seats at the counter!! It's like VIP seating - you get to watch the chefs make the pizzas :) Great venue by the waterfront & city bike station. Excellent service. Best pizza I've ever had.",5.0

"Oh, the long strange tale of Grimaldi's pizza. Okay, so if you want the taste of the original Grimaldi's pizza WITHOUT the ridiculously long wait and IN THE ORIGINAL location of Grimaldi's, go to Juliana's Pizza. It's owned and operated by the original owners of Grimaldi's.In my opinion, the crust is a crispier, which I prefer (my fiance thinks the crust is thinner too, but I'm not so sure about that), but the it's the same great taste that you would expect from Grimaldi's - classic old school New York pizza baked in a coal oven - without any of the hassles. There is a  bit of a line, but nothing like next door. Let the tourists wait at Grimaldi's, go to Juliana's.",4.0
"Great margarita pizza. We had a super  friendly waiter, nice bottle of wine. And surprisingly there was no wait on a Friday night and we even found parking right across the street.

We took taxi from Memorial 911 to here on Monday 11/30 at around 12:30. There was no line on both pizza places. We choose Juliana since they accept Visa credit card. The other one is Cash Only. We ordered Basic Pizza with pepperoni and sausage. We do not have to wait long. It is about 10-15 minutes. This pizza has thin crust, a little salty. I wish there is more cheese and    meat. I kind of disappointed. To me, deep disk pizza in Chicago is a lot better. Even pizza at my home town SugarLand is also better than here. It is such a waste of time and taxi fare to come here just for so so pizza. If you are tourist and you stay at time square are, there are many pizza stores at 44th @ 8th.

"Nothing much has changed since Julianna's decided to take back the Grimaldi spot. The owner still walks around having casual chit chat with customers.

We ordered the Margarita and a #4, which was essentially the Margarita with prosciutto and arugula. Two pizza pies were a bit much for two people but since we are fat asses, it didn't stop us. The pizza is good but I'm more of a fan of salted cheese like John's or even NY style pizza by the slice. The Brookie bridge was an ice cream sandwich.

"I had never been to New York, but I knew that New York was supposed to have some of the best pizza in the nation, and who doesn't like Pizza.  So on my visit to New York one of the things on the top of my list was the best pizza I could find.  Julianna's is that place.  This conclusion was not randomly arrived at either.  We did our homework and new all about those other places like Lombardi's and Grimaldi's that were supposed to be it for New York Pizza.  We had one resident of SoHo tell us, ""Ah be careful Lombardi's is coming up.  No don't look, you'll burn your eyes out for gazing upon that house of sacrilege."" Grimaldi's we were told had been sold a few years earlier and was no longer owned or operated by the people who made it famous and just wasn't the same.  We heard about of other less famous places as well, like Di Fara's,  but in the end we were told that if you want a proper and authentic New York pizza (not Neapolitian but New York), then off to Brooklyn or more precisely DUMBO we must go and then arrive at Julianna's.And this recommendation came from the people working at Mario Batali's place.  So that's what we did.  Juliana's we found out was owned and operated by the family that used to own Grimaldi's.  Apparently a few years back, so guy who loved Grimaldi's decided that he liked it so much he wanted to own it.  So he bought it.  Well after cashing this guy's check the family that had owned Grimaldi's took their deep dark pizza magic and opened up a new place called Julianna's... immediately next to Grimaldi's.  When we asked one of the waitresses at Julianna's if this was true, her response was, ""Yep, this is the real deal and the Grimaldi's are nobody.""Hard to argue that.  We arrived a little before the lunch hour, which was good, because had we shown up any later, we would have been in a very long line waiting for lunch.   The restaurant itself is very clean, black and white themed with an open-to-view pizza making station at the back with a coal fired oven.  Yes coal.   I had heard of a wood fired pizza oven, but here apparently the fuel of choice is coal, and there at the back is a blazing pizza oven with a heavy iron door too hot to touch being fed with shovels of black rock.  Stacked to one side of this are wooden boxes filled with round balls of fresh dough that are rolled and tossed into pies on white marble counter tops by 2-3 guys  before being fed into  the aforementioned oven.    I've had all kinds of pizza from all kinds of different places, but this... Whenever I have previously craved pizza, I've had in my mind this vision of a delicious perfect pizza.  Unfortunately, real-life rarely lives up to the imagination.Julianna's though delivered the stuff of pizza dreams.  We ordered the classic pepperoni and sausage pizza and received what I believe to be the most classically authentic and perfect pizza I have ever had.  If Plato had ever been so lucky as to have tried this, he would have declared it the Ideal pizza delivered straight from the Third Realm.  My only regret is that now whenever I want pizza, the only way to truly get what I want will be to go to Brooklyn.  Then as if that wasn't enough, we tried the New York cheese cake.   This cheesecake was exactly what people really want when they ask for New York cheesecake, and having sampled it, I finally know why.  It turns out that the cheesecake was not made on site though, and when we asked who did make it they servers weren't allowed to tell us.",5.0

"I was on a mission (that I dragged my mom and sister along for): to get legit pizza in Brooklyn. While on the Gray Line night tour Friday before Memorial Day, our tour guide pointed out Grimaldi's and Juliana's and told us the story about the two neighboring pizza joints (if you know, you know hehehh). So I came back the following Saturday afternoon (mind you, this was Memorial Day weekend) on a stop from the City Sightseeing hop on/off ferry tour. It was a quick 5min walk from the ferry stop at the bottom of Fulton St and you can't miss it! If you are walking up from where the ferry stops, its on the left hand side past the Shake Shack and before Grimaldi's. Naturally, since it was Memorial Day weekend...the line was long. My sis and I waited in line while my mom went to the front to inquire about take-out options. She returned to us with menus and said they can do anything from their menu for take out. Perfect!! We decided on a large white pie with addons (regular anchovies, meatballs, and crimini mushrooms) and a small #4 (tomato, mozz, arugula, and prosciutto). If you want takeout, then you can go to the front of the line and order at the register on the right immediately after you walk inside. After I ordered and paid there, they said to come back to the same spot in ~35mins where my pizzas would be waiting for me! They also let my mom and sis use their restroom which was nice of them :)So we went to get ice cream at the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory while we waited and about 25mins had passed. I decided to walk up and see if the pizzas were ready ahead of schedule. Sure enough, after only 30mins, the pizzas were at the register, ready for me to take and enjoy! However, by the time we picked up the pizzas, we had to get in line to get back on the ferry to Manhattan, and since it was pretty difficult to eat on a jam-packed ferry and eating was not allowed on our Gray Line tour bus back to midtown, it was a good couple of hours before we got to dig in to the pizzas at our midtown hotel. Man...the pizza was good warm, it must be even better when its hot and fresh! I really liked both pies we ordered. The arugula on the #4 was refreshing and slightly wilted (probably from being in the paper pizza bag for 2hrs) but still had a crunch. The meatballs, to my surprise, were not balls, but slices of meatballs (I think?). Or maybe I didn't get the correct order and those slices of heaven were not in fact meatballs. Doesn't matter to me, it was still great! If I ever find myself back at Juliana's, I'd like to order takeout to eat at the park...that seems like it would be the perfect lunch!TL;DR - skip the line for takeout, try the meatballs and #4, and still awesome pizza after a long and arduous journey from Brooklyn to midtown!",4.0
"Juliana's is definitely better than Grimaldi's. So, Juliana's owner used to be Grimaldi's owner. He retired and sold Grimaldi's. Grimaldi's became a franchise because everyone loved Grimaldi's.

They have a pretty good variety of beer.  I ordered Apple cider and my hubby got Brooklyn ale winter special and both were yummy.   We originally wanted to order half margherita and half special number 1 pizza.   However,  when we asked to our server,  he said we can't order special pizza and regular pizza together.   But he tried to give us alternatives to accommodate us.   At the end, We decided to go with a large special number 1 pizza instead though.   The pizza was delicious!!We wanted to order the dessert but to full.   We have been to gimaldi's also.   I know it is not accurate comparison as we did not order exact the sane pizza.   However, we liked juliana's more in every aspect.   We would love to come back when we get a chance.

"The best pizza in Brooklyn, hands down. It doesn't get more authentic then Juliana's. I recommend ordering pick up, and taking your delicious pie into Brooklyn Bridge Park on a gorgeous sunny day overlooking downtown and The Brooklyn Bridge. My personal favorite on the take out menu: No. 5!  Enjoy!",5.0
"I am happy to report that while DUMBO has not lived up to its promise of being another Soho, Juliana's and Grimaldi's on Front Street are still a big draw for tourists and city residents alike.Juliana's is next door to Grimaldi's.  What it lacks in size it makes up with its cozy feel, efficient service and, to boot, great pizza!  The Margherita pizza is a classic.  I think the tomato sauce is unmatched.  The bread doesn't seem to hold on to the heat very well, progressively getting harder to cut through as the meal progresses.  Juliana's also carries soups and salads, but unless you are a pie-hater or they (or you) run out of dough, you should get their pizza.  Note that the small is more than one person can comfortably finish, but the large is barely sufficient for two.  Patsy Grimaldi shows up from time to time.  But you will be struck more by the diversity of the diners here.  The pizza is certainly worth a 30 minute wait, in the same way that Di Fara is worth an hour's wait!",4.0
"Got in line 10 mins before they opened after there 3:30-4:00 closer. They do this to change out the coals and relight new ones. It is important so the oven stays hot and cooks the pizza at the right temperature. Ordered a mushroom pizza and #2 special. It was phenomenal and so thin. Love the fact that it is crispy but also not dry. The line gets long so you can always place a to go order if your in a hurry. But if your in Brooklyn and hungry for some pizza, stop here.",5.0
"If you know the true story, then we all know Patsy is pizza king! Grimaldis next door can keep their pizza..",5.0
"After an hour of waiting, we were seated at the counter and were rewarded with both the view of the cooks assembling and firing the pies (their speed is mesmerizing) as well as two excellent pizzas. The #1, a white pie with bacon and smoked mozzarella, and a margherita with pepperoni were both excellent. Next time, though, i'll skip the $3 mini bottle of diet coke.",5.0
"I was on a mission (that I dragged my mom and sister along for): to get legit pizza in Brooklyn. While on the Gray Line night tour Friday before Memorial Day, our tour guide pointed out Grimaldi's and Juliana's and told us the story about the two neighboring pizza joints (if you know, you know hehehh). So I came back the following Saturday afternoon (mind you, this was Memorial Day weekend) on a stop from the City Sightseeing hop on/off ferry tour. It was a quick 5min walk from the ferry stop at the bottom of Fulton St and you can't miss it! If you are walking up from where the ferry stops, its on the left hand side past the Shake Shack and before Grimaldi's. Naturally, since it was Memorial Day weekend...the line was long. My sis and I waited in line while my mom went to the front to inquire about take-out options. She returned to us with menus and said they can do anything from their menu for take out. Perfect!! We decided on a large white pie with addons (regular anchovies, meatballs, and crimini mushrooms) and a small #4 (tomato, mozz, arugula, and prosciutto). If you want takeout, then you can go to the front of the line and order at the register on the right immediately after you walk inside. After I ordered and paid there, they said to come back to the same spot in ~35mins where my pizzas would be waiting for me! They also let my mom and sis use their restroom which was nice of them :)So we went to get ice cream at the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory while we waited and about 25mins had passed. I decided to walk up and see if the pizzas were ready ahead of schedule. Sure enough, after only 30mins, the pizzas were at the register, ready for me to take and enjoy! However, by the time we picked up the pizzas, we had to get in line to get back on the ferry to Manhattan, and since it was pretty difficult to eat on a jam-packed ferry and eating was not allowed on our Gray Line tour bus back to midtown, it was a good couple of hours before we got to dig in to the pizzas at our midtown hotel. Man...the pizza was good warm, it must be even better when its hot and fresh! I really liked both pies we ordered. The arugula on the #4 was refreshing and slightly wilted (probably from being in the paper pizza bag for 2hrs) but still had a crunch. The meatballs, to my surprise, were not balls, but slices of meatballs (I think?). Or maybe I didn't get the correct order and those slices of heaven were not in fact meatballs. Doesn't matter to me, it was still great! If I ever find myself back at Juliana's, I'd like to order takeout to eat at the park...that seems like it would be the perfect lunch!TL;DR - skip the line for takeout, try the meatballs and #4, and still awesome pizza after a long and arduous journey from Brooklyn to midtown!",4.0
"Juliana's is definitely better than Grimaldi's. So, Juliana's owner used to be Grimaldi's owner. He retired and sold Grimaldi's. Grimaldi's became a franchise because everyone loved Grimaldi's. But after it was sold the owner got tired of being retired so he opened a new pizza store with his own recipe . He's the best!!!!",5.0
"I was craving good pizza and in NYC it's hard to choose a place because there are sooo many good ones to pick from. I saw this place had good reviews on yelp and decided to give it a try. We ordered Italian hot chocolate because it was cold out and a large margharita pepperoni pizza. The pizza was good, we were pleased. The small pepperonis they use are delicious! Next time I'd order a different kind of pie just to try something different.",4.0

The crust was perfectly crisp on the bottom and the upper layers of dough were chewy. Excellent bready flavor. Awesome bubbly caramelization on the mozzarella. Delicious, well balanced tomato sauce. They were skimpy on the basil, though. Still, quite yummy!The other pizza we ordered was the No 1: a white pizza with housemade mozzarella and scamorza affumicata (an Italian mozzarella-like cheese, smoked), pancetta, scallions, and white truffle in olive oil. I'm getting hungry just thinking of this. Everyone loved this pizza. Such an awesome combo of salty, creamy, smoky flavors.

"If Yelp had 6 stars, Juliana's would deserve them all. Even late at night, this little gem of a pizza joint was packed, with a 45-minute long line outside.

And, while we waited in line, he came through and personally spoke with each and every customer, genuinely interested in their story. I had the caesar salad with white anchovies and green olives... really excellent. Then came the pizza, washed down with local Brooklyn beer from the tap. The crust was just the right mix of chewy and crunch, cooked in an amazing old oven. The best pizza I've ever tasted. I usually eat pretty quickly, but for this one I slowed down... I didn't want it to end. Finished off with the cannoli - a real treat. A lot of other pizzas are ruined for me now.",5.0
"OMGI usually review places I love rather quickly because human nature tends us to do that (or if we hate it). But in this case, I was in utter shock from how AMAZING and perfect this pizza was.I am a big pizza dude. I've tried all the big ones (for the most prt) and I won't mention names, but Juliana's has earned its place for me in the top of the list.My brother and I ordered the margherita with extra mozzarella, sausage, and ricotta. As I said before, OMG. The quality of these ingredients, the balance of the dough, sauce, cheese, sausage, and ricotta was perfect. I ordered the organic black berry cola which was the perfect balance to a perfect pizza.The dough and crust was so well cooked and so perfect. We literally licked our plates because the thought of even wasting a drop of that sauce would be considered a sin, and my brother and I never sin :)But seriously, skip that line at Grimaldi's because this is the real deal. It isn't even in the same conversation because Juliana's just blows it out of the water. Instead of reading every single word I wrote here (although you already did since I wrote this at the endow my review), let my picture speak for itself. Thank you Juliana's and I promise this was the first time I tried you and it certainly won't be the last. Great service by the way too!",5.0
"Juliana's is often compared to Grimaldi's (not to mention they are located right next to each other), but for me, Juliana's is the clear winner hands down. Their menu is very diverse, and you even have the option of ordering half-and-half (so that you can try two different types of pizza at once when you order a pan). And each of their individual pizza toppings are splendid, although the classic pepperoni is also a favorite that you can never go wrong with.The restaurant also has a cute and bright décor. But what truly won me over was the service. Despite the long line, you are soon greeted by friendly servers who are eager to explain each of the toppings/flavor and/or suggest for you when you ask. And despite the small location, there are also two different bathrooms. And while in line to wait for the bathroom, I had the pleasure of meeting and conversing with two of the employees, who were so very friendly (and helped me make my decision when ordering later). You can tell that they love working there; one even stated that he never gets sick of eating their own pizzas haha.I've gone to this restaurant several times now, each time with a different friend who happens to be visiting me in NY. And I'll probably continue to suggest this place as many more times as I possibly can. In love with this place!",5.0

"Im glad my brother took me to Brooklyn for pizza,  we had simple Margherita Pizza and it was good. Thin crust, good tops, we had it basic, no extra topping and it was one of best I had. Im still trying to search for that kind of pizza, in Toronto with no luck",4.0
"I hate it when restaurant closes between lunch and dinner. Am I gonna make it to sit down or be turn down after I waited in line? Ugh.. Made it in with last 6 people on line. Ordered white pizza with pancetta and truffle oil. I love anything truffle, I know the taste, I crave it, I want it lol. Sadly this pizza didn't even have the slightest flavor or even scent of truffles or truffle oil. I was so disappointed. It was a good pizza, but if you want truffle flavor, this is not the item to order. Normally at this point my rating would go down to two stars, but the polite and friendly service made up for it.

"Why Juliana's and not Grimaldi's?  After reading the story behind each, I wanted to try the original Grimaldi's which became Juliana's.My friend and I walked up to the historic restaurant and were seated immediately in the dining room that only had two occupied tables.  It was just before noon on a very warm weekend day so we had expected crowds.  By the time we had left all the tables were taken, so I guess we had great timing.We decided to split a pizza.  The choices all looked so good but we decided to split  the special with tomato, mozzarella, arugula and prosciutto, size large.  That pizza was as close to perfection as it was going to get.  Thin crust, lightly charred.  The crust never became soggy, even in the middle.  The ratio of sauce to cheese to toppings was perfect, as was the level of seasoning and freshness of the ingredients.  Nothing slid off the pie, nor was one area of the pie more dense than another.  I have only good things to say about this pizza.  This is what I think of as ""New York"" pizza.  It was 10x better than Lombardi's (I was dragged there...it's a total tourist magnet).  I only wish I could have been able to try other pizzas but the large was a good size for two adults.Service was great, no complaints at all.  I appreciated their attention to detail in ensuring that we enjoyed our experience.My friend and I had walked across the Brooklyn Bridge and found Juliana's without too much difficulty.  It's near the waterfront with a nice park nearby.",5.0

"I visited Juliana's for the the first time last year and it was so good that I had to take my friend there when we were there for her birthday. We were there on a Sunday afternoon, and the line was a lot shorter than I remember. In 20 minutes, we were seated and had ordered our pizza. Juliana's has my favorite kind of pizza, thin woodfire pizza with a soft crust. We ordered just a basic pepperoni, and we were very happy with our decision. The sauce is delicious and anything you get on top would be delicious. I definitely recommend waiting in line here since you won't be disappointed when you sit down. It is a small restaurant, but the service is fantastic and they have a wide variety of pizza options.",5.0
"I would give it a 4.5 if I could, better than most but not on the same level as Di Farras out in Midwood, BK. It was a rainy x mas eve, so the line wasn't as long as usual (10-15 minute wait). The service was average. However, the pies live up to the reputation, they are fresh, simple and delicious. We had a Margherita and a Margherita with pork sausage, onion and pepper, both were amazing. By chance we got seated at the bar/ table top seating right in front of the chef and brick over which was an added bonus.",4.0
"If Yelp had 6 stars, Juliana's would deserve them all. Even late at night, this little gem of a pizza joint was packed, with a 45-minute long line outside. Situated right next to the franchised Grimaldi's restaurant, this is the new home of the original proprietor, Grimaldi himself. And, while we waited in line, he came through and personally spoke with each and every customer, genuinely interested in their story. I had the caesar salad with white anchovies and green olives... really excellent. Then came the pizza, washed down with local Brooklyn beer from the tap. The crust was just the right mix of chewy and crunch, cooked in an amazing old oven. The best pizza I've ever tasted. I usually eat pretty quickly, but for this one I slowed down... I didn't want it to end. Finished off with the cannoli - a real treat. A lot of other pizzas are ruined for me now.",5.0
"OMGI usually review places I love rather quickly because human nature tends us to do that (or if we hate it). But in this case, I was in utter shock from how AMAZING and perfect this pizza was.I am a big pizza dude. I've tried all the big ones (for the most prt) and I won't mention names, but Juliana's has earned its place for me in the top of the list.My brother and I ordered the margherita with extra mozzarella, sausage, and ricotta. As I said before, OMG. The quality of these ingredients, the balance of the dough, sauce, cheese, sausage, and ricotta was perfect. I ordered the organic black berry cola which was the perfect balance to a perfect pizza.The dough and crust was so well cooked and so perfect. We literally licked our plates because the thought of even wasting a drop of that sauce would be considered a sin, and my brother and I never sin :)But seriously, skip that line at Grimaldi's because this is the real deal. It isn't even in the same conversation because Juliana's just blows it out of the water. Instead of reading every single word I wrote here (although you already did since I wrote this at the endow my review), let my picture speak for itself. Thank you Juliana's and I promise this was the first time I tried you and it certainly won't be the last. Great service by the way too!",5.0

Then, lightly sprinkle the sauce on top.  There are so many different pizzas, but it's fun watching them make one pizza after another, they definitely have their system.  It was surprisingly cool, considering how close we were to the coal oven, I think they thought ahead on this one.  They serve bottled soda instead of fountain tapped soda.  We decided to get ""Julia's"" housemade meatballs with tomato sauce as an appetizer.  The meatballs were soft and flavorful.  The sauce was a good compliment.  For the pizza, we got the No. 4, the tomato, mozarella, arugula and prosciutto (Italian ham). It is a thin crust pizza.  They give you silverware and you try to eat it with the silverware, but then, you just break down and start eating with your hands. Make sure you wash them.  My girlfriend and I can eat, but because of the meatballs, we couldn't finish the pizza. They wrapped it up to go for us, in aluminum foil, then in a to-go bag.  They did a good job wrapping it up for us. Overall impression:The pizza was about par, but the experience of being in DUMBO, standing in line, then seeing how it was made was what put this place over the top and a definite recommend.  If it is only to say you've been here, it's worth it.

"Juliana's is a must when you're exploring Dumbo and Brooklyn Bridge Park.   There're many positives about the newer pizza joint in this historic location.  For one, it's a beautiful space, I love the comfortable and spacious seating arrangement which includes a bar that can score you a birdseye view of your your pizza being assembled and cooked in the oven, which is quite entertaining.It's also a shorter wait as opposed to the line for Grimaldi's.  Every time  I've been here, the line always seem to be half the size of the one for the neighboring Grimaldi's.  Which is great if your're starving!The staff is always friendly and upbeat, which is always appreciated,  especially when catering to a touristy crowd.And the pizza itself is Good, buttery crust on the drier side.  Fresh Ingridents.  The pizza always looks gourmetish to me, just the way I like it.Everything is almost impeccable about Juliana's, except if you're a vegetarian or a vegan or a person who's in any way strick about the way  your food is prepared, I would be cautious about dining here.  As I've observed that the preparation of the pizza is done in a way where it's easy for the person making your pizza to have handled meats from previous orders.  It's quite possible that your veggie pizza was made by the same guy that  just assembled the meatlover's special that the couple is enjoying next to you.  Not a big deal to most people, but some customers might be particular about this.Juliana's is definitely a place to try while in Brooklyn, but at the same time, some folks should be cautious.",4.0
"Features:-If you don't know about the story behind this place and the owner (Patsy), you should read about it on Wikipedia.  It is quite interesting.  -We had the Margherita pizza with prosciutto.  It had tomato, mozzarella, and basil.  The mozarella cheese was enticing, it melted so quickly in my mouth.  The mozarella with tomato sauce made the pizza taste so distinctive and tasteful.Improvements:-The pizza we had was a bit too salty (probably from the prosciutto) but overrall, probably one of best pizzas I've had in NY thus far.-Long line like Grimaldi's but this restaurant moved its customers quicker.-Service was a bit slow probably because there were so many customers.Tips:-Do not come hungry. -Get a pizza with mozzarella cheese!

"I stumbled upon this place after eating at Grimaldi's one day. Standing there reading about the history of Patsy Grimaldi, I was shocked to find out Juliana's was owned and operated by the original owner. This was when I was approaced by an older man with a pleasant and warm welcome asking if I'd like to come inside and try his pie. I was disappointed, being on the west coast has deprived me of good pizza and when I do come back to visit I jump at any chance to visit a place with REAL NY coal oven PIE. I told him I wished I had visited his restaurant first. He inquired and asked where I was visiting and if my experience was good next door. I told him it was good, but not as good as it used to be. ""That's good, that's good. I'm glad you had a good dinner. When do you leave? You can still come back and try mine if you have time.""A man who could've jumped and talked shit about my experience, didn't. In true OG italian Don fashion, you let your work speak for itself. For that, you've earned my money. I came back the next day and ordered the usual- pepperoni, sausage, mushroom, basil, and garlic. PHENOMENAL. I'm glad you came out of retirement, sir.",4.0

"The Patsy Grimaldi story is a complex saga of pizza love, loyalty and betrayal.And really amazing pizza.Long story short: Patsy Grimaldi sold Grimaldi's on 19 Old Fulton street to Frank Ciolli in 1998. Frank Ciolli began opening Grimaldi chains in 2003. From 2003 to 2005, the Ciolli and Grimaldi's relationship soured, the business relations ended. In 2005, a rent dispute between Frank Ciolli and his landlord led to Ciolli's eviction. Which lent Patsy Grimaldi the opportunity to make pizzas again.Regardless of the pizza drama, the coal fueled brick oven has remained. And the space remodeled to black tables and silver chairs. Feels less claustrophobic compared to their 2008 classic pizza joint seating. And the food? And the cheese is fresh and the sauce is sweet without being cloying. The charred crust is lacking the crispness of previous visits but they just reopened. For Patsy Grimaldi, I'm willing to give them the benefit of doubt.Trust me, go have a pie or two. You won't regret it.",5.0
This place was one of my favorites during a recent trip to New York. The pizza was super authentic (I spent 5 months in Italy so I'm pretty picky about my pizza). The service was great and we were seated quickly. The location is amazing as well. After dinner you can walk down the street and gaze at the skyline (how romantic! haha). This place is a must if you're in Brooklyn. Don't pass it up.,4.0
"We had planned to check out smorgusburg but it had suddenly moved :(I had read some reviews that recommended Juliana's over Grimaldi's. We only tried Juliana's so I can't compare the too. We liked Julianna's but weren't blown away by it. I felt like the menu was very limiting..and nothing that we were super excited about. We went with No. 4-Tomato, mozzarella, arugula and prosciutto. The arugula and prosciutto are added after the pizza is cooked. The prosciutto was is pretty large chunks and quickly over powered anything else.

Truly a one of a kind pizza place. Highly recommend it. Pizza was all around very good. I prefer a little more cheese but the amount the put was adequate. The pizza crust was baked just right.,4.0
"Juliana's is a must when you're exploring Dumbo and Brooklyn Bridge Park.   There're many positives about the newer pizza joint in this historic location.  For one, it's a beautiful space, I love the comfortable and spacious seating arrangement which includes a bar that can score you a birdseye view of your your pizza being assembled and cooked in the oven, which is quite entertaining.It's also a shorter wait as opposed to the line for Grimaldi's.  Every time  I've been here, the line always seem to be half the size of the one for the neighboring Grimaldi's.  Which is great if your're starving!The staff is always friendly and upbeat, which is always appreciated,  especially when catering to a touristy crowd.And the pizza itself is Good, buttery crust on the drier side.  Fresh Ingridents.  The pizza always looks gourmetish to me, just the way I like it.Everything is almost impeccable about Juliana's, except if you're a vegetarian or a vegan or a person who's in any way strick about the way  your food is prepared, I would be cautious about dining here.  As I've observed that the preparation of the pizza is done in a way where it's easy for the person making your pizza to have handled meats from previous orders.  It's quite possible that your veggie pizza was made by the same guy that  just assembled the meatlover's special that the couple is enjoying next to you.  Not a big deal to most people, but some customers might be particular about this.Juliana's is definitely a place to try while in Brooklyn, but at the same time, some folks should be cautious.",4.0
"Features:-If you don't know about the story behind this place and the owner (Patsy), you should read about it on Wikipedia.  It is quite interesting.  -We had the Margherita pizza with prosciutto.  It had tomato, mozzarella, and basil.  The mozarella cheese was enticing, it melted so quickly in my mouth.  The mozarella with tomato sauce made the pizza taste so distinctive and tasteful.Improvements:-The pizza we had was a bit too salty (probably from the prosciutto) but overrall, probably one of best pizzas I've had in NY thus far.-Long line like Grimaldi's but this restaurant moved its customers quicker.-Service was a bit slow probably because there were so many customers.Tips:-Do not come hungry. -Get a pizza with mozzarella cheese! Yum!",5.0
"Suuuuuper cute spot, love the music choice, and super friendly staff! Oh, and I can't forget the PIZZA!!!! I fell in love! My first slice of pizza in NY, but I think this is all I need! You need to stop here!!!amazing!!!",5.0
"I stumbled upon this place after eating at Grimaldi's one day. Standing there reading about the history of Patsy Grimaldi, I was shocked to find out Juliana's was owned and operated by the original owner. This was when I was approaced by an older man with a pleasant and warm welcome asking if I'd like to come inside and try his pie. I was disappointed, being on the west coast has deprived me of good pizza and when I do come back to visit I jump at any chance to visit a place with REAL NY coal oven PIE. I told him I wished I had visited his restaurant first. He inquired and asked where I was visiting and if my experience was good next door. I told him it was good, but not as good as it used to be. ""That's good, that's good. I'm glad you had a good dinner. When do you leave? You can still come back and try mine if you have time.""A man who could've jumped and talked shit about my experience, didn't. In true OG italian Don fashion, you let your work speak for itself. For that, you've earned my money. I came back the next day and ordered the usual- pepperoni, sausage, mushroom, basil, and garlic. PHENOMENAL. I'm glad you came out of retirement, sir.",4.0
We waited about 10 minutes to go in. It's very small inside and it feels crowded but it was not uncomfortable. We order a margarita pizza and added pepperoni and ham. It was delicious all the ingredients were so fresh and so perfectly blended together. I definitely recommend it. The price is average they also have soups and salad but I didn't try anything but the pizza.,5.0
Pretty good. Terrible service.Woman at the front checked Facebook on her phone while I asked a couple questions and while she answered... So. Not a great experience.,4.0
"The Patsy Grimaldi story is a complex saga of pizza love, loyalty and betrayal.And really amazing pizza.Long story short: Patsy Grimaldi sold Grimaldi's on 19 Old Fulton street to Frank Ciolli in 1998. Frank Ciolli began opening Grimaldi chains in 2003. From 2003 to 2005, the Ciolli and Grimaldi's relationship soured, the business relations ended. In 2005, a rent dispute between Frank Ciolli and his landlord led to Ciolli's eviction. Which lent Patsy Grimaldi the opportunity to make pizzas again.Regardless of the pizza drama, the coal fueled brick oven has remained. And the space remodeled to black tables and silver chairs. Feels less claustrophobic compared to their 2008 classic pizza joint seating. And the food? And the cheese is fresh and the sauce is sweet without being cloying. The charred crust is lacking the crispness of previous visits but they just reopened. For Patsy Grimaldi, I'm willing to give them the benefit of doubt.Trust me, go have a pie or two. You won't regret it.",5.0
This place was one of my favorites during a recent trip to New York. The pizza was super authentic (I spent 5 months in Italy so I'm pretty picky about my pizza). The service was great and we were seated quickly. The location is amazing as well. After dinner you can walk down the street and gaze at the skyline (how romantic! haha). This place is a must if you're in Brooklyn. Don't pass it up.,4.0
"We had planned to check out smorgusburg but it had suddenly moved :(I had read some reviews that recommended Juliana's over Grimaldi's. We only tried Juliana's so I can't compare the too. We liked Julianna's but weren't blown away by it. I felt like the menu was very limiting..and nothing that we were super excited about. We went with No. 4-Tomato, mozzarella, arugula and prosciutto. The arugula and prosciutto are added after the pizza is cooked. The prosciutto was is pretty large chunks and quickly over powered anything else. It was good pizza but if I was back in New York it wouldn't be my first choice ..that would be Starita by Don Antonio.",4.0

"What did they put in that sauce?!  My sister and I had ordered a pizza with no cheese, arugula, and artichoke -- we went vegan that night. We came here on a Sunday, where the line looked rather discouraging.  I had asked the lady at the front desk how long the wait is: 30 minutes to dine in, 2 hours to get a pizza to go.  Of course, we decided to wait the 30 minutes.  What I love about my meal is that it tasted fresh and homemade.  There was just a perfect balance with what my sister and I had ordered.  Also, note that the pizza is quite large -- my sister and I couldn't finish a ""small"" pizza.  On top of that, the service was great so I have no complaints there. I'd definitely make a trip out there if I was ever in town again!",5.0
"I can't really say anything that hasn't already been said, but it want to throw my support behind this place anyway. Very good pizza all around! Sauce was excellent flavor and texture, and the crust was perfectly crispy and just a little bit charred on the outside. Toward the center of the pizza was not as crispy, thus allowing for folding. We got margherita with pepperoni, which I definitely recommend, especially for trying out how a place does pizza without any gimmicks.Definitely check out Juliana's",5.0
"It was interesting reading about Juliana's long history as a new york pizza place. . .well the owners (they had a different name, sold that, it became a chain, they started a new place).This coal fired pizza place was amazing.  My biggest comparison is normally to Frank Pepe out of New Haven.  Juliana's matched frank and surpassed in many ways.  I would only signal out Pepe if you really had to do the white clam pizza. . .the toppings and quality of Juliana's exceeded Frank's in every way.The place is fairly nice size, and within spitting distance of the Ferry from Manhattan.  It can get busy, but we found a table very quickly.  We also got a egg cream while in Brooklyn (felt we had to) and it was tasty, but my wife's beer was a better fit for the pizza.",5.0
Absolutely the best pizza I've ever had. The service was great and they were very family friendly. The place next door tried to make our party of 10 keep my niece's stroller outside and they were rude. We opted to go to Juliana's and I will be eating there every time I go to Brooklyn.,5.0

The meat, though, was sub par and tasted a bit too much like pet food smells. That may be just me. But those at the table seemed to agree. I add quickly that it was , to be sure , not pet food.

So one recent evening I bought two pies, one from Juliana's and the other from Grimaldi's and brought them home( I live only 10 minutes away). Our family of eight all bit into both and unanimously we all said pretty much the same thing. They both essentially tasted the same but Juliana's just seemed to have everything cooked and mixed just right, it literally melted deliciously in our mouths. What was really noticeable was the bread, Juliana's was soft and chewy and tasted just right. Grimaldi's bread was harder and just tasted like plain old bread, it almost felt that it just got in the way of the taste of the pizza. All I can say is that Juliana's really tasted like the original( As Patsy himself would tell you) and it just seemed like more effort was put into making it just right, while Grimaldi's tasted like a pretty good Knock off. So basically Grimaldi's has the name, since they paid for it after buying it from Patsy a while back, but without a doubt Juliana's has the pizza! I guess it's up to you what is more important.",5.0

We started with the salad and then we split a small pizza...  And by small I mean it was 16 inches :) The sauce was fresh. A little sweet and tangy, topped with creamy and delicious mozzarella. I would definitely go back.",5.0
"No. 1.  'Nuff said.But really, the combination of toppings on this signature pie was absolutely ridiculous.  The freshest of housemade mozzarella, chew of the Scamorza affumicata curd cheese and salty savory umami-ness of the pancetta elevated each bite to a whole 'nother level.Being a newer sister joint to the infamous Grimaldi's, I'd take Juliana's over them any day.  A more expansive menu, less of a wait, more comfortable seating, a more modern atmosphere and excellent service from start to finish.So derricious and a must visit for any and all pizza lovers living in/visiting Brooklyn.",5.0
"I set out in hope of finding the best pizza and I found it at Juliana's!  Many say it's well worth the wait, but that falls short of describing this level of quality.  I waited around an hour for my opportunity to get seated at a table and I would be willing to wait two hours in line for that amazing pizza.  I spilt a Margherita Pizza with prosciutto with my wife and it was plenty enough for us both.  Great service, atmosphere with amazing pizza.  Only place for pizza worth a wait.",5.0
Simply some of the best pizza I've ever had. Sad that I never got to see grimaldi's before all this fued b.s. but the pizza is still top notch.Also had a really great local Brooklyn beer called war flag. A honey-pilsner if I remember correctly.Service and ambiance were fine but the pizza is the reason I'm giving Juliana's 5 stars.,5.0
"So we showed up a couple of minutes after three in the afternoon. That's when they restoke the coal oven to keep the heat up and maintain crispy pizzas crust. So while we waited about 30 minutes for the oven to heat up we got a Caesar salad and put our pizza order so it would be one of the first ones out.We actually got the first pizza to come out.,We got a margherita pizza with prosciutto. It was worth the wait, when it got to our table, steam was rising from it. Everything about it was absolutely amazing. I could eat here everyday, and be happy. It is one of the best, if not the best, pizzas I've ever eaten in NYC.Make sure you leave room for dessert. Brownie + Cookie = Brookie. The Brookie Bridge is out of this world, one of the best things I've ever eaten.  It's two brookies with ice cream between it, like an ice cream sandwich. The service was also very friendly, and never let your glass get empty. My only regret is that I don't live nearby.",5.0
From a native New Yorker- this was the best pizza I've ever had! Waited 45 minutes to get a seat and it was entirely worth it. We got the #1 on the special pizzas and a cheesecake and cannoli- all amazing! The pizza crust is delicious. Excited to come back and try different pizzas here.,5.0

Juliana's) with the original Grimaldi's coal-fried oven in the original Grimaldi's spot.  The last time I went, I skipped the Grimaldi's line, walked into Juliana's, and got seated right away.  Nuts!  I think the only way this insanity can possibly be justified is if you didn't want to pay the 10-15% price premium that Juliana's is commanding over the Grimaldi's pizza factory.  PS You know New Yorkers are getting spoiled by amazing pizza when I can't bring myself to give a shop like Juliana's five Yelp stars.",4.0

"This is the BEST pizza experience I'VE EVER HAD! New York is good at so many things food. So many styles, so many techniques, so many trends, blah, blah, blah.

"I am sorry, but I don't get all the hype.    We ordered their #3 (sausage, broccoli rabe, ...).   It was fine, but it wasn't anything great.    We also had a spinach salad, which was also just fine fine; nothing special.  I liked the IPA they had on tap, but the pizza was just A-OK and the salad was a meh.Also, of disappointment was that we said we wanted to add mushrooms to the #3.   They said NO --- you can't add any toppings to our specialty pizzas.   This is ridiculous especially when they offer it as a topping on build your own pizzas..    Even more ridiculous is the following:  the table next to us was custom building a pizza (choosing all their own toppings), and she said they wanted spinach as a topping; the customers were told that they don't have a spinach topping, at which point the customer pointed to our table and said ""they have a huge spinach salad in front of them; was that the last of the spinach?""  To which the waiter responded:  ""All of the spinach we have is for salads only.""These people are ridiculous.  They have mushrooms, but you can only put it on a pizza built from scratch; you can't add it to one of their specialty pizzas even if you are willing to pay for it.   They have spinach, but you can't get that on any pizza even if you are willing to pay for it.      After a 20-25 minute wait for us to be seated, and just A-OK pizza, this is dropping them from what would have been 3 stars to 2 stars due to the lack of flexibility by the restaurant with respect to toppings.",2.0
"Delicious pizza! The crowd wasn't great because we had a 45 minute wait and a busy server, but the food was very good. The staff was nice, and the menu had many options. It's wood fired, so they only sell pies which can get pricey with toppings but it is worth it. Yum!",5.0

"Best pizza I've had since Kim Jong-Un took over North Korea! One large pizza is enough for a party of 2, price is very reasonable, urging on the cheaper side for the quality and quantity even. Toppings to go for are the meatballs and pepperoni, essentially any meat offered as a topping.",5.0

Be sure to drop by and say hi to Patsy Grimaldi and have some fresh, delicious, coal fired pizza  after your stroll through DUMBO!",4.0
Why isn't this place 6 stars? One of my favorite pizza places in NY. Definitely worth the walk across Brooklyn Bridge from Manhattan! :),5.0
Whenever we go to Brooklyn bridge park we eat here. The pizza is the best! It's always crowded and seating is cramped but the pizza makes up for it all. Quick brick oven pizza keeps coming in all varieties. The smoked salmon is especially good.,5.0
"I am sorry, but I don't get all the hype.    We ordered their #3 (sausage, broccoli rabe, ...).   It was fine, but it wasn't anything great.    We also had a spinach salad, which was also just fine fine; nothing special.  I liked the IPA they had on tap, but the pizza was just A-OK and the salad was a meh.Also, of disappointment was that we said we wanted to add mushrooms to the #3.   They said NO --- you can't add any toppings to our specialty pizzas.   This is ridiculous especially when they offer it as a topping on build your own pizzas..    Even more ridiculous is the following:  the table next to us was custom building a pizza (choosing all their own toppings), and she said they wanted spinach as a topping; the customers were told that they don't have a spinach topping, at which point the customer pointed to our table and said ""they have a huge spinach salad in front of them; was that the last of the spinach?""  To which the waiter responded:  ""All of the spinach we have is for salads only.""These people are ridiculous.  They have mushrooms, but you can only put it on a pizza built from scratch; you can't add it to one of their specialty pizzas even if you are willing to pay for it.   They have spinach, but you can't get that on any pizza even if you are willing to pay for it.      After a 20-25 minute wait for us to be seated, and just A-OK pizza, this is dropping them from what would have been 3 stars to 2 stars due to the lack of flexibility by the restaurant with respect to toppings.",2.0
"Delicious pizza! The crowd wasn't great because we had a 45 minute wait and a busy server, but the food was very good. The staff was nice, and the menu had many options. It's wood fired, so they only sell pies which can get pricey with toppings but it is worth it. Yum!",5.0
The best pizza we had in NY!! It was our first trip so we had a few different spots this was by far the best!,5.0
"Amazing, both the food and the service. Be prepared to wait. We tried the homemade meatballs that were very tasty. The pizza had incredibly fresh and very yummy ingredients. A definite must try if you are anywhere near the area.",5.0
Myself and two buddies were on vacation from LA and heard amazing things about this place. The food surpassed every expectation. The service was incredible and the ambiance was charming. Definitely a must have next time I'm in NYC.,5.0
"Best pizza I've had since Kim Jong-Un took over North Korea! One large pizza is enough for a party of 2, price is very reasonable, urging on the cheaper side for the quality and quantity even. Toppings to go for are the meatballs and pepperoni, essentially any meat offered as a topping.",5.0
"Dumbo. You have to order an entire Pizza, but totally worth it. I sat in front of the pizza oven alone and traded slices with the nice people sitting next too me. Very good and easier to get a seat than Grimaldis.",4.0
"Ok who visits New York and not eat Pizza? i don't care if you are in a strict diet, eating pizza in New York is a must! and having from one of the most famous places even BETTER! I ate 2 different kinds and needed to walk for 2 days to burn the calories that were totally worthy!!!!!",5.0
"In a nutshell: Pizza made by Patsy Grimaldi and his ovens right next door to Grimaldi's.I actually learned some history behind Juliana's before coming here. Apparently Patsy Grimaldi sold the name of Grimaldi's and the corner location, then opened up another place next door, bringing his ovens with him. Genius. Go to Juliana's for the best Brooklyn pizza experience. Juliana's is located in DUMBO nearby the Brooklyn Ice Cream factory.ParkingTake a train and walk here. Or take a bus...honestly.Service 5/5We were served by Patsy's daughter (or granddaughter....we think. She looked young), and she did an amazing job serving our group. One of my cousins spilled his drink all over the table and floor and she was super patient and cleaned it up without any hesitation. Patsy came by our table a couple times to see how our meal was, and even took a picture with us!  Everyone was really nice there from the owner to the bus staff.Ambience 5/5Very nice. The interior has a fine dining look to it, but is very welcoming for groups/families, or intimate nights out. The restaurant can be quiet and energetic, and having a view of the kitchen and ovens adds to the total experience. Patsy eats his own pizza in the corner, and the staff are always making rounds catering to all the customers. We even grabbed the sight of Patsy preparing the dough himself!Wait time 5/5Pizza comes out very promptly, so no complaints here.Food 5/5Here's what we got:Special Pizza #1 - A+ yelp.com/biz_photos/juli…This is essentially a white slice, but better!! Truffle oil is used in the place of olive oil to give that distinctive flavor. Every bite was packed with flavor, but didn't sit too heavy since it didn't have tomato and wasn't overloaded with toppings.Margherita Pizza with Sausage and Sweet Onion - A+ yelp.com/biz_photos/juli…So we needed more meat in our lives. Sausage and sweet onion complimented this pizza very well, and the tomato sauce was light and tasty. Also, the fresh basil was bomb!!Overall 5/5This is some of the best tasting pizzas I've ever had.

I have found a new place to bring my out-of-town visitors to for NY-style pizza.After being rudely treated at Grimaldi's, I decided to check-out Juliana's next door. I feel like Grimaldi's has been dependent on their reputation this whole time, and the quality of their service has diminished. After trying Juliana's, I realized that the pizza is not too oily, and you don't develop an unbearable thirst afterwards (like the kind you get after eating cheap Chinese take-out).

The small pizza is 16"" which is big for a small (the menu didn't clarify how big the sizes were, large is 18"").I ordered a coke with my meal. I wished the server had told me that it would come in a tiny 8oz glass bottle (for $3). I prefer my coke with ice from a fountain so was disappointed. And 8oz is just a tease! Also, I wanted ranch or something creamy to dip my crust in. They didn't have it.Our service left much to be desired. We were the second table to arrive for lunch, so can't blame it on being busy.

They moved people in quickly and the staff was very friendly.  Our waiter was great and we ordered a pizza based on something we saw someone else order.   When the pizza arrived, it looked good but it was undercooked.  No big deal, it wasn't raw or anything, just not the crispy thin crust pizza I was expecting with a nuclear hot coal fired oven.Late in our stay, I bumped into Patsy who asked ""how was your pizza"" and I figured I'd tell him.  ""it was ok, but I can make the same pizza at home with a 500 degree oven.  I'll try you again, but it wasn't special""What he said will make me come back. He said ""Why didn't you send it back?!  We want you to be happy""I realize that they're cooking by eye and they took my pizza out a minute early, that's all.   He also gave me a tip, that you can request a ""well done"" pizza if you like more crisp and burnt edges""Next time I'm in Brooklyn, I will try it again. Any owner who encourages a customer to send the food back because it isn't up to his standards is an o.k. guy.Looking forward to the next time, thanks Patsy.A",4.0
"Anyone who knows Brooklyn knows Juliana's is the real Grimaldi's. I would not go so far to say that this is ~ThE bEsT~ pizza ever, since that title is still up in the air for me, but it's pretty damn good. Also this place has gotten way touristy, but then again, what great eateries in NYC haven't? Stop by on a WEEK night, and if you're lucky, snag a seat at the pizza ""bar"" towards the back where you can sit and watch dough literally being launched through the air, and toppings strategically scattered on your pie. I saw my specific pie being made and it was pretty cool. I timed mine in the oven: 5 minutes. Seriously. I think maybe even 4.Only downfall is I felt service was a bit pushy and rushed. Got asked 3 times if I was ready to order, before I was actually ready. (I'm extremely indecisive.) And our waitress was pretty cold. Pizza was hot though, so, oh well.",4.0
"This place is the perfect recipe for perfection. A cute, clean, small place with simple decor. A huge brick oven, friendly staff, delicious pizza and delicious dessert. The atmosphere is very cozy and inviting. We ordered the famous Margherita pizza with added peperoni and mushrooms (no additional charge for toppings here). The pizza was definitely like nothing I have ever tasted and the best I have ever had. It was so fresh that I could taste each and every ingredient from the sauce to the toppings. The crust was fresh and buttery with just the right amount of crunchiness. SO GOOD. After dinner I ordered the Brookie with two scoops of raspberry chocolate ice cream. DELICIOUS. I highly recommend this place.",5.0
"I came here on a busy Friday evening, with a long line out the door, but surprisingly only waited for about 10 minutes. The trick is to NOT come in a large group, probably worst idea ever. I watched a group of 6 in front of me wait nearly an hour AFTER I had ordered and STILL were all split up in twos when they were finally seated.Despite the countless claims, I cannot agree that Juliana's pizza is the best, or remotely close to the best. It was certainly a great dining experience however, I've had much better. Firstly, I guess you can say my expectation were a little high, but the traditional red sauce that came on the margarita pizza was rather bland, pizza was a bit soggy and wait time was a little ridiculous. I think I waited over half an hour for my pie after ordering.The staff is incredibly friendly and able to maintain their composure quite well under the evening rush stress. For the service alone, I would recommend giving this place a try and may consider revisiting if I'm ever in town again. Maybe I just got a bad batch of sauce :P.",3.0
"Wow, all those wasted years of going to Grimaldis! I have found a new place to bring my out-of-town visitors to for NY-style pizza.After being rudely treated at Grimaldi's, I decided to check-out Juliana's next door. I feel like Grimaldi's has been dependent on their reputation this whole time, and the quality of their service has diminished. After trying Juliana's, I realized that the pizza is not too oily, and you don't develop an unbearable thirst afterwards (like the kind you get after eating cheap Chinese take-out). The restaurant space is much smaller than at Grimaldi's, but the wait was not as bad as Grimaldi's. From now on, I'm going to Juliana's!",5.0
"Wish I could could give this more stars but the staff across the board was so unwelcoming and unfriendly I wished we'd turned around and went to their sister store next door. The pizza was good (my husband LOVED it), I wished it had more cheese on it. If you are a cheese lover, get extra. The small pizza is 16"" which is big for a small (the menu didn't clarify how big the sizes were, large is 18"").I ordered a coke with my meal. I wished the server had told me that it would come in a tiny 8oz glass bottle (for $3). I prefer my coke with ice from a fountain so was disappointed. And 8oz is just a tease! Also, I wanted ranch or something creamy to dip my crust in. They didn't have it.Our service left much to be desired. We were the second table to arrive for lunch, so can't blame it on being busy. We never got water refilled or were asked if everything was ok. Unacceptable.I live in VA, so won't be back anyway. With so many choices in NYC, this place needs to step up their game.",3.0
"When you don't like what someone has done to your brand, you take it over.  That's what the original owner of Grimaldi's did.  Grimaldi's was loosing their touch, and Patsy Grimaldi took it over and renamed the restaurant after his mother.  What a relief to remodel the old Grimaldi's because it desperately needed it.  I didn't have a problem with the old Grimaldi's pizzza, but you cant argue with Patsy's ingenuity.  And was he ever right, the new pizza at Juliana is amazing.  Unfortunately you still have to wait on a long line, so I suggest going a little before opening time to secure a seat.",5.0
"DELICIOUS! We stopped in on our eating tour yesterday and decided to try out based on a recommendation from my friends brother. Thank goodness we did! What a delicious treat it was. We ordered a small to share since we still had plenty of eating to do in our day. We got a margarita pizza and added meatballs. So yummy! Everyone around us had a pizza with lox on it that looked delicious. I definitely want to come back and try out more pizzas and a salad.Service was friendly and efficient, especially given how busy they were! We were seated immediately upon walking in but then five minutes later there was a wait. It seemed to be the theme of our day!",5.0
"Service was great, pizza was underwhelming. It was not New York pizza, very much a fine dining attempt at pizza. The crust somehow undercooked and burnt at the same time. The sauce while fresh, was not the gravy consistency I was after, more like salsa. Now it wasn't bad bad, but I would rather have a more traditional pizza.",1.0
"This is the real Grimaldi... Don't be deceived by the longer line next door. That's a tourist trap. Seriously, Come to Juliana's for an incredibly delicious pizza and great customer service. They are very fast yet their quality is the best.I tried the margherita and the white w/ added ricotta.

"Last year, I was walking around Brooklyn with someone when a man decided to help us lost kids. He had lived in the area for many years so he knew everything we needed to know. He had told us about the history of this restaurant and that's when my company and I decided to eat here. We had to wait a bit as there was a line. We sat down looked at the menu and decided to order a large Half and Half of Margherita and white pizza. The waiter warned us how big large was for two people, but his doubt on how much we can eat made us want the large even more. The pizza took most of the space on our small table. Then as I took a bite on a slice it was so fresh with the right amount of sauce and cheese. They did thin crust well. The crust was crisp just right. Anyways, forget the pizza place next door,  this is where you should stop by. Also,  we finished that large pizza. We were full but we enjoyed each bite.",5.0

"#1 Pizza spot in America voted on by Trip Advisor and I live a few subway stops away? of course I am going to try it! Walking towards Juliana's we saw a long line outside, we were a little disappointed because we love to go out to eat during the week when most people are at work, but low and behold, the line of people waiting was for Grimaldi's, NOT Juliana's! We were seated immediately and asked the waiter for a suggestion. Main seller is the Margherita Pizza with toppings. We went with Margherita with pepperoni and sausage. The pizza is definitely great..was it the best all around pizza Ive ever tasted? no. The ingredients were perhaps the freshest I have ever had..someone tell me where they get their mozzarella because I'd love to have it in my fridge. With all the pizza spots in New york/Brooklyn you really have to make an impression on someone to have them come back to your place, and I would definitely go back. Its a good family dinner spot. My only real disappointment is those damn little glass bottles of diet coke/coke! I hate when restaurants charge so much money for a sip of soda. It's a pizza place, where's the fountain coke?! Overall, great spot.",4.0
"If I could give 10 stars I would. The pizza is always absolutely delicious!!  The best pizza in Brooklyn. Will you wait over an hour to get in? Yes, but not always. There were times I only waited 15-30 minutes. Once you dig your teeth into their pizza, you will forget the long wait time. Once you take a bite of this pizza it will be hard to eat any other pizza. Lucali's and Grimaldi's are good too, but they are not as good as Juliana's.  This is the real Grimaldi's anyway.",5.0

"Absolutely delicious! My friend and I were apprehensive about the long line during Sunday lunch hours, but we waited only about 10 minutes.

The restaurant is tastefully decorated, air conditioned, and has relatively quick service. I'd come back hands down over Grimaldi's next door.",5.0
Is this the best pizza in the nation? I don't know. I haven't eaten at all the pizza joints in the nation. Some part of me feels like there is some hole in the wall pizza place in some unknown American town that is probably better but maybe not by much. 4 stars because they hadn't figured out how to manage the flood of people coming after they were named best pizza by CNN. We had to wait a few hours for them to go get more stuff to cook with. When we finally got our pizzas...they were really really good and really large. Pep+blk olives and mushrooms. It was interesting to watch the pizza owner next door stand on his front porch and scowl at the line. Apparently there has been a long standing debate about who's pizza is better. Looks like CNN made that decision. Out of pure principal we ate more than we should have and rolled our way back to Manhattan. Gave the doggy bag to a man on the street. Hope he liked it as much as we did.,4.0
Here is the first pizza place that I had in NYC ! Cross the Brooklyn bridge we kind of hungry so we found this place .. The place is not too big but it's cute and simple ! When we decided to had a dinner here we get the great service .. We want order two different pizza but when we saw the pizza size .. We know that we can not order two .. Cuz we only have two people .. Small size already let us full .. We can not have anymore pizza after our small size pizza !! Inside the restaurant was clean .. The service super ! Merci  ! The magherita pizza was amazing !!!!! Next time when we travel here we will come again !,5.0

WOWWW. I was curious to try this place and I'm so glad I did!

"Don't get me wrong. It was good, but unfortunately not what I would consider pizza purely based on how it was constructed. Juliana's pizza starts with sliced mozzarella, followed by drizzled tomato sauce and sprinkled toppings. Tomato sauce should never be drizzled on a pizza, it should be spread. Drizzling leaves a very unfortunate situation in which some bites into the pizza either do not contain sauce or cheese or both. And the four wilted leaves of basil on my large Margherita pizza did nothing to alleviate my despair regarding the drizzling. Yes, adorable restaurant, flavorful, but not my kind of pizza.",3.0

"There's not much to say except that this is *really* good pizza.

One small pizza would be enough to feed 2-3 people assuming each eats about 3 slices.  Have to say I liked the white pizza more because I'm a cheese person. The margarita pizza was not bad but nothing spectacular for me.  Just like corner store pizza with fresher ingredients and sturdier crust with less oiliness. Except much more expensive.  And a bit stingy with the toppings.. I thought the crust/bottom skin was on the little bit too hard for my tastes but depends on your preference. Overall can't say the food was bad. It was decent, but if I had to pay with my own money to go here, then I wouldn't come here. If someone else (like my manager!

Juliana's was everything I expected from NY pizza. We ordered to go and ate on the pier just a few feet from the restaurant. I was expecting a delicious pizza based on these Yelp reviews and was not disappointed. We ordered a margharita with sausage and it was superb.

The staff was warm, friendly and inviting. And so was the manager who even took the time to make sure we were happy with our pizza and even made the effort to make small talk.

"I thought I knew about pizza - at least, what New York pizza means. I assert that pizza as Americans know it was developed in New York, and a hot fresh slice from Joe's at 3am was as good as it got.It was because of this that I never really took much interest in the gourmet pizza shops, the ones touting coal fired brick ovens and the like. After having lived in Washington DC for four years, I was tired of ""pizza"" being passed off as ""pizza."" These pies married the shortcomings of the italian breed (uselessly thin and soggy crusts requiring a knife and fork) with those of the American breed (fatty, oily cheeses and toppings on tasteless cardboard), and tried to pass it off as something edible. One was better off ordering from Papa John's than going to one of those places.Enter Juliana's. Well, stand in line outside the door for half an hour, and then enter Juliana's. For the first time, a pizza combines the best parts of the Italian and American, while leaving most of the downsides of each behind. A flavorful, thin crust, that aside from the very tip of the slice, held its structural integrity when folded. Hearty toppings that were neither too salty nor too oily. Fresh, stretchy mozzarella, not dried and shredded, that was spread evenly over the pizza, not sliced and melted into place. Sauce that tasted like tomato, not tomato paste.Three slices into a small pie, and I look at my plate, noticing three drops of oil had escaped from the slices folded in my hand. If this had been a typical chain pizzeria or even a good slice joint, the amount of oil on my plate would have made the BP spill pale in comparison. And then it dawned on me - that was the difference. I had the texture of the crust, the flavor of the sauce, and the mouthfeel of the cheese, without the heaviness of the oil and the salt. Not only was the pizza delicious, but to get the flavor and the texture without the aftereffects was a revelation. Dare I say it was transcendent.Late night drunk food, or the occasional snack? I'll swing by Joe's. A meal? I'll stand outside Juliana's every time.P.S. A small pie is good for two people, and if you're hungry enough you might have room for dessert.

Lines got realllly long after I got out of the restaurant around 8pm!!Service was excellent they were attentive and so friendly. The pizza took a while to come out so they gave us anchovy caesar salad on the house! You even saw the owner, Patsy going around with a giant bowl of salad and serving everyone. Patsy was so nice! He went to every table to make sure everything was good as well as seeing where everyone came from.Lastly..the pizza!!! We made our own with pepperoni and mushrooms on a margherita pizza and it was a m a z I n g.

"This pizza place, which happens to be owned by the real Grimaldi, is next door to Grimaldi's, another pizza place with gaggles of tourists in line outside. Thank goodness I had a real New Yorker guide me to the pizza in NYC: Juliana's.At 4:30 PM on a holiday, we had to wait about 20 minutes in a short line in the sun (the not-so-fun part). The man himself was out front, pointing people to tables and chatting customers up. We got a great table right near the pizza-making action. Our waitress was nice and efficient.We order the prosciutto/arugula pizza and the margherita pizza. Our party of 4 cleaned the pizza pans. They were delicious. Cheesy, fresh, flavorful, a little char on the crust... my favorite was the margherita, for sure.Prices were reasonable - in fact, they were cheaper than a lot of other places (less than $30 a pie). The beverage selection was solid, too. I'd tell you to try this place over other pizza options, but then there might be too much of a line when I try to go back ;)",5.0

Nearly the most perfect mozzarella pizza outside of Italy. As a traveler to Rome about 3 times a year of the past 10 years I have to say that Juliana's Mozzarella pizza would stand up on it's own.  Now they just need to start delivering like they said they were going to doing last year...!,5.0

"Great pizza. Delicious toppings and a few beers really hit the spot. The funny thing about this place is that I'm sure a lot of people end up coming here because the line at Grimaldi's is too long, but this is great pizza in its own right and it's not much of a step down, if at all, coming here. I was with a group of four guys, we got three different pizzas and loved them all. Really, I don't think you can go wrong here.Great staff too.",4.0

Patsy, who we had been talking to for a few moments, said to just park the car in front of the restaurant in this little driveway area and that he would watch the car. What?! I'd like to think he did this because we had a little baby in the car, but honestly he was so kind and warm I'm sure he'd give this level of service no matter what. Love him. Pizza.

"Of the overly touristy, guide book infested pizzerias of the city. 1 Front Street Brooklyn was probably my favorite.

The tourists will still flock in droves to 1 Front Street  because all the guidebooks say so and by default if you don't know the history, people will cue up on command next door because it is 'shorter.'Competition is good and Juliana pushes out some pretty fantastic delicious pies. The crust crispy and doughy.

"Charming interior with a brick oven pizza, you could even sit by where they make the pizzas to watch! We had just walked across the Brooklyn Bridge and were definitely ready for lunch. We got the Margherita pizza and it was absolutely delicious. The thin crust was my favorite part, and the mozzarella and basil complemented the whole pie perfectly.

Pizza was fine. Typical NY style. My gripe is with the beverages. A tiny 8 oz. bottle of Coke for $2.50. My iced tea was $3 with no refills which I didn't know until I asked for one. I switched to water after that and the waiter made no attempt to refill it. Will not be back.,2.0
"Service is good, the root beer was great but I wished I was next door at the ""grimaldis"" restaurant.  It was really similar but for some reason i thought the restaurant named grimaldis has an overall better tasting pizza.  The crust is slightly thicker and has a sweetness to it.  Also, lucali's in Caroll garden is much better than this place. Overall, my experience was good but my rating is 3 stars because I wasn't overwhelmed by the taste of the pizza.",3.0
"Mr. Grimaldi was on duty during our visit a couple weeks ago. He greeted us out front, asked about out trip and brought us a complimentary espresso at the end of the meal. Always fun to meet the owner and even more so when he's charming and when there's a good story about his founding the place next door.The pizza was the real deal. We had to order a third large for our party of 6, since we were all gobbling what we had. Don't even remember what toppings we had: it was all good.

Awesome pizza place in Brooklyn and great location with beautiful views. Must go to pizza spot. And friendly staff too.,5.0
"In all my years of growing up and living in and around The City, I've driven the Brooklyn Bridge countless times. However, today was my first walk across the East River. Friends rave about walking the bridge, picking up a pie at Grimaldi's and eating it at the riverside park nearby. Despite the architecturally pleasing facade, Grimaldi's sure did strike me as a tourist trap, supported by the hour line out the door full of foreigners. And so I learned a little something today, but any further insight would be useful.There is this quaint place next door named Juliana's, and we thought to ourselves and shared the bet with one another that it would likely be quite good. And the shorter wait at Juliana's -- gosh why am I sharing this wisdom -- was full of fellow locals also at one time discouraged by the Grimaldi's delay. My neighbors provided us with knowledge about Juliana's history that I simply can't describe in writing. To make a long story short, Juliana's is in fact the original Grimaldi's, in its original location, owned by Patsy Grimaldi, also of Patsy's pizza, once connected to the owners of Lombardi's as well and somehow or another also linked to John's of Bleecker Street -- just a few of my favorites. Meanwhile, Grimaldi's next door was sold to a gentleman by the name of Mr. Ciolli and some sort of tension ensued between the two.Anyhow, Juliana's, I'm pretty sure is the original Grimaldi's and its fantastic. The Margherita pizza is topped iconically with fresh mozzarella and incredibly flavorful tomatoes. The crust is thin and crispy, though lighter than the Lombardi's/John's variety by way of its fluffiness under the hood, still sporting that coal oven dust on the bottom that I so love. So we took it to go and ate in the grass by the river and it was glorious. Couldn't ask for a better spring adventure in our tremendous city with a bit of scholarly enlightenment to boot. (NOTE: I'm confident that the pizza from ""Grimaldi's"" is very good as well, just offering some origin -- you can read more about it in the NY Times).",4.0
Amazing. One of the best pizza places in NYC hands down. Had the spinach salad which was absolutely delicious along with a margarita and sausage pizza. The brownie ice cream sandwich was also divine.,5.0

"And just when you think pizza couldn't get any better...it does!

I was blown away by Juliana's Pizza. Every part of the pizza offered a complimenting flavor. The crust was toasty yet malleable whereas Grimaldi's was doughy and powdery. What's the point of the oven if that's how you serve it?Juliana's cheese was scrumptious and alive with flavors whereas Grimaldis tasted like mozzarella alone. The sauce at Gromaldi's was watered down, at Juliana's it had a rich flavor.

It got busy very fast. We did end up waiting quite a bit for the pizza to arrive, we can see all the take-outs being made between dining orders. The service is quick to respond.

"Juliana's may seem like just an extension to snatch the runoff from Grimaldi's, but it's the real deal. The true Grimaldi's. The oven in the back has been there nearly a century. That kooky old guy who welcomed you in and is throwing pizza dough around the place is actually Patsy Grimaldi himself. Juliana was Patsy's mother; he sold Grimaldi's off many years ago, losing the right to use his own name on a pizzeria (he similarly lost the rights to Patsy's many years before in Harlem). These two restaurants have been bitter rivals ever since.You'll need to bring a group to split a pie, but once you do it's pretty damn economical at $2.50 a slice. The long line and reputation obviously speaks to its quality, I expected to shell out a lot more. Consider that you'd pay almost double for the same thing by the slice at most places.  HIGHLY recommend the calzone too, it's incredibly filling and comes overloaded with a combo of extremely high quality cheeses.

"3.5 stars...Juliana's is pizza royalty. Check below to see why. The space here is beautiful, really well laid out and designed. The service is impeccable, really quite impressive. This is fancy pizza, no slices and garlic knots here. They do have a menu beyond pizza but pizza dominates. Small pizzas are $16-24 while larges are $19-27. It's definitely one of the more expensive pizzas you'll find in the city. I personally didn't find it to be worth the price.I split a classic margherita. The very middle of the pizza was dry as a bone (no sauce, cheese, or oil). On the plus side the tomato sauce was fresh and vibrant and the mozerella was smooth and stretchy. It was evident that they use ultra fresh ingredients. They were a tad stingy on the basil and put it on a little too early but it wasn't too bad. Crust was crispy and not too thin or thick, it was a tad dry though. I was eyeballing other couples' pizzas and I think going with something with more toppings is the way to go here. It's surpising that I remember having a better pizza at the fake Grimaldi's then the real one. Let me explain:Around 1941 Patsy Grimaldi (nephew of Pasquale ""Patsy"" Lancieri, owner of Patsy's and apprentice to Gennaro Lombardi, originator of pizza in the US in 1905) trained under his uncle and learned Lombardi's secrets and later in 1990 opened Grimaldi's under the Brooklyn Bridge in Brooklyn. In 1998 he sold that business to Frank Ciolli. In 2012, Frank Ciolli was forced to move the ultra popular Grimaldi's next door due to rent disputes.

Also, if you're feeling adventurous, experimenting with toppings is not a bad idea for the pizza will always come out impeccable. Even on a Saturday at 6pm, I've never had to wait that long here, which is also awesome given how popular they are.

"If I could give this place 10 stars out of 5, I would.  This is the BEST margherita pizza I've ever had in my life!!  And I've had a lot of pizza.  The only downside is that sometimes there's a wait - actually I should say most of the time there is.  But one Friday, I came with my boyfriend a little before noon and there was NO line here (or at Grimaldi's next door), and the place was almost empty!!  It was amazing.The margherita pizza is just fabulous, every time we come here I can't get anything else because it's that good.  The tomatoes and basil are so fresh.   The mozzarella tastes like they made it themselves that morning.  And the dough is perfect - not too thick, not TOO thin.  So amazing.  After coming here, no other pizza place can even compare anymore!   Even though I don't live that close to Brooklyn, I will make the trek if I'm in the city because it's that worth it.By the way, when we left that day (12:30ish?), it was filling up, and Grimaldi's had a huge line out the door.  I wanted to tell the tourists to go next door... they have no idea what they're missing out on!",5.0

No matter what pie you order, I am certain you'll enjoy it. I ordered the furthest thing from pizza with a basil pizza, which had olive oil, basil, tomatoes, and a very light cheese. The flavors were perfectly combined to create an intensely satisfying slice with every bite. The staff was friendly and punctual, especially the man running the show himself. The place was well lit and clean. The location was perfect. Just don't go next door to Dumbo for a macaroon. They'll rip you off.",5.0

"I ordered about 3 take out Margherita pizza's yesterday for a picnic in Brooklyn Bridge Park. The pizzas were scrumptious! Just the right amount of cheese to tomato sauce ratio. 3 things I didn't like: It wasn't very hot, a tad too much char on the crusts and the pizza could have used some more basil. Next time I'd order to dine in the restaurant and ask for extra basil. It's worth coming back!",4.0
While waiting in line for Grimaldi's decided to see what my fellow Yelpers said about Juliana's and was pleasantly surprised. Since I've been to Grimaldi's decided to check out Juliana's and I'm really glad I did. The staff and decor makes for a great setting to enjoy pizza! Decided on the traditional pie and did half fennel sausage as well. The sauce is so great and overall was impressed! As a person that loves pizza and has been to most of the best pizza places in the city I definitely would put this up there on my list! Enjoy!,4.0
"The Pizza is as good as everyone says! We ordered several pies 'to go' for a group - traditional margarita, one with sausage and pepperoni, and the white pizza with sausage and broccoli rabe. The sausage and broccoli rabe was most people's least favorite. I guess when you think of pizza you usually want that red sauce on it! There wasn't a lot of flavor on this one otherwise. Thanks for the head's up about the wax bags instead of boxes fellow yelper! The pizza made it to our destination ok, but not the most convenient way to carry 4 pies! Definitely give yourself time - I called ahead and my pies were ready 55 minutes later (or 10 minutes longer then they said).",5.0
"Love Grimaldi's but didn't want to stand in that damned long line! Luckily his daughter built a place right next door and the pizza there is just the same - but without the damned long line!  It is expensive: 3 pizzas, 2 beers, and 1 soda cost us $100. But we had plenty to bring back to our hotel for late night snacking! They even packed our pizza to it would fit in the hotel refrigerator. They DO NOT OFFER A GLUTEN-FREE OPTION so only got four stars.",4.0
"Love the pizza. Coal oven. Never ever ever take this to go.I can't believe some idiot did that. This is not a pizza parlor where you get a slice to go. You go for the experience and the gourmet pizza. One tiny bit of criticism, the arugula pie looked like the guys in the back got a pre packaged arugula salad and popped it over the pizza.

"I counted the seats inside and out. I think capacity is 70. So at any given time, there are 70 people in pizza heaven and another 35 non-sinners in line. No matter what pie you order, I am certain you'll enjoy it. I ordered the furthest thing from pizza with a basil pizza, which had olive oil, basil, tomatoes, and a very light cheese. The flavors were perfectly combined to create an intensely satisfying slice with every bite. The staff was friendly and punctual, especially the man running the show himself. The place was well lit and clean. The location was perfect. Just don't go next door to Dumbo for a macaroon. They'll rip you off.",5.0
"The history of this restaurant is just as good as the pizza it serves. Speaking of pizza, it was delicious. My wife and I had the margherita pizza which was phenomenal. The sauce had just the right amount of sweetness, and the dough was cooked to perfection. Good NY pizza, plain and simple.",5.0
"I ordered about 3 take out Margherita pizza's yesterday for a picnic in Brooklyn Bridge Park. The pizzas were scrumptious! Just the right amount of cheese to tomato sauce ratio. 3 things I didn't like: It wasn't very hot, a tad too much char on the crusts and the pizza could have used some more basil. Next time I'd order to dine in the restaurant and ask for extra basil. It's worth coming back!",4.0
While waiting in line for Grimaldi's decided to see what my fellow Yelpers said about Juliana's and was pleasantly surprised. Since I've been to Grimaldi's decided to check out Juliana's and I'm really glad I did. The staff and decor makes for a great setting to enjoy pizza! Decided on the traditional pie and did half fennel sausage as well. The sauce is so great and overall was impressed! As a person that loves pizza and has been to most of the best pizza places in the city I definitely would put this up there on my list! Enjoy!,4.0
"The Pizza is as good as everyone says! We ordered several pies 'to go' for a group - traditional margarita, one with sausage and pepperoni, and the white pizza with sausage and broccoli rabe. The sausage and broccoli rabe was most people's least favorite. I guess when you think of pizza you usually want that red sauce on it! There wasn't a lot of flavor on this one otherwise. Thanks for the head's up about the wax bags instead of boxes fellow yelper! The pizza made it to our destination ok, but not the most convenient way to carry 4 pies! Definitely give yourself time - I called ahead and my pies were ready 55 minutes later (or 10 minutes longer then they said).",5.0
"Love Grimaldi's but didn't want to stand in that damned long line! Luckily his daughter built a place right next door and the pizza there is just the same - but without the damned long line!  It is expensive: 3 pizzas, 2 beers, and 1 soda cost us $100. But we had plenty to bring back to our hotel for late night snacking! They even packed our pizza to it would fit in the hotel refrigerator. They DO NOT OFFER A GLUTEN-FREE OPTION so only got four stars.",4.0
"Love the pizza. Coal oven. Never ever ever take this to go.I can't believe some idiot did that. This is not a pizza parlor where you get a slice to go. You go for the experience and the gourmet pizza. One tiny bit of criticism, the arugula pie looked like the guys in the back got a pre packaged arugula salad and popped it over the pizza. It was good but presentation left much to be desired.",5.0
"My family loved the food here.  There was a line to get in, but the wait was definitely worth it.  The No. 4 pizza with tomato, mozzarella, arugula and prosciutto was delicious. The homemade meatballs were also good. The also have a decent selections of wine.  One of my favorite NY pizza places.",5.0
This is my first Yelp review because I feel like it's my duty to tell the world how amazing this pizza is. We split a caesar salad and margherita pizza with pepperoni (the tiny kind) and left stuffed and happy. Forget Grimaldi's and eat here.,5.0
"Juliana's was a wonderful experience all around. My boyfriend and I were visiting NYC for the TD five boro bike tour and both had a mad craving for some authentic Brooklyn pizza. Yelp lead us to Juliana's.  It was 3:30 and we were standing in a short line outside (small dining area) and the manager comes out and very kindly explains that they need to re-stoke? the oven, that it was about a 20 min process, but we were welcome to sit maybe an appetizer while we waited for the oven to come back up to temperature. He promised a pipping hot, perfect pizza after the process. The waiter recommended we  go ahead and our pizza order in, in order to receive the first pie out, so we did (margherita  pizza with added prosciutto) In the meantime we split a delicious Caesar salad. Our waiter (who was great, we had excellent service) did not steer us wrong. It was THE BEST pizza I have ever had. Every inch was a bit of heaven. Every ingredient was fresh. Mozzarella is made in house. The prosciutto was hands down the best I have ever had. Forget about adding red pepper or salt. It's not needed.",5.0
"The real Grimaldi's! When we want great pizza we come here for a margherita with pepporoni. Worth the price, food is always fresh and service is Great!",5.0
"It's actually been about a year since I ate here, and I wasn't really into Yelping at the time so never wrote anything.  Will keep this short - possibly the best classic style pizza I've ever had.  Older guy that I think owned the place came by and chatted, and the waiter gave us a pizza history lesson.  We walked back to Manhattan across the bridge right after dinner.  Wonderful evening - great memories - five stars.",5.0
"I had this presumption in my head that New York had the best pizza in the country, however I have been overly disappointed by every other place I tried. After trying Julianna's my pizza search is over! The line took about 15 minutes to get seated, the pizza came quickly, and the service was friendly yet sparse. We ordered a margherita pizza, it was crazy delicious!",5.0
"It was really good, and high quality. The place filled within minutes of it opening, only thing they could be better is the sauce. Overall really good.",4.0
Amazing! Best in the city by far!,5.0
A-mazing!!!  Doesn't get better than this.  Margharita pizza is so simple but the real deal.  Must get a pizza with their pepperoni as well.  Gets very busy during lunchtime but regardless the staff provided great service.,5.0

I went here back to back days. The service is great! The quality is amazing. There is no way else in the world you can find pizza as fresh as this. I took my friend who is an out of towner.

"So... When I got off the subway at Clark St, a kitten-sized rat scurried across the platform about three feet in front of me. Definite freak out, minus the girly screaming. We walked over to Juliana's and hopped in line, shaking our heads at the poor, deluded tourists queued up at Grimaldi's next door. The wait was a bit long, but it was a Saturday night around 7, so it was to be expected. Verdict- the pizza was definitely worth the scare and the wait. I had a margherita pizza with roasted red peppers. The sauce was incredible. My only complaint is that the crust had been stretched too thin, leaving a hole. Patsy would have kicked it back for that. But all in all, a good pie. The rest of the group had a white pizza with olives, peppers and anchovies and another margherita with red peppers, pepperoni and mushrooms. Everyone left full and happy.",5.0

"We went on a Monday night with family that were visiting. We took the ferry downtown from Long Island City and decided to have an early dinner after walking the water front. There was a line but it moved quickly. We have four children and three adults. They were wonderful with the kids. I commend them for being family friendly. We had the garlic pizza, a margarita pizza, a soup and two salads. The portions of the salad and soup were perfect. Everything was delicious. The best part is everything came out very quickly, which is great for hungry kids. It was a fun evening to pair our trip with the ferry. I would return again with a smaller group as I think the wait might be shorter, but well worth it.",5.0
"When I made my trip to New York, I vowed to at least try a couple of different pizza places.  I did tons of research to try and get a consensus as to some of the best pizza in New York.   Even though opinions seem to vary wildly about pizza in New York (and how can it not with so many places to pick from!), it seems like Juliana's had consistently the best reviews.  I made the long walk across the Brooklyn Bridge, and got there close to noon.  I was able to get seated right away, and the friendly waitress gave me a rundown of the pizza, and her recommendations.  I opted for a half Margherita and half White pizza.  They don't serve slices here, and the smallest pizza was still almost too much for one person to finish.  However the slices are thin, so you can put down more than you think you can.  Both kinds of pizza were good......the white side reminded me of just a really good garlic bread.  The pizza was really good, but I can't say it will be all that memorable to me in the future.  I somehow remember being more wowed by Lombardis pizza when I visited New York a few years prior.  Just seemed like Lombardi's had more of a coal taste to the crust that I wasn't getting from Julianas.  Strangely, I found the pizza seemed to get better as it became colder.  It seemed like I was able to taste some olive oils coming out of the pizza, and the flavors just popped a little more.  The one dissapointing thing was that I love to drink Coke with my pizza.....and all they have at Juliana's are small glass bottles of Coke.....and of course no refills.  So for $3, you essentially get a few sips of soda to go with your pizza.  I'm not sure why certain restaurants put such a premium on Coke, when it's so cheap to install and serve.  Overall I had a good experience, and I would go back again on a future visit.",4.0
"Food : We tried the margarita pizza here and it was amazing. Especially the cheese. There was something soo fresh about the cheese. I would give them a 4/5 on that.

"Definitely one of the best pizza in NYC! This is the true Grimaldi's Pizza! You can actually see the maestro, Patsy Grimaldi, preparing the pizza dough himself! He also likes to walk around, greeting customer & asking about their experience. He made a small conversation with one of us (Mr F.G) when Ms M.S went to the restroom. Very friendly guy! We had one small margherita & one small white pizza. Wow! The pizza were really good! So seriously good! Thinking about it is making us hungry right now! High quality cheese! Well balanced with the sauce. The thin crust was done perfectly. We really can't say which one we like better. We love both pies equally! The size of the small pie is decent, you can actually share for two people. We were two hungry people with big appetite! One small pie is definitely too small for us to share. The service was great! The waiter were attentive. The pizza came out pretty quickly. You don't have to wait for long. As for the place, well, it's a lot nicer than when it was Grimaldi's, & somehow it's much more spacious now. We were there around 6pm on a Tuesday night.

"After trekking across the Brooklyn Bridge we were hungry and figured we might as well continue the tourist experience and grab some pizza. I grew up in Chicago, lived in NYC for 5 years and now am in DC where the pizza is generally below average, so I was excited to get some real Italian pizza. Even at 2:30pm the lines at both Grimaldi's and Juliana's were long, so we committed to Juliana's since the reviews were slightly better. After waiting about 10 minutes in line, an employee popped outside to let everyone know they stop seating tables at 3:15pm to reheat the ovens. I really appreciated the heads up instead of waiting in line and getting turned away later. It was such a beautiful day we opted to place a to-go order and snagged a table outside in the pedestrian area on the street. The pizza was ready after only 15 minutes and it was amazing. Seriously, I haven't been able to get good Italian sausage with fennel in years! The mozzarella was fresh, the tomatoes sauce actually tasted like tomatoes and there was the perfect amount of crust (about 3/4""). I would go back in a heart beat next time I'm visiting NY.",5.0

I yelped and Juliana's has better reviews.  Wait was about 30 mins on a Sunday night around 8pm, but outdoor seating was immediate!  I'm not picky, nor high maintenance so that's what we did!  Margherita pizza was only $17 for small (good for 2 people) and we added garlic, pepperoni, and mushrooms.  Our server gave a great recommendation for wine, but I unfortunately don't remember what it was :(  Total for 2 people came out to be $40 which isn't bad at all!  Pizza was light, fresh, and the crust was so chewy and delicious from the char of the oven.  Cold temperature from outside turned the cheese into a more gummy texture quicker.  Excellent, friendly service from an older gentleman",4.0
Worthy of the hype.  Very simple menu but amazingly fresh pizza.  The mozzarella cheese that they use was worth the wait and trip to Brooklyn by itself.,5.0
"My bf and I only had 2 days in New York and decided to come here on a recommendation. After an extremely long trip over, we arrived to a long line and were concerned it wouldn't live up to our expectations....but instead, Juliannas exceeded them! Our server kept coming around to make sure we were taken care of and struck up a great conversation with us. We got a half Margarita, half white pizza with pepperoni and sausage. I'm not usually a fan of pepperoni  (i know, so odd) but this pepperoni was like the king of pepperoni. All in all, an amazing experience and I am greatly anticipating heating up our leftovers for lunch. Yummmm",5.0
"After trekking across the Brooklyn Bridge we were hungry and figured we might as well continue the tourist experience and grab some pizza. I grew up in Chicago, lived in NYC for 5 years and now am in DC where the pizza is generally below average, so I was excited to get some real Italian pizza. Even at 2:30pm the lines at both Grimaldi's and Juliana's were long, so we committed to Juliana's since the reviews were slightly better. After waiting about 10 minutes in line, an employee popped outside to let everyone know they stop seating tables at 3:15pm to reheat the ovens. I really appreciated the heads up instead of waiting in line and getting turned away later. It was such a beautiful day we opted to place a to-go order and snagged a table outside in the pedestrian area on the street. The pizza was ready after only 15 minutes and it was amazing. Seriously, I haven't been able to get good Italian sausage with fennel in years! The mozzarella was fresh, the tomatoes sauce actually tasted like tomatoes and there was the perfect amount of crust (about 3/4""). I would go back in a heart beat next time I'm visiting NY.",5.0

What Grimaldi's used to be! Started by the same owners who became disillusioned with the commercialized pizza business.

"The NY Pizza Saga is long and complex, you usually find the long rivalries printed on the back of menus but Juliana's and ""Grimaldi's"" is a whole different ballgame.  I first came to the original location of Grimaldi's in 2007 on the first date in NY with a woman who eventually became my wife.  Grimaldi's Pizza was a first experience, we had a Margherita with Dried Tomatos and Pepperoni and instantly fell in love with pizza (and I believe her with New York.)  The sauce was Garlicy and fresh, the mozzarella was in fresh slices melted on, the basil adds a herbal tone to the taste, the dough was crunchy in every bite with a unique smoky flavor only a brick oven can provide.  The Pepperoni was thick rich chunks and unlike any of the thin slices you get typically.  This was not the neighborhood cheezy slice I grew up with in the Brooklyn neighborhood, this was something else.Fast forward to today, we had just moved apartments and now found that we lived close to the Grimaldi's location we first went to.  We had heard rumors that Grimald's was springing up all over the place and only cared that we can get the same taste and service at the original location.  When we got there we were utterly confused when Grimaldi's had moved in to a building that looked like at city hall.  Where we were used to long lines waiting before the location opens and staff organizing the line, this time Grimaldi's did not have a long 30 minutes before open and the staff was comfortably inside.We looked over at the original location and found Juliana's in it's place.  Standing in front was a young waiter out in the freezing cold near the river waving at us.  We waved back to dismiss him, frustrated someone had stolen the original location of our favorite pizza place.  The young waiter waved at us again and screamed ""You want to eat at Grimaldi's?  I'll tell you why they moved and if you don't like the story you can go back there.""  Expecting a New York Con job we walked over to talk to the young waiter.  It was very clear that the waiter could not claim to be Grimaldi's because the restaurant name had been sold a long time ago, he had to tell the story about Patsy and his Grandmother.  Nostalgic about the original location and sad that it had moved, we talked in not expecting a pleasant surprise.  But we were surprised.All that who is the first, and who is the original, and turf war drama doesn't matter.  At the end of the day what matters is what you serve on the table.The Margherita Pizza was the Pizza we remembered on our first date.  We ordered it with half sausage and half pepperoni with garlic on the whole pie.  The prices were similar to Manhattan Pizza places but we expected that.  The original Grimaldi's Pizza oven was still there working its magic.  The staff is young but well trained but unlike the old restaurant where you could tell the cooks had many years of pizza making to their name. It's exciting to see that Patsy Grimaldi has resurrected his restaurant and while the Pizza here was 95% what we wanted (we remember the crust being crunchier and the mozzarella with slightly more pop) we know that this will improve as the staff gets more experience.Begun this Pizza War has.",4.0

"So I came to this location in 2010 and it was a completely different restaurant - a grimaldi's. Fast forward to a few weeks ago. Some friends and I were on vacation in NYC. We decided to walk across Brooklyn bridge and grab Grimaldi's afterward. We told one of our local friends about it and she suggested we go to Juliana's instead. After looking up reviews on yelp, we decided to give it a try.We walked past the new Grimaldi's location and to where Grimaldi's used to be. I was shocked at how different it looked! It seemed much more spacious and it had a very sleek style. The iconic pizza oven was back there. We were quickly seated and ordered a small margarita pizza and a small number 1. We also had a chianti and 2 beers (total bill came out to $71).  While waiting for our food, we did a little research about Grimaldi's vs. Juliana's and it turns out that there is some bad blood there. I remember eating at Grimaldi's years ago and I remember the pie being good, but a bit soggy. Juliana's pizza was not soggy at all. It had a nice crust. Very tasty sauce. Delicious cheese. It was an excellent pizza. I would go here over Grimaldi's every time.",4.0
"We LOVED Juliana's Pizza! I had read about the opening and the related drama back several years ago when NY Mag did several stories about the unfolding drama between Patsy and the folks who now had the naming rights to ""Grimaldi's"", and knew we just HAD to try Juliana's and taste the original Pasty Grimaldi's pizza!We finally had the opportunity to do on a brisk Sunday afternoon. There was a line snaking out of Grimaldi's, but we were seated immediately at Juliana's by the legend himself, Patsy. Our server warned us that the oven was being stoked, so it would take several minutes for them to start firing up pizzas, but we were totally fine with the wait. And why not, when our pizzas were going to be made in a real brick oven??We had the arugula salad, which was DELICIOUS. We were also so hungry we ended up ordering another arugula salad when we had devoured the first one. We also had the pie #1, a white pizza with sopressa, some truffles, pancetta, and green onions. Our friends LOVED the #1, while I was head over heels for the margherita with garlic! It was everything a pizza should be - crisp yet chewy crust, perfect sauce, fresh mozz, and we also added garlic which threw the whole pie into another realm.Our service was friendly and attentive and didn't rush us out of the door when we were finished. Patsy was working the floor making sure everyone was happy (which we were!!), and we left extremely full and happy. Why go to the place next door when you can get the original at Juliana's?? We will definitely be back!",5.0

Was definitely worth the trip across brooklyn bridge. Yummm. Make sure to go with another person as the portion for the pizza can be quite big for a lot of people. I will definitely be back when i visit in the future.,5.0
"We had the margarita pizza...yeah, it was good, but why do I think Grimaldi's  was better?  The service here is definitely better than Grimaldi's.  Did I turn into a girl that loves bad guys (aka restaurant that treats you with no respect).No!  I am not a tourist!",3.0
Been in NYC for 7 years and finally discovered the best pizza ever! White pizza with shiitake mushrooms. The crust is breathtaking.,5.0
"So I came to this location in 2010 and it was a completely different restaurant - a grimaldi's. Fast forward to a few weeks ago. Some friends and I were on vacation in NYC. We decided to walk across Brooklyn bridge and grab Grimaldi's afterward. We told one of our local friends about it and she suggested we go to Juliana's instead. After looking up reviews on yelp, we decided to give it a try.We walked past the new Grimaldi's location and to where Grimaldi's used to be. I was shocked at how different it looked! It seemed much more spacious and it had a very sleek style. The iconic pizza oven was back there. We were quickly seated and ordered a small margarita pizza and a small number 1. We also had a chianti and 2 beers (total bill came out to $71).  While waiting for our food, we did a little research about Grimaldi's vs. Juliana's and it turns out that there is some bad blood there. I remember eating at Grimaldi's years ago and I remember the pie being good, but a bit soggy. Juliana's pizza was not soggy at all. It had a nice crust. Very tasty sauce. Delicious cheese. It was an excellent pizza. I would go here over Grimaldi's every time.",4.0
"We LOVED Juliana's Pizza! I had read about the opening and the related drama back several years ago when NY Mag did several stories about the unfolding drama between Patsy and the folks who now had the naming rights to ""Grimaldi's"", and knew we just HAD to try Juliana's and taste the original Pasty Grimaldi's pizza!We finally had the opportunity to do on a brisk Sunday afternoon. There was a line snaking out of Grimaldi's, but we were seated immediately at Juliana's by the legend himself, Patsy. Our server warned us that the oven was being stoked, so it would take several minutes for them to start firing up pizzas, but we were totally fine with the wait. And why not, when our pizzas were going to be made in a real brick oven??We had the arugula salad, which was DELICIOUS. We were also so hungry we ended up ordering another arugula salad when we had devoured the first one. We also had the pie #1, a white pizza with sopressa, some truffles, pancetta, and green onions. Our friends LOVED the #1, while I was head over heels for the margherita with garlic! It was everything a pizza should be - crisp yet chewy crust, perfect sauce, fresh mozz, and we also added garlic which threw the whole pie into another realm.Our service was friendly and attentive and didn't rush us out of the door when we were finished. Patsy was working the floor making sure everyone was happy (which we were!!), and we left extremely full and happy. Why go to the place next door when you can get the original at Juliana's?? We will definitely be back!",5.0
"Hands down the best pizza we have ever had.  We came about 11:45 on a Friday and waiting only 5 minutes for a table.  Ordered 2 small pies and had leftovers even with 4 people eating.  Excellent flavors, crust is chewy and wood fired, not over sauced or over spiced, just quality fresh toppings on an awesome crust.  I would come every day if I lived local.  Service was fast and friendly, restrooms clean.

"line out the door next to go Grimaldi's. i came at 3:45 and JUST made it in the door at 4 to put in a order before they closed for oven cleaning. friendly and tentative service, clean and new space; though fairly small. the pizza itself is superb but don't wait to eat it. its at its best when it lands on your table. the last couple slices just wasn't as good as the first bites but overall, everything was delicious and fresh. their small pie is fairly large and for 5 people, we had one salad, one large pie (prosciutto, buffalo mozzarella, and arugula) and one small pie (classic margherita) We couldn't finish!The proscuitto pie was amazeballs. and the pile on the good stuff.",4.0

"We came into Juliana's after a local told us to bypass Grimaldi's because the actual Grimaldi sold the business and later opened Juliana. This is not the best pizza I've ever had, but it was pretty dang delicious. The ingredients all tasted so fresh they were probably grown in the backyard. We ordered the Margherita. The cheese was by far amazing, and I feel like I've never had a cheese like that on a pizza. (If it was mozzarella, that'd be a really silly statement.) Even the dough was amazing! We also ordered their soup du jour and it was a white bean noodle one that I don't remember the name of. Blame it on 10 degree weather but this soup was beyond perfect. It tasted like someone's grandmother cooked it after hearing they had a miserable day. Overall, really great place! I read somewhere that they rush people out of the place, but my server was amazing, nice, and really funny. He even told me to take my time cause the weather was miserable. I'd definitely be back if I'm ever in Brooklyn again.",4.0
"Came with my boyfriend. We went for the Dumbo Art Festival and as you can imagine, the line was very long. We've waited for almost one hour to eat pizza....Unbelievable.

We also ate dessert in the end - a mixture of brownie and cookie - also not bad.",5.0
"Well.. I m from LA so the price here is a bit pricey for me. It tastes good, no doubt about it. But i don't like a feeling that the bread gets thicker and thicker from the center to the crust.

"Mr. Grimaldi opened up a pizzeria in his old location after selling off his namesake to someone else (who has expanded it all over the country now...I saw one in Dallas).

"Food is an important ingredient to having a successful restaurant.  The other is service.  Mr. Grimaldi and the staff at Juliana's demonstrate great service while serving a finely crafted product. I had the arugula salad and signature Margherita pizza.  The salad had the right amount of dressing to allow enjoyment of the ingredient's natural flavors. The pizza also had the right amount of ingredients with a thin crust to permit enjoyment of the ingredients individual flavors.  The sauce is not very salty and the whole product not too oily. Cooking, in general, when done properly maintains a balance between ingredients and finished product.  Juliana's gets it right and maintains the balance. I also like the openness of the kitchen. You can also watch the pizza being prepared, which reflects comfort with the craft and honesty with the process.",5.0
"Holy pizza. Juliana's is the real deal. Hyped up pizza places tend to be let downs for me. I mean, it's just pizza, right? Juliana's is...life changing pizza.

"Hands down, the best pizza. Juliana's is a life changing experience - and everyone who we've brought here agrees. First, you have to understand the story. Juliana's is located in the original Grimaldi's building, with the original coal fired oven, and it's run by Patsy Grimaldi himself. Next door, you'll find a restaurant by the name Grimaldi's with a huge line of uninformed lemmings. Patsy Grimaldi sold this and the naming rights when he retired. For various reasons, including his frustration with the quality and management of the Grimaldi's he sold, Patsy came out of retirement to reopen the original and bring back the best New York pizza.You can find Patsy at the restaurant most days, demanding the best quality, schmoozing with his patrons, and hustling the streets in front of his restaurant. As a man in his 70's, this is definitely his passion.We've eaten at both Grimaldi's and Juliana's many times. No longer will we waste our time at Grimaldi's. While the price is a bit lower, the service is rude, the place is dirty (including the silverware and plates), and the pizza is overly greasy. It's still better than most pizza, but far below Juliana's. Juliana's pizza is fresh, crisp with the right amount of chew and texture, high quality ingredients carefully portioned, and cooked to perfection in the age old coal oven. The pizza cooks take pride and work fast and consistently to produce literally the highest quality pizza possible. In addition to pizza, Juliana's salads are fresh, crisp, and made with the same amount of care as their pizza. Homemade dressings that actually dress instead of drown the beautiful salads. The true testament to the pizza is the odd phenomena of eating about 3x what you could normally eat. This is in part due to the relatively thin crust, careful portioning of cheese, and the absolutely our of this world flavor. In short, if you want NYC pizza and have to choose one place, go here. The Brooklyn bridge park nearby will give you a great place to walk and get the best views of downtown Manhattan after you've filled your belly.",5.0

And then Patsy Grimaldi hit on my date, telling her that she should just move into his house and help keep it tidy. We looked up his house on Zillow, the technology blowing his mind and leading to quite a few good laughs. Patsy lives quite well, I will have you know. Pizza pays. Patsy was a riot, casually tossing hand-tossed doughs across the restaurant into the kitchen to be baked. Patsy readily answered our questions on how to master better home-baked pizzas, and before we knew it, we were in the kitchen rolling out pies. Patsy even offered to go into business with us, if we opened a restaurant in NY. He wasn't interested in relocating to Seattle, unfortunately.For those that don't know, Patsy owned Grimaldi's next door for 20 years before selling the restaurant and the Grimaldi's name to a ""deadbeat"" in 2000.

"First of all, a note about lines. The line at Juliana's is almost or just as long as the line for Grimaldi's.Both restaurants are great. They are essentially the same recipe, started by the same person, and after having both, I think they are both five-star pizzas.But Juliana's perhaps has the edge between the two. Our particular pie did come out perhaps a titch over-cooked, but it's forgivable since it was a difference of maybe 30 seconds in the oven. They put the proscuitto (my only topping on a classic margherita) on after the oven, which is the correct way to do it, and it was so good.Perfect amount of tomato, great mozzarella, plenty of basil, not overly greasy. It's the good stuff.Go here.I will add that I think Patsy is perhaps approaching senility. He got in a fight with his manager in front of the line and it was a bit ugly. But really, we're here for the pizza, not the drama, which there clearly is plenty of. And the pizza makes it all better.",5.0

"Thank goodness for coming to NY with someone who's been here before.  My travel buddy gave me a brief synopsis of this place, the history and all the coolness behind Patsy Grimaldi.  In Las Vegas, we have a bunch of Grimaldi's pizza, so it was cool to hear the story of how he started it and later sold the business.  I was hoping to get the chance to meet him in his new restaurant.  Take the Blue Line subway to High St in Brooklyn and walk towards the DUMBO (Down Under the Manhattan/Brooklyn Overpass).  Right before you hit it, you'll see Grimaldi's on the corner and Juliana's right next door.  What a quaint and cute place!  Get there early, because there aren't a lot of space.  The walls were white, the trimmings were black and the kitchen was just as big as the dining area.  One focal point I loved was the Juliana's FAQs. It was a black board with frequent questions about the joint.  Basically, Juliana was Patsy's mom, she's originally from Melfi, Italy and loves Scamorza pie!  Another HUGE focal point, more a highlight, was Patsy Grimaldi!!!  We actually got to see him work in the kitchen, wait tables and even take some time to take a few pictures with fans like myself.  Omg, what a legacy, what a treat, what an inspiration.  He's such an easy going guy, down to earth and super sweet.  Alright, for dinner, here's what we got:Appetizer:  Hearts of Romaine and Caesar dressing with croutons, white anchovies and green Sicilian olives for $13.  The salad was crisp and fresh.  Shaved parmesan made for a tangy and salty flavor.  Loved it.Drinks:  Mezzacorona Pinot Grigio for $9.  I love Pinot Grigio with salads and pizzas.  It's light, crisp with a hint of fruit.  Perfect drink.Dinner:  We shared the small No. 4 for $26.  Trust me, it feeds 2-3 people.  This pizza was filled with tomatoes, mozzarella, arugula and prosciutto.  What a perfect pizza!  The crust.  Man, it was superb!  Light, thin and crunchy.  Exactly how I love my pizza.  There were chunks of tomatoes, big pieces of creamy mozzarella.  The arugula was lightly crunchy and offered a light bitterness which brought out the flavor of the pizza!  The prosciutto was marbleized and was packed with flavor.  Such an awesome combination!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DISH!If you're ever in the area and DON'T visit Juliana's, you are missing out!  I've always said it, when it Rome...well, I wanted to try an authentic NY style pizza in NY and I've found the mecca!  This place is out of this world.  Thanks Patsy and the gang of Juliana's!",5.0
"Wish I could give more than 5 stars. BEST pizza I've ever had in my life. (Marguerita) I have been mentally dissecting and reliving the perfection. Thin, ideal crisp to the crust. Strategically-placed dollops of creamy ricotta (you can just tell they made it themselves or sourced it with care), then wAfts of fresh tomato sauce. (I watched them make one--the sauce doesn't cover the entire bottom of the pie. Then fresh basil & some dried Italian herbs. The place was packed, we waited about 15 minutes for our table but they invited us to order while we waited so our Caesar salad got to the table 2 minutes after we did & the pizza shortly thereafter. Excellent friendly service made better by the waiter offering to take our picture. New bucket list: keep going back to try every pizza they offer. PS: this is the ""real"" Grimaldi's. Apparently the original, which draws hordes of people who wait in long lines & is next door, was sold by the Grimaldi family, who now run Juliana's. Do not pass GO--head straight for Juliana's!",5.0
"I have to be honest. This really wasn't anything special. The crust was thin and cooked well. The sauce didn't have all that much flavor and the mozzarella was used sparingly. I ordered a pizza that had arugula on top and the arugula had very clearly not been washed. It was like chewing on sand, or dirt as I imagine I actually was. Disgusting. We had the unfortunate experience of coming right before a very drunk pizza tour got to the restaurant. The staff were incredibly apologetic to us for these people so if I was giving a review based on the staff, I would be giving 5 stars. The staff was wonderful. Just as we finished eating, I saw another large tour come in and told my husband we needed to leave right away. I couldn't handle another loud and extremely obnoxious group. We got our very high bill (the prices are outrageous here. I guess being famous allows for this because I know Grimaldi's to be the same) and we left. There's far better pizza in New York folks. One of which is right on the corner.",3.0
"First of all, a note about lines. The line at Juliana's is almost or just as long as the line for Grimaldi's.Both restaurants are great. They are essentially the same recipe, started by the same person, and after having both, I think they are both five-star pizzas.But Juliana's perhaps has the edge between the two. Our particular pie did come out perhaps a titch over-cooked, but it's forgivable since it was a difference of maybe 30 seconds in the oven. They put the proscuitto (my only topping on a classic margherita) on after the oven, which is the correct way to do it, and it was so good.Perfect amount of tomato, great mozzarella, plenty of basil, not overly greasy. It's the good stuff.Go here.I will add that I think Patsy is perhaps approaching senility. He got in a fight with his manager in front of the line and it was a bit ugly. But really, we're here for the pizza, not the drama, which there clearly is plenty of. And the pizza makes it all better.",5.0
"We got specialty 1. We liked it, but not love it. We thought it was a little salty, and actually lady next table was complaining the same thing. We were gonna get the basic one, but the waiter convinced us to try this instead. Maybe because my husband likes red sauce, he was not too excited about this. It's nice to see Patsy  Gramildi walking around tho",4.0
"Around this area, juliana's, grilmadii's, and ignazios all had a line.  We picked this one cause we wanted to be harrassed by Patsy Grilmaldi the man himself.Our pizzas were fresh off the newly stoked coals.  Crust was damn good.  Prices were on point.  Service was amazing.  Those guys were super cool.  Almost too nice.  Are we still in NYC?  FYI. Coals are stoked around 315pm for about 30 min.  Meaning no pizza is made during that time.  So if u come around that time u may have to wait longer",5.0

"Really, really disappointed after the excellent Zagat rating and Yelp reviews. There was no line when I showed up around 5 for an early dinner.The decor, service, and food were all sub-par.

On my way to the bathroom I saw them chipping away at a bin of sausage, so it seems like the frozen toppings just weren't defrosted yet. That's right, frozen toppings. The restaurant is very cheaply decorated, the light fixtures look like they came from bed bath and beyond. I don't understand the hype and strongly recommend waiting on line for Grimaldi's.

"Located adjacent to Grimaldi's on Front Street, Juliana's provides authentic NYC coal fired pizza.  A little history never hurt right? The owner of Juliana's is Patsy Grimaldi (nephew of the founder of Pasty's in Harlem)...hm so you would think well doesn't he own grimaldi's...well he doesn't. Patsy actually founded Grimaldi's, but in 1998 he sold the Grimaldi's to Frank Ciolli.  The original location of Grimaldi's is where Juliana's currently whips up their famous pizzas.  A court feuding and what not, it was allowed for the two businesses to operate an hop, skip, and a jump away.  Back to the pizza: A simple margherita goes a long way in my book.  If you are looking to really taste the pizza this is the way to go.  You can only know a restaurant is the best if they can master the basics.  Juliana's masters the basics.  The sauce is a wonderful san marzano tomato, which provides a bit of a sweet taste.  The coal fired crust give you that unforgettable NYC pizza taste.  For a hungry group of 4 I would recommend getting either 2 large pies or a 1 large/1 small.  You can always take the leftovers, but I doubt there will be any.  The line can be long and so can the wait, but it's typically shorter than Grimaldi's.  You will not regret your decision to come here.",4.0
"I don't think I have eaten real pizza until today. I have passed Grimaldi's several times without noticing Juliana's and for some reason, have never wanted go in despite the hype. Recently, I began to crave authentic Neapolitan pizza that's prepared in brick oven and did a little searching for the spot to have my first taste. I soon realized my initial instincts about Grimaldi's was on point after reading the story behind the two shops. I decided on on Juliana's for the sake of supporting the original owner.As soon as I walked into the shop, the staff was extremely friendly. My waiter saw my girlfriend fanning me after our long trek to this shop and decided to take two huge menu's to join my girlfriend in fanning me. This made everyone around me smile. The pizza was amazing. We ordered the Margherita. The sauce was perfect in consistency and tanginess and the pizza was baked just right. The crust was deliciously crunchy without being burnt. Usually I am extremely thirsty after eating pizza due to its high salt content but not after Juliana's!",5.0
"I came here with a friend of mine who's a little bit of a pizza snob. Full disclosure: I did not eat at Grimaldi's before, so I can't really compare the two. My dining companion has and swears by Juliana's. We got there at around 7PM and luckily there was no wait! (Ironically, Grimaldi's line was as always stretching around the block.) Our waitress was really accommodating and sweet and made small talk, quite like small family place, which was a nice touch. We got the Margherita and it was amazing! No joke. We got the small, mostly because we were two girls and the large looked HUGE. It's a pretty good meal -- four slices of pizza. The flavor, everything, en pointe! It was very classic with a lot of tomato flavor. I really enjoyed it. Was it the best pizza I ever had? No, see my review of Osteria Procaccini in NJ. But it was pretty damn close!PS.

"We were originally in line for Grimaldi's, but with my grandparents and my aunt waiting a few blocks down, we were not looking for a 1+ hour wait for a togo order, so we went next door, to Juliana's. What some people fail to realize as they wait FOREVER at Grimaldi's is that the original owner of Grimaldi's opened up and works at Juliana's. She even came out and talked to some of us as we waited for our pizza to be ready. She made Grimaldi's what it is today, and then sold the name, and started Juliana's. So, by dining at Juliana's, you are getting the authentic Grimaldi's.So, we ordered the margherita pizza which consists of marinara, cheese, and basil. Simple, yet very delectable. We also ordered the white pizza, which is pizza without any marinara sauce, cheese, and garlic. To my shocking surprise, it was actually pretty good. Although, I would of LOVED to try their marinara pizza, which is pizza with only marinara sauce. MY FAVORITE.

"Located adjacent to Grimaldi's on Front Street, Juliana's provides authentic NYC coal fired pizza.  A little history never hurt right? The owner of Juliana's is Patsy Grimaldi (nephew of the founder of Pasty's in Harlem)...hm so you would think well doesn't he own grimaldi's...well he doesn't. Patsy actually founded Grimaldi's, but in 1998 he sold the Grimaldi's to Frank Ciolli.  The original location of Grimaldi's is where Juliana's currently whips up their famous pizzas.  A court feuding and what not, it was allowed for the two businesses to operate an hop, skip, and a jump away.  Back to the pizza: A simple margherita goes a long way in my book.  If you are looking to really taste the pizza this is the way to go.  You can only know a restaurant is the best if they can master the basics.  Juliana's masters the basics.  The sauce is a wonderful san marzano tomato, which provides a bit of a sweet taste.  The coal fired crust give you that unforgettable NYC pizza taste.  For a hungry group of 4 I would recommend getting either 2 large pies or a 1 large/1 small.  You can always take the leftovers, but I doubt there will be any.  The line can be long and so can the wait, but it's typically shorter than Grimaldi's.  You will not regret your decision to come here.",4.0
"I don't think I have eaten real pizza until today. I have passed Grimaldi's several times without noticing Juliana's and for some reason, have never wanted go in despite the hype. Recently, I began to crave authentic Neapolitan pizza that's prepared in brick oven and did a little searching for the spot to have my first taste. I soon realized my initial instincts about Grimaldi's was on point after reading the story behind the two shops. I decided on on Juliana's for the sake of supporting the original owner.As soon as I walked into the shop, the staff was extremely friendly. My waiter saw my girlfriend fanning me after our long trek to this shop and decided to take two huge menu's to join my girlfriend in fanning me. This made everyone around me smile. The pizza was amazing. We ordered the Margherita. The sauce was perfect in consistency and tanginess and the pizza was baked just right. The crust was deliciously crunchy without being burnt. Usually I am extremely thirsty after eating pizza due to its high salt content but not after Juliana's!",5.0
"I came here with a friend of mine who's a little bit of a pizza snob. Full disclosure: I did not eat at Grimaldi's before, so I can't really compare the two. My dining companion has and swears by Juliana's. We got there at around 7PM and luckily there was no wait! (Ironically, Grimaldi's line was as always stretching around the block.) Our waitress was really accommodating and sweet and made small talk, quite like small family place, which was a nice touch. We got the Margherita and it was amazing! No joke. We got the small, mostly because we were two girls and the large looked HUGE. It's a pretty good meal -- four slices of pizza. The flavor, everything, en pointe! It was very classic with a lot of tomato flavor. I really enjoyed it. Was it the best pizza I ever had? No, see my review of Osteria Procaccini in NJ. But it was pretty damn close!PS. It's also right next to the pier and Brooklyn Bridge Park. Great location for a date night and a stroll! There's also a rather interesting bridge nearby ;)",4.0

"Juliana's is everything I envisioned NYC pizza to be; perfectly thin crust with a slight chew and just enough char, excellent sauce and high quality toppings. Their Margherita is simply fantastic.

We got a large pie with pepperoni and mushroom toppings as well, but we didn't have much luck with that one either. In sum. Juliana's pizza doesn't come anywhere close to that of Grimaldi's, or even Patsy's, which I consider a step below Grimaldi's.

"Something I will shamefully admit is my smugness while standing on a short line at Juliana's watching the extremely long line at Grimaldi's. Little do they know that Mr. Patsy Grimaldi himself is finding eager patrons their tables 100 feet away. And while the Grimaldi's folk will leave wondering what the fuss was all about and how they possibly waited like an hour for mediocre pizza, the rest of us at Juliana's will scarf down delicious pizza, and leave immensely satisfied, looking forward to their next pie.Sadly, I never tried Grimaldi's before it was bought and moved to its current location on the corner. Thankfully, the pizza gods must have sensed great disturbance in the NY pizza scene and encouraged Patsy Grimaldi to open a new pizza restaurant, thus restoring order to the universe. All is right again.So, my experience - At 7:30 on a warm Friday night in May, three of us waited for about twenty minutes before being seated. Not too bad, eh? Waiting for the menus did take a while - about 10 minutes - as there were only two waiters. Nevertheless, the restaurant was so packed, it's hard to imagine adding another one to the room.We ordered two large pizzas: one margherita and one heartstopper. The waiter cautioned us that it might be too much food. He said that generally, two people share one large pie, and maybe it might be better if we ordered one small pie instead of two large pies. That was very considerate of him, but thanks, we know our stomachs well. Two large pies? Done, and gone, crust and all, and we still have room for more.One test that countless pizza places fail at, including neighborhood slice joints, is the droopiness test. Lift a slice by the crust without supporting the tip, and see if it falls over. Both of our pizzas passed. I love thin-crusted pizza that can hold itself up without being too thick and doughy, and maintain its crispiness. You don't need to fold, you don't need to cut. Just lift, and take that first, most satisfying bite of the slice.The margherita is top-notch, and a great classic choice if that's what you're craving. The tomato sauce is light and sweet. The mozzarella is fresh, with just the right amount of stringiness. The heartstopper doesn't have tomatoes, but that doesn't make it any less flavorful. It is topped with mozzarella, Scamorza, pancetta, scallions, and truffle oil. The pancetta can get a little too salty, considering how thin the pizza is, but the other toppings, particularly the scallions, help cut the saltiness down. The different cheeses also add another dimension.If you're looking for somewhere less crowded, don't feel like Juliana's can't fit your bill. The Manhattan skyline is just a few steps away, so order a pie to go and eat at the park instead. Perfect date, no?",5.0
"The man and I had a super delicious pie here on Memorial Day. I've been looking forward to trying Juliana's since I first read about all the drama in a NY Mag feature last year. I'm a Lombardi's devotee (it's the sauce!), but Juliana's makes some damn good pizza. We got the large marinara and topped it with pepperoni, roasted peppers, and scamorza cheese. I'd never had nor heard of scamorza, but it was smoky and delightful. They're liberal with the toppings, which I appreciate, but I could have gone with a slightly crispier crust. The BEST part for me, though, was the Brookie Bridge we got for dessert. It's an ice cream sandwich, you guys, but instead of just plain old cookies doing the sandwiching, it's this magical cross between a cookie and a brownie. Brookie. We went with raspberry ice cream. Perfection.Other highlights:...the super garlicky croutons on the caesar salad...Sixpoint Sweet Action Ale!...a much shorter line than Grimaldi's next door...a much more pleasant man managing said line",5.0
Had a chance to see the Brooklyn Bridge on my last visit home and stopped at Juliana's for some pizza.  Don't let the line out the door deter you.  The wait is well worth it.  Had the Margarita with pep and olives.  A little different but quite delecious.  They will put together just about any request.  So everyone is bound to enjoy their visit to Juliana's.,5.0
"I was having pizza next door when I saw an article in the paper on the window saying Patsy and Carol Grimaldi were coming back to DUMBO and coming back under the name Juliana - named after his mother. I had to make it back this way after it opened.I went after an event in the area and was seated right away...the place was about an hour from closing. The service was super. The food came out fast after we ordered. All the staff was super friendly.My friend and I got 1 large pie...because...why not. We got the margarita pie with half prosciutto. The pie was delicious with a nice crunch thin crust, fresh tomato sauce (this was really one AMAZING sauce). The mozzarella was fresh...in all honesty, I could have probably done without the prosciutto, which was added after the pie was cooked. It just wasn't quite the quality prosciutto I was looking for. The crust was thin, but the middle wasn't so soggy, or soggy at all, that you could properly fold it in half like you should.Not my super favorite, but quite delicious and totally worth checking out. I hear the ice cream sandwiches are delicious and will have to try that next time.",4.0
"Hands down my favorite pizza place!This place has Grimaldi himself, as well as the original Grimaldi pizza oven, which means everything for a pizza place.

"Welcome back Patsy! Who would have thought to have you back after so many years at exact the same place? Your pizza, as usually is amazing. I'm also happy about not standing in line anymore as there's finally enough place for everyone with Grimaldi's right next door. I wish though the prices weren't that high. Grimaldi's at its old place was so unique because it offered world class pizza to affordable prices. Anyways, it's still worth it. Love it.",5.0
"You don't want to queue up for 2 hours to go to Grimaldi's? Easy: go to Juliana's, and you'll have a Patsy pizza with only a 10 mn wait (we went on a Sunday at 2pm though - it might be a little bit more crowded for dinner...)There are 10 pizzas, 5 classic ones around 20$ (for a large one - which is meant to serve 2) and 5 specials around $28 (for the large as well). We took the Special n'1, which was delicious.The service is very nice - the waitresses are quite busy so they are not hoovering by your table (which actually feels quite overwhelming for a European!), but they are very attentive to your every needs.

"The man and I had a super delicious pie here on Memorial Day. I've been looking forward to trying Juliana's since I first read about all the drama in a NY Mag feature last year. I'm a Lombardi's devotee (it's the sauce!), but Juliana's makes some damn good pizza. We got the large marinara and topped it with pepperoni, roasted peppers, and scamorza cheese. I'd never had nor heard of scamorza, but it was smoky and delightful. They're liberal with the toppings, which I appreciate, but I could have gone with a slightly crispier crust. The BEST part for me, though, was the Brookie Bridge we got for dessert. It's an ice cream sandwich, you guys, but instead of just plain old cookies doing the sandwiching, it's this magical cross between a cookie and a brownie. Brookie. We went with raspberry ice cream. Perfection.Other highlights:...the super garlicky croutons on the caesar salad...Sixpoint Sweet Action Ale!...a much shorter line than Grimaldi's next door...a much more pleasant man managing said line",5.0
Had a chance to see the Brooklyn Bridge on my last visit home and stopped at Juliana's for some pizza.  Don't let the line out the door deter you.  The wait is well worth it.  Had the Margarita with pep and olives.  A little different but quite delecious.  They will put together just about any request.  So everyone is bound to enjoy their visit to Juliana's.,5.0
"I was having pizza next door when I saw an article in the paper on the window saying Patsy and Carol Grimaldi were coming back to DUMBO and coming back under the name Juliana - named after his mother. I had to make it back this way after it opened.I went after an event in the area and was seated right away...the place was about an hour from closing. The service was super. The food came out fast after we ordered. All the staff was super friendly.My friend and I got 1 large pie...because...why not. We got the margarita pie with half prosciutto. The pie was delicious with a nice crunch thin crust, fresh tomato sauce (this was really one AMAZING sauce). The mozzarella was fresh...in all honesty, I could have probably done without the prosciutto, which was added after the pie was cooked. It just wasn't quite the quality prosciutto I was looking for. The crust was thin, but the middle wasn't so soggy, or soggy at all, that you could properly fold it in half like you should.Not my super favorite, but quite delicious and totally worth checking out. I hear the ice cream sandwiches are delicious and will have to try that next time.",4.0
"Hands down my favorite pizza place!This place has Grimaldi himself, as well as the original Grimaldi pizza oven, which means everything for a pizza place. The current Grimaldi's has great pizza too, but the wait is much longer and the service is awful. Juliana's feels more local and authentic.",5.0
"Welcome back Patsy! Who would have thought to have you back after so many years at exact the same place? Your pizza, as usually is amazing. I'm also happy about not standing in line anymore as there's finally enough place for everyone with Grimaldi's right next door. I wish though the prices weren't that high. Grimaldi's at its old place was so unique because it offered world class pizza to affordable prices. Anyways, it's still worth it. Love it.",5.0
"You don't want to queue up for 2 hours to go to Grimaldi's? Easy: go to Juliana's, and you'll have a Patsy pizza with only a 10 mn wait (we went on a Sunday at 2pm though - it might be a little bit more crowded for dinner...)There are 10 pizzas, 5 classic ones around 20$ (for a large one - which is meant to serve 2) and 5 specials around $28 (for the large as well). We took the Special n'1, which was delicious.The service is very nice - the waitresses are quite busy so they are not hoovering by your table (which actually feels quite overwhelming for a European!), but they are very attentive to your every needs. The owner's wife, Carol, greets everyone and even cleared out our table - I hope I'll be as passionate in my 80s!",4.0
"I went to NYC recently, and I had a pizza fix that needed to be fulfilled. My friend suggested that we go to Juliana's and boy was she right! This place is owned by the original owners of Grimaldi's and is awesome!!! We ordered the small margarita pizza and shared, which yielded left overs as well! The crust was nice and thin crispy on the crust and just a tad soft at the center, the sauce was great, and they didn't spread the cheese all over the pizza, they used fresh balls of mozzarella cheese so there were nice pockets of cheese! Their red pepper flakes were fresh, and actually spicy! This place is pretty cheap for pizza and it has great ambiance! It actually feels like walking into a restaurant along the venice canals very rustic and rowdy! Cheers! Come here instead of Grimaldi's, it a tourist attraction, but this place is the real deal.",4.0

"Pizza is mediocre... I'd compare it to DiGiorno's if anything.  Don't believe me?  ... see for yourself.  Oh, and don't bother to try and expect you can order take-out... seems Juliana's thinks they can just selectively decide when customers can call and place take-out orders on the day.  As a businessman I understand why they would incorporate such a practice but that kind of inconsistent behavior toward consumers and especially neighborhood regulars is at least to my mind a completely irresponsible business practice and is exactly why they are never included on anyone's top-ten (or more) pizza places in the city.  And why Di Fara's always takes the cake there!  They have made their business solely off the much played up and commercialized spat between them and Grimaldi's.  Hey... it's just pizza.   If you want something special head to Barboncinos in Crown Heights!  They have one item on the menu... PIZZA.  Done right, no fuss and no chip on their shoulder!  Peace, pizza lovers!",1.0

But we met a local on the way, who gave us the tip: skip Grimaldi's and head next door. We have never been more grateful. Juliana's is simply amazing. We had the classic Margherita, as this is in our view the best way to truly test a pizza place. It was outstanding. Crispy base, delicious sauce and fresh and beautiful mozzarella. We have been trying for years to find a pizza that came close to the ""best in the world"" we had in Naples. This did it, without question. For your reference, the other pizza places we tried were Lombardi's and Johns on Bleeker. Both absolute paled in comparison - in fact, there is simply no comparison.

"So I had sky high hopes from Julianas, all the fame that comes with Mr Grimaldi and all that jazz...so were they fulfilled? We ordered the Arugula salad with goat cheese & walnuts and it was absolutely delightful on a humid summer day. Crispy, light and the goat cheese was divine. The star of the meal was the classic Margherita pizza. I mean you really can't go wrong with a Grimaldi Margherita pizza! The pizza was good, very fresh and had all the right flavors, but to be honest, I would have prefered a crispier crust. It was just getting to the right degree of crispness when it was served to us. Of the two, the salad came out a clear winner. Umm, not such a big deal, but then we were under the legendary roof of pizza connoisseur Mr Grimaldi. Meanwhile, the service was excellent, there was no line, the restaurant had a nice buzz, and yes Mr Grimaldi was manning the floor himself. I'm going with 3.5 stars for this outing.",3.0
"Best Pizza Ever! I have never tasted pizza this good anywhere else: Toronto, British Colombia, San Francisco, Chicago (yes even Chicago).The Margarita with Sausage was INSANE!!Somewhat of a long line, but worth the wait. The only small complaint I have is with one of the waiters. Asked him about eggs in the Cannoli (for an allergy), and he came back quickly without actually checking with the Chefs claiming that there is eggs in there. Noticing this, I asked another waiter to check for eggs, and he came back saying no. He assured me no eggs. I tried out the Cannoli, no allergic reaction!!But the Pizza was soo good.",5.0
"We came here after a romantic stroll on the Bridge. We walked right into the establishment, no wait compared to grimaldis next door. We knew the scoop that the legendary oven and recipe were at this place! Our waiter actually never came to our table, so we had to hail someone down. Once the waiter knew he was at our table, service was prompt. There were 6 of us, and we ordered 3 large pies: Margherita Pizza , #2 (cherry tomato, bufala mozzarella, garlic and sea salt ) and #4 (tomato, mozzarella, arugula and prosciutto). Margherita and #2 were crowd favorites. There were no slices left over. We were stuffed, but we had done a lot of touring earlier that day so our appetites were heightened.When we got the bill, we split it via 3 cards. Luckily we noticed that we were SEVERELY overcharged: about $40 per card...which made $120 bill total. Our real bill was around $80. Not cool not cool. Sans the service in beginning and bill mishap, I would give 4 stars. They have to work out the kinks:)",3.0
"I don't get it... I am from NJ and love a thin, crisp crust.  This crust was thin... but soggy.  Could not hold the weight of the skimpy toppings.  Suggestion... possibly, get it to go and re-heat in oven at home to get the crust nice and crisp.  Any who... just not a huge fan and way too many better (to my liking) pizza joints in the city or.... across the river in Jersey.  Heyyyy-O! Don't hate!",3.0
"One of the best in NYC. Grimaldis up the block simply does not compare despite having the rights to the namesake. I even noticed they resorted to the lame tactic of putting a sign in front of Juliana's saying ""The 'REAL' Grimaldis up the block.As for the pizza, no matter what you order you can expect it to be perfectly crisp with a delicious slightly sweet sauce. I wouldn't mind drinking a tub of the sauce alone. Then choose whatever toppings you're in the mood for and you're good. The waitress when I was there last time was really hyper which was slightly off putting but it didn't detract from the overall experience. Grimaldi himself also came around and was a extremely friendly and it was great meeting him. Long live Juliana's!",5.0
"I've only been here once, but I wasn't really blown away by the margherita pizza. Very good, but I've had better elsewhere in Westchester and even NJ. Nonetheless, this is a good spot to grab a bite before walking the bridge. Came here on a Monday evening around 6pm, and it was pretty empty.",4.0
"Pizza is mediocre... I'd compare it to DiGiorno's if anything.  Don't believe me?  ... see for yourself.  Oh, and don't bother to try and expect you can order take-out... seems Juliana's thinks they can just selectively decide when customers can call and place take-out orders on the day.  As a businessman I understand why they would incorporate such a practice but that kind of inconsistent behavior toward consumers and especially neighborhood regulars is at least to my mind a completely irresponsible business practice and is exactly why they are never included on anyone's top-ten (or more) pizza places in the city.  And why Di Fara's always takes the cake there!  They have made their business solely off the much played up and commercialized spat between them and Grimaldi's.  Hey... it's just pizza.   If you want something special head to Barboncinos in Crown Heights!  They have one item on the menu... PIZZA.  Done right, no fuss and no chip on their shoulder!  Peace, pizza lovers!",1.0
"Like so many other reviewers, we were on our way to Grimaldi's, to round out what we believed to be our ""top 3 pizza in NY"" comparison. But we met a local on the way, who gave us the tip: skip Grimaldi's and head next door. We have never been more grateful. Juliana's is simply amazing. We had the classic Margherita, as this is in our view the best way to truly test a pizza place. It was outstanding. Crispy base, delicious sauce and fresh and beautiful mozzarella. We have been trying for years to find a pizza that came close to the ""best in the world"" we had in Naples. This did it, without question. For your reference, the other pizza places we tried were Lombardi's and Johns on Bleeker. Both absolute paled in comparison - in fact, there is simply no comparison. Juliana's sets the standard, and we can't wait to go back.",5.0

"This place has quite a history between the owner - Mr. Grimaldi, and his long lost pizzeria next door, ironically carrying  Grimaldi's name. With that said, the pizza is absolutely nothing extraordinary. It is certainly overpriced, and half pizza toppings are charged as full. Personally, Domino's new York style pizza tastes better to me, especially for the price.",3.0
"So I had sky high hopes from Julianas, all the fame that comes with Mr Grimaldi and all that jazz...so were they fulfilled? We ordered the Arugula salad with goat cheese & walnuts and it was absolutely delightful on a humid summer day. Crispy, light and the goat cheese was divine. The star of the meal was the classic Margherita pizza. I mean you really can't go wrong with a Grimaldi Margherita pizza!

"I had been waiting for months for Juliana's to open-- dying to see how The Patsy Grimaldi made his pies in the original coal oven! I came during their first week for lunch and at first was nervous when I saw a line down the block (phew, it was just for Grimaldis)! We went in and were seated immediately. The place itself was completely redone and no longer even slightly resembles how it used to look when Grimaldis was here. It's much more open/spacious and has a more upscale feel. I love that I don't have to rub elbows with my neighbor and can actually hear my dining partner! I must admit, it does feel a little cold-- I guess I had been expecting a more ""homey feel"" but that's just a personal preference. They do accept plastic = AWESOME!The waitstaff were all friendly, but it was the first week so I won't critique the service just yet. Once seated, Patsy  came over to the table to introduce himself and told us he couldn't wait to see how we enjoyed his pies! I was very impressed that he took the time to talk and seemed to generally care about the community's opinion of the restaurant which is in stark contrast to the other restaurants in the area that just move you in and out and only care about tourists (cough, Grimaldis). We went with the small margherita pizza (it was the perfect size to be split with two)-- I always like to try the classic when trying out a new pizza joint. Patsy Grimaldi delivered! The pizza was amazing-- the crust was a bit thicker/more doughy than I had expected but was still light and airy with the perfect amount of charred crust (coal oven, how I love you so!), the sauce was perfect and fresh, the mozzarella was placed in perfect portions. Basically, it was perfect! So perfect, in fact, that I couldn't resist getting another pie to go the next night on my way home for dinner!  Tourists can keep waiting in line for Grimaldis, I'll take the better option at Julianas any day of the week.",5.0
"My coworkers and I ordered take out from this little Brooklyn gem, and we were all blown away by the taste profile and quality of the pizza. We ordered two specialty pies--the No.1 and the No.4.

The No. 4 was also absolutely delicious (especially the prosciutto), although not quite as inventive as the other pie. Prices are steep when compared to surrounding pizza places (specialty pies run around $30 each), but 2 pizzas ended up feeding five of us just fine.

"I loved Juliana's, I really did. Until I got one particular waitress and she turned me off from the whole place forever.Came here on a snowy January day for some delicious coal fire pizza with a friend. I spent days talking Juliana's up. Going in, we knew exactly which two pizzas we were going to order. We were both starving and just wanted to stuff our faces, but the waitress never came. We noticed all the servers around the coal fire oven just talking and gossiping. I was not in the mood to be in a bad mood so I just continued on my conversation with my friend. 15 minutes went by until our server finally came over just to take drink orders. We told her we were ready to order everything. We also asked her if one pizza could come out in front of the other and we would tell her when we wanted the next one. Part of my thought process in this was that people would stare if we had two large pizzas on our tiny table and there nothing I hate more than a gawker. Our first pizza to come out was the number 2, which cherry tomatoes, sea salt, bufala mozzarella, and garlic (see my previous review for that one). Not even before we had our first slice, the second one came out. The waitress neglected to listen to our request. The gawkers were always coming on heavy. The second pizza was the number 4 with tomato, mozzarella, prosciutto, and arugula. This is the one I was really looking forward to as I love all the ingredients. However, when I tried it I was heavily disappointed. First of all, I was under the impression it was a white pizza that had tomatoes on it. Not the case, and I wouldn't have minded, but the tomato sauce was so basic and acidic. When we were finished we waited and waited for the waitress to come clear the table. She walked by us numerous times after we had stopped putting food in our mouth but didn't even stop to ask us if we were done. I would usually flag her down, but this time I was curious to see how long she would really take. We sat there for 25 minutes. TWENTY-FIVE minutes AFTER we were finished. I was astonished. We watched her clear other tables, bring people pizzas and drinks, and even saw the table, who came in while we were eating, order, eat, pay, and leave before we even got the table cleared. I was completely shocked at the utter disrespect and ignorance of this waitress. When we finally did get packed and rang up, I was not in the mood for leaving a tip at all. I'm a huge fan of service. A 3 star restaurant can easily go up to a 4 or even 5 star place for me if the service is impeccable and I know I'm not the only one who feels that way. Unfortunately a 4.5 star restaurant dropped to a 2 star because of one bad apple in the bunch. I hope they reconsider this woman's role in the company.",2.0

Too bad you can't get a 1/2 n 1/2 specialty pizza which is what we wanted. But after a walk over the brooklyn bridge, great stop for pizza. The best? Send me a message and i'll give you my personal opinion.",3.0
Date-night feel.Host in the front door was extremely friendly. He chatted with us while we waited for our seats which helped the time go by.There is a classier feel to this pizzeria. It's more of a place to take a significant other on a casual Wednesday night. Ordered the margarita pie with prosciutto. I LOVE DRY-CURED HAM. Ingredients are fresh and the sauce is just right. Pizza is crisp and thin and charred just slightly.Definitely recommend to anyone. Overall I would have to say I enjoyed Juliana's over Grimaldi's. There's more of a gourmet selection as opposed to that of Grimaldi's.,5.0
"Pizza is so delicious, so flavorful, so filling. It's worth the wait for a table on the weekends. I eat here often and can't get enough. The classic margherita is a favorite.",5.0
"If you're in the area and trying to decide between the white mammoth that sells OK pizza at the cost of three hours of your life and the always fresh, delicious and usually speedy pizza place next door...clearly Juliana's is the correct choice. I've tried both Grimaldi's and Juliana's pizzas and though they are both exceptionally similar in style it just comes down to quality, and Juliana's has it. Each and every time. I've always ordered take out from here and can't speak to the wait staff, but the check out staff is always pleasant and personable on the phone and they call me when my order is ready to pick up. I've started to pity the poor fools waiting in that long line next door. I've even been tempted to yell at them, ""You're in the wrong line!"" but that probably wouldn't be taken to kindly by the people at the front who've been there for hours. I'm almost tempted to give you guys a bad review to keep the lines down but you deserve better than that!",5.0
"My daughter have this place a 5 before she even tried the pizza! The pizza is excellent, skip the long line at Grimadli's & come here where Patsy Grimaldi himself was seating guests. He is charming, even gave my daughter a pen for when she starts school! The pizza is perfectly cooked, with a wonderful taste. We had the red pizza with pepperoni & sweet sausage and a white pizza. The leftovers where carefully packaged up which I appreciated since we were walking around a bit before taking the train home. I love the decor, the acoustics in the restaurant aren't the best so if it is busy night and you are hoping to have an intimate dinner where you can chat this might not be the place. However, come for the food and then walk around DUMBO afterwards for a conversation!",5.0
"Ab.so.lute.ly FABULOUS. Eating pizza in Brooklyn was on my bucket list... and we were going to go to Grimaldi's, but then we learned this WAS the original Grimaldi's. So glad we choose this place. Order the No. 1 if you like white pizza... It is ah.MAAAAAA.zing.",5.0
"Not only was the pizza worth the long wait outside in January, the service was also unbelievably great. We were a group of 16 and the man organizing the seating got us all seated without any grief and the waitresses and waiters were helpful, funny, and so nice. I highly recommend Juliana's!",5.0

Truely incredible pizza!!!  This place is very good and very popular so there may be a wait so you might want to go during slow hours or go put your name on the list and go explore the park right next to it like we did.  We tried 7 pizza places while we were in NYC that came highly recommended by friends and this place was by far the best pizza Ive ever had period!  The staff is the friendliest Ive seen as well bar none.  Our waiter was very chivalrous helping every lady he saw pull their seat out or help them put their jackets on and was just super upbeat and lively.  Truely an experience to be had make sure you try this place!,5.0

"Came on a beautiful Saturday afternoon to find only about 5 parties on line, about a 30 minute wait. The Grimaldi's line looked like it would take 2 hours.The host was very friendly, and came out to keep us posted and find out how many people in each party.We were seated, and after dealing with the really nice host, I was expecting some courteous service inside as well. This was definitely not the case. We were sitting for 20 minutes before a server came over and half-heartedly asked if we were ready. Thanks for not greeting us and asking if we wanted drinks, I guess someone was not trained correctly.We ordered two pies, one margherita, and the other with pepperoni and meatballs. The plain was pretty tasteless, and our meat-za was a bit on the salty side, but we appreciated it more than the plain. The first bite was piping hot, crispy and delicious. But as you keep eating, you realize that it does not keep its texture and really comes short of expectations. The other slices got soggy before we got to go for seconds.Overall, if you want pizza, go to Di Fara's or Lucali's. Grimaldi's is good, but not worth the wait in Brooklyn. Juliana's is average, and if you're in the area and there's no line, then by all means, go for it.",3.0

We literally sat down with a whole pie at Juliana's had a couple slices and went next door for another whole pie.  I have to say that while lacking in ambience at Juliana's it won in every other category.  Best flavor, best crust, best service, best, best, best.",5.0
"Not a bad pie. They renovated the location, making it look more modern & more open. I think the decor is very nice & glad they still have a jukebox. The pizza wasn't so bad.

She was sort of robotic & only asked my fiance` for a refill & not myself. Both drinks we wanted they were out of. They do take credit cards. Another thing that bothered me: on the chalkboard it says what region Patsy's mom is from & the answer is Melfi. Melfi is a city in Italy, not a region.

The base is thin and well done as it should be, and the crust is nice crispy, chewy, AND tasty. Ordered TWO large pizzas using the margherita as the base; one with additional sausage with fennel and sweet onions on one, and additional meatball and shitake mushrooms on the other.

This restaurant is perfect where it situated itself. It is directly next to a famous pizza place where people wait in line all day. For all the people who just want good italian food but do not want to wait this is the place to go. It is a little fancy for where it is and who it attracts but still very nice atmosphere. They have a good menu with classic italian dishes and pizzas. The only thing I think keeping this restaurant from not being GREAT is there seating situation. The tables are too close together and if you come with only 2 people in your party they will sit another party right next to you and its almost like you are at dinner with these people you don't know. It honestly ruined my meal for me because it was so awkward and the waiter has to reach over the other people to give you your tables food and its just awkward all around. I honestly would only consider going back if I had a bigger party and didn't have to be sat next to people I didn't know. Other wise there are plenty of other italian places worth going to.,3.0
"I remembered eating Grimaldi's when I was in high school with my family before it moved to the new building. I remembered that first bite I had with the original margherita pizza and I could still remember that phenomenal taste. I could still remember how fresh and perfect the crust was. The margherita sauce and the mozzarella cheese were amazing and fresh. After that, I haven't been to Grimaldi's that often since I studied abroad to Italy and had an Italian food break from my 3 months of staying in Italy. I wasn't aware that Grimaldi's moved into a new building until about a month ago when I started craving for Grimaldi's pizza in Brooklyn. I tried Grimaldi's pizza (the one next to Juliana's) a month ago and when i tried the pizza again, it didn't taste or feel the same as it did when I ate their pizza during high school. (I know this is a long time ago but I'm pretty sensitive to taste. I like the sensation of eating food where it makes me reminisce the time I had with my family). As I went out, I realized that Juliana's pizza is next door where Grimaldi's pizza originally was.And so... A month later, after taking some time to travel from queens to Brooklyn to eat some pizza, my first bite of Juliana's pizza was like this. It was exactly (if not, actually better) like the pizza I had when I was in high school. I actually started to reminisce the time i enjoyed the original Grimaldi's pizza with my friends and family that i came here with. Their pizza is similar to pizza that was made in Italy. the mozzarella cheese may not be as strong as the cheese in Napoli but the way Juliana's pizza make their crust is still amazing (I would say better than Italy). As an added bonus, they put a lot of basil compared to pizzas in Italy. (In Italy, most pizza restaurants put 1 basil leaf in a pie and it's usually extremely burnt.. ) i ordered the special no. 1 and the original margherita pizza. I'm not too crazy about the special pizza pie. I personally like the original margherita pizza with my own toppings. The Brookie Bridge was a nice idea but I would rather just eat the ice without the fudge. I thought it was a little bit sweet for me. So as a whole.... Juliana's has the best pizza in New York. I don't know the full details about Grimaldi's division from the original building, but if any of you want to try the actual, original Grimaldi's pizza, you need to eat at Juliana's.

"I struggled to give it 2 stars, and the only reason I did was because our waiter tried his best to make up for the lackluster experience.  All I can say is...we should have waited in line for Garibaldi's instead.  The line here was almost the same investment, and boy when you make that investment, you have high hopes that the food will live up to the wait.  Sadly...NOT! After the 30 minute wait in line, we waited another 40 minutes for the pizza. When parties around us (that were seated long after we were) got their food pronto, and we were left hungry...we finally inquired and were told that the kitchen forgot to put our order in.  We had a 12 yr old hungry boy with us, and the cardinal rule of restaurateurs should be...never keep a growing boy waiting. When the food finally came...eh.  hardly worth an hour long wait.  The waiter tried to make it up to us with free sodas....Really?  He said that was all the Mgr would let him do.  Management clearly could care less about their customers.  Sad.   I try to extend every restaurant a 3 strikes rule (being in the hospitality business myself)...benefit of the doubt and all.  But, we'll never be back.Skip it.  You'll be glad you did.",2.0
"After eating at grimaldis over the years, I've grown weary of the brand. When they first sold the pizzeria in the late 90s, no one really knew. The quality was impeccable and it was the best pie around; bar none. Slowly over time that changed. It was still a great pie, but it lost is holy isht factor. The Grimaldi name began sprouting up all over, delivering mediocre results. Scottsdale AZ, Sugar Land TX, Highlands NJ, etc... Each one being a more commercialized mediocre version of the original. When Grimaldis got booted out of their initial location under the bridge, I was initially saddened to hear the news. It was the end of a good run I thought.... But after a trip to try the new grimaldis, I was elated to see the sign letting the world know that Patsy is back at a new restaurant called Juliana's. I had a chance to try the pizza at Juliana's this week and it was excellent. The ingredients were fresh, the crust nice and charred, etc. it hit the spot. The crust is a little thicker, but I was told that Patsy is still tinkering. The restaurant looks like Gordon Ramsey came in and redid the dining area. Nice white walls, new tables, gone is that kitschy feel of the old place. There's even a nice countertop to sit at right in front of the pizza maker so you can get a birds eye view of how the pies are made. It's not all sunshine and kittens though. There were a lot of hiccups throughout the night, and honestly I didn't care. The night I was there, the restaurant was in its 5th night of being open, so I was expecting bumps along the way. There were a lot of issues trying to figure out the POS system in regards to entering orders and swiping credit cards (Yes, they finally take credit cards... No more cash only!) The servers were confused about what they were out of, and there was a lot of confusion about what time they were closing. People were told on the phone they were open and when they came in they were informed they were closed. They were able to order and eat. There was confusion as to whether my pie was to stay or to go... Etc. All of these are hiccups that will correct themselves with time. When yo go, enjoy the pizza, and know that a pizza icon is back doing what we he does best! Just be patient with everything else!",5.0
"Came here last week on a recommendation from a local friend and . . . wow.  Coal fired baking imparts a slight smokey flavor, the buffalo cheese is tremendous, my pie had white truffle, seriously legit pancetta, and I think some magic or something.  Great service and atmosphere tops it all off.",5.0
"Stopped here after i realized they don't serve slices at Grimaldis. Well, they don't serve slices here at Julianna's either.

It was a little too much for me as I was trying to save room to for a few bites at an Elite event down the street. The pizza came out piping hot and perfectly crusty. I ate my crust. I don't know if it was the best pizza I ever had but it was definitely up there and the staff was so nice I had to write a review. The decor was super cute. Great place for a casual date.",4.0
Pizza is really good but not amazing. Price is good for the amount of pizza you get.But be prepared to get overcharged for the extras.  A small 8 oz pellegrino-- that will be $4! Be prepared to really nurse that drink so you can get your money's worth. Add on a few extra toppings and that'll be another $10+. And even if you want that topping on half of the pizza? Too bad. That'll still be $10. I hate places that overcharge for the little things that could really make the difference between a 3 star ann 5 star rating.,3.0
"This is the original owner of Grimaldi's next door. If you like thin and crispy crust, this is the best brick oven pizzeria in NYC. We got to meet Patsy Grimaldi - the owner who was really nice. The staff are also very friendly. The only reason I am not giving them a 5 star is because they didn't use real tomatoes in their signature margherita pizza. They used canned tomato sauce. It was good but i've had it somewhere else and at home where real tomatoes are used and it really makes a difference. We asked the waiter but he just said No and that it wasn't even an option. If you want to see the guys making your pizza, you gotta sit at the bar.  End of December to New Year's - this place is a zoo! So make sure you call ahead to find out if there is a wait time if you don't wanna wait in line out in the cold. You could be in line for up to two hours if you come in the New Year's season.",4.0
"We were standing in line for the Grimaldi Pizzaria but the line was so long. Somebody that passed by said this place was better since theyr right next to each other and true enough, the real Grimaldi was said to own this place. They sold the name Grimaldi to former customer and Juliana their new restorant was named after his mom :) the story worked up my appetite. Their thin crust small Pizza taste good :) good ambiance and service.",4.0
"It is so strange to me that Juliana's, while packed during my visit, has no line while the Grimaldi's next door always has a stream of people hovering outside. Is it because Grimaldi's is in a guidebook whereas Juliana's is not?The place is lovely, glowing and gracious with the requisite wood-burning oven glowing in the background and delicious pizza smells wafting through the air. The service was a bit spotty, given that our waiter clearly was still around high school/early college age, but the margarita pie was a winner.",4.0
Much better than the bullies next door at Grimaldi's. Save yourself the mediocre pizza and wait. Come here if you don't want to look like a damn fool waiting in that preposterous Grimaldi's line.,5.0
Great pizza and great service. Reasonable price and a large pizza is enough for two people.,4.0
"I struggled to give it 2 stars, and the only reason I did was because our waiter tried his best to make up for the lackluster experience.  All I can say is...we should have waited in line for Garibaldi's instead.  The line here was almost the same investment, and boy when you make that investment, you have high hopes that the food will live up to the wait.  Sadly...NOT! After the 30 minute wait in line, we waited another 40 minutes for the pizza. When parties around us (that were seated long after we were) got their food pronto, and we were left hungry...we finally inquired and were told that the kitchen forgot to put our order in.  We had a 12 yr old hungry boy with us, and the cardinal rule of restaurateurs should be...never keep a growing boy waiting. When the food finally came...eh.  hardly worth an hour long wait.  The waiter tried to make it up to us with free sodas....Really?  He said that was all the Mgr would let him do.  Management clearly could care less about their customers.  Sad.   I try to extend every restaurant a 3 strikes rule (being in the hospitality business myself)...benefit of the doubt and all.  But, we'll never be back.Skip it.  You'll be glad you did.",2.0
"After eating at grimaldis over the years, I've grown weary of the brand. When they first sold the pizzeria in the late 90s, no one really knew. The quality was impeccable and it was the best pie around; bar none. Slowly over time that changed. It was still a great pie, but it lost is holy isht factor. The Grimaldi name began sprouting up all over, delivering mediocre results. Scottsdale AZ, Sugar Land TX, Highlands NJ, etc... Each one being a more commercialized mediocre version of the original. When Grimaldis got booted out of their initial location under the bridge, I was initially saddened to hear the news. It was the end of a good run I thought.... But after a trip to try the new grimaldis, I was elated to see the sign letting the world know that Patsy is back at a new restaurant called Juliana's. I had a chance to try the pizza at Juliana's this week and it was excellent. The ingredients were fresh, the crust nice and charred, etc. it hit the spot. The crust is a little thicker, but I was told that Patsy is still tinkering. The restaurant looks like Gordon Ramsey came in and redid the dining area. Nice white walls, new tables, gone is that kitschy feel of the old place. There's even a nice countertop to sit at right in front of the pizza maker so you can get a birds eye view of how the pies are made. It's not all sunshine and kittens though. There were a lot of hiccups throughout the night, and honestly I didn't care. The night I was there, the restaurant was in its 5th night of being open, so I was expecting bumps along the way. There were a lot of issues trying to figure out the POS system in regards to entering orders and swiping credit cards (Yes, they finally take credit cards... No more cash only!) The servers were confused about what they were out of, and there was a lot of confusion about what time they were closing. People were told on the phone they were open and when they came in they were informed they were closed. They were able to order and eat. There was confusion as to whether my pie was to stay or to go... Etc. All of these are hiccups that will correct themselves with time. When yo go, enjoy the pizza, and know that a pizza icon is back doing what we he does best! Just be patient with everything else!",5.0
"Came here last week on a recommendation from a local friend and . . . wow.  Coal fired baking imparts a slight smokey flavor, the buffalo cheese is tremendous, my pie had white truffle, seriously legit pancetta, and I think some magic or something.  Great service and atmosphere tops it all off.",5.0

"Grimaldi's moved. Juliana totally revamped the place and then opened a new pizza restaurant. They kept the same oven, but setting foot in this place you can hardly believe it used to be Grimaldi's. It's very clean, which I appreciate, and you are greeted by Juliana herself when you walk in. The wall provides a bit of context for the NYC pizza wars and for the history of many famous NYC pizza shops. As for the pizza, it was fantastic.

This is by far the best Pizza spot in NYC.Its lack of outright fame make its an easy place to walk in and grab a tableThe constant presence of Founder Patsy Grimaldi a NYC pizza godfather makes this a unique place to eat- he always walks around the restaurant asking patrons about their experience and generally shooting the shit with them.The pizza- well I've been here over 5 times and its incredible. Better than Grimaldi's next store or Lombardi's in Little Italy. This is a quintessential NY experience.,5.0
"Actually, I cant give an honest review because I never got served. I arrived last night and yes the place is busy. We waited 25 minutes outside and 10 minutes to place our order. We sat down with another couple and ordered the exact same pizza! They were served immediately and we waited, waited and waited and watched everyone around us eat. I asked our server twice what was going on, but he was too busy for us. WE JUST WALKED OUT. Everyone saw our disgust except for the establishment. Never again",1.0

I miss the original look (a little grime and checkered table cloths), but I support whatever it takes for Patsy and Carol to reclaim their place as the First Family of Pizza. blogs.villagevoice.com/f…",5.0
"We ordered a #1.  The taste of pizza was good, however, the pizza was lukewarm which was disappointing. Price $30+ for a large pizza was quite high for type and volume of food.",3.0
"I came here on Saturday night around 10:00.  No wait!  Woop woop!  We were greeted with a smile and immediately seated at a cozy table in the back.  Within 2 minutes, our server greeted us enthusiastically with menus.  He returned quickly for our order.  There were two of us so we weren't sure which size to get, he was quick to tell us a small would be plenty.Our drinks came immediately followed just 10 minutes later by the glorious margherita pie.  Our waiter's advice was dead on - Small pie was perfect for a pair.  The crust was just crunchy enough, not too soft or mushy but not too brown on bottom either.  Everything was amazing.  Also they updated the space so it's eons brighter and more inviting than when it was Grimaldi's.Highly recommend for quality service and food!",5.0
shhhh!  you guys!!  don't let the secret out!  let the tourists wait in line for 2 hours for a slice while we enjoy some REAL Grimaldi heaven!suckers.,5.0
"Here is my review.YES.Go here, you will not be disappointed.  Every time I have friends visit from out of town, I bring them here.  If they want the best NY Pizza then Juliana's is the place to go!",5.0
"Good pizza. Was I blown away? No. But it was definitely good. Nice place: friendly, comfortable atmosphere, though not all that accommodating. For instance, one member of our party really wanted a side of meatballs. But for some reason, they couldn't (or wouldn't) sell them to him unless they were on a pizza. Perhaps caught up a bit too much in themselves. Or perhaps there was a really solid, legitimate reason behind their refusal. Who knows. But, like I said, good pizza. Worth a visit if there isn't too much of a wait.",4.0
"Great Grimaldi's pizza without the Grimaldi's wait next door. Went with Arugula salad with goat cheese and walnuts. You can't go wrong with that combination! For the pizza, we shared a Margherita. Pizza and service were very good. Skip the line at Grimaldi's and stop in Juliana's.",4.0
"I've worked at a ""NY Style"" pizza place for over 8 years and this was hands down the best pizza I've ever tasted.",5.0
Decent pizza. We had the number 1 and the marghareta.  Definitely top quality. Don't order the desserts they're nothing special.  The ice cream cookie sandwich was nothing great.  Calzone was ok. If I could give 3.5 stars I would.,3.0
"Still so freaking good. Cannot recommend it enough! Forget Grimaldi's, go to Juliana's. Get a pizza, beer and a  Brookie Bridge with raspberry ice cream. It will change your life.",5.0
"The pizza here is quite amazing--fresh ingredients, nice thin crust, and not overly greasy. In addition, the wait time is much shorter than the pizza place next door.I generally steer away from pizza joints, but I am so glad we ended up going to this one. To start, we had the arugula salad with goat cheese and walnuts. Pizza joints are quite notorious for making salads with bad ingredients, but this one was very fresh. I only wished they served more for the large. We had a sausage pizza and requested half the pie to be made without meat. The non-meat portion was still delicious. For dessert, we had brookies, brownie cookies. They were a delicious option for the lactose intolerant.",5.0
"After a lot of back and forth between going to Grimaldis or Juliana's, we landed at Juliana's and we're glad we did.Once you've made it past the enormous wait that is offset by the quick walk down to look at Manhattan across the East River and the interesting newspaper reviews of the grudge match between Grimaldis and Juliana's, you are rewarded with a lively and yet elegant atmosphere in the restaurant.  I'm not sure how the staff fits so many people in but it didn't feel overly crowded.  The focal point of the restaurant is most certainly the single coal-fired oven at the center back of the restaurant and the continual flurry of activity from the white t-shirt clad pizza artisans.The pie was delicious.  We had a margharita and a meat-lover and both were wonderful.  The crust was perfectly crispy with a chewy edge and has a little bit of a different taste, I'm guessing from using the coal instead of wood.I would definitely recommend the trip over to DUMBO to visit Juliana's.And if you are ever in the Atlanta, GA area, do not miss out on Antico Pizza Napoletana.  While I really liked Juliana's pie, Anticos margharita and San Generaos pies still win in my book.  There are a few critical differences, but I think in the end it finally comes down to the taste of the sauce and on that front Anticos wins.",4.0
"The first time I went to NYC a few months ago, I was told I had to try Grimaldi's.  So my host and I made the trip to Grimaldi's on a Saturday morning/early afternoon.  We got there, and of course, the line was already down the sidewalk, almost past Juliana's.  I noticed a big poster article in Juliana's window mentioning that it was owned by the Patsy Grimaldi's and faced with an hour-long wait next door at Grimaldi's, we decided to chance it on Juliana's (where there was no line, no wait).  Luckily, the gamble paid off.  The pizza was excellent.  Thin, crispy crust, nice sauce. AND they take cards unlike their friends next door.By the time I got out, there was a line out the door for Juliana's so I guess the secret got out.  If you want to try Grimaldi's without waiting Grimaldi times and/or you want the convenience of being able to use your credit card, just go to Juliana's next door.I'd also like to add that I ended up trying Grimaldi's this week, and while it was good, I recall that Juliana's was great.",4.0

"Wow. I really can't believe how disappointed I was in this place.  It was just very disappointing to me considering the history they claim and the write-ups and reviews. I came here expecting tradition NYC pizza, on the same levels as Totonno's, Grimaldi's and Lombardi's...the old school pizza places...and this wasn't even close.  I think my local hole in the wall pizza place is actually better, and a better representation, of what NYC pizza is.  I'm actually kind of sad that a tourist may try this place and get the impression that this is what NYC pizza is - it's not.  Not even close.  It's not even good pizza...but I'm getting ahead of myself.  Let start from the beginning...First off, they are disorganized.  People didn't know to wait outside or go inside to be seated. Especially when there wasn't a line. (if you've gone recently you'd see there's a really long line in front of Grimaldi's and a short to no line in front of this place.  That tells you a lot.)  Then, inside, they seemed confused on where to seat you.  We, my girlfriend and I, were lead around the place before being seated near the kitchen when there were open seats we passed by.  It's not a problem really but, c'mon, you've been open for months.  These issues shouldn't exist at this point.Then there's the upsell.  We ordered a salad. ""You don't want the walnuts and cheese?"" A $3 increase.  We ordered the classic Margherita, what we normally get when we want to check out how good a pizza place is, and we get ""No toppings?""  Up to $6 a topping depending on what you get.   We ask for water.  ""You guys don't want drinks?""  Ugh.  It's like they have to get you for all you're worth now cause they know you're not coming back after trying the pizza.And their timing is terrible.  We're lucky, we were just finishing up our salads when the pizza came out.  The couple next to us, not so lucky.  Their salad came out immediately followed by the pizza.  Now this couple has to figure out if they should continue eating the salad, their starter, and let the pizza get cold or eat the pizza and ignore the nice salad they ordered to START their meal with...WTF you know?Now onto the classic Margherita...it was just bland and flavorless.  The crust isn't a traditional NYC crust with that nice crunch and snap...instead it's ""pillowy"".  More like a Neapolitan pie, which is fine, I've had plenty of really good Neapolitan pies, but most of those weren't bland and flavorless.  This pie...there seemed to be a distinct lack of seasoning.  All you got was bland cheese, bland tomato sauce over pillowy dough.  It never came together to elevate those ingredients to ""pizza"" or, at least, good pizza.  I really can't describe it - because it's so nondescript.  There were no qualities that stood out.  It wasn't even salty - and at some point I was wishing it was overly salty because, at the very least, it would add flavor to this pie.  It's seriously one of the most bland and boring pizzas I've ever had - and I eat a lot of pizzas. And, of course, the minute you're done they take the plates away and drop the check down.  Well at least they didn't try to sell me dessert - I guess that's a positive right?",1.0
"Pretty disappointing. Pretty average tasting, there's definitely better places around here. Came here with a group of 7 and everyone agreed it was nothing special. Service & staff are very cold. They put about 2 pieces of basil on our margherita pizza & when we asked for extra basil on the side, they said they can't give us any for whatever odd reason. So we ordered extra basil on the next pizza & they put about 3 pieces. Maybe basil is a rare item around here? Wouldn't really come here again.",3.0
Juliana's serves the best caesar salad I've had in a looong while.  And the pizza is delicious - very similar to the pizza served at Grimaldi's.,4.0
"So I've now tried Juliana's twice..........  Last night we went for the second time, after waiting outside for a table for 20 minutes (not complaining, I knew what we were in for) we were seated inside.  We were a party of 4, and ordered a plain margarita pizza and calzone, no toppings, easy order, right?  Then the wait really started.  45 minutes go by and no food, we start to see parties seated after us getting their food, and confused waiters trying to serve food to the wrong tables.  We finally mention this to our waiter and he goes to check and says they just put the pizza's in the oven......  no apologies for the wait at all............The calzone arrives first, two of us grab the ends and dig in, we are starving.  My husband grabs a middle piece and discovers cold ricotta and basically no melted cheese at all.  When the waiter bring the pizza over, my husband mentions the cold calzone and they say they'll remake us a small one, not a large like we ordered, since we've already eaten some......  whatever.  Now to the pizza, not pipping hot (what is that 900 degree oven doing?) and dense crust with acidic sauce..........  Major letdown, but starvation takes over and we chip away at the pizza........Calzone #2 arrives and it's the same cold ricotta, we mention this to a different waiter and he says that is strange, and gets a manager to walk over.  The manager very rudely says that they've now made it twice, they're not doing it again and he'll ask the pizza guys if that is how it's supposed to be (shouldn't you know this?  and who serves cold cheese calzone??).  He comes back to say that this is how it is supposed to be and they don't get any complaints, they take it off of our bill, but still no apology.  We finally get the check and quickly pay, and as we're walking out, we get a sarcastic sorry from the hostess (who I believe is one of the owners).  Needless to say, we won't be back, and feel like this place is taking advantage of the fact they are in tourist central and can afford to serve bad food with bad service.  Sad that the pizza destination in tourist brooklyn is a sad excuse for food.  Do yourself a favor and go ANYWHERE else!!",1.0
Amazing!! Was a little nervous when I came here and found the restaurant with a different name.  We ALMOST went next door but thankfully read the news article on the door on the name change (phew)!  We got there right at 11:30 when they opened on Saturday-- THANKFULLY as it became crowded PRETTY QUICKLY!  We ordered the goat cheese and sausage on a margherita pizza.  It was perfect!  Friendly and quick service. Definitely a must stop on your pizza crawl of NY! =) PLUS the view at the bottom of the street (under the Brooklyn Bridge) is my favorite view of the city! A win win!,5.0

"This is probably the best pizza I've had outside of Italy. Frankly, it's the only place where I've had pizza that tasted exactly like it did in Naples. To begin with, we have to talk about this place's history and its owner, Patsy Grimaldi. Yes...that Grimaldi. The 80 year old Patsy opened the famous Grimaldi's next door and actual sold it off to take a break. Just last year, he decided to come back to the Pizza-making biz and opened Juliana's, named after his mother. This amazing owner still runs the front and greets old customers. Patsy had the temerity to open his new shop right next door to his old shop, practically starting a pizza war. (There's been a spat of bad blood between Patsy and the current owner of Grimaldi's, and the current owner even tried to get an injunction to block the opening of Juliana's)The pizza itself ranges from the traditional margherita to fancier creations with interesting toppings like truffle oil and broccoli rabe. A few friends and I split a large Margherita (the most Italian and traditional pie: basil, tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese) and the No. 4 (Tomatoless pie: sausage, mozzarella cheese, broccoli rabe, garlic.) Both were amazing. The sauceless pizza sounds strange, but it really brought out the flavor of the meat and the rabe. The margherita was simply divine and a great example of how less is more. Pizza can really just be 4 components and still be perfect. If you're smart, you'll want to come to Juliana's. The lines are shorter, the service nicer, and the pizza just frankly better.",5.0

Patsy had the temerity to open his new shop right next door to his old shop, practically starting a pizza war. (There's been a spat of bad blood between Patsy and the current owner of Grimaldi's, and the current owner even tried to get an injunction to block the opening of Juliana's)The pizza itself ranges from the traditional margherita to fancier creations with interesting toppings like truffle oil and broccoli rabe. A few friends and I split a large Margherita (the most Italian and traditional pie: basil, tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese) and the No. 4 (Tomatoless pie: sausage, mozzarella cheese, broccoli rabe, garlic.) Both were amazing. The sauceless pizza sounds strange, but it really brought out the flavor of the meat and the rabe. The margherita was simply divine and a great example of how less is more. Pizza can really just be 4 components and still be perfect. If you're smart, you'll want to come to Juliana's. The lines are shorter, the service nicer, and the pizza just frankly better.",5.0
"I will always go to Brooklyn for Julianna's pizza when visiting NYC.  I had lots of pizza over the years but when my friend took me here I said 'this is what NY pizza should taste like'. The pizza you crave in your dreams when you are thinking of NY. Light, thin and delicious. It looks so simple to make yet it's a wonder how they make it the best pizza and so many others can't come close.",5.0
"Why wait on line for Grimaldi's when Juliana's is right around the corner? The pizza here is on point, arguably just as good as Grimaldi's (if not better). The crust is killer and their specialty pies sound heavenly. I tried the specialty pie with pancetta and it did not disappoint - fresh cheese and truffle oil, what's not to love? Good service and friendly owners were a bonus. I hope this secret stays under wraps, for my sake.",4.0
"I waited for over a year for this place to open. How exciting, to be eating the real Patsy Grimaldi's pizza!! Any disappointment? No. I felt just joy eating the entire pie by myself. That was the first time and each subsequent time has had the same feelings attached. 1. Delicious! 2. I should share this but hell no, mine mine mine 3. Might need to go to the gym... or sleep off the food coma.SO GOOD. (perhaps try not to be as greedy as me?)",5.0
"LOVE LOVE LOVE the pizza here! This IS the original Grimaldi's, as it is run by Patsy himself. Don't be fooled by that long line at Grimaldi's on the corner, that place is a shame. It's a shame that tourists who don't know any better spend hours in that line. The pizza is super fluffy, light and not one bit oily! I reccommend everything but my favorite is the sweet sausage. Their salad is great and enough for 2 or 3 to share. You cant leave without trying Carol's canoli (Patsy's wife). Its simple but simply the best canoli EVER. Go, I mean run to Juliana's, you'll be happy you did :)",4.0

"Pizza in New York. It's something special. We were in line to eat at Grimaldi's because we'd read about the reputation it has for some of the best pizza in NY area.

Basically, everyone waits outside until a table is free, then he lets you in. He runs a tight ship! However, as I was using the restroom, my boyfriend was discovering what really happened with Grimaldi's and the one just next door, Juliana's. It appears a bit of a family mess happened and the one next door (Juliana's) came to back to stake their claim in the family business. So, seeing that there was no line at Juliana's and being that we'd just walked all the way from the NYC side of the Brooklyn Bridge on a cold evening, the wait looked to be just a bit much. We entered and it had a nice feel to it. Good Sinatra music (later Beach Boys), a nice big oven towards the back. The seats were a little close but in the big city, you can't ask for a lot of space. Real estate isn't cheap here! So, you're gonna have to elbow it! Service was fine and friendly. We had ample amounts of water to drink down the pizza. The pizza was wonderful.

"I'm really not here to take away from all the good reviews. The pizza here is good. I like my pizza more on the crispy side and I'm very picky on sauce. I just feel most of the 5 star reviews are coming from tourists who perhaps live in areas without authentic Italian pizza. I grew up in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn surrounded by some of the best Italian pizza shops and bakeries in NY. Granted most of the old places are gone so this place moves up the chain but you can't compare it to Di Fara, Totonno, Joe and Pats, Deninio, L&B Spumoni, Peter Pizza on 80th off Stillwell Avenue in Brooklyn (which in my opinion is the most hidden gem in all of Brooklyn) or John's. All those aforementioned pizza joints are still in business. Those places get 5 stars in my book. Like I said, the pizza is good, service is decent, but 5 stars is a stretch to me. There's one last issue and I think only my Italian friends can empathize with me on this. The people making the pizza behind the counter here are not Italian. You say who cares? I do. In most authentic Italian restaurants, the owners themselves make the pizza. They may have help, but if you check out Di Fara or Totonno for example, only the members of the family are making the pizza. Its that Italian touch that makes all the difference.",3.0

Restaurant is a little crammed and the hostess didn't seem to know what she was doing as she kept giving out conflicting wait times and pulling groups from the back of the line past people waiting much longer. Food, especially the Margherita pizza, was 5 stars, but hostess took it down at least one for us.",4.0
"WOW! Probably the best pizza I've ever had. Granted I've never been to Grimaldi's, but really this place was amazing. I should note that Grimaldi's was uninviting anyway. They only accept cash, looks like an old and grungy establishment with a line around the block to get in.Juliana is very quaint and fresh. It's a new place and you can tell. They take cards and provide amazing service with no wait. I even got a free cannoli (amazing btw!) when we came here.",5.0
I came here to give it a try since I've been to Grimaldi's a couple of times already. They renovated the whole place and it looks really nice. But we are here for the pie's. My buddy and I ordered a pie with pepperoni and it tastes just like Grimaldi's to me. Both places are just as good.,4.0

"Came here on a Friday evening around 8ish with a party of 3 and we got a nice corner table facing the rest of the restaurant (love that French-ish style of sitting).  We had 1 large #1 pizza special and 1 small Margherita pizza-more than enough for 3 people. Both pizzas were delicious and we couldnt help but shovel it all down. Probably could have stopped after 3 slices but NOPE-had 4 and a half..The pancetta on the #1 Pizza special tasted so good and the scallions were an interesting and unexpected touch to the slice. If I make it back to brooklyn heights I probably want to try the pizza with salmon on it-quite a unique take on pizza toppings there.The only issue was having them split the check and also not allowing for any modifications on the pizza (my friend is a vegetarian so we wanted to take off the pancetta from half the pizza). Other than that, pretty pleasant experience, friendly staff!",4.0
"I'm really not here to take away from all the good reviews. The pizza here is good. I like my pizza more on the crispy side and I'm very picky on sauce. I just feel most of the 5 star reviews are coming from tourists who perhaps live in areas without authentic Italian pizza. I grew up in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn surrounded by some of the best Italian pizza shops and bakeries in NY. Granted most of the old places are gone so this place moves up the chain but you can't compare it to Di Fara, Totonno, Joe and Pats, Deninio, L&B Spumoni, Peter Pizza on 80th off Stillwell Avenue in Brooklyn (which in my opinion is the most hidden gem in all of Brooklyn) or John's. All those aforementioned pizza joints are still in business. Those places get 5 stars in my book. Like I said, the pizza is good, service is decent, but 5 stars is a stretch to me. There's one last issue and I think only my Italian friends can empathize with me on this. The people making the pizza behind the counter here are not Italian. You say who cares? I do. In most authentic Italian restaurants, the owners themselves make the pizza. They may have help, but if you check out Di Fara or Totonno for example, only the members of the family are making the pizza. Its that Italian touch that makes all the difference.",3.0

"A couple pizza-loving colleagues and I finally made the trip across the bridge to try this place out after work last night. We came with the sole intent of going to Juliana's, and it was absolutely amazing. If ever in the neighborhood, I will never choose Grimaldi's or Ignazio's (which is always forgotten but also very good) over Juliana's.We got a small margherita and a large pie with arugula, prosciutto, and mushrooms. Both were fantastic. I'm a purist and always favor the margherita but the prosciutto was VERY good - rather thick and not too salty. The crust was nice and chewy, a tiny bit thicker than I expected, but lightly crispy on the bottom. The sauce is super fresh and amazing - up there with the very best I've had, and still very noticeable despite the above-average mozzarella coverage. The basil was fresh and plentiful as well.While eating we were talking about how spoiled we are in New York to be eating some of the very best pizza of our lives - better pizza than 99% of the humanity will ever experience - and critiquing it rather than just shutting up and enjoying. I think we wished the crust was a little more charred on the bottom (the large pie was a little nicer than the small in this regard) but other than that we were extraordinarily satisfied.The decor is nice, jukebox a great touch (although it didn't seem to read any of the bills people were trying to use), and the room feels very spacious and nice - especially compared to last time I was there when it was still Grimaldi's! They do a great job of showcasing the coal oven in back which I thought was pretty cool.Our waiter, David, was great and very friendly, although I think we did actually order two small pies and got one large by mistake (easily devoured so no problem). At one point during the meal Patsy Grimaldi himself came over to ask how things were. Honestly, I'm a pizza nerd, but that's way up there on my list of  NYC celebrity sightings. Awesome too because he was a sweetheart and clearly very involved and passionate about the place.For the record, since every other review seems to mention it, neither Juliana's or Grimaldi's had a line at the time. But anyone who waits in line for Grimaldi's is now a dope in my book.",5.0

"I walked in here a day after a snowstorm, tracking slush into the restaurant, and struggling with all the camera stuff I had on me: a camera bag and three separate cameras, plus an umbrella.

They gave me a moment to get out of my coat and hat, and to get my crap organized. I was brought a menu and I went with the #4. The service here was excellent. Not only was the wait staff on point, they were friendly. My server happened to like photography, so we would chat about cameras between guests. Ok, so there's a little bias there, you say? Well other people did stop by to check on me, and were equally chatty and personable. Even Carol Grimaldi herself came to see if I enjoyed the pie, made small talk, and cleared the table when I was done.The pizza itself was great, a good crust that has the right texture.

I ordered a small Margarita/Pepperoni to split in half with my cousin. I ate ALL of my half (4 medium slices compared to the typical large ones you get at the usual pizza joints)--I never eat that much pizza in one sitting! Usually by the 2nd slice I'm feeling very full. However, this pizza is cooked in a brick-oven, it's thin crust, and the ingredients not only looked but tasted so fresh!! The sauce was light, there wasn't a cheese overload (which is usually what I prefer) and the pepperoni were small circles. It was so good, I will definitely be going back. For the small, we each paid $10, which may seem a bit pricey, but SO worth it!! Also, the owner was walking throughout and at one point stood out between the tables and tossed pizza dough to one of the cooks! (The children watching were in complete amazement.)

"Great Pizza and staff except for manager. Place was cold. Asked for ac to be turned down but was refused. Pizza got cold real quick. Saw Patsy outside later. Was real nice and told his manager outside who had a real attitude and just said "" yea right""  So even though pizza is good I wont be back as I like my pizza hot and don't like nasty managersO yea the place wrote on my FB review that NY summers are really hot. Well I am from NY and there is a thing on ACs now called climate control",4.0

"Juliana's Pizza was a nice surprise.   Handpicked by my 7yr old cousin who was caving pizza.  We were immediately greeted by a mature, friendly host in a family-styled space.  Juliana's dining crowd is tab loud for my liking.  Our server ,Monica, was kid-friendly and engaging.  Since Mr. 7 yr old has simple tastebuds, our server offered us 1/2 Margherita & 1/2 Marinara pizza - it was perfect & the best of both worlds.  Although, a crowd awaiting tables started to gathered, we are not rushed. Bookmarked for a next visit.",4.0
"I live around the corner, for what its worth.  We have some pretty great pizza options and I love the guys at Front St and Ignazio's has a good pie, but Juliana's is by far the best.  Quality of the pizza is perfect!  The staff is awesome and treat you like royalty.  Last time I was there, I took my daughter and we had the best lunch ever.. down to the manager running down the street to give us our doggy bag we left behind!  Love these guys!  I hope no one reads this so the lines don't get too long!",5.0
"The best pizza I've ever had, hands down.Don't get toppings. This pizza is best had on its own, just the plain Margherita.Very reasonably priced. Great, friendly, speedy service.Nice ambiance; the music playing from the jukebox was great.",5.0
"I called for pickup on the first day this restaurant opened. True to form, there is no delivery, but they do accept credit cards now! Although some restaurants need time to get into the swing of things with their new business and customers, Juliana's has the experience of 20+ years next to a brick oven via its owners Patsy and Carol Grimaldi. No warm up needed here! After watching the construction go on for months, with the news articles of the Grimaldi controversy taped in the brown-papered windows, I've been anticipating this slice like you couldn't believe! Basically, I've been drooling on my shoes every-time I walk by --and I was not disappointed.As a local, I've been fed up with the hype and lines of tourists at Grimaldi's for years, and with Ignacio's temporarily closed (thanks Sandy) there had been a pizza void in my life. This is the perfect slice of thin crust!When I was there waiting for my pickup, Patsy Grimaldi himself was making a Calzone. If he wants it done right, he does it himself! I'm so happy to have them back!",5.0
"This blows Patsy's and Grimaldi's out of the water and without the Grimaldi wait. This, along with Numero 28, are my go to choices for pizza in the city. Total tab after tax but before tip was $45 for a large half pepperoni/half cheese, salad (just average) and 2 sodas.",4.0
"Have been here twice now.  First time, the service was excellent at lunch.  Second time, our waiter was a little surly at dinner.  But both times, the host was a doll.  The pizza is better than Grimaldi's.  Stick to the basics and skip the calzone pizza.  My only complaint is that they charged us for parmesean cheese to sprinkle on the pizza.  Really?  The stuff that other places keep out on the table?  That seemed a little cheeky.  And if you are going to do that, at least offer a warning when asking for it.  Are you going to charge for salt next? (Don't suggest that to the Mayor.)",3.0
"First, the mostly good news.  The space itself is quite nice.  The prices aren't that exorbitant.The pizza is good.  Bonus points for crust that is the right level of crunch, without being too charred.  The toppings themselves -- prosciutto, arugula, and pepperoni, were also all good.  But, for the pepperoni pizza, 3 pieces of delicious pepperoni per slice just doesn't cut it in my book.  Fascati's (best slice place in the neighborhood) a few blocks away piles on the pepperoni, so, I feel this issue definitely needs to be addressed.But, as expected in a restaurant that is only a few days old, the service was quite bad -- and I knew this -- but alas, I had family visiting from abroad and took the opportunity to take them to an authentic Brooklyn pizza since we were in DUMBO.   A place like Juliana's, you should be in and out the door in an hour.  Not 2.  There just was no communication between any of the servers.  Even poor Patsy Grimaldi was lost in the fray.   There was no broccoli rabe (for the #3) and we werent told this for a whole hour as we waited for our mythical pizza.  We ended up with the #4, but this wasn't what we wanted -- it was still good, but would have been nice to know that the  particular pizza we were waiting on was never going to come.However, even with bad service, I still expect some level of customer service and I think that should be present right when the restaurant opens.  That is, if the order is screwed up, or it takes forever, or if you are not acknowledged - this just leads to grumpy customers.  So, you try to mend things as best you can -- comp a glass of wine, or a dessert, or coffee, or anything really.  Nothing.  This really goes a long way in having satisfied customers. So, we left quite grumpy after having some mostly good pizza.  I'll return, eventually, but I think Juliana's is too green for now - it definitely needs a few more weeks.  For tourists, since I figure most of you will want to know.  If you're in this part of Brooklyn, you're better off going to Fascati's for a New York slice.  Or, for Neopolitan, Sottocasa or Luna Rossa.  I can't really recommend Grimaldi's 3.0 next door because I havent been to the new incarnation, and don't really have a desire to.  So, 4 stars for pizza, 1.5 stars for service.  I know the service will get better, both from the servers, and more importantly, the cusomter service.  I look forward to returning in a month or so.",3.0
"Juliana's is a GREAT new addition to the neighborhood.  The staff is friendly and helpful (what a novel idea G's), the place is attractive, warm and inviting (rather than it looking like it moved overnight), the pizza is delicious and really the way it was intended to be by the original founders; Patsy and Carol.  Unlike some of the others here on Yelp, I am taking a side in this pizza war, and my money is on Juliana's!  Thankfully there is a real alternative to the arrogance of Grimalidi's (and the cardboard around the corner).p.s.

"I'm pretty picky about ratings but Juliana's deserves 5 stars. I was totally unaware of the ""pizza war"" before visiting Brooklyn but after reading a dozen or so reviews, I decided to walk right past Grimaldi's and into the pleasure that is Juliana's.  Everything about our experience was great - very nice location, good atmosphere (nice upscale change from your typical hole-in-the-wall NY pizza joint), good service, good beer, decent prices (a bit pricey but hey - this place has a great reputation), and most importantly of all, great food. The pizza was huge and thin and delicious and just plain awesome. Everything I'd expect and want from NY pizza. And then there was the cannoli. Oooh I'm a big cannoli guy so I was quite surprised to discover the cream had anise flavor (which I don't care for much at all). Somehow though, it worked and was absolutely delicious and cheesy and the perfect texture. If we're back in DUMBO, we'll be most certainly be back. No need to even try Grimaldi's.",5.0
So after the west indian day parade I stopped for some pizza. Found parking right in front of Juliana's and Mr Grimaldis himself stopped us on our way to Grimaldis. So I said why not!!!!

"This is the same pizza as Grimaldis next door. Same sauce and cheese with maybe a minor alteration in the dough. The difference is the owner, environment and the price/toppings.

"Soooo glad to have this open. This is actually the real Grimaldi's, with the original oven and original family owners; the other one moved next door, and is not using the right oven and just uses the Grimaldi's name it bought. I like that the tourists think the place called Grimaldi's is the actual one; let them wait online for the fake pizza. I walk right by them and go to Juliana's.This place actually feels local and warm. The staff is nice, and the pizza is fantastic.

"On a day trip to NYC, I was given a crash course on the pizza war.  I was told this is the real Grimaldis, which sold its name to the now Grimaldis (literally next door down, which got more touristy and less in quality supposedly) and couldn't use the name anymore. So he named it Juliana's after grandma and uses the original oven. Can't attest to the accuracy of the info however. We walked across the Brooklyn Bridge and got there for lunch on a Saturday. The space is tiny, so there was a wait (outside by the curb) yet it wasn't bad at all.  The hostess kept us informed on the progress of the wait, which seemed to impress our local friends. The service overall was efficient, nothing too special but seems to be above average for the city per our friends.  The ambiance was a nice down home feel without being dumpy. It looked so nice that I at first questioned the food quality (since I thought REAL pizza joints would look more like holes in the wall)Here comes the food.  Menu selection wasn't huge and everyone seems to stick with the basic, the margherita.  For good reason, because it was indeed fabulous. The freshness of the tomato sauce and cheese is apparent.  The dough was yummy, not too doughy, but not as thin crust as I thought either. We had a 2nd smaller one (16in instead of 18in, not much size difference in my opinion, still pretty big and plenty for 2-3 ppl) with anchovies and sausage. The sausage was made with fennel, and has a very prominent taste because of it, beware.  Anchovies added saltiness (& fishiness), thus making this a very powerful combo. I liked it but not sure if it's for everyone.I saw the calamari being passed nearby, which I thought looked rather delicious and plentiful for $8. The plain pie was $19 for large, $16 for smaller one.  The 2 extra toppings were $5. I have no idea how much a pie is normally in NYC, it's a little pricey for pizza I thought, but this is definitely not just another pizza place so it's worth the splurge.",5.0
"Here's the deal.  You have to choose between this and Grimaldi's.  They are both spectacular.  If you prefer the crust just a bit more singed, go here.  Others will o here because the line tends to be shorter, or because they want a beer or glass of wine with their meal . . . Grimaldi's lost their license, at least for now.",5.0

"I loved this place. We arrived right as they opened the restaurant, so we did not have to wait in the queue (as we got out of the place, there was a long line of people waiting outside). The service is excellent, we did not have to wait more than 10 minutes for our food to arrive. There is a bar area kind of seating, which has about 4 chairs and it overlooks the kitchen so you can actually see the pizza being made, which I thought was pretty cool.

He named the restaurant after his mother. The service was great too, one of my friend's phone battery ran out and they even charged it for us. We tried the White Pizza, Pizza Special # 4, and the Margarita. My favorite was the Margarita! Give it a try the next time you visit the Brooklyn Bridge.",4.0

"Soooo glad to have this open. This is actually the real Grimaldi's, with the original oven and original family owners; the other one moved next door, and is not using the right oven and just uses the Grimaldi's name it bought.

"Best pizza ever! NYC, LA, Italy has nothing on this joint. Right next door to Grimaldi's and this place cooks up the flavors 100 times better. Can't wait to go back and get a little piece of heaven.",5.0
"I know, it seems crazy that a girl from San Diego would be a NYC pizza expert, but I have tried just about every major spot in New York, and at the purported best places in New Haven, LA, San Fran and Naples, so I do know more than a little bit about the subject. We even put on a New York ""pizza quest"" several years ago where we went (ala Monty Python) from joint to joint  sampling pies in search of the Holy Pizza Grail. That trek started at Grimaldis and we were so disappointed in the pizza  we were served there that we almost decided to abort the mission. I remember having to wait in line an hour for cruddy service, and a over-sauced pie with such soggy crust that we struggled to keep the topping from sliding off. (Fortunately we kept going, and both Lombardi's and the dearly departed Una Pizza Napolitano showed strong).  So on my  most  recent visit  to The City, I heard the story about Patsy Grimaldi coming out of retirement and opening in the original space now that Frank Ciolli  (""I'm not really a Grimaldi but I play one on TV"") had moved his shop next door. Patsy on staff, reviving the the pizzas as they were back in the 80's, cooking in the original coal ovens that made the place famous? I was SOOO there! I gotta say the  place is much cuter and cleaner than Grimaldi's when they were in this space. My server was very accommodating and there was no problem with the timing of the pie. It seemed that they've worked out the service kinks that some Yelpers had when the place first opened. We had the Margarita (of course!) and it was borderline perfection. With this pizza it's all about the balance. The crust was just right, with some crispiness on the bottom, but just the right amount of chewiness. IMHO overly thin crusts aren't much better than making pizza on lavash bread. I would have liked a little more bubbling but as the aficionados will tell you, that's more for aesthetics than taste. The sauce wasn't overpowering (the #1 sin of the  cheapo shops in nyc) and the cheese is distributed around evenly, not in those dang ""four squares"" that some places serve so that you're stuck having some bites that are only sauce, and some that are overloaded with cheese. Tasty mix of herbs on top, and the amount basil looked chincy, but they use such high quality product that it leaves a long-lasting finish (oops, busted. that's wine-speak). I went around 2:00  which is when I like to eat at all the foodie places to avoid waits (hint: many place like Momofuku and Il Buco Alimintari serve all afternoon). Since the crowd had thinned out, I got to chat a bit with Carol,  Patsy's wife. She was bopping around table to table checking up on her guests. I was surprised by three things she said. First of all, she is not a stickler for tradition and is anything but a pizza purist. Her take on it is, ""we aren't serving Italian pizza, we're serving New York pizza"". She mentioned that they were experimenting with a high-end black truffle pizza, and that when the wine list gets expanded there will be a reserve list for people that want something really great  to drink. The beer list is already very good (Lagunitas and Ommegang as well as Brooklyn's own) so I look forward to seeing what they do with the wine. They also don't have a problem if someone orders it ""extra crispy"" or wants ""easy cheese"". They seem much more open to customer service than the previous tenant in this space! Can't wait to come back to town and try some of the pies with the other toppings. I talked to the people next to me and they had both the sausage and classic white, and claimed them top-notch.  Now I can't wait to get back to LA and compare the crust from Brooklyn to Nancy Silverton and Batali's celebrated effort at Pizzaria Mozza while the memory is still fresh. I like Mozza's crust but it always seems a little too thick, making it hard to enjoy more than one slice. I'm pretty sure that Juliana's is going to win hands down.",5.0
Best pizza I ever had.  We came here around New Years and were not disappointed.  The sauce. The cheese.  The toppings.

We had Margarita pizza with meatballs and mushrooms. Crispy crust and delicious sauce. Good job. If you are in the area, well worth it. And the service is pleasant and professional .",4.0
Delicious pizza and our waiter (Terrance) was excellent!  Would definitely come back!!,5.0
Just a wonderful place. Great food. Made us feel welcome.,5.0
"A bit pricey, but you get what you pay for! We got here at 11:25am (5 minutes before they opened on a Saturday) and there was no line yet which was nice. Even better than the Grimaldi's at this location, the pizza was super tasty and service was friendly and prompt. We shared a small pepperoni, sausage and onion pizza and everything about it was wonderful. The meat was plentiful and the onions still had a bit of firmness that you could still get a bit of bite to it. Sauce was tasty and the crust was perfectly cooked and flavorful on its own. I definitely recommend!",4.0
Had to eat here after an adjoining pizza place was incredibly busy. Disappointment reigns as our margarita pie was just ok. There was some spicy thing going on in the sauce that I did not like. The crust was just a tad dry. Overall taste was also just ok.   My 2 stars is harsh as it's way better than your average pizza place.,2.0
"Best pizza in NY. I used to be a loyal fan of Grimaldi's (having gone many times over the years with my parents who still live in Brooklyn), but we tried Juliana's once when it first opened and have been going there (and bringing family and friends who visit NY there) ever since. Everything tastes amazing -- the sauces are flavorful, the toppings are fresh, the crust is perfectly cooked, and the white pizza is the best I have ever had. Seeing Patsy Grimaldi himself is just the icing on the cake. Take it from a lifelong New Yorker -- fuggeddabout the line at Grimaldi's and pop on over to Juliana's!",5.0
"This is some of the best pizza in NYC.  It was started by Patsy Grimaldi, the name behind the legendary Grimaldi's pizza.  This coal fired pizza is some of the best you will find. I would never wait in line at Grimaldi's when I could go here.",5.0
I love this place great menu and fresh ingredients!! Wish the staff were alittle more attentive considering we barely had water during our meal,4.0
"After several unsuccessful attempts during weekends, we finally made it on a Tuesday for lunch. Walking past more tourists lining up for Grimaldi's I was looking forward to some great pizza without the long lines. Unfortunately I was pretty disappointed with the offering. Service was great, people were nice and food came fast but I was there for the pizza and it was bland. For the first time ever I put salt on my pizza just to help a little but it didn't hide the plain cheese, plain sauce and so-so crust. Any other city I would have been happy but with so many great choices in NY (many of those not so far from the train), I will not be returning.",3.0
"Hard to beat the charm and taste of the real Grimaldi. This isn't the NYC pizza with that weird orange colored cheese dripping with oil down your leg. It's lighter fresher and easy to down a whole pie. Service is friendly, you might even get a few espressos from Pasty himself.",4.0
"Like many have mentioned before me Patsy, the original owner of Grimaldi's who got muscled out, is the owner of Juliana's and he came out and greeted us after we had our pizza. Such a nice guy and a really great staff. However, what really matters is the pizza and it was amazing! Best pizza we had while in NY. Skip the line at Grimaldi's and get the original at Juliana's.",5.0
"I want to be buried here. Or at the very least I'd like to die eating this pizza. We didn't get one of their recommended options, but instead ordered garlic and pepperoni on a cheese pizza. So good. The wait for two wasn't that long (certainly shorter than the wait for Grimaldi's next door, which is what I imagine purgatory to be like).  The restaurant's a little noisy/packed, but that's just a testament to how great it is.",5.0

"Hands down my favorite pizza in the world! As a Brooklyn resident, you better believe I've had my fair share of pizza, and this one really takes the cake, or should I say, pizza pie.A little over a year ago, my fiance and I walked past the former location of Grimaldi's, where Juliana's now resides, and saw a banner that the real Patsy Grimaldi was coming back with his personal brand of pizza. We eagerly anticipated the grand opening, and upon hearing news of the restaurant making its opening, we went to grab some pizza during opening week. WOW were we impressed!!

"Spectacular pizza, in the USA northeast neo-Neapolitan style.  We tried two pies: the margarita with housemade mozzarella and the No. 1 House Special (Housemade mozzarella, Scamorza affumicata, pancetta, scallions and truffle oil--no tomato.)  Both were perfection.  Perfect leoparding char on the bottom crust, and totally balanced with the top-cooking.  We showed up on a Monday around noon and got a seat promptly, as a party of two.  But the place was basically full at the time, and there was soon a line.  So the word is out that this place is the genuine Grimaldi's, I guess.  Juliana herself, Patsy's wife, was there and managing operations pretty closely.  She seemed to inspect every pizza and even did the cutting at times as they were on their way out.  She talked with us twice to ensure that all was well with the food.  Can't ask for more.One of many things that makes me envy those who live in the NYC area.  I just get to look forward to a next visit.",5.0
"This is my second time at Juliana's, the first being a while back when they first opened. I had friends in town from New Orleans who were desperate for great pizza and while there is no shortage in New York, we decided Juliana's was the best choice in terms of location, ambiance, experience, and most of all, taste. Needless to say, no one in our group was disappointed. It was a Sunday night and while there was (of course) a line, it was reasonable (wait time approx. 15 minutes, and never once did we feel forgotten or that we were languishing on line with no end in sight). Patsy came out frequently and, in his usual fashion, talked to everyone waiting and updated us on what we could expect in terms of timing for a group of four. Once we were seated we were impressed by the service (friendly, attentive waiter and staff) the spacing out of the tables (if you've visited the location before it changed over the fact that our table was not touching anyone else's is a real treat), and the atmosphere (clean, minimal black and white décor, great view of the oven). Once our food arrived, none of the above would have mattered one bit because the pizza was so good. Arguably we over-ordered (two large pies for a party of four) but we wanted lots of variety and two slices per person was not going to cut it. We had one regular margherita pie and one with half peperoni half cremini mushrooms. Everything was delicious, perfectly cooked, and tasted so fresh that in the end there was only a slice and half left, AND we had dessert (both the cannoli (his late wife's specialty) and the cheesecake were delicious. We will be sure to try the Brookie Bridge next time. Overall, everything was fantastic and so deserving of 5-stars.I wish I could get through this review without mentioning Grimaldi's but given the history it's nearly impossible.

"We came here for dinner and was happy that there wasn't a line. We ordered the margherita pizza, prosciutto and arugula pizza and a Caesar Salad. Both were great. Place was very clean.

At first, I thought they didn't have any take out boxes. I assumed wrong. There was plenty, so I don't know what his problem was.

I am staying at the Sheraton Brooklyn and wanted to eat a great pizza. Yelpers said to get a pizza from this place and it was a fantastic choice. The walk to and from this place was worth it.

"This is awesome pizza!  It's right next door to the oft-praised Grimaldi's but the day we were there Grimaldi's had a line 20 deep out the door, and Juliana's was immediate seating.  It's a cozy restaurant with great wait staff.  Crusty on the outside and chewy on the inside of the crust,  perfect sauce and toppings.

Literally the best pizza I have ever had. i would honestly fly to new York just for dinner here if it wasnt so cost prohibative. the owner (Patsy) is awsome and his wifes cannolis should be enjoyed with someone you love. I wish yelp had a 6th star to give this family run business.,5.0
"I went here with a friend last night (after learning that the original Grimaldi's owners opened Juliana's in the old location and the current owners of the ""Grimaldi's"" chain aren't the same).  So I was expecting the delicious thin crust brick oven pizza that made Grimaldi's famous as one of the best pizzas in the city, and Juliana's did not disappoint!  We finished off our two small pies and salad with a cannoli and a brookie to share (a brownie cookie - who can argue with that)!  The service was great, there was a bit of a wait since there were a few tables seated right before us but the pizza was worth waiting for!  If you're looking for authentic pizza made by the original Grimaldi family, skip the line at the chain on the corner and come here!",5.0
I am staying at the Sheraton Brooklyn and wanted to eat a great pizza. Yelpers said to get a pizza from this place and it was a fantastic choice. The walk to and from this place was worth it. I carried back the prosciutto pizza. It was cooked to perfection. It was far better than anything I could get back home.,5.0

"Went here last night, and the place is legit.  So rumor was it that this is the real Grimaldi.  We actually saw him pacing around outside, smoking a cigar, drinking some wine and introducing us to the restaurant.  Definitely a nice charm and feel to the place.  Food was amazing.  Service was great.  It was a bit on the pricey side, $50 for a pizza, a soda and a beer, but the experience was definitely one to write home about.  Check it out!",4.0

"Located in DUMBO (down under Manhattan Brooklyn overpass) area is one of the best pizzas. Juliana's is the original grimaldi's, so their oven is a little more seasoned.

"I was so happy when Juliana's opened after reading about it in the paper a while back.The pizza was absolutely smashing.  I think it is better now than in Patsy's earlier incarnation.   What's Grimaldi's now jumped the shark a while ago when they started treating locals like dirt and went after the tourist trade exclusively.The restaurant is more pleasant and definitely more upscale than before.  Prices also jumped a little but the food was wonderful and well worth it. We had a salad and one of the special pies which had no tomato sauce but rather cherry tomatoes, garlic, parmesan, buffalo mozzarella and basil.  I probably could have eaten the whole pie myself.  The cannolli may have been the best one I ever had.  They didn't have decaf coffee, just espresso.Service was superb, friendly enough without being too familiar, quick and efficient.  Every employee seemed pleasant and happy enough.Can't wait to go back.",5.0

"I was really looking forward to trying Juliana's because of all the history with pizzaiolo Patsy and to once again be in the original Grimaldi's space. It's a shame the current Grimaldi's next door has fallen off terribly and for the first time I didn't see 1 person on line. Insane. Juliana's sure went through a makeover inside. It's actually pretty fancy for a pizzeria with contemporary decor plus a jukebox for kicks. A world of difference from the original Grimaldi's....including the new coal oven. The service was friendly and inviting though our particular waitress was a bit slow.As someone with very high pizza standards i found the pizza good but not amazing. (When dealing with new york style pizza everything must be compared to the legendary Di Fara's which is in a class of its own).The pizza is served neat and ingredients are fresh and balanced but nothing was particularly mouth orgasmic. Crust had some density to it so i wouldn't consider it thin crust. Our party of 4 ordered 3 pies: margherita, half pepperoni half meatball pie, sausage pie. I particularly liked the pepperoni and sausage, meatballs were disappointing.It was a pleasant experience and i am curious to see how Juliana's will improve over time and i have no doubt it will.",3.0

Not only is the pizza fresh and delicious, crust absolutely addictive , but the salads are yummy, who knew there were white anchovies?  The last time we ate there, even though we were stuffed, saw a ""brookie bridge"" being served and had to have one - unbelievable chocolate perfection.  Service was wonderful, warm and friendly -even though the word is out and there was a line, never felt rushed.

The wait staff was incredibly friendly when I went on a Friday afternoon.More importantly: Juliana's pizza is better than Grimaldi's pizza. It's most apparent in the dough.Why? ...because it just is. So do yourself a favor and skip that line at Grimaldi's and head here. You're welcome.,5.0

"I was so happy when Juliana's opened after reading about it in the paper a while back.The pizza was absolutely smashing.  I think it is better now than in Patsy's earlier incarnation.   What's Grimaldi's now jumped the shark a while ago when they started treating locals like dirt and went after the tourist trade exclusively.The restaurant is more pleasant and definitely more upscale than before.  Prices also jumped a little but the food was wonderful and well worth it. We had a salad and one of the special pies which had no tomato sauce but rather cherry tomatoes, garlic, parmesan, buffalo mozzarella and basil.  I probably could have eaten the whole pie myself.  The cannolli may have been the best one I ever had.  They didn't have decaf coffee, just espresso.Service was superb, friendly enough without being too familiar, quick and efficient.  Every employee seemed pleasant and happy enough.Can't wait to go back.",5.0
"Tripped over this place on a day trip to tool around Brooklyn. Thin crust, just the right amount of sauce, topped with thinly sliced cheese so you weren't pawing all over yourself to rip off the cheese. Would def return.",4.0
"I was really looking forward to trying Juliana's because of all the history with pizzaiolo Patsy and to once again be in the original Grimaldi's space. It's a shame the current Grimaldi's next door has fallen off terribly and for the first time I didn't see 1 person on line. Insane. Juliana's sure went through a makeover inside. It's actually pretty fancy for a pizzeria with contemporary decor plus a jukebox for kicks. A world of difference from the original Grimaldi's....including the new coal oven. The service was friendly and inviting though our particular waitress was a bit slow.As someone with very high pizza standards i found the pizza good but not amazing. (When dealing with new york style pizza everything must be compared to the legendary Di Fara's which is in a class of its own).The pizza is served neat and ingredients are fresh and balanced but nothing was particularly mouth orgasmic. Crust had some density to it so i wouldn't consider it thin crust. Our party of 4 ordered 3 pies: margherita, half pepperoni half meatball pie, sausage pie. I particularly liked the pepperoni and sausage, meatballs were disappointing.It was a pleasant experience and i am curious to see how Juliana's will improve over time and i have no doubt it will.",3.0

I couldn't wait to find the restaurant founded by Patsy Grimaldi and found it at... The location where Grimaldi's was. The space is renovated which sheds some of the charm but makes for a very nice decor. The service was friendly and the pizza was divine.  I went midday during the week. I am holding off 5 stars until I go during a busier time and see I'd the pizza and service hold up.,4.0
"Been there three times-definitely worth the trip!  This is the real thing, delicious coal oven cooked pizza, wonderful sauce and just the right amount of exceptional cheese.  Patsy And Carol Grimaldi are back in their element serving the best pizza in New York.  Wouldn't waste my time waiting in line at Grimalds, now just a chain living off a reputation they no longer deserve. Not only is the pizza fresh and delicious, crust absolutely addictive , but the salads are yummy, who knew there were white anchovies?  The last time we ate there, even though we were stuffed, saw a ""brookie bridge"" being served and had to have one - unbelievable chocolate perfection.  Service was wonderful, warm and friendly -even though the word is out and there was a line, never felt rushed.

The service was pretty good and friendly (compared to what some other reviewers are saying). We were there on a Thursday night at about 8:30. It was only about half full. Decent wine by the glass.

"Have been waiting with a grumbling stomach for the past year for Juliana's to open.  I went last night for opening night and have to say that the pizza was great.  The crust was light, fluffy and salty with just the right amount of char.  The sauce was bright and sweet and the cheese was melted to perfection and didn't fall off the pizza in chunks like Grimaldi's does.  As someone who lives in DUMBO and has waited out the line at Grimaldi's only to be disappointed by the soggy burnt pizza and rude staff, I couldn't be more excited to have Patsy back in the neighborhood in front of the oven where he belongs!",5.0

"If you can dine at Juliana's without the care or knowledge of the dispute between the owner's of Juliana's and Grimaldi's; you would find yourself in a family run restaurant where the owner and his wife are quite involved with the daily operations of the establishment. The owner, would make his rounds to each table to check in on the customer's current experience with the food and would even strike up a random conversation which further adds onto the dining experience a memorable one. The pizza is definitely a notch or 2 above the usual 'popular' establishments (there's way too many variables and opinions as to which place has the best pizza in NYC), when I say 'popular' I refer to the places where there's a ridiculous line of predominantly tourists outside waiting for a table.

"I've been meaning to try Julianna's pizza since they took over the old spot of Grimaldi's (or maybe it was theirs to begin with). It doesn't really matter who came first. What matters is the food they serve. We didn't have to wait very long and was seated after 10 minutes. We ordered our first pie which was sausage and sweet onion and was very excited to show off NY pizza to our friend who's from out of town. Pizza arrived and we each took a slice, but before we took our first bite we noticed that it was missing the sausage. We waived to our server and asked what  had happened to the sausage missing from our pie. Instead of apologizing for messing up our order, he was very rude and suggested that maybe we could include the sausage in our next order. Mind you we waited for a good 20 minutes for this pizza. After going back and forth with our server, he said he would gladly take away the pizza and make us a new one with the right order. WTF??? We didn't give the impression that we wanted the pizza taken away. We waited 20 minutes and it was dinner after all. Wouldn't you just give the pizza on the house instead of throwing it out away? Long story short, he ended up giving us a free pie.Now the pizza. Undercook and doughy! If this is all they make at Julianna's, wouldn't you think they would have perfected the art of making a pizza?? It was the worst pizza I've ever had! The second pie came and it was cooked unevenly. One side was well done while the other half tasted like bread with tomato sauce. Just horrible. I couldn't wait to leave that place.Sorry Julianna's, I tried.",2.0

The pizza was great - even my picky Italian husband had little room to complain. We took the manager's advice and added the smokey mozzarella to our margherita and it was delicious, as was their special with prosciutto and arugula. Several people at the other venue stopped by to inquire about where we got the fabulous pizza. We will be back.",4.0

"I've been meaning to try Julianna's pizza since they took over the old spot of Grimaldi's (or maybe it was theirs to begin with). It doesn't really matter who came first. What matters is the food they serve. We didn't have to wait very long and was seated after 10 minutes. We ordered our first pie which was sausage and sweet onion and was very excited to show off NY pizza to our friend who's from out of town. Pizza arrived and we each took a slice, but before we took our first bite we noticed that it was missing the sausage. We waived to our server and asked what  had happened to the sausage missing from our pie. Instead of apologizing for messing up our order, he was very rude and suggested that maybe we could include the sausage in our next order. Mind you we waited for a good 20 minutes for this pizza. After going back and forth with our server, he said he would gladly take away the pizza and make us a new one with the right order. WTF??? We didn't give the impression that we wanted the pizza taken away. We waited 20 minutes and it was dinner after all. Wouldn't you just give the pizza on the house instead of throwing it out away? Long story short, he ended up giving us a free pie.Now the pizza. Undercook and doughy! If this is all they make at Julianna's, wouldn't you think they would have perfected the art of making a pizza?? It was the worst pizza I've ever had! The second pie came and it was cooked unevenly. One side was well done while the other half tasted like bread with tomato sauce. Just horrible. I couldn't wait to leave that place.Sorry Julianna's, I tried.",2.0
so weird and out of touch... nothing special in this city of special pizza places and the worst service in all of new york.,1.0
Excellent. Don't both with the old Grimaldi's any more this is the place to go in DUMBO for pizza.,5.0
"Outstanding pizza, great ambiance, excellent service. My wife and I dropped in on a cold rainy day and were instantly warmed up by the setting and the engaging, hospitable servers. The pizza had the best crust and just the right amount of delicious, quality toppings. I've eaten lots of pizza in Italy and I can't think of a time I enjoyed it more than Juliana's. We were visiting from St. Albert, Alberta, Canada and will definitely dine here again next time we're in Brooklyn.",5.0
"Fughetabout Grimaldi's! BEST Pizza by far JULIANA'S!! I left Grimaldi's longing for Chicago style pizza of Zachery's pizza of Berkeley my favorite spot. LOVED Juliana's, and now I am not sure which pizza spot is my favorite? Zagots got it wrong, Juliana's is THE BEST PIZZA IN NEW YORK!!!!!!!",5.0
"Planned to eat at Grimaldi's and joined long line to get in, local guy told us story of how Patsy Grimaldi sold it and now has a new restaurant next door called Juliana's, where they have installed the original stone pizza oven. Changed line and after a short wait got a great table in Juliana's. Patsy himself and his wife chatted to guests and the staff were great. Now what can I say about the pizzas, amazing some of the best we've had, and if you've got room try the ice cream with brownies, heavenly ! We'll be back !",5.0
"Fantastic pizza (probably one of the best I've ever had), above-and-beyond very friendly wait staff, 10 minute wait, sample of beer instead of description when we asked, and relatively well-priced.",5.0
"Decided to go again with some friends. I want to get as much as I can before the long lines set in. We had to wait for a few minutes for a table, as it was. We had a margherita pizza with scamorza (smoked mozzarella), which was a hearty topping on a crispy crust and perfect for a winter's afternoon. I saw some of the concerns people have posted about service and I did have to spur the waiters on at a few moments, but I think they're just getting their sea legs. I can tell that this place has the warmth, homeyness, and passion that's going to make it a pizza tradition. Everyone (including some of the owners) was there with their families, and it was just a nice, cozy atmosphere.",5.0
"We just happened to walk by Juliana's this afternoon on essentially opening day. First, let me preface that I have never been to Grimaldi's, so have no comparison to either Patsy's original or the pies they currently serve next door.  But of course, have been following the pizza wars and the highly anticipated return.  So we felt very lucky to walk into Juliana's at lunch today and find it nearly empty, while the line was already snaking with Lonely Planet wielding tourists next door.  After trying Patsy's famed pies, I am sure things will start to look a lot differently very soon.  This is damn good pizza. We've made it a point to try all the pies that pizza snobs herald as the ""best"" in this city, and this holds its own.  This is a purist's pie - classic ingredients, no-nonsense simple sauce, and coal-fired char.  It is the crust that elevates the pizza from simply good - this might just be the holy grail of pizza crusts, in fact.  It is classically thin, but still soft and chewy, charred, but not crackery, and most impressive of all, holds its shape without getting soggy, even at the tip, even while finishing the last piece (because you will) that has been sitting in its own cheesy goodness for 15 min.  Patsy was inspecting each pie with a frightening intensity, and his wife seated us. The cannoli that bears her name was also delish.  If I was being picky I could talk about some of the obvious hitches in service as they worked out the kinks (i.e. learned how to use a computer), but it was the first day, and who doesn't love a comeback story?",5.0
"This is THE Grimaldi's as Patsy is back. The wait to get in was bearable even at 30 mins. In spite of the packed house the service was great. I wasn't sure of which craft beer to order so the waiter kindly brought over a sampler of 3 bers gratis. The arugula salad with goat cheese and walnuts was delicious. Maybe a bit small for the price ($12) so we ordered two. No problem we were here for the pizza anyway. Went with the Margarita in a purist attempt to sample. Without a doubt the Margarita pizza was literally a slice of heaven. Sauce was fresh and robust, cheese was not greasy but stringy and yummy, and the crust was just the right thickness with almost a buttery note to it. Pizza perfection! To end our meal we tried the cannoli. Without hesitation these were some of the best we've ever had. Shells were fresh and the filling was light and airy. Not the typical heavy filling. Very, very good!!! Don't forget to try a few.",5.0
"Juliana's is perfect, the best sit-down, whole-pie pizza joint in all of New York City.  For those who do not know the story, Grimaldi's under the Brooklyn Bridge has always been one of the top two or three pizza places in New York that every one wants to try when they are in town.  A while ago they had some sort of dispute and the Grimaldi's business moved up the street leaving behind the original Mr. Patsy Grimaldi who reopened under Juliana's.  When it was Grimaldi's this place was on my radar, but the ridiculousness of the crowds, and the cramped environs and rushed service kept it from being A+ but the pizza was amazing, particularly in the cheese and topping department.  Now that all the BS associated with Grimaldi's has moved up the block, it is a much nicer vibe inside, much friendlier service and even a relaxed family like atmosphere.  Most importantly, the pizza, and the oven that it has always been made in are exactly the same, and yes they still have to slow down the order taking every once in a while to reheat more coals.  They also now have a good selection of draft beers, a few more less traditional topping options and really cool seltzer water that comes to your table in a jar with a tap.  Also, they've somehow managed to make all these improvements to the menu, service and atmosphere while keeping the prices just about the same as they were before.  All in all, I can now take friends and family from out of town to get the perfect NY pie without having to worry about scaring them away, I just hope this lasts and the crowds stick blindly to Grimaldi's up the block.",5.0
"If you want good pizza, this is definitely the place to go! It was the Saturday night of Memorial Day weekend and we had a wait (short but worth it!!!) We ordered the Caesar Salad (yummy) and the Arugula Salad that had goat cheese and walnuts (OMG, I couldn't get enough). We ordered the No. 2 (cherry tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella, garlic and sea salt) and the No. 3 (mozzarella, sausage, broccoli rabe and garlic) pizzas. Crust was to perfection, toppings were plentiful and taste was unbelievable. And if that weren't enough, we had to taste the Brookie Bridge with raspberry ice cream made especially for Julianna's from the Brooklyn Ice cream place just down the street. No matter how much you eat,  you have to save room for this little treat. It's a brownie cookie sandwich with this raspberry chocolate chip ice cream in it. To die for!!!! The place is cute and you can even sit and watch them making the pizzas and see the oven it's cooked in. Well worth the trip from New Jersey. Will be doing this again real soon and I suggest you do the same! You won't be sorry.",5.0
