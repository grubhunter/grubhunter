"My to go Shanghai spot in Brooklyn!  Hands down the BEST and most AFFORDABLE Shanghai food!  I am lucky I live only a couple of blocks away but this place is easy to get to as well - D Train to 18th Ave or there's a bus that goes here too!This spot is a bit small but it feel super home-y!  You might need to wait a bit if you come during peak hours (lunch and dinner) but I promise it won't be more than 20 mins!  The staff here is super attentive.  I usually order Fried Wontons in Peanut and Hot Sauce,  Scallion Pancake and Pork Soup Dumplings.  The food came about 10 mins after I ordered - how quick was that?! Fried Wontons in Peanut and Hot Sauce - my personal favorite from this place!  They make it super different from other spots because they actually fry their wontons so it's super crunchy when you bite into it!  Their peanut sauce is AMAZING!  Such a perfect combo that it literally melts in my mouth!  This dish was only $5.95 for TEN pieces!Scallion Pancake - I love the texture of the scallion pancakes here!  It's super toasty and it's paired with a sweet type of vinegar sauce!Pork Soup Dumpling - this was super inexpensive compared to other places I've been to... $4.95 for EIGHT pieces - definitely a steal for me.  Even though these soup dumplings didn't stand out to me in regards to taste - I would still recommend!Overall, I would recommend this spot to anyone who is around the area - you won't be disappointed!",5.0
"Local, fresh and homemade. The food here is really great and best of all, it is a place close to me so I can come here to fulfill my need for xiaolongbao! Now to the food: Scallop Soup Dumplings - Surprisingly good, tasty with a great after flavor. However not my favorite of the meal and since it costs about twice the pork soup dumplings, I'd rather go for the pork instead. Pork Soup Dumplings - Star of the meal, I really enjoyed these! Great taste with good soup to meat ratio. Rather cheap as well (4.95 for 8) so you would do well to order two of these! Fried Wontons in Peanut & Hot Sauce - pretty good but far more sweet and not very hot than I would have thought. Tasty (I certainly enjoyed it) but overall I may decide against ordering this next time. Shanghai Style with preserved vegetable and pork - hmm I love this dish! Always a favorite for me at Shanghai restaurants. It wasn't overly salty and oily (which I did enjoy). My brother added some salt to this, but I was more than happy to finish it. Free tapioca dessert at the end! I really enjoyed coming to eat at this small no-frills restaurant with great food at great prices. Would definitely come back.",4.0
"We came in a group of 3 on a Sunday night around 6pm and since that is still an early time for dinner, we were able to get a table right away. By the time we finished our meal, there were 1-2 groups waiting for tables. We ordered several dishes. The soup pork dumplings, mixed pork and crab meat dumplings, scallion pancake were all delicious. The dumplings seemed like a smaller size than the Manhattan Chinatown ones. Some waitresses speak both English and Chinese so there's less chance of a miscommunication if you don't speak Chinese. My mom's friends have said this place is known for their fish head soup and I am interested in trying the next time I come!",4.0
"When I read a tip that said the chef from the now-closed Goody's in Chinatown had moved here(not verified), I was excited to try it.  I came in for a weekday lunch once and it was empty.  Understandable, since 86th street is ridden with restaurants closer to public transportation.We ordered the Pork Soup Dumplings, Scallion Pancake, and upon the waitress' suggestion, the Dong Po Pork(Braised Pork Belly).  As a Shanghainese restaurant, their dumplings were pretty terrible.  The meat was dry & flavorless, and the soup that I looked forward to slurping was also bland.The scallion pancakes were abysmal- the scallions seemed to have gone home for the day.  The heavy batter was ladled too thick, causing the chef to overcompensate on cook time.  The excessive oil didn't help its case.  This was the hardest item to eat.The one item we were recommended, the pork belly, was above average.  After the first two items, I was expecting more of the same, but this item earned them the extra star.  The pork was nice and tender, and drizzled in the right amount of sauce.  There were a few mushrooms/vegetables that accompanied this dish along with steamed buns to wrap the meat in.  Because it is comprised of 50% percent fatty meat, I'd recommend at least 5 to share this dish; indulging in too much of this can feel sickeningly gluttonous.Overall, I would not return here for my Shanghainese food fix.",2.0
"This is a hidden gem in the heart of Bensonhurst. It is kind of out of the way from the train or bus (still need to walk a bit), but definitely worth making a visit to. Both times I came here, I ordered the soup dumplings and fried wontons. The pork soup dumplings and the crab soup dumplings are authentic and taste amazing. Add some ginger and vinegar to that and you have one of the best Chinese meals for the day. I preferred the dumplings over the wontons, but the latter are very good too. They're sweet and drenched in peanut butter sauce. I tried the scallion pancake on my second visit and was surprised at how good it was. Most of the scallion pancakes that I've had in the past including those made at home or at the regular Chinese restaurants are pretty good but usually too oily. The ones here are just right and not too salty or oily, definitely worth it. Service is friendly and fast as well. Would come back in the future to try other things, however, since I didn't get a chance to order any of the main dishes during my two visits.",4.0
"A gem in this neighborhood that consists of fast food take outs, the police precinct and a funeral home. This place is quite authentic with some exceptional dishes. I can make so many recommendations from here. The soft tofu with real crab meat sauce is delicious but have too much of a sesame seed oil. The Little soup dumplings are cheaper than most shanghai places and it's just as delicious if not more so. The fried wontons are addicting. The string bean and short ribs is a must too. Love the desert soup too.",4.0
"It's been about 9 hours since we ate our Liu's Shanghai Lunch.  It was so delicious, we're sitting here at midnight thinking about it.  My boyfriend: ""Man, that fried rice was so good, I should go dig it out of the trash and eat that bit I threw out.""",5.0
"Small and simple menued restaurant with big and explosive flavorful eats. Fried wontons covered in sauce? Check. Crab soup dumplings? Check! Hold up...scallop soup dumplings?? Umm, HELL YEAH CHECK! Absolutely loved everything but especially the scallop xlb! My only issue is that they were a bit on the dry side; where's the soup?? This is said with a lovingly disappointed comparison with the crab and scallop xlbs. But hey, that one complaint didn't stop me from giving Liu's a fiver, nor will it hinder me from returning ;)",5.0
"Lunar New Year 2016 celebration to welcome the Year of the Monkey with a friend takes my foodie Yelp travels to Brooklyn.  In culling through the positive reviews I was enticed to make the long journey on a polar vortex brutal winter cold day.  The Yelp reviews are accurate as Liu's Shanghai's signature soup dumplings and fried Wonton Dumplings are a absolute MUST and do not disappoint!!  I have a serious addiction for Pork Soup Dumplings 小 籠 包 (xiao lóng bāo).Pork Soup Dumplings 小 籠 包 (xiao lóng bāo)- very juicy and the skin was perfect texture not too thick but untraditionally steamed in a metal steamer rather than a traditional bamboo steamer.  The skin held intact when picking up the dumpling and placing onto our plate or mouths without breaking apart or the juices spilling out.Scallop soup dumplings 扇 貝 小 籠 包 (Shàn bèi xiao lóng bāo)- very juicy and deliciousFried Wonton Dumplings in peanut sauce- moist inside and very flavoredSmoked duck- crispy and flavorableOur bill totaled a very reasonable $35.80 + gratuity.  A small Shanghaiese cuisine restaurant that can be always busy with a high table turnover rate.  With parties larger than four be prepare to wait for a table.  Quality of food is solid without the tainted Americanized heavy influence of MSG.  Liu's Shanghai is close to authentic Shanghaiese cuisine and uphold substance in Bath Beach, Brooklyn.  Hospitality and table service is very welcoming and friendly as the staff are Cantonese speaking.  Our neighbor tables are mostly Cantonese speaking.  This small restaurant contains one traditional Chinese Buddhist shrine hanging near the ceiling with fresh food offerings and incense burning.  It is nicely decorated for Lunar New Year as the door contains a traditional Lunar New Year couplet scroll 春 聯 and Chinese New Year Lantern Ball made of red envelopes.  A business card and takeout menu are both available.",5.0
"We just ordered dinner from here and let's just say Liu's Shanghai will be added to our Sunday Take-out rotation!  We've lived this neighborhood for 20+ years and am glad to have a Shanghainese restaurant added to this thriving 'hood (yes, we were those screaming at the top of our lungs when they finally opened a Starbucks! LOL).  Now if they add a Chiptole... It would be heaven! Food:-Pan fried pork dumplings - it was ok, had better elsewhere and oddly, it didn't come with a dipping sauce... -Fried chicken wings - these were really good! Even as take-out, it was still crispy! Seasoned just right! -Shanghai wonton in peanut & hot sauce - OMGeee, these were freaking ah-mazing! The skin is soft and crispy at the same time, with crunchy crushed peanut.-little bit of everything stir fried rice cake - meh... not the best we've had, possibly because it was take-out, the rice cake became a bit soggy... Still, it lacked flavor.-Preserved cabbage with sliced pork, bean curd and edamame... - I may have ordered the wrong item, so no expectation, it was bland... We added salt to it.Freebies: Tapioca dessert! No complaints, it was complimentary! Yay!  I do love ""tong shui"" so I'm a fan! Total bill: $38 & change... Not bad for the amount of food.  Pretty much standard to this area. Verdict: yes, would order again and will attempt to eat in next time! Happy feasting!",3.0
"Very good, solid food. We ordered the soup dumplings, scallion pancakes, beef tomato egg over rice, and beef with cantonese noodles. While nothing screamed at me ""this is the best ever!"" we really enjoyed everything and cleaned the plates. Staff was prompt and very nice, would definitely go back!",4.0
"This just went into my top 5 places to eat I was so surprised by this placeThe place was so packed on Thursday night that they couldn't even do a delivery. So we decided to walk over since we were already in the mood.The place really was packed and we had to wait maybe 10 min for a table for twoIt's not a big place but it accommodates large parties The staff/waiters were very friendly and apologetic for not being able to deliver. The atmosphere was diner type, clean, calmThere is a large flat screen tv with American programmingThe menu wasn't complicated and had some traditional Chinese American choices The food really surprised me We ordered scallion pancakes, fried wontons in peanut sauce, soup dumplings, twice cooked pork, and general tsaos chickenThese were some delicious and light meals. We obviously over ordered lol but we were eager to try all these items. My only complaint was that the twice cooked pork dish was really not much pork and the pieces that were there were fatty but the rest of the dish was delicious.This is def. a place to bookmark",5.0
"The best in the area--hands down.It's clean, all the meat is lean and when you eat it you don't feel sick/regretful afterwards. It's hard to explain, but the food tastes ""cleaner"" than typical Chinese. Keep in mind though, this isn't really Chinese. You have similar dishes but don't be surprised when they tell you they don't have egg rolls. Their wan ton soup has thin noodles filled with meat and it's not overly salty. Whatever you get, make sure you get their pork fried rice. It's real white rice fried with big pieces of actual tender pork. Not the yellow rice and red pork others call PFR. I love the sesame chicken with white meat only. Sometimes I tell them with no breading even though they don't layer on the breading and skimp with chicken. I order from here 1-2 times a week and the chicken has never once been chewy or 'veiny'. Be careful of chicken like that because it means it's been recooked or it has been sitting out. Nagoya, my old favorite Japanese spot hit me with chicken like that and I had to add them to the ""will never order again"" list. Hope this helps!",5.0
"Looks great after the renovation & new management! The service in the past made me cringe.. I remember the servers weren't attentive and they eternally did not have a smile on their face.. Kudos to better service. Pork Soup Dumplings $4.95 - Hot/satisfying, but was lacking soup compared to the soup dumplings I've tried in Queens and Chinatown. The skin doesn't break easily so no worries there. Crab Meat & Pork Soup Dumplings $6.95 - Yummy! Similar to the pork soup dumplings but lacked adequate soup.Pork & Scallop Soup Dumplings $7.95 - I saw pictures on Facebook and gave it a try--they were OK. Our table enjoyed the dish but didn't rave about it.Fried Wontons in Peanut Butter & Hot Sauce $5.95 - Highly recommended and a favorite on our table! Really can't go wrong with these. The wontons were crispy and fried well. The peanut butter sauce did not make the skin soggy at all. I didn't really taste any hot sauce however.Pork Rice Cake Noodle $6.95 - Why doesn't the menu say mushrooms? (I dislike mushrooms). I'll remember next time to exclude the mushrooms from the dish. Scallion Pancake $2.95 - Crispy, decent appetizer.Overall a solid spot to get your Shanghai fix in Brooklyn. There aren't many Shanghai cuisines and this may be one of the better picks. Definitely give a try if you're local.",4.0
"I LOVE THIS PLACE. I only ever use Yelp as an outlet to write scathing reviews, but this eatery deserves paramount recognition. First of all, you really can't beat the price. My boyfriend and I are regulars and usually order around three appetizers, one entree, and a noodle dish, all of this food comes out to less than $40. In NYC, finding food *that* cheap AND of good quality isn't a common occurrence.  Secondly, the service is so friendly and attentive. You can definitely tell this is a family run restaurant just by the way they treat their costumers. All your food arrives to your table at lighting speed, which is always a plus. Even at the busiest hours, their service is exceptionally fast. On to the food, we ALWAYS order wine chicken (AND YOU SHOULD TOO) and Liu's makes it the best out of all the wine chicken I've ever tasted. And for the rest of our meal, we usually switch it up and order classics like fried dumplings with peanut sauce and hot oil, jellyfish, thick noodles, or fried rice. Everything we have ever ordered here has been so delicious and satiates our Shanghai cuisine craving. I wanna emphasize again, I usually don't write positive reviews. 5 stars all the way :')!",5.0
"Place looks nice, but kind of small. There's a TV, but terrible placement in my opinion. We sat right underneath it and I could see a spot across the room that would've been so much better for everyone.I ordered the Shanghai Style Lo Mein. It was about $7 and the serving was for about 2 people, so it was definitely worth it. It tasted pretty good. My boyfriend ordered Sweet and Sour Chicken, which he said was also good. If you want rice, it's an extra $1 though. But they did serve free dessert.You have a choice between Black Glutinous Rice and Tapioca, both served cold. I wasn't sure which to get, and the waiter offered to serve one of each. I think the rice would have been better served warm, so the Tapioca tasted better out of the two. My boyfriend enjoyed it as well.Service here is pleasant. Our waiter was very friendly and nice. He said he would have the food made however we liked, which was nice to hear. Good food for good value, nice place, great service, I'm likely to come back.",5.0
"For my 100th review I have decided to write about the place that has replaced what was my favorite restaurant for Shanghai style food. So I was shocked and saddened when I showed up and saw the new awning. But had some hope that maybe they just did some renovations. I went in and saw that the place was much cleaner, the walls and floors has been redone and the old man 'waiter' was gone. I looked through the menu and saw that it had definitely changed and was much smaller. So, I asked what happened to the old place. Basically what I was told was that, the previous owners left and the chef had taken over. Or something like that but, Wahoo, same chef. Great News!! Here's the run down. I ordered all my usual stuff. Pork steam bun, fried wonton, etc etc. For the most part the food seems to be of the same quality. So all in all the place is cleaner and nicer, along with much, much better service.",5.0
"This is my go-to place to get my soup dumpling fix when I'm feeling local. I normally order the same few items:FIVE FLAVOR BEEF -- Cold aromatic sliced beef shank made with five different types of spices and soy sauce. This is a staple appetizer for Shanghainese restaurants. SCALLION PANCAKE -- I've eaten my fair share of scallion pancakes and these are on the bottom of my list. It lacked the flaky and crispy texture. Also, the dough was on the thicker side. Skip this. SOUP DUMPLINGS -- Steamed juicy pork buns filled with broth and meat. The waterfall of the broth makes it extra savory. I usually order both the original pork soup dumplings and the crab-meat soup dumplings. I find them a bit inconsistent...some days the crab-meat soup dumplings would have no trace of any crab flavor or crab-meat. FRIED WONTONS w/ HOT SAUCE -- Not even a tad spicy. These fried wontons are perfectly crispy, coated with sugar, and slathered on a chili drizzled, soy-peanut sauce. Well executed and an absolute must! SHANGHAI STYLE LOMEIN -- A mixture of pork, chicken, shrimp, and veggies that are tossed onto plump wheat noodles accompanied with a delicious sauce. Yum.SHREDDRED PORK & PRESERVED VEG. RICE CAKE -- It's not easy work to maintain the soft, chewy texture of rice cakes. This dish was flavorful, hearty, and satisfying. Loved this!The service has improved tremendously under new management. I love how they provide you with a dry-erase menu during your wait; it definitely helps cut down on wait times. Overall, this place serves good Shanghainese food. The soup dumpling broth isn't as rich as the ones in Manhattan or Flushing. However, the location convenience makes up for this.",4.0

Their peanut butter fried wontons and soup dumplings were on point. I was craving soup dumplings but my family didn't want to make the drive to Manhattan. This def took care of my cravings and more. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. The jiajianming (spelling?) noodles and the hot & sour soup were a tad bland but everything else was perfect. Nice touch with the tapioca dessert at the end :D,4.0
"I've been here numerous times and have been disappointed, but this time around, under new management, I wouldn't need to think twice about coming back here again. I came here on a late Sunday afternoon where there was one other table eating. The owner's daughter was our waitress and she was attentive at all times, assisting with taking our orders and other requests we made (like changing the channel so we can watch an NBA game, thank you! :) )We ordered the Crab Meat Soup Dumplings, Pork and Preserved Cabbage Noodle Soup, and the Shanghai Fried Wontons. The Pork and Preserved Cabbage Noodle Soup is a simple noodle soup that comes with clear broth. Personally, I usually get this at any Shanghai restaurant. I really loved this simple noodle soup because it wasn't oily compared to other restaurants I have been to. The soup base was not salty, which is great. The reason why I gave 4/5 Stars is because of the Crab Meat Soup Dumplings, soup. I know it is difficult sometimes when you take out a soup dumpling one at a time and it pops---and all the soup pours out. This was what happened to me. The Crab Meat Soup Dumplings lack a little bit of soup, but the thin, chewy skin and filling made up for the soup as a whole. I love that the sauce (vinegar & soy sauce, I believe) comes in a bottle where you can pour it out yourself and its not given out to you on a small plate. This is a plus!Now to save the best for the last, the Shanghai Fried Wontons---I've only ordered them from this Shanghai restaurant (even before its reopening), and I don't think I will want to order them elsewhere! SO DARN GOOD! Flaky and crunchy skin with a meat filling paired with a peanut sauce & soy sauce dip. MUST ORDER APPETIZER! Overall, I'm really impressed that under a new management, the siblings have taken over the restaurant. The restaurant looks more clean and has a welcoming vibe, unlike before the reopening. The service is much better than before. I love the idea of pouring out the xiao long bao sauce yourself from the bottle. I'd definitely come and visit again. Especially since this is the only Shanghai cuisine by me!",4.0
"Wow! Fantastic food within walking distance from my home. Saved me a ride on the 7 train to Flushing, the D to Chinatown or the N to Sunset Park.

"Small, cozy, authentic Shanghainese family run business. This is a late post, but finally decided to share this hidden gem of Bensonhurst!

"I recently moved back to Brooklyn and was pleasantly surprised to find that there's a Shanghainese restaurant a short train ride away. I've been here twice and I can say their soup dumplings and fish head soup are the standouts.The pan fried dumplings were a bit disappointing. They didn't taste bad but they didn't taste great either. The wrapper was also a bit doughier than my usual go-to Green Bo in Manhattan's Chinatown.The scallion pancake was also very heavy and not particularly flavorful. The flavors of the soup dumplings were well balanced and had plenty of soup. Paired with the ginger and vinegar, divine. I'm not 100% sure they're as good or better than Green Bo's soup dumplings, but they're good enough that I'd come back for more.The fish head soup is a three quart pot of soup so bring friends to share! The broth is savory yet light and comes with rice noodles. The broth has hints of ginger and just a smidge of heat from one or two whole, dried chili pepper. I thought it would be overwhelmingly spicy due to the chili but it was just a hint to rid any fishy taste and balance out the ginger.If you order the fish head soup, order it before everything else because it usually takes a while to make. We ordered it as soon as we walked in and before we were seated so we didn't wait too long for it to come out. Free dessert comes with the meal. You usually have a choice of tapioca pearls with sweet potato or red bean dessert.Plenty of parking nearby. If you come for dinner, there may be a wait if you have a large party.",3.0
"I come here especially for their peanut butter sauce fried dumplings. No other place makes it like they do. That and the shanghai style rice cakes are my favorite.

Their peanut butter fried wontons and soup dumplings were on point. I was craving soup dumplings but my family didn't want to make the drive to Manhattan. This def took care of my cravings and more. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. The jiajianming (spelling?) noodles and the hot & sour soup were a tad bland but everything else was perfect. Nice touch with the tapioca dessert at the end :D,4.0
"I've been here numerous times and have been disappointed, but this time around, under new management, I wouldn't need to think twice about coming back here again. I came here on a late Sunday afternoon where there was one other table eating. The owner's daughter was our waitress and she was attentive at all times, assisting with taking our orders and other requests we made (like changing the channel so we can watch an NBA game, thank you! :) )We ordered the Crab Meat Soup Dumplings, Pork and Preserved Cabbage Noodle Soup, and the Shanghai Fried Wontons. The Pork and Preserved Cabbage Noodle Soup is a simple noodle soup that comes with clear broth. Personally, I usually get this at any Shanghai restaurant. I really loved this simple noodle soup because it wasn't oily compared to other restaurants I have been to. The soup base was not salty, which is great. The reason why I gave 4/5 Stars is because of the Crab Meat Soup Dumplings, soup. I know it is difficult sometimes when you take out a soup dumpling one at a time and it pops---and all the soup pours out. This was what happened to me. The Crab Meat Soup Dumplings lack a little bit of soup, but the thin, chewy skin and filling made up for the soup as a whole. I love that the sauce (vinegar & soy sauce, I believe) comes in a bottle where you can pour it out yourself and its not given out to you on a small plate. This is a plus!Now to save the best for the last, the Shanghai Fried Wontons---I've only ordered them from this Shanghai restaurant (even before its reopening), and I don't think I will want to order them elsewhere! SO DARN GOOD! Flaky and crunchy skin with a meat filling paired with a peanut sauce & soy sauce dip. MUST ORDER APPETIZER! Overall, I'm really impressed that under a new management, the siblings have taken over the restaurant. The restaurant looks more clean and has a welcoming vibe, unlike before the reopening. The service is much better than before. I love the idea of pouring out the xiao long bao sauce yourself from the bottle. I'd definitely come and visit again. Especially since this is the only Shanghai cuisine by me!",4.0

"Use to be Chui Hong Yuan, but under new management with the same chef. The newly renovated place is much cleaner, neat, and more spacious looking. I use to come here every now so and then before it became Liu's Shanghai... But I wasn't a big fan because of the service. The old owners that were always at the front of the house were so unwelcoming and inattentive, but I came anyways for the solid local shanghai food and relatively cheap cost for great portions from here when I was really craving for it. Last month I tested to see if they finally re-opened in hope to get a delivery for my shanghai food cravings, and tada lucky me! I spoke to a very fluent English-speaking gentlemen who even called me back to tell me I get two free desserts with my order. Then I came in the other day to actually dine in and learned that the new front house people are much sweeter people, which is the chef's son & daughter. Sadly, I was informed the chef is the only man back there cooking&prepping so sometimes it could be really hard on him when it starts getting busy. But they're in work with searching for a sous-chef, changing the sign outside too to their new name, and they care about feedbacks for improvement !Some dishes I would recommend:Soup dumplings (xiao long baos) - I use to dislike getting them from here because it was small, cold, and no soup in there at all. But now under new management, it's improving to the way they use to have it when they first ever opened. It was hot, satisfying, and pretty soupy when I had it the other day, which is good enough for my cravings to not have to trek out to the city.Shanghai fried wontons in hot sauce - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! My favorite dish from here, it's fried perfectly with delicious peanut butter sauce, soy sauce and it is actually NOT spicy at all which I prefer since I don't do spice.

"I was craving for some shanghai dumplings and this is the only place in the area that has it. The other place that sells shanghai dumplings is in fei long food court, which is just okay.

We also ordered the scallion pancake. They were great. It has the right crispiness outside and a soft texture in the inside. The hot and sour soup was pretty good. It wasn't diluted and had a variety of ingredients. We had their vegetable dumplings because one of us doesn't eat meat and they were tasty and lightly fried. You can order them steamed too. Still, the shanghai dumplings were passable. It's a quick fix if you don't want to travel outside of Brooklyn.",4.0
"Stopped by to try this place since i learned it was under new mgmt and that the chef stayed the same. Picked up dinner to go.

It gives the restaurant a whole new feel when u walk in. Name has been changed and kind of neat that u can use erasable markers to draw on the restaurants menu for quicker orders (esp for take outs)Service: 5The restaurant is now run by a sister and brother. They were very attentive, running back and forth serving the tables and when they saw people come in, they immediately approached them and was honest abt giving them some time before they get to them. Very polite and good customer service. Definitely beat the father and son who previously owned it!!!!Food: 3/5I was told the cook stayed but.. Im not sure why the food really did not taste the same. The soup dumplings were not as juicy as previously, the hot and sour soup (although was not my fav in this area) does not have any spice in it.. The soup was pretty watered down compared to back then being a slightly thicker texture. And the only other dish we ordered was the peppered steak which the steak had some black char stuck on several pieces and not enough flavoring. I am slightly disappointed but i can see the restaurant is open to feedbacks (they had a huge sign by the register to leave them a review on yelp) and any restaurants who wants to hear feedbacks means theyre willing to work harder.Overall, i will still come back often to try and hopefully the flavors to the dishes will start to come back.",4.0
"Convenient and delicious, Liu's is a great Shanghai restaurant in Bensonhurst. I came here for dinner to catch up with a few old friends and had heard some great reviews from mutual friends. From my visit, I can proudly say that I was not disappointed with what Liu's had to offer. Our appetizers included the Shanghai soup dumplings, fried wontons and scallion pancakes -- all of which were exceptionally well prepared and delicious in their own right. We shared a light entree course of the Shanghai fried rice and rice cakes with mixed seafood -- both of which were authentically prepared and tasted of real Chinese palette. Between four people, this was enough to keep us satisfied throughout the evening. If you need any menu suggestions, allow me to quote one of my best friends: ""Ahhh. You simply can't go wrong with a Shanghai fried rice.""I'm extremely excited Liu's is able to offer great Shanghai tastes without the extensive travel into Chinatown or 8 Avenue. With such affordable prices and a relatively convenient location, they are undoubtedly going to make the lives of a lot of South Brooklynites a whole lot easier (and happier).",4.0
"Shanghainese restaurants are typically known for just their ""xiaolongbaos"" aka soup dumplings and while this place has very fresh, grade A soup dumplings (order the scallop pork ones - it's off the menu), their other dishes are just as delicious for family style meals. I typically get the silky tofu dish with crab meat sauce if you want something light/healthy, or if you're craving a unique appetizer, their fried wontons never disappoint. If you typically love dishes like pork buns or peking duck buns, you'll fall for their ""do pong pork"". The heavenly-marinated pork melts in your mouth sandwiched in the steamed bun. You might want to ask for more buns to go with excess pork at the end. Best advice here? Go hungry. Go with a big group to try more of their eats. And if you're in a big group during the weekend, try to call in early or else, they get booked fast during dinnertime. I've been here 3x already since they've reopened. They're a small place but with tasty dishes and is quickly becoming a local favorite.",5.0

This will be the place I go to whenever I crave soup dumplings from now on in Brooklyn. Doesn't hurt that it only cost 20 dollars for everything.",4.0
"Came here for a short dinner with my dad.We got the pork soup dumplings, crab & pork soup dumplings, and rice cakes with chicken.The soup dumplings were okay, they are smaller and less soupy than Joe's Shanghai's version but still tasty nonetheless. I really liked the rice cakes, enough that I got an another order to go so I could have a late night snack. They are fresh, light, and not oily at all. I would go back there for lunch or dinner the next time I'm in the neighborhood and try more stuff from the menu. Hope they add more soup to the soup dumplings!",4.0
"Just tried this place for the first time and it was perfect. Had Sweet and Sour chicken and my Wife had Beef with Broccoli. We also had an order of spring rolls. Everything was so amazing. Can't ask for a better Chinese food place. Let me also mention this place was super clean inside and the staff was so nice and pleasant. I basically went on Yelp in search of a good Chinese food restaurant and seen this place had great reviews and almost a perfect star rating ,so I'm glad I decided to try it. Exceptional everything. Just basically a clean delicious place that's very satisfying when your in the mood for Chinese food. Defiantly recommend it.",5.0
"I came here to eat dinner with my friends last night. I have to say this restaurant offers the best Shanghai dishes in the area. You would have to go early for seating due to limited seating. This place is extremely small; fitting only 7 tables. 1 big table and 6 medium sized tables. If you have w big party, prepare to wait a while for seats. It gets packed very easily. So be prepared to wait for seats whether you have a big or small party. We ordered our usual favorites - soup dumplings, scallion pancake, and fish head soup. Beware that if you are going to order the fish head soup, call in like 30 minutes prior to your arrival to make sure they still have (limited quantity per day) and if they do, have them make it as this dish takes a very long time to cook and prepare. The soup dumplings are delicious! We ordered the pork and shrimp one. It has just enough stuffings, skin isn't too thick, and just enough soup inside. The scallion pancake is fried just enough that you can't stop from just eating 1 slice. The service is great. The restaurant is very clean and family friendly. Everything is neatly placed and pleasant to the eyes. I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",5.0

"So good!!! Came here on New Year's Day after having an intense craving for Shanghai food. We ordered:- Scallop soup dumplings: did not disappoint.- Crab and pork soup dumplings: I preferred these to the scallop ones and they hit the spot!! They were chockful of filling and soup and were extremely juicy and flavorful. - Scallion pancake: the top two slices were super crispy and went well with the sweet-soy dipping sauce, but the pieces underneath went a little soggy. Still delicious.- Spicy beef noodle soup: great broth. The noodles were cooked a tad too long and didn't have that bite I liked.The servers were friendly and attentive and overall, I would definitely come back (soon).",4.0

XLB shouldn't be for take out but I was desperately craving. The buns came slightly thick skinned and not saucy.  I was expecting it them to be more juicy and explosions in my mouth when I bit in. NOT SO MUCH. This would be a skewed review of that. Will update when I eat in. I also ordered jelly fish but there was no flavor! It was missing some vinegar and pepper. Also felt it wasn't crunchy enough. The portion was huge though. My favorite was the free coconut sago tong sui that came unexpectedly with the meal.

"Shanghai cuisine is one of my favorite cuisines. Now with Liu's Shanghai in Bensonhurst, I have to say I am ever the more in love with this neighborhood!

When you order takeout, you get complimentary sweet soup.

"We were trying to eat local but wanted to try something from our usual spots around the neighborhood.  My husband suggested we look on yelps and see if there is any Shanghainese spots around and this place popped up.  At first my husband said it wasn't all that because he drove by all the time and told his friend one day to try it out but was in no rush to because it wasnt too decorated.  I saw that this place has two names showed up with the same address and learned it was renovated and the new reviews were good based on it, we called to make sure they were open and took the chance to go.  First impression upon arriving wasn't too bad because there were few tables eating there.  Thank god we arrived early because it got busy as time passed.  The chef who is now the owner has his children in the front.  The son is behind the register and daughter is the waitress.  They were very attentive and nice.We ordered: crab meat pork soup dumpling, it was filling and the juices stayed upon you biting into the skin.  You can definitely taste the crab meat.-smoked duck, the skin was crispy and duck was not too dry when you bite into the meat -dong po pork, comes with 4 steam buns you normally get when you order peking duck in other chinese restaurants.  The presentation was perfection when the dish was serve.  Some places makes it all sloppy.  Now to the tasting, its delicious and i do not ever eat fats on meat whatsoever but this was so good i do not mind. The fat just melts in your mouth and it was flavorful.  You can put in the steam buns or get a bowl of rice and dig in.  If i wasn't so full from everything we ordered i would of devoured the whole dish myself.-crab meat hot and sour soup, this is definitely something to order because not many places make it good like this. Its not too spicy you cant take.  Once you sip into it your mouth just wants more and more and you wont be able to stop.  They have vermicelli in there that resembles shark fin. Heres a funny story how we found this soup. If anyone remembered in chinatown where the Confucius statues are there was a little dinky restaurant name ""Goodies"" and this was the one soup i fell in love with from that place but it has since shut down 7 years ago, i was pregnant at the time and i had cravings for this soup so bad and my husband deprived me of it and everyone knows you never deny a prego what they want because they will give you a stye.  So i never got my fixed. Till this day i give my husband grief ever since and he was looking at the menu and something told him this has some connection to that place and decided asked his daughter again and she told us her dad used to work there and now he is owner here. My husband said dead give away was from their dessert menu because its very distinct and not a lot of places make their desserts and same name to it.  I was sooo filled with joy when i found out one of my most favorite Shanghainese restaurant is back and so close to home!-little bit of everything (thick noodles), this is also a fave when eating  Shanghainese.  The dish came and it was twice the amount we normally get in usual spots in city and this was half the price.  The presentation itself look like it was gonna be drench in soy sauce and cant taste anything.  First bite into it and surprisingly it was not heavily overwhelming in soy sauce and it was in fact light not salty at all.  My husband's fave he ended up eating most it andmy daughter ended up eating all of hers as well. -dessert we got shanghai red bean rice ball in sweet soup, this has a slight touch of rice wine but you hardly taste it.   The soup was not heavily sweetened like others and if you have room you can drink the soup too. They also gave us complimentary sweet soup as well.  We had the tapioca with taro and black glutinous soup.  There were plenty of taro and tapioca in the bowl and my daughter hardly eats taro and she ended up eating the whole bowl.  The black glutinous soup was alot too.  Normally when they give you free desserts it tends to be watered down but this was plentiful and would order it if i am craving for any.  I would suggest the red bean pankcake and the sweet ball soup.Their food is really good and it is not heavily seasoned like other places.  I didnt taste any MSG where i am cosntantly grabbing my cup of tea and be full within first few bites of food.  I was able enjoy my meal and eat most of the way without drinking water. Overall i am very pleased with this place and would definitely go again especially knowing the chef is now the owner of this place and was working in ""Goodies"" and definitely brought the nostalgic feeling back.  Best part you dont have to drive to the city for authentic Shanghainese food.   It wont cost you an arm and a leg either.   My husband's fave part is now he can shut me up about owing me the soup i never got 7yrs ago and now we can come regularly instead of usual 86th street spots under the D line.",5.0

"TLDR: This is my friend's rating of the place.food: 8/10service: 8/10decor: 10/10Now here's mine:After a long day of stuffing my face at Mitsuwa for lunch and doing manly things in New Jersey, I crossed the Verrazano looking for the 62nd Precinct, the mythical landmark my friend used to direct me toward this establishment. No, not ""the corner of Bath and 19th."" That would be too simple. ""Just head over to the 62nd precinct, it's 2 blocks to the left of it. It's the only Chinese place with a red awning."" Those were my directions. Needless to say, it was my first time there, but I found it.Purple nurples make people hungry, I made the executive decision to get one order of soup dumplings per person (5 total), along with the jellyfish, kao fu, scallion pancake, and wontons in hot sauce. My directionally challenged friend ordered the twice cooked pork. He made the wrong choice, as we ate all the mushrooms and meat, leaving him with the carrots and cabbage. He also thought we got too much. How wrong he was. Onto the food.I got the crab and pork dumplings and they were great. I usually don't enjoy the crab ones as the crab's flavor overpowers the other flavors of the dumplings, but I thought it was just right over here. Do I care about thin skins? Nope, because that means the dumplings break and spill the juicy deliciousness. But the skin's thickness was perfect in that it was thick enough not to break, but thin enough not to be chewy. I was hit with a moment of disappointment with the wontons. I was expecting it to be spicy, but they're actually sweet. The disappointment left a split second later when my tongue overruled my brain with how delicious the wontons were.The discussion we had over the origins of the jellyfish salad did not take away from its deliciousness. Do I care where the jellyfish came from? Do I care if it was real or not? I should, but when things taste good, I tend not to worry about minor details. Case in point: foie gras. But it was real jellyfish, according to my goldfish friend. I've never had jellyfish outside of restaurants. I've never taken a bite of jellyfish when I've gone spearfishing. So I wouldn't be able to tell you. Kao fu was sweet and chewy. Not much I can say about it, except that I always thought it was tofu. I was wrong. Twice cooked pork comes with mushrooms. The mushrooms are delicious. The pork is delicious. I'm just putting this in to remind my friend who looks like a 12 year old that the dish he ordered and didn't get to eat because he talks too much was delicious.The disappointing dish though, was the scallion pancake. I personally thought it wasn't crispy enough, and it needed more scallions in it. It just tasted like fried, flat dough (and not in a good, roti way). The sauce helps, but it was just average at best.Would I come here again? I sure would. I'd probably tell the guy to make my spicy wontons more spicy though.",4.0
I like how this place is so family-oriented. I like how the food has similar flavors to the past management as it is not too salty. I really recommend this place as it is one of my favorite places to eat at in Brooklyn.,5.0
"Good service and food came pretty quick. Ordered fried wonton with peanut sauce (to die for), pork soup dumplings, scallop soup dumplings, stir fried rice cake shanghai style, and slow cooked pork belly. The pork soup dumplings are good, not a fan of the scallop ones. The shanghai style rice cakes are missing the salty spicy pickled vegetables, I was looking forward to it. The pork belly was awesome, so very tender. Great place for a quick meal.",3.0
"I've been eating here since I was a kid and when the restaurant closed for renovations, I was really worried that things wouldn't be the same. The previous retired and the chef's son and daughter have since taken over. I am really thankful that this place is in a random part of Brooklyn, so it is unlikely to turn into a tourist trap like Joe's Shanghai. Unless, of course, a shanghainese restaurant is the catalyst for an entire neighborhood to turn into the next commercial hub. That would be cool too. I'm tempted to give this place a bad review so I can lower the ratings and keep it a secret for myself. But that wouldn't be kind. This place is easily my favorite place in all of New York City for soup dumplings. The flavors are authentic and rich and every bite reminds me of home. I can't wait for this small restaurant to knock down the wall and purchase the thrift shop next door. The only con is how small the restaurant is and how long you have to wait for a table if you don't time your arrival correctly.",5.0

"Just had lunch here with my friend. A bit busy for a Sunday but got seats right away. Service was great. Condiments and menu came right away. Didn't have to wait long for our food to come either.I got my usual that I get from shanghai spots. I had the spicy beef w/ noodle soup and shared a pork steamed bun w/ my friend. My friend had shrimp w/ lobster sauce on rice. We also had the shanghai fried wonton which was recommended and it was delicious definitely will get that again.Overall it was a great experience. The food was on point. The setting is nice, comfortable and clean. Nice and spacious. Perfect for small parties and family dinners. Definitely a go to spot if you're trying to get a taste of shanghai especially, for me since I'm local.",5.0

Soup dumplings were tasty. The skin wasn't too thin or thick. There's just the right amount of flavor. Honestly, their soup dumplings are better than Joe Shanghai. I had the jellyfish, fried wonton in peanut & hot sauce, and the crab meat hot and sour soup. EVERYTHING was delicious. I love the crab meat hot and sour soup. Food is meant for sharing since everything was served family style. I will be returning whenever I have a craving for soup dumplings!",5.0
"It's been a while since I've paid a visit here with my family. And yet, it still does not disappoint. A friend and I came on a Thursday afternoon since we were craving some Shanghainese food, and we weren't about to go to Joe's in Chinatown because of the longer commute. To my surprise, the restaurant was empty. I mean, it is lunchtime, right? I expected a lot of people, since this place has top notch reviews on yelp. The service was friendly, they didn't bother us too much or push us to leave, since I've had that experience at more crowded restaurants like Joe's Shanghai. We opted for two plates of crab meat and pork soup dumplings, and one plate of the fried wontons with peanut sauce and chili oil. And I have to say, not much has changed since I came here a couple of years ago. They definitely renovated, so the environment feels much more pleasant and homey. Anyway, let's get back to the main point. The food was so bomb. If you're scared about the fried wontons being spicy, you shouldn't be. You taste more of the peanut and soy sauce with a little sugar on top, so it's great for sweet toothers! The crab meat and pork soup dumplings were bursting with flavor and oozing with soup, and it makes my mouth water as I write this. The most important thing about cooking soup dumplings is not to overcook it, or else the dough falls apart and the soup leaks out, leaving you with just a dumpling. However at Liu's, I did not experience this problem. Out of 16 dumplings, only one had its soup leak out, and this was because I was lazy and didn't use the plastic tongs. USE THEM if you don't want to puncture the dumpling!! Honestly, I don't know what was better, the fried wontons or the soup dumplings, but I could go for both right now. Best of all, it wasn't even expensive! We shelled out about $12 each for two people, and at that price, we were preeeetty stuffed.The thing that separates this place and other Shanghainese restaurants is probably their location. Since everyone's leaning more towards the Joe's Shanghai locations in the city, this place is not very well known. However, I'm really glad that my family found this place out, since this will now be my go-to spot for traditional Shanghainese food. If you're closer to here than the Joe's Shanghai in Chinatown, save yourself the trip. GO HERE!! Five stars, six if I could. :)",5.0
My family comes here when we crave for Shanghaiese food.  We love the fish head soup and the crab hot sour soup.  The soup dumplings and fried wontons are also awesome. The service is much better now with new ownership.,5.0
"TLDR: This is my friend's rating of the place.food: 8/10service: 8/10decor: 10/10Now here's mine:After a long day of stuffing my face at Mitsuwa for lunch and doing manly things in New Jersey, I crossed the Verrazano looking for the 62nd Precinct, the mythical landmark my friend used to direct me toward this establishment. No, not ""the corner of Bath and 19th."" That would be too simple. ""Just head over to the 62nd precinct, it's 2 blocks to the left of it. It's the only Chinese place with a red awning."" Those were my directions. Needless to say, it was my first time there, but I found it.Purple nurples make people hungry, I made the executive decision to get one order of soup dumplings per person (5 total), along with the jellyfish, kao fu, scallion pancake, and wontons in hot sauce. My directionally challenged friend ordered the twice cooked pork. He made the wrong choice, as we ate all the mushrooms and meat, leaving him with the carrots and cabbage. He also thought we got too much. How wrong he was. Onto the food.I got the crab and pork dumplings and they were great. I usually don't enjoy the crab ones as the crab's flavor overpowers the other flavors of the dumplings, but I thought it was just right over here. Do I care about thin skins? Nope, because that means the dumplings break and spill the juicy deliciousness. But the skin's thickness was perfect in that it was thick enough not to break, but thin enough not to be chewy. I was hit with a moment of disappointment with the wontons. I was expecting it to be spicy, but they're actually sweet. The disappointment left a split second later when my tongue overruled my brain with how delicious the wontons were.The discussion we had over the origins of the jellyfish salad did not take away from its deliciousness. Do I care where the jellyfish came from? Do I care if it was real or not? I should, but when things taste good, I tend not to worry about minor details. Case in point: foie gras. But it was real jellyfish, according to my goldfish friend. I've never had jellyfish outside of restaurants. I've never taken a bite of jellyfish when I've gone spearfishing. So I wouldn't be able to tell you. Kao fu was sweet and chewy. Not much I can say about it, except that I always thought it was tofu. I was wrong. Twice cooked pork comes with mushrooms. The mushrooms are delicious. The pork is delicious. I'm just putting this in to remind my friend who looks like a 12 year old that the dish he ordered and didn't get to eat because he talks too much was delicious.The disappointing dish though, was the scallion pancake. I personally thought it wasn't crispy enough, and it needed more scallions in it. It just tasted like fried, flat dough (and not in a good, roti way). The sauce helps, but it was just average at best.Would I come here again? I sure would. I'd probably tell the guy to make my spicy wontons more spicy though.",4.0
I like how this place is so family-oriented. I like how the food has similar flavors to the past management as it is not too salty. I really recommend this place as it is one of my favorite places to eat at in Brooklyn.,5.0
"Good service and food came pretty quick. Ordered fried wonton with peanut sauce (to die for), pork soup dumplings, scallop soup dumplings, stir fried rice cake shanghai style, and slow cooked pork belly. The pork soup dumplings are good, not a fan of the scallop ones. The shanghai style rice cakes are missing the salty spicy pickled vegetables, I was looking forward to it. The pork belly was awesome, so very tender. Great place for a quick meal.",3.0
"I've been eating here since I was a kid and when the restaurant closed for renovations, I was really worried that things wouldn't be the same. The previous retired and the chef's son and daughter have since taken over. I am really thankful that this place is in a random part of Brooklyn, so it is unlikely to turn into a tourist trap like Joe's Shanghai. Unless, of course, a shanghainese restaurant is the catalyst for an entire neighborhood to turn into the next commercial hub. That would be cool too. I'm tempted to give this place a bad review so I can lower the ratings and keep it a secret for myself. But that wouldn't be kind. This place is easily my favorite place in all of New York City for soup dumplings. The flavors are authentic and rich and every bite reminds me of home. I can't wait for this small restaurant to knock down the wall and purchase the thrift shop next door. The only con is how small the restaurant is and how long you have to wait for a table if you don't time your arrival correctly.",5.0

"Just had lunch here with my friend. A bit busy for a Sunday but got seats right away. Service was great. Condiments and menu came right away. Didn't have to wait long for our food to come either.I got my usual that I get from shanghai spots. I had the spicy beef w/ noodle soup and shared a pork steamed bun w/ my friend. My friend had shrimp w/ lobster sauce on rice. We also had the shanghai fried wonton which was recommended and it was delicious definitely will get that again.Overall it was a great experience. The food was on point. The setting is nice, comfortable and clean. Nice and spacious. Perfect for small parties and family dinners. Definitely a go to spot if you're trying to get a taste of shanghai especially, for me since I'm local.",5.0

"Had Sunday dinner here around 6pm. Good service . not packed. Wanted to give it 3 stars for making me sit near a man with nauseating body odor, but that wasn't their fault.  My experience was slightly ruined due to no fault of establishment.  Soup dumplings had a lot of meat. Husband liked that but I personally prefer more equal soup to meat ratio in my soup dumplings.

"So glad I don't have to trek all the way to the city to satisfy a xlb craving. Pro-tip: get the Shanghai wontons. They're essentially fried wontons drizzled w this peanut butter/hot sauce concoction topped w some peanuty dust. It's crack. No, I legit think the peanuty dust they sprinkled on these is crackcocaine bc I'm addicted and think abt them all the time.",5.0
"A friend recommend this place to me because of their wings so I came by one day after a hangover with a couple of people and decided to try them along with their dumplings.Their wings have a different flavor to them unlike any other Chinese restaurant I've ever been to and their dumplings are on par, if not better than any gimmicky place such as Joe's Shanghai. Their prices are very reasonable and the customer service is excellent, constantly ensuring I had a fresh pot of tea. There is also plenty of street parking around the area. I didn't try anything except the wings and dumplings but the friends I was with had a few different dishes and they all approved of me suggesting the place.",4.0

"Visiting friends & family in Brooklyn and it was too hot & muggy to cook or go out. Found Liu's Shanghai based on the good reviews so good friend jumped on the subway to bring back takeout.Shanghai wonton in hot sauce was unusual but very unique & tasty. Usually boiled & served in a spicy sesame sauce. The Liu's fried their with same sauce but the wontons were slightly rolled in a dry crushed peanut & sugar mix. Unusual but it works and the pork filling was very fresh so it was delicious. The fried dumplings were also delicious & served with a garlicky vinaigrette. We also shared noodles with chicken, shrimp, pork in lobster sauce. Add a little red chilli sauce & black vinegar and it's fantastic.  The noodles in spicy meat sauce was sweet & spicy and the Liu's cook their noodles very well. I've boycotted Joe's Shanghai because you can crack a window with their noodles. Some places over cook their noodles so it's a sticky mess and you can't mix it properly. Bravo to you Mr. Liu for getting your noodles right. And the Kau Fu was delicious, a little bit too sweet but they score points for the lovely tender texture. I've had this in 2 other places and it's always  been a chewy sponge like texture. Bonus points! For the $36.00 worth of food we purchased, we found 1 complimentary scallion pancake and 2 small containers of coconut tapioca dessert soup. Even the free stuff was flavorful & no skimping on ingredients. Friend says she hopes The Liu's prosper & do well without losing their perspective on ingredients. Not that many good tasting Shanghai style restaurants in this side of Brooklyn. Other 2 friends said same & will head straight to Liu's next time for soup dumplings.",5.0

Love them and can't wait to go back here for more!(Only thing I disliked... the outside of the restaurant looks kind of dingy, although the interior is quite nice.

Been coming to this place for the past few weeks with my wife. We love the service and the food. My wife and I like different spice level of the hot and sour soup and both of us get exactly what we want. We love the hot and sour soup and the attention and appreciation we receive as customers. We also tried some other dishes (general tso's chicken and beef with Chinese hot pepper) and they were excellent. Definitely one of the best places in the area.,5.0
"I am ok with their food and their service most of the times. But I went there on a Thursday night with my family of four and we were ignored. We had two young kids and they needed food. We only received one of our four dishes and the one that came was the soup buns which was not enough food. There was a family of three that came in at the same time and they received all their food. There were people coming in to order take out and they received their food before us, a family of four with two young kids. After more than 30 minutes of waiting we decide to have the rest of our order to go! I was so disgusted that I didn't even bother to get my change. I hope this is not an average occurrence. The brother and sister team was just disorganized when it got too busy. I hope they hirer an additional waiter on those busy times or they will start to see business sharply decline.",3.0
"We went to this restaurant for lunch, due to the good ratings from fellow yelpers.  The place is clean and fairly empty at 2:30 on a Thursday.  There were two other tables dining at this time.  We ordered the crab and pork soup dumplings and and an order of Seafood noodles.  The soup dumplings lacked the inside soup and the skin was a bit on the thick side.  The ""seafood noodles"" are what I call a ""catch the pig"" dish.  Couple of tiny shrimp, bits of squid and sliced FISH BALLS!  I was hoping this restaurant would be a hidden gem, but it is just another take out place.  Not recommended.",3.0
"Formerly known as Chui Hong Yuan, now new brother and sister duo management but chef remains the same. Just stopped by the other night and the place is newly renovated. Frequented this restaurant for years and food was great per usual and received kind service. Had their meatballs soup and it was delicious. XLB is the same and we like the juice it contains in the small size, just the right amount of dough. Always enjoyed their rice cakes and scallion pancake. Will stop by more often this neighborhood restaurant.*updated review: don't appreciate that if an item is not available, we should be told to choose another dish. Arrived at location for takeout pickup and only AFTER paying, did we discover ourselves that the dish had been replaced with something entirely different. Not cool. It was our haste to leave and the new year that we just let it go.",3.0
Well this evening I I'm not feeling well and decided to get soup and when I'm sick I love egg drop soup so I decided to come here always read and hears about so me and my son said today is the day. The guy and girl that were at the front were so nice really cool I think he said his name was bailey (sorry bro if I got your name wrong) we felt very welcomed when the the greeted us! I ordered a large egg drop soup (hit the spot) and my son ordered General Tso chicken with beef fried rice and it was so good and fresh! I will be ordering here again and again and again,5.0

"I have gone to Liu's Shanghai a couple of times and I can honestly say that each time, the service provided was impeccable. It's always a full house the past couple of times I've been there but I was always persistent to wait because they provide such great customer service and to top it off, their soup dumplings are seriously amazing. There is one situation I feel is very important to address. To start off, the menu has a HUGE variety of options to choose from and being the indecisive person that I am, I couldn't decide what type of dishes/appetizers I would like to have for the night. The waitress who took my order was very thorough with describing the dishes. Not only that, but the waitress had asked me, ""What type of dish are you looking for? Noodles, rice dish, etc..."" At that moment, I was in awe. Usually even in 4 star restaurants, waiters/waitresses would just tell you their ""special for the day"" and then resume to asking you what you would like to have. They don't waste any time to ask what type of dish you might be leaning more towards for the night nor do they have the time of day to elicit a minimal conversation. Like I said, it was a full house! There was another table waiting to order but the waitress still made sure to give me the best service possible by taking the time to answer all my questions. Any customer would want a waitress/waiter's undivided attention when it's their turn and I feel that, that is very important in gaining new customers + returning customers. Another thing I noticed was that there was another waiter working and he consistently refilled my tea without me having to ask! Usually, waiters are never aware of the little things like filling up a cup of water and so forth but these little things add up to the great experience and It is safe to say that Liu's Shanghai provides all the little details to make your experience the best possible! Now, let's talk about the food! The food came pretty quick! My soup dumplings came first and right after I was done, my fried peanut butter wontons followed. Let me tell you. These are the best wontons you'll ever taste if you're into a sweet & salty combination! I order 2 of these dishes every time I visit and there are 10 wontons on each plate! They're just THAT delightful! My main entree was also great. One of the best entrees I've had there would definitely be the stir fried rice cake with shredded pork and mushrooms! It is a MUST TRY. To keep this ""kind of"" short and nice, I felt that the waiter & the waitress definitely prioritized well! They keep their customers happy and always make sure all the food are served in a timely manner! I haven't had one bad experience yet and I can't wait to stop by soon!",5.0

The brother and sister team was just disorganized when it got too busy. I hope they hirer an additional waiter on those busy times or they will start to see business sharply decline.",3.0
"We went to this restaurant for lunch, due to the good ratings from fellow yelpers.  The place is clean and fairly empty at 2:30 on a Thursday.  There were two other tables dining at this time.  We ordered the crab and pork soup dumplings and and an order of Seafood noodles.  The soup dumplings lacked the inside soup and the skin was a bit on the thick side.  The ""seafood noodles"" are what I call a ""catch the pig"" dish.  Couple of tiny shrimp, bits of squid and sliced FISH BALLS!  I was hoping this restaurant would be a hidden gem, but it is just another take out place.  Not recommended.",3.0
"Formerly known as Chui Hong Yuan, now new brother and sister duo management but chef remains the same. Just stopped by the other night and the place is newly renovated. Frequented this restaurant for years and food was great per usual and received kind service. Had their meatballs soup and it was delicious. XLB is the same and we like the juice it contains in the small size, just the right amount of dough. Always enjoyed their rice cakes and scallion pancake. Will stop by more often this neighborhood restaurant.*updated review: don't appreciate that if an item is not available, we should be told to choose another dish. Arrived at location for takeout pickup and only AFTER paying, did we discover ourselves that the dish had been replaced with something entirely different. Not cool. It was our haste to leave and the new year that we just let it go.",3.0
Well this evening I I'm not feeling well and decided to get soup and when I'm sick I love egg drop soup so I decided to come here always read and hears about so me and my son said today is the day. The guy and girl that were at the front were so nice really cool I think he said his name was bailey (sorry bro if I got your name wrong) we felt very welcomed when the the greeted us! I ordered a large egg drop soup (hit the spot) and my son ordered General Tso chicken with beef fried rice and it was so good and fresh! I will be ordering here again and again and again,5.0

"I have gone to Liu's Shanghai a couple of times and I can honestly say that each time, the service provided was impeccable. It's always a full house the past couple of times I've been there but I was always persistent to wait because they provide such great customer service and to top it off, their soup dumplings are seriously amazing. There is one situation I feel is very important to address. To start off, the menu has a HUGE variety of options to choose from and being the indecisive person that I am, I couldn't decide what type of dishes/appetizers I would like to have for the night. The waitress who took my order was very thorough with describing the dishes. Not only that, but the waitress had asked me, ""What type of dish are you looking for? Noodles, rice dish, etc..."" At that moment, I was in awe. Usually even in 4 star restaurants, waiters/waitresses would just tell you their ""special for the day"" and then resume to asking you what you would like to have. They don't waste any time to ask what type of dish you might be leaning more towards for the night nor do they have the time of day to elicit a minimal conversation. Like I said, it was a full house! There was another table waiting to order but the waitress still made sure to give me the best service possible by taking the time to answer all my questions. Any customer would want a waitress/waiter's undivided attention when it's their turn and I feel that, that is very important in gaining new customers + returning customers. Another thing I noticed was that there was another waiter working and he consistently refilled my tea without me having to ask! Usually, waiters are never aware of the little things like filling up a cup of water and so forth but these little things add up to the great experience and It is safe to say that Liu's Shanghai provides all the little details to make your experience the best possible! Now, let's talk about the food! The food came pretty quick! My soup dumplings came first and right after I was done, my fried peanut butter wontons followed. Let me tell you. These are the best wontons you'll ever taste if you're into a sweet & salty combination! I order 2 of these dishes every time I visit and there are 10 wontons on each plate! They're just THAT delightful! My main entree was also great. One of the best entrees I've had there would definitely be the stir fried rice cake with shredded pork and mushrooms! It is a MUST TRY. To keep this ""kind of"" short and nice, I felt that the waiter & the waitress definitely prioritized well! They keep their customers happy and always make sure all the food are served in a timely manner! I haven't had one bad experience yet and I can't wait to stop by soon!",5.0

"I've only experienced the shanghai restaurants around Manhattan chinatown and it was never anything too special but after trying out this spot, I don't know if I could ever eat at other shanghai restaurants again!I came here with a couple of coworkers and we decided to order a couple of things on the menu and share. What we ordered: Soup dumplings, Shanghai wontons in hot sauce, scallion pancake, fried chicken wings, and chicken lo mein. If there's anything you MUST try when you come here, it'll definitely be the shanghai wontons in hot sauce and the fried chicken wings (yes, fried chicken wings!!!). The wontons were a perfect combination of sweet and savory that might seem overwhelming to look at but definitely not overwhelming in taste. We liked it so much that we ordered it again after devouring the first plate! Also, it might sound silly to order fried chicken wings here but if you love fried chicken, you should definitely give it a try!As for the service, I have no complaints. The servers were attentive without making us feel rushed or smothered in any way and I appreciate that a lot. The food also came in a timely matter which was great because I was starving that day.Overall, I gave 5 stars because I had a really great experience here. The food was good, the service was great, and this restaurant really has a nice atmosphere. My only complaint is the commute since I live in manhattan but honestly, I would endure the long train ride just to have those wontons again!",5.0
the new owners that took over the old business are doing it right!!!  come here at once and get your grub on!!!,5.0
Been going here a while now that me and my buddies were looking for a regular spot for soup dumplings without traveling to flushing! Super affordable and we usually eat like kings for under $40 bucks. It's nice it's a family owned business and I always appreciate the synergy that is very apparent here. I believe Billy is the gentlemen who is behind the counter who seats our party whom I find very personable. Love that guy. His sister who is very cute (never caught her name) is usually our waitress and sometimes makes suggestions on the things we order and we haven't had any bad dishes yet! Can't wait to go back.,5.0
"I decided have lunch here with a friend after having been here a year or so ago; the difference is recently the owner chef's daughter (Elisa a dear friend of mine) runs the restaurant front with her brother, and they have a newly renovated interior. Although I know the chef has stayed the same through my acquaintance with Elisa, I still had a better dining experience than the previous time I ate here. The tables and utensils were much neater and the restaurant just had the perfect vibe that prepared you for the food that was to come.We ordered the famous xiao long baos, steamed pot sticker soup dumplings. They were juicy and hit the spot, it's what I want every time I have Shanghainese food. In addition, by Elisa's recommendation, we had fried wontons with a peanut butter sauce, and fish head casserole. The fried wontons were soo good, oozing with flavourful sauce that didn't take away from the delicious crispiness of the wonton. The casserole was still bubbling when it arrived at our table--the broth looked so good I wanted to bathe in it. Okay maybe not lol but it was an opaque milky color, almost like it was milk actually. Then you taste a spoonful of this, and it does not dissapoint. It is a rich heart warming soup with translucent sheet like noodle. You can tell that all the flavours of the ingredients have taken time to immerse and the noodles have a glassy look that really appeals to the dish.We were famished upon arriving at the restaurant but by the time we were done eating (with soup from the casserole to take home) our bellies were super fulfilled. I'm so glad to have access to Shanghainese cuisine in Bensonhurst, and surely a fine one. With the variety on their menu, I could literally eat here every day. Definitely come here to exceedingly satisfy your xiao long bao craving!",5.0
