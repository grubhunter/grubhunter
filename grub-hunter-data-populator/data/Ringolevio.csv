"Ringolevio is a true star when it comes to Italian/Meditterranean cuisine in Brooklyn and for that matter, New York City. With Italian restaurants, you get all sorts of interpretations to classics and while does that, Ringolevio makes the food the number one priority.It is in an area of Greenpoint you wouldn't expect such a restaurant would be since it's in more of a residential area. There isn't much foot traffic so they're closed for lunch which is a bummer but weekend brunch and weeknight dinners are so on.The crostini across the board are all excellent. There 7 to choose from and you can get all 6 for $16 or 3 for$ 9. Both times I've been here I've ordered the crostini to share with my friend I can tell you the artichoke hearts with shaved parmesan and parsley is absolutely delicious. Second favorite would the breasola, gorgonzola, and almond one. Simple quality ingredients and they all resonate in a bite. Honestly just try them all because they're all great.As for the mains, the meat lasagna with bolognese sauce is mouthwateringly good. The pasta is cooked to perfection (as all their dishes are) and the bolognese is rich but doesn't way you down. The special that I had with tagliatelle, broccoli rabe, and Italian sausage was just as good. Bitter, spicy, cheesy. Did I mention the prices here are on point? For the value and quality of the dishes, I can only imagine if Ringolevio was in Manhattan instead of Brooklyn. The service here is also great and both times I've received some dessert wine on the house. It's a medium-sized restaurant and its more compact with the decor but there are flourishes of Italian modernism and rustic countryside dark woods. It's best for small groups no larger than four due to its size.Ringolevio is a must try if you're in the area and want a fantastic dinner. They won't let you down. Happy eating and remember: Don't deny, satisfy!",5.0
"This is my absolute favorite restaurant in Brooklyn... Food, ambiance, friendly service, always great music,  (it's even got the best bathroom!). It's dimly lit, with a bar and maybe 10 tables, the place is always vibrant, and their clientele is young, stylish and attractive... The cream of the Williamsburg/Greenpoint crop (if that's what you're into). People come in to eat, but also to sit at the bar, there is an excellent wine selection, which is a huge draw as well. It's a good place for both casual and professional meet-ups (on the chill/relaxing tip), and the atmosphere is suited to both. Perfect place to bring a date,  the food and wine is not prohibitively expensive, which only helps, and definitely encourages you to return for more.Their menu offers a variety of dishes, including vegetarian options. Their vegetarian lasagna, with eggplant substituting for pasta layers, is incredible, and the pasta dishes (handmade pasta) all have the option of bolognese (beef+pork, I believe) or arrabiata. They have a rotating array of specials, which are always creative and delicious (I recently had a spaghetti dish with julienne carrots and squash, and loved it). The skirt steak (with seasonal vegetables) is also a strong recommendation, and the trio of grass fed mini burgers, with fontina cheese, caramelized onions, and choice of vegetable side (recently has the broccoli rabe) is great to share. I am obsessed with the Tiramisu, and I'm not normally a desert person, but this one is perfect. It's got a coffee kick, which I love.More recently I've recently become friendly with the owners and staff (I've been there regularly since I found it a few months ago), and in such an intimate environment, that really adds a level of familiarity and comfort which you can't find many places.Five stars, I would give more if I could. It's right on  the corner of Humboldt st and Richardson st., so it's a 10-15 minute walk from the Bedford L, close to McGolric park, and about 6 blocks from the Graham L train.Definitely stop in and enjoy!",5.0
"Came here for a family brunch. The place is a pretty unassuming cafe on Humboldt St, and was apparently very well-known for their brunch. When we first arrived, it was about half-empty, but by the end of our meal, it was pretty packed, with people waiting outside. The brunch menu has your standard egg dishes, while also having some random pasta dishes, like lasagnas, which was kind of confusing, but apparently it's a popular dish, so who am I to say anything?Ordered the smoked salmon benedict. It came out pretty nicely, with a ton of smoked salmon, expertly poached egg, sauteed spinach, and some creamy hollandaise. However, the ""salad"" I received wasn't dressed, and the spinach was kinda dry, and not very appetizing. My nephew really enjoyed the waffles and french toast, and given that he can be somewhat of a picky eater, it's quite an accomplishment. The dish was only $14, but I did assume that I'd at least get some home fries or something.Service was very friendly, kind, and very accommodating to my toddler nephew, albeit a touch on the slow side. We probably waited about half an hour for our food to come out, but it all came out pretty well. Prices are about $12-15 per dish, and while it's not the most outstanding quality, it's serviceable and will fill you up.Can't say I would come here over other places, but it's a solid option in the area. Between here and Harefield Road nearby, I'd just go to the restaurant that's less crowded.",3.0
"One of my new favorite spots in all of Brooklyn! I was highly impressed by the overall service, decor, the freshness of food, and the affordable prices. The owner Paul was very welcoming and told me about the history of the restaurant. The decor is very cute and whimsical. It's like all of the unique decor you would buy at a Salvation Army or an overpriced thrift store and put in your house. I promise you the ambiance is cozy with candles and the perfect place you would bring a date. The tables and the bar are made from reclaimed wood from an old bowling alley. For $19 I bought a grass fed grilled skirt steak, mashed potatoes and seasonal farm fresh vegetables. It was absolutely delicious! I have been here numerous times and always loved my experience! Even for brunch is was wonderful.",5.0
I wasn't expecting this place to be so good. We couldn't decide what to order because everything sounded so good so we kind of ordered a bit of everything. And it was as good as it sounded. The way this place is decorated is mismatched furniture and it gives the place so much character. We love this place!,5.0
"I came for brunch on New Year's Day with A and another couple. I really enjoyed my bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich and though I really wish I had home fries, I'm glad that it came with apples and a salad instead since it's much healthier. I wasn't a fan of our friend's chicken in the chicken and waffles but the waffles were good. I would definitely skip the trio of burgers next time since they were dry and charred and I unfortunately insisted on ordering them.",4.0
"This place was so much fun. Great background music. I had the peach mimosa and it was just what I needed to start my birthday off. I order the french toast kabobs and that was the most slamming meal I ever had. It was so good with the fruits, the scrabbled eggs, and bacon. The best part was that their menu is a marble composition notebook. Sooooo cute and funny.",4.0
"This place was a really cute restaurant for bunch.  Great food and friendly and attentive staff.   It was a significant struggle trying to decide between the lox Benedict and the chicken and waffles but, luckily,  as my friend was similarly torn we split both.  Highly recommend both dishes but the chicken and waffles won by a hair.",4.0
"Started the night horribly across the street at another Italian restaurant.  We had a reservation there but after walking in they seemed to not know what a reservation was.  We were left standing there confused if we were going to get a table, so we left.  Saw this cozy little place across the street so we gave it a shot.  A total 180.  Everything was decorated nicely, the staff was inviting, great ambiance; an incredible difference from the cafeteria feel of the other place.  The food.  Everything was delicious.  I tried one of their shrimp specials and tasted their sausage special.  Not was heavy as you'd expect most Italian food and everything was super fresh.  My aunt had the pork chop which was over cooked.  They took it back and cooked her another plate, which came out perfectly, apologized and comp'd her meal.  As a gym/health food guy Italian food is usually a big negative for me, but this place wasn't bad.  Natural ingredients, amazing service and great tastes.",5.0
Probably one of the best restaurant experiences you can have. Great good but more importantly great staff. Rick is amazing!! This is a must go - the lasagna and the chicken are my two favorites.,5.0

"Went for brunch on a very very cold Sunday morning. It was a little chilly inside, but they get bonus points for the toasty-warm, clean, spacious, homey, nice-smelling bathroom!Tasty, large portions of food. Attentive service, although the food took a while - but I think they were conscious of this because they were giving people free drinks.",4.0
"INCREDIBLE RESTAURANT!!!We came here for the brunch and it was just amazing. The decor is very cute and simple (bar, wooden tables, flowers and succulents..) and the staff is incredibly nice and friendly. Our waiter (Rick) was genuinely kind and that's all we want for a Sunday morning. We ordered their special of the day (big burger with fried egg, bacon and cheddar served with French fries -$14) and their Panettone French toast kabobs (comes with bacon, any style eggs, bananas & strawberries -$10). The meals were both yummy for the eyes, and delicious to eat. We were completely full and had to take away some leftovers. The burger patty was generous and of good quality, and it was perfectly cooked. Their menu offers many tempting options such as home made pastas or salmon sandwiches, that we will definitely come back for another brunch or dinner. (We're actually already planning our next visit). If you read this review you've got to try the place !!!",5.0
The service was excellent and so was the food.  The restaurant is very comfortable and easy going.  I had the French toast kebabs with bacon and eggs.  I recommend getting the home fries as a side as well.   All of it is DELICIOUS!  I will be going back soon!,5.0
"Best pasta dish I've had in a long time.  I ordered the special, homemade tagliatelle with mussels. Wonderful texture, perfect al dente. The mussels weren't wet. Accompanied by a wonderful French rose wine,  a  Gerard Bertrand Gris Blanc. Very pale and tasty. My date had lasagna and sautéed spinach. Both excellent. The bread was meh, but I'm a bread snob. Served with a very tasty olive oil. We also had tiramisu and it was excellent. The restaurant is laid back and has a cool vibe. The service was also very attentive. GO!",4.0
"How people are able to not give this place 5 stars is beyond me. We've been trying to find a decent brunch place in the neighborhood for a long time until we've finally found Ringo. Everybody is always incredibly nice, the omelettes are out if this world and their Mimosas are the only reason I get out of bed on Sundays.Thanks gentlemen, keep up the good work!",5.0
"Ringolevio has the sweet ambiance of an old candle-lit antique store. Little trinkets and lanterns are creatively shelved along the walls, giving the place a very old and aged feel to it. For a second I thought my Great Aunt Sue was going to appear from the shadows and show me her famous thimble collection. We were seated by a very friendly waiter and presented with the adorable composition notebook menus. At first it seemed to be a pretty small menu, but after reading everything it was difficult to pick just one thing to order! Eventually we agreed on the burger trio and gnocchi pasta. While we waited he brought us yummy bread and deliciously peppery olive oil. In no time we were scarfing down the mini hamburgers and soft potatoey pasta, thoroughly enjoying every bite. The burgers were adorably small, about 4 or 5 bites, made with a yummy buttery bun, tasty cheese, accompanied by a pile of absolutely delicious caramelized onions to add onto the sandwich or eat on its own like we did because they were just so flavorful. The roasted rosemary potatoes were very good, crispy outside and soft inside almost like thick cubed fries. The gnocchi was soft and filling, with a good chunky tomato sauce. When we had finished the food, we were plenty satisfied and full, yet felt disappointed that the meal was over because it was so delicious. Then before we left, the waiter brought us two small glasses of complimentary moscato in unique miniature goblets, which was the perfect dessert to end the night. For those of you who don't know, Ringolevio was an old childhood game that was played in the fifties and that is exactly what this place feels like. A nosatliagic place that makes you feel like you've traveled back in time. - Zoe and Jonny",5.0
"We had a wonderful brunch here few months back and never got around to writing the review.  If it was bad, we definitely would've gotten on it much quicker.  The food was quite good, we came early so there was no wait, and the staff was quiet and attentive.  Come early, as we've said, to ensure you get a table.  The location is not very big, and it's far off from he main Willysburg streets.  You'll find parking easily on a weekend.",4.0

We celebrated a birthday dinner with a great couple and decided to try Ringolevio. As soon as we walked in we knew we were in for a good time. NIce ambience nice welcome from staff upon out arrival. The décor was very laid back and our waiter Rick was like a friend from way back when not a snotty stuck up indifferent jerk. Rick was spot on with his recommendations for wine and he is a master at his craft because he answered all our questions about the specials and gave us a great recommendation on the dishes. The food was well cooked flavorful and unpretentious. The portions were great we were able to finish them but could not fit in another bite. We had the calamari for starters and the lasagneta. The main course was the seafood pasta the skirt steak and the lamb and also a lasagna. All were amazing..... Dessert don't even get me started FONDUE.... I might just have to go dig for my fondue pot and try to reminisce on the delicious fondue we had at Ringolevio. Everything was very fresh and well made. The service was out of this world Rick was  gem and we laughed with him and he never made us feel rushed. Great Great Night! we will be back  and they take credit cards =)I think we are hooked cant wait to come back.,5.0
"To begin with, the bottomless mimosas are worth it! $8 for unlimited mimosas. If that in itself doesn't convince you to try this place, I don't know what will. I had maybe 7 of them....so this review might be a little biased, but my brunch was BOMB. I went to NY for vacation and this was my first stop (recommended by one of our friends). I got the prosciutto omelette, which came with a side of crinkle fries and a simple salad.

They were also on point with service and refilling our drinks. Oh and btw, they only serve brunch on weekends!",4.0

It was a little pricier than the others on the menu but this wasn't Rick or the restaurant trying to up sell. He really thought it was was a great wine. And, when my wife didn't love it, he gave her another on the house. This place really does care about the patron and goes out of their way to show it. A place like this has heart and soul by way of the people working there. A point quite missed by most of the new restaurants nowadays.

The menu (with it's great explanation of WHAT Ringolevio is: a tag-style game played in the teeming streets of NYC way back when) highlights feel good classics (handmade gnocchi w/ gorgonzola cheese sauce + poached chicken breast entree) with a fun approach to aesthetic design.There is something to be said when a new joint comes to our neighborhood....

"The chianti wine was perfectly tempered! Big glass for $8! My wife's carpaccio was great and I got the skirt steak with farm vegetable and mash potatoes!

"This restaurant is a hidden treasure! We have driven past it every day since it opened  and only realized it was here after searching on Yelp. It has quickly become a favorite brunch spot though, as the food is phenomenal, the atmosphere/music are relaxed and inviting and the staff are so nice! They always put a bowl of water outside for our dog and are super accommodating and friendly.The prices for brunch here CANNOT BE BEAT. The food is fantastic and the portions generous.We love this spot.",5.0
"Such a surprise! We went for Brunch on a Saturday morning and it was incredible. We had the french toast kebab and a side order of potatoes. To start, the bacon was perfect, the BEST bacon I have ever had. Next, the potatoes in the side were cooked great and salted well. The french toast kebab was filling and very delicious. Staff there was super nice and really helpful to work with. I will definitely be coming back soon!",5.0
"Up there as far as our favorite places to go to for brunch. Pear Bellini, eggs Benedict (eggs perfectly poached) w/spinach & prosciutto, chicken & waffles served w/ a mild kick & spice, coleslaw part of the dish = a scrumptious bite!!! Place opened by childhood friends creating a nice vibe, good food & pretty nice people (operating the place & guests) gathering spot. Highly recommend if you're in Brooklyn",4.0
"After a rough day involving a flat tire on the coldest day of the year, this restaurant turned a bad day into an incredible one with impeccable service and delicious food. I brought my fiancé and his parents here and Rick was our waiter. We had to push our reservation back due to road side assistance taking 3 hours. Rick heard the story and gave us fresh burrata on the house. He treated us so well and this was a dining experience we won't ever forget. Have the bolognese- it's excellent!",5.0
"Burrata to start, skirt steak medium-rare for the entrée, pie for dessert. There, you just had one of the best dinners ever, you're welcome. Also, brunch there is just as excellent. French toast kebabs were fun and delicious, and the eggs were poached perfectly --no hyperbole-- perfectly. Whomever is doing the cooking here really, really knows what they're doing. The only slightest knock I have on this place is that it's pretty cold inside. I get it, it's winter and 20 degrees outside, but it'd be easier to bear if the heater was cranked a little more to help.",5.0
"I don't know how long you've lived around the BQE area of Williamsburg but let me tell you, we waited a while for a go-to cozy corner spot w/ warm vibes and delicious eats. Ringolevio is just about as good as it gets.The Ringo team is doing something right. The menu (with it's great explanation of WHAT Ringolevio is: a tag-style game played in the teeming streets of NYC way back when) highlights feel good classics (handmade gnocchi w/ gorgonzola cheese sauce + poached chicken breast entree) with a fun approach to aesthetic design.There is something to be said when a new joint comes to our neighborhood.... Ringo does not disappoint! Don't miss the the awesome, quirky bathroom art. I'd totally live in that funky washroom!",5.0
"OMG when I read these reviews I was like ""Let me find out if this place is really THIS GOOD""YESSSSSS THEY ARE. Food ~ Some of the best steak and lasagna in brooklyn ...I've never had blueberry pie in my life until tonight and I am officially hooked (on theirs at least) Service ~ THE BEST IVE HAD IN BROOKLYN. WOW, having the owners there makes all the difference in the world because nothing is less than perfection when it came to attentiveness and food presentation Ambiance ~ OMGGGGG shout out to the Dj that plays everything from bachata to ice cube! I loved the music selection even tho I'm sure some of the patrons that night may have not been ready lol!But it showed me that my business means as much to them as the other patrons ~ I love that this place is right in my area!

Brunch was the eggs Benedict with prosciutto, french toast with eggs, and a special of sweet potato, beets, kale, eggs and goat cheese and lots of mimosas and it blew every other brunch out of the water.

"Updating this review with a highly deserved 5 stars. So we came back after Paul, one of the owner, left a voicemail apologizing deeply for our previous sad experience.We decided to give it a second chance and to go with a business associate. We were really well welcomed as anyone else in this small and homy neighborhood restaurant.We had an experience like we've never had so far in NYC. Besides the excellent hospitality and service , they have excellent food. We came over for brunch and received couple of mimosas (mango, pear, grapefruit and peach), a charcuterie plate with Italian dry meats and a taste of 3 kind of cheese.It was absolutely delicious. We highly recommend. Plus it was served with the ""carnivale bread"" like my hubby's momma used to make. So a 5 stars right there.But that is not it. I really wanted to try the lasagna AND the panettone toast kebab.So we decided to all share the meat lasagna and we got the steak, the salmon Benedict and the panettone toast.Mama mia ! Another 5 stars. Honestly I haven't had a good lasagna in 6 years (Except the one that is homemade by my husband) and they nail it. Perfect cooking time, perfect pasta texture and perfect meat-tomato sauce. And to our greatest satisfaction, they serve their pasta with a jar of grated parmigiano. No need to say how delighted we were.The panettone, according to my taste and cooking skills, was such a creative idea! The mix between fresh fruits, the panettone panned and the light red fruit coulis was delicious and subtle. I didn't even put syrup on it. It would have been an insult to the whole dish. The steak was perfect temperature (medium rare), the scrambled eggs seemed to be good as well and the salmon Benedict was devoured. Well, 5 stars strike again !And, as beautiful adding gesture, we received the homemade apple pie. We did not think we would be able to have room for it. But we actually didn't need room. Crispy from outside and so melty from inside. It was really delicious to.To the owner : thank you for having called back and left the voicemail. We are glad that we came and gave that second chance. Thank you as well for your kind hospitality and an environment where guest satisfaction is your priority. It is very rare nowadays.To any Yelper : we highly, highly recommend this place for either brunch or dinner. From start to finish you will have a wonderful experience both in terms of the food and the service/hospitality.5 STARS for everything !",5.0

I have two options here: keep them a secret and go eat there seven days a week to make up for selfishly not telling everyone about them, or, bite the bullet and share. So here we are: The salmon was delicious, the potatoes that came with, were so good, that my BF had no qualms about stealing them as desert to his excellent mushroom pasta. Before that, there were exquisite olives, and a cheese selection that came with warm puff pastry and delicious fruit spread. I want to go back right now. Stay tuned for brunch reviews!",5.0

"I debated whether to leave a review, because I love Ringolevio and want it to do well... but I don't want it to do so well that I can't just waltz in and get a seat!This is me and my husband's favorite neighborhood restaurant, and the 5 stars it has on Yelp are well deserved. It's nice to have a place close by that is delicious, reasonably priced, and the owners and staff are the nicest people ever. In short, the perfect replacement for Frankie's (their sandwiches rocked, but this place is so much better).So, here's what to do. Start your dinner off with a nice glass of $9 wine. Get the meat place. Get all the meats. The meat/cheese trays come with some nice touches, like fruits and jams, and this deep-fried dough that somewhat resembles the outer wrapped of a cream-cheese wonton and perfectly complements the food. The beef carpaccio is also an excellent choice, as are the crostini. I had the spinach/apple/walnut/pecorino salad last time I went, and that was a nicely done salad as well.What to eat for mains? I've had the meat lasagna (definitely recommend), the trio of grass fed beef burgers (good, but small), the lamb kebob (delicious), the grilled pork chop (perfectly cooked), and my personal favorite, grilled skirt steak. The only thing that I might skip woudl be the spinach/ricotta ravioli. It was good, but there isn't a ton of flavor to it. Also, every night they have specials, and they usually have some sort of pasta special which I would definitely try out. They definitely know how to cook pasta al dente and make sure that it comes to you perfectly. The mashed potatoes are really good, too, so if you don't get the skirt steak do yourself a favor and get those for a side. Slightly cheesy, very buttery, completely heaven in your mouth.I've heard great things about the pies, but I've never actually had one. Last time I went, they ran out (sad face), but to make up for it, they gave me tiramisu on the house. But I'll definitely be coming back and getting pie next time (it might help if I didn't order so much food before dessert).So go! Because I want this place to stay and be successful. But please leave me a seat, because I definitely want to come back again and again.",5.0
"I tried this place out because of the yelp hype. The decor has an estate sale vibe (penny farthing wine rack / lamp?). The brunch offerings are the standard fare. My wife got the bacon egg sandwich and I got the cheddar omelet. Both had problems, the bacon was limp and my omelet was way over cooked. The sides are some sad crinkle cut fries, overdressed lettuce topped with box grated carrot. I don't think we'll be back.",3.0

But please leave me a seat, because I definitely want to come back again and again.",5.0
"I tried this place out because of the yelp hype. The decor has an estate sale vibe (penny farthing wine rack / lamp?). The brunch offerings are the standard fare. My wife got the bacon egg sandwich and I got the cheddar omelet. Both had problems, the bacon was limp and my omelet was way over cooked. The sides are some sad crinkle cut fries, overdressed lettuce topped with box grated carrot. I don't think we'll be back.",3.0
"I would rank this as a very solid 4.5 stars5 stars for the food and price.  The half star is missing because service was not as awesome as everyone said but it was still good.  This would be my breakfast go to spot for my ""perfect"" breakfast combo.  I love waffles.  What that means is I get waffles and Ringolevio serves it with eggs and bacon as a dish.  Because most places will just serve you a big plate of waffle and nothing else.The only thing I wish they had more of is brunch drink selection as well.  They serve mimosa and I think bloody mary but I wish there are more mixed drinks on the menu.",4.0
"Let me preface my review by saying that I still loved this place and would return, if only for the romantic vibe and kind service.  The toasts and cheese plate were great and the atmosphere dim-lit, cozy, and welcoming. I took issue, however, with both pasta dishes that we ordered.  Mine was a homemade pasta (that night's special) which was cooked perfectly al dente, but was extremely under seasoned. I wanted the shaved carrots in the pasta to work but, unfortunately, they did not.  Maybe it would have been better had the kitchen decided to salt the dish.  My fiancé ordered the gnocchi, which was too soft and turned to mush in the plate under the heavy gorgonzola sauce.  Our server was excellent and so very nice and the kitchen sent out complimentary toasts and a drink at the end, which is always a nice touch.  We will give them another try and hope to be able to write a more positive update soon.",3.0
"Was a bit skeptical with so many 5 star reviews for such a new restaurant, but every star was absolutely well deserved. Came here for brunch and at first glance, the brunch items seem pretty ordinary on paper and just like all other brunch spots. Was in the mood for some classic eggs Benny and to much surprise, the subtle flares in Ringolevio's eggs Benny made for a nice surprise. Prosciutto instead of Canadian bacon and over a bed of spinach with a drizzle of balsamic reduction made for the perfect improvements on this brunch classic. Presentation was beautiful.  The service was incredible.We had also order some Burrata, which they were unfortunately out of, but gave us some apples and tomatoes in its place.  Definitely want to come back here for dinner (and the burrata)!  Loved the guys that worked here as well!  New neighborhood favorite!!",5.0

Excellent service. Homemade courses. Wonderful Atmosphere. It took us awhile to finally try this place out and now we regret not going sooner! What an amazing dining experience overall. I had hand rolled pappardelle with Italian sausage and broccoli rabe (pasta special for the night) and my wife had the ravioli. Both came out quick and tasted amazing (quite obviously hand prepared). We enjoyed wine on recommendation and finished our evening with a glass of port and homemade blueberry pie (with vanilla gelato). Every part of the night was great.

"Ringolevio is a small, cozy Mediterranean spot with awesome service and delicious food. The service here is tiptop; our waiter was incredibly welcoming and helpful. We shared a collection of three crostinis. Our favorite was the bresaola crostini. It was ridiculous. We LOVE love love blue cheese and the salty meat paired so incredibly with the tangy gorgonzola. I could have inhaled another three by myself. Chris ordered a spinach and ricotta ravioli with pork and beef bolognese from their evening specials and I ordered rosemary skewered lamb kabobs with a side of roasted gorgonzola beets. For dessert our server graciously offered us both a glass of dessert wine and we paired that with their panna cotta. One of my favorite things about this restaurant was the serving size. Yes, I was stuffed but the portions were reasonable and we finished everything. To read our full review, check out our blog post on Ringolevio here: wp.me/p5EPbt-74",5.0
"A fantastic addition to the neighborhood! Delicious food, cool vibe, awesome service, and chill tunes to set the mood. So far we only visited for brunch. French toast skewers were tasty. The steak & eggs were flavorful and the potatoes were good. Side of cheese grits had a bit of cheddar melted in and it was drool worthy goodness.

This place deserved  for me to take the time to write one.Was looking for a new place to go to dinner in the neighborhood with a friend a few weeks ago and came across this place on Yelp. Seeing all he great reviews we just had to try it. Absolutely LOVED it! Warm inviting atmosphere and a great selection of music (not too loud like some places where you can't enjoy a conversation). Food was DELICIOUS! I had the salmon which was incredible. One of THE best salmon dishes I've ever had, and I eat a LOT of salmon in restaurants. I forget what the side was that came with it but I asked to substitute sauteed spinach and was graciously accommodated. My friend had the skirt steak and said it was awesome as well. The mashed potatoes that came with the steak were to DIE for! She also substituted the veggie for sauteed spinach, which as also great. Ok, so I hardly ever order dessert but that night I just didn't want to leave. We ordered the blueberry pie to share and cappuccinos. Blueberry pie...GET it. Made on the premises and amazing. Service was impeccable and very friendly. Mitchell was our waiter and he was a total gem. Polite, professional and extremely friendly. We loved this place so much that we reserved brunch for this Sunday for our Mother-Daughter get together. 10 people. REALLY looking forward to it! I called the other night to confirm and Mitchell actually got on the phone and said he remembered us (we were the ""2 Lisa's) and was looking forward to seeing us on Sunday.

"I live on the same block as this restaurant and so badly wanted it to be my local go to. I went for dinner with a friend and was met with a very basic, totally uninspired menu.  The menu isn't really the problem though, it's the fact that the ingredients are unbelievably sub par. I ordered the burratta and tomato salad (in season), a personal favorite, and the tomatoes were that pale orange color, hard as rocks and totally flavorless. I pushed them to the side and dug into the cheese...it was ok but didn't seem as fresh as it should be. I got the impression that they get their produce, and possibly dairy products, from a restaurant supplier like Sysco. In a city where the local deli sells heirloom tomatoes, you really can't send those things out on a plate and expect no one to notice. The gnocchi with Gorgonzola sauce was tasty but was served without silverware and had started to get cold before I had a fork in hand. The server poured tap water into my glass of sparkling water multiple times despite the large bottle on the table. I will say they knew they weren't hitting it out of the park because they sent out a complimentary dessert...the firmest most underwhelming panna cotta I've ever had.  To say I left disappointed would be an understatement. Now, a few weeks later, I thought the gnocchi would be a nice treat after a long day and I've been waiting for 70 minutes for a 10 minute dish to be brought a whole block (I would've gone to get it but couldn't leave my infant alone and never imagined it would take well over an hour!) I can't say right now if I'll ever get my food tonight but I will say this was the final chance for this place to win me as a customer.",2.0

The ravioli in particular was to die for. The salad was also tasty although a bit imbalanced with more dressing and fixings than necessary given the amount of greens. There was also fresh bread on the house included with my order. Would definitely order again and hope this little gem doesn't become too popular too quickly!",5.0

Good food cooked well. The steak is ""mad-decent"" (quote from friend) and the pasta is always cooked and prepared well. I also enjoy the slider trio, quality meat and toppings.

For desert I had the homemade apple pie with homemade vanilla GelatoI look forward  to going back and bring  friends great  for girls  night out,5.0

"Best brunch I've had in a while. Great service, bottomless mimosa and dessert on the house! Top pick",5.0
"Just discovered this place last night and it was absolutely amazing. My boyfriend and I shared the burrata appetizer, flank steak, and pasta special which was fresh tagliatelle with sausage and broccoli rabe. Everything was SO delicious, we can't wait to try the rest of the menu. Super friendly vibe and great service, too. Definitely making this place a date night go-to spot!",5.0
"My new favorite place. Been here more times than I can count in the past few months. Service is excellent... Everyone is super friendly and the food is beyond excellent. Probably the best bacon egg and cheese sandwich I've ever had... The steak and chicken for dinner are amazing, and my favorite are the Rosemary potatoes. Great wine and drinks. Highly recommend for brunch, lunch or dinner!",5.0
""" French toast kabab "" is the best man . If u have restaurant who serve this item . Try it and u will in love.....",4.0
"Ordered delivery here and can't say enough good things. Had spinach ricotta ravioli and a spinach salad. The food was delicious, plentiful and reasonably priced. It came much faster than expected. The ravioli in particular was to die for. The salad was also tasty although a bit imbalanced with more dressing and fixings than necessary given the amount of greens. There was also fresh bread on the house included with my order. Would definitely order again and hope this little gem doesn't become too popular too quickly!",5.0
"I live nearby and typically order from seamless... they make sure to appropriately package the food so it doesn't get gross. It is very much appreciated and definitely adds to the value. I wouldn't hesitate to order in, but the restaurant is quite nice too.Brunch is on point (my roommates preference) and dinner is always good. I find the food to be simple and satisfying. Good food cooked well. The steak is ""mad-decent"" (quote from friend) and the pasta is always cooked and prepared well. I also enjoy the slider trio, quality meat and toppings. Ambiance is warm and comfortable. The waitstaff and owner are all delightful.",5.0
"This place is amazing! Very attentive service, but not remotely bothersome. Just surprisingly and refreshingly professional. The food is great! Lots of tasty options - we have tried several over the course of quite a few nights at this spot, and everything has been wonderful. The cheese plate, sliders, and ravioli were some standouts. Not going to blow your socks off with inventiveness, but still very solid. Portions might be best for ordering a few options and sharing, but since it's a really cute date spot, that has never been a problem. With a chill vibe, affordable wine, and great tunes, I don't know why anyone orders takeout from here.",5.0
"Great new restaurant!!!Stumbled upon this place and what a surprise!!!The atmosphere is real chill, the music is great and the food is delicious.We started with a crostini sampler (a nice way to try a variety of things).Then moved on to handmade made ravioli with spinach and ricotta(Yumm) and handmade gnocchi with gorgonzola sauce(Super Yumm).Loved it all!!Keep up the good work.We'll definitely be back:)",5.0
"I always have a fantastic meal here, and the service is excellent. It's super cute, never crowded and perfect for a date night. I love the mushroom tagliatelle but the specials are always great too. Great for brunch. Oh and great music too!",5.0
"I literally cannot say enough good things about this spot. I have eaten in three times and ordered online once and every experience was superb. Both the kale and spinach salads are spot on, and every pasta dish I have had so far, from the bolognese to the lasagna has been excellent. The service is also outstanding, and although I was initially reluctant to try an Italian spot for brunch, they did not disappoint. While the brunch is not strictly Italian themed, it doesn't matter. The thick fluffy belgian waffle comes covered in fresh berries and is served with eggs and bacon, all of which were cooked perfectly. The pear mimosa was also fantastic. Really psyched to have found this place, and it's really close to my house. Keep it up over there!",5.0
"This is one of the most amazing locations in Brooklyn-- the very posh Williamsburg,Brooklyn. I came with 5 friends to dine. We had the crostini's as our appetizer, which we divided amongst one another, 2 bottles of wine and everyone had a mix of red meat, fish and gnocchi for the main course. 5-star service and a professional staff with years of experience in the business. Look forward to an amazing and personal dining on your own evening at this establishment!",5.0
Gnocchi for days!! That's my favorite dish !! I've been here more than once  and they never fail . Definitely stopping by again and again. Love the authentic homemade  mozzarella !!!,5.0
"The downside to writing a review for our neighborhood gem is it'll get crowded and we won't be able to stroll in at 12 30 for brunch without waiting. But it's worth the risk if it means making sure Ringolevio is here to stay. To start, this place is 1.5 blocks from our apartment...a huge plus. The food is incredible - we've eaten everything on the dinner and brunch menu between the two of us. Eggs? Delicious. Veggie lasagna? Mouth-watering. Salmon? Perfect. Steak? Drool. What's more is the staff. They know who we are by now and they treat us extremely well. Just today we had a party of four for a post-race brunch and they treated us to a Bellini and Tiramisu. They're attentive, thoughtful and great for conversation. The ambiance is cozy, rustic and perfect for a Brooklyn meal. And the prices affordable. We eat there about 3-4 times a month. Only because we need to actually cook sometimes... Spread the word, but don't take my brunch seat!",5.0
"I had a great great brunch here! The place is super nice and tastefully decorated. We had to wait a bit before our food arrived and they gave us some apple with honey while waiting. We all appreciated the food a lot, the potatoes are awesome. Waiters are ultra polite and so nice. My friend and I had a free mimosa because, I suppose, of the time it took for our food to be served (which was not that long after all)!Parking is easy in the area (at least on weekends). I strongly suggest to go there.",5.0
"I've been for brunch and for dinner and will be a regular before you know it. This place has great food, cool, friendly staff, and it's somewhere you could end up hanging out for hours and not even notice. It feels comfortable. I've had the bottomless grapefruit mimosas (amazing), the eggs Benedict with prosciutto, and for dinner the steak with mashed potatoes and veggies. I don't know what they do to those veggies, but you can't stop eating them. Highly recommend checking this place out!",5.0

This place took over the spot where Frankie's used to be. Hope they last longer than they did Because I ordered the salmon entree and it was great. Well cooked and price. Definitely check it out. It's well designed too.,5.0
"I grew up around the corner from this place, so I know the area well,first it's small,but nicely done, it as a warm humid night a/c would have been nice, but they kept doors and windows open, no hard liquor, just beer and wine, the food was above average and the service was pretty good",3.0
"Like another reviewer stated: ""DON'T MICROWAVE THE LASAGNA"". I went to this place for one reason. When I was a kid growing up in NYC, we played a game called Ringolevio. So, when I was driving by with my GF, I said, ""Let's give it a try"". It's yet another trendyish ""Form over Function"" joint that isn't my type of place, but it was ok. Most New Yorkers are NOT native New Yorkers. I am. I care more about the food than the ambience. ""New"" New Yorkers don't. Zagat's is a great guide for interior decorators and NOT for food. The place looks cool. So what. The food is just ok but if you are Italian, it is a SACRILAGE to microwave food. ESPECIALLY LASAGNA. The GF liked it. I didn't. To be fair, I'm a pretty good cook, so I know when places cut corners. Most won't notice it. 3 stars. It's OK.",3.0

My girlfriend and I have gone about once a week since they've opened, and we've brought a few out-of-town guests there; it's been a hit with everyone. The lasagna is fantastic, and I was lucky enough to be there one evening when they had a homemade pumpkin pie for dessert; amazing. I can't recommend this place enough.",5.0

"If I could, I would give this place NO STARS at all.  We ordered grilled pork chop with apple sauce and mashed potato, lamb kabob skewers with sautéed spinach.  None of the dishes had any flavors or spices!!  Forget spices; they lacked salt and pepper which is just the basic!!!! Pork chop was really dry and lamb kabob had more onions and bell peppers than lamb itself.  I would never order from here nor I'd go this place.  I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone either.  Please hire someone who can actually cook the cuisine you are highlighting; not someone who is affordable.",1.0
