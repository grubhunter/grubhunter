"I went today, a Wednesday at around 12:30 and it was pretty busy, full of people who were just sitting there with their laptops, either finished with their food/drink or not ordering at all. I didn't know if it was order and then sit or sit and then order, the guy by the cashier told me I could sit down and decide and come back to him to order. Luckily he told me that, so I quickly the two open seats at the large back table, or else it would've been taken by the people that came immediately behind me (a lot).My mom and I decided on the Chicken, oyster mushroom fennel flatbread ($12/13) and the Three eggs omelette ($10/11). The prices were reasonable. I also got an Iced Lemonade, which was just regular lemonade with ice. I wanted the Lavender Lemonade, after hearing that it was good (but they didn't have that today booo). It was quite a wait since a few people were already on the line after we decided what to get. They give out number stands so you can place on the table at your seats and they will bring the food to you once it's ready. The flatbread was just amazing, just enough chicken, mushroom however I didn't really notice or taste any oysters. Besides that it had a sauce? In the shape of a warm put on top of it, which made it taste so good, might've been some black bean paste (forgot to ask). The Three egg omelette was alright. It didn't look like there was three eggs used in that omelette, more like one or two. There were cheese, spinach, and cherry tomatoes inside the omelette topped with sour cream and some smoked salmon. There were potatoes on the side (a bit oily) and two slices of bread with butter. I liked the ambience of the cafe, wasn't too loud or dead silent. Having to share tables with other people wasn't so bad. It was nice with the windows, which let a lot of natural light in but it wasn't sunny or too bright. On a side note, the bathroom was huge. Overall, I like the environment and the food is pretty good. And the bathroom is huge (main point, can't forget that!)",4.0
"Who would think to open a coffee shop on a hidden place? I guess the people here know what they do because it is busy, clean, and well priced.Cappuccino, black tea and rum cake, only $10 including tax. I was ready to pay more. (Although I asked for large cappuccino and got a tiny cup, so I am not sure if this is the large, or if they mistakenly served us with a small one).Clean (and huge) bathroom, good coffee and good cake. There is no waiter service.Good spot. For work or talk.",4.0
"Overhyped.After everyone and their mothers complimented this place, I finally forced myself to get up and check it out. You order by the register and then spend the rest of your waiting time scouting out a table. You're looking at people hoping someone will eat faster so that you can sit, they're looking back at you spitefully eating in slow motion.. Awkward. Once you're lucky enough to sit down, the server brings out your dish. I ordered the Kings Eggs I believe which were poached eggs with salmon, red caviar, the ever popular hollandaise sauce and roasted potatoes. It was good, but not great. My last couple of bites contained remnants of egg shells therefore I did not fully finish my meal. The latte was scrumptious though.",3.0
"Love Love Love the decor. The setup is so warm and inviting, it seems like a place you could chill all day. The setup is basically order at the cashier, take a number, find a table and the waiters will find you.The food:Eggs Royal- Smoked Salmon, caviar, poached eggs, on an English Muffin, topped with a creamy Hollandaise sauce, served with red roasted potatoes. The benedict was great, it was not a traditional benedict but I really enjoyed the flavor, it was kinda like a deconstructed benedict. The eggs were cooked perfectly, the smoked salmon added a nice velvety texture and the Hollandaise added a nice creamy element. I really enjoyed the flavor a lot. The red roasted potatoes were great, they were perfectly tender and really well seasoned. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Egyptian Poached Eggs- Poached eggs served with avocado, baby arugula, tomato, on sourdough bread topped with Dukkah. The dish as a whole was good but not a lot of sustenance, it was kinda too light and not very filling. I took a bite and it tasted like flavored air. I enjoyed this but it felt more like an app than an entree. The eggs were nicely cooked. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Croissant- It was nothing crazy, just a reg croissant.",4.0
"An adorable, vintage cafe in such a quiet neighborhood! It was just the right spot to be in when it was freezing cold out this past weekend. This cafe serves coffee, tea, baked goods, and brunch dishes. There is no waiter service therefore, patrons will have to order at the cashier counter and receive a number. Wherever you are sitting, a staff member will bring your food to you. It is an open kitchen so you get to see your plate of food in the making.Egyptian Poached Eggs caught my eyes. There is light avocado spread on sourdough toast topped with arugula leaves, tomato, sprinkled with dukkah - an Egyptian mixture of spice, herbs, and nuts with two perfectly cooked poached eggs on top. This was a very light breakfast/brunch item overall but very tasty. I loved the fresh spice taste with our everyday ingredients. It had a smoky taste to it. I did wish there was more avocado spread though.Coffee latte art is pretty here! You have to catch the barista when he's hyped!",4.0
"Ordered: Egyptian poached eggs, Creme brûlée french toast, Blueberry turnover, and Pistachio croissantPros-- The poached eggs were accompanied by avocado, arugula and tomato on sourdough--all very fresh. The bread had a nice crunch to it and the flavors melded well together. The French toast was fluffy and the brûlée batter made the inside creamy. I loved how they brûléed the top of the banana slices to add a twist to simply sliced fruit. The top of the French toast had a raspberry jam which had the perfect balance of sweetness. The turnover was flaky and the blueberries were clearly fresh. The staff was friendly and helpful in offering recommendations. Cons-- The pistachio croissant didn't have the flaky, soft texture I typically associate and love about croissants. You had to get to the deep core of it to get the soft texture. The tables weren't as consistently cleaned as I think they should've been.",4.0
"Only stumbled upon this cafe by chance, as my boyfriend and I were heading to Oxcart Tavern for dinner. Oxcart was around a 40 minute wait that day so we decided to stop by here for a cup of tea while we wait. What a precious gem in Ditmas Park. The decor was so warm and inviting, it was such a homey atmosphere I never wanted to leave! I got a tea (I think it was the peach blossom!) and it was great. I took a look at their menu and was amazed by the selection! Will definitely come back and try their brunch next time I am in the area!",4.0
"Really nice hidden spot.  We checked it out from a friend suggestion.  Got the Eggs Royal - This was very flavorful.  The little roe helped with the smoked salmon.  The runny poached egg gives the english muffin some softness.  The arugula makes a nice salad to the whole platelet Egyptian Eggs-  It was a different take on the poached eggs, the avocado and spices was a nice zest of flavor.  I really had trouble deciding between to two so i went halfs between a friend.Had to try the Flatbread-  Smoked trout and goat cheese with olives and a single poached egg to top it off. Going have to try other combos.My friend got the Cremebrulee french toast it was pretty large and filling.  We didn't taste much of the creme brulee but it was good.  maybe too sweet my friend said, but I enjoyed it.It was pretty packed on a sunday, but we got a seat eventually and enjoy the cafe like service.",4.0
"I think 3.5* justifies my experience. So Milk & Honey is this cool, super hip and rustic joint that opened on Newkirk in Ditmas Park. (Great spot for meeting friends for a quick bite). To place your order you must walk up to the counter. The staff behind the counter are quite friendly and helpful in deciding what you might be in the mood of. They have some delicious fresh pastries on their shelves. I am not a fan of their coffee - I feel like it has this weird aftertaste. Definitely does not agree with me. Their dishes leaves a lot to be desired. I've ordered the tacos, egg sandwich, and scrambled eggs. None of them left their mark. I also think that any restaurant that doesn't accept credit cards in the 21st century ought to lose a star just for that. It is such a bother to have to make sure to be carrying cash on me while going to cash only joints. Especially if I wasn't aware of it prior. - I avoid those places once I do know. It is a great spot to work quietly on laptops with multiple outlets to satisfy many.",2.0
"Discovered this place on Yelp and decided to try it because it had such great reviews. Good news: it lives up to them!When I walked in around lunch time there wasn't a single seat to sit down and eat, but I ordered anyway because I was really interested in trying it out.I got the chicken bacon avocado sandwich and have to say that it was probably the best sandwich I've ever had! Took about 20-25 minutes from order to eating but it was well worth the wait during the busy lunch hour.Afterwards I got a vanilla latte to go and have to say, again, it was the best latte I've ever had. Just the right amount of espresso, vanilla and milk! The ONLY thing that wasn't great was that it was sort of smoky inside and I left with my clothes and jacket smelling slightly like grase/smoke. But, don't let this one incident keep you from going - it was still worth it!I highly, highly recommend this place. I'll absolutely be back.",5.0

"Turely love this place from the food to the atmosphere. They have great customer service. 1st: I had there Egyptian poached eggs for breakfast. that was amazing.  I usually hate poached eggs. It was a perfect blend with the avocados, salad, nuts and  other ingredients. Bread was toasted, inside soft and out side crunchy. If you have sensitive teeth be careful.2nd: love their Vanilla Latte, he made it perfect.  More vanilla and just the right amount of Latte.3rd: The chicken wrap was excellent.  I had enough salt from the turkey bacon which balanced out the savory sauce and advicados. The grill chicken was done perfectly no complaints here.  The salad that came with it was like the cherry on top. Best $10 ever spentMY NEW HIDDEN GEM!",5.0
Came here with a friend for a late breakfast and let me say I fell in love! I wish I heard about this place sooner. First of all I would like to say that the latte here is the best latte I have ever had. I had the Egyptian poached eggs which tasted amazing! My friend had the steak sandwich and blueberry iced tea which I got to try which was also very tasty! The decor is really cute. They have free wifi and accept credit cards which is a plus. The staff is very friendly. I will continue coming back to try everything else on the menu!Came back again and my friend and I decided to split the smoked salmon eggs Benedict and creme brûlée French toast! One word: WOW!!! The best French toast I have ever had hands down! I wish I could eat here every day!!,5.0
"Milk and Honey has some superb brunch options. They have a pastry window filled with some eclectic options. I also liked the log cabin like decor. It's a relaxed ambiance which makes it great to catch up with some friends. I shared the Creme Brûlée French Toast and the Egyptian Poached Eggs. I'd recommend both. The French toast was sweet and rich. It was topped with brûléed banana slices. The Egyptian poached eggs had tomatoes, arugula, and avocados over toast. It was a refreshing dish. It was topped with nuts which made it a bit earthy too. We also split a pistachio covered croissant. It was an interesting pastry, yet I wish it was softer and flakier.I'd rate Milk and Honey four and a half stars.",4.0

A nice family friendly cafe that serves a decent hot food menu as well. Primarily known as a coffee and bakery as they serve a nice cup of coffee and have some great fresh made pastries. Danishes and croissants are the items to get. They also make a nice watermelon mint juice. Very cold and refreshing. It's a great spot for a weekend brunch. Tables and service are self serve though. Make sure to take a open table before ordering as the tables go fast. Then order at the counter and the food is brought to you. Service was a bit slow as our entrees were brought out pretty late. Their poached eggs are cooked up nicely. I had the field mushrooms with poached eggs over salad with country bread and it tasted great. Family friendly as they have ample space for high chairs that they provide for the lil one to sit with you. It's a nice neighborhood spot to relax and have brunch.,3.0
I come to Milk & Honey every Monday evening to meet with my mentor. Great place to discuss work or grab some coffee and catch up with a friend. They have a nice selection of teas and coffee for the coffee lovers (not me :) Haven't tried the food yet but I've seen the flatbreads come out and they smell and look amazing.Make sure to bring cash with you. They don't take credit cards (yet). They do have an ATM machine next to the restrooms.,4.0

"The Creme brûlée French toast is delicious!! Came here on a weekday for brunch, wasn't hard to get a seat, the food is great! The only thing is the wait for the food, it took about a whole hour for our food to come, we ordered the French toast and a smoked salmon Benedict. Before the food arrived, my fiancé had to leave to refill the meter again. If you're not in a rush, this place is great! Great food, and great atmosphere especially on a nice warm day. The latte is also really good.",4.0
"This cafe is the perfect spot to come by yourself, with a date, or with a group of friends. The atmosphere is as darling as they come and is snuggled into a beautiful corner of Kensington, not too far from the newkirk station.  The food: delicious and great portions! Zesty chicken sandwich- the best thing on the menu in my opinion. The bread is paired wonderfully with the chicken and balsamic sauce and comes with a great side saladBreakfast tacos- a great temperature for this spice aversioned girl. The avocado was a great touch! French toast- very sweet but absolutely delicious if you're into that type of thing! The bread has sesame seeds on it which balances the sweet with some salt. Pita and quinoa hummus- very very filling and you can definitely taste how fresh it is! All in all, perfection.",5.0
"Another hidden gem :)! You order at the counter, take your number to a table (if there are any open), and they will serve your food to you when it's ready. Amazing variety of pastries and breakfast/brunchy entrees as well. I had the Salmon Eggs Benedict (nom nom nom) and the coffee was sooooo good. Limited space so if you want to come here with a group you should get here early. It's actually one of the very few spots that opens before 10AM so take advantage of it if you're going for breakfast. In the spring/summer/early fall it may LOOK more spacious but that's because they are able to extend the seating outside so it creates this larger illusion.... So colder months will be smaller! The staff is really friendly and helpful so no complaints there.Overall great spot!",4.0

A nice family friendly cafe that serves a decent hot food menu as well. Primarily known as a coffee and bakery as they serve a nice cup of coffee and have some great fresh made pastries. Danishes and croissants are the items to get. They also make a nice watermelon mint juice. Very cold and refreshing. It's a great spot for a weekend brunch. Tables and service are self serve though. Make sure to take a open table before ordering as the tables go fast. Then order at the counter and the food is brought to you. Service was a bit slow as our entrees were brought out pretty late. Their poached eggs are cooked up nicely. I had the field mushrooms with poached eggs over salad with country bread and it tasted great. Family friendly as they have ample space for high chairs that they provide for the lil one to sit with you. It's a nice neighborhood spot to relax and have brunch.,3.0
I come to Milk & Honey every Monday evening to meet with my mentor. Great place to discuss work or grab some coffee and catch up with a friend. They have a nice selection of teas and coffee for the coffee lovers (not me :) Haven't tried the food yet but I've seen the flatbreads come out and they smell and look amazing.Make sure to bring cash with you. They don't take credit cards (yet). They do have an ATM machine next to the restrooms.,4.0

"One of the highlights of the week was meeting with the girls for brunch. My homie, Adeline L., lives in the area but never been here, ever. We have been trying to come here a couple times but you know, things come up and we push it back, we finally had our chance this past Thursday.  Never would think there would be a gem in this quiet neighborhood! Located on the corner of the block, with lots of sunlight shining through all the windows. As I walked in, I noticed a garden wall, how cool was that? The robust smell of coffee, food cooking up in the tiniest opened kitchen, the decor, everything added together was just so relaxing. Apparently, you seat yourself after you order at the front and they bring you your order; cash only! We were here on a chilly day, no where to hang up jackets and things besides sitting on them, if you were to sit at the tables towards the back with the tall stools. I enjoyed a cup of Hot Cocoa myself, I was too early. Frothy and creamy, perfect for warming up. Jamie Z. was too hungry to wait, grabs herself an Almond Croissant, we destroyed it! Flaky, sweet, sooo good. The Lobster Bisque was a bit too sweet to our liking, and if I wasn't wrong, the soup was curdled. The dairy in the soup can be noticed by the small white bits throughout the soup.We all ordered different plates today, we usually share a bit of everything, but I think we were all too hungry. I had the Croque Madam, opened faced croissant sandwich with poached eggs, grilled ham and Swiss cheese, served with a simple arugula salad on the side. The yolk running through the buttery croissant, warm ham, gooey cheese, better than the usual eggs benedict you order for brunch, huh? Maybe, I still love my eggs benedict.

"Came here on Saturday for brunch. Heard great things was very excited to arrive. One thing we noticed right away was all the doors were open and it wasn't the warmest of days. Was quite difficult to find a seat you didn't have to leave your coat on. As we reviewed the menu at a table we kept scanning the area for better seats and noticed many in their coats or shivering. If not for all the great reviews on the food I would have left. Come to counter to order which is fine don't mind that part, but the guy Danny behind the counter may have been high. I can really appreciate a relaxed setting and work environment I really do but he had me wondering if he was ok to work. The guy before me asked for a piece of cake in the display and he looked at his colleague dumbfounded and said I can't do it. When my turn came up to order I gave it a shot, I asked if I could add onions to my omelette and he glared at me and replied ughhhhhhh I don't know and then looked around his surroundings was so weird. So I said I'm pretty sure you can so why don't we do that let me get the 3 egg omelette with onions, he just nodded at me. Then I asked him what size options for hot tea were yet again looks around all confused and was so figetty. I truly felt like I was ordering my breakfast from someone on drugs. Was so frustrating! I then repeated myself can you please show me the cups you put hot tea in, he finally got me I thought, nope. He then points to his colleague and said ""tell her"" then turned away. I was so lost I just looked at her like I'm so I'm not even sure what that means? Do I pay you? Do I re order? He over heard me saying that to her then gave me the nastiest smirk and she told me my order was taken to just pay. Which I did but the machine to electronically sign is too far from the counter for someone who is short. You have to struggle and reach over the counter to sign with your finger. Finally got my order in and sat down. Aside from that bizarre and unpleasant experience, Logan the server was soooo nice and attentive. Kept making sure we had everything needed and were comfortable, always had a smile which makes a big difference. Going out to eat isn't just about the food, without this lovely server I would never come back here ever. The guys behind the counter preparing the food, also very nice and pleasant.

"Smoked Salmon Benedict: I recommend this! The smoked salmon is really good. The arugula salad makes a great bite whether you eat it with or without smoked salmon & it was refreshing. My boyfriend liked the potato, but I didn't. I don't think this dish needed potatoes, I wouldn't mind extra salad instead of the potatoes. Egyptian Poached Egg:  I was upset that my toast was burnt and it was difficult for me to cut into. If you eat burnt part, everything would taste like burnt unless you like the burnt taste like my boyfriend. My boyfriend ate all the burnt part for me, he said it gave it an extra crunch. Other than that normally I don't like tomato but when you eat everything together it taste very good. If you don't like tomato I suggest you should still eat it together because the tomato taste wasn't strong at all. Iced coffee: I never drink black coffee but my boyfriends friend suggested to try it black first. I gave it a try and it's the best black coffee I ever had. It's not that bitter & doesn't have a bland taste. You don't really need milk or sugar but if you do just add a little bit of each. It's a good drink to start off your day.",4.0

The smoked salmon and herbed potatoes (side dishes) were really tasty and I would definitely recommend adding both when having breakfast or brunch! Based on our experience that was ""the good"". Now let's get to the not so good.If you don't read reviews about this restaurant on yelp in advance you will not know that you order your own food at the counter first and then find your own table. So bring a friend let them get your table in advance so you'll actually have a place to sit once you've ordered. Now your food WILL be brought to your table- FYI. Cash only. Ummm yeah. I'm not quite understanding why. Street vendors and even some of those guys who sell their own indie music on the street and on trains have attachments on their smart phones to take credit and debit cards and they only take cash?!?! [Insert confused face here]We ordered the egg white omelet that was supposed to have goat cheese and we were excited about that. Unfortunately, I saw something that resembled cheese but could not taste it due to the mounds of red onions in my omelet. It's as if we ordered a red onion omelet and I like red onions but OMG are u serious?!?! That was NOT GOOD! You know what saved the meal? Our smoked salmon and herbed breakfast potatoes. Both were really good but the star should have been the omelet. How do u mess up an egg white omelet?!?!?! In addition, my side order of turkey bacon was chewy and dry. I think it's the brand they use. It was quite awful. The parking is damn near non existent. It's in a residential neighborhood and many of the nearby houses have driveways which makes parking beyond difficult; in addition the areas that have metered parking has a max of one hour which in my opinion totally sux!

Great place to work, do deals, study, relax, bring family/friends. Wifi works well. Looking forward to their owner's bakery opening next door.",5.0
First time here and the food was pretty good. Ordered the Egyptian poached eggs and eggs Benedict. I got it with the Lavender lemonade drink and it was really good! All my friends loved the drink and wanted one but I got the last one. My friend got ginger honey but it tasted like water. Overall a good experience and a cute spot for brunch. There were seats outside and open windows. It was nice brunch place with the sun on you and fresh air. The place does not take cards; cash only and you gotta go up to order and pay when you order.,5.0
"This a cute, chill spot. It was moderately packed on a Saturday afternoon, but people were considerate enough to leave after they have finished their meal to let customers waiting sit for their meal.I came here for brunch and a catch-up session with my friend who lived nearby and didn't want to travel too far from home. Looking at the menu, they had a few different breakfast, brunch dishes to choose from, as well as some entrees, and coffees and teas. I did not see the tea menu until after I ordered a drink, or else I'd definitely get some of their interesting sounding teas! The salmon eggs benedict was good! Smoked salmon was real tasty. Their french toast also tasted pretty good, but be warned, it gets soggy if you wait too long, so consume quick! The chai latte I ordered wasn't as good as I have previously had from other places.. But their peach blossom tea smelled great.The pricing.. is okay. Brunch was never cheap to begin with. Will I be back? I believe yes. This is a pretty nice catch-up spot to grab some food in the middle of the afternoon.",4.0
"Had the french toast and Egyptian poached eggs, and both were supreme. The French toast was crispy, not too sweet, and had a tasteful strawberry compote along with walnuts, bananas, and syrup - perfection! And the eggs were savory with onions accompanying the avocado as well as crispy breadcrumbs as a ganache. Chai latte was up to par, cinnamon finish with a pretty design - nice touch!

I do want to try their French Toast and their coffee smelled great sooo be on the look out for my follow up folks- it's coming!",2.0
"Milk & Honey does a solid breakfast, with something to offer for most. The food was prepared right in front of us, and was awesome to see, very Food Channel TV feeling to see the chef start from scratch, to the quick BAM! of seasonings to finish off the plates. They were out of Orange Juice, which was a bit disappointing for a breakfast  place to be so, but otherwise it was a good experience.",4.0
"Love this cafe, food was very delicious, everything is good except the restroom! The restroom was too gloomy and weird and kind of scary！",3.0
"Years after its opening, I remain a big fan of this place - funny, friendly baristas with the right service mentality, varied uptempo music, tasty food and top-notch coffees and teas. They keep upgrading the decor, menu and adding seating. A community favorite.  When the weather warms up, hard to beat sitting outside. Great place to work, do deals, study, relax, bring family/friends. Wifi works well. Looking forward to their owner's bakery opening next door.",5.0
First time here and the food was pretty good. Ordered the Egyptian poached eggs and eggs Benedict. I got it with the Lavender lemonade drink and it was really good! All my friends loved the drink and wanted one but I got the last one. My friend got ginger honey but it tasted like water. Overall a good experience and a cute spot for brunch. There were seats outside and open windows. It was nice brunch place with the sun on you and fresh air. The place does not take cards; cash only and you gotta go up to order and pay when you order.,5.0
"This a cute, chill spot. It was moderately packed on a Saturday afternoon, but people were considerate enough to leave after they have finished their meal to let customers waiting sit for their meal.I came here for brunch and a catch-up session with my friend who lived nearby and didn't want to travel too far from home. Looking at the menu, they had a few different breakfast, brunch dishes to choose from, as well as some entrees, and coffees and teas. I did not see the tea menu until after I ordered a drink, or else I'd definitely get some of their interesting sounding teas! The salmon eggs benedict was good! Smoked salmon was real tasty. Their french toast also tasted pretty good, but be warned, it gets soggy if you wait too long, so consume quick! The chai latte I ordered wasn't as good as I have previously had from other places.. But their peach blossom tea smelled great.The pricing.. is okay. Brunch was never cheap to begin with. Will I be back? I believe yes. This is a pretty nice catch-up spot to grab some food in the middle of the afternoon.",4.0
"Had the french toast and Egyptian poached eggs, and both were supreme. The French toast was crispy, not too sweet, and had a tasteful strawberry compote along with walnuts, bananas, and syrup - perfection! And the eggs were savory with onions accompanying the avocado as well as crispy breadcrumbs as a ganache. Chai latte was up to par, cinnamon finish with a pretty design - nice touch! Strong characters working here, but good food.",5.0
"Had the croque madame. Mediocre and dry with very little cheese or béchamel sauce. I've never had a bad one before so it was a bit of a shock. Still, it's gorgeous inside, loved the vibe and my coffee was great.",3.0
"So, I heard about this place and was happy it was in my neighborhood.  First thing i didn't like was having  to stand in line order first and then find a seat. Pay first and they requested a tip right away. Anyway, the staff was friendly.  I came to do my online Christmas shopping but we can't use tablets or laptops on the weekend, understandable.  The food was good I ordered salmon eggs benedict.  Nice family place.  If you are looking for brunch cocktails dont look here.  Overall it's a comfy neighborhood brunch spot.",3.0
"Yikes. My boyfriend and I made the mistake of coming here at about 7:15 tonight, thinking we'd have almost 2 hours since it closes at 9 every night (according to Yelp, Menupages, Google, and the coffee shop's own website). The server seemed slightly annoyed from the beginning that we were there, but not enough to really bother us.   Until 8:00pm when he decided abruptly to close the shop. A full hour early, without any warning. With probably 6 or 7 other customers sitting there trying to finish their coffee and food which they ordered because they thought they would have till 9 to finish it. The barista just suddenly yelled out something about how he was closing right then because he had to be in at 6:30am (our fault I guess).  We kind of rolled our eyes and figured he'd at least let me finish my coffee while he cleaned up. Instead, he waited maybe 60 seconds before hollering, ""Guess it's time to put the CLOSING MUSIC ON!!!!"" and cranking techno music up loudly in order to get his customers to leave the store, instead of staying and perhaps spending more money over the course of the next hour, which I guess would have been annoying. His friend laughed at us while we got up and left - I assume she was the reason he was closing.Which would be forgivable and almost endearing if we were talking about some 19-year-old kid, but this guy was like 35 years old and I would assume knows enough about customer service, basic interpersonal skills, and the reality that small neighborhood businesses depend on those things in order to stay open, to know that you don't treat your customers this way. If you need to close early, just politely give people a 15-minute warning and explain what's up. Don't literally CHASE people out of your store. You're CHASING business away. Do the owners know this is how this dude runs the shop when they are away? Treating customers as though they're inconveniencing him just by showing up and GIVING HIM MONEY? The truth of the matter is that a lot of people in this neighborhood are struggling-insert-whatever-underappreciated-artist-job that applies working day jobs to get by, myself included. Still you are not working at a nightclub in Manhattan, we didn't wait in line around the block to get in, and it wasn't five o'clock in the morning, it was 8 on a Tuesday. So feel superior if that makes your job more tolerable, but not too much -- you're still a middle-aged barista like so many others trying to make your exorbitant rent. Deal with reality better, and don't punish people you are relying on to make money at your side-job.",2.0
"This is literally my favorite place in the 'hood. It's a little on the expensive but everything is ALWAYS fresh and the cook staff knows my face and is always pleasant.

Also, peanut butter/chocolate cookie is heavenly!My only qualms with this place are:1) they have no definitive closing time. I've walked over there with cravings for something and they'd be closed or closing, at 6:30, 5:10, 7:28, whatever time they pick that day, which is quite disappointing and keeps me from going often unless I'm in a walking mood; they don't answer the phone.2) They don't take credit card.

"What a nice spot isolated from the more popular neighborhoods.  We came here for lunch on a chilly Saturday afternoon and was pleasantly surprised.  Quick service and cash only, if i recall correctly.  We ordered a dirty chai, peach blossom tea, Egyptian eggs Benedict, and grilled flank steak panini.  Drinks were good, made exactly right and was the perfect option for a chilly day.  Eggs Benedict was different and filling, but definitely tasty.  The panini was not so great, however.  The grilled flank steak was more of a cold cut roast beef meat and cold.  Could've used some more heat on the panini, but overall a good experience.",4.0

Not sure if the person I dealt with the first time around is still working there but perhaps he was just having a bad day.  Wifi was slow but it's free...no big deal. Glad I came back for a second try! I'll be back.,4.0
"Great food, nice atmosphere. The only thing off about this place was that it is a seat and order yourself type of place.my girlfriend and I did not realize that and stood at the door for a good minute waiting to be seated before we realize that. Boy we must have looked so stupid in that minute. All so they are cash only so make sure to bring some cash with you when you come. Besides these two points, it was a great experience.",4.0
"The coffee is absolutely amazing, I've tried only half of their menu and everything so far is delicious and more than what I've expected. I live in the neighborhood and I'm definitely happy this is close to my houseMy favorite dish is probably the turkey avocado sandwich. Trust me, I believe everyone should try it",5.0
"What an adorable place! It is a great place to have a date, catch up with some friends,  or study.  Their coffee is the best I have tasted yet in NYC. I ordered a grilled vegetable sandwich that was just so flavorful and the dressing on the salad wasn't overwhelming at all (I'm usually a lemon juice kind of girl). The staff was really courteous and welcoming.  I'll be coming back to try out everything else on the menu!",5.0
"Great little Brooklyn gem. Breakfast here is very enjoyable, coffee and juices also great. You'll mostly see young hipsters here on their laptops on a typical day. Used to be cash only, but now accept credit cards! Welcome to the 21st century, Brooklyn!",4.0
"Pretty good overall; best faux bougie spot in the area.  Aloof staff says dumb stuff like, ""Coffee is out for the day - we close at six"" at 4pm.  The staff isn't good with basic problem solving but the product is good.",3.0
"Came here twice and loved the food and drinks both times. I've tried the smoked salmon sandwich, grilled flank steak panini, iced americano, and their flat white. The smoked salmon sandwich was really filling, with lots of cream cheese and salmon. It came with a small salad on a wooden board which looked really cute but was quite heavy. The grilled steak panini is my favorite. It also came with roasted potatoes on the side. The drinks were both really well made.  It wasn't too bitter that I needed to add sugar into. The appearance of the place inside and outside is really relaxing. It's a nice cafe to just chill and talk with a cup of coffee with your friends. Overall I would be coming back to try other things on their menu!",5.0
"I love this place , the food is delicious and the costumer service is really good . They are friendly .",4.0
"I like this place because it is nice and tucked away. The decor is awesome..yes very hipster but in a cool non-douchy sense. And yeah i can say this with no shame...all the bathroom needs is a garden just like the one they have near the entrance. I will not name the particular person (if you read other reviews you will understand). I do not know what or who irritated the person, but the 2 times i have been here this person just cant seem to be nice or happy about being in this establishment. You have pretty decent teas and some awesome food. There is no need to be so down. Maybe if there were more lights. Anyways...The food is divine. Egyptian pouched eggs (you will find it spelled as ""eegs"" just to let ya know), breakfast potatos, mos def the croquet madam. The green hot sauce added to anything makes the world a better place. My lavendar mint tea was nice and light...but come on.....no real sugar? Not even that hippy sugar that comes in the brown packet?",3.0
"Not a bad cafe slash brunch place. Coffee was good, breakfast sammich was good. My order of extra avocado didn't arrive on time but whatevs. My order was taken with a wee bit of impudence by an employee who may or may not love people or his job. That's ok, too, but it'll drop you a star for the mediocre customer service.",3.0

"I wouldn't recommend this spot for breakfast or brunch. The options are extremely limited and unflavorful. I ordered a breakfast sandwich and the wife ordered a breakfast taco. We've never put so much ketchup on our food to elicit flavor. Additionally, this place was cash only. I had to pay $1.75 from their ATM to withdraw. The $1.75 was the tip they would have received. Seriously it's the the 21 century. Accept credit cards and increase the price of all menu items by the merchant fee you'd pay. The ambiance was nice hence the two stars.",2.0
"I'll change my review to 5 stars when start to accept credit cards. No biggie, but it should be an option in the 21st Century. Love the food, ambience, big windows and the staff is pretty cool.",4.0
"My boyfriend and I visited Milk & Honey cafe this past Saturday. We took a long walk over from the Brooklyn College area and found ourselves arriving at the cafe around noon. The place is situated on a corner, boasting large floor to ceiling windows which were all open to let the warm air and sun in. Though it was a bit crowded we were able to easily find a seat near the counter looking out onto the street.After a minute of deliberation--the menu offers a lot of quite varied options, ranging from omelettes to sandwiches, all with an unexpected flair, and of course standard breakfast fare like french toast--we decided on the Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict for me, and the Grilled Flank Steak Sandwich for him. I also ordered an Iced coffee, which was a delicious cold brew, while he got an Arnold Palmer--which is not on the menu, but should be! You need to go up to the counter to order, which we did, and got our drinks right away, and a number for the table. I took off one star simply because they either forgot our order or took an absurd amount of time to prepare it. Though we hardly noticed the wait as we were not in a rush and enjoying the atmosphere and our drinks, it was about a half an hour before we walked back up to check on our order, at which time we were assured we were ""next"". Afterwards it was maybe another 10 minutes. The place did not seem crowded enough for a wait that long.The food, despite the wait, was excellent. The Steak Sandwich was unique in that it had a spicy sauce, and came with a small side of greens and potatoes. The eggs came with potatos and salad as well, and was served on an english muffin. They were poached, with runny yolks, and served on an english muffin with smoked salmon. There wasn't much hollandaise sauce, but it was a good meal nonetheless.Even considering the wait, I will certainly be back. This is a fantastic place for a breakfast with a friend or significant other, with great food, great coffee, and a great atmosphere. One of my favorite places out in my neck of the woods.",4.0
Ordered a delicious tea. Tried to buy a second bag of it because I was instantly hooked. Guy said he didn't have enough to sell me more despite having a jar half full of tea.....Is he saving the tea for some sort of Tea VIP? Whas da problem here?!,2.0
Everything tastes good and fresh. It's the conner cafe that I wish it's near my house.,4.0
"Wow! I have no idea what happened, but it was a completely different experience this time around.The service was not welcoming at all. The cashier was cold and made me feel like I was bothering her. The owner/manager was rude and when I simply asked for water in a plastic to-go cup, he just respnded, ""It'll cost you money"". Um, weird, he could have at least quoted me a price. But obviously an answer like that was to tell me no. Jeez, I would have gladly paid extra for a cup! No need to be so rude and off-putting to a paying customer!This definitely left a bad impression, but I let it go and just waited for my food. I had the zesty chicken sandwich, it was more balsamic flavored than actually zesty. The balsamic flavor is actually a bit overwhelming and the chicken was too thin to taste. The side salad was also overdressed and drenched in dressing.Super disappointing since I was in love with this place (as you can tell from my previous review). So subpar food and unappreciative service? No thanks, I will not be returning.",1.0
"I love this place because its a walking distance from where I live. We don't have Starbucks near by .. just crappy dunkin donuts and this wonderful cafe establishment!Their latte is great! Perfectly steamed milk and just right..quality of espresso ! The people who work there are so delightful !! They are much nicer than the people at Quattro ( their other shop) . However , the food taste better in Quattro! I just wish they were open for longer hours..",5.0
"Nice quiet spot (with good reggae music selection) that offers food that tastes good but healthy. Great spot for a weekday bite to eat that is more than cereal or oatmeal lol although the weekend menu only has French toast. Fresh brewed teas, delicious pastries and quick service.Parking can be a little tough depending on the time of the morning on a weekday, since there is a school right across the street.",4.0

"The vibe of Milk and Honey was exactly what I was looking for this morning. I know the way a place looks doesn't necessarily dictate the quality of the goods, but the atmosphere was fantastic. Lots of wood and a long bar. The open-air style combined with one of the best cappuccinos I've ever had made for a great Sunday morning with my girlfriend. Will be back.",5.0

Omg yum.  The French toast was so good! Just go in and order. We waited for a minute until we realized there was no host/ess. Atmosphere is great for Sunday brunch. Great menu and great prices. Will be coming back!,5.0
The best word that comes to mind when describing this place is: Sunday. The place feels the way Sunday does. When you're too bored to commit to going anywhere so you wanna read the paper in a bright and sunny establishment with a delicious iced coffee and eggs.

"The ambiance alone is a reason to at least come get a coffee at this place. I love the garden on the wall, and the layout is rustic and wooden. The breakfast might be a bit overpriced, but for a once in a while treat, this place does what it intends to do. I had the Egyptian eggs once and it was very good. I also appreciate that there is no wi-fi on the weekends. Some people might not like that, but I think it's good to keep things moving on the weekends, instead of having people planted in their seats taking up the entire place for hours because they're refreshing their Facebook feed and nursing the drink they ordered 4 hours ago. So all in all, it's worth coming by.",4.0
Awesome layout and good coffee. Service was pleasant and they have a respectable selection of breakfast items.

"Great ambiance. We were served by the owner himself who was very friendly. The shop is beautiful - big open windows to let in lots of sunlight and the decor has just a hint of the Middle East (I think the owner is Egyptian). We read about this shop in By Way of Brooklyn and weren't disappointed. For coffee, they were serving Counter Cultures' Apollo, which is always a fav. The cappuccino was well crafted with some nice latte art, even if the foam was the tiniest bit dry. We tried a Reese's peanut butter cup cookie as well, which was nice. Overall a pleasant experience",4.0
"This is a very nice, little cafe tucked away on newkirk. It has a beautiful decor and a relaxing ambience.i had the quinoa tubbuleh and eggs and it was healthy, delicious and filling. There's no table service so you pay at the counter. Would recommend for brunch if you live close by.",4.0
"I'm excited to have a new coffee shop in the area. Normally I do breakfast at Madelines, but it's been hit or miss lately so we came down to check out Milk & Honey. Their breakfast sandwich and Egyptian eggs were excellent.It's a great spot to relax and chat or get some work done over a cup of coffee. It's nice and bright and there's lots of space.",5.0
The only reason I don't give it five stars is because they don't accept credit cards. Located on a quiet block with easy parking .Good food. Not too crowded. Get the bagel with lox yum!,4.0

Came here on a Saturday morning. Wasn't packed. You have to walk up to the counter to order your food. The drinks are also listed on the wall. I had the French toast. I didn't really like it much.

The shop is beautiful - big open windows to let in lots of sunlight and the decor has just a hint of the Middle East (I think the owner is Egyptian). We read about this shop in By Way of Brooklyn and weren't disappointed. For coffee, they were serving Counter Cultures' Apollo, which is always a fav. The cappuccino was well crafted with some nice latte art, even if the foam was the tiniest bit dry. We tried a Reese's peanut butter cup cookie as well, which was nice. Overall a pleasant experience",4.0
"This is a very nice, little cafe tucked away on newkirk. It has a beautiful decor and a relaxing ambience.i had the quinoa tubbuleh and eggs and it was healthy, delicious and filling. There's no table service so you pay at the counter. Would recommend for brunch if you live close by.",4.0
"I'm excited to have a new coffee shop in the area. Normally I do breakfast at Madelines, but it's been hit or miss lately so we came down to check out Milk & Honey. Their breakfast sandwich and Egyptian eggs were excellent.It's a great spot to relax and chat or get some work done over a cup of coffee. It's nice and bright and there's lots of space.",5.0

Came here on a Saturday morning. Wasn't packed. You have to walk up to the counter to order your food. The drinks are also listed on the wall. I had the French toast. I didn't really like it much.

The orange juice is fresh squeezed, which is a big plus.  Baked goods, as well as everything else, is so fresh and delicious every time. One of my favorite foods is avocado, and it breaks my heart when I go somewhere that prepares avocado that is too ripe or not ripe enough. I have to say that Milk & Honey always serves up avocado that is perfect. In summation, fresh food, comfy atmosphere, pretty decent prices.",4.0

"I'm a fan! I went and had a great experience. Very open and spacious. I had the iced Ethiopian coffee and it's brewed to my liking (not so dark), their milk is local from Battenkill valley creamery, and they have a lot of options for sweeteners (from agave to white sugar). I enjoyed their ""number one"" on the menu, breakfast item: egg cheddar and turkey bacon on an english muffin. It's great, cheesy and hot, the egg is cooked with care, and the turkey bacon isn't some cheap-o stuff you find in a crappy supermarket. I've gone twice already and plan on stopping there more for my morning coffee. The owner opened Qathra on cortelyou, so if you like that, you'll like this.",4.0

The streets near there are very eye-pleasing in scenery during the autumn, so its very human presence was nice. Quiet is a good word for it. I came on a Sunday. However, every seat might be taken up -- but then again what cafe isn't that has outlets. The only thing that might pester me is that it is October and the whole open-door front to the entire place might have been a bit too cold. I get the coffee of the day because it is the cheapest cup at $2.50 ... and hey, they have sticky buns, that's good.",4.0
"The waitstaff was helpful, straightforward, and no fuss.  One thing that I need to mention is that no credit cards are accepted.  I wanted to try their meals, but I had only 2 or 3 dollars on me.  I saw the portions and smelled the delicious wafting fumes of my neighbors on either side of me.  I opted for the chai tea which was worth it.  I think it was $2.50.  Students are on their laptops writing their papers and studying.  Parents are sitting with their cute babies and catching up.  There is plenty of seating and the place has an open layout so fresh air is able to come in and circulate unlike some coffee shops which seem dimly lit.  It has bright lighting and fresh greenery feel.  I would come back.",4.0
"Was in the neighborhood for work and had an hour to kill, so I decided to try this place out based on the reviews. It was definitely a good choice. Food was excellent, service was excellent. I had the zesty chicken sandwich and ginger peach iced tea. The mushrooms on the sandwich were a little balsamic-y, but I love balsamic so I didn't mind. The bread was delicious and the mozzarella was great as well. Only complaint is that most of my chicken ended up on the first half of my sandwich, so my second half was pretty much mushroom and cheese, but, again, it was really good so I didn't mind. The tea was also very yummy. I'm usually and little hesitant to try iced teas because I don't like the bitter aftertaste you get with strong brews, but this was very light and refreshing which made me pretty happy.

The place is spacious and bright; a perfect place for lunch with a friend or a quiet Saturday doing work. My only qualm lies with the awful, awful stools/chairs throughout the place. They are too high for the tables and too uncomfortable for a long-sit down. As soon as those go, this 4-star review will become a 5.",4.0
"I am a huge, huge fan of Ox Cart which is a block away, but they do get pricey if you go there frequently. Milk & Honey is a more affordable, equally delicious spot with more of a homey farm feel to it. Everything I've had is good, I can't complain. The orange juice is fresh squeezed, which is a big plus.  Baked goods, as well as everything else, is so fresh and delicious every time. One of my favorite foods is avocado, and it breaks my heart when I go somewhere that prepares avocado that is too ripe or not ripe enough. I have to say that Milk & Honey always serves up avocado that is perfect. In summation, fresh food, comfy atmosphere, pretty decent prices.",4.0
"Beautiful place to hang out or have a pretty good sandwich. Amazing coffee plus you notice they know a lot about it. Great service! Not a great place to work because there are not too many outlets, but definitely recommended if you live in the neighborhood!",5.0
"amazing coffee place. And Thank You very much for great cappuccino, the best one in the city",5.0
"I'm a fan! I went and had a great experience. Very open and spacious. I had the iced Ethiopian coffee and it's brewed to my liking (not so dark), their milk is local from Battenkill valley creamery, and they have a lot of options for sweeteners (from agave to white sugar). I enjoyed their ""number one"" on the menu, breakfast item: egg cheddar and turkey bacon on an english muffin. It's great, cheesy and hot, the egg is cooked with care, and the turkey bacon isn't some cheap-o stuff you find in a crappy supermarket. I've gone twice already and plan on stopping there more for my morning coffee. The owner opened Qathra on cortelyou, so if you like that, you'll like this.",4.0
"While the ambience was divine, the food was not so delicious. There was a steady stream of customers coming in and out while I was there, which is good for business but, along with the loud music, made it difficult to concentrate on my book. I would give milk and honey a second shot, but it's not anything to obsess over.",3.0

"A very nicely set up space, quite larger in space than I imagined,it sits on the corner of a very quiet street. The streets near there are very eye-pleasing in scenery during the autumn, so its very human presence was nice. Quiet is a good word for it. I came on a Sunday. However, every seat might be taken up -- but then again what cafe isn't that has outlets. The only thing that might pester me is that it is October and the whole open-door front to the entire place might have been a bit too cold. I get the coffee of the day because it is the cheapest cup at $2.50 ... and hey, they have sticky buns, that's good.",4.0
"The waitstaff was helpful, straightforward, and no fuss.  One thing that I need to mention is that no credit cards are accepted.  I wanted to try their meals, but I had only 2 or 3 dollars on me.  I saw the portions and smelled the delicious wafting fumes of my neighbors on either side of me.  I opted for the chai tea which was worth it.  I think it was $2.50.  Students are on their laptops writing their papers and studying.  Parents are sitting with their cute babies and catching up.  There is plenty of seating and the place has an open layout so fresh air is able to come in and circulate unlike some coffee shops which seem dimly lit.  It has bright lighting and fresh greenery feel.  I would come back.",4.0
"Was in the neighborhood for work and had an hour to kill, so I decided to try this place out based on the reviews. It was definitely a good choice. Food was excellent, service was excellent. I had the zesty chicken sandwich and ginger peach iced tea. The mushrooms on the sandwich were a little balsamic-y, but I love balsamic so I didn't mind. The bread was delicious and the mozzarella was great as well. Only complaint is that most of my chicken ended up on the first half of my sandwich, so my second half was pretty much mushroom and cheese, but, again, it was really good so I didn't mind. The tea was also very yummy. I'm usually and little hesitant to try iced teas because I don't like the bitter aftertaste you get with strong brews, but this was very light and refreshing which made me pretty happy. All in all, I'd definitely go back the next time I'm in the area!!",5.0
Great place to enjoy good cafe food. The lobster bisque was delicious and loved the little leaf design on my latte. The best thing about this cafe is that its halal. Its a nice change of scenery from all the desi places we normally eat in.,5.0

"Great decor and music, however, service is mediocre and not welcoming.  Maybe because I'm not white, hipster, or both.  I live upstairs/next door so I often stop by in the mornings to pick up a pasty on my way to work, but always feel like I'm intruding or begging to be serve, and never with a greeting or smile on their faces.  The pastries are a hit or miss- sometimes the cheese croissants are light and flaky, but recently an almond croissant was stale.  A few weeks ago, the guy gave the woman in front of me the wrong pastry item, asked for it back, and proceeded to hand it directly to me.  It was in a brown paper bag that she had already put into her purse.  I was a little weirded out by that.  This isn't exactly shopping for shoes at the clearance rack; it's an edible food item.  Most of the time they forget to include a napkin in there and when I asked for one the other day, he rudely said ""there's already one"".  Sorry, but giving me a second napkin wouldn't be that detrimental to your bottom line.  At a minimum of $3 a pastry, it isn't exactly cheap, and with plenty of other coffee shops nearby, it's not like one doesn't have options.",2.0

No no, but for serious though: gorgeous and airy space (any reviewers mention the huge garden thing hanging off the wall yet??) and really attentive, sweet counter-staff.

I had a good time here. Lucky a couple was leaving and my sister and wife and baby with a small stroller were able to snag two tables. Seating is tough and I'm not a fan of the bar tables with raised stools. They seem to run out of menus for such a small place. And they seem to run out of cups too. I just don't get why and I suggest they just get a dozen or so more. There are no waiters you order at the counter and the cooks bring it out. The prices seemed fair and their homemade sodas are great. I like how they make the iced coffee drinks like cocktails. Shaken. The food was well done and reasonably priced. They didn't bother us or rush us because we were sitting for a while with a baby. They have a no computer rule on the weekend which I think is great. I'd go again because its so close to my apt.
