"Stopped by for a nightcap and the food options were too good to pass up even though we just had dinner!The olives ($4) were a huge portion of chili spiced mixed olives. Jamon Serrano  ($6) was also a big portion. Little necks are a buck each and they have $1 happy hour oysters.A cute, cozy atmosphere that's good for dates. And there's a communal table in the front that would be good for groups.Service was also very attentive and welcoming.",5.0
"Pros+Good dollar oysters.Cons- Extremely slow service.- Super pretentious decor. Trying for Williamsburg in the most pejorative sense.- Drinks tasted like they came out of a cooler at a frat party. Sticky sweet, tasted like hi-c.- Ordered charcuterie platter. After waiting a while, we were informed that everything was thrown out because of a visiting health inspector.- Our bill had an error.",2.0
"We had the shrimp cocktail and six oysters. It was all delicious. I always like it when I see the guy shucking the oysters smelling each one before plating it. I've only ever seen that at Maison Premiere, but they do it here too. For cocktails, the Dark and Stormy was a nice balance of spicy and sweet. The Sazerac was generous and delicious.",5.0
"My boyfriend and I were in the neighborhood seeing a band and had the amazing tipsy idea to get oysters. The service was excellent, even late night. We ordered a few different kinds of oysters and a charcuterie plate. Both were delicious.  We had some clams, which can be kind of a let down next to the deliciousness that are oysters, but they were clean and fresh.I was told they have dollar oysters for happy hour every day  - even weekends. I will be back!",5.0
"If you like cocktails and you like oysters, this is one of the best places you can hit in Brooklyn.First of all, the space is gorgeous! The ambiance is clearly nautical but without being overwhelmingly so. In fact, the first thing you'll notice is probably that there's a lot of leather in this bar. Nice, dark leather chairs and sofas by the fireplace on the back. There is also a beautiful, big garden at the back with a beautiful fountain.There are two bars: a large, full-bar right by the entrance, and a smaller one in front of the shucking station. The latter is where you want to be: close to the action. When we went there they had 6 different oysters on offer, all at $2.25 ea, except for the HH oysters (Montauk) at $1[1]. We tried them all: Montauk, Malpeque, Beaver Tail, Willey Point, Gigacup, and Wianno. My favorite were the Gigagup (small size, meaty and rich) and the Wianno (nicely salty and slightly sweet, with perhaps the most beautiful cup I've ever seen).Interestingly, they have the largest variety of mignonette and other oyster sauces, some of them very inventive (and very tasty). I usually like my oysters plain, perhaps with a couple of drops of lemon, but I couldn't help try some of the various sauces, and they were all great.The food menu is compact, offering a cheese platter, a charcuterie platter, a combination platter, a chicken liver pâté, a pork terrine platter, and a burrata and tomato one. Both the pork terrine and the burrata were excellent[2].The cocktail list is very impressive. They have a full cocktail menu of classics, plus 4 seasonal ones. Being a Beck fan, I couldn't resist the lure of the Devil's Haircut: Mezcal, apricot jam, fresh lemon, lemon verbena, burnt rosemary. The Reviver was equally good, alongside a perfect Sazerac from the main list. Moreover, all cocktails are a reasonable $11.Even though it's clear that they put a lot of thought into designing this place, the overall vibe is warm and welcoming. This is a great place for a first date if you want to impress your date without taking him/her to a stuffy place; or to catch up with a friend; or to just sit at the bar, enjoy a cocktail and a few oysters, unwind and relax.The staff is friendly and clearly enthusiastic about the place.This place makes me miss my old stomping ground of Ft. Greene/Clinton Hill even more. Can't wait to come back.--------------[1] Their oyster HH is a bit unusual in that they have one oyster at $1 all day until they run out of that oyster.[2] Having just opened, they're planning to expand the food menu and offer more, rotating dishes soon. A seafood tower is in the works. They also have Little Neck and Top Neck clams, $0.80 ea.",5.0
"This used to be called Choysters but I guess they've changed the name? In any case, this was a mixed experience. As others have mentioned, the highlights included the space, for sure - you feel like you've stepped into a local bar in Nantucket, or something like that. I took a peek in the backyard and was impressed with the set-up back there as well - it looks like it would be perfect for summer lounging. I also loved the fireplace and the couches in front of it. Though we sat at the back in a booth, it definitely helped transport you to a different time and place. Unfortunately we chose Choysters/Copper Cliff for the oysters and the night we were there our waitress informed us, sounding prettyunapologetic, that the oysters would take a lot of time that evening. When we asked for an estimate she didn't have one, and since we were on a tighter schedule, we opted for something else. It was also very hard to get her attention throughout the night - each time we needed something, we basically had to flag her down; she never came to our table. We did end up getting a delicious meat and cheese platter, however, and the server who delivered that to our table gave us a lovely rundown of our order - and the portions were generous (relative to our charcuterie/cheese platters, which I consider myself someone of an expert in). I will probably be back to Copper Cliff but it's clear there's still some kinks they are working out.",3.0
"I had a taste for clams this past week! This place did not disappoint. Cozy, low lighting, nice furnishings, friendly staff, great raw bar, awesome prices and a fine glass of Sauvignon Blanc...",5.0
Let me just start by saying I'm not into oysters but if you are this place is just amazing.Beautiful display of probably 6 to 10 different types if oysters right by the bar.One of my help buddies wrote a review and it really intrigued me to check them out. No regretsFrom the ceiling to the wall decor this outshines all others.Love the wooden ceiling made to look like your on a ship.Plenty if seating including at the bar and an outside area with a water fountainThe drinks are pretty unique I recommend the revivor,5.0
"Love this place! Service is so important to me, I've been to multiple oyster bars in Brooklyn that were just plain bad! The service here is amazeballs! The bartender is great and makes the cocktails perfectly. Strong and tasty! Oysters were fresh and so tasty and meaty! Just wish they had more food options on the menu. They were out of about 3 items on the menu which sucks when you only have about 7 menu options. All in all this will be my new oyster spot! I will be dragging my husband there tonight. It's my weekly thing",5.0
"Really in to it. A respectable selection of oysters and a beautiful space. I wish there was a little extra on the menu we could have ordered food-wise, but overall it was a great experience. Also great-- it had a great chill, 'not-too-packed' but 'not-too-empty' atmosphere for a Saturday night at 9. Though I'm sure this place will pick up speed quickly... Will definitely be back.",4.0

"Was eyeing the oyster happy hour and figured we would check it out Saturday afternoon...so glad we did.  Haven't had such a good oyster experience in several weeks.  Not only did the bartender Kelvin give samples of wines, beers and some red wine thingy(can't remember the name).  The oyster selection was great had different varies to pick from which were ones we never had before and even some oysters I've only had in Rhode Island.  The charructure place was well balanced with the meat, cheeses and olives. Even my friend who is scared of oysters sample several and I think we might converted her.",5.0

"I am so glad I happened to walk by this place last night and went in for a drink. The ambience and decoration perfectly match the cozy and laid-back spirit of Brownstone Clinton Hill. It is not too loud so you can have a conversation and the waiter had great recommendations on drinks. Happy hour until 8pm includes $1 oysters, which were absolutely delicious. The crowd is friendly and we ended up chatting with they guys next to us for a while. If you are looking for a drink at a relaxing place with a great bar or you feel like a dozen oysters this is definitely a great spot! I'll be coming back often.",5.0
"This is an unassuming gem of a place. The mood is laid back and comfortable, the drinks are spot on and the oysters and food are delicious. The bartenders are friendly, attentive, professional and accommodating. Drinks are perfectly balanced (with fresh ingredients or syrups if required). The oysters are varied, fresh and their homemade shallot vinaigrette that comes with the oysters is sooo good (you may want to just chug that at some point, haha). We also had the charcuterie and cheese plate with a good variety of each. The menu is limited right now (they are a relatively new place), so know that there aren't ""meals"" there yet. But definitely recommend going there for a nice, relaxing time with good drinks and light snacks.",5.0
"I'm so excited that this place is here! The $1 oysters are great, I love the ambiance and the service is wonderful. Nice solid beer selection. Outdoor area looks like it'll be a place I'll frequent once it gets warmer out. It's a good spot to bring friends who come in from other neighborhoods, and you want to take them somewhere nice (but not snooty or expensive).",5.0
This is my new favorite bar in the area. My boyfriend and I were planning to have dinner next door and decided to stop by Choyster's for a drink beforehand. I'm so glad we did! The drinks were delicious. The bartender could not have been more warm and welcoming. The bar just had a great vibe and I look forward to going back soon.,5.0
"Great atmosphere and decor, very cozy. Went for a drink with a girlfriend to catch up.

"So happy to have stumbled onto this brand new, fantastic addition to the Clinton Hill neighborhood! Beautiful leather seating, speakeasy-esque feel without the pretension, and dollar oysters 7 days a week all night until they run out!? Say it ain't so. The drink menu is very high quality, enjoyed my strong but smooth gin cocktail. The bartender and servers are super enthusiastic and happy to be working there.  The outdoor backyard space is beautiful and spacious and a great place to sip on a cocktail and throw back oysters on a fall night. Love it here, will be back very soon to sample the charcuterie plates and all the cocktails.",5.0
"Copper Cliff is the real deal: Serious mixologists crafting some of the best cocktails I've ever tasted. Plus, zero pretense from the staff, a super chill atmosphere and delicious snacks! Kelvin made us our first round of drinks. My husband and I asked for a custom concoction: Something boozy with mezcal and preferably bitter. What he made blew us away! A smooth and elegant cocktail with mezcal, bitters, a quinine liquer and a wormwood liquer. I literally didn't want it to end! Next up, Rob made us a riff on the classic shaken penicillin cocktail using mezcal and a scotch float. When I took a sip from the top, the peatiness of the scotch dominated. But when I sipped from the straw, the citrus and ginger flavors took center stage. It was one of the most unexpected shaken mezcal cocktails I've ever had! For snacks: a dozen $1 oysters and meat and cheese. Everything was so fresh and delicious. We are definitely going back as soon as possible.",5.0
