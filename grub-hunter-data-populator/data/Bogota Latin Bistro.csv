"The food here was very delicious. I ordered the coconut French toast with amazinnnnng guava butter, scrambled eggs, Colombian chorizo and a guava mimosa. Came on a Saturday morning and it was surprisingly not packed. Server was attentive and kind. Establishment had a nice, relaxing atmosphere. I'd definitely visit again!",5.0
"Check in to get a free shot! It's a nasty liquorice shot, though. So temper your expectations.Vegetarian empanada is great. I got the plantanos de todo, and it was good not great. Curious to come back and try more of the menu. The tres leches was an amazing desert.The wait was 20 minutes for a table for two on a Saturday night. I recommend getting reservations. The service was great.",4.0
"The food and drink here are on point. try the Brazilian Sangria... its like liquid gold in a cup. delicious and full of flavor. found the lack of chips and salsa as a starter (like bread) a bit cheap but the food is amazing. we had the empanada sampler and they did not disappoint. took a while to figure out which one was shrimp to be honest but they were all full of flavor. my friend had an arepa with queso blanco. that was delicious as well. main entrees were some giant meat platter and I got the fish tacos. everything was good, except when 1am hits the people want out. lights go on, they put chairs on the tables and basically make it feel like you should get the hell out. also they shut down all food and drink service at 1am, so if you wanted to stay for a drink they don't serve it. all in all I would come back, just earlier in the night to avoid the closing scenario",4.0
I really should eat here more because the prices are fair & you get A LOT of food.They also constantly have specials & happy hours. It can get a little bit rambunctious in there so maybe not the best environment for calm but fun on a going out night & they're open a bit later during the week too!,4.0
"Phenomenal drinks! That's all that matters right? Just kidding. Reservations were made a week in advance to celebrate my friends birthday. Please note that you will not be seated until more than half your party is there. Staff were really accommodating and friendly. I don't remember the name of our waiter but he was  very attentive, making sure that we were okay throughout the night. The atmosphere was pretty fun. Seems like a place that should have a dance floor after a certain time, because after a few drinks people are going to want to dance. They do play decent - good music. I had the white sangrita, I asked the bartender whether the red or white was sweeter and she said the white was less sweet and she was right! The passion fruit frozen margarita is also a favorite on our table. I think some of us had 3 rounds of that. The drinks are more towards the pricey side $11+. The food was good but not great. I like their complimentary plantain chips and their bomb MitiMiti sauce. I had the Arroz con Pollo. I thought that the rice was a bit too soggy for my liking but there was plenty of flavor. The chicken on the other hand was very dry. Had to soak it in some MitiMiti sauce. For the table we shared guac and chips and also a few arepas with cheese. Tasty and different! If you check in, you get a free shot (size of 2 shots actually) of Columbian rum. I passed because it smells like licorice and I hate licorice. Keep in mind that they charge per person if you bring a cake. $2 per person. Ouch! Altogether you can probably buy another cake with that. But, they do sing for you on your birthday!",4.0
"Bogota was AWESOME!!!! Great spot along 5th Ave, Park Slope 5th Ave that is! Came here with my lady for a rare weekday lunch together and left very satisfied and very full! Started off with some Happy Hour mojitos that hit the spot. Staff was very friendly, but was bummed out the plantain chips (I saw in Yelp reviews) were only for dinner! BUMMER!!!!! Anyway, I went right the Colombian Platter, rice, egg, steak, etc, etc, of deliciousness! Much to my surprise (or not), I quickly succeeded my magic act of making the food disappear. My wife went with the steak and she was very happy! I will be back for sure, other items I can't wait to try.......and I'll be back for those plantain chips!!!!",5.0
"The empanadas are absolutely perfect, and are also gluten free. I personally am addicted to the steak ones, and have walked miles to get to them... in the rain... 100% worth it. The staff is really friendly and the food is really good. For a while they had a check in offer that gets you a free alcoholic drink, which my husband used and said was good. It's a black licorice type flavor served with an orange wedge. The sauce they have at the table is so damn good. dump it on your empanadas with no shame and your taste buds & stomach will know true happiness.",5.0
I'm sorry but I just don't see anything special about this place. We got the empanadas which were good. But the egg with tortilla chips was bland as heck and the quesadilla had this weird sweet taste that was terrible. Since when is a quesadilla supposed to be sweet?. Not coming back.,2.0
Very good food but to pricey for the amount of food  they give you. .I went there spend $86 with my wife ..but left hungry. ...the aguardiente is awesome. ..very good deals on that. ...,5.0
"My girlfriends and I decided to try out bogota for dinner last night. When we arrived it was really busy, the bar was full and there were people waiting near the door. I thought we would have to wait but instead we were seated immediately. The seating arrangements here are a bit tight, at least where we were seated they were. But overall nice ambiance and vibrant decor.We checked in on Yelp and receive a free shot of Aguardiente. We were served the house plantain chips with red aji sauce. The menu is extensive and a bit overwhelming but our waiter gave us a few suggestions. We order a pitcher of red sangria which was great but quite expensive at 50.00. We ordered the fish tacos with a side of tostones and spinach all of which were delicious. Another friend ordered the bandeja paisa. She also enjoyed her meal and took home leftovers. We were so full we didn't order dessert but I'm looking forward to going back and trying the tres leche. Overall we had a really nice experience. The waiters were friendly and attentive. The food was flavorful and the sangria was sooo good!",4.0
"I went to Bogota Latin Bistro for Columbian food while visiting NYC.  It was a 20 minute wait before being seated. A hostess politely guided us to our seats. I had Colombian cornmeal empanadas (chicken) as an appetizer. Bogota chicken empanadas were tasty.  I had a hard time deciding on a meal, so Bogota Columbian Platter (grilled skirt steak, pork chicharron, white arepa, rice & beans, fried egg, maduros, avocado, & cabbage salad) caught my attention.  This platter was perfect for trying different meats and sides. Customers have a choice of red or black beans. I don't like beans but decided to try Bogota red beans since they had sausage mixed inside. The beans were delicious! All of the meats were cooked well and flavorful. The entire meal come together perfectly. For dessert, tres leches cake (one of my favorite desserts) was a no brainer. Bogota tres leches cake was delicious. I could have eaten an entire cake by myself. Our waitress gave excellent customer service. She was down to earth and stayed on top of our table. Bogota has a lively ambience (weekend). The restaurant isn't far from the Barclays (short walk). Bogota Latin Bistro is a good choice for Columbian food in Brooklyn. I give Bogota Latin Bistro a 4.5 rating rounded up to a 5 because of excellent service.",5.0
"I took my wife here for her birthday and we had a great time.  The food was excellent.  Drinks were also excellent.  We went on Colombian Independence Day and they had free shots so that was fun.  It's a little small inside, with sort of intimate lighting so you may be close to your neighbor.  Pretty busy for a weeknight, lots of people on dates and a few groups of friends.  Service was good, no complaints.I would love to try their brunch sometime.",4.0
"I tried this place with my husband and teen son thinking the food was going to be great based on the yelp reviews and ratings but have to say that we were all disappointed. My dish which was the arroz con pollo had the best flavor and was surprisingly pretty good because it had a lot of chicken and the chicken meat was not dry however, everything else we tried was over cooked, lacked in flavor and presentation and left much to be desired. I also ordered the corn on the cob and that was pretty good. But, don't think we will be revisiting. Just some quick additional comments: Our waiter didn't seem happy to answer any questions we had about the menu being as how it was our first time there. He had a bit of an attitude and didn't seem to know anything so it got a bit frustrating. We thought maybe there was a language barrier and being fluent in Spanish my husband decided to further communicate in Spanish, but still the guy gave the same face and attitude which if it weren't for the fact that we were really hungry and not wanting to ruin our family outing, we would've otherwise just gotten up and left! The decor in this place is interesting; But the one person (ONLY) bathroom is very small and awkward with the tiniest sink I've ever seen anywhere in my life! So tiny that it seems like a practical joke but isn't.",3.0
"Bogota is our absolute favorite. Hands down the best food, atmosphere, and staff in NYC. Thank you Shawn for always making us feel like family! Don't miss out on the chicken empanadas, the fish tacos, the Tortilla Soup, the drinks (any, really!), or the churros!",5.0

"This place is impressive on paper. First, they figured out how to make gluten free empanadas. Right there, I saluting to them with much respect. Also, when you walk in their wall is covered with achievements like being on the Inc list of 5000 fastest growing companies for the last 5 years. Like I said - impressive!Now to my experience: when I called, I was put on hold for about 5 minutes before I could place my order. When someone came back on the line, it took some time for the order to register.When I came to the place I was greeted by a friendly guy who was able to find my order quickly. As I looked at it, I wanted to remove one item but the kitchen said it was too late. After that, 3 different servers tried to help me pay for the same receipt... I just had to tell them that someone else already took care of it... I would say they were overly helpful. The food - it was good. No question about it. The taste was excellent and it was a lot more filling than I originally expected. With what we ordered for two people we had enough for lunch the next day. The gluten free empanadas were good as was the white queso arepa and guacamole. The sauces were good too. The one thing I was not crazy about was the amount of grease used for cooking. My sensitive stomach decided to revolt with a heart burn after the meal. My husband had the same food and he was fine.",4.0
"I love bogota. I come here once in a while with friends. They have good drinks. I like the anejo margaritas. I love the plantain chips they give you with the vinegar marinade sauce. You can purchase the sauce there. They have a green one and a red one. I love them both. The coconut shrimp is very good and so are the empanadas. The chicken empanada is my favorite and the black bean domino empanada is also good. I wasn't too crazy about the steak empanada. I've had the chicken and rice, which is very good. Last time I went, I had the pernil. I liked it a lot. I like that they give you two sides on the side so I had cilantro mashed potatoes and spinach. The spinach was great. There are many sides to choose from. Overall, I like this place. It's a great place to grab dinner and drinks with friends.",4.0
"This place is perfect whether you're coming here for a date, or with a large group of friends. The fish tacos with a side of coconut rice and cilantro mashed potatoes is soooo good.

And of course for dessert, you can't go wrong with their delicious churros!!",5.0
"My bff swears by this place! So it was about time that we went together. We went for dinner and happy hour drinks, yay! We were seated at the back enclosed patio and were greeted by our waitress, Denise. She was so nice, attentive, and was able to answer questions and make suggestions when I asked. She took our order and brought out a huge portion of plantain chips for the table with some kind of green dipping sauce. I don't know what the sauce was, but it wasn't anything special. The chips were good (especially after a number of frozen margaritas) haha. My friend ordered the fish tacos which looked great and I ordered the lentil soup, goat cheese empanada, and shrimp empanada which came with two dipping sauces. The empanadas were pretty good, I'd definitely order them again but I would pass on the soup. It was a Colombian style lentil soup which I think had too many herbs in it. I typically like herbs and the way they taste but I just think there were too many herbs in the soup which made it seem like herb overload for my taste. Oh! And I could I forget the margaritas! I ordered the plain frozen margaritas and they were delish. My friend ordered the negra modela beer which she seemed to really enjoy. Can't wait to go back!",4.0

Pro tip: if you check in on Yelp you get a free shot of aguardiente, but if you don't enjoy the flavor of anise maybe not for you.Also good are their juice ""shakes"" that you can get with water or milk. I prefer the guava fruit blended in water since the milk makes it too heavy to enjoy with the rest of the meal, but that's just our personal preference :)",5.0
"This restaurant is mediocre at best. The seating arrangements are very cramped and the chairs / tables belong in a public park, not a restaurant where you pay $50.00 a meal.

Probably would have tasted much better warm.It's nice to have a restaurant with a ethnic flair but don't compromise quality for quantity of sales as it will eventually catch up.",3.0

It was a busy night but we got a table in less than 30 min, the place is a little small but the food and drinks are worth it.

"This is a very popular spot in Park Slope, it's often hard to get a table for brunch. We made a reservation for 12, and we were very pleased with the overall vibe. The free aguardiente shots woke us up and kept us going for the day. We sat in the heated outdoor patio that had parrots and colored Christmas lights dangling from the ceiling. The menu had so many different options too- Latin cuisine, regular breakfast options, gluten free and vegan options as well. I was stuck on the tofu scramble, but last minute decided to order the Daisy's Eggs upon server recommendation. My friend got the Migas de Arepa, the two boys both got Latin Breakfasts, and our other friend got a Cubano. I clearly made the wrong choice, as when the food arrived, I received two small dishes. The server had said it was small- but also chose the two most expensive options to 'recommend' to us. $15 for a side salad and two sunny side up eggs with cheese and chorizo... No Bueno! We had also ordered the dip sampler, and it came with guac, bean dip, and pico de gallo. It was all very good, very well made. The sunny side up eggs mixed with cheese and chorizo and avocado made me quite nauseous. I'm normally not used to eating runny eggs, and the mixture of those foods left me feeling uneasy. The other drawback was the price. Our total came out to over $115. They had automatically added in a gratuity of $12.90 to our bill of $83!!!! (We were paying in two groups). What a rip off. It would have been fine if not for that, but it was still pretty expensive. Not to mention a small margarita cost $10. Good to try, but I'm never coming back here with my friends.",3.0

Pro tip: if you check in on Yelp you get a free shot of aguardiente, but if you don't enjoy the flavor of anise maybe not for you.Also good are their juice ""shakes"" that you can get with water or milk. I prefer the guava fruit blended in water since the milk makes it too heavy to enjoy with the rest of the meal, but that's just our personal preference :)",5.0
"This restaurant is mediocre at best. The seating arrangements are very cramped and the chairs / tables belong in a public park, not a restaurant where you pay $50.00 a meal. Your butt and back will hurt after sitting on these. Maybe they do this to make sure you don't sit too long and take up tables?The food was decent but came out cold for the many people at our table. Probably would have tasted much better warm.It's nice to have a restaurant with a ethnic flair but don't compromise quality for quantity of sales as it will eventually catch up.",3.0
"It is one of the best restaurants I've ever been, delicious food, very good drinks, the atmosphere is a bit noisy, and should be some colombian music to feel it more like a latin place.Our waiter was very attentive, it was our the first time there and it's really a good place. It was a busy night but we got a table in less than 30 min, the place is a little small but the food and drinks are worth it. Definitely be back soon.THE BEST MARGARITAS EVER, I TRY THE MOJITO TOO AND OMG, I LOVE IT.",5.0
"This is a very popular spot in Park Slope, it's often hard to get a table for brunch. We made a reservation for 12, and we were very pleased with the overall vibe. The free aguardiente shots woke us up and kept us going for the day. We sat in the heated outdoor patio that had parrots and colored Christmas lights dangling from the ceiling. The menu had so many different options too- Latin cuisine, regular breakfast options, gluten free and vegan options as well. I was stuck on the tofu scramble, but last minute decided to order the Daisy's Eggs upon server recommendation. My friend got the Migas de Arepa, the two boys both got Latin Breakfasts, and our other friend got a Cubano. I clearly made the wrong choice, as when the food arrived, I received two small dishes. The server had said it was small- but also chose the two most expensive options to 'recommend' to us. $15 for a side salad and two sunny side up eggs with cheese and chorizo... No Bueno! We had also ordered the dip sampler, and it came with guac, bean dip, and pico de gallo. It was all very good, very well made. The sunny side up eggs mixed with cheese and chorizo and avocado made me quite nauseous. I'm normally not used to eating runny eggs, and the mixture of those foods left me feeling uneasy. The other drawback was the price. Our total came out to over $115. They had automatically added in a gratuity of $12.90 to our bill of $83!!!! (We were paying in two groups). What a rip off. It would have been fine if not for that, but it was still pretty expensive. Not to mention a small margarita cost $10. Good to try, but I'm never coming back here with my friends.",3.0
The food here is pretty good! I'm not the biggest fan of the restaurant's atmosphere so I mainly order takeout. The service is friendly but incompetent to the point where I've stopped ordering from them. There's always something! For some reason a soup takes 40 min? Another time the hostess was too busy flirting with the bartender to notice me. They always seem to have a problem paying out because something is wrong with the credit card machine or they can't open the drawer to get change. Something about the bartender and their system? My boyfriend has also had similar issues with this independently.,3.0

It was crazy hot inside so we requested to be moved to the back room which was a lot cooler.My waiter was Juan and he was super patient and attentive. I was a tad bummed out I came at 12 and they were still doing the brunch menu so I didn't get to really order what I wanted. I just got the arroz con pollo and theirs was pretty good. The texture of the rice was different than I've had though, like when I eat al dente pasta. Flavor was good and portion size was good but it was a tad pricey in my opinion, lovely presentation of it though.I got a passion fruit mojito and that too was pretty good, my experience overall here was lovely but I'm going to have to give this a second try around dinner time to really get a fair judgement.",4.0
I just love this restaurant. It's like home to me. The staff is always friendly n courteous and always smiling. Shawn the manager was very welcoming and checked in to see if everything was good.

"Good food but service that ranged from clueless to straight-up intrusive. We arrived at 7:58pm with an 8pm reservation and waited in the cold doorway with others who had a 7:30 reservation, and had to tell 4 different people about it until we were finally seated at 8:10pm with no acknowledgement, let alone an apology. The back area is nice, and was warm in January. We skipped the free shot with Yelp checkinThe bandeja paisa was good, and the paella solid, but the experience took a turn when we finished our entrees and were not asked if we wanted dessert, but instead just handed 4 feedback cards and 3 pens with no explanation. The check was held hostage until we stacked them together (all blank) and we could finally pay. NYC Condoms near the oddly shaped 2-restroom area sent a very odd message, but at least there were chocolate mints next to them.",3.0
"This place was so great! The food was amazing and the interior was spectacular. I was on a date and our waitress was fantastic, quick, polite, and very personable. I also checked in for a free shot of aguardiente and our waitress hooked me up with a second free shot for my date! That was totally cool of her to do for us and I can definitely appreciate great customer service like that.I just really wished they had played typical Colombian music to really enhance the atmosphere of a Colombian restaurant. Another reason for not giving a 5-star rating was that they also don't serve pan de Bono except only at brunch on weekends. I have to admit that I was pretty disappointed to hear that since I've been to other Colombian restaurants that do serve it at dinner as well for an appetizer. Besides that, the restaurant was fantastic and my date was awesome. I just hope they can improve on the points I made so that my next experience back there will be even better! :)",4.0

This place honestly is My Husband & I Favorite New Spot. Perfect for the whole Family including Kids. It's known to get super busy during the weekend's. That's how good it is.

"Happy Hour drinks are $6 and they taste as if they cost a fraction of that price. EEK! Mojitos- I had two. Two was enough. Cheap liquor does not do well with my stomach so after perusing their menu chock full of overpriced entrees and appetizers, I settled on a plantain chip and bean dip app. Was it good? It was OK. Bean dip was sort of bland but I did appreciate the long, thick plantain chips. However, NOT worth $9 at all. Looking for a cool happy hour spot?

"Im definitely a fan of the food at Bogota. This place is packed and super high energy so you better try to make a reservation or you will be waiting forever! Drinks:I had the coconut mojito and the mango mojito. Both are delicious just extremelyyyy sugary wow! If you can handle the sweetness you will like it. I also took the free aguardiente shot offered with the check in. It tasted like liquorish. The drinks are stronger than you would think so take it easy. The sweetness masks the amount of rum and triple sec used. Apps:Ordered the shrimp and bean empanadas. The shrimp was great! The bean not so great but I didn't expect to like it, I actually wasn't the one who ordered it but decided to try it anyway.Entree:Based on the photos I had to get the Columbian platter and wow. Talk about a lot of food. Steak, sausage, egg, an arepa and rice & beans. This plate is NO joke but its really good. I came hungry so I was ready to tackle this bad boy. The steak was great, I love my steak medium and perfectly seasoned and I was happy. The chorizo (sausage) was good. Everything was great! I was very happy with the plate but I definitely could have  done without the egg. I eat eggs but it didn't compliment the platter to me.Overall a must try!!",4.0
"Great hangout spot. Very nice ambiance and decor. All dishes are tasty. They add little spark of fusion to their dishes. It needs Ajiaco, Tamales, mazamorra and changua to their menu. Servers are polite and they greet you with an aguardiente AYY OMMMMBEEEE!",5.0
"I've been to Bogota several times. It has become one of my favorite go to places on 5th avenue. The food and service have always been spectacular. After my first few visits on a weekend night I realized the importance of making a reservation if you want to be seated promptly.  As far as food goes, there is a wide variety of empanadas which are all incredibly tasty with the accompaniment of the dipping sauces. My favorite dishes here are the Pernil (even though the portion size is somewhat small) and the plantain crusted chicken. I've also had the chicken quesadilla which are a must. The churros are an excellent way to end any meal. Excellent extensive drink menu! My only real disappointment with this place is the outside seating in the back in the colder months. They really try to heat it nicely since the temperature is obviously much cooler than the actual interior of the restaurant. However no matter how much they heat it in the winter months I would suggest requesting to sit inside and not in the back area if you get old easily or don't want to wear a heavy jacket while you eat. The back area next to the glass wall/window where we sat on our last visit was very cold and made our meal a little less enjoyable.",4.0
The atmosphere was amazing. The managing staff as well as the food was nothing short of astounding. Have to say I'll be back here to come many times over. Colombian Rum Punch is to die for !!!! It's a must when I come back. Scan was an amazing manager and Edgar was the top notch waiter.,5.0
Place was on the freaking money! I am the type of eater that does not like to try new things or new places but thank gd i did with this place. Everything we tried to eat was good or better than good. the calamari were great with a unique kick to it. The corn was off the hook! better than Dos Caminos. The entries were good as well and large in portion.The drinks were good other than the mojitos possibly being a bit to sweet rather than a bit too strong. The unique flavors made up for that flaw.The only reason I did not give it a 5 star review is due to the long wait. My group was told 20 minutes over the phone when we were on the way. But waited another 40 on top of the time it took us to get there.Looking forward to coming back here without the wait.,4.0
We started with the strawberry mojitios and the street corn appetizer. Corn was full of flavor in the sauce and wrapped in cheese. For the main entree we got the pernil which was very juicy but did have some fat there and the plantain crusted chicken which was just a chicken cutlet with various bread crumbs nothing of the ordinary.The tres Leche cake was a little watery for my preference but it wasn't bad. Overall good restaurant.,4.0

"Food and drinks are always good. Not a single menu item has ever disappointed me. Rotisserie chicken is a guaranteed hit. If you're veg, the tofu tomatillo is grilled to perfection. Had street corn and the veg empañadas: both were exactly what I wanted. Service is very good as well. Waiters have always explained everything in detail and given great recommendations. Would always go here.",5.0
"This review is strictly for the drinks. The food is good but the happy hour is greater. I always get a red sangrita (sangria and frozen margarita). It has just enough sweetness and the consistency is smooth. The tequila kick balances the sangria well. My friend had a caprihana (Brazil's national drink), which was very good; my new addiction. All in all I would recommend this place.",4.0
"After visiting this place a number of times, I finally will take the time to write a well deserved review. It is indeed one of my favorite restaurants and I have had a number of things from the menu. I will admit, drinks for me make or break my dining experiences too, and with this place you get the whole package. Appetizers- Platanos Rellenos & Yuca Frita are my favorites. Main Courses-Pernil and Arroz Con Pollo are delicious. The paella was good as I had a taste. Id have to get the entire meal to experience it. The skirt steak was just ok to me. The salmon was very good along with the cilantro mash. Every meal tastes great when you add Maduros to it (sweet friend plantain) -And just recently I tried the Cubano Sandwhich which was Delicioso Drinks Drinks drinks-SANGRITA- everyone must try. Margarita and sangria together?! Yesssss ( white or red, doesn't matter.)Caipirinha is goodPiña coladas are great ( passion fruit and mango is quite tasty)Watermelon Mojito is delicious...Dessert :) yumXANGOS!!! Sent from God. (He did that) fried cheesecake... Who does that?? BLB does!Churros are great. Now as I said this is a fave place of mine so I have a lot more to try and will NEVER get tired.

"Excellent spot for drinks, can't have a caiprinha anywhere else!!  Favorite dish is tropical salmon, all things chicken are great however not a fan of the shrimp(blah)or red snapper(too dry).Great customer service but not a place you can walk in last minute and get a seat at least an hour wait, so make reservations in advance.",4.0
"The staff and ambiance were spot on. The food was oookay... But because the staff was sooo friendly and inviting I can't help but give them a higher score.

However, the food was okay. The Cubano was pretty basic and didn't wow me.. But didn't repulse me.. The menu also has a lot of items that they no longer offer. A bonus... You get a free shot of something with check in!In response to Mr. Farid, Thank you for your response and despite your attempt at saving face, unfortunately there were a number of items on the menu that were no longer served. If there is a next time, I will be sure to write them all down for you... Since something is getting lost in translation between staff, the kitchen and management. Thank you for your time.",3.0

Food taste was great. Service was horrid. The food came in time but me and my friends literally had spoons in the mouth and the waitress was pushing us out the door. It was crazy. I couldn't believe it. My parents owned a restaurant and not even on the busiest night did we push people out. There wasn't even a line of people. There was plenty empty tables this night March 16th. Bogota what happened to you!!!,3.0
"This place was just okay, service could have been better and I wish the menu was a little more expansive for vegetarians (where the veggie fajitas at?) but the empanadas were awesome!We came late Friday night around 10:30 so we were seated right away. My friends said during peak hours they can be really busy which I can understand cause the atmosphere had good vibes. They serve plantain chips and their homemade sauce instead of chips at the table. I thought the plantains tasted a little  stale and their homemade sauce was nothing special, considering they made a plug for it by saying if we like it that it's available for purchase. We then ordered the coconut shrimp, empanada platter, garlic shrimp and jerk salmon. Overall it was good, nothing special. My salmon tasted a little underdone and the coconut shrimp were so heavy. We got the garlic shrimp with mashed potatoes (which were green and actually really good) and spinach was good. My favorite empanada was the bean and cheese one. Not in any hurry to go back because there's so many restaurants in Brooklyn but this one is conveniently located to my friend so ill probably try it again.",3.0

The best margaritas I've had so far.For an appetizer I tried the cheese bread as well as the shrimp empanadas. They are small portions so you may want to consider getting an entree dish.

"Do you guys ever have trouble writing reviews for places you really really like?  Figuring the words you write won't do the place justice? I've been to Bogata at least four or five times now and I still haven't written a review about it.  I really have no idea what's stopped me.  Bogata is FANTASTIC!  One of my favorite restaurants in the city.  It's one of those places we find ourselves at when a special occasion rolls around... birthdays, anniversaries, etc.   It has an amazing vibe, awesome staff, delicious food and some of the best margaritas around.--------------Lets talk about those margaritas shall we... the frozen are my favorite...specifically the mango and passion fruit flavors.  Absolutely perfect combination of ingredients making them sweet but not overly and just the right amount of tequila for that kick that have me ordering another, and another... Of course I do eat when I visit Bogata....The Empanadas for one are incredible.  If you're thinking about ordering I recommend the sampler ($15) and cutting them in half to share.  My favorites: - Shredded Chicken - great spice!  Dip in any of the sauces the empanadas come with, they all taste great with the spicy chicken. - Goat Cheese - combo of creamy goat cheese and queso blanco is soooo rich and soooo delish.  Try it in the mango bbq sauce! - Guava - puree & cream cheese - who has time for churro's* and flan?  Just bring me a round of these little guys.  The sweet fruityness of the guava mixed with the richness of the cream cheese is soooooo good.I'm also a big fan of the following: Chipotle Salad with Plantain Crusted Chicken ($16) - it always surprised me when I go to a restaurant and have a reallllly great salad.  It's lettuce, ya know?  But the combination of avocado, feta cheese, diced egg, red onion, tortilla strips is great.  Add the plantain crusted chicken, which is delish all on its own, and drizzle on some chipotle dressing and you have a killer salad.   The chicken especially is something special.  The plantains give it this incredible crunch.Pernil ($16) - Ahh the pernil.  Slow roasted pulled pork that's been marinated in Colombian beer.  I won't lie to y'all - the pork is a little salty.  But I suggest you ask for a side of their mango bbq, the sweet tanginess helps cut the saltiness.  A side of the Tropical Slaw also helps cut the salt.  The cabbage + slices of mango tossed in vinaigrette is just really good and works so well with the pork and bbq sauce. Another must try if its available is their mashed plantains.  I've never been a big fan of plantains, unless they were in chip form, but this mashed version was wonderful.  I wish they'd put it on the menu permanently.--------------As mentioned briefly above the atmosphere is just great here... the place is so inviting, and so lively!  I love the bright and colorful walls, the twinkle lights and the enclosed patio in the back.  The staff has always been great to us too...I don't have a single complaint about this place. Oo and bonus- I found out recently that they added $3 empanadas to their happy hour menu.  Yes!  Looks like I won't have to wait until the next birthday to return for another awesome meal at Bogata. --------------*In all seriousness - the Churros are really good too.  You get four sticks and dips for $6 and they're totally worth it.",5.0

"This place is awesome!!! I've passed by so many times in the past two years, but never thought to check it out. Boy, am I glad I did! First of all, get the empanadas. Trust me on this. They're made with cornmeal and when I read that, I didn't think I'd like it, bu they are WONDERFUL!!! They have a nice little crunch and the chicken ones are filled with deliciously seasoned White meat. Everything we ordered was delicious and well-seasoned. No dry rice and beans and the staff was very nice. Check this place out!",5.0
"I can't help but to be a repeat customer at Bogota Bistro with my PIC, Yanick. Undoubtedly, ordering the Bandeja Paisa, a Columbian staple, is a must here. It is a mixture of rice, beans, steak, red cabbage, chicharron, avocado and fried eggs. You can't beat it! My go to drink is the sangrita, a mixture of a frozen sangria and margarita.",5.0
"If you want a colorful, warm, vibrant place that inundates you with Latin Flavor, you win at Bogota Bistro. I have a longstanding Thursday night date with my friend Marcus here and our customer loyalty has not gone unnoticed by the management.            ( Shout out to Shawn, a friendly, observant and professional manager!) I have loved everything I have ordered here and that includes patatcons, empanadas, arepas, chicken tortilla soup and coconut flan. However, Marcus and I are predictable. We always order a Bandeja Paisa. Now I might have a coconut mojito or glass of Chardonnay and Marcus may change it up and occasionally deviate from his Sangrita, but one thing we agree on is the Bandeja Paisa. This traditional Columbian dish is an explosion of flavors from the sweet maduro, to the savory skirt steak, to the cool melting of avocado in your mouth. I highly recommend for a date, a special occasion or just the foodie friends that like to get together on a Thursday",5.0
"Friendly service, affordable drinks ($30 large mimosa pitchers!) and food, and I love that they take reservations. Perfect for people with dietary restrictions because the menu has vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free options clearly stated.Thought it was kind of strange that a ""bottomless drink brunch"" was advertised on the menu but it's for a different restaurant.Will definitely return for brunch and look forward to trying lunch/dinner!",4.0
"My whole life has been changed! By far one of the beat restaurants I've been to in a while. My friends and I came here on a Thursday evening with a last minute reservation. The smell was enticing!I ordered the plantanos renellos (seasoned chicken wrapped in plantains) to begin after seeing a bunch of people posting pictures of it on yelp. I wish they served that dish in a larger size. The chipotle sauce served with the dish was amazing. Even my friends who have been here plenty of times were satisfied with the dish.My main meal was one of their specials: beef short ribs in a red wine sauce with mushrooms and served with a side of white chedder mash potatoes. The short ribs were tender , not overly salty, and the mushrooms with garlic added a beautiful touch. One of my friends order her usual dish: fish tacos. She offered a taste to me and my mind was blown away. I've never had a fish taco that tasted as great as theirs. My other friend ordered a Columbian sampler that seemed to taste just amazing as it look.I love their customer service. Very attentive and welcoming. I was beyond impressed. The place is a little small, so I would suggest to make reservations especially on a night where it would be busy. I will definitely be a returning customer!",5.0

"This place is awesome!!! I've passed by so many times in the past two years, but never thought to check it out. Boy, am I glad I did! First of all, get the empanadas. Trust me on this. They're made with cornmeal and when I read that, I didn't think I'd like it, bu they are WONDERFUL!!! They have a nice little crunch and the chicken ones are filled with deliciously seasoned White meat. Everything we ordered was delicious and well-seasoned. No dry rice and beans and the staff was very nice. Check this place out!",5.0
"I can't help but to be a repeat customer at Bogota Bistro with my PIC, Yanick. Undoubtedly, ordering the Bandeja Paisa, a Columbian staple, is a must here. It is a mixture of rice, beans, steak, red cabbage, chicharron, avocado and fried eggs. You can't beat it! My go to drink is the sangrita, a mixture of a frozen sangria and margarita.",5.0
"If you want a colorful, warm, vibrant place that inundates you with Latin Flavor, you win at Bogota Bistro. I have a longstanding Thursday night date with my friend Marcus here and our customer loyalty has not gone unnoticed by the management.            ( Shout out to Shawn, a friendly, observant and professional manager!) I have loved everything I have ordered here and that includes patatcons, empanadas, arepas, chicken tortilla soup and coconut flan. However, Marcus and I are predictable. We always order a Bandeja Paisa. Now I might have a coconut mojito or glass of Chardonnay and Marcus may change it up and occasionally deviate from his Sangrita, but one thing we agree on is the Bandeja Paisa. This traditional Columbian dish is an explosion of flavors from the sweet maduro, to the savory skirt steak, to the cool melting of avocado in your mouth. I highly recommend for a date, a special occasion or just the foodie friends that like to get together on a Thursday",5.0
"Friendly service, affordable drinks ($30 large mimosa pitchers!) and food, and I love that they take reservations. Perfect for people with dietary restrictions because the menu has vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free options clearly stated.Thought it was kind of strange that a ""bottomless drink brunch"" was advertised on the menu but it's for a different restaurant.Will definitely return for brunch and look forward to trying lunch/dinner!",4.0
"My whole life has been changed! By far one of the beat restaurants I've been to in a while. My friends and I came here on a Thursday evening with a last minute reservation. The smell was enticing!I ordered the plantanos renellos (seasoned chicken wrapped in plantains) to begin after seeing a bunch of people posting pictures of it on yelp. I wish they served that dish in a larger size. The chipotle sauce served with the dish was amazing. Even my friends who have been here plenty of times were satisfied with the dish.My main meal was one of their specials: beef short ribs in a red wine sauce with mushrooms and served with a side of white chedder mash potatoes. The short ribs were tender , not overly salty, and the mushrooms with garlic added a beautiful touch. One of my friends order her usual dish: fish tacos. She offered a taste to me and my mind was blown away. I've never had a fish taco that tasted as great as theirs. My other friend ordered a Columbian sampler that seemed to taste just amazing as it look.I love their customer service. Very attentive and welcoming. I was beyond impressed. The place is a little small, so I would suggest to make reservations especially on a night where it would be busy. I will definitely be a returning customer!",5.0
"Absolutely delicious! The appetizers are fresh, the drinks are perfectly mixed, and the food hits the palate. You will not be disappointed.",4.0
I went on Independence Day. The restaurant is not a big one but it's decent size. Me and my friend had some drinks and appetizer. I have the passion fruit frozen mojito and the frozen sangria. Both my drinks were superb. The fried cheesecake is so bomb. The waiter was nice and very helpful in regards to which drinks were good as well as the food.I'll be back.,4.0
"We had made a reservation for 8 on a Friday and arrived at 8:02. There was still a back log of people with 7:30 reservations eating to be seated. So at around 8:20 we finally got a table. If it's a Friday night, go with a bigger party. They definitely get priority. We got a small table up against a main thoroughfare and kept getting bumped by servers and patrons. We had a server that must've been new and didn't know items on the menu and poured a beer roughly into flatness. The food was all very average. I've never seen maduros cooked into such charred obscurity - I don't know, maybe that's the Colombian style. Overall quite an underwhelming experience. Maybe during the week it's much more charming. Don't try and go for an intimate date on a Friday night.",3.0
"I normally love this place... For dinner. I came here plenty of times and enjoyed everything. Today I made the mistake of coming for brunch and was extremely disappointed. The brunch menu is so so and when I requested to make one of my favorite appetizers at 3pm just a few hours before ""dinner"" time I was denied. The food I ordered was mediocre and I definitely will not be returning unless it's after they decide ""lunch"" is over. They should definitely be more accommodating to their customers.",3.0

"When a native Colombian tells you where they go to get good Colombian in NYC, you go. When it happens to be in the neighborhood where you live, you go that night. I took 5 friends with me this past weekend and we had a great time. While not my primary concern when judging a restaurant, the service was great. Everybody was happy!

Our waitress was Johanna and she was cute as a button and very attentive.So to run down the food as an appetizer I got the empanada sampler chicken beef. Entre was the skirt steak yellow rice and black beans maduros. For drinks I started off with a caipirinha, which was very strong and very good!! My second drink was the passion fruit margarita which was also very good!! Johanna was soo smitten with me and my family that she gave us complimentary shots of Colombian rum of which I don't remember the name, but it was smooth going down and didn't leave me with any after effects. So all in all, I don't think I could give this place enough kudos and will be definitely coming back!!",5.0

"If you like Colombian food avoid this place and go to Queens. The bandeja paisa was not up to par in my opinion. I was highly disappointed with the flavor of the steak and the beans as well. French toast was actually pretty good and it was cheap, but I wouldn't come back here.",2.0

I enjoyed the goat cheese empanadas. I want to try their guava empanada next! There were about 4 tables in the whole dining area and I had to wait 15 minutes before I received some service. Im not the type to wave my hand to get a servers attention but that didn't work either. Either no one sees me waving or theyre ignoring me.  A few minutes after that, I waved down this guy and asked for our server but he just helped us get our bill.

I would give this place 10 stars if I could! Firstly I made reservations in advance because I heard this place gets busy and boy I was right! Came here for a date night with my friend. We're both fans of Latin food and were eager to try something new! Made reservations for 8pm. We got there at 8pm and the place was packed! We waited about 7 mins tops for our table! The decor is fabulous and very homey! The perfect lightening and the music was just right. They do have a full bar and from the outside it looks small but let me reassure you its hella big inside!!! Plus they have a backyard where you can enjoy your dinner as well! We were seated all the way in the back at first it looked congested but once you're sat down it's fairly comfortable. Our waiter came to us right away and he was very knowledgable about the food and drinks and gave us a play by play on what to order (we're first timers). He gave us all the time we needed! I wish I got his name! :( We ordered jerk chicken tacos and steak and potato empanadas for start. Then I ordered Arroz con pollo and my friend order Pernil it's pulled pork and a side of cilantro mash potatoes! The drinks were superb!!!!!! I had a watermelon mojito and my friend ordered they're signature drinks (I wish I could remember the name!) but it was delicious non the less. We also decided to order banana pudding and it was outstanding! Caramel on the bottom and a big piece of banana pudding swimming in it! Of course with a dollop of vanilla ice cream... Yes! I LOVE THIS PLACE! I'm so happy I came here! They definitely made our night special! Big shout out to Sean I think he's the manager there. He was very friendly and even made sure our food was up to part! Such good workers there who know their stuff! Amazing !!!!,5.0
"My friend came here to celebrate her birthday and we had a party of 10. My pet peeve for that night was the seating. We were placed at a table where one side is pressed up against the walls. The whole row needed to get up, when one person needed to use the bathroom; unconventional and a disappointment.As for food, I ordered sangria and  1/2 a garlic rotisserie chicken. For the price, the sangria was garbage and the chicken was a steal. It was delicious and the sides made the dish a bargain. Will be coming here again, however less likely in a large group; seating sucks.",4.0
I love this spot! The staff was so friendly from reservation call (with darling Lola!) to nightcap on the way out. The manager John (Sean?) even visited our table to let us know about their Yelp promotion so we could get free aguardiente! Highlights: veggie empanada and the caipirinha!,5.0
"The first time I went here, after seeing Adam W's steady stream of Instagram posts, I was quite happy. We got a seat pretty quickly, food was great, and the staff juggled a giant party and a bunch of tables.The second time seemed to maybe be on a day they were short staffed. It was pretty empty, but everything took forever. There was a long lag where no food was coming out of the kitchen.

"If you're looking for amazing fish tacos, look no further. I've searched highs and lows, far and wide throughout New York City and by far Bogota has the best fish tacos. If you're not into fish tacos, that's okay because their garlic shrimp with a side of maduros and French fries are pretty kick ass too. Everywhere I go I would order Hennessy on the rocks but here at Bogota, my favorite drink is the coconut mojito. They're well made and strong. The staff at Bogota are always so friendly, it's nothing but good vibes once you walk through the door. This place is my home away from home.

Love love love this neighborhood restaurant!   The food is nice and fresh and such a variety is offered!!!!!   Have the corn.  Have the mojitos (love the coconut ones).   Have the breakfast food.  Have the lunch food.  Have the dinner food and you won't be disappointed!!!!   You want to have rich food at reasonable prices!?!?  Bogota is the place to go!!!!,5.0

"Eat here.Maybe I should say more... but that's the essence of it.The food here is great. I don't eat meat, and there's plenty of stuff on the menu for me (thoughtfully marked with a ""v"" or ""vg""). But I understand it's not all about me, and everybody has something they'll like here, and everyone is happy with the food.The appetizer menu is excellent, and realistically you could sit at the bar and have several of these and be satisfied. The street corn is fantastic, and their empanadas are so good that you may just want to order the sample (4 of them) and see what happens. The dip sampler comes with guacamole, black bean dip, and pico de gallo, along with plaintain chips and corn chips. You get the idea - lots of stuff is great on the appetizer menu.Main plates are also good. I was a bit underwhelmed by the salmon, but the coconut shrimp were great. Portions are substantial.The drink menu is just as much fun as the food menu. Jalapeno margaritas are very good. There are also a number of South American bottled beers to try (Quimes is my fav). The atmosphere is fun and lively, although it's a bit bright and a drop tight in terms of room. The staff is always excellent - from host/ess to wait staff and bartender.

"This place was packed when I arrived. It was Friday night and everyone was looking for a reason to share happy hour drinks and food with friends I guess. The liveliness was certainly an attraction factor. I ordered arrepas and margaritas while hanging with 2 friends. The food and drinks were Ok, not amazing, but worth the taste. Whenever a place is packed, I give the service staff some slack- they deserve it. Unfortunately waiting 30 minutes for their signature piña colada and still being told it'll be a few more minutes seems a bit unreasonable. Trying to get the check was a nightmare and the bill was chock full of mistakes. There are lots of alternative options on 5th ave so I may skip this place if given the option again.",3.0
Always make a reservation if you want to make sure to be seated before waiting for an hour and a half!! It gets very busy!! The food and drinks were so good and tasty!! I'm so happy I was able to enjoy the food and the restaurant!! My waitress Denise was super sweet and enjoyed her great energy and customer service!! They also have a back room which you can have a group event!! Its a medium size so make reservation!! The fish taco was super good and my drinks!!,4.0
I came here a few times for dinner and dessert and loved everything I got-- specifically the tres leches cake and the arepas. My sisters knew how much I loved the tres leches cake (and I've tried a lot of tres leches cakes) so they got me a full cake here for my 21st birthday! I'm excited to come back for more tres leches and arepas! Yum!,5.0
"I love this place so much. I've been to bogota twice, once for dinner on NYE and once for brunch. Both times were GREAT experiences. The place is adorable. The decorations are quirky and the waiters/waitresses are awesome. The New Years Eve menu was fixed, so I am not sure this is the normal every day dinner menu. That night I drank a few delicious caipirinhas and had pastelon for dinner, a sweet plantain lasagna and IT WAS AWESOME. However, I ate so much I was so full all night and still full the next morning. I was in love. I went to their brunch a few weeks ago and it was equally as great. I had a yummy mango mimosa and the Dominican breakfast. The mangu was on point and so was the chorizo. I felt like I was transported back to Santo Domingo. My boyfriend had Migas de Arepa scrambled eggs which included arepas, chorizo, tostones, and guac. That was also delicious and a lot more fresh tasting than my plate if that's what you're more in the mood for. Honestly, any plate will probably cure that hangover you're walking in with.

We brought our 4-month-old and were quickly seated to an area where we were comfortable and out baby wasn't constantly bumped into.

The portions are huge and the waiters very attentive. We always save room for dessert and pleasantly satisfied with the variety. I had my first date and anniversary dinner here so I always come with high expectations and Bogota is just the place to satisfy these needs.",5.0

"Friendly staff. Came here on a cold day looking for lunch.Waiter was very friendly (Juan). The place is surprisingly large inside. I hear they are opening a 2nd location near by.My first time here. Got some appetizers- Empanada samplers. You get a choice of 4 (steak, chicken, veggie, beans w/cheese....no pork? ) We got 2 chicken..2 steak. The steak was clear winner. Drinks- Mojito, Jalapeno margarita and flavored margarita. I had the Jalapeño drink...wasn't crazy about it. No zang. Flat on the alcohol and flavor content. Tasted water down. So I didn't order any other drinks due to low expectations.Meal- Ropa Vieja, Pernil and this other platter special.I have had great Ropa Vieja many places before, I was not crazy about the one here. My friend had the Pernil which I preferred. And she preferred my Ropa Vieja. So I can chuck this up to taste preferences.I got side of rice and beans with sauteed spinach.  Not to crazy about the spinach. Side of plantain= can't go wrong with plantains in my book.Dessert was the sampler dish. I am not fan of sweets. If you are then you will surely find something on the platter to tickle your sweet tooth. I liked the churro & I typically don't care for them at other restaurants.",3.0

"I've been here twice and I honestly cannot wait to go back. If you want an upgrade from pollo Mario or any amazing Colombian restaurant, you can try a little pricier version of their bandeja paisa. Or you can try something completely new like their chipotle corn crusted salmon with Maduros and Steamed kale on the side. My tastebuds thanked me and gave me an extra pat on the back when I paired it with some Chilean Pinot. My boyfriend had the grilled chuleta and honestly I never (grandma's included - sorry, abuela) had a better tasting chuleta in my life. The taste was amazing unique and fresh. Their drinks are also something to try. I had a passion fruit margarita, but they also serve caipirinhas as well.",4.0

"I came here after a friend told me how much she loves this place and their mojiots. Now I love a good mojito so I wasted no time giving it a try. I made a reservation, because I read some Yelp reviews saying that it gets packed on the weekends (I went on a Friday night). I got there a little before the person I was having dinner with, and they still seated me and let me wait for him, which was nice. The plantain chips with dip that they give to each table are pretty good.The first drink I had was a mango mojito. Now I love a good mango mojito, and I feel like you can't really go wrong with it. However, I'm the kind of girl that likes to taste my liquor. it definitely could've been a lot stronger. It was tasty, but it tasted like juice. Tasty juice.I ordered the garlic shrimp with yellow rice and sweet plantains. The rice and shrimp were both disappointingly bland and barely even warm. My date's food however, was steaming hot. I don't know what was up with that (he had the paella). The plantains were the best thing about my meal, and they weren't nearly as crispy as I like them.After my meal, I ordered the sangrita, with high hopes that it would be better than my first drink. It was =). Very delicious, and strong enough to give me a little buzz. The sangrita was the highlight of my meal.I probably wouldn't go back to Bogota on my own, but if somebody invited me I'd go and try something else on the menu because the service and atmosphere were good",2.0
"came in last night for dinner after being at the Barclays Center. had the free aguardiente shot with check-in, that was okay.my drink was a mango pina colada, that was alright as well. As for the food, the beef empenada was just like a smaller jamaican beef patty with a hard crust. The plantains with cheese/queso was pretty good and I enjoyed the complementary plantain chips. My entree was the Bistec Enceballo(skirt steak with onions and two sides(coconut rice and gallo pinto). This was nothing to boast about as the steak was rather small and salty. Gallo Pinto was plausible and the coconut rice is something good if you haven't tried SE-Asian coconut rice/plates.Service is great though and helpful.The final was a total in the mid-50's.

"Yummy! I came here first with a friend, and then again a few months ago with my family. The staff is so nice, friendly, and inviting. I've sat at the bar and sat for regular seating when I came with the familia. Both times were pretty enjoyable.The food here is very Colombian and very delicious! They have a lot of variety on their menu which is nice because I love having a lot of options. I highly recommend the chicken or shrimp empanadas. They are so good and serve as a great appetizer. My favorite drink over there is the frozen Sangrita, which is a mix of a margarita and sangria. Really delicious! The entrees are tasty and well cooked and range from chicken, rice and beans and plantains to salad and fish. My only negative is that this place can get pretty crowded and a bit congested. Depending on where you're sitting you may have to navigate your way around a maze to get to the bathroom. This location is easy to find but if you plan on driving give yourself an extra 15 to 30 minutes trying to find parking as it is not easy around this area Park slope.

Some of the best food in the neighborhood. Chicken quesadilla sounds so basic and blah until you go here. Stuffed full of goodness. The guac is fresh and served with some fried plantains - yum!! Black bean dip is equally as amazing. Fresh pico de gallo. You should just get all three as part of the dip sampler. If you're not into plantains (which you should be) you do get tortilla chips served as well. But the plantains are crispy and thin and delish. Lots of good drinks - I had a jalapeño margarita that had the right kind of kick. The one down side? Service was lackluster at best. Just a heads up. I might suggest a reservation because it gets crowded. You can sit at the bar if you'd rather. They also have a covered patio if you'd rather. Amazing food. Cool atmosphere.,4.0

The special drinks they craft are good but nothing to drool over. The 5-star here really goes out to the staff, they are friendly and really on their game, props to the management for maintaining a great team. When you sit for dinner you get some plantain chips and a very tasty salsa to go with to snack on, but be sure to not fill up on it and order some empanadas as an appetizer as well.",5.0
"This is a lively, hip spot that serves up some delicious Latin food. I went here on a Friday night and the place was very lively with a diverse crowd.

"This is my 3rd time @bogota bistro. The food is always good. The sweet plantains with cheese is delish and I've had the garlic shrimp a couple of times also a good choice. My review this time is for the service. I came in on Valentine's Day because I had purchased last minute tickets on stubhub to see a concert at the Barclays. Since it was a last minute purchase I didn't notice that the tickets had to be printed at home and I was not at home. When we arrived at Bogota I asked the hostess if she would be able do me a favor and print the tickets for me, she said she would ask the manager. Shawn came to our table, I explained my situation to Shawn and he was able to accommodate us. I was surprised that on such a busy day he took a little time to help us and went beyond what's required. Thank you Shawn you are the best.",5.0

The atmosphere is really fun and the food is very flavorful, the unique spices they season the dishes with makes everything seem like a treat. The special drinks they craft are good but nothing to drool over. The 5-star here really goes out to the staff, they are friendly and really on their game, props to the management for maintaining a great team. When you sit for dinner you get some plantain chips and a very tasty salsa to go with to snack on, but be sure to not fill up on it and order some empanadas as an appetizer as well.",5.0
"This is a lively, hip spot that serves up some delicious Latin food. I went here on a Friday night and the place was very lively with a diverse crowd. I forgot what I ordered but I do remember it being good. I do remember getting an imported Colombian beer that was good also. I'd absolutely recommend it for a night out of drinking and food. It is very loud so it's not your type of place if that bothers you.",4.0
"This is my 3rd time @bogota bistro. The food is always good. The sweet plantains with cheese is delish and I've had the garlic shrimp a couple of times also a good choice. My review this time is for the service. I came in on Valentine's Day because I had purchased last minute tickets on stubhub to see a concert at the Barclays. Since it was a last minute purchase I didn't notice that the tickets had to be printed at home and I was not at home. When we arrived at Bogota I asked the hostess if she would be able do me a favor and print the tickets for me, she said she would ask the manager. Shawn came to our table, I explained my situation to Shawn and he was able to accommodate us. I was surprised that on such a busy day he took a little time to help us and went beyond what's required. Thank you Shawn you are the best.",5.0
"Came here for the first time and it was just delicious. Was here for brunch due to a friend that recommended the place. Drinks are really good and strong. I had a Smokin' chipotle pineapple margarita (spicy). Never had a drink this good. It's a must try. The food had really good flavors, good portion also their arepas are delicious. Since we came in a small group we had various arepas and all were delicious.They also have an outdoor area that during the winter is heated so it feels like you are indoors. I will be coming back for more.",5.0

"Great Cuban food. Our waiter was very friendly. Asked for our feedback on the food and recommended great things. The food was delicious so were the drinks. I ordered their paella and it had tons of seafood wish it was a little spicer, but still very good. My bf ordered their pulled pork and it melted in your mouth. We also had coconut flan, it was delicious it reminded me a little of coconut cheese cake.",5.0
"I really, really, really like this place. It's a shame that it's so far away from me. Or, perhaps it's a very good thing that this place is so far away from me because I would surely gain a gazillion pounds from partaking in their delicious offerings on a regular basis.I came here about a month or so ago for a friend's birthday dinner. The place was super packed, so reservations are highly recommended. Once seated, I managed to narrow down my choice to their tofu tomatillo, which was absolutely delicious. We also all shared some of their empanadas, which were quite good and different from the empanadas I grew up with. I will say that their guava empanadas were super tasty as well. Very good drinks and desserts as well. The only reason I'm not giving this a full 5 stars was because the service was kind of sluggish.Would absolutely recommend any and all to check this place out. I'd personally love to go back here one day soon.",4.0
"Came here Saturday night after Christmas holidays and found the place to be filled with people, but not packed. We were able to get a table for 2 easily. The decor is festive and filled with images of different places of Latin America.  Service was great: waiters are floating around and were quick to answer or assist us. We ordered their specials of lobster quesadilla and duck empanada, as well as the Columbian Platter with Columbia chorizo.  We were not fans of the lobster quesadilla or the duck empanada - possibly because the flavors were more experimental than we were expecting. However, the Columbia Platter was delicious! The meats were great and topped with rice, fried egg, and plantains. There's a perfectly cooked med-rare steak, crispy pork and we added an extra Columbia chorizo which was perfectly cooked. So, so good! Will definitely come back for that.",4.0

"They get four stars because they provide gluten free latino comfort food in a way that most places can't - they have dedicated fryers and make gluten free empanadas (more like alcapurrias, but tasty), tostones, maduros, etc.  Empanadas are almost always made of wheat, so this is a treat.  Tostones and maduros are almost always fried in the same fryers as other wheat/gluten items, so celiacs shouldn't eat them out due to contamination.   The idea that celiacs can have fried latino food (empanadas, cuchifrito type stuff) in a restaurant is almost unheard of - but they do it.

My friend left the ordering to me so I got what I usually like from here; The guacamole w/ crabmeat and pomegranate - this use to be only on their specials section but it's now an addition to their appetizer! Plenty of crab meat and great sweet tart from the pomegranate, love this guac! Wish they still served it with the fried plaintain chips though.Empanada sampler - guava, goat cheese, shrimp, and beef. THE GUAVA WAS THE BEST ONE, SOO GOOD!! Next time I'll only get the guava. Goat cheese is really popular among everyone but to us, it was just alright.Stuffed sweet plaintains w/ chicken - sweet&salty, I always recommend this appetizer. Good sauce to it as well!Colombian platter to share - you get everything on this dish that you can't go wrong with; a skirt steak; pork belly; eggs; chorizo; avocado, and rice w/ beans. Soo much food in one yummy Spanish platter. However, the pork skin is always too hard to chew!!I remember the catfish is another really yummy entree and the garlic rotisserie were pretty good too! Just DON'T get the arroz con pollo (shredded chicken one)...The pricing on these plates are decent. We each paid about 40ish but that's because we ordered a lot for just two people. COME DURING HAPPY HOUR!! Cheap great drinks and the empanadas are half off as well.Wish I remembered my waitress name, but she was extremely nice, patient, and very understanding with us especially since we came 15 minutes before the kitchen was closing and felt like we were pretty annoying with all of our requests.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACEThe food is absolutely amazing.Its fresh and the wait time does reflect this if you go during a busy time which would be weekend nights. But make a reservation. SO WORTH IT. You will not wait and you will have a great meal. Its not the cheapest meal but you definitely het what you pay for. You get a great quality meal at a good price and the portions are generous. Let me be clear- I would not normally choose a Colombian restaurant for a night out. So glad I broke my routine.And the staff is amazing. They do their jobs well and with a great attitude. Super friendly.  Friendly place for the gluten-free. Looks like I have a new go-to spot. Keep up the good work Bogota.,5.0
"I have been here a total of 2 times. In 2014 and 2015. I came last year during the summer and was seated immediately. I loved the plantain chips and dipping sauce which was tottaly different than you ajo molido you get in other places. We ordered our food and it arrived pretty quickly. However, I wasnt sold on the food itself. The rice was salty, more than my liking  atleast. I ordered the arroz con pollo, and it was ok. I wouldnt say it was great, but it wasnt disappointing either which in turn is good. My GF and her sister had the skirt steak with yuca fries. The steak portion was rather small but it was absolutely delicious OMG, I wish I would have ordered it instead of the traditional arroz con pollo. The only hassle was the end since we had to wait a pretty long time to get our check and an equal amount of time to pay it and then receive our change. Second time I came was alone and had the same dish (gluten for punishment i guess) but this time it wasnt as salty. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Be prepared to wait if you come for dinner from thursday through the weekend though, it does get crowded, and with large crowds come slow service at times, so please be patient with the staff and be respectful of them, one thing I hate is when people go eat somewhere and treat the servers like crap.That was a side note. Enjoy and dont take our word for it, sometimes you just gotta try places regardless of reviews.",3.0

Jalapeño guava margaritas are good! They're testing a new menu for a new restaurant so I had this lasagna of sorts made out of plantains, rope vieja, and quest blanco. The ropa vieja was flavorful. The salad that came with it had little pomegranate seeds and slivers of mango which were a nice surprise. Their skirt steak is good as well. I also enjoyed a sampling of coconut shrimp. The tres leches was the best I've had in a while.The food and ambiance are where it's at here.. If i used this to judge the service I'd probably take off a star. My server was slightly rude especially when catering to such a loud group and made it seem like it was our fault we didn't fit into the seating arrangements they stuffed us into. The chairs are uncomfortable patio furniture and doesn't move easily. I did like the small touch by the restrooms. One bowl of mints. The other of free NYC condoms.I'd say for a small dinner party or for drinkage this place would be delightful and the staff would also.",4.0

I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACEThe food is absolutely amazing.Its fresh and the wait time does reflect this if you go during a busy time which would be weekend nights. But make a reservation. SO WORTH IT. You will not wait and you will have a great meal. Its not the cheapest meal but you definitely het what you pay for. You get a great quality meal at a good price and the portions are generous. Let me be clear- I would not normally choose a Colombian restaurant for a night out. So glad I broke my routine.And the staff is amazing. They do their jobs well and with a great attitude. Super friendly.  Friendly place for the gluten-free. Looks like I have a new go-to spot. Keep up the good work Bogota.,5.0
"I have been here a total of 2 times. In 2014 and 2015. I came last year during the summer and was seated immediately. I loved the plantain chips and dipping sauce which was tottaly different than you ajo molido you get in other places. We ordered our food and it arrived pretty quickly. However, I wasnt sold on the food itself. The rice was salty, more than my liking  atleast. I ordered the arroz con pollo, and it was ok. I wouldnt say it was great, but it wasnt disappointing either which in turn is good. My GF and her sister had the skirt steak with yuca fries. The steak portion was rather small but it was absolutely delicious OMG, I wish I would have ordered it instead of the traditional arroz con pollo. The only hassle was the end since we had to wait a pretty long time to get our check and an equal amount of time to pay it and then receive our change. Second time I came was alone and had the same dish (gluten for punishment i guess) but this time it wasnt as salty. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Be prepared to wait if you come for dinner from thursday through the weekend though, it does get crowded, and with large crowds come slow service at times, so please be patient with the staff and be respectful of them, one thing I hate is when people go eat somewhere and treat the servers like crap.That was a side note. Enjoy and dont take our word for it, sometimes you just gotta try places regardless of reviews.",3.0

"I've always loved this place and my husband and I have been regulars for nearly the 10 years that they've been open. Unfortunately, it looks like we've finally been priced out. Went today for Sunday brunch as we tend to do nearly every week we're in town and learned that they have gotten rid of their happy hour prices. We've adjusted to the rise in food cost over the years but will now have to save meals at Bogota for special occasions. Appetizers, meals and drinks cost us over $140 for brunch...worth it for Father's Day but we'll have to go elsewhere for a regular Sunday. In terms of food, I had the chipotle salad with salmon and it was great today. Have definitely ordered this in the past where the salmon was either a) a very small portion or b) raw in the middle so it was nice that it was cooked perfectly. Salad was sparsely dressed so asked for a little extra dressing which the waitress quickly got. My husband ordered the steak and eggs which seemed to be great. Salad wasn't dressed though so he didn't really eat that. Drinks are always tasty just have gotten pretty darn expensive. It was a particularly sticky/humid day today and it wasn't much relief inside the restaurant.  Overall it was pretty warm, though I did hear the hostess ask someone to turn up the AC for the front lobby.  Would have loved for it to be cooler throughout the restaurant as well.",4.0

"I live in the neighborhood and have heard many great things about Bogota for years but have never made it in myself, now I see what the hype was about! I reserved a table for 2 earlier in the day with OpenTable so my friend and I didn't even wait two minutes to be seated. We received a table for 2 in a nice corner. The whole ambience is romantic but lively and festive at the same time as they played a mixture of Spanish music. It makes you want to dance in your seat (which I did after my first Pina Colada.) We ordered multiple Pina Coladas which were delicious. We had Platanos Rellenos for appetizers which were stuffed with chicken, and the sauce was nice. Main course for me was the Pernil  with sides of rice and beans a spinach with garlic. The pork was tender and well cooked and seasoned and the sides were very good. My friend had the Arroz con pollo and she loved it. But the best part of the meal was the deep fried cheesecake with ice cream that we shared at the end! I've never eaten something so amazing in my life. Forget about any type of diet or calories, just reward yourself with this treat. This fried cheesecake is so good I'm convinced we could end wars with it! Anyway we had a great night, great food, great drinks,and topped it off with a war ending desert.

I have not been here but ordered over seamless. The food is very tasty. I loved the Maduros for appetizer! The queso was perfect and the brown sugar added to the taste.

Finally we ordered 4 empanadas : domino,  steak, chicken, and beef; platanos wrapped chicken, and arepitas which were on special. I got a free shot of aguardienta,  which tastes like licorice and had 5-6 cocktails between us  (my friend had 2 margaritas).

"Bogota is one of my favorite spots in Brooklyn.  I love a fine bourbon neat and generally don't drink much rum, but their coconut caipirinha is my favorite drink on the planet. For me, two is the minimum per trip, and to be honest the maximum if I plan to drive. They're strong and delicious and since trying I haven't felt the need to order anything else. The menu features dishes across the Latin spectrum. While you'll find more ""authentic"" options elsewhere, you'll be hard pressed to find more consistently delicious choices.  The empanadas (or pastellitos as we Dominicans call them) are MUST HAVES. Cuddos to the chefs for the constantly tweaking the recipes in effort to improve them. I was disappointed to find out the recently nixed the bacalao but I get it...most Park Slope American folks don't know what that is. Here's a suggestion: bring them back as ""cod empanadas.""  The chicken, beef, domino (bean), goat cheese, and new shrimp and steak empanadas are all great. For dinner I recommend the garlic chicken, fish tacos or something off their constantly revolving specials menu. The service here is unmatched. You will be hard pressed to find owners who care more about the customers than George Constantinou and Farid Ali.  Oh and the tres leches? Some nights I just show up for this amazing desert after eating dinner elsewhere.",4.0
"From the moment I walked in I knew this place was going to be not good, but awesome. I must start this review by talking about the Bogota Latin Bistro staff. From the host to the young lady who escorted my friend and I to our table to our waiter, Frazer, to the busboy, hands down a friendly, attentive, and a wonderful staff. My friend and I made reservations for 7:30 PM, but we arrived 20 minutes late. Our host was very understanding and he said our table was still there for us. The young lady who escorted us to our table immediately welcomed us. Asked us if this was our first time here (yes, it was). She went over the menu with us to tell us what were the popular dishes, drinks here and recommendations. Our waiter, Frazer, was very friendly and attentive. He too, went over what was popular and he suggested. Frazer kept coming back every now and then to check up on us and made sure everything was good. The busboy kept refilling our waters without having to ask for a refill. Now, lets get to the Tasty stuff. Before you order:They start you off with some Plantain Chips with a side of aiji sauce. Not bad. Don't eat too much. We order from the specials menu.Appetizers:1. Bacalao Poppers looked like a size of a cheeto ball. Very tasty. Dip it in the sauce and it gives a tiny kick to it. 2. The turkey empanada, that was the better appetizer of the two. Dip it in the sauce and you get one delicious mouth watering empanada. I think that was the best empanada I've ever had even though I never had a turkey one. I wish I had more. Main Course:1. Plantain Lasagna with a side salad. It wasn't bad. Wasn't my favorite. Tons of meat inside it. 2. On the other hand, the duck was FANTASTIC!!!! It was juicy, tender, mouth watering, sweet, and DELICIOUS!!! One of the best ducks I've ever had. I suggest you get that if you order off the specials menu. Overall, Service was awesome and the food was fantastic. 5 stars all around. FYI: Check in on yelp to get your free shot of Aguardiente.and make a reservation because the place is packed.",5.0
"I've been here a couple times. If my friends and I can't decide on a place to eat and are willing to travel a bit, this would likely be our go to spot. The atmosphere is great for catching up with friends and the drinks are good. I've tried a lot of things on the menu, but you really can't go wrong with anything. One of my favorites has to be the guava empanada. The only complaint I have is the guava to cheese ratio, take me seriously already, more guava! lol They aim to please with the food though, whether in taste or presentation. Come with a couple of friends and order as much as you think you all can eat, share everything. Check-in for a free aguardiente shot, but you should do it before walking in. It's a dead zone (unless you can get on their wifi) in there, good thing you're with people you like!",4.0
"My favorite spot for spanish food in brooklyn...i always go for the bandeja paisa which consists of steak, fried egg, fried rib of pork, beans and corn pita..but i should try other items on the menu...the staff was very professional and polite and were very attentive to my needs..overall atmosphere is great and the drinks were amazing...i cannot wait to go back!",5.0
"We decided to go here based on all the fantastic yelp reviews, but were a little hesitant to walk in. The outside looked like a small dive bar. But I'm glad we ventured in. It's obviously a popular place; we had to wait about 45 minutes for a table on a Friday night. We were impressed at how the host handled the masses and remembered guests names. Turns out he was the owner! Very friendly and invited us back (of course we'll be back!). Our drinks were stiff, meals were delicious, and atmosphere was energizing. Loved it!",5.0
"OH MY GOD. Absolutely amazing. I came to Bogota because I had a gift card for months and finally decided to do something with it. I came on a Saturday night with no reservation, and was told it was a two hour wait. So me and my boyfriend went for a walk to get some coffee but it was ridiculously cold and came back and waited at the bar instead. I ordered white sangria, and he ordered a passion fruit margarita. Both were good, nothing out of this world. Our two hour wait turned into an hour (yay) and we were seated. The waitress immediately greeted us and brought us water and their house plantain chips (which are BOMB) and told us a little background on the menu. We started off with drinks and got two lulo margaritas. These had to be the best beverage I've ever had I just had to keep them coming throughout the meal!Being a Colombian myself, I'm very critical on the food and decided to get a traditional dish which is the Bandeja Paisa. It had all the components, with a cabbage salad (second favorite thing here), and the flavors were all amazing and complimenting. The steak was cooked exactly to my liking (MRare) and everything was on point. The food is amazing, and the service is great! I wish I remembered my servers name, she had glasses and dark hair.

"Bogota is one of my favorite spots in Brooklyn.  I love a fine bourbon neat and generally don't drink much rum, but their coconut caipirinha is my favorite drink on the planet. For me, two is the minimum per trip, and to be honest the maximum if I plan to drive. They're strong and delicious and since trying I haven't felt the need to order anything else. The menu features dishes across the Latin spectrum. While you'll find more ""authentic"" options elsewhere, you'll be hard pressed to find more consistently delicious choices.  The empanadas (or pastellitos as we Dominicans call them) are MUST HAVES. Cuddos to the chefs for the constantly tweaking the recipes in effort to improve them. I was disappointed to find out the recently nixed the bacalao but I get it...most Park Slope American folks don't know what that is. Here's a suggestion: bring them back as ""cod empanadas.""  The chicken, beef, domino (bean), goat cheese, and new shrimp and steak empanadas are all great. For dinner I recommend the garlic chicken, fish tacos or something off their constantly revolving specials menu. The service here is unmatched. You will be hard pressed to find owners who care more about the customers than George Constantinou and Farid Ali.  Oh and the tres leches? Some nights I just show up for this amazing desert after eating dinner elsewhere.",4.0
"From the moment I walked in I knew this place was going to be not good, but awesome. I must start this review by talking about the Bogota Latin Bistro staff. From the host to the young lady who escorted my friend and I to our table to our waiter, Frazer, to the busboy, hands down a friendly, attentive, and a wonderful staff. My friend and I made reservations for 7:30 PM, but we arrived 20 minutes late. Our host was very understanding and he said our table was still there for us. The young lady who escorted us to our table immediately welcomed us. Asked us if this was our first time here (yes, it was). She went over the menu with us to tell us what were the popular dishes, drinks here and recommendations. Our waiter, Frazer, was very friendly and attentive. He too, went over what was popular and he suggested. Frazer kept coming back every now and then to check up on us and made sure everything was good. The busboy kept refilling our waters without having to ask for a refill. Now, lets get to the Tasty stuff. Before you order:They start you off with some Plantain Chips with a side of aiji sauce. Not bad. Don't eat too much. We order from the specials menu.Appetizers:1. Bacalao Poppers looked like a size of a cheeto ball. Very tasty. Dip it in the sauce and it gives a tiny kick to it. 2. The turkey empanada, that was the better appetizer of the two. Dip it in the sauce and you get one delicious mouth watering empanada. I think that was the best empanada I've ever had even though I never had a turkey one. I wish I had more. Main Course:1. Plantain Lasagna with a side salad. It wasn't bad. Wasn't my favorite. Tons of meat inside it. 2. On the other hand, the duck was FANTASTIC!!!! It was juicy, tender, mouth watering, sweet, and DELICIOUS!!! One of the best ducks I've ever had. I suggest you get that if you order off the specials menu. Overall, Service was awesome and the food was fantastic. 5 stars all around. FYI: Check in on yelp to get your free shot of Aguardiente.and make a reservation because the place is packed.",5.0
"I've been here a couple times. If my friends and I can't decide on a place to eat and are willing to travel a bit, this would likely be our go to spot. The atmosphere is great for catching up with friends and the drinks are good. I've tried a lot of things on the menu, but you really can't go wrong with anything. One of my favorites has to be the guava empanada. The only complaint I have is the guava to cheese ratio, take me seriously already, more guava! lol They aim to please with the food though, whether in taste or presentation. Come with a couple of friends and order as much as you think you all can eat, share everything. Check-in for a free aguardiente shot, but you should do it before walking in. It's a dead zone (unless you can get on their wifi) in there, good thing you're with people you like!",4.0
"My favorite spot for spanish food in brooklyn...i always go for the bandeja paisa which consists of steak, fried egg, fried rib of pork, beans and corn pita..but i should try other items on the menu...the staff was very professional and polite and were very attentive to my needs..overall atmosphere is great and the drinks were amazing...i cannot wait to go back!",5.0
"We decided to go here based on all the fantastic yelp reviews, but were a little hesitant to walk in. The outside looked like a small dive bar. But I'm glad we ventured in. It's obviously a popular place; we had to wait about 45 minutes for a table on a Friday night. We were impressed at how the host handled the masses and remembered guests names. Turns out he was the owner! Very friendly and invited us back (of course we'll be back!). Our drinks were stiff, meals were delicious, and atmosphere was energizing. Loved it!",5.0
"OH MY GOD. Absolutely amazing. I came to Bogota because I had a gift card for months and finally decided to do something with it. I came on a Saturday night with no reservation, and was told it was a two hour wait. So me and my boyfriend went for a walk to get some coffee but it was ridiculously cold and came back and waited at the bar instead. I ordered white sangria, and he ordered a passion fruit margarita. Both were good, nothing out of this world. Our two hour wait turned into an hour (yay) and we were seated. The waitress immediately greeted us and brought us water and their house plantain chips (which are BOMB) and told us a little background on the menu. We started off with drinks and got two lulo margaritas. These had to be the best beverage I've ever had I just had to keep them coming throughout the meal!Being a Colombian myself, I'm very critical on the food and decided to get a traditional dish which is the Bandeja Paisa. It had all the components, with a cabbage salad (second favorite thing here), and the flavors were all amazing and complimenting. The steak was cooked exactly to my liking (MRare) and everything was on point. The food is amazing, and the service is great! I wish I remembered my servers name, she had glasses and dark hair. Super sweet. I'm definitely coming back in spite of it being 10 miles from my home!",5.0

"3.5 Stars.  Decent food/nice service/bad drinks. So after a decade of walking by this place and always seeing crowds going in and out we finally gave it a try 2 weeks ago. We did take out about 2 years ago and wasn't bad but wasn't that memorable either so this was out first dine in experience. The space itself is deceptively large yet cramped at same time.  Extremely noisy and very lively.  It was a beautiful evening so asked if we could switch to a table on the ""back porch"".  Turns out this is a dark garage space with a glass roof that is so covered in dirt that feels like you are in basement.  Chairs are extremely uncomfortable and noise is unbearable. The two times we have been the wait staff has been really great. Really energetic and seem happy to be there.  They start you off with plantain chips which seems like they have been sitting out for a while and their signature jarred sauce they sell. This did nothing for us. The first time I got the Bandeja Paisa (Colombian platter) which is ridiculously large and an experience but overall nothing I would want again (dry arepa and just missing something flavor wise).  The wife got the salmon both times with is good but for price point better off going to Petite Crevette for fresh salmon. The second time I get the Pernil which was really good and something I would get again.  On to the drinks.  They definitely push the drinks here and I was happy to give in to the pressure, especially with their  all day happy hour.  The problem is that none of the drinks I had were very good. Nothing tastes like it is made with fresh juices (or hand crafted) but rather from super sweet cheap mixes and plastic jug alcohol. You could get away with this 10 years ago but now a day you expect a lot more in NYC. So in summary, service is great, food is good (but nothing I will exactly crave like other Latin restaurants), drinks are mediocre at best.",3.0
"I've been going to Bogota for almost 9 years and was completely shocked with the awful food and equally bad service this past weekend. We started brunch with a round of cafe con leche, which took forever to be served and then was served without spoons or sugar. We ordered cheese bread and what we were served were some dry tasteless buns of bread. For my meal I ordered a Cuban sandwich with fries, which took about 45 minutes to be served. When I bit into the sandwich, I noticed right away that the bread was completely hard / stale and they barely put any meat in it. I ate a quarter of it and had to stop because the bread cut into the roof of my mouth. I then tried to eat my friend and noticed that they were pretty burnt and look like they had been fried in oil a few times; waiter agreed with me that they were in bad shape. The manager took my meal off the check, but I had to go find her because the waiter kept disappearing.",2.0
"I've been to Bogota many times in person. I really recommend the skirt steak and the tres leches. Amazing every single time.  Tonight was the first night that I ordered from Bogota on Seamless.

Despite the confusion, Sean (Shawn?) was courteous, professional, and went out of his way to make the experience a pleasant one. He made sure that I got my food, and even asked me to check in with him later to confirm that I had received it. This was all at 7pm on a Friday night. I'm sure he had other pressing matters to attend to, but did not let that take away from his concern for every individual customer. I also take my hat off to the deliveryman for handling the situation with ease. I'm thoroughly impressed with the food, and equally as impressed with the professionalism and tact of its staff. I hope management appreciates valuable employees like Sean.",5.0
Went there for the first time to have dinner with a few friends. Have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The atmosphere is nice.

"Came here for a birthday/catch-up brunch with the girls. I found the atmosphere to be warm and welcoming. Not a hint of pretentiousness that is prevalent in some Park Slope establishments.

It was good but I liked the white sangria at Pio Pio better. My friends and I tried the empanadas sampler. We ordered two chicken,  one steak and a ""domino"" which was filled with black beans ans feta cheese. I had the steak and it was underwhelming but the cornmeal crust was so good my friends and I just picked around it. My other friend loved the domino empanada. The chicken empanadas were good, not a whole bunch of flavors but it is enhanced with the sauces that are provided. I ordered steak and eggs. My meal of grilled skirt steak and scrambled eggs with a salad and Yucatan home fries was nice. My steak was tasty, more raw than my request for medium.",4.0
"My boyfriend and I came here for an early dinner and we had the empanadas. We tried the chicken, the black beans, the vegetable, and the steak.

As an entree, i had the rotisserie half a chicken and a choice of two sides. I had the yellow rice and quinoa pilaf. I didn't know it was two rice dishes but it worked out anyways. I finished half of my chicken and most of the rice so it was definitely worth it's price. My boyfriend had the plantain crusted chicken with two side of quinoa pilaf and spinach. He says it was the perfect amount and perfect proportion of all his daily intake. The customer service wasn't too bad either so I gave this place a 5!

"Bogota Latin Bistro is a great choice for Latin American -- a term used broadly -- in a great location with great service -- and drinks. I had a very good meal and enjoyed the space. (Kay C's review below is a great in-depth discussion of the food.) First off, the restaurant gave me a shot just for checking in. Already, we're friends. Then I ordered a Caipirinha. It was excellent. (Sweeter than the one I had at Esperanto in the East Village.) Enjoyed that by itself. Then the Paella. It had chicken, which was odd, but the rest of the seafood, mussels, squid, shrimp, etc., was excellent. Finally, the tres leches cake was very good.The service, when I dined, was excellent! People were very responsive. It's got a great ambiance. (Although I love Janet Jackson, but Grupo Niche was more what I expected.)And that would be my only knit with the restaurant. It's in Park Slope, so don't expect a place that would be in Jackson Heights -- i.e., no Columbian music -- and the food is pretty diverse in term of Latin food.

Even though we ordered the dip sampler appetizer for $14, we still ran out of chips for our dips.-No substitutions to a side on one of their specials, even with a food allergy! Absurd. The only offer was to remove it without replacing the side! (Yet, of course still charge the full $24)And the tipper... -Don't celebrate a birthday here and expect to bring any cake or desserts. I deliberately brought cupcakes (for ease to not have to get a knife, plates, forks) to celebrate a birthday.  When I asked for napkins because I brought cupcakes, the waiter then advised me there is a $2 charge PER PERSON. (At least he gave me the heads up, it's not his policy so I feel bad he's the messenger.)As a principal, I refuse to pay $2 more (x7 people) on top of the automatically added 20% gratuity! Which I'm sure the gratuity would have been higher too if you account for that extra fee! They really could have said, sorry no outside food, but this is just bad business now to charge the fee.(As we were putting on coats to leave, the waiter then comes over and said the manager said it's okay to eat the cupcakes without the charge now... We were already getting ready to leave? Thanks, but no thanks. We were annoyed and sang happy birthday outside on the sidewalk, in the cold. Thanks bogota latin bistro.)

(At least he gave me the heads up, it's not his policy so I feel bad he's the messenger.)As a principal, I refuse to pay $2 more (x7 people) on top of the automatically added 20% gratuity! Which I'm sure the gratuity would have been higher too if you account for that extra fee! They really could have said, sorry no outside food, but this is just bad business now to charge the fee.(As we were putting on coats to leave, the waiter then comes over and said the manager said it's okay to eat the cupcakes without the charge now... We were already getting ready to leave? Thanks, but no thanks. We were annoyed and sang happy birthday outside on the sidewalk, in the cold. Thanks bogota latin bistro.) Also, there was NO ONE waiting for our table! Not like they needed us out of there.--Never again.",2.0
"The server was great and friendly BUT a bit disappointed with the food. The plaintain crusted chicken was too dry and hard as rock as if it was over fried. I have to say the fried yucca and coconut rice with raisins was good.  The Bandeja Paisa...the pork was hard as rock too. For the price, I think it could be alot better. Lastly, I asked to have my leftover food packed to go, the waiter  takes the dish (the one I want packed to go) and puts other finished plates on top of the food....he should of took the plate, pack it first then return to clean up the rest of the table?",2.0

On Friday night the folks at Bogota Latin Bistro were kind enough to help me host a Shabbat dinner with 35 people. They set up tables in the back patio and were gracious enough to let me bring in some other ritual items for blessings and organize cards for songs and conversation-starters. The menu was fantastic - I made sure it was fish and vegetarian-focused with some great options. Participants ordered their own alcohol in a seamless fashion. We had two great servers who were constantly refilling water pitchers and asking to assist. The food was plentiful so much so that we did not even need dessert! Thanks to the managers and staff of Bogota Latin Bistro - I look forward to dining there again in the future.,4.0
"I had such a fantastic meal at Bogota last weekend that it warranted a review. The service was great, the staff super friendly, and the food delicious.

"Hate this place.Awful service. We waited a full 40 minutes before our food came.

What a load of bullshit because the table next to us got theirs in 10 minutes, and they were the same exact dish. I also found it to be a coincidence that the table happened to be Hispanic, special treatment? Maybe. The other table next to us (also non Hispanic)  were waiting for a long time too. I don't want to claim they are racist, but I find it oddly coincidental.AND we had to request for our appetizers to come out first. Why would A) they not come out first? B) why would you not ask us what our preference was?On top of that, this restaurant attracts some ratchet customers. It is filled with people screaming while drunk.AND the food isn't even anything special. It is also cramped, I felt claustrophobic from the waiters moving chairs around us. At one point they even had physically move our table.Worst $77 I have ever spent.I'm furiously enraged.",1.0

My husband ordered chuletas and the absent minded waiter brought the chuletas with two servings of beans, no rice and no cold slaw. I ordered the bandeja paisa which was beyond mediocre. When we asked why the 2 servings of beans the waiter, who has the name of a biblical prophet, argued that we ordered beans and it comes with beans. We said then why didn't you tell us before and he just walked away.The only thing good was the drinks. We will never go back again to this place.

I'm thinking about having a brunch party here before I head back to Amsterdam. I have only been here once before moving for drinks and I loved how the restaurant was decorated. The food is delicious! My friend and I both ordered the Costa Rican brunch and we cleared our plates. Our host was incredible. I'm sure everyone there is probably the same. He was so warm and when they set our table, a child's seat was put in place of a regular chair and they brought water in a sealed container with a straw for my son. A million, billion pluses.

"A group of friends and I headed here on New Years Day because all of the other places we tried to book weren't taking anymore reservations.

It was warm and cozy, and when we got there it was empty. Our server wasn't very attentive and a little quiet, but he was nice and took our orders fairly quickly. We ordered some mimosas, which could have been a little stronger, but they came out fine. When the food came out it was fresh, authentic, and everything we were hoping for. I got to try the empanadas, French toast, breakfast burritos, and benedict. This is definitely where they excelled the most. My only real complaint was the service. It wasn't bad, just nothing special. They must have forgotten to ring in my order because when everyone else's food arrived I had to wait an extra ten minutes for mine.",3.0
"Went here with my girlfriend for a late lunch. For Apps we had empanada's (Beef, Steak, Chicken, and Goat Cheese) which were all really good.

For a main dish we had Fish Taco's which were good but not great. The Chipotle sauce went really well with Taco's. The service and ambiance was pretty good. The food was priced fairly affordable for NYC/Brooklyn prices. Nothing blew me away but the food was good all around. Overall a place worth checking out in Brooklyn. Very Good food at a good price.

"Bogota Latin Bistro already has over a thousand reviews, but hey... Why not just add another one, right?Definitely a great place to eat for two, for a group of friends, or even with family.  The decor sets a fun atmosphere, and aesthetics always allows me to enjoy my food more than if I were to eat in some location that lacked in visual stimulation.I went for a friend's birthday dinner on Wednesday at 6pm.  There were enough people, but the restaurant was not full at all.  By 7 however,  it filled up fast!  I was surprised that the restaurant got packed, and it wasn't even a weekend.The food was.. Omg... It was just good.  Definitely caught me off guard.  I'm hispanic and I initially guessed that the food wouldn't be anything new, but to my surprise, the flavors in the food did not come off as trite.  The calamari was pretty good, and it was adequately seasoned.  But the empanada appetizer stole the damn spotlight!  The shrimp empanadas were probably the best empanadas I have ever tasted!  Like seriously, I could have just ordered a whole plate of just shrimp empanadas.  I ordered the jalapeño grilled catfish, and when it came out, it looked boring, but once again I was fooled.  It tasted pretty good, and it had its own unique taste.  The portions were great and the service was pretty good too!  The waitress was super patient with us even after we bombarded her with thousands of questions lol.  Shout out to Jean-Marie! :). The drinks were not my favorite however.  I mean they weren't bad, but they weren't out off the ordinary.  This place is cute for a birthday, and puts Applebee's and Red Lobster to shame when you compare their enthusiasm in ""happy birthday"" singing.  They literally just bring out the works!  Upon request, they would bring fried cheesecake and a scoop of coconut ice cream while playing the maracas and singing their little lungs away!  Altogether, I had a great time...Thanks Aldeen!  Hopefully I'll be a returning customer!",4.0

I absolutely adored this place. Came here with a friend after a craft class. What a contrast considering I was just sitting making cards for two hours. This place is full of life! I was wiggling my bottoms in my seat the entire time because the music was so good. There is laughter in the air at all times. And the food is just to die for! I ate the steak and chicharron combo.

"Heard a lot about it, decided to take a visit, and I was not disappointed.  My first visit I had Chuletas - fire grilled pork chops, black bean and corn relish with chipotle tomato sauce with a side of vegan black beans and spinach sauteed with gardlic.  This was sooo  good.  The pork chops were cooked perfectly, well seasoned and tender.  The beans and spinach just added to the taste bud dance.  My second trip back they did not have the pork chops so I ordered teh Chicken Quesadillas, with black beans, sweet plantains, pico de gallo and white cheddar.  Light, good and refreshing.  Both times I had the Guacomole  and be very careful because you just may not want to eat your dinner, it is so good!",4.0
I absolutely adored this place. Came here with a friend after a craft class. What a contrast considering I was just sitting making cards for two hours. This place is full of life! I was wiggling my bottoms in my seat the entire time because the music was so good. There is laughter in the air at all times. And the food is just to die for! I ate the steak and chicharron combo. That's what I call a hearty dinner.,5.0
This was a great experience! Had reservations and they seated us the minute we came in. (Usually some places have to get the table ready or something)The staff was extremely friendly and well mannered. The drinks were strong (I had a white sangrita) I ordered the skirt steak which was amazing. The fried yuca was still a little hard on the inside which is the only issue i had with my order.To top it off i shared a Tres Leches cake with my date and it was phenomenal! Overall i had a great experience and we were served in a timely manner (which was good cause we were going to the Nets game). Definitely will go back!,4.0
"Dinner here is awesome. Not as psyched about brunch -- that was more of a 3-star experience. But on to the dinner menu. The chicken tortilla soup is fantastic. The banana bread pudding is EVERYTHING. I'm also a big fan of the skirt steak as an entree, and the sautéed kale as a side. I'm getting hungry just thinking about all of it. :)Did I mention the banana bread pudding has a caramel rum sauce? It's seriously my favorite dessert in all of Park Slope. Stop what you're doing and go get some.",4.0
"Had a wonderful night here this past Thursday as a pre-Valentine's day dinner. The atmosphere and crowd was just right, our server was perfectly attentive, and the food (the most important part, amiright?) was OUTSTANDING. I highly recommend starting with the Empanada Sampler (goat cheese empanadas?! Yes please!) and - if possible - treat yourself to their trout special. I wasn't sure if I was going to like it (not sure I had tried trout before), but my date and I were feeling adventurous and we certainly didn't regret it.Did I mention their super tasty Sangritas? Sangria and a margarita combined in one cup?? Delicious. I will most definitely be back to Bogota and hopefully soon!",5.0
"You know when you see people on the Food Network talking about a certain level of respect for ingredients? That's what this place has.

One of my favorite places to eat in Brooklyn!   Such a fun place to get together with a bunch of people.   The staff is so friendly and attentive.   The food is amazing and reasonably priced.   Definitely try the sangrita.  It's a sangria and margarita drink mixed in one!,5.0

Despite the long wait... I did go on a Friday night the food was pretty awesome. I enjoyed the fried red snapper fish with coconut rice. The coconut rice was absolutely delicious!

"With all of the 4 and 5 star reviews, really was surprised just how bad our meal was.Had to ask 6 times for the plantain chips!  I love my chips, but these were terrible- they said they were just made but tasted like cardboard and the sauces tasted like vinegar.The roasted chicken with garlic sauce was a pretty flavorless letdown at 17 bucks.  Served with incredibly dry rice and tasteless beans.  The only good part of this dish was the roasted sweet plantains, which were pretty delicious.  This rotisserie chicken can't even compare to other Latin chicken dishes at other places.   The arroz con pollo was unbelievably dry and tasteless.  Worst one we've ever tried by far. Sangria was weak and mostly ice.I don't know what was worse - the table of 8 screaming hyena girls too close to us or the way-too-loud Stevie Wonder song they kept playing with the Latin beat.Service was slow.

"Bogota is a bistro that offers Latin American dishes. They have an extensive lunch, dinner & weekend brunch menus, which can be a bit overwhelming. This bistro is known for making homemade aji (green & red) & chipotle sauces. They offer a complimentary order of plantain strip chips with three sauces on the table so everyone can try them. The sauces had great flavors but the texture was kind of watery. The Chicarrones de Pollo was a good starter. It's fried chicken chunks served with aji & cilantro sauce. The cocktail menu had many different varieties: mojitos, caipirinhas, sangria & margaritas. I wanted something sweet & spicy so the Jalapeño Guava Margarita caught my eye. It had jalapeño infused tequila with guava & lime. It was delicious & the flavors had a nice balance between the guava, jalapeño & lime. I was disappointed after the first cocktail though. It did not taste the same due to either the lack of lime or the lack of jalapeño.The Ropa Veja with white rice & maduros was my main course. It's shredded steak marinated in tomato wine sauce with olives & capers. The meat was well seasoned but the rice was undercooked. The food did not seal the deal for me. What did was the staff. Whether in person or over the phone, everyone exemplified great customer service. The waitress was friendly, the table was cleared for the next course & the water was always refilled.

"Been here a few times and almost all the time it is pretty crowded. If you come here on a Friday or Saturday night expect to wait a good 40 minutes, depending on how big your party is. However, don't get me wrong it's well worth the wait and during your wait you can feel free to grab a drink in the narrow space between the bar stools and the wall.The atmosphere is usually lively, a little bit less so for brunch when people are hungover, but nevertheless still lively. The walls are covered in Colombian paintings and decorations. Food was fantastic! I've had breakfast and dinner here before and both were just as equally great, maybe I lean towards the dinner more since the portions are a bit bigger.I've had the Ropa Vieja and Chicken entrees before and let me just say they might not look HUGE, but man are they filling! Looks can be deceiving and here is one of them. The food, plus the sides that are given never disappoint. I usually get the yellow rice and beans or plantains as sides. It always hits the spot and then more.  Everything is cooked right and never under or overcooked. It's one of the few places I visit a few times because of its close proximity to me and of course because of the reliable food and service.",4.0
First time trying Colombian food and I liked it a lot. Similar to other Latin dishes but they all have slight variations. I like what Colombian food has to offer.

"Been here a few times and almost all the time it is pretty crowded. If you come here on a Friday or Saturday night expect to wait a good 40 minutes, depending on how big your party is. However, don't get me wrong it's well worth the wait and during your wait you can feel free to grab a drink in the narrow space between the bar stools and the wall.The atmosphere is usually lively, a little bit less so for brunch when people are hungover, but nevertheless still lively. The walls are covered in Colombian paintings and decorations. Food was fantastic! I've had breakfast and dinner here before and both were just as equally great, maybe I lean towards the dinner more since the portions are a bit bigger.I've had the Ropa Vieja and Chicken entrees before and let me just say they might not look HUGE, but man are they filling! Looks can be deceiving and here is one of them. The food, plus the sides that are given never disappoint. I usually get the yellow rice and beans or plantains as sides. It always hits the spot and then more.  Everything is cooked right and never under or overcooked. It's one of the few places I visit a few times because of its close proximity to me and of course because of the reliable food and service.",4.0
First time trying Colombian food and I liked it a lot. Similar to other Latin dishes but they all have slight variations. I like what Colombian food has to offer. Ordered some appetizers and they didn't disappoint. For the entree shared a hefty plate of Bandeja. Cocktails - tried the mojito and sangria they were strong which I'm sure most people would prefer. Great service even thought there was a little language barrier he still tries his best.,4.0
Absolutely loved this place! Best meal I've had in ages! Service was outstanding and friendly. Drinks were so tasty we had to sample several. :). Bought a couple bottles of sauce to take home with me. I would visit Brooklyn again JUST to eat here. Loved it!,5.0
"Never had a bad experience here. The staff is great and the food is amazing. It's odd, because the entrance is very unassuming, kind of tucked away between a barber shop and some other place that isn't all that notable. At one point, briefly there was a video store next door, or at least down the block a storefront or two. It was an expansion of another popular spot in another neighborhood, but they never really stocked it all that well, and the owner, bless his heart, wanted me to watch THE HOST worse than anything else in the place. It's all he'd ever recommend, and would get increasingly emphatic as time went on. I eventually watched THE HOST on netflix, and it was okay I guess. I prefer my giant monster movies to have a little less CGI and a little more Man In Suit. I don't know if you'd even call THE HOST a ""giant monster movie"" per say. It kind of bored me actually, now that I think about it. Anyway, BOGOTA is great. I took a love interest there once and I think it prolonged what was an inevitable and painful split by about ten days. That's how good it is!",5.0
"Luckily I made a reservation on Open Table because the place was packed! We were greeted at the door and sat right away. I highly recommend making a reservation, even if it's for only 2 people.I had 2 mojitos and they were nothing short of AMAZING. My guest had 2 caipirinhas and they were just as good. We split the guacamole which was yummy, but I wish it was less mushy (I like my guacamole with kinda chunky avocado).When you sit down you get fried plantain chips and they pour their homemade sauce into a ramekin. I could not stop eating that sauce it was delish. I want to go back and buy a bottle of it to have at the house...Then I had the special arepa with shredded beef and white cheese. It was very good, but difficult to eat because the arepa kept falling apart. But, when in doubt, fork it up! Yum.Then for dinner I had the special jerk salmon entree. It came with this pineapple rice which was SO GOOD and I couldn't stop eating it. The salmon was good too, I especially liked the jerk seasoning they used.For desert we split the banana bread pudding a la mode - YOU MUST GET THIS! It was delicious!!I cannot wait to go back to Bogota!",5.0
"I came in on a Wednesday night on the recommendation of a friend. We sat at the bar and our bartender Jazmin was friendly and attentive,she made our experience. I ordered the mojito and my boyfriend the red sangria. They were okay drinks,the cheap liquor later didn't sit well with me. We ordered the empanadas and they were just ok. Definitely overpriced for empanadas. You're paying for park slope I guess.  We then ordered the bandeja Paisa, which I guess you can't really go wrong with but  was also just ok and  overpriced. Overall it was ok definitely over priced for rice and beans. Definitely not somewhere I would go out of my way to go to.",1.0

"I had such an amazing time here last night. It was the first time for my date and I. He chose Bogota based on lots of recommendations from his friends and he wanted to impress me , well it worked! What was so cool about going here was that it was one of several places that I had bookmarked on Yelp, that I was interested in and he didn't know that. I used my Yelp check-in offer for a aguardiente shot which the server was kind enough to serve us two glasses of shots. The decor was very colorful and the atmosphere was lively. The music selection was also great. Our server was very attentive to our needs and we loved his drink suggestions for us. Apparently where we were seated, the heater was very hot which was very uncomfortable for us, so my date suggested that they turned it off which management complied with and they also cracked open a back door for us which was very nice. The food was so amazing, my date only had one issue when his food was served, he had asked for the pork to be omitted out of his order but when the food arrived it was on his plate anyway. The plate was taken away only to be returned in less than two minutes later without the pork, all they did was remove the pork from his plate which I didn't agree with simply because if a person does not eat pork then his food shouldn't have came into contact with pork at all. The food was seasoned to perfection, no complaints here. The desserts are awesome as well. We will definitely come back to eat here.",5.0

"This place is always busy. On Saturday, we came here for an early bird special - dinner at 5:30PM! Even so, the place was bustling and we were asked if we had a reservation. We did not, but we were seated immediately next to a family with a screaming child ;( No worries. I checked in on yelp and got a free shot of Aguardiente. I never tried it before, but it was free so I said hey, why not? It tasted of licorice and was just fine for a free shot. I began to warm up and the sound of the screaming baby started to fade.I am trying to eat vegetarian these days, and there were a few options on the menu for me. This was nice as I have to check the menus at restaurants now before I go out. They were happy to adjust my order to ""no cheese."" I had vegetarian tacos. They were two huge stuffed soft shell tacos. I had a side of maduros and of yuca frita. I asked for a chipotle mayo on the side, whatever they brought was really watery. It was fine.I miss eating meat. Bogota bistro does a mean pernil. Yum. I might make this my flexitarian meal.They also make excellent Caipirinhas. The mojitos are just okay in my opinion but they have many different kinds. Bogota bistro is a reliable standby that I have been enjoying since I moved to Brooklyn and will definitely keep coming back.",4.0
"This place is great! The drinks were solid, I had the Hendricks Mojito which I would definitely recommend.

"I've always had great experiences coming to this place! From the service to the decor to the food, everything was top notch!! I should be giving this place 5 stars. I'll explain why not this time...We came for my cousin's birthday and I made reservations for table for 5. I didn't get the time I wanted and they informed me that it would be a table for 4 with a chair squeezed in but they would do their best to accommodate me which was fine with me. I really wanted my cousin to try this place. We got there early, it was super packed and the bar was full with no place to sit so we went next door to wait and had drinks and appetizers. We got back in time and were seated at a table for 6 which was great! Only thing was that I was sitting against the wall and my seat was pretty low. I truly hate sitting where the table reaches my chest. good thing It was a table for 6 I simply stacked my cushion with another one and was able to reach over the table. Problem solved lol. I'm 5'7 by the way. So our server Eric came and greeted us. He brought water for the table and actually managed to spill 2 glasses. BIG no-no in the serving business in my opinion. Some water spilled on my mother too which I did not like at all (hence the 4 stars) but it wasn't much and I'm just glad it wasn't some sticky alcoholic drink. I'd have definitely caught a fit in there. The wifi was down and the internet service was bad in there but I managed to tell Eric I checked in on Yelp (which it technically does not show) and I received my free aguardiente shot and it was nice and strong. Eric suggested to sip it rather than just down it and that was a good suggestion. We got plantain chips for the table, my cousin ordered a chicken empanada which was REALLY good. For drinks, I had their signature white sangrita which was AWESOME! I ended up throwing the rest of my shot in my drink for an extra kick and that made it more awesome. For entrees, I ordered my usual: Grilled medium rare skirt steak with yellow rice and kale. I usually get the spinach but opted for the kale this time. It came with a side of green aji sauce which was to die for. Imagine a green balsamic vinaigrette with some solids in it. I poured that sucker all over my food and my taste buds had a blast!!I had no room for dessert but I will come back to try the Xangos which is a homemade fried cheesecake taquito dipped in cinnamon sugar with vanilla gelato. Now doesn't that sound enticing? I shook the host's hand, I didn't get his name but he was very polite and thanked us for coming, which I appreciated.

"Came here for brunch with a friend.  We were seated in the back, on the heated patio - nice little area, not too loud from other diners (thought close to the kitchen, with its accompanying noises).I had the breakfast tacos and my friend had the breakfast nachos - great choices, overall.  We're not big meat eaters, but they have plenty of vegetarian and gluten-free options, which was nice - honestly, it was difficult to find a brunch choice that wasn't gluten free or vegetarian (we were just craving flour - lots of it).Service was great, and the environment is nice and festive.  It was a gloomy day and we sat there for quite some time, and our server was patient enough with our prolonged brunch.  I also had the xangos for dessert (I was such a glutton) and it was pretty damn good.  Would seriously recommend for brunch, and I look forward to stopping by for dinner and drinks another time.",4.0

"Getting married to a Colombia can mean a lot of things, besides the natural beauty of their women, my second love of Colombia is their FOOD.  Did someone say MEAT PLATTER!?  YES!  YES!

"I was at Bogota Latin Bistro with my husband this past Saturday. We've been there a few times  before so we knew not to go for dinner because 1. It's always crowded and the wait is ridiculous 2. The food is not the greatest but appetizers are good  and 3. The drinks are over priced after happy hour.We got there at 3pm and ordered some appetizers, It was good. Our drinks were okay but they forgot to put sugar in my mojito twice. Getting the attention of our waitress was so annoying that I just drank the damn thing. I thought it wasn't right that the waitress gave us our check without asking us if we were done. I forgot how this place likes to push customers out to prevent them from ordering drinks before happy hour finishes. I told the waitress we weren't done and ordered two more drinks. I wanted to spend time with my husband away from our busy schedules but felt pressured to leave so we did even though the place had several empty tables. Advice: come before happy hour to take advantage of the drinks because they are over priced and they use way too much ice. Overall, the place is overcrowded and small. The bathrooms are messy with toilet paper all over the place but fairly clean and the food is alright. They seem to not keep the bathrooms tidy. I hope another Latin place opens up in the area.",3.0

"This place is casual and a super popular spot in Park Slope. It gets busier as the day winds down. The restaurant is really small, so if you plan to eat here, make a reservation, otherwise you're going to be waiting awhile for a table. The restaurant is quite loud, on top of the noise made by the customers they were playing music. This place is okay with kids, although for younger toddlers and babies, not so much. It's too crowded and quite loud. The host and waiters are really kind and very attentive to their customers. My family and I had a reservation for early dinner at 5 PM on Easter Sunday, and when we arrived we had to wait a couple minutes, I'd say about 5 minutes before we were seated. My nephews, ages 3 and 1 were seated in high chairs. Before taking our order, our waiter gave us a few baskets of plantain chips and sauce dips, and they were delicious and addicting, free of charge I believe, unless you request for more. For appetizers we ordered calamari, their dip is really tasty(not your typical marinara sauce) and empanada samplers.Everyone at the table ordered the Bandeja Paisa as their entree, which I wish I ordered as well! I ordered an Arroz Con Pollo which tasted good but not as good as the Bandeja Paisa. They do have a kids menu, my nephews shared beans with rice and fish sticks. Our waiter was so kind and gave my baby nephew something to play with, a makeshift rattle. He put some coffee beans in a small plastic container and taped it down so the cover wouldn't come off. My nephew loved it and was entertained for quite awhile. Overall this place is great, I love it, I definitely recommend that you go here at least once to try it out for yourself, I'm sure you won't regret it.

This is the best way to get to Colombia without having to jump on  7 train. The FOOD is as good as anything in Queens but better !! The main reason is that the portion control does its job. You get more than enough food without having to waddle out the door and go into a food coma. The drinks are also to snuff. Get a reservation on a popular night or be prepared to hover at the bar and drink and get some picadillo while you wait. it is well worrth the wait. Great!,5.0

They were able to help me out and complete any request. Except doing something about the kids. Apparently putting small children in a small, dark room is frowned upon. They always did it to me and I turned out fine, right?The food at Bogota is fantabulous. They supply you with plantain chips, don't go overboard because they can fill you up. The empanadas are amazing. If with friends, go with the sampler. The skirt steak sandwich is a good go to for lunch. The Ropa Vieja is a great dish to try. Shredded beef in a nice stew. But I am telling you. If you ever come here. Please try the pork chops. They are some of the best I've ever had. When dealing with pork chops there is a conondrum. Cut them too thick and they can be too chewy. Cut them thin and it's not juicy. Here they are both thin and juicy. A must try.

"Park Slope is dining central, especially along 5th Avenue. A friend suggested we try this restaurant so I went along for the ride. Surprisingly it was a full house at 5 p.m. on a wintry Saturday night. I would later find out that this restaurant is very popular with Yelpers. It was cold and snowing outside but I could feel the Latin heat inside. The restaurant is expanding so we were seated in an insulated space towards the back of the restaurant which was a bit chilly at first because it was recently opened to accommodate for the additional hungry diners out on a Saturday night. We snacked on plantain chips while we contemplated our orders. I eventually decided on a chicken empanada (shredded chicken & potato, Colombian aji sauce) for $4 as my appetizer and for my main course, plantain-crusted chicken (pan-fried chicken breast, mango bbq sauce) along with my two sides, tostones (fried green plantains) and red cabbage salad for $16. I was surprised that my meal was wheat and gluten free. Service was pretty quick too. I was disappointed with my empanada which did not taste or have the texture of chicken, but I did like the crust (does that count?). I loved the chicken which was nice and soft, the crust just crumbled on my plate with ease. The tostones were okay too. I wasn't a fan of the red cabbage or the mango bbq sauce.I loved the music and decor, which included a nice mural along with exposed brick and mortar. Great, festive atmosphere.

"Wanted to grub after a concert at the Barclays. Seeing Buffalo Wild Wings crowded, decided to take a stroll.Always wanted to venture in Park Slope since it has a lot of gems. Happen to find this place as nearest and open and popped in.Decor is very nice and it seem like all the patrons were out before/after a night out to enjoy this food. Wanted something light so we ordered a chicken quesadilla with a side of guac and two mojitos.Checked in to get free shot to get the meal started:Quesadilla was delicious!! The sweet plantains add extra flavor and wish it didn't end. Guac was more on the garlicky side for me but still on point.Maybe it was the bartender'a off day or our taste buds were off because drinks were not good at all. Watery and tasteless. We super politely asked to change to margaritas and our server did so with no hesitation (she really made the experience better being so nice). After getting the margaritas, same as before: bland. At that point we gave up on the drinks and ordered the Empanada Platter.Was suggested the Beef and Shrimp and also got Bacalao (codfish) and Steak. They came with these sauces and guac. I loved the Shrimp and accompany sauce the best. Found myself just dipping all four in that one.Will be back to try other dishes and happy hour because drinks could not be THAT bad and to devour way more shrimp empanadas, with extra sauce. A lot of extra sauce.",4.0
"Every experience I have had here has been great! Food is amazing, service is great, there are always a ton of people, and I highly recommend it.The empanadas are to die for, probably some of the best I've ever had.

I have also gotten some other shredded steak dish that was amazing as well. They give you so much you have a lot of leftovers.Every time service is outstanding. The waiter we had the other day was amazing and when we told him he said it was his first day on the job and he had just been promoted. The host or owner who walks around to greet everybody is really friendly, this is a really fun place to eat any night of the week.",5.0
"Had it not been for my previous amazing experience over here I would have given it a one star. And this one star is basically for the bar tender 'Tyler'. To give you all the base, I have been here plenty of times and have loved each and every moment. I had suggested it to many people and they felt the same. The Margaritas and the vegetarian options are amazing.Now for my experience on that particular day. I sat at the bar with my friend. Tyler was the bar tender. From the start he was rude. My friend forgot her ID and showed her nursing Id which had her date of birth. He refused to give her any drinks. She came all the was from DC and I took her at Bogota with very high hopes.While requesting to serve her drinks I told him I'm a frequent visitor, his reply was he has never seen me in the one year he has been working. Never ever have I heard anyone so rude.Later he got us empanadas which was cold and not what we ordered. While requesting him to replace it he was stating that he is finding it difficult to understand my accent which no one has told me before.The people sitting next to me left early and we met them outside and everyone had the same opinion. He is the worst bar tender ever! surprised to see Bogota hiring him cause everyone else is really nice.I love this place but I don't know whether I will want to go back here again.My advise- guys visit this place for the drinks and food - DO NOT SIT AT THE BAR- TYLER IS THE WORST BAR TENDER.",2.0
"Oh, Bogota...I have lived and worked in Park Slope for years. I've been meaning to write a bad review for quite sometime, but after this last experience I am never setting foot in this place again.As another fellow Colombian I want to like Bogota, but they make it impossible. The only meal I have ever had there that was decent was brunch five years ago. Their food is gross, takes forever, and not authentic tasting whatsoever. Maybe they don't think the non-Colombian/ Latino folk will notice. Too bad. To top it off the staff is consistently poorly trained and they're super rude. I can't figure out why this place is always so packed. I have been disappointed by their food and service consistently throughout the years. Apparently that's what they truly excel in.The only reason I go there is usually to appease others. This last time we were having a large staff dinner, so I had no choice. WOW! Our server (and the manager on duty) was a diva, he was nasty, condescending and totally rude to us. He screwed up a bunch of our orders and then gave us attitude about it. To top it off all of the courses (we had three) were not god tasting whatsoever. I had the chicken empanada and then the pernil. The empanada had a lot going on inside of it (besides chicken) and the pernil tasted like curry sauce. Very bizarre. I will say their drinks are tasty albeit they are stingy with the alcohol.It's a shame. This place will probably remain popular to people who don't mind poor service and don't know any better about Latin food. I say- avoid this place at all costs.",1.0

"The food is fantastic. We order several appetizers to share as a group and we have not found an entree we didn't like. The chicken stuffed platanos and empanadas are delicious. We have never had an issue with service. Even when there was a mix up with our reservation they apologized and quickly found us a table. They are even attentive when we come as a family, but it's great for girls night or date night.If the drinks were not so overpriced for the size and quality I'd give it five stars.",4.0
"Yum, yum, yum! I absolutely love everything about this place, the food, drinks and ambiance are top notch...even on a Monday night. My last visit was a couple of weeks ago before attending a concert at Barclays. I walked about 7-8 mins up 5th Ave to this amazing spot. I sat at the bar and ordered my go to drink here, the otherworldly Coconut Caipirinhas, as I looked over the menu. I decided on doing a few apps rather than a full meal. Chicken Empanada: Cornmeal dough with shredded chicken & potato, Colombian aji sauce. Flavorful meat and potato wrapped in a crisp and flaky crust with not a trace of grease.Bacalao Empanada: Overstuffed (in a good way)with salted codfish, roasted corn and jalapeno in an equally delicious wheat dough with guacamole on the side, not spicy though.White Arepa: white cornmeal cake (opposed to Chocolo, which is a sweet yellow cornmeal) toasted w/butter. I opted for the additional shredded queso blanco on top. I also used some of the guac that came with the empanada. Crispy on outside and rich from the cheese on top, so damn good!Service was awesome. While sitting there, a bottle of jalapeno vodka caught my eye and I asked my bartender/server how it was. He said he didnt know and poured us both a shot and didnt charge me.

"I came here for a delicious brunch one Sunday.  The Migas de Arepa was so good!  I loved the garlic sauce, both for dipping the tostones and pouring over the dish.  The meal had me full and satisfied for the rest of the day.I also tried the passionfruit mimosa and mango mimosa.  Both were good, though I prefer the mango.  The waitress seemed a bit distracted, though it was somewhat understandable since the place was packed.",4.0
Always love the service here! All the food I've gotten here usually have a wonderful medley of flavors. The watermelon mojito was yummy but not very strong.I would highly recommend this restaurant. I've been here three times and counting within the past year or so. :),4.0

"Wanted to grub after a concert at the Barclays. Seeing Buffalo Wild Wings crowded, decided to take a stroll.Always wanted to venture in Park Slope since it has a lot of gems. Happen to find this place as nearest and open and popped in.Decor is very nice and it seem like all the patrons were out before/after a night out to enjoy this food. Wanted something light so we ordered a chicken quesadilla with a side of guac and two mojitos.Checked in to get free shot to get the meal started:Quesadilla was delicious!! The sweet plantains add extra flavor and wish it didn't end. Guac was more on the garlicky side for me but still on point.Maybe it was the bartender'a off day or our taste buds were off because drinks were not good at all. Watery and tasteless. We super politely asked to change to margaritas and our server did so with no hesitation (she really made the experience better being so nice). After getting the margaritas, same as before: bland. At that point we gave up on the drinks and ordered the Empanada Platter.Was suggested the Beef and Shrimp and also got Bacalao (codfish) and Steak. They came with these sauces and guac. I loved the Shrimp and accompany sauce the best. Found myself just dipping all four in that one.Will be back to try other dishes and happy hour because drinks could not be THAT bad and to devour way more shrimp empanadas, with extra sauce. A lot of extra sauce.",4.0
"Every experience I have had here has been great! Food is amazing, service is great, there are always a ton of people, and I highly recommend it.The empanadas are to die for, probably some of the best I've ever had. I think that the maduros here are probably the best I've had as well. I have gotten the arroz con pollo and it was delicious, and they give you a ton. I have also gotten some other shredded steak dish that was amazing as well. They give you so much you have a lot of leftovers.Every time service is outstanding. The waiter we had the other day was amazing and when we told him he said it was his first day on the job and he had just been promoted. The host or owner who walks around to greet everybody is really friendly, this is a really fun place to eat any night of the week.",5.0
"Had it not been for my previous amazing experience over here I would have given it a one star. And this one star is basically for the bar tender 'Tyler'. To give you all the base, I have been here plenty of times and have loved each and every moment. I had suggested it to many people and they felt the same. The Margaritas and the vegetarian options are amazing.Now for my experience on that particular day. I sat at the bar with my friend. Tyler was the bar tender. From the start he was rude. My friend forgot her ID and showed her nursing Id which had her date of birth. He refused to give her any drinks. She came all the was from DC and I took her at Bogota with very high hopes.While requesting to serve her drinks I told him I'm a frequent visitor, his reply was he has never seen me in the one year he has been working. Never ever have I heard anyone so rude.Later he got us empanadas which was cold and not what we ordered. While requesting him to replace it he was stating that he is finding it difficult to understand my accent which no one has told me before.The people sitting next to me left early and we met them outside and everyone had the same opinion. He is the worst bar tender ever! surprised to see Bogota hiring him cause everyone else is really nice.I love this place but I don't know whether I will want to go back here again.My advise- guys visit this place for the drinks and food - DO NOT SIT AT THE BAR- TYLER IS THE WORST BAR TENDER.",2.0
"Oh, Bogota...I have lived and worked in Park Slope for years. I've been meaning to write a bad review for quite sometime, but after this last experience I am never setting foot in this place again.As another fellow Colombian I want to like Bogota, but they make it impossible. The only meal I have ever had there that was decent was brunch five years ago. Their food is gross, takes forever, and not authentic tasting whatsoever. Maybe they don't think the non-Colombian/ Latino folk will notice. Too bad. To top it off the staff is consistently poorly trained and they're super rude. I can't figure out why this place is always so packed. I have been disappointed by their food and service consistently throughout the years. Apparently that's what they truly excel in.The only reason I go there is usually to appease others. This last time we were having a large staff dinner, so I had no choice. WOW! Our server (and the manager on duty) was a diva, he was nasty, condescending and totally rude to us. He screwed up a bunch of our orders and then gave us attitude about it. To top it off all of the courses (we had three) were not god tasting whatsoever. I had the chicken empanada and then the pernil. The empanada had a lot going on inside of it (besides chicken) and the pernil tasted like curry sauce. Very bizarre. I will say their drinks are tasty albeit they are stingy with the alcohol.It's a shame. This place will probably remain popular to people who don't mind poor service and don't know any better about Latin food. I say- avoid this place at all costs.",1.0

"The food is fantastic. We order several appetizers to share as a group and we have not found an entree we didn't like. The chicken stuffed platanos and empanadas are delicious. We have never had an issue with service. Even when there was a mix up with our reservation they apologized and quickly found us a table. They are even attentive when we come as a family, but it's great for girls night or date night.If the drinks were not so overpriced for the size and quality I'd give it five stars.",4.0
"Yum, yum, yum! I absolutely love everything about this place, the food, drinks and ambiance are top notch...even on a Monday night. My last visit was a couple of weeks ago before attending a concert at Barclays. I walked about 7-8 mins up 5th Ave to this amazing spot. I sat at the bar and ordered my go to drink here, the otherworldly Coconut Caipirinhas, as I looked over the menu. I decided on doing a few apps rather than a full meal. Chicken Empanada: Cornmeal dough with shredded chicken & potato, Colombian aji sauce. Flavorful meat and potato wrapped in a crisp and flaky crust with not a trace of grease.Bacalao Empanada: Overstuffed (in a good way)with salted codfish, roasted corn and jalapeno in an equally delicious wheat dough with guacamole on the side, not spicy though.White Arepa: white cornmeal cake (opposed to Chocolo, which is a sweet yellow cornmeal) toasted w/butter. I opted for the additional shredded queso blanco on top. I also used some of the guac that came with the empanada. Crispy on outside and rich from the cheese on top, so damn good!Service was awesome. While sitting there, a bottle of jalapeno vodka caught my eye and I asked my bartender/server how it was. He said he didnt know and poured us both a shot and didnt charge me. Also gave me a glass of Brazil Sangria (red wine, cachaca, strawberries, lime, passion fruit juice) before I left but I really didnt like it. Needless to say I was a happy camper on my way to the show. Dreaming of the next time I'll return.",5.0

"Went here early Friday afternoon with a friend an exhausted toddler sleeping in the stroller. Place is small but not stuffy. Don't care much for the decor. Place was obviously not yet packed since we were there for very early fibber. So we got prime seating to allow for safe stroller parking inside.I had a craving for arepas, so I got the arepa de chocolo (a sweet yellow corn meal cake toasted with butter) topped with chorizo and guacamole... Delish. It had the right amount of sweetness and cooked to perfection. I also had their goat cheese and beef empanadas. The casing of each empanadas were unique, which complemented the stuffing inside. Certain times the empanadas are 3 dollars each if ordered at the bar. Very good deal. Wish I knew sooner cause the empanadas were amazing. So amazing that I took 4 home. They has a special 4 empanadas for $12 to go. Also the empanadas came with its own unique dipping sauce to compliment.For drinks I had the guava mojito. I can taste the freshness of the herbs used to make this one hell of a drink, Definitely coming back. Such great food and the service was also very good.",4.0

"3...or...4...hmmmm...tough call. I'm giving this place a 3 star review solely for the Sunday Brunch. Had I gone for dinner, I would have given this place at least a 4 or 5 stars. For anyone who wants to try this restaurant out, I find their dinner menu to be much more attractive. I came here for a Sunday brunch to celebrate a really good friend's belated birthday and was disappointed with the limited menu I had to stick with. The dinner menu definitely has a wider selection that I was hoping to try such as the paella and the garlic chicken. Better luck next time!Colombian food Is known to be large portions or family style, therefore the three of us ordered 2 entrees and the empanada samplers. For the samplers, we chose the basics which were shrimps, chicken, beef, and codfish. I was hoping they were baked, but that was wishful thinking! Nevertheless, they were very moist and full of flavor. The Arroz Con Pollo was unfortunately a disappointment. I was expecting pieces of chicken with rice and beans, but it was actually shredded DRY chicken over rice. If you pour the black bean over it, I'm sure it's fine, but I'm not a fan of beans. The Bandeja Pais was a better option, with our steak served medium rare (it was very tender, blasting with flavor and cooked perfectly). I also do like chorizo so we added that on top of our dish. The best part of our whole meal would have to be their Mojitos. When they mentioned that they have won many national awards for it, I had to applaud for that. They don't water down your drink or throw in some cheap liquor. It was hands down the best mojito I have ever tried. FYI: They actually read everything in the notes when you make the online reservations. I asked if they can put a candle on the dessert to surprise the Birthday boy. Unfortunately, the hostess jumped the gun on me and started wishing my friend a ""Happy Birthday"" before I even got to the restaurant. No problem, we actually didn't end up staying for desserts. However, all the other staff members were very attentive! I must come back and try their dinner and then I'll give them a more fair rating on their foods.",3.0
This place gets 5 stars from me. the food was good and service was even better.When you walk in you are served complementary plantain chips which were delicious. for appetizers we ordered chips and guac which was also good.  I ordered the plantain crusted chicken with coconut rice and sweet plantains on the side as my meal which was delicious.  the chicken seemed to be a little dry but because everything else was so good I will still give it 5 stars.Because I checked in on yelp while there I was given a free shot!The servers were so nice and accommodating being that we did not have a reservation on a Sat night and we had 6 people.  We waited about 20 min to be seated. The waiter was really nice and so was everyone else who came up to our table to ask us if everything was okay.  Loved it here. Will definitely be back.,5.0
"Almost got fish tacos, but my daughter said, it's Colombian- get something Colombian. She was right, of course. So I ordered the Patacone with black beans. It was delicious! The black beans had a subtle flavor that was different from most (i always love them but face it, they aren't really exciting most of the time) and delicious. The base was fried whole plantians- which sounds heavy but was actually thin and provided a solid base. Plus we tried some fruit drinks that were new to us- lulo shake was tart at first then got sweeter as I adjusted. I love being introduced to new fruits! We were there on a Tuesday night and it was crowded. They predicted 30 min wait, and it was only about 10 mins. Happy surprise. Definitely recommend this place!",4.0

"We went for brunch today.  The ambiance is appropriately Latin/Brooklyn funky.  The service was friendly and attentive.  There is an obvious effort to providing great service and ensuring staff is trained to do so.  It showed throughout the meal, though the 2 arepas and 4 empanadas that we ordered ""to go"" after we were done with our meal took forever to arrive (~20 minutes).  It was a bit warm in the dining room, and we were ready to go as we kept waiting...  As for the food itself, it didn't really excite me.  We started with Bunuelos y Pan de Bonos.  The bunuelos had something that made them slightly sweet (cinnamon, brown sugar, ??), which was OK, but I prefer a straight up fried cheesy dough ball. The Pan de Bono was better. The guava butter was a nice, sweet touch.  After that, we had a Colombian Breakfast and Migas de Arepa. The pericos were fine.  My wife liked the rice & beans, but I didn't care for it much.  The tostones were a disappointment.  Way too thin, which made them dry and tough.  & I love tostones, so that makes a big impression on me.  Overall, I left feeling like it wasn't worth battling traffic from Jersey City to get here just to try somewhere new for brunch.  Maybe the dinner menu is more exciting.  I am willing to go back and try.",3.0

I glance around and see that there are not only one but several tables available. When I asked the hostess, what would happen if we are not done eating since it is already 6:15 she says they can bring our plates to the front of the restaurant (where people wait while their tables are ready). I couldn't comprehend why if we are paying guests that are currently there, why would we have to move if there were plenty of tables available. The waitress also seemed to just speak to us and if she was uninterested and could be doing other things with her time.

I felt bad though our waitress didn't have any patience. The atmosphere of the restaurant was very beautiful. The passion fruit smoothie was refreshing (loved it). Love the music that they played. I will definitely not be going back or recommend anyone to go there.,2.0
"I'd like to start by saying I will definitely be back here.  We came for brunch on Saturday morning.  I ordered the Latin Breakfast with fried eggs.  It was great.  simple. beans, rice, eggs, fried plantains (sooo goood!!).  My boyfriend ordered the baked egg dish with chorizo it was delicious but smaller than expected.  Drink wise, I had the michaleda and he had a chipotle marg which was clearly made with canned pineapple so not great.  The serve was really good too. attentive, refilled our waters, and the food arrived within 15 minutes.  We'll definitely be back here.",4.0
"I visited this restaurant once before for happy hour and loved it. The service and the food was amazing. I decided to try it again today but WOW was I disappointed. Upon arriving, we are told that they can definitely seat us but we would need to clear out by 7:30 since there is a reservation for that table. I glance around and see that there are not only one but several tables available. When I asked the hostess, what would happen if we are not done eating since it is already 6:15 she says they can bring our plates to the front of the restaurant (where people wait while their tables are ready). I couldn't comprehend why if we are paying guests that are currently there, why would we have to move if there were plenty of tables available. The waitress also seemed to just speak to us and if she was uninterested and could be doing other things with her time. I left hungry and disappointed - craving their mojitos and after being stuck in an hour of traffic since we were coming from Williamsburg. Honestly, if your going to come here make a reservation since they will kick you out of your table even if your eating unless you do.",1.0

"I went there with some co-workers. We had a prefix menu. The food was terrible. The beans were extremely salty that it was impossible to eat. The rice was dry and flavorless. The plantain breaded chicken didn't have any flavor. The flan was probably the worse I ever had. The service was awful (but this commentary could be an entire memoir on its own).I can't understand why this place is called ""Bogota"" and on top of that their label is ""Latin Bistro."" There are countless of Latin restaurants around 5th Avenue with much more flavorful cuisine than this ""Latin Bistro"" wannabe.  It was a complete mistake dining here. This restaurant has absolutely nothing to do with Colombian food.",1.0
"Mmm, came here last night for the first time with a group of friends after having this bookmarked for awhile! Made a reservation that morning through Yelp just in case, but we had no issues getting seated!When you walk in, you are greeted by a really fun atmosphere, with all their decorations and music. I didn't get to see the backyard patio although I saw pictures from other Yelp reviews.. will have to sit there another time!To drink, I ordered their caipirinha. I was really tempted by their drink specials, which had watermelon-flavored mojitos and margaritas! No regrets though, because the caipirinha was delicious. To order, I went straight for the skirt steak, no second thoughts! The sides I chose were yellow rice and cilantro mashed potatoes (the entrees come with two sides!) My boyfriend had the Colombian platter, which I kind of had my eye on because it comes with skirt steak, but it also has 500 other things with it, haha. Once the food came out, I shut up and went to work on it. The portions are a good size, with my plate consisting of two strips of the skirt steak. I could've stopped after eating the first one, but why would I? I was enjoying my plate way too much. I was stuffed by the time I finished it all. My friend who also ordered the skirt steak devoured his entire plate in the time it took me to eat my first piece.. and I was eating pretty quickly!My boyfriend had a marathon with his Colombian platter. Two strips of the skirt steak, pork chicarron, maduros, arepa, rice with fried egg on top, beans.. and I forget what else! It was a feast!Overall, we were very satisfied with our dinner! It came out to about 35/person for the entree + drink, including tax and tip, which was well worth it!",4.0
"Bogota Latin Bistro is the place to be when dining with family, friends and or alone. Happy hour is never a dull moment with delectable appetizers to choose from.

"Came here once in 2010 and revisited it again (2013).The service is always over-the-top wonderful which make this place great date place for friends or family or significant other or mistress..My favorite is the Street corn, it come out grilled and smothering in some addictive Chipotle mayo sauce and cheese. (they sell the addictive sauce btw)The dish I had was the Colombian plate which was HUGE, 2 steaks AND pork? I wasn't a big fan of the pork but the steaks were medium rare (just how I ordered it) and just perfect. Fried plantains and raw egg, just everything I wanted and craved really hitting all the spots with this dish.Even though they ran out of plantain chips, I was really satisfied with the service, food and atmosphere. I'd highly recommend this place.",5.0
I would like to believe that I am the reason they have finally placed the Vaca Frita on the permanent menu! You are all welcome! Lol. Omg I absolutely love this place and the Vaca Frita.

Whatever you order on their menu, you will not be disappointed. By far the best fried calamari I've ever had in the city. They make it with cornmeal and spices/seasonings rather than your average deep-fried batter. The mashed potatoes are to die for. I've never had green mashed potatoes in my life, so I was a little skeptical, but was pleasantly surprised.I could go on all day, but really: Don't walk past this place without going to check it out first.",5.0

Favorite Latin spot in park slope, so far.  Definitely have the empanadas sampler, and I highly recommend the guava empanada - sooo good!  Drink are really good and not cheap on liquor.  Last time I was there and had desert (I normally don't do desert) we had the tres leches and it was amazing!",5.0
"I'm so happy to have moved right down the block from Bogata. Bogata is a pretty typical Latin American restaurant. For some reason, it has a Applebees type feel when you walk in. Its pretty large, with lots of nooks, and while dimly lit covered with bright lights and wall decor.The service was excellent from the hostess down to the busboy. Everyone was friendly and attentive but not overbearing.The food was really good - we got the Jerk Chicken special and Plantain Crusted chicken breast. The chicken was really good and flavorful but both dishes kind of skimped on the sides. For $20 a dish I'd expected a little bit more.The margaritas are no joke - after one I was feeling it. Still, all of the cocktails are pretty small and range from $9-$12. I definitely will be back for happy hour when I could get them for half the price.",4.0

"Cute Latin trendy restaurant. Great area and great decor but it is pricey. I had the stuffed sweet plantain to start and it was good. The sauce was like a chipotle sauce and it was good. To drink I had the sangrita which was okay and the jalapeño margarita was amazing. I actually first got the mexcalito and it was to smokey but our lovely waitress offered to change it to the jalapeño margarita and it was amazing! Infused and strong! For entrees we had the rotisserie chicken in lemon garlic sauce and pernil. While the main course was delicious , the sides were not. So the good is that pernil was absolutely amazing :perfect Sazon, texture, condiments. The garlic rotisserie chicken was amazing too! It wasn't creamy which I was happy about but the garlic and seasoning was so well done. Big portion too! The rice was not to my liking. The beans were eh. Yuca was good and the kale was delicious. The only reason I would give this is a because it's too expensive for what it is. The rice and beans sucked and that's fundamental in a restaurant especially when I felt that I got served instant rice. Service was great too but overall the restaurant didn't woo me. I'm def hoping to come back but for brunch or lunch or happy hour Bc the drinks were delicious.",3.0

"Consistently great! I've been going to Bogota for several years now, and brunch, dinner or happy hour the food is always very tasty and affordable, the drinks are well composed and the service is great. Perhaps more importantly is that they have maintained a clean kitchen and an A health rating. You can't go wrong with the empanada sampler and skinny mojito. They make an awesome kale salad too. No it's not especially Colombian, but I'd say the dishes include a cross-section of South American and Caribbean flavors with some obligatory trendy stuff that is meant to appeal to hipsters and the health conscious. This place gets 5 stars for giving a good time and a great meal each and every time I've been there.",5.0

"The service here was by far the best I've experienced! Now, I'm a little biased here b/c one of our friends knows George, the owner. I made reservations, and even though George wasn't there, the manager, Luis, took very good care of us. It didn't hurt that he was smiling the entire time.We started with a round of drinks. They have a nice mojito selection, but I went with the virgin frozen colada b/c it just sounded really tasty. I tasted my friend's white sangria, which was also nice, as well as another friend's mojito. I appreciate that they have a lot of different types of virgin drinks (I'm very sensitive to alcohol) and many, many vegetarian options as well. Two thumbs up on that alone!Since the frozen colada pretty much filled me up, so I went with a few sides: an empanada, grilled corn, and the gallo pinto. The star was the gallo pinto--though it didn't look all that nice, it was bursting with flavor, and I loved it. The corn was super juicy and delicious, too. The empanada was just okay, a little too deep fried/crunchy for me. The ambiance was really nice. It felt intimate, but fun, and it wasn't too loud. Four of us were able to have a conversation without yelling or straining to hear each other. I can't stress enough how well Luis took care of us. At one point, I was looking for an outlet to charge my phone. Out of nowhere, Luis came and pointed out the nearest outlet. So attentive! :)We were welcomed by the staff and treated really well throughout our dinner. I would definitely come back to try all they have to offer.

Wasn't a big fan of the yucca fries (too soggy and starchy).For my entree, I had the blue corn trout (the name also resulted in some Pocahontas theme song-singing). Two large filets of fish (dark, but not blackened) with a cube of jalapeno mac and cheese, and also a side of sauteed kale. The mac and cheese was good, but I could've done without so much of it.

"I am colombian born and raised in Bogotá. Moved to LA 10years ago. When i came across this restaurant on my visit to new york i was thrilled 1. The name itself gave me flashbacks of the great food we have in our city. 2. The menu looked spectacular it even had things that are from partner cities to mine. 3 i liked the decor. My girlfriend and i ordered the Ajiaco which is a traditional cream soup that is mouthwathering to all who have tried in my country. Here it was OKAY....Mt problem was that besides it being served cold it was extremely salty. Also the bandeja paisa which was pretty good except when after two bites my meats were sooo cold! Ask for your dishes hot! They brought me drinks, appetizer,main dishes ALL at the same time! Overall ok experience...ohhh! And it said free shot of agua ardiente if you check in on yelp, being colombian let me tell you that it's extremely watered down. But it's FREE, so I guess something is better than nothing....",3.0

Me and my friend are regulars at Bogota and all of sudden, they are now asking us for our cards and identification. I find this very tacky, low class, and insulting.

"I am colombian born and raised in Bogotá. Moved to LA 10years ago. When i came across this restaurant on my visit to new york i was thrilled 1. The name itself gave me flashbacks of the great food we have in our city. 2. The menu looked spectacular it even had things that are from partner cities to mine. 3 i liked the decor. My girlfriend and i ordered the Ajiaco which is a traditional cream soup that is mouthwathering to all who have tried in my country. Here it was OKAY....Mt problem was that besides it being served cold it was extremely salty. Also the bandeja paisa which was pretty good except when after two bites my meats were sooo cold! Ask for your dishes hot! They brought me drinks, appetizer,main dishes ALL at the same time! Overall ok experience...ohhh! And it said free shot of agua ardiente if you check in on yelp, being colombian let me tell you that it's extremely watered down. But it's FREE, so I guess something is better than nothing....",3.0
"I've been attending this establishment for about 2 years now. And back then, the service would be amazing. Every single time me and my friend would attend it was 100% across the board. However, in the last several months since the begging of 2015 things have begun to change. Me and my friend are regulars at Bogota and all of sudden, they are now asking us for our cards and identification. I find this very tacky, low class, and insulting. Especially when we are regulars at this place.",1.0

"My friend is always bragging about all the great food options in Park Slope and this place fits the bill.Upon arrival they told us the wait time for a party of five could be up to 30 minutes, but we were seated in less than 5! The waiter was attentive and very friendly.  I enjoyed the complimentary chips with their special sauce and our group also shared 2 servings of delicious nachos and guacamole. I went pretty healthy for my entree, grilled chicken with two sides (parsley mashed potatoes and black beans). The chicken was a hearty size, with two large pieces and was marinated quite well. There was also an extra Colombian sauce they provided for the chicken which added just enough kick. The mashed potatoes were impressive and the black beans were what you would expect from a South American joint.My friends really enjoyed the cocktails, even though I was not drinking.

"We dined at Bogota Latin Bistro while in Park Slope, Brooklyn and it did not disappoint! We went in for a late lunch and there was plenty of seating. Décor is really bright and an overall fun ambiance. Oh and if you love it THAT much, you can buy a t-shirt along with a ton of other restaurant souvenirs. The menu is huge and the gluten-free (GF) options as well as vegetarian and vegan options are clearly marked which is great. But the best part? They have two dedicated GF fryers which DRASTICALLY cuts down on gluten cross-contamination - yay!Menu had a great mix of Columbian and Latin American foods. I opted for the chilaquiles and they were decent - topped with scrambled eggs, chipotle tomato sauce, cilantro, onion, and Pepperjack cheese. The serving was HUGE and they did resemble nachos a lot more than your usual chilaquiles since there was not a ton of salsa and they were not overly spicy; kinda wish it has been a bit more but I suppose you have to appeal to the masses.  Solid meal.Menu has so much to choose from: soups, salads, egg dishes, and Columbian entrees just to name a few and that's just lunch! With so many options, you can easily go back here multiple times and never eat the same thing twice.Great find in Brooklyn - especially for those with dietary restrictions!

"Order the fritanga and some maduros. Bogota does a fabulous job labeling the menu's gluten-free and vegan items, and they fry their empanadas in canola oil. Early week visits mean Happy Hour all day. Their coconut margaritas on the rocks are my personal jam, but I've yet to go wrong alcohol-wise. The coded menu will help you out  once you're past your prime. Order another fritanga, it'll sober you up.The ribs are cooked in red wine, so order those too.The decor is on the kitschy side, but with my mouth so full of delicious meat, I barely noticed.",4.0

"So, maybe I ordered the wrong things, maybe this place is for take-out only, or the right night, or I needed to be drunker. I came here with a Colombian friend who wanted to try it based on the good reviews, although he was skeptical of any American-Colombian food. So we tried some classic dishes, the arroz con pollo, some kind of traditional soup and a few appetizers. Everything was fine, but also pretty blah. I have had the roasted chicken for take out, and it was tender and wonderful, but the arroz con pollo was dry and the rice was squishy, like it was over cooked. I would not want to wait for an hour (as you might on an average Friday here) for this food. It's a solid choice if you want some rice and beans with a protein, but I wouldn't go out of my way for this place.",3.0

My only gripes? They don't always bring you complimentary plantain chips. Seating can me uncomfortable, esp in the back. And the bathrooms could use some attention.

"We dined at Bogota Latin Bistro while in Park Slope, Brooklyn and it did not disappoint! We went in for a late lunch and there was plenty of seating. Décor is really bright and an overall fun ambiance. Oh and if you love it THAT much, you can buy a t-shirt along with a ton of other restaurant souvenirs. The menu is huge and the gluten-free (GF) options as well as vegetarian and vegan options are clearly marked which is great. But the best part? They have two dedicated GF fryers which DRASTICALLY cuts down on gluten cross-contamination - yay!Menu had a great mix of Columbian and Latin American foods. I opted for the chilaquiles and they were decent - topped with scrambled eggs, chipotle tomato sauce, cilantro, onion, and Pepperjack cheese. The serving was HUGE and they did resemble nachos a lot more than your usual chilaquiles since there was not a ton of salsa and they were not overly spicy; kinda wish it has been a bit more but I suppose you have to appeal to the masses.  Solid meal.Menu has so much to choose from: soups, salads, egg dishes, and Columbian entrees just to name a few and that's just lunch! With so many options, you can easily go back here multiple times and never eat the same thing twice.Great find in Brooklyn - especially for those with dietary restrictions! Would love to be back for dinner!",4.0

"Order the fritanga and some maduros. Bogota does a fabulous job labeling the menu's gluten-free and vegan items, and they fry their empanadas in canola oil. Early week visits mean Happy Hour all day. Their coconut margaritas on the rocks are my personal jam, but I've yet to go wrong alcohol-wise. The coded menu will help you out  once you're past your prime. Order another fritanga, it'll sober you up.The ribs are cooked in red wine, so order those too.The decor is on the kitschy side, but with my mouth so full of delicious meat, I barely noticed.",4.0
went there for a date with my husband . the guava empanadas were awesome !,5.0
"I LOVE this place. I was in the area one day so decided to go in and try it out. My boyfriend and I have since been back numerous times. Everytime I go, I try to get something different and I'm never disappointed. The service is always amazing and even when it's packed the food still comes out in a timely fashion. Their drinks are amazing and the food is to die for. I would recommend to anyone and everyone. Side note: I've had the empanadas, rice and beans, margaritas, steak, cilantro mashed potatoes, pernile, baked chicken, and Madura (not all at once obviously). It was all great!!",5.0
"So, maybe I ordered the wrong things, maybe this place is for take-out only, or the right night, or I needed to be drunker. I came here with a Colombian friend who wanted to try it based on the good reviews, although he was skeptical of any American-Colombian food. So we tried some classic dishes, the arroz con pollo, some kind of traditional soup and a few appetizers. Everything was fine, but also pretty blah. I have had the roasted chicken for take out, and it was tender and wonderful, but the arroz con pollo was dry and the rice was squishy, like it was over cooked. I would not want to wait for an hour (as you might on an average Friday here) for this food. It's a solid choice if you want some rice and beans with a protein, but I wouldn't go out of my way for this place.",3.0
"Great drinks, good food, great service! This place was surprising to our small group of 4. We went out after finals to have fun & stumbled across this place through Yelp. The empanadas & coconut shrimp are to die for. Very good, fresh food, and don't forget to have a passion fruit caipirinha!",4.0
"Consistently solid food and great drinks in a fun atmosphere. Bonus? Great lunch specials during the week.There's something for everyone on this menu, even your difficult to please ""gluten free"" friend/relative/date. My absolute favourite? Arroz con Pollo. It is the epitome of comfort food. The Skirt Steak with chimichurri sauce (get the cilantro mashed potatoes!) is also very good. Make sure to save room for a guava & cheese filled empanada to finish. My only gripes? They don't always bring you complimentary plantain chips. Seating can me uncomfortable, esp in the back. And the bathrooms could use some attention. (yes, I ascribe to judging a kitchens cleanliness based on the cleanliness of their bathrooms)",3.0
"This place is great! Food is very tasty, decor is very inviting and comfortable. The drinks are very good. The portions are generous and prices are reasonable.

"Challenged myself to go here without the ex and was not disappointed.  From drinks to food to dessert, everything was top notch.Went with CG and BP and we all got garlic shrimp.  Excellent choice!  Rice, tostones, beans...everything was superb.  Drinks were also great.Dessert, we had churros and bread pudding.  The banana caramel bread pudding was phenomenal.  This is a must have (Jorge, I'm looking at you!)  Our waiter said it tasted better than his abuela's bread pudding.  That was high praise.  This place is worth the wait!  And I was able to make this place my own again.  It is no longer haunted by the ghosts of my past (okay, maybe it's still a little haunted but I'm making progress)",4.0
"Warning: this place is festive and LOUD! Just don't go there and expect a quiet, cordial family dinner. With that said, DO bring your rowdy friends and get ready for the whole shabang.Most places serve corn chips and salsa, but that's quite the bore nowadays. Here, they've got plantain chips!! And they're SUPER addicting. It came with a sort of ""salsa"" dip, but their plantain chips are already delicious on their own! Beware, that's probably where a LOT of your calories for the night is going to come from. It's hard to stop eating once you  start. Then, we started with the empanada appetizers. It comes with 4 empanadas that you can choose from and 4 different sauces for you to dip in. Just FYI, the empanadas are pretty small, so if it's tough to share amongst more than 4 people. In fact, my group had that problem, so each of us barely had ONE bite of every empanada. Too much dough and not enough filling though. The entree came around, I don't remember being dissatisfied with a single item. And I CERTAINLY went around tried all my friends' foods! But it's not like I'd rave about it. I do recommend the bistec encebollado and fish tacos. Portion size wasn't huge, but you'll be satiated. Their churro dessert was YUM! It's even better with their chocolate dip, although I don't think it's really worth it, since it comes with just 4 churros, each only 3 inches long. Do NOT, I repeat, do NOT get the Caipirinha. It is super STRONG and tasteless! They don't do a very good job at making it here. Instead, get their mojitos.Overall, more like a 3.5 stars out of 5. I wouldn't say it's really a 4, and considering how many great reviews they have, they wouldn't die having a 3 in one review. Portion size was always SO small compared to the prices, so my inner fat lady wasn't too excited about that.",3.0
I been to this place 3 times and love it... This last time I had the baked garlic half chicken and it was soooo tasty.  There drinks are really great as well.. The last time I had the frozen mango margarita and this time I had the frozen mojito and it wasnt bad but I def prefer the frozen margarita bcuz its sweeter.  But this is def a great spot to go too for food n drinks :),4.0
"I started the short wait for a table with a mojito which was good, but I definitely could have gotten it elsewhere for less $$.I had the Kale Cesar Salad with tofu steak. The tofu steak was pretty bland, there didn't seem to be any seasoning on it. It looked like tofu was just tossed on the grill and plated. The salad itself was pretty enjoyable and refreshing. The dressing was quite light and barely there, which I liked and disliked (I can't make up my mind!). I liked that the taste of the kale stood out instead of being overwhelmed by dressing, but the dressing could have enhanced the flavours a little more. The amounts of croutons and parmesan on the salad was a little on the sparse side.My company had the Quinoa cakes. They were really interesting, quite delish. I'd be interested to find out how ""easy"" they would be to make at home.Overall, the dishes seemed a little overpriced for what they were. I might come back, but mostly because its in close proximity to my home.",3.0
If your in the mood for columbian food do your self the favor and come her! The food is always delicious and the drinks omg all I have to say is a pitcher of mojito the only complaint and I'm sure I'm not the only one is they really need a bigger space,5.0
"Love, love, love this place. It has a great ambiance and is a great place to come to either on a date or with a big group of people. The grilled Mexican corn is addicting.

"Seriously, people, this is just average Latin food spot with extremely overpriced food.  I've been waiting to check out Bogota bistro for awhile based on everyone's enthusiastic feedback.  There was a half hour wait on a Wednesday evening.  We ordered drinks and I had the mixed empanada appetizer.  The happy hour drinks were what redeems this place:  strong and fairly inexpensive.  The empanadas were OK, but not worth the price tag:  $16 for 4.  Maybe I am spoiled by all the Cuban-Colombian-Dominican places in Jersey that give you huge yummy empanadas for 2 bucks a pop.Ceviche appetizer was spicy hot and flavorful, but also tiny.  Yes, it comes in a glass, but the waitress didn't specify how small that glass was.  The musci was good though (lots of salsa).New Jersey (Union City - Jersey City - West New York) - I have a whole lot more appreciation for you now.",3.0

"American Pie - Bogota Bistro and Mojito Bar, BrooklynYes this is an American Pie review, which means your favourite diva is back in London and desperate to share with you my favourite US haunts. It takes a lot to put a smile on this diva's face first thing on a cold New York Sunday and Bogota's Latin Bistro is one of them.  This lively hangout more than deserves its self anointed tag as a 'celebration of the food and drinks of Columbia and Latin America'.The carnival began with the very festive decor of white washed walls, colourful posters and quirky ornaments, coupled with friendly serving staff who instantly made me feel warm and welcomed, just like a returning patron, instead of a first-timer. Beginning with drinks I opted for grape juice, while P opted for the Brazilan sangara...what's the difference between regular sangara and a Brazilian one? According to P, a generous dash of Cachaca, which transforms sangara into a magic portion with a donkey kick, you want to experience again and again !P and I rocked up in search of a bad arse brunch and Bogota didn't disappoint. We both had Daisy's Eggs or as I like to call it Sunshine on a plate!(Inspired by friend of Bogota Bistro, Daisy Martinez) - picture this - 2 baked eggs, Colombian chorizo, avocado, jack cheese, spicy tomato sauce & cream, served  with yucca home fries & cabbage salad. While I fully expected everything to be great and it was, I have to give a special mention to the yucca (yam to us expats!) - which has long lived in my heart as one of those 'happy to avoid' foods, courtesy of my grandma who used to boil her yam to within an inch of its starch starved life ! The cabbage salad came laced in a punchy salad dressing that complimented the rest of the meal beautifully. So what about the atmosphere ?

I'd buy those w/o ever going in for anything else there.SUPER expensive drinks. $9/glass, $40/bottle for a sangria!? Seriously!? Thing that's half water and cheap fruit, with rind!? Get real! The reason sangrias exist is BECAUSE they are super cheap, and hide the terrible $5 wine they are usually made with!",2.0

Went here two weeks ago and the food was amazing. The hostess was attentive. I have no complaints. It's not the most expensive place but our meal (table for 2) came up to 95 plus tip. They make a pretty good mojito and the location is near other bars and what not.,4.0
I always look forward to coming here. For a Latin American restaurant they have lots of vegetarian options. The vegetable tacos are my favorite. A hearty mushroom stew. Lots of creative delish egg brunch dishes. Tofu scramble worked for me too. Comes with 2 sides. I tried the grilled tofu with tomatillo sauce. It was O K but a bit bland for me. The selection of side vegetable dishes is big. I find most of them good. We always open up with a arepa with smashed avocado. The arepa's have better flavor then most ive had elsewhere. Another + they know how to make good margarita here. The service has always been good. All around fun place to eat.,4.0
"Passed by here a number of times and just thought it was another latin restaurant.  Well, I was wrong!

THIS IS ACTUALLY MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT IN BROOKLYN. Went here for like the 4th time and loved it as always. I had the wings for the appetizer (which are simply amazing) and a ginger caphrinia. Their drinks are absolutely delicious. As for the food I had a crusted salmon it was my first time ordering but I loved it as well. Everything is always very well seasoned and you can tell the chefs put a lot of thought and effort into their cooking. Everything is reasonably priced which will of course make me a repeat customer. The service though is a hit or miss but no major screw-ups and the food definitely makes you forget anyway. HAPPY EATING,5.0
Absolutely loved our visit to Bogota. We finished a show at Barclay and per many reviews of other places closer it was recommended to head a little farther down 5th. I'm glad I heeded that advice. The service was great. The drinks were amazing. The food was wonderful. The menu had so much to off it was very hard to decide.,5.0
"Probably 4.5 stars.Love this place - so lively, fun, bustling and a great change of pace from most NYC restaurants. Not fancy at all, pretty casual - decorated in a more traditional, party, spirited Latin vibe. Large space, but gets very crowded, so definitely make reservations for peak times like Friday and Saturday nights.We made reservations for 8:30 on a Saturday evening. As we were waiting a few minutes for our table to be prepared, a few parties (ranging in size from 2-6) came in and asked how long the wait would be without a reservation. The answer was 1-1.5 hours. Definitely do not come without a reservation unless you just want to hang out at the bar for a couple of hours.Our server was super friendly and patiently answered our many questions. 1. Plantain Crusted Chicken - pan-fried chicken breast with mango bbq sauce. Served with two sides and we chose the coconut rice and the gallo pinto.- Chicken Breast - great. Lightly breaded, so it wasn't as though you were eating chicken fingers. A lot of the beading fell off as you cut it, which was actually even better for me because not the biggest fan of very breaded things! But the most surprising thing was that the plantain crust was not sweet at all. I would never have known. It was nice and crunchy and mild. Good portion size.- Mango bbq sauce - not as strong of a flavor as I was expecting, but that was nice. Not too sweet even with the mango and it served as a nice compliment.- Coconut rice - made with coconut milk and raisins. This is great for someone who loves sweet rice. I generally love coconut rice, but this one was definitely sweeter than normal. But pretty unique and if you're in the mood for some sweetness, this is definitely a go to. It is apparently very popular.- Gallo pinto - sauteed black beans, white rice, cilantro, onions, and tamarind sauce. I loved this. I would absolutely order this again. Just so good and flavorful and you can't really stop eating it. 2. Grilled Chicken Breast - boneless chicken breast, black bean and corn relish, and chipotle tomato sauce. The two sides were white rice and black beans.- Chicken Breast - 2 super thin pieces (butterflied breast essentially) - thinner than I've really ever seen! Not oily, not too much flavor, but a safe and VERY healthy dish. Really can't get healthier if you are trying to watch your weight, which is generally hard to do at these restaurants! I would get it again, but definitely not if you're looking to splurge or go big.- Black bean and corn relish - not much to this, it's literally what it says and it doesn't add too much to the dish really. There isn't a lot of it, but it wasn't anything special. I think a better compliment to the dish would've been a pico de gallo to get it some more freshness. Definitely not bad, though, just nothing wow.- Chipotle tomato sauce - this was great! Love it. Not very spicy, which was a bit disappointing, but i gobbled it up. This made the dish so much more flavorful and better.- White rice - they have both white rice and yellow rice options. I asked what the difference was and was told that there is none other than the fact that the white rice has a bit of paprika and yellow food coloring. I loved his honesty! He told me to go with the white rice because it's more natural, so I did. This is just normal white rice cooked with a little bit of oil. Not too oily, just the right amount. But it is white rice after all so don't expect much flavor. It's really just a compliment to the entree and a great vehicle to eat the chipotle sauce.- Black beans - these are actually vegan. Black beans cooked with oil and spices essentially. Good and saucy.3. Colombia Fruit Shake - got the mango flavor with milk (there is an option to just do water instead). I didn't try any of this, but was told it was excellent. The server recommended it and apparently he wasn't wrong. Sweet and creamy. A great compliment to the meal. There are a bunch of other tropical fruit options as well (passion fruit, guava, guanabana, lulo, and blackberry (mora)).To try list - arroz con pollo (they have a veggie version) and the guava empanada. How unique!",4.0
"Came to Bogota on a Friday night at 8pm for dinner with a party of 7. Reservations were available on open table and we had heard good things. The place is Colombian food and the story behind the owners who stared out with 20k and a dream and now have a 4MM revenue producing restaurant is a great one. They also apparently treat and reward their staff very well. This was evident as the service was outstanding - from being seated to our waitress Joanna I was extremely impressed. Joanna was happy, friendly, knowledgeable of the menu, attentive and just plain awesome. The restaurant as I said was festive but the music was probably too loud, which made it difficult to hear people even right next to you. The food was really good and we had the following- Smokey pineapple margarita: Not good. They don't shake but instead stir. It didn't taste well mixed- Beers: They had a great selection of South American beers- Plantain Chips: Fresh and addictive- Dip Sampler: Guac, Bean and Salsa was good but nothing special- BBQ Chicken Nachos: a very tasty special and presented beautifully. Great for sharing- Fish Tacos: SO GOOD! Made with lightly fried fish these were terrific!- Pernil: Some of the better Pernil I've had. Rich with flavor and paired well with the coconut rice- Bandeja Paisa: Awesome! pork, sausage, steak, arepa, fried egg and rice and beans. Delicious-Molten chocolate cake: you can never go wrong - allow 15 minutes- Tres Leches: Too cakey but still good. I've had better- Banana caramel bread pudding: I loved this as the caramel sauce and bread pudding with a crisp outside spongy inside was delicious too me but some people in my party thought it was meh.- Churros: very tasty with hot chocolate and caramel dipping sauces and served hot. I will definitely be back as the menu is extensive. Is like to try the sangria as well as some of the non fried dishes.",4.0

"If you plan on dining out in Park Slope, I highly recommend Bogota Latin Bistro (located at Fifth Avenue and St. John's Place). I've been a loyal patron for 4 years (see my previous review from 2010), and time has not dulled or dampened my enthusiasm for this establishment. While the restaurant describes itself as ""pan-Latin"", its heart and soul is the cuisine of Colombia. As it happens, Colombian food is a great fit for me, as it is very flavorful (read: ""mouth watering""), but not too spicy. The Bistro's regular menu features a wide variety of  beef, pork, poultry, seafood and vegetarian dishes, which reflects Colombia's incredible bounty and which are authentic in every respect. Some of my favorites include Arroz con Pollo, Pernil (shredded pork), Fish Tacos, and soups like Ajiaco and Sancocho, which are a meal unto themselves.But the pièce de resistance is Bandeja Paisa, the iconic dish of Colombia, an enormous platter consisting of steak, pork chicharron, rice, beans, avocado, maduros, shredded red cabbage and a fried egg. If you plan on ordering this specialty of the house, you'd be well advised to refrain from eating for a day or two in advance, because it is A LOT of food. When I go with a friend, we usually share the platter and order some empanadas or other sides. It's a great bonding experience! LOL! In fact, after our last visit, my friend turned to me and said ""Danny, Bandeja Paisa is my favorite dish in the whole world!"" :)And as if the regular offerings weren't enough, specials appear on the menu from time to time, such as Arroz Chaufa, Pollo Sudado, and Salmon Ceviche to name but a few.Desserts include Classic Flan, Obleas, Banana Caramel Bread Pudding, Churros and my personal favorite, Tres Leches, an almond cake soaked in 3 different kinds of milk.As amazing as the food is, what really makes the Bistro a place you'll want to return to again and again is the atmosphere. The owners, George and Farid, have taken infinite pains to create a total dining experience, which includes food, music, décor and outstanding service. The staff could not be friendlier or more welcoming, from the host or hostess who escorts you to your table to the servers and busboys who are uniformly courteous and accommodating throughout the meal. By the time you leave, you'll be eagerly looking forward to your next visit.The only negatives are that it can get quite noisy on the weekends, so if you wear a hearing aid you may want to turn it down. Also, since the location is Park Slope, it is difficult to find a parking space. My suggestion is to take the subway if at all possible, get off at Barclay Center or Union Street, and walk over from there. It's only a few short blocks.Oh, and in case you're wondering about the price, I know of no other restaurant where you can have an meal of this quality for under $25 (excluding drinks). In fact, the prices are SO reasonable that I feel like I am taking advantage of them! I hope they don't catch on! :)Bogota Latin Bistro is a great place to bring friends, family, dates or hold events. In fact, of the many friends I have brought to the Bistro, no one has ever left disappointed - or hungry - and I'm willing to bet you won't either!",5.0
"We were seated in the enclosed patio area, which looked like it could use a little more maintenance . I wished it was nicer, but still it had a fun, busy, and casual atmosphere . On to the food: My friend and I ordered the empanada sampler--a must !! We got the chicken, shrimp, goat cheese and guava, and they were all amazing in their own way, and got us REALLY full . I thought this was supposed to be an appetizer, but it was a meal of its own . On top of that, we also got the fish tacos, and the watercress salad with avocado . The fish tacos was also really good, but the salad hm, could've skipped this one but it made me feel better chomping on veggies.We also ordered drinks, a little cheaper than most places (around $8 I believe) and they were strong . This could be good or bad, depending on your preference . Ha .  All of the food above and drinks came out to be $30/person before tips . Although the food was good, I am not sure if I will be coming back because the food was a little too heavy for me .",3.0

In fact, the prices are SO reasonable that I feel like I am taking advantage of them! I hope they don't catch on! :)Bogota Latin Bistro is a great place to bring friends, family, dates or hold events. In fact, of the many friends I have brought to the Bistro, no one has ever left disappointed - or hungry - and I'm willing to bet you won't either!",5.0
"We were seated in the enclosed patio area, which looked like it could use a little more maintenance . I wished it was nicer, but still it had a fun, busy, and casual atmosphere . On to the food: My friend and I ordered the empanada sampler--a must !! We got the chicken, shrimp, goat cheese and guava, and they were all amazing in their own way, and got us REALLY full . I thought this was supposed to be an appetizer, but it was a meal of its own . On top of that, we also got the fish tacos, and the watercress salad with avocado . The fish tacos was also really good, but the salad hm, could've skipped this one but it made me feel better chomping on veggies.We also ordered drinks, a little cheaper than most places (around $8 I believe) and they were strong . This could be good or bad, depending on your preference . Ha .  All of the food above and drinks came out to be $30/person before tips . Although the food was good, I am not sure if I will be coming back because the food was a little too heavy for me .",3.0
"This place is amazing.  Tonight was my first time here, and I must say the staff are friendly, welcoming, and make you feel right at home.  They are very accomodating and show the upmost hospitality to their guests.  The food was delicious and reasonably priced.  I will be going back hopefully very soon.",5.0
"When my dad used to drive me past this place I always pointed it out and said ""We should go!"" but for my dad (who is Dominican BTW) Colombian food is too foreign for him. So I decided to go after work with a friend for drinks and food. It was pretty packed and it looks like someone fudged up on the seating plan. The waiter was pretty nice and the drinks were delicious. I like how you can order something and just pay a little extra for additional toppings like a fried eggs or tostones (which I did order). I had the salmon and white rice and beans. It was sooooo good. I ate it all up. Not much different from what I've had at my parent's house but still delicious nonetheless. I want to come back. I will come back and you should too!",4.0
"This place is amazing. I literally enjoyed all the food that we ordered! First, we had these fried banana chips. I couldn't stop munching on them. For appetizers, I had the fried calamari. It was fried to perfection and tasted really good. I had chicken, beans and rice. I loved it! My friend's steak was yummy, tender and juicy. Overall, ill definitely come back again for sure",5.0
"Told my mother I was taking her to Bogota for her birthday! And we arrived here! Couldn't take her to Colombia unfortunately ! But I called to make a reservation an hr before I wanted to be seated 8:30, the hostess told me they were fully booked until 9:30 PM, which I agreed to be sat then.  I decided to take a quick look on their website and noticed they had open table available. I chose my option for 4 and saw there was 8:30 available, literally right when I hung up the phone.  I booked it for 8:30 PM and when we arrived exactly at 8:30 was sat in a matter of minutes.  Not sure why the hostess didn't see this when I called.  But definitely book through open table!  Place was pretty packed but thats a given for a Friday night.  It was a great atmosphere and our server Bianca was great.  My patacon plate was a bit salty and hard she alerted the manager and he was quick to come over and chat with me to take it off my bill which was great.  Little things like this goes a long way because it shows you care about the guest. First time here after looking up different Colombian places to take my mother to for her bday dinner. Last tip! The Coco Kiss martini was delicious!

"I go here for their Margaritas and friendly service. The waitresses are ultra nice. The Margaritas are delicious and they put puréed fruit in them, mmm. Don't get the coconut margarita its too sweet and kind of ruined by the creamy coconut slug...it's not like a pina colada. The food is good....heavy but good. Dinner and lunch are good.The Churros and dipping sauces are worth saving room for. The ribs are amazing and not fatty. I love most of the empanadas. The dip sampler is a good deal and almost like a meal, you can share it with three people and be full to satisfied. The Arroz Con Pollo could use more beans but is decent. The Bandeja Paisa is a lot of meat, I enjoyed it though.  And the Cubano sandwich is really really delicious.Brunch is not as good, they don't give you a lot of eggs, it is mainly carbs.",5.0
"Met a friend for a late lunch last week - arrived at 1:30, and had the lunch special (beef empanada and fish tacos) for $15.  Although the special comes with a fountain drink I needed a 'drink' drink.  I love a good mojito, and I like a good flavored mojito but find a lot of the flavored ones too sweet.  Our waitress suggested a coconut mojito, and it was amazing!  At happy hour prices, if it hadn't been so strong I would have ordered another one.  I would like to say that I will order a different flavor the next time I go, but I know that's a lie.  I will try other food items, as everything I had was delicious.  But that mojito....pure perfection!  The waitress' suggestions were right on the money, and she was very sweet and helpful.  I will definitely be returning to this place.",5.0
"I had been  a few times there before but the sevice this time was horrid.  Our server, Eric, took forever to take our orders, bring our drinks and bring plaintains to our table.  Another table also complained about the wait but he was better with some other tables which made us realize that the service was inconsistent.  Disappointed and will not make this my go-to meet up spot.",2.0
Came by this past Saturday for brunch. I cant get enough of this place. From the mojitos to the empanadas to the steak and eggs. All made with perfection! Only complaint I have is that I have a severe allergy to certain vegetables. I asked to not have the salad on the plate. It arrived with the salad and when I told my server of my allergy he took it to the kitchen and they basically just re-plated it.,5.0

"3.5 Stars. Solid.I've been to Bogota a few times and each time I enjoyed the food and the drinks, especially.  My favorite thing at Bogota is the Guava Mojito.  Like seriously, it's the best thing ever.  Sometimes, they even add a slice of Guava, which is a nice touch.  The Happy Hour deals are great -- from noon to 6pm (maybe even later).  I've definitely knocked down a few Guava Mojitos at 2pm on a Thursday.  I highly recommend it.The food is good.  It doesn't blow you away, but it satisfies a craving.  I've had the Bacalao (which was okay) and the Bendaja Paiso (tons of food and fairly tasty).  A friend had the Catfish Tacos, which I tasted and that was very good.  The Tres Leches Cake is... different, more dense frosting than sponge cake.  Not what I'm used to, but I had more than several bites.

"Mixed review:   I had the best waiter a girl could have, but honestly, I'm very disappointed in the quality of the food.   Not all the food though.I lived in Colombia on two different occasions, and cook colombian food frequently.  Their empanadas were flavor less, and for $5 you would think you would get a little more.  But what really shocked me was the lack of flavor that the steak (asado) had.  I got the Bandeja Paisa a favorite at most Colombian restaurants, and the portions were more than generous for this, my daughter and I shared.   However, I was disappointed because the steak was flavorless.  I tried to put ""ahi""  the colombian hot sauce and it was this watery vinegary mess that they ""bottle"" there.  Why bother bottling it because it was crap.  Anyone who has had aji know that its a little thicker, not watery of vinegary.  I added salt and kept eating.The chorizo they have is delicious, amongst the best I've had.   The batido de Mora, Delicious and the plates that kept coming out were amazing.  I think they are trying to merge too many different flavors and not really giving the best to anyone dish.  I will be back though because the garlic chicken smelled like the most amazing thing I've ever smelled.   This was my second time there and the first time was better we were there on a Tuesday early so who know if maybe there was a different cook.It was odd too that this busboy got very offended that I spoke spanish to him it just came out, its a habit I admit but it wasn't that serious. Other than that, I love love love my waiter and he'd be a great waiter anywhere .  Like I said the flavors were off, but the first time I went there it was amazing!   So I'll go back another time to enjoy something different.",3.0
"I decided to go to this restaurant based on the great reviews. However, I regret going there, especially upon seeing the abundance of other choices of restaurants in the area. Any other place could have beat this place for sure.For the rating this has on yelp, I was expecting a great time, but was not enjoyable at all. The service was terribly slow, and you would think that with the 6 or so waiters that helped us, we would've gotten what we needed at a reasonable pace. Honestly, we didn't even know who our waitress was until we saw her name on the bill.The food was okay, but I was expecting something great. The rice was so regular, and the ropa vieja was bland. My friend got the rotisserie chicken which is the only good thing I could say about the place, since it was actually not dry. Not worth it for the price. Never going back!!!",2.0
Terrible service. We were seated and completely ignored. Had to get our own water from the bar. Ended up walking out. What the hell.,1.0
I have been a loyal patron for years a loyal supporter of Bogota and the gentleman who is the host was very rude and I believe felt as though he was a bouncer and let ppl in when he the mood moved him. I will definitely miss the empanadas and ropa vieja. This is not to say that there aren't nice welcoming ppl working there but one bad apple spoils the bunch.,1.0
"Festive atmosphere with delicious food and friendly waitstaff. Great for a date or dinner with friends.

Just don't fill up on plaintain chips!",5.0
I love this restaurant! The ambiance here is just so much fun and lively. Reservations are recommended for dinner especially on the weekend because they get full quickly. This is a great place to take people if you have one or two people in a large party that have food allergies or restrictions.  I have a dairy and gluten allergy and I have another friend who is a vegetarian. We had plenty of delicious options each to pick from and the staff was extremely accommodating. For people without any diet restrictions they have plenty of delicious foods to chose from! Their drinks are great as well and a nice accompaniment to dinner.  Overall - highly recommend spot for a great dinner out with friends.,5.0
This is one of my favorite restaurants of all time. Whether it's ordering the food for delivery or eating at the restaurant it's always an amazing experience. They have so many gluten free options that I never feel limited when I go there. They also have an interesting cocktail list. Atmosphere is always fun and the staff is super nice.This should be your first stop when visiting Park Slope.,5.0

"Mixed review:   I had the best waiter a girl could have, but honestly, I'm very disappointed in the quality of the food.   Not all the food though.I lived in Colombia on two different occasions, and cook colombian food frequently.  Their empanadas were flavor less, and for $5 you would think you would get a little more.  But what really shocked me was the lack of flavor that the steak (asado) had.  I got the Bandeja Paisa a favorite at most Colombian restaurants, and the portions were more than generous for this, my daughter and I shared.   However, I was disappointed because the steak was flavorless.  I tried to put ""ahi""  the colombian hot sauce and it was this watery vinegary mess that they ""bottle"" there.  Why bother bottling it because it was crap.  Anyone who has had aji know that its a little thicker, not watery of vinegary.  I added salt and kept eating.The chorizo they have is delicious, amongst the best I've had.   The batido de Mora, Delicious and the plates that kept coming out were amazing.  I think they are trying to merge too many different flavors and not really giving the best to anyone dish.  I will be back though because the garlic chicken smelled like the most amazing thing I've ever smelled.   This was my second time there and the first time was better we were there on a Tuesday early so who know if maybe there was a different cook.It was odd too that this busboy got very offended that I spoke spanish to him it just came out, its a habit I admit but it wasn't that serious. Other than that, I love love love my waiter and he'd be a great waiter anywhere .  Like I said the flavors were off, but the first time I went there it was amazing!   So I'll go back another time to enjoy something different.",3.0
"I decided to go to this restaurant based on the great reviews. However, I regret going there, especially upon seeing the abundance of other choices of restaurants in the area. Any other place could have beat this place for sure.For the rating this has on yelp, I was expecting a great time, but was not enjoyable at all. The service was terribly slow, and you would think that with the 6 or so waiters that helped us, we would've gotten what we needed at a reasonable pace. Honestly, we didn't even know who our waitress was until we saw her name on the bill.The food was okay, but I was expecting something great. The rice was so regular, and the ropa vieja was bland. My friend got the rotisserie chicken which is the only good thing I could say about the place, since it was actually not dry. Not worth it for the price. Never going back!!!",2.0
Terrible service. We were seated and completely ignored. Had to get our own water from the bar. Ended up walking out. What the hell.,1.0
I have been a loyal patron for years a loyal supporter of Bogota and the gentleman who is the host was very rude and I believe felt as though he was a bouncer and let ppl in when he the mood moved him. I will definitely miss the empanadas and ropa vieja. This is not to say that there aren't nice welcoming ppl working there but one bad apple spoils the bunch.,1.0
"Festive atmosphere with delicious food and friendly waitstaff. Great for a date or dinner with friends. You'll probably have to wait for your table, but that's ok because you can have a delicious drink at the bar while you wait. Excellent fish tacos and ropa vieja. Just don't fill up on plaintain chips!",5.0
I love this restaurant! The ambiance here is just so much fun and lively. Reservations are recommended for dinner especially on the weekend because they get full quickly. This is a great place to take people if you have one or two people in a large party that have food allergies or restrictions.  I have a dairy and gluten allergy and I have another friend who is a vegetarian. We had plenty of delicious options each to pick from and the staff was extremely accommodating. For people without any diet restrictions they have plenty of delicious foods to chose from! Their drinks are great as well and a nice accompaniment to dinner.  Overall - highly recommend spot for a great dinner out with friends.,5.0
This is one of my favorite restaurants of all time. Whether it's ordering the food for delivery or eating at the restaurant it's always an amazing experience. They have so many gluten free options that I never feel limited when I go there. They also have an interesting cocktail list. Atmosphere is always fun and the staff is super nice.This should be your first stop when visiting Park Slope.,5.0
Love this place although the crowd is mostly yuppies and hipsters their food is awesome! Plus this has to be one of the best places to have yourself a mojito!,5.0

I called the waiter over who sent the manager over who apologized then offered me a dessert. While I appreciate the gesture, a discount on the check would've been better seeing as how I wasn't able to finish my meal after that and I don't see why he would think I would possibly want to eat anything after seeing that.I have been here a few times and the food has always been good (although the service is a bit slow) but I can safely say I will not be returning.",2.0
"First time in Brooklyn, and already I'm a fan! My fiance and I were in town for the Jay-Z concert at the recently opened Barclays Center, and had made reservations for Bogota. We're both huge fans of Latin influenced food, and upon entering I knew this was my kind of place!I like the ambiance here, it's very laid back, semi-hipsterish without going overboard. We made a relatively early reservation (6:00), and already the place was filling up, so I'd strongly advise planning ahead if you want to eat here.Before I dive into the food, let me take a moment to describe the drinks: EPIC! I started off with a Margarita on the rocks, and while it was a bit small, it was STRONG! I was already feeling a buzz after just one of these. After that, I got a Mojito, which was also strong, so by this point I was ready for the concert! My fiance ordered the Caipirinha (a rum based drink similar to mojito), and it was (you guessed it) strong as well!For our meal, we were first provided complimentary fried plantains, along with a green dipping sauce. This was very good, but I wanted something else to dip. That's when we realized a few empty tables around us had some sauces on them in bottles, so we asked for extra cups and poured them out. I recommend doing this so you can sample all the flavors they have for dips. Warning: the menu is insane! There is so much to choose from, that if you don't have some kind of idea of what you want, you may get overwhelmed. Luckily, I pretty much knew coming in that I wanted empanadas, and so of course I went with the empanada sampler dish: a combination of 4 different empanadas and a medley of dipping sauces along with them. This is a worthy selection for those empanada lovers out there, and believe me, you get your money's worth!If I ever make my way back to Brooklyn, I'll make sure to stop by Bogota again!",5.0

"Bogota is Yelpalicous and Yelpariffic! The food is delicious the service is impeciable and amibiance is great. All around Yelpatastic. Usually I make my own Latin food and normally don't go out for Latin Cuisine but thank the universe that I did that day. The menu options are so fun, that you want to try everything they have. I was smart enough to try the Platanos con Queso which we're amazing and the fish tacos which also came with two sides.

The menu is labeled for vegetarian, vegan and gluten making all available options (and there's plenty!) easy to spot.

"Very popular Park Slope eatery with a solid brunch offering. A pitcher of their wonderful Bloody Marys (complete with green olives! What do you know) started off our meal, leaving 4 tipsy ladies to gab and brunch. An empanada sampler was a no brainer. We tried the Guava with Cream Cheese and Guava Sauce, Goat Cheese with Queso Blanco and Chipotle Tomato Sauce, and Beef Picadillo. My favorites were the most unusual, the guava and goat cheese flavors definitely stand out, though the beef was a pretty classic choice. These are a good way to start soaking up some of the alcohol starting to mush up your brain during brunch...For my entrée, I selected the Daisy's Eggs a la Paloma, a skillet of baked eggs with Colombian chorizo, Jack cheese, spicy tomato sauce, crema, and pom palm salad. It was recommended by our waitress. I liked it overall, but really wish the portion was a bit more substantial. The flavors were good, but I really wanted more (especially after all the Bloody Marys). All in all, it was a pretty solid choice, though I did add an arepa to my order to fill it out a bit more. Next time I would try one of the other mouthwatering options. I'd also love to try their lunch or dinner menus too, seem to be quite popular as well :)",4.0

"I'm a New York newbie, so I never really venture into Brooklyn (still getting used to the borough I live in), but this was well worth the trip. The food was amazing, the drinks were amazing, our server was amazing (and so adorable!), and no one seemed to mind that my friends and I were having a ruckus girls' night out and were being a little louder than what's socially acceptable. Loved it!I had the fish tacos. Now, I've had fish tacos in San Diego, home of the fish taco, and I was not expecting these to be breaded, fried fish, but they were soooo good. There were three on my plate and I could not get through the third, even though I came into it starving. The rice was fluffy and the obligatory spinach I got, to make myself feel better about the fried goodness, was A-Okay.Now, they have this thing called a sangrita, which I know had to have been divinely inspired. It's sangria, with delightful refreshingness of a frozen margarita. We went through at least four pitchers, and I think we should have gone for more. There was, of course, red and white. Red was definitely my favorite: sweet, but not too sweet, and the margarita bit kicked up the sour a little, to make a perfect combination that sent you straight to the beach in your head. Honestly, I just wanted to take a pitcher for myself, stick a straw and paper umbrella in it, and call myself on vacation.Our server capped it all off with the best service I've had in New York so far. She was so cute, with her glasses, petite face, and mousy brown hair. She let us take our time ordering, since we were a larger group of women who were talking incessantly instead of looking at the menu, and made great recommendations when we were finally ready. And she even participated in our conversation, enriching our night with questions such as, ""So, what exactly is swag? And is it more about looks or charm?"" Lord, if you ask a table of 8 women that question, you'll have us talking all night. Which we did, especially aided by the aforementioned sangrita pitchers.The atmosphere of the restaurant was great: casual, but festive. I couldn't think of a better place for a girls' night, so I'm glad my friend picked it, even though it took me almost 2 hours to get home. That was okay, too; it helped the sangrita wear off and I didn't wake up with the slightest bit of a hangover.",5.0

"Excellent food, great service, reasonably priced entrees....plus all day happy hour!We went for weekend Brunch with a group of 12 ranging in ages from 14-70 and all were impressed and left stuffed...there is something for everyone on the huge menu.  The owners were attentive and our waitress provided great service.  The atmosphere is fun, lively (yet laid back) and family friendly.  I would give 4.5 stars if I could, but we were so impressed that I will lean toward 5-stars instead of 4.  The lighting was a little bright and the chairs were not the most comfortable, but those are small/nitpicky things and the food quality far outweighs a few very small negatives.  We will absolutely return to Bogota Latin Bistro soon!",5.0
I am your 900th reviewer. That is all. I came because they had 899 reviews... Damn.,5.0
Blown away by the service alone! So pleasant and helpful with everything! Food is amazingly good... so good I feel the need to hug my servers.... But I refrain,5.0
"We were hoping the Bogota Latin Bistro would be better food experience but overall it was just kind of ""meh"". The service started out bad with some confusion about who was serving us, but the waitress made up for it with a good attitude once it was resolved. The food was decent but not memorable, and not up to the quality of the places we have been to in Jackson Heights, Queens. The Bistro does serve good drinks though, and is a good place for getting together with friends to get your aguardiente fix.",3.0
"For all the people who have an is issue with gluten, a large percentage of their menu is gluten free. Had the Latin Breakfast here. The food was great. It really hit the spot. More importantly, I didn't get sick from being glutened. Thank you kitchen staff. Keep up the good work. Our waiter(Ezikiel) was awesome even with a trainee in tow. Kudos to the owner's of this establishment who seem to really understand customers who have food sensitivities & go the extra mile to cater to them. B.L.B., you have won me as a repeat customer.",4.0
"¡que rico! The menu is huge, portion sizes are good and there are many options for vegetarians. In a lot of places, vegetarians get one or two afterthought options (ugh, not another portabella sandwich or bland risotto)...but the veg dishes at Bogotá are yummy, balanced, and filling. Add the colorful and friendly atmosphere and you have a winner! The restaurant space is big for NYC so it could work great for large groups, but make a reservation because it always gets crowded.",4.0
"I've been here several times and each visit it's just okay.  I think the best part is the atmosphere.  It just has that fun bright and colorful flair.  Again, can't say anything great about food. Flavor is just okay.  Cooked okay.",2.0

"Came here after a nice morning workout at Brooklyn Boulders last Sunday. Great brunch options including many vege / pescatarian options! Everything we tried was delicious from the codfish empanadas to the avocado salad to the mango virgin mojito...a rare find nowadays. Usually dishes are hit or miss but everything we had here was good or great.Better yet, service was great! The waitress was really friendly and attentive without being overly so.Worth checking out if you're in the neighborhood for sure though I'm not sure I would journey here for the sole purpose of dining here.",4.0

"I LOVE BOGOTA.It was a total fluke that my husband and I ended up here-we grew tired of waiting at another place, so we left to go someplace else and managed to find parking right in front of Bogota, so we decided to go in.Very short wait time, a lively atmosphere from the moment we walked in, and everyone from diners to staff looked really happy. The service was impeccable, and the food was really good. Order the $15 empanada sampler; it's great for sharing and comes with 4 of your choice: we ordered the lamb, chicken, bacalao, and the guava.  The guava was hands-down my favorite. It was absolutely delicious, and could probably be enjoyed as a breakfast, lunch dinner or dessert.  Also great were the drinks, this interesting quinoa-crusted avocado salad, and the dessert.  Best of all, everything was reasonably priced, so there is no possibility of sticker shock. Oh, and the music was awesome, too, from salsa to Tejano, with a couple of 80s freestyle classics thrown in for those of us who fondly remember Judy Torres, Cover Girls, La India and TKA.It was such a great dining experience that we plan on going back really soon and bringing friends. I'm happy they're opening a second location in Park Slope this summer. I want them to do well.",5.0
"Went for brunch...Excellent food, fun, lively atmosphere, and generally authentic (with a few twists) Latin food (particularly Colombian).The bunuelos were tasty, but a bit hard on the outside for my taste. Whatever the dipping sauce was: nice.Colombian breakfast: yummy. All the components worked well together although the eggs were a tad dry.Migas de Arepa: Interesting combination, and so so so good. Definitely recommended if you want a hearty but not heavy brunch meal that's going to give you a variety of flavors.",4.0
"This place is awful! First of all, when we arrived, it looked very cheesy with all these postings on the window, you enter and it's so crammed an it's ghetto! the tables are dirty and dingy and the server was nice but we overheard staff complaining about the Awful managers, TMI- the food arrived quick so I was nervous thinking was this just sitting there or microwaved or something? My boyfriend is Columbian and he said this food was terrible! Save your money and time and check out Rocco's Tacos just a few minutes away!",1.0
I love this place for dinner but brunch was another story. There was no wait on a weekend and good brunch spots normally there's a wait. I had the pancakes and they were a little dry and flat. I like my pancakes moist and fluffy. They could also give some more fruits with the pancakes.,2.0

"Had a great birthday party at Bogota Latin Bistro on a Sunday evening. Manager Ian was really nice and walked me through reservation contract for large party 1 week prior to the party. We had chicken empanadas, water cress avocado salad, corn, plantain crusted chicken, pernil, and fish tacos. Everyone was happy with the food--delicious! Tried both red Sangria and Sangrita--nice!!Good food, awesome drinks, and exceptional service! Plus, we were seated promptly when we arrived. Initially I was a bit worried about the 2 hour party limit, but the restaurant was very understanding.Thanks Bogota Latin Bistro!!!!",4.0
Excellent food but workers not to be trusted if you happen to leave stuff behind.... Just left there forgot my sweater on back of chair they claim it was not there..

"Bogota consistently serves great food. I've visited three separate times and each visit surprised me in a good way. The ambiance/environment changes throughout the day. I went on Friday and was seated in their ""outdoors"" area even though it wasn't too packed inside yet. I've always ordered the plantain crusted chicken and I went back to it again.

"I was here 2 years ago, before I moved to the city. Every day of those 2 years that I didn't go back to Bogota, I dream about their food.

(She is.)THE FOOD!I ordered the fish tacos, my co-diner ordered the Colombian plate, I believe, and also a street corn for appetizer. The street corn has a crack-cocaine-like chipotle mayo on it, monterey jack cheese, lime juice and grilled to perfection. It's a little pricy for a $5 corn on the cob, but it's so delicious. (I learned that sauce is for sale at a the price of one corn on the cob for one bottle. SOLD!) The fish tacos were delicious, crispy, and full of flavor. That also came with a side of the crack-cocaine sauce, and that didn't hurt the tacos either. I'm salivating just thinking about it.Co-diner ordered the Colombian plate. This can easily feed 2 people. There's 2 slabs of skirt steak that's soo tender and full of marinate and flavor. I was caught off guard how delicious it was. It also came with a side of maduros (sweet plantains). OM NOM NOM NOM. There were also pork belly that was grilled. It was a large slab, my co-diner isn't a fan of the fatty pork, so I went out of my way to eat that for her. (jk, it was glorious) There were also a few other things on this plate, but I had to pack it togo so I can enjoy it the next day).A day later, it was still awesome. Nom.

The Ropa Vieja was also superb - shredded beef served in a tomato wine sauce with capers and olives. The entrees all come with a choice of two sides.And on top of all of this great food, the service is fantastic.

"Dropped by this place before going to a Nets game. Sat at the bar with a few coworkers, and the service was very attentive. (maybe because we were sitting right in front of them). Got a Sangrita and cilantro mashed potatoes. My friends weren't kidding, after one Sangrita, I was feeling a bit light-hearted and I don't consider myself a lightweight. The mashed potatoes were amazing, (I wasn't too hungry). After, we walked on over to the Barclay center, which was in walking distance (even in cold weather).

"Let me premise, I really enjoy their food and normally eat in the restaurant.   Today was my first experience with take out.  The waitress was very pleasant.  I ordered the vegetarian platter, which was good as it always is.  I won't order tostones again, they were a little over cooked and don't do well with take out.The only major bummer was the order mishap.  I ordered a goat cheese empanada (I am a vegetarian) and when I got home found they had put a beef empanada in my order.  I want to give them a four, but unfortunately I now have to throw away food and that is kind of upsetting.",2.0
"Despite the rave reviews, I thought this place was average at best. I always try ropa vieja at any latin restaurant I go to.

"My dad was going out of town and I would to have a fun dinner with him before he left so I brought him here to Bogota. We were given a table right away and both the hostess and server were excellent. They were attentive and took the time to explain the menu and or answer whatever questions we had. All our dishes came out in a timely fashion and the portions were plenty for two. We had the empanadas sampler which you can't go wrong with, you get to try as many as four different kinds. After that we had the coconut shrimp and the barbecue ribs. Both were delicious. The shrimp was nice and cisp. The ribs were juicy and succulent. Over all it was a lovely dinner experience and I would definitely come back.",5.0
I've come here several times and haven't had a bad experience. Had a dinner party here once for a friend and they were very accommodating. The fish tacos are amazing! The mojitos here are very strong and delicious! Highly recommended!,5.0

"A group of 7 of us had a great brunch here on a Saturday. Two of my friends had come here before and loved it. It didn't pick up until closer to noon which was surprising because the good was so delicious! We had a mix of sweet and savory dishes, all of which were very flavorful and excellent. The staff were very attentive as well and the decor was pretty cool. Would definitely recommend this spot!",4.0
"Dropped by this place before going to a Nets game. Sat at the bar with a few coworkers, and the service was very attentive. (maybe because we were sitting right in front of them). Got a Sangrita and cilantro mashed potatoes. My friends weren't kidding, after one Sangrita, I was feeling a bit light-hearted and I don't consider myself a lightweight. The mashed potatoes were amazing, (I wasn't too hungry). After, we walked on over to the Barclay center, which was in walking distance (even in cold weather). I want to try this place when I'm hungry!",4.0
"Let me premise, I really enjoy their food and normally eat in the restaurant.   Today was my first experience with take out.  The waitress was very pleasant.  I ordered the vegetarian platter, which was good as it always is.  I won't order tostones again, they were a little over cooked and don't do well with take out.The only major bummer was the order mishap.  I ordered a goat cheese empanada (I am a vegetarian) and when I got home found they had put a beef empanada in my order.  I want to give them a four, but unfortunately I now have to throw away food and that is kind of upsetting.",2.0

"This is my second time at bogota and I am never disappointed. The food is so delicious and packed with flavor. I went last night with my boyfriend, and we both enjoyed our meals and drinks... I had the coconut mussels for my appetizer and OMG it was amazing...seriously that good. The empanadas were good as well. For my entree I had the fish tacos, which our waitress told me were catfish.. so moist, flavorful and a very hefty portion including the sides. The beer selection is definitely worth mentioning... I had a beer from Columbia and it was very good. Love this place !! Good food, nice staff...",5.0
"This place had the perfect personality. Right when you walk in the door the staff was super friendly and attentive. No issues at all with my open table reservation. The host sat us in the far back room which was am entirely different world. Dimly lit, but huge mural and plants surrounded us. The side stations were very clean which is a huge plus. The host asked if it was my first time, which it was, and he began to give me an understand of the menu. Went over (briefly, yet thoroughly) the menu as if I was a vegan, vegetarian, or meat lover. Happy hour drinks are well priced and there is no absence of spirit. The waiter gave us plenty of time to look over the delicious menu. I had the rotisserie chicken and it was AWESOME! I got the coconut rice with the spinach. The spinach was perfectly cooked and not soggy at all. However, the coconut rice was so tasty! Perfectly look and came with raisins. It wasn't too strong at all. The chicken was extremely tender and juicy and slid right off the bone. The waiter didn't rush us to finish our meal. He was perfect - didn't come to the table too much but made sure our needs were met. I would highly recommend this restaurant. And a side - they played awesome music!!",5.0
I discovered this lovely place via Yelp and filtering for the highest rated restaurant in Park Slope. I wasn't let down. Bravo Bogota Latin Bistro. You guys get IT. Customer Service was incredible. Food was equally incredible. We split the Colombian Platter along with two empanadas. Stick with the chicken empanada it was superior to the steak empanada. We will be back to explore the remainder of the menu. Well done.,5.0

Its not overpriced either, which makes it all the more desirable.Its also got great ambiance. I highly recommend for a fun first date.",4.0
Love this place. Tried the pernil this time and it was amazing. Also had bites of the arepas which were really good... very tasty drinks as well. Wonderful host and server. Can't wait to go back. Check in on Yelp for free shots of Aquadiente (sort of tastes like licorice).,5.0
This is the first Colombian restaurant I've been to outside of Queens that I've actually enjoyed.  Food is delicious and plentiful and the drinks are tasty and strong.  I'm not usually a fan of flavored drinks but the coconut mojito is absolutely amazing!  Looking forward to bringing my Colombian parents here and that's saying a lot.,5.0

"Bogota has pretty good food but it's not as authentic as other colombian restaurants. They cater to the neighborhood but hey that isn't a bad thing. I almost always get the bandeja which never disappoints.  I've tried every kind of empanada and they are all very good, especially the goat cheese empanada. Their sangritas are normally always delicious, but the last time i went the machine was broken so they made it in the blender and i was disappointed plus it was cinco de mayo so you would have thought they would have been prepared, but hey it happens. The regular flan is not that great but the coconut flan is very good.",4.0

Super strong, but well made.They served us some plantain chips first. The table had two sauces, and I fell in love with the green tangy sweet sauce. Then, we had with the empanada sampler. The empanadas were a little dry to my tongue. I tried the beef one. It did come with sauces, and that made it super tasty. I shared the paella with my friend. Such flavorful rice and well made shrimp and muscles. It also had chicken and some small sausages. Soo good! Highly recommend this place for small or big groups.",5.0

THEN turns out they have happy hour Mon-Wed ALL night. THEN, the food came. The variety of sides were incredible, we went with the red cabbage coconut salad, coconut rice, sautéed Kale with the main courses of Rotisserie chicken and plantain encrusted chicken- along with various flavorful sauces. The service, atmosphere, food, drinks all were incredible. This was one of the best meals I have ever had. I will go back here for dates and big group occasions, no doubt.",5.0
"Bogotá Latin Bistro is a great place for good Food, Drinks and Good atmosphere. I have visited Bogotá Bistro many times, this place is good when your hungry and want something good to eat or simply come in and have some good drinks. The place is always packed, on weekends you will always have to wait 1 hour or more, in order to get a table. You are always Greeted by friendly staff as soon as you walk in. You can order drinks or Appetizers while you wait. The Drinks at Bogotá Bistro are excellent, always tasty with a good selection on Mojitos, Sangria and other Tropical Drinks, which i love. I always order the same while i am here, either the empanada sampler or Their ""Bandeja paisa"", both very good, but i must admit i have had better and more authentic Colombian food in other smaller Colombian restaurants in Queens. Their Prices in my opinion are not cheap, considering that i have been to other ""Colombian"" restaurants with the same or better Colombian food, but regardless of food comparison, the combination of everything that this restaurants offers, such as the Atmosphere and good drinks is what makes this restaurant different and better then any other Colombian restaurant that i have been to. One thing that this restaurant has that no other restaurant has ever had (in my opinion) is their ""Hot Sauce""... Wow! Their hot sauce is no joke! The best hot sauce ever! Each table is setup with a bottle of their unique Hot Sauce, and served with  complimentary Plantain chips. I pour their amazing Hot sauce on everything. I even Pour their sauce in a small sauce cup and drink straight like shots lol. They offer the option to purchase Bottles of their amazing hot sauce for about $5 per bottle,  but I am always too cheap to buy one lol.The staff is always friendly and attentive, Food, Drinks, Music, atmosphere is always good. I recommend.",4.0

"Came here last night with my sister and her boyfriend; the three of us are Colombian so this place was in for a tough review from the experts. We didn't have reservations so just walked in and asked for a table... the wait time was 40 minutes. The place was packed.We finally got seated in their cool, little festive patio in the back and the waitress kindly apologized for the wait time at the door, we told her we didn't care; we were hungry and ready to rate the authenticity of the food.We ordered the steak corn empanadas and one guava one because we thought it sounded interesting and waned to try it. it did not disappoint, I wish we would've ordered more; just make sure you dip it in the guava sauce it comes with, delicious.As the main course I had the Arroz con Pollo which was great; the flavor sort of reminded me of Lechona which is another tasty colombian dish (hard to find in NYC). My sister and her boyfriend had the Bandeja Paisa, they loved it. I tried a little bit and it was def good.Since we had already pigged out the entire day we decided to get dessert and I'm glad we did. We had the Molten Chocolate cake with ice cream and the Tres Leches. They were both amazing, I was really full and could barely have piece but it was so amazing I just couldn't just leave it there... I knew I would regret it in the future.So 3 Colombians approve of this place... actually I think we were the only Colombians there which was kind of different since every time I visit a Colombian restaurant in Queens is usually packed with Colombians. I do wish they would play some Colombian/spanish music. They had a mix of everything playing on the background and a part of me kept wishing they'd play vallenatos or Juanes... no big deal, I guess Brooklyn is just not ready for it.",4.0

"Definitely a fan! Food: Delicious! In the 2 months since I discovered Bogota, I've been back 3 times! The arroz con pollo is definitely delicious. We thought the empanadas were just okay but that's probably because we were comparing it to the outstanding shrimp ceviche. The drinks are also a must, the frozen mojito is delicious and is the frozen sangrita. The only menu item that was a bit ""eh"" was the chipotle salad which we felt was a bit underdressed. The menu offers a ton of variety so I can't wait to be back to try more.Service: The service is absolutely top-notch and the hostess and servers were extremely welcoming. The place does get EXTREMELY busy and on one occasion, we did have to wait some time to get our plates cleared between appetizers and entrees but that was due to the fact that the place was quite packed. Decor: The decor definitely fits the place with all the articles on the walls adding to the charm of the restaurant.  Overall: Great food, great service but try to stay away from the super busy times like Saturday 8pm.",4.0

"This is by far the worst Colombian food I've had. From the quality of the food to the prices, Bogota Latin Bistro really had me reconsidering my thoughts (good ones) on Colombian food.I'll start by saying that the service here is excellent. The host, waiter, and servers were all very friendly, attentive, and helpful. It was a great dining experience for that fact. Also, it's definitely worth highlighting that Bogota Latin Bistro is a vegan friendly and gluten-free friendly restaurant with menu items clearly labeled accordingly.Now on the other hand, empanadas are $4-5 each. Outrageous prices. We got a sampler dish for the table consisting of guava, chicken, beef, and shrimp (beef being my favorite), and I'd say they were mediocre at best.I ordered the Bandeja Paisa as a main course thinking that it'd be a fail proof option. Wrong! The pork chicharron was soggy, the steak was just OK, the beans were bland, and white white rice wasn't even seasoned as it should be! I LOVE Spanish white rice because it's usually seasoned with some kind of oil and salt, but not here.Overall, the food here felt very ""Americanized,"" and I have no plans to return. This restaurant was chosen by my vegetarian girlfriend's gluten-free friend who was visiting from out of town, and didn't seem to make a great impression on them, either.",2.0

"Loved this place. It was our first night visiting NYC and a friend took us here for dinner. One. It was more expensive than I was thinking for Colombian food in Brooklyn.Two. It was such an odd space - narrow bar area, then large room with packed tables. It was difficult to understand how big the place really was. Guess the kitchen is downstairs and the poor waiters had to scale the steps multiple times between orders.Three. I got the ""reasonably priced"" arroz con pollo. Okay, expensive, yes, but here, it was well worth the pesos. Best arroz con pollo I've had! They added a great twist to that classic.Four. The happy hour menu was excellent.

"Oh Bogota! I can't say enough good things about this place. It's the one place in my neighborhood where I can meet with friends who are vegen, gluten free, or paleo and have everyone find something they love. The food is a delight and the drinks are dangerous. The best combination in my opinion. Go there as soon as you can.

"I have to say I am the pickiest person ever and I ENJOYED my red snapper dish!  The dish came with salad, coconut rice and fried green plantains. (will opt for the sweet ones next time green were a little too hard and dry)  The food was very tasty fish seasoned to the bone and the coconut rice divine. My friend ordered the garlic chicken OMG very flavorful and a good size portion a half chicken to be correct. Kale, Black beans vegan, Coconut rice were all DELICIOUS!!! I will be back!!!

"Bogota is consistently awesome.  This mixed-bag of Nicaraguan, Caribbean, Dominican fabulousness can't be beat when it comes to amazing drinks and food.I really can't say enough good things about this place - every experience I've ever had at Bogota has been positive, even if there were small glitches along the way.  They handle big parties with ease, even when a crew of us comes rolling in to load up on meat and margaritas after football practice.  The one time that I didn't experience speedy service when it seems that our ticket got lost - I was dining with one friend - the server apologized before we even asked what was up, offered us a round of drinks on the house, and comped the extra elements of my meal that would've been upcharges.  The manager even came over and checked in.I'm a stickler for customer service.   Bogota's food, drinks, and ambience were already great on their own, but this positive experience really set the restaurant apart.",5.0

"This is by far the worst Colombian food I've had. From the quality of the food to the prices, Bogota Latin Bistro really had me reconsidering my thoughts (good ones) on Colombian food.I'll start by saying that the service here is excellent. The host, waiter, and servers were all very friendly, attentive, and helpful. It was a great dining experience for that fact. Also, it's definitely worth highlighting that Bogota Latin Bistro is a vegan friendly and gluten-free friendly restaurant with menu items clearly labeled accordingly.Now on the other hand, empanadas are $4-5 each. Outrageous prices. We got a sampler dish for the table consisting of guava, chicken, beef, and shrimp (beef being my favorite), and I'd say they were mediocre at best.I ordered the Bandeja Paisa as a main course thinking that it'd be a fail proof option. Wrong! The pork chicharron was soggy, the steak was just OK, the beans were bland, and white white rice wasn't even seasoned as it should be! I LOVE Spanish white rice because it's usually seasoned with some kind of oil and salt, but not here.Overall, the food here felt very ""Americanized,"" and I have no plans to return. This restaurant was chosen by my vegetarian girlfriend's gluten-free friend who was visiting from out of town, and didn't seem to make a great impression on them, either.",2.0

"Loved this place. It was our first night visiting NYC and a friend took us here for dinner. One. It was more expensive than I was thinking for Colombian food in Brooklyn.Two. It was such an odd space - narrow bar area, then large room with packed tables. It was difficult to understand how big the place really was. Guess the kitchen is downstairs and the poor waiters had to scale the steps multiple times between orders.Three. I got the ""reasonably priced"" arroz con pollo. Okay, expensive, yes, but here, it was well worth the pesos. Best arroz con pollo I've had! They added a great twist to that classic.Four. The happy hour menu was excellent. I can't remember the prices, but everything was tempting. I got the white wine sangria and it was delicious. The fried plantains were awesome and so was the service. No complaints about this place.

"This 5th Ave gem was just what I needed for a ladies night out. My first impression was that the place was incredibly tiny. I was pleasantly surprised as we headed to the seating area to find ample seating and even a back area, which I'm sure gives you a outside view in the summer. When I first arrived the host was so warm and welcoming I knew my friends and I made a great choice for the evening.  Once our entire party arrived we were seated immediately. I was a little nervous about a long wait at first, since I thought the place looked small and because the crowds of people kept coming as I waited for my friends. This did however comfort me, in that it confirmed that this spot most have some good things going on to have so many patrons. Upon being seated or server, Eric, came over promptly to introduce himself and get our drink orders.  Now good customer service is EXTREMELY hard to come by these days, so when I come across it I have to give a shout out.  Eric was attentive without being intrusive. He was very friendly and wonderfully accommodating as we paid with 3 cards and wanted the bill slip in a particular way. He added to what I considered a great dinning experience. The drinks were great.  Now I'm not an alcohol drinker so it's often hard to find a good frozen virgin drink,  but the frozen virgin passion fruit colada was amazing. One of my friends found her new favorite Mojito spot in this place and my other friend was sold on the margaritas. The menu offers lots of options so I was pretty happy. I already knew what I wanted to order as I was given the menu while I waited for my friends to arrive.  I ordered the plaintain encrusted chicken with mashed potatoes and spinach. The portion size was perfect: not too much, not too little. I was pretty hungry but wanted to get straight to a main course option so I didn't order an appetizer. The complimentary plaintain chips were enough to hold me over until my meal apprived. I thought the chicken would have been sweet but it wasn't.  The plaintain was crunchy and more on the green side than the sweet I was hoping for. Still, the food was good.I would definitely visit again.",5.0

PERFECT!  Frozen margarita, please!  Outside of the strawberry chunks that kept clogging my straw, it was pretty good. I ordered the plantain crusted chicken, with red cabbage salad and sautéed spinach on the side.  My sides were soooooo good!  I demolished them before I even touched the chicken.  The chicken was just ok.

"3 stars is being generous. The third star is solely for their extensive variety of vegan/vegetarian and gluten free menu options. I was eating a big meat eater, a lactose-intolerant friend, a gluten-free friend, and I'm a vegetarian. This place was chosen specifically to accommodate all of our needs. Its not easy to find a place where we could all eat easily. Latin cuisine in general has a reputation of being particularly unfriendly to special diets, so that also makes Bogota even more attractive. The decor and atmosphere he was a bit cheesy and made it seem like the Latin equivalent to Olive Garden or Chili's. The food likewise was highly Americanized. I did appreciate the free plantain chips and Aji sauce. Aji is a peppery vinegar sauce. I wouldn't say it packs much heat, it more has the flavor of the pepper infused into the vinegar. The drinks were very typical tropical vacation drinks like strawberry daiquiris, pina coladas, and flavored margaritas. I don't think anyone was too ""happy"" about the ""Happy Hour"" prices. They seemed like average restaurant prices. We started out with the Empanada sampler. $4-$5 per empanada seemed a bit outrageous. They were pretty average. I'll definitely be sticking to the far superior (and only $1-$2 versions at Mama's Empanadas in Queens) I got the Quinoa Cakes. The portion was small but they were reasonably good. You get two sides with the meal so I got the mashed potatoes and the mixed ricen'beans. I enjoyed both but left the restaurant still very hungry. Brian gave me his sweet plantains which were good but nothing special. Brian grew up on legit Colombian in Queens and hated their  version of the signature dish, Bandeja Paisa. The meat wasn't great quality and poorly prepared. The rice and beans were bland. Several review mention a line. We had reservations, but on 7pm on a Wednesday it wasn't too packed and definitely no line as we came or went.",3.0

"I'm on the fence about this place. I think the atmosphere is great its always packed and it's just a fun time. But, I don't love the food. I have eaten here more than once just to give it a second chance. However, I do enjoy the quinoa salad which I great but, if you ask me a little bit over priced. The food isn't bad, just not great. I don't drink so I can't judge them and also think I would enjoy it more if I did. I tried the arroz con pollo. I was disappointed I felt like it was just lacking flavor. I also had the chicken empanadas and try were also just dried and boring. My friend had the ropa de vieja and she also said the it was disappointing. If I got back I will try a drink and another dish.",3.0
"This place is amazing. It gets packed so make a reservation, even on weekdays. Checkin on Yelp to get a free shot of some Self destroying Colombian liquor. Drinks are incredible, everything from the red and white sangria to fruit mojitos, Lulo being my favorite to sangritas. The food is to die for. Get the arepa sampler. Goat cheese, guava. Can't say enough good things about the fish tacos. On the down side, the prices have been steadily going up with park slope rent skyrocketing over the past few years. So its understandable. Love this Place. Looking forward to my next visit.",5.0
"Omg!! I came here on Saturday with my fiance and we are definitely coming back. First of all, the staff is very friendly, the appetizer was beyond amazing (stuffed plantain) best appetizer ever!

"Went and had dinner there with 2 friends a few days ago. The food is incredible. My parents are Colombian so I have very high standards. The arepas with guac, the guava and cheese empanada, and the tofu steak with any the salads are some of my favorites.  The mojito and the sangrita (half margarita/half sangria) are so delicious!

"Brazilian Sangria - AMAZING. It's muddled with fresh strawberries and lime, and red wine.. and probably something else that I can't exactly pinpoint, but it goes down smooth and tasty and it gets you buzzed! (And I have a pretty good alcohol tolerance, trust me.)I came here randomly on a Monday afternoon with my best friend after having an absolutely hellish weekend and an even worse Monday. The ambiance is cozy, one of the staff members talked to us about the garden they have outside, which I'm sure is lovely during the summer. Anyway, we decided on chicken and steak empanadas, and Bandeja Paisa - a platter of yellow rice, beans (simmered with chorizo, yummy), avocado, cabbage, skirt steak, chicharron, a fried egg, and arepa. Our dinner came out before our apps, but we stuck with the apps anyway.. I'm a real sucka for a good empanada. The food though, was DELICIOUS. The steak was well seasoned and juicy, the rice with the beans and the fried egg (which had a runny middle) worked so well together. It was really good comfort food. The empanadas came out shortly afterwards.. They have more of a curry feel to me because of the potato that's in them, and we both decided that the chicken was better than the steak. Still good though.We'll be adding this restaurant into our rotation, for sure.",4.0

"I lived in the area for awhile before trying Bogota because I assumed it wouldn't have many veggie options. But I was so wrong - this place is a vegetarian's paradise! My favorites are the dip sampler, chipotle salad, grilled corn, goat cheese empanadas, quinoa cakes, tofu steak, and quinoa pilaf. In other words, everything I've ever had here, but especially the dips. I've only been once for brunch and the Colombian breakfast was damn good. The bloody mary was a little disappointing though. Next time I'll know to stick with their mojitos.Best of all, everyone who works at Bogota is so friendly and unpretentious in a really refreshing way. It has a nice atmosphere with lots of space and a cute greenhouse-type area in the back. Also, delivery from Seamless consistently arrives sooner than the estimated time. The $20 delivery minimum means my roommates are getting sick of hearing ""want to get Bogota again tonight?""",5.0
"I came to Bogota for a friend's birthday brunch this past Sunday and had a great time. I ordered the Migas De Arepa.. delicious! Scrambled eggs mixed with white arepa, colombian chorizo, scallion & tomato, served with chunky avocado salad, tostones & garlic sauce. They give huge chunks of chorizo and a generous portion of avocado salad (boy do I love those avocados!).. Alongside this, I also had the Avocado & Watercress Salad - red onion, tomato, cucumber, root vegetable strips, garlic dressing.. loved every crunchy bite from the fresh watercress. Wash this all down with a glass of mango juice and you've got yourself a brunch alright.I'd definitely come back.. especially with these cheap prices!",3.0

"Cute little restaurant in the heart of Park Slope. It almost has the feel of a Tortilla Flats, a few steps above a dive bar and with REALLY good food.

The drink menu is too large to even list, but I love that you can get fruit combinations, like strawberry pina coladas! The staff was friendly, though service was a tad slow (even when the restaurant wasn't 100% full).  But I'll be back...hopefully soon!",4.0

"Went here with my boyfriend for Valentine's day. I am so impressed with Bogotá. We drove out from Long Island, and I am so thankful that I stumbled upon this place. The food was amazing and priced well. I had plátanos rellenos, pernil, and a fruit salad. The plátanos rellenos was so flavorful and cooked perfectly. I've never had a plátanos maduros dish with chicken inside, but I was very pleasantly surprised at how well the crispness of the chicken paired with the soft, sweetness of the plátanos! Very impressive. I also loved the pernil. It was very soft and tender and the mojo it was served with was excellent! The dish also came with patacones and frijoles rojos which were both delicious. They also have Imperial here, a Costa Rican beer that is so yummy! After dinner, I spoke to the manager and he was so friendly to my boyfriend and I. Bogotá is an excitingly well-run establishment and I am lookin forward to visiting again soon! Bravo!",5.0
"What a delicious meal!Tried a little bit of everything. Empanadas, arepas, Guoc and Chips, and quesedillas. I was so full afterwards I could barely move. Staff was very nice and accommodating. Also very knowledgeable of the menu. I'm not a drinker but I tasted the frozen mojito and even that was delicious. Can't wait to go back!",5.0
"I heard how popular this place is and how crowded it gets, especially during dinner time on the weekends. I went one evening and boy, was it packed! The place gives off a very bright, colorful, and festive vibe. The plantain chips are delicious! The frozen passion fruit margarita is delicious! The chicken wings are delicious! Ahhh, everything is delicious. The staff is super friendly. I just wish their red folding chairs were more comfortable.",5.0
"Brazilian Sangria - AMAZING. It's muddled with fresh strawberries and lime, and red wine.. and probably something else that I can't exactly pinpoint, but it goes down smooth and tasty and it gets you buzzed! (And I have a pretty good alcohol tolerance, trust me.)I came here randomly on a Monday afternoon with my best friend after having an absolutely hellish weekend and an even worse Monday. The ambiance is cozy, one of the staff members talked to us about the garden they have outside, which I'm sure is lovely during the summer. Anyway, we decided on chicken and steak empanadas, and Bandeja Paisa - a platter of yellow rice, beans (simmered with chorizo, yummy), avocado, cabbage, skirt steak, chicharron, a fried egg, and arepa. Our dinner came out before our apps, but we stuck with the apps anyway.. I'm a real sucka for a good empanada. The food though, was DELICIOUS. The steak was well seasoned and juicy, the rice with the beans and the fried egg (which had a runny middle) worked so well together. It was really good comfort food. The empanadas came out shortly afterwards.. They have more of a curry feel to me because of the potato that's in them, and we both decided that the chicken was better than the steak. Still good though.We'll be adding this restaurant into our rotation, for sure.",4.0
"The atmosphere was very up beat. I had the pernil that was very tender. The mojito was a little watered down. I have only been here once but, will return again.",3.0
"I lived in the area for awhile before trying Bogota because I assumed it wouldn't have many veggie options. But I was so wrong - this place is a vegetarian's paradise! My favorites are the dip sampler, chipotle salad, grilled corn, goat cheese empanadas, quinoa cakes, tofu steak, and quinoa pilaf. In other words, everything I've ever had here, but especially the dips. I've only been once for brunch and the Colombian breakfast was damn good. The bloody mary was a little disappointing though. Next time I'll know to stick with their mojitos.Best of all, everyone who works at Bogota is so friendly and unpretentious in a really refreshing way. It has a nice atmosphere with lots of space and a cute greenhouse-type area in the back. Also, delivery from Seamless consistently arrives sooner than the estimated time. The $20 delivery minimum means my roommates are getting sick of hearing ""want to get Bogota again tonight?""",5.0
"I came to Bogota for a friend's birthday brunch this past Sunday and had a great time. I ordered the Migas De Arepa.. delicious! Scrambled eggs mixed with white arepa, colombian chorizo, scallion & tomato, served with chunky avocado salad, tostones & garlic sauce. They give huge chunks of chorizo and a generous portion of avocado salad (boy do I love those avocados!).. Alongside this, I also had the Avocado & Watercress Salad - red onion, tomato, cucumber, root vegetable strips, garlic dressing.. loved every crunchy bite from the fresh watercress. Wash this all down with a glass of mango juice and you've got yourself a brunch alright.I'd definitely come back.. especially with these cheap prices!",3.0
"Really enjoyed our recent trip to Bogota Latin Bistro. Went with a larger (6) group of ladies for brunch and they sat us in the back garden and let us chat all afternoon. Loved the happy hour margaritas that go for... all day?!And I split the Bandeja Paisa (Colombian Platter), which had grilled skirt steak, pork chicharron, a white arepa, rice & beans, fried egg, maduros, avocado, and cabbage salad. DELICIOUS. Really loved the chicharron, the steak was nicely cooked, and the fried egg was perfect to eat with the steak. Would happily go back.",4.0
"Cute little restaurant in the heart of Park Slope. It almost has the feel of a Tortilla Flats, a few steps above a dive bar and with REALLY good food. I highly recommend the Garlic Shrimp...they're on the expensive side, but cooked to perfection. With a side of rice, you can't beat it. The drink menu is too large to even list, but I love that you can get fruit combinations, like strawberry pina coladas! The staff was friendly, though service was a tad slow (even when the restaurant wasn't 100% full).  But I'll be back...hopefully soon!",4.0
Really delicious and inexpensive Latin food. They have a huge variety and cater to vegetarians as well. I've been there a few times and would have to say that the pork dishes are by far my favorite. The ropa vieja is really nice too.Always packed so be prepared to wait.,4.0
"Went here with my boyfriend for Valentine's day. I am so impressed with Bogotá. We drove out from Long Island, and I am so thankful that I stumbled upon this place. The food was amazing and priced well. I had plátanos rellenos, pernil, and a fruit salad. The plátanos rellenos was so flavorful and cooked perfectly. I've never had a plátanos maduros dish with chicken inside, but I was very pleasantly surprised at how well the crispness of the chicken paired with the soft, sweetness of the plátanos! Very impressive. I also loved the pernil. It was very soft and tender and the mojo it was served with was excellent! The dish also came with patacones and frijoles rojos which were both delicious.

"I've eaten at this place countless times for the last 5 years. I've tried several different dishes as well as their empanadas, which WERE my favorite.

I guess they aren't night owls like the rest of us...We walk a block up to 5th Avenue and luckily, Bogota was still open and serving food and having a happy hour until 11pm! Score!

Do ask the waitstaff about items not on the menu!I had the shrimp ceviche ($10), with a bacalao empanada ($6) and a side of sauteed kale. The ceviche was good with generous serving of shrimp. The empanada wasn't fried but baked and the salted cod was delicious!One friend had the tortilla soup and another friend had catfish taco. They both said the food was extremely tasty and filling!For the holidays, they have a X-mas tree up and also an electric train running underneath.

The plantain chips were great, and the also offer them to take some home in cute brown bags (Not sure if you can find them in local stores). The dip offered guacamole, black bean, and pico de gallo--all of which were great and actually filled me up a bit too much before my lunch arrived (amateur move).

It ended up being too much food, but my eyes were too big for my stomach and in the end the leftovers heated up well for a great dinner the next day.  I had the steak and chick empanada and I tried the two different types of arepas, there is a sweet corn one and a white corn one.

The sweet corn arepa, Arepa de Chocolo,  was my favorite and I'm pretty sure I'd be fine to eat this every day for quite some time. I highly recommend it as an appetizer to any meal you decide on and if you're able to keep yourself from filling up on chips and dip.

He did not hover nor did he push us. It was happy hour at 2p...Score! Drinks were great. The guac was tasty but a little too heavy on the onions. Everyone else did not mind. I got the plaintain stuffed fresh toast. Delicious. Others in my group also ordered breakfast dishes and everyone thoroughly enjoyed their choices.

(wht rice and roasted chicken) It took them nearly a bit over an hour to get my food delivered. The manager is the worse he did not want to accept the delay and mess up on my order. He in no way wanted to accommodate me as the paying customer. Will not recommend anyone to eat here.",1.0
"i have to rereview this place, because i started going so often! LOLthe columbian platter is great! pork, chicken, sausage, rice..oh my! the portion is enough to feed a small family! the sweet plantains are perfect! and the beans on the side! omg yum!!!!! my skirt steak was prepared perfectly and the flavor that came with it i will salivate over for a while. and again, i love the empanadas!",4.0

"YUM.  Their fish tacos are the absolute best.    And their coconut mojitos are out of this world.   The sancocho is also really good, though one time we ordered it for delivery and it was too salty :-/. Super friendly staff and they give wikki sticks to kids (or adults indulging their inner child).  The only reason it's not five stars is the noise level is really high, especially when sitting by the bus tub on the back patio.  That being said, Bogota is my favorite restaurant in BK and I bring all my out of town guests here.",4.0

"Love this place.  Authentic, delicious, and lively atmosphere.  I would like to highlight the cilantro mash potatoes.. they're friggin' awesome.  But then again, so is pretty much everything they offer.  The only reason that I am not giving this incredible place a 5 star rating, is that it can take a while to get a seat (for example, on my girlfriend's birthday, it took over an hour to get a table, even though we already had reservations).  At any rate, if you haven't been here before, definitely give it a shot, you're unlikely to be disappointed.",4.0

"Who knew that Bogota had so much gluten-free food? With 80% of their menu labeled gluten free- including a selection of empanadas, I was excited about this place before food has hit my mouth. My table of three shared an empanada sampler (the gluten free steak was delicious but my dinner partners especially enjoyed the guava and goat cheese ones - which are not GF), fried yuca, and the chorizo appetizer. Everything was delicious and reasonably priced!With their great happy hour deals all week long, I'm sure to be back!",5.0

"We got here before it got crazy, so kudos to us for being so smart. We were missing a member but that was not a problem. We were seated promptly by a friendly hostess.In my experience, big groups are annoying and slow. Everyone wants to chat and forget that they need to review the menu and make a decision at some point. We were no exception. Our server was patient, friendly and knowledgeable. He did not hover nor did he push us. It was happy hour at 2p...Score! Drinks were great. The guac was tasty but a little too heavy on the onions. Everyone else did not mind. I got the plaintain stuffed fresh toast. Delicious. Others in my group also ordered breakfast dishes and everyone thoroughly enjoyed their choices. We definitely want to come back to try the non-breakfast items. As we were leaving, we saw a lot of people waiting. This was odd as there were so many open tables in the area we were seated at. Regardless, we had a great time the service was excellent!",4.0

Food came out in due time, portions were fiting for the price and the desserts were out of this world. I HIGHLY recommend the churros.Furthermore, incredibly impressed with the service! Normally I'm annoyed with having a few different servers but it worked at Bogota. Everyone was friendly and kept checking on us to make sure that we had a good meal. Christian, one of the waiters, was exceptionally friendly and accomodating and the manager, Omar (?), was also hospitable and made his rounds to ensure we were all enjoying our meal.Bartender last night was also stellar!

"Definitely make a reservation. Even though the place is relatively large and we went on a Monday night, it was packed. We got there a few minutes before our reservation and had to wait for a few minutes before we got a table. The hostess was friendly and offered to let us order drinks while we waited.We were sat quickly though and soon started on our voyage of delicious food. We had the patacon with guacamole and fried calamari to start. Both are large servings and both are delicious. The guacamole was amazingly fresh and the chipotle sauce for the calamari was the bomb.Although the menu explicitly says no alterations and only a paella with meat is listed, they happily made a seafood paella for my wife (and kept cheese on the side of the patacon dish for my sake).I had the skirt steak with cilantro mashed potatoes and gallo pinto rice and beans. Everything was so tasty and the portions were a very hearty size. Their aji sauce is so good and they sell bottles of their sauces. I could barely eat any of my main dish because I had to save room for dessert. My wife and I were only able to split a flan, but we were glad we tried it.They have all day happy hour on certain days - I had a few pine coladas - my only regret is that I could not drink them faster because they were so cold!Our server was great.

Went here with a big group for a friend's birthday. The food was great and the portions were really big. We ordered a few pitchers of margaritas to start and the jalapeno margarita was the spiciest jalapeno cocktail I've had so far. It was my favorite over the passion fruit and chipotle pineapple. I would definitely recommend the empanadas to start and share. The complementary platano chips are addictive. For the main course I ordered the Panko crusted catfish and finished every last bite.

"I rarely ever venture into Brooklyn, but I would return to Bogota for the maduros (fried sweet plantains) and sangritas (sangria and frozen margarita) alone.

Bogota sells their sauces by the bottle, but I wasn't wowed by the flavors.The vegetables tacos weren't very flavorful, and I was pretty disappointed by them. But the sides I chose - maduros and vegetarian black beans - were probably the highlight of my meal.As a side note, I really appreciate the fact that Bogota labels its menu items as gluten free, vegetarian, and vegan.

"Brooklyn might be the new Manhattan. I feel myself liking Brooklyn more and more now. Am I turning into a hipster? Probably not, but Brooklyn does have pretty interesting and tasty restaurants, and Bogota Latin Bistro is one of them.We came for a late lunch, after rock climbing over at Brooklyn Boulders. The interior was fab and cozy. Definitely an awesome place for some lunch and good conversation over cheap drinks and tasty food. My friends ordered the pina colada, and a passion fruit frozen margarita. Both drinks were delicious, but for me, was too sweet. For those with a sweet tooth and hates the taste of alcohol, these are the perfect drinks. I decided not to get one because I did not want to climb the walls drunk. For lunch, I ordered the Cuban Sandwich, my friends ordered the chicken and rice, and fish tacos. They also ordered sides of tostones, and this mashed up plantain thing. The Cuban Sandwich was a little on the dry side, but the chipotle dip that came with it made it taste a lot better. It would be a lot better if the pickles and cheese were spread out more evenly. Towards the end, I was just eating chunks of bread. The fries that came with the sandwich were kinda sad, unfortunately. Burnt and brown flimsy looking sticks ended up on my dish. Other than that, nothing really went wrong, except for the mashed up plantain dish. It was really bland, and my friend who is a lover of plantains, said this was one of the worst he's tasted.  On the other hand, my friends really enjoyed their dishes and scoffed theirs down in fifteen minutes. They still managed to make compliments about the food though.I would say that the food was pretty average, but at least the portions were huge, and the drinks are cheap if you go during happy hour. I would come back again for some drinks. It is also an awesome place to get some free condoms. Towards the bathroom, you will see a huge jar full of them. My friend witnessed two old men grabbing many. I see they get lucky. I grabbed 4 and gave one to each of my friends.",4.0
"The venue is a tight and stuffy spot, tables are one right after another, not a place for the clumsy or claustrophobic.  Decor and atmosphere is busy but sorted well, crowd noise is average.  Its about a 10 min. walk from the N/Q - Union stop.A friend in my party knows the manager so we were seated within a couple of mins. on a Saturday night at 10PM.  I don't think we would've been serviced as quicly had she not been there.  Service is fast and friendly and prices are very moderate.Family style dining is always best when with a large group.  We began with platanos rellenos, which are sweet plantains stuffed with chicken and crema, fried calamari and mixed empanadas.  The apps were well portioned and absolutely flavorful.  The calamari was fresh and the batter was flakey not soggy. Entrees were ropa vieja (shredded skirt steak with olives in a light tomato sauce), arroz con pollo and lobster quesadillas.  Again, all robust in flavor, great color and fresh.  The skirt steak was soft and it melted in your mouth - no lie.  The lobster was seasoned delightfully as well.  For dessert just go all out and get the sampler which gives you: tres leches, flan de coco, obleas and churros with caramel and chocolate sides.  DELISH!  All the while we had a pitcher or two of their pomegranate margarita which was hard and strong.All in all in was a nice spot with really good food and service.  Give it a try and then walk over to the Chocolate room for more sweets.",4.0
This place is my favorite spot in park slope. It's perfect for any occasion and the drinks are delicious and extremely affordable. The fish tacos and dip sampler make any trip here worthwhile. I also had a special once that was mango jalapeño chicken wings that were both spicy and TO DIE FOR. I will continue to come here again an again because I am never let down!,5.0
"Stopped in on a very snowy night, new to the neighborhood, and everyone from the bar staff, to the waitress, to the owner who greeted me on the way out could not have been more hospitable.  And the food was flawless.  The flank steak and fried pork belly with black beans, fried egg, and platones was exactly what the evening called for (diets are for warmer evenings. :)  Will be back again and again.",5.0
"I visited Bogota Latin Bistro when I went to Brooklyn/Park Slope over the holidays, and it is a delicious neighborhood brunch spot - very festive and fun inside. I can't say that I've ever had Columbian food - this was my first ""official"" experience, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I had the Daisy's Eggs dish along w/a chicken empanada, and they were very flavorful. The Daisy's eggs hit the spot. The Columbian chorizo and the yucca potatoes were my favorite. In fact, I need to find some Columbian chorizo here in Chicago - It reminded me of a kielbasa sausage, and I really liked the texture and flavor. I had a taste of the plantain stuffed french toast, and it was tasty as well. I will say that the portions are on the small side, so you may need to order more food as you eat.",4.0

"Welcome to my sad, woe-is-me, lonely Saturday night saga:The husband and I had plans tonight to go to a surprise welcome dinner party for a friend coming from Brazil. I volunteered to bring mashed potatoes, because mashed potatoes are awesome. At 4pm, I painstakingly washed and peeled enough potatoes to mash and feed 10 people. At 4:30 I started boiling said potatoes. At 4:50 I drained potatoes and poured boiling water ALL DOWN MY THIGH.I screamed, put the pot down (and thankfully didn't drop it which prevented further problems) and stood there in my jeans that were collecting/holding/transferring the burning water directly into my thigh. Upon tearing them off, I realized a large portion of my thigh had immediately blistered. 2nd degree burn. Ouch.Why am I writing this all for a Bogota review? Wait for it, I will get there.In excruciating pain, I realized I would not be able to put on clothes, walk to Park Slope, and have fun at a dinner party. My saint of a husband finished making the mashed potatoes for me like a champ, and we decided he would go to the dinner party solo while I stayed home and ordered food.But I was so sad. I was sad because my mashed potatoes looked delicious. I was sad to be missing out on the roasted chicken another friend was bringing. I was sad to miss out on all of the wine and tasty goodies the party had in store (not to mention I was sad to get some quality socialization time in). So I thought ""to hell with it, I WILL find a comparable meal on GrubHub.""Alas, Bogota's menu was the Neosporin to my burning need for comfort food. I ordered the roasted half chicken, cilantro mashed potatoes, sauteed spinach, and grilled street corn. Delicious, delicious, delicious, and delicious. Seriously, everything was exactly what I was hoping for. Not to mention sometimes I get worried ordering from actual restaurants (as opposed to the standard takeout/deliver place) because I don't trust that they will make and deliver food in the quoted amount of time. Have no fear, my food arrived about 40 minutes after ordering. Viva la Bogota!**Tonight's post is brought to you by the bottle of Malbec my husband graciously went out to get for me to lessen the pain of my burn before he left for the dinner party.

"Brooklyn might be the new Manhattan. I feel myself liking Brooklyn more and more now. Am I turning into a hipster? Probably not, but Brooklyn does have pretty interesting and tasty restaurants, and Bogota Latin Bistro is one of them.We came for a late lunch, after rock climbing over at Brooklyn Boulders. The interior was fab and cozy. Definitely an awesome place for some lunch and good conversation over cheap drinks and tasty food. My friends ordered the pina colada, and a passion fruit frozen margarita. Both drinks were delicious, but for me, was too sweet. For those with a sweet tooth and hates the taste of alcohol, these are the perfect drinks. I decided not to get one because I did not want to climb the walls drunk. For lunch, I ordered the Cuban Sandwich, my friends ordered the chicken and rice, and fish tacos. They also ordered sides of tostones, and this mashed up plantain thing. The Cuban Sandwich was a little on the dry side, but the chipotle dip that came with it made it taste a lot better. It would be a lot better if the pickles and cheese were spread out more evenly. Towards the end, I was just eating chunks of bread. The fries that came with the sandwich were kinda sad, unfortunately. Burnt and brown flimsy looking sticks ended up on my dish. Other than that, nothing really went wrong, except for the mashed up plantain dish. It was really bland, and my friend who is a lover of plantains, said this was one of the worst he's tasted.  On the other hand, my friends really enjoyed their dishes and scoffed theirs down in fifteen minutes. They still managed to make compliments about the food though.I would say that the food was pretty average, but at least the portions were huge, and the drinks are cheap if you go during happy hour. I would come back again for some drinks. It is also an awesome place to get some free condoms. Towards the bathroom, you will see a huge jar full of them. My friend witnessed two old men grabbing many. I see they get lucky. I grabbed 4 and gave one to each of my friends.",4.0
"The venue is a tight and stuffy spot, tables are one right after another, not a place for the clumsy or claustrophobic.  Decor and atmosphere is busy but sorted well, crowd noise is average.  Its about a 10 min. walk from the N/Q - Union stop.A friend in my party knows the manager so we were seated within a couple of mins. on a Saturday night at 10PM.  I don't think we would've been serviced as quicly had she not been there.  Service is fast and friendly and prices are very moderate.Family style dining is always best when with a large group.  We began with platanos rellenos, which are sweet plantains stuffed with chicken and crema, fried calamari and mixed empanadas.  The apps were well portioned and absolutely flavorful.  The calamari was fresh and the batter was flakey not soggy. Entrees were ropa vieja (shredded skirt steak with olives in a light tomato sauce), arroz con pollo and lobster quesadillas.  Again, all robust in flavor, great color and fresh.  The skirt steak was soft and it melted in your mouth - no lie.  The lobster was seasoned delightfully as well.  For dessert just go all out and get the sampler which gives you: tres leches, flan de coco, obleas and churros with caramel and chocolate sides.  DELISH!  All the while we had a pitcher or two of their pomegranate margarita which was hard and strong.All in all in was a nice spot with really good food and service.  Give it a try and then walk over to the Chocolate room for more sweets.",4.0
This place is my favorite spot in park slope. It's perfect for any occasion and the drinks are delicious and extremely affordable. The fish tacos and dip sampler make any trip here worthwhile. I also had a special once that was mango jalapeño chicken wings that were both spicy and TO DIE FOR. I will continue to come here again an again because I am never let down!,5.0
"Stopped in on a very snowy night, new to the neighborhood, and everyone from the bar staff, to the waitress, to the owner who greeted me on the way out could not have been more hospitable.  And the food was flawless.  The flank steak and fried pork belly with black beans, fried egg, and platones was exactly what the evening called for (diets are for warmer evenings. :)  Will be back again and again.",5.0
"I visited Bogota Latin Bistro when I went to Brooklyn/Park Slope over the holidays, and it is a delicious neighborhood brunch spot - very festive and fun inside. I can't say that I've ever had Columbian food - this was my first ""official"" experience, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I had the Daisy's Eggs dish along w/a chicken empanada, and they were very flavorful. The Daisy's eggs hit the spot. The Columbian chorizo and the yucca potatoes were my favorite. In fact, I need to find some Columbian chorizo here in Chicago - It reminded me of a kielbasa sausage, and I really liked the texture and flavor. I had a taste of the plantain stuffed french toast, and it was tasty as well. I will say that the portions are on the small side, so you may need to order more food as you eat.",4.0

"I'm giving Bogota 5 stars because of the Lobster Quesadilla Special. It was the best quesadilla I have ever had. There were big pieces of lobster in it too :)They give you Banana Chips for dipping and snacking on. I didn't think I'd like them but I did.The waitress recommended a drink that was really good, but I can't remember the name. I think it was sangria & frozen margarita combined.For my entree I had the Catfish Tacos, which comes with a choice of 2 sides. I picked the yellow rice and black beans. The waitress told me that I was allowed to pick another one so I picked the sweet plantains. When my bf ordered he picked the sweet plantains and rice but he didn't get a third choice, I guess it was the order he picked them because of their value. So I guess a good *Tip* would be that if you are really hungry to order the least expensive sides so you get the extra! There were 3 Catfish Tacos served with a Chipotle sauce. Really delicious. I saved the last one and some sides to take to go, but then after I filled out the survey I totally forgot about them. So I guess my only complaint is that after we paid that was pretty much it.

The place is really nice.  They offered us outside seating which we were down with but when we got back there it was too warm.  The hostess was very nice about re-seating us inside. The tables for 2 are REALLY tiny which sucks for couples like us who LOVE to eat! The tables are also a bit too close together but they want to get as many people seated as possible so it's cool.To start, the waiter brought over some chips & pointed out their ""special"" sauce on the table which was VERY yummy.  We started off with the calamari and the dip sampler which were both delicious. I ordered the jalapeno grilled catfish and Serge ordered the chuletas.  We both ordered rice & beans. I also ordered the maduros and Serge ordered the tostones which he didn't get but we didn't say anything because we were soooo full anyway.  The beans for the rice could've been a little more flavorful but the catfish, pork chops and rice were pefectly cooked & seasoned.  Our white sangrias were also very good.I can't wait to go back!!",4.0
"It was ok. The only thing they might have to adjust is the seating, cramped!!!! Decent food amount and price.  Will try it again,",2.0
"got here late for my 8pm dinner reservation with friends. they were generous to retain our table despite a full house. the ambiance and service were superb, really reflect of Latin, if not Colombian, culture.we started with several appetizers, drinks, shots, and food. i honestly couldn't' tell you what everyone ordered because all shared. what i can say is to get the aguardiente, it is LEGIT.our waitress was great along with the food. when in Brooklyn, this is definitely a place to check out. Be forewarned though, parking is a premium so be ready to poach other people walking to their cars, cabbing it, or hoofing it.then again, after the proof on that rum, the latter doesn't seem so bad. you won't even feel the new york cold.",5.0
"As a huge fan of all things Cuban and Latin, I never pass up an opportunity to try a restaurant that offers my favorite food. And Bogota's delivered!The restaurant is well appointed and the decor is quite fitting. We had no trouble getting a table on a Sunday evening. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful and generally made it a pleasant experience overall. It can get a bit boisterous, but not oppressively so. My friend and I had no real troubles maintaining a conversation. But all the cozy ambience and friendly smiles mean nothing without a tantalizing and well executed menu. And Bogota's does not disappoint!I started the evening right with a pumpkin mash margarita with a cinnamon salted rim. It was unique and satisfying. Since I wasn't terribly hungry, I opted for the Cubano sandwich - one of my favs, so my expectations were probably high. The plate arrived with a piping hot, perfectly toasted, stacked high Cubano with a side of perfectly seasoned fries on the side. It was more than enough food, and I ended up taking half the sandwich home. The sandwich itself was incredible. It was one of the best Cubanos I ever had....and I've had many! It comes with a chipotle sauce on the side that is technically for the sandwich. But do yourself a favor and use it as a dip for the fries. You won't regret it! And besides, the sandwich is wonderful as-is!While this was my first visit to Bogota, I will certainly be back - often!",4.0
"Absolutely LOVE this place. I've eaten here numerous times and even celebrated a birthday here last year. I've tried several things on the menu and enjoyed them all. Drinks are great, service is attentative. It can sometimes be chaotic at the front door so I would definitely recommend a reservation so you're not forced to squeeze into the tiny area while you wait..But otherwise, awesome!!",4.0

"Had the corn empanadas, plato paisa, and my wife had arroz con pollo. All gluten-free all pretty good. First the empanadas... very addictive. I could have just kept on eating more and more of them and would not stop. They were the equivalent of an Indian samosa with latin flavors. Very, very good. The aji sauce it came with (vinegar based) paired really well with the fried empanadas. Then the cocktails... the guava mimosa was waaay better than the orange one so give the tropical flavors a try. Wanted to try the mango one too but I'll wait til next time. AND trust me, there will be a next time. The plato paisa... soooooooooo good. The steak was marinated and cooked perfectly for such a think cut. The rice was excellent. Bacon was to die for and I ordered the chorizo and it was AWESOME. The slaw was a great companion to the food as well. All in all a very good but indulgent plate of food. The arroz con pollo however, could use some help... just sayin...Now for the best part...the service. Super friendly and helpful for my celiac, gluten free wife. They made sure that what was labeled GF on the menu is truly GF and that's a great relief. They have done their homework. We will be back for sure.",4.0
"This was my go to place for about two years. BUT this last visit is my last. Sorry Bogota, you've become a disappointment. About a year ago, I went with my family and my mom got raw salmon-- hardy an apology.. But we figure, hey it happens (although not even a drink was offered as a compensation). Next time, I went with four friends for ""happy hour"" and we were completely overcharged. We swore that would be the last time we ever went back. Well today, this was the third strike- when I got raw chicken & informed the waitress (who was perfectly fine). She sent the manager over- who informed me that ""this is how the chicken is cooked- he asked the  cook"".... Oh and by the way, it's on the house( as if this guy thought I was actually going to pay for raw food). It ruined our entire meal- it was 100% raw and to hear that it wasn't was so funny. Then my food that was brought out was completely tasteless- I ate about two bites, and brought it home (which it will end up in the trash). All this manager needed to do, to save four customers (& many more since we have a lot of family and friends) was possibly buy us a round of drinks? Clearly manager 101 was a failed class.",1.0
"This is one if the best restaurants in Brooklyn, hands-down and bar none. Tonight I had chipotle roasted salmon and my gf had plantain crusted chicken with mango BBQ sauce, both were so excellent and savory that I want to start dinner all over again. The arroz con pollo here will make you cry with joy, and you choose from sides likes spinach and garlic, quinoa pilaf, and plantains. Only down side is the crazy insane line. But worth it! Oh, did I mention the delish mojitos?",5.0
"I have loved this establishment for a long time.. But the last few visits have been mediocre; luke warm food, food not cooked to order, and inattentive service. I have continued to revisit  hoping that the attentive service that paid attention to detail so well would return. However, that has not been the case! Today will mark the last visit I will make... Service and food  are still inconsistent, and to top it off .... ""Menu has been updated"" in other words prices have gone up....my beloved sangritas... The one excuse I would have used to go back are now $8 during happy hour ... Excuse given ...""Price of lime has gone up."" I'll take my business to Blend...

"i was craving yuca fries (pregnant lady), so my husband and i went to the bistro based on yelp recommendations last sunday. the atmosphere was lovely, airy, mostly peaceful. we were seated quickly and our waitress was nice, cheerful. i ordered eggs, salad and yuca fries and my husband ordered some sort of breakfast dish with plantains and avocado.we then waited and waited. and waited some more. it must have been at least 40 minutes before our food came out. when it did arrive, they brought yuca home fries with our dishes though we specifically asked for and were delightfully swooning over the idea of yuca fries. the guy, not our waitress, who brought the yuca home fries told us they were fries and we were wrong. nope, no way. we asked to speak to waitress and she was apologetic, she took the home fries and said she would put in an order right away. i ate my salad which was good aside from mushy tomatoes and he had his egg dish which was fine, nothing spectacular. we waited for our fries, we waited and waited. another twenty-five minutes at least. as we were getting up to go and tell the waitress to bring us the bill, the yuca fries came. all other food was cleared. the fries were undercooked, not fried for long enough, and cut into strange and uneven slices. so disappointing on so many levels. i wish they would have just told us it would take too long to bring them up instead of giving us undercooked fries. we ate a few, left most of them and brought our bill to front to pay bill. we were so ready to leave.overall, disappointing experience. wouldn't return, unless i had hours to spare.",2.0
"Came to this restaurant based on a suggestion from our friends. When I saw the menu I was excited!  Feta black bean empanadas!

Muy Bueno food de latino!!!!5 stars if it wasnt for the service.  Great selection of beers of may different countries and the mojitos are very good and strong. The food was more than great!  The plantains w/ black bean had great flavor and always prefer these as chips over tortilla any time of the day.  The other app was an Arepa w/ Mexican sausage.  I did choose the sweet yellow corn and the sweetness accented the salty sausage perfectly!  There is no reason for these two apps when they are very easily made to take 15-20 mins to be served.  The catfish tacos were lighted breaded.  The chipotle sauce was good on the tacos.  I would recommend some sort of slaw to be served w/ the tacos to give it a lil more texture.  The sides were coconut rice and that was just ok along w/ the sauteed spinach.  The food maybe slow but I dont mind the wait.  The atmosphere here is exactly what I would want.,4.0

"OMGGG, The atmosphere, the food, the service! My husband and I found this delightful spot thanks to all the great Yelp reviews, & we're so happy we did :) Neither of us have a real history with Latin food, but we both love to eat & the food was on point! I ordered that night's special, BBQ'd Pork Chops in a delicious fruity glaze with the freshest piece of watermelon & corn on the cob. The pork chop was cooked perfectly, & had the best smoky flavor .. oh yeah & you get 2 huge pork chops, not one but 2!!! My husband got the arroz con pollo, & his was also a very generous serving. I of course think that my dish was the better of the two, but let's face it I usually order the best dishes :) Our server was an absolute sweetheart & kept bringing us the complimentary plantain chips while we were waiting, which we loved. Just a fabulous evening all around! Oh by the way, the only reason this place isn't getting 5 stars is that I wasn't a fan of the jalapeno macaroni & cheese, it was kind of dry. I know I know, call me crazy, but mac & cheese is important to me. OMG I also forgot I had the BEST mango mojito of my life, it was spectacular!!!",4.0
"Great spot any day of the week! Been coming here for years and every time it's a good time. They have great happy hour specials throughout the week and their brunch is on point!

"OMGGG, The atmosphere, the food, the service! My husband and I found this delightful spot thanks to all the great Yelp reviews, & we're so happy we did :) Neither of us have a real history with Latin food, but we both love to eat & the food was on point! I ordered that night's special, BBQ'd Pork Chops in a delicious fruity glaze with the freshest piece of watermelon & corn on the cob. The pork chop was cooked perfectly, & had the best smoky flavor .. oh yeah & you get 2 huge pork chops, not one but 2!!! My husband got the arroz con pollo, & his was also a very generous serving. I of course think that my dish was the better of the two, but let's face it I usually order the best dishes :) Our server was an absolute sweetheart & kept bringing us the complimentary plantain chips while we were waiting, which we loved. Just a fabulous evening all around! Oh by the way, the only reason this place isn't getting 5 stars is that I wasn't a fan of the jalapeno macaroni & cheese, it was kind of dry. I know I know, call me crazy, but mac & cheese is important to me. OMG I also forgot I had the BEST mango mojito of my life, it was spectacular!!!",4.0
"Great spot any day of the week! Been coming here for years and every time it's a good time. They have great happy hour specials throughout the week and their brunch is on point! The drinks here are deliciousss! I love their back garden/patio for brunch, it feels like your outside.The vibe at Bogota is very chill and cozy even when it's super packed. The food is really tasty and they have a lot of options. Empanada trio is my favorite app and I love the veggie tacos.",4.0

"Major concerns with this place. After hearing great reviews about this place and friend recommendations, we decided to come here to try it out. Very busy street, so good luck finding parking. This place is very crowded, so there might even be a wait.  Very modern restaurant with an excellent decor and a very hip ambiance. The layout of the restaurant isn't the greatest since you first walk down a very narrow little hallway to actually get to the separate rooms. We had sat in the back room where you have a view of the side of the building right next door. Not so great, but for the space they had to work with, a good job by them. The menu is basic Latin, Spanish fusion. The prices aren't reasonable for the portion sizes. Service is very friendly and very welcoming. The quesadillas are tiny. They have good flavor and use a very tasty type of cheese, probably jack cheese. Not a great balance of chicken to cheese, but I'm sure the restaurant makes a great profit off of that. The guacamole appetizer was pretty good. Fresh, hot chips with freshly made guacamole. Pretty good taste, but needs more seasoning. The empanada sampler (4 for $15) was a great deal, but didn't really impress me. The chicken ones were bland, but looked great. The outside had a nice, firm texture. The beef was pretty appetizing. Stick with that. Overall, a nice place, but needs some work.",3.0
"I came here one weekday afternoon with a friend to catch up over lunch. The restaurant is rather expansive and spacious compared to other places in this area. It is beautiful and interesting inside; the restaurant is bathed in lovey colors, the walls adorned with Latin flairs and paintings, and there's a quirky air to the interior that gives this place a lot of character. While we were pleased by the visual feast that lulled us into a content relaxed state, Bogota has an equally amazing outdoor dining area whose decor exudes life and fun.The high quality of the wonderful aesthetics of the place was matched by the quality of the server. Attentive, friendly, and welcoming I felt at home and comfortable. I felt taken care of, the server answered our questions without appearing annoyed, our water was refilled in a timely fashion, and our needs were anticipated and met.The food:-Catfish Tacos $16  Fried catfish in soft flour tortillas with lettuce, pico de gallo and smokin' chipotle sauce. For $16 I expected huge tacos with thick juicy pieces of cat fish. Instead I had three moderately sized tacos. I didn't get the hype over the cat fish tacos. I feel that the catfish could have been seasoned better and that they could have been spicier. I definitely had way better catfish than the ones they served me. However, the catfish was cooked well and the dish itself wasn't so bad. It was in fact pretty good but after rave review about how the catfish taco was ""a dream"" I had high expectations. Next time I come here I would order something else. The dish came with two sides and I opted for the tostones and red beans and rice.They were good, moderately sized, but I had better of both elsewhere. -Cubano Sandwich $13A huge sandwich filled with  roast pork, ham, swiss cheese, pickles, smokin' chipotle sauce and  dijon mustard. This came with scrumptious seasoned fries and a side of fresh salad. My friend gave me a big chunk of her sandwich to try and it was meaty savory yummy good. I highly recommend this dish as it is absolutely delish and you get a good value for your money.  -Caipirinhas $6 It was happy hour so I ordered a caipirinhas and I was damn glad I did. It is a divine mixture of cachaca (sugarcane rum), sugar, and lime. The caipirinhas is very sweet, refreshing, and dangerously good. If I had more money I would be downing these things like lovely strong juice. And this stuff is strong. One drink made me tipsy and feeling mighty fine. Happy Hour:Mon to wed 11:30am to 11pmThurs and Fri 11:30am to 6pmSat and Sun 11am to 5pmWonderful atmosphere, great service, good food, and amazing drinks.It's a great place to enjoy Colombian and other Latin flavors.",4.0
"Perfect combination of great food, reasonable prices, friendly staff, and lively atmosphere. There was a young crowd, but still a mix of families celebrating birthday parties and more, as well as a more mature clientele. We ordered the arroz con pollo and plantain crusted chicken with coconut rice and maduros. Happy hour lasts all day  on Mondays and seemed to offer quite a variety of drinks for reasonable prices. It was President's Day so we made reservations. It was a good idea because the place was packed even at about 5-6pm.

"One of my mainstays in my hood, I absolutely love frequenting this joint.  Whether you're a drinker, eater, or social gatherer, this place has something to offer for everyone.I am a true believer that Spanish food is one of the best forms of comfort food, and no doubt gives Soul Food, the original comfort food a run for its money.With traditional dishes such as empanadas, ceviche, platanos con queso, chicharrones, you can definitely give one of these items a shot and see how it stacks up with one of your fav' spots.The empanada sampler is on point.  There are I believe 8 different types of empanadas, accommodating to all types of eaters (carnivores, veggies, and vegans).  All items on the menu have a marking noting if it is vegan or veggie, which also can be quite appealing to the inquiring mind, as well.  One of my favorite empanada is the Cheese and Bean, because that cheese is killer!I recently discovered the Pina Colada there, and theirs is as good as any around!  The alcohol content is generous, but the flavor is incredible!  Being that this is a Latin fusion style restaurant, there are influences from different countries.  I love being able to order Caipirinhas, although this is a Brazilian drink.The waitstaff in its entirety is extremely nice, accommodating and timely.  The food for the most part is decent to exceptional, however strangely enough, I consider their rice and beans somewhat average, which one would think should be the easiest thing to nail down.The menu offers such a great variety of items that you can make it a point to come back time and time again.Tons of space for larger groups, the decor is quite quirky with mustard painted walls, with different mementos or artwork inspired from Latin America.I really don't have anything greatly negative to say about coming here - I love it so much and am happy to say it has fit in quite well in Park Slope.Last but certainly not least are the drink specials.  1/2 priced wine on Mondays, happy hour pretty much every day with M-W all day I believe.  This is really a joy, because you are aware that the management is cognizant of the customers' needs.",4.0

"I've been here a few times now. The first time was as a walk-in to a half-empty afternoon crowd and they refused to seat the first two of our four-person group while waiting for the others to show. It felt like too strict an adherence to a policy that didn't make sense given all the empty tables, but we tried some other place that night and it wasn't a big deal.In the two times since, it's been an ok experience.The ambience is great -- a wide open room, and a crowd that feels lively without being so loud that you can't hear your friends talk or that makes it hard to get to the bathroom. The employees are great too. Everyone from the hosts to the bartenders and servers are fast, friendly, and attentive. Drink menu is good, though they once had a special on pumpkin margaritas with muddled pumpkin and cayenne rimming the glass and it just didn't work.As for the food, it's decent, but not spectacular. In my two visits, I've had the Colombian plate and the arroz con pollo. The pork and steak in the Colombian plate were dryer and cooked a bit more than I would have liked, but I can ask for that for that to be fixed next time. Both that and the arroz con pollo were under seasoned in a way that adding salt and the aji remedied a bit, but couldn't fix completely.

"Been here many times... Always reliably delicious with excellent, friendly service. I also appreciate that there are many gluten-free and vegetarian and vegan options, which are clearly noted on their menu. The vegetarian tacos are a favorite, and I've had several of their fish dishes - all excellent. And then there are the drinks...  Delicious, interesting, and (especially during happy hour) reasonably priced. And they serve a gluten-free beer?  Seriously?My only real complaints are that they took away the gluten-free pancakes from the brunch menu, and that the place gets a little noisy when crowded and toasty in the summer. Consequently, it's not a good place for a quiet, intimate, and romantic date. But as a place to eat, drink, and berry merry with a group of friends, it's hard to beat.",5.0
"Great menu with seemingly authentic Latin American cuisine and delicious mojitos at good prices during happy hour. Vibe and atmosphere is casual. Great place to go with friends. Food is good, and their menu is large enough to merit repeat visits. Service is great, although I can see the servers being difficult to catch when the place gets packed. Classic mojitos are great with real cane sugar and lots of mint leaves. Not too sweet, just a tad. The fruit mojitos tend to get sweeter, so I like to stick with the original. Bucket beers where you can mix & match your beers. Nice. Definitely a great place to frequent with friends for a nice meal and good drinks.",4.0
"I normally love bogata. However, my experience last night has changed that. I made a reservation for my birthday for 16 people. I was told 8pm was fine. When I confirmed my reservation, I was asked if I wanted a prefixed menu. I said no, and was told that was fine. At 10am on the day of my reservation, a manager - Ian - called me and told me that whoever took my reservation made mistakes. He asked if I could bring my party in at 730 instead. Organizing a party for 16 is hard enough, so to be asked to change the time the day of is ridiculous. I was then told I should have been told that a prefixed menu was required. He then asked if I could figure out what appetizers we wanted and let him know then. Because getting the appetizer orders of 16 people - many of whom had never been there - is really logical and easy to do. THEN, I was told that we would be ""out of there"" by 10:30. At this point, I wanted to make a reservation somewhere else, but making a reservation for 16 the day of is impossible. When we arrived - all before 7:50 - we were told that they were setting our table up. By 8:10, we were told that the party before us was actually still sitting there. At 8:20, we were brought to the back room and seated at two different tables, where I was told it was ""impossible"" to sit us all at one table. Would have been nice if Ian mentioned THAT little detail to me, not to mention that this is untrue because I have been to parties of 16+ where we were seated at one long table in the front room. The back room is essentially outside with glass enclosures, and if you aren't sitting right next to a heater, it is freezinggg. The manager - who was soooo concerned about our party - never once came over to see how we were doing. I am positive that we were stuck in the back room at two tables and asked to come earlier because the restaurant make the mistake of overbooking. My birthday was ruined because of the service at bogota last night. I have never experienced such awful customer service. I will not be returning to bogota for this reason. It is really a shame because I like their food and the waiter was good. Bogota should reconsider their management and how they run things. For a $900+ bill, you would think you'd be treated a little better.",1.0

"I came here with my boyfriend and best friend for the Happy Hour on Labor Day '12. After enjoying a refreshing New Zealand brunch and sipping on watermelon and mint vodkas at Kiwiana (another must in BK) we wanted to keep our Labor Day buzz going.

From the minute you walk you're greeted with a friendly and knowledgeable wait staff. The attention to detail in this restaurant is outstanding. The murals are all inspired by historical events. The image of Simón Bolívar is tactfully sprinkled throughout the restaurant. Take a look at the coasters and ask the story behind them. Any of the bartenders, waitstaff or management will be happy to walk you through whom Simón Bolívar is and what his image represents. Attention to detail in every nook and cranny. The drinks are awesome! Try the Moijotos and Sangaritas! HH M-Thursday Noon-CLOSE! Umm you cannot beat that. The sauces that they have created are also a must try. Henry, a new manager here, walked us through each sauce through a test tasting. A very nice touch. I would highly recommend this spot for any occasion. There is also a sweet little enclosed back patio... perfect for a birthday party of just a couple cocktails... Hopefully you enjoy Bogota Latin BIstro as much as I did.",5.0
"Woah! This place was incredible. This place is a great blend between authentic latin american cuisine and newer inspiration. I had a sampler platter (I forgot what it was called!) that was so incredibly delicious. Also, the portions were huge and even I couldn't finish it, which is seriously saying something.The server was incredibly knowledgable about the menu and really friendly even though it was a busy night. The only problem with the evening was the drink. The server was RAVING about the Brazilian Sangria, and against my better judgment, I ordered it. It was...gross.

I am Hispanic, I know what good Hispanic food taste like, I actually know what any kind of good food taste like and to tell you the honest truth this food was disgusting!!!!!!!!!! it tasted like microwaved food! I love tostones and instead of getting tostones I got something rubbery!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    not great!!!!!!!!! if your drunk maybe that'll help you!! but if youre looking for good food don't go there!!!!!!!!( I went here about three months agao, never got the time to write a review, but i actually like telling ppl the truth, ignore the good comments, they must not know what good food taste like!!!!!!!!!!!)DISSAPOINTED",1.0
"Been here many times... Always reliably delicious with excellent, friendly service. I also appreciate that there are many gluten-free and vegetarian and vegan options, which are clearly noted on their menu. The vegetarian tacos are a favorite, and I've had several of their fish dishes - all excellent. And then there are the drinks...  Delicious, interesting, and (especially during happy hour) reasonably priced. And they serve a gluten-free beer?  Seriously?My only real complaints are that they took away the gluten-free pancakes from the brunch menu, and that the place gets a little noisy when crowded and toasty in the summer. Consequently, it's not a good place for a quiet, intimate, and romantic date. But as a place to eat, drink, and berry merry with a group of friends, it's hard to beat.",5.0
"Great menu with seemingly authentic Latin American cuisine and delicious mojitos at good prices during happy hour. Vibe and atmosphere is casual. Great place to go with friends. Food is good, and their menu is large enough to merit repeat visits. Service is great, although I can see the servers being difficult to catch when the place gets packed. Classic mojitos are great with real cane sugar and lots of mint leaves. Not too sweet, just a tad. The fruit mojitos tend to get sweeter, so I like to stick with the original. Bucket beers where you can mix & match your beers. Nice. Definitely a great place to frequent with friends for a nice meal and good drinks.",4.0
"I normally love bogata. However, my experience last night has changed that. I made a reservation for my birthday for 16 people. I was told 8pm was fine. When I confirmed my reservation, I was asked if I wanted a prefixed menu. I said no, and was told that was fine. At 10am on the day of my reservation, a manager - Ian - called me and told me that whoever took my reservation made mistakes. He asked if I could bring my party in at 730 instead. Organizing a party for 16 is hard enough, so to be asked to change the time the day of is ridiculous. I was then told I should have been told that a prefixed menu was required. He then asked if I could figure out what appetizers we wanted and let him know then. Because getting the appetizer orders of 16 people - many of whom had never been there - is really logical and easy to do. THEN, I was told that we would be ""out of there"" by 10:30. At this point, I wanted to make a reservation somewhere else, but making a reservation for 16 the day of is impossible. When we arrived - all before 7:50 - we were told that they were setting our table up. By 8:10, we were told that the party before us was actually still sitting there. At 8:20, we were brought to the back room and seated at two different tables, where I was told it was ""impossible"" to sit us all at one table. Would have been nice if Ian mentioned THAT little detail to me, not to mention that this is untrue because I have been to parties of 16+ where we were seated at one long table in the front room. The back room is essentially outside with glass enclosures, and if you aren't sitting right next to a heater, it is freezinggg. The manager - who was soooo concerned about our party - never once came over to see how we were doing.

The guava was the one I was hesitant to try but my friend really wanted to see what it was all about. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. I thought the guava/cream cheese combo would be weird but with the fried dough it tasted/reminded me of apple pie. I wouldn't necessarily order it again but I'm glad I tried it. Also, the sampler only came with 1 of each type of empanada and for $16 that comes out to be $4/empanada. I liked it, but it def was not worth the $. The arroz con pollo was very good. It came with a side of black beans, red cabbage, and fried plantains which were ok, nothing really special.The service was outstanding though and I'd give them 5 stars for that.

"I was curious to see what their take on Colombian food was, which is generally known to be at its best in Astoria. Well I was quite impressed. I started with some chips and Guac (fine not colombian, but toss it in) and enjoyed it. Ordered myself some Arozz con Pollo which came with yellow rice mixed with diced grilled chicken, plantains, black beans, and other veggies. Overall it tasted very authentic, and was prepared nicely. My friends raved about the mixed margaritas (didn't personally try it though). Service was I thought a little slow, but thats not always bad if you want to keep the conversations going and the drinks flowing. I liked the decour, with a few sprinklings of Colombia all over the restaurnt, including on the menu. A little odd to just have 2 unisex bathrooms (seemed to move slow) but overall a solid Colombian establishment in an area of the city not really known for Colombian food.",4.0

"Let me just say that this place is not bad at all. It has Imperial beer (a nostalgic memory of my time in Costa Rica). The food was not bad at all but it was definitely not worth the hype that I thought it would be. I ordered the Bandeja Paisa. It was good. Not great. The steak could have been a bit more seasoned, it was bland. The maduros and avocado was good, but small. The Chicharron - as good as I thought it would be. I was pleased with the salsa they give you at the beginning when you sit down. That was quite delicious. My sister and cousin had some kind of drink (Brazil?) it was good according to them. The service was good too. My friend who recommended this place says she disagrees with me when it came to the food but- I eat out 10 times more than everyone at the table combined in a decade. This means, they do not eat nearly as much as I do. All-in-all, without getting confrontational with my friend, I cheered the place on because it is a cool spot in Park Dope. Just not worth all the hype. I'm sorry- I like to come in expecting nothing and being impressed to give a place a great review. This place boasted greatness and fell short in my opinion.

"I have never had a bad experience at this place. The food is consistently great, but what really makes this place the best is that every single member of the staff is cheerful, courteous an friendly.

"It's rare that I go somewhere and then I want to tell everyone I meet about it but this place was great. The food was really amazing. We ordered way too much and ate for 3 days of leftovers. The only reason I am taking off 1 star is for the service not the food. I saw two couples argue over their bill. Maybe it was just busy but all the tables that were drinking had some ""mistakes"" that needed to be corrected like charging more for Happy hour drinks and so on.Our server didn't bring us the food in the order we asked for.

I would not recommend to go if you're more than 6 people though, they can't handle biggest parties properly (my birthday there was a big disappointment: long wait and very bad service)...Usually, service is fast and friendly, the place has a great vibe, it's one of my favorite places in Park Slope!",4.0
Came here for a late dinner and was very satisfied. Started with a mango pineapple margarita which was pretty good but then I had a coconut margarita OMG it was the best (I will be back for that) the sweet corn appetizer was yummy as well. I chose the plantain crusted chicken for an entree.. Lots of flavor no complaints... Our server Natasha was awesome went through a lot of popular items on the menu she was very nice... Overall great meal... I will be back next week!,5.0
"Insanely good.We stopped by around 9 for a late dinner on Friday.  We should have made a reservation since they get packed on the weekends, but we ended up settling for about an hour wait. The wait staff was friendly while we waited and offered menus or grabbing a drink from the bar.  The waiter even remembered my name as we left and said thank you on the way out.  The sangritas are delicious.  You need to order one.  Now.The food was incredible.  I got catfish tacos with cilantro mashed potatoes.  I wanted to save a catfish taco for leftovers the next morning, but they were too good and I had to scarf them all down during our meal.  The portions are generous and I had enough mashed potatoes, rice, and beans to last for another two meals.  My friend got the chicken quesadilla which I thought would be pretty standard, but the addition of plantains and whatever other unearthly things they do to the quesadilla made it delicious.  Get a sangrita + catfish tacos.  You will not be disappointed!",5.0
"I was curious to see what their take on Colombian food was, which is generally known to be at its best in Astoria. Well I was quite impressed. I started with some chips and Guac (fine not colombian, but toss it in) and enjoyed it. Ordered myself some Arozz con Pollo which came with yellow rice mixed with diced grilled chicken, plantains, black beans, and other veggies. Overall it tasted very authentic, and was prepared nicely. My friends raved about the mixed margaritas (didn't personally try it though). Service was I thought a little slow, but thats not always bad if you want to keep the conversations going and the drinks flowing. I liked the decour, with a few sprinklings of Colombia all over the restaurnt, including on the menu. A little odd to just have 2 unisex bathrooms (seemed to move slow) but overall a solid Colombian establishment in an area of the city not really known for Colombian food.",4.0
"Bogota is the s***! The food is unique, the drinks are great and the service is amazing. I like the vibe of the place too. I don't remember what the music is like considering how much i go there (which, if you know me, is odd), but I'm sure it works with everything else in this restaurant. Expect to wait a few minutes to be seated.",5.0
"Let me just say that this place is not bad at all. It has Imperial beer (a nostalgic memory of my time in Costa Rica). The food was not bad at all but it was definitely not worth the hype that I thought it would be. I ordered the Bandeja Paisa. It was good. Not great. The steak could have been a bit more seasoned, it was bland. The maduros and avocado was good, but small. The Chicharron - as good as I thought it would be. I was pleased with the salsa they give you at the beginning when you sit down. That was quite delicious. My sister and cousin had some kind of drink (Brazil?) it was good according to them. The service was good too. My friend who recommended this place says she disagrees with me when it came to the food but- I eat out 10 times more than everyone at the table combined in a decade. This means, they do not eat nearly as much as I do. All-in-all, without getting confrontational with my friend, I cheered the place on because it is a cool spot in Park Dope. Just not worth all the hype. I'm sorry- I like to come in expecting nothing and being impressed to give a place a great review. This place boasted greatness and fell short in my opinion. Everyone else though had a great time, which is why I'd give it 3.5 stars.

I got the quinoa cakes as my entree and they were SO GOOD. I wouldn't really have expected a vegan entree (I was feeling animal-product-less that evening) to be so good at a place like Bogota, but it was awesome.

"It is probably one of the best parts about coming to a big city - all the food, no matter what kind it is, is amazing! We landed late at LGA and met our friends at this restaurant for dinner. It was about 10:00pm, and the place was still pretty full (something that does not happen on a Thursday night in Minneapolis, let me tell you. We are all usually huddled inside trying to keep warm or to stay cold... why do I live here again?) Bob ordered the paella and I had the fish tacos. Now, you may think - meh, fish tacos... they can be pretty boring. These were far and away the BEST fish tacos I have ever had. The batter was nice and crispy and everything in the tortilla was really REALLY good. It was not bland or boring. Bob's paella was also wonderful. The seafood was cooked really well and the rice was perfect! Overall, my entire experience at this restaurant was fantastic! The service was great, the drinks and food delicious and ambiance fun! I mean, if this is the kind of place that you can just ""walk in on"" as a casual night out - I would say that all you New Yorkers are pretty damn lucky!",5.0

"This place has a very nice vibe and is very colorful! Our waitress, Justine was one of the friendliest waitresses I've met; she gave us great suggestions and didn't just point to the priciest item on the menu.We decided to try the codfish empanadas and a tofu spinach mushroom quesadilla as appetizers and they were both good. The empanadas were a little dry though. As my entree, I had the BBQ tofu steak and it was so delicious! It was a good representation of steak and my side of yellow rice and black beans complimented the dish. My boyfriend had the arroz con pollo and he devoured the whole plate! Great family or date place for a good price!",4.0
"Let me start off by saying that I tend to be very picky when it comes to Colombian food. As a Latina, I'm always trying all sorts of cuisines but in particular Latin food. I loved this place! The red sangria was made just the way I like it. They definitely put the time and effort into their food/drinks and service. I fell in love with their Arepa de Chocolo with shredded queso blanco. I can't wait to return and try other menu choices. I liked the comfort and casual-ness of this place as well. Nice decorations :)",5.0
"I went a week ago with my wife.we tried as much as possible.  We started with the calamari and the mazorca.  The calamari was amazing.  The Mazorca was ok, but was cold.  For entrees we had ropa vieja and the ribeye. With tostones and maduros.  The ribeye was slightly over cooked but eatable.  The Mojitos were amazing.   My only real complaint would be that when we entered the hostess was no where to be found and the bartender couldn't figure out how to use the hostess computer.  When the hostess came back she still made us wait while she did other things.  I would recommend them to get another hostess or to train the bartenders to help.",4.0
"We came for a Saturday brunch. It's great to have another vegan, gluten-free brunch choice in the neighborhood. Overall, it was a nice experience, but there were a few issues.First, my wife's tofu scramble had basically no flavor and was quite small. She left hungry despite eating it all.I ordered ""egg nachos"".  They were also described as chilaquiles in quotation marks, but they probably shouldn't have mentioned the word chilaquiles at all.

"I've eaten here twice and both times was not disappointed. They have tons of yummy creative options, especially for non-meat eaters like me.

For apps, our table ordered calamari and plantanos con queso. Food was so good that I even ordered extra to take home. Will definitely be going back again soon.",5.0

"I ate by Bogota Latin Bistro about 1 month ago.... Sorry little behind on the Yelping. Anyway I really enjoyed the columbian platter. Thats the one with all the meat, rice and beans. Its a plate full of goodness and it will make your ass want to head back home and take a nap. Service was very nice and friendly. All and all, an awesome addition to Brooklyn. Go try it!!!!",3.0
"It is probably one of the best parts about coming to a big city - all the food, no matter what kind it is, is amazing! We landed late at LGA and met our friends at this restaurant for dinner. It was about 10:00pm, and the place was still pretty full (something that does not happen on a Thursday night in Minneapolis, let me tell you. We are all usually huddled inside trying to keep warm or to stay cold... why do I live here again?) Bob ordered the paella and I had the fish tacos. Now, you may think - meh, fish tacos... they can be pretty boring. These were far and away the BEST fish tacos I have ever had. The batter was nice and crispy and everything in the tortilla was really REALLY good. It was not bland or boring. Bob's paella was also wonderful. The seafood was cooked really well and the rice was perfect! Overall, my entire experience at this restaurant was fantastic! The service was great, the drinks and food delicious and ambiance fun! I mean, if this is the kind of place that you can just ""walk in on"" as a casual night out - I would say that all you New Yorkers are pretty damn lucky!",5.0
Always wanted to try this place and super glad I did! Had a quick bite at the bar with group of friends. The bartender Erin made a fantastic passion fruit mojito and excellent food recommendations. Can't wait to go back for dinner!,5.0
"This place has a very nice vibe and is very colorful! Our waitress, Justine was one of the friendliest waitresses I've met; she gave us great suggestions and didn't just point to the priciest item on the menu.We decided to try the codfish empanadas and a tofu spinach mushroom quesadilla as appetizers and they were both good. The empanadas were a little dry though. As my entree, I had the BBQ tofu steak and it was so delicious! It was a good representation of steak and my side of yellow rice and black beans complimented the dish. My boyfriend had the arroz con pollo and he devoured the whole plate! Great family or date place for a good price!",4.0
"Let me start off by saying that I tend to be very picky when it comes to Colombian food. As a Latina, I'm always trying all sorts of cuisines but in particular Latin food. I loved this place! The red sangria was made just the way I like it. They definitely put the time and effort into their food/drinks and service. I fell in love with their Arepa de Chocolo with shredded queso blanco. I can't wait to return and try other menu choices. I liked the comfort and casual-ness of this place as well. Nice decorations :)",5.0
"I went a week ago with my wife.we tried as much as possible.  We started with the calamari and the mazorca.  The calamari was amazing.  The Mazorca was ok, but was cold.  For entrees we had ropa vieja and the ribeye. With tostones and maduros.  The ribeye was slightly over cooked but eatable.  The Mojitos were amazing.   My only real complaint would be that when we entered the hostess was no where to be found and the bartender couldn't figure out how to use the hostess computer.  When the hostess came back she still made us wait while she did other things.  I would recommend them to get another hostess or to train the bartenders to help.",4.0
"We came for a Saturday brunch. It's great to have another vegan, gluten-free brunch choice in the neighborhood. Overall, it was a nice experience, but there were a few issues.First, my wife's tofu scramble had basically no flavor and was quite small. She left hungry despite eating it all.I ordered ""egg nachos"".  They were also described as chilaquiles in quotation marks, but they probably shouldn't have mentioned the word chilaquiles at all. They were just egg nachos. Still, it was a tasty dish.Overall, the service was good and the wait staff were friendly. Would probably eat here again.",4.0

"Happy hour!! On Wednesday nights it goes all night...sit at the bar if you can...I've been 3 times and had the best time, best service (and the best drinks) when sitting at the bar. The food hasn't impressed me...but in all honesty I've only had a few items...it's just that two of the 3 that I've had...have been really disappointing...the ceviche on the menu tasted like it used Heinz ketchup as it's base...and then I ordered a special desert that wound up being just a big dish of vanilla ice cream with a very small, tasteless pastry on the side :( But the arroz con pollo...now that's something I'd definitely order again!",4.0

"My favorite part of coming back to Bogota is the service! I've seen the owners around and they're lovely, so gracious and friendly. The staff is very attentive and so nice! One thing I recommend is the guava and cheese empanadas. I'm not usually a fan of guava (my mom used to try and make me eat guava pastries when I was younger and I would refuse!) but wow- bogota has found a way to make me eat guava and enjoy it. I can't imagine NOT eating their guava and cheese empanadas. They're so deliciously addictive.. I even ordered two to go! The best coconut mojitos I've ever had. Their arepas and empanadas are so delicious. I've come here before for brunch, happy hours, dinner and also after a few concerts at Barclays late at night.. Same wonderful service and food/drinks each time. Love it here!",5.0

Our waitress alison checked on us consistently and kept our drinks filled and our bellies full.The drinks were good for happy hour drinks and had fresh guava in them.The food was amazing, I ordered the shrimp ceviche which blew my mind at the freshness of all the ingredients. Then I had the plantain chip crusted chicken with rice and beans which gave me the itis.The bill wasnt bad at all and Id definitely go back.",5.0
I was late for my reservation but they still seated us immediately on a busy Saturday night - three of us ordered the Colombian plate and I liked it the most - it was a nice variety - I even liked the homemade lemonade and the service was above average - the food wasn't exceptional but I'd visit again especially because of their close proximity to the Chocolate Room,4.0
"I""m big on customers service, and this has to be 1 place where I always feel welcome. As soon as I walk through the door I'm greeted with a smile. The food here...amazing! Drinks...spectacular! Dessert....off the charts! I recommend going for brunch and trying the Tofu Scramble (and make sure you take advantage of their happy hour lunch specials offered from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. on the weekend). Best thing about Bogota is they accommodate small reservations (I typically only reserve a table for myself, and a friend). Please be sure to try Bogota very soon.

"This place is amazing! The menu has alot of diverse selections, all described very clearly, including gluten free, vegetarian & vegan options. You can choose from decadent comfort type food or healthy & light options.

There is cozy outdoor garden patio seating if you like it a wee bit quieter & The inside atmosphere is festive with its decor and it's overall vibe.

"This place is way bigger than the storefront lets on and was PACKED when I went for dinner. The environment is fun, but I wasn't blown away by the food that was actually a touch pricy (started with empanadas and had chicken and rice for an entree); portions are well-sized, though.",3.0

"I love this place. It's dark, often loud & crowded to the point of inducing claustrophobia...Which is why the house covered up the garden in the back with a permanent clear fiberglass shell. Christmas lights & candles are strung for lighting; both the more manageable volume & the more intimate setting make it better for smaller crowds & couples that want to escape the ""party dinner"" thing. I used to drink a lot of beer. I discovered Negra Modelo, Xingu & Brahma here. Beers are $3 at happy hour, which takes over the majority of the Week in Bogota.

Or if you're prepared to hotbox the sh*t out of the whip on the way (whilst someone else is driving of course!) - the Bandeja Paisa is the Bomb. Get ready.

While you might need to hibernate for a day or two (the chicharrones alone will cause rapid-onset Itis) - this platter will be worth it. Just do yourself a favor & don't drink more than a beer with that much fat. A few shots or maybe a stiff neat scotch beforehand will do wonders, however.

The management was great to work with and extremely responsive to my questions and requests, which was incredibly important because I was arranging everything from Oregon. I totally forgot to update the number of people coming before the dinner too, and management made everybody fit just fine. I had a little freak out, but they were calm and collected the whole time, which was greatly appreciated. If anybody was thinking of having a party, I'd recommend this spot. The back room was also great because it was really busy out front and we were completely detached from all of that. Thank you to the whole Bogota team!",5.0
"very nice place, the decor and the ambiance is great. The food is very good, although they lack many vegetarian/vegan options i was still able to get a mushroom sandwich that was definitely on point. i wont forget to mention the ALL DAY happy hour they have mon -wed, and the drinks are stiff! the staff was friendly and very attentive. Thank me later once you have visited.",4.0
"I decided to write a review after going here last week because for some reason I never had before.I've been going here for almost 3 years since I first discovered it. Probably celebrated every major event here: birthdays, anniversaries, other special occasions, gone here before concerts, etc. and it has never once disappointed me.The food is unmatched if you love South American food. The drinks are incredible, happy hour is always a joy. The sauce they make for the plantain chips that you can buy by the bottle are divine.The service is always impeccable, they clearly only hire the friendliest wait-staff and even the bussers frequently introduce themselves by name and offer to help if you need anything.Every experience here is a memorable, I've been probably 20 times in the past few years for brunch, lunch, drinks, and dinner, and I'll keep coming here for as long as it lasts.Check in on yelp or 4sq for a free shot!",5.0
"This is a great place to go for Latin especially Colombian cuisine. Went on a Friday night and the wait was 45 minutes, Which I didn't mind because the place was packed which means people likes it and the food looked amazing. We finally got seated and served right a way. We did not have to wait long for what we ordered. We got a free order of Papa Criolla which is bite size Colombian potatoes with salsa rosada. they were amazing. we also ordered Yucca Frita, chicken quesadillas, Sancocho, and for dessert a variety of sweets.Great prices for such good food.   Everything was delicious and came in a very timely manner even though the restaurant was packed. It was a fun environment. A place I would go back again and again.",4.0
"i give you 100 stars!love love love you.its the only place that makes me feel like im on a ""date"" again.ambiance with candles, the wall colors,non intrusive staff. I know everybody by name, thats how accomodating they are.They try to accomodate you if lets say, you get a corner thats noisy or you want that other cute table they saw you eyeing.It gets super busy upfront obviously , b/c its awesome so just reserve or call up. The wall decals are all authentic which tell a story.bathrooms are superclean. im a total germaphobe. I had the biggest smile when i heard the hosts lysol wipe all the menus nightly!!bartenders dont touch any fruit with bare hands . They wear gloves. makes me feel safe.happy hour nights are worth it. sangria is great @$5. The sangrita if you want a lil mix of both sangria and frozen margarita.he food is delish. try the meat empanada. tortilla soup. If your hungry or curious. try the bandeja paisa. The steak is so tender and juicy , rice,an egg, arepa, avocado wedge and a chicharon(pork rind) yumThe tres leches cake is sooooo moist its crazy. I dont have a sweeet sweet tooth and this cake isnt extremely sugary either. Its just right with a cup of cafe con leche.I recommend to everyone for a date, birthday, whatever. They even have a back section (backyard garden theme thats really ""inside"" )for more tables or private events.look out for the 5th avenue festival in May !enjoy!!!",5.0
"Let me just say - any place that gives me 5.00  sangrias is awesome but sadly food and service is also important as well.The positives - Monday thru Wednesday is happy hour all night.  So you can get Mojitos, Sangrias, Margaritas for about 5 or 6 bucks.  The appetizers are filling and can be used as a small plate meal if you do not want to overdo it.  The food is seasoned well and you will never complain about the food.Now here is my grip - the service is very inconsistent.  I have gone there and have enjoyed my waitress/waiter (shoutout to Eric who is always awesome) and feel that they are attentive, timely and knowledegable.  I have also gone where I am not rushed and usually not a wait.  Then there are other times where the waiter/waitress seems lost, confused or just overwhelmed.  I have to remind them to give me my chips, the wait is crazy and I was rushed on numeroudsof occassions to hurry up because of the wait.Now, for the weird part.  I continue to still go there not because I like bad treatment but the Sangrias and steamed yucca keep calling me...what can a girl do! Just be prepared that you may that great service or it may be kinda crappy.",3.0
"Let's get to the point. Happy hour is as follows:Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday: All dayThursday, Friday: 12 - 6 PMSaturday, Sunday: 11 - 5 PMClassic mojitos, caipirinhas, pina coladas, margaritas, and sangria are $5.Add fruit for an additional $1. Sangritas are $6.00.An assortment of tasty Latin beers are only $3 bucks.Happy hour is throughout the entire restaurant. It's not limited to the bar. Score!Bogota is desirable for a steamy, romantic date night. Also, comfortable to enjoy a meal alone and chat with a friendly bartender while getting blasted in the eye with mojito juices.Bogota is perfect if you can't decide whether to eat inside, outside, at the bar, or at a winding holding cell right before the bar.For me, the food goes above and beyond the other Latin choices in the hood. The menu is massive, and it's not the same tired options at other local venues. The plantain crusted chicken and the arroz con pollo kill it every time. Why? Because they taste like heaven.The owners are proud of their establishment and they remind me by e-mail all the time. I get it, your place is sick.  Don't just tell me about these recent awards, or have me write tag lines and check-in, in order to reap cool benefits. Just say, ""Hey man, you look like you could use a free empanada on the house."" Either way, I'll be there.",4.0

"Really great food. Very authentic.

"We were staying in Brooklyn overnight and wanted a fun dinner out. Picked the right place. It was crowded at 6 on a Sunday. Reservations are a good idea. Three of us shared the dip sampler with a chunky guacamole and amazing pico de gallo and black bean dip. The plantains surprised me. Never cared for them before but these hit the mark. Two of us split the vegetarian taco. Lots of fresh veggies and goat cheese. Yum. The garlic shrimp here big and fresh with the right amount of garlic. No draft beer-boo- but a bottle of a Brooklyn lager went well with the food. And they have lots of Latin-y drinks that looked good had the weather been a wee bit warmer. Service is friendly and efficient and bright, fun atmosphere. Just a great dinner all around.",5.0
"Great and fun place to have dinner and drinks. I used to frequent this place when I lived in Brooklyn and I miss it.

"Being half Colombian, and having visited the motherland several times, I'm pretty picky about Colombian food.  But this place is pretty damn good and hits the spot every time.  The ambiance is colorful and fun, and they have an outdoor patio area that is covered so that you can use it all year long.I always order the Bandeja Paisa because it literally has everything you could ever want- rice, beans, steak, eggs, arepa, plaintains, pork rinds- literally everything.  The tres leches is also really good- not overwhelmingly sweet, excellent cake consistency.  I would definitely recommend if you're in the mood for Colombian food and can't bring yourself to make it all the way out to Queens.",4.0

"I just had to write this review before the month of October ended. It's crazy how excited and swooned one can get for good customer service. But, here in NYC, well, come on guys and gals! You know, it's rare that you find a business that really extends their commitment to hospitality and courtesy. So, a few weeks ago, I was searching for a restaurant for me and a few friends to celebrate my birthday. Of course, as any hostess or party planner, you want to make sure that all of your guests are  OK with the location, menu choices, etc.  So, I made reservations for a party of 12 for a Friday night at 8 pm.  Prior to this, I had only attended Bogota for Sunday brunch-which ROCKS!!! So, I had no idea what to expect. With a slight bit of concern, I called the restaurant a few days after I made the reservation  just to confirm that my party was on the schedule. The staff was totally calm and cool over the phone. No drama.  They put me right at ease, made changes to my reservation, and assured me that me and my guests would be taken care of (thank you Christian). And, even though I arrived late on Friday night, and they had to give my table away, (hey! business is business-i understand), we still had an AWESOME ladies night out. The coconut margaritas were extra YUM! The food was slap-yo-mama-good and our waitress, Rowena was a total gem!  I'm so glad that the staff at Bogota were all so patient and attentive to our needs.

A very solid plating of everything. The portions are more than enough. The staff was very friendly. There was a nice drum of chatter and the decor was cool. I would  definitely go back.",4.0
"Great service and very helpful and approachable staff. We were there for a birthday party with 8 but ended up with 9 people. They were able to make more than enough space for everyone! Ordered the mussels, empanadas sampler, and guac and chips for apps to share! Delicious! The gratis plantain chips were great. We wanted more and at $2, we couldn't resist. Everyone seemed happy with their entrees, drinks were great, and we all shared the tres leche for dessert with the birthday boy. Overall, a lot of food, good service, and interesting decor made for a fantastic dinner. The bill was about $275 for 9 people with drinks, apps, and dessert. Quite a deal.",5.0
"It is always a pleasant experience when I visit this place. It is by far one of my favorite Latin restaurants. The food, the drinks, the staff all make you want to go back again and again.

"We went there for my husband's birthday, the restaurant took our reservation for 10 people on a FRIDAY night, which was great:) I was also able to change the reservation without any problem!!

The portions were somewhat on the smaller end, but enough for us:) The only thing we did not like much were the Arepas.. You can find better ones down the road at Caracas...Also, parking is hard to find, given the its location..I would recommend having reservations for dinner, bcoz the place gets full!",4.0
"decent but probably our mistake for ordering take-out from here.Put it bluntly, we are in South Slope and there are probably a dozen or so Latin places in Greenwood Heights or even Sunset Park that would deliver to me for a lot less. The $13 Arroz con Pollo was barely shareable by two (but delicious, even if a little on the salty side). Paella was bigger but for $25 I'd expect decent size I guess.I did the Empanada Sampler and every Empanada was awesome! (to be fair, I'm a sucker for Empanadas). But $4 per Empanada is a bit steep for what I basically consider ""street food"" or something even a Sophie's chain does well for a $1.50Friend's Ropa Vieja was good but very oily it seemed.I think I'll be trying out cheaper places or maybe save my next Bogota experience for a trip to the actual restaurant for a sit-down meal instead of takeout.

"My Finance really likes this place so we had brunch here. It's a cute little place in Park Slope. The set up of the place is cool, but the bar area is a little cramped considering that all the traffic squeezes by the bar to get to the dining area. Anywho they have a lot of different flavors of mojitos (mango, pomegrantae). I didn't have one but everybody else did and they LOVED them. So if you go, get a mojito! I had the Colombian Chorizo sausage (you only get 1...womp) and french toast flavored with cinnamon and nutmeg. (traditional french toast). I asked the waitress to make sure it wasn't soggy and I was very happy because it as made just the way I like it and the chorizo sausage was good too. I like more of a traditional brunch with pancakes, waffles, omelettes, and eggs benedict and they don't have those options so I probably won't go back for brunch, maybe dinner though. I knew they served Latin food so I'm not complaining...I'm just sayin..It's a cute spot. If you're around Park Slope and like Latin food consider checking it out.",3.0
"I came here two weeks ago to have dinner with my boyfriend and his parents.

As soon as we had finished the appetizer, we had the main courses on our tables. We ordered one appetizer and 3 main courses (4 sides included) for us 4 and it was more than enough. The dishes are big and def. worth the price!The staff is once again, not only nice and friendly, they're also very professional.Bonus: We were there on a Monday which means happy hour all night and all of their amazing mojitos and caiprinhas were only $5!I will definitely go back to Bogota Latin Bistro to indulge in some Colombian food!",5.0

It looked like what I would make if I was trying to cook a piece of chicken in an understocked kitchen while starving. Also, I don't think I saw a single plantain on my plate. It seemed bread encrusted, if anything. The red beans with pork was nice, kind of like baked beans with pork but a little more Latin. The mango bbq sauce was just bbq sauce with a bit of mango flavor, but it wasn't too sweet and that made me happy. The mulled wine was a nice touch.

"Went here for lunch in the afternoon.  The restaurant is very festive and has the latin theme through the restaurant. The service is good and and the place looks clean.  The menu had a variety of food that includes multiple Latin cultures.  We had empanadas and guacamole with chips for appetizers.  Both were good.  My friend enjoyed his tortilla soup which he said was very filling.  For the meal, I had skirt steak with yellow rice and black beans.  The meal was accompanied with green ahi sauce but I thought the sauce was bland, kind if disappointing.  The food tasted ok but left me kind of bloated.  The total bill for 3 of us was $107 which I thought was pricey, but I'm not from Brooklyn.  Both reasons is why I gave a 3 rating.",3.0
"I was not very impressed with this place. I think the menu has too many items which makes it hard to choose -- a simpler menu would be better. I ordered several appetizers and I believe they were too oily. Also, the place is pricey. Even though we ordered mostly appetizers, the bill was on the high side. The white arepas were tasteless and were not worth the money. Also, the empenadas were average at best. I would most likely not come back.",3.0
"The place is great. They are super friendly! The first time I went with some of my friends it was close to closing time. Our server got us complimentary drinks before the bar closed.Their arroz con pollo was good but their ahi sauce made it awesome. I liked it sooo much I bought a bottle of their sauce. Their sangrias are really good but their sangritas (margarita/ sangria combo)  are awesome. They have great daily specials. Since then I have gone back a few times and each time the place is packed, with good reason.  My only issue is that their drinks are pretty small. :/ 100% Recommend this place. :)",5.0
For brunch only.Mmmm so good!  I love brunch food and so I was pleasantly surprised when dropping in at Bogota on a Saturday morning with a friend.  I ordered french toast stuffed with plaintains - omg so delish and definitely a first for me.  It was love at first bite!There were so many tasty sounding dishes that I know I definitely need to come back.,4.0

"I had a great experience here. The staff was attentive and friendly. The food was nice and hot and not to mention...DELICIOUS . It tends to get crowded, so its best to get there early or make reservations. The only reason I am taking off a star is because the drinks were not strong. However, they were more than happy to add a little more liquor once I asked if they could. Other than that I loved it here and it will definitely be a go to spot.",4.0
"It's always happy hour at Bogota (well until 11 p.m. on weeknights anyway), and they don't skimp on the pours. I enjoyed both the minty, limey, and thankfully not too sweet pomegranate mojito and the Brazilian sangria with red wine, cachaca, and strawberries.  Minus one star because it is always uncomfortably crowded and busy in here, which brings with it the concomitant problem of being ignored by busy bartenders. Walking in on a Tuesday night around 8:15, I was told that the wait would be forty-five minutes, so I sat down at the bar and was not acknowledged right away. I tried to order the drink I knew I wanted when I was handed the menu, but the bartender refused to take the request until she handed off napkins and silverware to a busboy and did a few other tasks. Even if she wasn't going to make my drink right away, I don't see the problem in taking note of the order. My friend found the hostess to be a little bit ""saucy"" when she informed us that they will not seat incomplete parties. Once we got to our table, our waiter was fantastic. The fried plaintain chips with bottled, house-made Aji sauce were a good starter.

"I'm rounding off to 3 just because the service was really friendly. I have to admit that Yelp! overrated this place. But, I should say that I've only been there once and it was for brunch. The happy hour during brunch on Sunday is actually quite good, however, after having a rather bland Bloody Maria I skipped out on any more drinks. There was no kick in my drink, it tasted like straight tomato juice and tequila, how about some horseradish and black pepper guys???  Anyhow, I had the Daisy's eggs, my crew had the crawfish tacos, and I forget the name of the actual dish my bestie had, but it was just eggs, an arepa with a square of cheese, beans and rice. As far as my actual eggs, no complaints there, but they gave me a side salad that was very uninteresting and didn't come with any dressing. I threw some of that ""aji"" sauce the place raves about, but it was just watered down, vinegary, green salsa that didn't do much for my salad. The fish tacos were okay, no complaints from the friend who ordered them, but once again he had a strange slaw that he didn't think complemented the dish. I tried it and it was pineapple flavored which was fine, but a strange accompaniment to fish tacos. My bestie's dish was bland too, I tried her beans & rice and there was no flavor. Her arepa was a dry, fat tortilla. I never had an arepa before so that was a disappointing first. She said her eggs were good, though. So, in the end, they make good eggs? I make good eggs too and I don't charge. I don't think i'll be back for brunch, but if I'm in the area, I guess the happy hour is worth checking out and I can't diss the dinner menu...

"One of my new go-to's when I'm craving some Colombian & Latin fare. Why didn't anyone tell me about happy hour here? $6 for Caipirinhas? Oh damn. Home cooked, Latin deliciousness. Massive menu, and a ton of vegetarian options. Great drink menu and full bar. Festive music, back faux-outdoor deck, seems like it's always a party here.I'm glad I was invited.So here we go.Plantain chips with aji sauce. A staple... and damn tasty.Papas criolla--yummy roasted mini potatoes, simple and perfect with the creamy spicy mayo dipping sauce.Sweet potato black bean quinoa cakes with sides of tostones and gallo pinto. The cakes were fluffy, hearty, smoky, sweet and spicy. Definitely flavorful and well balanced. The tostones and gallo pinto perfectly rounded out my plate... which I couldn't finish. The portions are pretty huge.For dessert we ordered the Xangos--cheesecake taquito with cinnamon sugar and vanilla ice cream. That's all you need to know. Decadent? Oh yes. Delicious? Oh hell yes. Despite the fact that I couldn't finish my entree--we so polished this one off. And left very, very happy... and full. Happy hour = Caipirinha + caipirinha + caipiroska = ¡buenas noches!",4.0
"Went here for lunch in the afternoon.  The restaurant is very festive and has the latin theme through the restaurant. The service is good and and the place looks clean.  The menu had a variety of food that includes multiple Latin cultures.  We had empanadas and guacamole with chips for appetizers.  Both were good.  My friend enjoyed his tortilla soup which he said was very filling.  For the meal, I had skirt steak with yellow rice and black beans.  The meal was accompanied with green ahi sauce but I thought the sauce was bland, kind if disappointing.  The food tasted ok but left me kind of bloated.  The total bill for 3 of us was $107 which I thought was pricey, but I'm not from Brooklyn.  Both reasons is why I gave a 3 rating.",3.0
"I was not very impressed with this place. I think the menu has too many items which makes it hard to choose -- a simpler menu would be better. I ordered several appetizers and I believe they were too oily. Also, the place is pricey. Even though we ordered mostly appetizers, the bill was on the high side. The white arepas were tasteless and were not worth the money. Also, the empenadas were average at best. I would most likely not come back.",3.0
"The place is great. They are super friendly! The first time I went with some of my friends it was close to closing time. Our server got us complimentary drinks before the bar closed.Their arroz con pollo was good but their ahi sauce made it awesome. I liked it sooo much I bought a bottle of their sauce. Their sangrias are really good but their sangritas (margarita/ sangria combo)  are awesome. They have great daily specials. Since then I have gone back a few times and each time the place is packed, with good reason.  My only issue is that their drinks are pretty small. :/ 100% Recommend this place. :)",5.0
For brunch only.Mmmm so good!  I love brunch food and so I was pleasantly surprised when dropping in at Bogota on a Saturday morning with a friend.  I ordered french toast stuffed with plaintains - omg so delish and definitely a first for me.  It was love at first bite!There were so many tasty sounding dishes that I know I definitely need to come back.,4.0

"I had a great experience here. The staff was attentive and friendly. The food was nice and hot and not to mention...DELICIOUS . It tends to get crowded, so its best to get there early or make reservations. The only reason I am taking off a star is because the drinks were not strong. However, they were more than happy to add a little more liquor once I asked if they could. Other than that I loved it here and it will definitely be a go to spot.",4.0
"It's always happy hour at Bogota (well until 11 p.m. on weeknights anyway), and they don't skimp on the pours. I enjoyed both the minty, limey, and thankfully not too sweet pomegranate mojito and the Brazilian sangria with red wine, cachaca, and strawberries.  Minus one star because it is always uncomfortably crowded and busy in here, which brings with it the concomitant problem of being ignored by busy bartenders. Walking in on a Tuesday night around 8:15, I was told that the wait would be forty-five minutes, so I sat down at the bar and was not acknowledged right away. I tried to order the drink I knew I wanted when I was handed the menu, but the bartender refused to take the request until she handed off napkins and silverware to a busboy and did a few other tasks. Even if she wasn't going to make my drink right away, I don't see the problem in taking note of the order. My friend found the hostess to be a little bit ""saucy"" when she informed us that they will not seat incomplete parties. Once we got to our table, our waiter was fantastic. The fried plaintain chips with bottled, house-made Aji sauce were a good starter. I tried the catfish tacos, which was a very generous portion of fried catfish with salsa, wrapped in a flour tortilla (one gripe I have is that I wish they used fresh tortillas instead of the packaged kind one can buy in Key Foods) with a choice of two sides.

It was fresh (at 8pm!) and VERY tasty. For cocktails I had two guava mojito (hehe I think) and bf had the Corona/margarita combo.

"First time here so I didn't know what to expect. On arrival, I checked out the menu flyers which were handedly available outside the joint. Having spent 17 months in Bogota, Colombia working in the US Embassy in 2006-2007 I did have a good idea about food menu items, so I quickly took a look to ensure the food served there was authentic enough, as I remember in my days in Colombia. My son and I decided to give it a try.  There was a waiting line, after signing in.  I guess this was to be expected, the place looked more crowed than it really was due to it's small size.  Other than this, the experience of dinning here was nice.  The top 3 likes were: the authentic setting and décor, the ambience, the friendly service.  The top 3 dislikes were: a little cramp, a little pricey ( an ajiaco stew was $16 without the white rice. The White rice had to be purchased as a side item.  I could get this same deal if I were in Colombia for around $5 US dollors.  I do recognize I wasn't in Colombia.) and thirdly, I don't believe the owners of this place were Colombians at all.  That is just my suspicion. Although the cooks seemed to be.  All in all my two soups, two beverages, a side of rice and a side of Tostones came out to $38.00! My friends, we are talking soup here!I did leave a $10 tip to the waitress, her name was Kaitty, and she was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  I do recommend it, if you are not on a budget and don't mind the waiting.",3.0
"Last night my boyfriend and I walked over to Bogota just to get some drinks and watch the soccer match. It was 11:30 and even though there were still people at the bar drinking (the bar had only 2 chairs open) and still people eating dinner in the restaurant, the barmaid said ""sorry we're closed"" and wouldn't serve us. This is the second time Bogota has been unaccommodating to us in a way that doesn't even inconvenience them. The last time was when they had porkchops on the menu but for some reason the wouldn't make fried porkchops for us.Because fried porkchops weren't on the menu THAT DAY but would be again soon.

"These guys have a great happy hour (which actually seems to be all hours of the day) with drink specials. Mondays they have 1/2 off bottles of wine (which are regularly priced 28 to 36 bucks!). Decent food. I lived in Venezuela growing up and it's pretty similar. My parents visited recently and we ate/drank there.

"We wanted to have a semi-celebratory meal before an event at BAM.  Mission: to eat something delicious without breaking the bank, and in a timely fashion.  We decided on Bogota due to the authentic-looking menu and variety of options, from combining a selection of appetizers to savoring a house specialty.  The happy-hour beers for $3 also helped.Once we arrived, I realized I'd been here before, for a friend's rehearsal dinner that was super tasty.  So I knew we were in for a treat, starting with the generous (free) bag of plantain chips, dipped in the chipotle mayo on the table.  I went for the xim xim (seafood stew), hubs got a sampler of empanadas, our friends happily ordered the veggie plate and quinoa cakes.  We had to rush to make our event, but the staff was cool with bringing the check with the food and keeping our water filled and checking to see that all was well.  I slurped my perfectly spicy broth, redolent with squid, fish, shrimp, peppers and tomato.  I barely did justice to the huge side of nicely sauteed kale, and the rice side was good in the stew.  We all wished for more time to savor, and pledged to come back and due justice to the grand flavors and relaxed setting.",4.0

"Great food but horrible service. I was with a party of 9 and spent almost $600.00 on the meal. When we received the bill, we discovered the guacamole and chips that the waiter gave us we were charged for. When we explained to the manager that if we knew that we were going to charged for it we would not have accepted it. Each person in our party ordered an appetizer, so there was no reason for us to have ordered something that we didn't want. Well we were insulted and told that we should have known and it would be tacky for the waiter to tell it us it that we would be charged for it. So disappointed in the managements attitude. We were spoken to as if we were trying to skip out on a bill. I don't appreciate being charged for something that I didn't order. The waiter implied it was complimentary for the table. The staff was rude. Such a shame because the food was absolutely delicious.",2.0
"First time here so I didn't know what to expect. On arrival, I checked out the menu flyers which were handedly available outside the joint. Having spent 17 months in Bogota, Colombia working in the US Embassy in 2006-2007 I did have a good idea about food menu items, so I quickly took a look to ensure the food served there was authentic enough, as I remember in my days in Colombia. My son and I decided to give it a try.  There was a waiting line, after signing in.  I guess this was to be expected, the place looked more crowed than it really was due to it's small size.  Other than this, the experience of dinning here was nice.  The top 3 likes were: the authentic setting and décor, the ambience, the friendly service.  The top 3 dislikes were: a little cramp, a little pricey ( an ajiaco stew was $16 without the white rice. The White rice had to be purchased as a side item.  I could get this same deal if I were in Colombia for around $5 US dollors.  I do recognize I wasn't in Colombia.) and thirdly, I don't believe the owners of this place were Colombians at all.  That is just my suspicion. Although the cooks seemed to be.  All in all my two soups, two beverages, a side of rice and a side of Tostones came out to $38.00! My friends, we are talking soup here!I did leave a $10 tip to the waitress, her name was Kaitty, and she was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  I do recommend it, if you are not on a budget and don't mind the waiting.",3.0
"Last night my boyfriend and I walked over to Bogota just to get some drinks and watch the soccer match. It was 11:30 and even though there were still people at the bar drinking (the bar had only 2 chairs open) and still people eating dinner in the restaurant, the barmaid said ""sorry we're closed"" and wouldn't serve us. This is the second time Bogota has been unaccommodating to us in a way that doesn't even inconvenience them. The last time was when they had porkchops on the menu but for some reason the wouldn't make fried porkchops for us.Because fried porkchops weren't on the menu THAT DAY but would be again soon. How hard could it be?We're never going there again.",1.0

"I have to admit, I returned 5 times in 2 weeks after my first experience at Bogota.  The service is amazing, the drinks are strong and the food is scrumptious. I usually go with a group of friends and order pitchers of Mojito's. Their Caipirinha's are dangerous- I recommend eating a full meal when ordering a pitcher of them, or you'll be seeing ""Bogota Bogota Bistro Bistro"" in a matter of minutes (and most likely praying to the porcelain god later on in the evening). The mojito royale is amazing, who thought mint and champagne would work so well together?Their empanadas are cooked perfectly, a bit golden brown and crispy on the crust, soft and saucy on the inside. The goat cheese and the bacalao are my favorites.  I would try an Arepa (made with the right cheese), you won't want it any other way afterwards. If you order the patacon, ask for extra aji on the side (you'll look like a pro). I'm not a fan of their chicharrones, because I prefer the Cuban way of frying them. I also would stay away from their quinoa cakes (even if you're a veggie). Their ropa vieja is also a crowd pleaser, and the portion is massive.They play live music on Wednesdays and Thursdays, have a happy hour all night on Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday, and are always packed for dinner, doesn't that say something?They passed the best test of all: I brought my Colombian friends, and they LOVED it!Just try not to have a craving for Colombian food on a Tuesday, you'll be sorely disappointed (they're closed).",4.0

"As far as brunch goes, nothing beats Latin brunch. With so many different flavors and textures, it's just a more fun option than the usual eggs, french toast, and canadian bacon. With choices ranging from Mexican, Colombian, and Costa Rican breakfast, to name a few, it can can be a little difficult to decide, but the best thing about Bogota, is that it's all good. Many of the options come with their fried queso blanco, basically a slab of melty, fried cheese. Keep your eyes out for that one, it's amazing.Unofficially, I am on a never-ending quest to find the best Bloody Marys and Bloody Marias (made with tequila instead of vodka). Too often, great brunch spots use what tastes like store bought Bloody Mary mixes that taste like salty, watered down tomato juice. Bogota is not one of those brunch spots. To date, Bogota probably makes my favorite Bloody. With a perfect balance of spice, bite, and accouterments, there's no better spot in Park Slope to get your hair of the dog. Even the coffee's good, but I usually opt to hit Gorilla Coffee a block or two away after brunch. It's a win-win combination of brunch excellence. At the moment, I have no qualms saying that Bogota is my favorite place for brunch. I only wish I could find something half as good in Philadelphia.",5.0

"My friend and I came here for Brooklyn restaurant week and had a fantastic time. It was packed when we got there so we had drinks at the bar. I had the mango caipirinhas and she had the guava mojito. Both drinks were really yummy. The guys next to us ordered empanadas and was tempted to order that too but luckily, that's when our table was ready.For appetizers my friend ordered the Platanos Rellenos and I had the Platanos con Queso. I don't recommend the Platanos con Queso because it was really sweet and should really be served as a side. The Platanos Rellenos was really good and had to stop myself from finishing the dish for my friend. For entree, I had Pernil with rice and beans and tostones. My friend ordered the salmon with rice and beans and salad. Both entrees were delicious but honestly, we were pretty full from the appetizer and drinks that we can barely fit it. I had to stop myself from eating or would be in serious pain later.We had the waiter pack up our dessert because we knew we wouldn't be able to eat it. I snagged a bite of the Tres Leches cake and it was pretty good.The service there was pretty good. Our waiter was super friendly and knew what he was doing. He wasn't pushy for our orders and spaced out our dishes in the perfect amount of time.Highly recommend this place and look forward to coming back for the empanadas.",5.0

I don't recommend the Platanos con Queso because it was really sweet and should really be served as a side. The Platanos Rellenos was really good and had to stop myself from finishing the dish for my friend. For entree, I had Pernil with rice and beans and tostones. My friend ordered the salmon with rice and beans and salad. Both entrees were delicious but honestly, we were pretty full from the appetizer and drinks that we can barely fit it. I had to stop myself from eating or would be in serious pain later.We had the waiter pack up our dessert because we knew we wouldn't be able to eat it. I snagged a bite of the Tres Leches cake and it was pretty good.The service there was pretty good. Our waiter was super friendly and knew what he was doing. He wasn't pushy for our orders and spaced out our dishes in the perfect amount of time.Highly recommend this place and look forward to coming back for the empanadas.",5.0
"Clearly Bogota has what it takes to keep me coming back for more! I have been coming here for years and years and can't believe I've not written a review for it yet!The food is always good.  I've never had anything I didn't like, but am quite partial to the Vegetable Tacos right now.  I love that you get to pick your sides for your entree (I am a fan of the Tostones, Maduros, Steamed Yucca and Green Quinoa especially).Their drinks are pretty rad as well, and the service has always been top-notch.Bogota is great for a casual date and very accommodating for large groups.Overall, its the bees knees.  Check it out!",4.0

Came here for a late brunch on Saturday. Was seated immediately & server was very attentive. Highlight was the fantastic Brazilian sangrias that I had!  And food was delish. Highly recommend.,4.0
"So let me start off by saying that I've never been the biggest fan of Latin food but this place totally blew me away. From the moment we arrived, I thought that the decor of the restaurant was amazing. Everything looked clean and the atmosphere was very relaxing. I ordered the Caribbean breakfast....oh man....soooo delicious. I can't believe I'm saying this, but the scrambled eggs were phenomenal. I never knew scrambled eggs could make me feel so happy after a night of immense drinking. The white bread, forgot what its called, but they were flavorful and crispy...one of the highlights! My other friends ordered the Mexican breakfast, empanadas, and fish tacos. They were just as impressed as I was. My only complaint would be that the service was slow...but it was well worth the wait.Oh yeah, their water is sooo good. I don't know why but the splash of lime was really tasty...I could have been just thirsty from the night before :)",5.0
"The ambiance here is great !Fortunately, so is the food. Came here on  Saturday night and the host, (Carlos I think ?)was very friendly right off the jump. He told me the wait would be 20 minutes. So I left came back in and he remembered my name. That's always a plus for service in my book. Name Recognition. Now to the food. I ordered the pernil with rice and spinach sides. This isn't your typical lets fry everything Spanish restaurant. The food was well prepared and you could taste the quality and freshness. They even offer a gluten free menu. I was feeling a bit tropical so I ordered a pina colada. You get the choice to add fruit ( you won't regret) and it set off the night pretty well. Great service, good food. Nice ambiance",4.0

"I definitely found my go-to Latin food/margarita spot to visit when friends are visiting.  I have been dreaming of the frozen strawberry margaritas for about a week since I had two... and really, since that was the first and last thing I consumed while hanging out at Bogota, it could have colored my experience... but if you take anything from my review, do the same thing, and you'll love Bogota too. One more word about the margaritas.... the frozen deliciousness is sandwiched in the cup by like a freshly made syrupy blood red  (not cheap syrup) strawberry compote.  It was amazing.  I've never had a margarita that good.  Annnywayyy..Onto the food... which was pretty good, I guess.  The goat cheese empanada was very memorable and the guacamole was excellent.  I liked the catfish tacos but the catfish was fried... I tried a piece of steak and that was good, but I hadn't eaten steak in a while so I might not be the best source on that.  The place was crowded, had a great, festive vibe, has amazing, fun drinks and good Latin food.  I think it's a go.  I wish it was closer to my apartment, actually so I could meander over more often during Happy Hour... but that might lead to a problem.",5.0

"Several months ago, I was introduced to Bogota at the 5th Avenue Street Fair.  They were selling goat cheese empanadas which were fantastic and I said I would try the restaurant.Last night, we dined in the restaurant; the dining room and bar had a very good crowd.  Being our first time, we decided to try several small plates including: empanadas, arepas con chicharron, calamari and Colombian fritanga.  It was way too much food!The empanadas are large in size and we would have stopped there since we ordered the sampler that included four.  The goat cheese and chicken were my favorite, with the domino (black bean) close behind!The arepas would have been fine solo; it needed nothing more!  There is a whole list of toppings available for them.  Crazy, we ordered pork chicharron and the Colombian fritanga... guess we were craving some pork!The calamari was an appetizer special; sauteed with balsamic vinegar, grape tomatoes and pine nuts.  Very tasty and served with fried plantain slices.If that wasn't enough, out comes this giant plate of fritanga.  Fried pork everything!  We brought home the rest that is enough for another meal!Diet Mojitos and guava milkshakes were the beverages selected to accompany the meal.  The diet mojito is made with Splenda instead of sugar.  The guava milkshake was tasty, but didn't match the meal. Okay the food was great and the service matched!  Our server Abby was excellent!  She was very informative and attentive, yet not obtrusive!  The other staff we encountered were also GREAT!  Our water glasses were constantly full.  The food runner described the items presented including the sauces.

"So I am no stranger to this establishment.  I went there once about 3 years ago and was hooked ever since. I have had Lunch dates, dinner dates, hosted my sisters birthday dinner and most recently took my parents there ( and yes they enjoyed).     If you are a person who is all about scenery and atmosphere this is the place for you.  They have the indoor seating area which is covered in bursts of warm colors (so you and your friends can feel the latin comfort) and dim lighting (so you all can enjoy the candle light and slowly approaching feelings of liquor that mellows you out) .  For an outting that is supposed to be more intimate, my ultimate favorite place to sit is their outdoor landscape that is still on the inside seating area.  You feel like you are in a beautiful back ally (imagine West Side Story, ""Maria"" Scene) on the fire escape, having a candle lit dinner for 2.If you are strickly about the food.... well then the scenery is a bonus.  All the dishes are great and the drinks, well lets just say they dont hold back on the liquor... but if this is your first time going and its just to try it out then I would assume you would want to play it a little safe meal wise. This being said, I would suggest the PLANTAIN CRUSTED CHICKEN (which comes with 2 sides), YELLOW RICE (I say beans on the side) and THE SWEET PLAINTAINS (I think it is called YUCCA).  As for the beverage a COCONUT MOJITO.With this meal I feel you get alot of flavor, with out diving off the deep end, which allows you to give this resturant a fair shot.The only complaint I have is that the intial seating area is a little tight which can be slightly uncomfortable when they have a large turn out, and can result in overlapping convos from different tables... but thats not something they can control, that just means they are doing well.  I would be more scared if they didnt have any ppl in there.  Customer Service is Great and so is the wait staff and the greeters at the door always welcome you in and give you well wishes on your way out.With all that being said... I give them 4 1/2 stars because im sure there is more to see from this place as they continue to grow.I cant wait to go back... hope to see you there.Michelle B",4.0

I really enjoy the food and atmosphere of this place. I've only had brunch type stuff the french toast was absolutely delicious!

"Ever since I graduated college, I've just gotten way too lazy and can't stomach the commute.  As a result, my stomach misses this place.Their brunch is awesome -- i like that there's lots of dishes and lots of fruity drinks (the guava mojito is my go-to) to choose from, all at an affordable price.  It's the perfect way to start the weekend.And you have to try their coconut flan.  Trust me, you'll make room for it.",5.0
"this was in the heart of park slope, this is walking distance to the barclays center, home of the brooklyn nets, nearby are lots of shops, target, dsw etc., parking can be hard to find in this busy area, we came for lunch, the prices are decent, had the catfish taco, and the fish empanada, they have an enclosed patio, just an extension out back, the store is not that big in width, more in depth and its not so easily noticeable, i think i will go back and try the other things, looks interesting and was not bad",3.0

"3.5. This is a very spacious Colombian restaurant with a patio located in the back of the place. All the tables and chairs in the patio are so close to each other so I was able to hear another customer's conversation clearly.  I do not like that because that lets me I know for sure that the customers sitting near me were able to hear the conversation that I was having with my friend. I would like some privacy.The waiter was friendly and the service was decent, but not spectacular. I ordered the pork chops (main entree, this one is $16) with yellow rice, black beans, and spinach sauteed with garlic. The pork chops were soft and tasty. It was a little bit burnt on the side but I wasn't able to taste it. The rice and beans were pretty good, but I felt that the yellow rice could have been more authentic. Where is the distinct Latin American taste?! I liked the spinach even though there was not even a hint of garlic. I enjoyed the meal overall, but it's definitely not the best Latin American meal I have had (you would have to go to Hispanic mothers for that). For dessert, I had the tres leches cake. I've had way better tres leches cake elsewhere. Overall, Bogota Latin Bistro is a decent restaurant with decent service and food.",3.0

This being said, I would suggest the PLANTAIN CRUSTED CHICKEN (which comes with 2 sides), YELLOW RICE (I say beans on the side) and THE SWEET PLAINTAINS (I think it is called YUCCA).  As for the beverage a COCONUT MOJITO.With this meal I feel you get alot of flavor, with out diving off the deep end, which allows you to give this resturant a fair shot.The only complaint I have is that the intial seating area is a little tight which can be slightly uncomfortable when they have a large turn out, and can result in overlapping convos from different tables... but thats not something they can control, that just means they are doing well.  I would be more scared if they didnt have any ppl in there.  Customer Service is Great and so is the wait staff and the greeters at the door always welcome you in and give you well wishes on your way out.With all that being said... I give them 4 1/2 stars because im sure there is more to see from this place as they continue to grow.I cant wait to go back... hope to see you there.Michelle B",4.0
"Went there with bunch of friends on a late Sat afternoon.  Enjoyed  the place, the back where they have extra seating kinda sorta gives you a more tropical feeling.  Food was great.  Had a cubano and enjoyed it very much.  There was an offer for a free appitizer on yelp and we just showed the screen to our server and she got us the dish.   Prices are reasonable, food was good and and service was good as well.  Friendly, helpful, clean and delicious.  What more can you as for?G",4.0
I really enjoy the food and atmosphere of this place. I've only had brunch type stuff the french toast was absolutely delicious! I've always received excellent friendly service and the drinks are always on point! This is a great place to go with the girls for brunch and they also have excellent happy hour prices. Give them a try...oh wait before I go THE EMPANADAS ARE DIVINE!!,4.0
I just went here for brunch for the first time... and I remembered how much I love this place in general. Try Daisy's Eggs... it was delicious. I had a hard time choosing from the menu. The French Toast is great too. I love love love this place!!,5.0
"Ever since I graduated college, I've just gotten way too lazy and can't stomach the commute.  As a result, my stomach misses this place.Their brunch is awesome -- i like that there's lots of dishes and lots of fruity drinks (the guava mojito is my go-to) to choose from, all at an affordable price.  It's the perfect way to start the weekend.And you have to try their coconut flan.  Trust me, you'll make room for it.",5.0
"this was in the heart of park slope, this is walking distance to the barclays center, home of the brooklyn nets, nearby are lots of shops, target, dsw etc., parking can be hard to find in this busy area, we came for lunch, the prices are decent, had the catfish taco, and the fish empanada, they have an enclosed patio, just an extension out back, the store is not that big in width, more in depth and its not so easily noticeable, i think i will go back and try the other things, looks interesting and was not bad",3.0
"Great place!  Went here for a wedding dinner and had a wonderful experience. The food was excellent, we had stuffed plantains and a pork entree.  The sangria was a great as well.  I would definitely come back here for an a la carte dining experience.",4.0
"3.5. This is a very spacious Colombian restaurant with a patio located in the back of the place. All the tables and chairs in the patio are so close to each other so I was able to hear another customer's conversation clearly.  I do not like that because that lets me I know for sure that the customers sitting near me were able to hear the conversation that I was having with my friend. I would like some privacy.The waiter was friendly and the service was decent, but not spectacular. I ordered the pork chops (main entree, this one is $16) with yellow rice, black beans, and spinach sauteed with garlic. The pork chops were soft and tasty. It was a little bit burnt on the side but I wasn't able to taste it. The rice and beans were pretty good, but I felt that the yellow rice could have been more authentic. Where is the distinct Latin American taste?! I liked the spinach even though there was not even a hint of garlic. I enjoyed the meal overall, but it's definitely not the best Latin American meal I have had (you would have to go to Hispanic mothers for that). For dessert, I had the tres leches cake. I've had way better tres leches cake elsewhere. Overall, Bogota Latin Bistro is a decent restaurant with decent service and food.",3.0

"4 stars, their current average rating, is about fair.  Bogota rarely disappoints, yet rarely sets your world alight.  Latin American cuisine with an emphasis on Colombia, it has McDonald's like consistency (that's a compliment), and time and time again churns out hearty, soul warming dishes with bomb ass cocktails that knock you on your arse at a reasonable price.  Their Ropa Vieja, Arroz con Pollo & Lobster Quesadilla are forces to be reckoned with, and the chips and guac are the best in the hood.  Atmosphere is fun, relaxed (in a South American street party way) and warm.  Service is a hard sale if ever I saw one, but as professional as these places come.",4.0
"Came here after reading so many of my Yelp friend's review of the place, coupled with a recommendation from a friend. Decided to venture here after work with one of my friends for after work. So when we arrived around 7:30, it was already bustling for a Wednesday evening. Which I of course didnt mind. I had to start off with a cocktail, and frozen strawberry margarita it is. We went on one of those scorching June days and that definitely hit the spot. My friend decided on a glass of wine, which was fine. They started us off with complimentary plantain chips which was great to nibble on, since this chica was definitely hungry. We ordered appetizers, I tried the chicken empanada and he had the calamari. I have to say the empanada was delish and I couldnt resist their addictive sauce, which I think I added to everything. LOL. As far as entrees: I has the arroz con pollo which was delicious and I did sprinkle some aji sauce on.(wink). My friend had the pecan crusted salmon, with yucca and ummm he did clean his plate as well. We were a little too stuffed for dessert but we definitely enjoyed my meal.",3.0
"Drinks:Mojito and Lemonade is on the sour side. Enjoyed it.Food:The menu online isn't the same as the one at the restaurant. But I believe we had the sweet plantains (dipped in brown sugar) with butter and cream to start off.  My party didn't like it, though I liked it. For entree my friend ordered the guava-stuffed chicken which sounded nice, but wasn't as great on our palate. I had the plantain encrusted chicken. The chicken was very tender and wasn't dry at all. The plantain added a pizzaz to the chicken and the sauce added a kick to the meat. Also ordered the platter, which came with beans, egg, fries, rice, and steak. Steak was too thoroughly cook and was a bit on the dry side. For dessert we had the Tres Leches Cake which was incredibly delicious. Portion was generous, strawberries were fresh, and cake was very moist. Service:We were still waiting on a friend who came in around an hour later. The waiter was very friendly and wasn't impatient at all. Often times he'll come over and check up on us and ask if we wanted any appetizers to start off. Staff was very friendly, though a bit slow when we ordered our entrees.Overall, service + food made me a very happy customer.",4.0

It is a tad  expensive at $18, but the price tag is easily justified by the sheer amount of food that comes with the order.

"I love this restaurant.  Whenever I have come here it has been a wonderful mix of fantastic food, great drinks, and great conversation.  The great conversation obviously has nothing to do with the restaurant, but rather with the company I enjoy while I'm there.  So the five stars has nothing to do with the great friends I happen to have.I have been here at least five times.  The entrees, all that I've had, have been healthy, delicious, fresh, hot, and have well exceeded my expectations.  I love that the menu acknowledges vegetarians and vegans, and lets such ones know which items on the menu are friendly to those who have made such dietary choices.  I love that the vegetarian options are plentiful.  I love that the side dishes are amazing, and then I get to choose which ones I want.  It's harder every time.  Do I get the cilantro mashed potatoes again?  They were so good last time.  Do I branch out and try something new?  But I really want the potatoes too!!!  Argh.  It's a tough one.  The last time I came I tried the mojito here.  It was fantastic.  Apparently this restaurant is known for the mojitos.  I also tasted my friend's pomegranate margarita.  Also superb.Another great evening here, as they all have been.  It is probably the restaurant I would most likely choose if a bunch of friends were all going to dinner together.  Can't wait to go back.",5.0

The servers had tons of energy and friendly. Sean introduced me to Bogota after our day in Coney Island. We wanted to get a snack, so we came here. I had a passion fruit shake, and it was a little too watered down. Then I had an arepa (corn) Chocolo with queso blanco cheese. It's a Columbian version of a Venezuelan Cachapa. It was pretty good. Made me miss the ones in Orlando though!!I would like to come back and enjoy a full meal here one day soon.",4.0

"I've been here too many times to count, and it gets better every time I go.  I love the atmosphere, and my waiter Luis was truly a gem.  The homemade plantain chips with the aji sauce (which they now bottle and sell for 5 bucks) is to die for.  I had the blueberrry caipirinha and of course I couldn't NOT get the empanadas.  I had the bacalao and the beef.  For my main course I had the chipotle corn crusted salmon with kale and fried yucca.  The flavors were spot on and my salmon was cooked to a perfect medium.  I finished off with a molten chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream and strawberry mint salsa.  I left Bogota with a full stomach, a carrot cake to go, and a bottle of aji sauce.  So if you are in town from out of town, or visiting Bogota for the trillionth time, you will never be disappointed.  I'm not even gonna talk about the brunch *in my whisper voice*....its awesome!",5.0

"We enjoyed the restaurant and its atmosphere. For appetizers we had the Platanos Rellenos, it was delicious. For the entrees my boyfriend had the Ropa Vieja, he thought it was delicious and truly enjoyed his meal. I had the Arroz con pollo, it was OK. I thought it was a little too salty and dry. Overall we enjoyed the restaurant and our experience and would return.",4.0
"Exceptional service, waitstaff is quick, courteous and efficient.  Busboys on the ball with filling our waters, nice demeanor and fast removal of completed dishes.  Our table of 4 ordered a empanada sampler along with a complimentary papa criolla (small potato bites) with dipping sauce.  Fast fast fast service and execution with our somewhat complex drinks (ginger caiprahina, diet mojitios, coconut mojitios), all 4 drinks were perfect.  The main course we ordered, the classic yet satisfying arroz con pollo, the staple of Colombian cuisine was fantastic, I ordered the skirt steak with a side salad.  Very generous portions for the price, ate half took half home.  As a frequent visitor and fan of Bogota I am always greeted on a firt name basis, aside from the fact that there are over 125 people In the restaurant, the staff, managers take the time to greet you and address any needs you may have which in most cases are none because bogota is always on the ball with service.  Til next time, thank you.",5.0
"This place never disappoints. They are always packed but the wait is never too bad. We usually spend the waiting time in the front by the bar. The waiters are always friendly and helpful. The street corn and the empanadas are a must... Sooo yummy!!!! The fish tacos here are amazing. Overall, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.",4.0

"Here's the trick: DON'T have high hopes for this place. Forget that Yelp is more-or-less urging you to go there.  That's what we did, and we ended up loving it.We went for a brunch on a Saturday in June.  I was expecting lines - I thought I read that is was a super popular place in Park Slope - but there was no one at the bar, and only about 8 tables seated inside.  We were told outside was full, but we came to the conclusion later that they were probably just trying to fill up the inside a little.I was sick, so was not drinking, and our waitress wasn't too pleased about that.  Too bad she had to let it be known.  =(BUT, then the food started coming.  Oh, man, this place is really good.  I saw another table with the fish tacos, and asked if the order included 1 or 2.  It came with 2 and a side of surprising salad (you'll see), and plantain bites.  The tacos were SO good, and very light and fresh despite containing fried fish.  My wife got the Columbian breakfast.  HUGE.  Huge plate full of probably 5 or 6 eggs, and good rice, along with 2 ho-hum empty arepas.The Flan, sadly, is NOT flan as you'd expect.  It's more like a boring bread-like sweet dessert.  But the tres leches!  Oh my God, the tres leches.  If you love almond flavor (think marzipan), you'll be in heaven!The atmosphere is great in there, too.  Really, fun, and modern, mixed with local-slice-of-life stuff on the walls.  And plenty of room.  I'm so glad to find a restaurant that isn't cramming 100 seats in a space for 60.We'll be back again and again.  I'm sure.",4.0

It was OK.  i wans't too impressed with my food's flavor.  I had the steak.  We got there really late.. and half the menu was not available.  so maybe they were rushing or something... We plan to go for brunch..  Maybe i'll love it then.,3.0

The plantains were nice and soft and they had this sweetness to them. I also had Colombian stew chicken. It didn't woow me but it was good.

I know it might sound as a weird combo to some, but it was really really good!! My friend had empanadas which I tasted and they were great, it was like a mouth-gasm.

"Love love LOVE this place. My boyfriend and I moved to Park Slope a few months ago and were yelping around trying to find good Latin food. THIS is the best.The first time we went for brunch. Started with guacamole, of course, which was out of this world.  The bf had the Colombian breakfast and I had the Latin breakfast with a side of coconut french toast. The portions were huge and left us completely satisfied. I also pounded down a couple DELICIOUS pomegranate mojitos [only $5 at brunch] with fresh muddled limes, mint and pomegranate seeds. And although the drinks looked petite, they packed a punch that caught up with me quickly.During dinner hours they bring complimentary plantain chips with homemade salsa. Which is kind of sweet and spicy almost reminiscent of a Latin duck sauce. Strange, but quite tasty. We've been back for dinner a few times since. Did i mention $5 drinks ALL NIGHT mon-wed? The only reason I wouldn't give them 5 stars, is they seem to be a bit understaffed at times. A few times we've waited up to 10 minutes to be greeted, have drinks delivered, etc. So, maybe not the best place to grab a quick bite..but certainly the best place to grab everything else.",4.0
This place has so many good reviews so I decided to try it. It was americanized. My boyfriend and I ordered the bandeja paisa. It was bland and definitely too pricey.

"Nice to come across a Colombian restaurant.  These are impossible to find at home.  We both had the platter as it came with everything we wanted - chicharron, skirt steak, white arepa - basically all the staples.  The menu is very interesting and varied.  The food was excellent and I can't find any fault with it.  Service was great but our waitress was essentially non-existent after she brought our food out.  Granted, more people came in but she also passed our table everytime en route to somewhere else.  We basically went empty on water/drinks at this juncture.  We were failed to be informed that drinks do NOT come with refills and I understood why she only refilled our teas once after they went empty - 4 iced teas = $9.00.  Ouch.  These faults aside, it was a wonderful dining experience.",4.0
"HELPFUL THING TO KNOW, they don't take reservations after 6pm.   There were 25+ of us, and we all sat down after about an hour of waiting and being broken up in to tables.  We all got in the back room except a group of four, who had a nice time too.  The hostess kept a nervous but genuine smile at all times and treated us with respect. Although we chanted along to various random songs and played a hood trivia game really loudly.Overall: I loved it!It was suggested as a replacement for Sea.  Not the same cuisine, look or anything.But the music was way better. Latin house, cumbia, merengue in a totally non-Caribbean way, which is refreshing actually.Decor reminds me of a spanish mix of Chili's / Brother Jimmy's.Food!  Was dopeeeee.It's basically regular spanish food but with a gourmet vibe.  I ordered ropa vieja with yellow rice, salad and tostones.  The ropa vieja was drier looking than I expected but juicy tasting.  Rice was cool.  Salad was in a nice balsamic vinegar based dressing.  Tostones came with an amazing, unbelievably garlicky sauce.  It wasn't butter / oil garlic.  I don't know what it was.  But I woke up with garlic breath like crazy.  After a full hygiene routine at night.Drinks!  Yes!I had-sangrita (margarita mix & sangria) simple but so effective.-amor de mora (blackberries, aguardiente Cristal, vodka I think) delicious, but not popular among my friends, the said it was cough mediciney-Costa Rica...it's delicious, think midori sour but not so sour...delicious-midori sour lol",5.0
"Finally came here for brunch.  I think I must have been the last person to know about this place.  This place has a huge restaurant, and we walked in there with 8 people with no reservation on a Sunday, and walked right in.  The service was really wonderful, and the food was good too.  Four of us all ordered Daisy's eggs which was really tasty.  My only criticism was that the yucca fries were not in fact fries, but more like yucca hash.  The drinks were strong, the coffee was stronger, and the place really makes you feel like you are in Bogota (although what do I know?  I have never been).  I can't imagine someone having a bad experience.  For all you egg haters, there is a very large egg menu, so you may want to stick to lunch if eggs are not your thing.  (someone at our table did get the waffles which looked good as wel!)",4.0

"Finally came here for brunch.  I think I must have been the last person to know about this place.  This place has a huge restaurant, and we walked in there with 8 people with no reservation on a Sunday, and walked right in.  The service was really wonderful, and the food was good too.  Four of us all ordered Daisy's eggs which was really tasty.  My only criticism was that the yucca fries were not in fact fries, but more like yucca hash.  The drinks were strong, the coffee was stronger, and the place really makes you feel like you are in Bogota (although what do I know?  I have never been).  I can't imagine someone having a bad experience.  For all you egg haters, there is a very large egg menu, so you may want to stick to lunch if eggs are not your thing.  (someone at our table did get the waffles which looked good as wel!)",4.0

"Went back for dinner and it was even better than my first visit. The waiter recommended some drinks and they were great (sangrita and brazil sangria).

I had the Bandeja Pais (Colombian Platter) and it was exactly what i wanted...the steak was cooked perfectly and was great dipped in the aji sauce. It also came with beans, rice with a fried egg on top, a pickled red cabbage and slice of avacado, sweet plantains, chicharron on top of an arepa. For dessert, I went for the banana bread pudding and it was hugeeee...had to pack most of it home. Overall, it was another great experience!

"Came here for take out for tacos once and they were good. So my husband and I decided to stop in for happy hour on a Sunday for some afternoon drinks and small bites.

The margarita was perfect for that humid day, the sangria was okay. We then ordered the dip sampler and calamari. Calamari came dark and chewy, like they fried it in old oil and forgot about it. The dips were guacamole, black bean and pico de gallo which came with tortilla and plantain chips...only the black bean had flavor. I'll just come in for drinks next time.",3.0
"Love love love this place. Six of my friends and I came here for ""Ladies Night,"" and left two hours later with our tummies & margarita cravings very satisfied.TIP #1: MAKE A RESERVATION. This place gets crazy. I've tried to come here on two or three separate occasions, and there was always a minimum of an hour and a half wait.TIP #2: SHARE. The food is so good that you will definitely want to try more than 1 or 2 plates. TIP #3: The margaritas & mojitos are awesome. I'm not a big margarita fan, or a big drinker in general, but these were made really well.For an appetizer, almost everyone at our table got the Elote Corn, which I don't actually recommend. You can get a more delicious, and cheaper, version of this at the Red Hook Vendors. For an entree, I shared the Lobster/Cheese Quesadilla and the Catfish Tacos with a friend. The Quesadilla was excellent, and by the end of the meal, everyone was jealous of our tacos, which come with a very generous portion.  They are basically two mini burritos, versus two standard sized tacos.Bogota is a great place for anyone who wants to have fun -- whether with a friend, significant other or big group.

"Man was Bogota good.  I 'd probably give it a 4.5 rating only because the food is fairly simple, but it was such a good experience that it definitely gets rounded up.Bogota is fairly unassuming on the outside, but like a clown car, seems MUCH bigger on the inside.  It was pretty packed for 5:30 on a Saturday (which bodes well), so I would definitely recommend reservations.  The ambiance was fun... kitchy-ness mixed with doeses of classiness combined with a touch of trendiness.  Feels unique.  And not loud.The wait staff was knowledgable, prompt, and helpful... particularly our waiter Luis.  He even humored my dad, who loves to tell facts and stories to anyone who will listen.Most importantly, the food and drink are very good.  I ordered a frozen margarita... my wife the pina colada.  My parents ordered a brazilian beer which tasted like Smithwick's.  We shared the dip sampler (bean dip was surprisingly the best part).  I got the pork marinated in beer.  Yum.  My wife got a tofu steak (I assume yum).  My dad got the colombian sampler (super meat overload yum).  And my mom got the chicken stew (you guessed it, yum).  I'd recommend all these dishes.  Oh, and the side of sweet plantains.  Get that.  Great experience, and I'd suggest going there either for an actual meal or just to grab some drinks and plantains with some friends.  With places like this available, I don't really know why people living in Brooklyn would go to Manhattan for food/drinks.",5.0

"A quality eating establishment in the best borough!My cousin Jax suggested we go here for our last meal of 2007 and oh what a meal it was! I can still taste those heavenly fish tacos. I mean I was drunk. Really drunk. But I'm telling you as Yelp is my witness, these are the BEST fish tacos in town. And I KNOW fish tacos! I come from the land of Wahoo's and I bow to the chef here for their recipe far exceeds So. Cal local fish taco fare.The staff is very accomodating and they look comfortable and cool under the pressure of crazy nights like NYE. Not all that attentive so stick around when you put your name on the wait list and try to figure out what you want right after your drink order is taken. There is a huge bowl of condoms available for the taking in the bathroom, in case you want to bust an Unfaithful in one of the stalls. But try not to offer them to parents of children. (whoops)Just an all around great place to go with friends. Amazing MANGO MOJITO! That alone is worth the trip.Get there.",4.0
"One of my favorite restaurants in Park Slope.My friends normally want to go here for dinner, which is good, but I really like the brunch as well.  Whenever you go, go for the traditional dishes, or house specials.  They have the best green salsa (or maybe that's not even what it's called, but it comes with the arroz con pollo and other dishes), and the empanadas are pretty spectacular.Expect a line, but the place is pretty big so it's not usually too long.  Get a coconut mojito at the bar while you wait.The only thing I really don't like about this place, is the volume level.  I really wish they'd turn down the music (I love it, but just not that loud).",4.0
"As a culinary student; you tend to be more vigilant. The biggest thing I liked the most about this restaurant is how the staff pays attention to your needs. Before you can even ask for more water, they are already filling it up or following up on anything else you may need. The entire staff are real friendly & charasmatic. I loved the food & I always end up splitting my plate with someone else bcuz of the quantity. I've already recommended this spot to my friends & family ;-)",4.0

"Man was Bogota good.  I 'd probably give it a 4.5 rating only because the food is fairly simple, but it was such a good experience that it definitely gets rounded up.Bogota is fairly unassuming on the outside, but like a clown car, seems MUCH bigger on the inside.  It was pretty packed for 5:30 on a Saturday (which bodes well), so I would definitely recommend reservations.  The ambiance was fun... kitchy-ness mixed with doeses of classiness combined with a touch of trendiness.  Feels unique.  And not loud.The wait staff was knowledgable, prompt, and helpful... particularly our waiter Luis.  He even humored my dad, who loves to tell facts and stories to anyone who will listen.Most importantly, the food and drink are very good.  I ordered a frozen margarita... my wife the pina colada.  My parents ordered a brazilian beer which tasted like Smithwick's.  We shared the dip sampler (bean dip was surprisingly the best part).  I got the pork marinated in beer.  Yum.  My wife got a tofu steak (I assume yum).  My dad got the colombian sampler (super meat overload yum).  And my mom got the chicken stew (you guessed it, yum).  I'd recommend all these dishes.  Oh, and the side of sweet plantains.  Get that.  Great experience, and I'd suggest going there either for an actual meal or just to grab some drinks and plantains with some friends.  With places like this available, I don't really know why people living in Brooklyn would go to Manhattan for food/drinks.",5.0

"I found this restaurant by accident with my boyfriend, his friend, and my boyfriend's brother and it wad AMAZING.  The empanadas are probably the best I've ever had.  They're so flavorful and they're not greasy.  The first time we went we couldn't believe how good they were.  The second time it was just me and my boyfriend and they were good but nothing like the first time.  My boyfriend was so curious as to why they were so good the previous time that he asked the waitress who was working and who made them the last time.  We found out his name was Carlos.  All I have to say is that Carlos is the man and we always ask if he's working so we know if we should order empanadas.The soups are also really tasty as well.  I get the Chicken Tortilla a lot, which is excellent.  Last time I got the Ajiaco and that was also really good.I've had the patacon before and it was good but it wasn't like a sandwich like I'm usually used to.  Here it was flat with the plantains on the bottom.  I just folded it up and made it like a sandwich anyway.Their Aji sauce really is good on everything.The atmosphere is really fun and the place is good for groups.  It does get pretty busy on weekend nights though so plan accordingly if you have a big group.  They also make you wait until all the members of your party are there before they seat the group.",5.0
"Hands down the BEST Latin food I've ever had, seriously!  I met some friends here for dinner.  #1 - atmosphere is so cool and laid back.  The restaurant itself is pretty eclectic.  Music was pretty good, I found it a little odd that there were condoms in the bathroom, but ummm okay.  #2 - the service left NOTHING to be desired!

"The environment is great and inviting, but I was a bit disappointed about the food. The steak empanadas are great, but the chicken is just okay. The Mexican chorizo arepa is good, but I recommend the Colombian chorizo on the yellow arepa. The price was decent for the empanadas, but the arepas are confusing regarding price.  You buy the arepa and the meat is an additional price on top of the base price.  The main dishes looked overpriced, but I'd have to try them to see if maybe they're better or larger portions.  The service was good, but nothing special.  My water glass was never empty though, which is always a plus.  Also, they really need more sauces.",2.0
"My SO took me here last night for my birthday dinner.  We have always been fans of Bogota, but last nights meal was outstanding.  We got the white arepa with colombian chorizo.  The arepa was okay, but the chorizo was legit.  We also got the coconut mussels.  I couldn't find any reviews about these mussels, but the waiter said they were flavorful.  And they were!  They were really delicious.  On the sweet side, but I don't mind that.  We also ordered the corn encrusted salmon and the garlic rotisserie chicken.  Holy cow.  The chicken was amazing.  Usually I don't choose rotisserie chicken when I go out for a nice meal, but the reviews of this dish were very compelling.  The sauce is incredible.  The corn crust on the salmon was very crispy and the salmon was juicy and fresh.  The chipotle and aji sauces were really good.  We had a lime from the arepa that I squeezed onto the salmon (it needed some citrus).  Notable sides: the red cabbage salad was awesome.  I need to try to recreate this at home and eat it all summer long.  The gallo pinto was simply addicting.  I couldn't stop eating it. I am sad to say that the caipirinhas were too strong for me.  However, the aguardiente shots (which came free if you check it) were actually really nice - anise flavored liquor.  Very smooth.",4.0

"My fave restaurant in all of Park Slope.....so far anyway. It is ALWAYS crowded!! But I take that as a good sign because if its not crowded, that means no one wants to eat there. The Host is great!!

Now on to the food...my mouth is watering. Their guacamole is awesome, you definitely must get the chip sampler, you get to try different kinds of chips and different dipping choices and they are ALL good. The frozen margaritas are quite good and they were only $6 on a Saturday night, so that is not bad at all. I always get the pernil (pork) with yellow rice and black beans and I always love it .

"Ok..so I've been experiencing a little bit of Peter Pan syndrome and have been hittin' the sauce and such a little too hard. I had a hankering for, very specifically, Colombian food! I wanted hot empanadas galor, a savory  onion covered skirt steak, and delicious rice and beans....my mouth still waters thinking about it. Yeah...I didn't get that at all at Bogota! After sitting at the bar and taking down some sangria and a couple of flavored Caipirinha's, our table was finally ready and we ventured on trying a little bit of everything. We started off with:Chicharronnes de Pollo - Essentially chicken tenders latino-style! They were a little TOO deep fried on the outside but the inside was moist and amazing. This was one of my most favorite dishes of the night...but I can get this ANYWHERE. 1 Chicken and 1 Beef Empanada - Thats what we ordered but they decided to serve us  two chicken empanadas. The crust and dipping sauce were really good but the filling was flavorless...sadly flavorlessness was the theme for the night. Shrimp Ceviche - This was actually gross.....there was no flavor at all to this dish and I could've completely done with out. A complete and utter failure on their part...Crab Cakes - This was actually my favorite dish of the night. The crab cakes were amazing actually just on their own, I even tasted a hint of salmon ( I think) and the cake crumbled beautifully when you sliced into them. The mango and cucumber?? slivers at the top really constrated well with the crab meat. Yeah, daddy liked this one alot! So at this point, we're both actually beyond full and I'm on my...I don't know 5 drink or something...yeah I'm pretty ripped at this point and mildly satisfied. Our entrees finally come out and they had a really poor showing: Arroz con Pollo - I was going to order one of the steak options but since I decided to eat my face off in Apps, I decided to exercise some kind of self controla nd go for the smaller option...well I didn't think it was going to be THAT small. Essentially they brought me out what looked like rice, canned chicken meat, and a couple of onions, green peppers, mixed together and thrown on a plate...It came with a side of what I think is cabbage and beat cole slaw which took up the majority of the plate, fried plantains, and black beans. Everything was completely flavorless including the beans (WTF!) I'm only half Latin and even I wanted to get up and toss my plate down the stairs at the cook! It was a monumental failure. Bandeja Paisa - Their version included skirt steak, chicharrones, fried plantains, avocado, and egg, and somethign else I'm forgetting. My friend really liked the chicharonnes and the fried plaintains but....he said that it was just ok. I tasted his steak which just tasted oily, his white rice and red beans were also completely flavorless. I paused a moment as I looked and saw most of the food on my plate. I was very unsatisfid and very very drunk....I reluctantly asked for the food to be packed away and ordered the check at the same time. A word on the service, now for the most part, our waiter was ok. He did forget to bring me 1 of my drinks but he rectified the situation pretty quickly. The problem I have is actually with one of the hostesses who had the audacity, to say to me in tones that you would use with a child, whether I had paid my bar tab. I turned and looked at her and pointed out that if that was the case, the bartender would not have carried over our Sangria to the table. Yeah, she was a little inconsequential to the dining experience and I wouldn't have harped on the poor service if it improved but it really didn't. The only reason why I gave this place 2 stars is because the really cute dark haired bartender makes an awesome drink! Otherwise, pretty decor, slightly pretty staff, but the the food is closer to ok  then good.",2.0

This was one of my most favorite dishes of the night...but I can get this ANYWHERE. 1 Chicken and 1 Beef Empanada - Thats what we ordered but they decided to serve us  two chicken empanadas. The crust and dipping sauce were really good but the filling was flavorless...sadly flavorlessness was the theme for the night. Shrimp Ceviche - This was actually gross.....there was no flavor at all to this dish and I could've completely done with out. A complete and utter failure on their part...Crab Cakes - This was actually my favorite dish of the night. The crab cakes were amazing actually just on their own, I even tasted a hint of salmon ( I think) and the cake crumbled beautifully when you sliced into them. The mango and cucumber?? slivers at the top really constrated well with the crab meat. Yeah, daddy liked this one alot! So at this point, we're both actually beyond full and I'm on my...I don't know 5 drink or something...yeah I'm pretty ripped at this point and mildly satisfied. Our entrees finally come out and they had a really poor showing: Arroz con Pollo - I was going to order one of the steak options but since I decided to eat my face off in Apps, I decided to exercise some kind of self controla nd go for the smaller option...well I didn't think it was going to be THAT small. Essentially they brought me out what looked like rice, canned chicken meat, and a couple of onions, green peppers, mixed together and thrown on a plate...It came with a side of what I think is cabbage and beat cole slaw which took up the majority of the plate, fried plantains, and black beans. Everything was completely flavorless including the beans (WTF!) I'm only half Latin and even I wanted to get up and toss my plate down the stairs at the cook! It was a monumental failure. Bandeja Paisa - Their version included skirt steak, chicharrones, fried plantains, avocado, and egg, and somethign else I'm forgetting. My friend really liked the chicharonnes and the fried plaintains but....he said that it was just ok. I tasted his steak which just tasted oily, his white rice and red beans were also completely flavorless. I paused a moment as I looked and saw most of the food on my plate. I was very unsatisfid and very very drunk....I reluctantly asked for the food to be packed away and ordered the check at the same time. A word on the service, now for the most part, our waiter was ok. He did forget to bring me 1 of my drinks but he rectified the situation pretty quickly. The problem I have is actually with one of the hostesses who had the audacity, to say to me in tones that you would use with a child, whether I had paid my bar tab. I turned and looked at her and pointed out that if that was the case, the bartender would not have carried over our Sangria to the table. Yeah, she was a little inconsequential to the dining experience and I wouldn't have harped on the poor service if it improved but it really didn't. The only reason why I gave this place 2 stars is because the really cute dark haired bartender makes an awesome drink! Otherwise, pretty decor, slightly pretty staff, but the the food is closer to ok  then good.",2.0
"Food is really good! I usually get the Garlic Chicken with a side of Kale.  They oddly do not have this on the lunch menu though, only dinner menu. :(",4.0
Love the mangu (in the Dominican breakfast)! I would only make sure the cheese with the mangu is consistently sliced so it doesn't fry up super crispy and inedible. Love the margaritas! Love the iced coffee mojito which was recommended by our delightful server - it was such a treat! The guacamole is one of the best I have had in a restaurant.,4.0
"This place is awesome. Cheap, delicious Colombian fare coupled with great service. The happy hour specials are awesome.

"This place is good for latin fast food. The atmosphere is fun, the drinks are pretty good and they have a good happy hour menu that on certain nights is extended all night!They automatically provide plaintain chips with a house-made dipping sauce which is good enough to fill you up before you eat a deliciously fried empanada. I tried the portabella quesadilla and it was good. The guava empanada is also good, but it all felt really heavy. Go here and eat a lot when you have a long walk home so you can burn off all of the grease you've just eaten! I'll be back for a lighter meal and definitely the dim, cool atmosphere.",3.0

"Perhaps the best experience I have had here was while sitting at the bar, sipping one of those frankendrinks (frozen marg with Sangria... somehow... delicious) and eating apps.

This place is amazing!!!!!!Three working ladies should never turn down an all-night/mid-week Happy Hour (for A)...and when they make the best red sangria you've had in forever AND it's only $5 a pop AND they have ridiculously tasty tapas that's also relatively on the cheap...please.Do yourself an enormous favor and go to there.  Yesterday.,5.0
"I've been to Bogota Latin Bistro (BLB) many times. I've been to Colombia many times also. BLB doesn't completely get it right in terms of Comida Colombiano, but it's certainly not bad either. Perhaps my only complaint foodwise- the arepas de choclo. They are possibly one of the finest things I've ever eaten (in the shit hole roadside stand outside of Cali international airport) The ones BLB serves are not the type of arepas de choclo I've had. But, the rest of the fare here is quite good, albeit more tex-mex caribeo hispanic food than straight up Colombian. But, I've never had a bad meal here, and the wait staff are very kind and efficient. One of the only other issues I can think of is how fast this place fills up. By 6pm the wait is around 30 minutes and it doesn't abate until much later on in the evening, if at all. So, unless you've got time to kill show up early if your craving their food, or think ahead and make a reservation. Definitely worth going though.",3.0

"Good food. Great drinks. Amazing Service! Last night was the second time I've been to Bogota with my friend Ryan T. who lives in Park Slope. The first thing you notice when you walk into the restaurant is how genuinely happy the entire staff is, from the hostess to the bartender, to the owner... it, at least appears, that they are having a good time and are genuinely happy that we've chosen to eat there. Happiness is such a simple thing, but it means SO much to me and enhances my experience immensely. That happiness is also good for business because I already want to go back and visit them again. I have to give a special compliment to our server John, he's a super cool guy and went out of his way to bring us some cucumber infused vodkas to taste after our meal. My cocktail that evening was a habenero guava margarita. The contrast between the spicy and smooth flavor in this cocktail is quite unique and quite tasty. There were probably 5 more drinks I wanted to taste on the menu. Can't wait to go back and try them all. I had the Mexican chirizo aerapas, which were decent, but not great. Everybody else had a great experience with their dishes. Overall, Bogota has great drinks, a happy staff and good food. Please go check them out if you're in the neighborhood.",4.0
"*sigh*Just got their Valentine's Day reminder email.  Moved to Portland, OR about a year and a half ago and boy do I ever miss this place.  We went so often, they really did know our names.  Brunch, dinner, no matter what, it was always tops.  It's definitely on my list of ""have to's"" whenever I'm back east visiting.  Cheers Bogota, hope you're doing swell without me there on Sundays, drinking a Bloody Maria.",5.0
"I have no self-control when it comes to this place!  Bogota Bistro is, hands-down, my favorite spot for brunch and/or dinner in Brooklyn!  The service is always outstanding (timely and lovely waitstaff), and the food and drinks knock my socks off!  I am hooked on their Brazilian sangria, but they also make a mean mojito.  I have tried a number of things off the menu and have never been disappointed.  Although, I did try the lobster and avocado quesadilla once, and found it to be a bit bland, but I wouldn't say I disliked it.  I just wouldn't order it again.  You can't go wrong with their empanada sampler or arroz con pollo!  They're both absolutely delicious and a great value for the amount of food that you get.  If you have room for dessert, you will drool over their tres leches cake, made with a hint of almond extract and topped with fresh strawberries.  I'm not even a huge fan of tres leches, generally speaking, but no matter how full I am, I always order a piece (now you see why I have no self-control here).  More or less, every time I dine here I leave saying, ""I'm never eating again!""  They always have dinner specials, and a great happy hour, plus the ambiance is nice.  A great place for families, a group of friends, or on a date.  All in all, Bogota Bistro rocks!So, if you're free some evening, or you're looking for a place for brunch on the weekend, stop into Bogota and indulge on great food and a pitcher or two of Brazilian Sangria.  Just make sure you are able to go home and take a nap afterwards (based on personal experience)!",5.0
"My mom was in town from California and I had heard great things about Bogota so we went for dinner last night. I have never been welcomed more kindly and enthusiastically. Everyone from the host to the server to the bus boy. Just incredible. Their menu is very extensive and the waitress was able to make solid, firm recommendations. The ropa vieja is a must try. And their fried plantain chips with Bogota's very own aji sauce hit the spot. I don't traditionally like spicy foods and the jalapeno kick was light enough that I could enjoy it. And happy hour all day Mon-Wed? Will definitely come back to this place. LOVED IT.",4.0
"I blame the fact the restaurant poorly chose the include a mandatory 20 percent gratuity to the tab of everyone check because it was Valentine's Day.Instead of decent food, and good prices, served by friendly knowledgeable staff, we received terrible service and mediocre food.

"Their platanos con queso are to absolutely die for. Been here twice now and both times I've left with my stomach stretched to its maximum capacity. I don't actually have a single bad thing to say. The ambience is awesome, they have delicious margaritas if you find yourself having to wait, and the food is BOMB. The second time I went, we actually paced ourselves so we had room for dessert - we ordered the chocolate lava cake - it's cooked to order (so if you're in a rush, choose something else) and worth every single second we had to wait for it. The arroz con pollo is flavorful and moist, and if you're feeling hungry, go for the bandeja pais - you won't be disappointed.",5.0
"Went here for brunch on easter Sunday - top notch joint!  They have a wide variety of fruity drinks to choose from at semi-reasonable prices.  That is, a plain mojito is $5, a flavored one is $6, and most beers are around $4 - not bad. For appetizer we had a feta cheese empanada which was a great start - not too big but bursting with fried, delicious flavor.  I also had several mojitos and the Daisy's egg's platter, which was essentially eggs mixed with potatoes and chorizo with avacado mash on the side.  Our waitress was super informative and attentive.  The vibe of the place is also really fun.   All-in-all this was one of the best brunches I've ever had and would certainly return.",4.0

"My party and I were nearly 30 minutes late for our reservation but we were seated right away despit it being a packed night.

We had the empanada sampler (beef, chicken, bacalao, and goat cheese) with delicious dipping sauces, plantain-crusted chicken with black beans & rice and maduros, and steak with cilantro mashed potatos & tropical cole slaw. Simply delicious. Drinks weren't very strong so probably would only order them during happy hour but will definitely be returning for that steak! Our server Allison was also great.",5.0
"Walked in by chance. Had some very picky friends in town and didnt want to disappoint. Well Bogota came through. The food was delicious and all 5 of us were swapping bites from each others plates. Cant remember all the names but I got the Plantain chicken with yellow rice and Lentil soup, freaking AMAZING. One person got the fish tacos which i was very skeptical about because ive had some amazing fish tacos in LA and nobodys been able to compete, Bogota fish tacos just might take the reign. And another one got some dish with a big piece of cheese on top of a flat white bread, cant remember the name but that was amazing too, and lastly the nachos were great. Cant believe i looked over this place so many times thinking its kinda crammed looking. Well the space is pretty large, doesnt look like that from the outside, and the service...... oh the service. The waitress was sooooo kind, but not the phony, ""I want a tip"" kind of friendly but genuinely loves what she does and where she is and appreciates good food kind of friendly.

Fried cheescake with ice cream for dessert - fried food living up to its reputation, no complaints whatsoever.  Will be back to work my way down the menu. Oh, and the service was impeccable!

The food was very nice. It's really a great experience to go there. Best to order : combination of their Empanada. specially the goat cheese empanada. and for main course the catfish Tacos are divine ;) The lines can be long for the restaurant. you better make a reservation. they have usually less table for people for two. if you are in group you might get your table a bit easier.

We also had the empanada sampler: beef, goat cheese (favorite!), chicken and guava. Surprisingly, the 4 empanadas, 2 arepas and chips-guac hit the spot for 3 hungry people. Fried cheescake with ice cream for dessert - fried food living up to its reputation, no complaints whatsoever.  Will be back to work my way down the menu. Oh, and the service was impeccable! Prompt, attentive but not overbearing, made own suggestions.. Thanks Bogota. If Colombia is like you, I can't wait to go.",4.0
"I've been here for brunch and now dinner and both experiences were faaaantastic.  The plantain chips served before dinner were delightful, the margaritas were $5 all night long and STRONG, and the food was awesome.  Portions were huge and I ended up having to take more than half of it home with me.  I had the vegetarian plate which came with rice, beans, and 3 sides.  When we got there around 6:30pm, it was fairly empty, but by the time we left the place was absolutely packed (on a Wednesday evening) so I would definitely recommend making a reservation if you plan to go for dinner.From what I remember, the brunch was also great.  The fried sweet plantains were perfect and my little tacos made for the perfect Latin brunch.  I loved the mojitos and the service was prompt and friendly.This is quickly becoming one of my Park Slope favorites.",5.0
The food was very nice. It's really a great experience to go there. Best to order : combination of their Empanada. specially the goat cheese empanada. and for main course the catfish Tacos are divine ;) The lines can be long for the restaurant. you better make a reservation. they have usually less table for people for two. if you are in group you might get your table a bit easier. The drinks are expensive compare to their size of the drink and food prices.,4.0
"I came here after work for dinner prior to going to BK Boulders.  They had the Brooklyn Restaurant Week menu.  I started off with a shrimp ceviche, bendeja paisa, and the coconut flan.  The shrimp ceviche was nice, they gave you very large jump shrimp rather than the cheaper alternative of small chopped up shrimp.  The bendeja paisa was awesome, the steak, chicharron, rice, beans and egg were great.  The rice was especially good since it had chorizo in it as well.  The white arepa however stunk.  I normally don't like flan, but since it had coconut in it I decided to give it a try.  I've gotta say, flan should always have coconut because it made it that much better.  The service at Bogota was standard, they forgot which desert I had but I can't complain since I was happy with the food I was served and  they brought out the right desert immediately.  Beware their plantain chips, I had so much that I couldn't actually finish my dinner, a rare event indeed.",4.0
"The AtmosphereWe went there on a late Sunday night, yet the place was open, welcoming and very much alive.Bogota is a very colorful place. Each wall gets to have a different color. There are tons of decorations all over the place. Some might call it ...distasteful - maybe. But no one would argue that it's boring! With latin music in the background (a little too loud, I might add) and an abundance of colorful lights, it sure felt like latin america.The ServiceThe service was outstanding! The waiter approached us as soon as we sat. He was very helpful and nice. We ordered drinks, asked a few questions about Colombia and told him we needed few more minutes. The service was really good throughout our dinner. If I were to rate Bogota on its service alone, it would be 5 stars.The FoodWe ordered two main dishes the Bandeja Paisa and the Plantain Crusted Chicken. For drinks, we had the Colombian Mojito and the Refajo. The free plantain chips, were a nice surprise although they were a little stale (at least some of them). The Refajo is a great drink! Before trying it, I thought to myself, mixing beer with soda pop is an abomination... the sick buster who came up with that idea is either a moron or a genius. We loved that sick drink and we're definitely going to have it again. As for the Colombian Mojito, I'm still wondering what makes it so Colombian. Maybe it's the distinct anise flavor. But, we didn't care, 'cause we liked'dim drinks.The  Bandeja Paisa is a crazy collection of assorted food items, which somewhat resembles the decoration of the place. Mixing everything with everything, no rules, no order, complete anarchy... The ""platter"" is made of skirt steak,Chicharon (pork fat), arepa, rice, beans & fried egg, maduros, cabbage salad and a small piece of avocado. We started with the unknown - that is, by exploring the pork fat. It was interesting enough, but we were not sure to what extent we were expected to consume it - like what? ALL of it??? I felt like I was doing something wrong, it was way too much fat. The skirt stake was not the best meat ever - it was just ok. The rice, beans & fried egg combo is a great combo. It's a great concept that could enjoy a better execution! The maduros (sweet plantains) were just good. And the Arepa? The Arepa was kinda... almost bad.The Plantain Crusted Chicken - Ok, so... with all due respect, what we're talking 'bout here is basically Schnitzel, OK? And as for the crust,  you couldn't really tell that it was made of plantains and not bread crumbs, that is unless you asked the waiter - then you'd know.But as a Schnitzel, it was a damn good one. Actually, it was probably the best thing we ate there. Ah, and it came with kale and onion (or should I say... onion and kale.)Summary.We had a great dinner and we would go back to Bogota if we were living anywhere around it. But we don't. The next Colombian dinner is gonna be somewhere else. There is nothing wrong with Bogota - the atmosphere is good, the price ($63 including tip) is reasonable for what we ordered and the service is outstanding!

"Came here on a whim one night - there were 5 of us.  We were seated promptly.  Food was excellent.  What we ordered included: Empanada Sampler (good), complimentary banana chips & dip (dip was especially good),  Skirt Steak(good), Surf & Turf (good), Jalapeno Grilled Catfish (great) and Seafood Stew (a bit on the sweet side),  and Chuletas (good).  We also shared the Colombian Fritanga which was a good appetizer to start.  I especially enjoyed the Blood Sausage.  I also liked the side options.  My favorite included the Quinoa & the Tropical Salsa.  A few good options for vegetarians.The drinks were very good as well.  We had amongst us the Pina Colada, Plain & Passion Fruit  and the Fruit Caipirinhas were superb.Fun atmosphere, music was loud.Unfortunately, with the good comes the bad.  Despite the good food, we ended up waiting a good 45 minutes to be served our main entrees.  When asked the waiter what was going on, he explained that the kitchen was backed up.  It didn't help that we sat right in front of the stairs to the kitchen and saw every plate that came out to tables that were seated after us.  Not to mention, we were charged an extra $1 for a tablespoon of sauce and gratuity automatically included for a table of 5?  Oh, of course, at 20% no less.   The waiter apologized & explained that there was nothing he could do for us except provided us with comment cards which we all filled out.  Good food but lacking in manners.  Not a place I plan to return to.",2.0

"Bogota is probably best described as 'pan Latino' food. They officially might tote themselves as Colombian (hence 'Bogota') but the food really runs gamut of numerous Latin American countries. The night I went, there was a Brazilian seafood stew that looked particularly tempting. I settled on a special, the chicken liver arepa (Venezuelan), which was really amazing. The other two in my party loved their dishes--a chicken stew and ropa vieja (Cuban) respectably. What is truly special about Bogota is that they mention which items on their menu that are gluten free. Which means that their kitchen is free of cross contamination (or at least, I hope so). Gluten free food that tastes pretty awesome makes me a happy Anne. On to the negatives: the food lacks heat, which kinda sucks. Not sure if it's because the restaurant caters to the Slope stroller crowd.

"When walking in we were greeted very warmly by staff, which in NYC seems to be somewhat rare these days. We ordered empanadas, arepas, and the flautas (sp?) for our apps.

It's not a dish I would have normally gotten, but each component worked perfectly in tandem with the others, and it turned out to be an amazing dish. The jerk chicken was very flavorful and the chorizo rice that went along with it added a great touch to some of the best jerk chicken I've ever had.   The entire staff was friendly, attentive, and very well informed of their menus. Everyone at our table was well taken care of, drinks refilled quickly, etc. We didn't feel rushed to leave, and we were able to really enjoy ourselves.

"Me and a group of friends came here here for brunch on a Sunday to celebrate a friends birthday. I had never heard anything about this place, but was pleasantly suprised once the night was all over. It was about 9 of us, so they sat us in the back. The decor in the back area is cool as shit. The chairs were a bit uncomfortable, but other than that, everything else good. I started off with a magherita on the rocks, which was made well; not to strong, not to sweet. For the appetizer I had 2 argentinean fried  beed empanadas, which were hot, crusty and delicious. It came with this really good dipping sauce for it to, which only made it better. My entree was awesome though. A lot of people in my group just ordered stuff off the brunch menu, but I scoured thru the full menu and went with jerk tuna steak, which was executed perfectly. A little seared on the outside, a light pink on the inside and seasoned perfectly. It came with some rice and steamed spinach and between that and the empanadas, I was stuffed and could barely finish my food. I took a bite of everyone elses stuff and it was all ridiculously good. The peanut butter cheesecake they brought out for my friends bday was straight sex...I wish I had more room, I would of polished of a piece of that in no time. All in all, we had a great time, between good food, drinks and company. The wait staff was super friendly and on top of us the whole time. Next time I'm in these neck of the woods, I'm definitely coming in for a bite or a drink.",4.0

It's not a dish I would have normally gotten, but each component worked perfectly in tandem with the others, and it turned out to be an amazing dish. The jerk chicken was very flavorful and the chorizo rice that went along with it added a great touch to some of the best jerk chicken I've ever had.   The entire staff was friendly, attentive, and very well informed of their menus. Everyone at our table was well taken care of, drinks refilled quickly, etc. We didn't feel rushed to leave, and we were able to really enjoy ourselves.  In the end, what I think we all look for in a restaurant is genuinely pleasant service, a great environment that has a fresh and authentic vibe, and above all, great and fresh food that represents the concept that the restaurant is based on. Bogota gets top marks in all these categories.",5.0
I recently went back with a big group - still yummy! This time i tried the quinoa and sweet potato cakes (great option for vegetarians) and took advantage of the free appetizer for checking in on Four Square!,4.0

I love this place. Everything is delicious. The food is great and the restaurant is group friendly. Everything is awesome. Bring Smelling salts and try the Bandeja Paisa... It's a Colombian dish that is so good it'll make you pass out.,5.0
"Me and a group of friends came here here for brunch on a Sunday to celebrate a friends birthday. I had never heard anything about this place, but was pleasantly suprised once the night was all over. It was about 9 of us, so they sat us in the back. The decor in the back area is cool as shit. The chairs were a bit uncomfortable, but other than that, everything else good. I started off with a magherita on the rocks, which was made well; not to strong, not to sweet. For the appetizer I had 2 argentinean fried  beed empanadas, which were hot, crusty and delicious. It came with this really good dipping sauce for it to, which only made it better. My entree was awesome though. A lot of people in my group just ordered stuff off the brunch menu, but I scoured thru the full menu and went with jerk tuna steak, which was executed perfectly. A little seared on the outside, a light pink on the inside and seasoned perfectly. It came with some rice and steamed spinach and between that and the empanadas, I was stuffed and could barely finish my food. I took a bite of everyone elses stuff and it was all ridiculously good. The peanut butter cheesecake they brought out for my friends bday was straight sex...I wish I had more room, I would of polished of a piece of that in no time. All in all, we had a great time, between good food, drinks and company. The wait staff was super friendly and on top of us the whole time. Next time I'm in these neck of the woods, I'm definitely coming in for a bite or a drink.",4.0
"Bogotarded good? Try the Empanada sampler for $12 - delicious, especially the one stuffed with goat cheese. The arroz con pollo was great as well - simple, fresh, and flavorful at a reasonable price. We sat in the back area - pretty nice, though the hostess sat us by the server's bus tub when we asked for a cozy spot. (my only gripe). I believe they've got happy hour all night long Mon-Thurs - $5 mojitos and $3 beers. Our server was friendly, attentive, and full of great suggestions. I will definitely be back.",4.0
"Had a great time here with a small group on saturday night--got there early to catch dinner before some other plans and the line was minimal. The staff was great! I was worried about the ""no substitutions"" on the menu, but the waitress confirmed that all my choices were ok with my food concerns!I had the ropa vieja-- DELISH. Nothing more annoying than ordering ropa vieja and getting a giant bowl of peppers and onions with two or three little chunks of meat. this was almost all meat!!! FANTASTIC!Also really dug the sangritas :) would love to come back when it's warmer to try and sit in the back!",4.0
"I was introduced to Bogota a while ago and it was love at first bite!!!  I cannot even begin to express how much I love this place.  The food is just fantastic.  Everything I order, I love.  I always recommend this place to friends both local and out of town guest and I have yet to hear a bad review from them and they always want to go back. As a matter of fact, the review from Leigh K is from one of those friends :-)    I agree with my friend regarding how great it is that the menu acknowledges vegetarians and vegans and that the vegetarian options are plentiful.I do have to mention that if you like coffee, you must order the Cafe con Leche - I love it!  And it goes great with the Tres Leches cake, which is to die for by the way!  So in conclusion, I would highly recommend Bogota to anyone.  From the appetizers to dessert, mojitos to cafe con leche, everything is just great and you will not be disappointed.",5.0
"I come to this place sometime when I want a fast good cocktail in my new neighbourhood. The bartend don't talk so much, but make a very good margarita in less than 2 mins, much faster than other places. The guacamole is good too. Not so original a place but is really good.",4.0

"Any place that can get my mother this giddy (let's pretend she hasn't had several mojitos) deserves 4 stars. Any place that can get my mother giddy, serve delicious Colombian/Costa Rican food, and please my grandparents DEFINITELY deserves 4 stars. As usual, the mojitos were fabulous and STRONG, making me quite buzzed after the first. As usual, my mother lied when she said she would only have 1 as we were seated. So predictable...We marched into Bogota, a party of nine, and were seated almost immediately. Fortunately for us they were offering the $23.00 DIne In Brooklyn prix fixe menu. This really made me happy as I knew there would be some appetizers for everyone, plus my very own appetizer and an entree. This is the kind of restaurant where you just cannot choose a single dish. Everything sounds so good. Usually I start whining and moaning because I can't get every single thing I want. The table ordered two empanada samplers, but we only ordered the Colombian empanadas. Fried cornmeal dough around fillings of chicken and potato (I've had better in Queens. Are you surprised?), and black beans and feta. I was convinced it used to be black beans and queso blanco but they were good nonetheless. The appetizer that came with my meal was the Patacon (!!!) con Todo, which is essentially a very large and flat tostone, topped with shredded chicken and steak, covered in shredded queso blanco, and served with guacamole and chimichurri. On this occasion it wasn't fabulous, lacking in the flavor department and was definitely difficult to cut (I think my arms are sore today). It can be a great dish so I hope it's better next time I visit. For my main course I chose the Pollo Sudado, a Colombian chicken stew with potato and yucca, served on rice with a salad on the side. I love stewed chicken, and the texture of this dish was quite good. It was too bad my boyfriend and mother were slurping up their Ajiaco next to me. I had some serious food envy and could hardly focus on the chicken. That or I was already stuffed. It wasn't *fantastic*, but it was cooked well and was very savory. They get points for making some really fluffy rice. Everyone else at our table loved their food. My grandfather adored the Pernil, my father loved the salmon, my aunt (and I!) loved her coconut shrimp. And judging by the way my grandmother (who wasn't hungry...) was picking up everything she could from our plates, she enjoyed it too. The only real minus was the noise. It definitely was not ideal for a family gathering. I'd rather come here with friends that can handle the noise than watch my grandfather hear the word ""rosy"" and repeat Rosie O'Donnell's name several times.",4.0
Bogota is one of my favorite places to eat in Park Slope! The food is amazingly flavorful and there is something for everyone on their menu. Seriously.

I've walked past this place many times and a few weeks ago I decided to stop in to have dinner with a friend.  The food was pretty good and the crowd was very casual yet energetic.  Nice mix of couples and families enjoying themselves and it gets crowded sometimes so plan ahead.  There are many options on the menu and I plan to come back and try something different very soon...maybe tonight since its warmer out :).  This is just one of those places where you can't go wrong.  Give it a try because the food is very good just don't expect to be blown away...,4.0
Been here a few times and has never disappointed. Most recently had the pork chops with cilantro mashed potatoes. The pork chops were cooked perfectly. Juicy and scrumptious. The cilantro mashed potatoes were yummy even though it didn't look very appetizing. I do love cilantro so...Came here with a friend from Texas who told me about Santgrias. Basically a frozen Margarita with dollops of Santgria in between. Bogota doesn't have this on their menu but they mad eit for us. It was amazing and is now my favorite type of Margarita.

"Absolutely disgusting.I ordered the Arroz Con Pollo which is their house special. The rice was complete and absolute mush, absolutely overcooked and dry, mixed in with a little bit of shredded chicken and lacking any flavor. It tasted worse than a box of instant rice. The plantains were over-fried, and the black beans were nothing admirable. The whole dish was disgusting.My girlfriend ordered the garlic shrimp with coconut rice. This was a very sad looking 7 pieces of tiny 41/50 frozen shrimp thawed out and covered with minced garlic. This was far from sauteed as the shrimp itself had absolutely no flavor once the mounds of garlic were brushed off of it. When we spoke to the manager, he was completely aggressive saying that the food was authentic and that's exactly how gourmet Columbian food tastes. Mush and frozen low grade, unflavored shrimp is not gourmet in any country. Arroz con pollo is not mush.. for a manager to defend his mush rice and state it as authentic cuisine is sad.After sending the dishes back, 2 bites in we left.I do not recommend this for any type of authentic cuisine or service (it's incredibly slow).. and the interior is beyond tacky and obnoxious.Why this place is so loved by yelpers is beyond me - there's better Columbian food to be had out there, this is not it.",1.0
"Had a Friday night/date night dinner with my sweetie here.  Called the restaurant around 5:30 to see if we'd need reservations.  They were booked with their reservations for the evening but I was told that we could come in anyway because they do have tables for walk-ins.  Awesome!!  We walked in around 7 and were seated right away - thank the Lord!!  We got the front center elevated table which I HIGHLY recommend because you can see everything that's going on in the restaurant.  We started out with 2 Sangarita's which were recommended by our very nice waitress (Jean-Marie).  This drink is THE BEST drink I've every had in my LIFE!!!  Taste like an alcohol Sweet Tart.  It's half red sangria and half frozen margarita.  GET IT!!!!  You won't be disappointed!!!  For an appetizer we had the Empanada Trio - cornmeal (steak, chicken, black bean and bacalao).  We both didn't really care for any of them.  The cornmeal is VERY heavy (I prefer empanadas made with pastry dough).  The steak and chicken both have potato in them which made them even heavier.  The black bean was a bit too sour for my taste and I don't like bacalao - bf had that one.  Perhaps we should have had the wheat ones???  In any case, I wouldn't order these when I go back.  Empanadas are much better when left simple with some really good dipping sauces on the side.  But it's the pastry dough that makes them wow!!!  For the entree I had the Garlic Shrimp (with your choice of 2 sides).  Really delicious!!  Shrimps are large, black beans (with yellow rice - rice and beans are considered 1 side) were tasty and seasoned well and the maduros were sweet sweet sweet... just the way they should be.  My bf had the Vaca Frita with white rice, red beans and tostones.  I did find it really strange though that they wouldn't let him have yellow rice instead of white.  VERY STRANGE.  Nevertheless, his meal was delicious as well.  The beef was shredded,  juicy and seasoned really well.  Not too over powering and fried, but not fried too much.  Perfection!  For dessert, I had the coconut flan.  It was outstanding!!!  The best I EVER had.  Creamy, thick and delicious.  I had enough for the next day and boy oh... boy was I happy :)  My bf had the chocolate molten lava cake with vanilla ice cream.  He loved it!!!  I tried it as well and it was so.....amazingly good!!!  Freshly made (takes 10 to 15 mins to get after you order it), the cocoa that they used to make it was definitely primo!  I am very much looking forward to going back - REALLY SOON!!!",4.0

"I patronized this bistro with my sister and fiancée, making it our first time here. My fiancée and I had wanted to try this place for awhile...even tried one night a few months back, but the wait at the time was over 40 minutes and we were famished. Overall, it has a casual and relaxed, yet upbeat and colorful atmosphere (definitely very influentially Latin), though the enclosed outdoor patio area in the far back can get really congested and tight.For an appetizer, I tried the platanos rellenos with bacalao (fish) and red pepper sauce. It had nice flavor, and the plantains were prepared nicely, yet I think without the sauce it would've been a bit uneventful. For my entrée, I had the trucha frita (fried brook trout with rice). When I saw it on the menu, I simply had to try it, considering how long it had been since I had any kind of trout, which is my favorite freshwater fish.  I felt it had been fried too long, resulting in it being too dry, though it had nice flavor. The coconut rice (which was actually quite dark) was a non-spectacular, globular, sticky mesh of gooey starch with flavor dominated too much by the raisins. I took one bite, but my palette couldn't get past it.For dessert, I immediately went with the flan de coco (Brazilian coconut flan). To my surprise, I thought it was a little too thick (Brazilian style, I discovered) for my taste when it comes to flan, which I typically love. I really enjoy flan that melts with bursting caramel flavor, which I didn't get from this. It was still plenty sweet and rich (and I devoured it all up, despite being full). It just wasn't what I'm used to in regard to the texture of the custard. I guess I prefer Spanish and Mexican style flan better, which definitely has a smoother consistency. My fiancee tried the Acai sorbet with bananas and granola, which tasted homemade and pretty tasty.I will certainly try this restaurant again at some point, though next time I think I prefer to be seated somewhere in the main dining area.",3.0

This place is super popular and hard to get into. Both times I have been here the hostess told me it was a 1 hour wait - yet suddenly we were seated within 5-10 minutes! Don't be discouraged if they tell you it's a long wait...it's not. The food is excellent and so are the drinks. The empanadas are my favorite - especially the goat cheese and the guava.

Huge menu.Fun (if not crazy loud) atmosphere.Great tortilla soup and arepas.Specials are always innovative.Staff is incredibly nice - although sometimes seem to be overworked with the always packed tables ordering more and more mojitos!Only minor downside... you have to pay/order chips (plantain) & salsa.,4.0
"Great ambiance and service, the food was ok nothing special. I had the bandeja paisa the typical Colombian dish, which was nothing but a bunch of different items all together on a plate. It was typical Spanish food. For desert we had the tres leche and the banana pudding, which again was just okay. I didn't have any drinks but they looked amazing.Note on Sunday brunch is until 3:45pm so no big Spanish plates will be served until then.",3.0

"It's always been on my to-go list, but unfortunately the lines are always ridiculously long, &/or it's packed. I'll just say the menu prices are pretty reasonable, and it spans a lot of Latin American cuisine, so you can do Peru, Panama, or Argentina in one night.I had the empanada sampler, which even at just 4 was more than enough food for me; I never got around to an entree.I also had passion fruit and lulo margaritas. No exaggeration the lulo is probably the best fruit I've ever tasted; it's citrusy & orange/tangerine-like, but different. I hope it's not ugly.I had to knock off two stars for the door treatment. If I TELL YOU my party is seated, and I know they're inside, don't keep trying to locate the reservation holding me back like I rolled up in Bogota of all places w/dos pistolas. Get over yourselves. I don't like the seating. It's one of those places that has you thigh to thigh with your neighbor in a reach over & grab the salt, share an app kind of way.The waiter was nice, as were the busboys. Though I think they could be a bit speedier. Took forever to bring the tab, but a New York minute for the manager to scoop it up. Ain't that how it goes.I dunno.

I've had the pleasure of eating here a couple of times and the food was excellent both times. I ordered the Salmon the first time (cooked to perfection) and fish tacos the second time (delicious).

"OK- got to say that I love this place. I've never been disappointed; good service, good drinks, great & long happy hour (seriously),really really good food and reasonably priced. You can try anything on the menu, you can't go wrong.",4.0
"I patronized this bistro with my sister and fiancée, making it our first time here. My fiancée and I had wanted to try this place for awhile...even tried one night a few months back, but the wait at the time was over 40 minutes and we were famished. Overall, it has a casual and relaxed, yet upbeat and colorful atmosphere (definitely very influentially Latin), though the enclosed outdoor patio area in the far back can get really congested and tight.For an appetizer, I tried the platanos rellenos with bacalao (fish) and red pepper sauce. It had nice flavor, and the plantains were prepared nicely, yet I think without the sauce it would've been a bit uneventful. For my entrée, I had the trucha frita (fried brook trout with rice). When I saw it on the menu, I simply had to try it, considering how long it had been since I had any kind of trout, which is my favorite freshwater fish.  I felt it had been fried too long, resulting in it being too dry, though it had nice flavor. The coconut rice (which was actually quite dark) was a non-spectacular, globular, sticky mesh of gooey starch with flavor dominated too much by the raisins. I took one bite, but my palette couldn't get past it.For dessert, I immediately went with the flan de coco (Brazilian coconut flan). To my surprise, I thought it was a little too thick (Brazilian style, I discovered) for my taste when it comes to flan, which I typically love. I really enjoy flan that melts with bursting caramel flavor, which I didn't get from this. It was still plenty sweet and rich (and I devoured it all up, despite being full). It just wasn't what I'm used to in regard to the texture of the custard. I guess I prefer Spanish and Mexican style flan better, which definitely has a smoother consistency. My fiancee tried the Acai sorbet with bananas and granola, which tasted homemade and pretty tasty.I will certainly try this restaurant again at some point, though next time I think I prefer to be seated somewhere in the main dining area.",3.0

This place is super popular and hard to get into. Both times I have been here the hostess told me it was a 1 hour wait - yet suddenly we were seated within 5-10 minutes! Don't be discouraged if they tell you it's a long wait...it's not. The food is excellent and so are the drinks. The empanadas are my favorite - especially the goat cheese and the guava.

"Walking around looking for a bite before hitting a show at the Brooklyn Lyceum we happened upon this place.Simply put - the food was YUM!!! Service good too.Nightly 5-7pm they have happy hour, so I tried their $5 Mojito -- quite good surprisingly. We had the Bacalao Potato Cakes (yum) to start and both thoroughly enjoyed our two house special entrees:  Bogota's Arroz con Pollo (one of the best versions of this I've ever had: shredded chicken mixed with yellow rice, carrots, red peppers, cilantro & scallionsserved with avocado, maduros, colombian aji and a side of black beans) and Bandela Paisa (grilled skirt steak, chicharron, arepa, rice & beans, fried egg, maduros & avocado).Sadly there was no room to try desserts.The only thing I was a bit bummed about was that at 6:30pm on Sunday they were already out of a number of specials (unless they served the same ones for their Sunday brunch?)I'll have to go back in warmer weather and check out the murals in the garden.",4.0

"Admittedly I've only eaten a full meal here once, and it was pretty delicious but this was only about an hour after I had finished four 64 ounce beers at Farrells..... But I get drinks here regularly. The first time I strolled in for something to snack on and they only had room at the bar, after that I actually prefer to sit there. Happy Hour is amazing, 3 dollar beers, 5 dollar caipirinhas. Although the house cachaca is good, its definitely worth it to upgrade to Leblon for at least the first drink. The drinks are consistent and amazing, I have tried caipirinhas at tons of places across the city and this is the best one, except for maybe Temple Bar, but that one was $16 not the $8 they charge at Bogota.Usually when I sit at the bar, I'll just get chips or a quesadilla with mushrooms and goat cheese....which is delicious. This place is definitely worth checking out, especially for happy hour, but please request a table, I really like to sit at the bar. Oh and on Monday they do half price bottles of wine....how can you beat that.",4.0
"I had a really good bachata here (horchata with bacardi). It was served in a martini glass, which made it seem really fancy. I love horchata, and this horchata supposedly is freshly made on the premises and isn't too sweet, which is exactly how it should be and how I like it. The Bacardi complemented the rice milk really well. Unfortunately, that was the only really good thing I had there tonight. We shared the Colombian Fritanga (combo pork platter with plaintains) and the half rotisserie chicken with a sauce, red beans and yellow rice, and fried yucca. While the beans, rice, yucca, and plaintains were really good, the meat was drier than dry! The sauces that accompanied them did not save them, either. The service was incredibly slow. I usually take forever to finish my cocktails/drinks, yet somehow I managed to finish my drink before all our food came. Even the drinks took a long time to come, which was a little annoying.Might come back here if I am in the neighborhood for a bachata or another cocktail at the bar, but probably won't be back here for the food, sadly.",2.0
"I admit that a friend of over 25 years is an owner so Yelping about Bogota Bistro is more of a pride thing for me.  I haven't seen him in a quarter century and I couldn't be more proud.  The atmosphere, the friendly staff as well as location are all exceptional.  The drinks are tasty and not watered down. The music on Wed nite was lively and made me feel I was outside of Brooklyn momentarily. They have a large selection of latin infused liquors and beers. But the food!  Exceptional. The tasty chicaronnes de pollo with a 10 Cane Rum mojito was to die for.  I enjoyed every bite and was sad when it was done. The portions are nice and I was just greedy for more.

"Walking around looking for a bite before hitting a show at the Brooklyn Lyceum we happened upon this place.Simply put - the food was YUM!!! Service good too.Nightly 5-7pm they have happy hour, so I tried their $5 Mojito -- quite good surprisingly. We had the Bacalao Potato Cakes (yum) to start and both thoroughly enjoyed our two house special entrees:  Bogota's Arroz con Pollo (one of the best versions of this I've ever had: shredded chicken mixed with yellow rice, carrots, red peppers, cilantro & scallionsserved with avocado, maduros, colombian aji and a side of black beans) and Bandela Paisa (grilled skirt steak, chicharron, arepa, rice & beans, fried egg, maduros & avocado).Sadly there was no room to try desserts.The only thing I was a bit bummed about was that at 6:30pm on Sunday they were already out of a number of specials (unless they served the same ones for their Sunday brunch?)I'll have to go back in warmer weather and check out the murals in the garden.",4.0
My girlfriend and I have eaten about 5 or 6 times. It's become one of our favorites in the area. Very warm and friendly staff and service. I don't eat much seafood and no beef or pork but manage to make a go of it. It would be a 5 if they have more veggie dishes and tweaked the atmosphere a bit - but I love it as is as well.,4.0
"This is one of my favorite restaurants - period. Tortilla soup with an empanadilla (beef or bean or look for a special, they're all good!) is my staple, sometimes I'll have a corn arepa to mix things up.The service is always awesome, the food has never missed the mark and I've taken family and friends here, all of whom have also enjoyed it throughly. Also, they have 3 nights a week with 3 dollar happy hour beers.run don't walk.",5.0

"Loved the food, great drinks! hard to get a table on the weekend.",4.0
"Admittedly I've only eaten a full meal here once, and it was pretty delicious but this was only about an hour after I had finished four 64 ounce beers at Farrells..... But I get drinks here regularly. The first time I strolled in for something to snack on and they only had room at the bar, after that I actually prefer to sit there. Happy Hour is amazing, 3 dollar beers, 5 dollar caipirinhas. Although the house cachaca is good, its definitely worth it to upgrade to Leblon for at least the first drink. The drinks are consistent and amazing, I have tried caipirinhas at tons of places across the city and this is the best one, except for maybe Temple Bar, but that one was $16 not the $8 they charge at Bogota.Usually when I sit at the bar, I'll just get chips or a quesadilla with mushrooms and goat cheese....which is delicious. This place is definitely worth checking out, especially for happy hour, but please request a table, I really like to sit at the bar. Oh and on Monday they do half price bottles of wine....how can you beat that.",4.0
"I had a really good bachata here (horchata with bacardi). It was served in a martini glass, which made it seem really fancy. I love horchata, and this horchata supposedly is freshly made on the premises and isn't too sweet, which is exactly how it should be and how I like it. The Bacardi complemented the rice milk really well. Unfortunately, that was the only really good thing I had there tonight. We shared the Colombian Fritanga (combo pork platter with plaintains) and the half rotisserie chicken with a sauce, red beans and yellow rice, and fried yucca. While the beans, rice, yucca, and plaintains were really good, the meat was drier than dry! The sauces that accompanied them did not save them, either. The service was incredibly slow. I usually take forever to finish my cocktails/drinks, yet somehow I managed to finish my drink before all our food came. Even the drinks took a long time to come, which was a little annoying.Might come back here if I am in the neighborhood for a bachata or another cocktail at the bar, but probably won't be back here for the food, sadly.",2.0
"I admit that a friend of over 25 years is an owner so Yelping about Bogota Bistro is more of a pride thing for me.  I haven't seen him in a quarter century and I couldn't be more proud.  The atmosphere, the friendly staff as well as location are all exceptional.  The drinks are tasty and not watered down. The music on Wed nite was lively and made me feel I was outside of Brooklyn momentarily. They have a large selection of latin infused liquors and beers. But the food!  Exceptional. The tasty chicaronnes de pollo with a 10 Cane Rum mojito was to die for.  I enjoyed every bite and was sad when it was done. The portions are nice and I was just greedy for more. It stayed nice hot and crispy thru each bite. The vaca frita was outstanding.  Last time I had it this good was in Miami. GO to this little piece of Bogota heaven in Brooklyn.

"I used to really like Bogota, but have recently changed my mind.  As a vegetarian, the salad and vegetarian menus seems really great.  However,  having been there multiple times and trying various items on these menus, I consistently feel extremely unsatisfied with my food.  For example, when I was there last night, I ordered the Pom Palm salad.  The salad I was served was quite pitiful, considering the nine dollar price tag.  It was small and boring and when I order a salad for that amount of money, I expect a decent size salad that appears appetizing.   It is also especially frustrating that whenever I've been to Bogota with non-vegetarians, they always get a ton of food.  My veggie entrees are never quite as plentiful as the entrees eaten by my meat eating friends.I will say that the atmosphere and service at Bogota is what makes being there pleasurable.  It's a fun place to dine and the servers are friendly and helpful.  Our glasses also never ran low on water.  I suppose that counts for something.",2.0

"This place is truly a gem. If the goal of the owners was a fun, festive restaurant they succeeded in grand fashion. From the decor, bright colored murals on the walls, to the music the space feels vibrant and alive. This where you go for after work hang outs and birthday parties.

Possibly but it was still pretty good. Sharing food is another key to a festive atmosphere. Upon receiving my appetizer I soon realized this was designed to be shared. My chorizo appetizer was a mini meal. It could have easily been split between 2 or 3 people. The dish had 2 types of chorizo, sauteed onions and plantain chips and was excellent. I didn't know there were different types of chorizo but one seemed noticeably spicier than the other. While it's not a tapas restaurant I could see a group order a bunch of appetizers and sharing them tapas style. I did order a main dish, the shredded skirt steak (Ropa Vieja). It was fabulous. It was moderately spicy and the cut of meat was perfectly tender, not at all stringy or tough. I had it with the yellow rice and red beans which where good. This is a really cool place. The whole time I was dining I kept thinking, that this reminds of Boca Chica except larger.  What I didn't like was no bread or chips on tables.

"The service was excellent, and the drinks were great.  For appetizers we had the Yucca Fritta: pretty good, Dip Sampler: the black bean was delicious, guac was pretty standard and the salsa was just ok, but the plantains and chips it came with were great.  For dinner I had the Pernil, white rice, red beans and maduros.  Being Latino, it was going to take a lot to impress me...and impress me they did not.  The rice was coked with too much liquid and was slightly on the wet side, the beans were mehh, and the Pernil had too much nutmeg and/or all spice.  Maybe it's traditional in Colombia to use those spices, but I didn't care for it.  My wife had the whole red snapper which came with rice and beans and some chopped salad stuff on the side.  The fish was overdone and dry and the rice was undercooked with every bite consisting of hard half raw grains of rice.  My daughters shared what was supposed to be a mushroom and spinach quesadilla, but it turned out to be a maduro and chicken quesadilla.  I didn't try it, but the girls said it was ok...just ok.  They also shared the paella.  The mussels were too big and VERY rubbery.  Once they removed the mussels, they said it was pretty good.  The meal wasn't a toal disaster, so we gave desert a chance.  I had the coconut flan which was pretty good, not great, but worthy of three stars.  My wife had the orbeas which she didn't care for and my daughters had the churros and banana bread pudding.  They both liked their deserts.  I didn't try the churros but I did try the bread pudding which was surprisingly pretty good.  It wasn't too expensive and there were some good points to the meal.  Overall, I'd have to say i might give it another shot, but I'll have to convince the rest of the family to come along.",3.0

"This is one of my favorite restaurants in New York and all around in the US. This restaurant is owned by a gay couple; one of the guys is Colombian and the other guy is Palestinian. The food is predominantly Colombian, but over all Latin American, with a mural of Celia Cruz and the Cuban flag out in the back dining patio. Delicious Mojitos, Caipirinas and Pisco Sours. Photos from Cuba, Peru, Colombia, Puerto Rico, Brazil, hang on the brick walls of the restaurant. Lively environment, delicious gourmet food and upscale versions of my Cuban Abuelita's home-cooked fare. The service is great. The environment is festive. They do have happy hour, so the delicious drinks are half the price! And the owners work the tables and greet the customers to make sure everyone is pleased with their experience! i highly recommend this place to anyone visiting New York.

"I love this place. I've been here for brunch and dinner a few times, and I always order out from here. Every time the food has been delicious and the wait staff is very attentive. I'm a big fan of the lamb chop special, but my go-to meal is the sweet arepa with Mexican chorizo -- so delicious! My one (tiny) complaint is that they reduced the amount of guacamole you get when you order the appetizer, it's barely enough for 2 people!",5.0

"Last night was my second night there and the food was fantastic.  Both times the service was okay, waiting for the check took a while but on a Saturday night, that's really not a surprise.  The food is delicious.  The goat cheese empanadas are so good.  The tortilla soup was just what I was hoping for. I had a cocktail called Gin Gin Mule; oh so good. Tanqueray, ginger, sugar, muddled lime and ginger ale. Their guacamole is great as well.  I will be coming back for sure.",4.0
"The service was excellent, and the drinks were great.  For appetizers we had the Yucca Fritta: pretty good, Dip Sampler: the black bean was delicious, guac was pretty standard and the salsa was just ok, but the plantains and chips it came with were great.  For dinner I had the Pernil, white rice, red beans and maduros.  Being Latino, it was going to take a lot to impress me...and impress me they did not.  The rice was coked with too much liquid and was slightly on the wet side, the beans were mehh, and the Pernil had too much nutmeg and/or all spice.  Maybe it's traditional in Colombia to use those spices, but I didn't care for it.  My wife had the whole red snapper which came with rice and beans and some chopped salad stuff on the side.  The fish was overdone and dry and the rice was undercooked with every bite consisting of hard half raw grains of rice.  My daughters shared what was supposed to be a mushroom and spinach quesadilla, but it turned out to be a maduro and chicken quesadilla.  I didn't try it, but the girls said it was ok...just ok.  They also shared the paella.  The mussels were too big and VERY rubbery.  Once they removed the mussels, they said it was pretty good.  The meal wasn't a toal disaster, so we gave desert a chance.  I had the coconut flan which was pretty good, not great, but worthy of three stars.  My wife had the orbeas which she didn't care for and my daughters had the churros and banana bread pudding.  They both liked their deserts.  I didn't try the churros but I did try the bread pudding which was surprisingly pretty good.  It wasn't too expensive and there were some good points to the meal.  Overall, I'd have to say i might give it another shot, but I'll have to convince the rest of the family to come along.",3.0
"I met my friend there and he was waiting for me at the bar.  The bartender was uber nice.  I was a good ambiance, not too loud.   We were then seated and given menus.  I asked the waitress for her suggestions and she told me the snapper fish was good, so I had that and it was seasoned well, but a little fishy.  Over all the food was really good and the waitress was really nice and attentive.  I would go back.",4.0

"I've hung with Bogota since its opening.  Although I'm (unfortunately) not the owner, since this place is run by a hometown kid, I've lovingly watched it grow from a shaky startup to a Park Slope juggernaut. Bogota is my regular spot when it's time to bring a chick (and there's been a few) back to my hood.  Everyone always loves the place.  Order some Arroz con Pollo, a few drinks later, and it's a wrap. You've made me proud, Bogota--congrats on your first few years.  Here's to many more.",5.0
"This is one of my favorite restaurants in New York and all around in the US. This restaurant is owned by a gay couple; one of the guys is Colombian and the other guy is Palestinian. The food is predominantly Colombian, but over all Latin American, with a mural of Celia Cruz and the Cuban flag out in the back dining patio. Delicious Mojitos, Caipirinas and Pisco Sours. Photos from Cuba, Peru, Colombia, Puerto Rico, Brazil, hang on the brick walls of the restaurant. Lively environment, delicious gourmet food and upscale versions of my Cuban Abuelita's home-cooked fare. The service is great. The environment is festive. They do have happy hour, so the delicious drinks are half the price! And the owners work the tables and greet the customers to make sure everyone is pleased with their experience! i highly recommend this place to anyone visiting New York.

The only thing that could make the bar menu better is if they had a Torrontes by the glass (hint, hint). In all, definitely a fun spot, and one I'll definitely return to in the near future. I have yet to experience the live music nights, but am certainly excited by the prospect!",4.0
went on Sunday.  had a reservation.  there was no wait.def order the sangrita...a sangria/frozen margarita mix.  if i wasn't driving i would have had a 2nd.  this was the best drink at our table of 4.they put plantain chips on the table.  empanada sampler was next.  the plate has 4.  we ordered two chicken two steak.  they were delish.  we would def order again.  we also ordered arepa.  arepa wasn't that tasty to me.i ordered the grilled skirt steak with green aji sauce.  i ate the whole thing.  very tasty.  my sides were maduras and tropical cole slaw.  both were awesome.  i could eat the slaw every meal.my friends ate ropa vieja.  they are still talking about it 2 days later.  they licked the bowl clean.desert i ordered the fried cheese cake with vanilla ice cream .  it was as good as it sounds.  the tres leche cake was perfect.  i wasn't a big fan of the flan.our waiter Jonathan rocked!!  he was attentive but not overbearing.  only suggestion is don't sit on the benches against the brick wall.  the building 's heating pipes run underneath the bench.  we sweated  the whole night.all in all a good evening of eats and drinks.  we will def be going back.,4.0
"Amazing! One of the best Latin restaurants I have ever been to. The Aji sauce is delicious. Staff is warm and very knowledgeable. Music, decor, and overall feel  create as close to an authentic Colombian dining experience one can find stateside.",5.0

"Everything I had was delicious; arepas with guacamole was amazing, garlic chicken was very flavorful (not so much for the beans and rice), and the smore empenada was obviously delicious.  My bf had some pork chop dish (not shredded) that was not as exciting but still good.  The portions are huge, so I recommend splitting unless you want to end up overstuffed all night like we did.

"Saturday night, spur of the moment decision to grab some latin or Mexican food and we end up here.  Been meaning to try it for ages.

"I had a very nice dinner this evening with my girlfriend as we shared a Ropa Vieja (excellent) with two sides of the cilantro mashed potatoes (excellent) and the coconut rice (pretty good).  We also had the dessert of the banana bread pudding (pretty good, though it could have used a bit more sauce which, in retrospect, I'm sure they would have provided if asked).  The atmosphere was also very pleasant and the wait staff was very nice.  I recall having my water glass topped off regularly for a change -- I drink a lot of water but not once had to ask for a refill.The service was excellent and wasn't at all upset about our sharing of one entree between the two of us.  I definitely plan on going back as the food there was very well prepared and much more interesting than the typical italian/french/asian fare that's common in NYC.",5.0

This place is insanely good.  I've been here twice with friends and have not disappointed.  I've gotten the skirt steak which was tender and delicious.  The catfish tacos are not to be missed either.  The only drawback is that the wait can take forever sometimes.  Try to place a reservation ahead of time if your party is particularly big.,5.0

"Love everything about this place--the food, the people, the atmosphere, and the prices. They seated us in the back room, which has a glass roof, live plants, and feels like being outdoors, even on a cold, snowy winter night. Got there in time for Happy Hour ($6 drinks). I had the amazing arroz con pollo, the boys had the ropa vieja lasagne special. Also gratis plaintain chips. Everything was delish.",4.0
"It's ok. I have never waited, but it's usually pretty crowded and servers stay busy. I've gotten Salmon dish which was decent, but overall, food is average. I wish the waiter were bit more attentive. I would rather try other restaurans if I'm in the area.",3.0

"If you're looking for a mojito, my friends, look here. Bogota has the best I've ever tasted; the mojitos alone are worth the visit. But thanks to their awesome atmosphere, great service, and absolutely delicious food, you'll get a lot more than a great cocktail. I stumbled upon Bogota one night while wandering the streets of Park Slope with a friend, looking for a place to satiate our hunger. There were lines everywhere; it was late; and I was ready to chew my arm off, but we chose to wait at Bogota because of the energetic vibe and inviting bar area in front (and once I received my first mojito, my food-deprived panic subsided). We didn't wait long--maybe 15-20 minutes--and were seated by a friendly waiter who turned out to be one of Bogota's owners. He was extremely helpful with the menu; I'm a Latin food freak and, in my hungry haze, almost ordered two chicharron dishes: an appetizer and an entree (chicharron are basically pork rinds). George (the owner) suggested I go with some grilled chayote with mayonesa; it was a great suggestion and took me straight back to a summer I spent in Costa Rica nearly 10 years ago.  I did, however, stick with an entree that included chicharron, and my lord, it was good. Crispy, oily, and full of pork flavor, I would eat it every day if I could. Everything else was delicious as well: juicy, fiery skirt steak, flavorful rice and beans, and pillowy arepas had me floating somewhere above the table, dreamily watching myself eat. I've since been back to Bogota a few times, and I've never been even the tiniest bit disappointed with the food. If you can save room for dessert, the churros are fabulous.I'll be headed back to Bogota soon, now that warm weather is here: there's an outdoor patio that looks like the perfect place to while away an evening with a mojito (or several) in hand.",5.0

"Congratulations to Bogota for my first 5 star Yelp review! This is probably one of the two best places I've eaten so far in Brooklyn. The atmosphere was fun and festive, the food is delicious (try the ropa vieja lasagna special), and they have DIET MOJITOS (made w/ splenda instead of sugar for those of us who prefer their calories to come from beans and rice). The classic arroz con pollo is also fantastic. Does it get any better, friends?",5.0

There was a wide variety of sides (the dish came with two) - and I opted for the cilantro mashed potatoes (amazing - they were the oddest shade of strong pea green, but tasted oh so fabulous) and the garlic spinach (could have been a tad warmer, but it was quite good as well). Let's just say I usually take a pic of my dinner, especially when it was as colorful and unique as this one, but it smelled too good to wait. Ooops. And to round out the meal, we had an order of churros - which became um two orders of churros. Fabulous. The churros themselves were good but pretty standard, but the dipping sauces were what made it.

AMAZING! everything from beginning to end was impeccable.  The service was great and all the staff were friendly and so attentive.It was packed in the entry area and we had to wait for a table for 3 for about 15 minutes.  Snagged seats at the bar and ordered a pitcher of mango margaritas which came just as our table was ready.  The margaritas are fantastic and have chunks of frozen mango and tastes so fresh it's almost like a breakfast beverage...almost.The chips/dips sampler platter is a great way to start the meal and most ofl of our entrees were great with the exception of the arroz con pollo which I did not like at all.  Kinda dry and lacking flavor. We were so full we took the leftovers home and relived our experience the next day.,5.0

The other items (garlic roasted chicken & steak chimichurri) we had were good and filling. Our desserts: banana caramel bread pudding was stellar while the coconut flan, though not quite as excellent, was still pretty darn good.

"So confused...I expected some amazing food after seeing some of the reviews and seeing the 4 star average...Disappointment overwhelmed me upon exiting the restaurant after brunch Sunday. My trusted yelpers??? K pasa?The 3 stars is for the service. Ordered: The juice. Waiter said it was real fresh juice...I must be a fool for believing him. The mango juice tasted like they poured about 4 ounces of juice then turned on the faucet and filled the rest of the cup with water. Yikes.Ordered: Daisey something rather baked eggs and was actually liking it. The poached eggs were cooked perfectly.Ordered: arroz con pollo. ?Donde esta el sabor? One word: dry. The black beans that came with it had no flavor. Due to the dryness of the dish, I had to drown the dish with the beans and then the aji sauce and then some hot sauce. What the hell. I had really been craving some kick ass arroz con pollo.

"Had a nice meal at Bogota - the place has a great feel to it, some tasty, tasty food and mojitos galore.  I had the pernil, which i thoroughly enjoyed with some cilantro mashed potatoes (eh) and kale (ok).  We had some incredibly addictive black bean dip with plantain chips to share.  Friends had the catfish tacos (ok, but kind of generally soggy) and the columbian platter (with steak, eggs, chiccharronnes, beans...other stuff).  Portions were huge, everyone there seemed to be having a great time, prices were pretty reasonable.  Service was slow, but meant well...would definitely go again if I was in the neighborhood.",4.0
"One of the marks of a good restaurant is how its chefs handle vegetarian dishes. I went to Bogota with a guy to whom meat-eating is practically a religious experience, and who raved about their non-veg entrees. Suffice it to say, I wasn't sure there would be veg-friendly options, let alone any decent ones.I was so, so pleasantly surprised. We shared a fishcake appetizer (yeah, I'm a flexible vegetarian), which was much more moist than most seafood-cakes. Then I had AMAZING marinated portabello mushrooms with some cilantro mashed potatoes and kale. The chefs knew what they were doing - the mushrooms were amazing, the sauces accompanying the food was amazing, and the veggies and potatoes were flavored in the most wonderful ways. There was nothing plan or perfunctory about the veggies dishes - they were handled with as much thought and skill as the meat ones. Bogota has a great wine list - the Agentinian Pinot Noir was fantastic. Our waitress was so friendly, really knew the menu and was not shy about helping me pick my entree from the list of ones I was considering. All in all, it was a great night out. I'd encourage anyone - vegetarian or meat eater - to go there. It's rare that a meat-eating guy and a vegetarian girl can go to the same restaurant and leave equally impressed.",4.0
"Seriously, where have you been all my life? I've been looking for a good Latin restaurant FOREVER, and I could never find one. I always thought it was me, but now I know it wasn' t me, it was you (you=all the other Latin restaurants that failed me).The service was great. There is a back patio seating area that is enclosed so it's bright but still indoors. I got the Mexican Breakfast with egg whites. Even with egg whites, the meal was fantastic! I also tried some of the fish tacos and that was awesome also. I can't wait to go back to try everything else on the menu!",5.0

"I don't have much to say about bogota that hasn't been said by others.  The food is great, and lots of good options for vegetarians such as me.  The drinks are good but a little on the sweet side for me, and the happy hour is great.  But what really stands out here is the service and the general friendliness of the staff.  Everyone seems happy and like they really enjoy working there, from the host staff to the waiters and even the people who run the food and bus the tables.  It's really refreshing to see, and nice to go there and feel welcome.  Based on my years of experience in the restaurant business, I would think this is a testament to great management and owners, since this type of positivity tends to trickle down.  I will definitely be back!",5.0
AMAZING! everything from beginning to end was impeccable.  The service was great and all the staff were friendly and so attentive.It was packed in the entry area and we had to wait for a table for 3 for about 15 minutes.  Snagged seats at the bar and ordered a pitcher of mango margaritas which came just as our table was ready.  The margaritas are fantastic and have chunks of frozen mango and tastes so fresh it's almost like a breakfast beverage...almost.The chips/dips sampler platter is a great way to start the meal and most ofl of our entrees were great with the exception of the arroz con pollo which I did not like at all.  Kinda dry and lacking flavor. We were so full we took the leftovers home and relived our experience the next day.,5.0

"My hubby, 18 month-old son and sister visited this lively spot a month or so ago, and we had a couple of great items from the menu. The corn arepa de chocolo with avocado salad, goat cheese empanadas and portabello chimichurri were out of this world and seriously, you HAVE to try the Columbian Rum Punch...wow...sweet & fruity, while packing an unexpected punch! The other items (garlic roasted chicken & steak chimichurri) we had were good and filling. Our desserts: banana caramel bread pudding was stellar while the coconut flan, though not quite as excellent, was still pretty darn good. The great thing about this place that while it was a bit on the small side and crowded when we were there, the waiter and servers were so accommodating of our fiesty little one, giving him some little toys to keep him occupied and tirelessly picking up the things he threw around... they were awesome!",4.0
"So confused...I expected some amazing food after seeing some of the reviews and seeing the 4 star average...Disappointment overwhelmed me upon exiting the restaurant after brunch Sunday. My trusted yelpers??? K pasa?The 3 stars is for the service. Ordered: The juice. Waiter said it was real fresh juice...I must be a fool for believing him. The mango juice tasted like they poured about 4 ounces of juice then turned on the faucet and filled the rest of the cup with water. Yikes.Ordered: Daisey something rather baked eggs and was actually liking it. The poached eggs were cooked perfectly.Ordered: arroz con pollo. ?Donde esta el sabor? One word: dry. The black beans that came with it had no flavor. Due to the dryness of the dish, I had to drown the dish with the beans and then the aji sauce and then some hot sauce. What the hell. I had really been craving some kick ass arroz con pollo. The dish crushed my craving, and not in the good kind of way.I live in fort Greene and decided to venture out to the Slope to explore that hood.

"I wanted to like this place, but they made it hard for me to like it from the moment I stepped inside.  They sat us in the back garden where we had the heater blowing directly at us, but we were forewarned that it would be hot.  I hadn't really eaten that day, so I was really looking forward to sitting down and eating a great meal.  How was I to know that every single dish would have banana or mango in them (I am allergic to both) and that everyone around us would be served and it would take a good 45 minutes for us to get our meals?I had ordered the corn-crusted salmon and my friends had ordered other dishes.  Yet mine came out a good 10 minutes after they had been served (this is in addition to our 45-minute wait for our food).  The medium salmon was oddly cooked, with the top half being overcooked and the bottom half was basically sashimi and lacked any kind of flavor.  The ""cilantro mashed potatoes"" was not great either, in that it was a weird color of green and basically tasted like mashed potatoes that came out of a box.We were given free flan for sitting at the crappy table in the back; however, even that wasn't very good.   I think it might be that Brooklyn hates me, but I'm never coming back to this place.",1.0

"I lived in Bogotá, Colombia so hopefully this review is helpful as I can compare with real Colombian food.We liked Bogota Bistro.  We went on a Sunday afternoon and had the ajiaco, empanadas, arroz con pollo and fruit juices -1.  The blackberry and lulo juices are fantastic, a tad on the sweet side.2.  The ajiaco was as good as the best I've had in Colombia.  Amazing flavor.3.  The arroz con pollo was also delicious, and came with moist plaintains, frijoles, red cabbage (repollo) and avocado.  Definitely a signature dish for them.4.  The empanadas were fantastic, particularly the goat cheese empanada (have it with the sour cream salsa).The only thing I found slightly annoying is that it appears the restaurant is trying to sell their salsas separately.  So when we ordered a little extra aji salsa for our dishes we were charged $1 extra.  Unwarranted (and highly unusual for any Colombian restaurant or American restaurant) in my opinion.Otherwise, the ambiance is great (Botero paintings on the wall, maps of Colombia, etc.), great Latin music (Fonseca, etc.), cheerful staff (we seemed to get the one gringo waitress convinced she had to speak with us in Spanish... :), the food was fantastic (although I would add the proper Colombian restaurants in Astoria, and Jackson Heights have equally delicious food (La Fonda Antioqueña, Natives).  As does El Tequilazo in midtown Manhattan).  We'd definitely go back.I hope this review is helpful.",4.0
"I gotta say, I had high hopes for this place. To start off with, we made reservations for 8:30. When we got there...apparently they were running behind. We weren't seated for roughly an hour.

I can't honestly comment on the music...It couldn't have left a big impression because I can't remember it. But the decor was nice and the lighting was appropriate.As for the food. I am first generation Colombian and this food was actually pretty underwhelming. I was excited to try out a restaurant with all the dishes my parents and grandma used to make for me. But they didn't even come close. The bandeja paisa...a very typical Colombian dish...was heavy on the morcilla and weak on the chorizo. The empanadas...eh...nothing notable about the meat or sauce.

I'm not saying it's not supposed to be fatty...but there are better cuts. These were easily 80-90% fat. Having said all that...the drinks were delicious.

Met a friend here for dinner on a busy Friday night a few weeks ago. I was smart to think ahead and made reservations since I knew there was always a wait. We got there and were sat right away while walk-ins were on a 45 min wait. But I digress. Its quite small in the restaurant and they have a lot of tables so good luck if you're even slightly on the heavier side. I had a late lunch so I didn't order a lot but the entire menu looked delicious. I chose the arroz con pollo while my friend had the crabcakes. Both were hearty dishes for an average price. I would go back again to try the other dishes out. Remember to make reservations!,4.0

Super fresh and tasty!! For an entree, I ordered a chicken dish...not quite sure what exactly I had.  It came with barbq sauce on the side.  The rice and beans were good, but I've also had better up in the bronx.  Overall, this is a fun place to go with friends.  The atmosphere is fabulous, but the food is average.  I'm sure I will be back!",4.0

The server recommended that I try the Catfish Tacos, and so I went for it. OMG. Best choice I've ever made. The catfish was soooo flavorful, my taste buds were definitely on a rollercoaster ride.

"Yummy, yummy in my tummy!Food is fresh, delicious, well-seasoned and wholesome.  There is also quite a variety--I am a vegetarian, and had many choices.My bf had the Rellenos Plantanos (sp?), which were sweet plantains filled with chicken in some sort of mole.  He also had the tortilla soup, also very good.  As a main course he had the catfish tacos with rice and beans and the cilantro mashed potatoes.  Mashed potatoes were interesting.  Not sure that I would eat them again, but I can imagine someone thinking they are tasty.I had the mixed salad with the addition of grilled tofu, and then the vegetarian plate with:  rice and beans, spinach, kale and french fries.  I love french fries.Portions are HU-MON-GOUS.  We were both pretty full after our appetizers.Cocktails were so fresh and inexpensive.  They had happy hour all night long the night we were there.Our server was personable and knowledgeable of the menu.My only negative comments--when we were at the bar waiting for a table, we sat for a good 10 minutes without even being acknowledged by the bartender.  Granted, it was very busy, but 10 minutes is a long time to make people wait without even saying ""hi guys, sorry but I'll just be a sec"".Other than that, had a great time.",4.0
"We went past Bogota last night on our way to another fifth avenue spot and were thankful we didn't have our heart set on cilantro mashed potatos....the line was out the door and the place was packed. Like it is every time we go. These guys don't need my review, but I have to write it anyway. I love love love this place, and the men who own it are wonderful. My partner and I had a commitment ceremony last summer and Jorge and his team prepared the food and had it waiting for us to take to our space in Manhattan. It was copious, delicious and so reasonable I managed to have an upper east side wedding on an $8,000 budget. We fed 70 people and had enough for the staff to all get some to take home. Everyone was raved saying it was the best wedding food they had ever had. If you don't at least taste the empanadas here your missing out on a lot. They are one of my many favorites, fried so light you don't even notice they are fried. The shrimp ceviche is so good I had a plate of it before I got dressed for my wedding.....just to make sure I got some. And don't get me started on the cilantro mashed potatos...I've tried to recreate them at home to no avail.The clasic mojitos are divine, I can never drink just one. Overall, I'm thrilled that this place is only three blocks away from home, I would happily eat every meal here.",5.0
"Yum, Bogota is delicious and completely reasonable.  My friend and I  shared a pitcher of white sangria - really refreshing.  We tried the red sangria but did not like it - it was too heavy and the red wine mixed with orange juice was a little strange.  We started with the chip sampler - which definitely could have been shared by more people.  The dips were tasty - not amazing but good.  We then had the Pattacon Garlic Shrimp which I thought was delicious - great flavor and a good size as well!  We also shared the Arroz Con Pollo which was good but not fantastic - the rice definitely needed more flavor.   Our waitress thought we should order more food which would have been absurd.  Lastly - outside of the bathroom they have jars full of not only condoms but lube.  Nice touch.",4.0
"Geez, how have I gone this long without a glowing review of Bogota?  It has definitely become my go-to place for drinks and apps at the bar when I'm feeling down or just in the mood for amazing mojitos.Yes, Bogota has the best mojito in NYC.  I've tried many and Bogota always comes out on top!  I suggest getting the fried calamari which is always so tender and served with a great dipping sauce.  Chips/Guac and the chicken quesadilla are also awesome.  I actually enjoy the apps much more than the entrees here, so we now just get a few appetizers to share at the bar and use the money we saved on more drinks!Great festive atmosphere and a fun place to bring friends!",5.0
"Tasty, intimate spot with good buzz, fine music, excellent food and reasonable prices. Popular place with the young ladies, and a lively ""date restaurant."" Attentive, helpful service. The goat cheese empanadas alone should be enough to put your date in the mood. And if that doesn't get her, the smooth trio pumping out Latin jams sounding like one big continuous riff on the Sex And The City theme will. Walks the fine line between the kind of environment, food and beverage choices that keep the girls smiling and the heartier menu options and prices that make the guys happy to see them that way. The sangria, margarita and flavored mojitos open the evening well, and the sugared churros with dark chocolate and caramel dipping sauces should substantially increase your odds for getting lucky post-meal.",4.0
"Goat Cheese Empanada ..... if that isn't enough to make you go there, well, go because the service is amazing, the place is warm and inviting, the prices are reasonable and the menu is full of carnivore, gluten free and veggie head options.

"Went here last night with some of my girlfriends for dinner.  We originally picked this place due to Brooklyn Dine In.  However, when I looked at the menu, all of us scrapped that idea and ordered whatever we wanted.  For starters, I ordered a red sangria.  Not that good.  I've had way better elsewhere in the city.  Switched over to a corona for the second round.  We ordered the plantain chips with a bean dip as an appetizer.  Damn, those are the best freakin' plantain chips I think I've ever had! Super fresh and tasty!! For an entree, I ordered a chicken dish...not quite sure what exactly I had.  It came with barbq sauce on the side.  The rice and beans were good, but I've also had better up in the bronx.  Overall, this is a fun place to go with friends.  The atmosphere is fabulous, but the food is average.  I'm sure I will be back!",4.0
"Went here last night on a Thursday.  Happy hour all night which was great!  Although my girlfriend and I split a pitcher of sangria.  It was Brooklyn's restaurant week, which was nice because the menu is so large that I would have spent way too long poring over all my options.  I had the sweet potato quinoa cakes for my entree which was delicious!  Plus I really loved the coconut flan for dessert.  It may not be the most ""authentic"" Colombian food, but who cares...the food was great!  The food came out quick also and the waiter was very nice...music wasn't too loud and the ambiance was fun.  All in all...would love to come back!",4.0
"I came here for the first time with my fiance for a late lunch/dinner not knowing what to expect, but since we are both passionate about food, we are down to try anything new.  And I'm soooooo glad we did! They start you off with fried plantain chips with their special Aji sauce, which we gobbled down in 10 seconds. AMAZING! The perfect appetizer to munch on while you wait for your meal. The server recommended that I try the Catfish Tacos, and so I went for it. OMG. Best choice I've ever made. The catfish was soooo flavorful, my taste buds were definitely on a rollercoaster ride. The tacos came with a smoking chipotle sauce that paired so well with the catfish. I'm drooling just thinking about it. Never thought that fish could taste this good.

"My dining partner thought they put green food dye in the mashed potatoes.Yes, green food dye. Because Bogota's signature ""Cilantro Mashed Potatoes"" were radioactively green. And hardly tasted of the amount of cilantro needed to make potatoes that green. They were, in fact, rather bland. And lukewarm.I was asked by my server how I wanted my corn-crusted salmon cooked. I thought this odd. I've never been asked how I'd like a piece of fish cooked before. I figure that's best left up to the chef with consideration to the type of fish and cooking process. No matter, I ordered medium rare, and I got an overcooked piece of salmon with very little flavor. Boo!The kale was yummy, but also lukewarm.Service was really great, especially considering how packed the place was. Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.

Delicious. We ordered a full pitcher of the regular margaritas which lasted at least 3 glasses for each of us. Perfect strength and flavor. Being a vegetarian, I ordered the vegetarian tacos and my bf ordered the arroz con pollo.

Plus, as an added bonus, they have a house aji sauce on all of the tables that is really tasty. I will definitely be back.",4.0
"I love the food here!  The maduros are addictive, and while I want to branch out, I can't help but order the chicken tortilla soup again and again, sometimes alternating with the catfish tacos.  I've had brunch here once, and it was fabulous.  I do find that the daytime kitchen staff seems to be less skilled than the evening kitchen staff so that lunch is more of a gamble (even ordering the same dishes), and I would personally prefer a space that is more calming and elegant, and that doesn't scream PARTY!!! quite as much.  But the service is great and the food is excellent, so we'll keep coming back.",4.0
Love the food here. They give you a ton of food and I clean my plate. The servers and hostesses are really nice. The ambiance is great. Going on a day with all-day happy hour ($3 beer) is awesome! A favorite.,4.0
"Where do I even begin? My favorite latin food in all of Park Slope, maybe even all of Brooklyn. One of the few places the boy and I can agree upon. The mojitos are amazing, especially when they're half priced. Everything that I've had here has been very tasty, especially the fish tacos, plantain coated chicken and arroz con pollo. The only negatives are the sometimes long waits on the weekends and the music which is way too loud sometimes.",4.0
Food was great and plentiful.  Service was excellent and not forced.  Of course the company that was with was great.  Came to celebrate at this spot for my b-day and will def go back another time very soon.,4.0

"We've been to Bogota a few times and have always enjoyed it. The food is delicious, they have tons of veggie and gluten-free options and the staff is friendly. We've even had it delivered and found the food just as delicious. But the staff went above and beyond this weekend. After accommodating our last-minute five-adult, one baby party for brunch in their giant dining room, they managed to find my expensive Invisalign trays that had mistakenly been cleared from the table. The bus boys fished them out of the downstairs garbage and they even washed them off before returning them to me. I can't imagine a place going more above-and-beyond than that! This is a great place for large groups, small groups, any groups!",5.0
"3.75 stars.  I ordered the ""bandeja paisa"" platter that came with skirt steak, pork chicharron, arepa, rice and beans, fried egg, maduros and avocado.The steak and pork were both definitely very tender and delicious!  The rice (I ordered white rice) was yummy, very moist and a little sweet.  I didn't eat the beans (I don't like beans).  I only got one slice of avocado on top of a red cabbage salad =( For dessert we shared some sort of dough balls that came with 3 dipping sauces.  The balls were much dough-ier and less sweet than we thought.  The dipping sauces were chocolate (which was yummy) and two others sauces (I think one was guava), both of which I didn't really like.Lively atmosphere with loud music and colorful decor.  Fun place to come with a group of friends.",4.0

"We went here for my birthday and I really dig the place. We sat outside in the area that looks like my auntie's backyard BBQ blast from the past.

We started off with arepa de chocolo and white sangrias. Both were pretty damn tasty. We also sampled some empenadas: steak and chicken. Both were good, but I'm partial to our sweet Filipino versions. For entrees, I ordered the Bandeja Paisa (Colombian Platter) grilled skirt steak, pork chicharron, arepa, rice & beans, fried egg, maduros, avocado. To add to the goodness, I got the Colombian chorizo with it. Man, this was tasty! The grilled skirt steak was tender and flavorful. The lean part of the chicarron was also pretty good, but I had to pass on the fatty mcfat fat. At this point, my blood pressure was already rising with the rest of the meat goodness. It didn't help that I kept downing everything with awesome alcohol. Oh well, its my birthday and I ate whatever I wanted. Two thumbs up! I'm definitely coming back to get my grub on.",4.0
"Two words: Tortilla Soup.Delicious.Hands down the best hangover remedy I've found in years.

"My new favorite place in NY! My cousin and I stumbled upon this restaurant while staying around the corner visiting family.  We went in on a Saturday afternoon and I was delighted to find it was happy hour until 5.  AND they had Caipirinhas on special for $6... check, check, check (I had a guava and a pineapple caipirinha... Both were fantastic, but I reccomend the pineapple).  We split an empanada sampler for an appetizer... all 4 we tried were delicious! (Carne, black bean & feta, guava & Cream cheese, and tomato-cheese-something=my least favorite).  We also split a plate of arroz con pollo that was some of the best I've ever had.  We left full, tipsy, and only $60 down between the 2 of us.  Funny thing was, the family we stayed with made reservations to take us to dinner that night.  Guess where they took us?  We had no problem returning! This time, we sat on the patio (nice) and ordered off the dinner menu.  I had roast pork in some kind of orange-mojo... honestly, the orange mojo wasn't great... I couldn't really even taste it though.  Once I squeezed a ton of lime (as my Cuban self loves me some lime pork) and added a dash of hot sauce I was back to feasting on my dream dish.  Love this place!!!!!",5.0

"After being turned away from Lobo down the street (which advertised as closing at 11 but turned us away at 10:09) we happened upon this little spot. The service was not at all hurried (despite it being only 45 minutes till closing). the hostess made sure we knew that happy hour was continuing till 11, so we made sure to order as many drinks as humanly possible in that time.The Margaritas, Sangritas (1/2 margarita, 1/2 sangria), caipirinhas, and Brazilian Sangrias were stellar. Very delicious and super strong. We both had the empanada sampler, which was a delight! The Domino (a melt-in-your-mouth rendition of bean and cheese) was so good that my friend ordered an extra. Each Empanada comes with its own perfectly paired dipping sauce, and while mixing and matching was fun for all of two seconds, the original pairings were hard to beat.The meal was finished off with a delectable Tres Leches cake; a cold sponge cake drenched in sweet milk and caramel topped with strawberries and cream.Our server Celeste was very friendly and again, never rushed our service and made sure we were well fed and taken care of.",5.0
"Excited about Colombian food, I joined my siblings and their significant others  to this place in Park Slope after picking up some Cake Man Raven's red velvet cake. First impression, happy hour joint with food. Latin music throughout so if you are looking to take out a date, who you are looking to get to know with nice conversations, this should be reserved for the 2nd or 3rd date. They also have an outdoor sitting area but it was too cold. My brother in law was raving about the PLATANOS CON QUESO (baked maduros, queso blanco, sour cream) and it's a must try, unless you don't like cheese. The beef empanada was yummy. My sister also ordered the CARIBBEAN COCONUT FRIED SHRIMP. I'm not a coconut person so I didn't try the shrimp but it was served on a tropical salad which is made from red cabbage and it was SUPER yummy. I finished the salad part, which was alot tastier than the POM PALM salad I ordered with a cilantro dressing. It was tooo sour/acidic.I ordered the SKIRT STEAK CHIMICHURRO, one of my favorite Latin type dishes but I have to say, the highlights of this dish is the chimichurri sauce but I've had much better elsewhere. Again, anything cilantro they make is too sour for my taste and I'm a lover of sour/acidity. There also wasn't any heat to it. I would recommend Cabana's in the city or Forest Hills if you crave a nice skirt steak chimichurri. They have a kids menu and I ordered the MINI ARROZ con POLLO for my 4 yr old son. It was alright. I didn't care too much for the shredded pieces of  bland chicken they placed onto of the rice. If that's their version of Arroz con Pollo, I'm not a fan. Last but not least, the drinks, I had the classic and the pear mojitos. Both very good but stick with the classic. The pear version is on the sweet side with all the nectar juice. Since my entree wasn't the highlight of the meal and nothing really wowed me, I give them 3 stars, I would go back to try something else but I wouldn't say I'm a fan (according to Yelp's rating definition), hence, no 4 stars.",3.0
"Good menu with a variety of very authentic dishes and everything was prepared very well.  The Moqueca was excellent and I'm usually not a big guac fan but there's was very refreshing and had a lot of flavor.  Pretty casual, not too expensive service made good recommendations but was very slow.  Also note that a lot of their corn meal options are gluten free.",4.0
"A favorite spot of ours - the food is great. I love the pom palm salad with plantain crusted chicken breast. And the coconut flan is the best flan I've ever had. Wait staff is friendly. It's an inviting, fun place to be. They have a lovely section in the back that feels like a garden (though it's enclosed with a glass ceiling). They offer great happy hour specials on drinks... Mojitos and Capereinas there are very tasty. They often have good bands playing live - not overpoweringly loud, just energetic and fun. Reasonably priced. Great restaurant!",5.0
"HUGE menu...a little overwhelming - But I am pretty convinced that everything on the menu would be darn tasty.They were pretty packed (it was a MONDAY!) so we started out at the bar. When it came time for us to sit, the hostess was both nice and straight-up by telling us that the one table available was ""in the middle of things"".  We peeked around at the table and since were actually fine at our bar perches, we chose to stay at the bar, we just moved down a bit for more leg room (also at her suggestion.)  I am glad we did - the restaurant itself is full of color, noise and lots of hipsters  - it also has ""a lot going on"" decor-wise. The seats at the bar kept us intimate and the party could go on around us.That was a good balance for me - our bartender/server was so happy that we liked the classic Colombian entree (we shared - that was fine - servings are huge) that she offered us orange pound cake on the house! (maybe she does that for everyone, but it felt real in the moment...)Will definitely go back again - there are multiple dishes I look forward to trying and there is a tempting brunch -",4.0

Each Empanada comes with its own perfectly paired dipping sauce, and while mixing and matching was fun for all of two seconds, the original pairings were hard to beat.The meal was finished off with a delectable Tres Leches cake; a cold sponge cake drenched in sweet milk and caramel topped with strawberries and cream.Our server Celeste was very friendly and again, never rushed our service and made sure we were well fed and taken care of.",5.0
"Excited about Colombian food, I joined my siblings and their significant others  to this place in Park Slope after picking up some Cake Man Raven's red velvet cake. First impression, happy hour joint with food. Latin music throughout so if you are looking to take out a date, who you are looking to get to know with nice conversations, this should be reserved for the 2nd or 3rd date. They also have an outdoor sitting area but it was too cold. My brother in law was raving about the PLATANOS CON QUESO (baked maduros, queso blanco, sour cream) and it's a must try, unless you don't like cheese. The beef empanada was yummy. My sister also ordered the CARIBBEAN COCONUT FRIED SHRIMP. I'm not a coconut person so I didn't try the shrimp but it was served on a tropical salad which is made from red cabbage and it was SUPER yummy. I finished the salad part, which was alot tastier than the POM PALM salad I ordered with a cilantro dressing. It was tooo sour/acidic.I ordered the SKIRT STEAK CHIMICHURRO, one of my favorite Latin type dishes but I have to say, the highlights of this dish is the chimichurri sauce but I've had much better elsewhere. Again, anything cilantro they make is too sour for my taste and I'm a lover of sour/acidity. There also wasn't any heat to it. I would recommend Cabana's in the city or Forest Hills if you crave a nice skirt steak chimichurri. They have a kids menu and I ordered the MINI ARROZ con POLLO for my 4 yr old son. It was alright. I didn't care too much for the shredded pieces of  bland chicken they placed onto of the rice. If that's their version of Arroz con Pollo, I'm not a fan. Last but not least, the drinks, I had the classic and the pear mojitos. Both very good but stick with the classic. The pear version is on the sweet side with all the nectar juice. Since my entree wasn't the highlight of the meal and nothing really wowed me, I give them 3 stars, I would go back to try something else but I wouldn't say I'm a fan (according to Yelp's rating definition), hence, no 4 stars.",3.0
"Good menu with a variety of very authentic dishes and everything was prepared very well.  The Moqueca was excellent and I'm usually not a big guac fan but there's was very refreshing and had a lot of flavor.  Pretty casual, not too expensive service made good recommendations but was very slow.  Also note that a lot of their corn meal options are gluten free.",4.0
"A favorite spot of ours - the food is great. I love the pom palm salad with plantain crusted chicken breast. And the coconut flan is the best flan I've ever had. Wait staff is friendly. It's an inviting, fun place to be. They have a lovely section in the back that feels like a garden (though it's enclosed with a glass ceiling). They offer great happy hour specials on drinks... Mojitos and Capereinas there are very tasty. They often have good bands playing live - not overpoweringly loud, just energetic and fun. Reasonably priced. Great restaurant!",5.0
"HUGE menu...a little overwhelming - But I am pretty convinced that everything on the menu would be darn tasty.They were pretty packed (it was a MONDAY!) so we started out at the bar. When it came time for us to sit, the hostess was both nice and straight-up by telling us that the one table available was ""in the middle of things"".  We peeked around at the table and since were actually fine at our bar perches, we chose to stay at the bar, we just moved down a bit for more leg room (also at her suggestion.)  I am glad we did - the restaurant itself is full of color, noise and lots of hipsters  - it also has ""a lot going on"" decor-wise. The seats at the bar kept us intimate and the party could go on around us.That was a good balance for me - our bartender/server was so happy that we liked the classic Colombian entree (we shared - that was fine - servings are huge) that she offered us orange pound cake on the house! (maybe she does that for everyone, but it felt real in the moment...)Will definitely go back again - there are multiple dishes I look forward to trying and there is a tempting brunch -",4.0
"Stopped here for a quick bite before meeting up with friends.  I had the Cuban sandwich, which really wouldn't have been up to snuff even if I hadn't been to Cuba and ate the real thing. The ham was way too salty and also cut in slabs, not thin slices, which is how it's done in Cuba. Also a little ""too much of this"" and ""too much of that"" coming from different regions/cultures in Latin America that have nothing to do with one another. It's certainly a cute little place, but more of a conceptual cultural dining experience, not the real deal. I'll instead be taking my business over to Jackson Heights the next time I'm in town for something that's made with more Latin American spirit and authenticity.",3.0

"Let me start by saying that based on all the positive things I've read/heard about Bogota, I am willing to give it a second chance.However, my experience here was pretty terrible.

We knew that the only remedy would be brunch complete with some greasy eggs, greasy sausages, greasy potatoes, greasy grits, etc etc greasy greasy.So I had been wanting to go to Bogota for a while, and was really excited when we decided to have brunch here. We started with some guac, which was really delicious....but then came our mains.  Before I even tried it, I was turned off. I got the Columbian Migas de Arepas, which was supposed to be a scrambled egg, chorizo, arepa, scallion, and tomato concoction. I looked at my plate once it arrived, and I honestly thought that someone had eaten a scrambled egg, a burnt arepa, a chorizo stick, a few stalks of scallions, and a tomato a few moments earlier and just barfed it onto my plate. It was possibly the most unappetizing-looking dish I have ever encountered in my life. It basically looked like what I was trying to keep down the night before, just served to me on a platter. Anyway, after I got over the look of the dish and tried some, my next reaction was that it was cold. After I got over the fact that it was cold, I tried it, and it was actually relatively tasty. Nothing to rave about though. The proportions of egg to the rest of the ingredients were also completely off-- there were only a few identifiable specks of egg, even though the menu said it was a scrambled egg dish with those other what-nots...My friend's dish also came out cold. He said that his beans tasted like pot. I laughed, tried it, and then agreed. Overall, the meal was really disappointing and not enjoyable at all.

I took my parents here when they were in town and they loved it, but have taken plenty of other demographics here and everyone has been impressed. Out of the many times I've been here, only a couple not-so-great experiences. Once we ordered several drinks during happy hour but were charged regular price... And sometimes they rush out the mixed drinks and they aren't so good. E.g. big chunks of ice in a pina colada. But the staff has always been super nice and even though we have had to send a couple drinks back (and once maybe a dessert), they always come back to us with problem solved.  I love (maybe a little too much) all the girly, fruity mojito flavors they offer.

"The sangria here is the best.

"I want to start by saying that the food here is phenomenal.  My wife and I have been here many, many times and we have never been displeased with anything we have ordered from the menu whether it's food or drink.Having said that, the service we had the last time we went was so bad that as much as we love the food, we'll never go back.  The time between when we got seated and when we ordered drinks was 30 minutes.  After that wait, which the waitress graciously apologized for, we waited another 20 minutes before asking what was going on with our drinks.  Eventually, my wife got frustrated and asked to speak to the manager.  After explaining to him how we had been seated and waiting almost an hour just to get our first round of drinks and appetizers, we finally received both.  Unfortunately, they brought out the wrong appetizer for my wife and the waiting continued.  At that point, I wasn't sure if our waitress was avoiding us because she was embarrassed, or just plain stupid, but we didn't see her until she came out while we were eating our main course to tell us that she was sorry and as an apology, she wanted to comp us a coconut flan.  Maybe some people would be satisfied with that, but at that point, our dinner had already been ruined and we were ready to get out of there.  On our way out, the manager saw us and didn't even acknowledge that we were visibly upset by the experience.  That was pretty much the nail in the coffin for us and Bogota.  Yes, it was a busy Saturday evening.  But no more than any other restaurant we've ever been to, and not wall-to-wall, packed busy (our waitress had time to chat with the people a couple of tables over about places they have been on vacation) and by the time we left, there were actually empty tables and no one waiting to be seated.  If you decide to go anyway, expect to take your time, and keep thinking about the food.  I recommend the chicken empanada, the skirt steak is fantastic, and my wife loved the fish tacos.  Also, the mojitos are good.",3.0

"First and foremost, if you are a Sangria fan then get yourself to this place right away.  I had the best Sangria of my life here.  It's not to be missed. Of course, that's not all there is to this bistro.  The food is excellent and the staff very courteous and quick.  I had the Arepa, something I've never tried before (delicious), and a Cubano sandwich (also delicious).  All of my dinner companions loved their food as well and we deemed the place good enough to go our of our way for.",5.0

"Bogota is my go-to place for having people out to dinner. I took my parents here when they were in town and they loved it, but have taken plenty of other demographics here and everyone has been impressed. Out of the many times I've been here, only a couple not-so-great experiences. Once we ordered several drinks during happy hour but were charged regular price... And sometimes they rush out the mixed drinks and they aren't so good. E.g. big chunks of ice in a pina colada. But the staff has always been super nice and even though we have had to send a couple drinks back (and once maybe a dessert), they always come back to us with problem solved.  I love (maybe a little too much) all the girly, fruity mojito flavors they offer. The arroz con pollo, so good. Well, everything is good, really. Go here with some friends and have a pitcher of mojitos -- You won't regret it.",4.0
This is probably my favorite restaurant I've ever been to.  I ordered the Venezuelan plate and it was the most satisfying meal EVER.  And the guava mojitos...to die for.  I lived in BK for six months and wish I had gone everyday.,5.0
"very friendly staff -- one of the owners (the costa rican guy?) seated us both times I've been there. I wonder how long they will be there most nights? They have a diverse menu and everything I've tried so far has been good. They have a salmon encrusted in something (plantains?) that is really tasty, and the salads are good, too. Drinks are well mixed AND strong. So don't let that fruity flavor fool you. Take your time before ordering that third rum punch.",4.0

"They REALLY love cilantro here which is a problem because, well, I don't. It's one of those flavors you either love or hate, and I'm more on the hate side, although I'm trying to learn to appreciate the stuff. I ordered the arroz con pollo and got something TOTALLY different than I expected (I'm used to the Dominican spots in the hood and home cooked Puerto Rican meals, so I should have known better)...the food was definitely high quality, fresh everything, but it just wasnt the arroz con pollo I'm used to. For starters it was shredded chicken, not pieces of chicken, which usually results in less moist meat and I don't necessarily WANT chicken in every bite...but whatever. there was also mad cilantro going on. the beans were good though everything was cooked well, can't really complain, but this is definitely fancier Latin food that tries to cater to an upscale crowd, prices obviously reflect that as well. The service also didn't really strike me the right way. It's not that they were UNfriendly, cuz they weren't...it was just a little odd. I don't know. The plantain chips are addictive, beware. You'll leave full. I'd go back and try something different but it's not a place I'll frequent.",3.0
"While the food is great, the service is extremely lacking.  Drinks are super over priced, $12 for watermelon mojito with nothing too special of a rum?

Especially when the wed all night happy hours fruit mojitos are supposed to be $6! Apparently watermelon is not a fruit.  Well I suppose there's a sucker born every minute. Don't ask the manager though, he gave us a snide and careless response to why watermelon is apparently not classified as a fruit. Make sure you read the menu closely because there is a load of stuff to read and it is very misleading. Aside from mediocre and expensive drinks the food is good, ropa vieja, AWESOME!  Empanadas are great too, lots of different filings to choose from and they do corn and wheat empanadas!  Took a really long time to get the food though and on a wed. night, maybe things were off; the service staff at least was trying to be good at their job (with the exception of the manager).  Go there but if you feel indifferent especially after talking to the management don't be surprised.",2.0
The food was pretty good. I went on a Wednesday during Happy Hour. I had two Mojitos. They were cheap and very tasty. Our waitress was very sweet. We ordered a bunch of appetizers.

Its not like we ordered the animals on the brink of extinction sampler platter.  Its calamari-what restaurant runs out of calamari? (Bogota). Whole fried snapper promised to be something spectacular but was very salty and the accompanying coconut rice was too sweet and gummy.  Chimichurri skirt steak was delicious though the actual chimichurri sauce was over kicked with vinegar.  Shrimp in garlic sauce is tasty (not really hard to mess THAT up) and the pernil marinated in Columbian beer tastes more like smoked BBQ pulled pork.  In eavesdropping on other patrons plates, with discretion of course, I noticed some repeater dishes and the chicharon seemed to make multiple appearances.
