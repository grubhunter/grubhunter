"Located right next to Brooklyn's DMV aka where people go to cut their lives shorter,  lies an oasis of beer battered fish, short ribs and five spice calamari taco. Coney shack has been dropping the bomb flavor on your taste buds for the past couple years and with good reason - they know what makes the mouth pop.With a modest cart and a food truck roaming Manhattan on certain days, Coney Shack is no stranger to social media and the people who love to promote delicious food. Even winning the 2015 Vendy award for rookie of the year isnt a surprise. I recommend getting the Holy Phuc. This monstroucity thats part BBF and hot dog will have you singing the national anthem backwards. Its just f°ckin good. There are also a variety of hot sauces you can add to kick up the heat. I'm coming back for that Hainese chicken burrito. Count on it.",5.0
"Damn you Food cart from the heavens! why have you been sent when I'm trying to lose weight?! today Coney Shack's Artist painted me a canvas of food similar to a Salvador Dali masterpiece. strokes of color on a pallet of tortillas, my eyes darted from left to right in a symphony of color. salivating like pavlov's dogs on command i stared at the bountiful feast before me. simply amazing.let the artist do his work, tell him you're hungry and let him pick. don't be a whiner, no greens, no onions, no this, no that. just take it like a man (or woman) and get what you get! $14.95 and I'm floating on cloud nine. the food is fantastic. service is fantastic. they take credit cards! fantastic! and it was almost 70 degrees out today. life does not get better. try this place.you'll thank me.",5.0
"Coney Shacks Fish Tacos Ruined My Life!Ok, maybe that is a bit of an exaggeration, but the fish tacos at Coney Shack have heavily altered my lunch habits in the last 2 months or so, maybe for the better?Tacos:On a standard day you have 6 tacos to choose from on their menu (3 for $11) if they have all the ingredients and you can mix and match them in any way you choose. My personal favorite is the fish taco (if you haven't figured that out by now). The crispy flakiness of the beer battered layer pairs to near perfection with all the other ingredients. The fish is soft and cooked just right. It is their #1 seller and has made its way into my heart. Other major winners are the tofu, short rib and calamari tacos. The tofu is soft and gooey on the inside with a thin layer of deep fried goodness to hold it all together.I could go into deeper details on all the tacos, but I'm trying to keep this review under 2,000 words.Hot Dogs:Generous portions of toppings. Calamari is the top dog here.Overall: 4.5 StarsThe 3 for $11 deal is a good portioned lunch and it should/will satisfy you until your next meal.It has been a while since a food truck so caught my attention and forced me to change my planned lunch for the day when I noticed they are in the area.Make sure to arrive to their food truck location before 1:00pm! They recently increased the quantity of fish they bring for the tacos, but they still disappear quickly and I have been distraught the 2-3 times it has occurred to me (this was before they increased their inventory).If you find them near you, cancel all your previous lunch plans and pay them a visit! You won't regret it!Now if only I was able to check-in to their food truck from midtown.Here is their twitter so you can follow their every move and get lunch. Just make sure not to order too many fish tacos just in case I arrive there a little late for lunch.twitter.com/ConeyShack",5.0
"Ate here yesterday for the first time , after hearing all the hype an seeing it on news 12 and all over Instagram I had to try it , plus it around the corner from home. All I gotta say is there is some serious fusion going on here the food is unreal. I ordered a beef short rib taco , a garlic pork taco an a crunchy fish taco and ya gotta get a holy phuc dog. Cause it's so good will make u say holy fuck . Food is super fresh and the sauces on all the food is a great finish to crazy good food. The hype on this place is real",5.0
"Coney Shack recently branched out to feed the hungry Manhattanites from its original location on Coney Island. Coney Shack fuses the flavors of Southeast Asian cuisine with favorite beach bites like tacos, hot dogs, grilled cheese, and quesadillas. I tried Coney Shack at this year's (2015) Vendy Awards. The offering included a trio of tacos: Vietnamese Beef Short Rib, Beer Battered Crunchy Fish, and Five-Spice Calamari. The tacos were topped with crunchy cabbage slaw, lemongrass aioli, pickled daikon, cilantro, and spicy mayo...just to name a few. I don't typically enjoy fried food, so I wasn't a huge fan of the fish or the calamari taco. But if you like fried food, you might like them so don't take my review too seriously ;) The batter to fish ratio was a bit too high (aka too much batter, not enough of the ""real"" thing). The fusion of Mexican and Asian is definitely unique and interesting, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to find the truck and try the food.FYI Coney Shack won Rookie of the Year, so people loved it! Just not my personal favorite..",3.0
"Hands down, THE BEST fish taco I've had to date. The crunchy, flavorful explosion is off the hook. I was a little skeptical at first because of the location--it sits between the DMV and a parking lot, but I always say, it's the little places that we sleep on that always have the best, authentic eats and this is definitely one of them. The guys that work there are always so accommodating--I'm allergic to cilantro so they always modify everything for me and it's always delicious. And CHEAP!! $3.50 for one taco or $9 for 3 and I'm always full after just one. You're doing a great job guys! MUST TRY!",5.0
Best darn tacos in Brooklyn. Everything is on point the guy is mad friendly. He makes his own sauce and they on point. Gonna be the only place I hit from now on when am feeling for them fish or beef tacos.,5.0
"Right now I just finished the left side of their Taco menu, half a luc lac burrito, and a Holy Phuc hotdog.  All I can say is Holy Phuc I want more.Midtown location truck needs to be here more often.   Next time I'm trying the right side of the menu and definitely getting the Holy Phuc again.  Keep up the good work here!",4.0
"Some of the best and most refreshing tacos I've ever had, sometimes I spend more time trying to figure out which tacos I want than I spend actually eating them. The burritos are fantastic and rather large, the hot dogs are phenomenal as well and are a nice change of pace from nearby Nathan's Famous.This may be the only reason to go out of your way and visit the Coney Island DMV, there's nothing better than leaving after a long wait inside and having glorious Vietnamese beef short rib and carmelized garlic glazed pork tacos waiting for you.",5.0
"Last saturday was such a warm Dec day , that I finally got off the couch to hit up Coney Shack, I'm glad I did.I had 2 Vietnamese short Rib Tacos and one Tofu Taco.  The first two were good, but I didn't love them, but the 3rd ( tofu) was awesome.   I know I will be back to order more of those and or some of the seafood tacos.   The nice guy at the shack asked if I wanted hot sauce, I opted to add it via Sriracha , next time I want their sauce and Ill add more hot cock if I need it.  I look forward to the next trip to Coney for Tacos at Coney Shack",4.0
"Found this place on Yelp and the pictures had me sold. So I came here for lunch and got the 3 tacos for $9 which is a great deal and also got a chicka dog. I ordered 2 lemon grass tacos and 1 beef short rib taco. I was disappointed with the beef short rib because of a bad after taste it had. The beef didn't taste fresh so I wouldn't recommend it. But the lemon grass chicken was really good. The chicka hot dog was my favorite, it had so much flavor. Might be one of the best hot dogs I had in a long while. Overall this place is good for a quick bite on a budget.",4.0
"Brief RundownVietnamese Beef Short Rib Taco: 5/5 Best one of the bunch! Meat wasn't overwhelmed by the intense amount of dressing. Pickled vegetables were a nice touch and added a zing to the savory taste.Beer Battered Crunchy Fish: 2.5/5 Surprisingly disappointing. Fish was over fried and it tasted like batter than the fish. All the extra condiments and the dressing was not necessary.  Caramelized Garlic Glaze Pork: 4/5 This made up for the fish taco. The pork meat was excellent, nicely marinated and not overly cooked.",4.0
"I have just had a trio of tacos from this truck for the second time today and they are so good! I got the Vietnamese pork, the short rib, and the crunchy fish tacos, and all three are amazing! Well worth the $11.I have only visited the truck, so I cannot comment on atmosphere or wait times, because I walked right up and did not wait at all to place my order. I had my food less than five minutes later, and was drooling a few minutes after that.Tasty and surprisingly complex flavors in all three tacos. Trust me, get them with everything on them.",5.0
"This is only a review of the truck in Midtown: I been there three times for lunch in the last 2 months and have gotten both of their tacos (fish, calamari, pork, shortrib) and burritos (hainanese chicken, pork), and no item has disappointed me. For a truck, it's a bit on the expensive side, but that's made up by its superior taste.",5.0
"OH HAIL MIGHTY TACOS! My friends have talked so highly of this taco food ""shack"" since this summer. And after quietly stalking them on Twitter, I have discovered they are in the Fidi area on select Tuesdays. Or at least that's what the pattern seemed to conclude. Analyst life. After a failed Sunday attempt to visit the infamous coney shack, I was frantically stalking them on Twitter Tuesday morning in high hopes they will be around the financial district for lunch.. Thank goodness they were. Yay for my taco fix! I made my way down old slip and water street in search of the black food truck. I discovered a discombobulated line and a cute girl taking the food orders. I ordered the combo deal of 3 tacos - Vietnamese beef short rib, five spice calamari and beer battered fish tacos.~ 3 tacos for $11 and $4 per individual taco whereas compared to Brooklyn, it is 3 tacos for $9 or $3.50 per individual taco.  The pricing makes sense considering the location in prime downtown Manhattan. ~ Vietnamese beef short rib taco 5/5 stars - this is my favorite taco of the trio that I ordered. The short rib was extremely tender and full of flavor. The pickled daikon and spicy mayo really put the Asian twist together. ~ Five spice Calarami & Beer battered crunchy fish tacos 3.8/5 - interesting combination of flavors on both and I like it. But the Calarami and fish were barely warm. My coworkers were definitely drooling over my delicious lunch. .*_.**_.*_*._**._.**._.**._.**.*.*_.**.**_***_*._**._**._*.- My boyfriend & I stopped by for some quick bites this afternoon at the Coney Island location. Ordered the same trio of tacos and the porky pork burrito ($9). ~ Thit Ko porky pork burrito 4.2/5 stars - I really liked the Malay hainan rice and all the filings incorporated inside the burrito. Kind of reminds me of fried rice stuffed into a burrito :) One thing to note is the fidi location added in 2 wedges of lime in my order but no limes at the CI location. I strongly believe limes highly help enhance the flavor and can make it or break it.All in all, these tacos & burritos are super delicious and I'm loving the Asian meets Mexican fusion. I love all the fresh ingredients and garnishes. Awesome twist and combination of spices and flavors.",4.0

"Interesting food experience and well worth the price. I hit this truck in the downtown area and compared to some of the other truck lines the wait was short, but don't let this fool you. The food is great. (remember the longest line at 12:15 is always the best food) The first time I tried:1. Five spice squid (Fried Squid with 5 spice, pickled red onion, cilantro-Lemongrass Aioli, tomato basil creole sauce, scallion, and toasted sesame)2. Glazed Pork (Pork caramelized in Vietnamese marinade, pickled daikon, cilantro, pickled peppers, sweet chili spicy mayo, and toasted sesame)3. Short rib taco's (Beef short ribs in  Vietnamese marinade, pickled daikon, cilantro, pickled peppers, sweet chili spicy mayo, and toasted sesame). As others said it was an amazing trio !!!!  The second time i went there i tried a few of the hotdog combinations: 1. Mach Dog - Hotdog with Garlic glazed pork, onion rings, melted cheese, sweet chili mayo, sriracha, and toasted sesame. 2. Holy Phuc - Hotdog with beer battered fish, pickled red onion, melted cheese, tomato basil creole sauce, and lemon grass aioli. Both were good, the Mach Dog was better but the battered fish/red onion combo is amazing. I will be going back !!!!",4.0
"The Coney Shack serves up Vietnamese influenced tacos, quesadillas and hot dogs. They have interesting tacos like beer battered fish and calamari. Not that I got either because they were sold out already...So instead, we got the Vietnamese pork and short rib tacos and the hot dog is covered in the same pork I believe. The pork is much tastier (but oily) than the beef in my opinion. You have to be careful though because the fish sauce smelled up the office and everyone came over to comment (a lot of people do not like the smell of fish sauce). I liked the pickled radishes on top which reminded me of bahn mi but with way less bread (only one flour tortilla). Its IMPOSSIBLE to eat this without having everything fall out.The hot dog was your typical snappy casing hot dog (aka great) and topped with pork. They even have one that's land and sea, meat plus fried fish! I love love love the smell of the cheese they blowtorch melted on top. A bit pricey for a normal sized hot dog though. I was expecting a thicker polish beef dog with more bite.",4.0

I felt the need to write a yelp review just because it was so amazing. There was one guy working there and we asked which tacos he would recommend. His first response was ""I guess this is your first time here! Go with the 3 favorites - fish, beef and the calamari"". Those were the 3 I tried today and all were so good! The fish, then beef, then calamari - that's how I would rate them in order of favorites. I definitely did not expect the fish to taste the way it did. It is beer battered crunch - with a corn flakes crunch! Creative! 3 tacos for $8. 4 tacos for $10. The 4 for $10 deal isn't listed on his board/menu but he was nice enough to offer us the deal. Find me here more this summer! Officially a fan!",5.0
"Coney Island was pretty disappointing but Coney Shack was not. The Asian chef was very friendly and accommodating. I did not expect this food truck to be this diverse, yet execute beyond expectations. The caramelized onions and pickled Vietnamese vegetables brought out the umami of the short rib. The calamari had a nicely spiced batter, and when paired with the chef's choice of sauce was a splendor in the mouth. Although I had just eaten beforehand, I was also interested in the Hainanese chicken burrito paired with my childhood nostalgic scallion ginger sauce. Most Asian fusion restaurants are in it for the gimmick, but I could tell this chef had a passion for food that was exemplified through his flavors. In addition to the crowd favorite tacos, there were also loaded burritos, meat mountain tacos, and a Mexican Asian inspired chiptole-esque rice bowls. A quick 30 second walk from the subway, it is a definite must visit before leaving the area. Coney Island? It should be called Coney Shack.",5.0

"My fiance grew up at the apartments across the street, so every time we visit his family in BK I know I'm in for a treat of quick food at Coney Shack. Located right next to the DMV & police precinct, the food stand is slightly hidden & under the radar so don't be surprised if you drive past it once or twice before finding it. Truly food stand/food truck kind of set up. No seating or anything so expect to stand on the sidewalk while you eat your tacos, or sit in your car. OR you can walk over to Luna Park boardwalk to sit and eat it (if you can make it there without finishing it first!)GET THE FISH TACOS.. with everything on it. Three usually fills me up. That's all you need to know. And yes they take credit card.",5.0
"You really cannot judge a book by it's cover. I went to this place knowingly it had 5/5 stars on Yelp so expecting a giant food truck but when I went, I nearly missed it. It literally is a shack. Though the location of it is small, the food inside was OMG GOODWe ordered the top 3 favorite tacos which are the Calamari, Beef and Fish. The Calamari was a little chewy but still really good. It was also very different from how I normally have it. The Beef was just omgosh. I wanted more. I was also very lucky cuz usually they run out of beef during the day. My favorite one was surprisingly the Fish. It was SO crispy on the outside and the inside was just soft like mashed potatoes. Okay maybe not that soft but the combination of hard and soft was amazing.My son also got the beef grilled cheese. You have to keep in mind that he is a picky eater but he demanded a second one right after. We also tried the Holy Dog as a bonus and thats a hot dog with a fried fish on top. I was stuffed but really wanted to finish it.Overall this place surprised me. I loved every thing they put into the taco. Just the right amount and really makes you want to go back for more. Would I recommend this place to my friends. Hell yes. :D",5.0
3 tacos for $8! What a deal! I'm usually not a taco fan but this Asian fusion definitely worked!

"Went here not expecting much nor did I know what to order so I asked the chef what he recommended and he said the 3 for $9 taco deal and suggested the fish, pork and chicken tacos. I also ordered the Spicy Quesadilla. The Spicy Quesadilla was delicious and packed with flavor. I could've ordered another. As for the tacos I was very impressed with the fish taco as I'm not much of a seafood eater but it was better than the other two tacos I ordered and those weren't bad at all. I will definitely be returning for the fish taco and quesadilla as well as trying some other things on the menu.",5.0

"Ok so no pics of the food. I was to hungry to think of taken pictures. So I come here once in a while blah blah bottom line here's the review I ordered 3 tacos for $8 and a burrito. I had the crunchy fish taco the short rib taco and the garlic pork taco. Fish is in last place with the short rib in second and the pork will now be my go to every time. The fish for me is so so. I'm not really a fish guy. And I feel it's a flavorless for me. Although it's crunchy and dressed up very nice. The short rib is good and dressed up the same way as the garlic pork. So between the 2. The pork is the winner. It has so much flavor and is very unique flavor. I mean garlic pork taco. Really? Who thinks of this stuff? But it freak works and is my favorite off all. Now the burrito I think was $8 alone and it's a big fatty burrito filled with rice and other veggies. I went with the marinated beef cubes in mine. It was very surprisingly very good. Very nice. Hey for a lil hole in the wall grease truck next to the dmv. This place is amazing. This whole meal cost me $18 after adding a snapple to wash down the meal. Plus gave the guy a tip. Yes I ate like a fatso but hey the burrito was cut in half and I only ate a half and left the other at home for when I get back. Love this place. Now that I know what's up I will def be back.

"Asian fusion tacos are a trend that just won't evolve beyond heaping Asian inspired coleslaw and Asian inspired mayonnaise on Asian inspired meats in a Mexican inspired tortilla.

I loved how crispy the fish was in the fish taco, I've never had similar, but the  cilantro sauce does nothing to add complexity. I haven't been able to understand why fish is simply fried within a fish taco rather than marinated in anything, it tastes like something my family would prepare and I would slather in condiments to add any flavor while they'd yell at me for barricading my side of the table with ketchup and BBQ sauce bottles. If a taco is good, I shouldn't want to reach for hot sauce. The calamari was just as crispy in the fish taco, but paired with a lovely sweet and sour sauce that deepened the flavor. The flavor recalled kitschy Cape Cod seafood restaurants for me. I wish the fish taco had a similarly well chosen sauce.",3.0

"My friends and I were visiting from out of town, and due to all the great reviews, we decided to give this place a shot. Although their location is a bit of a walk from the nearest subway, the food was completely worth it! I got three different kinds of tacos (calamari, fish, short rib) and they were all excellent. The calamari wasn't rubbery and was fried perfectly, as was the fish, and the short rib was seasoned and/ or marinated nicely. For $8, comparatively speaking, these three tacos were a bargain and if I'm ever in the Coney Island area again, I wouldn't hesitate to come back and try other things on the menu. FYI, this food truck isn't located near the beach and doesn't have much outdoor seating options aside from two picnic tables, so be prepared to stand while eating or to sit on the sidewalk if needed.",5.0
Cool pop up shack next to the DMV. Its not all that but something different and unique in the area does not happen often. The combination of ingredients is well thought through but might be a bit too much.Very fairly prized. Def a must try for a quick lunch or to try something new.,4.0
"Coney Shack lives up to its reputation here on Yelp. My brother told me this spot served the best fish tacos he's ever had, and they did not disappoint. I hardly had time to really examine all the components of the 6 tacos I bought because I devoured them in about 3 minutes flat. Seriously, if you're nearby, do yourself a favor and stop by Coney Shack. I didn't get to try any of the sides, hot dogs or the burritos but I'll be back soon. The Asian flavored tacos prove that fusion can be done right. The mix of heat, savory and sweet really hit the spot. Faves: the Vietnamese short rib taco and beer battered fish taco. Although to be perfectly frank, I loved them all.  Parking is kind of tough around here with the DMV next door, but hey, I parked my car at the McDonald's around the corner and walked over. It was worth it, and I'm sure McD's didn't mind...",5.0
Was able to catch them parked down in FiDi today. I actually tried their food without checking for a Yelp review (WHO does that?!). Glad a majority agree with me. I had some of the best tacos I've ever eaten in my life. I ordered a short rib + calamari taco. Both were equally delicious. Short rib was cooked perfectly. Calamari fried right. The flavors blew me away. My only regret? Not ordering an extra taco! Although two tacos were more than enough. Look forward to eating there again.,5.0
"This was truly love at first bite!I learned about this food truck while on the super long DMV line. And after a long exhasting morning at the DMV, I exited looking for a quick bite. I noticed a small line forming at this truck and thought Id give the food a try. I chose the fish tacos based on the advice of a DMV worker on the line who definitely did not steer me wrong. The taste could be only described as pure deliciousness from the first to the last bite. Now I truly understand how one reviewer could compare these tacos to crack! I have never tried drugs but I imagine addiction coud not be far from this because I cant stop going to this truck. I even turned on my co-workers and family to these tacos. I now pray before I go that I never meet a line thats to long because theres not much that I wouldnt do for these tacos.",5.0
"I bought 3 Chika Dogs and 3 taco's the first time I came here. After I purchased my first Chika dog, I swiftly went after the other and thought about buying more. Lol. Food tasted really nice.

"I am writing this review now, even though my experience occurred in the fall.  I'm home today, housecleaning during the blizzard, when it hits me...the intense craving for their ""tacos"".   I discovered the Coney Shack truck after a day at the Aquarium with my family.  Looking for something other than sandwiches, I looked through Yelp and saw all it's great reviews.  I was thrilled that it was just a few blocks from the Aquarium, but skeptical about the location.  Nonetheless, I trusted my fellow Yelpers, much to my culinary delight.  I cannot rave enough about how flavorful and delicious the pork, beef and fish ""tacos"" were.  They are definitely not Mexican, but Vietnamese (?) inspired works of art!  Please Coney Shack, come to Queens.  I'm glad to find out that you are in midtown, so that I don't have to wait until the summer to see you again.  However, since I've been avoiding Manhattan like the plague lately, I would truly appreciate it if you came over the bridge this way at least once a month.",5.0
"so I went back to give it another try since the first time was a total disappointment for me, this time it was the total opposite!5 SPICE CALAMARI TACO - delicious and just the right amount of spiceBEER BATTERED CRUNCHY FISH TACO - loved loved loved the cilantro sauce on this, the crunch on fish was deliciousHAINAN CHICKEN BURRITO - so full of flavor in every bite, nice execution on this guys!",4.0

"My friends and I were visiting from out of town, and due to all the great reviews, we decided to give this place a shot. Although their location is a bit of a walk from the nearest subway, the food was completely worth it! I got three different kinds of tacos (calamari, fish, short rib) and they were all excellent. The calamari wasn't rubbery and was fried perfectly, as was the fish, and the short rib was seasoned and/ or marinated nicely. For $8, comparatively speaking, these three tacos were a bargain and if I'm ever in the Coney Island area again, I wouldn't hesitate to come back and try other things on the menu. FYI, this food truck isn't located near the beach and doesn't have much outdoor seating options aside from two picnic tables, so be prepared to stand while eating or to sit on the sidewalk if needed.",5.0
Cool pop up shack next to the DMV. Its not all that but something different and unique in the area does not happen often. The combination of ingredients is well thought through but might be a bit too much.Very fairly prized. Def a must try for a quick lunch or to try something new.,4.0
"Coney Shack lives up to its reputation here on Yelp. My brother told me this spot served the best fish tacos he's ever had, and they did not disappoint. I hardly had time to really examine all the components of the 6 tacos I bought because I devoured them in about 3 minutes flat. Seriously, if you're nearby, do yourself a favor and stop by Coney Shack. I didn't get to try any of the sides, hot dogs or the burritos but I'll be back soon. The Asian flavored tacos prove that fusion can be done right. The mix of heat, savory and sweet really hit the spot. Faves: the Vietnamese short rib taco and beer battered fish taco. Although to be perfectly frank, I loved them all.  Parking is kind of tough around here with the DMV next door, but hey, I parked my car at the McDonald's around the corner and walked over. It was worth it, and I'm sure McD's didn't mind...",5.0
Was able to catch them parked down in FiDi today. I actually tried their food without checking for a Yelp review (WHO does that?!). Glad a majority agree with me. I had some of the best tacos I've ever eaten in my life. I ordered a short rib + calamari taco. Both were equally delicious. Short rib was cooked perfectly. Calamari fried right. The flavors blew me away. My only regret? Not ordering an extra taco! Although two tacos were more than enough. Look forward to eating there again.,5.0
"This was truly love at first bite!I learned about this food truck while on the super long DMV line. And after a long exhasting morning at the DMV, I exited looking for a quick bite. I noticed a small line forming at this truck and thought Id give the food a try. I chose the fish tacos based on the advice of a DMV worker on the line who definitely did not steer me wrong. The taste could be only described as pure deliciousness from the first to the last bite. Now I truly understand how one reviewer could compare these tacos to crack! I have never tried drugs but I imagine addiction coud not be far from this because I cant stop going to this truck. I even turned on my co-workers and family to these tacos. I now pray before I go that I never meet a line thats to long because theres not much that I wouldnt do for these tacos.",5.0
"I bought 3 Chika Dogs and 3 taco's the first time I came here. After I purchased my first Chika dog, I swiftly went after the other and thought about buying more. Lol. Food tasted really nice. Different from what I had tasted in the past. It's taste beat my expectations of it. It tasted exact in every bite which inferred that the recipe was strategized to a perfection.

So packed with flavor and the meat was tender.Garlic Pork Taco: The hubs didn't leave me enough meat to review this properly but from one bite I had, I found it tasty.Overall it's extremely delicious, packed with flavor, lots of fresh veggies for great added texture. BUT they can really put a tad more meat in their tacos. My bites usually contained much more veggies than meat. I was fighting to try and get a piece of meat in every bite.

"4.5 stars.Southeast Asian tacos! Now, that's something new. My buddy's been raving about this lil stand for a while now, but it's so faaaaar from the city (snob, i know). Finally, a day off and a free car ride brought me to Coney Island for the first time ever. And I'm so glad for it: SO GOOD! It's a lot of fun just looking at the menu. Every bite is packed with surprisingly wonderful flavors and textures. Def not the typical Mexican version we're used to and sliiiightly bigger than the ones from Mercadito. At 3 for $8, it's a pretty decent deal for fancy tacos. What we ate: 1. VIETNAMESE BEEF SHORTRIB TACO: Excellent. Very much like a banh mi (Viet sandwich) with the pickled carrots and daikon, but the meat is SHORTRIB- so tender and thoroughly marinated with some slightly sweet and savory sauce. 2. BEER BATTERED FISH TACO: Excellent. The batter is made with CORN FLAKES- so nice and crunchy. Love the texture! And the fish inside is so soft and fresh. Great balance with the crisp slaw and creamy sauce on top. **My only gripe is that the tacos didn't come with lime: that would've added a nice brightness to it. 3. SPICY CASA QUESADILLA with beef: Excellent. Similar meat as the Viet taco. Absolutely love the cream cheesy sauce and jalapeno kick that's slattered on top.  4. MACH DOG: Good. This is one fully loaded hot dog. Cheese, corn flake onion rings and lots of other stuff. It's enjoyable, but I usually like my hot dogs simple, so this can be a bit overwhelming. 5. CHICK A DOG: Good. Chicken is tender and flavorful. 6. YUCA CHEESE TATOR TOTS: Good. The yuca is surprisingly very moist. It's battered in the signature corn flake batter which garners that lovely crunch and flavor of our beloved childhood dry breakfast. I think it can go without the cheese inside tho- too heavy. 7. LYCHEE JASMINE GREEN TEA: Good and refreshing, esp on a warm Summer day. 3 days later and I'm really craving the fish taco. Thinking about making a full day of it: beach, roller coasters and taco. I did hear they're at the LIC flea. Maybe that's the better option....*It's about a 5min walk from the boardwalk. Literally a metal box stationed next to a parking lot. Look closely.",5.0

Pricing is fair enough and good for student-buddies for a long road trip.

Pricing is fair enough and good for student-buddies for a long road trip. And by the way for other reviewers, don't get too overwhelmed when you eat their Tacos and Chika Dog, you might need to clean up the mess on your suit... Pack yourself up with some tissues. Love lots! Clean as you go.",4.0
Best tacos in my neighborhood. Delicious and yummy. I would recommend them to everyone.,5.0

"I can't get enough! I tried all the Tacos, the Chicken ""Casadilla,"" & the Beef Grilled Cheese. The 5-star rating says enough. The flavors & sauces with each taco were perfect combinations.

"My Bff and fellow yelper, Celeste B always raves about this little taco food truck in her hood of Coney Island. I stopped by here since I was not too far from the area and was pleasantly surprised. There were three others in line before me so I had some time to figure out what I wanted to order. This food truck had a door that closes so you don't have to freeze outside while you wait for your food. The food truck also has a small counter if you wanted to wolf down your food right there, which is what I saw a customer doing. I loved that they had a big gallon of antibacterial hand gel on the counter for customers. Now to the food, I ordered the chicken quesadillas and the  $3 for $7 pork, beef, and fish tacos. The food was very hot and very tasty. My favorite was the quesadillas that I wolfed down and was mad I had to share a little piece with my mother. LOL, The owner/cook was very friendly and said he was a yelper and used Yelp a lot. The only down side is there is absolutely no parking in the area. Thank goodness my mom was with me and I doubleparked.  I will definitely stop by Coney Shack again.",4.0
"These are amazing little tacos!!! I didn't expect to see this kind of food near DMV! The guys on the taco truck were very nice, very friendly. I had 3 of the Basa crispy fish tacos and a Blood Orange Pellegrino soda... It doesn't get much better than this!!! I was delightfully surprised!  I plan on going back and trying the rest of the stuff have and talk to the guys soon! :-)",5.0

"Dare I say the ""Rockaway Taco of Coney Island?"" My suggestion is to try it now before the summer rush hits next year. I think this could be a new quirky (what isn't in Coney Island?) and delicious Brooklyn spot for comfort food. A real hidden gem tucked away at the last stop of the F and Q.

"4.5 Stars.After hearing many great things about this place, finally decided to take a trip out there and was not disappointed. This little place definitely knows how to please the tummy. I had the fish tacos and they were about as good as a fish taco can get. Very generous portion and the fish was breaded and fried on the spot so it was not soggy and maintained it's freshness. Add the sauce and toppings and it was a masterpiece. Was also lucky enough to try the Chickadog (don't remember the exact name but it was a hot dog topped with chicken and other toppings). This was a very interesting combination to say the least and honestly wasn't expecting much from a hot dog, but boy was I wrong. Not sure if it was the toppings or the sauce, but when it all came together it tasted very much like a banh mi that went very well with the savoriness of the meats.Overall, this was an extremely pleasant experience.

"Delicious, delicious tacos! After a surprisingly pleasant trip to the DMV we stopped by this little cart on the way back to the city. Ordered the fish tacos per recommendation and beef. It's fusion so the beef tasted like  an amazing rendition of the Korean BBQ ribs and the fish taco was covered with heavenly white sauce. Perfect proportions. Worth the trip out! $7 for three tacos, can mix and match.",5.0

Fresh ingredients, scratch made shack sauce...I had the pleasure of trying the short rib taco, pork taco and chicken taco, everything was made fresh and delicious.Finally we have good food in Coney Island, no need to go to park slope.I met the owner he was so nice.

"decided to try something new while working in the Coney island area. We ordered the chicken tacos, beef taco, and chicken casadilla. Everything was excellent. only issue would be that I would prefer a white meat chicken option.",5.0
"I am normally not a big street food type of guy, but given the location and the wait at theConey Island DMV, and couple with the cleanliness of the cart/stand/store I decided to withhold my concerns and order a quesadilla. The chef meticulously crafted the quesadilla with all fresh ingredients and my seemingly endless requests. After devouring the delicious, mouth-watering quesadilla in about 45 seconds, it made me wonder about the tacos. I was completely stuff, but will make sure I stop by this awesome place the next time I am anywhere close to Coney Island.",5.0
"OK..so a rather annoying date at DMV in Coney Island turned out to have a happy ending. I stumbled upon this amazing Vietnamese Taco shack. The menu was creative and delightful. The sweet young man taking my order said he wanted to give the local community/working class a different kind of food option. Good Man!! I ordered the special 3 tacos for $7. The fish taco and the chicken tacos. First bite of the fish taco sent me into a state of culinary bliss. Crispy daikon, cilantro, onion, crispy oat crusted fish..the sauce was amazing. Best fish taco I have ever had! Chicken rocked too...Seriously folks...do not miss this stand. Can't wait to go back...Oh..and I will...my court date was rescheduled. Win or lose at the DMV...a taco here is WINNING!!!",5.0
Some tasty tacos while I wait on those long lines at the DMV. That fish taco....Its a must try!,5.0
Best Tacos ever!!! Gotta try the everything in the menu. Delicious Food and for an incredible price. Authentic south east asian flavors and highly recommended. First bite of their Tacos and i was in heaven. i had both chicken and fish beautifully prepared and good to the last bite. You can really taste fresh ingredients in every bite. You can tell that the cook really uses care and skill to craft those delectable morsels. Definitely bought extra to take home!!! If you're in the area you definitely need try this spot!!!!!,5.0
"A bit messy, overall their tacos were tasty. I don't know any place in Brooklyn who makes fresh tacos like Coney Shack. If you every stop by Coney Island for Luna Park, New York Aquarium, and/or ORIGINAL Nathan's Hot Dog. Coney Shack is close by and well worth trying.",5.0
