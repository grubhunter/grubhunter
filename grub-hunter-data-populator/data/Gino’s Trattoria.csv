"This spot is such an amazing hidden gem in the neighborhood. The food is delicious and the service is great. A real old Brooklyn vibe, and truly some of the best food in this stretch of the hood.",5.0
$24 for a cheese pizza with olives and onions and with an awful canned sauce and no menu.  This place should be closed before summer.,1.0
"Ordered a buffalo chicken pizza and they delivered over cooked pizza with meat chicks all burnt. Actually it seems like they used leftover chicken chunks and tossed them on the pizza and the bread crust obviously got burnt. When I called the restaurant their employee was extremely rude in trying to understand what was wrong and willing to admit that they can actually mess up an order. Instead his response was ""the guy has been making it like this for years"". Money doesn't grow on the tree and clearly your joint is not the last pizza place on the block. Just to prove my point I am attaching pictures of ""buffalo chicken"" pizza",1.0
I love Gino's. Been coming here for a few years now and I find the food to be delicious. Every time. Very worth checking out if you are new to the neighborhood.,5.0
"Stopped in here after a show at kings theater. Solely came because my boyfriend wanted garlic bread. This place popped up on yelp and seemed to have all of the key Italian standards available on the menu. It was a bit later so place was pretty empty, just us and another table finishing up. The overall atmosphere was cozy with dim lighting and some nice smooth r&b jams playing in the background. We got the appetizer sampler, was nice and hot but could've used a couple more mozz sticks! Generous portion of calamari and zucchini sticks. Oh and the garlic bread was good too! Not on the menu but just asked for it. For entrees went with veal parm and shrimp fra Diablo. Portions were very generous and everything was tasty. Since it was almost closing time the server was cool enough to give us some extra big pours on red wine to help finish off the bottle, much appreciated!",4.0
I live close by here and remember when they first opened but I just haven't been able to actually go in and try there food ! Tonight I decided to order for delivery and the food is really good!!!! The delivery was fast ! Like super fast ! I order the bake ziti with grilled chicken it's hot and so good! With a side of garlic bread (loaf) the garlic bread is really tasty ! I'm def going to go in and have a seat one of these days I love it !,5.0
"This place is hit or miss. I think there are two parts to this restaurant. It seems like some reviewers are talking about the sit-down restaurant, while others are commenting on take-away/delivery. I have never been to the sit-down restaurant, so this review is about the take-away place.They do some things well - I like their grandma slices, cheese, pepperoni (the basics) and surprisingly, their spinach rolls. Nothing is out-of-this-world spectacular, but after a long day of work, when you're particularly unmotivated to make dinner, this place is good. Note: I once ordered a veggie pizza (spinach, mushrooms, green peppers), and there was absolutely NO seasoning/flavor/salt/oil on the veggies. It was as if they dropped raw veggies on top of the pizza and called it a day. We had to throw the entire thing out after a few bites. Don't try anything ""fancy"" here - just stick to the basics.",3.0
I was pleasantly surprised with this place. I decided to come here from searching Yelp. I wanted to try something different. This place is a hidden gem on Flatbush ave. this is the last place I would think of to have good Italian food. It's decently priced and the interior is welcoming.,4.0
"Great meal! I had the chicken parm and a glass of wine. Huge portions. I have ordered delivery from here countless times and finally stopped in. Quaint, cozy and quiet. Great service and they honored the Yelp 50% off a glass of wine offer. Will definitely be stopping in more.",5.0
"This cozy little place is great. In a location you might not expect. Our meal was delicious! And the portions are big, so beware (leftovers... Yum!). Since we make a tasty eggplant rollatini at home, we always have to try it at restaurants. Theirs is very tasty!  The stratciatelli (soup... Yes, I know I don't know how to spell it!) is light and delicious. Hubby always has to test an Italian joint's spaghetti and meatballs. Delicious. And I had the linguine with white clams. Also delicious, but the size of the clams!!  Holy cow!  A meal in themselves. Can't wait to go back... Even from a farther-away neighborhood. Yummy!",5.0
"So so so bad. Ordered a large pizza with peppers and onions. I got a small pie (apparently they only have ""one size"" which is only about 13"") which was completely crushed, with much of the cheese on the box top, not the pizza. Add to this, the pizza was cold, used factory made dough, the price was more than what most neighborhood spots charge for a large 17"" pie, and when I called to complain they told me to get lost. Order from Gino's for a terrible experience. (Check the photos for a pic of my crushed pie) For good pizza in this hood, try Mike's, San Remo, or Bella.",1.0
"The pizza is good if it ever shows up. I ordered a cheese pizza and it took two hours to be delivered. When I called to check on the delivery after 90 minutes, I was told there was no order for my address. Then I was told my pizza was ""on its way."" Then he hung up on me. Apparently, I was impertinent in trying to track down my pizza.",2.0

"Came here last night for dinner with two of my friends and had a pleasant experience.The setting is basically romantic--dimly lit with flowers and a candle at the center of the table, great for a date. In fact, there were quite a few people who looked like they were on a date. There was also a group of about 5 people at another table, so don't feel intimated about bringing a group here--the atmosphere is not too romantic. The waiter was quick to bring our bread and oil, and take our order. I went for the Penne Antonio which is chicken and mushrooms in a pink sauce. It was $12.50. I was happy to see that the portions were large. The pasta sauce was very creamy, as promised, and the chicken and mushrooms were both very well cooked. We were the last customers still sitting at closing time and they did not rush us to leave or anything. Overall, great service and food in this quaint little Italian restaurant.",5.0
"If Gino's was anywhere else in NYC, it would be forgettable. But as Einstein liked to say, it's all relative, so, consistent with their proudly-displayed 'four star grandma slice' signage, Gino's indeed serves up a delicious grandma slice. In the culinary oasis that is Prospect Lefferts Gardens, you'd be doing yourself a disservice to grab a slice from anywhere else. Four stars, with the fourth star being earned solely on the merits of the grandma slice.",4.0

"Gino's is one of a small number of restaurants that deliver to my house.  They are fast and the food is always hot and fresh-tasting.  Although I haven't been a huge fan of some pasta dishes (personal preference -- there's nothing objectively wrong with them) and pizza, the chicken dishes have been tasty.  The portions are so big that we can use the leftovers for another meal, which justifies the price, in my mind.  I particularly like the chicken florentine.",3.0

"Yesterday my boyfriend and I went here for a quick casual dinner. When we pulled up, I second guessed my decision about finding it on yelp, but when we walked inside, the bartender was very friendly and so were the few people there. We ordered Fried Calamari, Buffalo Wings, Chicken Parm and Penne Bolognese. One more delicious than the next. Everything was so perfect and the sauce is phenomenal. I was worried I wouldn't be able to find a place to eat, being I'm new to the area but Gino's definitely put my worries at ease. The house wine I must also say was very good too. I tried the Pinot Grigio and my partner tried the Malbec. We will definitely come back here and I'm excited to order soon as well!",5.0

The chicken was perfect & the sauce was very flavorful. My mom had the margherita pizza & loved it & my son had spaghetti with sausage, again it was a huge portion & delicious.

"After going to Italy on a month-long study abroad trip (and unfortunately returning back home), I've been searching high and low for a restaurant that will satisfy my hunger for true Italian cuisine in the tri-state area.

The gnocchi was phenomenal, as well as the fried zucchini. And don't even get me started on the chocolate mousse cake. I don't have a single bad thing to say about this trattoria. The food was delicious and the prices were fantastic. Even the waiters were extremely kind (and super cute!) I will absolutely be going back here.",5.0

The staff will tell you ten minutes when you order a pie. But it takes way longer than that. Individual slices taste much better than the pies. They are softer, cheesier and less greasy. More than likely, the store slices aren't overcooked. Delivery slices - they're hit or miss. Outside of pizza, Gino's has a nice selection of Italian food for delivery. The food is decently tasty. 10/10, I would order most stuff I've eaten from their menu again. The main drawback with Gino's is that one of the counter staff seems allergic to gloves. He doesn't like to put them on. He, also, doesn't like requests to put them on. If you've been in there, you know who I am talking about. Overall, though, Gino's offers one of the better pizza experiences in this neighborhood.",4.0
"Gino's needs to be looked at relative to its location - there aren't a lot (if any?) other worthwhile sit-down Italian places around PLG. The food here is well priced and decent, unassuming Italian fare that is hard to go wrong with. Things like the veal leave something to be desired, but others like the muscles are spot on. The olive bread and olive oil / vinaigrette dipping is well done and a nice touch while waiting for your meal.I tend to go to Gino's out of a love of the atmosphere, though, not for the food. It always seems to teeter on the edge of being empty by maintaining no more than 3-4 other people in the bar/restaurant who somehow always seem to know one another and generally cull you or anyone else into their conversation in a warm and inviting manner. The bar tenders are always the most gracious and pleasurable to talk and be around and tend to give healthy portions for drinks of all types.So what Gino's lacks in true taste to its food it more than makes up for in a comfortable, friendly, and genuinely enjoyable atmosphere created, in part, by its warm and local patrons who add color to the place. I can't say I'd ever go if it wasn't in my vicinity, but I'm glad it's there.",3.0

I ordered a $20 pizza for delivery through Seamless. When the pizza arrived the bottom of the box was soggy. When I opened the box I saw why. The pizza had slid completely to one side of the box. The wax paper attached to the bottom was glued to the pizza and it was stone cold. When I called the restaurant the manager offered to give me a new pizza and promptly hung up on me before taking my address or phone number. When I immediately called back about this he said he knew where it was going and confirmed the wrong address. Additionally he did not apologize for his poor customer service or the state of the pizza. I wasted $20 on an inedible piece of crap and the management could have cared less that this was the quality they were sending out.,1.0
"Came here after a day at the gardens nearby. Small restaurant but great food and great service. We had the calamari and stuffed mushrooms to start. Both were amazing.

"After going to Italy on a month-long study abroad trip (and unfortunately returning back home), I've been searching high and low for a restaurant that will satisfy my hunger for true Italian cuisine in the tri-state area. After visiting the Brooklyn botanical garden, I stumbled across Gino's. Thankfully I did, because Gino's nailed it. The food is so authentic, I felt like I was back in Florence. The gnocchi was phenomenal, as well as the fried zucchini. And don't even get me started on the chocolate mousse cake. I don't have a single bad thing to say about this trattoria. The food was delicious and the prices were fantastic. Even the waiters were extremely kind (and super cute!) I will absolutely be going back here.",5.0

"Nothing would pleasure me more than to give this place 4+ stars. I really wanted it to be a great dining experience. This is a new restaurant in my neighborhood, a place where there's not much going on in terms of sit down and being served.With that said, I couldn't bring myself to grade past a three stars. On the positive side, everyone was right about the huge portion sizes. The Mrs. got 3 meals out of her shrimp scampi, (which may mean I'm a fat asshole for finishing my lasagna in one sitting). My friend got the ""personal"" pizza, of which two people could've been adequately satiated.The prices were awesome (~$12/meal). The service was great, with the owner coming to check on us several times in the night, and the waitress  was tip top. And that tiramasu, OMG everybody was right about that too. You can't leave without trying that. I was expecting box, but you can tell its homemade, by the faint taste of burntness on the bottom layer. And it's five bucks too Manhattan, they could easily charge $2 for that masterpiece of dessert.The live music (on Sundays and Thursdays) and atmosphere were great. The owners really try to get to know their customers without being in their face too much. An added bonus is given for letting my friend park his bicycle in the back. Also, it is probably the nicest sit down place within a mile radius of my house on Flatbush Ave. I've been here before before just to grab a drink and hang out. Everybody was nice and the staff and patrons were colloquial. Beers are five dollars and mixed drinks hover around ten.The negative side was the food. It didn't taste all that great. The pizza wasn't good. The scampi was tasteless, and they didn't provide very much shrimp. My lasagna was alright, nothing special.The glowing review sound like I should give this place a four or five star rating. But I can't get over the food. It really wasn't tasteful.",3.0
"My boyfriend and I ordered calamari and a large pie for delivery. The pizza was by far the worst pizza I've ever had in New York, and among the worst I've ever had anywhere. The toppings and cheese congealed into one bland watery mass that was separated from the crust (this is not how ""brick oven"" pizza is supposed to behave). The calamari was spongy and tasted like it was microwaved from a frozen bag you'd buy at a discount grocery store. The portions were large but it didn't matter since most of it wound up in the garbage can.",1.0

"Over the past two years, Gino's has become my favorite place to hang out.I love the food: the wild salmon, or the mussels in white wine sauce, or the filet mignon so tender it cuts with a fork. Best cut of meat I've had in this area. They serve a couple of excellent Malbecs; they are a little pricier than beer, but if you can afford them, they are worth it. My diet has changed since I started losing weight about seven months ago. This cut into the amount of time I spent at Gino's, until one of the owners asked me why I hadn't been around. When I told her, she brought me back in, and made several suggestions on the menu. Since then, I've been feasting on the tri-color salad with grilled chicken (splashed with olive oil and balsamic vinegar), the grilled tilapia (not on the menu, but you can ask for it), and sauteed spinach. You can also get the sauteed vegetables grilled, instead.Occasionally, I have to get dessert. The cannoli are awesome. One recommendation: although the cappuchinos are among my favorite, don't drink them past nine PM. They make them strong, and although you'd think I might learn, I've spent a few nights up until 4 AM trying to sleep off the jolt of caffeine.The owners really try to get to know their customers. They've added live music on Thursday and Sunday nights: a good variety of jazz, Spanish, Italian and DJed music of all kinds. I still stop by for a slice, next door, sometimes.To me, one of the best parts of a neighborhood place is when they remember you. That's one of the reasons I started going back to Gino's. The servers and the owners both would recommend food, or particularly fresh items: ""We just got a fresh hunk of salmon in, today."" I've enjoyed the pasta, the seafood and the meat dishes. Most of my experience here is eating in, and usually at the bar.",5.0
This is by far the BEST Italian restaurant in this area. The lasagna and lobster ravioli is AMAZING! Like orgasmic good... I usually order for delivery and they are fast during lunch time (30-45 min). Whew let me collect my thoughts.,5.0
"The food is amazing (5 stars)... when I can get through to them. Their phone etiquette on the other hand, is the absolutely frustrating! They should think of putting their phone in a more secluded location (so they can hear) and have one of the girls take phone orders, instead of the older guy who always answers and starts yelling. I just want to give you my money in exchange for your food, if that's too difficult, perhaps get an order online situation like so many other more efficiently run establishments. At the very, very least, get a phone with a hold button (or learn to use the one you have). Customers should not have to listen to plates clanking around and staff yelling at each other.",2.0

I took it home, remixed it by adding some of that Trader Joe's frozen scallop mix and made a better dish out of it.  It was sooo much pasta (super duper portion size) , I was able to make satisfying lunches out of it the next 2 days. Their other dishes I tasted were the personal pizza (adequate) and the lasagna (good) . The redeeming factor was their tiramisu.Aside from the food, the setting would make the place so perfect.",3.0
"Nothing would pleasure me more than to give this place 4+ stars. I really wanted it to be a great dining experience. This is a new restaurant in my neighborhood, a place where there's not much going on in terms of sit down and being served.With that said, I couldn't bring myself to grade past a three stars. On the positive side, everyone was right about the huge portion sizes. The Mrs. got 3 meals out of her shrimp scampi, (which may mean I'm a fat asshole for finishing my lasagna in one sitting). My friend got the ""personal"" pizza, of which two people could've been adequately satiated.The prices were awesome (~$12/meal). The service was great, with the owner coming to check on us several times in the night, and the waitress  was tip top. And that tiramasu, OMG everybody was right about that too. You can't leave without trying that. I was expecting box, but you can tell its homemade, by the faint taste of burntness on the bottom layer. And it's five bucks too Manhattan, they could easily charge $2 for that masterpiece of dessert.The live music (on Sundays and Thursdays) and atmosphere were great. The owners really try to get to know their customers without being in their face too much. An added bonus is given for letting my friend park his bicycle in the back. Also, it is probably the nicest sit down place within a mile radius of my house on Flatbush Ave. I've been here before before just to grab a drink and hang out. Everybody was nice and the staff and patrons were colloquial. Beers are five dollars and mixed drinks hover around ten.The negative side was the food. It didn't taste all that great. The pizza wasn't good. The scampi was tasteless, and they didn't provide very much shrimp. My lasagna was alright, nothing special.The glowing review sound like I should give this place a four or five star rating. But I can't get over the food. It really wasn't tasteful.",3.0
"My boyfriend and I ordered calamari and a large pie for delivery. The pizza was by far the worst pizza I've ever had in New York, and among the worst I've ever had anywhere. The toppings and cheese congealed into one bland watery mass that was separated from the crust (this is not how ""brick oven"" pizza is supposed to behave). The calamari was spongy and tasted like it was microwaved from a frozen bag you'd buy at a discount grocery store. The portions were large but it didn't matter since most of it wound up in the garbage can.",1.0
"I'm a sucker for spaghetti and meatballs so I ordered it, boy was I disappointed, the sauce was very acidic meatballs had no flavor just blah I threw the whole thing out, otherwise it's a nice little place and the staff was nice",3.0
"Over the past two years, Gino's has become my favorite place to hang out.I love the food: the wild salmon, or the mussels in white wine sauce, or the filet mignon so tender it cuts with a fork. Best cut of meat I've had in this area. They serve a couple of excellent Malbecs; they are a little pricier than beer, but if you can afford them, they are worth it. My diet has changed since I started losing weight about seven months ago. This cut into the amount of time I spent at Gino's, until one of the owners asked me why I hadn't been around. When I told her, she brought me back in, and made several suggestions on the menu. Since then, I've been feasting on the tri-color salad with grilled chicken (splashed with olive oil and balsamic vinegar), the grilled tilapia (not on the menu, but you can ask for it), and sauteed spinach. You can also get the sauteed vegetables grilled, instead.Occasionally, I have to get dessert. The cannoli are awesome. One recommendation: although the cappuchinos are among my favorite, don't drink them past nine PM. They make them strong, and although you'd think I might learn, I've spent a few nights up until 4 AM trying to sleep off the jolt of caffeine.The owners really try to get to know their customers. They've added live music on Thursday and Sunday nights: a good variety of jazz, Spanish, Italian and DJed music of all kinds. I still stop by for a slice, next door, sometimes.To me, one of the best parts of a neighborhood place is when they remember you. That's one of the reasons I started going back to Gino's. The servers and the owners both would recommend food, or particularly fresh items: ""We just got a fresh hunk of salmon in, today."" I've enjoyed the pasta, the seafood and the meat dishes. Most of my experience here is eating in, and usually at the bar.",5.0
This is by far the BEST Italian restaurant in this area. The lasagna and lobster ravioli is AMAZING! Like orgasmic good... I usually order for delivery and they are fast during lunch time (30-45 min). Whew let me collect my thoughts.,5.0
"The food is amazing (5 stars)... when I can get through to them. Their phone etiquette on the other hand, is the absolutely frustrating! They should think of putting their phone in a more secluded location (so they can hear) and have one of the girls take phone orders, instead of the older guy who always answers and starts yelling. I just want to give you my money in exchange for your food, if that's too difficult, perhaps get an order online situation like so many other more efficiently run establishments. At the very, very least, get a phone with a hold button (or learn to use the one you have). Customers should not have to listen to plates clanking around and staff yelling at each other.",2.0

And it was clear when I called to check what was going on (after 90 minutes) that they had forgotten the order. But instead of just copping to it and letting me cancel the order, they claimed it was out for delivery already. And yet somehow it arrived an additional twenty minutes later piping hot-- amazing for an item that had supposedly been out for delivery for almost forty minutes. Who doesn't want dinner delivered at bedtime?",2.0
"This is the only place you should be ordering pizza from if you live in the area. It may be a little more expensive, but it is soo worth it. Their chicken parm makes me so happy.

"OK, So I'm lazy, I've never actually BEEN here. I've only gotten DELIVERY, but each time it's been pretty good, especially given the neighborhood. Each of my deliveries have been timely, with the delivery person being nice and professional, so that's something that always inspires me to write a better review. The food here though, is the big thing - It's all been really good, like, surprisingly good for a place that delivers in Flatbush. The noodles are pretty clearly out of a box, but all of the sauces are good - the Alfredo isn't too heavy, the spaghetti sauce was fantastic (as were the oversized meatballs) and the clam pasta featured perfectly cooked clams (I'm usually not one to get seafood delivered, but my roommate ordered it and demanded everyone in the apartment try it). I haven't ordered the pizza, so I can't speak to that, but the sausage roll was fantastic. My only real gripe has been the garlic bread (the garlic wasn't cooked enough and the butter wasn't salted, so there was a real strong raw garlic taste - which some people may like, but I'm not one of 'em) Each order comes with some rather fantastic olive foccacia, though - so I wasn't at a loss for tasty, tasty bread.",4.0
"One of my favorite gems on Flatbush. Yes, I said Flatbush Ave. It was so easy to pass this place as another ""run down spot "" but it isn't. When you walk in you forget that honestly you're in the hood. The brick walls, intimate seating, cute bar & so close to home. My go-to dish is the Margarita personal pie which is always on point 5/5 with some red wine. I have tried the lasagna & penne which are both good. I probably come here once a month and get my regular. I think I like the place so much mostly because of Gino's warmth. Many times he will come up to you personally and ask if your ok how the food is. True 5 star treatment.",5.0

Back in the days, it was just Caribbean food. Nothing wrong with that but variety is always refreshing to have in this neighborhood and this is a beautiful addition. The food is great.

It's an average Italian joint and for that reason the prices are not reasonable but if you go next door to their to-go section the prices are cheaper for the same quality of food.

"We went yesterday for a relatively late dinner yesterday (around 8:30 pm). Place was nearly empty, which made it easier to have a conversation with my friend.Staff was EXTREMELY nice and welcoming. We had VERY yummy stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer. I had Lobster Ravioli for my entree. It was good, but I was disappointed in the vodka sauce it was served in. It was quite sweet and I couldn't really taste the vodka (it's not supposed to get you drunk, obviously, but with a good vodka sauce you definitely taste it). It's the kick that makes it a great vodka sauce. Also, the ravioli tasted more like cheese than lobster (again, you should TASTE the lobster). The food was good, but I felt slightly gypped, but my friend was treating so that's probably why I wasn't as annoyed.

I corrected him a few times, thought he had it--and lo and behold, he returned to our table with my friend's beer and my--wait for it--Pinot Grigio.

Luckily we had someone watch our baby. THANK YOU!!!Our visit date was 10/30/2010Anyhow, Gino's....wow where do I start? The neighborhood is a little sketchy but who cares! The food at Gino's is delicious. When we got to Gino's there were live musicians. My husband and I were seated right away. Our waitress was really sweet, she took her time to converse with us after dinner. Anyhow, we ordered a combo appetizer plate...omg..the marinara was delicious. My husband is not a big fan of calamari but he decided to try it finally and actually really liked it. (VERY RARE) he'd try something that he always thought was rubbery. My husband ordered spaghetti & meatball and i ordered the stuffed rolled chicken breast that came with pasta....WOW party in my mouth yumm!! we had so much food left over that we took some back to our hotel. Sigh...we're back in California now and til this day, I still think of the dinner I had with my husband at Gino's .. I MISS YOU GUYS!!!! Don't worry though. We'll be back real soon as we decided to relocate to NY within the coming year and you better believe, my husband and I will definately come back to GINO'S...we'll bring our little one too! :-)",5.0
"While people probably come to Gino's for pizza, I highly recommend staying for a nice Italian dinner. The food is fantastic, always fresh, very delicious... great portions and bread, etc. Plus, the staff is very friendly, and it is a nice, cozy space.I have been twice, and will certainly come back again.",5.0
"I have been ordering pizza from Gino's for 13 years  since I moved into the neighborhood. Although I enjoy the chicken parmigiana & meatball parmigiana Heroes as well as Ravioli. .The regular cheese Pizza is has seriously declined over the years. I'm very disappointed in the pizza @ this place.  The large pie I ordered came Luke warm, the slices were very small & the delivery guy had to come back with my change from a $20 bill. Consistency seems to be a issue with Gino's pizza.",2.0
"My boyfriend and I went to Gino's for dinner on a whim and I'm glad we did. We came in around 9:30,10 PM on a Friday and were seated immediately. The server was polite and helpful in helping my order. I got the chicken francese and my boyfriend got fettuccine alfredo with chicken. My dish was pretty good, flavorful. The alfredo was creamy and thick but it could have used a little more salt. We had some wine, ended the meal with cheesecake, which I believe was frozen/store bought. Besides the mediocre dessert, the meal and experience was great. It was intimate and that's what we were looking for. I'll come back again to try other dishes.

"I have been eating Ginos Pizza since the 80's.  You could say i was raised on it!  I was happy to see Gino opened the Trattoria a few years ago.  Since it opened i have eaten their dozens upon dozens of times with my family, by myself and i've also brought dates there.  Everyone has been very happy with the food and the atmosphere.  Some nights they have live music which can be very enjoyable.  The owner Gino and his wife Mary are like family whenever  i go . They are very friendly and personable.  As far as the food the fried calamari is top notch. I always get that.  I also like the Steak.  The Tortolini and Ravioli is excellent as well.  I often get the Chicken Sorrentino, Florentine or Parm.  Lately i've been eating the salads instead of the pasta trying to lose weight and i have to highly recomend the house salad.  Writing this review has me hungry i think i'll go with my family later tonight! lol  Support good places and good people and that's def Gino's Trattoria.",5.0
"I'm a big fan of this place!  They are my go-to for delivery and have been since before the sit-down place opened, and I love going in here, too!  The pastas are just as good as they have always been, the portions are huge, prices are reasonable, and service is good. I'll continue to frequent Gino's and order delivery from there or their slice spot next door.",4.0
"I have lived in Flatbush almost all my life and I am used to seeing the greasy, stomach lurching food that comes out of those ""restaurants"". This restaurant is nothing like that, the food is fresh and tastes really good. I happened on the restaurant one hungry night and my stomach has been thankful since. Tonight is the second night I am ordering from them and they were gracious enough to make a dish that is not on their menu, but is a picture on their website and I LOVE them for that. I, like others on this site, am a lazy delivery junkie and they haven't disappointed me. Keep up the good food and service.",4.0
"In a word...YUMMY!  I ate there last night and the food was absolutely delicious.  From the bread with the amazing olive oil dip, to the wine, to my pasta, to the perfect chocolate mousse cake I loved it.  And even though the place got busy I never felt rushed to hurry along.  I can't wait to eat here again!  (plus my waiter Danny had the nicest smile :)",5.0
"Gino's has a great, comfortable atmosphere.  We go there often when we want a late night meal or a glass of wine.  The staff is really pleasant and personable, and Gino is a real gentleman.Though they are an italian joint, they always have steamed veggies and salads that I can eat (I'm a celiac).  Their food is really tasty and they have good proportions.Their filet mignon is amazing.  It melts in your mouth, and is so tender that you barely need a knife with which to cut it!  It might be the best I've had in Brooklyn!They have live jazz there one some nights, which is wonderful to eat to.This place is a great place that we love to frequent.  We always feel welcome.",4.0
"So we were stuck indoors for...The Storm that Rocked NY. Since we hungry and didn't feel like cooking, we yelped to see what was open in the hood. Low and behold this little italian joint pops up. 4 stars...really...in this hood?!?! I must say it was a great choice good food even greater portions (lunch for next day).

"I grew up living in an attic apartment owned by an old world Italian family.  Maria made her own pastas every day.  They melted in your mouth.  I remember them having the lightest fillings and the most incredibly perfect cheese.  The quality of the food was bar none.  Mr. Fabroni made his own wine from grapes he cultivated and cared for in the backyard.  His jugs of wine were infamous and believe me you were psyched if he gave you a bottle.  When I went to my first pizza/restaurant as a kid and ordered the stuff shells, I awaited anxiously for the delicately balanced food I had grown to love.  A food critic at the ripe age of 7, I indignantly spit out the first bite of what I referred to as ""the rubber balls.""   My mother then explained that ""this was not Maria's house"" as if the notion that it could somehow be the same was an impossibility.  I understood then that what I had taken for granted was actually something very special.  I've been looking for Maria's food ever since.When I walked into Gino's Trattoria, I was greeted warmly by the entire family.  Strangely, I felt I knew Marie almost instantly.  She and her son, Tony explained that they wanted to open a family business where you were assured the highest quality of food.  I immediately felt at home.  I noticed that their renovation was tasteful...  the huge brick wall that spans the length of the restaurant lending an air of warmth and charm, the unobstructed glass window leading to the street,  and the bar, currently a station for the staff is scheduled to be renovated and stocked now that they were granted  their liquor license, promising to also serve top notch wines and cognacs.    If the bread is an indicator of things to come (and I believe this), we were given a warm perfectly crisp basket of garlic bread toasted to perfection in the brick oven next door.  I dared to hope that the food was good, but my mother's words still ring in my ears after all these years... 'You can't expect to have Maria's food'.  That's true.  But, I have now found Marie's food and I couldn't be happier. Gino's is one of the first high quality restaurants to open in Prospect Lefferts Manor.  To my heart's delight, their mission is to provide fresh food every day using only the best of ingredients, which is the key component to great food.Since they opened two months ago, I have gone 1-2 x week.  For a restaurant right out the gate, they have a steady flow of customers, many like me who are returning time and again.  There menu is standard Italian fare, with the exception of the food itself.  But what really impressed me was their long list of specials, described comfortably by a friendly, attentive, staff.  When I asked about the fish, a grilled wild salmon, which frankly was out of this world,  she explained that the family goes to the market every day for fish and I could trust that it's fresh.  The salmon was perfectly seasoned and grilled.  Simple.  The quality of the fish evident.  And this is what made it an outstanding dish.   I frankly was blown away.  For my appetizer, I ordered the eggplant rollatini.  One of the best markers of good Italian food is the sauce and cheese.  It was really good.  The cheese was  light, airy, creamy, and perfectly salted with sauce you could eat like soup.  And you get to sop up every bit with the amazing garlic bread which keeps coming.My partner had the mussels in white sauce.  Soooooo fresh.... Sooooo good.  She said that the only other mussels she's had as fresh were on Whidbey Island in The San Juan Islands but only because they were farmed hours before they were cooked,  impressive!  And the white sauce can only be describe as incredible!  Get ready for another sopping experience.   For deserts, they have an amazing homemade chocolate mousse made from great dark chocolate and a tira misu that leaves you longing for more marscapone cheese.  And from what I read in the other reviews the cheesecake is also crazy good.  This was topped off with really superb espresso, well  two double espressos in my case.      I went back this week and had the veal on Marie's recommendation.   It was outrageous!  Believe me, you can trust Marie when she says something is good.  The waitress said the fillet mignon and rib eye steaks have been getting rave reviews by the customers.  The best cuts only.  Yes, it was tempting but i plan on working myself around the entire menu anyway.  I will say that a side of potatoes would have been the ideal compliment for the steak.  It was offered with spinach cooked in garlic and oil instead.   More Italian, yes... But I'm still a purest when it comes to classic steak and potatoes.  A suggestion to an otherwise great unexpected dining experience in my neighborhood.  Who knew?  Go and check it out for yourself.    Here's to Maria and M",5.0
