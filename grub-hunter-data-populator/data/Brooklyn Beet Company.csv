"I would rate Brooklyn Beet Company four and a half stars.The food is fantastic. We started off by sharing the mushroom-herb filled dumplings (perogies). They were topped off with asiago and scallions. The dish was was very savory. I highly recommend it.For my main course, I had the Chef korzo burger. Essentially, it looked like a mini beef Wellington. The korzo was filled with Hungarian peppers, bacon, and monterey jack. It had a great balance of savoriness, spiciness, and saltiness. I requested the burger be prepared rare, and it came out perfect! The meat was so juicy!The Brooklyn Beet offers an intriguing selection of craft cocktails. They also had a few solid craft beers on tap. The front of the house is seriously understaffed. They had two employees who were responsible for hosting, waiting, running, busing, and bartending. It was too much of a burden for just two employees.",5.0
"I heard great things about this place so I was anxious to try it. It was OK, nothing to write home about and I don't think I'll be going back there.The place is small and if you're claustrophobic you definitely want to avoid it. Our waiter was good but the food took a long time to arrive, in fact, the people next to us ordered after we did and got their food long before ours came out. I had the rabbit stew, which was basically just rabbit in a brown sauce with mushrooms. Nothing ""stew"" like about it. The white clam chowder was very good though and I'd recommend it.Prices aren't bad but all in all nothing special.",3.0
"Lousy. Overpriced, overcooked, and terrible service. The burger was  well done, when we said rare. The server barely spoke English. The space was cramped.Don't.",1.0
"After seeing a couple of reviews and hearing about this restaurant I def wanted to try it. My first impression, it was tiny!  I'm really not happy that if I'm out I have to share a table with strangers but lucky we scored a two top on the side by ourselves. I know this restaurant boasts that it is farm to table and you can tell with the quality. It's fresh and super flavorful and hearty.  We started with a crop salad it had tart apples, poached egg, porcini dumplings, feta cheese roasted chick peas and a light dressing. What a great start. This restaurant is know for their fried burger in dough unfortunately we messed up in ordering the burger but it still was really tasty. We ordered it unfried. We also ordered the short rib special which was delicious it fell apart.  It was really flavorful. The grits were creamy and the Brussels were garlicky and delicious. For dessert we had langos Bon Bon which was fried dough covered in a berry compote, with berries caramel sauce and fresh whip cream it was so delicious. A great ending! Overall The food here is really good and I would def come back. You can tell they put a lot of love into the cooking here.",4.0
"I finally got to try this place courtesy of rainy weather! My friend and I were in the area and needed to find a place for dinner before we got drenched and luckily there was an open table when we got here. We ordered the original Korzo burger and a seafood risotto (?) If you just look at the food, it looks like it would be a good amount and not to filling, but about halfway through our food, it was starting to hit us. Both dishes were delicious and I absolutely loved the beet ketchup, I think I could put that on everything.The staff here is very friendly, especially since it was our first time trying this place! Our waiter took the time to tell us what they're known for and what goes into their dishes. I don't recommend coming here with a large group because it is a small and cozy space, but it doesn't take away from its charm. Probably good to come with 2-3 friends and just unwind whether for brunch, lunch or dinner. I would love to come back and try other menu items and I will definitely be back.",4.0
"Came here with some friends for lunch.  Restaurant is a little small and seating a little tight, but nice looking restaurant.  Menu is a little small and didn't really see any options for appetizer on the brunch menu.  Had the slav korzo burger.  It took a little longer than expected to come out, but it was well worth the wait.  Their burger is a little more unique than other places.  The patty is wrapped in a bread/pastry.  Almost like a beef wellington.  It was juicy and flavorful.Would like to come back to see how good their other items are on the menu.  Good service and fresh ingredients.  Not a recommended location for large groups.",4.0
"I noticed lately I only write a review right away when either the place is really horrible, or really darn good. And this place is really darn good. I came for brunch and I was intrigued by the menu! It was a tough decision making up my mind because I wanted to try everything even though I came with my head set on their famous korzo burger. Anyways, I stuck with my original choice and got the korzo burger while my boyfriend had the halusky & german sausage hash platter.ORIGINAL KORZO BURGER - deep fried bun is the classical standard bun... but you can have it grilled instead if you wanna be the healthy party pooper. Fried is the good shit though... the way to go as what my waiter told me so I listened and no regrets! The bun added a sweet yet soft crispy pastry bun taste to the juicy savory burger patty. I'm a huge fan on burgers... and this is quite possibly on top of my list for one of the best burgers I've had! HALUSKY & GERMAN SAUSAGE HASH - my goodness this is one hell of a perfect breakfast platter. Halusky is pretty much just potatoes, but cutted out more into a short noodle form. The halusky was cooked to the right crispyness touch to the platter while the caramelized onions and peppers were soft and also a juicy flavorful addition. Runny eggs with sausage too on this plate?! Can't get any better than that.&Thank you to our waiter who hooked us up on the salad! He saw me and my boyfriend debating back and fourth if we should have fries with my burger or salad! HahahI'll definately be back to try the rest of the items on the brunch menu... And I can't wait to try this place out for dinner with the other Korzo burgers they offer!!",5.0
"The place is really, really tiny. I think at most they can seat 12-16 people at a time. But the food was delicious nonetheless! My boyfriend ordered the shrimp/crab cakes which were SO delicious! We both had their special burger for dinner and that was really good as well. The beef was good quality, cooked really well, juicy. It was oily and a little messy, but hey, it happens. I was recommended to order the bacon wrapped dates. Tried it. I didn't love it but that's probably just because my preference for mixing sweet and salty is limited. Feta cheese also is not my favorite thing so that probably played a role in my opinion of the appetizer. But crab cakes - do it. Burgers - do it.",5.0
What a great homey place. Very small so come prepared with an umbrella stroller. Service isn't super fasts... There is usually one guy running the tables and playing the bartender role so don't be in a rush when you come. Came for brunch twice and was VERY impressed with the food. Fried burger. Beef with eggs. Beer is good and fresh too.,4.0
"Wow. Amazing find in the middle of bay ridge. The food was outstanding.  We ordered the goulash, skirt steak, and ""paella"".  For dessert we ordered the puff pastry dessert with cream. As well as the wine filled chocolates. (The names escape me)They specialize in locally sourced food. The sources of their meat and vegetables are listed on the chalkboard right next to a awkwardly funny looking painting. Very in touch with what everyone is looking for three days. Everything was excellent. Nothing more to say. I'll be back!",5.0
"Warning- this is going to be a glowing review. I think I'm in love. Ambiance: a railroad-style restaurant with an industrial/organic feel; think brick and wood. You walk in though the open wall and first encounter a narrow bar. All seats are past this; there are several stand-alone tables (very tiny) and a long row of communal booths. The set-up is perfect for either an intimate dinner or an opportunity to chat with your neighbors.  I'm a sucker for a good ceiling, yes I know I have a problem, and don't forget to look up at the original tin ceiling- gorgeous. Service: our server was great. He gladly offered tastes of wine and beer, and he was able to accommodate my husbands' numerous allergies (though I think he might have had something since he had a very slight reaction). Nevertheless, the service is stellar. Food/drinks: I am not a drinker, but I do like an occasional glass of wine. I had one of the best reds, from Hungary, that I have tasted. There are a bunch of creative cocktails as well. The food has a Hungarian bent- pickled veggies, meats, Spätzle, and of course beets. Try the pickle plate for a nice light app, which comes with a thick feta spread and home made flat bread. I overdid it and has the Wunderwurst plate too. Delicious, but too much before my entree- the quinoa trout salad, which was not exactly what I expected. I thought the trout would be chopped up in the salad. Instead, there was a large, perfectly cooked fillet atop the salad. The skin was perfectly crisp while the meat was moist and tender. I ended up taking leftovers home and not having room for dessert. I will definitely return.",5.0

Loved the ambiance didn't mind the communal tables either since we came late it wasn't too packed Got a bottle of red Got the original famous burger asked for it plain with cheese it was everything I'd hoped for and then some.Hubby described it as a burger inside a jelly doughnut because of the sweet dough. Amazing.Hubby got the waitresses recommended dish the goulash or something it was not good too chewy and rather bland far from memorableAsked for another burger for us to share same way plain with cheese  just bacon on the side since he eats pork and I don't. Next one comes out I bite in and almost gag they put celery in it as the crunch pickles typically provide. I'm allergic to celery and no where did it state that they use it. I asked the waitress if maybe she gave us someone else's order or if they were just rushing because the kitchen was closing when we ordered and it still took 20 min to get the burger. Well her reply was sometime they use it and sometimes they dont and I could pick it out since it was on top. No apologies nothing. I get that a film crew came in and your alone and busy but honestly lady not cool. Instead I eagerly awaited my dessert  of beet cake.Beet cake tasted like carrot cake slice was huge forgot to take a pic. Actually too sweet for my taste. Thought she'd comp it since we had the celery incident but no such luck.,4.0
"Who can resist a laid back restaurant that is equipped with chill staff and good food? As a beet lover, I was pulled in by the name of the establishment.

I initially thought farm to table was more of a gimmick than anything, but I was wrong.Only complaint is the place is small.

"I have given this restaurant a few tries, mainly because I love beets and also my friends love coming here.  I wouldn't recommend brunch here, it simply isn't that good.  I've tried the korzo burger but I'm not a fan of the fried bun.Since it's farm to table, they have specials that change like every week.  I came here with my friends who was there earlier in the week for the oxtail but they didn't have it on the menu anymore.  We had the chicken schnitzel, short ribs, and duck confit.  Extra big portions at a criminal price.  The chicken schnitzel was crispy and perfectly cooked with garlic mashed potatoes and salad.  I love love love their salad, it comes with BEETS and a palate cleansing dressing, light with the perfect amount of herbs (dill maybe?).  The short ribs were a special and could have been cooked a little longer but it was still tasty.  The duck was my least favorite, again could have been cooked longer so it could be more moist but still had good flavor.

Incredibly authentic Central European food, I never thought I'd find something like this in the US. The food is fantastic, seriously can't go wrong with anything from here! I love the concept, farm to table served in a Central European style. As I went through the menu, the names of the dishes reminded me of my trip to Czech Republic, Germany, Austria and Hungary. Portions are big, you can definitely share dishes. I had their original korzo burger and goulash, each were exquisite! The korzo burger reminded of kolaches, the meat was filled inside the bun.

The chefs behind this place are geniuses. I don't know how they do it but they got me to eat beet ketchup and cole slaw. Beets are my least favorite foods, I had cold pressed beet juice once and hated it. My mom used to make beet soup for me as a kid and of course it was the hardest thing for me to drink, but for some reason their beet ketchup was great! I squirted a generous amount to my burger while eating it. Their ketchup is quite unique, you can compare it to machine made mass produced ketchup like Heinz or sir kensington's. It was a bit spicy but in a good way, I'd use sparingly if you can't handle spice. Both their ketchups you can tell its preservative free, natural, fresh and homemade. Guys this is what REAL ketchup tastes like! Shoutout to the cole slaw, it's the first time I enjoyed eating it! As a kid I always threw it out after that gross mayo celery carrot mix.

We got The Pickle appetizer, which is pickled vegetables, some pita, and a feta smokey paprika spread. Delicious.I then got the beet burger which is just amazing.

"We've been to the Brooklyn Beet Company quite a few times in the past year.  Love the farm communal style tables giving the place a bohemian atmosphere.   The servers have always been friendly, attentive & professional except one time when the server spent too much time being attentive to his cell phone.  We were put off, but did go back again and was informed that the ""phone guy"" was fired.  The Korzo burger with the meat filled on the inside instead of piled on top is unique and the burger is delicious.  The cole slaw is fabulous and I love the beet ketchup.  The summer squash soup was so savory and smooth, and of course, farm fresh. The goulash was ok. The Kreme (I hope I spelled that correctly) is creamy and very tasty.   The only downside was in the winter - brrrr.  I can't eat comfortably when I'm cold, but they seem to have solved that problem with space heaters.",4.0

"Thi place is super cute with the communal tables! Food was fresh but in some other ways it was disappointment. Beets! beets! beets! Staff was super nice. I was catching up w my bestie and we weren't bothered to hurry up to leave after our meal was done.  Other tables got the famous burger which looked amazing. We got the turnip squash dumplings which were good.... BUT was a bit soggy and greasy. You can see the oil on the dish which deterred me a bit but not enough to not eat it. Flavor profile was nice other wise. My cousin got the brisket. Now, being that it was a seasonal thing, we opted for that over the skirt steak. BUT for a brisket, it seemed a bit over cooked and flavorless. It was saved by the chimichurri sauce though otherwise it would have been a disaster. The greens next to it was amazing. I'm sorry The brisket wasn't the star. I got the beet salad. Can't go wrong with a bunch of veggies thrown together. Wish the walnuts were more ""candied"" and that there were more cheese.

"After visiting Korzo last year, I wanted to make my way to all of their associated restuarants. Sadly, Korzo Haus in the EV closed, but thankfully Brooklyn Beet Company is alive and kickin'!The space is similar to Korzo - narrow with cozy seating, but they don't have the luxury of a back room like Korzo.Some of the things I came to associate with Korzo were also at BBC - the fried burgers, the beet ketchup, and the wonderful service.For a starter, we had the wunder wurst sausage platter. Definitely a great dish to share.After already trying the classic fried burger at Korzo, I went with the special of the day - it had avocado, bacon, and bleu cheese! And yes, it was as delicious as it sounds. Cooked perfectly medium rare with a crispy, flaky outer shell. Throw a little bit of beet ketchup on that sucker, and you've got a burger going!If you've never been to any of the Korzo restaurants, you need to get off your couch and go to one right now!",5.0
This place is so worth going to! Went there for brunch and was very impressed. The food was fab. We ordered the famous Korzo burgers (3 different versions) and they were all delish!

"I waited way too long to try this place! I actually wound up coming here because the Polish restaurant across the street was closed the good thing about Brooklyn be company is that it is open every day. I was here on a Monday night about 7 PM and it was pretty quiet at the time, as the night went on more people came in but still relatively quiet which was a nice departure from how it usually looks, which is super packed and crowded since it is a long narrow space that cannot accommodate that many people.the food was really good, the highlight is the korzo burger, get it deep fried and  you will not regret it! The salad with beets is also really tasty. We ordered the turn of dumplings with pork but they came with mushrooms but they were still pretty good more like a parolee with some shredded asiago on top. I don't know if they sold wine by the glass but we ordered a bottle of red from Hungary and that was really tasty for around $42. Service was nice and friendly there was only one server/bartender. I can't wait to try some of their other items. The only issue was that it was really cold in there (it's just cold in general right now!) but they did try with a curtain and several space heaters.My return was a home run..

It was better than the original beef burger (which my girlfriend got) imo. It comes with fries and some slaw, which complement the burger well. Seriously, it's so good, try it.Ten outta ten.",5.0
"We've been to the Brooklyn Beet Company quite a few times in the past year.  Love the farm communal style tables giving the place a bohemian atmosphere.   The servers have always been friendly, attentive & professional except one time when the server spent too much time being attentive to his cell phone.  We were put off, but did go back again and was informed that the ""phone guy"" was fired.  The Korzo burger with the meat filled on the inside instead of piled on top is unique and the burger is delicious.  The cole slaw is fabulous and I love the beet ketchup.  The summer squash soup was so savory and smooth, and of course, farm fresh. The goulash was ok. The Kreme (I hope I spelled that correctly) is creamy and very tasty.   The only downside was in the winter - brrrr.  I can't eat comfortably when I'm cold, but they seem to have solved that problem with space heaters.",4.0
"My absolute favorite spot for a burger. I haven't even tried the other dishes, except for the desserts, because I'm so in love with the burgers that I just can't fathom ordering anything else. Their homemade beet ketchup is amazing and I plan on buying a jar of it next time I'm there. I've taken half my family there so far and they've loved it too.",5.0
"Cute neighborhood spot with refreshingly original cuisine and a nice open space in the back!I ordered the giant flour pancake. Fantastic pancake; massive bang for your buck, with salted ham, crispy (!!!!really crispy!!!!) bacon, fresh berries, and poached eggs. It was filling and totally delicious; I was thrilled. My boyfriend got the Maine cod, which he said was nice and tasty if a bit on the smaller side.Tons of draft beer and wine options here if you're looking for some alcohol, and lots of different food options for everyone!",4.0
"Thi place is super cute with the communal tables! Food was fresh but in some other ways it was disappointment. Beets! beets! beets! Staff was super nice. I was catching up w my bestie and we weren't bothered to hurry up to leave after our meal was done.  Other tables got the famous burger which looked amazing. We got the turnip squash dumplings which were good.... BUT was a bit soggy and greasy. You can see the oil on the dish which deterred me a bit but not enough to not eat it. Flavor profile was nice other wise. My cousin got the brisket. Now, being that it was a seasonal thing, we opted for that over the skirt steak. BUT for a brisket, it seemed a bit over cooked and flavorless. It was saved by the chimichurri sauce though otherwise it would have been a disaster. The greens next to it was amazing. I'm sorry The brisket wasn't the star. I got the beet salad. Can't go wrong with a bunch of veggies thrown together. Wish the walnuts were more ""candied"" and that there were more cheese. Anyway, maybe we just got the wrong things. I'd give it another chance but maybe not for a long time.",3.0
"After visiting Korzo last year, I wanted to make my way to all of their associated restuarants. Sadly, Korzo Haus in the EV closed, but thankfully Brooklyn Beet Company is alive and kickin'!The space is similar to Korzo - narrow with cozy seating, but they don't have the luxury of a back room like Korzo.Some of the things I came to associate with Korzo were also at BBC - the fried burgers, the beet ketchup, and the wonderful service.For a starter, we had the wunder wurst sausage platter. Definitely a great dish to share.After already trying the classic fried burger at Korzo, I went with the special of the day - it had avocado, bacon, and bleu cheese! And yes, it was as delicious as it sounds. Cooked perfectly medium rare with a crispy, flaky outer shell. Throw a little bit of beet ketchup on that sucker, and you've got a burger going!If you've never been to any of the Korzo restaurants, you need to get off your couch and go to one right now!",5.0
This place is so worth going to! Went there for brunch and was very impressed. The food was fab. We ordered the famous Korzo burgers (3 different versions) and they were all delish! The  Beet'Tini was absolutely awesome. Pavel our waiter was as fabulous as the food. He was attentive and friendly. Will definitely go there again and once we move to Bay Ridge we'll be going there more often. If you live in or near the area check it out. You won't be disappointed.,5.0
"Came here for lunch and was pretty disappointed. Had the hash with eggs, and it was not flavorful at all. Tried all the other dishes and the duck was the best, but still not amazing. The beet ketchup fell flat for me, but I personally don't like the taste of beet as well. All the other reviews have been for dinner, however, so maybe we came for an off meal.",3.0
"I waited way too long to try this place! I actually wound up coming here because the Polish restaurant across the street was closed the good thing about Brooklyn be company is that it is open every day. I was here on a Monday night about 7 PM and it was pretty quiet at the time, as the night went on more people came in but still relatively quiet which was a nice departure from how it usually looks, which is super packed and crowded since it is a long narrow space that cannot accommodate that many people.the food was really good, the highlight is the korzo burger, get it deep fried and  you will not regret it! The salad with beets is also really tasty. We ordered the turn of dumplings with pork but they came with mushrooms but they were still pretty good more like a parolee with some shredded asiago on top. I don't know if they sold wine by the glass but we ordered a bottle of red from Hungary and that was really tasty for around $42. Service was nice and friendly there was only one server/bartender. I can't wait to try some of their other items. The only issue was that it was really cold in there (it's just cold in general right now!) but they did try with a curtain and several space heaters.My return was a home run.. Can't wait to do brunch ..!",5.0
"Came here to celebrate a friends birthday and could not have made a better choice. 3/4 of us had the delicious Maine Atlantic cod and chips which came with a mint green salad with a balsamic like dressing and it was devoured by all. Some other items devoured were the roasted beet salad, the bacon wrapped dates, and the pork dumplings. For drinks the beet-Toni, radler, Bloody Mary and the slow whiskey drink were all well made. We spent at least 3 hours hanging out and enjoying our food and drinks here. Friendly staff and great service. Will definitely refer this place to others and I hope to be back again!",5.0

"Love farm to table restaurants, and this one is a keeper!I came here yesterday for brunch with a friend. It was our first time eating here, but the food & service overwhelmingly passed our expectation. We ordered to share: 1) Farm styled oven baked eggs w/ salad, 2) Korzo Burger w/ Salad (has an option for french fries instead of salad), 3) Coffee, 4) Dessert - Langos Bon Bon. The farm styled oven baked eggs & the korzo burger were both very delicious. Both tasted so fresh, and the food was so savory as well. The item that wowed me the most was the Korzo burger. It was one of the juciest, most tastiest & unique burgers I have eaten in my life. I think I am in love with this dish. No wonder this was listed on the top 10 best burgers in NYC. The salads were tasty as well, and the cole slaw that came with the korzo burger was delicious. Tried their beet ketchup & beet hot sauce, which was very interesting. I don't really like beet that much, but I found the sauces to taste very good. The dessert (langos bon bon) is a must try as well! It was not too heavy, and tasted like something you ate in a carnival. Service was outstanding, as the waiter was very sweet in checking up on his patrons, and refilling my coffee (even when I didn't ask for it). Place is a bit small, but rustic looking. Decor is nice and it is very comfortable here as they don't rush you out.Highly recommended! We loved it so much, that we are now setting up a day where we can come here for dinner.",5.0

The Korzo burgers are MUST try - not a traditional thing, but a Hungarian twist. Wrapped in lángos dough, deep fried - they are incredibly tasty, juicy and very well seasoned. Served with side salad, and their famous Beet ketchup.I also ordered side of roasted beets - those always make my day.Drinks are stroooong!

My dish was reasonably prices at $14 My friend got the rabbit stew (not on the brunch menu but clearly something they make the night before) think slow cooked pulled meat in a yummy gravy. I tried and liked it, however it does have mushrooms which I don't care for so probably not something I would ever order myself. I saw another reviewer bashing on this while I do not agree with it...

"I'm really in between a 3 and a 4 star review for this establishment. To be fair, I really did enjoy the food but the restaurant was SO HOT the entire time I was eating that it just made the entire meal less enjoyable. It was an oppressively hot NYC night and with just one air conditioning unit in the wall, it just wasn't enough to cool down the dining room. Now lets talk about the food. We ordered a few of the appetizers to share. The mushroom dumplings and the sausage dishes were our favorites. We liked them so much we ordered a another plate of each. I had the original burger and it was good. Very unique because it was wrapped in a puff pastry dough like a beef wellington. I would like to come here again but perhaps in the winter time. I don't think I stopped sweating the entire 2 hours I was there.",4.0

We got the communal table for a party of 10 right around our reservation time. There was only two service staff so it's kinda slow but they were very attentive and friendly. Everything that we ordered were delicious. The burgers were amazing and quiet original. They are baked in a pita bread, I'm amazed how they can get on point. The medium rare was an actual medium rare and medium well was actually a medium well. So many places can't even get the patty right by itself. Let alone inside a pita. My cod and chip were fresh and flavorful but a bit greasy for my liking. I think it was the duck fat soaked zucchinis that drenched the fish fillets. My favorite was the soup and schnitzel. Both was ""last meal"" worthy.",4.0

It came with a small cole slaw and these stringy fries that were delicious. Had the fries with the beet ketchup and the hot sauce. The burger was okay for my girlfriend, she added some ketchup and hot sauce to supplement the flavor.The brisket goulash came out nice and hot with sides of pita bread around the bowl. Used the pita bread to dip into the goulash and try the beet ketchup. The goulash was definitely delicious and had a small kick to it that really worked well.

"Came here a few weeks ago for dinner with my friends and had an awesome meal. If you're looking a new place for dinner and in the mood for something different in Bay Ridge ... This is your place! The food has a sort-of southern feel to it, but in the best way!Their menu somehow strikes the seemingly-impossible yet ideal balance between being both comfort-food-esque and local/healthy/seasonal. For apps, we started with the Turnip-Fall Squash Dumplings and the Beet. As for the dumplings, we opted for the mushroom-herb option, and it was amazing!! One of the highlights of the meal for sure. The subtle flavors of the various wild mushroom varieties was a perfect pair for the Asiago cheese. The Beet was another tasty app, with the candied walnuts and goat cheese complimenting the beets, which did not take over the dish.For our meal, we ordered 3 entrees that we all shared. I'm telling you.... Every single dish was great.  My favorite was the pulled pork, served with a generous portion of avocado and a light cole slaw. The ""original"" Korzo burger was a very close second.  The thin crispy bread encasing the juicy burger definitely had me believing that this burger has won all of the awards it has over the last few years!! The chicken schnitzel was also a great entree, although a bit less unique than the other two. I would recommend going with the Korzo burger or pulled pork if you are hitting up this spot!! Next time you're in bay ridge.... Don't forget to stop by this hot-spot.... You will surely be thanking me afterwards ;)",5.0

"Came here a few weeks ago for dinner with my friends and had an awesome meal. If you're looking a new place for dinner and in the mood for something different in Bay Ridge ... This is your place! The food has a sort-of southern feel to it, but in the best way!Their menu somehow strikes the seemingly-impossible yet ideal balance between being both comfort-food-esque and local/healthy/seasonal. For apps, we started with the Turnip-Fall Squash Dumplings and the Beet. As for the dumplings, we opted for the mushroom-herb option, and it was amazing!! One of the highlights of the meal for sure. The subtle flavors of the various wild mushroom varieties was a perfect pair for the Asiago cheese. The Beet was another tasty app, with the candied walnuts and goat cheese complimenting the beets, which did not take over the dish.For our meal, we ordered 3 entrees that we all shared. I'm telling you.... Every single dish was great.  My favorite was the pulled pork, served with a generous portion of avocado and a light cole slaw. The ""original"" Korzo burger was a very close second.  The thin crispy bread encasing the juicy burger definitely had me believing that this burger has won all of the awards it has over the last few years!! The chicken schnitzel was also a great entree, although a bit less unique than the other two. I would recommend going with the Korzo burger or pulled pork if you are hitting up this spot!! Next time you're in bay ridge.... Don't forget to stop by this hot-spot.... You will surely be thanking me afterwards ;)",5.0

"This is definitely an amazing place to eat. Imagine a burger where you don't have to worry about anything falling out from it. That is what they serve, a piece of heaven.

"My schnitzel was great but let's talk about the burger. I convinced my sister to give me half her burger for half my chicken.  The schnitzel was crunchy, tasty, and cooked perfectly, along with the super well dressed salad, beets, and mashed potatoes.

"Finally dined at the Brooklyn Beet Company!   It is definitely not a huge restaurant, but I think it adds to it's charm.   It's decorated really cool and I LOVED the hanging lights.  I believe they have an outdoor area in the back as well. The food was REALLY good and I look forward to going back to try different dishes!  My husband refused to go with me to eat here because he thought all the food was made with beets (btw, not everything is made with beets, but everything we ordered came with a garnish of beets---I love beets, so I wasn't bothered by it---but I'm sure you could ask them to leave them off).  We started off with the turnip fall-squash dumplings with wild mushroom filling---AMAZING.    I had the chicken schnitzel which was SO GOOD!!!   My sister had the pulled pork sandwich---she loved it (and I stole some off her plate---so good!).Even though the food was amazingly good and the service was great, I couldn't give 5 stars---it was a 95 degree humid day and they had the windows in the front open and just fans on.  IT WAS SO HOT!!   A few customers complained (we didn't because we sat under a vent that was breezy) but they didn't do anything about it.Another thing I'm not a fan of is the communal tables....I think it looked cool in the restaurant, but when you are going out for a kid-free night (getting away from my two screaming children) and two toddlers get seated next to you banging forks  and kicking and yelling and their parents say nothing.....it kind of ruined my dining experience---TOTALLY not the restaurant's fault....but that is why I'm not a fan of communal seating.    But I plan on going back when it's cooler out and enjoying some of the other dishes.   Definitely a must try!!  Beet lovers or not!",4.0
Ok I'm not a beet person but this place actually makes beet taste good. We had the bacon wrapped beet which was amazing. The beet burger is big and looks very fulfilling. I had the mushroom wrap and it was oh so tasty. You tend to forget that you're eating beets.  The place isn't big so I wouldn't suggest a big party and if you're going for dinner or lunch don't go during the popular times. They also had a good amount of crafted beers which I didn't taste but they seemed interesting.  Maybe next time I'll drink one. Their fish and chip is also spot on. It was better then some of the places we had in London.,4.0
"From my visits here, never a disappointment. Relaxed casual environment, communal table seating. Kinda narrow, but hey, that's Real Estate in NYC.Dishes arw well crafted. The one app that sticks in my mind are those Bacon wrapped Dates with Goat Cheese. Getting hungry just writing about it.Roll with the service style here.

"First time here. Ordered the original with an appetizer of bacon wrapped asparagus. Girlfriend ordered the chef's burger. The asparagus was nothing special really, exactly what it sounds like. The dipping sauce was good though. Definitely have to use that. The burger was nice and juicy. Medium rare as requested so that's a plus. I like how the burger was prepared, it comes with a bun that encapsulated the whole thing so nothing falls out at the bottom. Ordered the chocolate truffles for dessert. The truffles were good, not too sweet. Only reasons why this place loses a star is because service was a tad too slow for my liking.

"I've heard many good things about this place and finally came to see what all the fuss was about.First of all, farm to table is my thing. I can't say enough about how much I love the concept.

When it comes to the seating, the tables are set up like picnic tables. 3 long booths in a ""railroad style"" layout.

There were 5 so we had to fight for the last one. The bacon was crisp and all the flavors were unbelievably delicious. I mean really. It's bacon and dates and cheese. What can go wrong? Nothing. Then 2 of us shared The Beet salad. It was a good mix of beet, candied walnuts, carrots and cheese. I didn't like the dressing which was some sort of mayo type situation. Then again I don't typically like dressing and I really don't like mayo. So I may not be the best person to ask about that. Anyway, my friends also ordered the pulled pork sandwich and the burger. I didn't try either, but they made a lot of satisfied noises for me to know that they enjoyed their dishes. This place is pretty awesome. I'd definitely come back. Oh, the bathroom.

This place is hot right now with the hipsters and the Bay Ridge trust fund kids. We went on a Saturday night and were seated right away.

It was waiter recommend and at first I was leery.  Dates rapped in bacon with  blue cheese. Try it you will like it but don't share it. My date had the short rib which was a special that night and she enjoyed it very much being a serious meat eater like me. I had the burger after hearing so much about it and must say was extremely disappointed. Nice size burger quality meat seasoned really nice but they put it on a pita bread that was fried or just really greasy which ruined the burger for me.

"Let's talk brunch. Hi, my name is Helen and I love brunch. Maybe a little too much...I believe it's the happiest meal of the week!Now, what brunch is complete without a sexy weekend cocktail?! I went for a Bloody Mary and I was so disappointed with what I got. I mean I appreciate fresh horseradish but when there are some serious chunky chunks coming up through the straw it's a bit too much. Other than that the flavor was pretty flat and weak. There was no garnish but a lime wedge and to be honest I didn't even finish it. Not even hot sauce could save this poor little fella. I'll probably just go for a beer next time.I got the latkes and bratwurst which comes with 2 fried eggs, sauerkraut and pickled vegetables. All the things that make a littlePuerto Rican Brooklynite raised in a Jewish neighborhood with Polish and Russian influences happy as a pig in...well you get the picture. If you're going to lead a menu item with latkes then by George I want latkes! And lots of them!  My poor little latke was hidden under my over cooked eggs. I guess I should have specified how I wanted my eggs but since the server didn't ask I assumed they'd be runny...not so. The brat was covered with a nice layer of pickled deliciousness which had little hints of sweetness from the raisins that were strewn about. I think the falvors were nice but the overall experience didn't exactly have me licking the plate. I'll definitely be back for dinner. Get adventurous and enjoy!",3.0
"So delicious and fresh! My husband had the korzo burger which was spectacular. I ordered the schnitzel which I really enjoyed..

"Cozy spot!I had their Korzo burger which looks small, but is really filling.  The burger bun is ""wrapped"" around the meat so it helps keep it from being drippy - keeping all the taste and juices inside! *thumbs up*I also tried their Beet Cocktail which is very strong for me.  I should admit -  I am a cheap date.  I don't have an opinion about this cocktail except that it's unique enough that I'd recommend that you try it yourself.  I wouldn't recommend coming here with a big party though.  For me, the table settings are not arranged well for a big party: 6 people would be comfortable.Enjoy!",4.0
"Came for brunch a few weeks ago and ordered the Korzo burger. Quite good but also quite large and decadent. I forgot what my friends had ordered but the portion sizes were quite large.

I will go back for the dates appetizer and and will try another unique Euro dish what ever the hell that is. Good date spot  very trendy and different.,4.0
"Let's talk brunch. Hi, my name is Helen and I love brunch. Maybe a little too much...I believe it's the happiest meal of the week!Now, what brunch is complete without a sexy weekend cocktail?! I went for a Bloody Mary and I was so disappointed with what I got. I mean I appreciate fresh horseradish but when there are some serious chunky chunks coming up through the straw it's a bit too much. Other than that the flavor was pretty flat and weak. There was no garnish but a lime wedge and to be honest I didn't even finish it. Not even hot sauce could save this poor little fella. I'll probably just go for a beer next time.I got the latkes and bratwurst which comes with 2 fried eggs, sauerkraut and pickled vegetables. All the things that make a littlePuerto Rican Brooklynite raised in a Jewish neighborhood with Polish and Russian influences happy as a pig in...well you get the picture. If you're going to lead a menu item with latkes then by George I want latkes! And lots of them!  My poor little latke was hidden under my over cooked eggs. I guess I should have specified how I wanted my eggs but since the server didn't ask I assumed they'd be runny...not so. The brat was covered with a nice layer of pickled deliciousness which had little hints of sweetness from the raisins that were strewn about. I think the falvors were nice but the overall experience didn't exactly have me licking the plate. I'll definitely be back for dinner. Get adventurous and enjoy!",3.0
"So delicious and fresh! My husband had the korzo burger which was spectacular. I ordered the schnitzel which I really enjoyed.. We also ordered a couple of appetizers the mushroom and pork squash dumplings a MUST. I quenched my thirst with a bklyn beet tini and it was fantastic..a bit of a stiffy, but I like that .This place is definitely worth a try!",5.0
"Cozy spot!I had their Korzo burger which looks small, but is really filling.  The burger bun is ""wrapped"" around the meat so it helps keep it from being drippy - keeping all the taste and juices inside! *thumbs up*I also tried their Beet Cocktail which is very strong for me.  I should admit -  I am a cheap date.  I don't have an opinion about this cocktail except that it's unique enough that I'd recommend that you try it yourself.  I wouldn't recommend coming here with a big party though.  For me, the table settings are not arranged well for a big party: 6 people would be comfortable.Enjoy!",4.0
"Came for brunch a few weeks ago and ordered the Korzo burger. Quite good but also quite large and decadent. I forgot what my friends had ordered but the portion sizes were quite large. Also, the ketchup is great. It's a unique beet ketchup. The back patio is also quite nice. But with only four tables, it's quite small.",4.0
"Our favorite place to eat in Bay Ridge. Try the Pork Ragu Latkes. They are the most delicious thing you will ever put in your mouth. My husband tried the grape leaves last time he was in and said they were amazing too. I can't wait to go try those as well. We enjoy the chicken schnitzel and the korzo burger was good, but really intense. But the latkes are what keep us coming back.",5.0
"It's nice and cosy. However, seats for 2 are uncomfortable and the table is very small. I would not recommend this place for a date. I do recommend it If you plan to hang out with 3+ people. The food was good, except for mashed potatoes (too watery). Staff was attentive and polite.",4.0
First time here and overall great experience.  Food took a bit long to come out but that only means it's all fresh. It was worth the little longer wait. I had the chef burger which was perfectly cooked and great flavor. The side salad and coleslaw were both great. It's a tiny place but I didn't feel like I was rushed out. I was also able to get the bon  bon dessert which was so great I would go back just for that. Definitely will go back,5.0

"This has become our #1 favorite in the 'Ridge and really one of our faves in the entire city.At first the concept takes a little getting used to - it's farm-to-table AND eastern european comfort food?  But the emphasis on fresh veggies, the beer / cocktail / wine menu, and the cool burgers are all fantastic.  Staff works hard but are always friendly, and surprisingly we've rarely had a hard time getting in, despite the shoebox-like dimensions.",5.0
"This place is a hidden gem. It's so hidden I walked by it. And when I wanted to go in, I couldn't figure out where the door was. It's small in size, but comfortable.Right from the get go the food was amazing. Every appetizer was flavorful. I believe we ordered everything.  The one that was best was the gorgonzola wrapped with bacon. I will go back just for that. The mac and cheese with bacon bits was good, too. Reminded me of my favorite cheese place right off of union square in Manhattan,  beecher's.The cocktails were good and strong. My favorites were the orange flavored and jalapeño flavored; I forgot the names.My lamb entrée was good, but I tried everyone else's and wished I had ordered something more flavorful. I really want to order the apple dish next time, or the steak. The big plus was that everything tasted healthy. The deserts were amazing. We each order a different one. I think the best was the bon bon, but you can't go wrong with anything. I definitely see myself going back!The waiter was very handsome,  too.  :)",4.0

"Brunch must not be the best time to go. The two egg dishes at our table were left half finished. I had the vegetarian beet and black-eyed pea burger that comes with a side salad. The burger was totally bland, even the cheese couldn't save it from under-seasoning.

You wont get the typical fries with ketchup here but its nice to switch it up with something different and you wont feel terribly full after. I also tried a piece of my friends flounder which was really good as well. The only thing about this place is its small and the tables are picnic style so you literally will be sitting next to strangers on the same table. Not a big deal for me but may be for some others.

Tasted 2 appetizers and 3 burgers. Appetizers were ok but the burgers not so much. None of the ingredients complemented any of the others and it tasted like a hot mess of random flavors.

cute little restaurant but with a rustic feel to it. The original Korzo burger was one of the best tasting burger I've ever had. It was tucked into a pita-like bread so the juice won't pour out and the meat on the patty was just succulent. I'm not the biggest fan of the beet ketchup they have but everything was delicious and fresh!,5.0
One of the most amazing and unique dining experiences I have ever had. Every meal was something different something I've never had before. from the appetizers to the main dish there was a delightful and tasteful surprise around every corner. I think it's safe to say that the beet veggie burger is the best veggie burger I have had in Brooklyn and probably anywhere. When you go do not pass up on all the different condiments such as the mustard and ketchup that are made from scratch. They are delicious!,5.0
"While I like this place a lot. It's one of only a couple of *good* restaurants (Petit Oven being another), I've already eaten everything on the menu. While it's very good food, to even great at times, one can eat the same thing only so many times. New menu items would get me to come back more often. One need not be as extreme as Petit Oven whose menu changes weekly, but adding some changing, perhaps seasonal items would have me walking through the door more.",4.0
"Had an awesome night out here while visiting. We met up with friends for drinks and food. Definition of hole in the wall but it is all hipster chic inside. Family style German tables to sit at with a few little couple's tables. The menu is a little different but mostly the same as what's posted online. Some of the dessert and beers are seasonal. The food was great and the service was helpful and chill. We had an issue with our order not going through, but the guy helping us was really apologetic and got us free drinks of our choice and stuff to make up for it. Plus our appetizers had gone through fine so we were chillin. It is pretty small so you might want to get a reservation (some people had to get turned away). It was also a little chilly, at least where we were seated so we needed our coats the whole time. Overall a great place and very unique. Would eat there often if I lived in the area. You just can't really go wrong with anything there. Enjoy!",5.0
"5 Stars. Boom.This place is so good, I can't stand it. And guess what? I don't even LIKE beets. BBC has actually won me over and it wasn't even because of their famous beets..Their namesake! I think that's saying something.I have been here twice, and luckily for me, I live within a 2 block radius.. so I look forward to devouring their entire menu. :)*Both times I have ordered the bacon wrapped dates, and all I have to say is: If there is a heaven, I really freaking hope they serve these things up there. Because.. wow. Perfectly built, with each flavor hitting every pleasurable spot on the tongue. Salty, sweet, bitter. Mouth watering delicious.*The Fried Burger is genius. I'm plugging my ears to all you nay sayers and skeptics saying ""A burger is already high in calories, but FRIED? WTF BRAH THATS CRAY CRAY. FATTY."" But don't worry, let them miss out.. more for me. Really, this burger is so smartly made. After I bit into the Original Korzo Burger, I wanted to walk back into the kitchen and personally shake the chefs hand. The way the burger is layered, the minimal but flavorful ingredients, the perfect amount of melted Ementaller cheese mixed with the ale mustard inside this calzone-like creation is so.freaking.good. (P.S. You wont find Heinz Ketchup in the place.. you will get their homemade beet ketchup, and you'll like it..even if you don't like beets. Say what?) *One time I died and went to heaven (where I also conveniently found the Bacon Wrapped Dates) and it was because I had just consumed the Turnip-Fall Squash Dumplings. Inside, it was filled with pulled pork, brown farm butter, and Asiago.  Those ingredients? In your mouth? Yep. 'nuff said. Honestly, I have tried other things on their menu including the brisket goulash,  Bull's Blood wine, mixed drinks, and they're all great -- but the most defining reason as to why I will continue to come back here is because of their impeccable service. I call to make a reservation and every time I get a ""Sounds wonderful Kara, we will be waiting for you!"" And both times our waitress was attentive, smiley, and nice. Job well done, BBC.

"I'm so in love with this place. This very small establishment can only seat maybe 20-30 people and the menu is small but everything they serve is amazing. My favorite is the spicy beef goulash. They put little dumplings on top which are so good. I like it so much that I even ate this hot, spicy, heavy dish in 90 degree weather. They have a jalapeno cocktail which is really good (Bay Breakfast) and offer a small but well balanced beer menu. Their burgers are amazing and I love the buns they use, as my burgers tend to fall apart by the time I get halfway through. Why can't everyone use these buns!!

"Oh man! I had such high hopes for this place, so maybe today was just a off day? But wow, it was bad! A group of 8 of us came in at around 11 today for brunch and it was still pretty empty, just us and one other table. We ordered drinks and food, and then waited. Oh boy, did we wait.

I mean, I get it, we're a big group and it takes time, and really it might not have been such a bad hour if getting refills of our water and coffee hadn't been like pulling teeth but nope! Not our waitress' style, apparently. When the food finally came out it was a mess. Half of our orders were cold, eggs were overcooked and rock solid, a side of beets turned out to be three small beets and a whole bunch of pickled vegetables (huh?), and they completely forgot one person's order. Seriously, they just didn't make it, and she sat there without food until everyone else was done eating ... and then they brought it out (again, huh?). The food was bad! The service was terrible!

After all of that, I kind of expected them to at least acknowledge it by comping us something, but they did the opposite.

"In my previous review I wrote that I would probably go back someday and regret giving this place 3/5 stars, when I went there around the time that it opened. This place has proved me right in every way imaginable. My wife and I went back for the first time in two years yesterday and what followed was one of the best meals I've sat down to in my life. She got an inventive cocktail that was a bit on the spicy side (yes that's right, a cocktail too spicy for my Indian wife), and I had a craft organic beer that was great. She got the chef's special burger, I got my personal favorite cut of meat, the hanger steak. Her burger, described by her as probably the best one she's ever had (I had a bite myself and it was something to reckon with), was cooked inside a perfectly done pastry shell, with amazing coleslaw and perfectly done fries. My hanger steak in its red wine sauce WAS (notice the lack of the conditional adjective here) the most delicious piece of meat I've ever eaten. Not to mention the perfectly sauteed kale and again, fries that were almost too good. What's that you say? The best hanger steak ever? Well then surely the service must be terrible...NOPE. Attentive, well mannered waiter was there to bear witness to my wonder at this amazing meal. I even offered to hug the chef for the emotional experience I had just been provided, however he declined, probably my one complaint I had that night.So then surely the dessert must have been lackluster? It's impossible to keep up such a skullcrushing level of awesome for a full hour and a half meal. BAM! The beet company saw my bet and raised us a moist but crispy strawberry covered whip cream bon-bon. The rematch was over, the beet company had finished us and we threw down our white napkins in surrender. For the love of god, go give this place your money.

Came here to try their famous fried burger. It was not bad. To me it tasted much like a plain donut a bit sweet wrapped around a big burger. The burger was still juicy and flavorful.

"One of the first places I tried when I moved to Brooklyn. I must say, it set the bar pretty high for me.I ordered based on what was most recommended on previous yelp reviews. If you're unsure of what to order as you're looking through the menu, do yourself a favor and put down the menu. Order the goulash and korzo burger.The goulash is absolutely amazing. It's perfect to share between two people, even 3. The korzo burger is definitely unique and quite good. I've been in Brooklyn for about 7 months now and haven't tasted a better burger thus far. Like I said, this place set the bar quite high for me.The only knocks I have for this place are the drinks and slow service. The drinks were unspectacular and didn't match the quality of our food order. In addition, the service was a bit slow for a weeknight. However, these knocks shouldn't convince you of not trying this place. The goulash and korzo burger will tempt you to come back whenever you're near or around bay ridge.",4.0

"We've been walking past this place for a while and even popped open the door a few times to look inside.  But my g/friend was put off by the communal tables and high pew-like seating.  Being rather height-deprived, tall chairs make her feel like a baby.  Nevertheless, we were invited to Brooklyn Beet Company tonight and overall I'm glad we went.  So is she.For entrees, we ordered the duck confit, trout, goulash and their signature Korzo burger -- a chef's special with guacamole, bleu cheese and bacon.  But out first were the beet-tinis and jalapeno tequlia ""Bay Breakfast""  (can't decode the origin of that namet), a beet salad and two  orders of dumplings, pork and veggie.The drinks were terrific.  The jalapeno drink was spicy enough that as the designated iron tongue at the table I wound up guzzling 90% of it.  As a norm I don't drink hard liquor but the beet-tini was really tasty.  So were the dumplings and salad.  The dumplings had the perfect texture and the beets were the best I've had anywhere..  The service was friendly, informed and very helpful.  Five stars there.Then came the entrees.  My g/friend's goulash was really tasty.   The trout fell flat with my foodie dinner companions, as it usually does in restaurants that don't specialize in seafood.  The duck got slightly better reviews but since I had a pet duck as a kid and don't like fresh water fish as a rule I didn't try either.My Korzo burger which was rated so highly by the Village Voice was, for me, just okay.  Not bad, but also not something I'd order again.  Part of my disappointment was that it It came well done when I'd ordered medium rare but it tasted like, well, a central casting, well done burger.   Other than that I found nothing unique about it.  It was plenty juicy but I'm not sure what all the raves are about.  You'll find a tastier burger next door at Burger Bistro.  The chocolate desserts were very nice, imaginative and a welcom break from the standard issue flour-less chocolate cake.I'd probably give this place 3.5 stars but the starting courses and service pushed it to a 4.",4.0
One of the best burgers in NYC and the best veggie burger I've ever had. Made with a mix of beets and stuff. Fun quaint little place with great food good beers and cocktails in a chill no fuss environment.,5.0
Finally got around to stopping by the Brooklyn Beet Company and I'm happy I did. My aunt and I went here for brunch after wandering 3rd avenue and enjoying the long overdue warm weather. The restaurant is small and relies on communal seating to get the most out of the tiny space. We missed the morning brunch crowd and were finished before the dinner crowd hit so we had plenty of table space. The brunch menu was filled with lots of tempting items and I finally settled on the beer battered cod. The cod itself was ok. I wish the batter had been a bit crisper. The stand out of the dish was the potato chips dunked in beet ketchup and the side salad of greens. The salad was amazing and highlighted the restaurant's farm-to-table ethos.If I had to do it all over again I would have probably choosen the Beet Salad dish. My aunt had the pancakes which she said had great flavor but were a bit heavy. I also ordered their Ottomobile cocktail which I am still thinking about. It was light and refereshing with a subtle licorice flavor. Not something I would normally like but it was cocktail perfection and I am trying to figure out how to recreate it at home.  The staff was friendly without being overbearing. A lot is made of their beet ketchup. I love beets and surely enough loved their beet based ketchup. It has a really earthy rich beet flavor with the consistency of ketchup. I'd definitely like to come back and try their dinner menu. And order another Ottomobile or three - hey it's for research!,4.0
"The first time I came here, the kitchen was closed (we got there late) so me and my date decided to have a couple of drinks. We had the beetini and another cocktail, wish I could remember the name! Both were delicious, so we decided to come back the next week a little earlier to try the food. So glad we did. We got two kinds of dumplings for an appetizer, the mushroom and the pork. Both of them were superb, but I liked the pork one better. For dinner, we got the schnitzel. Not only was it super filling and tremendous, but it was also fantastic! It came with awesome mashed potatoes and a nice side salad. We tried to finish everything but after the appetizer it was an impossible task. We hope to try the brunch soon!Oh, and before I forget, both times we went we had the same waitress. I didn't get her name, but she was an absolute sweetheart. Absolutely positively highly recommend this place!",5.0

It's perfect to share between two people, even 3. The korzo burger is definitely unique and quite good. I've been in Brooklyn for about 7 months now and haven't tasted a better burger thus far. Like I said, this place set the bar quite high for me.The only knocks I have for this place are the drinks and slow service. The drinks were unspectacular and didn't match the quality of our food order. In addition, the service was a bit slow for a weeknight. However, these knocks shouldn't convince you of not trying this place. The goulash and korzo burger will tempt you to come back whenever you're near or around bay ridge.",4.0
"The Korzo burger was pretty unique and tasty.  I ordered an Original and a veggie,  It was enjoyable.  But, the goulash was a little disappointed or perhaps my expectation was too high.  The Beet cocktail in the mean time was ......well, maybe I was dumb enough to order it  since I'm not a beet fan my self.  I will gb for the Korzo burgers only.",3.0
"We've been walking past this place for a while and even popped open the door a few times to look inside.  But my g/friend was put off by the communal tables and high pew-like seating.  Being rather height-deprived, tall chairs make her feel like a baby.  Nevertheless, we were invited to Brooklyn Beet Company tonight and overall I'm glad we went.  So is she.For entrees, we ordered the duck confit, trout, goulash and their signature Korzo burger -- a chef's special with guacamole, bleu cheese and bacon.  But out first were the beet-tinis and jalapeno tequlia ""Bay Breakfast""  (can't decode the origin of that namet), a beet salad and two  orders of dumplings, pork and veggie.The drinks were terrific.  The jalapeno drink was spicy enough that as the designated iron tongue at the table I wound up guzzling 90% of it.  As a norm I don't drink hard liquor but the beet-tini was really tasty.  So were the dumplings and salad.  The dumplings had the perfect texture and the beets were the best I've had anywhere..  The service was friendly, informed and very helpful.  Five stars there.Then came the entrees.  My g/friend's goulash was really tasty.   The trout fell flat with my foodie dinner companions, as it usually does in restaurants that don't specialize in seafood.  The duck got slightly better reviews but since I had a pet duck as a kid and don't like fresh water fish as a rule I didn't try either.My Korzo burger which was rated so highly by the Village Voice was, for me, just okay.  Not bad, but also not something I'd order again.  Part of my disappointment was that it It came well done when I'd ordered medium rare but it tasted like, well, a central casting, well done burger.   Other than that I found nothing unique about it.  It was plenty juicy but I'm not sure what all the raves are about.  You'll find a tastier burger next door at Burger Bistro.  The chocolate desserts were very nice, imaginative and a welcom break from the standard issue flour-less chocolate cake.I'd probably give this place 3.5 stars but the starting courses and service pushed it to a 4.",4.0
One of the best burgers in NYC and the best veggie burger I've ever had. Made with a mix of beets and stuff. Fun quaint little place with great food good beers and cocktails in a chill no fuss environment.,5.0
Finally got around to stopping by the Brooklyn Beet Company and I'm happy I did. My aunt and I went here for brunch after wandering 3rd avenue and enjoying the long overdue warm weather. The restaurant is small and relies on communal seating to get the most out of the tiny space. We missed the morning brunch crowd and were finished before the dinner crowd hit so we had plenty of table space. The brunch menu was filled with lots of tempting items and I finally settled on the beer battered cod. The cod itself was ok. I wish the batter had been a bit crisper. The stand out of the dish was the potato chips dunked in beet ketchup and the side salad of greens. The salad was amazing and highlighted the restaurant's farm-to-table ethos.If I had to do it all over again I would have probably choosen the Beet Salad dish. My aunt had the pancakes which she said had great flavor but were a bit heavy. I also ordered their Ottomobile cocktail which I am still thinking about. It was light and refereshing with a subtle licorice flavor. Not something I would normally like but it was cocktail perfection and I am trying to figure out how to recreate it at home.  The staff was friendly without being overbearing. A lot is made of their beet ketchup. I love beets and surely enough loved their beet based ketchup. It has a really earthy rich beet flavor with the consistency of ketchup. I'd definitely like to come back and try their dinner menu. And order another Ottomobile or three - hey it's for research!,4.0
"The first time I came here, the kitchen was closed (we got there late) so me and my date decided to have a couple of drinks. We had the beetini and another cocktail, wish I could remember the name! Both were delicious, so we decided to come back the next week a little earlier to try the food. So glad we did. We got two kinds of dumplings for an appetizer, the mushroom and the pork. Both of them were superb, but I liked the pork one better. For dinner, we got the schnitzel. Not only was it super filling and tremendous, but it was also fantastic! It came with awesome mashed potatoes and a nice side salad. We tried to finish everything but after the appetizer it was an impossible task. We hope to try the brunch soon!Oh, and before I forget, both times we went we had the same waitress. I didn't get her name, but she was an absolute sweetheart. Absolutely positively highly recommend this place!",5.0
Delish!! Everything is soo good. If you like beet this is your place. Also for hubby their deep fried burger is amazing and I loved the beet burger. Also their Brunch has unique menu options with more delicious food.,5.0

"Very interesting and unique place.This place hit almost all the notes: From the communal seating, to the nice brick layout with the dim atmosphere, to the large Karaf's filled with cold water for self pouring (i'm a sucker for this), to the good food and serviceOur waiter/bartender was kick ass, and basically held down the whole restaurant while I was there, without once forgetting about our food or drinks, he alone deserves 5 starsCame here a few more times since I first reviewed and the other women who works here is really great as well and is always on point with serviceThe food:The Korzo Burger, fried, was everything I could ask for, delicious, fried, juicy, packed with flavor, and surely one of a kind.*Update since my original review is that the burgers now come with a delicious, fresh side salad, very good and good mint flavorThe side chips we ordered were out of this worldMy gf got the Free-Range Chicken Schnitzel, which was one of the better schnitzels I have had in a while. Portion was huge and came with a really delicious potato salad with bacon.The butternut Squash perogies are very delicious, flavorful and not something you come by oftenThe Wurst sampler is also delicious, good saurkraut and mustard touchesThe only thing I was not a fan of was the appetizer with lobster,bacon and cheese which lacked quite a bit of flavor despite all the delicious sounding ingrediants, and made me wish I stuck with my gut and had the Tongue sliders which I heard were greatThey had a great beer selection, with Korzo Organic Ale being my favorite of the bunch.And last but not least, lets not forget the Beet Ketchup, made of only beets, pretty brilliant in my opinion.Point of this long winded food analysis is: go here, get your self some great food, and enjoy one of the few interesting restaurants my side of Brooklyn has to offer.",4.0

"Went to BBC for dinner this evening and it was so great! We had the pork dumplings to start, I had the beet burger and my husband had the duck.

"my new favorite neighborhood restaurant. no contest.what's there not to love?  farm to table concept.  everything has a touch of beets in it... i heart beets.  they are also known for their awesome korzo burger...and you can choose a beet burger or grass-fed beef.  Plus, you get to choose from a fried burger, or grilled flat bread. Either way, the options seem endless.  You will not be disappointed, i promise you.if you decide to go with the burger (as opposed to their duck, or steak, or GOULASH).... you must get the red bliss potato chips with it.  aside from fries, nothing i love more than crunchy, salty chips.",5.0
"I wanted to try this place after seeing they serve organic, seasonal foods, and was intrigued by the beet theme. They didn't disappoint. My cousin arrived 30 min before me, without a res (it was a Thurs around 6:45p) - he was seated right away and he ordered a soup while he waited for me, which he said he really liked. On my arrival I was greeted warmly by the waiter, who was a one man team it seemed, & very courteous and eager to explain menu items and drinks etc. Ambiance is cozy and rustic, long narrow polished wood farmhouse style tables run along one side of the room with polished wood benches on either side, dim ambient lighting simulating glowing candlelight warmed up the space - & it's just bright enuf to read the menu & see what ur eating clearly. I ordered a beetini cocktail which I enjoyed, & we shared the bacon-wrapped dates stuffed with blue cheese which were delicious and would order again. For entree my cousin had the beef goulash which was quite good tho needed a touch of salt, and I had the Korzo burger, was impressed that they automatically make it M-R unless u prefer it more well done - YUMM! Meat was really fresh, the house made bread that envelopes the burger, which can apparently be grilled or fried - I forgot to specify and waiter forgot to ask, so it came fried (extra time at the gym for that one!) - was better than most burger buns I've tried. I suppose it was worth the extra calories :) They make their own beet-ketchup and hot sauce - perfect on the burger. I didn't try dessert - we were too full, portions were generous. Next time! And apparently they also serve brunch - I will definitely be back to try it! My only caveat - menu is a bit pork-heavy, great if you love pork, not so great if u try to avoid it. But there are still enuf options to keep most happy.",4.0

The beer was quite good and we thought the dumplings were very tasty---a little too greasy for the both of us---but flavor-wise, they were spot on.The burgers? Well, they were interesting. It was definitely nice to try something different and it tasted good. But for $15, the burger and a little salad made the plate a little sad. I actually didn't care for my burger so I ended up swapping the other half with my partner-in-crime, whose burger I preferred.

I had the hangar steak with kale, and homemade chips for entree and he had the brisket goulash. i would definitely come back for the steak. satisfying, great textures and sharp flavors. the goulash is rich and comforting; would love this if it's cold out! the ONLY thing that lacked personality was the dessert.

"The Korzo burger is really as good as they say, one of the best I've had and a must-try. I only tried the Original, but the others seem excellent as well.

Overall their food is very well executed, very tasty, fresh, and without pretenses. I'm a fan! And oh, the prices are very reasonable too. I don't live close by, but if I did, I would be a regular and explore the rest of the menu. I doubt any of it would let me down. There aren't too many restaurants in NY that make me want to be a regular, but BBC is one of them. The only minor issue I have is the seating arrangement. The restaurant is long and narrow, and you are seated on long tables along with other guests. I prefer individual tables. For that I take off 1/2 star. I really wish BBC the best, I hope they do really well, so they can move to a larger place and build from there. So go out there and patronize this little gem!****1/2",5.0

"Please take me to Brooklyn Beet everyday!I love this place. Food is 5 star quality. Price and service are 4 stars!I went there for Sunday Brunch.I ordered Farmer Cheese Polenta with ground beef brisket goulash, not knowing what Polenta was. LOL But, needless to say, I fell in love with it after first bite. It was a creamy texture cheese cornmeal that looks like a pancake with stewed beef on top and garnished with some nan( pita bread?), two eggs and some greens. It wasn't too sweet or cheesy. My friend got pancake with bacon, ham, poached eggs and berries. They already poured much syrup (apple sauce) onto the pancake and gave him a side of syrup. It was really sweet without syrup, but the kind of sweetness I don't mind eating once in a while ( I usually steer away from sweet food because I don't like it). If you are craving sweet brunch, go for it!The waitress asked how food was every now and then but didn't refill our water so i guess it means 4 stars.The total came out to like 42 with tips and taxes. Not really an affordable brunch spot for Brooklyn but it's definitely worth a try for special Sundays.",4.0

I don't live close by, but if I did, I would be a regular and explore the rest of the menu. I doubt any of it would let me down. There aren't too many restaurants in NY that make me want to be a regular, but BBC is one of them. The only minor issue I have is the seating arrangement. The restaurant is long and narrow, and you are seated on long tables along with other guests. I prefer individual tables. For that I take off 1/2 star. I really wish BBC the best, I hope they do really well, so they can move to a larger place and build from there. So go out there and patronize this little gem!****1/2",5.0
"Absolutely delicious hole-in-the-wall eatery, appeasing many a foodie near and far (seriously, I have folks coming from Denver for this!). Beyond elated to find this gem in Bay Ridge! My uber-picky brother claimed the Korzo burger was one of the best burgers he's ever tasted -- and our shared pork dumplings were out of this world. We can't wait to go back  -- but will do so on an off night, as this place gets packed.",5.0
"Please take me to Brooklyn Beet everyday!I love this place. Food is 5 star quality. Price and service are 4 stars!I went there for Sunday Brunch.I ordered Farmer Cheese Polenta with ground beef brisket goulash, not knowing what Polenta was. LOL But, needless to say, I fell in love with it after first bite. It was a creamy texture cheese cornmeal that looks like a pancake with stewed beef on top and garnished with some nan( pita bread?), two eggs and some greens. It wasn't too sweet or cheesy. My friend got pancake with bacon, ham, poached eggs and berries. They already poured much syrup (apple sauce) onto the pancake and gave him a side of syrup. It was really sweet without syrup, but the kind of sweetness I don't mind eating once in a while ( I usually steer away from sweet food because I don't like it). If you are craving sweet brunch, go for it!The waitress asked how food was every now and then but didn't refill our water so i guess it means 4 stars.The total came out to like 42 with tips and taxes. Not really an affordable brunch spot for Brooklyn but it's definitely worth a try for special Sundays.",4.0
"Not so much .... I thought everything was just OK ,the Goulash was over nothing & in a spicy tomato based sauce , dish looked like soup .... The place is creative with their seating since there's no room , no heat either ....",2.0

"For once I wasn't dining alone so between our party we ordered almost everything on the right side(main offerings)of the menu and a few things from the left(appetizers).  Everything was ooh-ed and aah-ed over repeatedly.  Not only was the food presented beautifully but it tasted amazing.  The menu could do a bit better at describing the dishes but really, you can't go wrong.  Personally, I had the Duck Spatzle.  The duck was fall-off-the-bone tender, yet with a crispiness to the skin, the vegetables perfectly cooked and the white wine sauce was excellent.",4.0
"Best brunch I've had in a long time. The prices were about average $11-12, the coffee excellent and service very friendly.

"i've been dying to try this place for a long time.  i love korzo and i love their fried burgers.  i've been looking for this place for a while and i didn't know they changed their name and it wasn't called korzo so i finally found it a few months after the fact and that was by accident.the communal seats are very cute and the restaurant is very narrow.  this a great addition to the bay ridge area and i'd go back for some good burgers.  i wish they would expand their menu a little more since i feel it is kinda small right now.  if you've had korzo at either the park slope or village location, this place is very similar in food and decor.   i have to say my burger tasted a tad better at the park slope location, maybe it was chef.  so if you are looking for the bay ridge location, this place is it, just a different name.the waiter told me they called it BBC because they were originally going to use it as a storage facility but decided to turn it into a restaurant.  good job!  kudos to you guys.  it would be nice if they had some HH specials or weekly specials.another thing i want to add is that the burgers are pricey and it needs to come with fries or something.  even though this place is good, they shouldn't be charging manhattan prices.",4.0
"Amazing place, small but damn good food. Had the Amish Fried Chicken which was a special when I went and it was awesome. My girl had the steak and that was so good as well.

Literally this is one of the best burgers I have ever had - now I know why they are so famous.  I have been on the hunt for a really good burger in the Brooklyn area and this is the only one that really hits the spot.  All of their food looks and tastes amazing - I have also tried the goulash and it is so satisfying with the flavorful kick you experience after each bite.  The sides of coleslaw and salad are also awesome too.  Just don't come around 7 on a weekend night because it will be packed as it is a smaller venue.  I will be trying their affiliated Korzo affiliated restaurant in Park Slope :),5.0
"I love the ambience in here. Its so cozy and friendly. My girlfriend and I went for dinner on a weeknight and we walked right in. I ordered the mushroom dumplings and she had the winter squash soup. Both were amazing!! For entree she had the potato pancakes and I had the goulash. Her pancakes were delish, my goulash was just ok. It needed the homemade hot sauce they make.

"Really impressed by this little gem in a neighborhood filled with sub par eateries. Arrived at about 8.30pm on a snowy Saturday night - the restaurant is bijou so it was no surprise to find that it was full but luckily for us the two bar seats were free so we settled in for the night. Decor is rustic - suited to the farm to table ethic and well picked music complimented the cosy atmosphere. Barman was a friendly sort and soon whipped me up a beet vodka martini whilst we perused the menu. A tasty drink - surprisingly sweet and perfect for fall/winter. The menu is Northern European with lots of hearty fare so we opted for a very traditional spatzle with crispy pork belly and lots of gooey cheese to share as an appetizer - portion was just right for two and it was delicious in a scary calorific carby kind of way. The entree menu looked pretty good but we had heard about the awesome burger and the barman helpfully confirmed that it was worth the hype and award so we placed an order for two rare burgers and a side of chips...and dam, those reviews were not wrong. This burger just shot to my top 3 list ever - seriously flavorful, juicy, cooked to perfection with a crisp char and bloody centre it was topped with crispy bacon and more gooey cheese but the real surprise, the bun! Super thin it was literally a tasty edible napkin for the burger which really allowed the meat to be the star of the show and also avoided us filling up too quick on superfluous carbs. With a burger this good it would be easy to overlook the sides but the well dressed side salad, crunchy slaw and thick cut, crispy homemade chips were all delicious. A glass of wine each with dinner and before we knew it almost 1.5 hours had passed and it was check time. A reasonable $90 for two including a good tip made this a bargain  given great atmosphere and service, really good food and tasty drinks. We will be back to the beet company, I'm sure I'll examine the menu in detail each time but it's going to be hard for me to not be tempted by that burger again...and again.",5.0
"Farm to table good eats.  Get the korzo burger, meat or beet, truly addictive.  Also, the beet salad is amazing.  It gets crowded quickly, be prepared to wait, or get there early.  Also, AC is not yet up to speed for the summer, but it seems they've fixed the heating problem for the winter by attaching a shelter to the front.",5.0

"Go here.  Bay Ridge (I'm born and raised) has as deep a rut as it can get when it comes to food.  Vesuvio's, Bridgeview Diner, Greenhouse Cafe...etc.  Go here and taste what a CHEF does as opposed to a cook.  Incredibly fresh and delightfully prepared.",5.0
"Amazing food and great service. The burgers are delicious and the entire menu comes with an interesting twist. The only reason I am leaving a star off is because I have gone here twice and both times the place has been freezing cold inside.

"Okay....so I really really really wanted to like this place. Since moving to Bay Ridge from Fort Greene, I have been so disappointed with the quality of restaurants that I had stopped eating out in the area. When this place opened I had high hopes and even went in on two different occasions hoping that the second time would be better.Starting with the cocktails: really creative sounding list. I ordered a beet martini and my husband a spicy margarita. The problem is, the beet flavor was drowned out by the harshness of the vodka. It needed some simple syrup to round out the flavor. I often make infused cocktails at home and appreciate the effort, but this was a fail. We then ordered the bacon wrapped dates...because how can you go wrong with bacon? Unfortunately the bacon was soggy and the dates were dry. I feel like they were cooked the day before and then microwaved? The presentation looked like whoever was in the kitchen didn't really care; they came out arranged on tired, wilted mesclun greens that weren't edible. Also: what's with the sauce? Do I need to dip something wrapped in bacon in mayonnaise?We also had the pork shank and the burger. I will say that the pork was tender and flavorful, but the plate was altogether way too greasy. Something you might order in the Winter, but not the Spring/Summer. The burger patty was delicious, but the bread around it was soggy and overwhelming. Additionally, for 14 dollars, shouldn't the burger come with some kind of accompaniment?I will say the beet ketchup is delicious. I hope the owner reads these reviews. I believe that there is talent behind this endeavor and the neighborhood so desperately needs quality restaurants. I just can't justify spending my money here when such excellent options exist a short subway ride away.It will be interesting to see what happens in the future.

"What a great addition to 3rd Ave in Bay Ridge! It's VERY small so it is difficult to get seats on the weekends but week nights are usually do-able. I've had 4 dishes here and all were perfect. I'm not vegetarian but they do a fantastic veggie burger made with black-eyed peas and beets. I wish it were a larger space and had a bar area where I could just sit and consume a few ""beet-tinis"" (their earthy, delicious, and kind of weird cocktail specialty) without having to commit to a full meal every time. I feel quite lucky to have this place just 2 blocks from my house.",5.0
"1st time here.  We had passed and read the menu some months ago and I wasn't impressed. But I checked today (my Bday!) and they have updated. and OMG! the beers were great , the food was delicious, and we felt comfy the whole time! And the music was even perfect. I will definitely be back.",5.0
So happy to see a restaurant in Bay Ridge that's not Italian or Middle Eastern.  The food was great!  I had the bacon wrapped dates: awesome!  I also had the brisket goulash.  Never had goulash before but yea...I will be going back for more.  It would have had a 5 star but the set up was a bit tight and it was really cold.  I will be back though!,4.0
"I really wanted to like this place. I live directly above it and would love a great restaurant so closeby. The first time we went I ordered the burger. I didn't like it. I wanted to give the place another try so we went back a couple months later. I don't even remember what we ordered but the food was very mediocre. Service was impeccable, I just thought the food was bland. Maybe we will try again.",3.0

"This place is small, and intimate with friendly service. Came here on a weekday night. There was no wait time to be seated. The food was delicious.

"*sigh* The hipsters have discovered Bay Ridge it seems...but that's okay, I suppose, because usually good restaurants follow (or the hipsters follow?  hmm)Bay Ridge has been lacking in new restaurants lately.  It seems like anything new that opens up is trying to live up to an already well established restaurant in the neighborhood (like the new Lebanese place across from Tanoreen, really?) and then they fail.I was surprised to see a farm-to-table restaurant with an eastern European theme open up.  In a sea of Italian restaurants, BBC seemed so out of place.  My husband and I decided to finally try it on a Sunday.  We had previously gone on a Friday or Saturday but the restaurant is very small and it was packed.  Sunday it was fairly empty and we were seated right away.I have to agree with everyone else that it seems crazy to have one guy running the whole show.  He's clearly never in a rush but I had to ask several times for water and our other drinks.  I think they need more than one guy taking care of business, I cannot imagine what it's like on a Saturday.Anyway, we skipped the appetizers and went straight for the food.  I had the chicken schnitzel and my husband ordered a trout special.  The chicken schnitzel was delicious, crispy but not dry, not overly flavorful but a splash of lemon juice takes care of that for me.  It was served with a warm pork belly potato salad that honestly was the star of the plate and also a green salad.  Everything was fresh and tasty.  I had a glass of the ugni blanc (I think it was called) and that was also delightful.My husband had the beet-tini and LOVED it (he loves drinks with weird flavorings).  His trout was fresh, HUGE, and cooked perfectly.  He found one bone in the whole piece but that's ok, he loved it so much.  It was served with a rice medley that I think they just created with whatever fresh veggies they had delivered.  I remember asparagus being in there but I was too into my pork belly potato salad.Overall, this is a lovely edition and a fun place to go to on a quiet evening.  Not sure I'd be so into it on a busy weekend night because the place is small and the tables are shared.  I can't wait to go again and try something on the special menu.",4.0

I'm giving it 2 stars - generous - but it has good ambience. I Went in for a drink tonight. I ordered a Manhattan Crown Royal. Something tasted...wrong. I don't think it was Crown. Plus it had froth and was shaken. My friend ordered a drink off the drink menu - a slo mo or something - basically it was tequila and overwhelming whiskey sour mix. Why is the waitress mixing? They were two really gross cocktails. I was hoping for some good mixology but apparently $19 doesn't get you good cocktails here. Disappointing. I may go back to try the food. Not sure yet.,2.0

"This place opened up in a spot that has some decent choices but many lack creativity, or perhaps I am easily bored. Anywho, this place gets 5 stars for luring into it's doors twice in the span of week. The setting is quaint with edison light bulbs, brick walls, large chalk board specials board, wood paneling. You can guess the scene, yet it also manages to have a very neighborhoody feel with bench style seating and a little walk up bar bench that is right on the sidewalk. I saw it and thought I want to be here with a group of six and a lot of wine! The place lists the local farm's at which it grabs it's fare and offers creative dishes, I can only think of one other place in this hood that varies it's menu on a weekly basis. First visit we had the fish and chips with their 5 sauces, and pulled pork perogi with beets and some greens.  Loved the fish and chips, big flaky fillet, perfectly crisp not so greasy batter and the sauces YUM. The horseradish cream, beet ketchup, and that homemade hot sauce really took the cake. We also had a couple cocktails which were creative and nice but I thought they could use a little more balancing. I will admit to being a complete cocktail enthusiast and snob and my review might be a little harsh I'd give them an 8 out of 10. Desserts, we tried 'em too and were satisfied with both the rhubarb crumble and the little chocolate thingys. Entrée's, a few drinks, 2 desserts and a fun little evening for well under $100 made me a happy girl!!Oh and did I mention brunch? We walked by on their first weekend of brunch service and could not resist. I had a delightful baked egg dish with ham, spinach, a few other amazing veggies, cream, a couple of perfectly cooked eggs. The mister got a pancake with a caramelized beet sugar topped with bacon, a thick wedge of ham, topped with 2 perfectly poached eggs. I had a bite and thought oh wow yum and he looked super satisfied. We ended up taking home a bottle of hot sauce and beet ketchup. Thanks guys! One small suggestion add a couple more appetizers or small plates so I can just pop in for an early glass (or 3) of wine and a small bite (or 2).",5.0
Our first time at Brooklyn Beet Company and we will definitely return. Great atmosphere and decor and the food was delicious. The burger was among the best I have ever had and the chicken schnitzel was delicious as well! All locally sourced and you can taste the freshness. Great drink selection and all reasonably priced. The only thing that let us down was the Creme Brûlée which was a little egg-y but overall definitely worthy of five stars. I am hopeful more places like this will start popping up in Bay Ridge but in the interim I look forwarding to frequenting this place and continuing to support local business!,5.0
"Awesome first impression! Hole in the wall little pub-style spot with great menu items, good beers and well made cocktails. Got brunch here and immediately said we needed to come back for dinner the same night. Definitely try the homemade dumplings and beet hot sauce/mustard/ketchup. The hash and polenta (separate dishes) were the table favorites.",5.0

"Went for dinner on a Friday night and back on Sunday for brunch. Great different cuisine, lovely fun atmosphere and very friendly staff. Had various entrees and appetizers and enjoyed them all (minor glitch on hangar steak which was a bit chewy). All freshly prepared and drinks were great with good selection of beer, wine, and cocktails. A welcome addition to the neighborhood. Highly recommend it. Just be ready for a bit of a wait for food but that makes it that more relaxing and commitment to fresh food preparation. #Enjoy",4.0

You can guess the scene, yet it also manages to have a very neighborhoody feel with bench style seating and a little walk up bar bench that is right on the sidewalk. I saw it and thought I want to be here with a group of six and a lot of wine! The place lists the local farm's at which it grabs it's fare and offers creative dishes, I can only think of one other place in this hood that varies it's menu on a weekly basis. First visit we had the fish and chips with their 5 sauces, and pulled pork perogi with beets and some greens.  Loved the fish and chips, big flaky fillet, perfectly crisp not so greasy batter and the sauces YUM. The horseradish cream, beet ketchup, and that homemade hot sauce really took the cake. We also had a couple cocktails which were creative and nice but I thought they could use a little more balancing. I will admit to being a complete cocktail enthusiast and snob and my review might be a little harsh I'd give them an 8 out of 10. Desserts, we tried 'em too and were satisfied with both the rhubarb crumble and the little chocolate thingys. Entrée's, a few drinks, 2 desserts and a fun little evening for well under $100 made me a happy girl!!Oh and did I mention brunch? We walked by on their first weekend of brunch service and could not resist. I had a delightful baked egg dish with ham, spinach, a few other amazing veggies, cream, a couple of perfectly cooked eggs. The mister got a pancake with a caramelized beet sugar topped with bacon, a thick wedge of ham, topped with 2 perfectly poached eggs. I had a bite and thought oh wow yum and he looked super satisfied. We ended up taking home a bottle of hot sauce and beet ketchup. Thanks guys! One small suggestion add a couple more appetizers or small plates so I can just pop in for an early glass (or 3) of wine and a small bite (or 2).",5.0
Our first time at Brooklyn Beet Company and we will definitely return. Great atmosphere and decor and the food was delicious. The burger was among the best I have ever had and the chicken schnitzel was delicious as well! All locally sourced and you can taste the freshness. Great drink selection and all reasonably priced. The only thing that let us down was the Creme Brûlée which was a little egg-y but overall definitely worthy of five stars. I am hopeful more places like this will start popping up in Bay Ridge but in the interim I look forwarding to frequenting this place and continuing to support local business!,5.0
"Awesome first impression! Hole in the wall little pub-style spot with great menu items, good beers and well made cocktails. Got brunch here and immediately said we needed to come back for dinner the same night. Definitely try the homemade dumplings and beet hot sauce/mustard/ketchup. The hash and polenta (separate dishes) were the table favorites.",5.0
"Great service! Delish food! Had the fish and chips and it was not heavily battered, just light and good. Can't wait to try out the brunch!",5.0
"Went for dinner on a Friday night and back on Sunday for brunch. Great different cuisine, lovely fun atmosphere and very friendly staff. Had various entrees and appetizers and enjoyed them all (minor glitch on hangar steak which was a bit chewy). All freshly prepared and drinks were great with good selection of beer, wine, and cocktails. A welcome addition to the neighborhood. Highly recommend it. Just be ready for a bit of a wait for food but that makes it that more relaxing and commitment to fresh food preparation. #Enjoy",4.0
