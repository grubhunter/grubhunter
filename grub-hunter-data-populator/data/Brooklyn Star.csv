"Food: We came for brunch and I have one word for this place ""Amazing!"" We ordered the shrimp and grits and also the pork chops. The shrimp was perfectly cooked and the grits was also. The pork chop was nice and thin, very tender and the breading was amazing. The decor is very chill and laid back and the staff friendly. This is my new brunch spot for sure. Brew: Great beers and cocktails, something for everyone.",5.0
"This place is junk food heaven on steroids. They have everything from mac & cheese, corn bread, to fried chicken and wings. The stand outs are definitely the fried chicken and duck wings - must haves on the menu. The bone marrow was super fatty if you're into fatty meat. We also enjoyed their beet salad. The premium steak was A-ok but nothing stellar.Service was great seeing how our table was for 15 people. The server was accommodating and was able to catch all of our orders and coursed out our dishes. Overall, this is a place where I would come once a year. It's not something I would miss, but someplace I can come too if I'm in the area looking for fried chicken/ wings pick me up.",3.0
"Came for brunch on a Sunday around 4 pm. Got a table right away, which was surprising because usally I hate brunch line ridiculousness. Me and my friend ordered michaelades, a kale salad, and shrimp and grits. The michaeladas were disgusting. The salt rim had no seasoning and the mixture itself lacked spice and taste besides tomato. I couldn't finish it, for 10$.The kale salad was teeny tiny, which is appropriate since it's salad. I'm glad they used baby kale so it was easy to chew, but again, lacked proper spicing. The raisons and nuts were a nice touch, but the small piece of crisp cheddar was tiny. For $11 it was overpriced. Finally, the shrimp and grits was, like the michaelada, unedible. The grits were lumpy like oatmeal that had been cooked on the stove too long, then reheated in the microwave. For $17, we just ate the 5 pieces of shrimp that came with it. The ""sauce"" was, like everything else, indistinguishable. The server was nice, however. I will definitely not return here.",2.0
"OMG THE DUCK WINGSSSSSS ok ok i'll calm down here.  Came to the Brooklyn Star on a Saturday night around 8pm no reservations but was seated within 10 minutes!  Started with the biscuits which were perfectly warmed and served with butter and honey on the side YUMMMM.  Next had the fried brussel sprouts OMG cooked perfectly nice and crispy and chopped up like a salad.  Next we had the Spicy fried duck wings which I had read about previously and omg THEY WERE SO GOOD, the meat fell right off the bone and the sauce made with ground chili, honey, Coca Cola, fried garlic. Last but not least the roasted chicken was also cooked to perfection, and a HUGE portion could split between 2-3 people for sure.  I loved the atmosphere, and they serve family style which was nice.  The service was also so good and waiter super attentive.  I would definately recommend if you are in the area.",5.0
"A brunchtime mecca that's surely always going to be a madhouse as long as they're doling out food this good.  Yes, the wait time is a bit of a bummer.  But all that angst will fade away the minute you're presented with a steaming skillet of homemade bacon mac & cheese.  A HUGE skillet for that matter, which can definitely be shared, and is crazily reasonably prices.   The vibe in here is cozy hipster chic, with lots of wood paneling and drinks served up in mason jars.  And it's one of those menus that will leave you flummoxed about what to choose, and immediately anxious to come back to sample even more of the offerings.",4.0
"ahhh... food is on point here; I don't even know where to begin. We started off with the cornbread and mac n' cheese to share along with some cocktails and beers. I've been here a few times and both times had wonderful experiences (except the wait time of course). Service is excellent, food is delish, and drinks were on point. Their country fried steak is cooked perfectly; super tender and juicy; also big enough to share. I'd def. come back here again when I'm out in the area!",5.0
"I think this may be my favorite brunch in Brooklyn. That's saying a lot, because Brooklyn is basically made for brunching. And to deem one the best...well, that's not something I take lightly.Since everyone seems to agree with me here, I'll just offer up some suggestions: The flapjacks are sinful, and the chicken n waffles are the holy grail of bread + bird. And the cinnamon roll is an absolute must, it's so sugary and delicious that I walked out with a childlike grin on my face.Now I just need to go for dinner, where I'm sure everything is just as good.",5.0
"Dear Yelp gods,Thank you for letting me find this place on a random Saturday night. I was in the mood for the best eats in town and this place exceeding my palate's expectations. Amen!Suggestions: Everyone at the table order these things and share amongst each other. Portions are generous.-The Mac and cheese-- probably the best I've ever had! baked to perfection, cheesy, and flavorful. You can definitely share this with 2-3 people -Spicy Duck wings-- Duck really tasted like a more tender chicken, 7 drumsticks pieces which are huge, the sauce on the wings were mind-blowing (like maybe sweet and sour plus hot sauce?!)-The biscuits-- 3 in each basket, I usually love Red Lobster's biscuits (laced with crack), BUT THIS ONE will put Red Lobster's biscuits to shame. The butter melted on top of the hot biscuits added to the savory taste.-Meatloaf sandwich--COLOSSIAL in size, had multiple ingredients in the sammich, taste was on point.-Cornbread with jalapeños and bacon bits- nice size, amazing when hot and freshly brought to the table.-The MAC AND CHEESE--oh I've already mentioned it already right?? Well worth mentioning again. You can't go wrong with this and spicy duck wings!-The kool-aid is also legit! It's like authentic kool-aid, made by what appears to me by a southern woman named Mabel (or at least it should be because it's so damn good). We all ordered two, some of us brought shots of bacardi and mixed it!Bill for 6 people which also included cocktails, the spicy chili (which wasn't that good so I don't recommend it), came up to $170!Follow my suggestions and you can't go wrong..this place blows minds!",5.0
"Brooklyn Star is a nice little gem in Brooklyn. It's definitely not fancy & had an old feel but it was cool. I went on a Sunday for brunch & the food was good  The only thing that I disliked was the fact that they don't offer bottomless mimosas. Their mimosas are $10 per glass & $38 for a pitcher. Food: Was good. I had the chicken & waffles. The chicken could've had a little more flavor but it wasn't something that hot sauce couldn't fix. The waffle was on point & they serve it w/ grapefruit on the side. I also had a side of eggs over easy & ordered the bacon mac & cheese to go which was also good but tasted a little burnt.Drinks: Just the typical mimosa, nothing special.Customer Service: The host was nice & friendly. The waitress however clearly doesn't know what it is to smile. Didn't get her name, however she has short brown hair & wore it half up in a bun & half down. She wasn't nearly as inviting as the host. Never came to check up on us either. Also had a slight attitude because we wanted to change an order literally 2 mins after we placed it.",4.0
"WINNER, WINNER, FRIED CHICKEN DINNER! This place is a true gem in the borough. They had me hooked at the first bite of biscuit...they give you soft butter and honey to go with it. So amazing. My friend and I joined for brunch on a Sunday around 2pm-- there was a 20 min wait, but well worth it. In fact, when is there not a wait for brunch? The tasty food makes me wonder why the wait wasn't LONGER.We had the Shrimp & Grits; a perfect go-to that's hard to mess up. Since this was our first time, we decided to make a sure bet. DEF going back this weekend for 2nds and trying something new :)Almost just as important as the food....the staff! Super friendly hostess who actually SMILED (some of ya'll really let the guests know how much you loathe your job) and a server who kept our glasses full and was generous with the biscuits!I'm telling you ....THE BISCUITS!!Overall, very, very pleased-- and I would certainly recommend a visit for brunch or dinner.",5.0
"Brooklyn Star is always a sleeper hit at food festivals. The first time I tried their chicken and waffle cone was at Roberta's Block Party, so I had to try something different this time around.I settled on the fried duck wings.

Ten!They are perfectly crispy, and come with a side of duck sauce and fried garlic to pour on top.

"Shout-out to the CHEF at Brooklyn Star! I was super hungry on a Saturday morning at 1:00 AM and wanted good quality food. I yelped Brooklyn Star at the last minute and decided to give it a try.Brooklyn Star is located in Williamsburg so the vibe is very hipster, with a rustic ambiance. The lights were dim and we were able to grab a table within 5 minutes. The late night menu consisted of oysters, 6 for $18.00, Country fried steak with mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, and various other eats that would make your mouth water! I wanted to try the biscuits first, which were soft, fluffy and absolutely delicious. The mac and cheese was cooked to perfection with a tasty crust on the top...just the way I like it! What I love about this place is that the meals are of large proportions. The country fried steak came with TWO pieces of fried steak and drenched in mashed potatoes. It was absolutely amazing...I also had enough for left overs lol. If you are an oyster fan like myself, you will love the oysters because they are fresh, not overly salty, and delicious. I also wanted to mention that Brooklyn Star serves cherry kool-aide for $1.00!!! I haven't had kool-aide in such a long time, but I couldn't resist.Brooklyn Star is such a great restaurant and I would highly recommend anyone to give them a try, especially if you are in the mood for great food!",5.0

we had dinner last night at Brooklyn star - we ordered the t-bone for 3-4 people and asked for it medium rare and she told us it would take 45 minutes to an hour.  We told her we were ok for rare also and she said it would still take an 45 minutes or so.  So we ordered appetizers and waited patiently - the apps were great (mac and cheese and wings) however the meat came and it was cold! even the grease on it was cold - We eat and prepare rare meat all the time  - and the inside is never hot but the outside should be seared and served hot for sure - really ruined the experience for me - and it was super expensive !,2.0

I'm so tired of all the same kinds of dishes in Brooklyn, but this dish is just yummy. The sauce is tart and juicy (a light barbecue sauce) then peppered with ham hock.

A few minutes later we got hit with the entrees. The hot meat loaf was amazing, mixed with a hot slaw between two perfectly fresh piece of bread.

The GF's mac n cheese was less transcendent but still a great example of mac, with a awesome crispy crust on top. Other than the food the bartender was cheery, and the atmosphere was that old timey wood feel that a lot of bars seem to be going for these days.

"This place is great! Really good Southern fare with a bit of a modern twist. My only gripe about this place is that there is only one entree on this entire menu for a vegetarian. Yes, I know most southern food is meat based, but we live in NYC where vegans and vegetarians are everywhere. Challenge yourself to make delicious southern food that vegetarians can eat! It exists! I've had it! With that being said, my husband ordered the brick cooked chicken and loved it. It finished everything on his plate. He said the chicken was cooked perfectly. I ordered the kale salad which was fresh and delicious. We also split the cornbread, which was a bit tasteless but good. I ordered one of their cocktails and it was mixed perfectly. This is a great spot for southern food, they just need to expand their menu a bit!",4.0
"If you in any way are craving southern food, you must come here.It's not easy to find good quality southern cuisine in New York, but Brooklyn Star has all of the classics down - and it shows. We walked in at about 6pm on a Saturday for dinner and the placed managed to get completely filled within 30 minutes of us being there. Good timing!The tables are set just so with mason jars for drinks - a more upscale but down-home feel. My boyfriend was craving country fried steak, while I went for the fried pig tails and buttermlk biscuits. The chicken fried steak portion was huge, and the steak was perfectly crispy. Although you may be hesitant to order the pigtails (as was I), go for it. They're very flavorful and covered in barbeque sauce. The real stars here, though, were the biscuits. I can't say I have had a better biscuit in my life...so fluffy, buttery, and fresh. To give you an even better on idea on how good they were, we took the last one to go. They were just that good. If you find yourself in Williamsburg, don't pass up the opportunity to try the Brooklyn Star!",5.0
"Brooklyn Star is excellent! Yes, it is quite expensive, but the inventive Southern-influenced dishes more than make up for it. The restaurant is spacious and dimly lit, with wooden tables and (occasionally overly) attentive staff. Both the ""small"" and ""big"" dishes are quite large, so I suggest ordering a variety of dishes and sharing everything. To start, we began with the fried brussel sprouts, duck wings, and mac n cheese. The fried brussel sprouts were delightful: crispy, nicely marinated, and paired well with the cooked hams. Not to go too NYTimes on this, but the duck wings were a REVELATION. I had no idea you could cook duck as a wing and still preserve the textures (i.e., crispy skin, juicy meat). Also exceptional was the mac n cheese. Yes, I was skeptical too - like burgers, every restaurant claims their mac and cheese is great. But the gooey mix of quesos, crunchy breading on top, and last but not least, crispy diced bacon made this a standout. Most joints put thick, limp bacon in their mac - not Brooklyn Star!Now to the main: sweet tea braised chicken with dirty rice and Chinese broccoli. Already the juiciness of the chicken made this A+, but on top of that was the distinctive sweet, but savory marinade. The dirty rice with sausage and chicken liver was also quite good, and made for a meaty accompaniment. And the Chinese broccoli certainly served its vegetable purpose.However, do be warned that a meal - appetizer, main, and drink - will easily run you $30-40, so this is not for the faint of financial heart. But if you're down for a lovely Southern-influenced dinner in Williamsburg, then game on.",5.0
Omg this place was amazing!!!!! I've never had better mac and cheese in my life.  I'm still craving those biscuits.  Someone in our party ordered the bone marrow and it was interesting and delicious.   I loved the duck wings and the country fried steak was so yummy.  I just wish I had more room in my belly but I was very full.  The portions are very family-style.  Drinks were delicious and our server was just the right amount of attentive.  I'll definitely be making a trip back!,5.0
"Another place in Brooklyn for some great late night eats. It's a really laid back atmosphere and I usually just sit at the bar and order from there.  Other than the bar, they also have bench seating. The food at Brooklyn Star is really exceptional. I would classify it as comfort food, well at least the items that I ordered off the menu. I had the country fried steak served with mashed potatoes, bacon and hot slaw as well as the Mac and Cheese with Bacon. I also had the buttermilk biscuits. Everything was so delicious! The country fried steak was cooked perfectly. The biscuits were my favorite. I couldn't stop eating them. They were so buttery and flaky!! Since I was sitting at the bar, I ordered a spicy margarita, which was tequila, serrano infused agave syrup, lime and grapefruit. It was a solid cocktail. I will definitely be returning to try more menu items!!",4.0
"Next time I'm going to wait right at noon when they open cos apparently when you're 15 minutes before noon, you're too early! So instead of getting all our food and then getting a spot on the beach, we got a spot first which was a long, tiring walk in the sand to go back and forth to. When we went, the lines for every eatery was super long except for The Brooklyn Star. Their fried chicken and waffle cone did smell good, so it was pretty worth it. The staff behind the counter were also nice. Price is a wee bit much for just a waffle cone with coleslaw and chicken nuggets drizzled with Sri Racha sauce and honey. The cone was a unique addition. It tasted like it was made with some cheddar cheese in it. It was pretty good though. The whole row of restaurants felt like a smaller version of Smorgasburg - the high prices, and the long lines! Might as well bring your own food next time.",2.0
"Came here late Saturday night! The food was so amazing! We got the Brussels, Mac and cheese with bacon, the jalapeño cornbread, and the trout!

Also- they have kool aid. Done and done.",5.0
"***3.5 Stars***Real good.Real friendly.Real chill. Real laid back.I felt the down south atmosphere here at Brooklyn Star. I had the family combo deal ($20 bucks). It came with southern style fried chicken, a whole bunch of sides.  Cole slaw,grits,mash potatoes,collard greens,bacon cornbread,that so delish mac and cheese,oh gwad. I absolutely love Brooklyn Star.  The chicken was good,a tad bit dry,but passable, especially when drizzled or doused in ranch dressing. The bacon cornbread was good,wished it had more bacony crunchiness, the collard greens were real good,and I didn't get that straight outta of a Green Giant can taste,fresh and actually pretty darn good. The cole slaw was not that impressive and the grits were more of an afterthought, but great the next day for breakfast.  Brooklyn Star, I heart you and the Chuck Norris posters.",3.0
"Started with a couple drafts beers, glass and beer perfect temperature making rings down the glass as we enjoyed the scene until 6 pm when the kitchen opened.  The friendly staff took our order right away, we had the fried Brussels sports so yummy that raspberry chipotle sauce and the ham was a pleasant surprise.   I enjoyed the gorditas my main dish it was perfect I've never had anything like them the lamb was superb moist and the flavors exceeded all expectations.  Dish two was the trout wasn't my meal but I had a few bites, and would order it for myself very smoky, just right.   The entire vibe of the restaurant was cool.  Not trendy or cliché but still cool af.",5.0
"Amazing food, amazing staff & awesome company = one hell of an amazing time.DO the spicy duck drumsticks, mac & cheese, the pork chop, the meatloaf sandwich (especially the meatloaf sandwich!).

"This place is great! Really good Southern fare with a bit of a modern twist. My only gripe about this place is that there is only one entree on this entire menu for a vegetarian. Yes, I know most southern food is meat based, but we live in NYC where vegans and vegetarians are everywhere. Challenge yourself to make delicious southern food that vegetarians can eat! It exists! I've had it! With that being said, my husband ordered the brick cooked chicken and loved it. It finished everything on his plate. He said the chicken was cooked perfectly. I ordered the kale salad which was fresh and delicious. We also split the cornbread, which was a bit tasteless but good. I ordered one of their cocktails and it was mixed perfectly. This is a great spot for southern food, they just need to expand their menu a bit!",4.0
"If you in any way are craving southern food, you must come here.It's not easy to find good quality southern cuisine in New York, but Brooklyn Star has all of the classics down - and it shows. We walked in at about 6pm on a Saturday for dinner and the placed managed to get completely filled within 30 minutes of us being there. Good timing!The tables are set just so with mason jars for drinks - a more upscale but down-home feel. My boyfriend was craving country fried steak, while I went for the fried pig tails and buttermlk biscuits. The chicken fried steak portion was huge, and the steak was perfectly crispy. Although you may be hesitant to order the pigtails (as was I), go for it. They're very flavorful and covered in barbeque sauce. The real stars here, though, were the biscuits. I can't say I have had a better biscuit in my life...so fluffy, buttery, and fresh. To give you an even better on idea on how good they were, we took the last one to go. They were just that good. If you find yourself in Williamsburg, don't pass up the opportunity to try the Brooklyn Star!",5.0
"Brooklyn Star is excellent! Yes, it is quite expensive, but the inventive Southern-influenced dishes more than make up for it. The restaurant is spacious and dimly lit, with wooden tables and (occasionally overly) attentive staff. Both the ""small"" and ""big"" dishes are quite large, so I suggest ordering a variety of dishes and sharing everything. To start, we began with the fried brussel sprouts, duck wings, and mac n cheese. The fried brussel sprouts were delightful: crispy, nicely marinated, and paired well with the cooked hams. Not to go too NYTimes on this, but the duck wings were a REVELATION. I had no idea you could cook duck as a wing and still preserve the textures (i.e., crispy skin, juicy meat). Also exceptional was the mac n cheese. Yes, I was skeptical too - like burgers, every restaurant claims their mac and cheese is great. But the gooey mix of quesos, crunchy breading on top, and last but not least, crispy diced bacon made this a standout. Most joints put thick, limp bacon in their mac - not Brooklyn Star!Now to the main: sweet tea braised chicken with dirty rice and Chinese broccoli. Already the juiciness of the chicken made this A+, but on top of that was the distinctive sweet, but savory marinade. The dirty rice with sausage and chicken liver was also quite good, and made for a meaty accompaniment. And the Chinese broccoli certainly served its vegetable purpose.However, do be warned that a meal - appetizer, main, and drink - will easily run you $30-40, so this is not for the faint of financial heart. But if you're down for a lovely Southern-influenced dinner in Williamsburg, then game on.",5.0
Omg this place was amazing!!!!! I've never had better mac and cheese in my life.  I'm still craving those biscuits.  Someone in our party ordered the bone marrow and it was interesting and delicious.   I loved the duck wings and the country fried steak was so yummy.  I just wish I had more room in my belly but I was very full.  The portions are very family-style.  Drinks were delicious and our server was just the right amount of attentive.  I'll definitely be making a trip back!,5.0
"Another place in Brooklyn for some great late night eats. It's a really laid back atmosphere and I usually just sit at the bar and order from there.  Other than the bar, they also have bench seating. The food at Brooklyn Star is really exceptional. I would classify it as comfort food, well at least the items that I ordered off the menu. I had the country fried steak served with mashed potatoes, bacon and hot slaw as well as the Mac and Cheese with Bacon. I also had the buttermilk biscuits. Everything was so delicious! The country fried steak was cooked perfectly. The biscuits were my favorite. I couldn't stop eating them. They were so buttery and flaky!! Since I was sitting at the bar, I ordered a spicy margarita, which was tequila, serrano infused agave syrup, lime and grapefruit. It was a solid cocktail. I will definitely be returning to try more menu items!!",4.0
"Next time I'm going to wait right at noon when they open cos apparently when you're 15 minutes before noon, you're too early! So instead of getting all our food and then getting a spot on the beach, we got a spot first which was a long, tiring walk in the sand to go back and forth to. When we went, the lines for every eatery was super long except for The Brooklyn Star. Their fried chicken and waffle cone did smell good, so it was pretty worth it. The staff behind the counter were also nice. Price is a wee bit much for just a waffle cone with coleslaw and chicken nuggets drizzled with Sri Racha sauce and honey. The cone was a unique addition. It tasted like it was made with some cheddar cheese in it. It was pretty good though. The whole row of restaurants felt like a smaller version of Smorgasburg - the high prices, and the long lines! Might as well bring your own food next time.",2.0
"Came here late Saturday night! The food was so amazing! We got the Brussels, Mac and cheese with bacon, the jalapeño cornbread, and the trout! It was way too much for two people but I can't complain about leftovers! I got a cocktail as well- can't recall the name but something mezcal and had egg whites! It was phenomenal! Also- they have kool aid. Done and done.",5.0
"***3.5 Stars***Real good.Real friendly.Real chill. Real laid back.I felt the down south atmosphere here at Brooklyn Star. I had the family combo deal ($20 bucks). It came with southern style fried chicken, a whole bunch of sides.  Cole slaw,grits,mash potatoes,collard greens,bacon cornbread,that so delish mac and cheese,oh gwad. I absolutely love Brooklyn Star.  The chicken was good,a tad bit dry,but passable, especially when drizzled or doused in ranch dressing. The bacon cornbread was good,wished it had more bacony crunchiness, the collard greens were real good,and I didn't get that straight outta of a Green Giant can taste,fresh and actually pretty darn good. The cole slaw was not that impressive and the grits were more of an afterthought, but great the next day for breakfast.  Brooklyn Star, I heart you and the Chuck Norris posters.",3.0
"Started with a couple drafts beers, glass and beer perfect temperature making rings down the glass as we enjoyed the scene until 6 pm when the kitchen opened.  The friendly staff took our order right away, we had the fried Brussels sports so yummy that raspberry chipotle sauce and the ham was a pleasant surprise.   I enjoyed the gorditas my main dish it was perfect I've never had anything like them the lamb was superb moist and the flavors exceeded all expectations.  Dish two was the trout wasn't my meal but I had a few bites, and would order it for myself very smoky, just right.   The entire vibe of the restaurant was cool.  Not trendy or cliché but still cool af.",5.0

"Good.We came in right when it opened on Father's Day, and had no issue getting a table without a reservation. Though, we must have timed it right, because shortly after, there was a 30 minute wait.  -Texas toast ($4): good. They give you two pieces of lightly buttered, garlic toast with a side of butter. The waitress also gave us honey to spread on the toast, but we didn't try it. Seemedr odd. -Mac and cheese with bacon ($9): good. The mac and cheese didn't look like much, but it's plenty considering how rich it is. This mac and cheese is baked creating a nice crust, and they were very generous with the bacon. I wish the bacon used was a combination of soft and crispy vs just crispy, but I know that's a matter of preference. Also, I wish this dish was slightly creamier. I like my baked mac and cheese to have a nice cheesy crust, but to have a slight wet, creamy center. -Scottish salmon ($14): pretty good. The fresh salmon over arugula, with creamed eggs, salmon roe, and toast. I thought this dish was really good for the most part. I wish they would have used a little more salmon roe, or salted the eggs some, because the dish was a little bland if I made a bite without the roe. Also, I wish the toast was slightly more toasted or given to me on a separate plate. Because the toast came on the plate, some of the pieces got soggy. -Kool-aid ($1): great, because it's kool-aid! It's punch flavored with the right amount of sweet. Overall, we liked this place. The place is really bright, clean, and inviting. The employees were also really friendly and nice. And the prices are great for the amount and quality of food you get. What we liked most about this place, is the size. They have two entrances: one for the restaurant, and one for the bar. The one for the bar has a ramp which is awesome if you have to deal with a stroller and/or wheelchair. Once inside, the tables are nicely spaced apart, so you won't have to worry about bumping into people. And the booths are huge. This is a great place to come in larger groups, or with your family. Nice noise level. They accept credit cards.",4.0

That's some dedication! But it was a very quick turnaround, and I was impressed with the attentiveness of the waiters and the quality of the food. They really know what they're doing! The brunch cocktails are very good and I always go for the Texas toast. Yum!DINNER: I went this past Sunday for dinner with my boyfriend and was seated, when we wanted to switch seats, they were very accommodating! However, the first thing we noticed was that the inside of the restaurant was not that much cooler than the outside summer heat. Yikes. Soon after, I stated to cool off with some water and the promise of food. We ordered the Bone Marrow and Texas Toast as appetizers, my boyfriend got the Country Fried Steak, and I got the Sweet Tea Glazed Brick-Pressed Chicken. The Bone Marrow was DELICIOUS. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to be more of a venturous eater but is still wary of what they eat. It's two halves of a huge bone (don't know what bone it was), but the inside is perfectly grilled or charred or something, and it's buttery--it comes with 8 pieces of toast (I think we accidentally ordered too much toast, whoops! But yay to more carbs.), some jellied radish thing(?), salt, and two marrow scooper-spoon things for easier access and highly efficient marrow scooping! It was delicious, savory and a really cool experience. I'd say you should order this if you're out with friends or a date who isn't vegetarian or vegan, or gluten free, and you can easily impress them.The Texas toast, as per usual, was amazing and crispy. I couldn't stop myself from eating more slices, even though I'd just had marrow-toast-jelly. (My mouth is watering just thinking about this now.)The chicken was piping hot when it came out, incredibly juicy and fall-off-the-bone. I'd never had chicken so good! (Not kidding.) Chicken at restaurants is usually dry and hard to do well, but this glaze was also incredible. It was like teriyaki but way more wholesome, and the summer squash that came with it was also delicious! So yummy. I really recommend this to anyone who wants to get a lighter dish (I use the word 'lighter' very generally, because there weren't that many carbs in this specific dish, compared to the slew of toast I'd just chowed down on). I didn't try the country fried steak, but it looked really scrumptious, and my boyfriend pretty much finished the entire plate, so he had a good time with it! The only thing that concerned me and kept me from giving this place the full 5 star treatment, was the fact that I was sweating through my entire meal. Both my boyfriend and I. It was incredibly hot, and very little ventilation. For a few moments, I thought that I was almost in the subway--you know when you're waiting on the platform for your train, and a different train passes by but you don't even care that it's not your train because it was so humid and hot and the movement of the train made a slightly-cooler breeze pass around you? It was like that, but every time a waiter or busboy passed by. I was sweating so much that I actually used more napkins for my face than the food. Ew, I know. Why isn't there more air conditioning?! TL;DR: come here for the awesome food, but wear as little and airy clothing as possible so you don't have a simultaneous shower.",4.0

"I came here for Sunday brunch with my boyfriend. We've been wanting a southern brunch meal for a while now. During my research of restaurants, I came across this restaurant. It has a contemporary, rustic ambience. Very well kept as well. We were able to be seated right away and actually had the option of picking our table. The staff was so inviting and seemed to enjoy their jobs.The meal itself is simple, self-explanatory. So I ordered the fried pork chop and he originally ordered the blueberry Johnny cakes. We split the mac and cheese, which was cheesy and made to perfection. It came in a cute little skillet and the bacon inside was the perfect touch. ( perfect for sharing ). My fried pork was so delicious and tasted so fresh, perfect crispness and not fatty. I opted for scrambled as instead of the fried eggs. FYI, they'll accommodate food request like that as long as it's not busy which is totally understandable.  Unfortunately for my boyfriend, the Johnny cakes wasn't his cup of tea because it's made out of a wheat flour/cornmeal like base and he's not a fan of that. So he opted for the fried pork chop.Why may ask why I gave 5 stars. That is because when my boyfriend expressed to our waitress his dissatisfaction of his meal. She proceeded to not only agree to opt his meal for another but also ask if he could just give her feedback on why exactly he wasn't satisfied with his meal so that management can be aware of what the customers like and don't like. I really wish I got her name because those gestures are the epitome of great customer service. So that alone made my experience that much better and we will definitely be back to try their dinner meal, which our waitress expressed was what they are known for.So in conclusion, if you're in the area, please give this restaurant a try. You definitely will not regret it at all!!",5.0

Like I said carb heaven. Our food came out very quickly and we were more than satisfied. My boyfriend's chicken n waffles came with grapefruit which I thought was weird but he loved it. It was grilled with a little bit of sugar on it we also got the Bloody Bull, good, not great. Our waitress was super attentive, even tho it was so busy.

I loved the menu, the food was delicious, the interior was cozy and offered a great atmosphere. I haven't been back for brunch yet only because I haven't actually been in Brooklyn on a Saturday or a Sunday since I moved here. But you can bet it will be one of the first places I go, especially after looking at that menu. Their classic chicken fried steak with potatoes is the bomb, it's tender and juicy and a bit heavenly in your mouth. We also tried a watermelon feta salad that they had at that time and it was as flavorful as it was refreshing. This was an early indicator that I was going to fall in love with New York (and gain 20 pounds).",5.0

I really recommend this to anyone who wants to get a lighter dish (I use the word 'lighter' very generally, because there weren't that many carbs in this specific dish, compared to the slew of toast I'd just chowed down on). I didn't try the country fried steak, but it looked really scrumptious, and my boyfriend pretty much finished the entire plate, so he had a good time with it! The only thing that concerned me and kept me from giving this place the full 5 star treatment, was the fact that I was sweating through my entire meal. Both my boyfriend and I. It was incredibly hot, and very little ventilation. For a few moments, I thought that I was almost in the subway--you know when you're waiting on the platform for your train, and a different train passes by but you don't even care that it's not your train because it was so humid and hot and the movement of the train made a slightly-cooler breeze pass around you? It was like that, but every time a waiter or busboy passed by. I was sweating so much that I actually used more napkins for my face than the food. Ew, I know. Why isn't there more air conditioning?! TL;DR: come here for the awesome food, but wear as little and airy clothing as possible so you don't have a simultaneous shower.",4.0
"This place is amazing. The food is absolutely delicious. The cornbread and biscuits are so magnificent you will want to come here every day. Last time I visited, I got one of the salads and it was the most flavorful salad I've ever had. Good drinks, too. You can't go wrong at Brooklyn Star.",5.0
"I wanted to try this place a while ago but never had the chance.  My roommate farewell dinner was in this restaurant and it was surprisingly good.  Well, it is not the most healthy food (bc it is southern) but the duck was very tasty. I did not try the chocolate pudding but it looks very heavy and according to some of the group , the bacon mac and cheese was the opposite of light. I believe this is a good address for me ONLY FOR WINTER.",4.0
"I came here for Sunday brunch with my boyfriend. We've been wanting a southern brunch meal for a while now. During my research of restaurants, I came across this restaurant. It has a contemporary, rustic ambience. Very well kept as well. We were able to be seated right away and actually had the option of picking our table. The staff was so inviting and seemed to enjoy their jobs.The meal itself is simple, self-explanatory. So I ordered the fried pork chop and he originally ordered the blueberry Johnny cakes. We split the mac and cheese, which was cheesy and made to perfection. It came in a cute little skillet and the bacon inside was the perfect touch. ( perfect for sharing ). My fried pork was so delicious and tasted so fresh, perfect crispness and not fatty. I opted for scrambled as instead of the fried eggs. FYI, they'll accommodate food request like that as long as it's not busy which is totally understandable.  Unfortunately for my boyfriend, the Johnny cakes wasn't his cup of tea because it's made out of a wheat flour/cornmeal like base and he's not a fan of that. So he opted for the fried pork chop.Why may ask why I gave 5 stars. That is because when my boyfriend expressed to our waitress his dissatisfaction of his meal. She proceeded to not only agree to opt his meal for another but also ask if he could just give her feedback on why exactly he wasn't satisfied with his meal so that management can be aware of what the customers like and don't like. I really wish I got her name because those gestures are the epitome of great customer service. So that alone made my experience that much better and we will definitely be back to try their dinner meal, which our waitress expressed was what they are known for.So in conclusion, if you're in the area, please give this restaurant a try. You definitely will not regret it at all!!",5.0
"This place is basically carb heaven! With the best biscuits in Brooklyn this place is a must stop. We came here for brunch early one morning. We got there 15 minutes after they opened and the place was already packed. This a very popular spot, get there early. It was super hot that day, so we down our waters pretty quickly.The sever was always there with another, like magic.We got biscuits and gravy and the chicken and waffles with that biscuit side. Like I said carb heaven. Our food came out very quickly and we were more than satisfied. My boyfriend's chicken n waffles came with grapefruit which I thought was weird but he loved it. It was grilled with a little bit of sugar on it we also got the Bloody Bull, good, not great. Our waitress was super attentive, even tho it was so busy. This place is great and I can understand why there was a line when we left.",4.0
"Local Bar, nice window seat and inside is relaxed restaurant table space. The bartender is okay friendly, more of relaxed bar with mid 30s main costumers. I prefer this kind of bar less noisy not too loud but still not too quiet. Located off the main street so that is plus too. The pricing for drinks here is set in very friendly range I think. If living in this area, it is a nice casual spot to come at night.",3.0
"Brooklyn Star was one of the first places I went to in Brooklyn (went for dinner) and I loved everything about it. I loved the menu, the food was delicious, the interior was cozy and offered a great atmosphere. I haven't been back for brunch yet only because I haven't actually been in Brooklyn on a Saturday or a Sunday since I moved here. But you can bet it will be one of the first places I go, especially after looking at that menu. Their classic chicken fried steak with potatoes is the bomb, it's tender and juicy and a bit heavenly in your mouth. We also tried a watermelon feta salad that they had at that time and it was as flavorful as it was refreshing. This was an early indicator that I was going to fall in love with New York (and gain 20 pounds).",5.0

"I thought this place was just average. Let's start off with the pros. The texas toast and muffins are the best!! If it's too much bread for the table and you don't want to stuff yourself with carbs before your actual meal comes out then I recommend getting just the toast. It came out warm and tasty! Oh and I love their butter. We also had the Cinnamon bun which was good too. The mac and cheese was okay, I've definitely had better. I think it could be cheesier. There's really no cons. My bf and I had the chicken and waffles and meatloaf sandwich. It was just okay. We agreed that we have had our good shares of chicken and waffles. The meatloaf Sandwich didn't blow me away. I had all the bread/carbs and was only able to take 2-3 bites of my sandwich and couldn't finish anymore.Oh and we came across an experience that made me dislike the business practice. We made reservations for 8 on Sunday and most of our parties had already arrive (7 out of 8) instead of letting us sit. The lady said we have to wait till everyone is here. The place is not big and to have 7 people stand around waiting is stupid. She even tells us to move aside at one point so the servers can pass by with the food. Uh? Hello, if u had sat us. This whole situation could have been avoided. Would have given 3 stars and then after typing this unpleasant experience, i decided to take away a star.",2.0
"Amazing food and excellent service! The mac and cheese is a must! Try it with bacon and you're in heaven! Oh so creamy and yummy.  They are very generous with their portions.

"My favorite brunch in williamsburg (ok maybe tied with Pies and Thighs), I love this place. Even though there are so many yummy options- I have a hard time NOT ordering the fried chicken and waffles when I'm there. It's great chicken (and I'm from the deep south!), and a perfect combination of sweet, salty and spicy (with their hot sauce). Plus BK Star always puts an interesting twist on things. Like grapefruit with your waffles or meat juice in your bloody mary (trust me, sounds gross, tastes amaze). Ambiance and service are nice. But if you're going there on the weekend, line up at or before 12 noon when they open to make sure you get in. Otherwise wait another hour for tables to turn over.",5.0
"Brooklyn Star does not mess around. Come hungry and be prepared to leave happy and full. I came here with a group of four on a Friday night, well into dinner time. We were told of the wait in the back, but found a table upfront in the bar area instead. We started off with the oysters and an order of biscuits, then dove into a bunch of shared plates: mac and cheese, the duck wings, and the bone marrow. This was my first time eating bone marrow and it was prepared well. The wings were my favorite, loved the seasoning. I'm pretty sure I licked my fingers clean. The mac and cheese was rich and big enough for two. I washed it all down with a spicy margarita which was indeed spicy, but not painfully so. The atmosphere in the front was lively, probably due to it being Friday. Our waitress was great and had no problem with a few of our substitutions. Great for a well fed night out!",5.0
"Great classic brunch. The chicken and waffles are to die for and the Cuban Torta is the business, I wanted to snatch it out of my husband's hands. This is a great place, good lighting, nice crowd, no craziness. The staff were polite and the food did not take long to come out at all. Even though I had the chicken, I started with the yogurt and it was presented in such a pretty way. The house granola is awesome. I loved it here, definitely going again.",4.0

"Cool bar area, reasonably priced beers but I honestly expected a lot more from this place. I guess I set the bar high because it is located so close to me and so desperately wanted to be a regular But the food is ok and rather expensive, and every time I wonder why I don't go there as often as I thought I would I just eat there again and am remindedI definitely do not want to deter anyone from going there with this review. I think that they have a wide following and the staff is very nice. I personally like it more for drinking than eating I will be back and I will find something on the menu that will keep me coming back",3.0
"I really loved the Brooklyn Star.  I got a quail special which was delicious and the oyster appetizer.  The oysters were great, with a smokey bbq viniagrette.  Very unusual and I liked it a lot (though oyster purists might not love it).  The biscuits were great, excellent meatloaf and the chicken fried steak was very good too.  Mashed potatoes were excellent.Great place to bring kids with plenty of space (the restaurant is deceptively big). The cocktails were also quite delicious.",5.0

"Slipped into Brooklyn Star for brunch with zero expectations. I thought the layout was cool, and the bench seating was a good touch. Everyone was incredibly helpful and friendly. For my order I got the meatloaf sandwich which was made with ham and topped with the fried egg on thick cut bread. When it came out they made a smiley face in the sunny side up egg with dabs of hot sauce which was a pretty cool touch to a flavorfully delicious sandwich . It came with house made chips that were seasoned perfectly.After all of that food I still decided to order the cast-iron skillet cinnamon bun (thanks to the couple next to me that got it first). I was stuffed but still had to have one. Shout out to whoever thought about adding that to the menu.

"Cute place with yummy comfort (aka heart attack) food, and even though it looks tiny when you walk in, there's a spacious back room. The menu as all the comfort food you could possibly wish for! Six of us went on Saturday night for a friend's birthday and split the roasted brussel sprouts, the mac and  cheese with bacon, and corn bread with jalapeno and bacon. All were delicious, but be forewarned that there is A LOT of jalapeno in the corn bread. For my drink I tried the warm apple cider with a shot of 4 roses bourbon - I highly recommend it! For the main course I split the meatloaf sandwich and mussels with chorizo with another guest. The mussels were good in the beer broth with mushrooms, but the chorizo was a bit strange - had the consistency of chopped meat and was mild. Also, the beer broth is very good so you may want to order a side of bread for dipping (it doesn't come with any), but just note that it's buttered and toasted albeit tasty! The meatloaf was, well, it was just OK. It's definitely not what I grew up eating (mostly meat with a bit of breading, seasoning, tomato and onions) - it was not very meaty and I mainly saw vegetables, or carrots. There was so much food that we couldn't finish it and each one of us took a doggy bag to go. My friend said that the meatloaf was actually better cold the second day. For dessert we all split the chocolate bread pudding - oh my! It came with a large dollop of whipped cream on top and was very good! I'd definitely go back, but not for a while since it is a heavy meal.",3.0

"One of the best (and most flirtatious) service experiences I had in the Brooklyn, it was the perfect last night experience in the US. Arriving at 11pm after a night of drinking gin down the road at The Shanty I was stoked to see they served food until late. I told the bartender I was after something filling, alcohol soaking yet not too heavy and was advised to try the grilled mackerel on greens and accompanied by fried pickles.Fried Pickles. These are one of God's greatest gifts to the world and it astounds me that something so seemingly wrong can be so so right. If it were legal to marry fried vegetables, I'd be down on one knee tomorrow offering up a diamond ring to one of these babies. Paired with a glass (okay, two glasses) of Riesling this was the perfect end to my visit to Brooklyn and made even better that I felt completely relaxed as a solo diner at the comfortable bar.",4.0
"I love Brooklyn Star.I love Brooklyn Star.I absolutely love Brooklyn Star. I cannot decide what I like most here. It's a 3-way tie between their macaroni and cheese, their Bloody Bull (Bloody Mary made with beef broth) and the shrimp and grits. Wait - I forgot about how they have the best chicken and waffles in the city! Too much to choose from. This place really has it all.Most recently I went for dinner and had the meatloaf sandwich, which for the price is an amazing value. The sandwich was served on enormous Texas toast with mashed potatoes actually ON the sandwich between the slices of bread. And the meatloaf itself was thick and delicious. I could only eat half of the sandwich and saved the other half for lunch the next day. I'd recommend eating all of their house-made chips with your dinner, though, as they didn't really stand the test of the refrigerator. Not that I would ever hold that against Brooklyn Star. That was my own fault.My boyfriend ordered the country fried steak for the most recent dinner we had there and his, too, was amazing (and this is coming from me, a Virginia native with years of experience under my belt in judging country fried steak).The only disappointment I've faced here is that twice I have showed up to eat there and been too early (both times for brunch/lunch, once on the weekend where I was just simply too early and once on a weekday because I did not realize that they don't open until 5 on weekdays). Their food is just so good that I want it all the time!The space is also excellent. It's actually really quite large, and I've never had an issue with waiting - 10 minutes is the most I've ever had to kill time, and I was actually able to wait at the bar and they transferred my drink to my dinner bill even though I ordered at the bar. Very good service. Nice, romantic, woodsy setting. If you haven't gone yet - go.",5.0
"I am a fan.  So this review is for the bar only.  I came here for the happy hour which is pretty good with some basic drink specials and $1 oysters (I know random, but it's Williamsburg!).  The oysters were not too bad.  I really like the liquor selection - good variety of scotches and bourbons.   They have a drink called ""4 spice"" which was on HH special for $7.  Worth a try if you like bitter.  The service is excellent - very nice and consultative bartenders.   The bar area is chill and has ample room.  Good music - random mix.  Worth checking out.",4.0

"This resturant is my new everything. If this was baseball Chef Joaquin Baca pitched a no hitter. Getting a peak at his trophy from his recent Knife Fight victory wasn't too shabby either. Every last detail, from the drinks to the dessert, was perfection. I don't always eat duck, but when I do its the duck wings at Brooklyn Star. The flan made me weep with joy. And the staff was all very friendly and accommodating. Will definitly be back. Great, Great night.",5.0
"If you want to get your fix of southern food, this place is pretty good. Not the best, but it will do. I really like the feel of the place. Friendly folks with good service. I'd go here again.Biscuits are craaaaaazzzzy!",4.0
"One of the best (and most flirtatious) service experiences I had in the Brooklyn, it was the perfect last night experience in the US. Arriving at 11pm after a night of drinking gin down the road at The Shanty I was stoked to see they served food until late. I told the bartender I was after something filling, alcohol soaking yet not too heavy and was advised to try the grilled mackerel on greens and accompanied by fried pickles.Fried Pickles. These are one of God's greatest gifts to the world and it astounds me that something so seemingly wrong can be so so right. If it were legal to marry fried vegetables, I'd be down on one knee tomorrow offering up a diamond ring to one of these babies. Paired with a glass (okay, two glasses) of Riesling this was the perfect end to my visit to Brooklyn and made even better that I felt completely relaxed as a solo diner at the comfortable bar.",4.0
"I love Brooklyn Star.I love Brooklyn Star.I absolutely love Brooklyn Star. I cannot decide what I like most here. It's a 3-way tie between their macaroni and cheese, their Bloody Bull (Bloody Mary made with beef broth) and the shrimp and grits. Wait - I forgot about how they have the best chicken and waffles in the city! Too much to choose from. This place really has it all.Most recently I went for dinner and had the meatloaf sandwich, which for the price is an amazing value. The sandwich was served on enormous Texas toast with mashed potatoes actually ON the sandwich between the slices of bread. And the meatloaf itself was thick and delicious. I could only eat half of the sandwich and saved the other half for lunch the next day. I'd recommend eating all of their house-made chips with your dinner, though, as they didn't really stand the test of the refrigerator. Not that I would ever hold that against Brooklyn Star. That was my own fault.My boyfriend ordered the country fried steak for the most recent dinner we had there and his, too, was amazing (and this is coming from me, a Virginia native with years of experience under my belt in judging country fried steak).The only disappointment I've faced here is that twice I have showed up to eat there and been too early (both times for brunch/lunch, once on the weekend where I was just simply too early and once on a weekday because I did not realize that they don't open until 5 on weekdays). Their food is just so good that I want it all the time!The space is also excellent. It's actually really quite large, and I've never had an issue with waiting - 10 minutes is the most I've ever had to kill time, and I was actually able to wait at the bar and they transferred my drink to my dinner bill even though I ordered at the bar. Very good service. Nice, romantic, woodsy setting. If you haven't gone yet - go.",5.0
"I am a fan.  So this review is for the bar only.  I came here for the happy hour which is pretty good with some basic drink specials and $1 oysters (I know random, but it's Williamsburg!).  The oysters were not too bad.  I really like the liquor selection - good variety of scotches and bourbons.   They have a drink called ""4 spice"" which was on HH special for $7.  Worth a try if you like bitter.  The service is excellent - very nice and consultative bartenders.   The bar area is chill and has ample room.  Good music - random mix.  Worth checking out.",4.0
"Honestly my favorite brunch spot in all of Williamsburg.  Have sampled quite a few of the items here and there's nothing that I don't like.  Faves are the meatloaf sandwich (offered at both brunch and dinner but brunch has the egg), and the FRIED CHICKEN.  Don't miss the donuts either.  Great spot!",5.0

"I went here for dinner Sunday night with my roommate after wanting to try this place for quite some time. I have to say you didn't disappoint! Brooklyn Star is comfort food with a more updated Brooklyn feel. Having walked past a few times before, I realized after going to dinner that it's much bigger than I thought it was, with large family style tables and smaller tables on the sides of the walls. We got seated right away and our server was very friendly. I got a hot spiked cider to drink and it was the perfect winter evening drink! For an entrée I tried the country fried steak which is a huge helping that I recommend if you want a full meal but to still have some left over for lunch the next day. My roommate got the bacon mac & cheese which she said was super delicious. She did order a jalapeño cornbread which took forever to come out and I'm pretty sure they actually gave to the table next to us because right afterwards our server came out and said she had no idea where the cornbread went. They offered to get us a new one but we didn't feel like waiting 20 something minutes. Otherwise, an overall solid dinner that I will be going to again.",4.0

I came in alone on a weeknight -- it wasn't too busy, but it took a minute to catch the eye of a hostess or server, who guided me to an empty bar seat. I got the famous pork chop, which I'm a bit torn about. The meat is vast, tasty and well executed. It's served in a pool of au jus, which is nice because as you traverse the Porklandia of this chop, you will come across some drier bits that benefit from a dunk  in the juice. Other regions like the filet are moist enough to stand on their own.The sides are the main problem. The braised collards, which form a green, mushy bed for the chop, were inedibly salty. Perhaps they were salted when they were cooked and then absorbed more salt from the meat. And the onion rings seemed overfried, as the onions inside seemed to have evaporated into tasteless strings of cellulose.The staff were nice, but somewhat inattentive.

"I have a hard time deciding how to rate this place.  This review is more about service than food because I never really got my food.  I met two friends for dinner after they finished eating.  I joined late and was planning on eating after them since I had a gig in city and knew the kitchen was open late.  I arrived at 9pm and there were not many tables in front or back.  My friends had just finished and check was still open.  Ordered mac and cheese and kale salad.  After 30 minutes (there's maybe 6 other diners) I still haven't gotten my food.  Someone who came in after me just got there food and I still haven't seen our waitress.  I ask the bartender who comes to clear our drink glasses to check on my food.  He comes back and says its on its way.  I've worked service before and I know that means someone screwed it up and it just got fired.  We were leaving soon so I said cancel the mac and just bring the greens. After a few more minutes the waitress comes back to apologize that it is ""100% her fault"".  Okay.  That's cool she apologized and I said it's fine. I've worked service before and stuff happens. She brought out salad BUT, if it's your fault and you own up to it- offer something in return. Pick up a few drinks, take the salad off, bring the mac on the house or something so I will want to come back.  But no.  She got off shift sat at the bar next to us, had her dinner and left without ever bringing our check or offering to close out.  Later bartender closed us and bought a few rounds (thanks you sir).  I've heard the food is pretty good but I can think of sooo many other places that have a $30 steak and have better service.",2.0
"Went for a brunch on Sunday and was able to get seas at the high boys in the bar for four. The biscuits are still amazing - make sure to douse in butter, honey and hot sauce! I also had the meatloaf sandwich which was super tasty - although the bread is huge. My cousin loved the pancakes. My wife thought the waffle and chicken were just ok - you can do better nowadays. The drinks were also just ok - I liked but didn't love my Bloody Bull and my wife didn't like her drink. Anyways - the strength of the biscuits, meatloaf and pancakes make up for the other shortcomings but I had to bring the rating down a notch. Still love the place but might dabble elsewhere now...",3.0
"Brooklyn Star shines!Came in on a Sunday night and had the fried chicken and sides.  The chicken was nice and crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Very very good.The duck wings were meaty with a slight kick. Very tasty.  We also tried the oysters and they were fresh and delicious. I really enjoyed all of the sides.  Collard greens, Mac & Cheese, mashed potatoes and slaw were all excellent. Brooklyn Star also has excellent cocktails. Try the smoky old fashioned. The chocolate bread pudding with whiskey infused whipped cream was amazing. It comes to your table in a hot bubbly skillet.  It has to be the best dessert in Brooklyn. Seriously. The service here is on point.  Travis was our server and he knew the menu inside and out.  He did a really nice job with our large table.  The entire staff was warm, friendly and outgoing. I would definitely go out of my way for this place. The ambiance, food and staff is top notch.  I can't wait to go back.",5.0
"I was very underwhelmed with my brunch experience here. I ordered the shrimp and grits, which perhaps was my own fault for thinking a place in NYC could make a classic Southern dish well. Everything about the dish was wrong. The shrimp were fishy and the grits were watery. I barely ate any of it. Luckily, we had ordered biscuits for the table so I ate those instead. The biscuits were decent, a teeny bit undercooked, but still pretty tasty. I tried their Bloody Mary and it was delicous, which is the main reason I gave three stars instead of two. The place is super popular, so perhaps I just made a really really bad decision. The other food looked good, but then again, mine did LOOK good. It just tasted awful.",3.0

"Not the best Southern food but certainly not the worst. I love the rustic barn-style decor, with small tealight candles lining long distressed wooden tables and benches. I was intrigued and scared to see fried pig tails on the menu - the friend I came with was in the middle of reading ""The Omnivore's Dilemma"" and told me about how in mass hog production, they cut off the tails so the pig won't bite off the tail in front of them. The waitress assured us that their pig tails were not those severed ones and we meekly believed her enough to order a plate. Whether or not this was true, the pig tails were delicious! I imagined a plate of unappetizing little corkscrew tails but these were slathered in barbecue sauce and had the taste and texture of short ribs. What a nice surprise! I was less impressed with the country fried steak. The meat was tough and chewy, and the gravy was a bit too salty.",3.0
"Great brunch spot! I convinced my friends to head into Williamsburg on a Sunday morning to check this place out. We arrived at 11:45 and took a lap around to kill some time before the restaurant opened. When we arrived back at 11:55 there was a LINE at the door! I had called earlier in the week to make a brunch reservation for the 8 of us, but they only accept one large party reservation per time slot. However, they still have tables to accommodate simultaneous larger groups and since we arrived right at opening time, we were seated promptly.The space is warm and inviting, and the staff appropriately hipster-ish. Loved the southern cooking and large portions! Three of us shared several brunch orders. Here's my ranking of the three dishes:1. Chicken and waffles. SO good. They use dark meat and the inside is super moist. The skin was crispy and seasoned perefecty and it comes with 2 large pieces of chicken. The waffle was also tasty. To top off this entree, the sugared grapefruit is grilled, which creates a delicious sugary glaze.2. Meatloaf sandwich. HEARTY. Made with two huge pieces of texas toast, the meatloaf itself wasn't very large, but it was yummy. My favorite part of this dish was the homemade bbq chips it came with!3. Flapjacks. The description sounded much better than the actual dish. There were almost NO blueberries in the pancakes, and the ham was minuscule. I wouldn't recommend this entree.Hubby also tried the bloody mary, which was standard. Nothing to rave about, but nothing to complain about either.Great brunch spot; I'm especially happy with the price point of most items.",4.0
"This was the best delivery decision I've made in a while. When we ordered mac n cheese, cornbread and spicy chicken wings they told us they had duck wings. The order arrived  pretty early and when we opened the box of ""wings"" it was actually legs. But make no mistake, this food was bomb ass. So good. The duck wings were my favorite bht the macncheese and cornbread are well worth it.",4.0
"When I first tried Brooklyn Star, it was at their previous location (yelp.com/biz/the-brookly…) and it seemed they were still working some of their kinks out. The food I had was decent for NYC standards, though a bit lackluster when compared to the comfort food found down South. On top of that, it felt pricey for my group of hungry Southerners and I but that's just part of the current reality of dining in Brooklyn.Fast forward to their updated location and right away it feels like a different restaurant. Some things haven't changed much (still somewhat pricey, same ""small"" + ""big"" dish tapas type menu) and other things have, namely the execution of their seasonal offerings. It's important to note the distinction of Southern versus Southern inspired food, which BK star is now in the latter. The heartiness and simplicity of American comfort food is personified through many of their dishes, though it seems the chefs are incorporating other elements to give the community and palate pleaser chasers, something to nom about. These are all good things and it certainly reflected in everything we ate.Does it get more Southern than a raw kale salad, tossed with raisins, peanuts, bits of cheddar in a lemon vinaigrette? Hardly, but it was delicious and a vegan appropriate dish for many Brooklynites, I'm sure. Big ups to the grilled veal sweet breads, there was a nice crisp on the outside and the juicy bite combined with the salsa verde, hominy among other things kept the heads nodding with a slow chew to savor the taste. Also worthy of mention was the smoked bone marrow, which with their red onion jam and toast points, were a hit. If it were possible to have an entire meal dedicated to this, it would certainly be mine to eat.Mac and cheese is a staple in any comfort food house, but this version, which included bits of bacon within the gooey cheese was a little salty for our liking. I am hoping this was a fluke, along with the spicy fried wings, which were a little dry and skinny to the bone. We should've opted for the fried pig tails instead.Big plates abound, I could not stop eating the grilled trout, served atop of creamed corn, beans, and drizzled with a smoked oyster tomato vinaigrette. The molasses brined pork chop was another hit, juicy to the cut and melt in your mouth chewy to the bite. We were able to savor the hot meatloaf sandwich, which was better as a personal dish than to share, but was nonetheless tasty throughout.Food aside, the one downer of the evening was our lackluster server. It wasn't terribly busy but we couldn't help but think they had a bad day due to the 'tude they were sporting. We knew to order everything immediately and drink our glasses of water slowly, this will often keep the service from disrupting the experience any further.For the return during brunch, the stand out for me was the biscuits, eggs, swimming in a delicious sausage gravy. The masa cakes is also nothing to balk at and the smoked salmon + scrambled eggs + fish roe are a very delicious touch. If none of this sounds appealing, you may find comfort in knowing there is no substitutions of any kind. Vegans, prepare for more salad.Lastly, there is a $20 per person family style fried chicken dinner that I intend on trying the time around. If things keep progressing, which they seem to be, BK Star might just end up being the brightest in Williamsburg.",4.0
"Very tasty overall and very attentive cheerful  servers! I went here with a friend for dinner and had a great time! We split the endive salad with a creamy lemon dressing and fried goat cheese which was super yummy (not a health but salad though)! I got the Mac and cheese and she got the meatloaf sandwich. Both were super and I would get the meatloaf if I went back. For desert, we got a watermelon basil cookie sandwich to split. It tasted a little freezer burned and I only had a bite or two. All in all it was a great meal though and I would defiantly go back! Just get desert elsewhere.",4.0
"I have a hard time deciding how to rate this place.  This review is more about service than food because I never really got my food.  I met two friends for dinner after they finished eating.  I joined late and was planning on eating after them since I had a gig in city and knew the kitchen was open late.  I arrived at 9pm and there were not many tables in front or back.  My friends had just finished and check was still open.  Ordered mac and cheese and kale salad.  After 30 minutes (there's maybe 6 other diners) I still haven't gotten my food.  Someone who came in after me just got there food and I still haven't seen our waitress.  I ask the bartender who comes to clear our drink glasses to check on my food.  He comes back and says its on its way.  I've worked service before and I know that means someone screwed it up and it just got fired.  We were leaving soon so I said cancel the mac and just bring the greens. After a few more minutes the waitress comes back to apologize that it is ""100% her fault"".  Okay.  That's cool she apologized and I said it's fine. I've worked service before and stuff happens. She brought out salad BUT, if it's your fault and you own up to it- offer something in return. Pick up a few drinks, take the salad off, bring the mac on the house or something so I will want to come back.  But no.  She got off shift sat at the bar next to us, had her dinner and left without ever bringing our check or offering to close out.  Later bartender closed us and bought a few rounds (thanks you sir).  I've heard the food is pretty good but I can think of sooo many other places that have a $30 steak and have better service.",2.0
"Went for a brunch on Sunday and was able to get seas at the high boys in the bar for four. The biscuits are still amazing - make sure to douse in butter, honey and hot sauce! I also had the meatloaf sandwich which was super tasty - although the bread is huge. My cousin loved the pancakes. My wife thought the waffle and chicken were just ok - you can do better nowadays. The drinks were also just ok - I liked but didn't love my Bloody Bull and my wife didn't like her drink. Anyways - the strength of the biscuits, meatloaf and pancakes make up for the other shortcomings but I had to bring the rating down a notch. Still love the place but might dabble elsewhere now...",3.0
"Brooklyn Star shines!Came in on a Sunday night and had the fried chicken and sides.  The chicken was nice and crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Very very good.The duck wings were meaty with a slight kick. Very tasty.  We also tried the oysters and they were fresh and delicious. I really enjoyed all of the sides.  Collard greens, Mac & Cheese, mashed potatoes and slaw were all excellent. Brooklyn Star also has excellent cocktails. Try the smoky old fashioned. The chocolate bread pudding with whiskey infused whipped cream was amazing. It comes to your table in a hot bubbly skillet.  It has to be the best dessert in Brooklyn. Seriously. The service here is on point.  Travis was our server and he knew the menu inside and out.  He did a really nice job with our large table.  The entire staff was warm, friendly and outgoing. I would definitely go out of my way for this place. The ambiance, food and staff is top notch.  I can't wait to go back.",5.0
"I was very underwhelmed with my brunch experience here. I ordered the shrimp and grits, which perhaps was my own fault for thinking a place in NYC could make a classic Southern dish well. Everything about the dish was wrong. The shrimp were fishy and the grits were watery. I barely ate any of it. Luckily, we had ordered biscuits for the table so I ate those instead. The biscuits were decent, a teeny bit undercooked, but still pretty tasty. I tried their Bloody Mary and it was delicous, which is the main reason I gave three stars instead of two. The place is super popular, so perhaps I just made a really really bad decision. The other food looked good, but then again, mine did LOOK good. It just tasted awful.",3.0
Delicious brunch! Could not believe the portions - definitely share! Great mimosas and bloody marys!,4.0
"Not the best Southern food but certainly not the worst. I love the rustic barn-style decor, with small tealight candles lining long distressed wooden tables and benches. I was intrigued and scared to see fried pig tails on the menu - the friend I came with was in the middle of reading ""The Omnivore's Dilemma"" and told me about how in mass hog production, they cut off the tails so the pig won't bite off the tail in front of them. The waitress assured us that their pig tails were not those severed ones and we meekly believed her enough to order a plate. Whether or not this was true, the pig tails were delicious! I imagined a plate of unappetizing little corkscrew tails but these were slathered in barbecue sauce and had the taste and texture of short ribs. What a nice surprise! I was less impressed with the country fried steak. The meat was tough and chewy, and the gravy was a bit too salty.",3.0
"Great brunch spot! I convinced my friends to head into Williamsburg on a Sunday morning to check this place out. We arrived at 11:45 and took a lap around to kill some time before the restaurant opened. When we arrived back at 11:55 there was a LINE at the door! I had called earlier in the week to make a brunch reservation for the 8 of us, but they only accept one large party reservation per time slot. However, they still have tables to accommodate simultaneous larger groups and since we arrived right at opening time, we were seated promptly.The space is warm and inviting, and the staff appropriately hipster-ish. Loved the southern cooking and large portions! Three of us shared several brunch orders. Here's my ranking of the three dishes:1. Chicken and waffles. SO good. They use dark meat and the inside is super moist. The skin was crispy and seasoned perefecty and it comes with 2 large pieces of chicken. The waffle was also tasty. To top off this entree, the sugared grapefruit is grilled, which creates a delicious sugary glaze.2. Meatloaf sandwich. HEARTY. Made with two huge pieces of texas toast, the meatloaf itself wasn't very large, but it was yummy. My favorite part of this dish was the homemade bbq chips it came with!3. Flapjacks. The description sounded much better than the actual dish. There were almost NO blueberries in the pancakes, and the ham was minuscule. I wouldn't recommend this entree.Hubby also tried the bloody mary, which was standard. Nothing to rave about, but nothing to complain about either.Great brunch spot; I'm especially happy with the price point of most items.",4.0
"This was the best delivery decision I've made in a while. When we ordered mac n cheese, cornbread and spicy chicken wings they told us they had duck wings. The order arrived  pretty early and when we opened the box of ""wings"" it was actually legs. But make no mistake, this food was bomb ass. So good. The duck wings were my favorite bht the macncheese and cornbread are well worth it.",4.0
"When I first tried Brooklyn Star, it was at their previous location (yelp.com/biz/the-brookly…) and it seemed they were still working some of their kinks out. The food I had was decent for NYC standards, though a bit lackluster when compared to the comfort food found down South. On top of that, it felt pricey for my group of hungry Southerners and I but that's just part of the current reality of dining in Brooklyn.Fast forward to their updated location and right away it feels like a different restaurant. Some things haven't changed much (still somewhat pricey, same ""small"" + ""big"" dish tapas type menu) and other things have, namely the execution of their seasonal offerings.

"A little off the path of the main strip of bars and eateries, lies Brooklyn Star. This place is definitely a Star in Brooklyn. The food was great as well as the drinks.

The decor is great as is the entire layout, its pretty spacious compared to many other restaurants in the area. Being a Monday evening me and my 3 companions were fortunate enough to get a booth which I'm sure we would've needed to reserve if it were a weekend. To Drink I had the Sweet Tea Sour and is was well balanced. To eat I had the Mac N Cheese (w/bacon) it was a force to be reckoned with. Afterward I had the Country Fried Steak with Mashed Potatoes. Though the Potatoes were the standout of the dish the Steak was great. Out of curiosity I ordered the Cornbread with Jalapeno and bacon that was ok but needed the honey that was provided to balance it out a bit because it wasn't as sweet as most cornbread I've had in the past elsewhere.Definitely a place I will revisit in the near future.

When our server asked if we'd like to start off with anything he replied with, ""Mac & Cheese"". I chuckled and responded with, ""something light huh?"" I'm thankful that he ordered this bc it was quite delicious. The breadcrumb crust was crispy, the Mac was cheesy and gooey, and the bacon chunks inside, decadent. My b&g's were great! Gravy, hot and flavorful. The biscuits were warm and flaky.Service, super casual but still welcoming and warm. I totally dug the space, reminded me of Napa ever so slightly.

"I've been to Brooklyn Star a few times over the last few months and this is hands down my new favorite restaurant. I can't wait until the fried green tomatoes are back in season. The restaurant is nicely decorated, very comfortable and inviting, but usually packed on weekend evenings and kind of loud, making it a little difficult for conversation with a group of friends. There's always a delicious and innovative new drink on the ever changing cocktails menu. And the only thing I've had at this place that I ""didn't"" love were the fried pigs tail. They're good - just not my cup of tea.Now on to some of the stellar stand out menu items: of course, there's the mac cheese. It's creamy, smoky and has a unique cheese flavor that other restaurants can't really compete with. The brined pork chop with collard greens - amazing. Chicken fried steak? The best you'll ever have. The short ribs are good... But what really set Brooklyn Star apart for me was the completely unexpected flavor of the meatloaf sandwich. Trust me - this is NOT traditional meatloaf. I'd assume it's a mixture of ground beef and maybe brisket or something - I dunno, all I know is it's good. And the seasoning blended with the meat and a remoulade sauce or something - it's delicious! Get it!

"I've been here 2x, but the second time soured me so much I don't know that I will go back.This place is known for its brunch, which starts at noon. I arrived on a Sunday with my boyfriend around 12:30 and the seating area in the back was already completely filled. I was told by the hostesses that we could sit at the bar for food.We proceed to get seats at the bar and ask the bartender for a menu, who provides it without a word. We check out the menu and a few minutes later alert the bartender we know what we want to order. The bartender proceeded to then be super rude to us and tell us that at the bar, you can't order food until after 1pm.1.) WHY is this not written anywhere, whether on signs or on the menu or website?2.) WHY did the bartender hand us the menu and fail to tell us we could not order until after 1?3.) WHY did the hostesses tell us to sit at the bar and, again, fail to tell us the 1pm time limit?We left. NOT impressed and probably won't go back.",2.0

"I came here for my birthday brunch yesterday, which was a great time.  It's rather crowded so you'll probably wait about 30 - 45 minutes for a table.  They only take reservations for parties of 8, hard to find that many people.  I had a party of 6, so we waited patiently for a table to open while enjoying a few bloody marys at the bar in the front.  The bartenders are super nice at the bar, very attentive and drinks are made quickly.  The $9 bloody mary is delicious, complete with pickled green beans.  Nice and spicy!We were seated after about 40 minutes.  Our waitress was very nice, although rather busy.  We ordered entrees and pitcher of mimosa, which was delicious.  Here's what we got:Biscuits with sausage gravy and scrambled eggs:  I ordered this, but the biscuits came with melted cheddar cheese on them.  I'm allergic to cheese and was really surprised by this.  The menu never said cheese was on this item, but the waitress was really nice and took it away to return with a whole new place w/ regular biscuits. The kitchen turned my entree around so quickly and it was absolutely delicious!!  I definitely recommend this and if you like cheddar, I bet its even better.  Fried Chicken & Waffles: two of my friends got this and loved it.  The chicken was juicy and perfectly crisp.  The waffle was sweet and soft.  The grapefruit was another nice touch.  A big meal, so come hungry!Shrimp & Grits: my friend loved this dish.  Definitely ate every bite.  It looked awesome.Masa Cakes: my friend said it was SUPER spicy with a peppery flavor.  She likes spicy but thought the chorizo was a little too hot for her.  She enjoyed it, but would choose something else in the future.Blueberry Johnny Cakes w/ pork belly:  my friend wasn't thrilled w/ this option.  She got it specifically for the blueberry pancakes which ended up having very little blueberry to it.  The pork belly was pure fat, so pretty much inedible.  Overall everything was really good.  Most of us enjoyed our food, which came out quickly and nice n' hot.  We were never rushed and the atmosphere was very pleasant.  Although it takes a while to get in and seat down, its worth the wait.",4.0
"The country fried steak here is... good. I won't say it's great, but it's good. The wings here are also very delicious and fried well. My only gripe is the pricing. The wings for a serving of 6 were $12...that's $2 per wing! (albeit very good wings)The country fried steak was $16 and definitely filling but it's essentially a thin piece of skirt steak with mashed potatoes. This place earns a half star for serving food until 2 p.m. I won't give it 4 though since neither the food nor the value is great.",3.0

"After a wednesday night happy hour, the menu at Brooklyn Star sounded excellent.Stumbling down the street from the nearby Lorimer stop off the L train, Brooklyn Star is located on the  surprisingly quiet corner of Lorimer and Conselyea; only a block away from the always bustling Union and Metropolitan.Not knowing what to expect, we walked up the concrete handicap friendly ramp and pulled open the door of the non-descript brick building. Once inside a sizable bar greets you with ample seating both at the bar itself and at several tables lining the wall. Connected in the back of the restaurant was a full dining area with long wood tables. We received a friendly welcome from one of the wait staff and she left it up to us whether we wanted to grab a seat in the bar area or the dining area. The place had a few patrons, but due to the size of the place and that it was a dreary wednesday there were a lot of open seats. We chose the bar area. Taking a moment to get ourselves situated, I noticed that the bar has a very ""clean"" look, meaning not a lot of crap all over the place so no taxidermied animals, oddities, and typical brooklyn bar crap which is nice. huge cabinets of liquors and a couple of chalk boards above them do the work of filling the space.Seeing the numerous reviews on the country fried steak, and being that its country fried steak - how can you not appreciate deep fried steak covered in gravy with mashed potatoes? - had to try it.Also, just cause I've never had, I needed to give those deep fried pig tails a go ($12). The country fried steak was portioned well. Two steaks on top of a bed of mashed potatoes and hot slaw covered in gravy. There is supposed to be bacon somewhere there too but not sure where that went. Or I might have just devoured it in one bite. The steak itself is well done. Tasty. And the potatoes are good also. Writing about the plate is making me salivate. The deep fried pig tails were good. They were a bit price-y and I'm not sure whether I would order them again. Not that they were bad. It's just that I would liken them to buffalo wings; the tails are cut into buffalo-wing sizes and put into a buffalo-wing like sauce. They're even given to you in a bowl with a bowl for the bones. You get something like 6 pieces and 4 pieces of tots. The tots looked like hush puppies but were good and tasted from scratch.Service was on point. The kitchen turned out the food blindingly fast...that or my sense of time several drinks in was considerably warped...or both. The staff were all very pleasant and made me feel welcome.I ended up with around a 90 bill but thats taking into consideration tip as well as four shots of knob creek, two beers, the country fried steak, and deep fried pig tails. I don't think thats too bad as it would have been half that without the drinks. as the knob creek was $8 a pop.I really enjoyed Brooklyn Star, with its delicious southern inflected comfort food, solid wait staff; and comfortable atmosphere.

"I've been here 2x, but the second time soured me so much I don't know that I will go back.This place is known for its brunch, which starts at noon. I arrived on a Sunday with my boyfriend around 12:30 and the seating area in the back was already completely filled. I was told by the hostesses that we could sit at the bar for food.We proceed to get seats at the bar and ask the bartender for a menu, who provides it without a word. We check out the menu and a few minutes later alert the bartender we know what we want to order. The bartender proceeded to then be super rude to us and tell us that at the bar, you can't order food until after 1pm.1.) WHY is this not written anywhere, whether on signs or on the menu or website?2.) WHY did the bartender hand us the menu and fail to tell us we could not order until after 1?3.) WHY did the hostesses tell us to sit at the bar and, again, fail to tell us the 1pm time limit?We left. NOT impressed and probably won't go back.",2.0

"I came here for my birthday brunch yesterday, which was a great time.  It's rather crowded so you'll probably wait about 30 - 45 minutes for a table.  They only take reservations for parties of 8, hard to find that many people.  I had a party of 6, so we waited patiently for a table to open while enjoying a few bloody marys at the bar in the front.  The bartenders are super nice at the bar, very attentive and drinks are made quickly.  The $9 bloody mary is delicious, complete with pickled green beans.  Nice and spicy!We were seated after about 40 minutes.  Our waitress was very nice, although rather busy.  We ordered entrees and pitcher of mimosa, which was delicious.  Here's what we got:Biscuits with sausage gravy and scrambled eggs:  I ordered this, but the biscuits came with melted cheddar cheese on them.  I'm allergic to cheese and was really surprised by this.  The menu never said cheese was on this item, but the waitress was really nice and took it away to return with a whole new place w/ regular biscuits. The kitchen turned my entree around so quickly and it was absolutely delicious!!  I definitely recommend this and if you like cheddar, I bet its even better.  Fried Chicken & Waffles: two of my friends got this and loved it.  The chicken was juicy and perfectly crisp.  The waffle was sweet and soft.  The grapefruit was another nice touch.  A big meal, so come hungry!Shrimp & Grits: my friend loved this dish.  Definitely ate every bite.  It looked awesome.Masa Cakes: my friend said it was SUPER spicy with a peppery flavor.  She likes spicy but thought the chorizo was a little too hot for her.  She enjoyed it, but would choose something else in the future.Blueberry Johnny Cakes w/ pork belly:  my friend wasn't thrilled w/ this option.  She got it specifically for the blueberry pancakes which ended up having very little blueberry to it.  The pork belly was pure fat, so pretty much inedible.  Overall everything was really good.  Most of us enjoyed our food, which came out quickly and nice n' hot.  We were never rushed and the atmosphere was very pleasant.  Although it takes a while to get in and seat down, its worth the wait.",4.0
"The country fried steak here is... good. I won't say it's great, but it's good. The wings here are also very delicious and fried well. My only gripe is the pricing. The wings for a serving of 6 were $12...that's $2 per wing! (albeit very good wings)The country fried steak was $16 and definitely filling but it's essentially a thin piece of skirt steak with mashed potatoes. This place earns a half star for serving food until 2 p.m. I won't give it 4 though since neither the food nor the value is great.",3.0

"After a wednesday night happy hour, the menu at Brooklyn Star sounded excellent.Stumbling down the street from the nearby Lorimer stop off the L train, Brooklyn Star is located on the  surprisingly quiet corner of Lorimer and Conselyea; only a block away from the always bustling Union and Metropolitan.Not knowing what to expect, we walked up the concrete handicap friendly ramp and pulled open the door of the non-descript brick building. Once inside a sizable bar greets you with ample seating both at the bar itself and at several tables lining the wall. Connected in the back of the restaurant was a full dining area with long wood tables. We received a friendly welcome from one of the wait staff and she left it up to us whether we wanted to grab a seat in the bar area or the dining area. The place had a few patrons, but due to the size of the place and that it was a dreary wednesday there were a lot of open seats. We chose the bar area. Taking a moment to get ourselves situated, I noticed that the bar has a very ""clean"" look, meaning not a lot of crap all over the place so no taxidermied animals, oddities, and typical brooklyn bar crap which is nice. huge cabinets of liquors and a couple of chalk boards above them do the work of filling the space.Seeing the numerous reviews on the country fried steak, and being that its country fried steak - how can you not appreciate deep fried steak covered in gravy with mashed potatoes? - had to try it.Also, just cause I've never had, I needed to give those deep fried pig tails a go ($12). The country fried steak was portioned well. Two steaks on top of a bed of mashed potatoes and hot slaw covered in gravy. There is supposed to be bacon somewhere there too but not sure where that went. Or I might have just devoured it in one bite. The steak itself is well done. Tasty. And the potatoes are good also. Writing about the plate is making me salivate. The deep fried pig tails were good. They were a bit price-y and I'm not sure whether I would order them again. Not that they were bad. It's just that I would liken them to buffalo wings; the tails are cut into buffalo-wing sizes and put into a buffalo-wing like sauce. They're even given to you in a bowl with a bowl for the bones. You get something like 6 pieces and 4 pieces of tots. The tots looked like hush puppies but were good and tasted from scratch.Service was on point. The kitchen turned out the food blindingly fast...that or my sense of time several drinks in was considerably warped...or both. The staff were all very pleasant and made me feel welcome.I ended up with around a 90 bill but thats taking into consideration tip as well as four shots of knob creek, two beers, the country fried steak, and deep fried pig tails. I don't think thats too bad as it would have been half that without the drinks. as the knob creek was $8 a pop.I really enjoyed Brooklyn Star, with its delicious southern inflected comfort food, solid wait staff; and comfortable atmosphere. (Plus upon leaving, I saw that they do $1 oysters during happy hour, definitely come back for that).Brooklyn Star is 5-stars!",5.0

"Evidently, the upscale soul food restaurant has become somewhat of a trope around Williamsburg, but I would say that Brooklyn Star is above average in the category. The food is obviously prepared with great care, and I love that there are unusual menu options like smoked bone marrow, which was fantastic. The fact that it was served with caramelized onions and salt to cut the sweet, mild fat taste really showed that they knew what they were doing. The ambience is good, but one gripe I have is with the bench style seating arrangement. You might end up on what feels dangerously close to a double date, with you plus another couple at a four-top, and I just don't believe that anyone finds that charming. Even in Texas.",4.0
"When in Brooklyn do as the Brookynites do, so for our day trip to New York we decided to have dinner at Brooklyn Star. For a Friday night the dining room was relatively empty but that wasn't a reflection on how the food tasted.  Though our service could have been better as our server clearly was not pleased about having to spend her evening at work. After waiting for some time to be acknowledged and have our drink order taken we then waited again for her to return and take our food orders as well. But when the food arrived all of those mishaps may as well have been erased because the tripe chili, pig tails, mac n'cheese, biscuits, brussel sprouts, spicy duck wings and bone marrow were are delectable. Though I am growing weary of this new wave of small plates that restaurants are serving I will say there was enough to go around among the five adults and one mini that we had seated. With each dish complimented by a rousing sound of ""mmmm's"" and ""wow's"" I'd say the struggle service and cold night's trek were well worth it. I do expect that on my next visit to Brooklyn from L.A I will be making another stop at this star on Lorimer.P.S Ask for an extra bag of Fritos with the chili but be aware you may get some flack for the request!",3.0

"Get. To. This. Restaurant. I did, and I cannot wait to go back. A few things you should know:1. Not your Grandma's soul food. Joaquin Baca's soul food. He brought the vixen out of soul food by giving it a makeover. The final result is sexy as hell and you're going to want to take pictures of it. If you're craving traditional soul food, this could be a bad thing, but at the very least, you're going to get a great meal, even if it's not what you expected. 2. You can share the portions.

"Food is superb! Have now been 4 times, and food has been outstanding each time. Brunch recommendation: shrimp n grits for salty, Johnny cakes for salty and sweet, masa cakes. Portions are big. Service is also good. It's very popular and no reservations, so there may be a wait, but totally worth it.",5.0
"Evidently, the upscale soul food restaurant has become somewhat of a trope around Williamsburg, but I would say that Brooklyn Star is above average in the category. The food is obviously prepared with great care, and I love that there are unusual menu options like smoked bone marrow, which was fantastic. The fact that it was served with caramelized onions and salt to cut the sweet, mild fat taste really showed that they knew what they were doing. The ambience is good, but one gripe I have is with the bench style seating arrangement. You might end up on what feels dangerously close to a double date, with you plus another couple at a four-top, and I just don't believe that anyone finds that charming. Even in Texas.",4.0
"When in Brooklyn do as the Brookynites do, so for our day trip to New York we decided to have dinner at Brooklyn Star. For a Friday night the dining room was relatively empty but that wasn't a reflection on how the food tasted.  Though our service could have been better as our server clearly was not pleased about having to spend her evening at work. After waiting for some time to be acknowledged and have our drink order taken we then waited again for her to return and take our food orders as well. But when the food arrived all of those mishaps may as well have been erased because the tripe chili, pig tails, mac n'cheese, biscuits, brussel sprouts, spicy duck wings and bone marrow were are delectable. Though I am growing weary of this new wave of small plates that restaurants are serving I will say there was enough to go around among the five adults and one mini that we had seated. With each dish complimented by a rousing sound of ""mmmm's"" and ""wow's"" I'd say the struggle service and cold night's trek were well worth it. I do expect that on my next visit to Brooklyn from L.A I will be making another stop at this star on Lorimer.P.S Ask for an extra bag of Fritos with the chili but be aware you may get some flack for the request!",3.0

"I arrived here with a few friends around 10 PM and found a lively bar upon entering on a weekday evening. At the dining room, however, it was a different story. We entered the quiet dining room and quickly secured a corner booth. We shared the bone marrow with toast as appetizer. Among individual scoops for bone marrow bits onto our own piece of toast, we quickly ran out of toast. The attentive server noticed this ""crisis"" and promised to bring out more fresh hot toast. Now that's what I call good service. The bone marrow bits were flavorful and a sprinkle of rock salt on top provided a subtle contrast in texture. Now, it's onto the main event - the meatloaf sandwich. The bacon-wrapped meatloaf itself had great texture and flavors; it was topped with a thin layer of mashed potato and served on Pullman bread. I had to pause after every bite to fully appreciate its simple glory. The sandwich was also served with a side of crunchy house-made chips. Since then, whenever I think about meatloaf sandwich, Brooklyn Star comes to mind immediately. Simply writing this post is making my mouth water all over again.",4.0
"I've sworn to myself for months now that I would start checking out Brooklyn and I can finally say I dedicated a full weekend to it!  First stop was Brooklyn Star for some DELICIOUS southern food.  We started it off with fried pig tails (yup just what you thought I said) which really looked and tasted like porky buffalo wings.  I was glad I tried them although not good enough for me to order again.  A little too tough. Next up was the Fried Green Tomatoes with Duck Confit, Frisee, Radish, Pickled Mustard Seeds and Smoked Molasses Vinaigrette which was the best dish of the meal.  God it was good. It was crunchy and meaty and tomato-y and oh yeah, good.We finished it off with the Molasses Brined Pork Chop with Braised Collards and Smoked Onion Rings.  It was super soft and not chewy at all due to being brined and the onion rings were crunchy yet sweet. Also as the resident NYC biscuit snob I must say I have found a tie with Zoe's biscuits.  These were DAMN good.  The cornbread in a skillet was also melty and incredible although we got it with bacon and jalapenos added which I didn't like as much.  I think I'd prefer plain.Overall this place was delicious and had the best sides of any restaurant I've been too so far.  It kind of reminded me of a Brooklyn version of the Redhead.  The service was impeccable as were the spicy margaritas.  It's fairly large and wasn't a long wait even at primetime on a Saturday so it could make a good date spot or large birthday party.",4.0

"This place Brooklyn Star deserves ZERO stars but yelp requires a rating to post and this is how much I believe people need to know how disrespectful and rude this place is. I have never needed to review any business. I am very neutral and I give all businesses a fair perspective. But people definitely need to know about this place and how they do not deserve your business unless you want to be grately mistreated and disrespected. Sorry but this place definitely does not deserve a visit at all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This review is literally right after the disrespect that we just received about 10mins ago. How do you offensively be rude to all 6 of us who were just looking for food during a late night. The lady who is Caucasian with brunette hair, who said her name is ""Lauren"", rudely dismissed all of us and said that ""you are all drunk"" and told us to ""get out"" when none of us are drunk. How do you wrongly accuse people like that?! We were not drunk at all and we were conversing with her respectfully where as she was being extremely disrespectful and racist!!! For a person that opens or works for a business, that is just unacceptable. They were being racist too!!!!! I nor any of my friends would ever step foot into this restaurant ever again even if we were starving or dying. I believe there is so many better places to spend your time and money than this rude place with rude people especially Lauren!!!!!",1.0

Now that's what I call good service. The bone marrow bits were flavorful and a sprinkle of rock salt on top provided a subtle contrast in texture. Now, it's onto the main event - the meatloaf sandwich. The bacon-wrapped meatloaf itself had great texture and flavors; it was topped with a thin layer of mashed potato and served on Pullman bread. I had to pause after every bite to fully appreciate its simple glory. The sandwich was also served with a side of crunchy house-made chips. Since then, whenever I think about meatloaf sandwich, Brooklyn Star comes to mind immediately. Simply writing this post is making my mouth water all over again.",4.0
"I've sworn to myself for months now that I would start checking out Brooklyn and I can finally say I dedicated a full weekend to it!  First stop was Brooklyn Star for some DELICIOUS southern food.  We started it off with fried pig tails (yup just what you thought I said) which really looked and tasted like porky buffalo wings.  I was glad I tried them although not good enough for me to order again.  A little too tough. Next up was the Fried Green Tomatoes with Duck Confit, Frisee, Radish, Pickled Mustard Seeds and Smoked Molasses Vinaigrette which was the best dish of the meal.  God it was good. It was crunchy and meaty and tomato-y and oh yeah, good.We finished it off with the Molasses Brined Pork Chop with Braised Collards and Smoked Onion Rings.  It was super soft and not chewy at all due to being brined and the onion rings were crunchy yet sweet. Also as the resident NYC biscuit snob I must say I have found a tie with Zoe's biscuits.  These were DAMN good.  The cornbread in a skillet was also melty and incredible although we got it with bacon and jalapenos added which I didn't like as much.  I think I'd prefer plain.Overall this place was delicious and had the best sides of any restaurant I've been too so far.  It kind of reminded me of a Brooklyn version of the Redhead.  The service was impeccable as were the spicy margaritas.  It's fairly large and wasn't a long wait even at primetime on a Saturday so it could make a good date spot or large birthday party.",4.0

"This place Brooklyn Star deserves ZERO stars but yelp requires a rating to post and this is how much I believe people need to know how disrespectful and rude this place is. I have never needed to review any business. I am very neutral and I give all businesses a fair perspective. But people definitely need to know about this place and how they do not deserve your business unless you want to be grately mistreated and disrespected. Sorry but this place definitely does not deserve a visit at all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This review is literally right after the disrespect that we just received about 10mins ago. How do you offensively be rude to all 6 of us who were just looking for food during a late night. The lady who is Caucasian with brunette hair, who said her name is ""Lauren"", rudely dismissed all of us and said that ""you are all drunk"" and told us to ""get out"" when none of us are drunk. How do you wrongly accuse people like that?! We were not drunk at all and we were conversing with her respectfully where as she was being extremely disrespectful and racist!!! For a person that opens or works for a business, that is just unacceptable. They were being racist too!!!!! I nor any of my friends would ever step foot into this restaurant ever again even if we were starving or dying. I believe there is so many better places to spend your time and money than this rude place with rude people especially Lauren!!!!!",1.0
"The Brooklyn Star is definitely my best place for mac n' cheese! They cook it with bacon, but no pb if you want it without. They have a lot of dishes to choose from.The Texas toast are generously served, and the buttermilk biscuits are really good!I like the decor (simple and warm), and it is really pleasent - a lot of room between tables. You can go with a big group.",4.0
Decided to try Brooklyn Star and I was happy I did.  Came here on a Monday and they have a special which includes Friend Chicken and a side. The selection of sides was awesome.  Got the colllard greens and we ordered the corn bread and mac & cheese.  We were so happy with everything we ordered it was DELICIOUS.  I wil definetly be coming back here.,4.0

"I had the bacon mac and cheese and chicken fried steak. This was the real ish. The food made me feel like I was right back in the South. The mac and cheese had a smooth and creamy sauce that was well balanced and season, and the toping was nice and crisp. WHO AM I KIDDING, IT""S MAC AND CHEESE AND BACON... OF COURSE IT""S GOING TO BE GOOD. Is it revolutionary? No, but it is incredibly satisfying. The chicken fried steak was also mad legit. BE WARNED THIS IS SOME ITIS INDUCING FOOD. GET YOU SOME.",4.0

"Upon entering, you'll find yourself in a dim lit but cozy space. For a table of 3, we sat in the booth area. With so many tempting choices on the menu, we took forever deciding what to order. We finally decided on 3 small plates of pig's tail, mac and cheese, bone marrow, and 1 big plate of pork loins.I have never eaten pig's tail before and it was soo delicious, especially with their tater tots (which they should include more of!!). The mac and cheese was nice and hot with bacon bits. You can hardly go wrong with that. The bone marrow was fantastic with the toast, bit of sea salt, and red onion jam. Last but not least was the pork loins served over what I thought was a vegetable soup but were really collard greens. On top of the pork were 3 onion rings stacked on top of each other. Nothing went wrong with this dish. Best collard greens I've ever eaten (but it might not mean much since i don't really eat collard greens). Onion rings were fermented on the inside and then fried to a crispy perfection. The pork - a mouthful of delight! I'm salivating as I'm reminiscing. My overall experience was great and what especially went well along with all the food was also the pleasant wait staff and good ambiance. Perhaps since I went on a Sunday, it was not too packed nor too noisy. Will definitely come back again.",5.0
"This place is a great place to post up and people watch at. Grab a drink and sit at the bar during the nice weather days when they have the street front windows open and you can gawk at people walking north from the Lorimer L stop.

"Got to go this past weekend. Full disclosure: I was a bit intoxicated...Oktoberfest style.Nice ambiance. Dark yet neat and lovely.  I think the key is the space between the tables so you don't feel like others are right on top of you and I don't believe the place was jam packed either although there were plenty of seats filled.I got to try lots of items:Pig Tails - huge thumbs up. Delicious. Sort of like a different version of a chicken wing, no breading.Spicy Chicken Wings - not what I expected...a bit simple but also well done. The outside was crispy and the wings tasted good but not as impressive as the pig tails.Trout Salad - yummy but really small plate and the fish is all chopped up which I don't mind but it does take away from the feeling that you are getting your money's worth.Bone Marrow - pointless to split. Tiny portion. Maybe my bone wasn't optimal. The toast and jelly or whatever it was is delicious and the whole thing did taste nice but I'm not thinking I got the full marrow experience and I'm no expert.Mac & Cheese - I really loved it. Bacon, Cheesy, wasn't too salty for me like someone mentioned. Really good. Ordered a whole plate of this to go in fact.Pork Chop - didn't get to try this but did have an onion ring that came with it...about 3 slices in each ring makes them very thick and they are very crusty. I'd say these are good and perhaps without the pork chop it doesn't have the full effect. I heard the chop was quite good.Chicken - tried some of this. Definitely good. Not overwhelmingly so. But had very little.Not sure why we didn't order cornbread but I wish we had.  By the way, did I mention I had 2 glasses of red koolaid?  This is only $1 each glass and it was such a fantastic thing to see...not because it's so delicious, although it's pretty good, but because it was fun and different and not some ridiculous $3 price tag. It's obviously profitable for them even at $1 but let's face it...a restaurant would much rather serve their cocktails and overpriced sodas ($3 for the latter).  I really liked the waiter (Travis I think) and everything else that happened at this place. No problems. A good variety of prices so you can really order something more or less fancy and same goes for the types of food available. Enjoy.",4.0

"Don't go with an odd number of people.  Went for brunch as a group of three and waited outside in line for the restaurant to start serving at noon.  Happy to wait in line.  We had arrived early to anticipate the wait, and normally I would say the food is worth waiting for.  We were in the middle of the line, but when we were greeted by the hostess there were still several tables available--one set for four and several set for two.  When we told her that we were a party of three, however, she told us that we could not sit down so that they could fill the tables with even-numbered parties in line behind us and not waste the chair space.  She said we were welcome to wait, but that it would be at least another hour.  I understand that The Brooklyn Star is in-demand and that when a place is that crowded there is no need to be accommodating to your customers.  And of course having a party of four sit at a table for four instead of a party of three means more money for the restaurant, but still I found the decision a little ridiculous.",1.0
This place is great. The food has a bit of a unique twist to southern favorites and it's just delicious. The jalapeño corn bread with it's amazing butter is so yummy.

"For the waiter with the sleeves tattoos (the one with the Coney Island face tattooed above the elbow)Well, this was an unfortunate experience. We were a party of 7 ready to enjoy a nice Friday night dinner at a restaurant that we heard raving reviews about. And indeed, the food was great. However, we did wait for over 40 minutes for it to come. After 30 minutes we had to ask what's up and the waiter explained that one of the dishes takes over 30 minutes to cook and it'll be out soon. Although it sounded like a made up excuse (he did not inform us of the cooking time when we ordered, and overall he seemed quite confused), we were polite and waited patiently. We quickly forgot about the waiting time as we finally got our food ten minutes later and it was excellent. When dinner was over we asked for the bill and I personally wrote down for the waiter how much to charge from each credit card, and we left him all together 25% tip. But for some reason, just as we were getting up from our table, we heard him say to another waiter-- these kids are fucking idiots, while pointing at us. No, he did not try to say it quietly. Yes, us kids (all hard working people in our late 20's) we're completely shocked. We still don't know why he called us that. We left the restaurant in such a bad mood which ruined everything for us. Definitely not going back there again.",1.0

"Easily overlooked, Brooklyn Star is tucked away on a residential corner very close to the Lorimer/Metropolitan L stop.  Its' spacious dining room and charming bar area offers a fantastic take on traditional soul food at reasonable prices.  Come hungry: the portions are huge, often very rich, and quite filling.  The vibe is comfortable, relaxed, and refreshingly free of the neighborhood's foodie pretensions and cramped interiors.  Standouts include the mac and cheese, meatloaf and steak.  My single complaint is that Brooklyn Star unabashedly commits the nearly unforgivable sin of putting BBQ vinaigrette directly onto its' fantastic oysters without warning.  Oyster garnishes should always be optional, no matter how adventurous they happen to be.",4.0

"An impromptu trip to Williamsburg led me to Brooklyn Star. I'll admit I didn't have high hopes for anything incredibly creative at first glance. The sign outside was like a million I'd seen and gave no clue as to what quality or type of food might be inside. I assumed American, which was correct, but boy was I wrong about the level of innovation.It was Sunday and drinks were totally necessary. I decided to go with something slightly less adventurous that I knew I'd love-- the Spicy Margarita with serrano-infused agave, lime and grapefruit juice. The chili infusion was perfectly spicy, and the combination of lime and grapefruit juice was refreshing, but perhaps a little too sweet when married with the agave nectar. I could, however, be biased as I do tend to order my drinks without sugar which makes them overly sour. You be the judge.We started with two appetizers: the Fried Pig Tails and Hush Puppies and the Terrine. I didn't actually think I'd be eating the tail of a pig; instead, I thought it was just a cutesie name for some miniature portion of meat made to mimic that of a pig tail. No, they were in fact two inch pieces of tender meat falling from a vertebral bone-- like tiny osso bucco-- covered in a thick BBQ sauce of some sort. I fell in love. The hush puppies looked burnt, but after gobbling one I knew they were cooked just right. I fell even harder. Other hush puppies I've had went overkill on the cornmeal and flour, resulting in a chewier and much denser version than this one. Until that moment, I'd never been a straight meat and potatoes kind of girl, but together and for once, the classic American meat and potato combo made perfect sense to me. The Terrine was well-executed: a good portion size, properly made, well seasoned and beautifully served with the appropriate additions of fruit compote and sprinkling of Fleur de Sel. I always appreciate a light crunch between my teeth and burst of saltiness when eating something with a monotonously mushy texture. The unforeseen star of the meal was indeed the Hot Meatloaf Sandwich on Pullman Bread simply because I've had very few memorable meatloafs and sandwiches-- let alone meatloaf sandwiches-- in my life. I figured this would be no different. It was a mountain of a sandwich-- thick slices of incredibly soft, chewy white bread (like Wonderbread on steroids), bear-hugging a hearty slab of meat, all held together by a glue of mashed potatoes. Immediately, I began to reconsider my usual boycott on bread. And, mashed potatoes as a condiment? My mind was blown. Just, why was there lettuce on this sandwich? A vegetable like that has no business on a sandwich like this. I cared very little about texture and moreso about how I was going to finish every last bit of my half, if my date was going to finish hers, and if not, how I might politely eat hers also. Service was good and prices appropriate for the quality of food and portion size. Highly recommended. Try it, you'll be pleasantly surprised.",4.0

"03/10/11Unfortunately, I never had the opportunity to dine at the original Brooklyn Star before it burnt down.  But when the grand re-opening of its new location on Lorimer Street was stirring up some internet buzz, I couldn't wait to taste chef Joaquin Baca's take on southern comfort food in the 'Burg.Pros:- The ambiance and overall feel of the place is inviting, non-clustered, and very clean.  I would describe the decor as Brooklyn-meets-Georgia.- Southern hospitality was present here.  Staff members were attentive, friendly, and embracing.- The sweet aroma of freshly baked cornbread that traveled through the dining room area was pleasant.- Grilled Quail with quail egg, frisee salad, and roasted fennel was grand.  The combinations of flavors all mixed well and contrasted each one perfectly.Cons:- The Spicy Fried Chicken Wings tasted good, but were ultra soggy.  I believe Hooters produce better wings.- The expeditor could have thought of spacing out our food.  My friend and I ordered a bunch of apps. and they all came at once which made each dish almost impossible to enjoy and/or savor.- Please change the Roasted Veal Marrow Bones to beef marrow bones because it was truly disappointing to expect marrow and not get it with these tiny bones we got served.- You get only three thin slices of overcooked Veal Sweetbreads accompanied with a nicely aromatic broth and kale.  Back to the three thin slices and overcooked part.As you might already know, the biggest part of the restaurant is its food.  Sure, service plays a big role, but it's the food people want to come back for.  The new Brooklyn Star's service hit the bullseye in many ways, but the food aspect needs to be considerably worked on.  I recognize this was it's first day of being re-opened, but, in my opinion, I don't think some of these dishes were acceptable to start with.  Unfortunately, I never had the opportunity to dine at the original Brooklyn Star to give both old and new restaurants a better comparison.  But I'm fortunate enough to admit that I see potential in chef Joaquin Baca's take on southern comfort food in the ""Burg.Will Chu""Real Food, Real Wine in The Real World""",2.0
"I had my birthday brunch here earlier this month. Lots of friends have raved about it, so I was excited to try it! Well, I made a reservation for 12 at 12 and when we arrived my party was about 10 min. late. I get it- that is a little annoying. The bartender made me feel unnecessarily guilty about this, a if it were the rudest thing I could have done. One person didn't show, and the hostess literally walked over after we were seated and asked if we could all squeeze into one table (which seats 8 btw) uncomfortably.... All because ONE person couldn't make it last minute?? I was starting to regret my choice of restaurant just because of how rude they were. Not exactly Southern hospitality.Our server was fine, and my Bloody Mary was very good. Everyone enjoyed their food, but the excess cheese on the biscuits and gravy is too much.. To be fair, my expectations are high because my mom uses a family recipe that is not to be beat. Also, one of my friends who came has a food allergy and emailed to restaurant beforehand to make sure they could accommodate. The exchange, from what she told me, was weirdly complicated, and when she told the service that she'd been in touch with the chef, she responded with a sassy ""Oh.... we heard about you."" Granted, this could be me reading too much into the situation, but it made me feel annoyed that they couldn't be more tactful. All in all, food and drinks are fine. Service was nothing to write home about, and the general attitude of the place was shockingly inhospitable. There are plenty of other southern fare restaurants I'd rather take my business to where I actually feel like I'm welcome.",2.0
"They put beef broth and pickled green beans in their bloodys, ok?I can't speak for their dinner service, but as far as brunch goes, you can't go wrong. Biscuits and gravy, apple johnny cakes, fried chicken and RIDICULOUS waffles, masa cakes and chorizo. I always leave full, drunk and happy, and what more can you ask for? Oh, and the space is beautiful.",5.0
"Brooklyn Star is the jam.I used to skip it, preferring to keep southern food at a distance. A little heavy, I thought. But I thought wrong. My eyes were opened a couple weeks ago with an absolutely perfect meal and subsequent visits. I have much more exploring of the menu to do, but I HIGHLY recommend the following for a guaranteed good time.Start it out with the house old fashioned, or the tequila variant, the Rusty Old Fashioned (The Ole Rusty, I hear the kids call it).  They smoke water (not the kids, the restaurant), then make simple syrup from it. Brilliant.At the same time, throw in an order of the Oysters on the half shell, a half dozen, which come topped with a BBQ mignonette that is straight baller. Since the first visit, I have returned 4X in 2 weeks. Just sayin. Seriously, a must order.Oh, and the baked to order corn bread with bacon and jalapenos. You're thinking, it's just cornbread, big deal. Sorry, I beg to differ. Best cornbread around, I'll take BK Star in a throwdown with any restaurant in NYC.The Romaine Salad... oh man. So good. Kind of like a wedge salad, but romaine leaves. For 8 bucks, it's substantial. Or the Cherry Tomato Salad... it's even better... a next level hit all the pleasure receptors dish that can compete with any salad on the menu at Gramercy Tavern. Next, the roasted chicken. You know when a restaurant makes you swoon for chicken, that they are the real deal. This half chicken is THE BEST chicken I have ever put in my mouth. Only the NoMad can compare, but they cheat with truffle and foie. BKStar is the real deal here.And the best part, the staff. Ryan, Gram, and the crew are the best around.

"This place popped up at the right place at the right time. Love their biscuits with Honey Butter, the veal bone marrow was delish s as well as the Pigs Tail and the Chix and Waffles.But the crown jewel is the MAC and cheese with Bacon :) Made me have kind of a food coma lol in a good way :)Nice ample seating in the back area. don't be decieved by the front. There was a nice wedding party going on in the back when we were there.",5.0
"Brooklyn star gets 5 stars! Started with the Mac n cheese followed by the T-bone steak, dinner was amazing. The steak was perfectly seasoned. When we thought we could eat no more, then came the warm chocolate bread pudding topped with vanilla ice cream. I hate chocolate but this was to die for! Not your average desert. The only thing that was better than the food was our excellent server Francesca! She is sweet as can be, friendly and made the experience even better! Thank you!",5.0

"Had a delcious meal here last night! Everything was super tasty - oysters (perfectly sized and not extremely briney), fried pig tails (had to try, and glad we did), duck wings (yum), fried chicken with all the fixings (super crispy breading and not greasy; mac n' cheese was amazing, collards greens great, mashed potatoes awesome) and the chocolate bread pudding was so good, I can't fully describe it. The drinks were all great as well, really enjoyed the captain something  with rum and lemon. Service was outstanding, atmosphere was cozy, just a great experience. Would definitely recommend!!",5.0
"03/10/11Unfortunately, I never had the opportunity to dine at the original Brooklyn Star before it burnt down.  But when the grand re-opening of its new location on Lorimer Street was stirring up some internet buzz, I couldn't wait to taste chef Joaquin Baca's take on southern comfort food in the 'Burg.Pros:- The ambiance and overall feel of the place is inviting, non-clustered, and very clean.  I would describe the decor as Brooklyn-meets-Georgia.- Southern hospitality was present here.  Staff members were attentive, friendly, and embracing.- The sweet aroma of freshly baked cornbread that traveled through the dining room area was pleasant.- Grilled Quail with quail egg, frisee salad, and roasted fennel was grand.  The combinations of flavors all mixed well and contrasted each one perfectly.Cons:- The Spicy Fried Chicken Wings tasted good, but were ultra soggy.  I believe Hooters produce better wings.- The expeditor could have thought of spacing out our food.  My friend and I ordered a bunch of apps. and they all came at once which made each dish almost impossible to enjoy and/or savor.- Please change the Roasted Veal Marrow Bones to beef marrow bones because it was truly disappointing to expect marrow and not get it with these tiny bones we got served.- You get only three thin slices of overcooked Veal Sweetbreads accompanied with a nicely aromatic broth and kale.  Back to the three thin slices and overcooked part.As you might already know, the biggest part of the restaurant is its food.  Sure, service plays a big role, but it's the food people want to come back for.  The new Brooklyn Star's service hit the bullseye in many ways, but the food aspect needs to be considerably worked on.  I recognize this was it's first day of being re-opened, but, in my opinion, I don't think some of these dishes were acceptable to start with.  Unfortunately, I never had the opportunity to dine at the original Brooklyn Star to give both old and new restaurants a better comparison.  But I'm fortunate enough to admit that I see potential in chef Joaquin Baca's take on southern comfort food in the ""Burg.Will Chu""Real Food, Real Wine in The Real World""",2.0
"I had my birthday brunch here earlier this month. Lots of friends have raved about it, so I was excited to try it! Well, I made a reservation for 12 at 12 and when we arrived my party was about 10 min. late. I get it- that is a little annoying. The bartender made me feel unnecessarily guilty about this, a if it were the rudest thing I could have done. One person didn't show, and the hostess literally walked over after we were seated and asked if we could all squeeze into one table (which seats 8 btw) uncomfortably.... All because ONE person couldn't make it last minute?? I was starting to regret my choice of restaurant just because of how rude they were. Not exactly Southern hospitality.Our server was fine, and my Bloody Mary was very good. Everyone enjoyed their food, but the excess cheese on the biscuits and gravy is too much.. To be fair, my expectations are high because my mom uses a family recipe that is not to be beat. Also, one of my friends who came has a food allergy and emailed to restaurant beforehand to make sure they could accommodate. The exchange, from what she told me, was weirdly complicated, and when she told the service that she'd been in touch with the chef, she responded with a sassy ""Oh.... we heard about you."" Granted, this could be me reading too much into the situation, but it made me feel annoyed that they couldn't be more tactful. All in all, food and drinks are fine. Service was nothing to write home about, and the general attitude of the place was shockingly inhospitable. There are plenty of other southern fare restaurants I'd rather take my business to where I actually feel like I'm welcome.",2.0
"They put beef broth and pickled green beans in their bloodys, ok?I can't speak for their dinner service, but as far as brunch goes, you can't go wrong. Biscuits and gravy, apple johnny cakes, fried chicken and RIDICULOUS waffles, masa cakes and chorizo. I always leave full, drunk and happy, and what more can you ask for? Oh, and the space is beautiful.",5.0

"AMAZING...I went here for dinner this past Sunday. Great weather all weekend so I expected it to be crowded. When you enter there is an area where it seems you can seat yourself but we choose to dine in the dining room further in the back.

Then we had a salad to share before our entrees came out. It was yummy with its buttermillk dressing. I ordered the short ribs and pineapple and spam fried rice. It was soooo good but I could not finish it with all that I had already eaten. He ordered the pork chop. Those onion rings..... that's all I have to say, no words!

"Disclosure: I'm Southern and I cook for a living.Away from home, I'm always curious and skeptical of Southern fare, but I usually end up checking it out. Given that this place is a five minute walk from my house, it was on my list.I came in hungry on what I assume was a slower night.My order was the cornbread, short ribs, and Pellegrino. Drink came quickly enough from a friendly server. About 15 minutes later, I think, the cornbread came. After waiting a while, I assumed that it was baked to order and that they probably want servers to tell customers that fact when ordering. No big deal. The cornbread was great! Salty, slightly sweet, more of the fluffy egg variety than your standard Deep South cornBREAD. Really good. It comes plain with the option of adding jalapeno and/or bacon, and with both honey and butter on the side. I just added jalapeno since I had made (and tested) sausage at home an hour earlier. Also, I ordered ribs so I figured that was more than heavy enough. I'd go here for the cornbread alone.The ribs were recommended since they were new, and I anxiously awaited them. I was told that they were brined and then smoked, probably finished in the oven. When they came out, the plate looked nice. It was plated in a New American, French-influenced way. Sauce on bottom, then starch and veggie with meat set at an angle on top. There were actually two sauces, one of which was a tasty, creamy cauliflower.  On top there was a beet mixture, but it seemed more mustard seed, vinegary, and had apple or asian pear or jicama or something cut brunoise in there as well. It was good, but the acid was more present than any beet flavor. The actual ribs were pretty good. Too smoky for me. That was really the MAIN flavor I got from it. The first couple bites were great, but the smoke was just too strong for a main plate. It was good, but too much.Kitchen, this would be an awesome small plate! The smoke was killing me by the end.The standouts were the cornbread and the cauliflower sauce. The sauce was super smooth and creamy. Really well done, which was a sign, to me, that this kitchen is run by someone who knows their technique. I'd definitely recommend this place to someone.

This place is awesome! Certainly one of those over looked places in Brooklyn. Just because it wasn't on food network like some other place.. The meatloaf sandwich it's ridiculously delicious!  If you are hungry go here!,5.0
"This place is awesome!!! What do you expect its a eatery in BROOKLYN! Anyway, the food was well cooked (had a meatloaf sandwich) and the serving size was filling. The place was packed but the waiter took her time to seat me in a comfortable area. Nice decor, a bit dark but overall friendly. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to experience the Brooklyn scene. Keep up the good work.",5.0
"Rating: 3.5The menu doesn't have a lot of options, so if you're particular about food or don't like heavy food, it's hard to find something that sounds good.  For appetizers, we got cornbread that was awesome, and oysters that were small and sad.For my meal, I ended up ordering the mussels with sausage and beans, and I was surprised by how good it was.  The sauce was delicious and they gave you bread to sop it up.  I didn't like the sausage at all though, but my boyfriend ate it.  Overall, the quality of food is good, but the range of options is pretty small.  If the menu looks good to you, you'll probably like it.  I would go back in the winter for the atmosphere because it seemed really cozy.",3.0

"""All animals are killed humanely with five point exploding heart punch.  All vegetables are yanked from the earth with extreme prejudice.  Fritos sourced from Plano, Texas""....Phew.  Reading this little blurb at the bottom of the tantalizing menu at Brooklyn Star put me totally at ease.  I also felt at ease by the warm welcome my girlfriend and I received immediately upon entering the bar area.  The staff here is incredibly friendly, I felt like I was walking into someone's home.  They got us set up at a comfy booth in the back, gave us drink and food menus, welcomed us to Brooklyn Star, and generally just made us feel at home while Paul Simon played on the radio.After about 5 minutes in the place, before a sip of alcohol or nibble of food, I had already decided that I am in love with this restaurant.  And it was all uphill from here.  We started out with cocktails and a cast-iron skillet full of bacon and jalapeno cornbread.  The drink menu was exciting.  I wanted to try everything.  The lady and I decided to order a Spicy Margarita and a Sweet Tea Sour, and split them both.  If you love sweet tea, and love whisky sours, you'd love a hybrid of the two.  And the Spicy Marg was exactly as it sounds, I absolutely loved it.  They warned us that the cornbread would take 15-20 minutes to come out of the kitchen- each one is made to order.  Yes please, sounds great! And we'd like to add the bacon and jalapeno as well!  This was possibly the highlight of the meal.  It was heavenly.  It seems that they first cooked the bacon in the cast iron skillet, then used that delicious animal fat to lube the skillet once they poured in the cornbread batter.  The result is each bite of cornbread not only has a generous amount of bacon in it, but also the smokey essence of bacon on the crispy crust as well.  Then we ordered 3 small plates and 1 large.  This was a pretty good move.  The small plates are generous, and allow you to try a bunch of different things.  I'd recommend this approach.The romaine wedge was the best I've ever had.  The homemade buttermilk dressing is divine.  There wasn't a TON of bacon, but I aint mad atchya.  Trust me, I left the restaurant fully meeting my pork quota for the day.  The fried oyster tacos were absolutely mind blowing.  At $16 for two tacos, these were by far the most expensive tacos I've eaten in my life.  Fried oysters are obviously incredibly delicious vittles on their own, but then they dress up these tacos with refried beans, cabbage and CHORIZO VINAIGRETTE. Yes, chorizo vinaigrette.  Not really sure how they do this, but yes, there are bits of meat in the dressing.  Nuff said.  Highly recommended.Next, the wings.  UN-REAL.  I think that Brooklyn Star has defied the laws of cooking meat here.  I've never eaten wings that are so goddamn crispy on the outside, yet so smooth and tender and soft on the inside.  The sauce: zesty and delicious.  I almost never eat wings without dipping them in bleu cheese or ranch.  Not these though, they are topped with little chopped up pickled carrots that seal the deal.  Quite a unique wing experience.  And to top it all off- The Shrimp and Grits.  Absolutely unreal.  Possibly my favorite shrimp and grits ever.  Escarole, fried egg, bacon and pan gravy....mmmm  mmmmm.  The dish was loaded with huge shrimp.  This was the ultimate cap to an already amazing experience, and THIS is what left me stuffed.All in all, I am enamored with the Brooklyn Star.  I am still thinking about this meal, days later.  That whole experience cost us $80, plus tip.  For a meal of this caliber, and those groovy libations, I think the price is quite fair.  Alas, this will be the type of place I only go to on special occasions.  While you could go grab a cheap meal here (meatloaf sandwich is $10) I feel that this is the type of spot you must BALL OUT when you make a visit, and truly milk it for all its worth.  I hope to go back many times in the future and eventually try everything.  I'm a bit shocked and disappointed in myself that I didn't order the bacon mac n cheese.",5.0

"Awesome restaurant. I came here with friends and we ate enough food to feed a small country and put me into a coma. I ate so much I almost died. But, I just had to eat it. If you go here, you'll understand.They divide the menu into ""small"" and ""big"" which somewhat matches starters and entrees - however the smalls could pass for a meal for one person, and the bigs can easily be shared by two people. In my opinion, the smalls are also better.They have something called ""Dublin Dr. Pepper"" and if you're a fan of Dr. Pepper you will love it. Also, get the cornbread. Don't question me on this. It is prepared and served in a cast iron pan, with butter and honey.I didn't get or try the salad/wedge, but my friends did and it looked real good.Also, order the mac & cheese. This is not an option! I don't care what meat/carb/fun-free diet or plan you think you're on. It has bacon bits in it. Like I said, I almost died.I'm still working on the bigs. Some friends had the roast half chicken, which looked good, but not quite my style (a lot of white meat). I had the country fried steak. Let me reiterate that it should be shared. Fried steak is not exactly an idea that makes my mouth water, but I ate all of it by myself, so it must have been pretty good as far as that goes. It came with mashed potatoes (good) and cabbage with bacon (not crazy about the greens, but the bacon helped).I washed that down with a chocolate bread pudding dessert, which was also meant for two people to share. I guess it was just one of those days. I planned to take half of it home for later, but I got bored and just kept picking at it until it was all gone. Oh yeah - it was good.I'll add that the restaurant also has a really nice, chill atmosphere, a great place to come with a big group or with a date, or better yet a double-date. The waiters are super friendly, too. A home run.",5.0

I had the meatloaf sandwich which was AMAZING - thick pullman bread, perfectly cooked and seasoned meatloaf, tangy slaw, and homemade potato chips. mmmm so good, can't wait to go back!

When food dies, it goes to heaven at the Star.",5.0
"YUM. Love this place. I've been for dinner several times and brunch once. I live nearby and always see a ton of people outside for bunch so I knew it would be good. Chicken and waffles - so good! The dinner portions are huge so I usually share with my BF. The 1st time we came the waitress was nice enough to tell us how incredibly large the portions are so we didn't order too much. The atmosphere is nice, I've eaten both in the back room and the front bar and found them equally appealing. I really want to go for the family style chicken dinner - looks so tasty!",4.0
Loooooove this place. Love how they serve water in empty whiskey bottles. Love the bone marrow (GET IT! So fatty and yummy and perfect with Texas toast). Love the country fried steak (a bit salty but I have low salt tolerance. Gravy and mashed potatoes were so so good). Ahhhhh must go again.,5.0
"Awesome restaurant. I came here with friends and we ate enough food to feed a small country and put me into a coma. I ate so much I almost died. But, I just had to eat it. If you go here, you'll understand.They divide the menu into ""small"" and ""big"" which somewhat matches starters and entrees - however the smalls could pass for a meal for one person, and the bigs can easily be shared by two people. In my opinion, the smalls are also better.They have something called ""Dublin Dr. Pepper"" and if you're a fan of Dr. Pepper you will love it. Also, get the cornbread. Don't question me on this. It is prepared and served in a cast iron pan, with butter and honey.I didn't get or try the salad/wedge, but my friends did and it looked real good.Also, order the mac & cheese. This is not an option! I don't care what meat/carb/fun-free diet or plan you think you're on. It has bacon bits in it. Like I said, I almost died.I'm still working on the bigs. Some friends had the roast half chicken, which looked good, but not quite my style (a lot of white meat). I had the country fried steak. Let me reiterate that it should be shared. Fried steak is not exactly an idea that makes my mouth water, but I ate all of it by myself, so it must have been pretty good as far as that goes. It came with mashed potatoes (good) and cabbage with bacon (not crazy about the greens, but the bacon helped).I washed that down with a chocolate bread pudding dessert, which was also meant for two people to share. I guess it was just one of those days. I planned to take half of it home for later, but I got bored and just kept picking at it until it was all gone. Oh yeah - it was good.I'll add that the restaurant also has a really nice, chill atmosphere, a great place to come with a big group or with a date, or better yet a double-date. The waiters are super friendly, too. A home run.",5.0
"The food is amazing. The drinks are great. Our waiter was incredible with our huge group. The atmosphere is perfect. Only complaint is I know if i go back with a smaller group there will be a crazy wait because they don't take reservations for smaller parties, but that is just a testament to how good it is.Everything is really great, but I'd highly recommend the brussel sprouts, country fried steak, and biscuits.",5.0
"Nice place. Their cornbread is hands down the best cornbread I've ever tasted! I can't say much else in terms of their food. I'm sure everything is great but it's a pretty pricey joint. I just stopped in here with friends for some drinks and bar food (mostly because a friend said their cornbread was fantastic) and it's not that kind of bar/restaurant. If you're looking for low key food, this is not the place.",3.0
"I love this restaurant. The front is casual bar +food, and the back is a surprisingly light and airy restaurant. Totally feels like the South, or as close as you can get in Brooklyn. I had a sweet tea sour which was very sweet, but all the drinks and beer looked good. We shared a salad and jalapeno cornbread to start, both which were basic but delicious. I had the meatloaf sandwich which was AMAZING - thick pullman bread, perfectly cooked and seasoned meatloaf, tangy slaw, and homemade potato chips. mmmm so good, can't wait to go back! My date had the trout which he liked, but was overshadowed by the smoky crispy onion rings on the side. I wanted to try the bread pudding but was too full...Great vibe, great food, and get the meatloaf sandwich!",4.0
"This is one of my favorite neighborhood spots! As others have mentioned, the big plates are BIG, like feed 3 people big. I usually stick to the small plates. I love the kale salad and brussel sprouts. The meatloaf sandwich is huge, but really, really tasty. I always get the cornbread with bacon and jalapeno. Be prepared to wait about 20 minutes for the cornbread. If you want to use it as a starter, be sure to tell the waitress/waiter that you want your food AFTER the cornbread. Otherwise, they usually bring it out at the same time. Also, the bar rocks, and they have an awesome whisky and scotch selection!The only drawback (and it is really minor): The dining area can get LOUD at times. I think it's just the acoustics of the place. So, be aware that you might be struggling to hear your dining companions if you go during a particularly busy time. I usually go during the quieter hours or stick to the bar area, so it doesn't bother me that much.",5.0
The T-bone steak dinner is humongous and divine. *(check my picture for proof!) The twice-baked potatoes (2 come with it) were the best I've ever had. Also had an app of fried green tomatoes that were cooked with duck confit. Nice space with savory twists on old favorites. I will be back soon!,5.0

"Last February Joaquin Baca's year-old restaurant Brooklyn Star burned down. In retrospect that wasn't such a bad thing. For one, we gained Best Pizza, which took over the old space (plus the same serious wood burning oven), and sometimes comes scarily close to fulfilling its bold moniker.The other benefit is that Brooklyn Star, which reopened in March and whose menu has been updated, but still features a heavily Brooklyn influenced take on classic Texas favorites, is now in a much larger space on the other side of the expressway. This is both an asset and a curse. The interior is oddly bland, with green and white walls and wooden tables and floors. If it weren't for the obligatory hipster waifs you wouldn't know this is Williamsburg. There's a sense of humor though, with a nod to Chuck Norris and a declaration on the menu that the Fritos are sourced from Plano, Texas.On to the food...Our buttermilk biscuits arrived first. They were fine, but hardly memorable, with the buttermilk providing a background tanginess and leaning towards the buttery side (especially when I slathered on even more butter).In contrast, the two cornbreads served in iron skillets were fantastic. The jalapeno bacon cornbread in particular was straightforward yet delectable, especially the browned edges.No one could say a bad word about macaroni and cheese with bacon, sufficiently creamy with macaroni that had just the right amount of bite.Dr. Pepper Ribs may have come into contact (or been in the same room) with the cult soda at some point, but I couldn't detect it. Still, the ribs were tender and moist without being cooked too long.Our obligatory vegetable dish: brussel Sprouts with ham, apple and spicy chow chow. The brussel sprouts were not caramelized enough for my taste, but went over well with the rest of the group. I say either embrace their rawness or go full-caramelization, don't try to please everyone (sorry, I'm clearly particular about the doneness of my brussel sprouts).The arrival of our fried pig tails with hush puppies signaled our transition into the deep-fried portion of the evening. Many people were disappointed with the tails, claiming they didn't have enough meat on them (I think people were expecting oxtail). Instead, the thin tails had crunchy fried meat adhered to the cartilaginous bone, like the bark on a dry rack of ribs.Fried Sweetbreads with hominy and ramp mayonnaise was easily my favorite dish of the evening (and most everyone else's). Displaying deep skills with a deep fryer, the large pieces of tender veal sweetbreads were as well fried as the kernels of hominy (can you still call hominy a kernel?). The hominy didn't need the mayo, as it was impossible to resist on its own (OK, a squirt of lime helped too). I have a can of hominy at home and I'm making them ASAP or demanding that more (or any) bars serve them.The last and largest dish to arrive was Country Fried Steak with mashed potatoes and hot slaw. Topped with a creamy gravy, it was difficult to get a full bite of steak without the shell of breading falling onto my plate. Once I managed to mash everything together in my mouth, the flavors were solid, if a little conventional. However, I did appreciate the hot slaw, a favorite of mine that I haven't seen on many restaurant menus.I'm not sure whether it was lack of motivation or enthusiasm of our options, but we passed on dessert. Overall, our group of 7 managed to spend slightly over $20 apiece (without alcohol)-- a good value, but probably skewed by our size.So now all is well in the universe. A disaster spawned Best Pizza and Brooklyn Star has been reborn, slinging Texas inspired cuisine deep in the heart of Brooklyn.",4.0
"I like this place a lot, but I don't quite love it. The texas toast is amazing, so is the chicken fried steak and the kool aid. A lot of the other dishes are hit and miss. I wish they did some more straight up BBQ here but I'll have to settle for the rest of their dishes. Prices are a bit expensive but the service is good and the space is nice. Brunch is pretty solid as well.",4.0
"Three stars for the Star! The Star is a restaurant that offers Southern-style cooking by way of Brooklyn. Take traditional, substantial Southern food, add a pinch of decidedly non-Southern accents - kale, tripe - and you'll end up with the Star's menu.All the food my friend and I had was good. We started with some buttermilk biscuits, which we were feeling more than the cornbread, and were well-rewarded by our decision: warm, doughy, crumbly, yeah yeah yeah mmmbiscuit.Soon out came the veal sweetbreads, a delicate dish that comes with kale, mushrooms and very finely-cut sweet potato fries. The mushrooms/kale imparted a nice earthy, moist flavor, which was complemented by the ever-so-slightly-salty fries. Although it was pretty good and I appreciate the nuances, despite the language I used I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it; however, if the mood hits, scratch that itch (ok, I just wanted to say that. Did James Brown ever use that in a lyric? I'll assume he did).For main courses we ordered the roasted  1/2 chicken and the country fried steak. When the chicken arrived I was pleasantly surprised to see that by  1/2 chicken they meant the bottom half of the chicken - thighs and drumsticks from both sides - instead of the traditional half chicken I was expecting, because dark meat is so much more flavorful and moist than white meat. The side I tried was roasted well and tasty but the side my friend had was undercooked and noticeably pink. The rice was a good side - the ham, apple and kale in it kept it moist and interesting. The country fried steak was the better choice - fried, flavorful, fatty and other good words that begin with the letter f (I'll give you a minute to think about it). The mashed potatoes were made with enough buttermilk and salt to make even the strictest carb-counter swoon and I was down with the hot slaw (I'm not the biggest fan of cold slaw but this was good).The prices seem to have some Yelpers riled up, which I'm not sure I get. It's not cheap and it costs more than what you would usually get in the neighborhood, but it's not excessively pricey. The small plates are reasonable, but the big plates range from $15-$30 (and some of the ones for two are even pricier), so if that's north of your expectations - plus a bread and a brew and it can add up quickly - then you might want to sit this one out. It's a good meal, and worth trying at least once, but not necessarily going out of your way for again unless you're really keen for some haute Southern cookin'.I had a really tough time deciding whether to award the Star three or four stars. I'd give the sweetbreads a three, chicken, three and a half (ignoring the cooking mishap), and steak, four, which puts the average squarely at three and a half. Nothing else - service, atmosphere, price, etc. - really stood out one way or the other, and while the footnote on the menu - see the picture, it's hilarious - almost pushed me toward a four, it was ultimately the lack of desire to go out of my way to come back that wrestled me back to a three. Give it a shot and let me know what you think![Note: Yelp added a Hipster choice to its Ambience category. Check!]",3.0
"This is my first time to the new Brooklyn Star since the old one burned down a few years ago. This new location is at least four times the size, it's really very spacious. The food is still southern inspired and well prepared but something has changed. I went for a weekend brunch and ordered the biscuits and gravy. This is a dish of theirs I used to rave about but it just wasn't the same. The portion seemed a little smaller, the big white plate seems less rustic, and they now top the biscuits with cheese which is good but unneeded and takes away from it somehow. The dish seemed a tad too buttery and there wasn't enough sausage. Despite the few downfalls it was still delicious, just not to the degree I remember it being. I like the new space and their menu and despite not being blown away I'll be sure to come back for a few more meals to try more of their southern fare.",4.0
"In short: Decent enough food, but menu is fairly limited. Good service.Service started out friendly, and the restaurant was somewhat busy when we arrived. It took awhile for the waitress to acknowledge us, but completely understandable given that it was a Saturday night. After we ordered, it took over an hour for our food arrive, but they sent over complimentary appetizers while we waited, which was awesome (their kale and summer squash appetizers). I ordered the mac and cheese and jalapeno cornbread, while my boyfriend ordered the chicken-fried steak. The cornbread came out really really early in a cast iron skillet, even though I had requested that the cornbread be brought out with my entree (they were able to do this for other side orders...). It tasted good enough, but I like my cornbread with a crispier top, and this could only be described as mushy--almost like a sponge cake. Also, the jalapeno and bacon were just lining the bottom of the bread pan instead of mixed throughout the cornbread. Not sure if it's just the style or due to the Saturday evening rush.The kale and summer squash appetizers were quite nice, though I wouldn't have ordered them had they not been complimentary because they were somewhat pricey and small. The real disappointment was the mac and cheese, since I had seen many reviews raving about it. It was so bland, despite the presence of miniscule amounts of bacon bits. I've had much much better mac and cheese even in this same neighborhood (Dumont!!). But, for a $9 entree, you can't really gripe all that much.My boyfriend's chicken-fried steak was quite good--very tender and with the right amount of breading. The stand-out for me was the cabbage cole slaw--more of a vinegar-y base than mayonaisse-y base...yum! I didn't have any alcoholic drinks, but that was mostly due to the limited beer menu and the fact that we were out with a group and trying to minimize the headache of calculating my share. The cocktails looked like they could be good.Overall, decent restaurant, but not one of my top 10 (or 20) even in Williamsburg.",3.0
"I love when places are ""dialed in"": pay attention to and nail various details, big and small, about their presentation. The Brooklyn Star is dialed in from the food, the drinks, the decor, the waitstaff. I had the romaine salad, jalapeno bacon cornbread, and meatloaf sandwich. Really yummy stuff. I wasn't a huge fan of the mashed potatoes being on the meatloaf sandwich itself and had to add ketchup for flavor, but to each is own. Loved the mason jar glasses, the beautiful plants, the light fixtures and the wait staff was attentive. Also, the dishes are moderately priced. The giant meatloaf sandwich was only $10, big pan of cornbread $5 and the salad $8 or $9.mmmm I'm hungry again just thinking about it.",4.0
"Going to go with 4.5 stars here!  Given that the health department made a surprise visit that night I no doubt believe that the place is as wonderful to eat at when the boyz in suits are back in their offices doing what they do best...but they are not about the food, too bad for them because Brooklyn Star is QUITE about the food!  I have to say in recent memory it was one of the best, most satisfying meals!  The dining room is decorated in a retro slash homey style with herbs in the windows and flowers all about.  Add that to the great staff and already the night was looking great!The cornbread is a good place to start...both on the menu and on this review....seems like a lot of places are bringin' it back and of a lot of the places I've experienced it (Red Rooster, Recette...) are not doing it so well...i'm from South Carolina and i've had a few pieces of corn bread... and Brooklyn Star's version is no BS...lol...its on the crumbly side with a nice corn flavor and heat heat heat.  Good job guys!As for the rest...we had the quail, chili and bone marrow.  The bird was excellently stuffed, a great size portion to share.  Cooked on the lovely side of medium and the accompaniment chorizo was purrfect.  The chili with tripe was equally good, maybe a stretch for some as trip has a texture not loved by all, but if you like tripe you'll LOVE the chili.  Finally the bone marrow...whats not to love...pure fat on bread...the life giver smeared on bread...if you dont love it you haven't lived.Great job guys...I'll be back for sure!",4.0

Overall, our group of 7 managed to spend slightly over $20 apiece (without alcohol)-- a good value, but probably skewed by our size.So now all is well in the universe. A disaster spawned Best Pizza and Brooklyn Star has been reborn, slinging Texas inspired cuisine deep in the heart of Brooklyn.",4.0
"I like this place a lot, but I don't quite love it. The texas toast is amazing, so is the chicken fried steak and the kool aid. A lot of the other dishes are hit and miss. I wish they did some more straight up BBQ here but I'll have to settle for the rest of their dishes. Prices are a bit expensive but the service is good and the space is nice. Brunch is pretty solid as well.",4.0
"Three stars for the Star! The Star is a restaurant that offers Southern-style cooking by way of Brooklyn. Take traditional, substantial Southern food, add a pinch of decidedly non-Southern accents - kale, tripe - and you'll end up with the Star's menu.All the food my friend and I had was good. We started with some buttermilk biscuits, which we were feeling more than the cornbread, and were well-rewarded by our decision: warm, doughy, crumbly, yeah yeah yeah mmmbiscuit.Soon out came the veal sweetbreads, a delicate dish that comes with kale, mushrooms and very finely-cut sweet potato fries. The mushrooms/kale imparted a nice earthy, moist flavor, which was complemented by the ever-so-slightly-salty fries. Although it was pretty good and I appreciate the nuances, despite the language I used I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it; however, if the mood hits, scratch that itch (ok, I just wanted to say that. Did James Brown ever use that in a lyric? I'll assume he did).For main courses we ordered the roasted  1/2 chicken and the country fried steak. When the chicken arrived I was pleasantly surprised to see that by  1/2 chicken they meant the bottom half of the chicken - thighs and drumsticks from both sides - instead of the traditional half chicken I was expecting, because dark meat is so much more flavorful and moist than white meat. The side I tried was roasted well and tasty but the side my friend had was undercooked and noticeably pink. The rice was a good side - the ham, apple and kale in it kept it moist and interesting. The country fried steak was the better choice - fried, flavorful, fatty and other good words that begin with the letter f (I'll give you a minute to think about it). The mashed potatoes were made with enough buttermilk and salt to make even the strictest carb-counter swoon and I was down with the hot slaw (I'm not the biggest fan of cold slaw but this was good).The prices seem to have some Yelpers riled up, which I'm not sure I get. It's not cheap and it costs more than what you would usually get in the neighborhood, but it's not excessively pricey. The small plates are reasonable, but the big plates range from $15-$30 (and some of the ones for two are even pricier), so if that's north of your expectations - plus a bread and a brew and it can add up quickly - then you might want to sit this one out. It's a good meal, and worth trying at least once, but not necessarily going out of your way for again unless you're really keen for some haute Southern cookin'.I had a really tough time deciding whether to award the Star three or four stars. I'd give the sweetbreads a three, chicken, three and a half (ignoring the cooking mishap), and steak, four, which puts the average squarely at three and a half. Nothing else - service, atmosphere, price, etc. - really stood out one way or the other, and while the footnote on the menu - see the picture, it's hilarious - almost pushed me toward a four, it was ultimately the lack of desire to go out of my way to come back that wrestled me back to a three. Give it a shot and let me know what you think![Note: Yelp added a Hipster choice to its Ambience category. Check!]",3.0
"This is my first time to the new Brooklyn Star since the old one burned down a few years ago. This new location is at least four times the size, it's really very spacious. The food is still southern inspired and well prepared but something has changed. I went for a weekend brunch and ordered the biscuits and gravy. This is a dish of theirs I used to rave about but it just wasn't the same. The portion seemed a little smaller, the big white plate seems less rustic, and they now top the biscuits with cheese which is good but unneeded and takes away from it somehow. The dish seemed a tad too buttery and there wasn't enough sausage. Despite the few downfalls it was still delicious, just not to the degree I remember it being. I like the new space and their menu and despite not being blown away I'll be sure to come back for a few more meals to try more of their southern fare.",4.0
"In short: Decent enough food, but menu is fairly limited. Good service.Service started out friendly, and the restaurant was somewhat busy when we arrived. It took awhile for the waitress to acknowledge us, but completely understandable given that it was a Saturday night. After we ordered, it took over an hour for our food arrive, but they sent over complimentary appetizers while we waited, which was awesome (their kale and summer squash appetizers). I ordered the mac and cheese and jalapeno cornbread, while my boyfriend ordered the chicken-fried steak. The cornbread came out really really early in a cast iron skillet, even though I had requested that the cornbread be brought out with my entree (they were able to do this for other side orders...). It tasted good enough, but I like my cornbread with a crispier top, and this could only be described as mushy--almost like a sponge cake. Also, the jalapeno and bacon were just lining the bottom of the bread pan instead of mixed throughout the cornbread. Not sure if it's just the style or due to the Saturday evening rush.The kale and summer squash appetizers were quite nice, though I wouldn't have ordered them had they not been complimentary because they were somewhat pricey and small. The real disappointment was the mac and cheese, since I had seen many reviews raving about it. It was so bland, despite the presence of miniscule amounts of bacon bits. I've had much much better mac and cheese even in this same neighborhood (Dumont!!). But, for a $9 entree, you can't really gripe all that much.My boyfriend's chicken-fried steak was quite good--very tender and with the right amount of breading. The stand-out for me was the cabbage cole slaw--more of a vinegar-y base than mayonaisse-y base...yum! I didn't have any alcoholic drinks, but that was mostly due to the limited beer menu and the fact that we were out with a group and trying to minimize the headache of calculating my share. The cocktails looked like they could be good.Overall, decent restaurant, but not one of my top 10 (or 20) even in Williamsburg.",3.0
"I love when places are ""dialed in"": pay attention to and nail various details, big and small, about their presentation. The Brooklyn Star is dialed in from the food, the drinks, the decor, the waitstaff. I had the romaine salad, jalapeno bacon cornbread, and meatloaf sandwich. Really yummy stuff. I wasn't a huge fan of the mashed potatoes being on the meatloaf sandwich itself and had to add ketchup for flavor, but to each is own. Loved the mason jar glasses, the beautiful plants, the light fixtures and the wait staff was attentive. Also, the dishes are moderately priced. The giant meatloaf sandwich was only $10, big pan of cornbread $5 and the salad $8 or $9.mmmm I'm hungry again just thinking about it.",4.0
"Going to go with 4.5 stars here!  Given that the health department made a surprise visit that night I no doubt believe that the place is as wonderful to eat at when the boyz in suits are back in their offices doing what they do best...but they are not about the food, too bad for them because Brooklyn Star is QUITE about the food!  I have to say in recent memory it was one of the best, most satisfying meals!  The dining room is decorated in a retro slash homey style with herbs in the windows and flowers all about.  Add that to the great staff and already the night was looking great!The cornbread is a good place to start...both on the menu and on this review....seems like a lot of places are bringin' it back and of a lot of the places I've experienced it (Red Rooster, Recette...) are not doing it so well...i'm from South Carolina and i've had a few pieces of corn bread... and Brooklyn Star's version is no BS...lol...its on the crumbly side with a nice corn flavor and heat heat heat.  Good job guys!As for the rest...we had the quail, chili and bone marrow.  The bird was excellently stuffed, a great size portion to share.  Cooked on the lovely side of medium and the accompaniment chorizo was purrfect.  The chili with tripe was equally good, maybe a stretch for some as trip has a texture not loved by all, but if you like tripe you'll LOVE the chili.  Finally the bone marrow...whats not to love...pure fat on bread...the life giver smeared on bread...if you dont love it you haven't lived.Great job guys...I'll be back for sure!",4.0
"Generally speaking it's a nice place ... take away the standard and not surprising air of  brooklyn hipster ... our server is bright and kind ... the hostess was a bit snarky .. Yeah, you with the hat ... if you dont want me to sit side by side with my fiance then dont put me at a 6 top bench ... I mean come on ... your policy?  Its 9 on a Thursday night and half of your room is empty ...for real... don't seat us at a 6 top ... or make it work .. as any skilled restaurant employee would do. The food was delicious thankfully -- the celery root salad was fresh and crisp and by far one of the best I have ever had the pleasure of enjoying. As this place goes, we had to have the shrimp and grits and chicken fried steak. Both divine. I did wish they had a better beer selection -- especially since my first and second choices were not in stock ... end of the day, it was a good meal -- except for Snarky McSnark at the door ...",4.0

"Best brunch I've had in ages. I got a head-start on one of my 2013 resolutions, which is to eat in other burroughs more often, and it was splendid. Brooklyn Star is across the street from the Lorimer St stop off the L train, which makes it a cinch to find. Word to the wise - get there when they open at noon, so you don't have to wait, and can start your delicious feast earlier. I opted for the chicken and waffles, which blew me away. Chicken is perfectly crispy, as are the waffles - there's also a hint of lemon in the waffle batter, which was the shiz.

"Two girlfriends and I walk in on Sunday afternoon around 5pm for an early dinner, but dinner does not start until 6.  That's fine, we sit at the bar and have drinks before dinner.Bloody mary- one of the best i ever had, with pickled green beans and just the right amount of acid and spice. I tried some other drinks.. the sweet tea sour and dr pepper cocktail, both were a bit too sweet for my liking.  I advise you not to order these if you do not like sweet.  Dinner was at 6, cute atmosphere, homey..southern.. comfortable.  We decided not to do the chicken dinner (only available on sunday&monday) only because it was our first time and we wanted to order off the regular menu.. See what they got.Cornbread, needed to be seasoned.  Texture was spot on, and came out steaming hot and fluffy.. but the seasoning did not live up to expectations.  It simply was not..corny (?) enough.  and needed more salt or sweetness.  It was just missing something.Fried brussel sprouts, delish.   I'm a huge brussel sprouts person, HUGE.  Probably my favorite vegetable.  Fried is my favorite way of eating them too.  The ham was sort of unnecessary i think.. and could have used more acid.  But all in all, it was cooked really well, so I'm not complaining..Fried pigtails, my favorite of the night!  SO DAMN GOOD~~~  LOVE!.  I can eat 10 portions of this, because it's THAT good, not because i'm a fat monkey bear.Country fried steak.. hmm... mediocre.  I don't mean to be so critical but the gravy was just way way too thick.  At one point, i couldn't even tell if it was gravy or mash potatoes i was dipping the steak in.  I hate when that happens.  Also it's similar color and it's dark in there..so how am i suppose to know?  Eventually I just started eating everything mixed together.  I also hate when i cut into the steak, the whole meat comes out of the fried batter.  I know it's country fried steak and sometimes that's just the beauty of it.. but STILL!!!  i'm picky.  But it was crispy and stayed that way for a while which I like..  and the mash potatoes were so yummy and seasoned so nicely.  The short rib dish was mediocre too.  There was just too much meat compared to sauce.  I don't like when the meat, sauce ratio is too imbalanced.  I mean, when I eat all the sauce and still left with a huge chunk of meat, there's a problem there.  Also, there was nothing special about it.  It was just... blah, no significance.  I don't remember much about it at all. (cept the meat and sauce ratio issue)We decided to skip dessert and grab turkey hoagies and ben&jerry's mint chocolate cookie from our local bodega.  All complete with shots of don julio.",3.0

Even the mac & cheese is cooked with bacon by default (but you can order it without bacon, no problem). There's a kale salad in there too (good if you like raisins) and a garden salad. Anyway: Meat. Couple friends of mine who felt adventurous were really stoked on the marrow. Couple friends who were feeling ambitious ordered the chicken fried steak, which is gigantic -- surprisingly, one of the less pricey main entrees on the menu. Comes with mashed potatoes and onions, and it must've been like a foot in diameter on the plate. Very impressive. I had two friends who split a pork chop (comes with onion rings stacked on top, very visually appealing) and got by just fine (add a few slices of jalapeno corn bread -- very fresh, right out of the oven). Oh, yeah, about the mac & cheese -- it feels really decadent, but that orange-brown crust of cheese around the edges is so worth it. Overall, the menu's a bit pricey, but you can probably get away with splitting an entree with someone else and still be full, if you're not a complete glutton. However, complete gluttons are in a pretty good place here.",4.0
"So happy to be there on opening night, although the restaurant looked packed on the days leading up to their opening. I was so impressed with everything that hit our table last night. Based on the old location reviews, we were going with a past reviewers star system as follows: the jam, monster jam and the motherfucker. So here you go: Oysters: the jam. i liked them, but I wish I could have tasted more of the oyster. The vinagrette was a bit overwhelming for me. Cornbread: Monster Jam! Not too spicy and super hot in that skillet. Brussel Sprouts: Monster Jam! I have never met a sprout i don't like but these were cooked perfectly. I almost wanted to lick the bowl. Dr. Pepper Ribs: Motherfucker! These were like delicious, like so delicious. Cooked perfectly and the sauce was mucho bueno. Loved it. I had this as my main dish and it was more than enough. Chocolate Bread Pudding: Totally a motherfucker. You have to have this. And as of right now it's the only dessert on the menu, so really..you have to have this. Other things my table enjoyed / Devoured: The Chicken..word was a total motherfucker. The meat was cooked perfectly. The country fried steak and the trout: devoured. I didn't see one last drop on the table of food. The only weird thing was that I ordered two small plates for my entree. Those came first and everyone else's meals came about 20 minutes later. Sort of awkward for them to all sit there and watch me eat and then for me to sit there and watch them eat. Then coming back together to enjoy the bread pudding together. The space is a total motherfucker!",5.0
"A few days ago, a friend had told me that a new restaurant was opening around this area, so when I read that tonight was their official opening night, I decided to check it out.  I have not been to the previous location, so I'm unable to compare it with this new location.Had the following:-Cornbread with bacon and jalapeno - delicious and not that spicy.  Had a nice kick to it.-Half rack Dr. Pepper ribs- ribs were cooked just right; the meat was moist.  The Dr. Pepper sauce was awesome with the ribs.-Roasted brussel sprouts- It was too salty for me eating it by itself; but if you eat it with the cornbread, it wasn't bad at all.-BBQ catfish-  by the time this dish came along, we were pretty stuffed by the dishes listed above (these dishes were considered small; the catfish was considered as a large dish).  I really liked the pickled beets that came with the catfish and the catfish itself wasn't bad; if I wasn't as stuffed as I was, I probably would have enjoyed the catfish more.  The onion rings that came with this dish was pretty tasty.  I'm not a big fan of onion rings, but I liked theirs.  It had a nice bacon/smoky taste to it and it was crispy. I was pleasantly surprised how spacious the restaurant was.  When we first walked in, I thought that the space was just the bar only.  But a split second later, I saw that they had a back room too, which was the actual dining area. Just a head's up that if you have a small party (i.e. just a party of 2), you might end up sharing a table with other small parties.  .  Overall, I enjoyed my meal tonight.  I would come back here again to try out the other items in their menu.",4.0

"Amazing! That word aptly describes both the food and the dining experience. My buddy and I came up here from philly to visit a friend and he recommended this place. Needless to say, being a big fan of southern style cooking, I was pretty excited. When you first walk in, you are in the bar area. I was pleasantly surprised by the craft beer and wine selection. And we only had to wait a few minutes before we were able to sit down. The back dining area has a quaint feel to it. Perfect atmosphere for a fun first date or just hanging out with friends. The wait staff are hipsters but apparently the whole neighborhood is. Even so they were both very friendly and attentive.Now we get to the best part..the Food! We wanted to try a little bit of everything so we started off with the kale with fried cheese. It was light and sweet. Very good. Next we had the mac n cheese with bacon. Not being a huge fan of mac n cheese, this was by far the best I've had. We sampled the pig tails and sweetbread tacos. Not knowing what they were, I scarfed them both down. After finding out what they both were, I was glad I didn't know. They were both very good esp the tacos. We also had the hot wings, some green bean casserole looking dish and oysters. I was waiting for one dish to come out that I didn't rave about but I'm still waiting. Sounds like a whole lot of food but its family style and everybody is sharing which is different but fun. For the main course, I had the strip sirloin which was done perfectly, medium rare and my buddy had the meatloaf sandwich. He is still raving about the sandwich. All in all, I wish this place was in philly. I wouldn't go anywhere else. P.S. I've read the other reviews. I don't understand how some people didn't like it. It really is an amazing dining experience",5.0
"Whoa! This place is awesome.  Everyone was genuinely friendly and outgoing.  Everything we ordered was fantastic.  Two thumbs up on the bone marrow, the mac and cheese, jalapeno and bacon cornbread (smothered in butter of course), and the meatloaf sandwich.  There was even enough food for lunch the next day.  I'll be back!",4.0
"I'm a big fan of this place, but the experience I had today required a short review. Yes, today is the day Sandy ended, and few places were open. We went by around 3:30 after GrubStreet wrote Brooklyn Star would be ""finished brining chicken by the time we read this,"" and were told that the kitchen would open at 5pm with a limited menu. We put in our name at 6:15 for a table of 3. The quoted wait time was 20 minutes.After 20 minutes we were half way through our first round of drinks at the bar, the bartenders, after waiting a long time to get an a drink order in, asked us if we wanted to order food, we said we were waiting for a table. After 40 minutes we were told that our table was still not ready, and that the restaurant was out of all food except for 3 items on the menu. Needless to say, the three of us were a bit disappointed that after waiting twice the quoted wait time all the food we were looking forward to was gone. We totally understood that today was a unique circumstance given the weather, and understood that things would not be normal. However, the fact that we were asked if we wanted to order multiple times at the bar without warning that food might run out, and that the hostess didn't tell us there would be a chance of such a limited menu until we had waited 40 minutes was a big let down. I want to be a fan of Brooklyn Star, but the bartenders and hostesses really let us down by not waring us that the food supply was limited, and that the wait would be longer than quoted. We checked in with the hostess table once every 10 minutes, and never did we get a warning about food running out. Brooklyn Star. Nor did the bartender say anything. After sitting inside for two days, we were just excited to be at a restaurant, and the bar was set pretty low, but the staff found a way to underperform. We waited almost an hour, only to leave and eat dinner somewhere else. Maybe think twice before waiting for a table here.",3.0
"Its a nice dimmed candle light dining and bar area. The menu is very limited for dinner there isn't much of a selection and I was craving some buttermilk biscuits but they were all out of it. There was a very loud table with about 10 people in it and I mean they were super loud I don't know what was in there drinks or they were that happy to be there but it was very irritating at moments and people would even stare at them and give dirty looks cause it was just out of control especially the young lady who kept saying she wanted shots and to hook up with her boyfriend all night, TMI thanks. I ordered the chicken and it was a pretty big plate so I say you can share it, we also ordered the corn bread which really didn't have much of an taste to it even with the butter on it I didn't taste the corn part. I enjoyed the mac and cheese which had bacon on the bottom which tasted really good and I enjoyed the fried pork tails too those were good. I hear the brunch is much better so I might try that out next time, but the hostess and waiters were very nice and I enjoyed the decor and atmosphere but I think the food selection could be a lot more and hopefully its not as loud and obnoxious full of people like that night and get to try out the biscuits!",3.0
"Two girlfriends and I walk in on Sunday afternoon around 5pm for an early dinner, but dinner does not start until 6.  That's fine, we sit at the bar and have drinks before dinner.Bloody mary- one of the best i ever had, with pickled green beans and just the right amount of acid and spice. I tried some other drinks.. the sweet tea sour and dr pepper cocktail, both were a bit too sweet for my liking.  I advise you not to order these if you do not like sweet.  Dinner was at 6, cute atmosphere, homey..southern.. comfortable.  We decided not to do the chicken dinner (only available on sunday&monday) only because it was our first time and we wanted to order off the regular menu.. See what they got.Cornbread, needed to be seasoned.  Texture was spot on, and came out steaming hot and fluffy.. but the seasoning did not live up to expectations.  It simply was not..corny (?) enough.  and needed more salt or sweetness.  It was just missing something.Fried brussel sprouts, delish.   I'm a huge brussel sprouts person, HUGE.  Probably my favorite vegetable.  Fried is my favorite way of eating them too.  The ham was sort of unnecessary i think.. and could have used more acid.  But all in all, it was cooked really well, so I'm not complaining..Fried pigtails, my favorite of the night!  SO DAMN GOOD~~~  LOVE!.  I can eat 10 portions of this, because it's THAT good, not because i'm a fat monkey bear.Country fried steak.. hmm... mediocre.  I don't mean to be so critical but the gravy was just way way too thick.  At one point, i couldn't even tell if it was gravy or mash potatoes i was dipping the steak in.  I hate when that happens.  Also it's similar color and it's dark in there..so how am i suppose to know?  Eventually I just started eating everything mixed together.  I also hate when i cut into the steak, the whole meat comes out of the fried batter.  I know it's country fried steak and sometimes that's just the beauty of it.. but STILL!!!  i'm picky.  But it was crispy and stayed that way for a while which I like..  and the mash potatoes were so yummy and seasoned so nicely.  The short rib dish was mediocre too.  There was just too much meat compared to sauce.  I don't like when the meat, sauce ratio is too imbalanced.  I mean, when I eat all the sauce and still left with a huge chunk of meat, there's a problem there.  Also, there was nothing special about it.  It was just... blah, no significance.  I don't remember much about it at all. (cept the meat and sauce ratio issue)We decided to skip dessert and grab turkey hoagies and ben&jerry's mint chocolate cookie from our local bodega.  All complete with shots of don julio.",3.0

"There are so many amazing restaurants in Brooklyn, unfortunately this is not one.  I have been here twice and the first time I was underwhelmed and just assumed I would not go back.  However, my friend had his birthday party there so I decided to go and give it another shot.We had the prefixed menu which basically meant that we paid $65 for kool aid, roman leaves with something like a ranch/caesar, mac n cheese (which was good but to be fair there are 5 places within 1 block that have amazing mac Dumont) the worst chicken wings I have ever eaten (and the primary reason I am writing this to ensure nobody else eats them accidently) and shrimp and grits that were just so mediocre it sealed the deal that i had to write my first negative yelp review.I use yelp all the time and don't like when people tare places apart because of one thing.  So I will add the service was not good (it was family style and they auctioned off food - just put it down we are eating the same thing) and the back room booths make it seem like you are at an upscale chilis or something.  You can do a lot better for the money in the neighborhood.",2.0

After waiting for there food to arrive it was kinda cold. The shrimp and grits were bland and the shrimp was under-cooked. The masa cakes and chorizo were inedible. The cakes were as hard as a rock and cold. Dinner is great, brunch was horrible.",3.0
"There are so many amazing restaurants in Brooklyn, unfortunately this is not one.  I have been here twice and the first time I was underwhelmed and just assumed I would not go back.  However, my friend had his birthday party there so I decided to go and give it another shot.We had the prefixed menu which basically meant that we paid $65 for kool aid, roman leaves with something like a ranch/caesar, mac n cheese (which was good but to be fair there are 5 places within 1 block that have amazing mac Dumont) the worst chicken wings I have ever eaten (and the primary reason I am writing this to ensure nobody else eats them accidently) and shrimp and grits that were just so mediocre it sealed the deal that i had to write my first negative yelp review.I use yelp all the time and don't like when people tare places apart because of one thing.  So I will add the service was not good (it was family style and they auctioned off food - just put it down we are eating the same thing) and the back room booths make it seem like you are at an upscale chilis or something.  You can do a lot better for the money in the neighborhood.",2.0
"Mac n Cheese - very nice crunch / crust at the top. Corn Bread w. Jalapeno Peppers ...wow, very nice between the sweet and hot. Roasted Chicken with lemon slices baked under the skin with a hint of honey outside adds a very nice flavor. Only down side was the beet salad was sold out, only thing I missed was some more vegs with my meal.",3.0
"Played it safe and had the chicken which was good, plus some cornbread which was sweet...or maybe that's because of all the honey I dripped all over it.What ever, I'd go back.",3.0
"The new Brooklyn Star on Lorimer is opening on Wednesday and after getting a early taste of the food and a look at the inside I am very excited to keep coming back. They've got all the great food of the old star with a bigger space and a full bar. Food to try: Bacon Jalapeno Cornbread, Mac n' Cheese amazing The Dr. Pepper ribs and Bacon Trout was something I have never seen and was glad to try it. Can't wait to go back to sample more things off this menu.",5.0
"UPDATE: Bumped up a star. I've been back, always on par with my first experience. Oh, they have oysters too, until 2am!So, to my new neighbor I will say that I look forward to adding a couple stars once I've been back.Overall, I think that this is a great spot to go with a couple of friends if you are all looking to gorge on southern food (& all that comes with it), reasonably priced drinks, and soak in the friendly atmosphere.When ordering dinner, keep in mind that you'll probably be sharing plates with the table ""family style"". So don't freak out when you first see the prices - it all makes sense in the end. We tried a bunch of items (4 people) and with 1 drink each our bill came to about $25 (or less) per person. Chicken-fried Steak: Awesome. I'll come back for this. Obviously not the most ""healthful"" choice, but the meat melts in your mouth and was a totally new culinary experience for me.Brussels Sprouts: Very tasty. Some sort of apple thing was at play here to good effect.Cornbread (w/ jalepeños): Cooked to order in a small iron skillet. Frankly, I could have done with out this because. . .Buttermilk Biscuits! - This is what I'll REALLY be back for. So crusty, flaky, and soft on the inside. For me, perfect biscuits - I love em.Mac & Cheese (w/ Bacon) - Another no-brainer. Its kind of hard to screw this up.My major contention with the place at this moment in time is that the dining room can be very very loud. If you are not in the mood to be screaming across the table, you might want to keep this in mind. I am hoping that they will soon take note and install some paneling in the vaulted ceiling to help diffuse the cacophony of sound. Oh, I'll be back. Probably more often for drinks and a tidbit, and hope that the Star will continue to serve me well!",4.0
"The first time we stopped in for a drink at Brooklyn Star it was the first day they were open in the new space (previous space burned down). Night of Joy was a shit show so we roamed around and wound up stumbling into Star because it was just dark and quite enough for a conversation with friends. A classy night of perfect sazeracs and martinis ensued making catching up nearly too sentimental. The place just brings it out of me. So here's what you're going to do. On your first visit you'll have the meatloaf sandwich and a Manhattan. Your second visit should be for brunch, where you will have their shrimp and grits and a bloody bull(x3?). Come back late on a thursday night after you've had your fill somewhere else and have their sazerac. Shuffle and repeat this process over and over again until you've had everything on the menu. The place is a safe bet for a great night, afternoon, morning. Star is one of my favorite places to not get fucked up at, where I can sit down and simply enjoy other people's company.",4.0
"5 stars for the terrific food and 1 star for the amazingly awful service. So I did the math and averaged it to 3 stars. I hate doing that but the service was really that terrible. And I am not one who is overly needy or complains at all.I came for brunch and had to wait around 15 minutes. First of all, make sure to take a few aspirin before you come because this is the loudest restaurant I've been to. I'm talking last 2 minutes of the Super Bowl loud and the losing team is driving down the field for the title.I have to say I don't care for the setup. There are some communal tables and a lot fo bench like seating where you can just get thrown in with random strangers, which is awkward for a solo diner. Once it was time for me to be seated, they sat me at a table with another couple. It felt really weird and I can tell they were uncomfortable having a stranger sit with them as was I. Not sure why they couldn't just wait for one of the tables meant for one person to open up. I mean there were plenty of them available after I was seated but I didn't want to request to move and make the situation even stranger. And to top it all off I sat there fore 10 minutes before anyone came to even take my order.When it came time for me to order I told the waitress I wanted to start with the cinnamon bun and then have the chicken and waffles and a side of mac n cheese. Her eyes popped out of her head and she said ""that's a lot of food!"". I was like yeah thats ok. And then she proceeded to repeat my order, screaming it (since it was so loud) in front of the couple I was sitting with and making a stupid face while doing it.I'd estimate a good 15 mins went by and still no cinnamon bun in sight. I called the waitress over to make sure she knew I wanted it first and not everything at the same time. She replied nastily they come out when they're ready there is no order.. and ""ummm I think the mac will come out first because it went in the oven already"". Umm what?? You're telling me the kitchen doesn't know how to time dishes so they come out properly? I told her to forget the cinnamon bun if that was the case but she ran to the kitchen to tell them and came back to let me know it was would out first.The cinnamon bun came out HOT and sizzling in a cast iron skillet. At this point I was ravenous so I devoured the whole thing. It was pretty good, lots of cinnamon, some chopped pecans inside, but much of the frosting was sitting around the bun instead of on top. I mean it's tough to mess up cinnamon buns. I just wish there was a little more frosting but a nice sweet start to whet the appetite for what was to come.As I was halfway done with the bun, the mac n cheese comes out. OK, no big deal. I figure it's just a minute before the chicken and waffles hits the table too so I can enjoy both. NOPE. Another 20 mins passes. No chicken. Waitress is absentee. When I finally get her attention to make sure they didn't forget the chicken, she says ""oh no they didn't, the thought you want it after the mac and cheese"". OMG. At this point, I literally just shook my head at her and told her I intended to eat the mac n cheese as a SIDE to the chicken not as a mid course. Of course, 2 mins later comes the chicken and waffles, which couldn't be a coincidence. I mean they really have to do a better job coordinating between servers and the kitchen. I'm sure people order appetizers, then main courses with a side all the time. Maybe it was just too loud for her to comprehend my actual intention when ordering.The mac and cheese was amazing. Again, hot, bubbly cheesy gooey and pieces of bacon throughout. Topped with breadcrumbs to make it crunchy. This was everything a mac and cheese could be. I just wish I wasn't forced to be almost half of it before my main came.The chicken and waffles came out a bit cold (hmm wonder why, sitting under a heat lamp?). But still, wow this is a great rendition of the classic dish. Super crispy, moist, perfectly seasoned fried chicken. I requested dark meat but was told they serve it as a combo of dark and white- ok thats fine. I got one leg and one breast with the wing attached so I guess it was more like 2 and a half pieces of chicken. The waffle had a slight lemony taste and was great at sopping up the syrup. Overall, the food here is pretty special, large portions, and prices are very reasonable. Despite my waitress' disbelief at the ""large amount of food"" I supposedly ordered, I pretty much cleaned up with the exception of a little of the mac cheesy. It's hard to find great Southern food in NYC but this is a great place. It is a big shame their service is so abysmal and out of sync with the kitchen. I'd love to try dinner, but would only come with a group and hope I don't get the same indept waitress.",3.0

I had the chicken and waffles!  The chicken was so crunchy and moist not that heavy fried taste excellent.  The waffle was also  lite so much flavor. My boyfriend had the scramble eggs and gravy w/biscuits.  He is hard to please when going for brunch he enjoyed it  cleaned plate.  Surprised by donuts with candles served warm fresh  delicious.. The staff  was so nice the hostess said happy birthday  as well as another waitress  and again on the way out. Very sweet. The service was great. We will be next time to enjoy dinner or maybe brunch again .",4.0
"Wine and breakfast food on a late night? Pretty cool. This was a nice atmosphere with dim lights and jazz on the PA. They had fine wine that came at a discount, which seems like they often do for their spirits. I wasn't too enamored with their country fried steak - being a bit flat and the meat detaching itself from the fried bread skin. But I did order the mac & cheese which was excellente. It was cooked with white cheddar along with bread crumbs. This went well with the chardonnay.",4.0
"Great southern cooking with a twist.  It seemed like everything had a bacon element to it, so bacon fans are definitely welcome !The atmosphere is cozy and loud soul music added to the freshly fried an baked food that is served beautifully.  The CORNBREAD is amazing.Good times and good food, yes !

"This place is sooo adorable, have been wanting to come here forever and finally had the chance to come.There was a bit of a wait during for brunch, I think we waited about 30 minutes so by the time we were seated we were starving so we quickly breezed through the menu and placed out order.After waiting about 20-30 minutes, we thought our food should've been delivered since people that were seated after us were being served their food....the waiter came by and said it's on it's way but it still took a while.  I literally think she forgot to put our order in so I was not happy about that.  She did end up comping our coffees when she brought out the bill, knowing she screwed up.Finally the food arrived, I ordered the apply johnny cakes with jalapenos and bacon...my pancakes barely had any jalapenos or bacon in it....but I guess since it's only $0.50 extra you shouldn't expect too many jalapenos/bacon to be mixed into the batter...just little itty bitty specs.  I have to say it was a fairly large dish for just $12...you definitely get your money's worth, nothing special though.This place is definitely worth giving a second try... maybe my second review will be a little less sour then this one.",3.0

"Went to the Brooklyn Star this past weekend with moderate expectations.  We ordered about half of the items on the menu (far too much btw).  Overall it was just OK.  Let me break it down a bit.Wings - Good, not great.  I would have preferred spicierCornbread - Very good.  I recommend this oneSummer squash casserole -- no good.  Strange consistency.  A bit runny. Weak flavorGreen bean casserole -- One of the highlights.  If debating between the squash and green bean casserole DEFINITELY choose this oneDr. Pepper ribs -- eh.  OK. Not that tender and the flavor just wasn't that greatMeatloaf sandwich -- Mixed feelings across the table, but this was one of my favorites.  This is a meal in itself.Mac and cheese -- I thought it was very good with a little hot sauce.  Feeling was not matched across the entire table as some thought the flavor was a bit strange.Chicken fried steak -- By this time I was really too full to even eat much of this.  I took a taste.  The mashed potatoes were pretty good.  The chicken fried steak was average.  By this time I wanted to go home and do some jumping jacks though.In general this place is just OK, and in a neighborhood where there are so many excellent options I won't finding myself going back.  If you want the best southern food go to Pies and Thighs (although the menu is much more limited there).",2.0
"Sooo... I don't usually write reviews but I had such a good experience that I had to share!The Brooklyn Star has an amazing atmosphere!

Practically everyone who walked by our booth greeted us.Our server came over immediately to ask if we wanted cornbread since it's made to order and takes about 15 minutes. We got a skillet of the regular cornbread & the jalapeno/bacon cornbread... it was so light and fluffy... and delish!My friend was so happy they served kool-aid and my boyfriend loved the iced tea - which were served in mason jars.I had the meatloaf sandwich because for some reason I craved meatloaf after walking into the dining room. It was great! The meatloaf was crispy on the outside, topped with mashed potatoes & lettuce with a tangy dressing on slightly toasted & buttered thick bread. I ate half the sandwich and was totally full but it was sooo good that I ate the other half as well. It came with a side of homemade chips and a pickle. Not bad for 9 bucks!My boyfriend gave the country fried steak a ""f*ckin' awesome"" review which means a lot since he's a picky eater.All in all, 2 orders of cornbread... some non-alcoholic & alcoholic drinks... some small & big plates... and an order of bread pudding to share and the bill was just under $20 a person for 5 people (not including the tip).A++ will be visiting often!Hopefully a brunch menu will appear as well :)I heard they make apple pie skillets in the summer -  CAN NOT WAIT!",5.0
"Good food. I enjoy the tripe chili served with a bag of Fritos, though it might benefit from some scallions & cilantro on top. Mac & cheese with bacon is very good & served in a small skillet.

The $76 Rib Eye meal for two was not as much food as you should have gotten for such a price. The potatoes were good, but the cauliflower was dry and the rib eye had so much toppings you couldn't taste the steak, and it just was so bland.

"Really a darling place and a terrific find! We were driving through Brooklyn looking for early dinner and yelp search revealed to us this place. Upon walking inside I knew it was the right place for me. Absolutely adorable ambiance - dimly lit, romantic, solid wood tables in the bar area and in the back of the restaurant. We weren't too hungry so we just ate:- biscuits and butter- mac and cheese with bacon (comes without it too for the vegetarians)- fried pig tailsEverything was truly scrumptious. To be honest, after eating that first biscuit with butter, I knew this place was special. Biscuit lovers will understand: these biscuits were the warmest, softest most delicious biscuits i've ever tasted in my life. The butter was creamy and perfect and the two together were just delightful.The mac and cheese was really tasty, creamy but not too creamy, and the bacon was a perfect touch.I personally didn't love the pig tails but I know other meat eaters will enjoy them - fried crispy and pretty good with hot sauce.LOVE this place and can't wait to go back to try other entrees!!!",5.0

"Brooklyn Star - what not to expect: traditional Southern food. This is ""nouveau Southern"", or something, mixed with ""new American"" and a bit of gastropub, I guess. Anyway, they have pork chops with spaetzle, and bone marrow, and mac and cheese. The pork chop / spaetzle dish is delicious, and the mac and cheese is very good - it has more of a cheddar bent than the one at Dumont (theirs is heavier on the gruyere).The shrimp and grits were a miss - the grits were bland and the shrimp tasted like a gas grill. Maybe they were just having an off night, but that was the one misstep, food-wise. Their Old Fashioned is made with Peychaud's bitters instead of orange bitters and Angostura - it isn't as good as the Old Fashioned at Rye, but it is good, and pretty inexpensive at $9.Seating - there are two areas, the dining room and the bar. My choice is the bar area. The dining room has been finished in the prevailing Williamsburg style - all hard surfaces. It is very difficult to carry on a conversation, because of the din caused by no sound dampening surfaces and everyone's volume constantly going up because no one can hear anyone else over the other conversation and the music.Also, the dining room features communal seating. I'm not a fan of this trend - I live in NYC, I spend most of my day having to overhear my fellow citizens' conversations. I don't want to also be subjected to them while I'm eating dinner. It would be one thing if this was a true barbecue joint, but they have $25 and up entrées here. The tables are small picnic-style, and they'll put 6 people at a table, which means you'll be pretty close, probably literally rubbing elbows with the person you're communally sitting with.The bar is quieter, and the bar stools at least allow for establishing a minimal amount of personal space.I'll definitely be heading back for dinner at the bar, I'm sure they will keep getting better.",3.0

"I went here on a weekend for a couples night around 7pm and fell in love with this place.  I am from the south and know good southern food and this place comes close.  The skillet cornbread was fantastic and the pig tails appetizer has a savory sauce but the tater tots were over done, they tasted burnt, I had the Mussels with smoked sausage and pinto beans, may i suggest getting an order of Texas toast to dip in your sauce as a treat for finishing your bowl.  The rest of our table had the country fried steak, not as big and crunchy as in the country but still really good, and the molasses porkchop, to die for!!!! All this went well with the 3 Dr. Pepper cocktails I had.  We all shared a chocolate bread pudding for desert, once again slightly overdone.  Out waitress was so polite and helpful and we stayed so long that the hostess had to ask us for our table because a line was forming to get in.  All in all I would definitely come back!",4.0
"I'm gonna drink the Brooklyn Star haterade. Now, I came for brunch, and I have heard that the dinner is way better. I have mixed feelings about their ""absolutely no substitutions"" rule. I get it, but.... it just seems kinda harsh. I don't know. But I get that the chef wants to maintain the integrity of the dish he/she created. Moving on... the brunch menu is so unbelievably heavy. Everything is just sauced or fried or buttered to the max. We got some of the baked goods to start and they really were delicious, albeit so indulgent... the donuts were delicious but just dripping with oil... same with the cinnamon roll but it was oh so wonderful. The best thing I had. But after eating all those fried pastries, I couldn't bring myself to order a platter of french toast or fried corn cakes, so I ordered yogurt with granola and berries. I know, what a nerd, and it was actually good... I just wish they would have had some kind of omelet or something more healthy, or that you could do substitutions to get that omelet... anyway. The reason this place is getting 2 stars is because I polled my 5 other brunch companions, who are well aware of my affinity for Yelp, and asked them what they would give this place out of 5 stars, and everyone said 2 or 3. So I decided on a 2, because that's how I feel. Sorry Brooklyn Star, but I'd love to come back for dinner.",2.0
"Okay I already give it a star for being steps from the lorimer and metropolitan stops.  We managed to beat the Friday night rush getting in at 8.  First up drinks, which are reasonably priced at $7-9. I had the gin Rickey, a no nonsense gin, lime and soda.  Delish!  We shared the Brussels sprouts and the cornbread with jalApeno and bacon.  Dude only 50 cents more for heat and salty meaf.  I a spicy sensitive gal but the corn beard comes with a honey bear which help me cut the heat.  I got the meatloaf Sammy which I liked.  I didn't know that they would put in the mash in the sandwich so that was a extra pleasant surprise.  The bread was a thick cut of fluffy and chewy carb.  I had a bit of my friends shrimp and grits, which was good.  The sweetness of the shrimp added to the grits.  I also had me some of my other pals Mac n cheese. it was cheesy and crunchy since they baked in a skillet. We shared the apple tart which was nice with the cider molasses.  Otherwise it would have been pretty standard.  For price and location, this place can't be beat.",4.0

"This is my favorite restaurant in New York! SOOOOOO delicious!  I love both breakfast and dinner, but if I had to pick, I would go for breakfast.  I love their Johnny Applecakes with bacon and jalepeno and their cinnamon role is perfect, not overly sweet.  For dinner, I usually get the chicken fried steak but the chicken breast is good too if you are looking for a healthier alternative.  Their mac and cheese and their corn bread are spectacular.  I am not a big drinker but I always get a mixed drink whenever I go.  They are all amazing, breakfast or dinner.  Definitely check it out.",5.0
"i've been to the brooklyn star twice and both times were just ok. the menu has so many interesting dishes, but nothing left me wanting more. of the things i've tried - the wings, the pig tails, the grilled asparagus, the bone marrow, the country fried steak, the 1/2 chicken, and the dr. pepper ribs (used to be on their summer menu) - i would say their homemade jalapeno cornbread is the only thing i would go back for. i don't think i'll be going back any time soon, but i think it could be a fun experience for people who want to try something a little different.",3.0
"Sunday brunch is a must!This was my first visit back to Brooklyn Star since the closing of their other location- due to a fire :(The new place is amazing. They have everything going for them- most important: consistent food quality, friendly-attentive staff and great atmosphere. What else do you need?We decided to sit at the bar (beautiful classic design) since there was a wait for the MDR. And around 1pm they eventually started to serve food at the bar. Upon arrival, the humongous Bloody Bull Mary's were flooding over our heads and of course we couldn't resist. They were absolutely delicious. Perfect harmony of spice, hardy stock and pickled string beans for garnish....yummmm! Patiently waiting for Fried Chicken with waffles and Shrimp Grits, we admired the décor and the bartenders doing their magic. Every dish was amazing and the chicken well......perfection!Staff was very friendly even though they were very busy. They knew how to handle the crowd. I strongly recommend sitting at the bar :) very nice experience.",4.0

I love that everything is sharable, it keeps the bill lower (prices are very reasonable) and you get to try so many different and wonderful dishes. Safe to say I'll be going back for more!",5.0
"I went here on a weekend for a couples night around 7pm and fell in love with this place.  I am from the south and know good southern food and this place comes close.  The skillet cornbread was fantastic and the pig tails appetizer has a savory sauce but the tater tots were over done, they tasted burnt, I had the Mussels with smoked sausage and pinto beans, may i suggest getting an order of Texas toast to dip in your sauce as a treat for finishing your bowl.  The rest of our table had the country fried steak, not as big and crunchy as in the country but still really good, and the molasses porkchop, to die for!!!! All this went well with the 3 Dr. Pepper cocktails I had.  We all shared a chocolate bread pudding for desert, once again slightly overdone.  Out waitress was so polite and helpful and we stayed so long that the hostess had to ask us for our table because a line was forming to get in.  All in all I would definitely come back!",4.0
"I'm gonna drink the Brooklyn Star haterade. Now, I came for brunch, and I have heard that the dinner is way better. I have mixed feelings about their ""absolutely no substitutions"" rule. I get it, but.... it just seems kinda harsh. I don't know. But I get that the chef wants to maintain the integrity of the dish he/she created. Moving on... the brunch menu is so unbelievably heavy. Everything is just sauced or fried or buttered to the max. We got some of the baked goods to start and they really were delicious, albeit so indulgent... the donuts were delicious but just dripping with oil... same with the cinnamon roll but it was oh so wonderful. The best thing I had. But after eating all those fried pastries, I couldn't bring myself to order a platter of french toast or fried corn cakes, so I ordered yogurt with granola and berries. I know, what a nerd, and it was actually good... I just wish they would have had some kind of omelet or something more healthy, or that you could do substitutions to get that omelet... anyway. The reason this place is getting 2 stars is because I polled my 5 other brunch companions, who are well aware of my affinity for Yelp, and asked them what they would give this place out of 5 stars, and everyone said 2 or 3. So I decided on a 2, because that's how I feel. Sorry Brooklyn Star, but I'd love to come back for dinner.",2.0
"Okay I already give it a star for being steps from the lorimer and metropolitan stops.  We managed to beat the Friday night rush getting in at 8.  First up drinks, which are reasonably priced at $7-9. I had the gin Rickey, a no nonsense gin, lime and soda.  Delish!  We shared the Brussels sprouts and the cornbread with jalApeno and bacon.  Dude only 50 cents more for heat and salty meaf.  I a spicy sensitive gal but the corn beard comes with a honey bear which help me cut the heat.  I got the meatloaf Sammy which I liked.  I didn't know that they would put in the mash in the sandwich so that was a extra pleasant surprise.  The bread was a thick cut of fluffy and chewy carb.  I had a bit of my friends shrimp and grits, which was good.  The sweetness of the shrimp added to the grits.  I also had me some of my other pals Mac n cheese. it was cheesy and crunchy since they baked in a skillet. We shared the apple tart which was nice with the cider molasses.  Otherwise it would have been pretty standard.  For price and location, this place can't be beat.",4.0
"Wonderfully crispy chicken skin, oysters with bbq sauce were a hit as were the pillowy biscuits. That's right, they were pillows. We wished for cloth napkins,  but other than that our server was tattooed and perfectly lovely.",4.0
"I've been here twice before and both times were great, but last night I finally had the Sunday Night Fried Chicken Dinner.  It is the BEST fried chicken I have ever had in my life.  Not to mention the bacon mac and cheese and mashed potatoes that comes with it.",5.0
"This is my favorite restaurant in New York! SOOOOOO delicious!  I love both breakfast and dinner, but if I had to pick, I would go for breakfast.  I love their Johnny Applecakes with bacon and jalepeno and their cinnamon role is perfect, not overly sweet.  For dinner, I usually get the chicken fried steak but the chicken breast is good too if you are looking for a healthier alternative.  Their mac and cheese and their corn bread are spectacular.  I am not a big drinker but I always get a mixed drink whenever I go.  They are all amazing, breakfast or dinner.  Definitely check it out.",5.0
"i've been to the brooklyn star twice and both times were just ok. the menu has so many interesting dishes, but nothing left me wanting more. of the things i've tried - the wings, the pig tails, the grilled asparagus, the bone marrow, the country fried steak, the 1/2 chicken, and the dr. pepper ribs (used to be on their summer menu) - i would say their homemade jalapeno cornbread is the only thing i would go back for. i don't think i'll be going back any time soon, but i think it could be a fun experience for people who want to try something a little different.",3.0
"Sunday brunch is a must!This was my first visit back to Brooklyn Star since the closing of their other location- due to a fire :(The new place is amazing. They have everything going for them- most important: consistent food quality, friendly-attentive staff and great atmosphere. What else do you need?We decided to sit at the bar (beautiful classic design) since there was a wait for the MDR. And around 1pm they eventually started to serve food at the bar. Upon arrival, the humongous Bloody Bull Mary's were flooding over our heads and of course we couldn't resist. They were absolutely delicious. Perfect harmony of spice, hardy stock and pickled string beans for garnish....yummmm! Patiently waiting for Fried Chicken with waffles and Shrimp Grits, we admired the décor and the bartenders doing their magic. Every dish was amazing and the chicken well......perfection!Staff was very friendly even though they were very busy. They knew how to handle the crowd. I strongly recommend sitting at the bar :) very nice experience.",4.0

"The tripe chili was unbelievable.  Deep layers of flavor.  The roasted marrow bones? Unctuous. Especially with their upscaled version of Texas Toast. A 5-star for the appetizers. I ordered the root beer ribs.  They were very good, but I still smoke better ribs at home.  To get a 5-star on ribs from me, you have to be somewhere between mine and those of Black's Barbecue or Smitty's Market in Lockhart, TX.  Nevertheless, I liked the atmosphere, the communal seating, the drink selection, and the thought and innovation that went into the menu offerings.",4.0
so good. the bloody bull is amazing. I had brunch there-- chicken & waffles! and urhm... the sandwich stuff. but CHICKEN & WAFFLES. soooo-x crispy and super delicious!,5.0
"Delicious food but I enjoyed the old menu better. Now the sides are fixed to your main and the small plates are much more expensive. Before you could go in and drop fifty for a good meal. Now expect 100. That being said we had the jalapeño cornbread, chorizo stuffed quail, the grilled asparagus and the country fried steak. All top notch.",4.0
I had the fried oyster tacos and green bean salad with fried pig ears last night. Both were amaaaazing. My friend had the chicken fried steak and it was huge and delicious. I have been here twice and definitely recommend the food. It's really decently priced as well. :D,5.0
"My son lives in Manhattan and he suggested Brooklyn Star for Dinner.  All 3 of us thought it was great.  First the bar tenders and the drinks are fantastic: my wife has the Sweet tea sour, my son the Spicy Margarita and I had a Smokey Old Fashioned.  All three were unique and great.  We then went to the dining room and ordered a mixture of items from the menu: Mac and Cheese-most Excellent, Meatloaf Sandwich was great, the chicken fried steak was superior as was the bacon jalapeño corn bread, beet salad and Romaine wedge.  For dessert we had the churros, these are not the churros you find at the mall, these we crispy and were accompanied with a spiced chocolate sauce.   The staff was very nice and extremely competent.  I would highly recommend this place!",5.0

"would give this a 3.5 star rating.not that i had a bad meal, but it wasnt amazing and probably is over rated. not to mention that they had something that was listed as a $49 short rib on the menu. it is meant for one person (i asked). i dont think it could be anything other than a massive typo.",3.0
"Brooklyn Star is great.. fresh home cooked food, beautiful atmosphere and friendly staff. I've been a bunch of times during different hours of the day/night and have always had an awesome experience. I recommend the Ommegang on draft, and the family style chicken dinner is perfect for 3!",5.0
Stopped in for a drink today.  The drinks were delicious and reasonable.  The bartenders were great and even introduced themselves...  I'll definitely be back to try the food.,4.0
