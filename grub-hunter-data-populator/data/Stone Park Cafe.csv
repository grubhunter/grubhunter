I went here this past weekend and the buttermilk pancakes were some of the best I have ever had and the side of bacon was perfect as well. My girlfriend had the Pan Seared Bluefish Cakes and she loved them too.Service was excellent and I will definitely go back for more.,5.0
"Came here because it had really good reviews for a brunch place in Brooklyn. The service here was ok. We had to keep asking for stuff and the waitress at one point rolled her eyes. (That's not our fault we have to keep asking) We ordered fries for the table and that came out like when we were half way done eating, so pointless to order fries at that point. I got the fried oyster with an omelet and it was ok. Nothing exceptional. My friends got the Cobb salad and they said that was really good. Overall, I'd say it's meh. There's way better brunch places in Brooklyn.",3.0
"Usually when I Yelp a restaurant I focus on the actual product the restaurant is offering me, sometimes an amazing restaurant has one server who is having an off day and you get that person. That is not the restaurants fault, and should be looked over.  However this is not the case with stone park cafe. I've dined there about 5 times over the past few months and every time the service is atrocious. Each time we waited well over 10 minutes for a waiter to show up and ask us if we would like a beverage. Three of the past times the waiter did not even mention the specials, we had to askUsually during a nice meal one like to lounge, enjoy a cocktail, appetizer then a meal. However that is not what stone park cafe has in mind. They allow you one cocktail per meal, the waiter will show up take your full order, disappear until it's delivered, disappear until you're finish, show up again and ask if you need anything else. No matter if you spent your entire meal wishing you had another glass of wine (Happened), more water (Happened) , they've forgotten a side (happened)   or the meal was prepared completely wrong (happened multiple times!)Looking past the atrocious service, SPC has decent food. If you catch them on a good night. Each time I come I usually get the same dish, the mushroom pasta and my date gets the Arctic char. EVERY TIME these dishes have been prepared differently. The mushroom pasta comes with pine nuts, if I ask for them to be left off them are most definitely on. We still can not figure out how the Arctic char is actually served because sometimes the sauce is on the side, unless you've made a special request for it on the side, in which case it's served over the char.I wish this restaurant was better, I do. It's convenient and (occasionally) delicious. But like a bad relationship you have to know when to call it quits.",3.0
"So we came in here yesterday to celebrate my wife's birthday! I was very pleased overall with my experience dining here but here's the breakdown:Service: very on point! They were very attentive from the moment you walk in, very accommodating with seating preferences and very polite staff throughout the whole dinner.Decor: very romantic lighting, dimmed with candles, tall stem glasses for everything, window seating available; pretty nice date spotFood: here's where they dropped the ball a bit.. I ordered the burger which came out and was very visually appealing but when I bit into it.. I got a headache from the amount of salt that went into seasoning the burger.. And of course the ketchup didn't help. My wife got the chicken breast which was cooked very well; meat was very tender and fell off the bone, chicken wasn't overcooked and seasoned perfectly! The pasta served on the side wasn't so great as the consistency of it wasn't. The bread they served was pretty good with the butter. We ordered two sides as well: onion rings and truffled mashed potatoes. The onion rings were on point, very soft, crispy, ""buttery flakey"" taste to it but I'd skip the mashed potatoes; tasted like a pre-mix type of deal. Definitely try their bacon wrapped scallops! They were perfectly cooked; wifey loved them!Overall, I'd say it's a pretty decent place to dine in Park Slope!",4.0
"Hubby and I are agreeing that overall, Stone Park Cafe earns a rating between 2.5-3.  The service was very good, and they had a cute outdoor dining space (we went during the summer time).  The venue is clean, and the food is tasty.  Cons include: Small portions, higher than average price tag, and unappetizing appetizers. Overall, we really don't recommend Stone Park Cafe since the food quality doesn't match the price point charged.",3.0
"Pleasantly surprised that there was no wait for brunch on a Saturday around 10:30 am. It was a gorgeous day so we sat outside. The service was excellent. The menu is interesting and unique, with many fantastic options.  We tried a few dishes and all were delicious and filling. Highly recommend the eggs benedict, the spicy omelet, the short rib hash and the bluefish cakes. All come with toast and crispy potatoes (ask for their salamander hot sauce - so good!). And the poached/over easy eggs were all cooked perfectly. Will definitely be back!",5.0
"Stone Park Cafe is one of the very first restaurants brunch adventures began with my fiancé years ago. Why did it take us so long to come back? Was it the long wait, the need to try new types of food and cuisines, or because we simply forgot? SHAME ON US. We rolled by the neighborhood and began to reminisce of our old brunch stomping grounds.Short Rib Hash & Eggs $14 - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! The braised short rib simply is delicious. The meat was tender, succulent, and flavorful. Brunch satisfaction guaranteed!! I wish there was more ribs because it was just that good.Buttermilk Biscuit $3 - Homemade with a buttery and flaky crust. Perfection. Goes great with the jam. Atmosphere was excellent for families and friends. There is outdoor seating on the sidewalk if weather permits. Great food, great service, & will be back soon. This is the ideal brunch spot you need to try.",5.0
"I've been here 3 times, twice for dinner once for brunch, I think I will come back again, it's just that good.Let me tell you, the scallops on bone marrow and that squid ink pasta, are the best of Park Slope, especially that bone marrow taco, with avocado and cilantro, sea salt and pan seared scallops, are the perfect match. I don't even like tacos but this is perfect. The squid ink pasta is basically squid ink fettucine, cooked to the point that is neither too overly done or not-quite-so-well-done, I prefer my pasta chewy, but cooked well, if you know what I mean, the seafood on top of it, notably the shrimps are so good. This is better than what I had in Venice, Italy. We also ordered hanger steaks, it's cooked medium rare, so tendered as well, the flavor melted in my mouth, the sauce was homemade, was not bloody or commercial-sauce flavored, my guy friend who had recently been to Peter Luger's said that Stone Park Cafe served better steak. Word. For brunch, I vaguely remember ordering egg bennies, because they are all to my brunch preference, I always try egg bennies at brunch spots. This was pretty amazing, my parents loved their omelettes and toasts too, service is always excellent, it's very easy to make reservations as well. You must go.",5.0

"I adore this place! I've been here twice for Sunday brunch and it's definitely worth a visit to Park Slope. My only complaint (and even then, not much of a complaint) is that this place only has one host to take down names for tables and to call you if there's an availability, which makes walking in hoping to be seated way awkward. Waiters pass you by and totally ignore you until you get a table. But the wait isn't usually long so it's like 5-10 minutes of awkward standing.I've gotten the Cobb salad here twice and it hasn't disappointed. Something about it is just so refreshing and delicious. The portion size is just right, too. Fresh squeezed fruit juice tops it all off, for a picturesque meal.",4.0
"Popped in here on a Sunday post-Turkey day. All I wanted was anything but Turkey ... no goddamn turkey. Thankfully Stone Park stepped up with a fine array of brunch options. I will warn anyone coming on the weekend - this place is packed - and you will be dodging means moms on the street with their aggressive strollering. I mean it is Park Slope so sanctimonious mothers are to be expected. We got there at 12:30 and were seated by 1pm - which I think is impressive given the interest/line. On to what's important team, I went with the classic Eggs Any Style. I got the homemade sausage and it was phenomenal. I mean just not too much oil, but all that glorious spice that wakes you up will tickling your hunger buds (yeah ... tickling ...)My friend though got the Short Rib Hash & Eggs, and having tasted it, I know that's going to be what I get next time around. IT WAS AMAZING! It took all that I had not to tackle her to the ground and then eat her meal. GET THIS DISH!

"Although this place is known for the food, I have to give it up to the person responsible for the playlist. Old-school hip hop and feel good jams help the delicious food go down.My second time here and it did not disappoint. This place gets packed for brunch on a Saturday afternoon but we were seated right away and had very attentive and quick service the entire time. I ordered the quiche with salad on the side. The salad came with marinated tomatoes and a lemon vinaigrette that was delicious. The quiche was warm and moist. Hats off to the pastry chef. Made with cheddar and mushrooms, it was flavorful and fluffy. We split a side of the grits (without shrimp) and that was the only disappointment. They throw a poached egg on top and garnish with scallions. If I had known this, I would have asked the waiter to hold both. It seems that the scallions and egg were added to give more flavor to the grits because as I ate around them, I realized they were underwhelming. Compared to the grits we had here a few months ago, they lacked the rich and delicious flavor they used to have. Why mess with perfection?We topped off our brunch with fresh squeezed orange juice and the blood orange champagne cocktail. The cocktail was tart and packed a little punch. This place has been here for quite some time and it seems it will remain a staple and neighborhood fave for years to come.",4.0
"I had been meaning to try stone park cafe for a while. I went on a Saturday at about 1:30 for brunch. It was a 20 minute wait so my boyfriend and I ordered bloody Mary's at the bar while we waited.

I would recommend the pan seared bluefish cakes as well as the biscuits and gravy but would steer clear of the short rib hash.

"The most notable thing about Stone Park is its reliability.

"My wife, son, and I lived in Park Slope for 5 months, and this is the only restaurant we attended more than twice. The only disappointment we had was an appetizer we ordered one time, which was a little smaller than we would have liked for the price, although the waiter did warn us ahead of time, so that's on us. Aside from that, this place stands out as our best dining experience in Brooklyn.Stone Park is spacious and has a little bar area where you can also order dinner. There is great lighting inside due to the abundance of large windows, and there is ample outdoor seating as well.The service is excellent, but the food is even better. They offer the perfect amount of choices for dinner - not overwhelming, but enough to satisfy anyone. I ordered the squid ink pasta several times, and it's out of this world. For dessert, their cheese plate offers an assortment of 3 tasty cheeses, all of which are a perfect size and magnificent. The wine list is wonderful and includes a wide variety of half bottles, as well as an entire page voted exclusively to Turley wines, which are hard to beat. The entry level Turley zin is priced at $70, and I've seen it retail for $50, so the mark up is as low as it gets.I highly recommend Stone Park Cafe. Atmosphere and food are A+, service is A, and price is A-. If you're in Park Slope, check it out. You won't be disappointed.",5.0
"My very rare two and a half star review...1. Service was slow and not too attentive.  The wait itself was about 15 min which wasn't so bad for Sunday 12pm outside table.  But once I sat down the server himself took forever to attend to us.  Short staff maybe?2. I got the short ribs and hash with any styles eggs and toast.  It was okay, nothing spectacular.  Thought the plate lacked a little something green or lighter to go with the heaviness of the ribs.From 4 stars on Yelp, my expectations were too high I guess.  Overall, I expected more for what it was....but super great location though esp if you have kids are down to walk around the neighborhood after lunch.",2.0

The gravy was a lot of gravy for the boy, but he loved the combo of sausage and gravy. I was a big fan of the bluefish cakes.

The waiter was great, one star off only due to the fact that there was one waiter for the entire outside area... Took a little while for the food and drinks to come but was not his fault. Over all great place, would like to see more options on the menu.",4.0
"Have you ever had a nightmare where you heard a baby crying, and then you looked around and EVERYONE was pregnant, and there were infants and toddlers EVERYWHERE? That's kind of what happens at Stone Park Café, except instead of a nightmare it's just a really good brunch, and I'm sorry for the mixed imagery.I went for brunch, and put my name on the list at 10 in the morning to try to avoid the wait. Don't do that, they told me. But it kind of worked, because I was able to get a seat within 15 minutes instead of an hour and a half when I came back at 11:20.I got The Chef Omelet (with pico on the side), which came out looking like a bright yellow taco bell burrito and tasted like the exact opposite of what a bright yellow taco bell burrito would (probably) taste like. The sausage inside is amazing, and the eggs and ingredients mix together so well it's almost impossible to not eat the whole thing in less than 5 minutes. We also got the short rib hash with egg, and I'll be completely honest - I have no idea what a short rib hash is. But it's super tasty, and how much do you really care? It was some sort of egg-potato-meat combination that is apparently a thing, and that's good enough for me. Delicious.I have to give it 4 stars because I ate at Montmartre the day before, and nothing could beat that. But it's definitely worth a visit! (Bring your baby repellant.)",4.0
We are normally are anti-brunch diners because of the weak menu choices and overall price gouges but we will make exceptions for Stone Park!  Very creative breakfast menu along a very solid lunch choice.  Impeccable service in a great location.  Do expect an hour wait on Sundays so drop your name and number and grab a takeout coffee and take a stroll on 5th Avenue.,5.0

The only disappointment we had was an appetizer we ordered one time, which was a little smaller than we would have liked for the price, although the waiter did warn us ahead of time, so that's on us. Aside from that, this place stands out as our best dining experience in Brooklyn.Stone Park is spacious and has a little bar area where you can also order dinner. There is great lighting inside due to the abundance of large windows, and there is ample outdoor seating as well.The service is excellent, but the food is even better. They offer the perfect amount of choices for dinner - not overwhelming, but enough to satisfy anyone. I ordered the squid ink pasta several times, and it's out of this world. For dessert, their cheese plate offers an assortment of 3 tasty cheeses, all of which are a perfect size and magnificent. The wine list is wonderful and includes a wide variety of half bottles, as well as an entire page voted exclusively to Turley wines, which are hard to beat. The entry level Turley zin is priced at $70, and I've seen it retail for $50, so the mark up is as low as it gets.I highly recommend Stone Park Cafe. Atmosphere and food are A+, service is A, and price is A-. If you're in Park Slope, check it out. You won't be disappointed.",5.0
"My very rare two and a half star review...1. Service was slow and not too attentive.  The wait itself was about 15 min which wasn't so bad for Sunday 12pm outside table.  But once I sat down the server himself took forever to attend to us.  Short staff maybe?2. I got the short ribs and hash with any styles eggs and toast.  It was okay, nothing spectacular.  Thought the plate lacked a little something green or lighter to go with the heaviness of the ribs.From 4 stars on Yelp, my expectations were too high I guess.  Overall, I expected more for what it was....but super great location though esp if you have kids are down to walk around the neighborhood after lunch.",2.0
"We were seated right away on an early Sunday morning which was great because even at 10AM, it was a full house. It's a small restaurant with lots of cute decor. It reminded me of my own kitchen and I felt really at home.We took a bold dive and ordered the biscuits and gravy and the pan seared bluefish cake. Both were amazing. The gravy was a lot of gravy for the boy, but he loved the combo of sausage and gravy. I was a big fan of the bluefish cakes. I expected them to be like a crab cake...except it was lighter and less sweet. Everything about this restaurant lived up to what I read on yelp and I'm def going to come back to try dinner soon!",5.0
"They allow dogs outside! This was a big deal for us because we were babysitting a sick pup and every place we called in the Brooklyn area said no dogs allowed even outside, so this was very nice of stone park cafe. They were very accommodating to my now gluten free and dairy free diet and made sure we ate right. The waiter was great, one star off only due to the fact that there was one waiter for the entire outside area... Took a little while for the food and drinks to come but was not his fault. Over all great place, would like to see more options on the menu.",4.0
"Have you ever had a nightmare where you heard a baby crying, and then you looked around and EVERYONE was pregnant, and there were infants and toddlers EVERYWHERE? That's kind of what happens at Stone Park Café, except instead of a nightmare it's just a really good brunch, and I'm sorry for the mixed imagery.I went for brunch, and put my name on the list at 10 in the morning to try to avoid the wait. Don't do that, they told me. But it kind of worked, because I was able to get a seat within 15 minutes instead of an hour and a half when I came back at 11:20.I got The Chef Omelet (with pico on the side), which came out looking like a bright yellow taco bell burrito and tasted like the exact opposite of what a bright yellow taco bell burrito would (probably) taste like. The sausage inside is amazing, and the eggs and ingredients mix together so well it's almost impossible to not eat the whole thing in less than 5 minutes. We also got the short rib hash with egg, and I'll be completely honest - I have no idea what a short rib hash is. But it's super tasty, and how much do you really care? It was some sort of egg-potato-meat combination that is apparently a thing, and that's good enough for me. Delicious.I have to give it 4 stars because I ate at Montmartre the day before, and nothing could beat that. But it's definitely worth a visit! (Bring your baby repellant.)",4.0
We are normally are anti-brunch diners because of the weak menu choices and overall price gouges but we will make exceptions for Stone Park!  Very creative breakfast menu along a very solid lunch choice.  Impeccable service in a great location.  Do expect an hour wait on Sundays so drop your name and number and grab a takeout coffee and take a stroll on 5th Avenue.,5.0
"I really love this place. I've come here several times because my friend is quite the regular customer here. Always great service, nice ambiance and definitely stellar food! Favs to order: Bone marrow and squid ink pasta. I recently tried their tempura oysters and those were delicious! YUM.",4.0
"Been here few times, always good. The place as. Area led ambienc, an the staff here are very friendly (although can get slow sometime).

What an exquisite dining experience on Park Slope's 5th ave! The bone marrow taco appetizer was just delightful and quite different from other apps in the city. You could never go wrong ordering their brussel sprout salad either.

"I can't rate the quality of the food because I was overwhelmed by the lack of respect they had for customers. I asked for a table of two. We waited for just a bit and were taken to the back. Where they put us at a rickety folding table. There was an open two seater outside which we asked for but were denied. We sat down and realized we were at the waiters station. So people bumping into us constantly. With the state of the table, there was no way it wouldn't have come toppling over. If they want to fit more people in, get a legitimate table and don't put it in a high traffic area. It's a dismal dining experience and shows a lack of respect for your clientele.  I would be willing to try this place again, the food looked delicious, but they need to work on customer experience before I would.",2.0
"Easily the worst place I've ever been for brunch. Ordered 2 drinks, they only brought us one. Omelette was lackluster could have made it myself and the fucking potatoes? Just a tiny side of them. We also ordered a side of greens and oh surprise they have ham! Great dude! Don't eat meat. Could have mentioned they have ham. Fuck this place. Also usher and 50 cent at 11am? Park slope sucks.

"I was really excited to dine at Stone Park Cafe.  I read all the yelp reviews and was going in with my ""must-have"" list.  Unfortunately the actual experience didn't measure up to expectations.We started off with the lobster bisque and octopus appetizers.  The piece of octopus served in the $16 dollar dish was tiny, but it was tasty.  The soup was fine...For mains we split the lamb and the taglitelle.  I was so excited about the pasta, reading all the reviews and recommendations, i was surprised to find it kind of like a bowl of mush.  No flavor really stood out, and for those calories, i wanted each bite to count.  The lamb for good, nice cooked, good flavor, but not a ""wow"" dish.We ended the night with the chocolate bread pudding.  Dessert is always just ""meh"" unless it's a knockout, and this choice was meh.  It had chocolate, it was warm on a cold nice, but nothing spectacular.Service was good, it's a nice atmosphere, but not sure i would come back unless it was for their $35 dollar market price fixe.",3.0
"When I inspected the kitchen a year ago it was very clean. Surprised It took me so long to try out the food. Since my fellow friend who is a true foodie recommended the biscuit and gravy. I ordered it for the table to share. I was glad I did because it would be an overwhelming dish to consume by yourself. There's two huge biscuits smothered in savory gravy and two eggs any style. This dish is super flavorful and u might end up licking the gravy.I got the bluefish cakes. It was a lil too fishy for my liking. It comes with two eggs, home fries, crunchy cole slaw and toast. I wouldn't recommend this dish when there's so many great options available. I ate a lot of my friends yogurt with granola parfait. It was super delicious and recommended by our friendly waitress. Lots of fresh fruits. And the thick yogurt was sweetened with honey. Hmmmmm healthy and delicious. I highly recommend as while. As a true fattie of course i also tried my other friends short rib hash. It came with eggs and toast. She got the sourdough toast which overpowered the short rib hash. By itself it was very tender but not something I would drool over. Sounds like I ate a lot of food right?!! :T",4.0

It took about another 15 mins for the waiter to come back to us to see what we want to order. We ordered six dishes. It took 20-25 minutes to come. We were like animals eating the food when it came! The poached eggs were slightly too cooked for my liking. Overall the food was good (4/5 stars) but service 3.5/5 stars.",4.0

"I made a reservation for the day after Thanksgiving, which I was surprised at, because I thought they would be crowded. Had a nice table for 6. The staff was great and friendly. There was a prix-fixe meal but I opted to just order a-la-carte, but I did try the salad/etc. that my friends got with their prix-fixe and it was tasty. I ordered the squid ink pasta and let me tell you... I'm still thinking about it. It was perfectly tender and had really fantastic flavor. I'm big on al dente pasta, and the flat linguine just made it all the better (and I'm normally not a linguine fan). I wanted to finish up the entire thing but I was full from Thanksgiving. Spot on.For dessert, I just had a scoop of Mango sorbet and it was just as tasty and so right to end the meal. I did, however, also taste the other desserts on the table.. there was a chocolate lava cake that was good, but the other ice creams were okay. I would stay away from Smokey Chocolate. It's definitely smokey...",4.0
"Had lunch here and was very content. My friend and I shared the grilled baby octopus, squid ink tagliatelle and the swiss chard raviolini. The grilled baby octopus had a very nice soft texture, not the usual super chewiness you would get from eating octopus. The bits of chorizo and the sauce made it all come together very nicely. The tagliatelle had big gulf shrimp and was pretty good, although I did enjoy my raviolini dish a lot more. It managed to get me very full despite its size. I would definitely come back here and try brunch!",4.0

The food was good. I came here for dinner on a Saturday night. It was small in here and was packed but we made reservations and got seated quickly. Parking was easy too on the street.

The brisket was nice and grill topped crisp the way i liked it but it didn't stand out to me. Biscuit was buttery crisp and soft as well. Wonderful biscuit but i've had better. Eggs on the omlette were a bit overcooked but the ingredients of tomato and mushroom were fresh as can be.

It was definitely all very fresh but I just expected something with more flavor than what I received. I wouldn't mind trying them again for dinner sometime but I have plenty of brunch spots where the value, wait time, and quality is better than what I had here.",3.0
This place has a nice vibe and good food. Came for brunch. It's right across the street from a park in case you have kids and are making a day of it.,4.0
Was here for brunch and had the Greek omelette. It was very good! Also check out the beef hash and buttermilk biscuit and gravy. Make sure to get there before 11 am on a weekend. It gets very crowded after 11.,4.0

"Came here for a celebratory dinner with my family on a late Friday night. Service was very nice since they didn't give us an attitude or rush us when we were the last table there. It is very hard for my family to get together for dinner since my parents close shop late. Food-wise it was yummy but the portions are small. I understand that you are ""tasting"" the food but for 15 bucks for apps, I would like more than just 2 bites. Got grilled octopus, fried oysters, short rib sliders and something else (forgot the name). For entree we had lamb chops, steak with onion rings,and the burger and fries. All were good but my fav is the lamb chops, the lamb-y after taste was muted and the mint and spices went well with the meat.",4.0
"today was my first time here, definitely will be back, the portions are not big, but the food was outstanding!!! everything was delicious and just .. right.

"They have the most pleasant, attentive yet non overbearing servers I have ever seen and experienced. They wouldn't make you feel awkward even if you've been waiting for a while :) s/o to the staff!

I tired the roasted chicken which looked perfect, tasted perfect! And I heard that they serve good brunch food here so I'll definitely go back for that. I'd say, this is a promising dinner date spot.",4.0
"Brunch here is amazing.Omelette - Perfectly cooked and comes with a side of potatoes BLT - The fried pork belly is so rich and crispy, and it is nicely balanced with the lettuce and tomatoes as well as a side salad. It was amazing and very filling.",4.0
"Came here for what turned out to be an extremely delicious Saturday brunch. The space is bright and airy with plenty of outdoor seating. My bartender was very sweet and helpful, and while I was waiting for my friend who was running late he gave me an article on the Wu Tang Clan to read so I wouldn't get too restless. Get the blood orange mimosas, so good.I ordered the Spicy Omelet, made with andouille, mushrooms, and pico de gallo (I got it without the pepper jack cheese). This was made really well, and the pico de gallo adds a nice touch. The home fries that came with it were also great. And their bacon. And their pancakes :) No wrong choices here.They were also playing great music.

"For my 100th review,  i want to save it for a 5 star restaurant. Stone Park is that restaurant. I tried coming here several times and the line is always out the door during prime time lunch and dinner. On the day I came, I actually left work early and got here by 6 and they were just filling up. We ordered two pastas, 3 apps, and a bottle of wine. The pastas for perfectly portioned,  the apps were tasty (must try the bone marrow tacos), the bottle of wine which was recommended by our server was great. If fact, we loved it so much we ended up ordering a few bottles once we got home. We can't wait to be back. The service was quick and friendly.  I highly recommend this place.",5.0
Some places just get it. SPC is one of them. Everything from the coffee to the entree was top shelf. The Cobb salad was the best that I have ever had. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and pleasant staff. It was a really pleasant experience.,5.0
"3.5 stars. Came in with a reservation at 5:30 and a lot of the tables were full already. We ordered the scallops and bone marrow tacos, leg of lamb and the black pepper pappardelle. The tacos were pretty good, though I was confused the entire time because I did not see how these were considered tacos. It was only towards the end of the meal that I noticed a few flour tortillas were placed discretely in between a towel on a plate at the far edge of the table. It was partially my fault for not opening it up, but at the same time would have been nice if it had been made more obvious by the waiter that there were flour tortillas in there. The pappardelle was very good, the pasta was fresh and the rabbit was nice and juicy. The leg of lamb was a bit too chewy and overall the dish was not well balanced. It was too dry and I wish there was a little more sauce. Service was a bit slow and difficult to wave someone down to get us our check. Overall not a bad place for dinner, nice and cozy and the food is decent. Would go back just for the pappardelle.",4.0
"A buddy of mine from Brooklyn told me to check this place out for their brunch so I made the trip out for Manhattan. Showed up on a Sunday around Noon and immediately knew we were in for a wait. We put our names/number down and the friendly hostess said we should get a call back within 90 minutes. We wandered around 5th ave for an hour and half without hearing back .. finally we walked back to check in with the hostess and found out she had crossed us off the list after attempting to call us numerous times.. we compared phones and saw no missed calls on my phone and no outward calls on her call..  she apologized and showed us to a table immediately. I had the Short Rib Hash and my boyfriend got the Biscuits and Gravy both were rich, decadent and delicious, exactly what we were in the mood for on a Sunday afternoon. The ambiance was a bit interesting... blaring loud music which would have been one thing if it wasn't all dated cheesy 90 hits from Will Smith, etc...  All in all after we ate we made a speedy exit.  In short, the food was pretty good, but definitely not worth putting up with the hassle of getting a seat and the jumbled ambiance.",3.0

It's a really really small portion.. Honestly, if you love bone marrow as much as I do, I would just get this appetizer for myself. Don't share it lol.

"The first time that I came to this place I had a lovely experience. The food was great and I absolutely loved the bartender. She had an Irish accent and was just the most pleasant woman. That was about a year ago. I recently went there on a weekend and once again sat at the bar as I just find that easier and more entertaining when it is just me and my husband. The bartender, a young guy, was  just terrible. I'm not a big drinker so I don't have my go to drink. Usually I just drink wine. I was craving a cocktail so I went for it. The bartender was not accommodating at all. I ordered an old fashion but did not like it. I asked him to use some more orange bitters to make it a little sweeter. He was just horrible as was the drink. I then told him that the reason I ordered this was because I thought it was like a hawkeye. I asked him if he knew how to make it. I have ordered this drink in the past at Freeman's in the city and they do a superb job at making them. Great place for brunch, by the way! He simply said, ""I don't know that drink"". All I'm saying is your a bartender and should be little more accommodating. Just really unpleasant. Their prices are not cheap to be met with this kind of service. I had the bone marrow tacos and was disappointed. Could be because I just had some great marrow at Duck's Eatery a few weeks before. This didn't come close and missed the mark completely. My husband was not impressed with his dinner selection either. The food was sub par but honestly I think it was the bartender that just made everything that much worst. Then I ask him about the redheaded bartender that I had the first time I came here. He actually says,  ""oh that's actually a wig""! Who says that?",3.0
The food will deserve a 4 stars. I usually enjoy that place for their lunch as much as for the diner menu. Unfortunately this place is part of many other places now who pay no attention to people' comfort or energy waste. It's always freezing by summertime and every year a little more so at the end the  attractive culinary experience turns  into a frigorific torture.,2.0
"Get here early! It gets packed and they don't take reservations. Just took my mom here for an early mother's day brunch and it was excellent. They know what they are doing. My mom had the Hangtown fry, tempura oyster frittata, bacon, Cabbot cheddar dish which she raved about. I had the Short Rib Hash and Eggs with sunny side up eggs and it was delicious. My boyfriend had the The Spicy omelette: andouille, mushrooms, pico de gallo, pepper jack cheese. I always think, how good could an omelette be? It's so simple but my bf said it was hands down the best omelette he has ever had (of course excluding mine). He keeps talking about it and would order the same thing if we go back. That's some strong feelings for an omelete. All I know is Stone Park has this brunch game on lockdown!",5.0

"The first time that I came to this place I had a lovely experience. The food was great and I absolutely loved the bartender. She had an Irish accent and was just the most pleasant woman.

"The number of stars in my rating is an average of my experience and what I observed for the rest of the party of 9 at the table.  While what I saw served and the comments from the others were good, my experience was terrible.

Microwave an omlette??! It only gets worse.  The busboy brought back the microwaved omlette and presented it to my wife; his eyes on David (who was in a corner watching intently) as though the thunder and lightening of David's wrath awaited him if he did otherwise...like apologize.  My wife, who sensed the tension that transpired because of a simple request, told the busboy it's OK, that she'd eat the omlette as it was.  After our meal, we alerted the waitress that though she was awesome, her superior sucked.  He made her look bad.  It was the waitress, and not David, who apologized, seemingly wanting to take the omlette off the bill.  Usually, the manager, upon hearing of an issue with the service, would be the one to inquire with the customers.  But David simply dismissed any concern with, ""Tell 'em I'm busy an' give 'em the damn bill!""  He proceeded to slouch at the bar, singing the lyrics of the gangsta rap songs that were playing, word for word.  Other customers noticed the discrepancy of a so-called ""busy host/manager"" hanging at the bar singing gangsta rap. Perhaps we were ""Punked"".  We awaited Ashton Kutcher or John Quinones to appear with a camera crew, assuaging us that it's OK, we're on an episode of ""What would you do if you encounter the worst host/acting-manager at one of your favorite restaurants"".  When no such thing happened, we tipped the waitress for her lovely service and left.",3.0

"BRUNCH REVIEW:If you can get here at a decent hour (between 10:00 AM - 11:30 AM) you might be able to get a table outside. If you aren't that lucky, the inside decoe is cute and the music is surprisingly good too. I was just really happy to get a table outside so I could bring the dog  to brunch. We ordered eggs benedict on top of a homemade english muffin (no Thomas' english muffins here) with a hint of lemon hollandaise sauce. It was pretty on point. I don't usually like hash, because it reminds me of mushed meat and potatoes, but the short rib hash was pretty good, much better than the normal hash. I'd definitely come back for brunch to try some of their other dishes and can't wait to try their market menu for dinner. My only gripe is that it's pretty expensive for brunch.",4.0

Warm atmosphere.  Bright interior.  Conversation friendly acoustics.  The service could have been a little more attentive.

"BRUNCH REVIEW:If you can get here at a decent hour (between 10:00 AM - 11:30 AM) you might be able to get a table outside. If you aren't that lucky, the inside decoe is cute and the music is surprisingly good too. I was just really happy to get a table outside so I could bring the dog  to brunch. We ordered eggs benedict on top of a homemade english muffin (no Thomas' english muffins here) with a hint of lemon hollandaise sauce. It was pretty on point. I don't usually like hash, because it reminds me of mushed meat and potatoes, but the short rib hash was pretty good, much better than the normal hash. I'd definitely come back for brunch to try some of their other dishes and can't wait to try their market menu for dinner. My only gripe is that it's pretty expensive for brunch.",4.0
"I have never written a Yelp review but feel prompted to this morning because I am so disappointed in this restaurant.  I live very close to Stone Park Cafe and it has long been one of my favorite places to stop in for a late weeknight glass of wine and small plate at the bar.  Last night, a Friday night, I took visiting friends there for dinner.  I have been giving Stone Park the benefit of the doubt for about a year now, mostly because I am hooked on their brussels sprout salad.And, the bartenders are wonderful, so when you sit at the bar you get nice friendly service.However, service at the tables,both indoors and outdoors, at regular dining hours, and especially on weekends, is a completely different story.  There is one waiter who always acts as if he is doing you a giant favor to give you the time of day.  When I see him coming my heart sinks, he is that snotty.  Separate from him, the service is vastly inconsistent, and  the waiters (always waiters, no waitresses to be seen), while sometimes friendly,  are usually sweating, frazzled, and appear to be extremely overworked and really stressed out if it takes you more than a second to order your meal, because so many other people are waiting for them.  Last night we were given water, asked if we wanted to order drinks,  and then, after spending about 15 minutes figuring out what we wanted to eat and drink, sat for another five, ten? minutes, presumably unnoticed, with our menus closed, waiting to be noticed.  I tried to catch the waiter's eyes, because we were very hungry,  to no avail.    Bread brought to the table, a brief nod of acknowledgment , a remark in passing, "" I'll be there right away,""... any of these would have gone a long way.  But he seemed to just have too many tables to deal with to be able to provide these tiny gestures of gracious hospitality.The other issue is the noise level.  It is deafening.  The waiter had to literally scream the specials at us.  We had to shout at each other to be heard across a 4 person table and repeatedly repeat.  It was exhausting.  Stepping out into the din of traffic on 5th avenue afterward was like stepping into an oasis of calm and serenity after the experience at Stone Park.",2.0

"Finally, I get to cross this restaurant off my list as I came here last night to enjoy an evening of delightful ""south beach style"" dinner with a friend.

Having the privilege to sample everything, I have to say, their food was certainly fresh, well prepared, flavorful and their presentation was well presented.All in all, Stone Park Cafe was enjoyable, momentarily, but I can't say the overall experience was memorable.

"The chicken's name was Colin and I was told he was quite popular in his pen and made the other chickens cluck their ass off with his wit and humor.Okay so Stone Park isn't that precious but it sure is damn cute and one of Park Slope's most popular brunch and ""nice dinner"" destinations. I've mostly been here for brunch and after trying their short rib hash, french toast and eggs benedict I gotta say the eggs benedict is my consistently a great dish with its non-gross hollandaise sauce, poached egg and a hearty-sized slice of canadian bacon.The short rib hash is pretty excellent too if you need a hangover buster and like your brunch to stick to your...ribs *snicker* I find it to be too heavy for my Sunday morning hustle.If you're coming with more than two people get ready to wait up to 45 minutes on Sunday mornings. I'd recommend getting here early if you're gonna go with a group because it really starts getting packed around noon. We Park Slope folk like our college years wake up time on Sundays.",3.0
A friend and I went there for Brunch.  There was a short wait but was seated at great table.  The service was exceptional.  I had the shrimp and grits which was delectable.  I like this restaurant definitely will return to try some other items on the menu.,5.0
"Dinner here was divine and the reasons total 9:1) Service- The waiter was friendly, attentive, but not overbearing.  The owner even made an appearance to check in with us.2) Atmosphere- Beautiful modern decor, with a homey feel to it.  Fancy but unpretentious.3) Drinks- Extensive wine and spirit list with a solid beer selection.  They also have strong specialty cocktails list; I got the Four Rose Manhattan and it was AMAZING.4) Appetizers- We shared a bunch of apps for the table: the Brussels sprouts were good, just not what we expected; the short rib slider is amazing (it's only 1 slider so not a good share dish); the grilled octopus was very tasty but not charred so don't expect any crunch; the marrow and scallop tacos- some assembly required5) Entrees- Two people got the squid ink tagliatelle (both of them really liked it but one of the commented it was a bit saltier than he was expecting); one person got a branzino with mashed potatoes and he loved it; one person got the pork chop and loved it; the last person in our group got the chicken and liked it.  The last two dishes were done well but the diners did say they weren't the best they ever had.6) Desserts- Extra bonus points here; it was my mother's birthday so they brought her ice cream and a brownie and cookie, compliments of the house.  The real treat however, was the Apple Ravioli dessert which is probably the best dessert anyone at the table has ever had, and I was sitting with a bunch of sweet tooth aficionados.7) Price- Reasonable and what you would expect for nice white table cloth restaurant in Park Slope.8) Music- So the music deserves its own shout out because my dad who is a soul, funk and classic R & B superfan kept commenting how the music being played were lesser know but great cuts off classic albums by Marvin Gaye, Aretha Franklin, Al Green, James Brown.  Very old school classic Brooklyn dinner music.9) I needed it to rhyme with divine so i picked nine reasons but this place is a gem and totally worth checking out.",5.0

For the main course I tried the squid ink tagliatelle. The sauce had a very generous amount of Pancetta which rounded out the chipotle pepper flavors.

You'll probably get better service and food there.",3.0
"Pretty awesome place for brunch. I tried the short rib hash, and also had some of the bluecakes that we ordered for the table. The short rib hash was pretty good, if not slightly fatty. Wasn't too salty, and was definitely a nice hearty brunch. I did like the bluecakes, I just wish they offered them as a side as well as entree, because they came with poached eggs toast and potatoes, which is too much food for just wanting to try them. As a standalone dish, it seems pretty good and hearty. Service was fantastic as wellDef will return!",4.0
"Great music selection. Great brunch! Cute location! Adorable outside patio for you to people watch. Delicious food. There really isn't anything special that sets Stone Park Cafe aside from other little spots like this. I went for brunch and had the chef omelette with spinach, sausage and cheddar served with 4 slices of toast on the side. It was delicious! There's nothing really negative to say about Stone Park Cafe. I wasn't blown away. I've had better.",4.0
"The chicken's name was Colin and I was told he was quite popular in his pen and made the other chickens cluck their ass off with his wit and humor.Okay so Stone Park isn't that precious but it sure is damn cute and one of Park Slope's most popular brunch and ""nice dinner"" destinations. I've mostly been here for brunch and after trying their short rib hash, french toast and eggs benedict I gotta say the eggs benedict is my consistently a great dish with its non-gross hollandaise sauce, poached egg and a hearty-sized slice of canadian bacon.The short rib hash is pretty excellent too if you need a hangover buster and like your brunch to stick to your...ribs *snicker* I find it to be too heavy for my Sunday morning hustle.If you're coming with more than two people get ready to wait up to 45 minutes on Sunday mornings. I'd recommend getting here early if you're gonna go with a group because it really starts getting packed around noon. We Park Slope folk like our college years wake up time on Sundays.",3.0
A friend and I went there for Brunch.  There was a short wait but was seated at great table.  The service was exceptional.  I had the shrimp and grits which was delectable.  I like this restaurant definitely will return to try some other items on the menu.,5.0
"Dinner here was divine and the reasons total 9:1) Service- The waiter was friendly, attentive, but not overbearing.  The owner even made an appearance to check in with us.2) Atmosphere- Beautiful modern decor, with a homey feel to it.  Fancy but unpretentious.3) Drinks- Extensive wine and spirit list with a solid beer selection.  They also have strong specialty cocktails list; I got the Four Rose Manhattan and it was AMAZING.4) Appetizers- We shared a bunch of apps for the table: the Brussels sprouts were good, just not what we expected; the short rib slider is amazing (it's only 1 slider so not a good share dish); the grilled octopus was very tasty but not charred so don't expect any crunch; the marrow and scallop tacos- some assembly required5) Entrees- Two people got the squid ink tagliatelle (both of them really liked it but one of the commented it was a bit saltier than he was expecting); one person got a branzino with mashed potatoes and he loved it; one person got the pork chop and loved it; the last person in our group got the chicken and liked it.  The last two dishes were done well but the diners did say they weren't the best they ever had.6) Desserts- Extra bonus points here; it was my mother's birthday so they brought her ice cream and a brownie and cookie, compliments of the house.  The real treat however, was the Apple Ravioli dessert which is probably the best dessert anyone at the table has ever had, and I was sitting with a bunch of sweet tooth aficionados.7) Price- Reasonable and what you would expect for nice white table cloth restaurant in Park Slope.8) Music- So the music deserves its own shout out because my dad who is a soul, funk and classic R & B superfan kept commenting how the music being played were lesser know but great cuts off classic albums by Marvin Gaye, Aretha Franklin, Al Green, James Brown.  Very old school classic Brooklyn dinner music.9) I needed it to rhyme with divine so i picked nine reasons but this place is a gem and totally worth checking out.",5.0

"I've been here a couple of times for brunch, which is fabulous, but tonight we had dinner for my friend's birthday. I ordered the soup of the day, beer cheese. The soup was perfect. It came out at the perfect temperature and had the right combination of garnishes to give it that extra special touch (sour cream, chives, and croutons). For the main course I tried the squid ink tagliatelle. The sauce had a very generous amount of Pancetta which rounded out the chipotle pepper flavors. The shrimp was also good perfectly.I'd recommend eating here for brunch or even that special occasion.",4.0

"Very average. Very overpriced. Inconsistent with portions. $80 for 4 with no booze. My home fries were half the size of someone else at my table.

"I've been trying to have brunch here for what feels like months. But since Stone Park is so popular, there's always a wait. And unfortunately, when I wake up hungover, I need to eat IMMEDIATELY. If food is not made available for the face-shoving, I am apt to take my (h)anger out by spitting on small children and/or kicking defenseless little puppies. Eventually, I got fed up with not eating Stone Park's food, and decided to shirk my duties for a while and stop in for a weekday lunch. (Shirking is one of my favorite things to do.) Torn between the Braised Short Rib Sandwich (bourbon BBQ sauce, cabbage slaw) and the Chicken Paillard Sandwich (cheddar, bacon, avocado, chipotle mayo), I appealed to our waiter for advice. He immediately, decisively insisted on the shortrib. If you know me at all, you know I was leaning toward the Bourbon BBQ sauce anyway.It turned out to be a good decision; the short rib was fatty and flavorful, and the slaw on top provided a bit of texture and a contrasting coolness to the juicy meat. Perhaps it could've used a better bun, but I inhaled it happily. The accompanying salad with the lemony vinaigrette was also surprisingly good, and so I felt a bit better about choosing it over the fries.  Despite being so pleased with my sandwich, we both agreed that her cavatelli was even better. It's rich sauce was so silky, and the only flaw was my own: I couldn't eat every bite.Stone Park lives up to its reputation; excellent food and excellent service in an atmosphere I'd gladly return to on a date, as a group, or with someone's parents.

"This is my first time writing a Yelp review and I wasn't happy with my short time at Stone Park Cafe. I really had high expectations of Stone Park Cafe as it was ranked as one of the best places for brunch/lunch in Park Slope. Well, I was wrong!I took my husband here to eat for an early lunch on his birthday. I must say the setting was nice and fancy and the restaurant is located in a nice neighborhood. My husband and I were seated indoors in the lower, back section and the worst, most unacceptable thing happened, which kind of ruined my husband's birthday. Before we received our food order, the largest winged COCKROACH I have ever seen, flew over to our table and landed directly on our table,  in front of my husband. We were extremely shocked and disgusted that we jumped off the table. This happened right in front of the waiter who was very professional about the situation. The waiter calmly used a tablecloth to grab the giant cockroach and did a good job remaining under control. He offered us a different seat, but we chose to just leave.   If this happened in the outdoor section, it would be understandable that this giant winged cockroach must have came from elsewhere. But the fact that this bug was roaming indoors, closer to the kitchen area, tells me a lot about their cleanliness.  The only positives about this place are the setting, location and the waiter's politeness. I've never had this type of experience at any restaurant I've been to therefore, I do not expect to come back here.",1.0

"So today my boyfriend and I decided to try this place for the first time. The first thing we did was order two coffees, which came quickly but we had to wait 25 min for milk and asked three waiters for it. Eventually, they casually removed the milk from the table directly beside ours and gave it to us... like it's no big deal. The milk was spoiled because it was floating around in little chunks above the coffee. We asked for new coffees with fresh milk and then I was served a cup of coffee with someone else's lipstick stain on it. This was absolutely ridiculous. Place is not anywhere near sanitary, go at your own risk.",1.0

"I used a Blackboard Eats 30% off deal for dinner with my bf and friend, which afforded us some room to splurge a little and I'm so glad we did.  We had cocktails to start, shared the marrow & scallop tacos, and my friend and I shared the NY Strip steak for two with sides of mashed potatoes and sauteed greens.  The warm sourdough bread was amazing.  The tacos were just enough for 3 of us to have 1 small taco and it was a delicious couple of bites.  I love that they come with all the condiments separately so you can assemble your own taco, and the sea salt was a great crunchy touch.  Our steak (medium rare) was cooked PERFECTLY.  It was so delicious.  The sides were good, especially the mixed greens with exactly the right amount of salt.Service was friendly and attentive and they didn't rush us out even though it was crowded.  I was glad we'd made a reservation.  It's on the expensive side, but I would recommend this place if you're looking for a nice restaurant in the Slope.",4.0

"Brunch Review on a Sat:So immediately upon entering, I heard ""Niggas In Paris"" playing fairly loudly, which on the one hand I found a little odd and on the other, love the song. I didn't mind a little morning rap this particular day but the playlist of current and past rap hits kept going, and I can see how others may be put off by it. It didn't exactly set the most brunch-esque mood, and I did overhear the table next to us say the music was their only complaint.And on to the food. I ordered the The Chosen omelette (house smoked salmon, red onions, cream cheese, and hollandaise) while my boyfriend ordered the Short Rib Hash & Eggs. I asked our server between The Chosen and the Bluefish Cakes, which she preferred and she couldn't decide, saying both were delicious but the The Chosen was the larger of the two. Being pretty hungry, I ordered that but it wasn't too large (by my standards). The omelet itself was really good, and it came with potatoes and toast. I did wish they'd spread out the smoked salmon more evenly or just included more because I felt like my omelet was book-ended with the salmon, leaving nothing in the middle. I had a bite of the Short Rib Hash & Eggs, and from what I tasted, it was also very good and a solid choice. In the end, I wish I had ordered the Bluefish Cakes for something a little different than the usual brunch meal. Next time!",3.0
"This place is very roomy. The food are great! I went there for a birthday dinner, tried their pre-fixed course $35. Very tasty meal! I love this place very much. But for regular visit, I think their food are pricey. But you got what you paid for. Worth to try!",4.0

"I've been here a few time. I would recommend sitting inside as opposed to outside because it was harder to get a waiter's attention from the outside. Oyster Po Boy-Super filling!

Steak and Eggs-Before trying the Oyster Po Boy, I thought this was really good. But after having the Oyster Po Boy, this wasn't as satisfying anymore. Keep in mind that I love seafood. So I might be a little bias here.Buttermilk pancake-Nothing special. Tastes like ordinary pancakes.Eggs Benedict-This was good. Egg was cooked perfectly. Wish they gave more hollandaise sauce though.Bloody Mary-It has good flavor. But I like mine to be spicier.",4.0
"It was a mid fall weekday and my husband and I happened to be off. What a lovelier way to spend the day than to include a lunch in the hot Brooklyn spot. And so we made reservations to Stone Park the same day.For a weekday lunch, there were many patrons. We were seated in a quiet corner table for 2 just near the railing that overlooks their lowere level and the glass doors. (Can't wait to come back here during warmer weather to sit outside!) The decor is simple but creative. Enough to start conversation but not dwell on the various aspects of paintings, or the patrons.We were serviced right away, and it didn't take long for our food to arrive either.

"My recent team holiday dinner at Stone Park Cafe was excellent!  I don't get down to brooklyn all that often, but i loved the festive atmosphere all up and down 5th ave.  Great setting and ample seating.     Fresh made sourdough bread is deadly, try not to fill up on it!  Our table shared a few appetizers: grilled baby octopus was adequate for a few people to get a little taste.  Shaved brussel sprouts salad was my fav, loved the pecorino flakes!  Arugula salad with duck bacon was excellent as well.I went with the grilled whole fish for my main, which was branzino.  Aside from the portion being slightly small, I loved it.  Cooked to perfection.  Two of my colleagues RAVED about the berkshire pork shank with whipped potatoes and veggies.  Hanger steak also got high marks.  Apple turnover dessert was enjoyable but not amazing.I would definitely return to Stone Park if I ever find myself in Park Slope.  Quite upscale compared to nearby options so it's great for special occasions.",4.0
Absolutely love the food here. Always have great options for lunch and dinner. It's a neighborhood gem. Sat at the bar with Angela tonight and she gives a great experience and she works her ass off. Only downfall is a side of sauteed spinach is $9.00...yikes.,5.0

"Brunch Review on a Sat:So immediately upon entering, I heard ""Niggas In Paris"" playing fairly loudly, which on the one hand I found a little odd and on the other, love the song. I didn't mind a little morning rap this particular day but the playlist of current and past rap hits kept going, and I can see how others may be put off by it. It didn't exactly set the most brunch-esque mood, and I did overhear the table next to us say the music was their only complaint.And on to the food. I ordered the The Chosen omelette (house smoked salmon, red onions, cream cheese, and hollandaise) while my boyfriend ordered the Short Rib Hash & Eggs. I asked our server between The Chosen and the Bluefish Cakes, which she preferred and she couldn't decide, saying both were delicious but the The Chosen was the larger of the two. Being pretty hungry, I ordered that but it wasn't too large (by my standards). The omelet itself was really good, and it came with potatoes and toast. I did wish they'd spread out the smoked salmon more evenly or just included more because I felt like my omelet was book-ended with the salmon, leaving nothing in the middle. I had a bite of the Short Rib Hash & Eggs, and from what I tasted, it was also very good and a solid choice. In the end, I wish I had ordered the Bluefish Cakes for something a little different than the usual brunch meal. Next time!",3.0
"This place is very roomy. The food are great! I went there for a birthday dinner, tried their pre-fixed course $35. Very tasty meal! I love this place very much. But for regular visit, I think their food are pricey. But you got what you paid for. Worth to try!",4.0
Nice atmosphere for brunch with family or friends. Some standouts include the short rib hash and biscuits and gravy,5.0
"I have been here a couple of times through the years and it has been consistently good. The menu changes quite often and it's one of the only places in Park Slope that has a cozy New England feel to it. We had gnocchi and a bunch of apps that were wonderful, add a couple of glasses of wine and a free desert and you got yourself a pretty nice evening.",4.0
"I've been here a few time. I would recommend sitting inside as opposed to outside because it was harder to get a waiter's attention from the outside. Oyster Po Boy-Super filling! When I first ordered this and saw the portion, I thought to myself that it wasn't going to fill me. But I was so wrong! I was stuffed! Steak and Eggs-Before trying the Oyster Po Boy, I thought this was really good. But after having the Oyster Po Boy, this wasn't as satisfying anymore. Keep in mind that I love seafood. So I might be a little bias here.Buttermilk pancake-Nothing special. Tastes like ordinary pancakes.Eggs Benedict-This was good. Egg was cooked perfectly. Wish they gave more hollandaise sauce though.Bloody Mary-It has good flavor. But I like mine to be spicier.",4.0
"It was a mid fall weekday and my husband and I happened to be off. What a lovelier way to spend the day than to include a lunch in the hot Brooklyn spot. And so we made reservations to Stone Park the same day.For a weekday lunch, there were many patrons. We were seated in a quiet corner table for 2 just near the railing that overlooks their lowere level and the glass doors. (Can't wait to come back here during warmer weather to sit outside!) The decor is simple but creative. Enough to start conversation but not dwell on the various aspects of paintings, or the patrons.We were serviced right away, and it didn't take long for our food to arrive either. I had a crisp glass of white wine and a seafood pasta which was lovely. My husband had the burger which he enjoyed.Overall it was a most pleasant experience and we'll be sure to come back some other odd day.",4.0

"This place has good food, is a little on the pricey side for the neighborhood, and usually has good service.  The last time I ate there was a birthday lunch with my mom in May.  We sat outside under the shade and had a lovely experience UNTIL I very kindly suggested to the server that whoever prints the menus will want to add that they were nuts on the blood orange gelato as some people have serious allergies and would not have thought to ask if the bottom of their gelato had been dipped in crushed hazelnuts and plated in such a way that you couldn't see nuts until you had taken a bite.  I have a mild allergy to hazelnuts and wasn't even sending it back or asking to have it comped.  It was just a simple suggestion to improve the quality of their service (because I know folks with serious nut allergies who would've been busy dying on the floor before the waiter could come out to see what was wrong).  His response was so rude and defensive, we were really quite taken aback, suggesting that it's the customer who's really the one who should take responsibility to inform the server of any allergies.  I suggested it goes both ways and that often nuts are indicated on menus.  I totally agree with his point and I do often ask about how food is prepared.  It was just a suggestion to include all the garnishes on the menu because it ruins it for people with allergies to just throw some nuts or sesame seeds on something that usually is ungarnished without including it on the menu.  The critique is that he was so rude about it and was personally offended by the suggestion that someone else (whoever prints the menus) include common food allergens used as garnishes on the menu.  He might've just been having a bad day but let's face it, in the service industry, you vent to anyone not the customer.  Poor form.Need I remind you this was my birthday lunch?  I'm not rushing back there, let's just put it that way.  Overall, good food, a little pricey, service is mostly good but can be unpredictable.",3.0
"Our first night out after baby!! We went on a particularly wintery, snowy night, which made it even more romantic. Even though we were late (about 20 minutes) they held our table. Great wine selection, small quality food menu and fantastic service; I can't ask for anything better! I'm glad we chose to come here for our night out.",5.0
"Really disappointing!  I started with ""fresh orange juice"", which didn't taste fresh and which I saw them pour out of a large plastic carton.  I had the shirt rib hash, which consisted mainly of greasy potato with the tiniest bit of short rib.  The flavors weren't particularly exciting and the white sourdough was very ordinary.  The servers made us feel under pressure to leave - they took my friends plate away even though she was clearly still eating.  Will not be going back - much prefer James or Miriam nearby.",2.0
"We were here the other day for lunch to celebrate our third wedding anniversary. This place makes even lunch special. There's a prefix menu that includes an appetizer, entree, and dessert for $21. It was a bit sparse for us, so we opted for the regular menu. Everything was delicious; I ordered two salads (one for the starter, the second for the entree).I ordered the grilled octopus, which was phenomenal. They should make this an entree! The octopus was tender and perfectly crisply grilled. For my entree, I had the Cobb salad, which came with a breaded egg. Interesting and scrumptious. My husband had the shrimp scampi and burger with a side of soup. He was very pleased. We topped off our meal with the chocolate bread pudding, which is like a hot, moist little chocolate cake with caramel ice cream on top. The service was fantastic as well. One little thing: the owner/manager was having a conversation right next to us about how he fired someone. I thought this was a bit inappropriate to have out in the open with guests eating. Additionally, they were pretty indifferent to guests in the dining room; he didn't say hi or was welcoming in any way. Seemed pretty rude to me but our server was very kind.We decided to eat lunch here because I'd wanted to try it for some time. We actually considered it for our wedding three years ago but our guest list ended up being like 10 times the size at the end. So, it was nice to finally sit down and see what we missed. It was nice, but we're not running back here any time soon - it's pretty expensive for an everyday thing.",4.0
"So I came here today for brunch not realizing it was lunch but thats fine, I had my mimosa anyway :)Not crowded at all. Sat down fast. Smaller menu but still had a good amount of items to choose from. Waitress was very attentive to us as well. Ordered the chicken sandwich with a salad on side- delicious! Simple but packed with flavor and on a small ciabatta! Love ciabatta!Dessert: I usually don't but j had the tiramisu cheesecake.... Yep, TIRAMISU CHEESECAKE! It was worth every single ounce of sweat at a hot yoga class or a 90n spin class. Money well spent!Definitely going back here for an actual brunch and perhaps a dinner too- reasonable prices for a trendy corner restaurant in Park Slope :)",4.0

"My family's go-to spot for special occasions. Josh and Josh have been making great food and great dining experiences for years, long before any of the johnny-come-latelys in the neighborhood arrived. I had my first marrow bones here and haven't turned back down the path to decadence.",5.0
"Amidst a neighborhood flooded with restaurant options stands the Stone Park Cafe. We discovered this place while walking through Park Slope this past Saturday, and to be honest we chose it because it offered outdoor seating. The service here wasn't really that good, our server took our order and essentially never came back, which was odd, however if the food wasn't so outstanding, I would not be writing this review. I had the pork belly BLT, and let me tell you something...DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING ELSE! It was that good. So good, I wanted to order another. Truly a phenomenal sandwich. My lady had the cobb salad which was also a fine choice. I don't know how they did it, but it was served with a fried soft boiled egg. Unreal. They also make a decent bloody mary. If we are ever in that neighborhood again, we will 1000% return to Stone Park!",4.0
"I never go to park slope but stone park's shrimp and grits might be my new reason to. (Never end a sentence with a preposition). It was really WOW. Super creamy perfectly cooked grits, stirred all up with some shredded cheddar. Oh man. To make it even better, there's a poached egg in the middle. Cut into it and mix it around. No regrets. There's also some chopped scallions on top for some sharpness. And to top it off, I added some shrimp. Perfectly grilled and as always, a great match to the grits. My friends loved their omelets too! They said the eggs were awesome. They kinda looked like they were mixed with sour cream, a la Cheesecake Factory style, they were so silky smooth.There was no wait at 11am on a Sunday, a huge plus. Our waiter seemed hungover, as his hands were shaking the entire time... But service was still great. He was on top of his game and my coffee and water were always filled.Definitely need to come back",5.0
"Well...trying to re-create my wonderful first brunch experience here turned out to be a bit of a disaster. I get that you can be busy...I know you're popular. I have no problem with the fact that it was much more crowded than the last time I came. The wait wasn't so long and my friends and I enjoyed the farmers market nearby as we waited. What I do have a problem with...waiting 15 minutes before a waiter came....music so loud that you can't hear your friends speak....a messed up order....a bad attitude. One of these is forgivable...all 4, not so much. Yes, we waited 15 minutes before a waiter came to us. We asked one waiter politely to turn the incredibly loud rock music down. He said he would and didn't. The table next to us also complained about the loud music and we all asked another waiter to turn it down. His response..""We need it loud to keep the energy up."". WTF?! I'm sorry...I thought I was at a nice restaurant for brunch, not a rock concert or club. I yelled back...""I don't care! None of us can hear each other speak!"" I was infuriated by the lack of care that was given to the customers here. Many reviews mention the overly loud music. No one wants to scream over music at brunch. I don't know what these people are thinking. I'm a professional musician, for pete's sake, so I'm certainly not a music hater. But there's something called appropriate. A few minutes later, the music was turned down and we all...with perfectly good energy...enjoyed our conversations. But a few minutes later, it was turned up again. I decided to let it go. Our food finally came and they brought me the wrong dish. I had ordered the Hangtown Fry and they brought out a short rib hash. Perhaps if the music hadn't been so loud, the server might have heard my order. He did apologize and brought me out a biscuit to munch on. Finally, my food came. It's a delicious dish, overall, but one of the oysters spilled out its innards in a disgusting fashion and it was difficult to eat after that. The other oysters had been fine. My friend ordered the braised greens , but didn't like them (I tasted them and didn't care for them, either, and I usually love braised greens). The meat in them tasted off and there was too much vinegar. They did take those off of the bill, which was nice of them. But given the issues we had, I highly doubt I'll be coming here again. If I do, I'll bring earplugs.",2.0

"Take the harem to this spot and you might need to tap your home equity. Truthfully, it's not that bad, price wise. I've been here like a zillion times more than you and let me tell you the food is delicious! They serve two portions on the pastas. One is parsimonious; the other is profligate. Well, really the small portion might be enough for an unborn fetus. It will just wet your whistle. Whet you're wistle. Whet your whistle. Is this review even reliable? The large portion will satiate. The meat is nummy. Ambiance is great. Please don't pronounce the 'A' like the 'O' in omelet. You sound almost as pretentious as this review. The service has been satisfactory but I demand servitude with a smile. So, In conclusion I enjoy this restaurant as the food really is spectacular, except for the last time I came in and ordered Steak frites (come on, it's just steak and fries. This is not even a French restaurant; is it?) The service is okay but could be better for the money. And the decor is delightful (Damn Norman Conquest and these stupid French words).",4.0

From reading yelp reviews, I ordered the short rib hash with poached eggs and rye toast. The eggs were perfectly runny inside and the hash just on the edge of too rich for breakfast. The toast was just ok, I wish it had not come pre-buttered.",3.0
"Took my parents here for brunch on Sunday.  They were very accommodating to our party of 6 and the food was wonderful. However, the lost star was due to the music. It was way too loud for any kind of conversation to take place. They did turn it down at our request but it quickly returned to the louder volume. It was also loud thumping music, a strange choice for Sunday brunch.",4.0
Amazing!! One of the best restaurants I have eaten at in a long time. Great little patio and the staff is wonderful. Our waiter (David S) was superb.,5.0
"Take the harem to this spot and you might need to tap your home equity. Truthfully, it's not that bad, price wise. I've been here like a zillion times more than you and let me tell you the food is delicious! They serve two portions on the pastas. One is parsimonious; the other is profligate. Well, really the small portion might be enough for an unborn fetus. It will just wet your whistle. Whet you're wistle. Whet your whistle. Is this review even reliable? The large portion will satiate. The meat is nummy. Ambiance is great. Please don't pronounce the 'A' like the 'O' in omelet. You sound almost as pretentious as this review. The service has been satisfactory but I demand servitude with a smile. So, In conclusion I enjoy this restaurant as the food really is spectacular, except for the last time I came in and ordered Steak frites (come on, it's just steak and fries. This is not even a French restaurant; is it?) The service is okay but could be better for the money. And the decor is delightful (Damn Norman Conquest and these stupid French words).",4.0
"This restaurant is amazing for brunch. It does get busy on a Sunday afternoon but it is worth the wait. Food was delicious and all for reasonable prices. Each person paid around $24 with tips included.  This was the second time coming back to this place cause it was that great!  We ordered the Buttermilk Pancakes, 8oz. Stone Park Burger with Salad, Steak & Eggs with Fries, & the Greek Omelet..Its a must try for all these foods.  Will definitely return to this place.",5.0

"Though a bit pricier than most places around brooklyn, this is one of the most consistent places for brunch or dinner in the area.

"Too bad that the host was an airhead... I would liked to have eaten here but he couldn't remember to seat people in the order of arrival and sat 2 other parties of 4 who arrived after us (no reservations), before us - after repeatedly telling us that 'our table is being set now'.  I left - as there are too many great places to eat in this city to stick around for bad service.  This is my greatest annoyance with restaurants and would rather give my business elsewhere.  Get it together people!  Service is important.",1.0

"Came here for brunch a while ago.  There was a wait but they offered to call us when our table was ready so we had a drink around the block.  Food was awesome, as was the music and environment.  It took an active effort to squeeze into our table, but the server's attentiveness and awesome personality, coupled with the good food and 90s hip hop make up for it.",5.0

"As good as it gets in Park Slope.  Place is quite large with a back area + outdoor seating. It still had a casual, homey feel to it. Modern & simple. We had a 30mn wait as we had arrived  during prime brunching time. I didn't like how people waiting inside had to stand right next to those who were dining..uncomfortable for both parties. Chose to wait outside, since they took down our #.  Once seated, had the passion fruit which tasted like more like champagne than a fruit cocktail. Still good and better than the cranberry cocktail they offered. Had  a hard time deciding what to eat (sign of a great selection from a place). Settled with the short rib and eggs while S.O. had the shrimp and grits. Both dishes were awesome.I must say, they make their eggs really well. Didn't see the appeal of paying extra for the side biscuit, which tasted pretty regular. Service was attentive, though you could tell they were extra busy, just breezing through us. Prices are higher than your typical brunch menu. No unlimited mimosa here, but the food is so worth it. Thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience. I anticipate coming back for dinner.",5.0
Awesome delicious lattes (wayyy superior than your avg latte at starbucks) and also an awesome place for brunch.

"The food is great, my favorite brunch food in Brooklyn. Their lunch and dinner is also fantastic.However, they play the worst music very very loud, I would never go back. In the span of a single brunch I heard such hits as:-Walk This Way by Aerosmith and Run DMC-Fresh Prince of Bell Air by Will Smith-Okay I can't remember the rest but it was bad. It felt like we were at a club in CInicnnati in 1998 (I was there I would know).The restaurant industry has done studies that show that if you play music with a certain amount of beats per minute at a high volume people eat faster and you make more money. It's a shame that they're willing to take that strategy to the hilt no matter the consequences.  Their food is good but not good enough to make me endure Guantanamo style noise torture, especially if I'm nursing a hangover.",1.0

"If you're a fatty like me and look foward to weekend brunch, Stone Park Cafe is the place to be! They know brunch and they do it well!. Stone park is a little restaurant with not much decoration. Just white table linens, beige walls and maybe a few pictures on the wall. Who cares! When you serve food as good as theirs, the decor don't really matter much. Either that or you're just more focused on the beautiful food that's on the plate in front of you. Or perhaps (mostly in my case) you have zoned out  and are now going into a food coma from all that delicious comfort food. Despite all that stone park cafe is definitely a hit among park slope. I usually come to stone park cafe on Sundays for brunch, although I have been there once on a Saturday, to not much surprise the crowds still pour outside. If you do not come here early enough, you most certainly are going to have to wait. Wait time is always around 30 minutes or so. You give them your number and they call you and let you know your table is ready. Stone park is very family oriented. There's lots of parents with their husband's and their parents and children. I must say though, for this restaurant always having a lot of children in it, its not at all annoying or too much going on. The restaurant is on the loud side but that's because its just filled with all the brunch chatter.The brunch menu is large and filled with goodies. When seated they ask If you would like, tea, coffee, o.j., mimosa, etc. First time I came here I ordered the ""hangtown fry"" which is a tempura oyster frittata with pieces of bacon and vermont cheddar cheese in it. I was so pleased! I've never had anything like it and it was delicious. I have tried it multiple times after and I felt like the oysters had gotten a little salty but nothing major, still enjoyed it! Now the dish that speaks to my soul is the ""short rib hash and eggs"". Omg! So good! I can eat this a million times over for breakfast, lunch and dinner. It's braised short rib with potatoes and onions (typical hash) and eggs any style, I usually get mine over well with sour dough toast. That's as simple as it gets but so good. Another delish dish on their menu are the ""biscuits and gravy"". A soft buttermilk biscuit, some creamy sausage gravy, and eggs any style. I get mine scrambled. That sausage gravy man! I can pour that on top of anything! But I must tell you, that is one filling dish! After you eat it, make sure you have someone there that can carry you home, because you will fall asleep! Lol. I've also tried the ""steak and eggs"" which was average. Steak was cooked well with caramelized onions on top, had it with scrambled eggs. the pancakes are also really good. Buttermilk pancakes with a berry compote and Vermont maple syrup. The berry compote is definitely yummy. I highly recommend in ordering these.Stone park cafe is among my favorite restaurants.

"I'm actually literally astounded reading any bad reviews about this place. I've been coming here for years and I don't think I've ever been disappointed.  Brunch here is phenomenal, rustic, and ample-portioned. The staff is laid-back but also hustles. The Bloody Mary may be $9, but that's money well spent if you like flavor and Saturday morning giggles. Hangtown Fry, any form of omelette, Pork Belly BLT...you name it, I've had it, and it's good.  Yeah, you have to wait if it's noon. Shut up; there's a reason for that.  Get up at 9:45 for a change, you lush, and get there at doors open to get your seat and a Bloody inside ya.  While you're at it, have some of Tim's badass hot sauce to perk up your morning along with some killer coffee.I'm not precious about my food. I don't care if it's 100% organic or cooked in the CEO of Monsanto's taint; if it tastes good, I'm in. Stone Park is apparently mostly organic. I personally think the difference that makes is negligable compared to the skill the chef(s) is/are bringing to it, but if that blows your hair back...well, scrape off the patchouli stink and enjoy your meal, you hippie. Just kidding. Not really. I'm trying to eat over here.Seriously, though: this spot is the yardstick to which all others are compared. Look no further.",5.0
"This place comes highly rated by many, for all of the obvious reasons. Quality ingredients, a classy atmosphere, and of course, the ""image"" it presents.Now I agree that all of the above are necessary ingredients for a well-rounded, respectable restaurant, however, that isn't the only requirement to making it worth visiting.While I did enjoy my food, the service was great, I can't say that I will return. It wasn't as special as everyone seems to rave about. Call me a naysayer, call me a jerk, call me uncouth. I just wasn't impressed enough to value a repeat visit.However, do not take my statement as a negative. It's a worthy place to visit and enjoy. So please go. Just bring a credit card, because some things can be pricier than expected.",3.0
Amazing brunch! Grits (To die) Homemade Sausage (Amazing) wait aasnt too long. Passion cocktail delicious over all ill be back!,5.0
"Delicious dinner. I had the prix-fixe special with a Pappardelle appetizer, hangar steak entree, and brownie dessert for $35. After 2 glasses of wine, though the bill came to $60. While good, I don't think it was $60 good. The bartender was sweet and made small talk as the owner or manager sat next to me and ran through the finances with an investor of sorts. Interesting conversation to listen in on.",3.0
"The scene: Two of us came in for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. Crowded. Put our name & number down. We were called in 10-15 minutes. Seated in the very back corner next to the kitchen. Not the best table... but it's a crowded Sunday afternoon at a brunch spot, so we'll take it. Very loud music playing... not a quiet place for nice conversation.The Service: sub-par. Not sure what we did to get on our server's bad side (we are very polite, happy-go-lucky people), but we were ignored most of the time. The table next to us arrived after us, were greeted before us, ordered before us, and got their food... before us. Not once during the meal were we checked up on... ask for more drinks... etc. When we were finished the bill was dropped off immediately and we were not asked if we wanted to order anything else, e.g. more drinks, coffee or dessert. OK we'll take the hint.The Food: The sole redeeming factor to the entire experience. After waiting a while for our food it finally arrived. I got the pan-seared bluefish cakes. My beau got a cobb salad. Salad looked super fresh and delicious. The bluefish cakes? UNREAL. Absolutely delicious from start to finish. Poached eggs perfectly cooked atop crispy and succulent bluefish cake drizzled with caper hollandaise sauce and accompanied by homefries and toast. DELICIOUS. I also got a bloody mary... pretty good. Nice and spicy.Overal takeaway: GREAT FOOD, sub-par service. I'll give this place one more try when it's warm out and they have outdoor seating as well. I also wish they had drink specials for brunch cocktails (maybe an unlimited option?). Drinks were $10 a pop. Gets very pricey.",3.0
"In Cobble Hill, there are fliers posted 9/14-16 urging neighbors, angry at the music played at the Cafe's 10th anniversary party on Amity Street, to punish the restaurant by writing negative postings on YELP. I'm pretty sure the good people of Cobble Hill are above this kind of behavior.",5.0
"Our second visit for Brunch was not quite as enjoyable as the first. He had the chef's omelet which was very nice, but the potatoes were mushy, not crisp in any way. I had the grits with shrimp, very creamy and rich, but barely warm. Most outstanding, and not in a good way, is the LOUD music, not the way to ease into the morning. Finally, once your order's placed and delivered, the waitstaff disappears, making remedies difficult.",3.0
"I've been telling anyone who will listen that Stone Park Cafe is my favorite restaurant in Park Slope for years now. How did I not write a review sooner? A recent holiday dinner I hosted at their private dining space- Events At Stone Park, has prodded me to finally put something in the books.These guys are among the best restauranteurs in New York. I approached them in September about an event on December 14th and they took the ball and ran with it. My budget was treated with respect and they accommodated every single need I had (one of which was handicap accessibility to dining room and restroom). Even when my guest list mushroomed to 46 people, they were unfazed and handled this and similar changes without missing a beat. They put together an incredible combination of passed Hors D""Oeuvres and amazing buffet entrees- in addition to open bar and a signature cocktail, developed just for our event! Elizabeth and Josh made every guest feel welcome and made sure I was able to relax and have a good time. Everything was delicious and the staff they chose to cook and serve the food and drinks was very friendly. If you're looking for a private event space for a party in Park Slope, look no further. These guys have created a beautiful and affordable haven for diners who care about food.I've also been to the restaurant dozens of times and have never had a bad meal. The Chatham Cod is hands-down the best fish dish I've ever had. Great service, low attitude and amazing food. Thank you for continuing to strive for quality, Stone Park Cafe. You guys rock!",5.0
"Out on a lunch date, we went to the Stone Park Cafe during the dreary afternoon. We were seated right away, there weren't many patrons and we had some elbow room because the tables are pretty close together. We were greeted by a high spirited waitress with shoulder-length brown hair (sorry, didn't catch her name). We were given the lunch prix fixe and a regular lunch menu. The prices are what you'd expect in park slope, $10-16 for a small dish, $15-25 for a large dish. We ordered Blanc de Noirs (sparkling white), $12 a glass which is pricey (I still had two), and grilled octopus salad and lamb sausage. He has the grilled octopus so I'll leave that for his review, I tried it, as a texture eater, the octopus was cooked great! I had the lamb sausage. Let me tell you, the sausage was soft and juicy, with smoked beans which were subtlely smokey, and some arugula. It paired very well. The whole time the service was stupendous, checking on us, joking with us, making sure we are okay. For dessert, I had one scoop (you can choose how many) mocha chocolate ice cream with hot fudge, which was real hot fudge and the small serving hit the spot.To summarize, the small serving plates were just enough to fill without over stuffing yourself yet still flavorful and delightful (not like an appetizer), and being able to choose your dessert size made it even better. I walked away happy and full.",5.0
"My girlfriend and I wanted a nice brunch place with not too much of a wait time on the Sunday of Memorial day weekend. We arrived and discovered that they have an interesting reservation policy - you give them your name and cell phone number and they will call you when the table is ready. So, theoretically, one could leave a name and walk around the nearby park, only to come back when you know your table is ready. This is a great service.That being said, we were in the uncomfortable position of not being offered that option for some reason. We stood for about 10 minutes after the host said ""one minute, there is a table being cleaned up."" This was confusing but we did eventually sit down to eat.Once seated the service was great - our waitress came often to ask what we needed. The food was tasty and was a decent price for what was being offered. We shared an omelette and buttermilk pancakes with berry compote. We liked the compote so much we got more for the pancakes.The ambiance is nice and the drink options plentiful in terms of alcohol. Definitely a place to return to.",4.0

Best brunch in Brooklyn! Glad that I found this place! The squid ink pasta was incredible. Will def go back again soon!,5.0
Holy Cow! This place is amazing! I went for the pre fixed lunch menu and it was perfect in portion size and DELISH! I had a butternut squash ravioli with duck confit followed by a succulent branzino.

"A lovely cozy brunch spot in the P. Slope neighborhood. Reminiscent of Cobble Hill's Buttermilk Channel.  Food and coffee were great and prices were reasonable. We ordered the quiche and eggs benedict.  Would love to come back to try their dinner menu.*Update on 9.26.12*So guys, dinner was fantastic.  Although a tempting prix fixe menu was offered, we decided to pick and choose from the dinner menu and dine tapas-style.Appetizer: Heirloom beet salad - fresh Tarte Flambe - thin, crispy and delicious with the perfect touch of saltiness from the house cured lamb baconMain course:Grilled baby octopus -Tender and flavorful.  Simple seasoning.  Loved.Squid ink tagliatelle - SO YUM.  Assortment of seafood on top of ..not heavy at all.  Eat while still warm but still delicious even if it's cooled a bit.Dessert:Affogato - Hazelnut ice cream in coffee with a biscotti. Can't go wrongVanilla panna cotta - Not too sweet.  Delightful finish to a great dinner.Vibe of the place is a lot more romantic in the evening.  Service was also wonderful.  Did not feel rushed at all even as the restaurant was closing, even the bar tender whom we had no interaction with had a lovely and warm smile on her face bidding us farewell.  Thumbs up for moi!",4.0
"This place is dependably satisfying. It is definitely a little bit pricier with smaller portions. However, their food is fully spiced and delicious. I have had their bone marrow taco which is succulent and delicious, and their mushroom ravioli and coconut sorbet. All of which is absolutely delicious!!",4.0
"You can tell how popular a restaurant is based on how many people are waiting for a table. For brunch, stone park cafe is the place to hit. I came by at 11:45am on a Sunday and there was a 45 minute wait. The only thing is that you will have to wait outside because there is no space inside ... Not the best when weather is getting cold. My friends ordered the shrimp grits, eggs Benedict, fish cake, and I ordered an omelet. Everyone had a good experience with their food and we each ended up finishing everything on our plate.  The omelet  had tons of egg in it and they put the toppings in the middle of the omelet and not integrated with the egg.A good place for brunch if it isn't a long wait.",4.0
Just an outstanding experience all the way around. The service was wonderful as we had a very nice waiter that catered to our every need right away. It was enough to make us feel we were at a high end Manhattan Restaurant. It was that level of treatment. The food was fantastic. Absolutely delicious. I had the pork chops and my wife had the duck. It was all perfectly done and very flavorful. Honestly one of the best meals I've had in some time. The bottle of wine we ordered was really great too. An Austrian wine from Judith Beck. Try it if you go. Finally the atmosphere was really nice. It's a small place but not over crowded and certainly festive but without being too loud. It was a perfect date night spot.,5.0

And the mandolin shredding of the sprouts is enviable.I also had the short rib slider with quail egg.Just enough food to send me home perfectly full and happy.Therefore I will chalk that aberrant previous visit up to a one time thing.

There are a number of good places in the area for brunch/lunch but this one is my favorite.It's usually pretty busy, and I waited about 30 minutes for a table, but they'll take your cell phone number and call you when your table is ready, and the park is right next door, so it's not too bad to wait.The servers are also all very friendly and attentive, which always surprises me when I go somewhere that's as busy as this.",5.0
"I was there for an anniversary dinner celebration. I had the octopus salad (perfectly seared, great combination of flavors), the chicken with mushroom taglitelle (boring, sure, but delicious) and the avogaddo (sp??  it was good, but I think I would have been just as happy with a scoop of their amazing ice cream). Was with a party of four, and each of us walked away impressed. It's a bit expensive for the neighborhood, but well-worth it for the quality. Staff was quick to correct errors, knowledgeable about the menu, and accommodating.",5.0
"Great location.  Waited about 20 minutes for a table, so it's busy (for a Saturday noon-ish brunch).  Biscuits and gravy were good, but get the braised greens as well.  Not huge plates, but sufficient.  Bloody Mary was decent, not that memorable.  Would give three stars, but service was excellent.  Yes, that stuff still matters.",4.0
"Really airy open low key but big flavor brunch spot! The staff was very accommodating, friendly and efficient. Love the relaxed vibe. Sunday brunch was amazing, blue fish cakes, grits, quesadillas, French toast you name it they have it. Good for groups, and worth the wait. Sunday farmers market outside when your done enjoying brunch, overall the perfect Sunday brunch spot ;)",4.0
Absolutely love this place for brunch. Whether you  are in the mood for a light brunch or a heavy meal they have a good selection. We have been here so many times. I can't believe it and read review earlier. I've been meaning to go there at night to try the fried chicken dish.,4.0
"Decent but not spectacular.  I may have missed some fine print on their site, but they actually do not take reservations for brunch.  I went at 3:00 on Saturday (brunch).  The food was good, not spectacular (minus a star).  The service was too slow (minus a star).",3.0

What a mistake! It was so yummy! Two of us got the braised short rib and hash (yum) and my other friend got a short rib sandwich with fries which was also really good! I got an overpriced orange juice, but we had a nice time. The food was good. Came pretty quickly and the service was fine.I would definitely come back for some other items and def recommend! :)",4.0
"Can't recommend this place enough.  It's a long wait for brunch, every time, but it's worth it.  Biscuits and Gravy is ridiculously delicious and not overwhelming.  I have not had a bad meal here actually.  Love it.",5.0
"The brunch here is amazing (I've never been here for non-brunch meals but if they're anywhere as good as the brunch, then I'm missing out big time). There are a number of good places in the area for brunch/lunch but this one is my favorite.It's usually pretty busy, and I waited about 30 minutes for a table, but they'll take your cell phone number and call you when your table is ready, and the park is right next door, so it's not too bad to wait.The servers are also all very friendly and attentive, which always surprises me when I go somewhere that's as busy as this.",5.0
"I was there for an anniversary dinner celebration. I had the octopus salad (perfectly seared, great combination of flavors), the chicken with mushroom taglitelle (boring, sure, but delicious) and the avogaddo (sp??  it was good, but I think I would have been just as happy with a scoop of their amazing ice cream). Was with a party of four, and each of us walked away impressed. It's a bit expensive for the neighborhood, but well-worth it for the quality. Staff was quick to correct errors, knowledgeable about the menu, and accommodating.",5.0
"Great location.  Waited about 20 minutes for a table, so it's busy (for a Saturday noon-ish brunch).  Biscuits and gravy were good, but get the braised greens as well.  Not huge plates, but sufficient.  Bloody Mary was decent, not that memorable.  Would give three stars, but service was excellent.  Yes, that stuff still matters.",4.0
"Really airy open low key but big flavor brunch spot! The staff was very accommodating, friendly and efficient. Love the relaxed vibe. Sunday brunch was amazing, blue fish cakes, grits, quesadillas, French toast you name it they have it. Good for groups, and worth the wait. Sunday farmers market outside when your done enjoying brunch, overall the perfect Sunday brunch spot ;)",4.0
Absolutely love this place for brunch. Whether you  are in the mood for a light brunch or a heavy meal they have a good selection. We have been here so many times. I can't believe it and read review earlier. I've been meaning to go there at night to try the fried chicken dish.,4.0
"Decent but not spectacular.  I may have missed some fine print on their site, but they actually do not take reservations for brunch.  I went at 3:00 on Saturday (brunch).  The food was good, not spectacular (minus a star).  The service was too slow (minus a star).",3.0

"Places like Stone Park prove that dining out in Brooklyn is its own unique experience from what you'll find in Manhattan. Furthermore, Stone Park proves that at times and in their own way, Brooklyn restaurants provide a better experience. Walking in, I was struck by the interior. The bar is really prominent when you enter as is the exposed brick however as you proceed in, you can go down a few steps into a more traditional looking dining room. Tables in either area give you a chance for a lively and inviting dining experience.Now as for the food, it was impeccable. We started with the tarte flambe- creme fraiche was refreshingly tart and the house-cured lamb bacon paired beautifully.My main was the Ricotta Gnocchi with fennel mirepoix and oxtail ragu. This was an amazing dish. The oxtail was meaty, rich and just slightly gamey while the gnocchi were light, creamy and a little lemony.For dessert I had the apple turnover and buttermilk ice cream which was as delicious as it sounds.Having a meal of well-prepared, nourishing and artful cuisine while being able to enjoy local company and the sights and sounds of 5th in the slope is a treat.

Omlettes were pretty standard fare but we def. noticed that there were quality ingredients which made it taste great.

"I used to live down the block from the location that would become Stone Park Café, so I was quite intrigued when what I used to know as an unused storefront (and one time bodega) was now a trendy looking cafe/restaurant serving breakfast.  My friends and I wanted brunch, but not just something for McDonalds or something.  This fit the bill perfectly.  We sat outside, something I rarely do but it was super comfortable (and the weather was perfect).  As pigeons wandered by and kids played across the street in the park, we enjoyed each other's company and then tried to figure out what the heck we were going to order.  The problem is simple: everything on the menu looks insanely good.  Finally I settled on an egg white omelet with spinach, onion and garlic.  Truth be told, the garlic is what sold me.  Roasted garlic?  On an OMELET?!  You damn right I'm going to try that!Omelets are one of those foods that rarely have a middle ground.  They're either very ""Meh"" or they're awesome.  Stone Park does them AWESOME.  The roasted garlic was so flavorful and soft it melted in your mouth.  The spinach was perfectly cooked and the eggs were moist and springy.  Excellent stuff.The service was very laid back and chill, but friendly and efficient all at the same time.  This reflects the general mood of the restaurant's setting, so I was very pleased to see such consistency.  I'm a fan of Stone Park for sure and look forward to going back in the future.",4.0

"This is a great neighborhood gem. We came here on Monday night for dinner. Reservations were made on the spur on open table. So that was easy. It's a big enough restaurant and will be great for a weekend brunch. They have outdoor seating. The ambiance is casual and cozy. We were seated right away. Soon I was looking at a 20 page wine list. They have an excellent selection of wine. You can order by the glass which costs anywhere between 10 - 14$ all the way to a $400 wine bottle. I was definitely impressed with the variety. Since both of us decided to not drink that night we went straight to ordering the food. Once we placed the order for dinner, we were served with bread. The bread was sourdough and it was delicious specially because it had just come out of the oven. It was hot and tasty. Here is what we ordered:Heirloom Beet Salad: frisée, toasted hazelnuts, crème fraîche vinaigrette - The salad was scrumptious. Not at all over dressed and very delicious. A well done salad. The hazelnut added the perfect crunch. The corn soup was very light too. Even though it had crème fraîche, it was not at all heavy. Lovely flavors.  Squid Ink Tagliatelle: chipotle pepper, gulf shrimp, pancetta - We ordered the half portion of this pasta without the pancetta. Was a good choice. Had some bold flavors. There was a subtle amount of spice and the portion size was perfect. Swiss Chard Raviolini: seasonal mushrooms, sage, pine nuts - Half portion. I was absolutely blown away by the flavors of this raviolini. It was super delicious. There was strong lemon flavor in the background and i generally don't like tangy things, but this was complementing the mushrooms and the pasta sauce perfectly. Overall a lovely dish. Would def. order it again.Desert: Chocolate Brioche Pudding- caramel ice cream - I was a little disappointed with the Brioche pudding. It was nothing like a pudding. Rather it reminded me of a chocolate lava cake. We even asked the server and she confirmed that it was made out of Brioche. The flavors were ok, not bad but this is not what we had in mind when we ordered it. The caramel ice cream was good. Overall, i liked the food and would definitely come back here. I believe they use local ingredients and their brunch is great too. The bill was under $70. Slightly on the expensive side, considering we had only half portions of the pasta. But the food quality was great so worth every penny!! P.S. - If you book them through open table for dinner, they do not let you change the reservation after 6pm on open table. So you have to call in to make any changes to the reservation. But the restaurant is accommodating and gladly canceled our reservation on another occasion.",4.0
"Had brunch here this weekend and was a bit disappointed. I had the bluefish cakes and my boyfriend had the chef's omelette. The slaw that came with the cakes was very flavorful, but the cakes themselves were kind of bland. Toast was heaped unattractively on the side of the plate, barely toasted and served without any butter. My boyfriend was happy with his omelette though. The bellinis, on the other hand, were quite delicious, especially the last mouthful of boozy peach pulp. The interior of the restaurant is quite beautiful, sort of a traditional streamlined elegance, and there is a nice outdoor seating area. Another silly thing that bothered me was that the waitstaff was pretty sloppily dressed, which felt at odds with the general aesthetic of the restaurant.  Overall, the food was OK, but for the price, I left wishing I had made brunch at home. I will likely come back and see if lunch or dinner fares better.",3.0

I got the create-your-own omelette with tomato, spinach, mushrooms, and andouille. Cooked to perfection. Best omelette I've had. The egg is light and fluffy too - there's a note at the bottom of the menu that says their chickens have never seen a light bulb and all the eggs are organic.

The service was alright nothing special but we weren't ignored either so that was acceptable.  Food was also okay, I had the short rib hash, which was a little too greasy for my taste and the husband had steak and eggs, though he asked for sunny side up his eggs came scrambled.  But since we couldn't wait to get out of there he ended up not sending it back.  Overall we did not enjoy our experience at all.",2.0

"After a rigorous 3.5 hour session at the Brooklyn Boulders rock gym (belay certified bitches!), I decided to grab a late brunch in the Park Slope area.I wanted something ""brunchy"" but not overly so. The thought of bacon and pancakes did not appeal to me as I had just spent three plus hours attempting to burn off a pound of pasta I had eaten the night before. After using my Yelp app to scout places nearby, I came upon Stone Park Café which had glowing brunch reviews.I came in around 2:45 and still had to wait 5 minutes to get a table. You can tell this place is pretty popular amongst the locals with everyone laughing, talking and downing Bloody Marys and Mimosas. Once I was seated, I was handed a menu and stared at it intently for five minutes before being asked if I was ready. I was torn between so many delicious looking options that I asked my waitress for help. In the end, I decided upon the Pan Seared Bluefish Cakes with celery root slaw, poached eggs and caper Hollandaise. It came with toast too so I had a choice between white, wheat, rye, and sourdough. I have a tremendous liking for crab cakes and after being told that the fishcakes were prepared in that style, I was sold. (Just to note, almost all the brunch options are in the $12-17 range with sides being in the $3-7 range. It's not especially cheap but I don't think it qualifies as expensive either.)My dish came out about 10 minutes later piping hot with two slices of freshly toasted wheat bread on the side. Mmm lightly buttered toast. Before diving in and devouring my meal, I took a picture of it to capture its beauty. Everything tasted so fresh and homemade from scratch. The celery root slaw was so yummy and I'm not even fond of coleslaw! The potatoes were slightly crispy on the outside, just how I like 'em. The eggs looked like fluffy little white pillows topped with a creamy Hollandaise sauce with capers. With an effortless slice of my knife, the golden, runny yolk oozed out and drenched the fishcake beneath them. I had a wonderful time trying to scoop fishcake, egg, Hollandaise sauce, and caper all into one bite on my fork. The cakes were lightly crisp on the outside and soft and flaky on the inside which were comprised of mostly meat and very little breading. I asked for a little lemon to sprinkle on my cake as I always do that for my seafood. Old habits die hard. The whole meal was scrumptious and there was nothing left on my plate at the end save a slice of toast and a few crumbs. I highly recommend this dish if you are craving something delectable that departs away from the standard brunch options.Despite the couple next to me arguing bitterly over something stupid that only couples would do in a public place, I had a very relaxing and delicious meal. The staff kept asking me how I liked it and were very attentive in a non-overbearing way. Throughout my brunch I took note of the odd choice in music that was being played especially for the type of place Stone Park Café is. I specifically recall hearing Black and Yellow and F*ck You and watching the wait staff lip syncing the words while chilling in the front inbetween serving their tables. Ha.In hindsight, I probably should have gotten a Bloody Mary but drinking alone on a Sunday afternoon is against my rules. I can't wait to go back to Stone Park Café for another brunch and try their Eggs Benedict, Short Rib Hash and the Hangtown Fry (as I couldn't order all of those for myself this time). Oh and biscuits. I saw their biscuits and now I want those biscuits. Nothing is more delicious for brunch than a freshly baked biscuit that you almost choke on after taking a humongous bite of once inhaling its intoxicating smell. Which reminds me, I need to work on smaller bites and chewing.",4.0
"Bloodys were great (love the oversized caper). Eggs Benedict with spinach and bacon were EH.  My girlfriend ordered the house smoked salmon on bagel and it was Good.  French fries tasted and looked like they had been frozen - I dont know why I use this as a marker, but if a nice place uses crappy frozen fries I deduct major points.  How hard is it to serve fries that once were potatoes?  Overall a decent experience.  Might just go for the bloody next time.",2.0

"I came here for brunch on a Sunday and we were seated quickly. I chose to get the eggs benedict with both the canadian bacon AND spinach, more definitely can't hurt right? The dish didn't really cut it for me. The potatoes were bland, I thought they could have had more texture or spice. The canadian bacon had no crisp or saltiness, it wasn't savory. If it was only the eggs benedict with the spinach, I probably would have been more pleased. On the upside, it is a nice atmosphere for a Sunday Summer brunch.",2.0
Poached eggs were overcooked but the english muffin was so perfectly toasted and still yet chewy that I can't really be that angry. Bacon there is pretty awesome. Potatoes on the side were tasty. Everyone else's eggs looked fine - just always me that gets the hard ones!,3.0
Everything is great here people!The Food- the service- everything...it has got it all!My obsession this week is their squid ink tagliatelle with shrimp and speck in a light tomato sauce...Seriously...STUPIDLY DELISH! I kinda can't stop thinking about it!My boyfriend ALWAYS gets the burger...it might be his favorite burger in town...and he does eat a lot of burgers.Great brunch too- the eggs with short rib hash in YUM!,5.0
"BRUNCH REVIEWNo wait?? GREAT! Ambiance: Hip and chillFood:  DELICIOUS! All the items on the menu looked so amazing so every one ordered a different dish so we can try them.  Short Rib Hash, better than corned beef hash!!  Poached egg complimented the bluefish cakes perfectly and the fried oysters with frittata filled our bellies to the brim.  They gave us jelly that tasted homemade.  Couldn't decipher whether it was raspberries or some combination of berries.",5.0
"The rating is really for the food. Otherwise, service was OK, and the place is buzzing (I was there for Sunday brunch). It was my 2nd time there. The first time was rather pleasant, so I was pretty excited to go back. We had fish cakes, omelet and quiche, and nothing was good. The hash brown was extremely dry, the fries not cooked enough, soggy instead of crispy... The hollandaise caper sauce was put there to bring flavors, I'm guessing, but just ended up making the dish heavy and not enjoyable.  Just look at the picture of the quiche: doesn't that look like the worst cafeteria food?",1.0
"Stone Park Cafe has a great brunch menu, once you put your name on the list they'll call you when your table is ready so you can run to the playground with the kids for 45m or head over to the farmers market for a few.  Their outdoor tables are perfect in the spring, you don't feel like you're eating ON the street.  Staff is great, coffee is good, and they have high chairs and (some) space for kids.",4.0
This place was so great that we went for brunch AND dinner in the same day. Their fishcake eggs Benedict was simply divine especially when paired with a spicy Bloody Mary. I had the burger for dinner which was perfectly prepared and everything I could have hoped for wrapped in a sesame bun. I will definitely go back again before I leave NY. Consistently delicious food with excellent friendly service.,5.0
"After a rigorous 3.5 hour session at the Brooklyn Boulders rock gym (belay certified bitches!), I decided to grab a late brunch in the Park Slope area.I wanted something ""brunchy"" but not overly so. The thought of bacon and pancakes did not appeal to me as I had just spent three plus hours attempting to burn off a pound of pasta I had eaten the night before. After using my Yelp app to scout places nearby, I came upon Stone Park Café which had glowing brunch reviews.I came in around 2:45 and still had to wait 5 minutes to get a table. You can tell this place is pretty popular amongst the locals with everyone laughing, talking and downing Bloody Marys and Mimosas. Once I was seated, I was handed a menu and stared at it intently for five minutes before being asked if I was ready. I was torn between so many delicious looking options that I asked my waitress for help. In the end, I decided upon the Pan Seared Bluefish Cakes with celery root slaw, poached eggs and caper Hollandaise. It came with toast too so I had a choice between white, wheat, rye, and sourdough. I have a tremendous liking for crab cakes and after being told that the fishcakes were prepared in that style, I was sold.

"Have you brunched lately? That seems to be the trend nowadays and if you haven't, you must be from out of town. I visit NYC once every month and go brunching with my friends over the weekend. This past weekend I was in Brooklyn and my friends and I checked out this cafe. First off, I loved that they are good at seating groups big and small. We placed our name on the waiting list and were called as soon as our table was ready (that's what I call great follow through). And if you are brunching on Sundays, Park Slope has a farmer's market from 10AM-5PM every other Sunday during the summer time. What a great way to kill time waiting for a table. Next, the waitstaff are friendly and helpful when making meal decisions. We got a great table and enjoyed our meal quite a bit. Did I mention that they have outdoor seating as well (great for beautiful sunny weather). I enjoyed their passion fruit champagne cocktail; it was fruity and bubbly. I was pleased with my Sourdough French Toast with berry compote and maple syrup. It was delicious and not too heavy. It was my first real French Toast experience and I give it an A. I wouldn't mind going back to try other dishes. Keep up the good work guys!",3.0
"Went here on a ""date"" and I enjoyed that my server was all smiles and enjoyed my company (at least I felt that way). I almost wanted to be her friend at the end of the day but I'd probably weird her out and scare her away :-)We had almost the entire ""market menu"", which changes every day. It included chicken liver and ravoli in a creamy/black mushroom sauce as the appetizer choices, salmon or steak as the entree, and a choice of desserts from cheese plate/ice cream/sorbet/panna cotta. We had all except the panna cotta.The presentation was great and made the food very appetizing. The lighting is very good for the mood and I enjoyed every second of my time there. I am very sensitive to salty things so the cheeses and the steak were too salty for me.

"As for the food, 3 stars. Quality, good. Price, too high. Atmosphere, Baaaaad. Especially considering it was Valentine's Day. We would have gladly paid $ 70 per person for 3 course meal if the food was phenomenal and the atmosphere was romantic enough. My 1st course was beet salad with hazel nuts. It was good.  Main was NY strip. Perfectly cooked to order. Good beef. Dessert was Chocolate Torte. It was good. Just enough sweetness. Very thick. Very good. My husband's was almost the same, but the dessert. It was lemon pudding cake which we agreed we did not like at all. Too much lemon zest or something. Personal preference. Food was good. Perhaps good enough for regular meal, but not good enough for $70 meal. Nothing was outstanding. I wish the person on the phone could have told us they only had Valentine's Day special on that day. Then, we would have not gone there at all. Oh, well. Stuff like that happens. We should have known. That was not the worst we had that day.  There was a family who brought a baby and a kid. OK, this is Park Slope, I get it. I love kids, I don't mind seeing them, or having them at dinner, If, we were not paying frankly over priced meal at a supposedly great restaurant with great atmosphere. The dinner was ruined by their constant camera flash, and the mother's loud voice. The baby started crying. I understood she was a frequent customer for this restaurant, or owner's friend or something, but really. Do you really need to bring your kids to a nice restaurant for dinner on Valentine's Day? I don't think so. Baby has to cry at some point. Kids have to walk around or nag. That's what they do. So, please. Think about where you take your kids.  Our check came and it was over $200. I expected more from this place. Maybe too much expectation killed the experience.   We probably won't be back for a long time, but maybe some time later. Perhaps not on Valentine's Day.",2.0

Nice choice for brunch in park slope.  Came here another weekend, had the Eggs Benedict outside and it was perfect.  My regular server is a bit surly, not particularly friendly, but the food and coffee is good.",4.0

"Went there last night with a friend and ate at the bar. The bartender was lovely and professional, she let us try several wines before we ordered one. She offered a couple of suggestions and we ended up settling on a very nice and reasonably priced bottle. The food was excellent. We started with the grilled octopus and kale salad. I could have eaten the kale salad all night. We split the cod, it was cooked and seasoned perfectly. Absolutely delicious. As sides we had the spinach and the brussels sprouts which were both excellent. I loved the coconut sorbet for dessert. Overall a really solid meal with nice service. I would go back.",5.0
i was searching for brunch places and this place popped up. Certainly worth waking up early for! okay so 10:30 isn't THAT early but its early for me and my bf haha. Got there around 12:15 and the hostess said that it's around a 20 - 30 min wait. Which was awesome because i couldn't even get a reservation for around that time! And luckily we came around then because soon after the waiting time turned into over an hour.Of course we ordered the eggs benedict with spinach and the shortrib hash. LOVE LOVE LOVE the benedicts. it gives enough flavor and a perfect crunch from the english muffin from each bite. BF loved the hash. It has just enough flavor for him that he didn't even need ketchup. We also ordered a side of fries just for the heck of it and it was good too. Very crispy. Also had a small OJ. love that it's freshly squeezed. I didn't even mind the pulp.The music they play there are so random. which i love. I loved how they were playing MJ to biggie smalls and back to jackson 5....loooove it.I did see a few round tables which can accommodate a smaller group of 6- 8. Will be back again!,5.0

We didn't know we needed to make reservations & despite it being a sat. night we got seated really quickly at the bar which was spacious & nice. The food was GREAT & my bloody marry was perfect :) We got the Marrow Tacos which everyone is raving about and loved them! I got the squid ink pasta w. shrimp ( love that you can get half or full plate ) it was awesome & my bf. got the hanger steak which was cooked perfectly as well. Overall a good experience although being able to sit at a table would have made things even better,5.0
"Upon arrival, we were instantly greeted by several workers, nice friendly welcome but I had a feeling like I was in a Twilight Zone episode. A little eerie.Bloody Mary and the Tequila Bloody one were delicious. Nice and spicy with enough booze to cut through the hangover.My omelet with sausage, mushroom, cheese and peppers was good. Kind of wish I ordered the BLT like my friend did, because that tasted great. Service was accommodating when asked to sub home fries for a salad for my friend.Overall, it was good. Fast, clean, good food, no complaints, just what one expects when going out to eat. I would return for lunch or dinner.",3.0
"As for the food, 3 stars. Quality, good. Price, too high. Atmosphere, Baaaaad. Especially considering it was Valentine's Day. We would have gladly paid $ 70 per person for 3 course meal if the food was phenomenal and the atmosphere was romantic enough. My 1st course was beet salad with hazel nuts. It was good.  Main was NY strip. Perfectly cooked to order. Good beef. Dessert was Chocolate Torte. It was good. Just enough sweetness. Very thick. Very good. My husband's was almost the same, but the dessert. It was lemon pudding cake which we agreed we did not like at all. Too much lemon zest or something. Personal preference. Food was good. Perhaps good enough for regular meal, but not good enough for $70 meal. Nothing was outstanding. I wish the person on the phone could have told us they only had Valentine's Day special on that day. Then, we would have not gone there at all. Oh, well. Stuff like that happens. We should have known. That was not the worst we had that day.  There was a family who brought a baby and a kid. OK, this is Park Slope, I get it. I love kids, I don't mind seeing them, or having them at dinner, If, we were not paying frankly over priced meal at a supposedly great restaurant with great atmosphere. The dinner was ruined by their constant camera flash, and the mother's loud voice. The baby started crying. I understood she was a frequent customer for this restaurant, or owner's friend or something, but really. Do you really need to bring your kids to a nice restaurant for dinner on Valentine's Day? I don't think so. Baby has to cry at some point. Kids have to walk around or nag. That's what they do. So, please. Think about where you take your kids.  Our check came and it was over $200. I expected more from this place. Maybe too much expectation killed the experience.   We probably won't be back for a long time, but maybe some time later. Perhaps not on Valentine's Day.",2.0

WOW. Literally, best eggs benedict I've ever had. The eggs were soft, the hollandaise was creamy, and the english muffin was as fresh as can be. This meal was one of the best I've ever had. The home fries were simply spiced potatoes which I love. My friend got the quiche which she loved.

They decided it was unnecessary to list in the ingredients so their menus could look continually neat and only the stupid patrons would not pick up on this and ask about it.

Stone Park offered top-to-bottom service, including a baker for our wedding cake, and Kosher catering for a few guests who required it.

"Sometimes I pretend I live in Park Slope. With this fantasy also comes other imaginative lies -- I'm married, have children and am heterosexual.However, this is false. I live in a suburb smack dab in the middle of two cities in North Texas -- Fort Worth and Dallas, a far cry from Brooklyn. But hey, Arlington was host of the most recent 2011 Superbowl.However, If I did live in Park Slope, I would be horrendously obese because I would frequent Stone Park Cafe  too much for my own good.This place is great all around. I went here for brunch and dinner and both times, it was outstanding. The price point, service and overall quality, presentation and offering of the menu is what makes me adore this place!A 3 course meal for dinner for a mere 30 dollars? Can't be beat! My favorite is their brunch. Everything is your plain Jane offering -- pancakes, bacon, hash browns and so forth, but there's something extra and unique about them. The pancakes were light, fluffy with a hint of sweetness. I had the Short Rib Hash and eggs - delicious!  Smaller portions, but the quality of the food satiates you and you won't overeat.Another favorite? One of the best teas (Earl Grey)  I've had ever! It is rich and aromatic. I definitely need to go back and see what the brand is.Until I move to Brooklyn, I will dream of Stone Park Cafe, but until then I will have my svelte figure.PS: Updated 08/23/11 -- I am moving to Brooklyn come September 2011. I am fearful for my weight gain.",4.0
"We had dinner at Stone Park Cafe before a concert at the Barclays Center last night. We let our fabulous waiter, Ken, know about our schedule in advance, and he made sure we were out of there in plenty of time. The bartender happily made my requested changes to the drinks we ordered (vodka instead of gin). Then the apps... OMG. We got the grilled baby octopus, which was out of this world: bits of lardon and yellow grape tomatoes gave it just the right counterpoints of salt and acidity. The special was pan-fried sweetbreads over morel mushroom risotto with sautéed ramps... So good it made me want to cry a little (and only $15!!). We both got the burger with gruyere and bacon: burgers were cooked perfectly, meat was flavorful, patty was fully draped in the cheese, and the bacon was just the right thickness. The fries were good, too... No skins on them, though, which I usually like. Altogether, the food exceeded already high expectations, and was very reasonably priced. Finally, as we were standing outside orienting ourselves, Ken came out and handed me my wallet... Which apparently fell out of my bag while we were leaving. Seriously? There were a couple hundred dollars in there, in addition to my WHOLE LIFE... Ken, you're a godsend. Thank you doesn't even begin to express my gratitude.If we lived closer, I'd go there at least every couple of weeks.",5.0
I've only been once but the SHORT RIB HASH is all I need to say. Gave it 4 stars because you can't make reservations for brunch -- which is when this place is super crowded.

"Food was a surprise. The seafood risotto was one of the best I've ever had. It had 4 perfectly tasty clams with two perfectly braised scallops. The Foie Gras was not exceptional for $17 but was certainly adequate.  The corn chowder soup didn't give me chills, but it  was nice and nothing to complain about. It had a young crowd  which I noticed because I am not so young (55).

"Their food is amazing. Their home made pastas are more or less life changing, and their cocktails are creative and powerful!The second time we went, it took a very very long time to get our appetizers. We were having a great time catching up and drinking cocktails, so  though it did not go unnoticed, we were not peeved. They were so apologetic, and when the bill came they had comped both our appetizers and our desserts. Love this place!",5.0
"I like the location of this restaurant because it overlooks the park. Waitstaff are very friendly. The food itself I think it's average.

Hubby had pork chop, which was also alright.I may give it another try.....",3.0
"We had our wedding reception at Stone Park Cafe, and it was the perfect choice. The owners handled the food, table placement and an evolving guest list with professionalism, courtesy, good humor and understanding. The food was excellent. The reception was handled in the rear building, where you can watch the food being prepared in the open kitchen. Stone Park offered top-to-bottom service, including a baker for our wedding cake, and Kosher catering for a few guests who required it. Elizabeth provided a personal touch to planning our wedding reception, making sure that each part was carried out meticulously. She always got back to us quickly, when we had questions. We still go there for brunch. The short rib hash is one of my guilty pleasures.",5.0
"Had brunch here with a friend, I got the quesadilla and an iced tea (unsweetened and yummy) and she got the pancakes with fruit compote and maple syrup, whipped cream too. The food was good, and the atmosphere was great. Not too expensive, you should definitely visit if you're in the area.",4.0
"Sometimes I pretend I live in Park Slope. With this fantasy also comes other imaginative lies -- I'm married, have children and am heterosexual.However, this is false. I live in a suburb smack dab in the middle of two cities in North Texas -- Fort Worth and Dallas, a far cry from Brooklyn. But hey, Arlington was host of the most recent 2011 Superbowl.However, If I did live in Park Slope, I would be horrendously obese because I would frequent Stone Park Cafe  too much for my own good.This place is great all around. I went here for brunch and dinner and both times, it was outstanding. The price point, service and overall quality, presentation and offering of the menu is what makes me adore this place!A 3 course meal for dinner for a mere 30 dollars? Can't be beat! My favorite is their brunch. Everything is your plain Jane offering -- pancakes, bacon, hash browns and so forth, but there's something extra and unique about them. The pancakes were light, fluffy with a hint of sweetness. I had the Short Rib Hash and eggs - delicious!  Smaller portions, but the quality of the food satiates you and you won't overeat.Another favorite? One of the best teas (Earl Grey)  I've had ever! It is rich and aromatic. I definitely need to go back and see what the brand is.Until I move to Brooklyn, I will dream of Stone Park Cafe, but until then I will have my svelte figure.PS: Updated 08/23/11 -- I am moving to Brooklyn come September 2011. I am fearful for my weight gain.",4.0
"We had dinner at Stone Park Cafe before a concert at the Barclays Center last night. We let our fabulous waiter, Ken, know about our schedule in advance, and he made sure we were out of there in plenty of time. The bartender happily made my requested changes to the drinks we ordered (vodka instead of gin). Then the apps... OMG. We got the grilled baby octopus, which was out of this world: bits of lardon and yellow grape tomatoes gave it just the right counterpoints of salt and acidity. The special was pan-fried sweetbreads over morel mushroom risotto with sautéed ramps... So good it made me want to cry a little (and only $15!!). We both got the burger with gruyere and bacon: burgers were cooked perfectly, meat was flavorful, patty was fully draped in the cheese, and the bacon was just the right thickness. The fries were good, too... No skins on them, though, which I usually like. Altogether, the food exceeded already high expectations, and was very reasonably priced. Finally, as we were standing outside orienting ourselves, Ken came out and handed me my wallet... Which apparently fell out of my bag while we were leaving. Seriously? There were a couple hundred dollars in there, in addition to my WHOLE LIFE... Ken, you're a godsend. Thank you doesn't even begin to express my gratitude.If we lived closer, I'd go there at least every couple of weeks.",5.0
I've only been once but the SHORT RIB HASH is all I need to say. Gave it 4 stars because you can't make reservations for brunch -- which is when this place is super crowded. Mimosas were okay but I could sit in here to listen to the music alone for hours. Staff is super friendly along with the ambiance.,4.0
"Food was a surprise. The seafood risotto was one of the best I've ever had. It had 4 perfectly tasty clams with two perfectly braised scallops. The Foie Gras was not exceptional for $17 but was certainly adequate.  The corn chowder soup didn't give me chills, but it  was nice and nothing to complain about. It had a young crowd  which I noticed because I am not so young (55).

Man, that egg yolk mixed with the already decadent sausage-studded gravy was amazing. And the biscuits weren't the best I've ever had, but perfect for sopping up that hot mess of a gravy concoction. My friend got the Hangtown Fry, which sounded odd to me, but I can rarely say no to fried oysters. This was great, but I think the simple combination of the gravy and egg really kind of stole the show - everyone liked that best. We recommended these two dishes to the people sitting next to us, they thanked us profusely for the suggestion. Oh, the short rib hash also got a thumbs up from everyone.

"Possibly my new favorite brunch spot in Brooklyn. We came here to treat a friend for his birthday. It was a weekday, so it was relatively quiet when we were there. The decor is charming from what I saw; but since we dined outside, I didn't get to enjoy it too much. While there, we ordered the Stone Park BLT, Steak Sandwich, and a few beers. There was a third sandwich that I currently cant recall, but I do remember everything being delicious. The BLT wasn't exactly what I expected. In actuality it featured a wonderfully cooked cut of pork belly, not slices of bacon; loved it. I also had a taste of the birthday boy's steak sandwich; loved it as well. Beefy, tender, and juicy; it everything I could ask for in a good sandwich. After cleaning our plates, we were ready to throw in the towel. Surprisingly though, our waiter brought out complimentary desserts after hearing about our friend's birthday. This may have been the first time I've ever experienced this. I can only wish to receive the same treatment for my birthday. Anyway, we were given a cappucino cheesecake, lemon tart, and chocolate pudding. The entire party agreed that the pudding was the best, but then again, everything tastes good when it's free. Needless to say, I fell in love with this place. I still have yet to try their dinner menu, but I definitely will do so in the future. Bravo, Stone Park Cafe, you'll forever have a place in my heart.",5.0
"As per usual, it's definitely who you're with -and what you're celebrating- that can make or break a dining experience.

Even humored us to the perfect extent. I had the squid ink tagliatelle with a side of sauteed spinach. The pasta was amazing - sorta spicy (which my followers know I adore) yet so full of taste. I got to try the asparagus soup and cod entree as well as the raviolis. All yummy. Very rich. We had a spicy and bold red wine to complete our fabulous (mood) night. Oh and I almost forgot, we shared some housemade coconut, vanilla and mango sorbet/icecream. The way I felt about ramen last winter is the way I feel about coconut iced desserts this summer.

"I'm not impressed.I went here this past Saturday for brunch with my boyfriend. When we went there they told us it was about a 30 minute wait and asked for my phone number. We left the place for about 15 minutes to get a pastry down the street and when we came back it looked like all the line s has dissipated. We went inside, asked about our placement, and they pretty much gave us some weird bullshit answer about the rain and they brought people in early because of it and never bothered to call etc.  We stood around the front for about 5 minutes before they called us in to be seated. Let me tell you this, service is slow. Waiters need to be flagged down and it is about 10-15 minutes before they will approach your area for an order or service.Ordering, I was torn between the hangers fry (tempura oysters with bacon eggs and cheese) and the burger. I opted with the burger since we heard a waiter recommend it over the hanger fry to another table. I ordered the burger medium rare and it came to me medium to well done and very dry. The fries were okay (like McDonald's fries) and the portion was hefty. Nothing to write home about or try again. My boyfriend ordered the eggs benedict. The portion was small and his side of home fries was like 5 mini chunks of potato. Very sad in comparison with my large burger and fries which was only like 2 dollars more. I regretted ordering the burger instead of the hanger fry since I saw a man at a table in front of us enjoying it. I regretted it until I saw him begin to bull things out of his mouth from the oyster. We then heard him comment that one of them was a pearl, at which point he pulled a small ball out of his mouth....The table next to us was served an omelet which was completed undercooked and runny inside and by the time a replacement came out her partner had already finished his meal. Their attitude towards the whole thing was quite sad. There wasn't even an apology. When the woman complained about it, the waitress just sort of looked at her with this ""so what do you want me to do look"" until the woman told her she wanted it replaced.

"The quality and taste of the food are wonderful. I just found it surprising that their dinner menu is very limited for a vegetarian.

The waiter flat out told me he didn't see the point of ordering the dishes without the meat because there would be nothing on the plate. At least a few of the appetizers are vegetarian, as are most of the sides. I guess it's good that the only vegetarian entree, the Swiss chard raviolini, is absolutely delicious. There are 5 little guys in a half-order, so eat all the bread and order an appetizer/side or get a full-order if you're very hungry. The butternut squash soup was nice and creamy, though it wasn't as strongly spiced as I expect butternut squash soup to be. Plus, I almost laughed when I saw the 3 teeny tiny croutons on top. We had to wait for a bit despite a reservation, and the host was so sweet and said he would send us something, which ended up being 3 scoops of sorbet at the end. The pear sorbet is especially good.

The prices at Stone Park keep it from being a 4 star spot though. It's just not good enough to warrant the cost.I had the burger sans fries. It was pretty tasty; the meat had the right amount of fat, but it was pretty under-seasoned and I didn't like the roll it was served with. My companions had the BLT and the biscuits with gravy. The BLT was okay but it needed a heartier bread, less crispy pork belly, and better quality tomatoes. The biscuits and gravy with eggs and a side of greens were easily the stars of the meal. The gravy was decadent; a PERFECT dish and worth its hefty price tag. Everything else? Not so much. If the same meal cost us $50 instead of $90, I'd return every weekend.

It was pretty tasty; the meat had the right amount of fat, but it was pretty under-seasoned and I didn't like the roll it was served with. My companions had the BLT and the biscuits with gravy. The BLT was okay but it needed a heartier bread, less crispy pork belly, and better quality tomatoes. The biscuits and gravy with eggs and a side of greens were easily the stars of the meal. The gravy was decadent; a PERFECT dish and worth its hefty price tag. Everything else? Not so much. If the same meal cost us $50 instead of $90, I'd return every weekend. As it is, I just don't think it's worth the price.",3.0
The food here was delicious and the service was excellent. My only complaint was the portion of the dishes.  We did leave here slightly hungry and the food wasn't that amazing where they can make the portions so small. But we did enjoy the Short Rib Hash and Hangtown Fry.,4.0
"Tasty steak and eggs for brunch. Also tried their pancakes and French toast. All of their food was quite good.The place was quite packed, so it's a good idea to make reservations or plan to wait.Drinks are a little expensive at $9 a glass for smallish servings. Coffee refills were pretty slow too.Great food, service a little slow, but definitely worth the visit.",4.0
Went for brunch. Great service.The potatoes had to much pepper on them.The apple pie dessert was great!!!  Ill,4.0
"A great brunch spot.  Staff is friendly and courteous.  Mixed crowd.  Young, old, dudes, couples, families.  The only con is the music was pop and a tad loud, but this flaw allows you to have private conservations.  Do not expect a quiet dining atmosphere on a Sunday morning!  Fantastic Bloody Marys...strong and perfect.  Hangtown Fry oysters were AMAZING.  Perfectly fried.  A true feat to fry a perfect oyster...crunchy and light.  The pan seared blue fish cakes were a tad fishy...which is a shame because every other ingredient on the plate was awesome and perfectly cooked.  Loved the celery root slaw.  Perfect poached eggs!  Next time going to try the grits and shrimp.  I have to say, this is not the nicest restaurant in Park Slope (which many reviewers tout) but it is worth a visit!",4.0
"One of my favorites in Park Slope.  I have been 3 times now and it is consistently great! All the food tastes so fresh and seems so original. Service is always good, ambiance is lovely and service is always just right. I love going here and will definitely be back!",5.0
"I've only been for brunch but was very impressed.  This place quickly became my go-to for out of town guests.  It's easy to see why they get rave reviews.  The short rib hash is amazing!Seating is usually not a problem (for brunch), the few times I've been the wait was never longer than twenty minutes and the place is pretty spacious.",4.0
"My girlfriend and I had our mothers in town and we were all staying with friends in Park Slope. Another friend had recommended Stone Park Cafe so we gave it a shot... Unfortunately, at first there was a 45 minute wait... So I put my name on the list and we were on our way to find some immediate brunch. However, within 5 minutes, they called me letting me know there was a cancellation. We returned and were seated immediately. We all started with Blood Mary's which included this olive looking thing on a stem... apparently they're called caper berries. I'd describe it as a cross between an olive and a pickle. I enjoyed it as well as the Bloody Mary. As an appetizer we all shared their french toast which was excellent. I got the Short Rib Hash which a BOMB!! Came with 2 eggs any style on top (I got sunny side up eggs) with choice of toast (I got sour dough). My mom got the Spicy Omelet which was also very good. My girlfriend and her mom both got the basic 2 Eggs, bacon, and sausage with toast.. Hard to mess that up.. I will definitely be back here the next time I'm in Park Slope. The service was fast and friendly and the environment was very comfortable... Great spot to bring the girl you hooked up with the night before... That is if you want to see her again.",5.0
"Wow.While everything was fantastic, I have to say that starting out our three (plus one surprise) course meal with the short rib slider catapulted Stone Park Cafe into a five-star rating right off the bat. It was one of the most incredible things I ever tasted and I took that moment to thank God for not making me a vegetarian. 12 of us were there for Christine J.'s bachelorette party and the menu had been pre-selected beforehand by Stephanie J., maid of honor and sister of the bride. We had three options to choose from for each course and I selected the short rib slider, the hangar steak with artichoke hearts, and the lemon pudding cake with raspberry compote. Everything was fantastic, even down to the side salad sitting next to the slider. You'd think it was only put there to take up some space, but it had a light tangy/sweet, but vinegary dressing that made it more than just a garnish. I don't remember if it was before the steak or after, but the chef sent us a little surprise ""mezzo"" dish of pancetta-wrapped asparagus with a house ricotta and what I think was mole; the whole thing was to die for. The cheese was super rich, but very tasty, and the asparagus was cooked to perfection with a bit of a crispness to it that survived the cooking. The hangar steak was cooked perfectly medium as requested and tasted like summer. You know what I'm talking about -- the char-grilled smoky crispy ends surrounding the juicy bursting-with-flavor middles? Yum. Oh, and the artichoke hearts, which hid underneath the steak, as if perfectly aware of their own subordination to the steak, the real star, were probably the most amazing artichoke hearts I ever had. They were so tender and flavorful -- I think flavored with parmesan? They were incredible.And -- sigh -- dessert! A lemon pudding cake atop a drizzle of raspberry compote. There isn't really much to say besides WOW. Everything about this meal was fabulous: the food, the company, the atmosphere, the service -- oh the service! We were a big party which I know can be annoying for waitstaff, but the service at Stone Park Cafe was top notch; especially Elizabeth, who helped weeks ago with the planning stages and really came through to make sure we all had a fabulous time and that Christine J. was sent off into married life with style. :)",5.0
"This place needs to be featured in Maxim's next bacon porn column.  The ""scrambled eggs with bacon"" brunch dish should be renamed ""bacon with scrambled eggs"" because three extra-long, extra-wide, perfectly crisped and spiced strips of bacon dominate the plate.  The eggs were pretty good too, and I appreciated the choice of sourdough toast, but the bacon was what transformed a good dish into a food-gasm. The taste was so addictive, it makes me want to make Stone Park my default brunch spot, and that would suit me perfectly well because the prices are very reasonable, the servers are attentive, and the place feels clean, bright, and modern.",5.0
"Throw me a bone, here.  I'm a vegan.  Now I know I should've looked at the menu before I went but I assumed there'd be *something* I could eat.  We went for brunch and it was frustrating b/c they were so close from being able to accomodate vegetarians and vegans but just missed the mark.  That said, kudos to them for using cage-free eggs.  Vegetarians will love their pancakes, french toast and omelettes.  They have granola and yogurt, but no soy yogurt.  They have turkey sausage, but no veggie sausage.  If they would carry just a few items like this vegans could dine here regularly too.",3.0
"I've actually been to the Stone Park Cafe quite a few times, because I actually LIVE IN BROOKLYN! Can you imagine? The percentage of patrons at Stone Park who are Brooklynites may crack 4% on a typical weekend. And as for people like me who were born in Brooklyn, well, forget it. To give you an idea of the Stone Park crowd, some years ago I had never heard of the place. A VP from IBM who lived and worked in Cambridge, Mass. asked me to have lunch to discuss a project and said he'd be happy to come down to Brooklyn. I thought that was very cool of him. I told him I'd be happy for him to pick a place that was near the airport, Amtrak, or wherever, but no, he suggested the Stone Park Cafe. Which meant that it's in the IBM book of where to entertain people. Right off I was suspicious. But as I said, I've been back often. Why? Good looking women. I'm like a bird watcher except I like to look at attractive women. The ambiance is pleasant especially weekdays when it's not full. Meghan, the weekend bartender, and sweet and cheery. Which is amazing, considering the bar is packed with Long Islanders and Jerseyites waiting for tables. ""Oh boy, what's good heah?"" they ask me. ""You see this fashion model to my left?"", I reply. ""She looks good"". To you 23 year old drunks, this isn't a place where you go to get blasted. It's about food. And let me tell you about the food.I swear this is true: everything tastes the same. Everything. You can have a beautiful looking brunch of poached eggs on bluefish hash, and it tastes the same as the oyster po' boy. The oyster po'boy, by the way is a hero (sub) with about 5 deep fried oysters in it. Dude, you will not have an appetite for 2 days after you eat one. It's so filling your car will run 600 miles on what you ate. I do like the soups, although they do taste pretty much like everything else. There are no stones in the park next door. No grass either. The wait staff is pleasant and accommodating. I made a writer for New York magazine take me there for an interview (he was quite put out and turned out to be an unethical bum) but they opened a closed section for us so no one would be able to listen in. That was classy. Oh, and get this: a lunch dish of granola on the menu every day as follows: a little granola, not home made, some Fage yogurt (says so on the menu) and fresh fruit, $12. WHAT????",2.0

Sometimes the food is too salty and i wish it cost a bit less but i am overall delighted with Stone Park Cafe.",4.0
"I think the mains at Stone Park can go toe to toe and even slightly edge Al Di La down the street, in the battle for top Park Slope restaurant. The entire menu at Al Di La might be better, but I've always enjoyed my entree at Stone Park better. Of course, the cuisine isn't exactly apples to apples, but I still consider both establishments among the top upscale choices in this area.Also, Stone Park has an interesting, spacious, dining area and the little things like the warm bread they bring you make all the difference. It was so good in fact that we asked them where their bakery was (a spot in Long Island City, actually forget the name of it now).

"The second dinner I wouldn't want to pay for myself, chosen based on a recommendation from a neighborhood friend who used to live nearby the restaurant.First of all, I had made a 7:30pm reservation on a holiday weekend Sunday, but called to say we were probably going to be early... but I wasn't sure how early. No problem, I was told: they'd bump our reservation up to 6:30pm, but hold the table until 7pm. Now, maybe business doesn't get going until 7pm, but still -- this is UNHEARD of in New York City! So nice. They have a $32 daily three-course market menu -- a GREAT deal considering their prices. But I wasn't paying my own way. I ordered my first course a la carte off the market menu: clams in a saffron broth with bacon and tomato. It was warm, salty, and delicious, served with grilled, olive oily bread to dip in the broth (and homemade sourdough when your run out of that). My sister ordered the brussels spouts salad: paper-thinly grated brussels sprouts and onions with pecoriono in a grain mustard vinaigrette -- another dish I'll be attempting nightly to recreate at home. It was so good that Brian ordered a second! For dinner, my mom and I shared the 35 oz. aged ribeye. To be fair, it must be weighed bone-in because, while it certainly isn't skimpy, it's not as gratuitous as it sounds. My sister ordered the hangar steak which was also good, but only served to point out how tasty the aged meat was, seared to medium-rare perfection. It's served a la carte as well, so we ordered a side of spinach (that I'm pretty sure was actually chard).  The bottom line: From my first phone call to make a reservation, the service was impeccable, and the food lived up to the high first impression.

I've lived in the neighborhood for years and it's simply overrated. I like the location and the food is good but by no means deserves 4 stars. It's not great or exceptional.

"The short version: The manager that night was very nice, but the rest of the staff was unhelpful and lied to us and in the end, we left before ordering because we were so offended with how we were treated.My wife and I called ahead and asked if we needed a reservation, we were told there were empty tables and we should just walk in. We walked the five blocks and were told that there were no tables available and we'd have to wait 10-15 minutes maximum. After 20 minutes, we were told there were some tables that needed to be reset. A party of four walked in and got a table ahead of us. After 25 minutes, the manager came over and asked if everything was alright, we said that the host told us there were tables available soon. After 30 minutes, the manager said there were tables being reset (10 minutes after the host told us the same thing).When we were seated, we were seated in front of the doors that open to their patio seating, which had a terrible draft from the outside (early November) and made sitting uncomfortable. We saw two tables available and asked if we could move because we were uncomfortable at our table. We were told that we'd have to wait until another table cleared off. We decided to leave and go to Belleville, where we were seated within 30 seconds of being in the door and the staff was nothing but overly friendly.I probably won't ever go back to Stone Park Cafe after this experience.",2.0
"The food is not too bad, but one of the waiter stink!!!! He was very horrible. I wanted to take my mom to a wonderful brunch, that my date had me experienced there, and I also had the privilege to take my good friend there. I wanted my mom to experience the same. It turned out to be a huge disaster. I haven't felt this angry in a while...it's like, a different kind of angry...and it's because of a white guy racial profiled my mom and I.So this is what had happened: We get there, of course we had to wait to be seated BC of its popularity...we get there, the guy says its about a 30 min wait if you want to be inside, but I can seat you outside right now. Simple. Sweet. We said we'll wait. But then we went to look to see how much shade there would be outside.  Well as we went outside to see if we were gonna be hit with direct sunlight or not, one of the waiters was like, 'oh the entrance is around the corner'.So we politely told him we know, we spoke to the gentlemen up front, we just was seeing how much shade there was back here.Then he was like, 'yeah well the entrance is in the front and we don't want any fights breaking out. Ok so we went round the front, told the nice host that we would like to be seated outside. He said no problem guys right this way. However! Our waiter was so disgusting my mother and I was both uneasy. I was sooooo livid. he even suggested an area where the trees were to give us even more shade.  I asked about the lunch menu. He said they don't have lunch only brunch on weekends I said ok. And smiled. But he was going in so I had to cut him off! Mind you, all that ""we don't want y'all to break out in a fight"" bs I didn't even hear. My mom heard him.Ok so boom, he have our food to another table! A couple seated next to us.They looked at us and were like, ""I think this is your food"". So we took the plates. I was pissed off at the waiter.When his ass came floating around, I told him, umm you seem to have a lil bit of a mix up with the food. You gave this couple our food. He looked like, yeah ok whatever.But mind you as he was floating around and finally came to us, before I could even tell him of his mix up , he looked at us saying, ""You're looking at me, do you need some HOT SAUCE""!?!?!?!?!?!?!?The air got sooooo thick that even the couple next to us were painfully quiet. He ruined my moment with my mom. It was suppose to be a lovely brunch with her. And he ruined itI had home fries on my plate. How about asking me would I like some KETCHUP!?I was so angry and trying to keep my cool at the same time  I could screamThe couple next to us, the women, got up and went inside and spoke to him. Even they were upset.My mother kept trying to be her motherly self and woo me so that I could calm down. Bless her heart. She knew how badly I wanted us to enjoy this day I set out for the two of us.I could hardly eat. She barely ate. When the check came it was $26.15. I paid $26.25. Racist Disgusting Low Class waiter. When we left, my mother said to me, 'I haven't felt like that in a while'. That broke my heart to hear her say that. Never again.",1.0
The food was very good brunch food.  However in NYC where most of the places have GOOD brunch food I was expecting this to be better since the reviews were pretty high.  We did not have a reservation and they got us seated party of 5 pretty quickly.  I don't eat meat so brunch places usually have 2 things - french toast and pancakes that are available for mee the carb monster.  I wasn't really thrilled with the french toast. My cousin had the pancakes and they weren't all that great either. Good not GREAT.Pissed at the $9 champagna drinks that were small.  I like a stiff drink with my brunch.   The service was not very good.  Not good with coffee refills - my aunt actually walked up and poured herself a cup because we couldn't wait much longer.,3.0

So nice. They have a $32 daily three-course market menu -- a GREAT deal considering their prices. But I wasn't paying my own way. I ordered my first course a la carte off the market menu: clams in a saffron broth with bacon and tomato. It was warm, salty, and delicious, served with grilled, olive oily bread to dip in the broth (and homemade sourdough when your run out of that). My sister ordered the brussels spouts salad: paper-thinly grated brussels sprouts and onions with pecoriono in a grain mustard vinaigrette -- another dish I'll be attempting nightly to recreate at home. It was so good that Brian ordered a second! For dinner, my mom and I shared the 35 oz. aged ribeye. To be fair, it must be weighed bone-in because, while it certainly isn't skimpy, it's not as gratuitous as it sounds. My sister ordered the hangar steak which was also good, but only served to point out how tasty the aged meat was, seared to medium-rare perfection. It's served a la carte as well, so we ordered a side of spinach (that I'm pretty sure was actually chard).  The bottom line: From my first phone call to make a reservation, the service was impeccable, and the food lived up to the high first impression. ERF",4.0
I've lived in the neighborhood for years and it's simply overrated. I like the location and the food is good but by no means deserves 4 stars. It's not great or exceptional. It's always above average to good. The wine list is the best part of dinner. Brunch has degraded over the years in food quality and service.,3.0
"Everything was delicious! Ordered lattes, short rib hash, biscuits with gravy and sausage.",5.0
"The short version: The manager that night was very nice, but the rest of the staff was unhelpful and lied to us and in the end, we left before ordering because we were so offended with how we were treated.My wife and I called ahead and asked if we needed a reservation, we were told there were empty tables and we should just walk in. We walked the five blocks and were told that there were no tables available and we'd have to wait 10-15 minutes maximum. After 20 minutes, we were told there were some tables that needed to be reset. A party of four walked in and got a table ahead of us. After 25 minutes, the manager came over and asked if everything was alright, we said that the host told us there were tables available soon. After 30 minutes, the manager said there were tables being reset (10 minutes after the host told us the same thing).When we were seated, we were seated in front of the doors that open to their patio seating, which had a terrible draft from the outside (early November) and made sitting uncomfortable. We saw two tables available and asked if we could move because we were uncomfortable at our table. We were told that we'd have to wait until another table cleared off. We decided to leave and go to Belleville, where we were seated within 30 seconds of being in the door and the staff was nothing but overly friendly.I probably won't ever go back to Stone Park Cafe after this experience.",2.0
"The food is not too bad, but one of the waiter stink!!!! He was very horrible. I wanted to take my mom to a wonderful brunch, that my date had me experienced there, and I also had the privilege to take my good friend there. I wanted my mom to experience the same. It turned out to be a huge disaster. I haven't felt this angry in a while...it's like, a different kind of angry...and it's because of a white guy racial profiled my mom and I.So this is what had happened: We get there, of course we had to wait to be seated BC of its popularity...we get there, the guy says its about a 30 min wait if you want to be inside, but I can seat you outside right now. Simple. Sweet. We said we'll wait. But then we went to look to see how much shade there would be outside.  Well as we went outside to see if we were gonna be hit with direct sunlight or not, one of the waiters was like, 'oh the entrance is around the corner'.So we politely told him we know, we spoke to the gentlemen up front, we just was seeing how much shade there was back here.Then he was like, 'yeah well the entrance is in the front and we don't want any fights breaking out. Ok so we went round the front, told the nice host that we would like to be seated outside. He said no problem guys right this way. However! Our waiter was so disgusting my mother and I was both uneasy. I was sooooo livid. he even suggested an area where the trees were to give us even more shade.  I asked about the lunch menu. He said they don't have lunch only brunch on weekends I said ok. And smiled. But he was going in so I had to cut him off! Mind you, all that ""we don't want y'all to break out in a fight"" bs I didn't even hear. My mom heard him.Ok so boom, he have our food to another table! A couple seated next to us.They looked at us and were like, ""I think this is your food"". So we took the plates. I was pissed off at the waiter.When his ass came floating around, I told him, umm you seem to have a lil bit of a mix up with the food. You gave this couple our food. He looked like, yeah ok whatever.But mind you as he was floating around and finally came to us, before I could even tell him of his mix up , he looked at us saying, ""You're looking at me, do you need some HOT SAUCE""!?!?!?!?!?!?!?The air got sooooo thick that even the couple next to us were painfully quiet. He ruined my moment with my mom. It was suppose to be a lovely brunch with her. And he ruined itI had home fries on my plate. How about asking me would I like some KETCHUP!?I was so angry and trying to keep my cool at the same time  I could screamThe couple next to us, the women, got up and went inside and spoke to him. Even they were upset.My mother kept trying to be her motherly self and woo me so that I could calm down. Bless her heart. She knew how badly I wanted us to enjoy this day I set out for the two of us.I could hardly eat. She barely ate. When the check came it was $26.15. I paid $26.25. Racist Disgusting Low Class waiter. When we left, my mother said to me, 'I haven't felt like that in a while'. That broke my heart to hear her say that. Never again.",1.0
The food was very good brunch food.  However in NYC where most of the places have GOOD brunch food I was expecting this to be better since the reviews were pretty high.  We did not have a reservation and they got us seated party of 5 pretty quickly.  I don't eat meat so brunch places usually have 2 things - french toast and pancakes that are available for mee the carb monster.  I wasn't really thrilled with the french toast. My cousin had the pancakes and they weren't all that great either. Good not GREAT.Pissed at the $9 champagna drinks that were small.  I like a stiff drink with my brunch.   The service was not very good.  Not good with coffee refills - my aunt actually walked up and poured herself a cup because we couldn't wait much longer.,3.0

"I have only ever been to Stone Park Cafe for brunch, and it's usually a mobscene, but always delicious. I wanted to take my Husbo somewhere new, and this was the ideal spot.

Husbo had prix fixe, which was lovely hamachi salad (I didn't try it) and he had the branzino with lentils and mustard. Incredibly fresh, the tangy mustard grains were a perfect complement to the lentils and fish. This place has incredible food. Bartender Angela (?) is a doll, and our server was really great. Friendly, not overbearing. Really great meal. I can't wait to go back.The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is that the layout is a bit odd.

"When Mom comes to town I usually take her to Rosewater for brunch, but decided to give this place a try.The service was a bit slow, we had to ask for coffee twice, and then again for each subsequent refill, but it was worth the wait for the delicious locally-roasted brew. (and they had Sweet-n-Low, which is our artificial sweetner of choice, at Rosewater she always has to fish a pink packet out of her overly-stocked Mom purse)I had the bluefish cakes with poached eggs and celery root slaw. Very flavorful and fresh. Mom had two eggs with potatoes and chorizo, which was spicy and delicious. The standout was the sourdough toast. Oh mama, chewy and barely toasted: gluten-heaven.The food is great, would definitely come back for brunch or dinner, but the service could be better.",4.0
"Had a great dinner at Stone Park. The restaurant is cozy and dim, nice and classy. The staff were helpfull and very nice. I had the gnocchi with oxtail half order to start. It was excellent. Wife just wanted a salad to start, so they made her a very nice garden salad. She had the hanger steak entree that came with spaetzle. The meat was tender as can be and the spaetzle with it is awesome! I had the steak special because our waitress told us how good it was. She was not kidding!!! It was a beautiful, big, tender, full of flavor ny strip. It was cooked perfectly and served with delicata squash and mushrooms. It was one of the best steaks i have ever had. The quality of the meat from tenderness to flavor was incredible. I have eaten alot of steaks and was shocked how great this one was. It was pricey at i think $42 but it was worth it. I love it when im introduced to something new and if you have never tried delicata squash its a must! Overall great experience at Stone Park and will def be back.",4.0

It seems the owners have left town with all their profits ( maybe enjoying a really good restaurant meal elsewhere in Bklyn !).they've left this place to the 20- something wait staff that seem more interested in dancing to the blazing hip hop music blaring in the restaurant to watching the football game on the TV screen. Yes..this place belongs in W' burg where patrons don't go for the good food or service. Hipsters go for  the loud ear- piercing music ( and even hipsters wouldn't be caught here either!).. Waiters were cackling at each other from.across the room.at the football game, treating diners like a bother ! And did I mention the loud blaring  hip hop music?! Terrible place. Yes folks the inmates have taken over the cafeteria. Save your $$ and your time. Go to any of dozens of other fine brunch places in our hood !

"Oh hell yes. This place is everything I could ask for in a neighborhood eatery and more.... seriously, I've eaten here twice now and come in for drinks once and its always perfect.Let's start at the beginning aka Sunday Brunch. Yes, it does take awhile to get a seat.... but it's worth the wait. The Bloody Mary is out of this world and the caper berry garnish is a nice touch. Plus, it gives you the most bang for your morning-cocktail-buck. The breakfast that we had was also beyond amazing. I ordered the shrimp and cheddar grits and could not stop talking about them. Seriously, I think that my boyfriend got annoyed with me after the 30th mention. Fellow Yelp-ers, the shrimp and grits are a must have. I would have licked my plate clean if it wouldn't have gotten some dirty looks. Brunch is not the only meal of the day on Sundays however (like you didn't know that) and last night I finally convinced boyfriend to try Stone Park for dinner. Yep, still awesome. The service was great. Our waiter was extremely helpful in terms of wine and meal selection without any of the attitude that you sometimes get when asking for suggestions. Bonus: his suggestions were right on the money. The bottle of wine we had was amazing (I don't remember what it was) and something we probably wouldn't have selected on our own based on the type. And the food --- oh my God - the food. First of all, if you don't like a punch of flavor in every bite of food, don't come here. If you DO like perfectly married, big flavors, run here. Both appetizers (seared tuna and swiss chard raviolini) were huge on unique flavors and both were delicious. I didn't want to stop eating mine.... and then the mains came. For my main I had the chicken based on the recommendation of our awesome waiter. Normally, I don't order chicken at restaurants because I feel like I can make it at home. Well, I couldn't have made this meal. The chicken was perfectly cooked --and I mean PERFECTLY cooked, I could tell that the tagliatelle was homemade, and the vegetables that accompanied it worked perfectly with the sauce. Again, if it was appropriate, I would have licked that plate clean. Finally, I have to touch on the atmosphere at dinner. It wasn't too loud and the background music was an unexpectedly pleasant and fresh playlist of The Weakerthans (one of my favorites) and Bob Dylan among others. Great. Bonus points go to the owner for being in on a Sunday night and stopping to chat with us for a moment or two. Stone Park, you're officially my favorite restaurant in Park Slope and possibly New York City. Thank you for being so unassumingly awesome.",5.0

"Best brunch in Park slope, by far. We love this place. its always crowded but the host works hard to get you sat as fast as possible. They will also take your phone number and call you so you can hang out at the farmers market or walk up 5th for a bit. The food is amazing and always fresh, we always love our meal. If you like eggs, go for the Short Rib hash, omg, its to die for. Also the Anson Mills Grit plate with shrimp is like nothing I have ever had before, its so tasty and creamy, a really great mash up of flavors. Always order a side of biscuit but be sure to request the raspberry jam and butter. They dont always offer that with the biscuit but is is so fresh and totally worth the calories.

I went here for brunch with my fiancee and it was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had. I had the french toast and was excited because the waiter enthusiastically suggested it to me. What came out tasted more like toast than it did bread. It was so below average that I didn't even eat the whole thing...gross.      My fiancee had the steak and eggs. The steak was decidedly NOT seared and tasted fairly bland. The potatoes that came with the meal were awful. How can you mess up potatoes? There was no crunch on the outside of the potatoes and the spice mix was sub par.     Maybe I caught Stone Park on a bad day since there are some quality reviews here but I for one won't be going back.,1.0
This place might be my all around favorite restaurant in the area. The menu is creative and thoughtful and everything from the appetizers to the desserts are always well prepared and presented. The service is top notch and I think there is something for everyone at this place. I'm someone who hates brunch crowds but I'll make the mile walk from my apartment to eat here because everything is so delicious. The prices are reasonable and I'm always surprised by that because it has such lovely decor and excellent dishes.,5.0
"We strolled in here and ordered the short rib hash with eggs and the steak and eggs. At first I thought the short rib hash was over cooked as evident by the blackened surface of the meat and potatoes, but it actually was very tasty. Looks are definitely deceiving. The raspberry jam on sourdough toast was pretty good, although I'd order the butter on the side next time. The steak and eggs was above average, definitely better than others I've tried. Seems like a simple dish, but so easy to mess up. Fresh squeezed OJ and timely service makes this place a solid brunch place if you're in the neighborhood.",4.0
"I love this place. The brunch is awesome! They have my favorite biscuits in the neighborhood. Dinner is wonderful as well. My only advice is to know that it's usually busy so if you can't get a reservation, be prepared to wait. Also, they have a really cute space for private parties. My fiancé and I had our engagement party there and it was great! A little on the pricey side but worth it for the constant stream of yummy food.",5.0

"I have only been once, for brunch, but I see the menu in my dreams. The portions are perfect--I'd rather have smaller portions of better food. Even though I choked just a little when I got the bill, the prices make a lot of sense for what you get. I'd heard many a story about the short rib hash. Sad news, it had ""sold out."" Good news? It was probably that good. I had their version of eggs benedict, and I don't see how I could have been any happier with what I had originally wanted. Another thing I like about this place is that it's not ""stuffy."" Even though the food is amazing, the waiters seem casual and friendly, caring, but not overly solicitous of your opinions of the food and all. I'm excited about trying dinner there. Soon. Very soon.",5.0
"So I decide to come here on a whimThe wait was pretty long for a party of two seeing as though the place isn't big at all but sooo cute!Opened up with the short rib sandwich appetizer O M G best thing I ever effing ate with a cream spinach and quale egg on it, STOP THE MADNESS!!!On to my entree I got the pork tenderloin so succulent soft and delish it was pork three waysPork cheek in two ravioliGlazed pork belly super soft and delicate and the pork tenderloin that was to die for it came with a pea/onion medley that was nice. I decided to just try the side of the ""new potato salad"" DEFINITE pass... So much vinegar it should be illegal, honestly a simple pull back wouldve made it good..

At first I thought the short rib hash was over cooked as evident by the blackened surface of the meat and potatoes, but it actually was very tasty. Looks are definitely deceiving. The raspberry jam on sourdough toast was pretty good, although I'd order the butter on the side next time. The steak and eggs was above average, definitely better than others I've tried. Seems like a simple dish, but so easy to mess up. Fresh squeezed OJ and timely service makes this place a solid brunch place if you're in the neighborhood.",4.0
"I love this place. The brunch is awesome! They have my favorite biscuits in the neighborhood. Dinner is wonderful as well. My only advice is to know that it's usually busy so if you can't get a reservation, be prepared to wait. Also, they have a really cute space for private parties. My fiancé and I had our engagement party there and it was great! A little on the pricey side but worth it for the constant stream of yummy food.",5.0

"I have only been once, for brunch, but I see the menu in my dreams. The portions are perfect--I'd rather have smaller portions of better food. Even though I choked just a little when I got the bill, the prices make a lot of sense for what you get. I'd heard many a story about the short rib hash. Sad news, it had ""sold out."" Good news? It was probably that good. I had their version of eggs benedict, and I don't see how I could have been any happier with what I had originally wanted. Another thing I like about this place is that it's not ""stuffy."" Even though the food is amazing, the waiters seem casual and friendly, caring, but not overly solicitous of your opinions of the food and all. I'm excited about trying dinner there. Soon. Very soon.",5.0
"So I decide to come here on a whimThe wait was pretty long for a party of two seeing as though the place isn't big at all but sooo cute!Opened up with the short rib sandwich appetizer O M G best thing I ever effing ate with a cream spinach and quale egg on it, STOP THE MADNESS!!!On to my entree I got the pork tenderloin so succulent soft and delish it was pork three waysPork cheek in two ravioliGlazed pork belly super soft and delicate and the pork tenderloin that was to die for it came with a pea/onion medley that was nice. I decided to just try the side of the ""new potato salad"" DEFINITE pass... So much vinegar it should be illegal, honestly a simple pull back wouldve made it good.. But I'll take my MAYO instead any day of the week. That's the only reason I gave them a four instead of a five.",4.0

"""What is a good lunch place in Brooklyn?"" I hear one of our Manhattan sales reps ask another who lives in the borough.  As the Brooklynite pondered the question, I quickly launched into my research routine.  Since I would also be attending the client lunch, I rushed to find my wish list and started sending her links in a rapid fire procession.  She burst out laughing about how neurotic, yet typical for me, this was.  When she came across my suggestion for Stone Park Cafe, she was impressed.  She loved the promise of clean, market-fresh ingredients just as much as I did.  We quizzed our Brooklyn-based colleague about the spot, and he responded that he and his wife had enjoyed one of their favorite meals there.  Done!  We were sold.  Apparently, my research trigger finger had located a top-notch option before Mr. B Borough had the chance.  Score one point for the New Jerseyian...Ohhh yeah!The day soon arrived, and the sales manager and I engaged in a pleasant midday road-trip out of the hectic city.  We easily navigated to the cafe, which was located on bustling 5th Avenue in Park Slope.  Though we had been warned about parking difficulties in the area, we were immediately able to snag a spot right in front.  We headed into the almost deserted restaurant and found it quite charming.  It had the homey, down-to-earth feeling you would expect from a restaurant with such a straight-forward cooking style.  The busboy offered us the option to either sit at one of the few front tables neighboring the bar or to grab a spot in the back dining area.   We decided to sit in the forefront with its sunny atmosphere and view of the main street.   Our youthful waiter approached and inquired about our beverage preferences, sweetly referring to my co-worker as ""Dear"".  He walked away and left us puzzlingly staring at each other.  ""Did he just call me 'Dear'?!"" she asked, clearly taken aback.  We laughed at the ridiculous, and mildly condescending, salutation.   Lunch was off to a humorous beginning.  Our clients arrived, which triggered the waiter's immediate attempt to have us order.  We shooed him away with a plea for an extra minute to review the menus.  We decided to start by sharing the Frisee and Arugula Salads, following those with our own courses.  The Frisee Salad was tossed with shiitake mushrooms and crispy bacon bits.  A fried poached egg patty lay atop the mound of greens, resembling a ball of breaded goat cheese, but containing a hidden golden center. The smokey, salty bacon enriched and added depth to the other earthy ingredients.  Cooked cranberry beans and marinaded artichoke hunks hid beneath the other salad of fresh arugula.  The flavors were perfect for the seasonal transition into fall.  A dusting of Parmigiano Reggiano added an elegant sweetness.  Both starters exemplified the restaurant's theory of cooking.  Again, the staff checked in several times, trying to remove our plates before we were finished.  We finally conceded our remaining scraps and made room for our entrees.  For all of their effort, my colleague was still delivered the wrong sandwich.  Regardless, she enjoyed her side of Summer Corn Soup, topped with a spicy wasabi crème fraiche and bold chives.  She also loved her Oyster Po' Boy, which looked like a delicious mess of fried shellfish, celery root remoulade, and bibb lettuce on a crispy roll.  Our clients also enjoyed their gourmet BLT's, which included braised pork belly, vine tomatoes, bibb lettuce, and roasted garlic aioli on toasted artisan bread.  I decided to sample another starter instead of a main plate and was happy with the portion size.  My Octopus Salad was essentially a long, coiled octopus tentacle that had its arm around chopped greens, cherry tomatoes, and sourdough croutons.  A preserved lemon black pepper vinaigrette added a slight, subtle kick.  The octopus was just tender enough to be perfectly sliced, however, it was rather dry...and looked it as well.  Our side of delicious, crisp French fries was accompanied by a tangy chipotle mayo dipping sauce.  It was quite the feast of market ingredients.We turned down the option to continue the meal and requested the check.  Suddenly, the staff decided now was the time to take a break and chit-chat.  We had to literally walk over to the gaggle of young men and place a second request for the bill.  A neighboring table also had to approach the waiter to put in a request for bread.  We finally settled our bill and headed out into the beautiful afternoon.Stone Park Cafe was an adorable addition to the Park Slope culinary scene.  The food was light, yet flavorful.  The service was the main downer, but not enough to ruin the thought of a repeat visit, though I would opt for the more elaborate dinner options instead next time.",4.0
"Terrific brunch spot. You should expect a minimum 15 - 20 minute wait on a Sunday afternoon, but the food is worth it.

"I really wanted to ""fall in love"" with this place.  Really I did.  The decor is warm and inviting and the servers are just as warm and friendly.  BF and I waited 2 times longer than the hostess said we had to wait when we first walked in (Sunday before New Year's Eve) and now I'm really wishing that we would have just moved on our way after waiting half the time we waited.  Ugh!  Would have had a better and less expensive meal at Song a block away.  Ugh!  But I'm not saying anything new when I tell you that you WILL spend here!  At 3 stars, the meal wasn't ALL bad.  I did have a really tasty butternut squash soup (but not worth the $12 they charge for it).  The sourdough bread they serve is good... but they need to serve a larger portion of butter with it.  For the entree, we opted for the Steak for 2 with 2 sides (mashed potatoes and spinach).  We asked for the steak to be cooked at a medium but it was served more like a medium rare.  Many pieces were actually rare and we couldn't eat them at all.  The cut of the steak (can't remember what it was) was tender but NOT specially flavored.  Just ok.  The mashed potatoes were a serving for 1 NOT for 2 as well as the spinach.  I wouldn't come here very hungry if I were you.  All of the food btw (with the exception of the soup) was served warm/room temp.  Not hot as it should be.  That was the MOST disturbing for me.  BIG Ugh!!!  BF had the Chocolate Brioche Pudding with caramel ice cream for dessert - good!  I had the Apple Turnover with buttermilk ice cream - eh!  Thank goodness he's a big believer in, ""sharing is caring"".  Highlight of the evening is having Steve Buscemi, aka Mr. Pink, eat 2 tables away from us.  With so many other great places still left to explore in Brooklyn, can't say that we'll be back!",3.0

Also, the noise level was deafening, made worse by high-energy background music and loud crashes of crockery from the kitchen.  My wife and I had to shout across the small table.With the slam bam thank you ma'am cooking, the incredible racket and the pretty high prices, we probably won't be going back.",3.0
Went to brunch on Sunday...snagged a seat at the bar after a short wait. We had the short ribs hash and the biscuits and gravy. Everything was delicious! The eggs were perfectly cooked. The coffee was good. The bloody mary was generous and tasty. Everyone who worked there was lovely and attentive.The only negative and I have to point it out....is that they played THE ENTIRE MADONNA anthology.  I don't mind a little Madonna...but we arrived to Madonna....ate to Madonna...left to Madonna. I would definitely suggest mixing it up! Other than that a sweet Sunday brunch! Especially since it was one that involved biscuits and gravy...something I've been craving for some time!,4.0
"I found this place a couple weeks ago when a visiting friend and I decided to do brunch after waking up a bit hungover and unwilling to venture into Manhattan. We ordered Bloody Mary's and they were strong! (I could possibly have been still intoxicated, but this is still open to debate.) The waiter set them down and went, ""BOOM."" Best. Boom. Ever. We both ordered something Benedict-y and it was fabulous. The serving size was perfect, and exactly what my hangover needed; I wasn't left stuffed. I think the major reason I liked it so much, however, was the friendliness of the staff. Even the busboys were friendly and chatty, rather than solemn, as I'm used to seeing. They opened the outdoor seating for us, at our request, and they did it happily. I know that having ONE table on the patio is annoying as hell for a server, but they were super nice about it. I'd definitely try another meal here, but if you're looking for a brunch spot, it's definitely worth a visit!",5.0

"We were walking down 5th Ave looking for a quick bite for lunch.  As we walked by, we saw the couple sitting at a table in the front window eating a hamburger.  I don't know what it was about seeing the half eaten burger, but it drew us in.We ordered a burger with pepper jack and a BLT, both come with fries, salad or cup of soup.  The burger is a nice 8 oz burger and pretty filling.  I asked for it medium rare and it came out closer to medium-done, but it was still pretty good.  The BLT is not your typical BLT.  First it comes open face.  Second, the bacon is thick cut slabs of pork belly that are fried crisp.  The draft beer selection is a bit eclectic but good.  The bartender was a little aggressive in the pour and the head of foam flowed over the glass on to the table.  Not a big deal, but it made a bit of a mess on the table.",4.0
"My friend and I went in for brunch on a Sunday. The nice part about this place is that while you are waiting for your table you can go do whatever. When your table is ready, the host can call you cell phone to let you know. How cool is that?Once we got our table things went downhill. First of all, they sat us directly in front of the doorway. Every single person that entered bumped into me and my friend. Even worse was the fact that they encouraged people to wait for their table inside, all the while hovering over our table. I had an omelet and the whole thing was very bland. The eggs were underdone, the sausage was tasteless, and the cheese was overpowering. It also came with seasoned potatoes (hash browns) which were also fairly plain. Lastly, there was some toast which was pre-buttered. Convenient? I guess...The waiter came to our table a total of 3 times: drink orders, food orders, and to drop off the check. Don't expect coffee or water refills. Don't expect condiments. What can you expect? How about being rushed out of the place EVEN after being seated in literally the worst table possible.Overall, I'm not impressed. For 13 bucks before tax and tip, I was expecting a really well made omelet, but this just reminded me of cafeteria food. Too harsh? Nope.",2.0

"I went here for brunch with a friend.  We had to wait a while, but they were nice enough to call us next door at the bar when our table was ready.  The menu had a nice variety of egg dishes and sandwiches.  I decided to go with the shrimp and grits, always one of my favorites.  This was very delicious, the right amount of cheese and the shrimp was perfectly cooked.  My only complaint is that the portion was very small.  It was more like an appetizer than a main course, and in fact, it was so small that I had to get fries at the bar around the corner after I left.  Other than that, I enjoyed it.",4.0
"I went to Stone Park Cafe for dinner, not brunch, which is what everybody raves about. The food was delicious, and the ambiance very quaint and cozy. The portions were not that large, and the prices a bit steep. Luckily for us we were a bunch of girls, had my boyfriend come this place hungry, I defiantly think he would have left quite hungry. Overall, a great experience, although I doubt I'll be back, for dinner anyway!",4.0
"Looks nice, but the food (my one meal here, anyway), not so good.  Pork belly BLT is a little gross - lots of uncooked fat, plus too-crunchy edges.  Aoili was too much on top of all the grease in the pork belly, and the tomatoes were so ripe they made the sandwich soggy.  Fries were undercooked.  Service is a bit inattentive.  It did not give me a real reason to give it a second try.",3.0
"I've only been here for brunch, and it is totally fab. Everything that my friends and I have ever ordered has been nothing less than awesomely delicious. The coffee is also very good, and my cup is always kept full (this is very important to me).The staff is super friendly, and I've never had a wait (but I do tend to go earlier than the average human). I really like the generally feel and look of the restaurant. It's very aesthetically  pleasing and comfortable place, and when it's warm out, they open the doors and put tables outside. As opposed to a lot of other places (esp on 5th Ave), you look out onto a park, not the main drag.",5.0
Great brunch spot!  The burger is one of the better burgers I've ever had. The bartendress makes a helluva peach bellini too.,4.0
"We were walking down 5th Ave looking for a quick bite for lunch.  As we walked by, we saw the couple sitting at a table in the front window eating a hamburger.  I don't know what it was about seeing the half eaten burger, but it drew us in.We ordered a burger with pepper jack and a BLT, both come with fries, salad or cup of soup.  The burger is a nice 8 oz burger and pretty filling.  I asked for it medium rare and it came out closer to medium-done, but it was still pretty good.  The BLT is not your typical BLT.  First it comes open face.  Second, the bacon is thick cut slabs of pork belly that are fried crisp.  The draft beer selection is a bit eclectic but good.  The bartender was a little aggressive in the pour and the head of foam flowed over the glass on to the table.  Not a big deal, but it made a bit of a mess on the table.",4.0
"My friend and I went in for brunch on a Sunday. The nice part about this place is that while you are waiting for your table you can go do whatever. When your table is ready, the host can call you cell phone to let you know. How cool is that?Once we got our table things went downhill. First of all, they sat us directly in front of the doorway. Every single person that entered bumped into me and my friend. Even worse was the fact that they encouraged people to wait for their table inside, all the while hovering over our table. I had an omelet and the whole thing was very bland. The eggs were underdone, the sausage was tasteless, and the cheese was overpowering. It also came with seasoned potatoes (hash browns) which were also fairly plain. Lastly, there was some toast which was pre-buttered. Convenient? I guess...The waiter came to our table a total of 3 times: drink orders, food orders, and to drop off the check. Don't expect coffee or water refills. Don't expect condiments. What can you expect? How about being rushed out of the place EVEN after being seated in literally the worst table possible.Overall, I'm not impressed. For 13 bucks before tax and tip, I was expecting a really well made omelet, but this just reminded me of cafeteria food. Too harsh? Nope.",2.0
"This quaint place is right down the street from my apartment in the charming Park Slope area by the historic ""Old Stone House.""  I won't be able to go very often as it is pretty expensive, but as a once-in-a-while treat it is fantastic.  Every bite of the food is a revelation.  Had the special Asparagus Risotto for an appetizer.  One of the best things I've ever eaten.  Tried my parents' salad (Frisee Salad: shiitake mushrooms, bacon, Yukon Gold potato, crispy poached egg $l2) and it was also astoundingly good.  The kind of good where you tell the waitress five times how much you like it.  Such an intriguing combination of tastes.  We all had pastas for entrees- the Tagliatelle and Raviolini were especially flavorful.  Sit at the bar with the lovely Meghan for a great dining experience!",5.0
"We went here for a brunch on a Sunday afternoon (around 2 PM) and were told the wait was 15-20 min, we kinda expected worse as it looked busy inside with people waiting near the entrance. The host got my number and promised to call when the table was available, about 20 mins later he called and we were seated, not bad at all. I ordered the 'Short Rib Hash with Poached Eggs and Toasted Sourdough Bread' and E ordered 'Eggs Benedict with Canadian Bacon', the food arrived about 7-10 Mins later, not bad again. Poached Eggs were nothing but perfection, soft, creamy and still warm. The short rib hash was delicious, mixed well with potatoes, which offered a salty and savory aspect to the dish, though I wish the hash was served a little warmer, as by the time I got through half my dish, the hash was already cold. E said the Eggs Benedict was pretty good, though she could have done without the Canadian Bacon.All in all, a good experience.",4.0
"My husband and I took his colleague and wife to dinner at Stone Park.  They were unfamiliar with Brooklyn and Park Slope, and super-impressed with their meal.  We had the front table, very comfortable for a foursome.  We were there for dinner on a weeknight, and it wasn't crowded.  The shaved brussels sprout salad is luscious, and I always love their frisee salad.  We each had different entrees, and everyone was happy.  I didn't love my wine (purchased by the glass), but otherwise a wonderful meal.",5.0
"Stone Park being a fancy place and all, we decided to stop in for brunch.  It was quite frenzied, but because it was raining, we were able to find a seat  outside under a large awning.  The hostess warned us that she couldn't move us inside if we decided we didn't want to sit out there, but it was perfectly dry.  So we got a table immediately instead of waiting for forty-five minutes, which was nice.  I had the cheese grits, which are mixed with scallions and topped by a poached egg.  The cheese had a fine crust on the top and the flavor was almost perfect.  The only thing that kept them from being the best cheese grits I've had in the city is that they had a very slight metallic tang.  It may be the iron ramekin they were served in.  Maybe they should go with ceramic.   Also, I would've liked at least a piece of toast on the side.  It's a pretty small dish.  The hubs had the rib meat hash, or whatever it's called.  I stole one of his pieces of toast, which was really tasty and buttery.  The food was definitely good, and because of the rain and the death metal band playing at the street fair on the corner, we were left to our leisure.  However, I wouldn't wait around in the rain to eat here again.",3.0

"The food here is reliably tasty and interesting, for both brunch and dinner.

The dinner menu is seasonal so it's hard to recommend specific items, but suffice it to say that everything I've had is delicious. They also have a market menu, 3 courses for $30, which is a pretty good deal. However, as we all know, food isn't everything. Service matters, and unfortunately I have to say the service here is spotty. Last time I was here, my server didn't give us milk or sugar for our coffee, or butter or jam for our toast, or refill our water at all - we had to request each of these things individually. This is especially unfortunate because in other respects (food and ambiance) this place lends itself well to special-occasion dinners or date nights, but the last thing you want to do in such situations is spend the whole time leaning out into the aisle to get the waiter's eye.

"I was in New York for the weekend and this was one of the last meals I had.

"Slapping this place with 3 stars:Bartender gave me great service as I enjoyed my Pan Seared Bluefish Cake (14) and espresso...BUT, I never should have had to sit at the bar in the first place, as my party was waiting for me in the back of the restaurant.The skinny: After an hour-long train ride, I arrived late and sans cellie to meet two friends for brunch, and immediately inquired of the host if there were two ladies of a certain description waiting for someone. He assured me there were not, even going so far as to say ""I have no incomplete parties.""So I waited a while and then ate at the bar. After I finished, I followed a hunch and strolled through the back dining room, and BAM! There were J & D.They had arrived on time and were seated at a four-top.

"There's a dichotomy with patrons of Stone Park: those who expect too much and those who complain about inconsistency.I would be one of the former. It's a charming place, very nice if you want to avoid the stroller army at night time. Granted it's inevitable you'll run into a few getting here, but once inside you'll actually feel like you're in Park Slope without the babies. Unless of course you get sat next to families with crayons and high chairs. Okay, okay. At least the strollers don't show up inside.They have delicious aperitifs and cocktails; purists will find themselves happy with perfect Negronis and solid Gibsons. The wine list has a nice selection as well; domestic wines play rather carefully with familiar European vintages.The food is good, yet, as stated, inconsistent; I don't have such a big qualm about it at this place because they know what they're doing most nights. I've had one off night of food but for however many times I've been here that seems to be more and more an exception. It's good, it's well done, and it's quality. It's also apparently seasonal, but I'll be the judge of that when I actually see the menu change. For what it's worth I'm happy with what they offer.Plus points for being able to reserve on OpenTable. Minus points for the service being a bit more inconsistent than the food.

The Scottish Salmon was fantastic as well, I was impressed by the baby bok choy and citrus salsa combination, very unique and awesome flavors.I stole a bite of Speedy's chicken, and a taste of Mel's scallops, and let the good times roll. The desserts looked amazing, but we stuck with the cassis and coconut sorbets, both of which were heavenly (especially paired with a fresh espresso, twist of lemon rind a must-have touch).I will be back here many many many times.

"I was really excited about the brunch menu, and the food was pretty good, if not a bit homogenous. (I had biscuits and gravy, which was a plate of exactly that...no fruit or greens, no potatoes, just a bunch of b&g with eggs on top; my friend had the short rib hash, which was also basically a pile of all the same pretty good tasting food - though he got plain toast, too.) In any case, I'm compelled to write a review because the service was so odd and disappointing. When we were seated by the bartender, the restaurant was mostly empty and she told us that a waitress would be over soon. After about 10 minutes, no one had approached us, though an entire other party had come in, been seated, served drinks, and ordered food. We signaled to the bartender who was near us (made sense based on the location of the table and the fact she'd seated us) and asked if we could order. She seemed super annoyed and repeated that a waitress would come over. After another 5 minutes, the bartender finally came herself and poured water, seeming shocked that no one had helped us yet -- and then took our food orders very briskly. She commented that she had no idea no one had come over yet. (Literally only 3 other tables were filled anywhere near her and 2 people were eating at the bar. It was pretty obvious that there'd been no service. Also, why else would we have asked?!) While we were waiting for food, a different waitress came over and tried to take our orders, and seemed annoyed when we told her we'd already ordered. Food came; it was pretty good. No one checked in the whole time, nor refilled the glasses. Once we'd finished eating, a dude came to take the plates and refill water. We continued to sit for awhile, and finally started looking pointedly at the bartender again since we hadn't seen a waitress to get the check. We both felt like the bartender was trying actively to ignore us. Finally, we caught her eye, and asked if we could get the check, and she said with a fair bit of irritation that our waitress would bring it and turned her back. We continued to wait. The waitress who'd tried belatedly to take our orders (ours?) approached the bar at one point and t spoke with the bartender. Still no check. Finally, an entirely different person came over with the check, which she just basically dropped and walked away. We were totally confused by the experience. No one ever apologized or seemed to notice that we never had a server, and the bartender's rudeness when we asked for assistance was uncalled for. Although the food was alright, the service left us cold.",2.0
"Fatty fantastic brunch in the Slope....the waiters serve up bloody maria's (bloody mary's with tequila instead of vodka), the kitchen serves up pork with a side of bacon, and best of all, there's room for strollers if you sit outside, which most brunch places around can't say. Hello Saturday!",4.0
"I came here for dinner the other night, and it was pretty fab.  I had the miso glazed pork belly to start which was really delicious, smokey, sweet, perfectly cooked, and the cabbage served with it was a nice foil to the fatty pork.  Then I had the whole grilled branzino - grilled to perfection with just some lemon and aromatics, the fish was flavorful and sweet with some excellent charring on the outside.  THEN came the meyer lemon pudding cake which was perfect.  After a heavy meal, a sweet and tart dessert was just what I wanted.  The texture was amazing, gelatinous and pudding-like on top, getting progressively more cake-like as you go down.  It was like eating a particularly delicious lemony cloud, it was so good!",4.0
"My entire brunch experience here was lackluster. It took forever for the waiter to bring my coffee, and it was never refilled. My blood mary was okay, but nothing to write home about.

"Yum. Finally got over here and had a delicious lunch. Silky butternut squash soup and a delicious sandwich (the aioli! the crusty bread! the amazing smoky-but-not-salty bacon!) was actually reasonably priced.

"Came her for brunch with my husband and we were seated almost immediately around 11:30.  The decor of this place is absolutely adorable.  With yellow painted walls and exposed brick, the place makes you feel all happy and gooey inside.  The service was top notch and the food came out very fast.  As for the actual flavor, what impressed me was the wide variety of choices on the menu and also how perfectly seasoned everything was.  I am somewhat picky when it comes to food so I tend to notice if something is slightly cold or under-seasoned or sub-par in any way shape or form.  The food here was absolutely perfect!  I got the biscuits and gravy with eggs over-easy and everything on that plate was top notch.",5.0
"I have to remember to go back to this place, the menu looks delicious and we had a great experience here.

"Located a stones throw from my friends apartment, it somehow took us over an hour to decide to eat here. What can I say? We wanted a filet mignon and apparently that is an unheard of dish in the Park Slope area. ""It's probably a seasonal item,"" our waiter kindly informed us after I had expressed my distraught of walking all the way down 5th AND 7th avenues to no avail.  It seemed to be a ""Hangar Steak friendly"" neighborhood.So, Thursday night we walked right in and were seated right away on the patio overlooking the park. After the hunt for the red (medium) mignon, we had worked up quite the appetite. We were greeted with bread promptly... as well as a cute waiter.  I can't resist mentioning that this is an establishment that gives you the bread, but no bread plate or app plate.. why this bothers me? I can't explain. It's a crum(b)y deal (apologies for no lame pun disclaimer). As I mentioned we were starving, so we ordered our food when we placed our drink orders.

"I had brunch here a couple years ago, and really enjoyed it. I also recently tried dinner, and also liked it.

The fish cakes were well seasoned and tasty.My friend had waffles, which she said were great. When I had dinner, I opted for 2 appetizers for my meal. I had the braised octopus salad, which was refreshing and light. I also had the special barley risotto, which had some veggies and rock shrimp in it. Also nice and light, very tasty. My friend had the fried oysters with corn risotto, and the short rib sandwich, both of which were very good as well. We shared a cheese plate for dessert, which were paired with sliced apples, date cake, and quince paste. I had a port and she had a brandy, and we both went home very happy.

"I was really excited about the brunch menu, and the food was pretty good, if not a bit homogenous. (I had biscuits and gravy, which was a plate of exactly that...no fruit or greens, no potatoes, just a bunch of b&g with eggs on top; my friend had the short rib hash, which was also basically a pile of all the same pretty good tasting food - though he got plain toast, too.) In any case, I'm compelled to write a review because the service was so odd and disappointing. When we were seated by the bartender, the restaurant was mostly empty and she told us that a waitress would be over soon. After about 10 minutes, no one had approached us, though an entire other party had come in, been seated, served drinks, and ordered food. We signaled to the bartender who was near us (made sense based on the location of the table and the fact she'd seated us) and asked if we could order. She seemed super annoyed and repeated that a waitress would come over. After another 5 minutes, the bartender finally came herself and poured water, seeming shocked that no one had helped us yet -- and then took our food orders very briskly. She commented that she had no idea no one had come over yet. (Literally only 3 other tables were filled anywhere near her and 2 people were eating at the bar. It was pretty obvious that there'd been no service. Also, why else would we have asked?!) While we were waiting for food, a different waitress came over and tried to take our orders, and seemed annoyed when we told her we'd already ordered. Food came; it was pretty good. No one checked in the whole time, nor refilled the glasses. Once we'd finished eating, a dude came to take the plates and refill water. We continued to sit for awhile, and finally started looking pointedly at the bartender again since we hadn't seen a waitress to get the check. We both felt like the bartender was trying actively to ignore us. Finally, we caught her eye, and asked if we could get the check, and she said with a fair bit of irritation that our waitress would bring it and turned her back. We continued to wait. The waitress who'd tried belatedly to take our orders (ours?) approached the bar at one point and t spoke with the bartender. Still no check. Finally, an entirely different person came over with the check, which she just basically dropped and walked away. We were totally confused by the experience. No one ever apologized or seemed to notice that we never had a server, and the bartender's rudeness when we asked for assistance was uncalled for. Although the food was alright, the service left us cold.",2.0
"Fatty fantastic brunch in the Slope....the waiters serve up bloody maria's (bloody mary's with tequila instead of vodka), the kitchen serves up pork with a side of bacon, and best of all, there's room for strollers if you sit outside, which most brunch places around can't say. Hello Saturday!",4.0
"I came here for dinner the other night, and it was pretty fab.  I had the miso glazed pork belly to start which was really delicious, smokey, sweet, perfectly cooked, and the cabbage served with it was a nice foil to the fatty pork.  Then I had the whole grilled branzino - grilled to perfection with just some lemon and aromatics, the fish was flavorful and sweet with some excellent charring on the outside.  THEN came the meyer lemon pudding cake which was perfect.  After a heavy meal, a sweet and tart dessert was just what I wanted.  The texture was amazing, gelatinous and pudding-like on top, getting progressively more cake-like as you go down.  It was like eating a particularly delicious lemony cloud, it was so good!",4.0
"My entire brunch experience here was lackluster. It took forever for the waiter to bring my coffee, and it was never refilled. My blood mary was okay, but nothing to write home about. The short rib hash was kind of dry and disappointing. Topped off with two slightly overcooked poached eggs, with a side of plain wheat toast. Meh.",2.0
"We came here for brunch, the wait was about half an hour, so I guess that's acceptable considering how good the reviews were for ths place.  The food was above-average, and the presentation was quite nice.  Waitress was pretty good and helpful.  So I would definitely recommend this place to someone who's in the area and looking for a place for brunch.",4.0
"Yum. Finally got over here and had a delicious lunch. Silky butternut squash soup and a delicious sandwich (the aioli! the crusty bread! the amazing smoky-but-not-salty bacon!) was actually reasonably priced.

"Came her for brunch with my husband and we were seated almost immediately around 11:30.  The decor of this place is absolutely adorable.  With yellow painted walls and exposed brick, the place makes you feel all happy and gooey inside.  The service was top notch and the food came out very fast.  As for the actual flavor, what impressed me was the wide variety of choices on the menu and also how perfectly seasoned everything was.  I am somewhat picky when it comes to food so I tend to notice if something is slightly cold or under-seasoned or sub-par in any way shape or form.  The food here was absolutely perfect!  I got the biscuits and gravy with eggs over-easy and everything on that plate was top notch.",5.0
"I have to remember to go back to this place, the menu looks delicious and we had a great experience here. However, I can only review the hamburgers, because our first visit was after a night of heavy drinking!  Both my husband and I craved the burger, which was delicious, but felt bad that we didn't try anything else.",3.0
"Located a stones throw from my friends apartment, it somehow took us over an hour to decide to eat here. What can I say? We wanted a filet mignon and apparently that is an unheard of dish in the Park Slope area. ""It's probably a seasonal item,"" our waiter kindly informed us after I had expressed my distraught of walking all the way down 5th AND 7th avenues to no avail.  It seemed to be a ""Hangar Steak friendly"" neighborhood.So, Thursday night we walked right in and were seated right away on the patio overlooking the park. After the hunt for the red (medium) mignon, we had worked up quite the appetite. We were greeted with bread promptly... as well as a cute waiter.  I can't resist mentioning that this is an establishment that gives you the bread, but no bread plate or app plate.. why this bothers me? I can't explain. It's a crum(b)y deal (apologies for no lame pun disclaimer). As I mentioned we were starving, so we ordered our food when we placed our drink orders. My cohort ordered the pomegranate martini and I a glass of merlot. We're pretty sure she received a passion fruit martini as it was a citrus pink color rather than a deeper red. It still was delicious so she didn't complain.We both ordered the mixed green salad with the goat cheese as they were out of the spinach salad.  I was impressed with the size of the salad and the little fried goat cheese balls made my world go round (ahh, the simple things in life).

However, as easygoing diners, we sat down and ordered one of our options. They were all AMAZING. I had the hanger steak with grilled romaine and onion rings. First, this is the first place other than a restaurant that I worked at in Michigan has had grilled romaine. It is SO. GOOD. It looks a little weird--1/2 head of romaine, whole, and somewhat charred, drizzled with dressing--but it is amazing. The onion rings were also awesome; not overly fried, but crispy and delicious. And the steak....I'm not a big meat eater, but it was one of the only options and I'm so glad I ordered it. It was perfectly done (I ordered it medium), and extremely tasty. Another person I was with ordered the same thing, and the other ordered the salmon. When we left, there wasn't one morsel of food left on any of our plates--it was that good.

"My friend and I came here for brunch because I have been dying for some seriously good biscuits and gravy and the reviews I had read for this restaurant were encouraging.  Upon entering, what was most striking was the contrast between the rustic feel of the restaurant design and table layout compared to the assorted musical artists on the sound system, including the Beastie Boys among others.Let it be known that they serve some serious coffee, maybe not the best I've ever had but certainly no average brew.  The biscuits and gravy should be renamed biscuit and gravy, because it's really a single not-that-large buttermilk biscuit smothered in white gravy with large chunks of sausage.  Overall, the biscuit was a little on the drier side and not piping hot which was disappointing, and I had to add salt and pepper to season the gravy properly; the braised greens that came along happened to be braised with bacon, making it slightly sour and smoky and overall a good compliment to the dish.  The bluefin cakes that my friend ordered were very good, offering a solid crunch of texture and a good amount of fish inside, but were a little on the smaller side.  The sourdough french toast, aka dessert, was like no french toast I had ever had before, a strange combination of refreshing airiness in the middle (as opposed to dense custard) sandwiched by the crispy-good texture that I come to expect.Service was friendly and timely and seemed to enjoy being there, which was a plus.  There is also apparently some new designated area for parking for the restaurant which I didn't know about before feeding the meter. Overall, I'd come back again but maybe request an extra biscuit next time...",4.0

"My friend and I came here for brunch because I have been dying for some seriously good biscuits and gravy and the reviews I had read for this restaurant were encouraging.  Upon entering, what was most striking was the contrast between the rustic feel of the restaurant design and table layout compared to the assorted musical artists on the sound system, including the Beastie Boys among others.Let it be known that they serve some serious coffee, maybe not the best I've ever had but certainly no average brew.  The biscuits and gravy should be renamed biscuit and gravy, because it's really a single not-that-large buttermilk biscuit smothered in white gravy with large chunks of sausage.  Overall, the biscuit was a little on the drier side and not piping hot which was disappointing, and I had to add salt and pepper to season the gravy properly; the braised greens that came along happened to be braised with bacon, making it slightly sour and smoky and overall a good compliment to the dish.  The bluefin cakes that my friend ordered were very good, offering a solid crunch of texture and a good amount of fish inside, but were a little on the smaller side.  The sourdough french toast, aka dessert, was like no french toast I had ever had before, a strange combination of refreshing airiness in the middle (as opposed to dense custard) sandwiched by the crispy-good texture that I come to expect.Service was friendly and timely and seemed to enjoy being there, which was a plus.  There is also apparently some new designated area for parking for the restaurant which I didn't know about before feeding the meter. Overall, I'd come back again but maybe request an extra biscuit next time...",4.0
"Went twice this week. The drinks were delicious, the wine list expansive, and the food was just mainstream enough to make everyone happy and just interesting enough to make you feel like you ate something new. Everything was fresh and tasty. Service is excellent.",5.0
"a group of us hit this for a farewell brunch for a friend that was moving outta brooklyn.  3 out of 5 of us had been, but i was one that hadn't had the fortune of dining there.  i was the first to arrive.  note: they do not seat you until your entire party is present.  we got there a little after noon and didn't have a problem getting a table once we all arrived.  my friends had raved about the biscuits and gravy, so i had to get them.  i was not disappointed.  i also got the greens for an extra $1.  they were tangy, vinegary collared greens with bacon on top.  they had me at bacon.  i was thoroughly satisfied.  also, the servers are super friendly.  while my friends waited the bartender was happy to make a drink off the menu as long as he had the liquors to do so.  that's what i call go above the call of duty.",4.0
"Went here for a Sunday Brunch, nice environment, got to sit outside, no wait ( got there a little after noon)I ordered the biscuits with Gravy, pretty good, the gravy was very rich and thick mixed with sausage. The boyfriend ordered his usual, steak and egg, he was happy with itThe service was great! on the downside, mimosa are like 9 bucks??",4.0
"This place is a brunch favorite. I think I've only had dinner there twice, but the brunch is out of this world. They have a dish called the Hangtown Fry... I enjoyed it so much, I thought I was going to pass out... And the short rib hash... scrumtrulescent!",5.0
"My friends who live in Park Slope took me to Stone Park Cafe last night (I am visiting from Florida).

"First, a warning:  Double-check your holiday reservations.  Our Thanksgiving reservation disappeared and we arrived at 6:30 p.m. to find a packed restaurant, a busy staff, and the prospect of a hungry and unpleasant walk back home.  The manager seemed skeptical that we had made the reservations in the first place.At first we were told there was no space.  Then we were offered seats at the bar.  Finally, we were squeezed in to table next to the bar.  I was more than annoyed.  A pleasant day and a long-anticipated (and definitely reserved) dinner had turned into an anxious event.However, the entire staff stepped up to win the day.  The food, as usual, was outstanding. The waitress was cheerful and witty.  The service was impeccable, with our water glasses refilled at the slightest sign of need.  Every staff member, no matter how busy they were, teamed up to turn a disappointment into a pleasant experience.Many thanks to the staff, and what a relief.  We just started coming to Stone Park last year.  Because of its wonderful food and beverages and commitment to quality it is now the place we take business contacts and family visitors.  Now that we have survived our first ""bump"" with the restaurant, we are even more inclined to recommend it for both personal and professional events.",5.0

"I went here for brunch this past weekend with my boyfriend and parents, and had an absolutely fantastic meal! The boyfriend and I went for the short rib hash, which we'd been dreaming about since spotting it on an online menu awhile ago, and it absolutely lived up to our expectations. I got mine with poached eggs, which were delicious, and subbed toast out for their homemade English Muffin, which was also fantastic. My dad got the chef's omelette, which he enjoyed, and my mom went for the absolutely wonderful grits with shrimp, which I am already contemplating ordering when I eventually return! The one gripe we had was that our service was a little slow, particularly since my parents were raring to get back on the road to Massachusetts.

"Stone Park Cafe has a very special place in my heart and it kills me to write this review but it just had to be said. I first went to Stone Park for brunch about 2 years ago after coming to brooklyn for the first time the night before and inevitably crashing at my friends apartment. We had such a fun night and the brunch was SO delicious and we just had such a great vibe. Ah but then it was back to NJ where I was living at the time and we often reminisced about the brunch at Stone Park. When we moved to Brooklyn we were so excited to be close enough to walk to stone park for lazy weekend brunches. Unfortunately the good vibes have faded, the past 3 or 4 times we have been back have just gotten worse and worse and this last time just completely ruined it.*one thing I did REALLY like was that you could give them your cell # when you were on the wait list and they would call you when your table was ready!The service was terrible, we sat at the table for 10 mins before we even got menus, our server was so not interested in us at all, never asked if we wanted cofffee, mimosas, bloody marys-nothing, water glasses were always empty even as he walked by several times, my husband asked for a biscuit on the side as listed on the ""side items"" on the menu and our server informed us they were ""out""-but not out of biscuits just sides of them! what??? Asked for ketchup when our meals arrived and after waiting 10 mins and unable to get  his attention went to the bartender to get it.

"I absolutely love having ""Brunch"" here on either Saturday or Sunday.  Park SLope is one of my favorite parts of Brooklyn and each time that I have feasted here it has been a gastro success.  The atmosphere is classic, not too trendy but merely sophificated.  One of the owners is always out in the front, either hosting, serving food/water and just making sure everyone is doing great.  They have a cute bar area and a good amount of seating for small parties of two to larger groups of six.  Now for the best part...the FOOD.  Ok so I have sampled here and there and each time I have been impressed with the quality.  My favorite by far is the Omelette...they make the perfect omelette...not overcooked, ingredients that are so fresh, married together perfectly.  You get to choose four from cheddar, tomatoes (which are stewed), smoked bacon, ham, bluecheese (i think), etc. MY favorite is the cheddar, mushroom, bacon and tomato.  OMG I wish I had one today.  Served with spiced roasted potatoes and sour dough bread that is so damn good.  ANother great dish is the Pancakes...the best buttermilk pancakes I have ever tasted.  THey are so light and fluffy served with a fruit compote.  THe burger was juicy and had the best flavor served with blue cheese and the fries...Salted perfectly and served with a chiptole aioli-mayo based dipping sauce.  I had to eat it all.  The short-rib hash served with poached eggs was a very rich dish and it was good but for my stomach I couldn't do it again.  The classic eggs benedict is perfect.So many different dishes to try...and the coffee is bold and served with cream.  So fattening but oh so good.  It gets busy but so worth the wait.  I love you Stone Park, but I do need to come for dinner.",5.0

"The waiter was really annoying with the up-sale pressure.  When he realized we were only getting burgers and a glass of wine, it seemed like we weren't worth his time.   Whatever.  We ordered the burgers medium rare and they came out well done, but we didn't complain because the restaurant seemed to be telling us we were lucky they let our broke selves eat there.  Plus the waiter never stopped by so we couldn't.  So we just hung our heads and ate the charred burgers.  Being totally cooked through they were still delicious and could imagine they would be phenomenal if they were cooked right.",4.0

"I went here for brunch this past weekend with my boyfriend and parents, and had an absolutely fantastic meal! The boyfriend and I went for the short rib hash, which we'd been dreaming about since spotting it on an online menu awhile ago, and it absolutely lived up to our expectations. I got mine with poached eggs, which were delicious, and subbed toast out for their homemade English Muffin, which was also fantastic. My dad got the chef's omelette, which he enjoyed, and my mom went for the absolutely wonderful grits with shrimp, which I am already contemplating ordering when I eventually return! The one gripe we had was that our service was a little slow, particularly since my parents were raring to get back on the road to Massachusetts. The table next to us, who had arrived later, was served before us.

"My wife and I ate here last night.  Walked in off the street around 7:30 and were given a table for two as long as we agreed to be out by 9.  That was fine by us, we had a band to check out.  We split a tempura/lobster roll fancy coleslaw appetizer that was pretty good.  The wife ordered a pork chop and I ordered the rack of lamb.  I don't know about a rack, more like 3 of its ribs.  That was over some mashed spuds and a lamb hash, with a horseradishy spread.  It was excellent, but it was a models portion, I am not a model.  The Mrs. plowed into her inch thick pork chop an grudgingly gave me a bite.  It was delicious.  We finished up with two flourless deserts.  The wife had an Almond Cake and I had Chocolate Hazelnut slice that was so-so the cherry sauce moistened it up.  The room was decorated with an understated modern elegance.  It was a bit loud and NYC tight.  The service was excellent, the presentation was beautiful.  The food is great Stone Park is one of the better PS restaurants.  I can cook and I am not making this at home.  I found the portions small but I am a big eater.  We don't drink I had a soda, with tip we dropped  $120.",4.0
"While the menu is a little pricey, Stone Park Cafe is hands-down my favorite restaurant in Park Slope. It serves classic dishes with haughty twists. Example? Their BLT is made with pork belly, not bacon. Whatever their reasoning, the food is always delicious and the staff is always attentive and welcoming. If you want to try Stone Park but don't have the cash to spend on their dinners (entrées usually run $22-$34), try their brunch--amazing, reasonably priced egg dishes and strong, spicy Bloody Marys abound.",5.0

"This casual, yet super sweet joint has the best burger anywhere in all 5 bouroughs! Not to mention the perfect fries with oiive tapanede dip that come with the burgers! Watch out Corner Bistro - you've finally got some competition!",5.0
This is a great place to take the 'rents or some visitors from out of town.  There's something for everyone and it's all near gourmet quality yet not too pricey.  It's a lovely space.  Service has been disappointing more than once but food is always a pleaser.  I wish they would update their menu more often - it is a rather small selection and hasn't changed much for the last 6 months as far as I can tell.,4.0
"My wife and I ate here last night.  Walked in off the street around 7:30 and were given a table for two as long as we agreed to be out by 9.  That was fine by us, we had a band to check out.  We split a tempura/lobster roll fancy coleslaw appetizer that was pretty good.  The wife ordered a pork chop and I ordered the rack of lamb.  I don't know about a rack, more like 3 of its ribs.  That was over some mashed spuds and a lamb hash, with a horseradishy spread.  It was excellent, but it was a models portion, I am not a model.  The Mrs. plowed into her inch thick pork chop an grudgingly gave me a bite.  It was delicious.  We finished up with two flourless deserts.  The wife had an Almond Cake and I had Chocolate Hazelnut slice that was so-so the cherry sauce moistened it up.  The room was decorated with an understated modern elegance.  It was a bit loud and NYC tight.  The service was excellent, the presentation was beautiful.  The food is great Stone Park is one of the better PS restaurants.  I can cook and I am not making this at home.  I found the portions small but I am a big eater.  We don't drink I had a soda, with tip we dropped  $120.",4.0
"While the menu is a little pricey, Stone Park Cafe is hands-down my favorite restaurant in Park Slope. It serves classic dishes with haughty twists. Example? Their BLT is made with pork belly, not bacon. Whatever their reasoning, the food is always delicious and the staff is always attentive and welcoming. If you want to try Stone Park but don't have the cash to spend on their dinners (entrées usually run $22-$34), try their brunch--amazing, reasonably priced egg dishes and strong, spicy Bloody Marys abound.",5.0
"Without a doubt, this is my favorite brunch place in all of New York!  Sure there can be a line, but there is a reason.  Yes, the servers are all running around, but they are all friendly.  The food is divine, and drinks are spot on!  In winter the biscuits and gravy are the perfect dish, and in summer sitting on the patio watching the park next door and eating an omelet  is a favorite pastime.  The dinner is even better!  It can get a bit pricey, but it's always worth every penny.",5.0

"Best meal I've had in ages.  I got the arugula salad with grilled peaches and a perfectly coated lemon dressing, and the braised rabbit which was just perfect.  The cheesecake was also exceptional.  I really just can't wait to get back to this place -- counting down the days!",5.0
One of the best brunches in Park Slope.  Fantastic service and breakfast worth waiting for.  Also a good place for dinner and drinks.  I have always found Stone Park to have consistently good service and a real nice menu.,4.0

"My wife and I had the 8 oz burger at Sunday Brunch.  Food was excellent, Decor ok.  The place is loud and crowded.  The stand out though was the service.  Our waitress was wonderful.  This is not the place for warm intimate dinner.  But if you want an excellent meal with friends, give it a try.",4.0
"Six or seven months ago I would have agreed this was worthy of four stars but now they just seem kind of spaced out. Because the vegetarian options are limited, I stick to brunch options here. My staple is the breakfast quesadilla which is appropriately proportioned and comes with a side of home fries. However, today we didn't remember it came with the side of potatoes and ordered extra. Our server did not take any opportunity to alert us of the included sides, nor was it indicated on the menu, and thus we had way too much spuds and took the side home. (To be eaten when and with what, I don't know) Also I alerted the staff that there was no real sugar on the table only artificial sweetener. Because my cappuccino was a bit bitter I wanted to sweeten it up a bit but was left staring at pink, yellow and blue chemical  packets. The woman who I alerted briskly and doubtfully took the sugar bowl and scrounged through it like she was looking for lost treasure. Finally agreeing that no there was no sugar, she snatched the bowl from our neighbors table with no excuse me, apology or thank you to them. I realize that these are little gripes which in no way reflect the quality of the meal. However, a little attention to customer service can make or break the experience. Oh, and did I mention we waited forever for our change. Yes, in fact we would like our change. You thought all that was your tip? You know what they say about assuming.",3.0
Quite possibly the best french toast i've ever had. Cool ambiance: comfortable and slightly shmancy. My friend says everything else is good on the brunch menu as well.,5.0
"I would LOVE to give this place another star....but i just cant. I've been here for brunch a couple times and its been great. Love the biscuits and gravy....love. However, a ""4-5 Yelp Star"" restaurant should be good for all meals of the day! We went to Stone Park last night with a couple of our friends. Honestly, this was our second choice but Bino (Carroll Gardens...our all time fav) was closed to replace something in kitchen. So, we venture to Stone Park. I had the scallops and they were good. Cooked well. Risotto was nice but nothing fancy. One of our friends got the Gnocchi app for a meal, also good.The two boys split the steak for two. This is where my complaint lies. We were told they were 54-60 oz steaks at $2/oz. Ok, i know a bone in steak means the bone will count towards the weight of the steak....but this was ridiculous. The bone was at least half the weight...AT LEAST. For two grown men, this steak was not even close to a portion each. There were maybe 4 decent (thin) slices total and then it tappered off to the ends. My husband came home hungry even after we had dessert (at the Chocolate Room). NOT a steak for two, or even one for that matter. And the side of asparagus was about 6 skinny short pieces. Come one Stone Park....not a meal. I would give them another shot for Brunch but this will NOT be a place I ever go back to for dinner.",3.0

"oh... my... god... i ate here with my parents last night, and our meal was so good that it's worth chronicling every bite.  first, since we were celebrating my mom's birthday, we ordered cocktails (the bottle of wine came later.)  i got to drink a bit of all three -- the passionfruit cosmo, the pomegranate cosmo, and the (straight-up) margarita... they were so good... nice 'n' tart.  then we shared two appetizers: a very tasty salad and the grilled artichoke, which might've been the best artichoke i've ever had.  for our entrees, my mother couldn't decide between the scallops and the rack of lamb so she ordered one and i ordered the other and we shared both.  what a smart decision.  as i put it (and she completely agreed), i loved both dishes so much that i wasn't sad that i only got to eat half of one, because it meant getting to eat half of the other.  i mean, the scallops were unbelievable -- sweet, tender, not fishy at all -- and the rack of lamb was amazing.  i didn't try my dad's sesame encrusted salmon but given that his plate was as empty as mine and my mom's, i'm guessing he enjoyed it.  then we shared a chocolate pecan torte with ""smoked chocolate ice cream"" and ""vanilla sour cream.""  it was so rich that i can't imagine eating a whole piece by myself, but it was really delicious.  finally, our bill came with these tiny little cookies (it always does, i believe), three varieties, all incredibly tasty.  i left the restaurant stuffed and content and determined to eat there again soon.",5.0
"The most charred burger I've ever been served. We ordered our burgers medium-rare and they came out black. The inside was okay, but it was impossible to get past the charred, chemical taste on the outside. For a $12 burger, we had slightly higher expectations, so we politely sent them back asking to go easy on the outside, and the manager returned with a message from the chef saying that is how they make their burgers and we should order something else. We considered but were really in the mood for a burger, so we insisted on new burgers cooked with less fire. They finally complied, and the new burgers tasted very good, but it was a wait and a stupid hassle. The restaurant itself is cozy and in a great location. They also had a good selection of wine. It's too bad the chef would choose a dish like a burger and fries to get snooty about when it was  obviously overcooked and that management supported such an attitude. We recommend sticking to their brunch which has been good (not special, but reliably good). Sit in the back room so you can take in the sun and the park view.",2.0
