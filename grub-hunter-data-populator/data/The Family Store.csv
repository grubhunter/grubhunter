Was not sure what to expect when I walked into this place but the minute I walked in I knew this was going to a delicious experience.  All the food looks fresh and well made.  There are a variety of options to choose from and I went with some the lentils and rice and the falafel sandwich.  Both were fantastic!I wish I could have had a taste of everything.  Next time I am in there I will go for the avocado salad.Well done Family Store.,5.0
"Double take: 5 stars and 60+ reviews!Place lives up to the ranking. The food is amazing, but this is like a gourmet deli counter. That is not a knock, just the reality that seating is limited and the business is primarily pre-made, come in and take home.Back to the food: unbelievable! It's thanksgiving season and they had it all, so I tried it all. The turkey is to die for and the crab cakes with special sauce beats the best. Try the dried ginger for desert.I also wanted to mention the staff, led by Sam, is friendly and helpful.  Tastings are plentiful and they go the extra mile to ensure you have ordered appropriately. Remember, pre-made so they ensure the temp is exactly to your liking.I recommend going with the seasonal specials and asking what they recommend. You won't be disappointed!",5.0
Honestly one of the best places in Bay Ridge (if not Brooklyn). There's always something new to try but I always get the Brussel Sprouts and the Cauliflower. Also a ton of Vegan And Vegetarian options which isn't typical in Bay Ridge. Love the Family Store!,5.0
"Finally came here after I kept hearing my coworker keep raving about their lentil soup. She was right, it was delicious but it was a bit steep $5 for a small container.  I also ended up getting this cauliflower dish for $4.  It was even in a much smaller container and cost $4.  Honestly, I felt ripped off after seeing how much it was because it goes by weight.  When I did taste it, it was good! It just doesn't make sense to come here all the time and pay that much when there are so much more places to go to that is way cheaper, also good, and have more portion, but that's just me.  I will come back here once in a while to get my lentil soup and cauliflower fix. Was the food good, yes.  Also, friendly staff.",4.0
"I fell in love with this place from the start. The moment I walked in I got the strong sense of people that were proud of their place, proud of their food, welcoming to anyone who walks through the door and eager to have new customers taste all of their delicious dishes. This really is ""The family store"". I never understood why this was the name of the place but now it makes true sense. I have been back every day since the first day. I love the food and the happy faces as well. This place is a Brooklyn gem! I recommend it to anyone!! You can easily feed your family, grab a snack or cater a party.. And by the way if anyone caterers their party with this food please invite me!!",5.0
"OMGoodness! Just ate the BEST...I mean, the MOST DELICIOUS crab cakes ever! Love me some crab cakes so I've eaten my share. One doesn't need to travel south to Maryland or even further than lovely Bay Ridge to find these as a trip to The Family Store will gladly provide. So glad I picked some up this evening...YUM!",5.0
Went for the first time this past weekend. Definitely a hidden gem in Bay Ridge. The food was freshly prepared and delicious! The falafel pizza was both innovative and ridiculously delicious. The staff was very friendly and explained every dish-part of why I walked out with so much! Will definitely be back!,5.0
Variety of delicious dishes and the most amazing semolina cheesecake! Kitchen perfection. Owner Sam is very nice and accommodating. I highly recommend this place..,5.0

"I LOVE The Family Store! I work nearby and I stop by often to buy lunch. Everything I have tried had been amazing. One of my favorite dishes is the portobello mushrooms. I also especially like the escarole and the avocado salad. Oh, and the seasoned pita chips! I could keep on going. I ordered food for a holiday party about a year ago and they handled the order very professionally and everyone at the party loved the food. The staff is very knowledgable about the foods they offer and they can give recommendations or let you know about any ingredients you may be concerned out. They also offer a taste if there is a dish you are considering or if there is a new dish they think you might like. There are plenty of vegan and vegetarian options. They accept credit cards.",5.0
"I just happen to stumble upon this place while in search for Arabic food in the area.  I  did not want to buy expensive restaurant food and figured will give this place a try. I bought from here Falafel, Baba Ghanoush, and Tabouli.  Its very high quality and the prices are good for the amount that you get.  The Falafel honestly is some of the best I've ever had.  I really like how everything is to go in containers. Eat as much as you want and save the rest for later! lol  Also they have pre-made foods like falafel mix in the freezer which can be bought and cooked at home (thought that was cool!). The deli case has a nice variety of Lebanese foods that you do not normally find in typical Arabic spots.  I am a new fan and will stop by more often when in the neighborhood.",5.0
"This is a take out food venue, no seating. While the food is good, the prices are exaggerated. Prices should be posted so people don't feel like what they are paying is random.  Who goes shopping without knowing what they are going to pay?",3.0
"There is seating for only 3 ppl. It's really a take-out only but they accommodate those solo stragglers, from out of town like myself. The staff are SUPER NICE PEOPLE! I ordered 3 Falafel Balls and 2 Spinach Pies. It had to be the tastiest falafel I've ever eaten. The spinach pie was also delicious. As I went up to the counter to pick up my order I was asked if I'd ever eaten they're Kale Salad. When I told them ot was my first time hear they said ""Oh then you must try it"". It too was scrumptious!!! This place is the real deal authentic middle eastern food. As you're leaving or coming into NYC via the Verrazano Bridge it's only 5 minutes out of the way and would make for a great gift or even just to bring home to your  own fridge!!! Couldn't leave without trying the Baklava and it too was way above par!!!I'LL BE BACK...",5.0
"Wonderful food and very friendly owners. If you're anywhere near here, get a meal. Truly wonderful flavors. They gave me a number of free samples to find what I liked, though the problem was I liked everything.",5.0
The food is delicious but the portions and prices are ridiculous. They supposedly have a lunch special that isn't posted anywhere for $8.95. This price changes at the drop of a hat. This was the price a few weeks ago. I added a bottle of juice and somehow that made it $12.95! How?! Today I asked the lady up front the price of the lunch special and while stuttering and stammering changed the price 3 times in one breath. To run a successful business you must maintain some level of integrity and put the customer first. I'm very disappointed and will not be returning. I had to buy a bag of popcorn chips today to supplement my tiny portions at The Family Store. Not happy. Thanks for the offer of a free falafel for a good Yelp review but I'll maintain my integrity and leave an honest review.,2.0

"What an unbelievable place!I needed food catered for my wife's birthday and I was torn between all the neighborhood restaurants I could use. Sushi had been done, BBQ had been done, American classic had been done, I had no clue what I wanted... and then a good friend of mine recommended The Family Store.My God! What a fantastic idea. I presented to Sam the number of people and what was required, I also gave him a budget. What he prepared was nothing short of a miracle. He helped me out by going above and beyond what he should do. Supplying plates, napkins, knives, forks, spoons, and even extra aluminum trays for party goers to take food home at the end. Sam is a wonderful thoughtful business owner whom has earned my business for a lifetime. Food that he made up- An avocado leaf roasted Pernil in a chipotle sauce- A garlic chicken dish which was in a delicious sauce- A vegetarian dish, eggplant pasta, super flavorful and amazing for a vegetarian dish!- Lentil Pilaf- Avocado salad- Cucumber Salad- Jumbo garlic grilled shrimp- Lemon potatoes- Mediterranean dishes such as babaganoush, hummus, olives, bread, etc. - And quite a few other dishes All in all, the service, the hospitality of Sam, the earthiness of the food, the quality of the food, including the labor (which all these dishes were extremely labor intensive, the pernil was pork roasts that had to be cooked at minimum of 4 hours to be as tender as it was, then hand carved and put back into the sauce) make me a lifelong customer of Sam's. I can't speak highly enough of this place. They have carry out food as well as a full cold salad bar available for carry out. Try them out, you won't be disappointed.",5.0
"Sam, Omar and all of the family store employees are amazing! They are friendly, helpful and extremely passionate about food! Now having said that! They make amazing food!!!

"I'm a teacher working a couple of blocks away from The Family Store. I've been ordering my lunch there for 2+ years now and I have to say that it's a treat every time. Today I had the falafel pizza. Another day the falafel pita. Moroccan sardine pita. Lamb sandwich. The list goes on. Wide selection. All fresh. And if you've got a sweet tooth, the cheesecake, baked fresh daily, is completely out of this world. The Family Store easily falls into the ""It's all great"" category. I love this place.",5.0

My dad and husband who are hard to please with turkey raved about it!  We love the family store.  You literally never have to cook ever again! The cauliflower in tahini is my absolute favorite.",5.0

"LOVE this place. I have mixed emotions writing this review because it's kind of a neighborhood secret and I like it that way, but they deserve all the success they can get. They offer a wide selection of take-out only homemade Mediterranean food, with lots of vegetarian options but plenty of meat and fish too. Everything they have looks beautiful and is super healthy and delicious. I've tried about 20 different dishes and loved them all. Most things are $8/lb.The owners and employees are really nice and helpful and will usually offer you samples. It's the perfect place to duck in and grab something for dinner at home or a picnic.

It's like walking into someone's kitchen and picking out some of the most delicious food you can have. First they let u taste almost everything. And everything always looks and tastes so fresh. Must be cause they're always cooking in the back. Every time I've been in there there's something fresh being cooked up. So far I've tried their jerked chicken eggplant babaghanoush hummus turkey pot pie and lentil cake. Lentil cake is so damn good I get it every time I order. I will be trying everything they have to offer. They also have some great vegeterian dishes you can put together. This is definitely a neighborhood gem it's also worth the trip even if you don't live nearby. Just remember no seating. To go only. so Go. Taste. Eat. Smile,5.0
"I had heard The Family Store was good, but my experience exceeded all my expectations.  Tony, the guy working the store, was personable, helpful, and made sure that every single customer felt welcome.  He obviously knew many of them personally and was able to joke around with them and make them feel at home.For me, he let me sample the semolina cheesecake and potato salad -- both of which were amazing -- and then made me a custom sandwich in a pita.  The sandwich was incredible (even though I have no idea what was in it), and I'll definitely be going back to get it again.  Definitely will be traveling to Bay Ridge again just to visit this place.",5.0
"Authentic Middle Eastern store with homemade food for take out or catering, not a restaurant. Great place to stop on your way home from work and get dinner. so, so good.",5.0
Good stuff very fresh and homemade . I am only giving it 4 stars because of the price of the food but it's worth it . Lost 10 pounds eating the lentils that I now make at home . Worth a visit if you are in the area,4.0
"Have only been here a few times, but each time I get something else and each time it turns out to be excellent.  Not everything is spectacular, but it's good, and some of the stuff is fantastic.  For a take-out counter, I think that is great.  I look forward to each visit and try something new each time.",4.0
"We catered Thanksgiving dinner from the family store and we requested nut free.  We got a turkey, stuffing, green beans, mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, lentil soup, and homemade cranberry sauce.  When we received our stuffing it had pecans in it.  I called the family store the next day and they gave me an extremely generous gift certificate and apologized for the mistake.  Rich was exceptional and did remember our order.  He was absolutely great and I would definitely order Thanksgiving from them again.  The turkey we got from them was the BEST we have had in YEARS! My dad and husband who are hard to please with turkey raved about it!  We love the family store.  You literally never have to cook ever again! The cauliflower in tahini is my absolute favorite.",5.0

"LOVE this place. I have mixed emotions writing this review because it's kind of a neighborhood secret and I like it that way, but they deserve all the success they can get. They offer a wide selection of take-out only homemade Mediterranean food, with lots of vegetarian options but plenty of meat and fish too. Everything they have looks beautiful and is super healthy and delicious. I've tried about 20 different dishes and loved them all. Most things are $8/lb.The owners and employees are really nice and helpful and will usually offer you samples. It's the perfect place to duck in and grab something for dinner at home or a picnic. Btw the store cat is cute but it will scratch you so be warned.",5.0

"I've only been there once so far, but the food I got was incredible.  Since it's deli-style you can get as much or as little of most things as you want, which makes it easy to try a small amount of many dishes and I highly recommend that since there are so many good things to try.  Everything we got was freshly prepared and delicious, but perhaps the biggest surprise was a cauliflower dish with tahini sauce.  I don't usually like cauliflower but the owner - who was very nice and had great suggestions - recommended it so I gave it a try and loved it.  They manage a great balance of traditional Mediterranean recipes with some unique and creative additions.  Not like some of those ""fusion"" restaurants that just make a mess, but really well thought-out ""spins"" on traditional dishes and some non-Mediterranean favorites as well.  You really feel the individuality of the chefs, and that's evident, too, when you talk to the owner about the dishes.  Can't recommend this place highly enough.",5.0

"My boyfriend and I just noticed this place for the first time yesterday as we were walking by, and am I glad that we did.  We stopped in just to see what they had, and we received incredible customer service.  Very friendly and helpful.  We had just eaten and had plans for dinner so we only picked up grape leaves as a snack but they were great.  And we were treated to a taste of the lentil yam dish that was wonderful.  Spicy and sweet in just the right combination.  And everything they had looked wonderful.  We will definitely be back to get more some day soon.",5.0
"Seriously delicious and authentic middle eastern delights. Before I moved to Bay Ridge and I was dating my husband, he used to pick up food from here and bring it over to my place for date night and I was always wowed. So worth checking out.",5.0
"My new favorite lunch place...After discovering this gem a few weeks ago, I've picked up lunch from Family store about 10  times.  If you want authentic middle eastern food then go to family store.  Everythings a delicacy here...ESPECIALLY their Semolina cheesecake.  It's probably the best dessert I've ever had in my whole life.Definitely get:Their yogurt- made fresh every morningString Cheese-  "" "" "" "" "" ""Stuffed Grape LeavesCracked wheat with chicpeasAll their salad kind of thingsBeet salad..mmmGo go go",5.0
"Lots of specialties in the store. Most, if not all are homemade food. I only had the spinach pie (good balance of spinach and cheese) for 3.00. The young man at the counter was not very friendly but not rude. Last visit a woman served me. She was super friendly. Would come back to try other goodies.",3.0
"Super friendly family with the most (!!) delicious home-made goods.  It really doesn't get any better than this place. As you order, you'll be given sweet little tastes (of this and that) and you will never be disappointed. Your list of favorite items just keeps getting longer...If this is what it means to cook with love, then I willingly accept their love. Thank you family store. I will see you soon.R",5.0
"I love when I can come out from Staten Island, for their food, which truly tastes homemade & done with great care & wonderful taste!  We are big foodies, & it is always a treat to try the myriad of dishes that come out from the kitchen each day.  The owner is very nice & will even deliver to Staten Island, though the fun is coming into the store, in person, & looking over all the great items that are being put out for the day.  The stuffed grape leaves, hummus, everything, is just so good, even the tuna salad, my wife feels, is the best that she ever had, & she samples tuna salad from all over the city to find what she loves.  The hot food begs one to skip making dinner & just pick up something from the Family Store.",5.0

"I don't really know how to best explain my love for The Family Store. The food here will make you feel like you have a Middle-Eastern grandma, and if you happen to have a Middle-Eastern grandma, I bet the food here will beat your grandma's food. Everything I have ever had has been incredibly good. Great falafel, taboule, and hummus. I love all the eggplant dishes (they even make a baba ganoush and onions sandwich taste good) and they used to (not sure if the still do) make a killer orzo and wild rice salad. Minerva sandwich with lentils and eggplant is amazing. The semolina cheesecake is addictive. I can't walk out without grabbing a generous slice!When I grow up, this is how I want to cook.Happy eating!",4.0
"Wow. I just returned from a 2-and-a-half week trip to Turkey, and this food was as good as what I enjoyed there. I visited the Family Store with a large group of bicyclists; a group our size is often the cause of ill-temper from staff when we enter an eating establishment. Not the case here.

"I love the family store however, I had to find an old review by New York magazine to find out what their hours of operation were. They aren't listed here????? why not??? and they aren't listed on the businesses webiste. ????? Huh??? And when you call the business,they don't even have an outgoing voicemail. Wha????!!!! The food is great but they have some catching up to do...updated and accurate information for your customers is very important. thank you.",5.0
"I rarely write reviews and even though I haven't been to Family Store in a couple years now, I felt it my duty to give a shout out to Sam and his deliciously wonderful establishment as a thank you to all the years it provided me with outstanding cuisine during my years as an NYC resident.This will always be one of my favorite places to eat in NYC. It's looks can be deceiving - I would categorize it as a hole in the wall, not because it is slightly rundown- in fact inside it is bright, clean and well organized - but because it is a fairly small with no places for dine-in so everything has to be taken to go.Let me just say that it's a foodie gold mine when it comes to the cuisine offerings. Sam is of Middle Eastern decent (I believe Iranian) and his cuisine has a strong Mediterranean influence and anything you order is going to be gourmet quality for what I think is a bargain price. Everything from hummus, tabbouleh, yummy veggies and meats and even some imported packaged food stuffs for those that want to cook themselves - hence the ""store"" portion of the name.This place hands-down has THE BEST CRAB CAKES I have ever had and I have tried them in multiple cities/multiple restaurants from East Coast to West. Everyone I've introduced to them has agreed 100%, including my grandmother who is obsessed with crab cakes and usually won't eat anyone else's but her own. They also have these amazing lentils with fried caramelized onions that I have been trying for years to duplicate in my own kitchen. (Damn you Sam for being so talented in the kitchen - wait! i take that back - you're my hero! Please don't ban me! lol!) His specialties are great too - I've had a sirloin steak aged 60 days in a homemade concoction that made the meat so tender, flavorful, and unique in taste. I mean - this man can work miracles! (thanks in part to many recipes passed down from his mother god bless her!)He will even ship his products to you, overnight if needed for the cooked food so he doesn't have to freeze it and ruin the integrity of his creations. (As I found out on my b-day when my BF surprised me with FS crab cakes - incredible!) I'm actually heading to the East Coast in a few days and I am going to drive 50 miles out of my way to pick up an army of crab cakes for my family - they make great gifts that never go unappreciated - or uneaten!Thanks Sam for providing me delicious food options at affordable prices - you were a life saver to a student on a beer budget with champagne tastes. Do yourself a favor and get there - even if it's a trek from your neighborhood - the trip will be worth it, trust me.",5.0
"I really love this store. I grew up in my folks small business, so I have a soft spot for mom-&-pop shops, but all praise given to The Family Store is well deserved. Their taboule is the freshest, most wonderful I have ever tasted. I could eat it out of the container, a some warm pita for lunch and be happy as a clam, it's just so yummy.Their service is friendly, and they take credit cards. You can see they pride themselves on delivering fresh and they do not disappoint. If you're ever in Bay Ridge, stop by this wonderful gem. You be pleasantly happy you did.",4.0
"We get takeout from here all the time. The food is amazing. I wish they had seats. The avocado salad is one of the most delicious things ever. I love their chickpea and eggplant bread, their spinach pies, the wild rice salad, stuffed cabbage, and many other things. Its a heaven for vegetarian and vegan options as well as the meat eaters. The staff is knowledgeable on the ingredients. We had them cater a birthday party and the amount of food was incredible and the quality the best. Its worth travelling here if you are not in the area.",5.0
"What a find...for so many reasons!  The food is truly authentic, so many choices, and everything is fresh!!!!  The store is kept very clean and orderly.  Lots of choices of nuts and dried fruits, too.  Prices are very reasonable, and the staff is a joy...very friendly, customer-focused and knowledgeable about what they are selling.  I see another yelper commented on the cheesecake.  It is off the charts...one of the best I've ever had, and I've had plenty!   This store is a keeper, for sure...check it out.  You won't be sorry!",5.0

"If i were to describe the family store in one word i would be doing it an injustice, but most definitely one word comes to my mind every-time i go there: It's definitely an adventure. First, they do the classic middle eastern dishes to perfection, the hummus, tabouleh, mouhamara, and their delicious fresh meat, cheese, and eggplant pies are just a few examples. More importantly for me at least, they use middle eastern ingredients and famous classical dishes to create a more modern cuisine. Like i said its definitely an adventure. Not to mention the great influence and fusion with italian and greek cuisines. These guys cook with love. Did i mention that i work at a premier top 100 restaurant in NYC. And oh yes, its a lebanese restaurant. My point is not to compare both places, but to point out how phenomenal and exciting the food is at the family store. Its always an adventure, always a surprise, and i will always keep coming back for more. Great Job guys. Home cooking at its finest.",5.0
