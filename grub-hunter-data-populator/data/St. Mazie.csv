"This place is quite a guessing game to find but once you are there it is absolutely worth it. The moment you walk in you will hear a classy nice live jazz band playing which is seldom to find in NYC these days. Left door and go down, you will find a sexy little wine cav where you can enjoy a little intimate time with a date or a friend who you would want to chit-chat away over great choices of red, rosè to white. Go up and chill with the band, sit at the bar and enjoy a glass of drink and meet people. Give a little smile away and you're good. And if you're a smoker, oh boy! Need no weird bystanding outside, explore the little garden at the back. Food is excellent! Service is great, really nice people. You just have to wait a little, and can't blame, the place is conveniently packed. A must to see! And by the way, come early. Live jazz band usually plays just up to 10pm or maybe it was just last night. Have fun!",5.0
"Stopped in w a group of 6 on a Saturday night. We sat in the basement, which was dark and very warm - good as it was cold and wintery. Great service, waitress was friendly and totally on the ball. We enjoyed Numerous bottles of wine, which made us feel good. Spicy sweet potato soup w cheese: really good, well flavored and a decent amount of cheeseChicken: quite tasty, mashed potatoes were goodGreat meal, service, would definitely go back",4.0
"Nice cozy small bar with unique deco. It's not so obvious to spot it, you may miss it within a blink ;) It's really packed on Saturday night, try to find a spot and wait till 10 pm, there will be the live band~ you won't regret for standing in crowd and waiting for it!There's always surprise in Williamsburg. Blink blink, oops, u missed St.Mazie ;)",4.0
"Haven't been to mazis in a while and I guess things have changed. 3pm walked in to a typical crowd. No sign on the door to indicate a private event. I should have taken the hint from all the scolding looks. Sat down, waited, waited. Decided to ask the busy bartender if there was a private event happening, there is and will end by 5pm. So that was that. Loved coming here for my laundry days, maybe next time around I'll get to see if the food is going downhill too.",3.0
"Doing some bar hopping with friends on a saturday night. After the first bar, we started yelping to find another bar & found this on yelp. I love the ambience & vibe of this place! They have some room downstairs that looks so pretty & good for date nights! They have outdoor spot too. I came with my friends & boyfriend so we choose to stay upstairs & chill. Looks like they have some jaz player but got their around 12, too bad we missed it! :(We sat & got a table while we chill & enjoy our drinks. Drinks here is good! I ordered non alcoholic drink, the pomegranate iced tea & it was amazing! It taste very different from any regular iced tea. I got some raw oysters too. I missed the happy hour so it cost $3 per oyster. Service is good & fast. I wanna go back to try some of their real food! Can't wait.",4.0
"What a charming place!Came here on a busy weekend night when they had a live jazz band playing. Love the vibe and ambience of this place. It's small/cozy, intimate. Dimmed lighting and lots of candles. It's a bit loud and hard to carry on a conversation, but didn't mind too much because the band was hopping and was really lost in the music. There's a few tables and seats out front close to the entrance, the bar is in the middle, and then some more tables closer to the stage in the back of the restaurant. There's a super small space in front of the stage which some people try to dance in, but it's really crowded and cramped so don't be expecting to bust out your fancy lindy hop routine or tossing your partner around in aerials haha.The bartenders were nice and cocktails were around $10 which is super reasonable by NY standards. Only improvement I could see is maybe having one more bartender on busy nights. The night I was there, there were only two so there was a bit of a wait getting drinks...but really not that big of a deal.Definitely recommend this place to enjoy a cocktail, listen to some jazz...in a fun, casual, yet romantic environment. Will be back!",5.0
"Awful service. We were the only ones in the entire restaurant and it took over an hour to get our food. Our waitress had the worst attitude and couldn't have cared less about us even though we were her only customer. An hour after waiting for our food she comes over and says, how do you want your eggs cooked. Why didn't she ask that when she took our order or within the hour we were waiting.",1.0
"Happy hour - check.. oysters - check. Halley and Paige.. two hottest employees working here - check. Happy hour runs daily from 6 to 8 pm, 1.50 oysters, 5 dollar house wine and 4 dollar brooklyn lager. Cant go wrong, and if you think otherwise.. you need to check the video of these awesome chick busting a move :p100 percent will be back.",5.0
"We went to St. Mazie's for her birthday because we heard that they had live flamenco on Friday nights. We get there around 10 pm and it was already pretty crowded, but we were able to procure two nice seats pretty close to the small stage. We were already to full from our dinner to get food, so we just filled our tummies with the delicious house wine. The prices are average for Williamsburg, roughly $10 per cocktail and our bottle of house wine was around $27. The musicians and dancers were extremely authentic and talented, which really gave a great feel to the bar. For a second I felt as if I had been teleported to a small Spanish watering hole. After the music was over, we had a few words with the guitarist and the dancer and then we were on our way. Overall, the venue was pretty average for a bar. But the music really made it memorable and enjoyable.  - Jonny and Zoe",4.0
"I had a good time here. I was an hour late for my reservation but was still seated. The dining area is on the lower level, when I arrived I stood there waiting to be acknowledged. When that didnt happen after a minute or two I went over to a server, maybe? Im not sure what his job title was but he said someone would be with us. I didnt like that but when we were finally seated everything went well. The food was ok but the drinks were really good. A very romantic place. My waitress was great. I'm not sure if I would return but I did enjoy myself here.",4.0
"If you are thinking of a place to take a date in the area and are hoping to canoodle during/after, St. Mazie is that place. We came here right before it started pouring on Saturday night and could have not have been more pleased with the service at the bar, the amazing music (upbeat Jazz?), the romantic lighting, and the just-right-amount of chatter from the patrons. Their seemingly newer venture, St. Charles is located downstairs and is used as a ""supper club"" of sorts. Their Happy Hour is from 5-8pm, even on a Saturday, hurray! We also had the Mazie Burger (very tasty toppings and well flavored patty, but it was on, oddly enough, a stale bun), pasta of the day (the mixture of tomato sauce, olive oil, and pecorino was so fresh and pungent), and a very skippable charcuterie board (although the pickled root veggies were quite good). All in all, a 3 star meal food-wise, but a solid 4 star for the ambiance. I would love to come here again,either for a date night or a ladies' night out.",4.0

"I was there last night for valentines day. The ambience was amazing with an amazing live jazz band. My biggest complaint was that despite being packed, they only seemed to have 2 servers and one was never to been seen. We literally had to ask for everything....""we would like to eat""....after 40 minutes at the table....""we need silverware"".....which we got 20 minutes after our food arrived. This continued throughout the entire meal. We would have ordered a lot more if there was a server to actually ask us! Poor staffing for a known busy evening! This really ruined the experience.",2.0
"A nice restaurant, when I went, there was a quite nice band playing and the food were really good. Nice atmosphere and I think that is a really nice place to a date. We order the mushroom risotto, that was good, but the amount was not so much. The drinks are amazing and the price is so good for NYC, it is 10 dollars most of them. Defo it is a place which I wanna try again.",4.0
There is literally nothing to fault!!! Not a single thing. AMAZING drinks. Like some of the best I've had in NYC. Food was delicious (if a little small in portion). Atmosphere was nothing short of perfect. Loved the decor. Staff were super pleasant and attentive. Live swing band were insanely good. I mean I'd literally come every night if I lived closer. I'd go so far as to say my favourite place in all of New York!!! Go/ run. You won't be disappointed.,5.0
"I love this place. Being the second time there, I finally got the taste the food, specifically the 'Deviled Eggs,' 'Risotto,' and Bruchetta! It was fantastic. The Deviled Eggs had lots of vinegar to cut the fatty yolk. The Risotto was creamy with mushrooms. The music was spot on, and all the dancers that came out to have a blast just made it all a transformative experience! Leave 2015 behind for 1915 instead once you walk in the door at St. Mazie.",5.0
"This is a nice cozy bar with live music. If you're looking for a quieter place for conversation, try the basement. Otherwise the upstairs is a fun and lively environment. They have a good house red and the drinks are strong. I'll have to come back and listen to some of the other musicians.",5.0
"We loved the little bar with live music in Williamsburg. #nyc #barreviewIt's small and in the middle of a small dark street - blink and you'll miss it. It's hip and cozy and quaint. The bar tenders are chill and so is the crowd. Good cocktails (I liked the Brown Derby) and excellent chocolate chip cookies. Best part: the live music. The Jazz band that played was the perfect accompaniment to the dim lighting. They played soft but funky music- not intrusive but not missable either. If you recommend this place, friends will think you're ""on the inside"" of Williamsburg.",5.0
"This place was rocking on a Sunday night.. Found this place on yelp and glad i came. Live band playing at 10pm and there were swing dancers. It's a cute date place. The reason why i gave it a 4 star is because food was okay, salad portion was small and had too much dressing mixed into it, could do better on menu",4.0
"I can't say enough great things about St. Mazie. Their weekend brunch in the back outdoor area feels like a little vacation, the cocktails are superb, the space is gorgeous / makes you feel like you've stepped into a Parisian cocktail bar, and to top it off they offer live jazz! Literally a wonderful place in South Williamsburg.",5.0

"A fun spot for drinks and music, but I'd pass on the food. The night to go is Sunday when Baby Soda Jazz band plays, it's the perfect time to drink Manhattans and take in some tunes. Don't forget a cute date. The bad part is that service takes forever, the pours are small, and the prices are expensive. Also you can't see your food because it's so dark and the tables are too small to actually enjoy the meal. It's a constant juggling act of moving around plates so they don't fall off. Waitresses wander by, but they don't actively try to help you unless you flag them down. You'll need to ask for everything, they generally don't anticipate diners needs, and take requests with a bit of an attitude. I mean, why do you need to ask three times for water, just refill the glasses in the first place!",3.0
"Outstanding brunch and cocktails. I have never been here past 1pm, and I realize that this becomes a different place after then, but man alive is the brunch good. It is around the corner from lodge and generally less packed and with better food. the portions are smaller and the prices higher, but I still come here often. The pork hash is to die for. No coffee but the americanos are great. Last time I was there a banjo and trumpet were lighting up a corner with great tunes. To top all of this off is a killer decor and vibe, will definitely be coming back again.",4.0
"What a great bar ! The place is soo cool, cozy and warm :)The ambience, decor, staff, drinks everything was beautiful And the best is they have live music very often if not every night!!!!!!

"I had a very quaint date at St. Mazie, and can imagine having more there in the future. The bar is tucked away down Grand Street--almost like a secret. The front was open on a warm Thursday night and the bar was full. There are tables in the back and a stage--that night a jazzy French band was playing and added to the Art Deco/retro vibes swirling around. The drink menu looked fantastic but I stuck with the house red, which was decent. We tried to sneak a peak at the backyard but it was closed that evening. After the band finished the crowd thinned out, giving us the chance to snag some stools and chat. Would love to come back and get adventurous with with cocktail menu and try their food.",4.0

"These guys were excellent. We had the dinner after our wedding in their basement for 48 people. (I'd say 50 people is the max for that room.) Everything was perfect: the food, the wine was excellent, and it was very reasonably priced relative to other places in Greenpoint, Williamsburg, and Bushwick--and we did a lot of research. Such a cool atmosphere in their basement too: intimate, old-timey, hip, Brooklyn-y. It was quite warm though but after we asked to turn the air-conditioning on, they did and all was well. Another note on the food: artisanal, farm-to-table, high-quality, well-prepared; everyone thought it was amazing. People said it was the best wedding they'd ever been to. We had the best experience at St. Mazie and and highly recommend them. Also, check out the history of the real Saint Mazie and you'll have fascinating dinner fodder!",5.0
"Decided to celebrate/welcome my first weekend of freedom from all the review books and old exam questions with my favorite meal of the day - brunch! (A free brunch for 2 to be exact - thanks howaboutwe!)My fiancé and I arrived around 12:45 for our scheduled date and this was place was completely empty. At first, We hesitated in going in since from the outside, the dining room was pretty much pitch black aka not open. But coming all the way from Manhattan in the middle of polar vortex, we were determined to get our free grub on. We decided to sit in the back of the restaurant with the leathery booth seats overlooking the entire restaurant. The ambiance was very cozy and laid back. My fiancé and I felt as if we were teleported back in time with the jazzy music and old school decor. It felt just so perfect as the place to be on a slow lazy snowy Saturday afternoon. Onto the food! We ended up ordering the St. Mazie BLT and smoked mackerel hash with a pomegranate iced tea and their Hemingway daiquiri.  The iced tea wasn't overwhelmingly sweet, just the I like it! Even though I'm not a big fan of cocktails, with the deal I knew I had to try one. The daiquiri I found was quite refreshing especially with the touch of grapefruit and lime. It was definitely worth trying. The food took a bit to come out - perhaps we were their first customers of the day. The couples who came in a good 20 mins after we arrived received their entrees at the same time as us. However the food certainly did not disappoint! My amazing deconstructive BLT came with two generous slices of French toasts, 4 strips of crispy bacon (on a bed of kale salad), and topped with 2 perfectly poached egg and sweet tomato purée. All the components combined and alone was simply delicious. It was just so much yummy food that I couldn't resist on not finishing. My fiancé was worried that smoked mackerel would be too fishy for his taste but found the dill sour cream, potato hash + the two slices of toasted sour dough with brushed on olive oil to be the perfect combination. This place definitively served one of the better brunches we've had. Our server Shawn/Sean? Was a complete sweetheart. He was on point from the beginning to the end. He took his time in explaining the deal - 2 cocktails + 2 entrees (allowed us to swap out the cocktail for tea/coffee/soft drinks). We were checked on multiple times and he was apologetic when the food took a bit of a wait. Even without the deal - people should stop by to try their brunch menu - each entree only cost about $12 - with the portion, creativity, and taste - definitely a steal! Just to imagine we weren't going to come because of the polar vortex, my belly would had missed out.",4.0

"This is easily my new favorite date bar. The decor is impeccable - you feel like you're in a dimly-lit speakeasy from the 1920's, from the ragtime playlist to the streetcar aesthetic.

There is usually live jazz late night, which is always a good addition to a drink. I can't wait to come back!",5.0

Heard from a couple friends about this place. My girlfriend and I randomly decided to come out on a Wednesday night. Definitely worth it. The food and drinks are great. The ambience/music.. on point. Totally forgot we were in  NYC. The perfect date night spot.,5.0
"My boyfriend and I wandered in here by chance the other night. We just wanted to enjoy a quick aperitif before dinner. What a pleasant find this adorable little restaurant was! The first floor was beautiful and had a bit of a modern touch to it. It was very homey and comfortable. What REALLY set this place apart, however, was the basement. The gent taking our order informed us it used to be a speakeasy during the prohibition era.The room downstairs was fairly small, but not in a claustrophobic kind of way (unless you can't stand low ceilings) and the lighting was impeccable- very romantic. The entire room was bathed in warm candle light with 1920's jazz music playing lazily in the background. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to impress a date. The mood is incredibly sexy and low-key. The drinks were very good too! I'm hoping to go back as soon as this next weekend rolls around and maybe try the food as well.",5.0
"Really enjoyed the ambiance at the bar. Dropped in on a quiet Monday night. They had a band playing in the corner of the bar. Not too loud. We could still carry a conversation. Very friendly bar/wait staff and a great and reasonably price drinks menu.Only complaint was the beer list. It was uninspired, but the wine on tap made up for it. We ordered a few of the smaller bites and they were really solid, but didn't delve too far into the menu.",4.0

"I lived in Williamsburg for 4 years and rarely come back. This bar reminds me of my fav places: La Maison Premiere and Manhattan Inn. The bar is beautiful, they have these old cable fans set up and it just takes you away to another time - perhaps a steam punk time - but more like the 1920's.The vibe is nice as I went there on a Tuesday night and they had a band playing some lounge music with guitars.",5.0
Amazing! The basement experience and decor is like nothing else.... And the food and drinks are from another time and place Beyond,5.0
Really amazing mushroom risotto and great drink selection. Excellent service and great live music. Also in a nice neighborhood very close to the Bedford L train stop but nowhere near as crazy and crowded as bars closer to the train are. Will definitely come here again to try other stuff on their menu!,5.0
"This is easily my new favorite date bar. The decor is impeccable - you feel like you're in a dimly-lit speakeasy from the 1920's, from the ragtime playlist to the streetcar aesthetic. (Think a bar version of the typical opening credits of a Woody Allen movie.) The drinks are varied and inspired, and the wait staff is nicely attentive for a busy place. Oh, and the best part? There is usually live jazz late night, which is always a good addition to a drink. I can't wait to come back!",5.0
"I just need the person responsible for the interior design's number. They should do my apartment. It is such a great atmosphere and with live music coming on on a weekday for dinner makes for a top notch experience. There is slight room for improvement on some food items like the cauliflower tempura and chicken dish, but there is evident quality in the food already.",4.0
"This place is quintessential second generation Williamsburg to me, the livelier older brother of Moto on Broadway. Great weathered French steampunk-esque decor, comfortable seating design, talented bartenders, attentive staff and a very tasty, small menu. A date night favorite because stylish, creative women love being here!",4.0
Heard from a couple friends about this place. My girlfriend and I randomly decided to come out on a Wednesday night. Definitely worth it. The food and drinks are great. The ambience/music.. on point. Totally forgot we were in  NYC. The perfect date night spot.,5.0
"My boyfriend and I wandered in here by chance the other night. We just wanted to enjoy a quick aperitif before dinner. What a pleasant find this adorable little restaurant was! The first floor was beautiful and had a bit of a modern touch to it. It was very homey and comfortable. What REALLY set this place apart, however, was the basement.

"This place is REALLY good for date drinks.So intimate, candle-lit, funky 1920s vibe, a nice bustling crowd.Also, the wine on tap is actually really really good.I got the hemingway daqauari cocktail because I am such a fan of the Sweet Science version, and I gotta say....wasn't as good.  A little too sweet and not enough tang.My bf got an applejack whiskey drink and it was good but again, too sweet.

What a cute spot. Candlelit ambiance sets the tone until about 10pm when this place is hoppin. The happy hour specials are great but the wine on tap is even better. If you park it at a table expect service from a waitress/bartender but when the bar fills up you'll have to hit the bar. I would definitely make this a spot to frequent. The location couldn't be better either at Marcy and Grand - start the crawl here and make your way up Grand!,4.0

"This is my favorite place in NYC, granted it's in Brooklyn but everything is better in Brooklyn.  It's the live music,the musicians it's like stepping back in time..when things seemed were simple.   I only wish that the musicians went on earlier than 11 PM.  The place does  tend to get a little bit crowded with the show performances so get there early so you don't have to elbow up to the bar.

"Tried to order a soda and double espresso. Bartender made the soda, walked away, and I watched him take care of three other customers (existing and new). I assumed he forgot the coffee, left momentarily and came back a few minutes later. He'd eventually started making the espresso but forgot about it and it had overflowed. I said, ""This is great! Actually, if that's waste then please, please don't make me another coffee, I would *love* to order a cocktail, may I see a drink menu?"" He said no (?!) and insisted on making me another espresso. ""No, but please I don't actually want a coffee after all. And since you haven't made the new one yet *please* let me give you a drink order."" He still talked over me and insisted that he remake my coffee. Feeling uncomfortable I basically begged, ""Sir (oh yeah, I said 'sir') *please* don't make me a new coffee, I would really like to order a drink...""His response? ""FINE! I'm making this for myself!"" and continued to make the espresso.Are you kidding me?! Regardless of the fact that I work in the service industry, who the f*ck talks to a customer like that EVER? And because I do work in that field, I'm overly polite to fellow servers/runners/bartenders, but that didn't help me one bit here. Not only that, but I was arriving late to a large gathering, and upon telling several friends this story they said ""Oh my god, this bartender is the worst.

Well one was, one drink was barely drinkable from how strong it was. I don't remember the names, something with a monkey and the other drink  was something like ""said and done""? Regardless, one was really good. My only complain, which is sort of out of the reach of management, is that there was a birthday party that night we went and the bombarded the whole location.

"I went to St. Mazie on Sunday for a brunch with a friend, and my experience is best described as being something that, the opposite of good cheese, got worse the longer it went on, despite starting out very well. The first thing you will be aware of when you go to St. Mazie is how beautiful and precise the interior is. From the furniture, to the stage, to the art, everything about the inside makes you feel like you've immediately been transported somewhere that manages to be both exotic and comforting. Similarly, the wait staff here is generally friendly (bordering on talking a bit too much) and attentive, and they do their best to serve you promptly without rushing you.But the place gets worse with every dish, unfortunately. To start off our meal, my friend and I got cocktails. We both agreed they were decent, but a bit too sweet. These we might order again. After cocktails, I ordered a brunch version of the BLT and my friend ordered a dutch pancake, and both were past a bit too sweet and just straight up cloying. His dutch baby was completely smothered in a fruity syrup, which overwhelmed any other flavor. He might as well just have been fed a bowl of it. My BLT was a hodge podge of unfortunateness, with bacon that might as well have been the pre-cooked Oscar Meyer stuff, poached eggs that were completely cooked through, french toast that was flavorless, and a tomato jam that, again, was so sweet that it overpowered all the other bad components and own the mega-bad ingredient award. Overall, I wanted to like St. Mazie. The atmosphere is great, but the cocktails were mediocre, and neither my friend or I finished are dishes (which is really sad because we're pigs).

"Evidently they have brunch no - who knew?!  The hubby had the breakfast BLT, a decadent French toast with super crispy bacon and poached eggs with tomato compote and spinach.  I had the smoked fish with poached eggs over herbed creme fraiche and potatoes.  Will be coing back just for these dishes!!Server was brand new and a bit slow/pokey; not super attentive, especially because it wasn't too busy.  But we sat in the beautiful back garden, which garners a little less attention, otherwise it would have been a solid 5 stars.  Love this place.  Cozy and romantic for drinks and night, and now obviously for brunch on the weekend.",4.0
Great ambiance to hang out and live music. The live music is a good thing and a bad thing since it tends to be live and you feel rude talking over the music.,4.0
"Well, I think I found my new favorite place in Williamsburg. The place itself is very cozy with some antique decor and lighting reminiscent of the Prohibition era. The food menu has some delicious options, especially the chicken. The special cocktails are very creative and they are made with some tender loving care by the very friendly and accommodating staff here. Will definitely be coming back as often as I can. Highly recommend this place for romantic dates and small group gatherings. They also have small jazz concerts on certain nights!",5.0
"This is a great bar, can't speak to the food but I love the nostalgic feel in this place, it's like stepping back in time.  Great live music most nights, good beer selection, and pretty good cocktails.  Not to mention great service from a friendly staff.",5.0

"Go there.So I got married, and this was the only place i wanted to do it. It's a gorgeous bar, beautiful garden and does great food. The atmosphere is wonderful, definitely made special by the live music. Vanessa and Deanna in there helped us out a lot :) Don;t let the fact that we got married put you off though! We kept it very low key and we just wanted people to have a nice summer evening with great drinks and great food.Love this place. Was special to me before and now will always be remembered. ;)",5.0
"Super cute place! My husband and I stopped in to grab some $1 oysters - yumyumyum! We sat in the garden in the back and got to hang out with the resident doggy, who was a cutie!

"I went to St. Mazie on Sunday for a brunch with a friend, and my experience is best described as being something that, the opposite of good cheese, got worse the longer it went on, despite starting out very well. The first thing you will be aware of when you go to St. Mazie is how beautiful and precise the interior is. From the furniture, to the stage, to the art, everything about the inside makes you feel like you've immediately been transported somewhere that manages to be both exotic and comforting. Similarly, the wait staff here is generally friendly (bordering on talking a bit too much) and attentive, and they do their best to serve you promptly without rushing you.But the place gets worse with every dish, unfortunately. To start off our meal, my friend and I got cocktails. We both agreed they were decent, but a bit too sweet. These we might order again. After cocktails, I ordered a brunch version of the BLT and my friend ordered a dutch pancake, and both were past a bit too sweet and just straight up cloying. His dutch baby was completely smothered in a fruity syrup, which overwhelmed any other flavor. He might as well just have been fed a bowl of it. My BLT was a hodge podge of unfortunateness, with bacon that might as well have been the pre-cooked Oscar Meyer stuff, poached eggs that were completely cooked through, french toast that was flavorless, and a tomato jam that, again, was so sweet that it overpowered all the other bad components and own the mega-bad ingredient award. Overall, I wanted to like St. Mazie. The atmosphere is great, but the cocktails were mediocre, and neither my friend or I finished are dishes (which is really sad because we're pigs). We actually went and got a sandwich right after to split because, despite being hungry, we simply couldn't finish the food.",2.0

"pretty bar in in wburg close to the bqe they've got great music line ups, e.g., my personal favorite - baby soda jazz band on Sundays. and for now, no lines for anything. the decor is really gorgeous - restored, vintage etc. and, lighting is a great dim. good for masking first date nerves",3.0
Great spot for live music and cocktails with a great South Williamsburg vibe.  It's the perfect antidote to the Wythe Hotel.  I'll definitely be back...,5.0
Cute French vibe with nice cocktails. A cheap beer option is the $4 tecate. It's in a bottle so you don't feel like a cheap ass holding a can. Nice! Great lighting with globes and tea lights and also there is are cool pulley system fans that hang from a decorative wooden ceiling. Live music on a little stage in the corner. There's a flowering tree outside with lights on it to help you find it off the beaten path on Grand in Willyburg. Definitely going back!,4.0

They vary between being really crowded and pretty empty, and  I can't decide which I like more.",5.0
Had a wonderful night here last night. The cocktails were perfectly crafted and the vibe of the room (as well as the decor) was perfect. I had some food as well.. the fish board and meat boards were standouts for me. We also this vegetarian focaccia bruschetta thing which was ridiculously good (and I don't usually get super excited over vegetarian stuff). Service was on point too.

"I need to go back. I'm so intrigued; was I in  bar in 1920's Paris? Was I settling down for an evening at a cafe in a post-prohibition New Orleans? Or was I taking in a show in Eastern Europe? All three, In a way.I initially felt like I wasn't ""cool enough"" (i.e. hipsters elite) to be here, but there soon became a large mix of hipsters, average joes, and European clientele to round out a mix of people who seemed to genuinely enjoy the live band playing in the corner. A group of chairs was soon arranged around them, clapping to the accordion, bass, trumpet, and guitar playing before them, seemingly clad in era appropriate clothing. Two patrons started Balkan-style dancing and I immediately wished I wasn't entirely inept in the world of folkloric-dancing. The music wasn't entirely traditional either, drawing influence from blue-grass as well. It was great; I sipped strong, well crafted old fashioneds and manhattans and listened to the music and let the meticulously decorated interior (complete with vintage cooler doors, dim lighting, wavy ceiling, pulley style fans) transport me to someplace else entirely (even of I don't know quite where that place was). I'm docking a star because the bartenders were really pretentious. They have far too much liquor against that wall not to have a drink menu, and I suppose I have to guess what wines they have. Bonus; they do take credit cards for those of us who forgot to hit the ATM before going out.

"If you're in the mood for no fun, this is the place for you! I love spending time with people who have sticks shoved up their ass as much as the next person, but this place really takes the cake. I was reprimanded at this bar for clapping along with live music. Perhaps I danced a little jig, too. Sometimes I can't contain myself, what with being human and enjoying lively tunes. Why would a place have live music if they didn't want people to dance? Dancing and listening to music are age-old customs, dating back before the iphone 5 and snobbery based on looking like an asshole with clothes that look like shit but cost a lot.The owner of this bar, sitting in the back, smelling her own farts, told us that this place was not for fun, but for being 'mellow'.
