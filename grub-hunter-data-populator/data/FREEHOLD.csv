"tl: dr; no cover, super packed, a little bit of wannabe pretentious, wanna be manhattan, and wanna be everything all in one.space is definitely nice! came here for the night scene and ...this place is a mess! what is this place?!?!? there are lounges at the front, with people just watching sports, others just having table service? ... and then there is the tiny dance room in the far right, but people are just standing, the dj spins old school hip hop and r&b, maybe old school top 40s? ... nice outdoor patio for chilling if it wasn't too cold! bartenders are nice, complimentary coat check, and short bathroom lines.",1.0

"I love how many bars are in Williamburg and this one didn't disappoint. I came here for some drinks after having dinner at a nearby restaurant. The place was crowded and the music loud, everyone was having a great time. Since it wasn't too cold we decided to go hang out and the bar there was empty which was great. We got a few drinks while we watched some drunk people play ping pong.",4.0
"No! Stop! Turn away while you still can!Faux-Machismo is on display here and helps answer the question, ""I wonder what happened to my high school ex?"" He's here. He is absolutely here. An American Psycho vibe permeates the place. D-bags in suits walk around adjusting their shirt cuffs, and checking their looks. Guys in their mid-30s prowl. Be careful, all, this is a place where you black out and wake up naked on a stranger's couch. The music is loud, the vibe is pretentious.  Left within minutes. I suggest you steer clear of this tiny dick shit show and go somewhere else. Free coat check was nice.",1.0
"I came here for the nightlife. This place is packed with people so moving around was a bit tricky without pissing off other drunk people.One thing that stood out to me. Since this is a loud place with a DJ, bartenders will have a hard time hearing what you want. I tried ordering a double shot of Jack and Coke and the bartender gave me two shots of Jack Daniels with the check. The bartender was kind and sincere enough to fix my order and also gave me a free shot to make up for the difference in price, which was more than enough. That shot unfortunately was tequila...",4.0
"Am I in Brooklyn or did I somehow transport to Murray Hill? I went on a Saturday night and the place was PACKED with what felt like not a single person who actually lives in Brooklyn. The space itself is nice, it's got a huge outdoor area and multiple rooms to roam around. There's a small DJ booth that was pumping out Top 40's and TVs over the bar playing the football game with almost every person in the room facing them and doing that thing where they scream and cheer at the TV like if they scream loud enough everyone will know they are a real man.In any case, if you're into that kind of thing you will LOVE Freehold. I hear you can come here and work and that they have a cafe, I'll have to be back for the daytime and weeknight activity because as I said, the space itself is great. I just prefer my dives, my disco balls and my Brooklyn neighbors.",3.0
"This place is f*ckin' awesome.Sweet cafe set up in the front, and a wonderland in the back.I wish the menu items were priced a bit lower, but it is fair. This is a great place to lounge, at whatever time of day or week you can afford. Grab a booth with friends or work at the bar, and just soak up the über cool atmosphere. The back room is spacious, decorated expertly in a mix of modern styles with a 70's color palette, I love it intensely. I can speak for the granola rolla and coffee, both of which are excellent. Cannot wait for the weather to turn to hang out in their large patio area.",5.0

"The best part about FREEHOLD, especially in comparison to other Brooklyn coffee shops, is the comfort of the space. I quickly got tired or the wooden and metallic decor and seating of Brooklyn coffee shops. While the lines, simplicity and space are very clean and visually appealing, the style is a zero in comfort. I like my coffee shops with couches and FREEHOLD had several. It was still well decorated and fresh, but the comfort made me want to whistle while I worked. The cold brew was Stumptown, so very smooth and tasty. My only complaint is water is not readily available and the cups are small, so I had to keep bugging for more.",4.0

Its not too crowded, it had a huge outdoor area, and huge indoor space, room for the sitters, room for the dancers, and room for the gamers in the back. Great artwork too!

Even better than that, on Wednesday's you'll find yourself sipping $4.50 cocktails.I suggest the St. George. You fancy! Wait, WHAT? Yes, it's true - no it's not a dive bar, and yes they are good. They have a daily happy hour from 5 - 8 and other specials throughout the week.My thoughts on the food:The chicken fingers are light and crispy.The burger is solid, so are the fries.If you're feeling extra special, go truffle fries. Don't look back.Even the small side salad I had was fresh, and delightful.I'm not going to lie, I haven't had anything else because I've ordered these same items multiple times but I have a hunch, everything is equally well done.Don't forget if you're not feeling a bar day or night, this place is a hybrid -- grab a cold brew and book instead in the cafe area and cozy up for a coffee date, with your book or with a friend.PS: They have CAH.

The burger is bursting with eclectic flavor and melts in your mouth. Fries - perfect.  Pickle back shots were delightful. They serve bourbon like it deserves to be served, one Large ice cube surrounded by bourbon. I wouldn't have it any other way. The server was attentive and accommodating.

"Apologies for the half ass photos, we couldn't contain our excitement and started to devour the heavenly eatables immediately. Tuna tar tar hit the spot.The cod is served in an exquisite soubise sauce.  The lobster roll was great and we used the remains of the roll to absorb the  rest of the mouthwatering soubise sauce, I desperately wanted to lick the the plate dry, but my friend advised against it and said it's frowned upon at restaurants. The burger is bursting with eclectic flavor and melts in your mouth. Fries - perfect.  Pickle back shots were delightful. They serve bourbon like it deserves to be served, one Large ice cube surrounded by bourbon. I wouldn't have it any other way. The server was attentive and accommodating. Pool tables and corn hole and arcades. Good Music. God bless you Freehold, for I will be inside you sooner than you think.",5.0
"The bartender was all sorts of hot, she had this little skimpy outfit on that got me and the boys hella pumped up. Free shots for everybody. This place was like a f****** dream come true. You had the hipster girls dressed up like they work in a coal mine. Then you got the people with tattoos all over their bodies looking like barbarian warlords. Needless to say, I'm f****** coming back to this b**** and I'm bringin the whole squad. Aight peace.",5.0
"4.5I love this place!  First of all, it's huge!!!  There's so much room everywhere, but not in an awkward way.  It has an outdoor section with ping pong and other games, along with a full bar.  The inside also has a full bar, tables, and the dance floor.  It was a lot of fun!  The DJ was playing some 90's music, which was really great.  I'll definitely be back.",4.0
"Coffee wise:Amazing latte. Amazing service. Amazing interior (and exterior). Bar wise:How many bars do you know that encourage you to use your laptop while drinking beer and having an amazing burger? Charging stations right underneath the bar table.Fun wise:Outdoor seating with table tennis, arcades and more. Seriously. Did I mention hey also have arcades room?Definitely a huge Williamsburg gem!",5.0

"I work at Arrojo a hair salon not to fair from Freehold and the staff and I absolutely love it! I think they have $1 oysters on Tuesdays (if I'm not mistaken) and they are so yummy! Also, the same day they have $5 wines choices! 2 glasses of wine and 10 oysters for $26....can't beat it!! Can't wait to try more things over there!Plus the staff is awesome and so polite!",5.0

"This place is awesome!! Went last night for a surprise birthday; it was my first visit but I'll be back. The Good: the music is diverse and perfect for a chill party vibe; the food is traditional American fare e.g. Burgers, fries, lobster rolls that gets the job done; they have a gaming space with foosball and a PHOTO BOOTH to memorialize your epic night; there's also an outdoor garden area to sip and sit on a nice nightThe Bad: the drinks are weak and our bartender didn't know how to make a White Russian.

"This is an amazing space, a huge airy indoor area with mid-century furniture along with a big outdoor yard with games. The downside is the clientele.

It's a perfect place to work during the day or to meet up for one of their weeknight & weekend specials including $1 oysters, $10 burger & a beer ...but the regular menu is already reasonable. Panels behind the bar slide open to flat screen TVs and I noticed there's a screen and projector as well so it's good to watch sports. They play good music in general and on weekend nights they get a good dancing crowd and have DJs playing mostly hip hop and pop...my only complaint is that the DJs aren't really that great...sorry!

"Interesting to see so many good reviews on here. Wasn't my experience. Wanted to love this place. Cool idea, low price point etc. But I've been twice now and the drinks are awful, service atrocious, and the food is mediocre with even simple dishes missing the mark. The pimento cheese for example is really sad. Whoever made this version has never been down South. It was dry and inedible.We were also put off by how dirty the space was. We were sat in a booth that had a thick layer of dust on the shelf, as in, it hadn't been cleaned for days. Rookie stuff. Needless to say, I didn't order the tuna tartare. If you can't clean your restaurant you probably aren't handling the food with much care either.Lastly, the crowd. This joint is like a poor man's Soho House for the Murray Hill set. Add the Williamsburg element and the douchery increases. All in all a major misfire with good intentions. Hopefully it will improve because the space and idea is great.",2.0

This Cali boy will definitely come back to the freehold! This place is lively and crowded in a good way. The drinks are flowing and the bartenders are knowledgeable and some how are able to handle the sea of customers. This place gets pretty pact at around 10 however everyone seemed to be quite friendly and having a good time.

"I came here last night for a birthday party and loved it! It has a huge indoor space with lots of little lounge areas but more importantly a great outdoor space with ping pong and corn hole. Great drinks (definitely try the Ferris Mueller), really nice service, really good food, and the perfect place to relax with a big group. There seemed to be a lot of birthdays/larger gatherings. A little off the beaten path, which is nice too!",4.0
"I was fully prepared to hate this place, the website makes it seem like a hipster haven. Where you can work and play in the cheesiest way. It kind of is, but the booze make up for it. We got there around 6, and kinda roamed for a bit. They are two entrances and the name isn't  on either one. But we made our way to the outdoor space, which is huge, with a ping pong table in the center, and a green space loaded with pillows in a corner. The place is so huge, and you can get waiter service anywhere. This got a slightly annoying as the place got more crowed, and it was harder to find a waitress. They have a happy hour until 8pm that makes all the drinks half off, bringing them down to around 5-6 bucks. After 8 all the wine was only 5 dollars(on Tuesdays). This bargain plus a beautiful night under the stars, with pretty chill crowd gives this place 4 stars.  I took on star away because the food was very limited, what they do have is good. The Craw fish Mac and Cheese is great but to small of a portion to be really enjoyable. My friend loved the egg sandwich, and my burger was ok. This place is well worth a visit!",4.0
"They have hula hoops, bags (aka corn hole), ping pong and margaritas. What more can you ask for? I had an awesome Sunday Funday here -- sat outside on the faux grass and hula hooped in the summer sunshine. It is the perfect way to spend a weekend. Can't wait to come back!",5.0
"Came here for a party yesterday, what a gorgeous venue and location, located right near the Williamsburg Bridge, with great views, great service, great drinks and great food. The outside area is pretty nice, with artificial grass and an open space, complete with a bar and ping pong. There is also a game room inside, towards the back. The food is pretty good, I got the cheeseburger with fries, the burger was juicy and the fries were made just right. Drinks are good and reasonable, I get the frozen margarita at the outside bar, SO GOOD! Service is good. The only thing is the bouncers have an attitude, so be wary of that.",4.0
"Interesting to see so many good reviews on here. Wasn't my experience. Wanted to love this place. Cool idea, low price point etc. But I've been twice now and the drinks are awful, service atrocious, and the food is mediocre with even simple dishes missing the mark. The pimento cheese for example is really sad. Whoever made this version has never been down South. It was dry and inedible.We were also put off by how dirty the space was. We were sat in a booth that had a thick layer of dust on the shelf, as in, it hadn't been cleaned for days. Rookie stuff. Needless to say, I didn't order the tuna tartare. If you can't clean your restaurant you probably aren't handling the food with much care either.Lastly, the crowd. This joint is like a poor man's Soho House for the Murray Hill set. Add the Williamsburg element and the douchery increases. All in all a major misfire with good intentions. Hopefully it will improve because the space and idea is great.",2.0
"I could see myself getting up to 5 stars after a few more visits.  Nice staff.  Great coffee bar.  Cold brew on nitro.  Plenty of places to hang out.  Wifi didn't work, but I never really depend on wifi.  Everything you could ask for at this place: drinks, coffee, food, TVs, plenty of seating, in door and outdoor.  It's like hanging out at a hotel or resort...prices are more reasonable though.",4.0
Just okay. Why is the photo booth cash or credit BUT (a) the credit card swipey thing doesn't work and (b) the cash slot doesn't give change? Oh and the foosball table only takes quarters. These are the mysteries of the universe..,3.0
This Cali boy will definitely come back to the freehold! This place is lively and crowded in a good way. The drinks are flowing and the bartenders are knowledgeable and some how are able to handle the sea of customers. This place gets pretty pact at around 10 however everyone seemed to be quite friendly and having a good time. The food was also great the crawfish mac and cheese was amazing and I would recommend it to any new comers.

"When I walked into this bar space I was amazed by how specious and incredibly chic this bar/cafe was. I brought in a least 6 friends that are are native to the area and they loved the decour! One thing we didn't enjoy were the men hooking up in the bathroom. Is this a gay pick up spot? Me and my fiancé had two different experiences while walking into the restroom for a quick piss. The other thing we didn't enjoy was the sassy mouthed red head manager that told my fiancé to get his eyes checked when he couldn't see something written on the board above him. After we ordered our first round of drinks, we proceeded to order another and at that point we somehow lost the interest of the bartenders all together at a time that bar was not crowded at all. Our bartender was the red headed slick mouthed manager but he then walked off to check the floor(which I understand) but no one covered his corner for a while. We then asked a new girl to close Us out after being annoyed for waiting so long with the other bartenders. She ignored us of course and continued about her business. Then another guy noticed us and started talking crap to us about the new mean girl, and saying she's not handling her area correctly; but never asked us if we wanted a drink. We told him who our bartender was and he told us, "" well... can't talk bad about him... He's my manager."" At that point I asked him to close me out for the 3rd time and I was out of there. It's very unfortunate that the service was horrible because I really enjoyed the space. Probably won't be going back there for a while until they've got their staff up to speed. I'll just continue to hang out at kin folk for now, now those guys are some down to earth people and the music is always different. Happy drinking!",3.0
"I can't speak to the café's charms (although apparently the Times can, and they say its the best in Brooklyn), but I will tell you that the bar is AMAZING. One of the more incredible spaces I've been in...HUGE space for dancing (very good DJ on Fri night) if you're into that. If you're not, there's a game room. If you're an outdoorsman, you should probably leave New York, but there's a massive outdoor space in Williamsburg with Freehold's name on it. There's a lounge space  just off the main dance floor for private dance parties. In truth, I'm not sure if that's what it's for, but that's what we did in there. Any vibe you want, this bar has it. The owners even chatted with us; they plan on doing comedy nights and crawfish boils in the future, among many other things.Servers were friendly and attentive, so the drinks were as plentiful as they were affordable. $9 cocktails and $4 beers, and those weren't even the specials!

"This weekend I had the chance to try their new restaurant menu for the expanded complex they've got going - I've always loved the coffee shop so was cool to see the expansion.The food was excellent - the cheeseburger was tender and flavorful, the heirloom tomato salad was fresh perfect for summer.  I also tried the crawfish mac and cheese.  I really liked that too though I am generally not a fan of crawfish/lobster/crab etc. The service was spotty but kind, but not going to fault them because it was the 4th and there was a lot going on.  As far as the social aspect of this place, the vibe here is a nice blend of not-too-trendy and not-too-douchey and if they can toe this line wisely by curating the right djs/etc., keep it somewhat local and not appeal to a bunch of bros, then I'm looking forward to spending more time here in the future.",5.0

I even got to chat with the owners, super down-to-earth guys who are very passionate about the place, and they plan on hosting comedy nights and other events in the near future. If I lived in Williamsburg, I would be here several times a week, no question.",5.0
"Not only do I live a block away from this place, it's one of the best places around! It offers everything you would ever imagine to keep you and your date happy. Games, great food, awesome cocktails and specials almost every day. Freehold, don't ever change",5.0
"Dropped in on a recent trip, place is huge! Outdoor space is clutch.  Great place for day drinks.",5.0
"Loving the new lobby bar. Went for the first time last night, and everyone was incredibly nice. The environment was a ton of fun in a beautiful space. Their drinks are good, their food is great, and the company you keep there is the best. Will definitely return ASAP.",5.0
"If you're looking for an authentic LES experience without traveling too far from the comfort of your new construction luxury loft, freehold is the place for you! It has everything: long bathroom lines, 23 year olds dancing on tables, bouncers with self esteem problems and FIREBALL SHOTS! Immediately on entering you are whisked away to a magical world of guys posturing on the dancefloor, elbow jockeying for bar position and FIREBALL SHOTS! All this set to the soundtrack of some random guy's MacBook Pro set on shuffle.",1.0
"This place makes nice coffee (but could be hotter, so make sure to tell the barista if you like it hot). Beautiful atmosphere right infront of the Williamsburg Bridge. Great leather chairs, fast wifi and good service.",5.0
Awesome place.  Now the back yard is open.  You can relax     Play a game of ping pong.   The food is off the hook.   The dirty egg sandwich is just delicious.,5.0
Large space that caters at all times of day. On Thursday I was working in the cafe area. Great stumptown coffee and music to go with it. Later on came back in for the half price off bar happy hour only to find that the special that night was 2$ drafts. 10 out of 10 for the delivery in such a large space!,5.0

"The best coffee shop in Williamsburg. Small, inviting, plenty of plugs and good wifi. The coffee is also excellent and they have a number of new food offerings as well. Don't tell too many people, though. I don't want it to become too crowded.",5.0
"I love those large windows. Great light, ambiance. Close to the bridge and water, there's a peacefulness here that I really liked, until one of the guys at the register shortchanged me. I called him out, and he seemed embarrassed as he handed the dollar that was rightfully mine, mine, mine. I took it and put it into the tip jar, though, because I couldn't help but pity him. If you're that hungry for a dollar, then eat it, I thought.I'm not mad but that pretty much killed it for me, so I'm not going back there, not for a while anyway. Anyhow, I don't want to base my review on that possibly isolated incident.Pros: like I said, ambiance, an easy vibe. The sandwiches are decent and you can get them warmed up. There are plenty of plugs / outlets. Wifi works smoothly. Cons:There isn't a lot of seating, and it can quickly feel cramped. If you're looking for a place to flap your elbows like a chicken, because you are just one of those people who is unapologetically your annoying self, don't come here.",4.0
"Welp, secret's out. On Fridays and Saturdays Freehold is your typical Murray Hill bar with slightly nicer clothing. Strictly a weekday-only spot.",2.0
"I have been to Freehold for birthdays, for brunch, for dinner, for oyster night, for dancing, or for just a random evening of drinks and games, and every time the waitresses, the owners, and the bartenders go above and beyond to make sure our experience is nothing less than sublime. The food... Have you guys tried the dirty egg sandwich?? Yummm and then there's the burger, the chicken fingers, or the pork sandwich. All hits in my book. This place has great music, corn hole, ping pong, Buck hunter, tvs for those fellas looking to catch a sports game, and the afternoon coffee/laptop crew. This place has something for everyone. Love it here..I'll continue coming back. Have yet to check out comedy night or yoga so those are the next boxes I will be checking off.",5.0
"Great spot! Everything you want out a coffee shop and the back is opening soon. They let me go check it out one day - the neighborhood is in for a real treat. Looks like a hotel back there! Stoked they're in the neighborhood. Can't wait to see it go off this summer, should be the new place to be in south bill burg",5.0
Den is such a welcome addition to my neighborhood! They're brewing stump town and they have a great selection of juice as well. Open at 7 am which makes it part of the morning routine.Looking forward to seeing the expansion....,5.0
Really good DJ's at night thank GAWD.  Good people there too - my friend left her wallet in the bathroom on accident and someone returned it to the front desk!  Really great outdoor space also.,5.0

"I wish  I could give below a 1 star. I had a really good time, but I went for my friends birthday and they changed me double on my credit card. When I called in they told me that this has been happening to a lot of people over the weekend and cannot give me my money back. CRAZY! Sure let me just steal from you and a bunch of your friends and show no remorse. Disgusting.",1.0
"This coffee shop is so amazing! Cold press juices....My daily routine. When they opened the bar and restaurant.... Soy blown away! Lol. I'm not even Latin but..love it! Brice is really nice and one time I was waiting for my check a bit too long, he noticed and came over with a free round of wine. Soy sweet! Highly recommend - my first stop whenever I go over that dirty river.",5.0
"Cool space- like the layout a lot!  Went in the evening but seems like it would be a nice coffee shop to do work in. Lots of different spaces to get a change of pace!  There's cornhole in the loft which is lots of fun, not too crazy lines to play!",5.0

"Popped in here during my first trip to Williamsburg. Pretty cool place, it feels like a hotel lobby or something. Also has big outdoor space. Good was good, drinks were reasonable - what more do you want? Can confirm: will return.",5.0
"Great new spot, with a very well thought out space and vibe. It's growing, and the owner operators are constantly learning about what works for the cafe and the area. So be nice, everyone is lovely here.The only thing I would say that needs improvement is the assignment of designated laptop free areas. Nothing worse than seeing a beautiful open window area, ruined by space eating laptop junkies on a weekend. Seriously these kids need to disconnect! (the back wall is perfect for that though)If the Den can shake it's laptop LAN party  vibe, it'd certainly be a great community spot with an awesome cafe culture. Going to be a repeat weekend visitor here. thanks guys, and well done!",4.0

"These guys do NOT know how to make coffee. I asked for a latte that was served to me cold...  the ""barista"" didn't really know how to use the machine and looked almost scared when the milk started bubbling... Basically I had a big cup of milk with a light coffee flavor. When I when out, a lady that was served before me asked me if my coffee was cold too, so I guess I was not the exception. The place itself is OK, work is apparently still in progress... Only thing that bugged me is that it looks like those places that want to be everything at the same time, but end up having no personality in the end...From what I understood the owners are a group of guys, so it looks like they poured out everything each of them liked in one space. Too many cooks in the kitchen! Less is more! They should start with learning how to make coffee first.",1.0

"So this place has a lot of potential, which is why I'm giving it 4 stars.  And this part of the neighborhood needs a legit coffee spot.  They basically just do stumptown coffee and outsource all their baked goods, which is pretty obvious and doesn't make it very tempting to buy anything.  they do have plans to get a proper kitchen going, at which time we'll really see what this place is all about.  The elevated space is nice in theory, but I just don't see a lot of people hanging out up there.  One of those things that looks better in a picture than in real life.  For my money, sweetleaf up the street has far better coffee at a lower price.",4.0
"Brand new place and Im not all that surprised to see the really negative review about espresso drinks ... But I went for filter coffee and it was excellent. They are brewing Stumptown and open at 7am and that does it for me! If you're into iced coffee they also have a Stumptown cold brew on tap! Like a beer! The guy was very friendly and gave me a sample of it. The pastries and muffins looked totally unappealing  so I had to go elsewhere for my breakfast which was disappointing. Also, take note, there's a half flight of stairs up to the seating area so not stroller friendly. So a number of potential draw backs but if you want an excellent hot filter coffee at 7am with your baby in your Ergo you're all set! Enjoy!",4.0
