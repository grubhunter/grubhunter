"Rye is our neighborhood go-to for just about any gathering. Friends in town? Take them to Rye. Family in town? Take them to Rye. Hungry for a good meal? Go to Rye. Craving a perfect cocktail? Go to Rye. You really can't go wrong here. The food is fantastic, the cocktails amazing, the staff quirky and the ambiance cozy. Now, I have to admit, I have a hard time trying anything new when I go, because quite frankly, I'm addicted to the meatloaf sandwich. It is SO GOOD. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. But everything I've had was delicious. Oh, definitely start with the brussel sprouts. You won't regret it.",5.0
"I would rate Rye four and a half stars.I started with the scotch egg. The crispiness of the scotch egg and the creaminess of the mornay sauce were high points of the dish; it amplified textural contrast between the egg and ground beef with the crispy exterior. In addition to the textural contrast, I also like how the bacon and the frisee expanded the flavor profile of the dish. For my main entree, I had the Porcini and Parsley Pappardelle. Like the appetizer, the entree exhibited a wide ranging flavor profiles. It was a quite a hearty and earth dish which was manifested by the porcini mushrooms, tender beef chunks, and the parsley leaves.The pappardelle was absorbent and adopted the essence of the dish.For dessert, we split the molten chocolate cake with pistachio ice cream. Like the other dish, contrast was a huge impetus in the dish. This time it was the contrast between the hot molten cake and the cold pistachio ice cream. The cake was decadent and the ice cream was creamy. It was a very rich dish.The service at Rye was superb. The entire staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and accommodating. It was refreshing to experience such exquisite service.",4.0
"Great spot!!!Friendly atmosphere, good service and tasty food. Ceviche, pickle platter, and the warm chocolate cake with pistachio ice cream are a must. Will be back for more, parking is horrible so be prepared to walk Keep living, keep eating.",4.0
"Great delicious food. Oddly, menu is still set to a Fall cuisine. I asked the server why that is, but he had no idea - Fall Ravioli, really? 3 seasons ago guys. But still, food is great - the duck was outstanding, as was the braised short rib.",4.0
"Elegant and moody interior perfect for a date night especially if your date likes wine and cheese.  Came here a few weeks ago and had a nice dinner, we shared the cheese plate which came with a few interesting sides such as pickled watermelon and a delicious homemade jam.The plate is enough for a tasting between two and the cocktails they serve are also top notch. I ordered their version of a gin and tonic and loved it.( I would have also ordered their pickle plate but apparently I was the only pickle lover at the table!) For entrees they have a few classics and nothing really stood out to me so I stuck with the fall ravioli which was filled with butternut squash and severed on a mushroom broth. It was nicely presented but I have had much better versions right in Williamsburg. My date ordered the pork belly and he said it was tender but would have liked a bigger portion for the price. I mean..who wouldn't? We enjoyed everything we ate but three still isn't anything that made me go ""wow that was good"" like I usually do at places that are this highly rated.   I'm giving Rye a downgrade only because they could have more options on their menu especially for people who are tired of seeing pork belly and brisket everywhere. The restaurant has amazing potential to do so much more since you can tell the food is made either care.",3.0
"Great place, dark, castle, cold looking but great american food. Ready to jump to the bar downstairs. Happy hour drinks + burger are a must",4.0
"My dinner mates came from Manhattan and raved the whole time about how amazing the food was. I have to agree that the Brussels sprouts, duck and ceviche were all top notch. The Brussels were caked with Parmesan and cooked to perfection- slightly charred, still soft and melt in your mouth goodness.  I got a nice sized portion of duck (had to bring half home), whereas normal nyc duck portions could be only a few bites. We also had ceviche and it was flavorful with several kinds of seafood (shrimp, scallops, octopus and fish) plus grapefruit and mild spices. The banana split was huge, with 3 kinds of ice cream, caramelized bananas and toasted pecans. My only complaint is that the banana wasn't totally ripe :(. The donuts are hot, crispy and soft in the middle and went really well with the ice cream. We had cinnamon and vanilla.We had awesome drinks here. If u like a Manhattan or and old fashioned, this is a good choice for you. I can see why Rye is a popular choice outside of ""mainstream"" Williamsburg.",4.0
"Their is absolutely nothing wrong with this establishment.  NOTHING.  I was in a rush and was told to pick the meet up spot and picked Rye from a  lazy google search and went along with it. I had no idea what I was getting into.  Immediately the ambiance put me at ease.  It's a great place to meet up with friends or with a date.  It's not too loud or too quiet and the lighting is just perfect, and the setting is so quaint.  Our server was polite, down to earth, and attentive to our needs.  Additionally other servers took the time to make sure we were well taken care of as well.  We ordered drinks, an entree, and dessert.  All of our orders were made to perfection.  I honestly have nothing negative to say about this place. It will not disappoint.  My experience was so lovely I plan to return VERY soon and VERY often.",5.0
"Rye has a very comfortable atmosphere and overall great service. A great place for friends (larger tables) or romantic date. Food was tasty, with a classic new American menu- fancy Brussels sprouts, Mac n cheese, prime rib, etc. We started off with the Brussels sprouts which were very good and covered in bacon fat. I had the meatloaf sandwich. The meat and bbq-type sauce was very flavorful and the toasted bread (ciabatta I think) held up well. There was also a side of pickled vegetables that complimented the sandwich. They also had a nice drink selection. Had a taste of my friend's old fashioned (with some nice aged whiskey, so I was told) and it was pretty strong.",4.0
"Had a lovely experience here last Sunday morning/early afternoon for brunch. Party of 3, seated right away. We were all hungover so it was appreciated that water glasses were filled immediately and constantly. Also enjoyed a good ""cup of Joe"" and a mimosa made with fresh squeezed orange juice. We ALL ordered the Rye Benedict after seeing it brought out to another table. Pork belly eggs Benedict served over a homemade soft biscuit with perfect poached eggs and hollandaise sauce with some greens and a fried potato cake on the side. The pork belly melted in your mouth - hangover gone. Perfect brunch - ready for round 2!",4.0

"Came here with my boyfriend for an anniversary dinner and it's one of my best Brooklyn dining experiences so far.We started with a three-month barrel aged Old Fashioned, a special that evening, which had a very complex, deep flavor and the Diablero, a sweet and smooth tequila cocktail.We had six oysters, which came with horseradish as well as cocktail sauce, a welcome addition, and presented beautifully.Out entree was the duck breast with greens and cous cous, which was cooked perfectly--so tender and such a great flavor.

"Everything about the restaurant is fantastic. If I had to recommend dinner or brunch in South Williamsburg this would be it. The only reason I do not frequent it more often is that is is pricey - but oh so worth it. First off Dinner. Simply put it is amazing. I have only been once for a full spread but the food was delicious, the service impeccable, and the presentation was beyond reproach. I had a short rib special and my friend had the meatloaf sandwich (somewhat of a staple here) and both were fantastic. We had one drink each and dinner after tax and tip was pushing $200. Brunch. This not the most inventive brunch you can get in Brooklyn. It is very old school, very standard and does not take a lot of risks. However if you want the definitive Benedict, look no further. Everything is amazing. Get here early, there is a line at 11am on Sundays and the dining room is packed to the gills by noon. Happy hour. For happy hour you get a killer cheeseburger and an old fashioned for $10. The burger is a small double cheeseburger on a fresh bun with ooey-gooey neon yellow cheese and is everything I want in a burger. The Old fashioned isn't the best I have ever had but it is still top tier. For some added calories add the crinkle cut fries, but note that will add about 50% to your tab.

"While I've had a drink at the bar in the restaurant, this review is mainly for Bar Below Rye, which is a secret gem. I've headed down there as a first stop or for last call with friends, and the DJ is always playing great soul and disco jams. The bartenders are beyond friendly and generous with their pours. They currently have an amazing rose on the wine list that I dream about (yes way rose). Crowd is usually Manhattan types crossing over for dinner/drinks, and a few solo diners and pairs on dates, Bar Below Rye has more of an upscale vibe but not pretentious at all. As far as the food menu goes I've only ordered fries--the perfect drinking food--but I'm sure you can't go wrong. One night I'm getting that burger.",4.0
"Loved the biscuits. Get them. Get enough for the table or else fights will ensue! The brunch cocktails are small for the price ($11 for a 8oz cocktail), but I can't complain too much because they were absolutely amazing.

"This was my second trip to Rye in 8 months. While I was surprised to see that menu was the same (at least to the best of my recollection), it's a great little place. Savory, hearty dishes including pork belly and short rib are delicious. The scotch egg was very tasty as well--served with bacon accompanying the egg. The egg itself was hard boiled, and I'm used to a more runny yolk in a scotch egg. But, everything was delicious and the service was friendly and great both times I was there. The best kept secret is their downstairs bar, which has $5 burgers and $5 Old Fashioneds from 4-7 pm. And Dan the bartender is a cool dude.",5.0

A must get!Mac & Cheese - Great flavor and consistency. Salty crunchy cheesy top adds great bite to the macaroni which also has big bites of bacon.Meatloaf sandwich - The meatloaf was so tender. Also great consistency and flavor - salty fried onions with sweet bbq sauce. At first I thought I might need a condiment because it looked like it might be dry but it wasn't at all. Eggs Benny with Pork Belly - Perfectly cooked eggs and esp love it bc its on a biscuit - way better than english muffin Rye Slam - everything was goodBloody Mary - ok - no horseradish or pepper, sweetish like ketchup",4.0
"Four and a half stars, downstairs bar review. I saw the name scrawled on a sign pointing from the main street and my liver knew we had to stop in. DJ rolled in around 9 with an excellent playlist that spanned genres faster than you can empty your glass. Dan's a proper bartender, diligent in his expertise. No signal underground, but they compensate with tasty bar food and cocktails, armed with a solid spread of booze to mix with. Looks like most of the flavors echo the upstairs restaurant.Rye Stirred was deliciously balanced, I ended up returning to it all night between shots. Scotch egg was solid, good crust and generously dressed over a bed of frisee. Smoked pork belly sandwich rocked the perfect meat-to-bread ratio, reminiscent of banh mi. Short rib & cheese sandwich was a decadent premium version of a grilled cheese, buttered toast and all. The proteins in both were crazy tender and the pickles on the side kept them from being too rich. I'm not usually a sweets person, but the pistachio element in their banana split won me over. I'll definitely be hitting up this dimly lit Williamsburg gem every visit.",5.0
Amazing dishes.   Fun atmosphere.  /meatloaf sandwich lives up to the rep.,5.0
Brooklyn comfort food. A very pleasant meal in an attractive setting. The cocktails are well balanced and tasty. The scotch egg is our favorite appetizer. The short rib is also very good and goes well with the horseradish mashed potatoes.,4.0
"While I've had a drink at the bar in the restaurant, this review is mainly for Bar Below Rye, which is a secret gem. I've headed down there as a first stop or for last call with friends, and the DJ is always playing great soul and disco jams. The bartenders are beyond friendly and generous with their pours. They currently have an amazing rose on the wine list that I dream about (yes way rose). Crowd is usually Manhattan types crossing over for dinner/drinks, and a few solo diners and pairs on dates, Bar Below Rye has more of an upscale vibe but not pretentious at all. As far as the food menu goes I've only ordered fries--the perfect drinking food--but I'm sure you can't go wrong. One night I'm getting that burger.",4.0
"Loved the biscuits. Get them. Get enough for the table or else fights will ensue! The brunch cocktails are small for the price ($11 for a 8oz cocktail), but I can't complain too much because they were absolutely amazing. They took reservations, weren't so crowded that you couldn't relax, and are centrally located in Williamsburg. Very much worth the trip from Manhattan.",5.0
"This was my second trip to Rye in 8 months. While I was surprised to see that menu was the same (at least to the best of my recollection), it's a great little place. Savory, hearty dishes including pork belly and short rib are delicious. The scotch egg was very tasty as well--served with bacon accompanying the egg. The egg itself was hard boiled, and I'm used to a more runny yolk in a scotch egg. But, everything was delicious and the service was friendly and great both times I was there. The best kept secret is their downstairs bar, which has $5 burgers and $5 Old Fashioneds from 4-7 pm. And Dan the bartender is a cool dude.",5.0
Foods amazing but the waiter Chris sucks. Literally dropped menus on our table and made me search through them when I asked for a drink menu. Get over yourself chris.,2.0
"We came for Thanksgiving prix fix, my wife has missed out on too many hot Thanksgiving meals and seen us finish eating when she was just beginning to eat; so we went out and we were very pleased with the results.The atmosphere is cool, the service is on point and quality (preparation, presentation and ingredients) of food exceeded our expectations. We're now interested in checking out their non-holiday fare.Rye executed well and we had a great time but they need to share the 5 stars with my Wife since this was her idea.",5.0

"This was my second time at Rye. The first time being during lunch. I think I enjoyed coming at lunch time more. The ambiance is great - it's intimate, cute, cozy. 90% of the dinner menu contained bacon - however there are no issues with having the dishes without - for vegetarians. The Brussel sprouts were cooked well and flavorful. The Mac and cheese came out piping hot and had a good taste once cool enough to be edible. I've had the meatloaf sandwich twice and this time I wasn't blown away like I was the first. I felt the sweet bbq sauce on it overwhelmed the great taste of the meatloaf and the fried onions were way too salty. I've tried the vanilla crème brûlée and it was the best I've had. The waitstaff were knowledgeable and the bartenders are great. Try an old fashioned - they make them well with a large cube of ice. Around 8pm it did get quite busy.",4.0

The bartender was super attentive but also left us to our conversation. Since no other customers were at the restaurant that early, it was a pretty special experience since we really got to enjoy the rustic and speakeasy atmosphere of the restaurant. For dinner, I decided on the duck while my friend had the braised short ribs, both were cooked to perfection. We also shared the cauliflower gratin, amazing. All around solid comfort food.",5.0

"The best thing about Rye is its old time-y intimate vibe.  It feels old-school vintage-y rich and fancy but still BK. It was Friday night-ish and the place had a nice buzz to it: my boyfriend and I sat at the bar and waited for a table (table for 2 next to the door? no thanks, ill wait.)We got seated in the back and although we were close to other couples, we didn't care because whatever, it's NY. or BK. whatever.Our server was....definitely spacey. like, she ate a space cake and then came to work.  She was fine just odd. Didn't mess up the order so that was good!We got the brussel sprouts and 1/2 organic chicken and we each got a beer (I had an old fashioned at the bar and MAN, them thangs is strong)the chicken was so good! Not like in a crazy way where it was TANGY or super sweet but just some good ol' fashioned chicken. Felt healthy. the brussel sprouts were really yummy too. The food felt real and well-made.  I am a girl who puts buffalo sauce and honey mustard on everything, so simple is usually not my thing but it felt good to be eating so ""whole-some...ly.""Then we went outside and down the steps to their 'speakeasy' type bar and THAT place was great! We got a little table in the back, and the whole vibe was candle lit and swanky but in a pub way. Really nice.So I say, go for the vibes, feel healthy eating the food, and def check out the downstairs bar!",4.0
"An excellent experience at Rye! Finally got a chance to try this place and it made me sad that I waited so long. It is beautifully decorated with dark wood and low lighting. The ambiance is welcoming both to large groups and more intimate parties. I highly recommend the 'Rye Stirred' cocktail with its notes of absinthe. I didn't know what to order as I looked around other patron's plates and thought everything looked amazing. I ordered the pork belly and it was delicious, very skillfully put together and well developed dish. Others in my party ordered the duck and raved about it.

"Old fashioned old fashions - served perfect without calling them so.A brunch visit in early May allowed us to sample several plates. Rye Benedict was not as impressive as may be desired. Tiny pieces of pork belly on tiny muffins. My best guess also says that the hollandaise was whipped with a beater? Scotch eggs prepared as expected with a thick cheese sauce atop bacon. A bit dry, the sausage is fried for too long. Pork belly itself!! Thick luscious slices of marbled heaven. Wow. And more manhattans.",4.0

"I am one of those who ended up at Rye at the behest of a friend who became somewhat incoherent describing their meatloaf sandwich.  I was to discover there's more to like at this all-around excellent neighborhood restaurant.Decor is masculine, yet accessible.  Channels old-fashioned saloon, with sleek dark-wood furniture and columns, very dim lighting at night.  Their oft-noted cocktails can be had at their comfortable bar, or to accompany the very good food menu, which is trim, diverse, and appealing.  The food skews toward hearty, the style New American, with inspirations and ingredients both international and local.  A prix fix three-course meal is also offered.Rye's famed meatloaf sandwich, listed under their ""Favorites"" section, is truly marvelous.  Arguably, I'm already biased, being fond of meatloaf, meatballs, and the like, but this beauty was decadent, succulent, and a flavor bomb.  Rye makes the meatloaf with a quartet of meats (beef, veal, pork, duck), and sandwiches a huge hunk of it between crusty bread, crispy buttermilk fried onions, and lettuce smothered in a creamy sauce.  The experience of eating it is hard to describe, although blissful works.  So good was it that I've had it (or at least a slice of it) at every visit, and I rarely repeat entrees.The rest of the food selection is not to be overshadowed.  Rye has a lot of good food options, well-prepared and flavored.  Fried brussels sprouts, showered in shaved parmesan, is an especial highlight.  The four cheese Mac and cheese sports a nice char and never-can-be-wrong bacon.  Grilled shrimp and scallop kebab was perfectly cooked and served with a refreshing, tart tomato salad.  Scotch egg one-ups the classic preparation with a crispy panko crust, coming pre-sliced in two with a delicious cheese sauce.  The single disappointment I can recall was a fried chicken on special that was dry and somewhat lacking in flavor, although the crust was delicious and the accompanying mashed potatoes fluffy, buttery, and addictive.Despite the cocktail rep, I've more often had beers.  Their cocktails are a good price for Brooklyn, and I'd consider it worthwhile to enjoy one at the bar with a few small plates.  Also a good list of spirits and wines.Rye is a great place for drinks and food.  The ambience is laid-back and service friendly.  And that meatball sandwich is unbelievable, enough that I have to return periodically for.",4.0

Now that they've moved the bar downstairs, which is dark, loud (a DJ on weekends) and obviously not the romantic spot the upstairs bar was... To top it off, the old fashioned is pre-mixed, which I can understand makes it easier for the bartender, but it really reduced depth of flavor in the cocktail. Some things shouldn't change!",3.0

"Fabulous.This is my second visit to Rye. the first was with my husband last summer, when we ate a phenomenal meal with excellent service. Today was no different. I dined alone, and was ready to splurge. I ordered the grilled ceviche, a briny, tangy mixture of seafood and citrus, their dee-lish homemade pickle plate filled with a huge variety of house made pickled goodness, scrumptious, creamy Spring Vegetable Raviolis, stuffed with ricotta, served with just tender asparagus, spring peas, and fresh herbs in an umami-rich Parmesan broth. Anyone and everyone who was working helped serve me, including a charming woman who found me perfect wine pairings. Finally I indulged in a splendid cheese plate as I am surprisingly not the most enthusiastic dessert person. The 5-variety cheese plate did me in with its wonderful aromas, nuttiness, creaminess, its buttery, funky, salty goodness, all from local Bedford cheese shop.It's actually not easy to find caring service and great food in New York. Rye, keep up the great work!",5.0

"I've been coming to Rye since I moved to Brooklyn in 2009.  Not only is it great for an intimate dining experience, but they have accommodated my whole family for brunch numerous times (we've been up to 13 people at times). Of course it's best to make a reservation.I always get the three egg omelette with goat cheese and caramelized onions for brunch. It comes with a hash brown and side salad and always holds me until dinner.  I also recommend the grapefruit and the smoked salmon if you want to split an appetizer. For dinner, I like to get the chicken, even though it takes a little while to bake.The staff here is unlike anywhere else in the area. They're knowledgable about EVERYTHING on the menu, from the wine to the desserts. I can't even decide if it's the service or the food that has kept me coming back regularly for the past 5 years.",5.0

"I am one of those who ended up at Rye at the behest of a friend who became somewhat incoherent describing their meatloaf sandwich.  I was to discover there's more to like at this all-around excellent neighborhood restaurant.Decor is masculine, yet accessible.  Channels old-fashioned saloon, with sleek dark-wood furniture and columns, very dim lighting at night.  Their oft-noted cocktails can be had at their comfortable bar, or to accompany the very good food menu, which is trim, diverse, and appealing.  The food skews toward hearty, the style New American, with inspirations and ingredients both international and local.  A prix fix three-course meal is also offered.Rye's famed meatloaf sandwich, listed under their ""Favorites"" section, is truly marvelous.  Arguably, I'm already biased, being fond of meatloaf, meatballs, and the like, but this beauty was decadent, succulent, and a flavor bomb.  Rye makes the meatloaf with a quartet of meats (beef, veal, pork, duck), and sandwiches a huge hunk of it between crusty bread, crispy buttermilk fried onions, and lettuce smothered in a creamy sauce.  The experience of eating it is hard to describe, although blissful works.  So good was it that I've had it (or at least a slice of it) at every visit, and I rarely repeat entrees.The rest of the food selection is not to be overshadowed.  Rye has a lot of good food options, well-prepared and flavored.  Fried brussels sprouts, showered in shaved parmesan, is an especial highlight.  The four cheese Mac and cheese sports a nice char and never-can-be-wrong bacon.  Grilled shrimp and scallop kebab was perfectly cooked and served with a refreshing, tart tomato salad.  Scotch egg one-ups the classic preparation with a crispy panko crust, coming pre-sliced in two with a delicious cheese sauce.  The single disappointment I can recall was a fried chicken on special that was dry and somewhat lacking in flavor, although the crust was delicious and the accompanying mashed potatoes fluffy, buttery, and addictive.Despite the cocktail rep, I've more often had beers.  Their cocktails are a good price for Brooklyn, and I'd consider it worthwhile to enjoy one at the bar with a few small plates.  Also a good list of spirits and wines.Rye is a great place for drinks and food.  The ambience is laid-back and service friendly.  And that meatball sandwich is unbelievable, enough that I have to return periodically for.",4.0
"Brussel sprouts. In a cheesy, creamy cause - always wish I ordered two. Good pork belly and fries too. Tip: the downstairs bar has all the best upstairs food and snacks with no wait. Cool vibe too.",4.0
"Rye used to be my favorite spot to take people for an old fashioned. It was classy, elegant, and wow- that old fashioned was refreshing & delightful. Now that they've moved the bar downstairs, which is dark, loud (a DJ on weekends) and obviously not the romantic spot the upstairs bar was... To top it off, the old fashioned is pre-mixed, which I can understand makes it easier for the bartender, but it really reduced depth of flavor in the cocktail. Some things shouldn't change!",3.0
"Was recommended this place from a barber at Persons of Interest. A throw back, cozy feel. With 3 different meals (Brunch, Lunch and Dinner) be sure to know which meal you're looking to have there. We had lunch. The Meatloaf sandwich is amazing! Perfect meat to bread portion. A great tangy sauce on the meatloaf. We also had the brussels sprouts. Very tasty.To drink, I had the Dylan Temple ( Fresh Ginger, house made Grenadine, Ginger Ale) My with had the Mint Julep. Really cool presentation and very strong. Such a great place to sit for a while and enjoy a meal and drink.",5.0

"Fabulous.This is my second visit to Rye. the first was with my husband last summer, when we ate a phenomenal meal with excellent service. Today was no different. I dined alone, and was ready to splurge. I ordered the grilled ceviche, a briny, tangy mixture of seafood and citrus, their dee-lish homemade pickle plate filled with a huge variety of house made pickled goodness, scrumptious, creamy Spring Vegetable Raviolis, stuffed with ricotta, served with just tender asparagus, spring peas, and fresh herbs in an umami-rich Parmesan broth. Anyone and everyone who was working helped serve me, including a charming woman who found me perfect wine pairings. Finally I indulged in a splendid cheese plate as I am surprisingly not the most enthusiastic dessert person. The 5-variety cheese plate did me in with its wonderful aromas, nuttiness, creaminess, its buttery, funky, salty goodness, all from local Bedford cheese shop.It's actually not easy to find caring service and great food in New York. Rye, keep up the great work!",5.0
"Rye is the Answer.$5 Old Fashioned and $5 Cheeseburgers.I work up by Riverdale in the Bronx and after the first Happy Hour here, I almost moved to Brooklyn. I can barely arrive by the Happy Hour cut off at 7pm, but have a group of caring friends who ensure that there are a couple of cocktails and burgers waiting for me whether I arrive on time or not. Sometimes we actually eat from the delicious dinner menu but always pair that with a tasty Rye Old Fashioned. Mmm.",5.0
"I've been coming to Rye since I moved to Brooklyn in 2009.  Not only is it great for an intimate dining experience, but they have accommodated my whole family for brunch numerous times (we've been up to 13 people at times). Of course it's best to make a reservation.I always get the three egg omelette with goat cheese and caramelized onions for brunch. It comes with a hash brown and side salad and always holds me until dinner.  I also recommend the grapefruit and the smoked salmon if you want to split an appetizer. For dinner, I like to get the chicken, even though it takes a little while to bake.The staff here is unlike anywhere else in the area. They're knowledgable about EVERYTHING on the menu, from the wine to the desserts. I can't even decide if it's the service or the food that has kept me coming back regularly for the past 5 years.",5.0
"Sit at one of the tables of the back.  Take the gangster approach.  Order the steak for two medium rare and a bottle of wine.  You have a cocktail to finish from the bar.  Nonchalantly exude panache while adjacent diners wonder why they didn't do this, as well.  Smoke a cigarette after dinner just because you f*king can. 4.5 stars.",4.0

"Rye oh Rye didn't I go here earlier? I lived a block over from this place for close to a year and never once ventured in. I think I was scared away by the three dollar signs. Big mistake. Also, not really that expensive. Also also, if you think it's expensive, get over yourself (or leave new york) because being poor is soo 2000-and-late.*On to the meal.

He was especially delighted by the charcoal flavor imparted on the meat. Apparently they pan sear it and then toss it on a grill or something. I can't really remember as I was fairly drunk, which brings me to the drinks.Drinks:The Old Fashioned (not a hand job for you South Park dorks, the drink) It was good. Served with one large ice cube, which is aesthetically pleasing but functionally disappointing--more booze, less ice. Ice cube issues notwithstanding, it got me drunk. Yayyy!

"Went for dinner with the lady a few nights back. Really enjoyed it! The atmosphere is nice....soft lighting, open space. I would say that the layout could be a little more seductive or romantic -- Rye seems to be channeling that vibe but the open space yet proximity to other diners negates it a tad. To start, the drinks and apps were fantastic! Without question: get the brussel sprouts! The pate was also really great.Service was top-notch; some of the best I've had in a while. Warm, attentive, genial, not at all overbearing. Great wine recommendations. Sadly, it would have been hard to match the excellence of the apps and my entree, the pork belly, just didn't. After spending some time in North Carolina, I've grown to expect  pork belly to be a fatty, soft cut of meat. This wasn't the case -- it was more of a pork chop, but perhaps this was my fault for not asking. Regardless, the dish didn't have the pizazz I was looking for. Will probably return for some great cocktails, apps and another try one day soon.",4.0

"What a ridiculously good and under-rated brunch spot in Williamsburg.  Seriously, why is this place not on more people's radar?We had the eggs benedict and crab cakes and split them both.  Warning: food is a bit small, but priced right, and is absolutely delicious.  This is not to say that we were hungry upon leaving, but I just wanted to get the plate size out in the open.The presentation of the food was excellent, as was the attentive service.The atmosphere is as chill as Williamsburg, but the service is better than most Williamsburg locales, I would say.  The drinks tasted as though they were mixed and poured by a master mixologist.  The best old fashioned in Brooklyn, I say!  But really, this is a must for brunch, because not only was it awesome - there was no wait.  Why wait a decade at the over-rated Egg when you could come here?  Get a table in less time, and be surrounded by ambience that evokes an urban meeting rustic feel.  I cannot wait to return.",5.0
"Popped in for dinner because we got a $50 gift card for Xmas.. it was a pleasant surprise :)The food was delicious: we had the meatloaf sandwich and the Ravioli.The drinks were well-crafted: we had the Old-fashioned and the Southside.The ambience was unique & the customer service was good.My only issue with the place was that it seemed a little pricier than what it should be, having had the food & drinks.  Not that it was bad, but just that the price point was a little higher than what it should be IMHO.  But in all reality... it is Williamsburg.. and it is NYC.. so take that for what it's worth haha!I'd definitely still recommend this place for anyone in the Williamsburg area, as it was a great place for a cute quiet date :)",4.0
"Yay, is right.  This bone in ribeye for two melted in our mouths.  Better than Luger's (easily) and St Anselm's (surprisingly).  So flavorful and tender, as was the cheese covered cauliflower.  The waitress, Danielle, was helpful, patient (and beautiful). She suggested a wine that was a little less expensive than what I had selected and it was delicious.Will return soon.",5.0
"Hands down my favorite restaurant in williamsburg. I've been a fan from day 1. Love the old fashioneds, meat loaf samich, endive salad and scotch egg. Awesome atmosphere. Cal, the owner, is always in the kitchen and this is probably why it's always been a consistently amazing experience!!",5.0

"I've gone here many times since it first opened, and we've loved it from the start.  Our love has not diminished with time.  FOOD: of course, it's a restaurant and has food.  I can safely say we've had pretty much everything on the menu.  It is luxurious all American fare.

"Took my lady to this small speakeasy style restaurant. We had a great time there. What really sold it was the service and the appetizer! The Ceviche was just delightful, perfectly seasoned with a little heat and very light on the palate. While my partner ordered a buttery ravioli, perfectly cooked with a slight al dente, I had the pork belly. Unfortunately I have to say my entree was not our favorite. The belly was cooked to perfection but the over abundance of broccoli rhab(sp?), cut into my enjoyment of this dish. The broccoli being so bitter didn't compliment the salty pork, in fact it was not a good flavor addition at all. Maybe a starch would have been better? The rhubarb cobbler was a perfect ending to our dinner. The vibe was hip professional williamsburg. The service was great. The tables are very small in an attempt to utilize the space though it doesn't seem to cause a problem with eating. Overall I'd recommend this place to everyone. Good service is underrated and really can make or break an experience. It definitely made it for us.",4.0
"I came here for Sunday brunch to meet my boyfriend's parents for the first time - and boy, was I hungover.  My boyfriend practically had to drag me from the Bedford Avenue L stop all the way to the restaurant while I tried to walk with my eyes closed, grumbling expletives about Brooklyn the whole way.  And yes, I'm a bundle of fun to be around when I'm hungover, why do you ask?  To be fair, I wanted to get it all out of my system before we got to the restaurant, since I knew I would need to do a major flip-the-switch, bright-eyed-bushy-tailed attitude transformation on myself as soon as we met up with his parents.Much to my relief, his parents did not have a problem with ordering cocktails at brunch.  I ordered a Southside (gin, cucumber, mint, lime, soda water) which was exactly what I was in the mood for - light and crisp, without tasting too much like gin (I am not a big gin drinker, although it's growing on me).Everyone liked their food.  I got an omelette, which was plated with breakfast potatoes and a side salad.  Everything was really good, right down to the dressing on the side salad.  Our table also ordered a side of donuts to share, which didn't look like anything exceptional at first glance, but they were really, really good and hot out of the deep fryer.My one complaint would be that our waitress was not very consistent.  There were two times when she only asked part of the table for their order, and then walked away, leaving everyone confused as to whether or not she had taken the order incorrectly, partially, or had not taken it at all.I would come back here again, but probably only if I was meeting up with people who were already living/staying in BK.  Otherwise, I think I'll mostly be sticking to the brunch places on my own island, which the people of Williamsburg would probably prefer anyway.",4.0

On to the entrees, I had the roasted organic chicken. I managed to eat it though i was stuffed and tipsy from all of the above. It was excellent.

"Brunch: no wait, as the restaurant was less than half-full...well, except for all the waiting we did for THE most sourpuss waitress you've ever seen. Good lord, what a lemonface! We waited a long time after getting seated to get served at all; very little checking in throughout the long meal we had. Thank goodness for the busboy who was pouring the water. After I asked for the check, she silently pushed it in front of me, practically into my lap, and walked away without a word. Food was decent, not great; the hollandaise tasted weird, like the butter was off. Great potato, though. Bloody Mary was small and absolutely nothing special, which is too bad for $11 a pop -- pretty nervy to price it that high.  Among the diners, you'll see a lot of women with hot pink lipstick, if that's something you're into.It's a shame...I went a long time ago for dinner a few times and loved the meatloaf sandwich (which is still there, just a few bucks more), steak, and cocktails.

"Had an art gallery to attend and decided to eat before hand. The place we tried was packed and the wait was forever. I quickly took out my phone to look places nearby on Yelp which accept credit and are well reviewed. My search leads me down the block to Rye, a debate begins on whether or not we should go in. Then we notice a sign saying, ""$5 Dollar Old Fashioneds and $5 Dollar Cheeseburgers."" Debate ends!The place seemed to cater to those who wanted a fine dinning experience as well as someone who was just looking to get a drink or two. We sat ourselves by the bar and ordered one of the best Old Fashioned's I've had in my life. The bar was beautiful and fully stocked. The bartender was super helpful and had all our questions answered. Awesome guy! They have a great $6 dollar shot and beer combo. Now most places that do this, will offer you a well shot (Jim Bean, if you're lucky or some other low shelf liquor) and cheap beer (PBR, High Life). I got a shot of Jameson and Hefenweizen, I don't think that can be beat. My friend settles on the cheeseburger while I decided to be adventurous. I've never seen duck confit with gnocchi before, so my selection was easy. Great combo of the two and ate every bite. They boil their gnocchi and then pan fry it slightly, giving it a slight crisp which was nice. I'm sold on this place. You will be too. I'm coming back for the meatloaf sandwich.",5.0
"Excellent place for brunch. My friends and I shared the homemade biscuits and donuts as an appetizer. I would definitely recommend the biscuits. The donuts were good but nothing to rave about.

Stake! stake!Even all their food is amazing the rid eye stake for two is to die for.

(Good service in Brooklyn is becoming a rare animal).And if you go for brunch... Meatloaf sandwich all the way and a nice red rooster cocktail!,5.0
"For the bar alone I give them 4 stars. Gorgeous looking bar, great stock, very good bartenders. I'd like to see some more interesting and unique cocktails but given the food they serve and the atmosphere they're going for the classic cocktails are apropos. At $11 it's also reasonably priced. I only had a drink so I'm looking forward to coming back for a meal.I edited this review afterwards since when I was reviewing my credit card statement I noticed that they charged me more than what I signed.

"I feel like I got coned! I took my girlfriend there for V-day, they had a v-day special which was 85$ per person.

The food was pretty good, the duck was amazing. Great wine selection. Cons: Food: Was not worth the 85$. Even if we assume that the appetizer was 20$ and the desert was 15$ that would leave a 50$ main course dish. My dish came with a lobster claw 1 scallop (which was over cooked) 3 pieces of shrimp and 3 small clams. My girlfriend ordered a steak dish and the best thing about it was the potatoes.

"This place is charming.  Of course, like any decent restaurant in New York, it's pretty pricey.So I was rewatching Mad Men, because why not?  Don Draper is constantly chugging down an Old Fashioned in bars with lots of polished wood and eating some british/american meal.  So, we're stuck in Williamsburg looking to get a bite and I see that this place is recommended for its signature Old Fashioned.  I thought, I must try it! So, we went and ordered it from our bartender whose beard must haven taken ages to grow...  Maybe they were trying to complete the prohibition speakeasy look by suggesting that the bartenders had just come from making moonshine out back.  They both had long beards, but one was longer than the other, causing me to remark to my dinner companion that the length of the beard must represent how long they've worked there.  The waiter behind us was apparently just getting started on his.Anyway, so we order the cocktails and they come with one massive cube of ice (like they should), a good sized peel, and have this insanely delicious flavor.  I like whiskey normally but this was smooth and subtle and a little sweet.  It really shouldn't be missed.We also had a cheese plate, which is nearly impossible to get wrong but they did it in a way that felt appropriate to the decor (bread with raisins, jelly, pickels!).  For the main course we had duck confit with gnocchi which was a special, but it was insanely good.  It was ""comfort food"" but in high style.Overall this place is hard to describe.  On the food alone I'd give 4 stars, but the 20's style decor, pleasant service, and the fact that I don't have to shout in the restaurant made the whole thing an ""experience"".   Stop reading and go check it out.",5.0
"Typical of what a LOT of Williamsburg restaurants are. Overhyped, overpriced, decor-oriented, and very sub-par food. I'm going to cut to the chase. The Scotch egg was a good starter at a good price. The artichoke appy was a tiny serving for an entree price, and not worth it. The entrees that my girlfriend and I had were the Halibut and Lamb Kebab. Halibut...expensive and dry. Lamb...DID NOT TASTE LIKE LAMB. I couldn't identify what taste it was, so I sent it back and ordered the pork belly instead. Pork belly is supposed to be somewhat fatty...yes, but it's not supposed to be 95% fat and a smidgen of meat. Tried the desserts....MEH.

"Came here for the Happy Hour special under recommendation of a friend. From 5:30 to 7:00 M-F, the bar offers an Old Fashioned for $5 and a cheeseburger for $5, bringing the only meal a working man needs to the table for a very reasonable, if not unheard of price in Williamsburg (or anywhere in NYC for that matter). The reviews are pretty good, and the place looks nice enough...and once I was served my Old Fashioned by a bartender who looks like he know's what he's doing, my outlook for the overall experience was pretty good.The drink was a light pour, which was totally expected for the price tag. It was made with quality spirits though, and was pretty much spot on and refreshing. No complaints here, and it certainly beat out the Wild Turkey poor man's concoction I make myself at home with shavings from questionable oranges I get from the bodega. I then proceeded to order my cheeseburger, plus the brussel sprouts under suggestion of the bartender. I should have known something was up when the response upon ordering my burger was anything besides ""How would you like that done?"" I just let it ride. That's my faux pas I guess. I know enough about food prep to know that when you order a burger, or any meat for that matter - you order rare or medium done or you get the back of the freezer leftovers from last week because it'll arrive so tasteless it might as we'll be dog food. Think I'm exaggerating? Have you ever worked in a kitchen? Me either, but I read Anthony Bourdain's book once. I few minutes later, I'm served what I'm told is my cheeseburger. In reality, it was two scorched slider-sized beef patties on a potato bun, some sad flimsy jarred pickle chips and shredded iceberg lettuce. No ketchup on or on the side, because apparently Rye exists outside the borders of the USA. The brussels sprouts soon followed a few minutes later, which was odd. They were fantastic though. At $8, normal (read: fat) Americans may consider it a small portion. I was satisfied though, they were easily the highlight of the meal, and sadly, my day. Would I visit Rye again? Probably not, but the ambiance was cute and I assume that the well-prepared portion of my meal probably speaks to the quality of the dining room service.

It's 3 and 1/2 stars for me. I came here on a  Saturday at noon and there was no AC. It was 88 degrees outside! I had the highly rated meat loaf sandwich.

"I recently dined at Rye with my husband and had an exceptional experience. The intimate, lovely ambiance, excellent food and cocktails, and warm service were all spot on. Rye is exactly the kind of restaurant I love; a beautiful atmosphere that's still casual, comfortable, and totally fine with a t-shirt and jeans. I had been curious to try Rye after watching an interview with the chef/owner and some of his staff members. When I mentioned this to the hostess, Shevawn, upon entering, she reacted with such warmth and graciousness. We were given an absolutely perfect table; intimate, in the corner, and with just the right balance between a hushed ""buzz"" of conversation from our fellow diners, but quiet enough that we could converse easily. The chef/owner, Cal, even took time out to come say hello to us personally. My parents owned a small business and I know how hard/busy it is, so the fact that he took the time to do that impressed me. Our meal started off with a delightful pea/mint soup that that the chef sent over as a complimentary gift, which really touched us. It was a topped with a frozen tzatziki that made for a delightful mix of textures; the smoothness of the soup liquid against the crunch of the tzatziki topping. Next, we had roast chicken and I believe a brisket, both of which were excellent. The skin on my chicken was nice and crisp, with juicy, well-seasoned meat beneath. Sides were great. Cocktails were also delightful; strong, and not too sweet, just how I like them. The owner, Cal, incredibly generously (on top of the complimentary appetizer) actually bought our first round of drinks for us. We were so appreciative of the wonderful service, intimate setting, and of the great lengths Cal, Shevawn and the wait staff went to to make us feel welcome. Looking forward to our next visit already. Strongly recommend.",5.0
"I had a nice little romantic dinner here on a Saturday night.

"Rye might be my favorite restaurant in the neighborhood...probably the whole city. The overall experience of dining here is really wonderful. The atmosphere is lovely. The staff is always very kind.

Can't recommend this place enough.",5.0

"Rye is awesome on so many levels.But really, I just want to applaud them for being so flex with the menu.  I am a vegetarian and after having an utterly terrible experience at Traif, I was so relieved to be able to find food (and delicious food at that) to eat at Rye.When I asked the server if I could order the brussels sprouts without bacon, she replied, ""Of course.  We make everything fresh.""Of course they do.  Delicious, but decadent, food awaits you at Rye.  Be prepared to wait on a weekend--but luckily there is a great bar next door that will let you wait it out.",4.0
Ordered pretty much everything we could to share. The Brussels Sprouts were fantastic... Little heavy on the cheese. Service was good. I'm obsessed with the decor.

It's 3 and 1/2 stars for me. I came here on a  Saturday at noon and there was no AC. It was 88 degrees outside! I had the highly rated meat loaf sandwich. It was good but I did not fancy the ciabatta bread that much. Maybe it was too hard and dense? Overall good experience. They also have yummy virgin cocktails like the Dylan Temple.,3.0
"I recently dined at Rye with my husband and had an exceptional experience. The intimate, lovely ambiance, excellent food and cocktails, and warm service were all spot on. Rye is exactly the kind of restaurant I love; a beautiful atmosphere that's still casual, comfortable, and totally fine with a t-shirt and jeans. I had been curious to try Rye after watching an interview with the chef/owner and some of his staff members. When I mentioned this to the hostess, Shevawn, upon entering, she reacted with such warmth and graciousness. We were given an absolutely perfect table; intimate, in the corner, and with just the right balance between a hushed ""buzz"" of conversation from our fellow diners, but quiet enough that we could converse easily. The chef/owner, Cal, even took time out to come say hello to us personally. My parents owned a small business and I know how hard/busy it is, so the fact that he took the time to do that impressed me. Our meal started off with a delightful pea/mint soup that that the chef sent over as a complimentary gift, which really touched us. It was a topped with a frozen tzatziki that made for a delightful mix of textures; the smoothness of the soup liquid against the crunch of the tzatziki topping. Next, we had roast chicken and I believe a brisket, both of which were excellent. The skin on my chicken was nice and crisp, with juicy, well-seasoned meat beneath. Sides were great. Cocktails were also delightful; strong, and not too sweet, just how I like them. The owner, Cal, incredibly generously (on top of the complimentary appetizer) actually bought our first round of drinks for us. We were so appreciative of the wonderful service, intimate setting, and of the great lengths Cal, Shevawn and the wait staff went to to make us feel welcome. Looking forward to our next visit already. Strongly recommend.",5.0
"I had a nice little romantic dinner here on a Saturday night. Definitely call ahead for reservations (we did, but I hear the wait can be cray).I got chicken and he got beef and we both had rose and it was just so good. Everything about it was delicious. Worth the price, worth the ambience. I hope we go back again soon!",5.0
"Rye might be my favorite restaurant in the neighborhood...probably the whole city. The overall experience of dining here is really wonderful. The atmosphere is lovely. The staff is always very kind. The drinks and top notch, and the food is remarkable. You can really taste the quality in the ingredients and the love that goes in to each dish. I know that sounds corny, but it's so true. Can't recommend this place enough.",5.0

"Rye is awesome on so many levels.But really, I just want to applaud them for being so flex with the menu.  I am a vegetarian and after having an utterly terrible experience at Traif, I was so relieved to be able to find food (and delicious food at that) to eat at Rye.When I asked the server if I could order the brussels sprouts without bacon, she replied, ""Of course.  We make everything fresh.""Of course they do.  Delicious, but decadent, food awaits you at Rye.  Be prepared to wait on a weekend--but luckily there is a great bar next door that will let you wait it out.",4.0

I was a bit overwhelmed when I saw how much fat was actually on my plate. Okay, I was REALLY flabbergasted. Cass basically told me shut up and eat it.

We were being early birds with huge appetites ready to ravage some tasty morsels created by Chef Cal Elliott.Entrees (average price ~$25):House Smoked Fresh Bacon - grilled berkshire pork belly, brussel sprouts, white beans & lemon confit.+ 3 HUGE, GENEROUS, JUICY, FATTY pieces of pork belly. I was a bit overwhelmed when I saw how much fat was actually on my plate. Okay, I was REALLY flabbergasted. Cass basically told me shut up and eat it. The savory, succulent, fatty juices exploded in my mouth and easily slipped down my throat. The brussel sprouts were also cooked well and had a nice crunch to eat bite. Would I order this again? YES.All Natural Chicken - sage butternut squash, pancetta risotto, swiss chard.+ I appreciated and loved that the chicken was cooked perfectly and flavored well. The swiss chard was also heavenly and complimented each bite of chicken. Would I order this as my entree on my next visit? YES.I also ordered the shot and beer combo for $6. No cocktails or meatloaf/pork belly/short rib sandwiches this time around but they are definitely on my to eat/drink list. Especially since the sandwiches only run you $12-15.Reason #4325 to move to Brooklyn: Rye",4.0
I've come a couple times for brunch. The first time was about a year ago..nothing spectacular. So today we tried giving it another shot. Food is ok. Nothing amazing but pretty good which is the only reason for three stars. As far as service goes this place is not the best. The hostess was friendly and seated us right away but the waitress was awful. Took us at least five minutes to even get some water or coffee. Took another 20 to get our food and then another 10 for the bill. Plus it's really noisy with bad lighting.  Feels like you're in a garage. I think skip brunch..dinner is better here.,3.0
"Rye still ROCKS!My wife and I finally took advantage of the Happy Hour at Rye - $5 cheeseburgers and Old Fashions. The Old Fashions were very nice and served with one giant cube of ice to limit melting / diluting of the cocktail. The cheese burgers were very good too and very filling. I was expecting something more along the line of ""sliders"" but they served full on cheeseburgers. We also split the Brussels sprouts side dish wish was very good too.",5.0
"Rye is delicious, especially for brunch! The mimosas and bloody marys are perfectly blended and the food is both visually pleasing and tasty. I highly recommend the Rye Benedict in particular. The portions are not huge but the taste is worth it. The only downside to this place is that it's a pain to get to via public transportation. If you can drive there instead, I'd recommend you do so.",4.0

"Brunch review.The Bloody Mary here is strong but about 1/3 half the size vs Le Barricou on the other side of the burg.

I don't think customers like surprises so they should at least stay updated. It was good (I don't know if it's meatball shop good, but it's good) and filling, and the breaded onion rings on the top were delicious.That dish is missing one fatal thing though - a salad.

"All dark wood and class, this beautiful bar is hidden behind a nondescript door on South 1st.

Several shots of tequila (and glasses of Ommegang and Blue Point) later, I was fully appreciative of the dichotomy between wonderful cocktails, and good old-fashioned drinking away the pain. The man behind the bar is a consummate professional. Not only does he mix drinks skillfully, but he is friendly and full of fun facts and sage wisdom.

The Old Fashioned was perfect, and the burger was two thick patties stacked up with cheese and some greens. Great presentation. I was offered fries too and took them, and it turns out they were $6(!)I get it, they're not on the happy hour menu, but to charge more for a small basket of fries than a serious burger is serious SHADE. I know, $6 is nothing, but it takes away from the 'good feeling' of this being an honest happy hour when you're sneakily offering extras to compensate for the nominal prices of happy hour specials.Anyway, no bad feelings, Rye.

"I took my fiancee for an early Vday dinner since we were going to be travelling on the 14th. The menu is something that appeals to both me and my fiancee very well.

However, our desert stomachs still had us order the warm chocolate cake. All in all the tab came out to be around $90 not including tip, which is pretty good for a nice date.The atmosphere was very nice as well. Pretty much the place to have a casual conversation with your loved ones or friends. I would say that this venue is great for parties up to around 4 or 5.

"""Meh. I've experienced better"" is the perfect explanation for how I feel about this place. It is trying to be(and charging like it is) something that it doesn't quite achieve.  I came in and had brunch at the bar.  The decor is simple but a little too bland. I had the special brunch cocktail which was nice, but the flavors weren't quite there... perhaps it's because the bartender didn't shake it properly. The bartender himself was just there.  He wasn't unfriendly but also wasn't anyone I could pick out of a lineup.  The food was the most ""meh"" borderline ""ehhh"". I had the Rye Benedict.  It was supposed to be pulled pork belly, an egg, and hollandaise on a biscuit. The first piece was literally just pork belly fat.  I know that it's a fattier cut and I expect some fat (that's why the flavor is so delicious) but it should still have some meat to it.  The biscuits were dry.  The second egg was somewhere in between soft and hard boiled.  Every aspect of this meal was underwhelming and left me feeling ""meh"".  Nope, not making a return visit or suggesting this place.",2.0

"I've been wanting to drop into Rye for awhile now, and finally stopped by during happy hour. $5 Old Fashioned + $5 burgers = fabulous. Both were amazing too--really well made. The Old Fashioned was perfect, and the burger was two thick patties stacked up with cheese and some greens. Great presentation. I was offered fries too and took them, and it turns out they were $6(!)I get it, they're not on the happy hour menu, but to charge more for a small basket of fries than a serious burger is serious SHADE. I know, $6 is nothing, but it takes away from the 'good feeling' of this being an honest happy hour when you're sneakily offering extras to compensate for the nominal prices of happy hour specials.Anyway, no bad feelings, Rye. This place is a classy joint and I'll definitely be back for dinner.",4.0
"I took my fiancee for an early Vday dinner since we were going to be travelling on the 14th. The menu is something that appeals to both me and my fiancee very well. I got the braised short rid and she got the sea scallops and pork belly. We also shared as an ""appetizer"" the mac & cheese. Everything was delicious and we were completely full by the end of it. However, our desert stomachs still had us order the warm chocolate cake. All in all the tab came out to be around $90 not including tip, which is pretty good for a nice date.The atmosphere was very nice as well. Pretty much the place to have a casual conversation with your loved ones or friends. I would say that this venue is great for parties up to around 4 or 5. Some seating gets a little tight and you sit right next to others, but overall it was a great experience.The only ding I would give would be some prices for food, but everything tasted great and the service was good as well. I will definitely be returning to Rye.",4.0
"""Meh. I've experienced better"" is the perfect explanation for how I feel about this place. It is trying to be(and charging like it is) something that it doesn't quite achieve.  I came in and had brunch at the bar.  The decor is simple but a little too bland. I had the special brunch cocktail which was nice, but the flavors weren't quite there... perhaps it's because the bartender didn't shake it properly. The bartender himself was just there.  He wasn't unfriendly but also wasn't anyone I could pick out of a lineup.  The food was the most ""meh"" borderline ""ehhh"". I had the Rye Benedict.  It was supposed to be pulled pork belly, an egg, and hollandaise on a biscuit. The first piece was literally just pork belly fat.  I know that it's a fattier cut and I expect some fat (that's why the flavor is so delicious) but it should still have some meat to it.  The biscuits were dry.  The second egg was somewhere in between soft and hard boiled.  Every aspect of this meal was underwhelming and left me feeling ""meh"".  Nope, not making a return visit or suggesting this place.",2.0

"This is my new favorite restaurant in Brooklyn...which is pretty significant since there are some pretty fantastic places in this borough. My friend and I went on a Friday evening around 8pm and were seated immediately. I love the decor of the restaurant, with the bartenders situated behind a long dark bar...dim lighting. It feels like the 1920's prohibition era. I started with the French 75 cocktail - a gin, prosecco and lemon concoction. My friend had the Jack Rose, which was a mix of apple brandy, grenadine and lime juice. Both were excellent. To start we had the fried brussel sprouts....AMAZING. Hands down best brussel sprouts in NYC. 10x better than the infamous sprouts at Momofuku, Dubuque and Brucie.  They came piled high in a ramekin, tossed in a lemon vinaigrette with capers and TONS of pecorino cheese. I would go back to that place just for those cruciferous morsels.For dinner I had the meatloaf sandwich which was incredible. Perhaps because it was made with duck, making it moist and super flavorful. My friend had the crabcake appetizer for her meal and she said it was just ""OK""Dessert- even though we were stuffed we opted to get dessert and chose the Warm Chocolate Cake. Why Rye...why would you even attempt to serve any other dessert at your establishment when you have this gem on your menu! It was the best molten chocolate cake I have ever had. A light as air, gooey chocolate cake topped with a salty caramel sauce and came with pistachio ice cream. Also there were ground of pieces or biscotti or amaretti cookies I think beneath it. The combination of flavors and textures was just awesome. I don't think I could try another dessert there again, knowing that I would be missing out on this!Service was very good. Our waitress was very nice and knowledgeable. I usually don't pay attention to reviews on here which focus on service since I am more interested in the actual food than the people serving it. But our waitress was great so I am just throwing that out there. This is sure to be a place that I will go to often. And until then I will dream about those brusel sprouts and warm chocolate cake.",5.0

"Unimpressed! Rye had some serious potential...but I was let down.Food: Meh. Okay, my friend's pork belly was pretty good...and the portion was satisfactory. But my TWENTY-FOUR DOLLAR lasagna was mediocre. It seemed promising at first but I quickly learned that there's way too much cheese. WAAAYY too much. I pretty much ate everything but the cheese. What a waste. The french fries were good though, perfect crispiness.Service: Our waiter had potential. He looked put together, and since he was older, I thought maybe the service here would be different from all the pretentious Burg joints. But no. At first we thought that he was just difficult to read...he wasn't friendly but he wasn't necessarily unfriendly either. But then a group of older people sat next to us, and he did a complete 180 with them! He was so accommodating and friendly with them, it was insane. He actually cracked some jokes and SMILED. What an asshole! We think he was judging us for being the youngest people in the restaurant, as if we were incapable of giving him a good tip or something.Our bill came out to $70+ for an unmemorable meal of 2 entrees, a side of fries, and a glass of wine. Totally not worth it. Maybe we'll come back here when we're 45.",3.0

We also ordered some oysters to start, but when we saw the Meatloaf Sandwich, we forgot about everything else. I'm not even hungry right now, but writing this is making me salivate thinking about it!!!Service was good, and so was the atmosphere. The only thing I would fix is the sound system.

Basically it's a hard boiled egg, cuddled up in a crispy, cozy, sausage and bacon blanket, smothered in a cheesy bechamel sauce. Drool. The only downfall is there was not enough of this delectable egg concoction to go around!Unfortunately I came when the only available menu was ""Bar & Table"".

"Hello, Happy Hour Old Fashioneds...yum! The Old Fashioned I had was too sweet, so I told the bartender to hold the sugar on the second one...it was delish. I got a strong, pleasant buzz. Charming bar and setting, good AC in summer. Will definitely go back.",4.0
"This is my new favorite restaurant in Brooklyn...which is pretty significant since there are some pretty fantastic places in this borough. My friend and I went on a Friday evening around 8pm and were seated immediately. I love the decor of the restaurant, with the bartenders situated behind a long dark bar...dim lighting. It feels like the 1920's prohibition era. I started with the French 75 cocktail - a gin, prosecco and lemon concoction. My friend had the Jack Rose, which was a mix of apple brandy, grenadine and lime juice. Both were excellent. To start we had the fried brussel sprouts....AMAZING. Hands down best brussel sprouts in NYC. 10x better than the infamous sprouts at Momofuku, Dubuque and Brucie.  They came piled high in a ramekin, tossed in a lemon vinaigrette with capers and TONS of pecorino cheese. I would go back to that place just for those cruciferous morsels.For dinner I had the meatloaf sandwich which was incredible. Perhaps because it was made with duck, making it moist and super flavorful. My friend had the crabcake appetizer for her meal and she said it was just ""OK""Dessert- even though we were stuffed we opted to get dessert and chose the Warm Chocolate Cake. Why Rye...why would you even attempt to serve any other dessert at your establishment when you have this gem on your menu! It was the best molten chocolate cake I have ever had. A light as air, gooey chocolate cake topped with a salty caramel sauce and came with pistachio ice cream. Also there were ground of pieces or biscotti or amaretti cookies I think beneath it. The combination of flavors and textures was just awesome. I don't think I could try another dessert there again, knowing that I would be missing out on this!Service was very good. Our waitress was very nice and knowledgeable. I usually don't pay attention to reviews on here which focus on service since I am more interested in the actual food than the people serving it. But our waitress was great so I am just throwing that out there. This is sure to be a place that I will go to often. And until then I will dream about those brusel sprouts and warm chocolate cake.",5.0
"ahhhh oysters!!!!  These were the best oysters I have had in over a year.  Fresh, clean, and lovely.  Apparently their oysters are from the same supplier Per Se uses for their oysters.  mmmm.They have an excellent bourbon and drink list, fabulous wine selection too!  The beet salad was delectable, could have been my main course.  The goat cheese was so creamy and accompanying horseradish vinaigrette made me want to lick my plate.  I had the special of skate and the cassoulet looked amazing.  Finishing things off the most decadent banana split and a cup of coffee. wow.This place is hidden on a residential street in Williamsburg, but worth seeking out! Great for dinner and drinks.  Charming staff.PS:  I love that they use a random assortment of vintage dishes and real silver utensils.",5.0

"Unimpressed! Rye had some serious potential...but I was let down.Food: Meh. Okay, my friend's pork belly was pretty good...and the portion was satisfactory. But my TWENTY-FOUR DOLLAR lasagna was mediocre. It seemed promising at first but I quickly learned that there's way too much cheese. WAAAYY too much. I pretty much ate everything but the cheese. What a waste. The french fries were good though, perfect crispiness.Service: Our waiter had potential. He looked put together, and since he was older, I thought maybe the service here would be different from all the pretentious Burg joints. But no. At first we thought that he was just difficult to read...he wasn't friendly but he wasn't necessarily unfriendly either. But then a group of older people sat next to us, and he did a complete 180 with them! He was so accommodating and friendly with them, it was insane. He actually cracked some jokes and SMILED. What an asshole! We think he was judging us for being the youngest people in the restaurant, as if we were incapable of giving him a good tip or something.Our bill came out to $70+ for an unmemorable meal of 2 entrees, a side of fries, and a glass of wine. Totally not worth it. Maybe we'll come back here when we're 45.",3.0
"Love everything about this place!!! Especially the MEATLOAF SANDWICH! Its HUGE! So big I had to give half of it to my boyfriend. He ordered the pork belly sandwich and finished it with one bite! I ordered a Dylan Temple to drink and it was even better than my favorite Shirley Temple... with a twist! We also ordered some oysters to start, but when we saw the Meatloaf Sandwich, we forgot about everything else. I'm not even hungry right now, but writing this is making me salivate thinking about it!!!Service was good, and so was the atmosphere. The only thing I would fix is the sound system. It had some issues and was making grumbling noises from the speakers.My boyfriend is going to be living a block away from Rye. We will be back more often :)",5.0

"I have no idea why I gave this place four stars initially because it's my most beloved Williamsburg restaurant, so much that I lament constantly about having moved out of the neighborhood. A recent dinner here with eight of my dearest, most beautiful friends amassed over the course of two decades is what ricochets Rye from four to five stars. Here's why:- bartender (I forget his name, but he's a gingery blonde and lived in New Orleans for many years) is an expert in cocktails. Friendly as all heck to boot. He didn't give me any shit when I requested that my ""Southside"" be made with vodka instead of gin, though I felt like a total ass monkey doing so. When my friends arrived to meet me at the bar, all eight of them longingly stared at my drink and then promptly ordered the correct version.- Sazerac. Only 10 fucking dollars. The best cocktail here. I usually start off with two Southsides, as they are quite easily potable, and then I switch off to the rye based drink, as it's much more for savoring (ie: don't dispatch down your throat within seconds of receipt)- service. Our server was friendly and gamely dealt with nine drunks, suggesting some of the best dishes for us. - lobster bisque (a special): oh man. I didn't share with any of my friends. I am a selfish, greedy jerk.- crab croquette. I never skip this tiny, perfectly fried ball of sweet crustacean. It's just enough for three or four bites (again, you could share this, but why bother?) and the richness is offset by a tangle of perfectly dressed greens.- roasted duck breast. Crisp skin, flavorful, a sweet hint running through the flesh.- mac & cheese that easily beats the highly touted version at Dumont (which was good six or seven years ago, but is now really bland and gummy). - roasted lamb shank. If you want to impress your date, get him or her drunk on fat and rich flavors, this is how you do it. (I guarantee you will get laid that night)- meatloaf sandwich. A classic here, and the portion is so large that you could split it with a friend, or have leftovers for the next day. The shoestring fried onions are a fantastic addition.Basically, every neighborhood needs their star bistro, and occasional destination restaurant.

It was indeed delicious, having stolen some off my girlfriend's plate. In fact, it was so delicious that it begged the question why it needed to be served in sandwich form in the first place. -The mac and cheese was also very tasty (yes, I have a tendency to steal from the plates of others) - with a richness and creaminess that represented the height of decadence.-I had the pan roasted Scottish salmon, which was very well-prepared and certainly hit the spot.-For dessert, doughnuts were shared by all diners at the table and two of us shared the banana split. The banana split may have pushed me over the edge for the combination of ice cream, bananas, caramel and nuts was exceedingly rich.

"Excellent cocktails and menu. The food is rich and flavorful, make no mistake - delicious. The cocktails are also top-notch.

The atmosphere (candles, dark wood) compliments the warm and hearty feeling of the food, and I have to say, I DO like coming here.  Only thing that keeps me from being a regular are the prices, which are not that out of range from comparable NYC restaurants (pricey - entrees are between $20 and $30).

The atmosphere (candles, dark wood) compliments the warm and hearty feeling of the food, and I have to say, I DO like coming here.  Only thing that keeps me from being a regular are the prices, which are not that out of range from comparable NYC restaurants (pricey - entrees are between $20 and $30).

"A five star rating should be rare, but looking back on the dinner and brunch at Rye, there's little that missed.  Everything we ordered was perfect pitch.The cocktails are splendid.  I'm a huge Southside aficionado, and make them all summer long at home.  The Rye Southside beats mine. Delicious--must be the hipster gin.The small bites before the meal are good. The crab croquette rocked, and I savored each bite.  The parsley dressing on top brought out the freshness.The endive and pear salad with bleu cheese is remarkable.  I usually treat frisse like parsley and ignore it. But the endive, pecans, cheese and frisse work so well together. I was sorry at the last bite.My beef short rib sandwich with onion spread was quite tasty. Mi  Vida's bacon (actually grilled pork belly) with brussel sprouts was hearty and good, but too fatty for my taste, though it has to be expected from pork belly.The chocolate cake is really more like a budino, and was the perfect end to a wonderful meal. Great coffee as well.Brunch was fabulous. The BLT had the best bacon of my life.  No kidding.  The meatloaf sandwich lives up to the hype.Professional, attentive and pleasant service (though quite hipster with the beards, flannel shirts and unkempt chic).The space is speakeasy classic, with leather banquettes and good lighting.  Frankly, this is a 4.5 star rating, but I can't figure out why not five.  I'll be back often.  Brooklyn has some of the best restaurants in the country.",5.0

"Great cocktails, very solid food and completely reasonable prices actually brought me to Rye for dinner twice within a month.The decor here is what I'd call ""classic old fashioned"" and it's certainly inviting though not overly warm. Take away the wine glasses and there could almost be a wild west vibe, if not for the old, white tiled floor (which does show a little grit). Everything else works together to develop the old fashioned feel... an old bar, wood bar stools and worn tables, exposed lighting, old cabinetry. Rye would be just as good for a date as it would be for a group dinner.My highlight on the drink menu included, unsurprisingly, a ""classic old fashioned"" that I could probably drink all night long, and maybe all day long as well. The Havemeyer cocktail didn't quite do it for me, though perhaps I expected a Manhattan and this is a much fruitier concoction. At $10 apiece, I didn't feel too guilty re-ordering the same drink... in NYC the same cocktails would have gone for $13+. A few good options for beer rounded out the drink selections and laid the groundwork for a good meal.A rather small dinner menu seemed limiting at first, though after two visits here I have found every food item I've eaten to be worth ordering. For appetizers... crab croquettes: great; short rib sandwich: excellent; meatloaf: probably good enough that it could be the basis for its own restaurant. A special ceviche app also hit the spot. Entrees have a hearty feel, and my favorites included the LI duck breast -- which was cooked perfectly and came with cous cous & tomato chutney to make this a great dish -- and the hanger steak: a menu staple that was done right. The meatloaf sandwich could also be eaten as an entree and it was good enough that I nearly ordered a second helping.Service at the bar was good, with a friendly bartender who was happy to talk about how he develops drinks, though table service was hit-or-miss at times. Our waitress on one visit was a little too blase and unattentive, even by Williamsburg standards.Overall impression: when a restaurant provides good ambiance, has solid cocktails for $10, and delicious food that keeps me coming back... well there isn't much else to say, is there?",4.0

"This is my favorite restaurant in Brooklyn.  Amazing food and drink - my mouth waters just thinking about this place.  And their Classic Old Fashioned could be my favorite cocktail ever.However, 1 Old Fashioned on an empty stomach made me kinda loopy to recall the full name of my appetizer - so I was snootily corrected by the waiter to say the whole name - with a full French accent and all.  It totally reminded me of the scene in Blues Brothers with Pee Wee Herman as the waiter.

"So, I will start by saying I really really wanted to do 4-stars, but the hiccups in the initial service made that impossible.

"What a fantastic brunch. Rye benedict, Poached egg and meatloaf sandwich were awesome.  I would love to come back here.  Also the red rooster and the southside are great. it was refreshing twist from the normal drinks out there.",5.0
"A five star rating should be rare, but looking back on the dinner and brunch at Rye, there's little that missed.  Everything we ordered was perfect pitch.The cocktails are splendid.  I'm a huge Southside aficionado, and make them all summer long at home.  The Rye Southside beats mine. Delicious--must be the hipster gin.The small bites before the meal are good. The crab croquette rocked, and I savored each bite.  The parsley dressing on top brought out the freshness.The endive and pear salad with bleu cheese is remarkable.  I usually treat frisse like parsley and ignore it. But the endive, pecans, cheese and frisse work so well together. I was sorry at the last bite.My beef short rib sandwich with onion spread was quite tasty. Mi  Vida's bacon (actually grilled pork belly) with brussel sprouts was hearty and good, but too fatty for my taste, though it has to be expected from pork belly.The chocolate cake is really more like a budino, and was the perfect end to a wonderful meal. Great coffee as well.Brunch was fabulous. The BLT had the best bacon of my life.  No kidding.  The meatloaf sandwich lives up to the hype.Professional, attentive and pleasant service (though quite hipster with the beards, flannel shirts and unkempt chic).The space is speakeasy classic, with leather banquettes and good lighting.  Frankly, this is a 4.5 star rating, but I can't figure out why not five.  I'll be back often.  Brooklyn has some of the best restaurants in the country.",5.0
"Outstanding. Best mac and cheese I have ever had. The monk fish, which is what I had for my entree, was perfectly paired with bacon pieces, oysters, fingerling potatoes in this creamy broth and it was all amazing. I think of this place as a special occasion restaurant, as it can get pricey but it was totally worth it.",5.0
"Great cocktails, very solid food and completely reasonable prices actually brought me to Rye for dinner twice within a month.The decor here is what I'd call ""classic old fashioned"" and it's certainly inviting though not overly warm. Take away the wine glasses and there could almost be a wild west vibe, if not for the old, white tiled floor (which does show a little grit). Everything else works together to develop the old fashioned feel... an old bar, wood bar stools and worn tables, exposed lighting, old cabinetry. Rye would be just as good for a date as it would be for a group dinner.My highlight on the drink menu included, unsurprisingly, a ""classic old fashioned"" that I could probably drink all night long, and maybe all day long as well. The Havemeyer cocktail didn't quite do it for me, though perhaps I expected a Manhattan and this is a much fruitier concoction. At $10 apiece, I didn't feel too guilty re-ordering the same drink... in NYC the same cocktails would have gone for $13+. A few good options for beer rounded out the drink selections and laid the groundwork for a good meal.A rather small dinner menu seemed limiting at first, though after two visits here I have found every food item I've eaten to be worth ordering. For appetizers... crab croquettes: great; short rib sandwich: excellent; meatloaf: probably good enough that it could be the basis for its own restaurant. A special ceviche app also hit the spot. Entrees have a hearty feel, and my favorites included the LI duck breast -- which was cooked perfectly and came with cous cous & tomato chutney to make this a great dish -- and the hanger steak: a menu staple that was done right. The meatloaf sandwich could also be eaten as an entree and it was good enough that I nearly ordered a second helping.Service at the bar was good, with a friendly bartender who was happy to talk about how he develops drinks, though table service was hit-or-miss at times. Our waitress on one visit was a little too blase and unattentive, even by Williamsburg standards.Overall impression: when a restaurant provides good ambiance, has solid cocktails for $10, and delicious food that keeps me coming back... well there isn't much else to say, is there?",4.0
Nice charming place. Great brunch and friendly service.,4.0
"This is my favorite restaurant in Brooklyn.  Amazing food and drink - my mouth waters just thinking about this place.  And their Classic Old Fashioned could be my favorite cocktail ever.However, 1 Old Fashioned on an empty stomach made me kinda loopy to recall the full name of my appetizer - so I was snootily corrected by the waiter to say the whole name - with a full French accent and all.  It totally reminded me of the scene in Blues Brothers with Pee Wee Herman as the waiter. Besides that, everything else was incredibly awesome.",5.0

"What a find! Nestled on a little residential street, Rye has become one of my favorite Williamsburg spots after just one visit. My date and I couldn't get a seat at nearby Traif, so we walked a few blocks north to this spot and were seated immediately on a weekend at 8pm. Not bad. The decor is like a rustic/prohibition era bar; and the service is fantastic. Our waiter described the specials in amazing detail- and we ended up ordering most of them. His descriptions of the wines were incredible; I knew exactly what I was ordering and absolutely loved my selection. My date and I had the smoked ribs for an appetizer and they were fall-off-the-bone, melt-in-your-mouth good. We both got fish entrees and I would order mine every time I come back if I could: a bacon-wrapped sole filet with cauliflower puree & kale. It tasted decadent and hearty while being pretty darn healthy and light. The donut dessert was the only miss for me. It just tasted like deep fried pieces of regular cake... which just tasted dry and uninspired. The caramel dip was good but not worth ordering again. That being said, I'll definitely come here again if I'm looking for a place to eat in Williamsburg. Fantastic food, service, drinks, atmosphere, and company.",4.0

Nevertheless, I was able to opt out where I wanted, and still had good choices, albeit fewer of them. The brunch cocktails are original and plucky. Well, at least I felt plucky after consuming them. I had sips of a few, and would recommend the Buck's Fizz and the Retox.  Gracious service.Better to eat and drink at Rye on a cold, cloudy day, in which case it feels homey and cozy inside. Coming back out into the sun after a couple hours in here made me feel like a mole re-entering the outside world after a long, dark snooze. Not entirely unpleasant, but if it's a bright Sunday (my one day off), I'd rather sit outside -- or be able to see outside.",4.0
"This place is great. I think it's got some of the best cocktails in the area, and in interior is nicely lit (albeit a touch cliche, EDISON BULBS!)---but you know what? Screw it, Edison Bulbs have a nice light! I'm standing by them!Anyhow, great drinks and the food! The food is getting better and better. Tasty Chicken and Lamb and Steak and all the good things you want on a cold winter's eve. But honestly, you can't beat the meatloaf sandwich with homemade pickles, for only 14 bucks and its' pretty GIANT. So effing yum. Lastly, one of the best elements about this place is that I never have to wait for a table. It's comfortably full but there always seems to be some space to seat you which is the BEST. No crowded uncomfortable waiting, just sit down, relax and enjoy yourself. Service is fine. No smiles or anything to remember, but whatever.MEATLOAF SANDWICH DREAMZZZZZ",4.0
"Finally came here for brunch.  And it was tasty.  The stuffed french toast really was a remarkable dish.  Sweet and savory and really just kind of perfect.  I also had the painkiller cocktail, which was good, but sort of an afterthought compared to the awesome food choice.Everyone else's looked awesome too.  Even the coffee was delish.  And the service was great too.It was cramped and loud, normal Sunday brunch crowd, and it's definitely on the splurg-ier side for brunch, price-wise, but otherwise I can't wait to come back and try more of their stuff.  Really very good.",4.0
"So, this place is in my top 3 favorite places in Brooklyn and probably top 5 for NYC.  The seafood dishes that they serve are bangin'.  I got the monkfish and my partner got the skate.  So much flavor, great combinations of seasonal ingredients, and just delicious.  The service is great too.  I couldn't decide between two wines and the waiter brought over a taste of both, not like that is worth the good service merit it was just nice and surprising that I didn't have to ask for it; the waiter offered.  Also, we ordered the two types of oysters that they were offering that night...they were awesome.I would disagree with the Restaurant Girl's review of the striped bass.(restaurantgirl.com/cuisi…).  I think that dish has great flavors and is embedded in my memory as the best sea bass I have ever had.",5.0

"Rye may be a New American restaurant first, but it's bar should not be overlooked. Drinks are a bit cheaper out here at 10 per, but the bar is not as well stocked as some of the places in Manhattan, or Dutch Kills for that matter. But again, this is a restaurant first and the quality of what they have is great.Try the Blood and Smoke, it's earthy, complex and smoooooth.Oh, great food too and pretty damn good prices.3.5 Starsyelp.com/list/best-cockt…",4.0
"I love this place! My girlfriend discovered this piece of alcoholic and gastronomical Eden with her bff a little over a year ago.  The drinks here are classic yet creative and are always perfectly mixed. I often find myself grabbing dinner at the bar after arriving with zero advance notice and the staff is always wonderfully accommodating.  The bartender is well-versed in his art and has no affect but good humor and interest in making a splendid drink and a happy customer.On to the food: I shared the grass-fed rib-eye with fleur de sel and bordelaise with a most particular connoisseur and we were thoroughly impressed! I must have it again, if only I can convince another person to join!Update: I have found another connoisseur and the rib-eye will be once again consumed...this time with a pitcher of old-fashioned.",5.0
"Nice atmosphere and good solid food options. It's easy to walk by the restaurant, but that just adds to the low-key vibe with lots of dark wood and low lighting.Service was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  I loved all the fancy cocktails.  Try the Reposado with homemade ginger beer.  I enjoyed the crab croquettes and the beet salad was beautifully presented.  For my entree, the whole fish was huge.  I'm a big eater and I had trouble finishing it along with the fingerling potatoes and asparagus.  But, the highlight of the meal is dessert. You must get the warm lemon cake.  Normally, I shy away from most cakes because I think they are usually boring.  However, this warm lemon cake was delicious.  And you must get an after dinner drink.  The milk punch with brandy was delicious and a dessert in itself.",4.0
"This place is just plain old gorgeous and the food was outstanding. We were visiting from Mpls, MN and staying in Soho. Rye was about a $10 cab ride if you don't want to do the subway. We had no reservations and the hostess found a cozy spot for us as soon as one was available. Our wait at the bar was worth it.Such beautiful appointments in the design...incredible detail. Beyond that, the food was memorable and delightful. Cocktails were impeccable. Service was about as good as it gets. We will be back on our next trip.",5.0
"I went to Rye a week ago with my boyfriend, using a 30% off coupon we got from Blackboard Eats.  I'd recently read a review of the place in NY Mag, and wanted to give it a try.  After nearly walking past the front door due to its austere dark wood and frosted glass front, we stepped inside for an early dinner.  The decor reminds me of the simple, scrubbed and charming interior of a dining room in the only hotel in town in a old Western film -- there's a different set of antique salt and pepper shakers and mixed silverware on the tables, and everything is pretty much dark brown woods and white linens.  We were greeted and seated immediately (we were some of the first to arrive for dinner that night, but even as the place filled up, I never saw people ignored at the door), and thus began one of the best dining experiences we've had in a while.  Our waiter was extremely friendly and knowledgable about the menu, and gave his recommendations based on his personal dining experience when we asked.  I ordered a special of the night: lime-cured and then grilled ceviche with citrus, and my boyfriend had a braised short rib sandwich and the handcut fries.  We also split two plates (12 in all) of eastcoast oysters, and sampled 2 cocktails each from Rye's creative cocktail list.  All was scrumptious!  For dessert we ordered the donuts (a nice old fashioned cake donut) with vanilla ice cream, and a Brandy Milk Punch to go with it.  Really delicious, and perfect for a hot summer night.  All in all, I don't have a bad thing to say about Rye, and my boyfriend and I have vowed to go back enough times to try everything on the menu.",5.0
"The food here is solid enough to warrant another trip. The duck was especially tasty. For the drink I had an old fashion that tasted pretty much perfect, strong enough to catch the full bourbon flavor with a sweet finish and no burn. The decor is great although the seating for two is cramped, on top of your neighbors makes conversation challenging. My only other complaint is an easy fix, I am pretty sure our waitress has gingivitis as her breath was a little over powering. I will be back, just hope our waitress is chewing gum next time.",4.0

"I went to Rye per a recommendation of a co worker and decided to bring my GF for her bday. First impression walking in was the classic Williamsburg hipster decor with dim lighting, presumably reused wood and antique looking art/ table settings/ silverware & furniture. The bartenders had the classic ""I'm cooler than you"" look with the required facial hair and silly ties to match. The hostess resembled a ghost straight out of American Horror Story. Is it a requirement for all the staff to have that undead ghostly pale look that seems all the rage in places like this? Upon being seated in a Bankhead booth we were quickly approached by our lovely waitress for the evening. We decided to try the Old Fashioned since Rye is the signature drink. Pretty stiff cocktail to say the least. We ordered the Mac n cheese w bacon to start and was very impressed with the dish (takes about 20 minutes to prepare). Boiling hot and enough to share with 2-3 people w/ nice thick pieces of bacon. For my entree I chose the signature meatloaf sandwich for $16. It was amazing. A HUGE sandwich enough for 2 people. It is served on a ciabatta like roll with homemade slaw and fried onions. I definitely recommend this sandwich. I also ordered a side of fries as well (probably not necessary since the sandwich is so large). They we're cooked to perfection! My gf ordered the roasted chicken entree with mushroom risotto for $26. It was fall off the bone delicious w/ 2 large, moist pieces of chicken served with flavorful risotto and butternut squash.The service from our waitress was great, she was very knowledgeable about the menu and the establishment and the food was amazing, well worth the price. Only reason for the 4 stars and not 5 is the price points are a bit high and the menu leans towards the heavier dishes (ALOT of meat). Also, no burger on the menu which is a surprise, not a knock tho since the meatloaf sandwich fills the void nicely. I'd recommend Rye to anyone willing to pay for the quality and looking for a nice night out.",4.0
"!!!!!! Delicious. Went for the first time ever on a date last night. We got there around 7pm on a Thursday night and there was lots of seating available. We sat at the front table which is a corner padded bench seat (you can cozy up and sit next to your date!) The dark wooded bar and furniture were elegant.I started out with a Reposado Shrub drink. Raspberry, homemade Ginger beer, tequila, goodness. This man can bartend. My date knew the bartender and told me he prepares a lot of his own  items for the cocktails. We ordered a drink no longer on their menu, the Hemingway. It was a glass of super sweet, limey/rum flavored goodness. I also had an Apple Jack Smash which was a bit more savory with a combo of Triplesec, peach, lemon, and mint. For dinner I ordered an appetizer as I wasn't feeling overly ravenous. The Duck Confit... AMAZING. I can still taste it. A very tasty, moist, soft, fall of the bone duck leg over a lentil/cream/spinach/beat mixture. Oh my. amazing.My date had the ravioli special - homemade cheese raviolis in a cream sauce that was absolutely to die for.",5.0
"I loved Rye. The cocktails were awesome and their entrees were enticing and made it hard to decide what to get because everything looked good. I'm a huge fan of places that try to make great food but stay creative as well and that's what I take home from Rye. After living in the West Village before coming back to Williamsburg, I can say that this place is on Par if not even better than a lot of the same style restaurants in the West Village but without the Village markup. The service was also really good, they took a little while getting our food out, but they we're very forthcoming about it.",5.0

For the meal I got the mac and cheese to start which was sublime with pieces of tasty pork something or other. So rich but so good. I entreed with the Pork Duo, which was porkbellies and pork tenderloin. Both were expertly prepared.

"Oh Williamsburg... first dude I saw coming in here had a beard that was down to the middle of his chest. Came here for drinks the other night and had a really nice time. The space is really beautiful with dark wood throughout. It has a kind of a speakeasy vibe, which I love, but it was kind of annoying to just grab a drink here as it is definitely more of a restaurant than a bar.It might be fun to come at like 11:30 or something for a drink after the kitchen has closed, but if you just want a drink, grab a seat at the bar as opposed to a table.The drinks were really nice, though $9 as the cheapest glass of wine on the menu is a little nuts for Williamsburg. I'd definitely come back either late for a drink or for dinner.",4.0
"I didn't even know this gem existed until a Billyburg friend brought us by the other night. What a pleasant surprise: a nice neighborhood spot that is thoughtfully designed with good drinks, food and service. Imagine that.We all started our meals with a cocktail. Mine, their take on a Margarita was excellent, dangerously smooth with the ideal balance of sweet and tart. I ordered the quail and it was the perfect portion for a late night snack - well-seasoned and expertly prepared with a side of smooth and delicate spoonbread. The boys at the table shared a bone-in ribeye. My husband was wary that the grass fed beef would be lacking in the richness he expects in his beef, so the server brought out the raw steak to show him the marbling - a nice touch. It came out expertly cooked and we all shared a side of broccoli rabe and mac and cheese. The mac and cheese is a must order - one of the best I've had.For dessert we split the maple creme brulee - a well done version of this popular item with the maple adding a hint of interest to make it memorable. I would definitely go back to Rye for dinner or just drinks the vibe is great and the food is tasty AND well-priced to boot.",4.0
"When we first tried Rye, we had heard that A) it had an incredible vibe, and B) they made a great old-fashioned.  While these are both true, what really sets Rye apart is the food and the service. We have had incredible meals there with friends and family and also spent our valentines there two years in a row.  Not every place can be great for a group hang and date night, but Rye is just that kind of place.Old fashioned- do it!  How do they make those amazing ice cubes?Oysters- You'd think Rye was on the wharfMeatloaf sandwich- this is not cafeteria food, this is decadence.Donuts and Ice Cream- Need I say more?-Patrick(I'm sharing a yelp account with my two band members Lisa and Syd as we tour the country and try to eat and live healthy while we drive thousands of miles in a van.

"Lovely food, AMAZING cocktails. The Classic Old Fashioned is the best version I've had, period, and others we tried weren't far behind. The kitchen has a sure hand with fish as well as with heavier, meatier dishes, and careful thought seems to go into even the smallest choices. The housemade pickles that frequently pop up as a foil to some of the richer menu items are a delicious example of this attention to detail.

"What a wonderful experience. On a quite residential street was a discrete door that opened into a warm large room with filled with diners. It seemed like people were flocking from all areas to have dinner here. We were seated right away (love that about Brooklyn). Started with the Southside coctail, which I have to say is one of my favorite drinks ever. Gin, cucumber, lime, mint and a bit of soda water. Yum! Also had the duck confit tartine. Huge portion. I'd recommend sharing it, but I ate it all. Had the cod for my entree. Very fresh and flakey and flavorful. Service was spot on. Everyone work as a team, dishes were timed perfectly (I hate getting my entree when I'm still working on my app and there's no room on the table!), service was attentive.

"Oh Williamsburg... first dude I saw coming in here had a beard that was down to the middle of his chest. Came here for drinks the other night and had a really nice time. The space is really beautiful with dark wood throughout. It has a kind of a speakeasy vibe, which I love, but it was kind of annoying to just grab a drink here as it is definitely more of a restaurant than a bar.It might be fun to come at like 11:30 or something for a drink after the kitchen has closed, but if you just want a drink, grab a seat at the bar as opposed to a table.The drinks were really nice, though $9 as the cheapest glass of wine on the menu is a little nuts for Williamsburg. I'd definitely come back either late for a drink or for dinner.",4.0
"I didn't even know this gem existed until a Billyburg friend brought us by the other night. What a pleasant surprise: a nice neighborhood spot that is thoughtfully designed with good drinks, food and service. Imagine that.We all started our meals with a cocktail. Mine, their take on a Margarita was excellent, dangerously smooth with the ideal balance of sweet and tart. I ordered the quail and it was the perfect portion for a late night snack - well-seasoned and expertly prepared with a side of smooth and delicate spoonbread. The boys at the table shared a bone-in ribeye. My husband was wary that the grass fed beef would be lacking in the richness he expects in his beef, so the server brought out the raw steak to show him the marbling - a nice touch. It came out expertly cooked and we all shared a side of broccoli rabe and mac and cheese. The mac and cheese is a must order - one of the best I've had.For dessert we split the maple creme brulee - a well done version of this popular item with the maple adding a hint of interest to make it memorable. I would definitely go back to Rye for dinner or just drinks the vibe is great and the food is tasty AND well-priced to boot.",4.0
"When we first tried Rye, we had heard that A) it had an incredible vibe, and B) they made a great old-fashioned.  While these are both true, what really sets Rye apart is the food and the service. We have had incredible meals there with friends and family and also spent our valentines there two years in a row.  Not every place can be great for a group hang and date night, but Rye is just that kind of place.Old fashioned- do it!  How do they make those amazing ice cubes?Oysters- You'd think Rye was on the wharfMeatloaf sandwich- this is not cafeteria food, this is decadence.Donuts and Ice Cream- Need I say more?-Patrick(I'm sharing a yelp account with my two band members Lisa and Syd as we tour the country and try to eat and live healthy while we drive thousands of miles in a van.

"Lovely food, AMAZING cocktails. The Classic Old Fashioned is the best version I've had, period, and others we tried weren't far behind. The kitchen has a sure hand with fish as well as with heavier, meatier dishes, and careful thought seems to go into even the smallest choices. The housemade pickles that frequently pop up as a foil to some of the richer menu items are a delicious example of this attention to detail.

"It's an easy task to get five stars when you serve the most delicious cocktail ever.  Yes, look no further: the Southside is amazing.Ok, I only came here for drinks, so the five stars is a little hyperbolic, but my enthusiasm for the Southside isn't.  It's a magic concoction, brewed from gin, cucumbers, lime juice, a little mint....went down easy and left room for about ten more (which I did NOT have, though I wanted to).The place was empty at eight-ish on a Monday, but the service at the bar was amiable and efficient, and the place is a joy to sit in.  The dark wood, big bar mirror, and other little touches make it feel, yes, like a speakeasy of sorts, which is always exciting.Perhaps if I get a spike in income, I'll go back for dinner.  My friends stayed on and wouldn't stop talking about some fig salad....so, you know, I'll probably have to test their word on that.Give me another Southside.",5.0

"If you are looking for unique taste experience, try the smoked Sturgeon over potatoes.  Its perfectly plated with thyme, onions,quail egg and (get this) sturgeon caviar.  This taste of this absolutely pop in your mouth.  I know my way around a smoker and I immediately guessed that the smoking of the fish took place in house.  The server confirmed.  I will go again and try the Duck Breast.  The girl next to us was having it and raved about it.  She managed to eat every grain of the cous cous that it was served with...I've not seen anyone do that.!!!  Service is just ok....drink prices are a bit manhattany in price.  However, this place is comfy and good looking and I shall see it again",3.0
"Warm, courteous service, great value and superb taste.  Food with integrity.  We shared a 33 oz steak done to perfection.  The brussels sprouts and creamed spinach are delightful.  Good wine list reasonably priced and generously served.  Cocktail menu seemed swell, too.",5.0
"Highly recommended! After having brunch at Rye a few times, I used a coupon to check out their dinner menu.  Had the monk fish, which was heavenly.  Great sauce and a delicious blend of flavors that was rich without being over-the-top.Side veggies (Brussels sprouts and spinach) were both very good.Also had a delicious spicy beer-based cocktail with white rum and lime. Yum!Overall, spendy but very high quality, a great date spot.  The dinner is better than the very-good brunch options.",4.0
"It's an easy task to get five stars when you serve the most delicious cocktail ever.  Yes, look no further: the Southside is amazing.Ok, I only came here for drinks, so the five stars is a little hyperbolic, but my enthusiasm for the Southside isn't.  It's a magic concoction, brewed from gin, cucumbers, lime juice, a little mint....went down easy and left room for about ten more (which I did NOT have, though I wanted to).The place was empty at eight-ish on a Monday, but the service at the bar was amiable and efficient, and the place is a joy to sit in.  The dark wood, big bar mirror, and other little touches make it feel, yes, like a speakeasy of sorts, which is always exciting.Perhaps if I get a spike in income, I'll go back for dinner.  My friends stayed on and wouldn't stop talking about some fig salad....so, you know, I'll probably have to test their word on that.Give me another Southside.",5.0
"This place has a lot of style. Silver serving pieces, real china(mismatched but adorable), but most importantly the food was fantastic! The host was a total cutiepie with his mismatched patterns and tucked in tie. Bartender was adorable too. Our waiter didn't have much personality and I could barely hear him, but it didn't matter, because everything else was perfect....amazing brunch, can't wait to go back for dinner.",5.0
"A delightful surprise out of Billyburg. Reasonably priced for a group. Started the evening out right mixing a mean Makers Manhattan with a fresh cherry. Beet salad fresh and refreshing. A sandwich made with the best meatloaf I've ever had (duck, veal, shortribs??? Whoa). And a mac n cheese that beat my wife's. Sorry hon.Dang Rye. We'll be back.",4.0
"Came here with a group of friends for a weeknight dinner.  We made reservations, but probably didn't need them.  Tasty cocktails - I had the Southside, which is clean and cucumber-y and nice for the summer- but it was a hard decision with lots of good-looking options.We shared a bunch of plates so that we could each try a bit of everything.  The scallops and duck confit were the stars, but the beet salad and crab croquettes were good too.  Seemed like you really couldn't go wrongAll in all- great food, nice atmosphere, definitely recommended.",5.0

I had never had meatloaf until I came to Rye, but so many people have raved about it that I had to try it, and seriously - they're not lying or exaggerating. The roasted chicken: one of the best I've tried, better than dumont or dressler. The Rye Benedict: HOLY MOLY. It's the most rich, delicious, rich, incredibly tasting benedict I've ever had. I'm glad Rye isn't required to post calorie counts because I don't even want to know, on this dish especially. Poached eggs + crispy pork belly + buttermilk biscuit + hollandaise.... Enough said.

"Rye is a whole new level of luscious.  Yes, other places have charted the Prohibition-era American traditional cuisine with classic cocktails course, but Rye rocks the hell out of it.The Havemeyer Cocktail?  Tasty, Manhattan-like, & fulfilling.  The Improved Tequila Cocktail?  Intriguing and indulgent.  The Southside?  Crisp and refreshing.  The short rib terrine?  Perfect blend of flavors, rich and crisp falling on top of each other.  The pork belly? Oh my god, yes.Give me more give me more give me more give me more.I don't care that they don't take credit cards.  I don't care that it shows that they're not fully up and running just yet.  I don't care that the hostess got up from her meal with her table of 8 to greet us and direct us to the bar.  Rye just vaulted itself into my personal top favorite places to eat in Williamsburg and I expect for it to stay there quite some time.",5.0
"Had some of the best food and best service - I mean the best service - I've had since dining at Jean-George last year.  Didn't hurt that I had what might have been one of the best tables in the house, but there seem to be a lot of really good ones.  Romantic, delicious, and I highly recommend it.",5.0
"I took a few of my best friends and my boyfriend to Rye after having finished my screenplay I had been working on for 2 years. It was a very special occasion for me, and I couldn't have picked a more perfect place. I took them there as a 'thank you' for helping me and putting up with my lameness of never being able to go out, and by the end of the night they were thanking me like crazy.  We ate so much food: the short rib terrine appetizer was incredible, as was the artichoke stew (which is not really a stew at all but amazing nonetheless), the grilled quail, the grilled pork belly, the sardines, the chocolate cake, and the lemon cake.Although the chocolate cake was the ubiquitous molten chocolate cake, it was still out of this world; one of the best I've ever had.The least favorite dishes of the night were the wild striped bass, which my friend said was bland, and the crab croquette, which my other friend said was good, but not as great as the other food. That's a pretty good track record right there.The drinks were good too, but overall I liked the food better.This place is not cheap, especially when you are picking up the tab for a group of people (but that doesn't happen very often, at least not for me). And although they don't take credit cards, this place is sooo worth it.  Our waitress was so nice, and put up with us ordering at all different times. The whole staff was super attentive and made our night one to remember. Thank you Rye for such a good night.",4.0
"I really love this place. The decor is so beautiful, music not too loud, service attentive and not pushy. The details like the marble top table, vintage salt and pepper shakers, and utensils were a nice touch. The food was good and satisfying. I had the cheese plate ($15) which came with portions just big enough for one person and a few slices of delicious toasted bread. I also had the crab croquette ($6) which I split with my friend who got the summer pasta ($16). I had two glasses of white wine and my friend a beer and our bill was a decent $66. I will definitely be back.",4.0
"I have been going here pretty regularly for the past few months. With so many restaurants in Williamsburg fitting the ""I want to be different like everyone else mold"" this place really stands out. I feel they have one of the best bartenders in the city who makes incredible drinks and the food is nothing short of great. A very simple menu done extremely well.

"I loved the vibe as soon as I walked in, and our waiter was pleasantly attentive and very nice.  (looked like he had a few terminal degrees under his belt)   We got there at 7 and by the time our food arrived, the place was packed.  Gone in with a hankering for oysters, but the price (M/P) stopped us in our tracks.  ($3.75/oyster-ouch!!)  So we started with grilled quail and one of  the specials- lobster bisque.  Bisque should go on the menu, but the sauce the quail came in was way too sweet and overpowering.  For entrees we had the monkfish wrapped in prosciutto and another special - lamb shank.  The fish was dry, tasteless and small.  The lamb was huge and delicious.  I'd order it again if it was on the menu....For desert we split the chocolate cake with ice cream.  It was totally standard fare - I've had that very molten cake at a dozen restaurants.  My verdict?  They should put the specials on the menu, revisit the deserts to come up with more unique sweets, and get rid of the fruit flies that were all over the wall next to us!  Oh... and is there a reason that there is absolutely nothing on the walls?  No antique mirrors, no period paintings or old photographs...  Maybe it's to give their pet flies more room to move around.",3.0
I can't help but enjoy asking the waiter or waitress what dish they would pick when needing help narrowing the decision down and the waiter confidently answers! He said the doughnuts and he couldn't be more right! They were delicious among the rest of our food. Love the design of the space as well.,4.0
"Very friendly service and great design and atmosphere. Unfortunately when we went though the menu sounded great on paper the food was so-so and not worth the price. Caveat - it was on Valentines Day. The drinks are superb, and as a bar this would be a 4 star review",3.0
"Oysters, Meatloaf and Whiskey, oh my... Rye has certainly caught my eye. The prices are reasonable, the fare delectable and the drinks quenching. My friends and I shared a plate of local oysters, and washed it down with one of the best mint juleps I've had in my life. Afterward we noshed on the meatloaf sandwich, baked ravioli, short rib sandwich and beet salad, and left full and happy. Our waitress was attentive, and our glasses were never empty. Rye is a true Brooklyn gem.",4.0
"Rye is a whole new level of luscious.  Yes, other places have charted the Prohibition-era American traditional cuisine with classic cocktails course, but Rye rocks the hell out of it.The Havemeyer Cocktail?  Tasty, Manhattan-like, & fulfilling.  The Improved Tequila Cocktail?  Intriguing and indulgent.  The Southside?  Crisp and refreshing.  The short rib terrine?  Perfect blend of flavors, rich and crisp falling on top of each other.  The pork belly? Oh my god, yes.Give me more give me more give me more give me more.I don't care that they don't take credit cards.  I don't care that it shows that they're not fully up and running just yet.  I don't care that the hostess got up from her meal with her table of 8 to greet us and direct us to the bar.  Rye just vaulted itself into my personal top favorite places to eat in Williamsburg and I expect for it to stay there quite some time.",5.0
"Had some of the best food and best service - I mean the best service - I've had since dining at Jean-George last year.  Didn't hurt that I had what might have been one of the best tables in the house, but there seem to be a lot of really good ones.  Romantic, delicious, and I highly recommend it.",5.0
"I took a few of my best friends and my boyfriend to Rye after having finished my screenplay I had been working on for 2 years. It was a very special occasion for me, and I couldn't have picked a more perfect place. I took them there as a 'thank you' for helping me and putting up with my lameness of never being able to go out, and by the end of the night they were thanking me like crazy.  We ate so much food: the short rib terrine appetizer was incredible, as was the artichoke stew (which is not really a stew at all but amazing nonetheless), the grilled quail, the grilled pork belly, the sardines, the chocolate cake, and the lemon cake.Although the chocolate cake was the ubiquitous molten chocolate cake, it was still out of this world; one of the best I've ever had.The least favorite dishes of the night were the wild striped bass, which my friend said was bland, and the crab croquette, which my other friend said was good, but not as great as the other food. That's a pretty good track record right there.The drinks were good too, but overall I liked the food better.This place is not cheap, especially when you are picking up the tab for a group of people (but that doesn't happen very often, at least not for me). And although they don't take credit cards, this place is sooo worth it.  Our waitress was so nice, and put up with us ordering at all different times. The whole staff was super attentive and made our night one to remember. Thank you Rye for such a good night.",4.0
"I really love this place. The decor is so beautiful, music not too loud, service attentive and not pushy. The details like the marble top table, vintage salt and pepper shakers, and utensils were a nice touch. The food was good and satisfying. I had the cheese plate ($15) which came with portions just big enough for one person and a few slices of delicious toasted bread. I also had the crab croquette ($6) which I split with my friend who got the summer pasta ($16). I had two glasses of white wine and my friend a beer and our bill was a decent $66. I will definitely be back.",4.0
"I have been going here pretty regularly for the past few months. With so many restaurants in Williamsburg fitting the ""I want to be different like everyone else mold"" this place really stands out. I feel they have one of the best bartenders in the city who makes incredible drinks and the food is nothing short of great. A very simple menu done extremely well.

"My first Yelp review, and I had to comment on Rye first.i love this place. Atmosphere is awesome, service is great.On to the food/drink.Started with an Old Fashioned, which seemed fitting given the Prohibition-esque style of the place. It was delicious, perfectly proportioned, the whole bit.We started with some oysters and the beet salad. The oysters were fresh and the salad perfectly dressed. Moved on to the chicken, and my date had the mushroom lasagna. I have to say that I never order chicken. Seems boring and kind of dumb to go to a good place and not order fish or beef. My date happened to be vegetarian, so I figured I would get the least insulting meat on the menu, since he was already opting for the veggie dish. That said, the chicken was fantastic. Juicy, tender, perfectly cooked. If I'm going to order chicken, I want it to be like that. I had a taste of the lasagna as well, which was pretty delicious.We ended with the hot butternut rum. Also delicious.There really wasn't a bad or remotely off element to this meal. Had a fabulous time and will no doubt be back.",5.0
"A group of 8 of us came here for a birthday dinner last night and it was a really great experience all around. Our waiter was incredibly knowledgeable about the food, the preparation and it's origins, as well as patient with such a large group. I wanted to try one of everything on the menu, but settled for the Scotch Eggs and Rye Meatloaf, both of which exceeded my expectations. I love my grandmother, but her meatloaf was always on the dry side. This meatloaf however, was drizzled in an amazing sauce, making it so juicy and delicious. Our group all varied in our orders, so I tried the mac n' cheese which was insanely decadent. It might be too much on it's own, but great for a split side. This place is very meat heavy, so probably not the best spot for vegetarians. For drinks, our table split an Old Fashioned bottle (really, they have bottles of old fashioneds) which was probably not enough for all 8 of us. In addition, we all ordered a few rounds of the $6 shot & beer special. It came out to a little less than a pint of beer, but you can chose from any selection they have on tap. All in all, I thought this place was well priced for the quality of food and drink.",5.0
"Expected more. Purposely held off while the former chef of Dumont and Dressler worked out the kinks, but it still seems to be missing the basics. First, our wait was an hour and a half. If I weren't watching the inefficiencies of the staff, I could have been more patient. Table turn was slow with credit cards collecting dust on tables and the seating strategy was flawed and slow as well. Thought we could chill out at the bar but the wait was spilling onto the street so we left to visit a neighboring bar for a drink. When we finally did get seated, we were delighted that we got upgraded from the 2 top they were going to squeeze the 3 of us into and got a perfect 4 top in the back. We ordered mac and cheese to start but it came out with the meals. It was more like mac and cheese soup and although a variation of the famous Dumont mac, it was runny and easy to abandon. Two of us ordered the skate, which was light and delicious, also different from the Dumont version. My friend ordered the short rib sandwich which was good if not petite, especially compared to the giant bowl of fries that over powered the table. Water service was prompt which made the wait seem even more outrageous, as in, if more people were focused on turning tables than aggressively filling water glasses, it could have been better. The music went from perfect to weird, ranging from Otis Redding to The White Stripes which seemed the throw the vibe back and forth. We went ahead and ordered the fried donuts and ice cream, which were as good as the hype, I suppose. Service overall was mediocre but not offensive. Overall: Food was good but not worth the wait. I'd like to see more vegetable experimentation and more diversity from the Dumont staples. It's heavy on the meat. I am not a vegetarian but I couldn't order the popular meatloaf sandwich made of veal, duck, and some other kind of meat without wading through some moral hesitation, but I have heard it is amazing. The biggest issue was management strategy , and the macaroni soup. I might be likely to try it again after some time has passed, but for now it's a thumbs down.",2.0

"I had the most amazing night at Rye last night. My boyfriend and I were looking to have a special dinner and decided to head over to Rye. We arrived at 8:30 on a Saturday night- we were told it was a 45-1 hour wait for a table. We were trying to decide if we could wait that long as we both were starving. We gave our name one of the hostesses told us that she was about to seat a party of 4 that were at the corner spot of the bar. We headed to the bar and we able to get their seats. This made me very happy as we decided to just eat at the bar. We ordered the well fleet Oysters to start, they were amazing. I was a little hesitant because they did not have much of a selection but the ones they offered, delivered.  We both had the Havemeyer cocktail- it was sweet and earthy and excellently balanced. I loved watching the bartender making drink magic behind the bar. For our entree we had the ribeye  for 2. We were able to select the size they ran from 36-54 onces. Once we chose the size the steak was brought out from the kitchen for our approval.. this was such a great touch.  We were so excited for our steak! When it arrived it could have not have been better! We ordered the side of spinach and homemade french fries. Everything was perfectly delicious and the service was top notch.  I would highly recommend Rye for a night out. I Love this place.",5.0
"The atmosphere at Rye is lovely and the menu has potential. Everything we ate was very good, but I have to smack the place for the high prices and the anxious table turnover-oriented service. There is no reason for a few slices of beet and green apple with smears of goat cheese and baby lettuce to be $12. That's ridiculous. Same for the house smoked sturgeon. There was a paper thin tiny sliver of sturgeon beneath a mountain of frisee. Honestly, I would hardly have known. As far as I could see the sturgeon was there merely to give the slightest hint of smoky fish, and I do mean slight. The fish entree was great but again, not $30 wonderful.More importantly, the waitstaff had us in and out of there in barely an hour. They pulled our appetizer dishes before we were done. The waiter made it clear that we weren't sufficiently high yield by asking repeatedly if we wanted more drinks. It was a massive rush from start to finish. Unnecessary especially given that we'd sat down at 6:30p and, I bet they'd be able to turn that table over 2 more times.",2.0

We arrived at 8:30 on a Saturday night- we were told it was a 45-1 hour wait for a table. We were trying to decide if we could wait that long as we both were starving. We gave our name one of the hostesses told us that she was about to seat a party of 4 that were at the corner spot of the bar. We headed to the bar and we able to get their seats. This made me very happy as we decided to just eat at the bar. We ordered the well fleet Oysters to start, they were amazing. I was a little hesitant because they did not have much of a selection but the ones they offered, delivered.  We both had the Havemeyer cocktail- it was sweet and earthy and excellently balanced. I loved watching the bartender making drink magic behind the bar. For our entree we had the ribeye  for 2. We were able to select the size they ran from 36-54 onces. Once we chose the size the steak was brought out from the kitchen for our approval.. this was such a great touch.  We were so excited for our steak! When it arrived it could have not have been better! We ordered the side of spinach and homemade french fries. Everything was perfectly delicious and the service was top notch.  I would highly recommend Rye for a night out. I Love this place.",5.0
"The atmosphere at Rye is lovely and the menu has potential. Everything we ate was very good, but I have to smack the place for the high prices and the anxious table turnover-oriented service. There is no reason for a few slices of beet and green apple with smears of goat cheese and baby lettuce to be $12. That's ridiculous. Same for the house smoked sturgeon. There was a paper thin tiny sliver of sturgeon beneath a mountain of frisee. Honestly, I would hardly have known. As far as I could see the sturgeon was there merely to give the slightest hint of smoky fish, and I do mean slight. The fish entree was great but again, not $30 wonderful.More importantly, the waitstaff had us in and out of there in barely an hour. They pulled our appetizer dishes before we were done. The waiter made it clear that we weren't sufficiently high yield by asking repeatedly if we wanted more drinks. It was a massive rush from start to finish. Unnecessary especially given that we'd sat down at 6:30p and, I bet they'd be able to turn that table over 2 more times.",2.0
"Stumbled into this place by accident on a rainy night with my girlfriend. They were super pack but the hostess went out of her way to accommodate us. Super great date spot, the oyster selection was good and the bar and bartenders are official!",4.0
"I was here on sunday for brunch. Great Decor. I had the short rib sandwich, a little small but tasty. My friend had the meatloaf sandwich and it was very tasty too. I am not a fan of meatloaf but Rye made it good. Only downside is the drinks are too small.",4.0
"I've been here twice for special occasions.  Everything is outstanding.  I have had the beet salad app, the half chicken entree, and the chocolate cake with pistachio ice cream.  I drank a few French 75s.  Truly, each bite and sip were impeccable and perfectly prepared and the service is outstanding.  So good good good.",5.0

"I have not tried any of the food, so this raving review is based solely on cocktails and experience alone. I arrived and met a friend at the end of the bar a little early on friday, and had a great time. The cocktails are awesome - I started slow with a glass of the house cab which was great but you really come here for the awesome old-fashioneds and other like cocktails. After getting nice and toasty and off of a few of those I started on the Retox cocktail which was amazing. Usually I'm super excited but always dubious of ""spicy tequila"" drinks....only bc so few places seem to get it right. The retox def had a perfect amount of that spicy kick to it....definitely wasn't overpoweringly sweet...(which is awesome) and had just the right amount of bite to the tequila/mixer ratio. I had too many. And then forgot who my friend was. The bartenders were super friendly and honestly really attentive without seeming intrusive. I forgot they were there unless I needed something....lol. Both bartenders had awesome beards:-) The atmosphere was nice and cozy, and just dark enough to make people seem slightly more attractive than they are......",5.0
"Interesting place...very smart looking inside...if you don't what I mean by that, I don't blame you ;-). It just looks smart. Now the food and drinks did not impress me...they were good, I just was expecting delicious, but got only good. A bit on the Pricey side as well.  A-just-OK.",3.0
"I've been to Rye a number of times now since it opened, and the place has continued to refine itself and in my opinion is on par with Walter Foods in terms of the food, wine, service and atmosphere. Although the wait can be a bit interminable on a weekend, it's worth the effort. I recommend the oysters (Kushi, Beau Soleil, North Point) and the duck breast which comes done in a modern moroccan style with cous cous and a fragrant sauce. The meatloaf sandwich also looks incredible but I haven't committed to it just yet. Cocktails? It's Rye so cut the B.S. and down an Old-fashioned or the Havemeyer one.",5.0

"First deciding on a place in Brooklyn, yet reasonably close to Manhattan. My (drum roll...) girlfriend and I, looked forward to a stroll across the W'burg bridge to try a ""New Yorker"" recommended restaurant.  We're glad we did.Service was above excellent. We began with the Oysters, our variety being from Martha's vineyard. Very very good. Having perused the menu online prior to arriving, we were set on the steak for two. The waiter brought out the steak for us to see it prior to having it cooked. Very nice touch. It arrived, beautifully presented, cut into slices with a delicious red wine sauce. Highly recommended. Peter Lugar, take note of this neighbor competition!Desert was chocolate flourless cake. Excellent choice, very well complementing the glass of red wine left over.Their cocktails are worthy of another complete review. Their mixologist is a master of his craft.

The donuts were hot and the icecream was a good, standard vanilla. The lemon cake was superb.  If you can imagine the texture of cake mixed with creamy custard with the flavor of high quality lemon curd...with fresh berries and whipped cream---excellent.The decor and atmosphere is casual and non-pretentious, service was impeccible (even after we payed the bill, the waitstaff kept our water glasses filled to the brim while we sat).  And the cocktails are  great, try the tequila cocktail if you love sweet cocktails.

Also brilliant.  The hot chocolate (with bourbon and marshmallows) makes  winter almost worthwhile.   I'm not familiar with Williamsburg and I must say I got a little confused seeing a map of Alaska in the rest room.  I started looking for Russia out the window, alas to no avail.",5.0

"I randomly selected Rye based on yelp reviews as a place to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday with my parents, who were visiting from out of town.  My mother in particular has very particular tastes when it comes to restaurants (only half of which I find legitimate), which include things like lighting, room temperature, and silverware.  Rye turned out to be the perfect place for my parents, as well as for myself and my girlfriend.  In fact, aside from the plethora of stellar Japanese restaurants (Bozu, Sui Ren, and Zenkichi), I think Rye could be my new favorite spot in Williamsburg.Our server was very friendly and took a lot of time to explain the menu and all of the special things they were doing that evening, most of which were upgrades from what was already on the printed menu.  For example, the striped bass that my parents wanted to get also came with cockles and risotto, in addition to the other sides listed on the menu.  I chose the butternut squash soup and the meatloaf sandwich.  The soup was absolutely delectable.  It came with a little fried cheese, some cubed pieces of squash, and was perfectly seasoned.  The meatloaf sandwich was outrageous.  Probably the best sandwich I've had in a couple of years.  The only thing that could have made it more over-the-top would have been a layer of cheese, but between the buttered roll, creamy coleslaw, and fried onions there's enough flavor and fat to put you into a coma.  LOVE THE MEATLOAF SANDWICH.  That's not a statement, it's a command.  I command you to love it too!!The reasons for knocking Rye down from 5 to 4 stars:1) The broccoli rabe was seasoned with too much wasabi or horseradish.  It just wasn't a good combination, even though I love wasabi.2) The walls are really dirty!  I love the aesthetic in general.  The turn-of-the-century bar, according to the explanation offered up by the owner, is gorgeous.  The flooring is great.  The bathrooms are cute.  Why do the walls look like someone projectile-vomited all over them?  OK, that's a little extreme, but seriously, artwork or paint would be a huge plus.3) The pricey non-meatloaf sandwich entrees were on the small side.Definitely going back.  Definitely getting that ridiculous meatloaf sandwich again.",4.0

"I randomly selected Rye based on yelp reviews as a place to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday with my parents, who were visiting from out of town.  My mother in particular has very particular tastes when it comes to restaurants (only half of which I find legitimate), which include things like lighting, room temperature, and silverware.  Rye turned out to be the perfect place for my parents, as well as for myself and my girlfriend.  In fact, aside from the plethora of stellar Japanese restaurants (Bozu, Sui Ren, and Zenkichi), I think Rye could be my new favorite spot in Williamsburg.Our server was very friendly and took a lot of time to explain the menu and all of the special things they were doing that evening, most of which were upgrades from what was already on the printed menu.  For example, the striped bass that my parents wanted to get also came with cockles and risotto, in addition to the other sides listed on the menu.  I chose the butternut squash soup and the meatloaf sandwich.  The soup was absolutely delectable.  It came with a little fried cheese, some cubed pieces of squash, and was perfectly seasoned.  The meatloaf sandwich was outrageous.  Probably the best sandwich I've had in a couple of years.  The only thing that could have made it more over-the-top would have been a layer of cheese, but between the buttered roll, creamy coleslaw, and fried onions there's enough flavor and fat to put you into a coma.  LOVE THE MEATLOAF SANDWICH.  That's not a statement, it's a command.  I command you to love it too!!The reasons for knocking Rye down from 5 to 4 stars:1) The broccoli rabe was seasoned with too much wasabi or horseradish.  It just wasn't a good combination, even though I love wasabi.2) The walls are really dirty!  I love the aesthetic in general.  The turn-of-the-century bar, according to the explanation offered up by the owner, is gorgeous.  The flooring is great.  The bathrooms are cute.  Why do the walls look like someone projectile-vomited all over them?  OK, that's a little extreme, but seriously, artwork or paint would be a huge plus.3) The pricey non-meatloaf sandwich entrees were on the small side.Definitely going back.  Definitely getting that ridiculous meatloaf sandwich again.",4.0
"I have been to Rye five times and I like it more each time.This review should be 4.5 stars.Last night was my third dinner experience at Rye. I like this place because I am able to have either a casual night with just a glass of wine and a reasonably-priced and satisfying sandwich ....... or I can go all out with cocktails, courses, friends, and nice wine. The ribeye is one of the best steaks I've had in the city.... and since I just returned from a serious steak-eating mission in Argentina, please know that this is saying a lot. Very good quality meat cooked perfectly for a reasonable cost. Perfectly cooked brussels sprouts. Endive and pear salad has a nice, unexpected savory twist. I did not care for the beet ""ravioli"" because it is served with a broth and meant to be spooned. It feels awkward to eat and I never quite felt I was able to get the right ingredients onto my spoon to really enjoy it.The service at Rye has been outstanding four out of five times, and the fourth time was still good. The hosts and wait staff are so friendly and also very knowledgeable about wine. For the most part, bartenders are good. On my first visit, I asked the bartender how sweet the Southside cocktail would be and he returned a reply with a cocky tone:  ""NOTHING we make here is sweet"". When the cocktail was delivered, I disagreed and was disappointed. This was the only instance of my having experienced stinky service here, but I still love the staff and bring it up so you know about the cocktails. The atmosphere is always bustling and can be loud, but somehow once I am seated, I always feel relaxed. The interior is beautiful with lovely wooden bar and tile floor. The dishes and flatware are artfully selected.I have been to brunch twice. The benedict with pork belly is off the hook, and I love the red rooster cocktail. Good coffee.I don't give Rye five stars because the cocktails need fine-tuning, the acoustics could use work, and there is not enough bar space. But it's still a love affair and I am so glad they are in the 'hood!",4.0
"The meatloaf sandwich was out of this world. I also like the beer+rye combo that comes on an adorable little silver platter. We weren't incredibly hungry so we split the sandwich and a side order of chard. The chard was buttery and delicious. Unfortunately, we uncovered a jagged piece of plastic hiding in the greens. It was about the size of a quarter and had sharp edges--who knows how it wound up in our food. Our waitress was extremely apologetic and took the chard off our bill. I'm sure this was a fluke and I would definitely go back to Rye.",4.0
"My boyfriend took me here in December for a nice, romantic dinner.  The restaurant was beautiful, the staff was great, and the food was delicious. HOWEVER, it was so loud we could barely carry on a conversation.  And even though we had a reservation, we had to wait about 30 minutes for a table. Fortunately there's a tiny little bar next door where we could get a cheap drink while we waited.  The hostess was nice enough to take down our cell number and call us when our table was ready.  I would gladly give Rye more than three stars, but the noise level was really a mood killer for me.",3.0
Always solid.  I rarely venture off the Short Rib sandwich path.  It's essentially the greatest sandwich ever.  I know the meatloaf gets a lot of press...but the Short Rib is epic.  And at $8 it could be the best value in the city.Service is friendly and eating at the bar - even during busy Friday or Saturday nights is a good option.,4.0
"The WORST dining experience. I went to Rye on a Saturday night with my boyfriend and four other friends. lets start by getting seated. the hostess was very nice and created a seating arraignment for the 5 of us by the back corner of the room. Our waitress although very nice but not knowledgeable about the menu asked us for our drink order. it took 35 minutes for our first round of drinks to arrive to the table. While we were waiting for our drinks we ordered some appetizers. We started off with a dozen oysters for the table at $33. We also got a pickle platter for the table and a cheese plate, and finally the scotch egg. Oysters were pretty fresh no complaints there. Pickle platter was a joke.  One baby pickle sliced into 5 slithers, 3 baby olives a baby pickled shallot along with 5 pickled green beans and 2 slices of roasted red peppers is hardly a pickle platter. TOTAL JOKE WAY OVERPRICED for what it was.The Cheese plate was 3 slices of cheese. Blue cheese,Goat Cheese and Swiss. the Cheese wasn't bad but if I""m paying $16 for a cheese plate I expect more than 3 slices of cheese on the plate.Scotch Egg is truly the most amazing item on the menu. Simply Delicious.After we all ate a slither of pickle and a fraction of a cheese slice our drinks arrived and we placed our dinner orders. My boyfriend and I got the steak for 2 so did the other couple we were with. We both asked for our steak to be cooked medium. We also ordered a side of mashed potatoes. Our other friend got the pork belly. along with that we ordered our 2nd round of drinks.45 minute cook time for the steak in the 45 min we waited for our dinner to arrive the waitress didnt approach our table ask us how we were doing or if we needed drinks. She Didn't even remember to bring us our second round of drinks that we had ordered.Finally after an hour we get our steak and its pretty big good for two people. Our steak had a nice crust on the outside and it comes pre sliced with a side of coarse salt. I pick up a slice and bite into it its chewy and completely rare. the other couples steak was also rare a bit less rare than ours. I ate a couple of slices and stopped as i wasn't enjoying my meal at all. i wanted to send back the steak for more cooking but our waitress was nowhere to be found and we still hadn't received our drinks.  Our friend that ordered the Pork belly enjoyed her meal. Finally our waitress comes to the table and we ask for the check and also tell her to cancel our order of drinks that we had been waiting an hour for. Sure enough she came back with the drinks on the house of coarse and the check. Our bill was around $350 as i start looking at what we had ordered I notice we were charged for a bottle of wine that our table did not order and our waitress fixed that check .the food was Not the greatest and the staff terrible.",1.0
"The ribeye here is my favorite steak in New York. Rye sources their meat from the same folks that Luger's gets its porterhouses. It is served in a bordelaise that, when combined with the accompanying coarse salt, brings the already rich, dry-aged savory goodness to another level. My gal and I typically come in and order a medium-sized steak (the price is per ounce), which the kitchen then brings to the table for approval. You'd think that we'd bring home some portion of the 40 oz medium-rare monster, but we usually don't. It's good to be a glutton. And this is a steak for gluttons.",5.0
"Frequent diner at many of the neighborhood's restaurants and I always like to try the new places. I was BEYOND disappointed this past Saturday night with my meal on so many levels - the only exception being the good nature of my server.My companion and I arrived at 9:30. The bar was packed but there were 3 or 4 empty tables. The hostess said that the wait would be 30 minutes. Hmm. Empty tables + 30 min wait = something's up.I overheard the bartender tell some folks who were patiently waiting for their main courses that the kitchen was slammed. I got nervous. It was relatively late and the place didn't have every table filled yet the kitchen was slammed. I should have left but I didn't want to eat at 10:30 somewhere else.Unfortunately, I did eat at 10:30. At Rye.The appetizer of artichoke and bean soup/salad was awesome. But that's about where the awesomeness began and ended.Duck breast came out cold.French fries looked appetizing but were soggy and wet.Braised beef short rib sandwich was tasty but so small. Why not charged $12 instead of $8 and put some more meat on it?With so much experience and hype at Rye, I would have expected at least a B+. The problem is the Williamsburg area has so many A places that just deliver time after time for solid food (El Almacen, Diner, even Walter Foods) that I just left wondering what the future holds for these folks...",1.0
"Low key and top shelf.  Went on a busy Friday night...put our names in and went down the street for a drink...hostess came and got us sooner than expected...nice first move.  The staff was attentive and knowledgeable without being too big a part of the experience.  The crowd was chill and the place is nice and dark so we had some privacy. The food is excellent....legitimately. Creative menu with not too many options...highly recommend the fried brussell sprouts, roast chicken, berkshire pork and cake donuts.  Nice beer, wine and cocktail selection...beer and a shot deal was a nice touch.",5.0

"I've ate here twice.  Once for Dinner on a weekday night, and once for a late brunch.  Both times I was blown away at how good the food was. When my friend and I arrived for her BDay dinner, it was late, maybe an hour before they were about to close.  It was pretty deserted for besides a few people at the bar and maybe one or two other tables.  Nice atmosphere, has that old time feel, black and white tiled floors, dark wood, adorned just so that it was hard to tell it was the original architecture or intentional. We split the seafood civeche special, hanger steak, and artichoke fricassee.  All totally delicious. We topped it off with Doughnuts and Ice Cream and the Steamed Lemon Cake.  That's pretty much the moment we died and went to heaven.  It was hands down, one of the best meals I had in the Burg.  Another time, my friends and I went for a late brunch/lunch.  I had the Braised Short Rib sandwich.  Yo... seriously... it was amazingness in your mouth.  Too big to pick up in eat, so I learned, I rec using a fork and knife.   I read some of these other reviews... my advice I guess is don't go at peak times.  I never had a problem with the service.  I actually had the same guy both times and he remembered me.",5.0

They weren't keen on taking reservations for 10 so Rye's menu looked good and they were much more accommodating.Made a reservation for 7:30 2 weeks in advance with no problems...we wound up showing up 45 minutes late but they held our table and were nice about it. Our waitress was in La-La Land the whole time...she just wasn't around or helpful. Ordered some drinks, they were small and they were weak. So not a good bet for the price, around $10 for one. Split some appetizers of which all were meh...they oysters were good. The food really varied. I tried the skate which was disgustingly salty but I had lamb which was actually very tender and gamey...with juniper berries and mashed potatoes...a near perfect entree. The meatloaf was a bit gross but the short rib sammich delish....the whole ordeal was hit and miss. Dessert was a miss as well. Prices are very reasonable though.It's dark and lovely inside and there's a long crowded bar, the dining room seems too crowded though...felt like everyone was on top of each other.",3.0

"I have not been as happy after a meal as I was after eating at Rye in a long, long time. Maybe it was the decor, or the friendly staff, or the fun table-side cocktail service, but I know one thing for sure: the food was outstanding. We started with drinks at the bar while we waited for our table (where I also had the best dirty martini of my life), then continued with old fashioneds after we were seated. To start, our group ordered oysters and the Scotch egg. The oysters came with a cucumber mignonette that is my new favorite thing - next time I shuck oysters at home, I am certainly going to attempt to make it myself. The Scotch egg was of course delicious - how could a hard boiled egg wrapped in bacon and sausage not be? I have no idea what kind of sauce was on top, something similar to hollandaise, I imagine, but it was excellent. For our main course, my group ordered a few things to share: the Brussels sprouts salad, macaroni and cheese, rigatoni with lamb ragu, braised short ribs, spring pea ravioli, and, of course, the famous meatloaf sandwich topped with crispy onions. Everything was pretty much gone by the time we finished our meal, and we all agreed that it was some of the best food we had eaten in recent memory.

"Darling place! I had the beet & goat cheese napoleon and the heirloom tomato special (with local feta), and my friend had the shrimp and scallop skewers.

"My friends and I are always in search of a good cucumber flavored cocktail and speakeasy drinks cheaper than those of The Campbell Apartment.  This cucumber cocktail is sweet and also the liquor tastes strong, $10 is a powerful motivator compared to the similarly flavored drinks from other places that get it right (Death and Company's Midnight Sun and PDT's Badminton).  Their oysters are fresh and the small sturgeon dish is also of good quality with creamy potatoes on top, but piled sky high with some feathery greens that need to go.  This place is too expensive for what it is, though.  It's not quite a bar, its tables scream dinner rather than private cocktail party, the bar is propelled in the front where everyone can see the George Bataille quote tattooed on your ""back.""  Neither is it a place where you can get your fill on entrees or exclusively eat appetizers.  For every expensive place in Brooklyn, there are two cheaper ones of equal or better quality.  I know this because I was still hungry and somewhat broke when we left here and headed to Momo in Bushwick where I ate my fill of outstanding and still five dollar sushi.  I could have sturgeon anywhere.",3.0

The shortrib terrine was the only slight down side to the meal.  It was only bad because it was so heavy.  As an appetizer you don't expect the terrine to be served in a bed of potatoes, onions, bacon, and sauce.  It was like a app on steroids.  Very flavorful and filling, just a bit much for so early in the meal.  The duck entree was perfect.  Nice crust to the skin and perfectly medium in the middle.  Served on greens in a very delicate but complex sauce.  Everything on the dish complemented each other rather than cover.  The pork belly entree was also very good.  The brussel sprouts were cooked perfectly and well seasoned by a light balsamic glaze.  Went well with the beans and worked to cut the fat in the belly. The belly was very tender but could have perhaps used just a bit more browning.  Butternut squash cheese cake tasted like pumpkin pie which I like so it was good.",5.0
"This place is reminiscent of Dressler to me, but less fancy.  Some in our party tried (of course) some of the rye cocktails, which were cool because they used a whole block of ice in them (neat effect).

Split the ribeye for two and it was tasty, however, they essentially give you a butter knife and not a steak knife, so it was annoying to eat.

"My friends and I are always in search of a good cucumber flavored cocktail and speakeasy drinks cheaper than those of The Campbell Apartment.  This cucumber cocktail is sweet and also the liquor tastes strong, $10 is a powerful motivator compared to the similarly flavored drinks from other places that get it right (Death and Company's Midnight Sun and PDT's Badminton).  Their oysters are fresh and the small sturgeon dish is also of good quality with creamy potatoes on top, but piled sky high with some feathery greens that need to go.  This place is too expensive for what it is, though.  It's not quite a bar, its tables scream dinner rather than private cocktail party, the bar is propelled in the front where everyone can see the George Bataille quote tattooed on your ""back.""  Neither is it a place where you can get your fill on entrees or exclusively eat appetizers.  For every expensive place in Brooklyn, there are two cheaper ones of equal or better quality.  I know this because I was still hungry and somewhat broke when we left here and headed to Momo in Bushwick where I ate my fill of outstanding and still five dollar sushi.  I could have sturgeon anywhere.",3.0

"Incredible food, great margaritas, impeccable service.   I can't think of a reason not to go back.",5.0
"Simply awesome!  Can't wait to return and try the meatloaf!  Had the scotch egg and it was surprisingly good. The shortrib terrine was the only slight down side to the meal.  It was only bad because it was so heavy.  As an appetizer you don't expect the terrine to be served in a bed of potatoes, onions, bacon, and sauce.  It was like a app on steroids.  Very flavorful and filling, just a bit much for so early in the meal.  The duck entree was perfect.  Nice crust to the skin and perfectly medium in the middle.  Served on greens in a very delicate but complex sauce.  Everything on the dish complemented each other rather than cover.  The pork belly entree was also very good.  The brussel sprouts were cooked perfectly and well seasoned by a light balsamic glaze.  Went well with the beans and worked to cut the fat in the belly. The belly was very tender but could have perhaps used just a bit more browning.  Butternut squash cheese cake tasted like pumpkin pie which I like so it was good.",5.0
"This place is reminiscent of Dressler to me, but less fancy.  Some in our party tried (of course) some of the rye cocktails, which were cool because they used a whole block of ice in them (neat effect). They had an excellent washington state cabernet so I drank that. The brussels sprouts appetizer was amazing. The crab appetizer also good. Split the ribeye for two and it was tasty, however, they essentially give you a butter knife and not a steak knife, so it was annoying to eat. I asked and the waiter (whose was friendly and otherwise efficient) said they had no other knives. Really?  why? Hence I am dinging a star.",4.0
"i went here in the winter and it was great.had the duck confit and a great cocktail called blood and smoke that used whiskey infused with lapsang souchong tea and black cherry. dunno if they have it anymore. the duck confit was rich and wonderful.been meaning to go back. nice decor, too. that dark speakeasy-ish vibe that's so hot these days. i'll admit that i'm a sucker for it.",4.0
"They fit our party of 8 into a reservation about an hour before, so we were happy. Good service, nice atmosphere and attentive bartender while we waiting. Most of the group ordered streak, a few different cuts, everyone seemed happy. I had the roasted beet salad with some kind of incredible goat cheese, sounds typical but it was delightful, followed by the meatloaf sandwich, which was so good that my fiance (on one side of me) and my best friend (on the other side of me) took turns stealing huge bites. It was succulent, rich, sweet, well seasoned, and on wonderful bread. I will DEFINITELY go back just for this sandwich. Only problem was at the end of the night, our waitress told some of our table the tip was included (20% grat) and others were not aware, so some over-tipped.",4.0
"The proliferation of wonderful restaurants in Williamsburg is overwhelming and Rye is setting the bar very high. I went a couple of times recently and had meatloaf that was out of this world, a crazy mac 'n cheese and a cassoulet that borders on addictive. The waiter was incredibly nice but the service was definitely a little on the slow side, which was fine as the atmosphere is dark and mellow, and a pleasure to hang out in. Great date place - I look forward to going back.",4.0
"A group of 9 went yesterday for brunch and it was AMAZING!!!  One had the sturgeon app which was out of this world, we also had the crab croquette which was the best ever and we also had the fried egg and sausage app.  All of these were sooo tasty and creative.  On to the entrees which were hanger steak ( great taste) baked eggs (love 'em) and braised short ribs ( never had better).  The brunch drinks were fantastic, especially the RETOX (tequila, lime ,chili).  The whole experience, from attentive and friendly staff to atmosphere were incomparable.  Loved it and will be back for dinner.  Try it - you'll love it too!!!  Brooklyn at its best!!!  Compliments to the CHEF!!!",5.0
"i went there last night with several friends.  we ended up changing the number of people to our reservation several times and in the end, they were able to accomodate us very well.  we were a group of 9, which was larger than the average 2 tops or 4 tops.  the drinks took a while, but they were tasty and reasonably priced.  the duck appetizer was well sized, easily able to share with 3-4 people.  the mac and cheese entree has pancetta, which it doesn't say on the menu.  it was delicious, but they should probably mention that on the menu so a vegetarian doesn't order it.  good, ambiance, good food.  service was excellent.  i'd return.",4.0

"I have lived on the south side for quite a while and have to say this is the best addition I have seen. The food is amazing and the menu has enough diversity that you can have a fancy special occasion dinner or just a quick simple delicious snack. I have been a couple of times now and loved everything. The mushroom lasagna is to die for! My friend had the duck confit  with homemade gnocchi and raved about it (I am a vegetarian so I didn't try, but the presentation was beautiful). Also don't leave without trying the lemon pudding cake. The design is great. They have a fully restored bar from the 1800's that they restored themselves (our waiter told us). It has a great vintage feel with wonderful attention to the details. Also there is a little patio out back so you can take your drink while you smoke (amazing!)The cocktails were another highlite. There is one called a jack rose made with apple jack that was scrumptious, also the old fashioned was delicious . okay, okay they are all pretty wonderful (I had some sips of the ones my friends were trying too). I will be going back for sure!! I would say go soon too because before long it will be hard to get a table. Right now we can still sneak in and not wait, but once people realize where it is (there is no sign) it will be trouble. :)",5.0

"My gf and I were in the mood for some good sandwiches and a good friend of ours told us about rye. We didnt want to go anywhere to far and this place was literally 3 blocks from my gf's apt. When we walked in we thought they were still closed but they were just opening for dinner(around 545 we walked in). They allowed us to sit at a table of our choice and have a cocktail while we looked over the menu. It didnt take us long to figure out what we wanted bc we knew we were getting sandwiches and only had 3 to choose from. My gf took the short rib sandwich was delicious. Meat was cooked perfectly and tasted really really good. I had to try the rye meatloaf which is a combination of beef, pork, veal, duck and shortrib. Ive had some tasty , delicious, juicy , mouthwatering sandwiches before but I cannot remember the last time I had had one this good. I mean i savored each bite and ate as slow as I could. I didnt want the taste to go away and almost a second sandwich to-go to eat later but figured that was a little much. lol. we also had the mac and cheese which was pretty good, pasta was al dente just the way i like it. I def recommend this place if your in the mood for a good sandwich in williamsburg!",4.0

"Unmarked door on random Brooklyn neighborhood block led to a dark mahogany tin ceilinged dimly lit dining room with charming bar and wrap around banquet seating.
