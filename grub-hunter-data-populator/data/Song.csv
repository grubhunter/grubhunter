"I most often take Song to go so my review is just of the food which is great and inexpensive - my favorite Thai place! (*note this the twin-sister restaurant of Joya in Cobble Hill).Dining in can be loud and busy, but usually still enjoyable.My favorites:Pad See YuMassaman CurryChicken and Broccoli *check out the specialsNot my favorites (but still good):fried calamaripad thai",5.0
"Lovely setup, good atmosphere, Helpful wait staff! This was an impromptu decision to do Thai for dinner and this pops up. A little difficult to find because they got a piece of paper on their door mentioning the name. Once inside, you are greeted to the beautiful setup. They also have an outdoor table service but it was closed when i had been there. It was a little noisy and I couldn't have asked for a better atmosphere.Food was delicious. Try anything with the chilly basil sauce. It will not disappoint. Their house wine is among the few good wines I have tasted so far. Needless to say, Im not much of a wine drinker.P.s It was not very spicy.",4.0
"A couple week ago I was in Brooklyn visiting family. We had spent the whole day walking around, sightseeing and shopping. The whole day passed us quickly and before we knew it, it was 9:30 and we were starving. Someone recommended Song as a great place to get some Thai food. Big portions and low prices too. I couldn't say no to that so off we went. When we arrived they were about an hour out from closing. The restaurant was still pretty busy but we were seated quickly. I ordered the glass noodles, my sister ordered the pad thai, and my brother ordered the yellow curry. The food came pretty fast and they weren't kidding about the large portions. Holy cow! The food was pretty delicious, nothing to complain about there. The curry was the perfect amount of spicy. Sometimes I notice curry is either too spicy or not spicy enough. I did feel a little rushed towards the end of the meal but I can't really blame the staff, I know they want to go home too. We paid our tab and left with our leftovers (which made a great breakfast that next morning). I really enjoyed my meal and I'll definitely go back when I'm in the area.One tip, stay away from the house red. I ordered it and couldn't stand the taste. :(",4.0
"My friend recommended this place so i decided to bring my family here for dinner one night. We didnt have rsvp and it was a wkend.. but only waited abt 5-8 mins (we got lucky i guess! Cos it was def a full house). I do have to say i dont think their vents are good enough becos it was very smokey inside the restaurant and i felt it in my eyes. The tables were pretty small or their dishes were too big.. Becos we were strugglin w space..Their thai iced tea is really good as it is not too milky or too sweet like most thai places. I can actually say one of the best thai iced teas ive had.My bf really liked their curry, my son and i enjoyed their steak and my sis really liked her pad thai. The appetizers were also very good, puff pastry, calamari, and mussels.Customer svc was decent--it was a full house so we did hafto wait here and there to get our orders taken down and to get condiments/utensils and check. Perhaps they can arrange more waitress/waiters on busy nights.. Think i only saw 2 walkin around.They have an outdoor area but too bad it was too chilly and didnt get to explore it. We will definitely be back when the weather gets warmer :)",4.0
"I love love love Song.  The food is so tasty, the ambiance is hip & sexy and the price is very reasonably.   Great date night spot in a budget, but you will feel like you're at an expensive restaurant.  If you want to this should be you're #1 place!!",5.0
"On a cold February day when everyone had the good sense to stay indoors, I linked with a friend to eat some Thai. Song was the choice and there will be another and another because Song's food was delightful. They do the known Thai dishes with respect and with a little extra flair. Mango Salad: refreshing & fillingBasil Noodles (without egg): meaty, warm, smokey from open fire preperation, seasoned perfectlyGive this place a try. It is the perfect staple when you aren't feeling to try someplace new.",4.0
"I come here for the chicken curry puffs and the Pad Thai. In that regard, this place is excellent. Various friends who order different dishes have also had really good things to say. I tend to eat here when I'm craving Thai and I'm in slope. Their sister restaurant, Joya, in Carroll Gardens is equally scrumptious. Their portions are humongous, their prices are cheap and the service has always been pretty good with each visit. For Thai, I'd recommend Song if you find yourself in the nabe.",4.0
Try the whiskey sour...and get the fried calamari for the app...that's all I gotta say.,5.0
"Great find in Park Slope. My girlfriend and I were looking to find a nice spot for a large group of people for her birthday. My only gripe about the restaurant is that they don't take reservations in advance, but rather walk-in reservations instead. It can be a wait on a Saturday night but that's to be expected. Otherwise the food was GREAT. Portions were big and the prices were very good. I'd definitely recommend this place for if a couple were to just go out to eat together or for a date night with another couple. During the warmer months there is a small patio area and seems very nice to eat there too. I'm sure we will be back here again very soon. Definitely a little gem worth checking out",4.0
"Went for lunch with a friend. Pad Thai was sooooo goood, I didn't need to add any sauces. The spicy chicken and pineapple fried rice was good too. I have to go back. Two entrees were 24 bucks (with tax)",4.0
"My favorite place for Pad Thai. I've brought many of my friends here and not surprisingly, they fell in love with the Pad Thai too. There is a perfect balance between the sweetness, sourness, and saltiness. Palate party! The Panang curry is my second go to entree. The Tom Yum soup is very good on cold days. The prices are very affordable but Song only accepts cash. The place has a hip modern feel. I don't like the pictures on the wall very much but everything else is very nice. Both bathrooms are modern and usually clean. The back outdoor seating is comfortable and cute but the tiny pebbles are awkward to walk on.I love the transparency of the kitchen. You can see the cooks at work from the inside as well as the outside.",5.0
"We ate here last night for the first time, and will definitely be going back. Good service, excellent food and a really friendly manager who impressed us with his delicate handling of a tricky situation involving a couple letting their child run around on the furniture. We had the bbq wings for starters, then three entrees between us (masaman beef curry, gai kraprow and amazing pad thai, which was just as good for leftovers the next day.) the whole bill was less than $40. our server was polite and attentive, just what you need.",4.0
"Good Thai and not crazy expensive like some other places in Park Slope/Prospect Heights. Great tom yum. Decent spicy noodles - though not really that spicy and a little soggy at the bottom (also, I asked to add broccoli and I think that helped).",4.0
"You know, I'm originally from Queens and my wife and I always go out of our way to find awesome Thai food! This place is definitely the best thai food place in Brooklyn! The portion sizes are pretty large, the prices are cheap and the ambiance is pretty hipster. I always order the Pad Thai Beef which can't ever go wrong, but my wife has tried a handful of other dishes and loves the Red, Panang Curry with Rice! Their chicken curry puffs are pretty bomb too. Calamari to start off (can feed 4) is not a bad option either :) Ask for the ""spice rack"" and try the powder pepper on your pad thai for an extra kick!",5.0
"What happened to the service? had to break a neck and arm to get a refill of water and it wasn't even busy. the people that came after us that ordered the same dish as me got their food first.food here has always been good, but I'm super disappointed in the  service.",3.0
"Inexpensive, delicious food. Poor service. I tend to be very forgiving about service, but throughout our meal at Song I was truly distracted by our server's inattention. Fifteen or twenty minutes after I wanted to order a second drink, we managed to get his attention and I ordered it, not even sure if I wanted it anymore. Didn't matter. He never brought the drink. In addition to being frustrating to me the customer,  this would anger me if I were his boss, as it's a loss of money to the restaurant! Smh. I really enjoyed my dish of grilled shrimp pad thai with avocado, and my Better Half had a half chicken cooked perfectly falling off the bone, served with just-right crunchy brussels sprouts. Were I rating Song on the food alone, I'd add a star. Too bad.",3.0
"I just don't get it. I've been to Joya in Cobble Hill and loved it. I've been to National in Fort Greene and loved it. But for some reason Song in Park Slope (from the same people) just isn't as good.Service was lackluster. There was nobody at the front desk to seat us when we walked in because of how the kitchen is on the other side of the big wall.The food wasn't great. The shrimp pad thai was sour for some reason (this was without the addition of the lemon on the side). The chili/basil mussels were okay, but not great. Lots of unopened ones.I also had the crispy half duck in coconut curry. It was plentiful, and most of the duck sure was crispy. But it lacked any kick.But at least this location accepts credit cards.",3.0
"My personal experience on valentine day was quite horrible at song. They were out of shrimp steam dumplings and mango drinks. A restaurant running out of food, that's cool. Forget those minor things, the thing that pissed me off was the fact that other people came after us and had their appetizer and entree before my boyfriend and myself. I then realized that the waiter forgot to put in our food orders, I don't know why but it wasn't that busy to forget a couple that's sitting center stage in the midst of your restaurant. We're weren't hard to miss , for god sake we were like the only black couple there. Oh! When they realized they forgot about our food order ; immediately they rushed to the back and conjured up what I could only describe as a half ass meal not properly prepared. Thanks a lot guys . I won't be seeing you anytime soon.",1.0
"First off, this place used to be cash only and they have now started taking credit cards, except Amex. Came in on a Saturday evening, no wait but it was very busy inside. Water, utensils and menus were placed instantly on the table but there was a long wait to place an order. Looking around, there were only 2 waiters so we left it alone and enjoyed our conversation. Ordered calamari to start and I had the Spicy Seafood fried rice. It was just as delicious as I last remembered it to be. My husband had the Gai Pad Khing, chicken w peppers, onions, cabbage, carrots, and mushrooms in ginger sauce. It was our first time trying this dish and it was really good! My daughter had the mussels. Seems like they changed the sauce that they used to use because this time around it was more like a coconut curry sauce as opposed to spicy basil from the past. That was our mistake for not looking at the menu and just asking for it off hand. It wasn't to our liking but everything else was great! Huge portions.",4.0
"Hmm, where shall I begin... I think this place deserves 4 star. Mainly because of the price of the food. The atmosphere was really nice. I really couldn't tell that it was a thai food restaurant. I always like restaurants with dim-light atmosphere. It feels sophisticated and somewhat fancy. I ordered thai house salad (?) and it was just a bunch of greens and a little bit of peanut sauce. Then I also got the chicken puffs? I think that was the best and it tasted really good. The entrees were good as well. except the fact mine had more vegetables than noodles. I ordered spicy noodles w/ chicken. For the price, I would say it's fairly decent. It's only like a dollar more than what you would normally get at like a run down thai restaurant. They don't have a dessert menu because they only have like 2 choices which is a bummer because Im a dessert maniac. From what I recall it was something like mango sticky rice and like some fried banana. I Would come back if im near the area again.",4.0

I recommend the Spicy Noodles for those who want their taste buds excited; the Pad See Eu was a tad too sweet for me (and I generally like sweet food [This is actually my go-to Thai dish.]). These also came in big portions so our grumbling stomachs were overly-satisfied (and we still had leftovers, which was good for our guy friends who could eat some more).

Other Thai places I've been to do not cook the veggies through, which bugs me because it feels like they're thrown in in a rush. Def would go back and try out other things on their menu!

"Definitely a hidden paradise! This is now, by far my favorite Thai restaurant in Brooklyn! They are cash only, but you gotta be cool with what the restaurant wants. It's totally affordable to carry cash to this place. The menu is super cute but they got casual with their specials menu which was just a colored piece of construction paper with hand written items. Hey, I love it when it gets casual! :) The mussels are delicious and I'm not always a mussels person. But they cook it in the peanut Thai sauce that is just super yummy. And it's a great dish to share as an appetizer. We got the Spicy Noodles with shrimp and the Kang Panang Nuur (Beef in coconut curry with Kaffir leaves) SUPER DUPER YUMMY!! It's also spicy - we ate it like it was soup! Loved it! LOL! The spicy noodles were not spicy for me at all, but they were delicious which made it all ok. The staff were great and friendly. Take a date here and sit on the patio. It is so adorable and you really do feel like you have stepped out of Brooklyn for a minute.

"At their price point, Song can't be beaten!

"I'm going to start this off by saying the food is *really* good, and pretty well priced.That said, the owner is a complete and utter dick.I've been there exactly twice.  The last time I was there - yesterday - I ordered the Spicy Noodles to go.You'll note that if you take a look at that item here on Yelp, it's listed as $7.95.  It is also $7.95 on Zagat, Menupages, Menuism, Singlepage, Urban Spoon, etc.It is also $7.95 on Joyamenu.com - which includes Song amongst their locations (see joyamenu.com/Locations.h…)On their very own Facebook page - a page they claim they do not administrate - it's a dollar cheaper even, at $6.95.So I go order the dish, go to pick it up, and am surprised to find I'm charged ~$9.75I ask the person checking me out, and they show me their menu -- wherein the dish is listed as $8.95.I'm puzzled about this and note to her that their menus online all list it as being at least a dollar cheaper - in fact a full two dollars cheaper on their facebook page - but I shrug it off and prepare to pay...... and then the owner passes by, and stops.""You again???  EVERY TIME YOU COME IN HERE YOU DO THIS!!!  We don't *have* a menu online.  None of those are ours!!  And we've raised our prices once in the past ten years - like 40¢!!""I look at him, puzzled as to why I'm being verbally berated about this, and state that this is my second visit, and hadn't brought this up before.He talks over me at this point, interrupting me to say I've ben there ""at least six times"" and that I do this ""every time,"" repeating this over and over instead of listening to me.And then he walks off.Apparently he had the important business of picking dead leaves out of his potted plants to attend to, rather than addressing a customer's legitimate concerns with the attitude with which she was just treated by the business' owner o.OI waited around for a while, but he just rudely waved me off, continued to talk over me when he did come over, etc.Long story short, in spite of their delicious food - and reasonable prices - it makes me sad to say that I will not be visiting this establishment again.  The owner is so rude, awful, and dishonorable towards his customers :/",1.0

"BEST THAI PLACE IN BROOKLYN! I absolutely love this place. Now I have never been to Thailand to compare it to the real thing but either way the food TASTE GREAT! The portions are wonderful for the price you pay. I can never finish my plate so I always have left overs for the next day. Every employee in there is amazing and sweet. I would definitely give it a try . I always order the Mango salad , the fried Calamari, The chicken pad see yoo ( i think that's how you spell it) . Everything is always on point. It always busy. But weekdays early on it's not as bad. try it at least once!",5.0
"They are certainly earning stars for their price points.  I was not expecting such a nice ambiance when I saw the menu online.  They also have the outdoor garden open during summer days so the dining area doesn't get too packed.I wouldn't say they have the best Thai food I've ever had but they are good, above average.  We had the calamari, fried snapper special with mango salad (very good and priced well at $18), beef with red curry (very good but wish they have more veggies), spicy basil fried rice (can't go wrong).The snapper and curry were my favorites.  There is some truth to the comments made about unhappy workers.  I do get that vibe as well.  Can't say what it is exactly.  They are taking the New York attitude to another level.  I wouldn't go so far to say they are rude but also don't feel they welcome us in their home.  But for the price points, I shouldn't be expecting white glove service.  Good Blyn option!",4.0
I love the food here but being cash only sucks. Also I can no longer eat inside it either has to be take out or outdoors once its nicer. Everytime I go there is a small like bathroom disinfectant and I'm sorry but that's really a turn off while trying to enjoy food.,2.0

"I'm going to start this off by saying the food is *really* good, and pretty well priced.That said, the owner is a complete and utter dick.I've been there exactly twice.  The last time I was there - yesterday - I ordered the Spicy Noodles to go.You'll note that if you take a look at that item here on Yelp, it's listed as $7.95.  It is also $7.95 on Zagat, Menupages, Menuism, Singlepage, Urban Spoon, etc.It is also $7.95 on Joyamenu.com - which includes Song amongst their locations (see joyamenu.com/Locations.h…)On their very own Facebook page - a page they claim they do not administrate - it's a dollar cheaper even, at $6.95.So I go order the dish, go to pick it up, and am surprised to find I'm charged ~$9.75I ask the person checking me out, and they show me their menu -- wherein the dish is listed as $8.95.I'm puzzled about this and note to her that their menus online all list it as being at least a dollar cheaper - in fact a full two dollars cheaper on their facebook page - but I shrug it off and prepare to pay...... and then the owner passes by, and stops.""You again???  EVERY TIME YOU COME IN HERE YOU DO THIS!!!  We don't *have* a menu online.  None of those are ours!!  And we've raised our prices once in the past ten years - like 40¢!!""I look at him, puzzled as to why I'm being verbally berated about this, and state that this is my second visit, and hadn't brought this up before.He talks over me at this point, interrupting me to say I've ben there ""at least six times"" and that I do this ""every time,"" repeating this over and over instead of listening to me.And then he walks off.Apparently he had the important business of picking dead leaves out of his potted plants to attend to, rather than addressing a customer's legitimate concerns with the attitude with which she was just treated by the business' owner o.OI waited around for a while, but he just rudely waved me off, continued to talk over me when he did come over, etc.Long story short, in spite of their delicious food - and reasonable prices - it makes me sad to say that I will not be visiting this establishment again.  The owner is so rude, awful, and dishonorable towards his customers :/",1.0
Fried calamari was really good there is seating outdoors which I would've loved if it was summer time so I may need to visit again in warmer weather Food is really cheap and still tastes good Waiter was ok,4.0
So I was told that everything they have here is good. I played it safe and had chicken Pad Thai also because I love that dish. It was too peanuty for me and thick here though. Definitely doesn't beat my #1 place for Pad Thai!,3.0
"BEST THAI PLACE IN BROOKLYN! I absolutely love this place. Now I have never been to Thailand to compare it to the real thing but either way the food TASTE GREAT! The portions are wonderful for the price you pay. I can never finish my plate so I always have left overs for the next day. Every employee in there is amazing and sweet. I would definitely give it a try . I always order the Mango salad , the fried Calamari, The chicken pad see yoo ( i think that's how you spell it) . Everything is always on point. It always busy. But weekdays early on it's not as bad. try it at least once!",5.0
"They are certainly earning stars for their price points.  I was not expecting such a nice ambiance when I saw the menu online.  They also have the outdoor garden open during summer days so the dining area doesn't get too packed.I wouldn't say they have the best Thai food I've ever had but they are good, above average.  We had the calamari, fried snapper special with mango salad (very good and priced well at $18), beef with red curry (very good but wish they have more veggies), spicy basil fried rice (can't go wrong).The snapper and curry were my favorites.  There is some truth to the comments made about unhappy workers.  I do get that vibe as well.  Can't say what it is exactly.  They are taking the New York attitude to another level.  I wouldn't go so far to say they are rude but also don't feel they welcome us in their home.  But for the price points, I shouldn't be expecting white glove service.  Good Blyn option!",4.0
I love the food here but being cash only sucks. Also I can no longer eat inside it either has to be take out or outdoors once its nicer. Everytime I go there is a small like bathroom disinfectant and I'm sorry but that's really a turn off while trying to enjoy food.,2.0

"I keep ordering from Song despite my best judgement. Why? Because people like Song. People I work with and eat with. I am in the mixed bag about this place. I like some things but my go-to orders are not prepared so well here. What is that you say? The spicy noodle dish also known as ""drunken noodles"" is more greasy than flavorful here. I don't really enjoy it so I always have to try an alternative. I've tried the fried rice (better than noodles), the pad thai (never a fan, its a-ok), and most recently a green curry that was more cream than curry. The summer rolls here are not what you'd expect. This is a thai place and not a vietnamese place so the rice paper is not the thin stuff you'd think comes on those rolls but a thicker consistency that doesn't win most people over.The calamari here is really good though.

"I came here on a Saturday night and it was packed. They do not take reservations so we had to wait about 40 minutes for a table. We ordered the chicken avocado summer roll and the mussels in basil broth for appetizers. The chicken avocado summer rolls were refreshing but simple. It came with a mustard and a sweet and tangy dipping sauce. The mussels were okay. I felt that they weren't as fresh. For entrees, I had the skirt steak with spicy noodles and my friend had the sliced beef with green curry (the only one on the menu with beef and green curry). The green curry is spicier than the red curry. The skirt steak was cooked how I liked- medium rare but it was lacking in flavor and taste. However, the noodles were really salty! The curry was pretty good. I would recommend it if you like your curry with an extra spice to it. The curry had bamboo shoots, sliced beef, green peppers, and eggplants. It came with a side of white rice.Overall, I would give it a second try and maybe come on a weekday instead. The dinner felt a bit rushed because there were still so many people waiting for a table and the waitress kept asking if we were finished. And if you love Thai iced tea- it was perfect.

Maybe next week the veggies in their dishes will be more Asian and less New Jersey farm. We'll see. Meanwhile, is it true Viet cuisine is taking the place of Thai in the heart of Blyn diners?",2.0
"Great food at great price. However reminds me of the Thai version of Tex-Mex. I've been to Thailand, and this food is tailored to American tastes.",4.0
"We have moved here from Seattle and have been on the hunt for Thai food. It's a must in our Seattle taste buds! Finding Song was the perfect treat! I love the spicy noodles! Perfection! I get it with tofu and everything is perfectly cooked and seasoned. Everything I look for in Thai food. And my Spicy Noodles are priced at the low price of $7.50!  What a deal!! And the portions are huge!I love sitting by the kitchen. I can enjoy the chefs making all the food and stay warm from the kitchen heat. However, I look forward to sitting in the patio this summer. Warning - cash only",4.0
"We had a great experience at Song. I have had my own favorite Thai restaurant in Queens for a number of years, but I was sad to admit that I thought the food/ambiance was better here at the end of our meal.We ordered the chicken curry puffs as our appetizer. The crust was nice and soft and the stuffing was plentiful. I liked the texture but I thought it was a little bland for my taste. Could have done with more seasoning. Pad thai was spot on. Pad kee mao was also good, but could have done with less salt. I'm still giving it five stars because the salt/seasoning imbalances weren't a huge deal... ambiance was really nice, food was pretty cheap, and we had a wonderful date. I would definitely come back.",5.0
"This is by far my favorite Thai food restaurant in New York. I have been going here for years. I will be honest, there are good and bad aspects. The food is fantastic. The green curry is my favorite dish, but I also love the glass noodles. The service is not great - usually slow and inconsistent, but they get you your food eventually and the prices are very reasonable. The quality of the food makes up for any problems with service. Ordering delivery is also somewhat tricky as far as service goes, because when you call there is usually a busy signal. Again, I get through the difficulty of ordering because I love the food so much!",4.0
Perfect spot for cheap Thai food. Great for a date. Priced really well. Drinks are great too. I recommend the skirt steak.,5.0
"I love Song. It's clearly not as good as it once was, and the service has never been great, but for the price can it really be beat?I love the Tofu Pad See Yew. When I'm away from Brooklyn, I long for this place. Still an amazing place to eat.",4.0
"As affordable as it gets in Park Slope. This place won't wow you, but the food is reliably fresh and the servers are attentive without being overbearing. The pad see ew is always good, not covered in brown goop like at some places and the noodles are never overcooked. The curries, however, all pretty much taste the same. Not bad, just not particularly interesting. Good option in Park Slope if you don't want to put up with a crazy wait and don't want to drop too much cash on dinner.",3.0
"Have you ever gone out to one of those Korean joints in Flushing... the ones with the poppy techno music and lots of young load asian kids?  Well Song is the Brooklyn 80s pop middle aged white person version of that.  Just go in, take a seat at the bar and take it all in and you'll see what I mean.  It's not necessarily a bad thing.  In fact, I quite enjoyed my dinner there.The place was crowded on Friday night, so we had to wait for a table.  The bartender was nice, but he seemed a little overwhelmed having to work a crowd like that solo.  Once we were seated and I looked at the menu, I was pleasantly surprised to see how cheap the prices were, and even more surprised at how good the food was after it came!  While I'm not going to compare this to Sripraphai or Pok Pok.... it's a good go-to spot in Brooklyn.  Whatever that sauce was that came with the calamari, damn that was good.",4.0

They always have me coming back! I like to try something new with each visit. The lychee martini and sea food fried rice are probably my favorites. The prices are pretty cheap considering such great food and awesome ambiance. Its a different kind of Thai. Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Brooklyn!

"Song has all the qualities of a great restaurant-trendy, delicious food, and inexpensive.Our couple friends were having a tough time deciding between Song and Joya for our double date night. We decided on Song, but turns out-same owners! Guess they have good taste. When we arrived around 7pm the place only had a few tables filled but by the time we left there was a hefty wait for diners. The décor is modern but still cozy.I ordered a lychee martini which was refreshing & not too sweet. We split some appetizers: fried calamari, fried tiger shrimp rolls, and the fried spring rolls. They were good but the ""fried"" part kind of overpowered all the tastes. Still, I enjoyed them.Of course I ordered my favorite Thai dish-Pad See Yue (sautéed fresh flat noodles with chicken or beef, Chinese broccoli and egg in a brown sauce). So good. A hefty portion as well.My boyfriend had ordered a steak dish which he had ordered medium. It came out extremely well-done. However, after sending it back, the new piece came out perfectly cooked.There was not much of a dessert menu but I was so full that I didn't mind. Cash only which shouldn't be a problem since the prices are very reasonable.",4.0
"I'll start off by saying that Song is one of my favorite Thai spots in NYC. The food is absolutely delicious, the prices are very affordable and the portions are very satisfying. There is one slight problem though- the place is quite smokey, every time I eat there I end up smelling like noodles for a few hours. It would be nice if they could work on their ventilation system.. Also too bad they don't have a lunch special..",4.0
"I have been a fan of this establishment for several years now. I'm kind of a regular, just now sitting down to write reviews of my favorite local spots. Having been here on dates, with colleagues from work, and family, this place has never disappointed me. I've eaten on the table for 2, along the sofa longer table, and on the patio outside. I've even once enjoyed appetizers and drinks at the bar itself. Every time, my experience has been flawless and I'm happy to report my complete satisfaction with this place. One of the owners is often there and he is very courteous. I like places where the owner is actually present from time to time. That reassures me. I've tried lots of things on this menu. My favorites are the chicken curry puffs, pad-see-eew, chicken pineapple rice (requested chicken instead of pork), basil chicken, Green Curry, Panang curry. I like the their drinks overall and most of my friends really enjoy the Thai Iced Tea.You won't be disappointed by the service or the prices. It's a great place. Just be prepared to wait to be seated ... they don't accept reservations and I have had to wait for about 30 minutes on some occasions. I just used to put my name on the list and window shop along 5th Ave or even grab a drink at Loki Lounge across the street (looks like Loki is not open currently/permanently?).",5.0
"Wow - wasn't great before, but we thought we'd give it another try a few years later. This was, without a doubt, the worst takeout I've had in recent memory.  Holy cow was it awful.  Beef and broccoli: beef was thickly cut and clearly boiled in the sauce - no effort to sear it or give it any flavor whatsoever. The curry was so overfilled with carrots that it had a cloyingly icky sweet carrot taste.  And the ""spicy"" noodles had, you guessed it, zero spice. The noodles were one giant clump of slimy broken bits mashed together.In a word, disgusting.  Never, ever will order from here again.",1.0
Let me start by saying the food was very good. Restaurant is beautiful very modern and they have a very nice outside dinning area BUT the wait staff is very rude. I sat down after my wife and kids did (I had to use the bathroom) our waitress came over and asked us to order I felt very rushed. She was very short with us and acted like it was very inconvenient for her to take our orders. She brought our apps and gave everything to the wrong person Maybe if she would have taken more time when we ordered she might have gotten it right. When she came over to get the plates off the table she spilled some of the sauce from the spring rolls on my foot looked at me and then just walked away not sorry not anything. She dropped off the bill and walked away. She did not even ask us of we wanted anything more or how our meal was.  I almost did not tip but I would have felt bad. The only reason I am giving it 2 stars is the food was good.I don't think I will go back again Brooklyn has a lot of good Thai Restaurants that treat you good.,1.0

"If I could give zero stars, I would. Just left this place without even ordering. This was my first time here, found them on yelp. My friend and I walked in, no one greeted us. WE had to walk over to the staff who were clearly trying to ignore us. I said ""Hi, hello..."" What appeared to be the manager, a bartender, and a server just looked at me and turned their heads back around, finishing up whatever conversation they had going on. My friend, being the nice guy that he is said, ""Excuse me, can we get a table."" The ""manager"" put her hand up and said, ""Yes, wait a minute."" The f*ckkkkkkk? Who says that to customers?

"A personal fan of this resturant. Been here a lot of times and have tried a few things on the menu. FOOD: (4 stars) easy, pad see ew with tofu, is incredible and delicious. I always order it and can't complain! Fried calamari, I like the the mango/duck sauce that it comes with, however the calamari was a little under cooked for my liking. Duck&mango spring roll is great too. Keep in mind there prices are good too. 3 people came out to about $15 each in. The one con, is there alcoholic beverages are warm.. Like warm coffee, not sure why, but it reminds me of the United Kingdom and their strange one ice cube per drink policy.Service: (3.5-4 stars) I've been there when it hasn't been busy and I've been there at there worst but they keep it moving and want nothing but the best services. Actual restaurant (4.5 stars) I really like the set up in this joint, really nicely done, and if you get a booth on the left side you can see the chef's work their magic. I would remove the giant picture of a giant child when you first enter. I feel like I'm at one of those feed a child in poverty conventions. Conclusion: best thai in brooklyn if you are looking for something unique, tasty and inexpensive. Hope my review helps you out",4.0

He said 20 mins inside or 30 mins wait to eat outside. We decided thats only a 10 mins difference we will just wait. After 30 mins passed we asked him how long is the wait and then with an extreme attitude he says ""its going to be a while"". SO WHY DID HE TELL US 30 mins?! After that we were frustrated and decided to just sit inside. Our waitress was nice but soooooo preoccupied doing lord knows what because the place was not even packed. She brought my friend a coke with some slimy thing inside of it kind of looked like lettuce or a piece of squid, either way GROSS. All she did was say sorry and take it back. One of my friends ordered chicken pad see yue and ALL of her chicken was burnt. When she told the waitress she said the kitchen was closed so they couldn't make her another dish but she could take it to go if she wanted.

Best Thai food hands-down! Great restaurant that works for a girls night out or an intimate date! Portion sizes are good and service is quick. Love the Thai Ice tea here.

I'm from Boston but whenever I visit New York I make sure to visit Song or their sister restaurant Joya. Their Pad Thai is the best!!,5.0
Ribs were dry as f**k. Calamari was meh. Drunken man noodles was bland. Doesn't have the right spices. It's supposed to be packed with flavor.

My favorite Thai restaurant ever!!! I still have not found a bad meal in this place. My all time favorite is panang chicken and mango salad!!

One of my friends ordered chicken pad see yue and ALL of her chicken was burnt. When she told the waitress she said the kitchen was closed so they couldn't make her another dish but she could take it to go if she wanted. How does that make sense?I will not be returning to song, the food was not that spectacular for me to overlook the bad service.",2.0
Best Thai food hands-down! Great restaurant that works for a girls night out or an intimate date! Portion sizes are good and service is quick. Love the Thai Ice tea here. Chicken pad thai and their ribs are my fave dishes. Giving it 4 stars because they don't take credit cards. Really reasonable prices too!!,4.0
I'm from Boston but whenever I visit New York I make sure to visit Song or their sister restaurant Joya. Their Pad Thai is the best!!,5.0
Ribs were dry as f**k. Calamari was meh. Drunken man noodles was bland. Doesn't have the right spices. It's supposed to be packed with flavor. Bf had the steak which was covered with hot vegetables which continued cooking the steak. Waiter barely came around to check on us. Overall not a great experience.,1.0
"Wait was long but it really was packed so cant really blame them. We sat outside which was lovely, we have all missed the warmth. Didnt love the loose rocks on the ground bc it made it hard to walk [for those of us in heels] but to each their own. Food was great! and cheap! I got the pad see yue with beef which was delicious. Portions are huge. I have no idea what brown sauce is but its fantastic. Def would go back.",5.0
My favorite Thai restaurant ever!!! I still have not found a bad meal in this place. My all time favorite is panang chicken and mango salad!! A++++.  Pad thai is delicious too and their calamari is to die for!!! I moved DC a few years ago but every single time i come back to BK to visit my family i MUST stop here before leaving. Thank You Song!!!,5.0

One summer night Freddy V had the urge for some Yummy Thai food in the Park Slope area.  Wifey and I found Song listed on Yelp as 4 stars and the Yelp ratings never lie!We decided to sit in their out door area towards the back of the restaurant.  The ambiance of Song is really chill.  There are areas where you can fit large parties and smalls parties.  It doesn't seem to get to loud there even though the place can get packed.  The service was top notch.  The Waiters/Waitress make sure you have a wonderful dining experience by waiting on you hand and feet.  They bring out the food faster than Superman changes into his spandex costume.  They are Super Duper happy to serve you and I like that.  Why not?The food was amazing and it satisfied my every palate dream.  I had one of their specials which included Coconut Curry Chicken and Vegetables in my dish.  Soooo goood!!  My wife and I share the Summer Shrimp Roll as usual.I took one star off because I was burping curry the rest of the evening but its not Song's fault.,4.0
"I went to Song last night with a friend of mine. We wanted great Thai food at reasonable prices. Song wins in both categories.People - The spicy beef and pineapple fried rice is to DIE - I mean to DIE for......... it is a must try. This dish is not on the regular menu - it is on the Specials menu.... so please do not miss it.And ofcourse our apps were delicious - the calamari is nice and crispy with that dipping sauce - OMAZING!!!!I also had the sliced chicken, cabbage, carrots, mushroom, and veggies in ginger sauce - DELICIOUS!Best part is you get a big portion of food, reasonable prices, and the food is HOT when it gets to your table.Happy Eating MY PEOPLE!",4.0
"Had the spicy noodles and well, it was ok.

"I've been going to Song for about 5 years now. Actually shocked that I haven't reviewed it yet. Back in 2009 I honestly would've given this place 4 or 5 stars, but sadly, the food isn't quite what it used to be.I ordered 4 things - Tom ka gai soup, Pad See Yue, Pad Thai, and Kang Masaman curry. The waiter was very accommodating and paced our meal out perfectly. The ambiance is modern and trendy, but not in an obnoxious way. There's outdoor seating during warm weather months, as well as indoor, and I love their space. The bathrooms are always incredibly clean, and are actually quite pretty. The music is great, and loud enough to create ambiance, but not so loud as to distract you, or impede on conversation.Tom Ka Gai - The chicken is flavorful and not dry, the balance of coconut and lemongrass is perfection! My fave Tom Ka anywhere! The mushrooms are always fresh, and the sauteed onions add a distinct sweetness, and the fresh sprigs of cilantro puts it over the top (in the best way). You absolutely cannot go wrong with this soup. Notice it listed in my ""last meals before you die"" section of my account page. 5/5Pad See Yue - Pan-fried fat noodles sauteed in a sweet soy sauce, with an added smokey flavor. Not enough greens for my taste (I believe it's Chinese broccoli used), but still quite good. Damn good, even. I requested some additional lime slices and squeezed it on top which brought it from a 4 to a 5, easy. 5/5Kang Masaman - My first reaction to my first bite was that it was *far* too sweet, unfortunately. It tastes like sugar packets were dumped into the curry. The chicken and potatoes were perfectly cooked and seasoned, and the roasted peanuts added a great salty taste and crunchy texture. Unfortunately, overall, the overwhelming sweetness ruined the entire dish for me. If it weren't for this fact, I think the curry would've been delicious. I would order another curry option. 2/5Pad Thai - Sadly, this dish was also far too sweet. Even after squeezing 4 lime slices into it, and eating it with scallions in every bite, to try to balance out the flavor. The noodles are pan-fried, not just boiled, which is a nice touch. The fried egg, smoked tofu, and crushed peanuts are all delicious, and go very well together. Unfortunately it's another dish that would be fantastic if it weren't so sweet. Probably won't be ordering this again from Song. 2/5I wouldn't mind going back here for their fantastic soup and Pad See Yue, but I'd definitely order a different curry, and skip the pad thai.",3.0
"Came here for lunch on Sunday with my boyfriend -- we sat outside and it was nice and enjoyable.Overall, the menu items are cheap and portion sizes are huge!

"I tried Song with my boyfriend about a month ago for our 27th month anniversary. We heard about it through our friends so we thought we would give it a shot. When we entered into the restaurant there was no one to greet us nor was there a front desk. We walked past the waiting area/bar and finally there was a hostess that greeted us and said the wait for a table was around 30 minutes. I was surprised at how packed the restaurant was especially on a Sunday night. 30 minutes later, we were seated and it took 8-10 minutes before a waitress actually came by and finally placed our order.Fried Calamari - I like that you can order a small plate for $6.50 or a large plate for $9.95. We ordered a small plate and unfortunately we had trouble finishing our fried calamari. The calamari was deep fried, but it didn't seem to have any seasoning at all. A little bit of salt and pepper would have made a difference. A sweet Thai chili sauce came with the calamari, but even that didn't help much. Spring Rolls - We ordered the chicken one. The spring rolls were crunchy, tasty, and I liked that there were glass noodles in the chicken spring rolls.Thai Ice Tea - I like to order Thai Ice Tea whenever I'm eating at a Thai restaurant and that's what I did at Song. My Thai Ice Tea didn't appear to be mixed well at all and it was very sweet, sweeter than usual.Pad Thai with Baby Scallops - I'm always in a mood for Pad Thai so since I saw that Pad Thai with Baby Scallops was on the special menu and it sounded so tempting, I decided to order it. It didn't look too appealing and the Pad Thai lacked flavor especially the sweet fish sauce you would taste in most Pad Thai dishes. I also noticed that it was very greasy as well. Pad See Yue - My boyfriend ordered this for his entree and it sure looked better than mine for sure. The beef was seasoned perfectly and was tender. His dish seemed rather oily too, but at least his noodles had flavor and the sweet fish sauce was all there.Would I come back to Song? I don't think so because my boyfriend & I weren't very satisfied with the quality of the food. Nothing about our dinner really ""wow'ed"" me or convinced me to come back.

They kept on interrupting me as I tried to ask them to look up my order by my name and address. They insisted they were busy and continued to talk over me. I don't tolerate that type of treatment, and will be declining payment for their inability to even try and provide customer service, and am now ... currently at 2.5 hours ... still waiting... It's unfortunate when a 'well-respected' restaurant with 'rave' reviews can't even provide a single apology let alone the time for me to speak and inquire without a hostile response on their end.

I was surprised at how packed the restaurant was especially on a Sunday night. 30 minutes later, we were seated and it took 8-10 minutes before a waitress actually came by and finally placed our order.Fried Calamari - I like that you can order a small plate for $6.50 or a large plate for $9.95. We ordered a small plate and unfortunately we had trouble finishing our fried calamari. The calamari was deep fried, but it didn't seem to have any seasoning at all. A little bit of salt and pepper would have made a difference. A sweet Thai chili sauce came with the calamari, but even that didn't help much. Spring Rolls - We ordered the chicken one. The spring rolls were crunchy, tasty, and I liked that there were glass noodles in the chicken spring rolls.Thai Ice Tea - I like to order Thai Ice Tea whenever I'm eating at a Thai restaurant and that's what I did at Song. My Thai Ice Tea didn't appear to be mixed well at all and it was very sweet, sweeter than usual.Pad Thai with Baby Scallops - I'm always in a mood for Pad Thai so since I saw that Pad Thai with Baby Scallops was on the special menu and it sounded so tempting, I decided to order it. It didn't look too appealing and the Pad Thai lacked flavor especially the sweet fish sauce you would taste in most Pad Thai dishes. I also noticed that it was very greasy as well. Pad See Yue - My boyfriend ordered this for his entree and it sure looked better than mine for sure. The beef was seasoned perfectly and was tender. His dish seemed rather oily too, but at least his noodles had flavor and the sweet fish sauce was all there.Would I come back to Song? I don't think so because my boyfriend & I weren't very satisfied with the quality of the food. Nothing about our dinner really ""wow'ed"" me or convinced me to come back. Tip: This restaurant is CASH only.",3.0
"If I could give zero stars I would. It has now been 2 hours since I placed my order. I phoned after one hour as a courtesy to inquire whether my order was ready. They said it was 15 minutes from being finished. Okay. No prob. After 2 hours I am now not happy. I phoned again - they didn't let me speak. They kept on interrupting me as I tried to ask them to look up my order by my name and address. They insisted they were busy and continued to talk over me. I don't tolerate that type of treatment, and will be declining payment for their inability to even try and provide customer service, and am now ... currently at 2.5 hours ... still waiting... It's unfortunate when a 'well-respected' restaurant with 'rave' reviews can't even provide a single apology let alone the time for me to speak and inquire without a hostile response on their end. This is my first order based off of reviews and if my food ever arrives will be my last order.",1.0
Keep calling when the busy signal hits- they do not have call waiting a la 1985 but it is worth the speedail- best Thai food in park slope and great prices- a very good place to bring a date- fancy but will not hurt the wallet,5.0
"Best Thai takeout in the neighborhood. I used to live in Carroll Gardens and went to Joya all the time. I was psyched that their sister restaurant is in Park Slope.The best dish is their green papaya salad. It is way better than any of the other Asian places in the neighborhood. Their pad thai is also AWESOME but you have to ask for it spicy, otherwise it's kind of bland. Skip all the appetizers except the curry puff. The curries are where it's at. Flavorful, fresh with lots of veggies, really tasty. Especially anything with garlic basil sauce... yum!",5.0
"Went here to celebrate my boyfriend moving to the neighborhood. The great reviews on yelp gave us reason to endure the 30 minute wait. The food was eh, appetizers (fried shrimp roll) totally disappointing but yes the portions are huge and it's cheap.

"I've been going to Song since 2006 and the fact that I haven't stopped going does say something, although only twice a year just about and no more than three. Song has great prices but their food can be a real hit or miss. Lately it's been a lot  more of a miss. The Pad See Yeu (doesn't matter which meat/tofu option you choose) is always full of flavor but when you get one of their specials or entrees you're rolling the dice something serious. The ingredients seem to be lacking freshness and even decent temperature control. For example, the duck and mango summer rolls on our last visit could have been great, except the texture of the duck varied inside the roll from too soft to incredibly chewy, much like a terrible jerky. The beef and broccoli was also incredibly bland and I was disappointed.  Curries also vary in their quality and flavor depending on when you go. Sometimes it's great, sometimes it's lacking but it's never truly terrible. I've found that the kitchen seems to produce the best results when it's not overly busy, so a lunch-time stop might yield a better culinary experience than a busy weekend dinner; this is with the assumption that they just over/undercook their meat and not use the least freshest options they could which is honestly not out of the question based on the appearance and funky smell of certain meats/seafood options. Song deserves 2.5 stars because of how polarized dining experiences can be but I'll give them three for old times sake. Better Thai restaurants have popped up but for the price, the drink options (decently priced crafts, OK amount of house wines) and the not overly pretentious vibe, 3 is fair.  Service is never outstanding, and never terrible. You'll wait for your drinks a lot longer than you should; as in your halfway done with your appetizer and your glass of wine is still in limbo. Also, I WOULD take away a star for an incident a few years ago, when they got somebody in my dinner party really sick with what I believe to have been less-than-fresh calamari. However, it was my ex and if I remember correctly she really had it coming that night. Thus instant star redemption.",3.0

Making a valuable first impression, the decor of Song elicits only excitement for ones meal. You're invited by a half-hidden dining room which pulls you straight to your chair as it comes to full-view past the bar.

Not because it's long, but because everything looks and smells just good enough to be yours.We started with the Papaya Salad, which was sweet and refreshing. It prepped the bellies for mass consumption and cleansed the palettes of the day's less desirable, lingering flavors. A dip into the 'specials' menu netted us the fresh salmon spring roll-type thing. It's good that I don't remember its name. The flavor whisked me into forgetful ignorance. Bliss, you could say. The dish, in short, was a promise of goodness to come. The salmon was indeed fresh, and the roll did indeed taste like spring. The soft and chewy wrap complemented the crunchy vegetable fillings perfectly.I got a salad next. One of the menu salads. A hefty salad. The veggies were fresh, the dressing on point. And though I regret getting the salad for only the right reasons (I wish I had ordered more curries, but I'll get to that later), I was really glad that I got it with shrimp. Perhaps my only gripe of my entire Song experience was the size of that shrimp, as they were really quite small. But they tasted perfect, which more than makes up for it. After all, it's not about the size of the shrimp but how you cook it. Succulent and just barely briny, they snapped in perfect harmony with my sparkling taste buds. But the real stars of the night were the entrees. Let's get one thing straight, people. The spicy noodles are just balls to the wall. I cannot remember a noodle dish in my life that was as comforting and satisfying as Song's spicy noodles. A month long trip to Italy gave me access to perhaps the world's best noodles, and they were plenty comforting and delicious. But there's something about Italian noodles that leaves you wanting more, and not necessarily in a good way. I guess the power of olive oil and tomatoes can only take you so far. Perhaps credit can go to the greasiness of these Thai noodles, or perhaps to the egg and vegetables that give them more weight, but Song's spicy noodles made me feel like a child again. This was the transcendent moment of the melody. A sharp turn and inflection from the sweet and and refreshing scale of the two salads and salmon spring roll, the spicy noodles shook me to my bone's stomachs with a concord of heavy flavors and lingering heat.As if I couldn't already go home satisfied, my next course was the pork in green coconut curry. I might kill myself if I continue to type a legitimate response to this meal. I really, really miss it and wish I was there right now, yesterday, and tomorrow. But I will say that the green curry was a perfect end to our meal, a sweet, spicy, and creamy overture that had a lasting impression on my taste buds and ear drums. I had it last to allow the curry to cool, as it came out piping hot. And it was well worth the wait, as it really was the perfect note to leave on.The unfairly-good food was coupled with really friendly and attentive service, which were both underscored by a great playlist, further underscored by some of my favorite songs - ""Black Milk"" and ""Angel"" by Massive Attack.Song is a Massive Attack - on your taste buds, but not on your wallet, surprisingly.

I absolutely love this place! The restaurant itself is beautiful. I've been here twice. We sat inside and outside. The inside has great ambiance. The outside seating is very serene. The staff is very friendly and quick.I ordered chicken pad thai. It is one of the best pad thais I have had as of yet. I put a ton of delicious chili sauce they offer into it making it the perfect combination for me. We ordered drinks and they are quite strong. The mojitos are awesome. I tried some of my friends' dishes and they were delicious too. The curries are very tasty but once again the pad thai is to die for.,5.0
"I am so in love. I can't believe how great of a deal this place is. The food is DELICIOUS and the price is pretty hard to beat.I ordered the spicy noodles with shrimp. I was beyond pleased with the dish. The shrimp was plentiful and cooked to perfection. The texture of the noodles was spot on. And there was actually a good amount of veggies. More than just the standard peppers, the dish also included cabbage which was a pleasant surprise. All in all, a yummy yummy dish and well worth the price for the taste and portion.

"It was my first time at Song. It was on a Friday night around 9PM and the restaurant was packed. We were told the waiting time for a table was twenty minutes. This particular Thai restaurant is very different compare to the other Thai restaurants in the Park Slope area. They have a bar, big dinning area than the usual one hallway, and the music was a mixture of EDM, hip-hip, and top 40. It's a pretty casual, trendy place--from the decor to the music. I noticed they had an outdoor area but it was raining that night. I don't remember the drink menu but they had little beer options. My friend and I ordered the mango salad, summer roll, and pad thai. I enjoyed all the food except for the summer roll dish. I wasn't a big fan of the sauce. Overall, a good restaurant.

Once you talk to one of these people instantly ruined they are so rude there, its impossible to not want to punch them in the throat. After sitting us at our table, we waited for about 20 mins before someone came to take our order. During the ordering process the waiter was acting like he was bothered he was rushing us to order.

"We have been to Song at least 20 or 30 times and tonight was the last time.  It was one of our ""go-to"" spots for a cheap and tasty meal.  It's kind of like you get what you pay for, but all the servers are usually friendly, the crowd is unpredictable but tolerable, and the music is loud but drowns out the kids and annoying diners.Tonight was our last meal at Song.  First, the table next to us left because of a giant roach sighting.  (I saw that she posted a comment already on here!)Then, we noticed lots of flies on the walls and eventually landing on our uneaten food.Last, we were about to leave when my son and the boy at the table next to us started drumming their chopsticks on the booth bench.  Out of nowhere a short, white guy pops out and wags his finger at us all and mumbles that he's just had the chairs cleaned or something. (I obviously can't hear him due to the loud music which I love/hate.)I ask my child to stop and he does.  The child nextdoor continues.  The manager returns and wags his finger at me again.  I jumped up and explained that the other boy does not belong to me and he goes off on this rampage about how it cost him $8000 to replace the torn upholstery in the bench.  Really?  This is the first time I've seen this guy in all the times we've been to Song.  I'm assuming from prior reviews that customer service / putting on a happy face is not his strong suit.  But now that I know that such an obnoxious person is running the show we will no longer be supporting them.  I feel bad because the waitstaff is usually very sweet.  However, there are plenty of other cheap and tasty Thai options in the neighborhood to choose from that will turn a blind eye to (1-minute's-worth of) drumming chopsticks.",1.0

"i didn't like this place at first but it's really close to our house and was the only decent thai place in park slope. after awhile i realized the awesomeness that is SONG.The restaurant is roomy, modern and they have a beautiful backyard. Club music plays because thats just how all asian places roll. The service is meh but again that is very common in asian restaurants. They want you in and out! But the food. Oh. My. God.They have THE BEST pad see ew. Soft noodles covered in rich brown sauce steaming hot. I don't know what they put in this noodle dish but it is amazing. Don't worry it's not super salty, just really flavorful. Their curries are really good too. The green curry is tasty, the veggies are fresh and great huge portions! Their roast chicken is ok, there's a Thai place in manhattan that does it better but SONG's is decent. The Thai fried rice is great, a little sweet, perfect meat to rice to veggies ratio. The beef fried rice is very good as well.Their prices are unfreakin-believeable!!!!  How do they afford to stay in business charging people so little for such amazing food with huge portions?!!!

"Best Thai food restaurant in the city!! (from what's I've tried at least). The only down side is the wait time.  If you come after 7-8pm, you may be waiting 30mins to 1 hour. They have a bar area when you enter and you may also sit in the outdoor area when the weather is warm enough.The food is awesome! The price is cheap!  The portion is big! What else can you ask for?Note: they are cash onlySuggestion:Pad see yeuPad Thai******Fried calamari*******",5.0
"This has to be my 2nd fave Thai restaurant. I tend to order from their specials opposed to the regular menu. They have a great bar and good lychee martinis. The drawback is that they only accept cash. Which I can understand it keeps costs lower but I never carry cash! But, other than that the food is great. I continue to go back.",4.0
Very good food and the prices are cheap!!! Huge portions too. It gets a bit unorganized when it is packed.,4.0
"So I came here last night with my wife and another couple. We walk In to the place trying to think positive because of what we have heard about it...... Once you talk to one of these people instantly ruined they are so rude there, its impossible to not want to punch them in the throat. After sitting us at our table, we waited for about 20 mins before someone came to take our order. During the ordering process the waiter was acting like he was bothered he was rushing us to order. The only reason this place got 2 starts Is because of the some of the food was pretty good and the prices are great. ... but the thai ribs weren't good at all, horrible! ! I will not be coming back here !!!!",2.0
"Downgrading after a previous upgrade bc of the absolutely terrible customer service. I tried to,order delivery the other night and was constantly hung up on when I didn't get a busy signal. Two telephones continually redialing for fifteen minutes and we never got thru. Busy signals and hang ups. Like, I could here people talking in the background and then disconnected.What is up with this place???",2.0
"We have been to Song at least 20 or 30 times and tonight was the last time.  It was one of our ""go-to"" spots for a cheap and tasty meal.  It's kind of like you get what you pay for, but all the servers are usually friendly, the crowd is unpredictable but tolerable, and the music is loud but drowns out the kids and annoying diners.Tonight was our last meal at Song.  First, the table next to us left because of a giant roach sighting.  (I saw that she posted a comment already on here!)Then, we noticed lots of flies on the walls and eventually landing on our uneaten food.Last, we were about to leave when my son and the boy at the table next to us started drumming their chopsticks on the booth bench.  Out of nowhere a short, white guy pops out and wags his finger at us all and mumbles that he's just had the chairs cleaned or something. (I obviously can't hear him due to the loud music which I love/hate.)I ask my child to stop and he does.  The child nextdoor continues.  The manager returns and wags his finger at me again.  I jumped up and explained that the other boy does not belong to me and he goes off on this rampage about how it cost him $8000 to replace the torn upholstery in the bench.  Really?  This is the first time I've seen this guy in all the times we've been to Song.  I'm assuming from prior reviews that customer service / putting on a happy face is not his strong suit.  But now that I know that such an obnoxious person is running the show we will no longer be supporting them.  I feel bad because the waitstaff is usually very sweet.  However, there are plenty of other cheap and tasty Thai options in the neighborhood to choose from that will turn a blind eye to (1-minute's-worth of) drumming chopsticks.",1.0

"i didn't like this place at first but it's really close to our house and was the only decent thai place in park slope. after awhile i realized the awesomeness that is SONG.The restaurant is roomy, modern and they have a beautiful backyard. Club music plays because thats just how all asian places roll. The service is meh but again that is very common in asian restaurants. They want you in and out! But the food. Oh. My. God.They have THE BEST pad see ew. Soft noodles covered in rich brown sauce steaming hot. I don't know what they put in this noodle dish but it is amazing. Don't worry it's not super salty, just really flavorful. Their curries are really good too. The green curry is tasty, the veggies are fresh and great huge portions! Their roast chicken is ok, there's a Thai place in manhattan that does it better but SONG's is decent. The Thai fried rice is great, a little sweet, perfect meat to rice to veggies ratio. The beef fried rice is very good as well.Their prices are unfreakin-believeable!!!!  How do they afford to stay in business charging people so little for such amazing food with huge portions?!!! Maybe its a mob front. That's the only explanation. But I don't care I hope SONG stays the same forever because I will be going there for Thai food forever.",5.0

"The place is trendy, rather cheap for Park Slope, but is cash only. I went here years ago and, overall, I think the quality has declined. Don't get me wrong, the food was good, but not good enough to keep me from exploring. For instance, the beef was dry and over-sauced. The curry puffs (my absolute favorite thing to order at a Thai restaurant) were a bit soggy. Is it good, solid, Thai food? Yes. Is it worth going out of your way for? I'd say no.",3.0
"We went here on a Saturday afternoon during lunch when it was not too busy, and we ordered the pad thai and beef massaman curry.  I really did not like the food, and and I felt this way even when I was pretty hungry (which is a bold statement because everything tastes good when I'm hungry).  The pad thai was way too sour and  the shrimp was overcooked. The beef in the massaman curry was overcooked and had no favor (it could have been mystery meat for all I know), and I feel like it should have had some more vegetables (at least some onions, and maybe some peppers like i've seen at  other restaurants).  the only redeeming factor is that this place is pretty cheap but i'd rather pay an extra dollar per entree and go eat at Mee thai just down the street on 5th ave for good thaiCool atmosphere, and they have a lot of space which I guess makes this place more kid-friendly.  Still, it wasn't enough to make up for the bad food and indigestion i had all day long.",2.0
*This place is Cash Only**It's been years since I ate here. I have also visited their sister locations Joya and National. I prefer Song and Joya over national. Really good Thai food.

"WHY IS YELP HIDING MY REVIEW??? The owner of Song is racist, sexist and rude. Multiple reviewers have stated this objectively. Yelp please leave our reviews alone and let people know about this owner. Thank you. 5/16/2015 2015 Racism lives well in Brooklyn. I just left Song on 295 5th Ave. Brooklyn, NY with my best friend. The owner sat 3 white couples that came after us ahead of us. I know we were ahead of them because when they each came in they asked us if we were already being helped. We said yes we were signed in already. The owner called all three white couples ahead of myself and the two black females who were ahead of us. I asked owner, white male, why did he seat 3 groups of white customers ahead of us? He said \\\""they are regular customers that eat here a lot. I can do whatever I want in my restaurant. I don't know you, I know them."" I'm pretty sure he lied about knowing the 3 white customers due to the nature of their interaction. They gave him their names and he wrote it down on his little notepad. If he knew them and they were regular customers who spend a lot of money, as he explained, he would've known their names. He said I own 3 restaurants. JOYA included. We got into a verbal argument. I could not believe he felt comfortable telling me that he could do whatever he wanted in his restaurant. I informed him that there were laws against discrimination and I would take the necessary action. I told the 8 Black people waiting what happened. I said you guys really need to not eat here. Including the two black women who were ahead of us. None of them made a move to leave.

The Bad- Ordered take out and they forgot to give me part of my order- Cash only- Thai House Salad (not that great in comparison to other thai salads....but it does come with 2 pieces of tofu)- Updated: Dined in this time and slow service when half the place was empty. Where is my water?!? I've been waiting for the past 10 minutes and it has yet to come...The Good- Gai Pad Khing (chicken)---not that spicy...it's average- Kang Koong (shrimp)-- yummy..not that spicy though..spicy would've made it better- Tofu Pad Khing--tastes like regular chinese fast food The Bottomline- It's okay. Check it out if you are nearby. Too much people during night time. Food is decent. Prices are decent. You do the math.,3.0
"I had dinner here tonight. We ordered the calamari appetizer to start, and beef pad thai.The calamari was deep-fried, but didn't seem to have any seasoning whatsoever. A little salt and pepper would have gone a long way, but honestly, I would have preferred marinara or tartar sauce over Mae Ploy sweet chili sauce. The beef pad thai was OK. The beef didn't have any seasoning, and was dry and hard. Tofu was tasteless. Flavor is OK, but missing a little something and spice. I thought it was soy sauce, and asked for soy sauce, but that's not it. It tasted better with a little sweet chili sauce mixed in. I actually like Luck Thai's (at 5th Ave/6th Street) pad thai better, but find that it's a bit greasy..What's up with the creepy picture of the little girl on the wall? I had the misfortune of sitting at a table facing that wall art. It didn't make my food taste any better. And, final notes: service wasn't very attentive. Yes, they fill your water glass, but don't expect for anyone to ask how the food is. No salt and pepper shakers on the table, so if you need it, ask for it. Also saw a little tray with 4 kinds of condiments like chili oil. Why don't they just leave that at all the tables?",2.0

Also, I would probably pass on the fried spring rolls (chicken) appetizer. It had a weird chemically smell. :( That was the only dish here I didn't like that much, but for the price, I didn't mind.

"It was my first time at Song Thai and it started off well. The service was good, but I didn't like that from the start the workers were trying to rush my friends and I because we came at 10 PM and they close at 11 PM. I work at a restaurant and there are people who stay way past closing and we do not rush them. We only stayed 20 minutes past closing and they were shutting off the lights and turning them back on to rush us out. They also kept trying to take our plates while we were still eating. I wouldn't come here again. And I recommend that if you decide to come here that you come earlier in the day so that you don't have to be rushed!!",3.0
"If you live in the neighbourhood, you're well acquainted with Song.  You're familiar with the sugary, brown, glop curry sauces reheated for the third time today.  You have a working knowledge of the bizarre, Kafkaesque delivery order system where you may be placed on hold for in excess of 10 minutes, abruptly hung up on without warning or screamed at over a cacophony of kitchen clatter and general pandemonium.  You'll dread walking past 1st Street on garbage pick-up day, when the air is thick with the stench of two dozen bags of putrid, saccharine kang panang and pad thai detritus.  Then you'll get sick of the place very quickly if you aren't already.Sure, the average main course sets you back around 9 bucks, but you can achieve the same culinary finesse by putting a C-Town breast of chicken in a skillet with a couple of Reese's cups for less than half the price.  You could also go to one of the other 462 Thai restaurants in Park Slope, none of which are great, but all of which are at least as good (or bad) as Song yet involve none of the nonsense (I prefer Sai Thai on the corner of 5th Ave & 9th St.)If you feel so inclined as to queue for an hour for all of the above on a Friday night, it's fair to note that the waitstaff are very friendly, if struggling to cope with the volume of tables.",2.0

"Absolutely LOVE this place! I always feel so comfortable there. It's nice (like semi-dimly-lit-nice) yet casual. It could be a date spot, yet you could roll in with your sweats and T-shirt. After a crazy gym work-out, I came to Song at around 9:30PM in my dirty shorts and sweaty T-shirt (at that hour I was seriously too hungry to shower for fear I might faint in my tub!), and yet I didn't feel at all out of place! As pretty as the restaurant is, they oddly provided a comfortable environment for all. Mind you, I'm not saying that everyone should start coming into the restaurant in boxers and long-johns. No need to take advantage of their amazing hospitality.Speaking of hospitality, they were great with the water refills and the timeliness of the food orders. If you're a carb-lover, this is your DREAM! We got the:Spicy pork and pineapple fried rice: 3/5. I really liked the pineapple, which gives the dish a nice sweetness, but the pork was very dry. And even though they said 'spicy' it was really REALLY mild. I was a bit sad about that.Spicy noodles: 4/5! And especially since my rating is on a bell-curve, a 4 out of 5 is pretty darn good! My friend got this one, and I was literally trying to get myself NOT to eat off his plate. Green papaya salad: 5/5! I know this appetizer might sound weird to you, but it was FREAKING GOOD! Especially if you're one of those people who's even REMOTELY into pickled stuff. I honestly think they should have made this into a real salad rather than an appetizer. In the end, I paid a RIDICULOUSLY SMALL amount of money for the amount of food that I got and for the beautiful milieu. Yeaup, I am definitely coming back again soon!",4.0
"You could probably walk through Park Slope and lose count of the trendy Thai places you pass after only a few blocks. First off, you should have better things to be doing than counting things like a little child. Second off, very few establishments out of this Thai restaurant surplus in the area are actually any good.Song is one of these few. Mighty good, at that, as well as mighty affordable.The Homemade Chicken Curry Puffs appetizer are a clear stand-out, despite having not yet been called up for a spot on the everyday menu, but appearing rather as part of the specials (which still seems to be the same roster each day, mind you - semantics, I know). Curry is a far cry from being a buzzword for me the way prosciutto, duck, and fried are (some people have a sweet tooth, I have a really salty tooth), so I was a bit surprised myself how much I loved these hot and tasty, meat-filled pastry pockets the first time I tried them. And since then, they've remained a staple with each visit. Face your curry demons! Embrace the curry flavor!Anyway. The Fried Calamari is another worthy appetizer, for sure. You may not think much about ordering them at first. Then, you will see table after table around you with huge piles of squid goodness and be food-envied into flagging down the waiter to tack just one more item onto the bill. Lightly breaded, and served with a very nice Thai sweet chili sauce, the small, at $4.25, is more than enough for two people. And trust me - this is coming from a recovering glutton. I've been in a dark, fat place before, people.Then there's the Pad Thai. The biggest portion of Pad Thai I've ever had at any Thai joint. Seriously, I feel like a giant dump truck of noodles had to back up and unload itself onto my plate before it was brought to the table. I think the technical measurement here is a shit-ton. I don't know, I don't speak Metric system. But this shit-ton of Pad Thai is delicious, having seemingly found that wonderful, much sought-after happy medium between too soupy and not enough sauce. Plus, it's $6.95 and sure to yield leftovers for tomorrow's lunch.The staff, however, is something else. The host will barely acknowledge you, and when your table is ready, he will not say a word even when asked a direct question, he will walk no more than two steps away from the front bar, and he will simply point you to your table from across the room. He even hands the menus off to some server or busboy to bring to you well after you've been seated. Rough day at the office, I see.And while it doesn't get much better with the servers, I'm afraid, I really can't hold cold, stand-offish service entirely against Song as a whole. I've grown accustomed to the notion that the cooler-than-thou robotic antics of the staff are to be expected and it's always good for a laugh or two as part of the experience.Song is perfect for entertaining friends not from the area. Its stark yet chic interior, outdoor patio, full bar, and occasional DJ set can paint a pretty impressive picture of what the hood has to offer, if that's how you aim to show off The Slope to some new folks. That, and you won't be subjecting them to typical New York prices. Song is easily my favorite Thai restaurant in the area and certainly on the short list city-wide. You should go. I've just given you a shit-ton of reasons to get yourself there, after all.",4.0
"The food and drinks are great and the price you're paying for them is even better. The staff isn't really friendly but I guess you can't really win all of the battles. Most prices are $8 and drinks are $10. The outdoor patio is extremely cute and romantic. I will be coming back to this place and I highly suggest the pomegranate mojito (it's one of the best I've ever had). And they are no longer cash only, they accept everything but Amex.",4.0

"Song Thai restaurant is definitely on my list of my top 5 favorite restaurants. Everything in this restaurant is delicious. Everything! I enjoy the atmosphere of song. It's very modern and trendy. On the weekends they bring in a dj who plays tunes while you have dinner or drinks. Fun! Now for a restaurant that looks as good as it does and uses quality( and I mean the best) ingredients as they do, the prices should be sky high. But guess what? A dish on there menu doesn't even run you $8.00!. If you order from the chefs special menu the price of your entree can go up to $14.00 the most!...big whoop! Now keep in mind their dishes are really big, so you can even share. There's soo many things on this menu that I absolutely love. I used to always order the ""Gai kratiam"" with chicken. It's pieces of chicken with veggies like, carrots, cabbage, broccoli and onions sauteed with this divine garlic sauce and served with white rice. They also have this really good catfish that's usually on the chefs special menu, it comes with broccoli and is also served in a garlic sauce. That sauce is really addictive. I recently started ordering chicken and glass noodles which is now my favorite dish which I have been ordering all the time. Chicken and delicate glass noodles with broccoli and carrots, cabbage and onions. Yum. Their selection of fried rice is also good. I love rice and can eat it everyday and they make it really well. My preference would be the ""spicy seafood fried rice"" or the ""chicken and broccoli"". From the appetizer section, hands down you have to order the calamari. It may be my single favorite thing from the whole restaurant. They serve this sauce with it that's sweet and tangy and sour and is also really addicting. I also recommend the ""mango salad"" very refreshing and yummy. They have a ""papaya salad"" too that's also really good. On the chefs menu they have a appetizer section as well, and they sometimes put on there these ""chicken wings"". If you see those, make sure to get them! Song also has a full bar, and although I've never really had a drink from there before, they look delicious and fruity from what I've seen. I have tried their ""Thai iced tea"" which I always order cause I love it and they make a ""fruit punch"" this is really good! I have no idea what they put in it, but its fruity and delicious. I live the staff at song, always friendly and they definitely aim to please there customers, they will accommodate you're order to you're preference without any problem. Never had a bad experience here, its always delicious and fresh. Sidenote: they only except cash! Blah!",5.0
"They definitely weren't friendly but the pad thai was good. Not sure if the food was good enough for me to return when the service is so poor. I don't remember anyone speaking to me or asking if I was ok. Also, love the outside seating area. But then one of the workers came outside to put pillows into their storage area which was right next to my table. I think I must have been invisible because I had to move out his way numerous times so he would stop touching me and interrupting my meal. Very weird experience if I must say.",2.0
"The food in this place is amazing.  The prices are reasonable, the portions very generous and most importantly, the food tastes great.  I'm very familiar with what thai dishes should taste like, and this is comparable to food you'd get in Thailand.  I would recommend any of the shrimp dish entrees as well as the pad thai, and any of the fried rice options. Regarding the service, I've seen the reviews about the bad service, but that's not at all what I've experienced.  Have been here twice and each time had very nice waitresses.  Even the hostess was not bothered when we wanted to move inside after having a table in their lovely outside garden area. This is my family's new favorite Thai restaurant.",5.0
"Easily the best Thai food in Park Slope. Delicious, pretty fast delivery, big portions. It's owned by the same folks as Joya, and the food is consistent (although, I can't speak to the atmosphere at Song - they're my delivery go-to). Nothing is amazingly inventive, but everything is good.",5.0
"Pros- Song is a beautiful restaurant with a backyard space. My glasses were always filled with water, thanks to a busy working staff.Cons- CASH ONLY! no reservations! 1)Underseasoned fried calamari; you must drench your seafood in sauce to get some flavor. 2) Beef pad see ew was too sweet and the over cooked beef was hard to chew. 3) Fried rice was too salty (no wonder my water glass was always filled)Maybe the chef was having a bad day, but it is no excuse to serve poor food to paying customers.",2.0
"I love this place, I used to live a block away from it and now I have to hike over here every time I crave it :(They finally redid the place so there is a bit more room, but the food here is delicious and always cooked to order so it's ALWAYS piping hot, even when I take-out and bring it back (20min trip). My favorites are the calamari (the dipping sauce is even better!), the Chicken Fried Rice (heavenly, filling, and loaded with veggies too!- DEFINITELY use the lemon they give you, really brings out the flavors), and the Spring Rolls. I also had something with noodles, chicken, and broccoli/cabbage but I don't remember the name, and it was yummy in a brown sauce, but I love their rice so much I can't bear to order anything else and the portions are so huge I really COULDN'T order anything else.

I rarely see this place empty.I forgot to mention the service here, it's not terrible but they aren't stellar. I have never had a mix up with my food and given that it's always crowded I find they are timely in serving people and getting them in and out, but no one is super friendly or helpful, they just do their job, which is kind of nice and why I love coming here for date night, you can focus on your date/friends/family without some cheery waitress coming over three times saying how we doing folks?

"Absolutely LOVE this place! I always feel so comfortable there. It's nice (like semi-dimly-lit-nice) yet casual. It could be a date spot, yet you could roll in with your sweats and T-shirt. After a crazy gym work-out, I came to Song at around 9:30PM in my dirty shorts and sweaty T-shirt (at that hour I was seriously too hungry to shower for fear I might faint in my tub!), and yet I didn't feel at all out of place! As pretty as the restaurant is, they oddly provided a comfortable environment for all. Mind you, I'm not saying that everyone should start coming into the restaurant in boxers and long-johns. No need to take advantage of their amazing hospitality.Speaking of hospitality, they were great with the water refills and the timeliness of the food orders. If you're a carb-lover, this is your DREAM! We got the:Spicy pork and pineapple fried rice: 3/5. I really liked the pineapple, which gives the dish a nice sweetness, but the pork was very dry. And even though they said 'spicy' it was really REALLY mild. I was a bit sad about that.Spicy noodles: 4/5! And especially since my rating is on a bell-curve, a 4 out of 5 is pretty darn good! My friend got this one, and I was literally trying to get myself NOT to eat off his plate. Green papaya salad: 5/5! I know this appetizer might sound weird to you, but it was FREAKING GOOD! Especially if you're one of those people who's even REMOTELY into pickled stuff. I honestly think they should have made this into a real salad rather than an appetizer. In the end, I paid a RIDICULOUSLY SMALL amount of money for the amount of food that I got and for the beautiful milieu. Yeaup, I am definitely coming back again soon!",4.0
"You could probably walk through Park Slope and lose count of the trendy Thai places you pass after only a few blocks. First off, you should have better things to be doing than counting things like a little child. Second off, very few establishments out of this Thai restaurant surplus in the area are actually any good.Song is one of these few. Mighty good, at that, as well as mighty affordable.The Homemade Chicken Curry Puffs appetizer are a clear stand-out, despite having not yet been called up for a spot on the everyday menu, but appearing rather as part of the specials (which still seems to be the same roster each day, mind you - semantics, I know). Curry is a far cry from being a buzzword for me the way prosciutto, duck, and fried are (some people have a sweet tooth, I have a really salty tooth), so I was a bit surprised myself how much I loved these hot and tasty, meat-filled pastry pockets the first time I tried them. And since then, they've remained a staple with each visit. Face your curry demons! Embrace the curry flavor!Anyway. The Fried Calamari is another worthy appetizer, for sure. You may not think much about ordering them at first. Then, you will see table after table around you with huge piles of squid goodness and be food-envied into flagging down the waiter to tack just one more item onto the bill. Lightly breaded, and served with a very nice Thai sweet chili sauce, the small, at $4.25, is more than enough for two people. And trust me - this is coming from a recovering glutton. I've been in a dark, fat place before, people.Then there's the Pad Thai. The biggest portion of Pad Thai I've ever had at any Thai joint. Seriously, I feel like a giant dump truck of noodles had to back up and unload itself onto my plate before it was brought to the table. I think the technical measurement here is a shit-ton. I don't know, I don't speak Metric system. But this shit-ton of Pad Thai is delicious, having seemingly found that wonderful, much sought-after happy medium between too soupy and not enough sauce. Plus, it's $6.95 and sure to yield leftovers for tomorrow's lunch.The staff, however, is something else. The host will barely acknowledge you, and when your table is ready, he will not say a word even when asked a direct question, he will walk no more than two steps away from the front bar, and he will simply point you to your table from across the room. He even hands the menus off to some server or busboy to bring to you well after you've been seated. Rough day at the office, I see.And while it doesn't get much better with the servers, I'm afraid, I really can't hold cold, stand-offish service entirely against Song as a whole. I've grown accustomed to the notion that the cooler-than-thou robotic antics of the staff are to be expected and it's always good for a laugh or two as part of the experience.Song is perfect for entertaining friends not from the area. Its stark yet chic interior, outdoor patio, full bar, and occasional DJ set can paint a pretty impressive picture of what the hood has to offer, if that's how you aim to show off The Slope to some new folks. That, and you won't be subjecting them to typical New York prices. Song is easily my favorite Thai restaurant in the area and certainly on the short list city-wide. You should go. I've just given you a shit-ton of reasons to get yourself there, after all.",4.0
"The food and drinks are great and the price you're paying for them is even better. The staff isn't really friendly but I guess you can't really win all of the battles. Most prices are $8 and drinks are $10. The outdoor patio is extremely cute and romantic. I will be coming back to this place and I highly suggest the pomegranate mojito (it's one of the best I've ever had). And they are no longer cash only, they accept everything but Amex.",4.0

"Song Thai restaurant is definitely on my list of my top 5 favorite restaurants. Everything in this restaurant is delicious. Everything! I enjoy the atmosphere of song. It's very modern and trendy. On the weekends they bring in a dj who plays tunes while you have dinner or drinks. Fun! Now for a restaurant that looks as good as it does and uses quality( and I mean the best) ingredients as they do, the prices should be sky high. But guess what? A dish on there menu doesn't even run you $8.00!. If you order from the chefs special menu the price of your entree can go up to $14.00 the most!...big whoop! Now keep in mind their dishes are really big, so you can even share. There's soo many things on this menu that I absolutely love. I used to always order the ""Gai kratiam"" with chicken. It's pieces of chicken with veggies like, carrots, cabbage, broccoli and onions sauteed with this divine garlic sauce and served with white rice. They also have this really good catfish that's usually on the chefs special menu, it comes with broccoli and is also served in a garlic sauce. That sauce is really addictive. I recently started ordering chicken and glass noodles which is now my favorite dish which I have been ordering all the time. Chicken and delicate glass noodles with broccoli and carrots, cabbage and onions. Yum. Their selection of fried rice is also good. I love rice and can eat it everyday and they make it really well. My preference would be the ""spicy seafood fried rice"" or the ""chicken and broccoli"". From the appetizer section, hands down you have to order the calamari. It may be my single favorite thing from the whole restaurant. They serve this sauce with it that's sweet and tangy and sour and is also really addicting. I also recommend the ""mango salad"" very refreshing and yummy. They have a ""papaya salad"" too that's also really good. On the chefs menu they have a appetizer section as well, and they sometimes put on there these ""chicken wings"". If you see those, make sure to get them! Song also has a full bar, and although I've never really had a drink from there before, they look delicious and fruity from what I've seen. I have tried their ""Thai iced tea"" which I always order cause I love it and they make a ""fruit punch"" this is really good! I have no idea what they put in it, but its fruity and delicious. I live the staff at song, always friendly and they definitely aim to please there customers, they will accommodate you're order to you're preference without any problem. Never had a bad experience here, its always delicious and fresh. Sidenote: they only except cash! Blah!",5.0
"They definitely weren't friendly but the pad thai was good. Not sure if the food was good enough for me to return when the service is so poor. I don't remember anyone speaking to me or asking if I was ok. Also, love the outside seating area. But then one of the workers came outside to put pillows into their storage area which was right next to my table. I think I must have been invisible because I had to move out his way numerous times so he would stop touching me and interrupting my meal. Very weird experience if I must say.",2.0
"The food in this place is amazing.  The prices are reasonable, the portions very generous and most importantly, the food tastes great.  I'm very familiar with what thai dishes should taste like, and this is comparable to food you'd get in Thailand.  I would recommend any of the shrimp dish entrees as well as the pad thai, and any of the fried rice options. Regarding the service, I've seen the reviews about the bad service, but that's not at all what I've experienced.  Have been here twice and each time had very nice waitresses.  Even the hostess was not bothered when we wanted to move inside after having a table in their lovely outside garden area. This is my family's new favorite Thai restaurant.",5.0
"Easily the best Thai food in Park Slope. Delicious, pretty fast delivery, big portions. It's owned by the same folks as Joya, and the food is consistent (although, I can't speak to the atmosphere at Song - they're my delivery go-to). Nothing is amazingly inventive, but everything is good.",5.0
"Pros- Song is a beautiful restaurant with a backyard space. My glasses were always filled with water, thanks to a busy working staff.Cons- CASH ONLY! no reservations! 1)Underseasoned fried calamari; you must drench your seafood in sauce to get some flavor. 2) Beef pad see ew was too sweet and the over cooked beef was hard to chew. 3) Fried rice was too salty (no wonder my water glass was always filled)Maybe the chef was having a bad day, but it is no excuse to serve poor food to paying customers.",2.0
"I love this place, I used to live a block away from it and now I have to hike over here every time I crave it :(They finally redid the place so there is a bit more room, but the food here is delicious and always cooked to order so it's ALWAYS piping hot, even when I take-out and bring it back (20min trip). My favorites are the calamari (the dipping sauce is even better!), the Chicken Fried Rice (heavenly, filling, and loaded with veggies too!- DEFINITELY use the lemon they give you, really brings out the flavors), and the Spring Rolls. I also had something with noodles, chicken, and broccoli/cabbage but I don't remember the name, and it was yummy in a brown sauce, but I love their rice so much I can't bear to order anything else and the portions are so huge I really COULDN'T order anything else.

"Song is hands down the most delicious Thai food I've ever had. And I've had A LOT of thai food.

It was dirt cheap, and an absolutely giant portion. I always finish my Thai food and I am embarrassed to admit that I could not finish this and took home nearly half of it for lunch the next day.I had the Sweet Riesling there and it was good. Really decently priced too (I think only $6 for a glass). We were seated right away, and our waitress was really nice. Very quiet, but really quick about everything and patient when we couldn't figure out what the heck we wanted. I can't remember what my friends had, but nobody was disappointed.

"Scratching my head at how people have given this place 5 stars. While reviewers may vote this as the ""best"" neighborhood Thai restaurant. That does not say much.

Both replacement dishes were no different and gave up.  Fried Calamari although crispy was entirely flavorless without the dipping sauce (A little salt and pepper would do wonders). Red Snapper was decent but still nothing to rave about. I've been to Thailand 3 times and I understand the Thai food here is unfortunately catered to the American pallet making it unauthentic. I can live with that, but the food I experienced at this particular night was just a big fat Fail. I wont be going back. Even if it is affordable.  Don't fool yourselves hipsters. This is not authentic Thai food. Oh and the place gets really loud.",1.0
The food here is so good. This definitely one of the best Thai in the area. Their service is fast but I felt like we were being a little rushed to provide seating for the next customers.

"The previous reviews are true. The staff does not acknowledge you once you walk through the door. A few friends and I were standing against the wall across the bar for about 10min. They didn't even ask us our names or how many we were. Clearly they would see someone there. I told one of the people that we have been waiting for a table for awhile now. She clearly knew that and said that the host is busy talking to some customers. She gestured to the bartender with a hand gesture for ""chatting"". Come on, don't just stand there do nothing when numerous customers who came in to spend good money are waiting.After waiting we were finally seated. There is only one booth there and that was one of the only pluses of the night. The other was our waiter. He was really polite and on his ""A Game"". I wish I could say the same about the host (I think he was the owner too).Now about the food...We each ordered our own noodle dish and shared a large appetizer. We ordered a large plate of Calamari. The squid was perfectly fried in a light batter. It lacked a bit of salt, but it was still tasty. The sweet and sour sauce that came with it really made it good.For the main course I had the Shrimp Pad Thai. There was about 10 pieces of shrimp which was good. You get a good serving of Pad Thai which was really delicious. Probably one of the bests I've had in NYC. Not the best, but filled me up real good.The place is spacious and the bathrooms are clean. The kitchen is open so you can see what's going on. 1 Star for the Food1/2 Star for the cleanliness1/2 Star for the awesome waiter (he was cool, others were not)-1 Star for CASH ONLYAll in all is was an ""ehhh ok"" experience.

"This review is long overdue, but first, an anecdote:Several years ago I had the great fortune of living across the street from Song, and I would eat their food (either take out or dine in) maybe once or twice a week.  One afternoon, I called in an order for myself and two girlfriends, and we specified that we would be picking it up.  After 15 minutes we ran across the street to get our food and were told that they had accidentally sent it out with the delivery guy.  The hostess (?) apologized profusely and set us up at the bar with a round of Thai iced teas, on the house, while we waited for the guy to come back with our food.  He arrived maybe 10 minutes later, we retrieved our food, and the hostess, still apologizing, gave us all of our money back - about $35.  And to top it all off, our food wasn't even cold!  Such a great moment in customer service.Now after a five year hiatus, I'm back in the neighborhood and Song was at the very top of my ""must eat"" list, and it was just as good as I remembered.  Fresh, light, delicious.A few things to note if you plan on dining in:  1) Be prepared to wait.  This place gets BUSY. 2) Song is not some dingy Thai take out place.  It is a restaurant, with restaurant quality atmosphere, food, and cocktails.  3)  Get the mango sticky rice.  I'm not even sure if it's on the menu, but you can get it and you should.",4.0

Awesome food for the price. I love the mussels and fried calamari. Can't go wrong with the pad tai noodles.,5.0
"Very good pad thai:-noodles are fresh, very well cooked, and do NOT stick to each other like most other places.-flavor was spot on; savory and not sweet-ordered the shrimp + 2 orders of chicken; shrimp were small and could have been bigger, but it's 8 or 9 bucks people.Papaya salad was okay; not that spicy but freshCalamari was good that night; not tough like others have said, but quite tenderKoong Krapow was okay; good chili basil sauce with shrimp",4.0
"Scratching my head at how people have given this place 5 stars. While reviewers may vote this as the ""best"" neighborhood Thai restaurant. That does not say much. The food is mediocre at best, inedible at worst. Our table had the spicy noodles which was overly salty and tasted of burnt wok residue. Sent back twice. Both replacement dishes were no different and gave up.  Fried Calamari although crispy was entirely flavorless without the dipping sauce (A little salt and pepper would do wonders). Red Snapper was decent but still nothing to rave about. I've been to Thailand 3 times and I understand the Thai food here is unfortunately catered to the American pallet making it unauthentic. I can live with that, but the food I experienced at this particular night was just a big fat Fail. I wont be going back. Even if it is affordable.  Don't fool yourselves hipsters. This is not authentic Thai food. Oh and the place gets really loud.",1.0
The food here is so good. This definitely one of the best Thai in the area. Their service is fast but I felt like we were being a little rushed to provide seating for the next customers. I would definitely go on a week day rather than the weekend. The prices are great I just wish that their spicy noodle was rice noodle instead of wheat,4.0
"The previous reviews are true. The staff does not acknowledge you once you walk through the door. A few friends and I were standing against the wall across the bar for about 10min. They didn't even ask us our names or how many we were. Clearly they would see someone there. I told one of the people that we have been waiting for a table for awhile now. She clearly knew that and said that the host is busy talking to some customers. She gestured to the bartender with a hand gesture for ""chatting"". Come on, don't just stand there do nothing when numerous customers who came in to spend good money are waiting.After waiting we were finally seated. There is only one booth there and that was one of the only pluses of the night. The other was our waiter. He was really polite and on his ""A Game"". I wish I could say the same about the host (I think he was the owner too).Now about the food...We each ordered our own noodle dish and shared a large appetizer. We ordered a large plate of Calamari. The squid was perfectly fried in a light batter. It lacked a bit of salt, but it was still tasty. The sweet and sour sauce that came with it really made it good.For the main course I had the Shrimp Pad Thai. There was about 10 pieces of shrimp which was good. You get a good serving of Pad Thai which was really delicious. Probably one of the bests I've had in NYC. Not the best, but filled me up real good.The place is spacious and the bathrooms are clean. The kitchen is open so you can see what's going on. 1 Star for the Food1/2 Star for the cleanliness1/2 Star for the awesome waiter (he was cool, others were not)-1 Star for CASH ONLYAll in all is was an ""ehhh ok"" experience. I just wish the staff was more prompt. The food was really tasty and the place is clean.If you wanna come here... All I can say is GOOD LUCK to you.",2.0
"this place is good. Its not great. but like any other place you get what you pay for.i came here for a family birthday dinner. we ordered the fried spare ribs, which were weird and tough. the wings had nice flavor though.I ordered the shrimp and skirt steak in garlic sauce. i ordered my steak medium rare. it came out well done. i sent it back because i refused to eat it. they made a new one and that one came out well done too. i guess the next time i wont order steak from here. my shrimp, however, were cooked perfectly. They gave you an assortment of hot seeded oils, which are delicious.i like that they have a separate curry menu, since it is an aquired taste.",3.0
Good and fresh. Service was very fast. Loved the steamed veggie dumplings. Best plate at the table was the tofu pad woon sen & the tofu pad Thai. Spicy mustard on the spring rolls was a good twist I've never had. Would recco it for fast service :),4.0
"Food is pretty good. Service is atrocious. I cannot emphasize how SLOW it's been, every time.I feel as though the cooks were learning to make food for the first time, every time I have gone. It can't be coincidence. It just can't. Stir fried food should not take 25-35 minutes in a restaurant with 2 other tables occupied. Really can't imagine going back unless I'm feeling risky.",2.0
"This review is long overdue, but first, an anecdote:Several years ago I had the great fortune of living across the street from Song, and I would eat their food (either take out or dine in) maybe once or twice a week.  One afternoon, I called in an order for myself and two girlfriends, and we specified that we would be picking it up.  After 15 minutes we ran across the street to get our food and were told that they had accidentally sent it out with the delivery guy.  The hostess (?) apologized profusely and set us up at the bar with a round of Thai iced teas, on the house, while we waited for the guy to come back with our food.  He arrived maybe 10 minutes later, we retrieved our food, and the hostess, still apologizing, gave us all of our money back - about $35.  And to top it all off, our food wasn't even cold!  Such a great moment in customer service.Now after a five year hiatus, I'm back in the neighborhood and Song was at the very top of my ""must eat"" list, and it was just as good as I remembered.  Fresh, light, delicious.A few things to note if you plan on dining in:  1) Be prepared to wait.  This place gets BUSY. 2) Song is not some dingy Thai take out place.  It is a restaurant, with restaurant quality atmosphere, food, and cocktails.  3)  Get the mango sticky rice.  I'm not even sure if it's on the menu, but you can get it and you should.",4.0
"My friend and i decided to come check this place out for their high reviews and ratings. The decor was nice and has a outdoor spot too. The service was pretty good for 1 waiter and had like 15 tables. it wasnt that packed. We ordered a thai ice coffee, tiger shrimp spring rolls, summer roll from the lunch special, Pad See Yue and woon sen. The thai ice coffee was not even the normal thai ice coffee and tasted bad. The spring rolls were okay not great. the summer roll was their own interpretation but it was still bad. the pad see yue noodles and woon sen noodles tasted very salty. the dishes looked like it was made by someone who doesnt even want to be there. very lazy to even plate the dishes. the noodles were a big blob of wet sloppy noodles that were stuck together and impossible to just grab some to eat without the whole plate sticking to it. the plates were very dirty with black spots When we finished ordering our dishes they didnt even start cooking until 5 mins later, no one was at the kitchen doing anything, it was empty. dispite the grade pending sign should of been our first clue that it wasnt gonna be good. Their woks werent even washed after using and was just dumped on the box of dishes to be washed. everyone there seemed like they didnt care and very unprofessional. NOT GOING BACK",2.0

"I have gone to song atleast 100 times throughout my life and there are many many more times to come. The restaurant itself is very welcoming and the atmosphere is great. It's a perfect spot to grab lunch or dinner. They have a bar, indoor seating and when it's nice they open the back patio for outdoor seating which is very enjoyable on a cool day. The service is on point. The waiters are fast and efficient, they check on you a perfect amount throughout the meal, not too much, not too little. The food always comes out super fast which is a huge huge plus!The calamari is very good. It's nothing you would get served at a seafood house but for where the location is and how cheap it is I definitely recommend the calamari. The best part is the sauce that comes with it! As for meals, I have tried the pad tai (best pad tai I have EVER eaten). I got pad tai from a few different places before and nothing compares. Also the fried rice is delicious, chicken and pinapple. You can't go wrong. And the newest addiction has been the kong kyo wuan gai. That is absolutely delicious, the green coconut curry sauce is amazing!

The only thing that I thought was truly knockout was the papaya salad... here we begin (and trust this is much more pleasant then the last Thai place I reviewed.. Galanga, rest assured this is less scathing!)My boyfriend and I have been meaning to come here for a while because of all the hype... we took a stroll down 5th ave around 9:30 last night and snagged a table right away- even if it was ""next to the kitchen.""  (Why would the hostress ask if we minded being near the kitchen? I love to watch them cook! And plus I could have used that greasy fire to warm up on a cold, cold night :P)  So, Score!  No wait, like I've heard.  It was bumping for a Wednesday night... in quiet Park Slope, too.   Ambiance is cute, trendy, with lots of chatter and happy birthday singing. Decor is plain; but fine.The service is a bit rushed- as I figured they have folks waiting.  I felt I'd just sat down and barely looked at the menu and the waitress was already coming over, scribbling away.  We didn't try any drinks (though will next time, it is quite bar-y). Their Thai Ice Teas looked tall and delish.  I was actually planning on eating light as I'd gone out on a work outing before and had 2 slices of nasty ass pizza, chased down by some beer. (gross, the things you do to climb the corporate ladder...) but I'd be meaning to try this place for a while, so alas I had twoooooo dinners (piggy!)Firstly, nothing is over $10...hardly. Unless you get a special entree of fish or duck or something... then you have to pay up $15 (whoop!).  But I suggest stick with the carby classics here (didn't have the Pad Thai so I can't vouch for that...)  The one bad thing is that I did not see Spicy Basil Fried Rice... Wtf!  I did see spicy pork with pineapple fried rice though (looked interesting, if only I ate pork!)We started off with the papaya salad.  Yum!  Perfectly coated with that lemon juice/and fish sauce dressing... best dressed and fresh papaya salad I've had in a long time and the portion size was beyond adequate.  This was somewhere around $3.50. Wow!  It's true the ingredients aren't much but the taste and way of preparation was spot on... prolly the best thing I tried all night.  A star just for this.For my main (oink oink!), I got the Spicy Noodle with chicken. This was pretty much drunken noodles. Always good, always a staple. Nicely spicy and greasy (not greasier than usu though).   The boy got the green curry with chicken... I honestly didn't try much of this because I steer clear of coconut milk (and they don't have a coco milk free curry option as most Thai joints do) and was so full but the tiny droplets I had also tasted pretty standard. They didn't bother to ask if we wanted dessert (haha), assuming I was Asian they probably thought I wanted to be in and out but what can you expect for a $25 dollar meal (in total), service-wise.  Cash only and understandably so if they can keep their prices down (unlike Galanga).  I would go again if I want standard Thai comfort food but I do feel the high reviews are deeply swayed by the low prices (but I guess that's reason enough!).  Food doesn't wow... it does the job but isn't eye opening (or THAT authentic).... the weirder, hard to get dishes are at places at Sripraphai (amazing! in Woodside) and Rhong-Tiam in Grammercy.",4.0

"Song is the sister restaurant to Joya on Court Street in Cobble Hill. The food is essentially the same which is no easy feat when you open a second location. The prices are equally as cheap, so cheap that it makes you wonder how they manage to keep costs so low considering the neighborhood. Still, from the delicious taste of the food, I know they aren't skimping on the quality of the food or ingredients. Perhaps the wait staff are indentured servants or perhaps they own the buildings. You can pretty much order anything on the menu and not be disappointed with one exception: Take caution with anything involving mango as the ripeness of the mango can be hit or miss. Like Joya, Song has the best Pad Thai I've ever had. Also the best Tom Ka Gai...best Pad See Yue.......best spring rolls...best curry...you get the picture.Song is not quite as loud as Joya and being in the Slope, a bit more family friendly though you tend to see more school age children than the baby & toddler scene. It's just too cramped to attempt to bring in a stroller though Song is more roomy than Joya. I do love this place and the only drawback for me is that the wait times can be a bit long especially on weekends and the bar area is just too tight for all the throngs of hungry customers waiting for their tables.

"Thai food in NY = delicious cheap eats. And in my opinion, Song is one of the best in the area.It's spacious and open with a great back terrace - perfect for summer days + nights. The inside is pretty minimal and modern. The service is meh - a little snooty, not very friendly, but the bartenders are nice. Note that on weekend evenings, between the music by the DJ area + the overall buzz of conversation, it can get really loud inside. I doubt I'm saying anything new when I say the food is delicious. I mean, seriously delicious, and never seems to miss the mark. You can name practically anything on the menu and I can tell you it's great. My personal picks: calamari (always crispy, never rubbery, red chilli dipping sauce is so good), vegetarian pad see yue (the sauce is spicey, but not overly so), gai kraprow (spicy basil sauce is for serious spice folks), and the red curry (I know this is a staple of every Thai place in NY, but it is so so good here).

"After my 4 star review of this place, I decided to re-visit it but this time, do delivery instead.  The result?  Oy vey...Delivery logistics of this place really need to be worked on.  Before I placed my order, they confirmed with me that they do deliver to my address.  After taking my address and noting the cross street, I proceeded to order.  Since I placed my order at around 2:15 PM, I figured since it was after the lunch rush, delivery would be here in no time.I wasn't paying attention to the time, and 45 minutes later I'm all, ""WTF, mate?""  So I call, explain that my order was put in 45 minutes ago, and ask if they can give me an estimated time of arrival.  ""What is your address?  Is it on this street or this avenue?""  Dude, you have my address!  Of course it's on this street... I gave you the cross street as a guide!  And then they proceed to tell me that they don't have the cell number of the delivery man so they have no idea where he is.  Really?!Magically, 10 minutes later my food arrives.  I ordered the veggie pad thai, which wasn't bad, and since they had a $10 minimum for delivery, I also ordered the fried tofu with mild peanut sauce.  This dish could also use some work, seeing that tofu doesn't have much taste to begin with and the peanut sauce didn't have much flavor either... so to me that dish was a bust.Again, prices here are good, but it's starting to look like dishes are hit or miss.  And the delivery!  Oh, the delivery.",3.0

The curry was not spicy at all - how can you call this Thai food when it's barely spicy and not flavorful at all? Thai food is full of tons of ingredients and chili with a bold array of tastes. Needless to say he was pissed to have wasted a meal on such terrible food.My pad thai was exceptionally bland and Im pretty sure had no actual peanuts in it. No spice either..and giant chunks of uncooked scallions.

I'm a VERY happy customer when I go to Song! It's:1) Cheap2) Delicious3) FastCan't ask for better - oh and the portions are huge so you have left overs for the next day.,5.0
"After my 4 star review of this place, I decided to re-visit it but this time, do delivery instead.  The result?  Oy vey...Delivery logistics of this place really need to be worked on.  Before I placed my order, they confirmed with me that they do deliver to my address.  After taking my address and noting the cross street, I proceeded to order.  Since I placed my order at around 2:15 PM, I figured since it was after the lunch rush, delivery would be here in no time.I wasn't paying attention to the time, and 45 minutes later I'm all, ""WTF, mate?""  So I call, explain that my order was put in 45 minutes ago, and ask if they can give me an estimated time of arrival.  ""What is your address?  Is it on this street or this avenue?""  Dude, you have my address!  Of course it's on this street... I gave you the cross street as a guide!  And then they proceed to tell me that they don't have the cell number of the delivery man so they have no idea where he is.  Really?!Magically, 10 minutes later my food arrives.  I ordered the veggie pad thai, which wasn't bad, and since they had a $10 minimum for delivery, I also ordered the fried tofu with mild peanut sauce.  This dish could also use some work, seeing that tofu doesn't have much taste to begin with and the peanut sauce didn't have much flavor either... so to me that dish was a bust.Again, prices here are good, but it's starting to look like dishes are hit or miss.  And the delivery!  Oh, the delivery.",3.0
"I don't care what anyone says. My favorite Thai restaurant. Yes it's a long wait, yes it's sometimes noisy, and yes there is a rushed feel. But when that food comes, it all fades away. Me and my now husband have been going here consistently for 5 years. The staff has gotten to know us, and let's just say they take care of their loyal patrons. The calamari is always on point and the green curry is perfect. I honestly wouldn't change anything about this place, or their other 2 locations, Joya & National.",5.0
"My husband got the red curry with shrimp and veg. I got the peanut pad thai.The red curry came out pink because they put too much watered down coconut milk in it and the shrimps still had their tails. My husband ended up with bland watery coconut milk on his face from trying to rip those tails off. The curry was not spicy at all - how can you call this Thai food when it's barely spicy and not flavorful at all? Thai food is full of tons of ingredients and chili with a bold array of tastes. Needless to say he was pissed to have wasted a meal on such terrible food.My pad thai was exceptionally bland and Im pretty sure had no actual peanuts in it. No spice either..and giant chunks of uncooked scallions. At one point we traded plates to try each other's food and were both unimpressed.Never going back, what a waste of a meal.Plus they're cash only - what is this the Lower East Side?",1.0
We would definitely come back. Cash only!,4.0
"I love the atmosphere and they had this nifty DJ spinning some really good tunes.  A little loud but fun nonetheless.  The waitstaff was friendly and the food served quickly.  My nephew and I both had curries that were fabulous!  I had a hard time not devouring the entire heaping bowl of it in one sitting.  The food is accessible, if you will, to people not as adventurous.  My nephew's GF never had Thai before and was a little worried she'd like it.  Turns out her worry was unnecessary.  Yum! The only thing that stinks and seems to be common place in Brooklyn is that they do not accept credit cards.   I'd expect that in a rural New York state like Potsdam or Tupper Lake but Brooklyn?  Bizarre",4.0
"Very good restaurant, I love thai food and Song really makes amazing traditional dishes.The place is nice but noisy, service is fast.

"This review is based mainly on their chicken satay and fried calamari appetizers, which were not memorable and bad, respectively. The chicken is tender, while still maintaining nice grill marks. It comes with a generous serving of peanut sauce and pickled onions. The peanut sauce is chunky, with bits of crushed peanuts mixed in it, and it was probably the best part of the meal. At $5 for four skewers, it's a pretty sweet deal.The calamari, however, is bland and chewy. The batter is crispy, but tasteless. The calamari itself is a chore to eat - almost like you're chewing gum, except you're not, and you need to swallow. You really need to dip each piece into the sweet tangy sauce it comes with for it to taste like anything. Maybe that's why it's so cheap. A large order comes in a heaping portion enough to feed four to five people, and it's only $9.50.I wanted so badly to like Song based on good reviews from friends. Unfortunately, the food I had was mediocre at best, and that's being a little generous. Although I enjoyed the satay, it was no different from other satays I've had.

Let's say that we felt like VIP's,pretty cool, huh!. I had the Spicy shrimp noodles, with Thai iced tea,the proportion of the dish was a lot. The Thai iced tea was pretty good,but I can't compare it to any others, since this happened to be my first time drinking this libation. I really love this place, the only minor con I have, is the lack of customer service, I felt that the service was cold,no sense of hospitality, but who cares, after having a huge plate of delish spicy noodles, with Thai iced tea,complaints are left in the back burner. Oh, one last thing I forgot to mention, the prices here don't hurt at all.Super cheap!",4.0
"The service was horrible.  Surly hostess who didn't bother to get off the phone when seating us, waiters who got angry when we asked for more water.  In addition, had no qualms about almost hitting you in the face with their arms because they were annoyed that they had to do their jobs and pick up the plates.  There are better Thai options in Park Slope.  If you want a pleasant dining experience do not go here.    To be fair, the food was OK but that is not way to treat your customers.",1.0

Our plan was to have a picnic of asian food at Prospect Park. I really loved the pad thai! When it ain't orange, it's already a good sign. It's annoying when people say they've had the best pad thai in Thailand and compare every pad thai dish to that. Well, I am going to be annoying. I've had pad thai in Thailand, and it was the best. Ever!This one was really close to that. There's this smoky sweet flavor. Try it. Some might not like it because it isn't what they're used to. But I'd definitely come back here for more Thai food.

Their food is amazing! both times I got the seafood fried rice and both times it was a hit! my girlfriend had the spicy noodles and pad thai (on separate occasions) and they were great too. the atmosphere is also nice: dimly lit, good music, and good table spacing so you're not sharing appetizers with strangers.you can knock them for not accepting credit, but the entrees are seriously $8-10 for a nice sized portion. and appetizer, two entrees and a beer ran about $28. Just hit the ATM and pay up because its worth it!",5.0
"I guess Song can be hit or miss.  The one thing that I love there is their massaman curry.  It basically a coconut curry with chicken, potatoes and peanuts.  My bf was very disappointed the last time he had it bc there weren't any peanuts in his curry.  I like their calamari, but only bc they give the spicy lemony sauce.  Without the sauce, it pretty much doesn't taste like anything.  The pad thai is hit or miss.  Sometimes it's good and sometimes there's too much fish sauce in it.  I can tell, I'm Vietnamese.  The one great thing about this place has to be their prices.  So cheap!!  I'd go here again just bc it's decent food for the price.",3.0
"So delicious.  SO CHEAP.  I'm going to minus one star for bad calamari and the fact that there was so much food I was in a coma for like an hour and couldn't move.But really good Thai food, really cute restaurant and seriously so cheap. $7 entrees. $20 bottle of pinot.  I'm in love. ( Again, minus the calamari)Spicy noodle and curry was delicious. The apps were meh - the calamari as previously mentioned was not good and the summer roll was good. I didn't really get a spice factor - but then again I can withstand so much heat.  So ask for extra spicy if you like it hot.",4.0
I love this area in Brooklyn.  My boyfriend and I met up with friends and their daughter here.  We were seated comfortably....the service was great and we loved their chicken friend rice.  A little gem along 5th avenue indeed.,4.0
"This is my review of Song. I like the hip, coolness, homey, decor of this place. Me and my date got to to sit in the corner booth close to the patio doors. Let's say that we felt like VIP's,pretty cool, huh!. I had the Spicy shrimp noodles, with Thai iced tea,the proportion of the dish was a lot. The Thai iced tea was pretty good,but I can't compare it to any others, since this happened to be my first time drinking this libation. I really love this place, the only minor con I have, is the lack of customer service, I felt that the service was cold,no sense of hospitality, but who cares, after having a huge plate of delish spicy noodles, with Thai iced tea,complaints are left in the back burner. Oh, one last thing I forgot to mention, the prices here don't hurt at all.Super cheap!",4.0
"The service was horrible.  Surly hostess who didn't bother to get off the phone when seating us, waiters who got angry when we asked for more water.  In addition, had no qualms about almost hitting you in the face with their arms because they were annoyed that they had to do their jobs and pick up the plates.  There are better Thai options in Park Slope.  If you want a pleasant dining experience do not go here.    To be fair, the food was OK but that is not way to treat your customers.",1.0
"I didn't know how to enter the building. Please tell me I am not the first...My boyfriend figured it out. So smart. In case you're like me (which I hope you aren't), the door is on the left side... where there's a handle...We ordered Shrimp Pad Thai to go. Our plan was to have a picnic of asian food at Prospect Park. I really loved the pad thai! When it ain't orange, it's already a good sign. It's annoying when people say they've had the best pad thai in Thailand and compare every pad thai dish to that. Well, I am going to be annoying. I've had pad thai in Thailand, and it was the best. Ever!This one was really close to that. There's this smoky sweet flavor. Try it. Some might not like it because it isn't what they're used to. But I'd definitely come back here for more Thai food. The ambiance is typical (as in Brooklyn red bricks awesome so cool typical).",4.0
"great place, still love the atmosphere, they used to have a dj on weekends, it's been a while since I've seen one, it's fine with me the music was too loud, the food is always great, love eating there, the prices are affordable =), the bar is okay, it's great place to come with some friends and looks fancy enough to come with for girl on a casual date. the only downside is their hours, they close early, so it's more like an early evening type of spot in my book.",4.0
"I am seriously stuffed. A meal for 6 people...all stuffed for $21 each. How good can that get? really. Plus it was my friend's bday and she got a complimentary bday banana stuffed spring roll with ice cream kinda thing that was very tasty. The place is not very flashy from the outside but when you walk in you are glad that it's actually bigger inside...widens out. My group and I did a meal share thing...ordered a few appetizers, entrees and pretty much each person dug in.Each person also had a tasty thai iced tea. I just loved the price ...you can't beat that with a bat. PLUS it's not like you are eating tree bark served at a cheap price. It's good food for a cheap price.",4.0

"As a recent transplant to NYC (and a prominent member of Foodies Anonymous), I'll admit that a cross-borough trek won't stop me from trying out a restaurant. So with a solid four stars and over 400 reviews, Song looked like a good choice for me and my roommate when we found ourselves hungry in Park Slope.1.5 stars for service. I understand that restaurants can get busy, but I shouldn't have to flag down a hostess in order to get a table. And judging from the fact that I had to repeat my question about an item on the menu 3-4 times, I think our server spoke as much English as I speak Afrikaans. (Read: none.) Also, I don't think I should have to scan the room to find someone to refill my water. Every. Time.1 star for the inside. The ""modern, sleek"" interior could not be any louder. Throughout our meal, my roommate and I couldn't stop staring outside towards the back, where it looked quieter and less crowded. (That probably explains why the wait to sit outside was 20 minutes longer.) It was a combination of the blaring house music and the fact that you could breathe on the people sitting at the next table.3 very generous stars for food. We ordered shrimp pad thai and a small plate of fried calamari, both of which were alright but nothing to write home about.Does Song deliver on its patrons' expectations? I guess. Cheap and decent food. But ""getting the job done"" and ""doing the job well"" done are two different things. Maybe we should try take-out next time.",2.0
"I love Song takeout! I always get delivery, since the place is rather small, and it arrives within about half an hour, piping hot. Favorites: Pad See Ew, the fresh vegetable rolls, and the curries. Just make sure you speak clearly over the phone; sometimes they have trouble hearing you.",4.0
"*~*~*~Sing a Song of sixpence with a pocketful of Thai~*~*~*My Italian friend invited me for dinner saying he knew of a great Thai place in Park Slope. Funny enough I walked by this place months back, hypnotized by the inviting window view and chef's juggling in the kitchen. I was intrigued gazing at the action-packed flames blazing in the distance. So I was not only pleasantly surprised- but EXCITED to finally be summoned past these doors, For a Tuesday night I was amazed how packed this place was. Having worked in more than a handful of restaurants and having restauranteur parents, I tend to analyze all aspects of a busy place, tho' am the most low-key and perhaps ideal restaurant goer.  It's about food & the overall dining experience. Looking @ the big picture to see what a place has to offer- & if worthy of a REPEAT.From the outside, other than the kitchen, it's non-deskript until you enter, and pass the bar to see this huge dining room, dimly lit, but with a lively vibe. We were seated within a few minutes with menus, and our friendly waitress acknowledged us a few later.While my belly could only afford so much Song and dance, I had a hard time making a decision. The list of items on the menu all sounded so enticing. It's definitely a large menu. But having lived in LA for 12 years where there's not only THE largest Thai population outside of Thailand, AND has the world's ONLY Thai Town, I won't lie. I've had more than 2 hecks of a lot of Thai food ranging from hole-in-the-wall takeout to mini sit-down, to even larger spots to include the place with the talented singing Thai-Elvis- whose a TOTAL riot!  Naturally on the west coast are where my favorite spots for Tom Kha Kai, and another for bootie-kicking Rad Naa are.IF you ONLY want amazing food and can't handle the people factor or business of a place, ""Thai"" takeout. IF you want a place to hang and DON""T require HIGH maintenance, the food won't disappoint. I went for a spicy basil noodle- and was so content I licked the platter clean. Also tried C's Rad Naa- which was dang tasty.  My dear Thai friend in LA always reminds me, if you don't succeed, Thai Thai again. So for those that didn't like - I would suggest Thai-ing again- on a less busy night. Next trip I hope to surf on appetizers with a group.  OVERALL, food was solid, service was up to par- no complaints, and ambiance on a Tuesday- was spot on. Oh- and prices AND portions are VERY decent/generous. So I give it a 4. Sorry- no pandas seen or expressed on my visit. I'm offended by that previous remark - when it's blatant you're not pointing and shooting- and the chefs are woking each plate/order individually. BUT HEYYYY...sing a Song of sixpence with a pocketful of rye- I DID. And WILL Thai it AGAIN! (o_O)",4.0
"Having been here several times more, I can still definitely say this is my favorite Thai restaurant in NYC!  Song's specials are delish!  This evening, I had fried whole striped bass with massaman curry sauce, potatoes, carrots and peanuts.  Such a unique and flavorful dish!  And it was only $13.95, for a whole fish!!The outdoor garden seating is absolutely beautiful!  I went there during the summer and it's so nice and relaxing.You can't go wrong with any dish here at Song.  Excellent food, beautiful decor/ambience, and ridiculously low prices!",5.0

"As a recent transplant to NYC (and a prominent member of Foodies Anonymous), I'll admit that a cross-borough trek won't stop me from trying out a restaurant. So with a solid four stars and over 400 reviews, Song looked like a good choice for me and my roommate when we found ourselves hungry in Park Slope.1.5 stars for service. I understand that restaurants can get busy, but I shouldn't have to flag down a hostess in order to get a table. And judging from the fact that I had to repeat my question about an item on the menu 3-4 times, I think our server spoke as much English as I speak Afrikaans. (Read: none.) Also, I don't think I should have to scan the room to find someone to refill my water. Every. Time.1 star for the inside. The ""modern, sleek"" interior could not be any louder. Throughout our meal, my roommate and I couldn't stop staring outside towards the back, where it looked quieter and less crowded. (That probably explains why the wait to sit outside was 20 minutes longer.) It was a combination of the blaring house music and the fact that you could breathe on the people sitting at the next table.3 very generous stars for food. We ordered shrimp pad thai and a small plate of fried calamari, both of which were alright but nothing to write home about.Does Song deliver on its patrons' expectations? I guess. Cheap and decent food. But ""getting the job done"" and ""doing the job well"" done are two different things. Maybe we should try take-out next time.",2.0
"I love Song takeout! I always get delivery, since the place is rather small, and it arrives within about half an hour, piping hot. Favorites: Pad See Ew, the fresh vegetable rolls, and the curries. Just make sure you speak clearly over the phone; sometimes they have trouble hearing you.",4.0
"*~*~*~Sing a Song of sixpence with a pocketful of Thai~*~*~*My Italian friend invited me for dinner saying he knew of a great Thai place in Park Slope. Funny enough I walked by this place months back, hypnotized by the inviting window view and chef's juggling in the kitchen. I was intrigued gazing at the action-packed flames blazing in the distance. So I was not only pleasantly surprised- but EXCITED to finally be summoned past these doors, For a Tuesday night I was amazed how packed this place was. Having worked in more than a handful of restaurants and having restauranteur parents, I tend to analyze all aspects of a busy place, tho' am the most low-key and perhaps ideal restaurant goer.  It's about food & the overall dining experience. Looking @ the big picture to see what a place has to offer- & if worthy of a REPEAT.From the outside, other than the kitchen, it's non-deskript until you enter, and pass the bar to see this huge dining room, dimly lit, but with a lively vibe. We were seated within a few minutes with menus, and our friendly waitress acknowledged us a few later.While my belly could only afford so much Song and dance, I had a hard time making a decision. The list of items on the menu all sounded so enticing. It's definitely a large menu. But having lived in LA for 12 years where there's not only THE largest Thai population outside of Thailand, AND has the world's ONLY Thai Town, I won't lie. I've had more than 2 hecks of a lot of Thai food ranging from hole-in-the-wall takeout to mini sit-down, to even larger spots to include the place with the talented singing Thai-Elvis- whose a TOTAL riot!  Naturally on the west coast are where my favorite spots for Tom Kha Kai, and another for bootie-kicking Rad Naa are.IF you ONLY want amazing food and can't handle the people factor or business of a place, ""Thai"" takeout. IF you want a place to hang and DON""T require HIGH maintenance, the food won't disappoint. I went for a spicy basil noodle- and was so content I licked the platter clean. Also tried C's Rad Naa- which was dang tasty.  My dear Thai friend in LA always reminds me, if you don't succeed, Thai Thai again. So for those that didn't like - I would suggest Thai-ing again- on a less busy night. Next trip I hope to surf on appetizers with a group.  OVERALL, food was solid, service was up to par- no complaints, and ambiance on a Tuesday- was spot on. Oh- and prices AND portions are VERY decent/generous. So I give it a 4. Sorry- no pandas seen or expressed on my visit. I'm offended by that previous remark - when it's blatant you're not pointing and shooting- and the chefs are woking each plate/order individually. BUT HEYYYY...sing a Song of sixpence with a pocketful of rye- I DID. And WILL Thai it AGAIN! (o_O)",4.0
"Having been here several times more, I can still definitely say this is my favorite Thai restaurant in NYC!  Song's specials are delish!  This evening, I had fried whole striped bass with massaman curry sauce, potatoes, carrots and peanuts.  Such a unique and flavorful dish!  And it was only $13.95, for a whole fish!!The outdoor garden seating is absolutely beautiful!  I went there during the summer and it's so nice and relaxing.You can't go wrong with any dish here at Song.  Excellent food, beautiful decor/ambience, and ridiculously low prices!",5.0

"Came here on a Thursday night around 7:30 and didn't have to wait (2 people), but the place was pretty packed. Service was quick and the waiter was very attentive and friendly. Ordered the small calamari and fried tiger shrimp rolls to start off. The calamari was HUGE in portion size, so I would assume the larger option is meant for a party of 4 or more. For two people, we couldn't finish it, but it was tasty (not over fried where you can't taste/feel the chewiness of the calamari). The fried tiger shrimp rolls came in 6 rolls, pretty good and I loved the dipping sauce it came with (used it for the calamari instead too). For the entree, I had the spicy noodles which wasn't overly spicy, but a tad on the bland side. My friend ordered the pad see yue, which I tried and absolutely LOVED (super flavorful)!! Think for a party of 2, this was too much food cause we couldn't finish our entrees either (haha!).

"This is Joya's sister restaurant on 5th Ave. What a joya indeed (sorry). I was half-expecting a hole-in-the-wall takeout counter with a grouchy and dour non-Thai server/order taker. Instead, I walked into a near-replica of Joya: hip, modern interior with a darkened dining room; small, geometric tables; and a DJ booth. The garden outside is very pleasant and surprisingly spacious.The food was strong--all four people were satisfied. My massaman curry was fresh, spicy-sweet, and delicious. The green curry was well executed, too, as was the pad thai (a fair measure of any decent Thai eatery). The mango salad was decent and I gobbled up the spicy octopus salad. The food tastes even better on the way down when you see the prices--this is one of the best dining values in New York City. The specials, averaging about double the price of an entree, hover in the very low end of any moderately priced restaurant. And, as any respectable Thai restaurateur knows, symmetrically priced wines are a great bonus.",5.0
"My husband and I thought this place was just okay. We've both had better thai good. I got the chicken pad thai and it was fresh, but not my favorite I've had.

"Several years ago I order takeout from Song and it wasn't great, wasn't awful so I put that knowledge in my back pocket and continued to search for other options in the area. This week, in the mood for Thai, I decided to give it another chance given the continual stellar reviews received. Big mistake. It might just have been the worst meal I've had in 14 years in NY. First, what is the obsession with the lemon. It was in each of the mains ordered and by the time we sat down to eat, everything had been completely overwhelmed with the lemon flavor. For the beef dish, it might have actually improved it because as best I could tell, all they did was boil some nasty beef and throw it into a container. I basically ate a bite of each for taste and chucked the rest in the garbage. Just writing this review makes me so angry. How can places get away with this and where are the others reviewing this place going? Is it some alternate universe I don't have access to or do people like beef boiled in lemon water.

"A fellow coworker convinced me that this was the ""HOT"" spot for Thai food. Well I wasted no time in trying it out so I went there today!I was looking for a sign outside that read ""Song"" and there was none!  It was a bit strange how to get inside, since there are 3 doors and it's the door on your right that opens to let you in. Looking around inside the restaurant, it had a full bar, dim lighting with candles on tables, a DJ booth and an outdoor garden with table and chairs. I placed my order and returned back in 10 minutes. I know it's not the same as eating in... but hey, it was convenient and I didn't have to go home and cook.Well for starters here's what I ordered : The Fresh Thai Summer Roll, Fried Calamari and the Shrimp Pad Thai.I can't tell you that the drive home with a shopping bag filled with Thai food was indeed making me hungry. I wanted so bad to sneak something out of the bag at the next red light.The calamari had all small ringlets (no legs) and a really nice spicy sauce served with it. The Pad Thai was nutty and really good. The Summer Roll had a mustard and sweet sauce on it. The food was indeed very fresh and yummy! Oh, I did notice at the bar these small pieces of paper in a glass and when I asked what they were for the waitress replied ""You write your drink order on it and give it to the bartender"", Ah ha...It makes sense with the DJ playing the bartender will get the order right.

"It really pays to be a regular here so that the hostess knows your face and seats you ahead of the crowd. With the 10 million thai restaurants on 5th, I think it really speaks volumes that this (equally cheap) place is still always packed. In case you're a non-believer, here's what I like:Spicy noodles. Solid every time. And the place is authentic enough to bring you one of those thai spice caddies on request.The whole fish special. Usually deep-fried in some sort of sauce over noodles. Always excellent.Calamari. Cliche, I know. But they're always crispy and the chili sauce is so good.The peanut sauce: on thai house salad, on your finger... delicious.Curry chicken puffs.

"This is Joya's sister restaurant on 5th Ave. What a joya indeed (sorry). I was half-expecting a hole-in-the-wall takeout counter with a grouchy and dour non-Thai server/order taker. Instead, I walked into a near-replica of Joya: hip, modern interior with a darkened dining room; small, geometric tables; and a DJ booth. The garden outside is very pleasant and surprisingly spacious.The food was strong--all four people were satisfied. My massaman curry was fresh, spicy-sweet, and delicious. The green curry was well executed, too, as was the pad thai (a fair measure of any decent Thai eatery). The mango salad was decent and I gobbled up the spicy octopus salad. The food tastes even better on the way down when you see the prices--this is one of the best dining values in New York City. The specials, averaging about double the price of an entree, hover in the very low end of any moderately priced restaurant. And, as any respectable Thai restaurateur knows, symmetrically priced wines are a great bonus.",5.0
"My husband and I thought this place was just okay. We've both had better thai good. I got the chicken pad thai and it was fresh, but not my favorite I've had. My main complaint is that we were in for a late lunch and the server was pretty grumpy and everything took a long time for there only being three tables occupied. The other thing that sucked was this place is cash only, since we ordered from a paper lunch special menu which didn't say it, we didn't know until we went to pay. So be advised!",3.0
"Several years ago I order takeout from Song and it wasn't great, wasn't awful so I put that knowledge in my back pocket and continued to search for other options in the area. This week, in the mood for Thai, I decided to give it another chance given the continual stellar reviews received. Big mistake. It might just have been the worst meal I've had in 14 years in NY. First, what is the obsession with the lemon. It was in each of the mains ordered and by the time we sat down to eat, everything had been completely overwhelmed with the lemon flavor. For the beef dish, it might have actually improved it because as best I could tell, all they did was boil some nasty beef and throw it into a container. I basically ate a bite of each for taste and chucked the rest in the garbage. Just writing this review makes me so angry. How can places get away with this and where are the others reviewing this place going? Is it some alternate universe I don't have access to or do people like beef boiled in lemon water. Erasing from me memory in 3.2.1....",1.0
"Superb meal for a great price! Delicious. Absolutely amazing Thai food. BUT service is not great, not even good, it's just...well...it's just ok and at times frustrating. With that being said, I'm still going. What's most important to me is the food and atmosphere. Ideal ambiance. They even have garden seating which is always a plus on Summer days.It's not pricey!!! For 2 people you will spend $50 or less. Depending on how much you eat of course. ;)",4.0
"I think this place is great for large parties. The food is inexpensive and delicious. I was there with 10ish people and the bill was minimal. The drinks, which are well made, is where they get you on the bill. Also, I waited so long for a table, I think a birthday passed. But to be fair, Im impatient. (but it was a long wait).",4.0
"Don't let the cheap prices fool you, this food is anything but cheap. Great flavors, huge portions, what more can you ask for. Even bottles of wine are cheap compared to other restaurants.Big fan of the kang massaman, fried calamari with that spicy tangy sauce and their fried rice dishes are excellent as well.Service can be a bit slow especially on busy nights but overall a must place to try, it won't disappoint.By the way, CASH ONLY",4.0
"A fellow coworker convinced me that this was the ""HOT"" spot for Thai food. Well I wasted no time in trying it out so I went there today!I was looking for a sign outside that read ""Song"" and there was none!  It was a bit strange how to get inside, since there are 3 doors and it's the door on your right that opens to let you in. Looking around inside the restaurant, it had a full bar, dim lighting with candles on tables, a DJ booth and an outdoor garden with table and chairs. I placed my order and returned back in 10 minutes. I know it's not the same as eating in... but hey, it was convenient and I didn't have to go home and cook.Well for starters here's what I ordered : The Fresh Thai Summer Roll, Fried Calamari and the Shrimp Pad Thai.I can't tell you that the drive home with a shopping bag filled with Thai food was indeed making me hungry. I wanted so bad to sneak something out of the bag at the next red light.The calamari had all small ringlets (no legs) and a really nice spicy sauce served with it. The Pad Thai was nutty and really good. The Summer Roll had a mustard and sweet sauce on it. The food was indeed very fresh and yummy! Oh, I did notice at the bar these small pieces of paper in a glass and when I asked what they were for the waitress replied ""You write your drink order on it and give it to the bartender"", Ah ha...It makes sense with the DJ playing the bartender will get the order right. The food quality, presentation was very good and the price was right! BTW, No credit cards and Cash only!Will I come back, sit down and enjoy a nice meal with a glass of wine? Well as the Terminator said....""I'LL BE BACK!""",4.0
"It really pays to be a regular here so that the hostess knows your face and seats you ahead of the crowd. With the 10 million thai restaurants on 5th, I think it really speaks volumes that this (equally cheap) place is still always packed. In case you're a non-believer, here's what I like:Spicy noodles. Solid every time. And the place is authentic enough to bring you one of those thai spice caddies on request.The whole fish special. Usually deep-fried in some sort of sauce over noodles. Always excellent.Calamari. Cliche, I know. But they're always crispy and the chili sauce is so good.The peanut sauce: on thai house salad, on your finger... delicious.Curry chicken puffs. When they are on the menu, they're the best version of this little fried appetizer. Go with your friends so you can order a table full of food and gorge yourselves for like $12 a person.",5.0

"Fantastic, cheap, filling, yummy, and size-able portions! This is a go-to place if you are ever in the mood for thai.

There was more than enough calamari to go around, I would say this is good for 4-6 people. The calamari did not taste super greasy or overly fried. The batter was light and crispy. The squid was very tender. Great taste. The dipping sauce added a nice flavor to the calamari, my only complaint is that they need more dipping sauce for that huge plate! I also ordered the spicy noodles. Wow, unless you eat obscene amounts, you can share most of the entrees with one other person. There was a lot of soft, wide rice noodles mixed in with big chunks of tofu (instead of chicken or beef). I really liked the big triangular pieces of tofu because they soaked up a lot of the sauce and spice - yummy! Great dish. I will definitely be coming back!",4.0

Really loud when the table next to  you decides shouting is the best way to communicate with each other.* Our waitress did not get our order right..two of us asked for extra spicy  and were served mild dishes (we surmised that  because it was so   loud that she really did not hear either of us ask)* The service...we had to ask for more water and our waitress really did   not seem to care if we liked our meal or not (a good wait person   knows how to at least fake caring!* The hostess needs to get off her cell phone and talk to those waiting   for a table.

"Maybe because it was so hyped up, I expected better.  It was soooo Americanized.  The som thum (papaya salad) was especially bland and all I tasted was sweet.  I'm Thai, so naturally I'm very picky with Thai food since I know how it should taste.  It really disappointed me because som thum is supposed to be extremely flavorful, so flavorful that some might find it too intense or overwhelming.  You're suppose to taste all of the flavors: sweet, salty, sour, spicy, and even faintly bitter.  The pad thai and their fried rice was ok (my friends ordered those, but we shared everything).  The spicy noodles (pad kee mao) was a bit more flavorful, but still not as good as it should be nor was it spicy.  It was also extra greasy.  Maybe it was what my friends and I ordered or maybe they were having an off day.  I might give it another shot somewhere down the road, but not anytime soon.  It really did not impress me.  I'd rather go to Mee Thai, at least their som thum was more flavorful than Song's, even if it still isn't as good as you can get in Thailand.Oh, I almost forgot.  Service was ok; it took them a while to refill our glasses.  The decor is pretty modern.  They have a bar and outdoor seating.  Regarding price, I don't know what people are talking about; it's not cheap, it's averagely priced.  It is cash only though, so come prepared or just got to an ATM machine nearby.",3.0
"Delicious! Best Thai in Park Slope. Cash only, but that shouldn't be a problem because you can easily eat under $20 a person here.

The only catch is that you may wait close to an hour for a table. Thank god for delivery.You really can't go wrong here-- everything I've tried has been really good, from the curries to the pad thai, to the flavorful gai kraprow (chicken and veggies in garlic, chili basil sauce). The fried spring rolls were crispy and the tom yum koong nice and tangy (and seriously, can you get $3 appetizers anywhere else?

"I've been to Song (their sister restaurant Joya is also great!!!) several times and it always gets an A from me!  I am a bit confused as to why it says in their description above that it's not good for kids because I take my 9 year old son with me all the time and also see children younger than him there.  So, if you've never been there before and you have children, go right ahead and bring them with you.  Now, the only way I could see it being a problem is on Friday or Saturday nights when the wait can be 30 minutes or MORE of a wait for a table - which would be VERY frustrating for kids to wait that long.  I have a pretty flexible schedule and the best times that I've known to go are Monday thru Thursday between 5 and 7 p.m.  I've also gone there for lunch and it's SUPER empty.This place serves up GREAT hot and fresh food for cheap, cheap, cheap...  I love their Chicken Satay (the peanut sauce is craziness!!!!).  They have a pineapple, egg and chicken fried rice that is OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!!  Both mine and my son's favorite.  It's not on the menu so you'll have to ask for it just as.  I get it without the vegetables because I find them to be just too overpowering in taste - but, to each is own.  Another favorite of mine is their shrimp in green coconut curry sauce.  I had this as a ""special"" one day but have ordered it even when it wasn't on the menu and they were glad to make it for me.  They will make you just about anything if you just ask!The service is ok.  Don't expect any warmth, big conversations or jokes from the servers.  They're pretty straight forward and it's clear that they're just there to do their job!  Which is fine with me...  Just bring the good food on!!!  The bar is pretty well stocked and I usual get the Mango Martini.  Yum!!!!There is a live DJ there on Friday and Saturday nights - been there once for that with my girlies - and it was right on!!!  That guy was rockin' the great jams!!  Definitely worth going at least once on the weekend.In the Summer, they have a really nice backyard - although I'm not much of a fan of eating outside during the Summer (AC is way..... TOO important to me) - I don't mind it at all there.  It nicely lit and cozy.And finally, don't get caught out there!!!!  They DON'T take credit cards - which BLOWS!  So come with that dirty cash...  Peace!",4.0
"Contrary to my stellar review of National, I don't feel quite as passionately about Song. Despite sharing the same owners, Song doesn't share the same casual, relaxed atmosphere... nor the same music taste and volume... nor the same quality of food as National!Song is loud. Now, I don't just mean loud; it's really loud. It's a little pretentious having a DJ in a restaurant that seats less than 50 people. (Scratch that; it's pretentious having a DJ in any restaurant, but that's besides the point.)I appreciate the full bar, as it's definitely a great starting point for a date, but the quality of the food at Song is unfortunately just average. The service is rather slow, and again, the overbearingly loud music makes it quite difficult to order food when neither the waiter nor patrons can hear each other.To elaborate further on the Song's averageness, the food between National and Song is quite inconsistent. For instance, the sauce for the calamari appetizer at Song is just spicy! It lacks the texture and complexity of the tangy, yet spicy sweetness that the exact same dish's sauce has at National.I'm fairly critical, but since I don't absolutely loathe the place, Song is deserving of 3 stars. It embodies ""Meh, I've experienced better"", but if the occasion for loud & raucous plus cheap & average arises (aka girls' night), it's A-OK!",3.0
"Song. It's a decent yummy meal near my job. Cash only. My favorite dish, Pad See Ew (sp?) was way too sweet. But my beef fried rice was yummy.

"After aimlessly walking around the slope for about 45 minutes, my boyfriend and I took my Mom to Song for mothers day. My mom LOVES Thai food and where she lives, everyone thinks it's so exotic and are afraid to try it so she was excited to go to Song. Not to mention, a girl going into her apartment building right next door said it's awesome and the prices are really reasonable. We waited only 15 minutes to be seated. The dining room was crowded and and noisy but it didn't take away from our meal. We ordered way too much food but all of it was delicious. We all shared the spring rolls, summer roll and Tom Kai Gai soup (delish!). My mom and I had champagne with our meals and my boyfriend got wine. I was tipsy after about 1/2 a glass and they of course made fun of me! Whoops ;). For the main course we ordered Pad Thai and my Mom and boyfriend got chicken with veggie and rice dishes. All delish. We took our time eating and the food came out in a timely fashion. We didn't feel rushed and the atmosphere boasted good conversation. I also noticed a DJ table at the front of the dining room so It's possible that at night/ on weekend they have a live DJ set while you eat or dare I say maybe some dancing?!There's also a garden out back with tables. No one was sitting out there on Mother's day because it was too chilly but I'm sure it gets crowded when the weather is a bit warmer. Overall, I'd definitely go back for drinks and dinner again.

"I've been here during lunch and dinner. The food is mediocre. The only thing I really enjoy is their chicken masaman curry. The calamari is over breaded.

There were warning signs...like the Menu which basically repeated the same dish a bazillion times swapping 2 variables to comprise new dishes: Type of Protein and Sauce.This place really speaks of the will to be wooed in superficial ways among affluent crowds.  What sautes my gibblets, is the fact that the Cheap Prices draw a youthful consortium of interested foodies...the type that roll in the Yelp Circle and should have dropped this rating below 4 stars by now.This isn't making sense to me yet.The other option is NY Thai Food scene, which I have yet to discover quality in as of yet (1 year living here).Sripraphai needs to be revisited but it didn't wow me and it's up there with the best.  I found Los Angeles to be a much better Thai City.The case is not closed on this debate, however, Song, in the words of Bono can ""Sing.....sing a new Song!""",2.0

For apps, we had the fried tofu tod (huge portion) and the summer rolls (we liked the unexpected pairing with sweet mustard).Two of us got the spicy noodles, friend got the special chicken and broccoli massaman curry over noodles, bf got the pad thai. We thought the spicy noodles were not spicy at all actually. It was a tasty dish, a bit on the salty side, but it pretty much was like a plate of Chinese chow fun. Bf's pad thai was a little too salty too.Overall: large portions at a great price, a little too salty.

"Earlier I'd put Bombay Masala as my favourite restaurant in New York... sorry, Indian food, you've got competition in the form of Thai.Song, though loud with thrum of techno and guests when crowded, is a fabulous Brooklyn find:  the minimalist decor - exposed brick, bare low-watt light bulbs, and utility-style metalwork - is reminiscent of an industrial art studio, and is a pleasant change from the kitsch the southerner in me associates with Asian restaurants: no foo dogs, no bamboo flute renditions of pop songs, and no silk flowers.  For that alone, Song, I thank you.But it gets even better.  In a neighborhood where a glorified closet can go for 2500/month, this menu is not only rife with delicious Thai fare, but it's C-H-E-A-P.  Seriously, a large calamari app (which is easily enough to pre-meal snack a table of six) and a massive entree (my personal fave is the pak kratiam, add ginger) will run you around 15 bucks.That being said, go there. Now. No, seriously, navigate from your yelp app to hopstop, head to Park Slope, and order a copious amount of phenomenal and gloriously inexpensive goodness.  Oh, and I know it goes without saying, but tip generously: the service is solid and prompt; just because the food is cheap doesn't mean you have to be!",5.0

"Decor gives off an impression that the place is ""trendy"" and ""fancy"" but the menu prices contradicts it all!

I would definitely come back if I decided to venture to the Slope instead of the Hill (Ghang Thai).

"I love this place, it has its problems but I am willing to over look a lot because they have really really delicious food. I'll be a little more specific because I went back tonight for the first time in a couple of months. The wait was long (they don't take reservations), about 10 minutes longer than what the host estimated our wait to be. When the busser brought over our water he placed it on the table by handling the mouth of the glass which is a little gross. Once we sat and ordered the waitress was fine but our food did not come out all together, there were four of us and there was about a seven minute difference between the first entrée coming out and the fourth, which of course was mine.  I had a squid dish with vegetables and a basil garlic sauce. It was probably the ""worst"" thing I've had there and I still loved it. We all shared a bit off our dishes and everything, as always, was delicious. I've come here a handful of times and have never had any complaints about the food. Consistently good food for ridiculously good prices outshines the inconsistent and sometimes downright bad service.

There were warning signs...like the Menu which basically repeated the same dish a bazillion times swapping 2 variables to comprise new dishes: Type of Protein and Sauce.This place really speaks of the will to be wooed in superficial ways among affluent crowds.  What sautes my gibblets, is the fact that the Cheap Prices draw a youthful consortium of interested foodies...the type that roll in the Yelp Circle and should have dropped this rating below 4 stars by now.This isn't making sense to me yet.The other option is NY Thai Food scene, which I have yet to discover quality in as of yet (1 year living here).Sripraphai needs to be revisited but it didn't wow me and it's up there with the best.  I found Los Angeles to be a much better Thai City.The case is not closed on this debate, however, Song, in the words of Bono can ""Sing.....sing a new Song!""",2.0
"This place never disappoints. Great food (also really cheap), huge portions, excellent drinks, friendly staff(so far) and prompt service. Sometimes there is a little wait to get a table but it's worth it. It is pretty noisy inside but when the weather is nice make sure to grab a table in their backyard where it's nice and cozy and quiet.",4.0
"This place is ok...It seemed a bit over rated to me. The decor was pretty nice, they had a what seemed to be a backyard area(love those!). Not something I would consider a location for a special occasion though. The waitresses seemed to be in their own food instead of catering to my thai-food needs. Had the urge for thai-food, yelped and found this restaurant close to my house. Id go somewhere else next time!",3.0
"After having a couple drinks with friends at Union Hall, we got hungry, so we left and wandered the streets searching for food. The wait at Al Di La Trattoria was 25 minutes, so we kept walking and came across Song. Thai it is!The restaurant was pretty busy on a late Wed night, but it didn't take too long for us to get seated. For apps, we had the fried tofu tod (huge portion) and the summer rolls (we liked the unexpected pairing with sweet mustard).Two of us got the spicy noodles, friend got the special chicken and broccoli massaman curry over noodles, bf got the pad thai. We thought the spicy noodles were not spicy at all actually. It was a tasty dish, a bit on the salty side, but it pretty much was like a plate of Chinese chow fun. Bf's pad thai was a little too salty too.Overall: large portions at a great price, a little too salty. Probably wouldn't come back again since I'm not from the area, but it probably is a good go-to spot if you live in the neighborhood and want to eat in a pinch.",3.0

"Earlier I'd put Bombay Masala as my favourite restaurant in New York... sorry, Indian food, you've got competition in the form of Thai.Song, though loud with thrum of techno and guests when crowded, is a fabulous Brooklyn find:  the minimalist decor - exposed brick, bare low-watt light bulbs, and utility-style metalwork - is reminiscent of an industrial art studio, and is a pleasant change from the kitsch the southerner in me associates with Asian restaurants: no foo dogs, no bamboo flute renditions of pop songs, and no silk flowers.  For that alone, Song, I thank you.But it gets even better.  In a neighborhood where a glorified closet can go for 2500/month, this menu is not only rife with delicious Thai fare, but it's C-H-E-A-P.  Seriously, a large calamari app (which is easily enough to pre-meal snack a table of six) and a massive entree (my personal fave is the pak kratiam, add ginger) will run you around 15 bucks.That being said, go there. Now. No, seriously, navigate from your yelp app to hopstop, head to Park Slope, and order a copious amount of phenomenal and gloriously inexpensive goodness.  Oh, and I know it goes without saying, but tip generously: the service is solid and prompt; just because the food is cheap doesn't mean you have to be!",5.0
"It's nice and inexpensive for thai. :) i love eating here. i'm not in park slope that much or this would be my daily hangout spot. the service and atmosphere is great! and the price is worth it for the big dishes, etc. i can never finish anything i get there. The menu has not disappointed me once! I try new things every time I go there, and I've never regretted it. The mango chicken is soo yummy!!",4.0
"Decor gives off an impression that the place is ""trendy"" and ""fancy"" but the menu prices contradicts it all! None of the main dishes cost more than $8 and the appetizers were in the range of $4-$5. Portions were very friendly for a big eater like me but the seasoning was a bit excessive with the salt. I would definitely come back if I decided to venture to the Slope instead of the Hill (Ghang Thai). Aside from the nice decor and low prices, this place would be great for a first date when your pockets are slim and you want to give off a good impression!Also noted by another Yelper this place is CASH ONLY so keep that in mind",3.0
"I love this place, it has its problems but I am willing to over look a lot because they have really really delicious food. I'll be a little more specific because I went back tonight for the first time in a couple of months. The wait was long (they don't take reservations), about 10 minutes longer than what the host estimated our wait to be. When the busser brought over our water he placed it on the table by handling the mouth of the glass which is a little gross. Once we sat and ordered the waitress was fine but our food did not come out all together, there were four of us and there was about a seven minute difference between the first entrée coming out and the fourth, which of course was mine.  I had a squid dish with vegetables and a basil garlic sauce. It was probably the ""worst"" thing I've had there and I still loved it. We all shared a bit off our dishes and everything, as always, was delicious. I've come here a handful of times and have never had any complaints about the food. Consistently good food for ridiculously good prices outshines the inconsistent and sometimes downright bad service. I've been back tons and I'll be back tons, just remember to bring cash.",4.0

"Went here with a few friends for my 20th birthday dinner and was blown away! The place was easy to find because we just looked for 'the blue lights' and around the door inside and outside was a large crowd. The space is comfortably small (which I LOVED) and the staff was friendly and attentive. The appetizers are large and tasty! The entrees were even better, and the ones that were curries were delicious. The favorite among the entire group was green curry which surprised everyone. It was savory and sweet and perfect. After the entree they brought out Thai iced teas (amazing!) along with sticky rice and slices of mangos in coconut milk with a little candle. Everything about this place is great - the atmosphere,the food,the service is 5 stars all around. Best birthday dinner yet!",5.0

"As someone who really dislikes carrying around cash, their cash only policy is a HUGE minus. Luckily I was able to scrounge up a few dollars and have very, very nice friends!Otherwise, I think this place is definitely worth coming into Brooklyn for! I had heard great things about the calamari, but unfortunately they were out. Instead, my table of three split the fried mushrooms (yummy, but apparently nowhere near as yummy as the calamari) and the shrimp summer rolls, which were pretty standard.For my main, I had the shrimp Pad Thai. Now, I am a very unadventurous person and eat Pad Thai pretty much every time I eat Thai, so I had plenty to compare to. It was easily one of the better ones I've had! Even though I was insanely full about a third of the way through my plate (YAY for huge portions!), it was hard to stop picking at it....Especially since our waitress never came back to give us our check. We actually had to flag down another one after 20 minutes of looking for ours. She came back just in time to pick up our money though!Overall, solid 4 stars and I look forward to eating my leftovers for my next few meals. The cash only thing seriously sucks, though.",4.0
The best thai food in Park Slope? probably. The cheapest? perhaps. It's just crazy how cheap the food is and how delicious it is. I really don't see any reason to go anywhere else for my thai fix.

Pretty amazing. Lots of food, had some amazing vegetarian options for friends, fair service. I would definitely go again, however it's always packed on the weekend with what seems like parties of eight people.

This is my favorite Thai restaurant in the Park Slope area.  It's often busy so expect to wait for a table especially if you are part of a group of 3 or more.  Seats at the bar often open up quickly so have a cocktail--they're pretty good.The green curry is the best but you can't go wrong with many of the other dishes.  The only time I was disappointed was when I had the hanger steak special.  (Why hanger steak at a Thai restaurant?  I've been here so many times so I just wanted to try something different.),4.0
"I love eating. Period. End point.I also love discovering new places. PeriodSo you can imagine, I fun hobby is to find new places to eat at.The other day I needed some food loving that you can only get from Thai cuisine. I quickly discovered ""Song"" and headed over with my older sister*.I was impressed, they looked super swanky on the inside, like I was about to have some fine dining experience; Although the lack of personality in the waitstaff and the cheap-y menu were enough to ground me.We started off with calamari and spring rolls. They were so delicious I wanted to start crying**As a main course I ordered some shrimp, broccoli, and mushrooms with rice. It was nice and subtle. While my sister had the coconut green curry about which all I can say is that it was TASTAY!Overall and amazing place to go for dinner (maybe if you have a hot date you can impress them with the swanky layout and your ability to budget).+1 Star for covering the tables with this brown paper, put a disposable surface like that in front of my sister and we WILL draw on it throughout dinner!-1 Star, THEY TAKE CASH ONLY, CASH ONLY, CASH ONLY, CASH ONLY!!!__________*The woman who taught me when I was little to use my napkin to cover my lap when I ate out, and to use that same napkin to throw over my plate if I wanted to diss the chef**I burned the roof of my mouth while eating some very hot fries, and the minor burn injury was keeping me from shoveling copious amounts of food into my mouth, which is how I normally like to do it.",4.0
"Despite the good food, the service is horrendous.   The staff is rude, arrogant, and snarky.Recently a friend and I were on a bike through prospect park and decided to stop in here for some dinner.  Unfortunately we did not have locks for our bikes.  The restaurant was nearly empty, we asked if we could park our bikes in the back and their response was ""NO""  We then asked if it would be OK to eat upfront by the bar and  again there response was ""no we don't serve food at the bar"".  As we were leaving the staff was gathered around the bar snickering at us as we left.  I had been going here for a few years but will never return.  I refuse to go to a place that treats their customers like this.  They need to realize that it is us that pays them and keeps them in business.",1.0
"delicious and inexpensive, but take some deep breaths before trying to go when it's busy, which is most of the time. Highly recommend take out or delivery. The decor is sleek, modern, and dark--and it is very loud, even when they're not pumping the music. They run a very efficient operation: food comes out quickly, tastes fresh, and they always get my order right when I do take out. I love that you can see the kitchen through the window from the street. I tend to return to the noodle dishes here, but i've probably tried 90% of the menu, not including specials. All very good. The Pad See Ew has a great smoky flavor, and the noodles are never soggy. Various curries are also delicious and reasonably spicy. Can't beat the price/quality ratio, and as everyone says, remember that it's cash only...",5.0

Best Thai food in the neighborhood. The delivery is hit or miss but always worth the trouble. Anything off the specials menu is never a disappointment.

"Simple and delicious Thai food. We ordered a variety of dishes but my favorites were the green papaya salad and pad thai.The patio is adorable but was full so we had to eat inside the restaurant. The place was pack and the music was loud which helped me enjoy my dining experience. This is definitely a hot spot and would go back next time I am in town.

"This place is pretty basic, in terms of thai food. You really do get what you pay for, and this place is pretty cheap. There's almost always a wait for some reason, which is a bummer, but this is Brooklyn, I guess. In any case, I usually order the same thing when I come here (tofu and green beans) but this time I got the crispy bass, whole fish special. It was horrible. Fish smelled off, and there was no meat on the bones - totally overcooked and inedible. Skirt steak special, however, was outstanding. I don't need this much excitement in my life.

"If Song charged double for their entrees you wouldn't eat here but since Spicy Noodles cost about  the same as 8 iTune downloads and you get to sit at a table as opposed to carry out in styrofoam, you'll eat here happily if that's what you want. The quality isn't outstanding but it's not horrible either. It's ""adequate"". You won't get sick but the meal won't be memorable either. It's kind of like cooking pasta at your house really quick and then throwing cold sauce on it because you are in a rush to do something and you're starving. Enjoy the DJ.

The portion sizes were very good and it was quite cheap. For 4 dishes we paid $28+delivery. The food was flavorful, spicy and good. It took about 40 minutes to deliver which i thought was long, considering that we live so close to their restaurant. But I have no reason to complain.

"This place was once my favorite Thai spot basically because I didn't know any better. Now that I've tried tons of Thai places, I know that this place is usually wall to wall people simply because it's considered a ""cool"" atmosphere, it's cheap, and people don't know any better. I find the atmosphere to basically be annoying and loud. They have a dj at night usually and it is loud and not conducive to having a good convo with friends. The seating is tight, and you are right on top of the next couple in a lot of seats, and the tables are pretty small. The Pad Thai is amazingly greasy and they seem to use lower quality food in most of their dishes. They are cheaply priced which is nice, but you get what you pay for. The service is extremely fast, to the point that I've gotten the check dropped without asking if I want dessert or another drink on more than one occasion. The sister restaurant Joya on Court St is slightly better, but not by much. The nail in the coffin for me with this place was one night I walked by to see a pile of garbage bags and loose garbage on the kitchen floor when the restaurant was closed. The garbage was clearly visible and was a real turn off.

Now that I've tried tons of Thai places, I know that this place is usually wall to wall people simply because it's considered a ""cool"" atmosphere, it's cheap, and people don't know any better. I find the atmosphere to basically be annoying and loud. They have a dj at night usually and it is loud and not conducive to having a good convo with friends. The seating is tight, and you are right on top of the next couple in a lot of seats, and the tables are pretty small. The Pad Thai is amazingly greasy and they seem to use lower quality food in most of their dishes. They are cheaply priced which is nice, but you get what you pay for. The service is extremely fast, to the point that I've gotten the check dropped without asking if I want dessert or another drink on more than one occasion. The sister restaurant Joya on Court St is slightly better, but not by much. The nail in the coffin for me with this place was one night I walked by to see a pile of garbage bags and loose garbage on the kitchen floor when the restaurant was closed. The garbage was clearly visible and was a real turn off. I really don't know how they got an A rating if this is how they clean their place.Be prepared to wait really long, especially if you come on a weekend, and experience mediocre Thai food at best.",1.0
"food isnt bad. realllly cheap! two entrees and two beers. 27$ altogether. heeeyyyservice isnt the best though. the waiter just pointed at a table while walking away meaning 'sit here.' and then forgot our beers. we waited until after the food came. but i guess overall, its an alright place",3.0
"I came here with a date because she's from brooklyn and I'm from manhattan so I kept it comfty for her. I actually picked this place because of yelp. Good choice.The vibe was cool, grown and sexy, the tables were spread out enough where you're not having a conversation with the other tables. Simple but classy decor.The service was the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. My waiter wasn't rude but he definitely wasn't personable. I told my friends about the service and they said that you don't go to thai restaurants for good service. I beg to differ. I'm always expecting good service. That's why I tip well. For good service. I'm an appreciative person, what can I say.The food was awesome. Quality and Quantity. We had simple plates but the patsee ooie, I'm sure I said that wrong was delicious. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this place. If I'm ever around Park Slope, I'll definitely be back.",4.0
"This is one of my fav Thai spots to eat, but honestly this ""cash only"" seems like tax evation and a huge inconvenience. I once forgot this place was cash only; I barely had money to pay the bill but luckily my friend had a few bucks on her. I was not surprised at all when the waiter that did not have good service anyway chased us outside to tell us off about not tipping. I explained to him that I didn't remember it was cash only and I only had a card. He went on and on about how he doesnt like people of my kind- I am assuming he meant ""black"" but who cares it was ignorant. For all he knew I was going to my car to drive to the bank and return. The next two weeks I returned and complained to the manager; he explained to me that the waiter was a visiting from the ""joy"" location. The manager went on to say that I should have tipped even thought I explained the situation to him; his advice was that I should have went to an atm down the street. Cesar was my fav bartender there. I have sinced slowed down on my visits to this location. I like the food but customer service goes a long way with me.",3.0

"I think Song is best summed up with the phrase ""huge portions with a small price.""  I ordered a panang curry and the generous serving of rice wasn't enough to sop up all the goodness in the bowl of panang curry.  Maybe I've been in Manhattan too long, but the fact that the curry was under $10 and they gave you a lot of rice makes the inner fat kid happy.  If I keep coming to dinner here, the inner fat kid might become me.  Also, do yourself a favor and order the ribs.  I'm not sure what is in the sauce, but the combination of the sweet sauce and the crispy rib, are heaven.  Drafts of Brooklyn Lager were only $5Better get to the gym if I want to keep eating here",5.0
"I've eaten here a few times, I actually like this place a lot despite the fact that I'm not much of a fan of loud atmospheres, but today sucked! I went after work super excited on chowing down on some good eats, it was only 3 of us, we were starved the appetizers came pretty quick but our meal took over 20 min, and those who came after us were served before we were. It's not like we ordered meals that took hours to cook and the waitress was rude ugh! I tend to not to there during the evening hours because it gets so packed and it takes a while to get a table..

"Soooo I spent a week in Thailand last year, tried different dishes on my first day, and either they were too spicy or way too different for my tastes.  I spent the rest of the week eating pad thai at every meal.  And no, I'm not some close-minded American who has to eat a hamburger abroad. Anyway, my point is that it's very difficult for me to find something I like on a Thai menu (besides pad thai, bien sur). But at Song, nothing is a gamble, as everything is delicious. The portions are generous too, and everything is affordable. Two things I don't like about this place is the wait (I've had to wait over an hour at times) and the music. It's WAY TOO LOUD in here...almost club-like, which I'm not a fan of for dinner. Otherwise, overall great food.",5.0

My fiance got pad thai and although the dish was huge, he mentioned the taste was just ok and the egg was in huge long chunks, which he hated.  The spring rolls where very oily and again, not flavorful.I also have to mention that their menu doesn't have the usual currys, and they only take cash.",2.0

"Oh song, I wanted to like you. We moved here about a year ago from a place that had great Thai food. We asked around, looked on Yelp and everyone said Song was the way to go. Well, we've given it three tries and I'm sorry to say- it's just not good. In my opinion Song is for sure not as good as all the glowing reviews it receives.  In the times that we've eaten there we've tried the Tiger Shrimp rolls which were okay. The Laad Nah soup with beef which has little flavor and was actually kinda gross. The Calamari which lite but bland. The Chicken Fried rice which again was okay but nothing special. The Pad Thai which i gave two separate tries, and both times had nice noodles, but very bland under cooked tofu. I can go on, but you get my point. As of now we're still on the hunt for a good Thai place in Brooklyn, if you know of any let us know because Song isn't it.",1.0
"In this age of plastic, I was kind of annoyed the first time I went with a few friends and had no cash on me. Fortunately big sis was gracious enough to spot me and so we split an order of Spicy Noodles. I was fairly hungry and wasn't expecting to be satisfied by half an order of noodles and was already planning to grab a slice of pizza after we left the restaurant. Much to my surprise, when our order came we were greeted by a large plate piled high with noodles. And what's more is that these noodles were delicious. The wide, rice noodles are pan fried and so the edges have a light crust which provide great texture. Though the chicken that comes with it is nothing special. It seems like frozen chicken breast from Costco that's chopped up and mixed in. But I believe it's the same price with or without. All in all a great dish and one I highly recommend. I ended up not getting a slice of pizza afterward and was quite full. I've also tried a few of the curries which also come in large servings. In fact, unless you like your rice drowned with curry it might serve you well to order an extra bowl of rice. Great clean flavors though and plenty of heat (cooked to taste) to satisfy spice lovers. The decor of the place is great. Very modern styling cues with some cool light fixtures littered around and fairly ordinary seating. I've only been during dinner time and the restaurant is pretty dimly lit so I guess everything may have looked a little better than it really was (A phenomenon club patrons are pretty familiar with). It is a very relaxing environment though despite being a little cramped. I've gone to Song three times and two of those times they had a live DJ playing some cool jazzy, funky beats. It adds nicely to the feel of the place without coming across as too hipster. The best part about Song though is the prices are CHEAP. With almost everything on the menu at $7 and portions that can feed two and taste great, coupled with a live DJ and service that isn't terrible, Song earns an A+ in my book. Definitely check this place out if you're in Park Slope.",5.0

"I have lived in the Park Slope area for a little over 2 years. Every time a friend or family member comes to visit I take them to Song. The atmosphere is perfect! There is a fantastic outdoor seating area that is great for the Spring and Summer. The food is the BEST Thai I have had in my life. The coconut soup and pad-thai are my favorite. The prices are beyond reasonable (pad-thai $6.95). You do have to pay in cash.The only problem is that it is small and doesn't take reservations. Be prepared for a 5-20 min. wait during peak dinner hours. The hostess is also short and a little rude, but I laugh it off as part of the adventure. Take her with a grain of salt; it is worth it when you bite into a chicken curry puff appetizer!!",5.0
"I had the spicy noodles with chicken. They were not very spicy, and the noodles were overcooked and thus gluey. (I prefer the version at Nahm Thai down the street.) BUT, the flavors were nice, and the price was right! They also have cheap beer, although bottled and a pretty lame selection.As others have pointed out, though, the decor is pretty swank. The service was fine. This is basically a divey thai place trapped in a swank restaurant's body.Will I be here again? Probably not. Again the price can't be beat, but since the neighborhood has so many Thai places to choose from, I want to give another one a shot.",3.0
"Thai food is not the first kind of food I think of when I want to go out to dinner in Park Slope, but after eating at Song, it's one of the top 5 places I enjoy going to in The Slope.

It has the perfect balance of not killer spicy, but just enough that it brings a tear to my eye. The food is always fresh and the ambiance is comfortable and modern. The waitress's can pay more attention to detail at times. Last time I was there, I was not brought the Thai ice tea I ordered and I couldn't seem to find my waitress to remind her.

"What happened to the Song I remember? When Song opened, they had amazing food, larger than needed portions (I heart leftovers), and good wait staff. I've kept coming back since I live nearby, and it seems that over the last year, they have slowly gotten less and less impressive. They are usually hit or miss, but I took my mother who was visiting, hoping for a 'hit'.First off, our waiter looked and acted like he either, a) was transititioning into becoming a full-time zombie waiterb) had been awake for 3 days c) didn't careWe tried repeatedly to get his attention, but whenever he would look our way he would only look at our plates, not noticing me turned around, directly facing him, while trying to make eye contact.

Song, please, go back to whatever you were doing before, because at this rate I don't think I'll return. Not to brag or anything, but I make better Thai than you do at this point.

"I went to Song during dinnertime on a weekend. It was pretty packed but we were seated right away because there were only 2 of us. There wasn't as much of a variety of vegetarian dishes here as there have been at other Thai places I've been, but I did spot a few things that looked good. I ordered the Fresh Summer Rolls (with no shrimp) and Tofu Pad See Yue.Our waitress was friendly and paid attention to my dietary concerns, for example, when I ordered the rolls without shrimp, she made sure to ask if I was ok with egg in my main dish. I appreciated that attention to detail.The rolls were great: tasty and full of fresh, crispy veggies. The Pad See Yue was ok, but could have used a little spice... it was bland.I'm not sure whether it was because of a large group in the dining room that night, but it was very loud just with people trying to talk over each other. At one point, a DJ started playing music but she didn't try to overpower the volume of conversation.I'd go back, but not before trying a few more Thai places in the neighborhood.",3.0

When it got here it was cold and the Pad Thai was one single mass of overcooked broken up noodles that had clearly been sitting congealing for at least a half hour or more. Soggy spring rolls too.

"I have lived in the Park Slope area for a little over 2 years. Every time a friend or family member comes to visit I take them to Song. The atmosphere is perfect! There is a fantastic outdoor seating area that is great for the Spring and Summer. The food is the BEST Thai I have had in my life. The coconut soup and pad-thai are my favorite. The prices are beyond reasonable (pad-thai $6.95). You do have to pay in cash.The only problem is that it is small and doesn't take reservations. Be prepared for a 5-20 min. wait during peak dinner hours. The hostess is also short and a little rude, but I laugh it off as part of the adventure. Take her with a grain of salt; it is worth it when you bite into a chicken curry puff appetizer!!",5.0
"I had the spicy noodles with chicken. They were not very spicy, and the noodles were overcooked and thus gluey. (I prefer the version at Nahm Thai down the street.) BUT, the flavors were nice, and the price was right! They also have cheap beer, although bottled and a pretty lame selection.As others have pointed out, though, the decor is pretty swank. The service was fine. This is basically a divey thai place trapped in a swank restaurant's body.Will I be here again? Probably not. Again the price can't be beat, but since the neighborhood has so many Thai places to choose from, I want to give another one a shot.",3.0
"Thai food is not the first kind of food I think of when I want to go out to dinner in Park Slope, but after eating at Song, it's one of the top 5 places I enjoy going to in The Slope. The spicy noodles were referred to me by wife who frequents the establishment for years now, and I was totally impressed. It has the perfect balance of not killer spicy, but just enough that it brings a tear to my eye. The food is always fresh and the ambiance is comfortable and modern. The waitress's can pay more attention to detail at times. Last time I was there, I was not brought the Thai ice tea I ordered and I couldn't seem to find my waitress to remind her. By the time we did see her, we were done with our meal. It doesn't take away from the quality of the food and I highly recommend this restaurant!",4.0

There portions of calamari are massive, delicious and won't break the bank. I am far less adventurous in trying new foods than I would care to admit, so both times I've had the Pad Thai. The first time it was a dream, very flavorful and rich. The second time I also had the pad thai and it was very disappointing; perhaps they had a different cook but my meal seemed sloppily prepared, with ingredients added that aren't in a traditional P.T.

Their curries are huge, delicious, and actually SPICY!! I have sweat buckets while consuming the green curry, so I generally go for the red, which is just spicy enough. Amazing. The broad noodles are freshly made and delicious. Not to forget the incredibly reasonable prices, and the patio is fantastically romantic in the summer time.

"Song offers very tasty and reasonably priced thai served in a massive space, including a modernistic bar in the front and a spacious outdoor patio.  The wines by the glass are a great deal (house wine $5), as are all the generously portioned appetizers and entrees, among which my favorites are the vegetable dumplings they only have as a special, the pad see aw, and the garlic chicken.  The sauces are well flavored and the vegetables fresh.  Although it is always crowded here, I've never had to wait for a table.",4.0

"My ""go-to"" spot for late night dinner.  The place closes at 11:30 so not really late night.  But in Parkslope, it's a great source for cheap Thai in a funky trendy environment.  The typical glass of wine will average $5-$6 and beer starts at $4.  Appetizers start at $3 and you can fill up eating multiple dishes of appetizers.  I have been drawn to this restaurant for their special ""Steamed Mussels in Lemongrass broth"" - $8!!! so my hypeman and I usually stop here for a late night dinner on our way to clubbing in NYC.  There's  Deejay spinning cool music (A bit loud to some) in the middle of the dining area.  If you get there around 8 on Fridays and Saturdays - expect to wait at least forty-five minutes for a table.  But once you're seated, your order will be taken and the food will arrive real quick.  You can see the food prepared in the open kitchen. Portions are very generous.  Amazing quality for fast service and plentiful food.  Dinner for two with two appetizers and a drink each will run and average of $45! You can't get better than that in Parkslope.Parking is not pleasant - I advise.",4.0
"This used to be my favorite go-to spot, but the last year I've had so many negative service experiences that I flat out refused to go back. Also, there is a weird odor when you walk by which sometimes smells like sewer. I was not surprised to see a big old B slapped onto the front of their storefront (it's near the bottom, hidden). This solidified my very negative impression of this place. It used to be so good. So sad.",1.0

"Definitely one of the better deals in town. Like others have said, good portions and small price. The food is decent, too! My squid pad Thai was pretty mild, but if you ask for spices, they'll bring a little tray-thing of four kinds of chili sauce, and they're all pretty yummy. The squid was kind of rubbery, though. Overall, pretty good dinner for $20 a person including tip (no booze). I didn't even know that was still possible at a sit-down place anymore!A bit loud.

"Where I come from, New York is fabled to be the most expensive city on earth. I ate at Song and saw the prices and was like WTF? I can't get Thai food this cheap in Fresno! I figured there had to be a catch when we ordered a bunch of apps (spring rolls, fried shrimp, papaya salad, satay) for under $5 each. I assumed the spring rolls would be 2 micro mini centimeters of food, but nope - we received a perfectly normal sized order of spring rolls. The fancy fruity cocktails were not cheap but they were normal for what a chichi cocktail should cost ($8-12 a drink).The ambiance was stellar - gritty, industrial look with waterfalls and Lotus flowers to balance the rawness with tranquility. Not sure how I felt about the loud trance music but I guess some people like that. My friend told me an episode of Sex and the City was filmed here and I don't doubt it. The aura was cool. It was obvious that there is no secret in Brooklyn about how cheap this restaurant is because they were SLAMMED. We ate at the bar and I will admit that it was kind of strange that we couldn't eat food at the front bar...don't really understand why but whatever...we sauntered to the back bar and that was fine.",4.0

"Probably 2 and a half stars. I liked the back patio; it was very pleasant. The food was kind of ok. Good big-sized portions, the entrees (tofu and beef) were very salty/sweet - tasty, but without much subtlety to the flavor. I liked the mango salad but the cilantro on top was yellow and spoiled. We ordered the sirloin tip special as an appetizer but the waitress brought us Thai pork ribs instead. I didn't realize the mistake until it was too late to send them back.

"This is more a 3.5* review but I'm in a good mood.The food is good, fresh and cheap. The wine was great as well. The service as (a little too) efficient.We arrived around 7:30, right before the rush, so we didn't have to wait. Because we were with foreigner, it took us more time to decide what food to order and what to drink. The waitress came back 3 times and was polite about it.I can't complain about the food. What I ordered was great. The wine was hard to choose but we went for an Italian one that was $22 (a bottle) and our guests were not disappointed with it. Too bad that the waitress served the whole bottle in 1 shot and took it away. They would have liked checking the label to see where it came from (-0.5*) as the busboys took our wine glasses as soon as they were empty...What bugged us the most is the level of noise in the restaurant. The walls are either brick walls or painted concrete so conversation noise kind of reverberate on them and the only way they found to solve this issue is to crank the music up... Thus making the crowd, talk louder... Forcing them to turn the music louder, Etc... Until we could just not hear the person across the table.However I really appreciated that despite the efficient service, they did not make us feel rushed and brought the check after I asked them for it, instead of when they decided we should leave.And the check was more than reasonable for a 4 people meal with wine.",4.0

"We just went to Song for a good friend's 20th birthday. Firstly, since there was a member of our party who is in a wheelchair, my friend call ahead of time to make sure they were accessible. They said they were, but I think that a pretty high step to get into the restaurant does not qualify as accessible. In addition, we had reservations for 8PM and were not seated until 8:20, and were forced to stand in the very cramped waiting area. We were told we had a choice: wait for a neighboring table to leave as to give us more space, or cramp in. Since we were starving, we decided to cramp in. A few minutes later, the other people did leave, and the waitstaff pushed a small, awkward table next to ours, which I don't think helped matters.The food was OK; I've had better thai, but I've had worse. I really enjoyed the fried calamari (a staple for any thai establishment) and the steamed mussels. My entree of jumbo shrimp and avocado in a basil sauce was nothing to write home about. We did not stick around for their skimpy dessert offering (fried banana and ice cream).This was really a 2.5 star review, but I felt like being generous.",3.0

"With the only problems being that the place is a bit loud if you want to come on a Sunday to eat (although I guess I wouldn't normally do chic Thai on a Sunday), the food here is definitely bargain price (nearly everything is under 10, and most are under 8 it seems). Their sauces really seem to do well under the enormous heat generated in that semi-open kitchen (we got seats right by there and it was enlivening, a constant fire coming from about 6 woks in a row). I've used three parentheses already, so I'll try not to for the rest of the review (...ok ok). Their sauces are very good, and it turns the pad see ew from normal to something I'd eat every time I come here. The noodles are nice and soft and while the beef is fairly good, I do love chinese broccoli when it's super tender. The place itself is kinda sleek, with a small bar in the front with the actual bar lit up and all blue and purple. Once you hit the tables, it's an open forum with horrendous acoustics (this place is loud, even without the blaring music). The backyard is really a treat, I wish it wasn't raining so we could have sat outside.I'll be grabbing the menu from Joya very soon, I'd definitely consider this a must on my take out.",4.0

Outstanding food (and it's just as good the next day), really nice decor - I dig the periwinkle and dark wood vibe.  Also looks like there's a spot for some uber-awesome Thai DJing, too.  The soup was so filling I barely had room for any of my entree, so if you're just looking for a snack or are perhaps a rexie, try it!",5.0

Great vegetarian dishes! The vegetables are always cooked perfectly. The sauces get a bit salty if you soak all of your rice in it but are still very flavorful. The only negative is that the curry puffs aren't on the regular menu! Best curry puffs I've had but they only have them once in a while. Should definitely be a permanent appetizer!,4.0

"I eat Thai food a LOT (esp pad thai) and I'm not that picky, so it's not that hard for me to be happy with Thai.  With most restaurants, I start at zero and add up the stars; with Thai I tend to start at 5 and subtract as necessary.  So really, I was really inclined to crown Song with top accolades, what with its simple-chic decor, low low prices (even for Thai), enormous portions, and convenient location.  Alas -- I knock off a star for the exceedingly loud volume and the food.Song is not actually as trendy as people make it sound.  No one one here boasts a snobby attitude and it's not a beautiful-people-only spot.  It's easy on the eyes, but Song has a casual vibe that just happens to be set in a mod dining room.  Yes, there's a DJ booth, but on neither of my two Friday night visits was the music blaringly LOUD.  My boyfriend and I actually stopped to note the fact that the music was not pumping bc we couldn't figure out why the heck else the noise level was so high at Song!  Sitting just across the small table from each other, we had to lean across and scream to be heard!  (Of course, that's probably the problem other diners had too, contributing to the problem.)  Come warm weather, I'd like to try the backyard patio, which should be quieter!Anyway, I had the chicken + shrimp pad thai (which I had last time and when I ordered in, too) and my bf had the garlic sliced beef.  I actually like my pad thai on the sweet side, but the pad thai at Song was a bit too sugary even for me.  Similarly, my bf's garlic beef was too salty w/o eating a bite of rice at the same time.  The spring rolls, however, were pretty damn good, even though they only give you 2 (compared to other Thai restaurants).  But the fact that the entree portions are so big ROCKS, and I can't really complain too much about pad thai at dinnertime costing only $6.95.Whew, that was long!  Usually my 4-star reviews are short and full of praise, so I feel bad.  Song is actually pretty great and I'll def keep coming back for more, but those are 2 things I wish they'd fix!",4.0

Great vegetarian dishes! The vegetables are always cooked perfectly. The sauces get a bit salty if you soak all of your rice in it but are still very flavorful. The only negative is that the curry puffs aren't on the regular menu! Best curry puffs I've had but they only have them once in a while. Should definitely be a permanent appetizer!,4.0

My boyfriend ordered the coconut green curry with vegetables which he says was ""awesome, fantastic in his opinion"". I tried it and it was very good.The service was very slow.

"I was in Park Slope for a rehearsal today and some band mates and I decided to go have lunch afterwards. We were pointed to this restaurant by the one person in the band who lives in the area, and since we all love Thai food we gave it a try. At 3pm on a Friday, it was relatively empty with only one or two other tables full. We were seated right away in the sleek, minimalistic atmosphere, and I noticed the great patio in the back with very cute ,colorful, printed pillows. It was a little too hot to sit out there, but on a cooler day it looked pretty awesome.The menu was fairly typical Thai fair. The lunch entrees were all under $10, incredibly fair for a meal that was really above average.The service was casual, friendly and fast. The kitchen is open, allowing for a view of the chefs and the flames as they made our meals.We got a calamari appetizer for the table, which was lightly tempura battered and fried. Not at all greasy, and with a sweet and sour mango dipping sauce that went over very well. So well, in fact, that after we polished off the calamari and made it down to the bed of romaine that it sat on, we continued using the lettuce to dip until the sauce bowl was clean.I had a Tom Yum Koong soup and a small salad with tofu and peanut sauce and everything was excellent. The soup had the perfect combo of tangy and spicy, and the shrimp and cilantro were fresh and flavorful. The salad was crisp and cold, with a few strips of fried tofu on top. The peanut sauce was an especially good one and I kind of wished I had ordered a bigger salad so I could keep using it.If I'm in the area again craving Thai, I will definitely go back. Check it out!",4.0
LOVE me some Song!  I always get the fried chicken spring rolls and Pad Thai.  Its the best Thai food I have had since my other favorite Thai food in West Seattle.  Its really cheap and realllly good for the price.  Only downfall is waiting in line and no credit cards.  Otherwise..a great restaurant!,5.0
"My first reaction walking into this place:WOW!and it just seemed to continue the longer I was there.  The place looks beautiful.  It's decorated so savvy I was wondering if I was going to be able to afford my meal.Then came my next wow... the prices.  CHEAP!  For a place that looks so crazy nice you can eat for under $10.Ok so the place looks nice and it's cheap.  How's the food?  To die for.  The best Thai I've had anywhere.  My friends and I all got different things and passed them around the table as we went and I wasn't disappointed in any of them.  I got one of the curries (can't remember which one) it was spicy, so watch out if you can't handle your heat.  Another great dish was the spicy noodles with shrimp. YUM!My only advice is make reservations if they take them.  It's a popular place (obviously), so if you don't want to wait around forever I'd be sure to at least try to call ahead.",5.0

At 3pm on a Friday, it was relatively empty with only one or two other tables full. We were seated right away in the sleek, minimalistic atmosphere, and I noticed the great patio in the back with very cute ,colorful, printed pillows. It was a little too hot to sit out there, but on a cooler day it looked pretty awesome.The menu was fairly typical Thai fair. The lunch entrees were all under $10, incredibly fair for a meal that was really above average.The service was casual, friendly and fast. The kitchen is open, allowing for a view of the chefs and the flames as they made our meals.We got a calamari appetizer for the table, which was lightly tempura battered and fried. Not at all greasy, and with a sweet and sour mango dipping sauce that went over very well. So well, in fact, that after we polished off the calamari and made it down to the bed of romaine that it sat on, we continued using the lettuce to dip until the sauce bowl was clean.I had a Tom Yum Koong soup and a small salad with tofu and peanut sauce and everything was excellent. The soup had the perfect combo of tangy and spicy, and the shrimp and cilantro were fresh and flavorful. The salad was crisp and cold, with a few strips of fried tofu on top. The peanut sauce was an especially good one and I kind of wished I had ordered a bigger salad so I could keep using it.If I'm in the area again craving Thai, I will definitely go back. Check it out!",4.0
LOVE me some Song!  I always get the fried chicken spring rolls and Pad Thai.  Its the best Thai food I have had since my other favorite Thai food in West Seattle.  Its really cheap and realllly good for the price.  Only downfall is waiting in line and no credit cards.  Otherwise..a great restaurant!,5.0
"My first reaction walking into this place:WOW!and it just seemed to continue the longer I was there.  The place looks beautiful.  It's decorated so savvy I was wondering if I was going to be able to afford my meal.Then came my next wow... the prices.  CHEAP!  For a place that looks so crazy nice you can eat for under $10.Ok so the place looks nice and it's cheap.  How's the food?  To die for.  The best Thai I've had anywhere.  My friends and I all got different things and passed them around the table as we went and I wasn't disappointed in any of them.  I got one of the curries (can't remember which one) it was spicy, so watch out if you can't handle your heat.  Another great dish was the spicy noodles with shrimp. YUM!My only advice is make reservations if they take them.  It's a popular place (obviously), so if you don't want to wait around forever I'd be sure to at least try to call ahead.",5.0
"Quite a wait, but at least you can grab a drink or two while your table's freed up. I decided on the Koong Kratiam and at $7.50 it was a fantastic deal... the sauce was perfect, the shrimp was a generous portion and very tasty.. The pricing is really good by NYC standards- No complaints, at all. I suggest you seek Song out, it'll have you singing.",4.0
"The sister restaurant of joya, offers pretty much the same menu and decor. Literally has the best pad Thai ever. I also recommend the veg rolls and mojito. Super cheap but effing delicious.",5.0
"I know Thai food is always cheap, but usually it's because they're hole-in-the-walls with folding chairs or 30-year-old diner booths.  Song, on the other hand, is a modern, trendy Park Slope restaurant, with great prices.  It's easy to eat for about $10 and eat a lot of great food.We ordered the mussels (which was a large amount for an appetizer), pad thai, green curry, BBQ chicken with mango-papaya salad.  All were great.",5.0

"I'm on a mission to find really great pad thai in the city. I love Song because it's fresh, it always comes out steaming hot, and it's pretty damn good. Not a fan of the bean curd in the pad thai, though I know that it's a popular option. I also love the fact that it doesn't come out all red, because I also know some people like doing that. Speaking specifically about the pad thai and pad see ew, they were just a tad too salty the last time we went, but still delicious. Pad See Ew had a great smokey flavor. Service was prompt, it was a bit too smoky, but it was a nice and trendy environment. Plus, the food is really affordable. Best thai place that I've found so far, but I'm still lookin.

"This is the only Thai place I ever want to go to, ever! except for maybe it's sister restaurant Joya. From the fried calamari, spring rolls, to the flat noodle dishes, everything is a delight. It's fresh and comes steaming hot out of the kitchen. The vibe is cool and sexy, with a live DJ some nights. They haven't changed their prices, unlike some neighboring establishments, in years and I think they're gonna stay true to that bc that's who they have set themselves out to be. Entrees are less than $10 and the portions are humongous. I love knowing that when I leave, I'll be having them again the next day for free. My fav aspect though, is the 4 types of chili condiment that you can ask for to go with your food. I have never seen that anywhere else, and for chili connoisseurs like myself, it's F'N hot.",5.0

"Really excellent and fresh, and almost suspiciously cheap. I have ordered from here many times over the years, but have never eaten in the restaurant (I have kids and an aversion to pumping techno music while I eat.) The fried calamari is a favorite: it comes w/ a delicious sweet chili dipping sauce and several times has showed up w/ the styrofoam container slightly melted from the heat of the calamari. Clearly they slide the fried bits into the container directly from the fryer. Worrisome, perhaps, re: toxicity of melted styrofoam? but: Yum. They even cut a little hole in the container to vent out the steam and keep stuff crispy. Thoughtful! I usually order the kang gai (chicken and veggies in red coconut curry) which comes w/ enough to save half for dinner the next night. DAMN it's good. They use slices of white meat, not the rich dark meat they used at our dearly departed Long Tan, but it's still good, and the veggies are flavorful. If you want something lighter and healthier the mango gai yang is the way to go: a quarter of a chicken, nicely spiced and grilled, with sticky rice and a lovely fresh, sweet mango salad sprinkled w/ peanuts.  The only problem: when you call to order you have about a 1 in 4 chance of actually getting through. There seems to be only one line into the place. Usually you hit a busy signal and have to call back again. And again. I have had to give up and order from someplace else many a time.

"Really excellent and fresh, and almost suspiciously cheap. I have ordered from here many times over the years, but have never eaten in the restaurant (I have kids and an aversion to pumping techno music while I eat.) The fried calamari is a favorite: it comes w/ a delicious sweet chili dipping sauce and several times has showed up w/ the styrofoam container slightly melted from the heat of the calamari. Clearly they slide the fried bits into the container directly from the fryer. Worrisome, perhaps, re: toxicity of melted styrofoam? but: Yum. They even cut a little hole in the container to vent out the steam and keep stuff crispy. Thoughtful! I usually order the kang gai (chicken and veggies in red coconut curry) which comes w/ enough to save half for dinner the next night. DAMN it's good. They use slices of white meat, not the rich dark meat they used at our dearly departed Long Tan, but it's still good, and the veggies are flavorful. If you want something lighter and healthier the mango gai yang is the way to go: a quarter of a chicken, nicely spiced and grilled, with sticky rice and a lovely fresh, sweet mango salad sprinkled w/ peanuts.  The only problem: when you call to order you have about a 1 in 4 chance of actually getting through. There seems to be only one line into the place. Usually you hit a busy signal and have to call back again. And again. I have had to give up and order from someplace else many a time.

"Alright, Alright,  ALRIGHT!! Back at it again reviewing my A$$ off. Anyways, a friend was in town a couple weekends ago and I wanted to take her to some place that I knew she would enjoy, instantly I thought about Song because I just love Thai food and she does too. Walked in, asked how long was the wait... 40 min... 40 MIN on a week night? Como'n man! So we left with the sad faces and walked around for a little bit. We eventually decided to go back to Song and see if anything has changed with the wait time. My friend just waltz in there and got us a table immediately.... I guess she's a better new Yorker than I am. Anyway, I ordered the chicken in yellow curry sauce thing and she ordered a spicy rice and chicken dish. Both were good! She also go the Thai tea that I have never had before, kinda tasted like watered down carrot juice, but it was good. When dessert time came, we found out they only had two desserts so I ordered the fried  banana with coconut ice cream and she ordered the mango dish, I liked mines better! Lol Overall the experience was good and I would do it again if I was in the mood for Thai, But im still on the hunt to find a spot that I can dub my favorite!",3.0
"A friend took me here last year around this same time in December. It was on a Saturday evening and it was snowing. Regardless of that, there was a long line of people waiting to be seated. Which is a good sign. I waited in line for about 20 mins. The place is pretty small but has a nice ambiance. The bathroom is a single bathroom which I love, and it was nice and clean. You can also see the chefs cooking in a somewhat open area. It's a small cozy place. I don't know how authentic this Thai food is, but it was good. My friend suggested we order the calamari as an appetizer. I was a little apprehensive because I have never tasted calamari before. But I liked it a lot and the sauce that came with it was great. I am actually craving that now and need to go back there as soon as I can. After that I ordered garlic chicken and rice which was good. But the next time I go I need to try something more adventurous. I also ordered a Thai iced tea which was good when I was drinking it by itself, but mixed with the garlic chicken not so much. The waitstaff were definitely on their toes, very attentive with refilling glasses of water and clearing the tables. But one thing I didn't like was they didn't ask if we were done or not they just automatically cleared things away. Like the appetizer! The beloved calamari that everyone was enjoying they just took it away in a flash and gave us our entrees. Actually I don't remember the waitstaff talking at all. The prices on the menu were great. You can enjoy a night out without spending a lot. I agree with what other reviewers wrote this place is very noisy, the noise is reminiscent of a elementary school lunchroom. Other than that the place is great and I would like to see what it's like on a night when it's not so crowded. I would go here more often if I lived in Brooklyn.",4.0
The coconut and chicken soup was nice and hot. I also ordered the chicken and broccoli with green curry over pad thai was really good. I couldnt finish it because the portion was big.

So, if I personally had to decide on whether or not I wanted to go back there, you can bet your sweet ass I would.",4.0
"I've been a long faithful customer of Song ever since I discovered it.  The ""small"" calamari is more than enough for 2 people.  The portion  is big, and the specials are seasonal.  Great ambiance and very reasonable in price.  Thumbs up!",5.0
"This is a great place with tasty, reasonably priced food.  I order from here all the time and am particularly impressed by the Mango Gai Yang.  This dish is an order of the Joya Mango Salad (delicious), a quarter chicken and sticky rice.  It is very healthy and costs only $8.95.  There is just one thing that I don't understand: when I call for delivery the phone is sometimes busy for extended amounts of time.  I try to give them business but can't get through.  These people really need to invest in another phone line because they are losing a ton of business.",4.0
"Good food, nice atmosphere quick service. Mosquitoes out back and need to re-upholster their benches.",4.0
"I am a fan!  Yelp led me here and I am loving this site for it.  We had mussels as an appetizer for $7.95 and the plate was enough to feed 3 of us without anyone thinking that ""hey, i should stop eating this so what's-his-name and what's-her-name can have some"".  The accompanying chili-basil sauce was deliciously savory without being overwhelming.  For entrees, the menu offers a large tasty-sounding choices.  We finally decided on shrimp in green curry, chicken pad thai, and a special that featured chicken thigh, mango salad, and sweet rice.  We left with happy taste buds and no regrets.  I cannot wait to go back to try the rest of the dishes!",5.0
"I only give this place 4 stars: 1) for not accepting credit cards and 2) for not having enough people to answer the phone to take my order. BUT that being said, I have read a lot of reviews of people hating this place because it's not ""REAL THAI."" Um.. not many restaurants offering any type of Asian themed cuisine serve Americans the real deal. If you want REAL THAI FOOD go to Thailand. Otherwise, enjoy the cheap food, spicy noodles with chicken, great calamari, and kitchen with a window to the world so that you can make sure there are no rats running around. I walk my dog past here every morning and there is always someone scrubbing the place. I like that it's clean. The delivery is fast. And the mango salad is a GO!  I also enjoy getting take out and taking it to the bar with me. Nothing like the smell of crushed red peppery food to get the guys a-lookin'.",4.0
"Song/Joya are one of the best spots for Thai food in this part of Brooklyn. The menus are identical and the atmosphere similar, except the outdoor space is better at Joya (a little larger, and there are trees all around so you kind of feel like you are in a garden). The noodle dishes are large, cheap (under $10) and always taste fresh. I have had every noodle dish on the menu and find them all good, but the top is probably anything with the Spicy Basil sauce. Their mango salad is the best, also a nice size serving and they have amazing fried calamari with a Thai dipping sauce that is similar to sweet and sour. I don't love curries, but what I have had was good. The wine is affordable as well. Some may find it loud inside because there is often a DJ. The only thing they lack are desserts, but I am always so satisfied by my meal that it really isn't an issue!  Chances are there will be a wait on a weekend night, but it is worth it. When I lived in the neighborhood I would go weekly because really there isn't a better deal or better quality Thai spot in Park Slope or Carroll Gardens.",5.0
"I like Song.  The wait for a table is long, and it is very loud, but the music is right up my alley and there is a bar to wait at.  The food is pretty decent.  Recently I went there and had the ""Thai"" Mussels and a Massaman curry and it was all very good.  It's not the best Thai I've ever had, but it's good, cheap and hits the spot.",4.0
"The waitstaff was not enthusiastic or overly friendly, but brought everything we asked for timely.We ordered a large calamari, good and really big portion.  The spicy shrimp noodle, though with rave reviews, was burnt many places and was just fine.  We order the special fried whole fish with coconut curry, which was one of the few items over $10.  The Thai ice tea was good too.With pretty good price, big portion, convenient location, we will return.",3.0
"One of my favorite Thai places in New York and definitely my favorite in Brooklyn. Great food, low prices. I always eat Sate Chicken for appetizer and Pad See Ew with Beef (no Broccoli).

"The best thing going about this place is the hype, lots of people waiting for a seat on Friday and Saturday evenings.  Food wise, it's very oily and salty.  Both the green curry and pineapple-pork fried rice were just over-oiled and over-seasoned.  Pad see ew was admittedly quite tasty.Despite the thousands of Thai restaurants in NYC, I'm stll searching for the place that reminds me of the balance of lightness, seasoning and flavor I experienced in Thailand.  Thus far I've found too much sauce, salt and oil.Update: after my initial review based a recent experience, I admittedly felt that perhaps I should give them another chance, which I did last nite.  Result - downgraded to 1 star.  It was even worse the second time, and on second thought the pad see ew isn't passable at all.  Prices are good but what's the point if your taste buds are left sorely disappointed?",1.0

I have been meaning to write this review ever since I went to Song last month.  I had a such a nice time there and enjoyed the food & service very much.  They were so accommodating - even letting the 2 people that arrived first from our party of 7 order appetizers that were ready on the table when the rest of us arrived.  They also seemed to have the right balance of attentiveness mixed with giving the group it's privacy.  I could not believe the low bill at the end of a night - when I thought for sure we'd eaten them out of house and home and expected a bill that would reflect that.  It was extremely reasonable and very high quality.  So good!!  I will definitely be returning!,5.0

"Great vibe at night, super crowded but fun. Delicious papaya salad (sweet rather than salty) and the giant prawn special over noodles in a green curry sauce rocked it! Great little bar with a nice white wine selection ($5 a glass). Just some really solid thai flavors that most everyone seems to know about already!",4.0
I have been meaning to write this review ever since I went to Song last month.  I had a such a nice time there and enjoyed the food & service very much.  They were so accommodating - even letting the 2 people that arrived first from our party of 7 order appetizers that were ready on the table when the rest of us arrived.  They also seemed to have the right balance of attentiveness mixed with giving the group it's privacy.  I could not believe the low bill at the end of a night - when I thought for sure we'd eaten them out of house and home and expected a bill that would reflect that.  It was extremely reasonable and very high quality.  So good!!  I will definitely be returning!,5.0
"For the price, this place definitely deserves 4 stars. The food is good , the atmosphere is nicer than your typical inexpensive Thai spot and they have very good drinks (love the lychee martini). Cant be beat for what it is!",4.0
"SONG is:Cheap, chic and quite trendy. You can't go wrong taking a date or a group of friends here. There is a nice outdoor patio that would be great to sit in during the summer. Good music. It also serves up pretty decent ""Thai"" food (very white-washed, but still quite good)... the great prices and awesome atmosphere make up for everything.",4.0
I go here all the time for Thai food in Brooklyn. Pretty tasty food and the environment is nice as well. I thought this place was really aunthentic Thai food until I went to California but it's still pretty tasty never-the-less,3.0
"Park Slope is uber Thai friendly, and you'd be hard pressed to find a Thai-less block.  Accordingly, people tend to find their favorite spots and stick to them.I went to Song for the first time on a second date.  The date went south faster than geese fleeing winter.  We had little in common and the conversation was labored.  So I started to pay more and more attention to the restaurant.  Wow!It was roomy, airy, and mellow; a far cry from the tiny and brightly colored spots I was loyal to, but it worked.  The food came out super fast, looking and smelling incredible.  The date was nervous because she ""wasn't an adventurous eater"".  I walked her through the dishes and ended up having a great time talking about food.My date may not have, but you, dear Song, have found a nook in my heart.",4.0
The decor atmosphere was nice but the food was average at best . I wouldn't compare it to SEA at all . I had the salmon and Thai broccoli which was ok but the salmon was too dry probably do to the fact the had one cook and one waitress serving a bunch of people. Its a cool spot to go to but i perfer Joya .,3.0
"For the neighborhood, this is a relatively decent offering for asian food.  The ambiance is hip and they have a nice outdoor area in the back.  I would categorize the food quality as a step above Chinese take-out.  It is not very authentic for Thai food.  However, the friendly service, pleasant food presentation, and vibrant atmosphere make up for their shortcomings.",3.0
"This place is great, really stretches your dollar, but maybe it's due to the fact they take cash only, but otherwise the food is really great, one of the best I have ever had.

"The chicken curry puffs were amazing.  The sauces for every dish were fantastic.  Erin's favorite was the coconut soup... it was super creamy and flavorful.  We both got chicken curry, which had plenty of vegetables and meat and was served with a generous portion of rice.  Maurice thought his was slightly too sweet, but he still couldn't stop eating it.  The ice tea was classic.  The service was impersonal but got the job done.  We would definitely go back!!",4.0

"This Thai restaurant is worth a trip to Brooklyn and back. Go early before 8pm OR you will have to wait at least 45min to be seated.

Everything on the menu from the soups to entrees are dig in good. I've been there a couple times to know that its all very fresh and original. Here are my recommended favorites: Spicy Noodle, Shrimp Fried Rice, Chef's Spl.Chicken or Beef Puffs(they are large so I suggest if you order them skip getting another appetizer), Tom Ka Gai (coconut soup with shrimp and mushrooms), Tom Yum Koong (hot and sour soup with shrimp and mushrooms), Kang Masaman (sliced chicken or beef with potatoes and peanuts in a massaman coconut curry sauce) and if you are looking for a refreshing salad try out their Papaya or Mango Salad.

"There are many reasons to love Song. Unfortunately, its food just isn't one of them. For the money, it's the best deal in Park Slope. The dishes are both cheap (most under $8) and plentiful, and though nothing will blow your mind, noodle dishes, soups, appetizers and entrees all arrive consistently hot, larger than you expected, and vaguely spicy. This is, sadly, the most you can say for it. My Tom Ka Gai arrived with the chicken tasting as plain as if it had been boiled in water, and the mushrooms absolutely uncooked. Staples like Pad Thai are just a little too greasy, a little too bland, a little too mediocre. It's the sort of take-out food you eat when you're on a budget and want to believe you can supply yourself with something more nourishing than Top Ramen. Song manages this level of competence, but only just. The atmosphere is Song's redemption. The DJ is both intrinsically cooler than everyone in the room and understands the exact level of bass that conversation can bear. The music is always on, always good, and always something you can't remember having heard before, but you like it. You wish that you could get a list of all songs played during your visit with your receipt. The staff is friendly and so are the cooks - if you come in on a busy night as part of a twosome, you can snag the two stools at the stone bar facing into the kitchen, where you can watch as what you believed is confirmed: the same spices go into everything. Song's sleek silver decor and highly maintained bar also count for something, though the bartender is easily stumped by drink requests.

"this is one of my favorite restaurants. the food is great (i gluttonously enjoy Americanized Thai food.) my room mates and eat here, or from here, several times a week. the prices are awesome-- for $7ish you can have a noodle dish, with your choice of meat. if you order to-go, the portions are incredibly larger. also, i'm very picky and always alter my orders a good deal, and they've never messed up a dish.hm. i guess i should mention that a few months ago, my friend ordered a noodle dish to-go, and there were several shards of glass in it. he couldn't eat it and it cut his mouth a little. but my food was fine that night, and has been impeccable since. my friend still eats there. we didn't complain about the glass because we didn't want to risk our friendly dependence on this place. i'm going to give them 5 stars despite the glass incident, because it's so great.we like: the pad thai, the beef and broccoli dish, the spicy noodles, the spring rolls. and they have blue moon on tap. oh yeah, cash only",5.0

"Good food, great (outdoor) atmosphere (indoors is too loud!). The restaurant seems like it should be expensive; but it's priced affordable. I always do a double take when I get the (low) bill.",5.0
"Eating at this restaurant was the sole reason I am back on Yelp.  I couldn't wait to tell the world about this marvel.  How are they able to serve this excellent Thai food in a setting that you might find at trendy SoHo or Tribeca hotspots, but at prices you might find in Buffalo or Cleveland?  Seriously.... everything is under $8?  It's probably not the most authentic Thai food around, though it's close.  The menu also isn't as big as Sripraphai's, but hey, it's ridiculously cheap!  I also heard there's a DJ on Friday nights.  This probably doesn't qualify as a restaurant I'd eat at all the time because of it's trendy nature, but it certainly is one I'd go to for several special occassions (and guests would never know that it would be cheaper than buying value meals for everyone at McD's!).",5.0
"I finally figured out why the name of the restaurant is called Song.  The restaurant has the right combination of value quality and service, all for a song.  I was apprehensive whether or not the restaurant would be worth the 30 minute wait late Saturday evening. For the price point and quality of the food, it seemed worth it. I had the Pad Thai with shrimp and the portion was huge almost fit for two people. Note I said almost. In the end I walked out having dinner for two for less than $30. I can definitely say it was worth the wait. Song has earned a repeat customer.  One item to note this restaurant does not accept credit cards.",5.0
"this is one of my favorite restaurants. the food is great (i gluttonously enjoy Americanized Thai food.) my room mates and eat here, or from here, several times a week. the prices are awesome-- for $7ish you can have a noodle dish, with your choice of meat. if you order to-go, the portions are incredibly larger. also, i'm very picky and always alter my orders a good deal, and they've never messed up a dish.hm. i guess i should mention that a few months ago, my friend ordered a noodle dish to-go, and there were several shards of glass in it. he couldn't eat it and it cut his mouth a little. but my food was fine that night, and has been impeccable since. my friend still eats there. we didn't complain about the glass because we didn't want to risk our friendly dependence on this place. i'm going to give them 5 stars despite the glass incident, because it's so great.we like: the pad thai, the beef and broccoli dish, the spicy noodles, the spring rolls. and they have blue moon on tap. oh yeah, cash only",5.0
"Great food - great atmosphere - love this place.  I have a question for Noel C who gave it a bad rating because he was asked to take his drinks to the bar so the table could be used for people who were waiting to eat.  Mr. Noel, how would you have felt if you had been standing in line for 30 minutes and you clearly saw a table being used for people to drink at while they could have been sitting at the bar and the owner was there and did nothing?  You were not a victim of discrimination, you were thoughtless and inconsiderate.  Nobody asked you to leave - they just asked to you move to the bar so the table could be used by someone who was waiting for dinner.  That's called courtesy - did you ever hear of that??????",5.0
"I had delicious green curry with chicken from Song for lunch. The only drawback is that I'd like to see lunch specials, which are common at most Thai places.  I had carry-out so can't really judge the interior experience.",4.0
"This place is one of the better resturants in the area and the prices are so reasonable.  The only issue is the wait time for dinner but they have a nice bar and few seats on the side which you can grab a drink while you wait.The food is so good. I have had the mango salad, chicken green curry, the spicy flat noodle dish just to name a few and everything is great.We had 3 people a ton of food and drinks and with tip our bill was 90 which isn't so bad at all.  I'll keep coming to this place but I will have to start going earlier just so I don't have to wait as long.",4.0
I loved this place. I got there early to meet some friends and sat at the bar while I waited. The bartender was so nice. Reminded me of a kempt amy winehouse (if thats even possible).  The atmosphere was cool. Very chill and fun. The food was good too. Although I will admit that I'm not a Thai connoisseur so I cant vouch for ho authentic it was. The service  sucked but for the price I think I can deal. Try it out!,4.0

"Definitely one of the better Thai experiences that I've had. I ordered a ton of food and a bottle of wine and the bill was like $40 for two people, with plenty of leftovers. The food was really good. I had spicy noodles, chicken with garlic vegetables and dumplings and the spring rolls and a summer roll. Spring rolls are a little greasy, and the summer rolls had shrimp in it, which was upsetting because I don't eat that stuff and it didn't say it in the menu. However, the main courses were very tasty, and the service was great, and everything came out quickly and it was good times.

"I have been going to Song for a couple of years now. Song is owned by the same people who run Joya in Carroll Gardens. Even though the food is the same, I just enjoy the Park Slope location more. The atmosphere is great and the bar is really a great place to hang out after dinner. Good DJ on the weekends for the dinner time rush. As many have already said, the service is quick and very nice. It gets even better when the food is at a cheap price. It's a real bargain because you can make a whole night out of this place with food, drinks, and entertainment. Now, for the most important element- the food. They change up the specials often and they're usually great. I once had BBQ spare ribs in a sweet honey glazed sauce. Fantastic. The flat noodles with beef is always something I get for dinner and you would think that after having it so many times it would fall short every now and then. But that's not the case with Song. As an Italian I'm very picky when I see something like fried calamari on a Thai menu, but I'm always more than willing to try. The calamari can sometimes be a little soggy, but it's usually crispy. The ace in the hole in this dish is the sauce, and it's not in a tomato sauce. The only way I can describe the sauce is sweet and spicy at the same time and I always need extra. After dinner, get the sticky rice with mango to go with your drinks. Park Slope is being over populated lately with Thai cuisine restaurants. Some have come and gone over the last few years but Song is still there and running really strong. Give it a try and you'll see what I'm talking about.",4.0
I would give Song a 5 Star for price and atmosphere; but I think the food is a bit lacking in flavor. Sometimes the shrimp are overcooked and often the chicken is a bit on the dry side. The big + is that it is a fun place to eat and the servers seem nice.,3.0
"Song was a fantastic discovery, thanks to Yelp. There is a wait, even on weekdays (I think there was a 40 minute wait last Tuesday--we were too hungry, had to defer), but if you come expecting to wait, you will be rewarded. The food is delicious and the drinks are generous. And you will have leftovers. Leftover Thai might be better than leftover pizza!",4.0

"Wow.  It's a sad Song for sure.  What happened to the Song I used to look forward to?  I've only ordered delivery, so I can't speak for the staff or service.  However, the quality of ingredients and preparation of the food leave MUCH to be desired.  Thai food, typically known for a bold and spicy flavor profile has been rendered bland and mute by this once enviable kitchen.  My beef was of such poor quality that I actually had to double check that it was indeed, actually, beef.  My chicken was overcooked, my vegetables undercooked.  My Summer roll was poorly sliced, so that when I tried to remove a piece from the box, the whole thing came unwrapped.  It's no fun eating an unrolled roll. $40 in the trash.

I call back and they assure me that my food was on the way. I reconfirmed my address with them, the order, everything. By 10:15 I was damn hungry and getting agitated.

"Delicious food, great prices, fun ambiance and huge portions!This place rocks and is a great place for having fun with friends or being flirty on a date...just remember to bring cash (cards not accepted!!)--tofu panang is amazing and can be made spicier if desired...enough to always leave with a doggie bag and makes another meal the next day...only $7-- yummy appetizers, esp fried tofu that is served with delicious chili peanut sauce... about $4--great full bar with yummy mango martinis, champagne, wine list and shots are served in champagne glasses- fun!-- all around fun atmosphere- DJ spinning fun music, kitchen open late (till 12:30 am on weekends), usually pretty packed but wait is 15/20 minutes tops!Only complaint is that the service is sllloooowww, so be sure to order up once you nab the wait staff!",5.0
"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.  Probably my fave restaurant in NYC.  The food is always delicious (no, it's not the best Thai I've ever had, but it's always really fresh and really good), and the outdoor seating in summer is something I always look forward to.  The best thing about it?  It's VERY affordable for the ambiance, service, and food. Well worth the trip.",4.0

"Very good prices for large dishes.  Some of their dishes are a little salty with all the sauces used, but if you choose correctly, you will end up with a huge delicious dish.  I've never really had to wait very long for my food at Song or very long to be seated, but it may be the time of the week I've been to the restaurant.",4.0

Song is my FAVORITE Thai restaurant!  The mango martinis brighten up any bad day (or good day) and the entree portions are very generous.  I have loved everything I have tried on the menu and look forward to their daily specials.,5.0
Unbeatable for its quantity/quality of food and price point.  Very hip space with loud vibrating music but my grandparents still liked the experience here.  Menu ranges from $7-10 and specials up to $14.Good dishes:-calamari!!

"Its reliably very good Thai food at reasonable prices.  As a vegetarian, I appreciate the number of such choices on the menu.  Overall the place has a nice atmosphere (nice and trendy), and good wait staff.  My only bone against the place (I went on a Wednesday night, the place was packed) is that it got REALLY loud in there.  But, that's common in many NY restaurants, it just seemed more so for some reason at Song.",4.0
"Ordered delivery from here.  In short, I was disappointed in the level of spicy, and had to supplement with my own hot sauce.  Spicy noodles were not spicy, and were a little cheap with the shrimp.  The fried shrimp appetizer was tasty, but most fried things are.  The papaya salad was fresh, but far from spicy enough.  The prices are reasonable, but I felt it was a get what you pay for situation.",2.0

Once seated, our waitress was attentive enough, friendly, and great about keeping the table clear. The calamari appetizer was a little under fried and floury for my taste, but the summer roll was tasty. Everyone was satisfied with their entrees ( fried seabass in coconut-curry w/ veggies, beef in chili basil w/ tons of veggies, tofu pad see ew, chicken and string beans in red curry, and chicken in garlic reduction w/ tons of veggies). The portions, as mentioned by all other yelpers, are more than generous (I mean even the pad see ew noodles were bigger than I'm used to). Amassing everyone's leftovers I can comfortably say I have lunch for 3 days or so : ) More impressive than the portions, their ability to retain each dish's flavor.

"Great value!  This place is semi-trendy, and cheap!  You can't go wrong with the curry dishes (they are all variations of the same thing...just one or two different ingredients).  The spicy noodles are delish as well.  I went with a friend on a Friday night...there was a bit of wait, but we just ordered a bottle of wine at the bar.  The bartender was a bit slow and confused with the bottle prices, but she was nice enough.  ps, two dishes is PLENTY for 2 people.  A nice place for an inexpensive Park Slope feast.",4.0
"I joined an old friend for a great dinner here.  I love Thai food, have had it on three continents, including all over Thailand.  This was a great version of Americanized Thai, large American protions, with slightly milder spice than a Thai would want.  I orderd the chicken red curry, it was great.  I tried tone dish that I have never had before, and loved it.  The best part for me is that they serve Singha beer, an uncommon find in Brooklyn.  They had a pretty good DJ spinning, great ambiance.  The worst part is that they dont take credit cards.  As another reviewer said, this place is not match for Brown Sugar, but good nonetheless--Check it out.",3.0
"I'm into it.  Since I live in the area, it's totally convenient.  The food is reliably good and flavorful.  And seriously, you can't beat the prices.  You get more than your money's worth.  If it were up to me, I'd eat here a couple times a week, or at least once a week.  The couple times that I've actually eaten here ( I usually take out )  I noticed that it gets pretty packed.  I like the sparse interior and wish that the garden was open, I guess it's too cold now, but it looked nice out there.  They have dj's and the music can get a bit loud and distracting, so if you're looking for a romantic date spot, maybe this isn't it.  Its good for groups though.",4.0
"I hesitate to give a place 5 stars, but really, I don't think that I could ask for much more and would give this place 5 stars in comparison to similar type food.  The entrees have generous portions and are so reasonably priced for dinner!  And good tasting!  I got the chicken and brocolli in masaman curry sauce which was flavorful, and the curry puffs for apps were good as well, although there were only 2 of them.  We got entrees and maybe 4 apps for 4 people just because it was so inexpensive.  The atmosphere was good, not excellent, but it was neat that they had a DJ, who happened to love 80's music (I went on a friday night).  There was a 30-40 minute wait for dinner, but we went across the street to Bar Loki and sat in the outdoor patio and had a couple of drinks while we were waiting.",5.0
Can't get enough of the spicy noodles. Seriously. One time after I broke up with a girl I locked myself in my room and subsisted off them for a whole week. It was the best week ever. Thanks to the noodles.,4.0
"My favorite place for Thai in all the five boroughs.  Extremeley tasty food at very reasonable prices, and the decor is not the usual cheesy-Thai-restaurant decor.  I've tried many things on the menu and have only been disappointed by one (I believe it was a mango chicken dish?), but the staples like pad thai, chicken with green or masaman curry, and Thai salad always deliver and are always extermely satisfying.  Service at times can be rushed, but the proprietor of the business, Glenn is a great guy who sometimes comes out of his way to check on you.",4.0
I went to Song tonight for the first time based on Yelp reviews. I recently moved into the neighborhood and had no idea where to go for good Thai.When I first got there I was afraid it was another hipster joint where ambiance was more important than the food. I was wrong. I ordered the spicy squid salad and a chicken curry dish made with coconut milk who's name escapes me at the moment. Salad came out fast and had a good amount of squid. For $4.95 I expected a small salad with a small amount of squid but was pleased with what arrived. The curry dishes come with a serving of white rice which equals out to about a large soup ladle size. The curry on the other hand comes out in a large bowl that could feed two if needed. I'm a big rice eater and love curry so my only negative was they served more curry than rice. I usually pour curry on my rice so it would be nice if they gave more rice but this is a minor complaint. I just have leftovers and will make my own rice tomorrow to enjoy a delish dinner again. The curry was priced at $8.95 so I was stuffed with leftovers all for approx $16 with tax. Not bad at all and I will return to try the other dishes.I only gave 4 stars because it was my first time going so I don't praise somewhere I've only done once. I need consistency to give 5 stars.,4.0
I love this place. It's unbelievable to me that such good Thai food could be so inexpensive. I'd give it five stars if I could go there and have a meal without having to scream to the person across from me over the loud music.,4.0
thai food mixed with crack! once you eat here you will be addicted for life.,5.0
"The best Thai food I've had in Park Slope.  Unfortunately, they play deafening music so you can't really hear yourself think.",3.0
"Affordable with large, tasty portions. The pad thai is too lime-heavy for my taste but I love the spring rolls, red and green curries, as well as the broad noodles with Chinese broccoli. It's a step above usual takeout quality but don't expect anything transcendent; the four-star rating reflects the value offered.",4.0
"I would give this place 5 stars if the service was better.  I completely understand it was a Saturday night, raining and we needed a table for 5 people, but we all hope for a perfect dining experience whenever trying a new restaurant.  Anyway, the good stuff...We had 2 appetizers 4 main courses and a bottle of wine for well under $100.  The chicken satay was really good and the calamari was also great.  I had the salmon special, it came in a spicy coconut curry sauce and topped with veggies, cashews and came with a side of rice.  It was indeed quite spicy but everything was perfectly cooked and wonderfully yummie.  Here's another service issue...I had a spicy dish and I therefore finished my water and no one came to fill it.  I hate it when people think once you get your food you don't need anything anymore.  We'll definitely come back and see if our next service experience is any better.  If anything I recommend getting the food delivered that's what a friend of mine does and she loves it.  Enjoy!",4.0

this is one of my favorite thai spots in brooklyn. trendy but not expensive. food is way better than sea in williamsburg. music is low enough where you can still have a convo and not lose your voice trying to scream over it. outside back area is definitely a pro. perfect :),5.0
"Excellent restaurant thats easy on the wallet.  The food is well marinated with fresh seafood that comes quite close to authentic flavors.  Ambience is great, with outdoor seating.  I've been coming here regularly for my thai food, because I've been disappointed with a lot of other lame, fusion thai restaurants. Highly recommended. Not BYOB - they have a full bar.",4.0

"Like trying to enjoy a meal on the 6 train. On a Sat. night the wait to be seated was about 45 minutes. Once we sat, the service was very prompt and efficient.  The food was great: tasty, generous portions, not greasy at all.  But, oh the noise in this place!  I think they keep the prices so low by having fast turnover, something the awful noise level facilitates.  I get trendy: dark minimalist decor, big open space, etc..., and I see how having a dj could add to the hip factor.  But the music is awful, and it is so so loud.  This results in the customers yelling to be heard, and the vicious cycle of noise escalation.  You cannot have a conversation in here.  So, you eat quickly and get out.  This might be a good place to go with someone you don't really want to talk to.  You can eat quickly and then say that you have to go home--obligation met.  But if you have any desire to eat in a relaxing manner, one where you enjoy good company and good conversation, pass on Song.",3.0
"on the wrong night of the week, the waits here can be ridiculous! on a summer evening though, if you can score a spot on the patio, it's mighty nice.once you're seated, however, it's always fast and delicious.  this is hands down my favourite thai in the city!
