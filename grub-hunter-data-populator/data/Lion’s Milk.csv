"Came across this charming cafe/coffee shop on my way to the Bedford L stop. What a pleasant surprise. Not your usual Williamsburg store. To start off, their coffee is among the finest in the neighborhood. What sets them apart is their Turkish coffee. It is authentic and genuine taking me of being back to the shores of the Bosphorus. And the kind Turkish couple offered a complimentary Turkish delight with the coffee. Food was fresh and original in its taste. Everything item on the shelves is thoughtfully curated and placed, with a sundry of food items from not just Turkey but has a unique flavor that sets it apart from the stores around. There is an area to sit inside, but also a quaint patio out front that is ideal. Highly recommend!!",5.0
Stumbled on this cafe during a morning neighborhood scouting mission.  Did not even know that it is owed by a lovely Turkish couple.  The coffee is real Turkish coffee- nice!  The place has a couple of chairs and a table and a bench where you can sit outside.  Inside it also sells artisan pasta and pastry.  We had a great break and got a lots of local info too from speaking to the owners and other customers.  Great friendly vibe.,5.0
Why is this place rated so highly?Upon walking in I loved how they sold artisanal pastas (squid ink pasta) and some Turkish goodies. But I paid $22 for two sandwiches and two cortados. Very steep. Even for this neighborhood. This is a classic case of small portions being sold for double the price. The coffee was good (they use coffee from Devociòn) but slightly bitter and stale compared to how I've had it at Devociòn.My major problem is how incredibly small their sandwiches are. Nowhere does it say legibly that their sandwiches are on MINI baguettes. Charging $7.50 for a sandwich that's a quarter size of what it should be?! I've been to so many Turkish restaurants/cafes and Turkish homes and I'm kind of sad that their portion sizes are like this. My best friend is Turkish and I would've loved to take her here to a place that's close by me but I just can't get over how overpriced this sandwich is. Delicious albeit but you could make it at home for half the price. I will not return.,2.0
I found this place thanks to the Cups App. It was new so I figured to check it out on Yelp and Instgram and it seemed safe to personally come check it out. It is super cute and the people who work there are really nice!,5.0
Amazing place! Coffee is delicious and the potato borek is out of this world. Great addition to the neighborhood.,5.0
"The cutest coffee spot! It's very nice and peaceful in there. I had the Turkish coffee but to be honest, I had no idea how to drink it. I was told to wait for the grounds to settle but then do you not drink the last sip and leave the coffee grounds on the bottom to not eat them? Lol dumb question.Anyways, the owner was super sweet and gave me a sample of the Turkish delight to try and they were literally SO good. Worth coming here to just purchase a box!",5.0
"The coffee is bomb! And the food is super fresh and delicious. It's decor is cute and boutique-like, but the vibe is dope. Dude, live music?There's something about the vibe there that just makes me feel like I'm still in a local, authentic, and original spot. It's hard to find a new spot nowadays that's not just pandering to that wannabe village scene.",5.0

"Turkish style cafe with very traditional decor. Small, but gives a very cozy feeling. Coffee is superb as I've tried most of the places in the area. The two owners were behind the counter and were very friendly, even gave me a complimentary treat to enjoy with my Turkish coffee. Will definitely come back and continue tasting the menu!",5.0
I recently went to lions milk with a friend. I was wowed. The service was exceptional and the coffee was to die for. I'm a coffee freak so with that being said...... I'm hooked. Great place to pick up your morning coffee on the way to work. There are not many great coffee places like this in Brooklyn let alone manhattan. The breakfast sandwiches were amazing as well. I was very pleased and will deff be stopping there every morning for now on.,5.0

"Finally Devocion coffee is down the block !  I've been a big fan of Devocion on Grand St, but that's obviously too far from N6th, when they opened I just walked in to see, and boom they serve Devocion coffee!! I was sooo happy.. Now the store is my first stop every morning.. I like their bakery stuff as well - they come from Balthazar guys actually, they also have some nice gourme sandwiches, stop by, you won't regret...",5.0

"So happy to finally have his place on the corner.  Very nice and personable staff, the coffee is always delish!  Been going to Oslo and Gimmee for years and I think the quality is better and more consistent at Lions Milk.  Have gone everyday since they opened!  Great sandwich options also- and lots of vegetarian options!  Also the random things they sell are awesome!  Exiting addition to the hood!",5.0
