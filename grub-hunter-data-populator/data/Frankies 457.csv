"Once again a case of my disappearing Yelp reviews so rather than wasting time rewriting will cut to the chase. Been coming here since they opened and learned there are really only 3 things to get here: sausage cavateli, meatball sandwich,  lentil soup.  All are phenomenal and worth the wait to get.  Thankfully they finally take credit cards.",4.0
"Atmosphere: It was a really cute and rustic and intimate place. Really pretty garden in the back that I imagine would be beautiful when the weather gets warmer. The bathroom was really cute too! hahaFood: The food overall was good, not great. The homemade pastas were tasty. Portions were fair (not too big, not too small), definitely can finish in one sitting. There's no complimentary bread or anything and we didn't order any appetizers so we actually ended up hungry soon afterwards. I guess I am more use to having a bigger meal at an Italian restaurant. One thing that turned me off was all the food came out a little luke warm.... Just doesn't taste as fresh when it's room temperature.My friends tried to order 2 different kinds of wines and apparently both were out so they had to substitute.Service:I thought our server could've been more polite. Menus were kind of thrown down on the table. He came and went with our orders, like ""what are you having? Ok. Ok. OK.""  Very curt and gave us weird looks when we asked questions. It also took him a very long time to come get our orders. Everything kind of was slow and we were just very hungry. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place considering there are SO many great places in Brooklyn. Not a place I'd go back to.",3.0
"Bottom Line: Some of the best restaurants are in Carroll Gardens and Frankies 457 is no exception.I came here on a Friday for dinner based on my friends recommendation. Everyone suggests to get the pasta and it's true. It's that damn good. The portion sizes for the pasta are not huge but will fill you up with the right appetizer.Definitely Get:- Meatballs with Pine Nuts & Raisins (Better than the Meatball Shop)- Cavatelli with Faiccos Hot Sausage & Browned Sage Butter (This was the best damn pasta I've ever ate)- Pappardelle with Braised Lamb, Tomato & Tarragon (Delicious, shredded lamb with big flavor)",4.0
"Tough call on this one I wanted to love it, the restaurant itself is beautiful has alot of characterI respect the kitchen, poor guys cook in the open in a small galley kitchen and put the food out quickly.First strike, full bar with no Jack Daniels....really?Full disclosure I went the day after Palm Sunday, I had a beautiful Italian dinner in my house for the holiday.I dont think any meal would have met my standards but I am afraid Frankies fell short. I ordered 2 antipasto plates, the broccoli rabe on the plate was excellent, the portions were a bit stingy but the quality of the cured meats and cheeses were very good.I had their Eggplant Marinara, I didnt enjoy it all.The eggplant was lightly floured and fried and was layered between marinara sauce. The sauce was good, the eggplant not so much. I was looking for some mozzarella or ricotta. I had a side of gnoochi with marinara and ricotta, marginally better.My guests reviews were mixed.Desserts looked great, I may stop in for coffee and dessert. I wouldnt go back for dinner.",3.0
"- Brunch till 4PM-super limited brunch menu so I say get the ""to die for"" french toast. You will not be disappointed. -Meatball sandwich was good, sort of bordering on the bland but that might be a -good thing if you are not a salt freak like me.-Bloody Mary was nice and spicyBar is nice to chill and read a paper.-Place is huge so even if you have to wait, you won't wait long.did I mention, get the french toast? YUM!",4.0
"I came to this little treasure trove with my boss and co-worker to have a lunch meeting. This is a house turned restaurant. When the weather permits you have a choice of eating indoors or outdoors. Since it was a nice day we chose to sit outside. The inside is very nice with great decor. The front is more for take out but they also have inside sitting in the back of the restaurant. Choosing to sit outside since is was a nice day, we were lead to our table. We were given a complimentary bottle of water. Most of not all of the dishes involved some kind of pasta. I opted for the lump crab with spaghetti with marinara sauce. My co-worker being a diabetic ordered a sweet potato ravioli. Both dishes were extremely good, my lump crab was fresh and you could tell me he marinara sauce was fresh.  As far as the drinks, they offer soda, juice, water, coffee, beer, and wine. Dessert is also an option. I decided on a slice of cake, which was so moist and fluffy. The prices are pretty fair, an entree will cost between $15.00 to $18.00. The dessert between $3.00 to $5.00. The drink was typical of any other restaurant except the wine. The wine was priced based on the type of wine and whether you want a glass or bottle. The staff was nice and friendly but a tid bit slow, but considering the amount to people dining and the number of wait staff it was understandable. If I'm ever in the area during lunch or dinner time, I'll definitely dine here again.",4.0
"Went there for Sat lunch. Friends recommend this place for pasta. But I honestly don't understand why a no meat pasta can charge around $20. I think it's over price and not something very special. We only tried 2 pasta so maybe some thing better out there. Properly will not go back as home made pasta should be a lot better.  It's tasty, but not very special to blow my mind. I am 108lbs but 1 serving of pasta cannot fill me up. It's not worth the money.",2.0
Host did not let us sit down for wine and she would not let us sit at the bar either. Outcome: we left the place. You should appreciate someone that comes to enjoy a glass of wine possibly coming to get something to eat. You suck at your job.,1.0
"I don't know where to start with this one. This is the restaurant that really opened my eyes to what food should taste like. I started eating here a year or two after they opened and knew right away they would be here to stay for a while. 12 years later and nothing has really changed. Simply Excellent. Walk in the door open the curtains and Frankies 457 hits you like a first round upper cut from Tyson. The amazing aromas that come out of that tiny little kitchen can not be duplicated. At least not anywhere in the states that I've eaten at. Some of my family and even my wife having been to Italy/ Sicily say this is the closest I'm going to get unless I go myself.  And they nailed the rustic vibe a decade before anyone else. A little about me. I've had to have eaten at over 5 maybe 600 restaurants, I've lost count. That's probably low ball. I have bookmarked around 200 places I've been to that are memorable and started yelping about them. 457 is my most memorable. I can't recall how many times I've eaten here because it's my go to spot. I find myself going to Frankie's more now after eating someplace that's just not good or mundane and I need to redeem my faith that there is great food out there. Sometimes we end up there the same night after a bad meal somewhere else. The whole Frankie's experience from walking through that curtain takes you to someplace special. Someplace that heightens all for your senses. Everything is Super Delicious. Here are my favorite dishesAll of the crostini especially the ricotta honey and black pepper. I still don't know how anyone can get a beet avocado salad to taste like that. The meatballs how my Sicilian granma used to make with pine nuts and raisins. Pappardelle and lamb amazing. No matter what else we are in the mood for that night we always get the cavatelli, either as an appetizer to split or as a main dish. My opinion the best pasta dish in the city.Dessert. Do Not Leave without having the red wine prunes.",5.0
"Lovely dinner at Frankie's 457 in Carroll Gardens. Be prepared to WAIT! On a Friday night around 7 pm, the wait for a table was an hour and a half. We gave our phone number and then went to hang out at a nearby bar. We were called back an hour later and ran to claim our table!The restaurant is tiny and beautiful, with dim lighting making for a romantic, special atmosphere. The waitstaff were friendly and attentive and the food was excellent. Favorites of the night included the superb meatballs (you MUST order these), the outstanding pork braciola (served only Friday to Sunday), and the perfectly textured gnocchi. Also lovely was the appetizer of soft, creamy mozzarella. While the pasta with sage and hot sausage was delicious, it was too heavy on my stomach, as portions were hearty. Regardless, everything was wonderful and I am very happy we finally had dinner at Frankie's.",5.0
"The warm spring air and the dim lit atmosphere allows for a wonderful experience in the courtyard. With the stones playing in the background, and the puscetto perfectly baked for appetizers there is still plenty of food to come. Hard cheeses and cooked vegetables follow, all before perfectly cooked pasta and sausage, meatballs, and branzino with the skin still on are marks of a high quality restaurant. All the while wine flows liberally. There will be many beautiful experiences this spring and summer in the outdoor area.",5.0
"I heard of this place through a friend and was excited to check it out. We didn;t have reservations and walked right in to be seated promptly at 6:30  pm. The restaurant is quite small with an outdoor garden which looked beautiful. The kitchen is smack in the middle of the restaurant which does make the inside a little toasty. We ordered the buffala salad to start- average but tasty and two glasses of white wine. For the entrees we got the pappardelle with braised lamb which was a little bit on the peppery side; in addiiton to the eggplant parmigiana which was amazing. I would have had a second portion.The dishes are not large, not like you would find in more commercial Italian restaurants.So after an appetizer , entree and bread I was still hungry. We shared the chocolate tart which wasn't great. The place does fill up and gets quite loud ( LOTS of young children) but I would definitely come back to try the other pasta options; the products all very very fresh and well made. Not too expensive either.",4.0
"Ever since I read in the NYTimes that the owners of Frankies conceive their food ideas via marijuana, nytimes.com/2010/05/19/d…, I was intrigued... After an hour wait, I *finally* dined at Frankies and was not disappointed. The highlights were the OLIVE OIL and the HOMEMADE PASTA and SAUCE. My spouse and I sat in the backyard and the ambiance was so romantic and gorgeous. Pebbled ground, rustic wood tables, beautiful lush trees and branches, lights strewn all over. It was a much more refined version of iCi's backyard (Fort Greene, BK). We ate family style and ate off the same plate, as we usually do.The olive oil was un-f***ingbelievable. My favorite item. I told my spouse that I may come back just to buy a bottle of that Sicilian olive oil and warned him that I may douse it all over him. I said this because I didn't enjoy the bread at all...too hard, stale-ish crusts... I was envisioning other ways to devour the oil in large quantities. DRINKS:My spouse ordered the cocktail with the ginger and fennel and he really enjoyed it. I think it tastes exactly like the liquid form of Supari (the fennel mixture you spoon into your mouth for digestion after a Desi meal). I had a great glass of red. The Dolcetto D'Alba - I asked to taste the funk, the dirt, the earth... and mentioned my love of Cote Rotie and they served up exactly what I asked for (It went SO well with the pasta).SALAD:We ordered the Braised Octopus with Dandelion Greens salad. The octopus was cooked very well, absolutely no rubber. The greens were not bitter as dandelion usually is and the castelvetrano olives actually had a flavor! They were lemony. It was a nice salad. Not punch me in the face amazing, but nice. We also ordered the Broccoli Rabe side to accompany our pasta. It was *bitter*, much more so than the dandelion greens. I have never had rabe that tasted like that before - but I am not a rabe expert. Not bad, not great. I do know that bitters are loaded with nutritional value - so I treated it as a welcomed medicinal food. PASTA:Since I don't eat meat (only fish/seafood), I asked for a veggie pasta recommendation. Note, their pastas are made fresh, in-house. I was told to order the linguini with fava beans, tomatoes, garlic and lightly toasted breadcrumbs. It was JAW-DROPPING GOOD. Did I mention their homemade sauce? I had no clue that tomato sauce could have so many delicate layers and still remain light. Wow. Their pastas are on par with Rucola. You cannot come here and not order one of them. After all, it's what Italians do best, right? DESSERT:Tiramisu with ladyfingers that were actually soaked in espresso!!!! Such a relief. It was really tasty, though the creme layer was too thick. But still much better than 90% of the Tiramisu's that I have tried in the City.We also added some Amaro to cap off the meal. The Montenegro was great - easy to drink, notes of saffron, coriander, orange, pepper, licorice. The Cynar - a bitter amaro made from artichokes was a no-go, too bitter... but SO glad we tried it. The staff, from the maitre d', the drink specialist, to our server, were all really nice, helpful and accommodating. Another solid restaurant to assuage future pasta cravings.",4.0
"This place is yummmmmmmmmmy. I ordered the most delicious pasta, and wasn't disappointed at all when it arrived and I scarfed it down. There was actually so much on my plate that I had to take some home!The only downside was my drink. I can't remember the name of it, but it was something alcoholic with apple in it, maybe? When it arrived, the glass was only filled up less than halfway. When I asked the waiter, he said that's the way the drink was made. I was pretty disappointed to be paying $12 for a drink when there was very little to it, and not much alcohol in it either. He came back about 10 minutes later to say he talked to the bartender AND the manager, and they confirmed that the drink was made correctly... which was nice, but a little unnecessary. I would've rather just had him fill the glass up the whole way instead of getting the confirmation from a bunch of people. Either way, otherwise it was a pleasant experience. It's a little tight, space-wise, but it's gorgeous inside: candles everywhere and a romantic ambience, staff is pleasant, food is fabulous.",4.0
I luckily came across this place. The service was good but the food was great. I had the octopus salad which was fresh and light.

"My boyfriend and I arrived on a busy late dinner Thursday evening, there was a 40 minute wait. Once we got in, the restaurant seemed cozy. We got to sit in a separate patio room, which had a very romantic ambiance. We ordered the Frankies Antipasto, which came promptly. The board itself had roasted cauliflower, broccoli rabe, olives, cheese and a large amount of cured meats. Their special neon green olive oil is certainly a acquired taste, only one of us liked it. For our entrees we got the Linguini with Blue Crab Tomato Sauce, Chili & Basil, and the Cavatelli with Faiccos Hot Sausage & Browned Sage Butter. The linguini was tender and delicate. It had a good amount of crab, but it was a little too salty and heavy on the sauce. The cavetelli was nice an dense and tasted housemade. The sausage was nice and peppery.Pros: Good date spot, romantic patio, intimate, great antipasto, large wine selection, and great pasta textureCons: A little heavy handed with seasoning, and crowded Overall, Frankies is simple Italian done very well, just expect a wait during dinner hours.",4.0

"Still a fabulous and consistent spot in terms of service and good food.  It's like eating at home without having to think about it and cook. And I mean that as a compliment.While it is the kind of food we eat at home I find a lot of inspiration here, whether it's crisp radishes with anchovy vinaigrette or the classic meatballs (which changed my meatball life when their recipe was first published). Some meat sauces are over-salted. Personal thing?I love watching the kitchen - it's tiny, and super-efficient.The only real downside, and it is a real downer, is that it is DEAFENING. The dishes being slammed in and out of the dishwasher are the worst source of the noise, which is, I'm guessing, at dangerous decibel levels. Really, it's painful. People who bring babies here - and they do - are nuts.I am over the shouting-across-the-table thing. The bar is better than table seating in terms of noise, but make sure you sit near the door. If the acoustics were modified I'd be a regular.",4.0
"Best BLT I've ever had! I came here for brunch and figured you can't go wrong with a BLT. The bread was a flaky light crispy bread that was amazing. Normally with BLTs you get thick slices with thick crust that cuts your mouth, not this. The bacon they use in it is amazeballs. Thick cut, crispy, smoky, salty all the best things you can have. Plus they have homemade mayo on it that it excellently done. I would definitely come back for that alone! If you're stuck waiting in line for 3 hours for Buttermilk Channel come here instead.",5.0

"The food is pretty good, but not reliably so.  The cavatelli is fantastic; I have eaten at Frankie's many times over the years just to eat the cavatelli.  The last few times I tried different dishes, none of which have been memorable.  Some are above-average.  Some are mediocre.  Some are less than mediocre (seriously).The space is very uncomfortable and cramped, and the layout is awkward (especially the bar area).  The service is never great and can sometimes be very bad (careless, slow, inattentive, rude, etc.).  The food is just not good enough to justify the overall dining experience, in my opinion.But if you are in the mood for cavatelli with spicy sausage, it's definitely worth checking out.",3.0
"Horrible service, gave us attitude and told us that the table was reserved after us so we had to leave even though they told us they didn't take reservations when we called earlier",1.0
I was in town seeing some friends and we were thinking about brunch / lunch so they suggested we see how busy this place was. Luckily we only waited about 10 minutes on a Sunday afternoon. Very cute space.  The crostinis are good especially the kale   The beet and avocado salad was really tasty.  The pastas were all very very good as well.  The gnocchi were soft and pillowy.  Really really well done across the board.  I see why this place always seems to be so busy.,4.0
"A restaurant needs to leave the diner with a good experience overall-- When the hostess is absolutely rude, it speaks volumes about what's to come. We have been to Frankie's twice. First time food was good and we sat outside- nice ambiance. However, what I remembered most - was how rude and aloof the staff was!Gave it another chance (a year later) , and stopped by for dinner on Tuesday evening. Hostess was sooo rude we walked out! I know this place is very popular, but really??? Don't know if the owners know that this is what guests experience-- they should.",1.0
"Still a fabulous and consistent spot in terms of service and good food.  It's like eating at home without having to think about it and cook. And I mean that as a compliment.While it is the kind of food we eat at home I find a lot of inspiration here, whether it's crisp radishes with anchovy vinaigrette or the classic meatballs (which changed my meatball life when their recipe was first published). Some meat sauces are over-salted. Personal thing?I love watching the kitchen - it's tiny, and super-efficient.The only real downside, and it is a real downer, is that it is DEAFENING. The dishes being slammed in and out of the dishwasher are the worst source of the noise, which is, I'm guessing, at dangerous decibel levels. Really, it's painful. People who bring babies here - and they do - are nuts.I am over the shouting-across-the-table thing. The bar is better than table seating in terms of noise, but make sure you sit near the door. If the acoustics were modified I'd be a regular.",4.0
"Best BLT I've ever had! I came here for brunch and figured you can't go wrong with a BLT. The bread was a flaky light crispy bread that was amazing. Normally with BLTs you get thick slices with thick crust that cuts your mouth, not this. The bacon they use in it is amazeballs. Thick cut, crispy, smoky, salty all the best things you can have. Plus they have homemade mayo on it that it excellently done. I would definitely come back for that alone! If you're stuck waiting in line for 3 hours for Buttermilk Channel come here instead.",5.0
Went today to check out place for possible Easter brunch with friends but the hostess left me with a bad taste in my mouth and decided against it.,1.0
"Reading some of the negative reviews on here is really great for a laugh. Of course there is a 45 minute wait--the kitchen has 3 guys working on an induction stove making the most incredible food you'll ever eat!!! The wait staff is fantastic too (if you had a bad experience with them then you are probably that person who always has bad experiences at restaurants and wonders why). All in all, Frankies is one of the best restaurants in the area. The Franks have put together an AH-MAZING menu--anything you eat will be delicious but the cavatelli and the eggplant are the best. Try the prunes for dessert and you won't be disappointed  (""EW PRUNES"", you're saying to yourself, but I promise they are out of this world!)",5.0
"What annoyed me about this place was that it wouldn't accept reservations for smaller groups. My friend tried to make a reservation for us and they didn't accept it. We ended up waiting for an hour for seats. The atmosphere didn't disappoint. It was dim in a romantic sort of way and it wasn't very loud. There's really not much to look at which was kind of disappointing. My friend got the meatballs which were delicious. They were nice and soft, really fluffy. (we usually share our food) I got the crab meat linguini which i found amazing. The waitress recommended it to me because it was in season :) . Their portions were also reasonable. We also got the beef sandwich. The sandwich was amazing. The bread was crispy and the beef was nice and tender. And to finish our meal off we had the creme brulee.If it weren't for the hour wait I'd give 4 stars.",3.0
"I love Frankies 457. I dare to say its my favorite Italian restaurant in all of the Empire City.Frankies, how do I love thee?Your candlelit dinners. Picnic style seating for larger parties in the backyard garden.Amazing seasonal menus. Delicious homemade pastas. House red that is so smooth and very affordable.My husband and I were treated to dinner here in their backyard years ago as a wedding gift. Laughing with friends, having delicious food, being stunned by their homemade olive oil: all these memories made this place special.Now that rediscovered Frankies, years later, the food, this place is just as magical. We frequently start with a carafe of their house red, then working our way through appetizers, salads and pastas. Last night we started with one sweet pea crostini. Yes its single serving, yes its 4 dollars but it was perfect crisp, sweet and unique.Their salads are so simple yet delicious. Perfect blend of acid and sweet. Roasted beets with avocado is a good bet. For entrees we ordered cavatelli with hot sausage and slow roasted rib-eye with arugula, red onion and pecorino. The cavatelli was al dente; the rib-eye perfectly seasoned, was moist, medium rare and I couldn't get enough of the arugula salad. The vinaigrette on the arugula was sharp and perfectly cut into the marbled richness of the rib-eye. I love a romantic date night here and I love the affordability of their meals.

"3.5 stars. Usually a great place, with solid food. But my most recent experience takes the rating down a bit.Went here for dinner and got seated in the outside garden. The setting is lovely, intimate, and great for a date. Unfortunately, it's also mosquito-ridden, to the point where I was using my napkin to cover my legs for extra protection. A family seated near me had actually brought their own mosquito repellent - smart move.We ordered the anchovy crostini and the mushroom and truffle oil crostini to start. Both of them were delicious, the anchovy being the favorite. We chose the pork braciola and a linguini with marinara and crab for our entrees. The entrees took forever to come out. I'm pretty sure that it was due to the party that they were hosting in the back room. I get it, but it really was to the detriment of the other customers. Still, I would have been okay with the wait if the dishes had been good. Sadly, the linguini and crab was extremely bland, surprising for Frankie's usual standards. The red sauce had almost no flavor and the crab seemed a bit mushy. The pork was pretty tasty, but both dishes were served lukewarm, which was very unappetizing.It took an equally long time to flag down our server to pay our bill.

"The staff here has always been nice... They're always busy but there's this one time  when we wanted to sit at the bar but since even the bar area was packed we decided to just go somewhere else. The host came up to us and offered to call us as soon as 2 seats at the bar area becomes available. So we went next door (Prime Meats-owned by the same owner of Frankie's 457 by the way :) ) and had a couple of drinks while we waited. A few minutes later they called us and off we went!Hubby and I have been at this cozy restaurant numerous times and the food has always been delish!We've tried some of the dishes on their menu and so far we've never been disappointed.Their roasted beets and avocado salad was good. I never thought avocado and roasted beets mixed with balsamic vinegar would go well together but I was mistaken. Their cheese and melt in your mouth meat plate and marinated olives are also good. We even ended up buying a jar of olives to give to my sister in law.  They have an extensive wine list and as for their beer selection, I would say ""ehh"". Nothing to be excited about.My two favorite dishes on  the menu is their delicious house-made Cavatelli with Faiccos Hot Sausage and Browned Sage Butter. It's not too spicy but it definitely has a little kick to it. Their pasta was cooked perfectly.Pork Braciola Marinara was amazing. I urge you to try it!My husband had Mozzarella Tomato and Red Pepper sandwich which was fresh and satisfying.He also had the Eggplant Parmesan which was cooked to perfection. And he swears by their House Made Gnocchi Marinara and Fresh Ricotta. It was simple but definitely a favorite! For dessert we had their Chocolate Tart and Ricotta Cheesecake which was fresh and creamy. They have the best olive oil I've ever had in any restaurant...ever!",4.0
"OH MAH GOODNESS! Just found my favorite Italian place in history!Came here once because of a Buzzfeed article and thank goodness, cause I am hooked. Decided to come back here to celebrate a 6 year anniversary and this place did not fail.First of all this place is tiny and there is no wait space. Best time to dine here is an early dinner. The wait can be 30-45 minutes even when it is not busy. Gave my phone number and they were able to call when the table was ready. Points already! You can wait across the street at a bar, but knowing I am going to spend about $50 for myself, waiting in the car is just as good. Service here is great. Bread + Olive Oil is delicious. Food comes at a great pace even though their kitchen is tiny! They are doing some serious work in there.What I ate twice and what you should at least eat once:Tiramisu - can't even describe it. Just order it and eat it.Braised Octopus with Dandelion Greens - something about this salad is awesome. Their dressing for the salad is even great when you sop it up with their bread!Beef Waygu Special - this was a special and I am so sad it is not a constant dish. Beef was so good. I want to order this the next time I am there. Our waitress was selling it too and no wonder she was. It is so damn good.It was good once, but I don't think I would order it again:Cavatelli - first time having cavatelli pasta and I don't think I am a fan.Sweet Potato and Sage Ravioli in Parmesan Broth - good but I couldn't eat the bowl to myself. Very strong flavors. Definitely try it, but I would share this plate as it can be overwhelming.Meatballs - good, but nothing special here for me.Overall, one of my favorite restaurants. Can't wait to find another excuse to come here again.",5.0
"A cozy restaurant, with an open kitchen that you walk by as you enter and aromas of roasted garlic and butter sage sauce fill up the restaurant.Their signature meat balls are well made with ingredients like pine nuts and raisins inside, along with a rich red sauce and on fresh bread.I unfortunately ordered a linguine with shrimp and fresh peas. I would have preferred by friend's pappardelle and lamb dish, which was actually made with fresh pasta.",4.0
"This was the first time going out for New Years in a very long time. New Year, New Love and a New Restaurant to bring it all in. I have been wanting to go to Frankie's since I read about him in magazine about 2 years ago.  I saw on his website that he had a 4 course Prix fix menu and to email for reservations. I got a phone call back and poof it was that simple! I was super excited. We left super early thinking parking would be an issue and it wasn't.  Great start to the night!! Upon walking in, the bar was hopping and loud but not to crazy busy.  The  bar is to the right and a little bit further back is the open kitchen and a bunch of tables. The restaurant is brick and simple very homey and has a great italian feel. We were greeted by a super nice hostesses.  Our table was waiting for us so She brought us all the way to the back. Cool we are out of the way of the chaos. Then OMG she walks out the back door!! Shit all im thinking about is that we are going to be in a  heated white tent but no, we walk past a wood fire and into another beautiful brick building with wood beams decorated with dim lighting, huge big balloons, soft music it was so romantic. Just what I imagined my night would be. We sat down  away from most people and took in somewhat the quiet romantic atmosphere. They poured us a glass of prosecco and we looked at the menu. Let me tell you up front The food was spectacular.  The Amuse Bouche was sausage over lentils. It was quite a large portion. The sausage Tasted like a beef and veal combo that was pan seared to perfection over beautiful tender lentils. I really liked it. First course I order was the beef carpaccio and he got the poached egg with polenta. The beef was thinly sliced with an arugula salad topped with Parmesan on top. The peppery notes of the salad went well with saltiness of the cheese and meat. It had a great olive oil on top. What a great dish. I tasted the poached egg dish unfortunately the egg was a little over done and the polenta was not at the right consistency this dish was a miss. It still tasted good but not what we expected. We weren't able to express this because our waitress was no where to be found. Second course I had the wild mushroom cannelloni and he had the handmade pici with lamb ragu. The cannelloni was great great flavor sauce was so good. I wish i had bread to dip in the sauce. The stand out was the pici dish. The handmade macaroni was outstanding and the lamb ragu nothing i ever tasted, very rich and hardy. I would have gotten that as my main meal. Third course i ordered the duo of pork and he ordered osso bucco. My god i wish they gave me more of my dish!! It was so freakin good!! The crispy pork skin and the Parmesan escarole was so good I couldn't stop eating it. This was a home run!! The osso bucco was delicious but very heavy for another tomato sauce based dish. It did have great flavor and the meat fell right off the bone. My bf loved it. Fourth course we ordered Molton peanut butter cake and the bread pudding.  Both wear good and hit the spot. Although they were extremely very heavy. I would have loved a pie option.  :) Dinner was fabulous. Ambience above what I was expecting. Unfortunately I was a little upset with the wait staff not being around much and a rowdy patron that was just be annoying because of her drunkiness. The night was 10 stars. :) I would come back for dinner on a reg night.",5.0
"I wanted to give it 2.5 stars.Let's just do this in chronological order;Cute little spot, very romantic date looking. If it wasn't such a humid night out, we might have sat outside instead of in.Took awhile for a hostess to show up, once she did, she asked us to wait for another minute before seating us. But then again, in a place that looks that busy, we'd have to wait for a table to open. The menus are hard to read with nothing more than a mini candle to read them by, and it's an annoyingly pretentious menu.The food is overpriced, $19 for a 1/4"" slice of cold steak. The ravioli was delicious, but more like a child's size, and again over priced.  Our server was pretty knowledgeable about the menu. It seemed loud when we first arrived but once we were seated, we were able to hold a convo easily.I don't hate it, but I doubt I'd go back due to the lack of menu items I like, tiny portions and the pricing.I like the incandescent bulbs with freestyle looking filaments. The decor overall was simple, but nice.Shame, most places these days, in this nabe have crappy food, terrible service, etc. Bigger portions and lower prices would make this place an easy 4-5 stars.",3.0
"So I first heard of this place through Zagat, and I've had this bookmarked on Yelp forever. I finally had the opportunity to go since I had to go to the Brooklyn Ikea, needless to say I was super excited. I never realized how small the inside was, but it is very romantic. It's a great date spot,  I love the vibe and decor, it's definitely 100% hipster. The outside garden looked great as well, it was jamming out there. The service was too lackluster for me, kinda on the slower, unattentive, ""I don't give a shit about you"" side.The food:Sweet Potato and Sage Ravioli in a Parmesan Broth- easily my fav thing of the night. The ravioli was excellent and the broth superb. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Eggplant Caponata Crostini- not the most appealing looking dish, actually it's down right ugly. But it tasted so good, it did have an unexpected kick though. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Meatballs with Pine Nuts and Raisins- this is definitely a combo of beef and something else, the pine nuts added a slight crunch and the raisins were surprisingly good. The tomato sauce they used was excellent. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Gnocchi Marinara with Fresh Ricotta- I really wanted to love this dish. The gnocchi were incredibly light and airy but the marinara really bothered me a lot. So much that I had to put some of the tomato sauce from the meatballs to help this dish. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Dessert- ordered the Chocolate Tart and Ricotta Cheesecake and I wasn't really crazy about either. The Chocolate Tart was so dense like fudge and tasted like something out of a supermarket. The Cheesecake was dry, it had a slight lemon taste to it and the flavors were nice but so dry. yelp.com/user_local_phot…yelp.com/user_local_phot…Cocktails- Both the Frankies Ice tea and Sardegna Sour were really good. Both of them were very refreshing and ""Holy shit I am so wasted good."" You don't really feel the alcohol until you get up, I liked the Ice tea best though.",4.0

"I'm really confused about all the hype. I've been to a ton of cheap to 4-star Italian places in NYC and this place is very average, over priced. I've not returned since I went for a Christmas dinner last year. Also, the waiter was very absent and clearly did not care about us.",2.0
"I respect this place- but that's about it.I was one of those groupies that got lure into checking this place after seeing the series ""Being Frank"" on vice TV - a munchies special about the owners, Frank Castronovo and Frank Falcinelli.Together they also opened Prime Meat, Frankie 570, Cafe Pedlar and RES.Both owners are high profile social elitest of the culinary industry with well respected resumes. With that said- My overall experience felt flat from my expectation.  The service staffs were great but waiting 45 minutes for a table was almost not worth it.  The ingredients were FRESH but i didn't see much technique or anything out of the ordinary. The Crostini and Pasta was authentic, comforting and good.  The sauce accompanied with the pork shoulder tasted like watery tomato juice.  The pork was just mediocre- its slowed cooked and taste a bit like bland carnitas. What bugs me was the high prices, its definitely costly for a ""casual"" Brooklyn place.  Wne/Beer is about $12/glass and dishes are average $20 for a small portion.  Its Manhattan prices.I do want to give the Franks' another chance and remain curious to visit their other locations but I probably won't be signing up for another 45 minutes wait to eat here again.",3.0
"What an amazing dinner! I started with the dandelion and octopus salad (killer) and then proceeded to pick at my husband's caesar dressing salad (can I get that dressing in a bottle to go please?). The sweet sausage was equally delicious. Great wine. My husband ordered the Friday special, pork shoulder wrapped over cheese and oh wow, it was incredible. Must must return to sample the meatballs, the constant waves of delicious food coming from the open kitchen was amazing. Next time around, I want to sit in the back garden.",4.0
"The staff here has always been nice... They're always busy but there's this one time  when we wanted to sit at the bar but since even the bar area was packed we decided to just go somewhere else. The host came up to us and offered to call us as soon as 2 seats at the bar area becomes available. So we went next door (Prime Meats-owned by the same owner of Frankie's 457 by the way :) ) and had a couple of drinks while we waited. A few minutes later they called us and off we went!Hubby and I have been at this cozy restaurant numerous times and the food has always been delish!We've tried some of the dishes on their menu and so far we've never been disappointed.Their roasted beets and avocado salad was good. I never thought avocado and roasted beets mixed with balsamic vinegar would go well together but I was mistaken. Their cheese and melt in your mouth meat plate and marinated olives are also good. We even ended up buying a jar of olives to give to my sister in law.  They have an extensive wine list and as for their beer selection, I would say ""ehh"". Nothing to be excited about.My two favorite dishes on  the menu is their delicious house-made Cavatelli with Faiccos Hot Sausage and Browned Sage Butter. It's not too spicy but it definitely has a little kick to it. Their pasta was cooked perfectly.Pork Braciola Marinara was amazing. I urge you to try it!My husband had Mozzarella Tomato and Red Pepper sandwich which was fresh and satisfying.He also had the Eggplant Parmesan which was cooked to perfection. And he swears by their House Made Gnocchi Marinara and Fresh Ricotta. It was simple but definitely a favorite! For dessert we had their Chocolate Tart and Ricotta Cheesecake which was fresh and creamy. They have the best olive oil I've ever had in any restaurant...ever!",4.0
"OH MAH GOODNESS! Just found my favorite Italian place in history!Came here once because of a Buzzfeed article and thank goodness, cause I am hooked. Decided to come back here to celebrate a 6 year anniversary and this place did not fail.First of all this place is tiny and there is no wait space. Best time to dine here is an early dinner. The wait can be 30-45 minutes even when it is not busy. Gave my phone number and they were able to call when the table was ready. Points already! You can wait across the street at a bar, but knowing I am going to spend about $50 for myself, waiting in the car is just as good. Service here is great. Bread + Olive Oil is delicious. Food comes at a great pace even though their kitchen is tiny! They are doing some serious work in there.What I ate twice and what you should at least eat once:Tiramisu - can't even describe it. Just order it and eat it.Braised Octopus with Dandelion Greens - something about this salad is awesome. Their dressing for the salad is even great when you sop it up with their bread!Beef Waygu Special - this was a special and I am so sad it is not a constant dish. Beef was so good. I want to order this the next time I am there. Our waitress was selling it too and no wonder she was. It is so damn good.It was good once, but I don't think I would order it again:Cavatelli - first time having cavatelli pasta and I don't think I am a fan.Sweet Potato and Sage Ravioli in Parmesan Broth - good but I couldn't eat the bowl to myself. Very strong flavors. Definitely try it, but I would share this plate as it can be overwhelming.Meatballs - good, but nothing special here for me.Overall, one of my favorite restaurants. Can't wait to find another excuse to come here again.",5.0
"A cozy restaurant, with an open kitchen that you walk by as you enter and aromas of roasted garlic and butter sage sauce fill up the restaurant.Their signature meat balls are well made with ingredients like pine nuts and raisins inside, along with a rich red sauce and on fresh bread.I unfortunately ordered a linguine with shrimp and fresh peas. I would have preferred by friend's pappardelle and lamb dish, which was actually made with fresh pasta.",4.0
"This was the first time going out for New Years in a very long time. New Year, New Love and a New Restaurant to bring it all in. I have been wanting to go to Frankie's since I read about him in magazine about 2 years ago.  I saw on his website that he had a 4 course Prix fix menu and to email for reservations. I got a phone call back and poof it was that simple! I was super excited. We left super early thinking parking would be an issue and it wasn't.  Great start to the night!! Upon walking in, the bar was hopping and loud but not to crazy busy.  The  bar is to the right and a little bit further back is the open kitchen and a bunch of tables. The restaurant is brick and simple very homey and has a great italian feel. We were greeted by a super nice hostesses.  Our table was waiting for us so She brought us all the way to the back. Cool we are out of the way of the chaos. Then OMG she walks out the back door!! Shit all im thinking about is that we are going to be in a  heated white tent but no, we walk past a wood fire and into another beautiful brick building with wood beams decorated with dim lighting, huge big balloons, soft music it was so romantic.

We basically split three dishes, the pork braciola marinara (available only Thursday-Sunday), the gnocchi marinara with fresh ricotto, and the cavatelli with hot sausage in a browned sage butter. I'm glad we got the dishes we did because the pillowy gnocchi really went well with the tender fall apart pork braciola and vise versa, getting one without the other would have seemed like something was missing.

"Decent dinner spot in Brooklyn, but not sure it's worth all the hype.Came on a weeknight for dinner w/ coworkers. The wait wasn't long which was a huge plus. We ordered eggplant parmigiana and buffala mozzarella to start. I'm not usually a big fan of eggplant but this dish was beyond tasty. There was lots of flavor and texture- esp. for a vegetarian dish. The mozza was very plain, kind of fell flat for a soft cheese.I ordered the appetizer sliced rib-eye for my main since I wasn't that hungry. The portion was definitely appetizer sized (small). Though the meat had good flavor, they were a bit heavy on the salt. I'm usually a fan of lots of sodium but I would bite into chunks of salt while eating which was slightly uncomfortable. My biggest problem w/ the dish was that the cut didn't seem like ribeye at all. I'm positive I was served prime rib, which I honestly enjoyed. But I was expecting a different taste and texture when I ordered a rib eye.Anyways, Frankies has a very classic NYC restaurant ambiance. I'll give it the novelty of being a ""classic"" NYC establishment. However, I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here based on the food alone.",3.0

"I have been here 3 times, and it was about time I left a review. I will start by saying some of the experiences and items I have had at this restaurant are 5 star, while others were more like a 2 star experience. It was hard to integrate my experiences into a single review, but here is what I came up with.My first time here was during the summer. The restaurant and backyard are beautiful, smoothly lit, and intimate. This place is cute and has sex appeal. Everyone inside is SUPER nice, wait staff and bar staff are quick to great you, and both the diners and staff are smiley. This place has none of that aire of snobbery that I had sort of grown accustom to when dining at similarly priced establishments in other neighborhoods (+1 for Carroll Gardens). I have been back 2 times since, late summer and early fall. The attitude, courtesy, and friendliness of the staff is consistently good; to me this means that management is doing something right.Each time I have dined with my girlfriend and we have had a variety of dishes here; a couple seasonal/special pastas, a handful of the crostinis, a couple salads, nearly all the listed cocktails, and a few glasses of wine we have also tried 3 of the deserts.I had a cavatelli with a clean butter based sauce tossed with summer peas and it was awesome, the peas were fresh and crisp and the pasta was perfectly cooked, al-dente, and I could actually appreciate the taste of the pasta.I also had a vegetable bolognese w/ fettucine. This was not so good, the pasta was way overcooked, and the vegetable bolognese had none of the cooked-for-such-a-long-time-that-all-the-flavors-meld-together character that sort of defines a bolognese. However in their usual fashion the waitress was super good and noticed we didn't like the dish and offered to bring us something else, but since we had already started on it, we declined to swap out the dishes.Watercress and fig salad at the end of the summer with figs in season was delicious, simple, and fresh; it may not have warranted its price but it was good.The crostinis have mostly been a good experience. The eggplant caponata is mind blowingly good, its sweet, and sour, and spicy and has a velvety texture and is really good. The fig was also really good and also had that sweet and savory dual play. The truffle and cremini mushroom was mediocre and didn't have the bang I would have expected from truffles and was actually quite muted when compared to the other crostinis.Every drink I have had here has been GOOD. The house red is good and the tiramisu, and seasonal deserts have never disappointed.I will continue to come back here but it is expensive enough that it is usually saved for a special night out.",4.0

"Frankies has been one of my favorite restaurant since it first opened.  But after tonight I will not go back.  It is a Monday night and the place had at least 5 empty tables and no one waiting.   I was with my husband and elderly mother and we were waiting for our daughter to join us.  The hostess was incredibly rude and not welcoming.  She explained that she could not seat us until we had all of our people.  I completely understand that policy on a busy night when space is tight, but when there are empty tables why not seat your customers and offer them wine or a drink?  She was going to have to give us a 4 top anyway.  When I asked nicely if she would just let us sit down she rudely insisted that the policy was the policy.  The issue for me is not the policy but the tone and the rudeness. This is not Manhattan on a Thursday night.  This is a sleepy neighborhood in Brooklyn on a Monday night.  Even if she had just said, why don't you sit down in the front and enjoy a class of wine while you wait, I would have been pleased to do so.  I did speak with the manager who I am sure felt like she had to support the rude hostess and the policy.  Fine.  We went down the street to one of the other amazing restaurants in the area and had terrific meal.  They were happy to seat us and we ordered a round of drinks while we waited for my daughter to get there.  In the end we spent over $300.  So, if Frankies can afford to lose a loyal customer and a $300 table on a Monday night, then I guess it has gotten too swanky for my blood and I am happy to take my business and encourage others to do the same and patronize the other terrific places that are emerging in that neighborhood",1.0

"Out of towner visiting for about a week. I are at Frankie's 3 times. This place is amazing!! The food is delicious. The bar is fantastic. The staff is knowledgeable and extremely friendly. You feel apart of a family going in there. The first meal I had was the cavatelli. It was perfectly cooked- homemade pasta at its finest. The bar tender paired a wine which fit perfectly. Second time I had the lamb pasta dish, Caesar salad, tirimisu and creme brûlée. It was the best meal I've ever had in my life. The lamb melted in your mouth and the creme brûlée could not have been better. I would absolutely urge you to spend time at Frankie's while you are in Carroll gardens. Our server in particular was extremely friendly and not to mention beautiful. Ask for Megan if you want some hard working eye candy :)",5.0
"Everything we tried was pretty good! Crimini and truffle oil crostini and the marscapone special crostini were both tasty but they served it cold. I'm not sure if they usually do but obviously it would taste better hot. Saffron linguine with clams was really delicious. Light yet flavorful. Lots of clams. Parpadelle with lamb was pretty good too. Can't go wrong with homemade pasta!The special red velvet cake was the best thing! It had cream cheese filling and a hard chocolate shell around the cake. The cake could've been more moist but there were some berries and sauce underneath to make up for it. It would've been 5 stars if the crostinis were at least warm... Also, my husband left the restaurant still kind of hungry! Entree portions are smaller than other places definitely!",4.0

"I have been here 3 times, and it was about time I left a review. I will start by saying some of the experiences and items I have had at this restaurant are 5 star, while others were more like a 2 star experience. It was hard to integrate my experiences into a single review, but here is what I came up with.My first time here was during the summer. The restaurant and backyard are beautiful, smoothly lit, and intimate. This place is cute and has sex appeal. Everyone inside is SUPER nice, wait staff and bar staff are quick to great you, and both the diners and staff are smiley. This place has none of that aire of snobbery that I had sort of grown accustom to when dining at similarly priced establishments in other neighborhoods (+1 for Carroll Gardens). I have been back 2 times since, late summer and early fall. The attitude, courtesy, and friendliness of the staff is consistently good; to me this means that management is doing something right.Each time I have dined with my girlfriend and we have had a variety of dishes here; a couple seasonal/special pastas, a handful of the crostinis, a couple salads, nearly all the listed cocktails, and a few glasses of wine we have also tried 3 of the deserts.I had a cavatelli with a clean butter based sauce tossed with summer peas and it was awesome, the peas were fresh and crisp and the pasta was perfectly cooked, al-dente, and I could actually appreciate the taste of the pasta.I also had a vegetable bolognese w/ fettucine. This was not so good, the pasta was way overcooked, and the vegetable bolognese had none of the cooked-for-such-a-long-time-that-all-the-flavors-meld-together character that sort of defines a bolognese. However in their usual fashion the waitress was super good and noticed we didn't like the dish and offered to bring us something else, but since we had already started on it, we declined to swap out the dishes.Watercress and fig salad at the end of the summer with figs in season was delicious, simple, and fresh; it may not have warranted its price but it was good.The crostinis have mostly been a good experience. The eggplant caponata is mind blowingly good, its sweet, and sour, and spicy and has a velvety texture and is really good. The fig was also really good and also had that sweet and savory dual play. The truffle and cremini mushroom was mediocre and didn't have the bang I would have expected from truffles and was actually quite muted when compared to the other crostinis.Every drink I have had here has been GOOD.

We regrettably had to wave down whoever we could for fresh pepper, hot pepper flakes, coffee, AND the check all the while the restaurant was pretty empty. Im not asking for a red carpet rolled out and extreme attention but it's not very hard to do the simple steps of waiting a table. 2 out of the 4 of us are in the industry and STILL couldnt think of any reason to leave over 20% which is sad because it's good to treat those in the same position.

The cavatelli earned high marks, as did the eggplant and the polenta. The eggplant was notably small, however, compared to what an order of eggplant normally gets you around here. Nothing was especially bad about the meal, but nothing was great enough to make me come back. If you're not from around here, it's almost certainly not worth the trip or the wait.",3.0

"Love the food and back garden at Frankie's.  My husband and I checked this place out on Memorial Day weekend, a time that can be really tricky for restaurants.  Usual staff is gone, chaos can reign.  But everything was polished and, well, delicious on the Monday we went.  Lovely pasta with rabbit and olives, delicious fennel salad. Late lunch in the garden is worth taking a long break for - it's really gorgeous back there.  Plus, they seem to allow dogs.  I'd give them a five but I didn't love the tiramisu we had for dessert - how can you serve bland tiramisu in Carroll Gardens?  I can totally see the chef here thinking,"" we have to do tiramisu, but - ugh!"" and just phoning it in.  I'd like to see these guys reinvent it - I'm sure they could.",4.0
"RUDEST SERVICE EVER! Our server, Emily, had all the charm and poise of an overworked TSA agent. Rude and impatient from the get-go, she could barely be bothered to wait for us to open our menus and read her our orders, immediately snapping at us - ""Are you guys ready yet!? Are you sure!?""  This treatment after we waited an hour and a half for our table. I can understand getting in the weeds during a rush, but there are ways to handle it. Of course, she managed to forget our wine order in all her hurry, but that's the least of it. Throughout our meal, Emily continued to go way over the edge with her passive-aggressive behavior, never trying to hide her frustration or sarcasm. The pedantic tone, the eye-rolls - it's as if she were playing to some studio audience that only she could see, cracking them up with her whole ""can you believe these rubes? they have a question about the menu!"" schtick. But her lowest point was probably when she chose put a place setting on the table by thrusting it right past my face as I tried to converse with my companion, missing me by an inch or two, without any warning. By the time our meals arrived, we just wanted to shovel our food down and get away from this unbelievably obnoxious person. We all breathed a sigh of relief as we exited Frankie's, transported back to the Carroll Gardens we know and love from this Times Square-style tourist trap. And with all the money we saved on tips, we finally got that bottle of wine - at one of the neighborhood's many more reputable establishments.",1.0

We went and got drinks elsewhere, and we came back when we got the text that our table was ready. We chatted with the hostess and started following her back to the table. We were then snapped at by ANOTHER woman because they needed an extra minute to wipe down the table, and they wanted us to wait in the front area. If the hostess said this, we honestly did not hear it, and was that really worthy of being snapped at again?!We wound up leaving because after being snapped at by TWO separate people, we just did not feel right giving them our business. I was extremely disappointed, as we just moved to the area, and we planned on this being a regular spot. Everyone in this neighborhood has been friendly and wonderful, except for the people here.

"I drank too much wine, ate too much pasta, and ordered too many desserts.  That's the kind of place Frankie's 457 is; an over-the-top explosion of excess, bleeding Brooklyn charm.The cavatelli is as good as everyone says, a giant mess of sage and butter and fat coins of hot sausage enrobing the morish pasta.  The octopus and dandelion salad is exactly the perfect appetizer, an offsetting dance of meaty cephalopod andlightly marinated green olives.   The sausage and polenta tastes as if one upended the platonic ideal of fairground sausage and onions over a buttery pool of corn.  None of these things is sophisticated or fancy.  They're just ridiculously good.NB: I also enjoyed my $13 half liter of house wine.  No, it's not the best wine, but it was decent wine at the best price.",5.0
"This used to be my and my bf's favorite neighborhood place when this was my neighborhood. Then something happened....would never go back. Holiday weekend, headed over to other side of Brooklyn, happy to go to our place. Walked in and looked for host/hostess. Two guys leaning against wall by bathroom, talking, apparently one was the host who then scoffed at me and pretended to take my number down. I broke the rules by not realizing the people who ignored us and made no move towards us in a service-type way and for that we were told there was an hour wait, then ignored some more and skipped over while three two-tops came in right behind us. We didn't stay waiting outside after the last walked in and was seated. We just left, shocked. I could probably list the menu, we've had so many great meals here, over years. Have brought friends, family, out of owners, was our place. But there's no excuse for this behavior. For a neighborhood place, the last thing you need is rude staff and attitude. Apparently, success has gone to their heads. Shame. Still pisses me off just thinking about the snide look he shot me before dismissing us. Unbelievable.",1.0
"Since the algorithm decided that my first review would not show here, I thought I should try writing another review that will show up.My now-husband and I had a horrible experience at Frankie's on the night we got married at City Hall.  We were first told the wait was 45 minutes.  We were relaxed, drank a bottle of wine on the patio and chatted away.  But we were not seated until 1.5 hours had gone by.  When we were finally sitting at a table, the server was so incredibly rude and inattentive that even after waiting for so long already, we got up and left.  If I wait for 1.5 hours for a table, I expect a certain level of kindness and service from waitstaff.  No food in the world is worth that kind of attitude.We ended up going to Brucie, got a table right away, had an extremely delicious meal, served by extremely friendly people, and cannot wait to return.",1.0
"This place completely killed it, amazing meal. The server was super friendly and attentive, and answered all of our questions with aplomb. We started out with the Anitpasto, which rocked. I usually don't get excited by slices of italian meat, but the prosciutto practically melts in your mouth. Next up came the Stracciatella, which was out of this world. The beat salad was also pretty rad, I didn't think roast beats could possibly taste like that. For the main I did the Cavatelli, which was cooked perfectly and came with what might be one of the best italian sausages I've ever tried. The meatballs were also great -- they do have raisins which was kind of different but totally worked. We tried a few deserts, and of those, the ricotta cheesecake was the star. The others were great, but not terribly memorable or different. Oh, and when you are done here, you can top off your night with a cocktail next door at Prime Meats.I would dock half a star for the beer selection, if I could. Nothing amazing, nothing really local (Sixpoint brewery is a twenty minute walk from here, get some of those on draft!).",5.0
"The food is pretty darn good. Lots of fresh, high quality ingredients. Have really enjoyed food in the past. Also, prices seem fair for Italian pricing in NYC.The atmosphere is nice, quaint, and the outdoor space is actually pretty large, which is good for bigger parties, because the inside space is pretty narrow.Now to the only negative, with a story:Recently was placed in a really bad seat, against the wall, with one of the pillars that stuck out, preventing the chair from being moved back appropriately from the table, and was literally crammed in. It was just too uncomfortable to stay seated, so we asked to change (an annoying question for the waitstaff, I know, but why pay for an uncomfortable experience?) We were told to wait until a new one freed up. So we waited.20 minutes passed, two other parties of 2 were then seated before us, who arrived after we did, while the wait continued for a new table to open up. Eventually, we gave up and left. Probably won't be back for a while, at least not during dinner hours on the same night, with the same self-entitled hipster staff. Everyone know's the service industry isn't easy when you're popular, but at least don't leave customers pissed off and uncomfortable when they're paying for a good experience.",3.0

We went and got drinks elsewhere, and we came back when we got the text that our table was ready. We chatted with the hostess and started following her back to the table. We were then snapped at by ANOTHER woman because they needed an extra minute to wipe down the table, and they wanted us to wait in the front area. If the hostess said this, we honestly did not hear it, and was that really worthy of being snapped at again?!We wound up leaving because after being snapped at by TWO separate people, we just did not feel right giving them our business. I was extremely disappointed, as we just moved to the area, and we planned on this being a regular spot. Everyone in this neighborhood has been friendly and wonderful, except for the people here. Probably will not give this place another try, but Prime Meats next door was excellent!",1.0
I give 5 star for the food and waiting line I wasn't happy with they told us 20min till we get seated almost 45 min I will Def come by again during the week not on weekend,2.0
"I drank too much wine, ate too much pasta, and ordered too many desserts.  That's the kind of place Frankie's 457 is; an over-the-top explosion of excess, bleeding Brooklyn charm.The cavatelli is as good as everyone says, a giant mess of sage and butter and fat coins of hot sausage enrobing the morish pasta.  The octopus and dandelion salad is exactly the perfect appetizer, an offsetting dance of meaty cephalopod andlightly marinated green olives.   The sausage and polenta tastes as if one upended the platonic ideal of fairground sausage and onions over a buttery pool of corn.  None of these things is sophisticated or fancy.  They're just ridiculously good.NB: I also enjoyed my $13 half liter of house wine.  No, it's not the best wine, but it was decent wine at the best price.",5.0
"This used to be my and my bf's favorite neighborhood place when this was my neighborhood. Then something happened....would never go back. Holiday weekend, headed over to other side of Brooklyn, happy to go to our place. Walked in and looked for host/hostess. Two guys leaning against wall by bathroom, talking, apparently one was the host who then scoffed at me and pretended to take my number down. I broke the rules by not realizing the people who ignored us and made no move towards us in a service-type way and for that we were told there was an hour wait, then ignored some more and skipped over while three two-tops came in right behind us. We didn't stay waiting outside after the last walked in and was seated. We just left, shocked. I could probably list the menu, we've had so many great meals here, over years. Have brought friends, family, out of owners, was our place. But there's no excuse for this behavior. For a neighborhood place, the last thing you need is rude staff and attitude. Apparently, success has gone to their heads. Shame. Still pisses me off just thinking about the snide look he shot me before dismissing us. Unbelievable.",1.0
"Since the algorithm decided that my first review would not show here, I thought I should try writing another review that will show up.My now-husband and I had a horrible experience at Frankie's on the night we got married at City Hall.  We were first told the wait was 45 minutes.  We were relaxed, drank a bottle of wine on the patio and chatted away.  But we were not seated until 1.5 hours had gone by.  When we were finally sitting at a table, the server was so incredibly rude and inattentive that even after waiting for so long already, we got up and left.  If I wait for 1.5 hours for a table, I expect a certain level of kindness and service from waitstaff.  No food in the world is worth that kind of attitude.We ended up going to Brucie, got a table right away, had an extremely delicious meal, served by extremely friendly people, and cannot wait to return.",1.0
"This place completely killed it, amazing meal. The server was super friendly and attentive, and answered all of our questions with aplomb. We started out with the Anitpasto, which rocked. I usually don't get excited by slices of italian meat, but the prosciutto practically melts in your mouth. Next up came the Stracciatella, which was out of this world. The beat salad was also pretty rad, I didn't think roast beats could possibly taste like that. For the main I did the Cavatelli, which was cooked perfectly and came with what might be one of the best italian sausages I've ever tried. The meatballs were also great -- they do have raisins which was kind of different but totally worked. We tried a few deserts, and of those, the ricotta cheesecake was the star. The others were great, but not terribly memorable or different. Oh, and when you are done here, you can top off your night with a cocktail next door at Prime Meats.I would dock half a star for the beer selection, if I could. Nothing amazing, nothing really local (Sixpoint brewery is a twenty minute walk from here, get some of those on draft!).",5.0
"The food is pretty darn good. Lots of fresh, high quality ingredients. Have really enjoyed food in the past. Also, prices seem fair for Italian pricing in NYC.The atmosphere is nice, quaint, and the outdoor space is actually pretty large, which is good for bigger parties, because the inside space is pretty narrow.Now to the only negative, with a story:Recently was placed in a really bad seat, against the wall, with one of the pillars that stuck out, preventing the chair from being moved back appropriately from the table, and was literally crammed in. It was just too uncomfortable to stay seated, so we asked to change (an annoying question for the waitstaff, I know, but why pay for an uncomfortable experience?) We were told to wait until a new one freed up. So we waited.20 minutes passed, two other parties of 2 were then seated before us, who arrived after we did, while the wait continued for a new table to open up. Eventually, we gave up and left. Probably won't be back for a while, at least not during dinner hours on the same night, with the same self-entitled hipster staff. Everyone know's the service industry isn't easy when you're popular, but at least don't leave customers pissed off and uncomfortable when they're paying for a good experience.",3.0
"If you have your own job, you probably will feel uncomfortable in the jungle of beards and thick rimmed glasses. First the waitress spilled olive oil on the table, walked away and ignored it as it dripped onto my suit pants. The bread was incredibly burnt and cold. I do not know how they allowed it to be served. A favorite dish of mine is escarole and beans. I ordered it - asking if they could request the chef to make the portion larger and with a lot of garlic and escarole (and that I would pay an entree price) - she told me this would be impossible, which is unheard of at any nice Italian restaurant. Escarole and bean was watery and all the escarole fit in one spoonful. It was mostly broth... Which is exactly what I did not want. No garlic in anything.

"Hands down the best meatball parmigiana I've ever (and I mean EVER) had. The meatballs are innnncredible! I can't even explain it.

Plus, the pasta is homemade. Even better!Plus, the $6 Frankie Red house wine is really really good. The day was perfect so the outside backyard seating was very nice.

Huge windows and skylights, long communal tables...and a LOT more elbow room. The front of the house was jammed, and I was secretly very pleased were in the back portion to enjoy our meal. Very cozy, and would be lovely for a private party (I'm not sure if they do this, but would inquire!). Drinks: I stuck with my old favorite the Frankie's Iced Tea, still dangerous...but with a $9 price tag, you aren't going to go to town on too many of them, right? We switched to a carafe of Nebula (waitress suggestion, very good) after cocktails and were quite pleased. Starters: Fennel Salad: wonderfully fresh and spunky! Everything julienned, finished with pecorino. So fresh and so clean clean. Mixed Green salad: standard, but also extremely fresh. Me: Sweet potato ravioli in parmesan broth. Be still my Bavarian-food laden heart, this hit the spot like a ton of bricks. IN a good way. Perfectly portioned, it was more like a sweet potato dumpling soup. Wonderful. Truly, and vegetarian...! I've eaten enough sausage over the past 6 weeks to last me eons. Him: Cavatelli with sage butter and hot sausage. Not a bit existed...so I'll take that as a ""YES, very good.""

"On a short stretch of Court Street are a few good restaurants from the same chef-owner team (both with first names of Frank), of which Frankie's 457 is the first (there's also the one that crossed the river to Manhattan, Frankie's 570).  This charming sliver of a restaurant is cozy and warm.  The brick and wood interior fills quickly, a small space with closely packed tables.  There's a spacious backyard with covered seating in good weather although when it's especially warm and muggy, as it was on one of my visits, there won't be much reprieve even indoors as air conditioning is weak.  An open kitchen is located right on the restaurant floor, small, unassuming but bustling.  The staff are straightforward and efficient, if not especially warm.The food is Italian, mostly classic.  The downside is that you won't find too many culinary risks but that will be quickly forgotten by way of great execution; I've never had a disappointing dish here.Their menu offerings are simple and change periodically.  From the extensive salad list, I've enjoyed tender octopus salad tossed with dandelion greens in vinaigrette.  I've lately come to love crostinis, with that wonderful contrast between soft and crunchy textures, especially when the toppings are fresh; choosing from Frankies' list was difficult and I have many left to try.  Their cremini mushroom crostini was delicious and earthy, aptly drizzled with truffle oil.There are several cured meats and many cheeses offered, on their own, in mini-tasting platters, or as part of a house antipasto plate.  The latter is an excellent way to sample charcuterie, cheese, some vegetable antipasti, and olives.  Or order any separately; I especially like their extensive antipasti offerings, including great broccoli rabe and delicately fried cauliflower.  Their cured meats are very good, highlighted by a silky prosciutto di parma. Entrees feature pastas and classic meat dishes.  The veal meatballs, big and meltingly soft, are savory and nicely accented by raisins and pinenuts.   An appealing special of gnocchi with black kale and walnuts was tender, smooth, and delicious. A perfect finish can be had with their simple mascarpone cheese dessert smothered in red wine stewed prunes, gently sweet and slightly tart.Like Prime Meats, there are notable bartending skills; the house cocktail creations are interesting and well-made. The crisp Iggy is my favorite, redolent of bright citrus. Plenty of wines by the glass and a good basic selection of beers.Frankie's is a lovely, casual neighborhood restaurant without fanfare yet the quality of their food and drink makes it one of the better choices among many in Carroll Gardens.

"On a recent visit to Brooklyn for my brother in laws birthday we had a grand gathering at frankies. They had a prefix menu for us. Everything from the cheese and meat plates to the meat balls were fantastic, but that's not what I love most. Frankies makes a pasta that has rivaled any other pasta dish I have ever eaten. Their homemade cavatelli is by far the most succulent pasta dish you can get, the meat sauce is lovely and the bite from those little tender models of pasta is winderful. I've had pasta all over the county and this is my favorite by far. Keep up the good work, I'll be back for the cavatelli!",5.0
"I am admittedly not a big fan of Italian food but I have to say this was the best meal I had that wasn't a steak. We shared the cheese and asparagus special and marinated olives, my girlfriend had the beets and avocado salad and I had the cavatelli sausage and sage butter. The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the tequila cocktail. Great spot, definitely going back.",5.0
"I usually try to let a meal sit for a while before I tackle writing a review for it.  If it was really good OR really bad, I'll remember everything about it.  I went here last week and I can't remember a damned thing.  I remember it being a shorter wait than we were told, and I remember the staff being friendly and attentive, but other than that... *pooofffff*",3.0
"This place is a really great local spot, located in the heart of Carroll Gardens. My family and I went last night for dinner after some relatives came into town who are vegetarians and can be tough customers to please. We ordered great wine and were extremely happy with our dishes: the lemon fettuccine with vegetable bolognese, eggplant marinara, meatball sandwich, and the pasta special. All of our meals were delicious: tasty, warm and just what we needed. There were excellent options for the vegetarians among us and everyone left very full and happy. Highly recommend although go early to avoid a line!",4.0

"Been a Frankie's customer for at least 7 years.  My first experience there was when I was 24, with my cousin, a certified foodie. I've been religiously frequenting the joint since.   Nowhere, I've been has been this rock solid consistent, healthy, and fresh. The roasted vegetable salad is absurd.   Their BLT the best thing I've ever eaten. I adore the place.",5.0
"We had our rehearsal dinner at Frankies and it was almost better than our wedding the next day! We had a private room in the back, and it was beautifully decorated and the staff was hugely accommodating and lovely the day of and in the months leading up to the event. Everyone who came raved about it. And the food was tremendous! Highly recommended.",5.0

"THE HOST was a saint! - we had came after class to try to put our name down around 3pm, however the host said it should be ok and come back late. Naturally we come back ( 7pm ) the a swarm of people came while we were waiting for the others to arrive. My friend and I were nervous because ~25 people came in while we were waiting and we thought we weren't going to get seated after all. Luckily since the host remembered us, he ended up seating us right away when our whole party came since we tried coming in before. Came here on Valentines day with my 4 girl friends. We were super excited to hear that Beyonce had eating at this restaurant before...I could see in the corner of my eyes that my friend was super excited about this. However, unfortunately I don't see what he hype is all about. Here is the list of what we ordered:Almond pesto: This dish was ok, little bland, but the cheese they put on top helped bring out the flavor. You can really taste the almond, but the pesto is very light. Sweet Potato (2 orders): AMAZING x 100. This was by far the best dish we had. However I wish they could have given us more! the portions were small. This of this dish as soup dumplings but sweet potato ravioli style. (hope that gives a good visual. It is literally in broth and the texture is not like normal ravioli due to it being submerged in soup, but its VERY GOOD!Octopus salad: This was not bad, however the greens that they used for this salad were actually bitter. The octopus was cooked just right and not too chewy. sausage: this had lot of flavor, you can tell the noodles were made fresh, however if the sausage wasn't in there it would be bland.",3.0
"Excellent service, fantastic food. Our party tried the escarole salad, lentil soup, cheese plate, pasta with sausage, gnocchi, and spaghetti special. Though we were full, we tried the amazing tiramisu and topped it with Stumptown coffee. Definite recommend.",5.0
"Well I went to this place based off yelp reviews and I can't believe how disappointing my experience was.  I only write a review when the experience is super super good or super bad. The food is bland and not just my entree, my wife's entree and the appetizer, and not only was it bland but cold.  Cold pasta, yum!  The menu is so standard too.  Nothing playful or original.  I didn't know what to order cause I was so bored by my options.  The waitress acted like she could give a crap, didn't know answers to some questions and never found out for us.  The place is busy and have no idea why.  Maybe because it's close by and people settle for mediocre food.  When I go spend money at a restaurant I want it to be memorable and fun and new.  Therefor Frankie's does not make my top 3 restaurants in the area and thought it would.  They remain at:1.  The Pines(by far)2.  Battersby(Used to be great but sliding in recent visits)3.  Buttermilk Channel(Always satisfied)",1.0
"This was simply the worst. From the moment we walked in, the bar tender was cold and unhelpful. We ordered 1 dish and it took almost 50 minutes to come.

Had food there before and should have read ten signs better. Just did not get better.",1.0
"I am done with this place.  My boyfriend and I stopped by in the mid-afternoon for a couple drinks and a snack.  The place (inside and outside) was empty save for my boyfriend and I plus one other table.  The server took forever to greet us, the drinks took 15 minutes to arrive (a glass of wine and a beer) and the server was visibly annoyed that we only ordered 2 rounds of drinks and the olives.  If it were even slightly busy, I could understand it.  However, if we were not there, Mr. Server, you would have missed out on our overly generous 20% tip based on the poor service.  There are plenty of other amazing restaurants in the area with much better service (and food).",1.0

"First I would like to say the service staff is very attentive. There was not a moment I wanted for water, or felt as though I needed to flag someone down to get what I wanted. Keep up the great work FOH. As for the food... Disappointing is an understatement. We got the antipasti plate. The meats were ok, but nothing memorable. The broccoli rabe was under-seasoned, and the two cheeses were sad. Parmesan was dry and the second cheese tastes like bad American Swiss. The cavatelli boasted brown butter but in the end it just tastes greasy. The pappardelle noodle was well made, but it came in not a sauce but rather a broth, which was rather bland. The saving grace of the meal were decent meatballs and polenta. I have avoided creating a yelp account for so long but I thought this was a dining experience I needed to share. It's unfortunate that Frankie's is taking up so much real estate in NYC with mediocre food, when there are so many establishments doing amazing food that get no attention. Please Frankie, either get better or move your franchise out of a city that knows good food.",2.0
"Had lunch with my husband and a friend here earlier today.  Everything was delicious and the service was great.  My only complaint is that the space is tight and we were seated in the back next to the back door.  The servers were in and out a lot (there must be another kitchen downstairs or something) & it got c-o-l-d with the door opening and closing so often.The food was all delicious.  We started with a cheese appetizer, which was fresh and tasty.  I had the gnocchi for my entree.  Wow.  The sauce & ricotta complimented it perfectly.  So good.  My husband had the meatball hero, which was also really good. I am super picky about my meatballs and usually cannot stand raisins or anything like that in my balls...but this worked.  Delicious.  Our friend had the roast beef sandwich and he very much enjoyed it.  The wine list was also very nice.    The food and service is spot on and we will be back for sure.  You can forgive the tight & uncomfortable space for food of this quality.",4.0
"The stars are almost entirely for the Blue Crab pasta which was actually worth 5 stars. Unfortunately, the rest of the meal brought it down for me- with the exception of the sparkling rosé, but that's not something they actually make, so I can only give so many kudos there.As for the meatballs, while good, I think they pale by comparison to the balls at Ciano and Little Owl. The crostinis, of which we had several were also just okay. The speck and ricotta being the best of the lot. Followed by the mushroom.But dessert was where things really went off the rails. The ricotta cheesecake was a complete waste of calories and did a grave disservice to every other cheesecake in existence that shares its name. It was so dry and flavorless I literally only had a single bite.But WOW, was that pasta good. So was the service. And the decor, simple and somewhat quaint. Nothing too worthy of note. Granted we didn't eat in the barn, which I hear is nice.So, 457... I give you a 3... in stars. Not out of 10. That would be too harsh even for me.",3.0

Decided to walk around court st and Frankie's menu caught our eye among the other places. We were greeted promptly and received a phone call within ten minutes for our table.

"Little too hip meaning prices are high; food's not that great. My ravioli sat in not so flavorful liquid. The menu did say it was in broth, but the broth was like pasta water with a little butter or olive oil, & both the broth & the ravioli were bland. My cocktail, tho pricey, was delish. Wish I could remember what else was in it besides iced tea & lemon juice so I could make it @ home! Also, they ""specialize"" in their own olive oil which didn't taste very good to me!

"No longer the best meatballs in the city!  Success has finally ruined Frankies.  For years the meatballs have been fresh and homemade.  That made them soft and succulent and full of subtle flavors. Now they are mass produced and frozen. This makes them hard and now, despite the pine nuts and raisins, they only taste of garlic. Like a bad Italian joke.

"Finally I made it to the famous Frankie's, after talking about it for about two years!  Did it live up to the rep?  Maybe--the experience was great, from waiting for our table in the leafy side garden to getting a stellar table right by a window, with a great view of both the backyard and the kitchen action.  The service was fantastic--although they seemed really busy, our waitress was very committed to making sure we had a great experience.  We ordered Frankie's Greens, which is a simple salad with roasted vegetables and was fantastic.  I'd definitely get that again.  We also got Frankie's antipasto which was maybe a mistake; not because it wasn't delicious, but because it was an enormous amount of meats and cheese for two people to finish, even if we weren't also getting pasta (which we were).  I regret not getting the sausage polenta, but went with the sausage cavetelli with browned butter.  I was torn between that and the braised lamb papperdelle and about two second after starting my cavetelli i had major order regret, since i found it to be pretty dry and bland other than the sausage.  Luckily my boyfriend knows me well and had ordered the papardelle so I could taste it too.  He was okay with swapping, so I ended up finishing his dinner.  Needless to say I ate enough meat at Frankie's to last a month, but I would definitely return--just maybe skip the pasta for the other things they have.",4.0
"The menu is very casual and approachable. Alot of veggie dishes and both pannini and sandwhiches.  There cheese dishes are very good but a bit expensive (3 pieces for $15).  The winner is the homemade pastas, especially the cavatelli with sausage and sage butter sauce.

"Frankies 457 definitely happens to be one the best Italian restaurants I have been to so far! My boyfriend and I decided to come here last night with two of our friends and Frankies sure did not let us down! We started the night off with some drinks including a pitcher of Summer Jam and a Frankies Iced Tea for myself.  I really enjoyed the ice tea because it was not overpowered by an alcoholic taste, intact it was very lemony! Once we got our drinks, we ordered our food.  When i saw they had crostinis on the menu made out of ricotta cheese and speck, I knew right away that was a must! We got two orders of those and two orders of the mushroom and truffle crostinis! We also ordered eggplant parm and a stracitella cheese. From the crostinis to the cheese, everything was so light and delicious.  I fell in love with the stracitella cheese because they give it to you on crispy bread and then you spread it... it just melts in your mouth.  The texture of it was smooth and creamy..to die for!  The eggplant parm was also off the hook!! Most places will make their tomato sauce either too strong and salty or too strong and sweet.  This one was just perfect.  It was very light and slightly on the sweeter side.  I could have eaten another one all by myself. The only thing I was disappointed about with the appetizer was that I wish they give you more than one crostini. Lastly my boyfriend and I shared a sweet sausage, onions and red peppers over a creamy polenta.  I usually am not too crazy about polenta, but this mixture of flavors and spices was just right.  Last, but not least......the desserts.  I mean if you go out to eat dinner and don't order a dessert, I don't know if I have anything else to say to you.  We ordered for different desserts.  Since I am a chocolate lover, I ordered the chocolate tart for myself, my boyfriend had the tiramisu and our two friends ordered the vanilla bean creme brûlée and ricotta cheesecake.  Let me start off by saying the chocolate tart was very tasty.  The chocolate part was delicious, but as for the bottom layer, I was not too crazy about since it was a little bit on the harder side.  The tiramisu was great.  I am not usually a tiramisu lover, but this one was very light and airy..my boyfriend would have ordered another.  The creme brûlée was also absolutely delicious, it may have been my favorite dessert of the night! The crispy texture on top just blends with the creamy custard.  Lastly, the ricotta cheesecake for me was my least favorite.  It was still tasty, but to me it was a little bit on the dryer side.  Overall, our experience here was great for the first time.  The service was also good! I do have to mention the one thing that topped off the night was a couple that was sitting in the back corner of the restaurant.  They suddenly reached over the table and started making out in full action! It was very entertaining to watch, I think everyone was trying not to laugh.  I would have to say their makeout session lasted a good 4 minutes!",4.0
"With a little name-dropping and other tactics on the art of persuasion, JC and I were able to secure a table at this brimming restaurant one busy Saturday night in July. Is the decor nice? Yes, it's romantic and serene, calm and casual and everything you wish a classy neighborhood restaurant should be. Everything about it is charming - the dark wood furniture, the small tables right by the window, the backyard (garden) seating area - it's like a best-kept secret that will inevitably be shared because of it's brilliance. But let's get to the food b/c that is what ultimately makes or breaks a place and your tolerance of pretty interiors. Mama Mia!! Their meatballs are insanely good. I wanted to eat light, and went for the Watercress with White Peaches & Gorgonzola salad, which was great but good thing Jimmy was there to correct my error in judgment and supplemented the dinner with Frankie's famed Meatballs with Pine Nuts & Raisins. These tennis-ball sized wonders were filled with some amazing ingredients that surprisingly complimented each other and made for probably the best meatball I have had in a long time.

"I'm not sure if I'd come back again.  Some things were nice, and others not so much.  Considering the area, I'd imagine that there'd be plenty of alternative solutions to semi-bad service, an unwelcoming hostess (short, white, curly blond hair), and an allegedly hour-long wait for their backyard garden.First, upon entering, I asked the hostess how long it would be for the backyard garden seating.  The response was that it'd be an hour wait.  My family and I decided to sit inside.  After about 30-minutes, another group about our size was seated in the garden.  Either the hostess has a really bad sense of time or something shady is up.  Additionally, the hostess didn't seem to know how to smile.  She also uttered a sarcastic remark in response to my joking that the backyard garden must be a valuable place to be.  I'm a New Yorker so I can take sarcasm, but not when I'm paying to be hosted and served at a restaurant.Second, it took forever to get our food.  And, when we did, they made us wait another 15 minutes because one of our five didn't get his dish.  And, when we did get it, it was the completely wrong dish!  The dish we ordered was a vegetable linguine.  What we got was a crab linguine.  Luckily, my mom likes shellfish and isn't allergic to it.The food, however, was good.  We got an array of pastas, salads, and a few meatballs to share.  All were tasty and well done.  I would say that one of the salad (some sort of tomato, avocado special) was very overpriced at $17.  It was essentially two tomatoes sliced up with a few avocado pieces doused in seasoned olive oil.  Not worth it at all.I had high hopes for the place, especially because it was for my little brother's birthday.  My family still seemed to enjoy the food and the ambiance, albeit because our table was right next to the kitchen, it was really loud and a bit unsettling.Come up Frankies!",2.0

"(3.5 Stars)We had been meaning to try Frankies 457 for a while. Truth be told, we were on our way to Buttermilk Channel but, attempting to hedge our bets, we put our names down at Frankies while exploring the wait at Buttermilk Channel. With a wait of several years at Buttermilk Channel, we decided that pasta would serve our purposes just fine and, twenty minutes later, we were seated in the pleasant little courtyard in the back.There's an interesting mix of characters at Frankies 457 -- ranging from the typical obnoxious types to families, groups and couples. Essentially, it is the quintessential neighborhood spot and is, on average, a rather comfortable space in which to partake in a meal. The music, however, became rather loud when were there, which always detracts from the general ambiance. But I digress.Initially seated outside, it became frigidly cold (such are the perils of spring) and so we were thankfully offered an indoor table, seated next to a couple whom we spent analyzing throughout the evening. The question, ""Generally awkward or a first date?"" was the subject of our investigation. Again, I digress.Food:-Bufala Mozzarella & Arugula-Escarole & Cannelli Bean Soup-Sweet Potato & Sage Ravioli in Parmesan Broth-Cavatelli with Faiccos Hot Sausage & Browned Sage ButterThe pastas are certainly where Frankies 457 shines, offering fresh and delicious fare that impressed the Italian ""I lived in Bologna"" snobs among us. While the salad and soup were decent, I don't know whether either option justified their price and I'd sooner order three pastas for us to share than waste time with the healthier options (a chunk of bufala mozzarella is healthy, right? Of course).Conclusion: We will certainly return to Frankies 457. While I'm not sure whether it's a destination spot, it is a cute Brooklyn neighborhood restaurant serving food of a consistently good standard. Considering the wait times appeared somewhat reasonable (at least when we went at 6:30 p.m. on a Saturday) and the fact that one may stroll around the underrated area the is Carroll Gardens while one waits, Frankies 457 is certainly worth your time if you're in the market for Italian fare in that neck of the woods.",4.0
"Frankies 457 definitely happens to be one the best Italian restaurants I have been to so far! My boyfriend and I decided to come here last night with two of our friends and Frankies sure did not let us down! We started the night off with some drinks including a pitcher of Summer Jam and a Frankies Iced Tea for myself.  I really enjoyed the ice tea because it was not overpowered by an alcoholic taste, intact it was very lemony! Once we got our drinks, we ordered our food.  When i saw they had crostinis on the menu made out of ricotta cheese and speck, I knew right away that was a must! We got two orders of those and two orders of the mushroom and truffle crostinis! We also ordered eggplant parm and a stracitella cheese. From the crostinis to the cheese, everything was so light and delicious.  I fell in love with the stracitella cheese because they give it to you on crispy bread and then you spread it... it just melts in your mouth.  The texture of it was smooth and creamy..to die for!  The eggplant parm was also off the hook!! Most places will make their tomato sauce either too strong and salty or too strong and sweet.  This one was just perfect.  It was very light and slightly on the sweeter side.  I could have eaten another one all by myself. The only thing I was disappointed about with the appetizer was that I wish they give you more than one crostini.

"I really do believe this is as good as it gets!  I was pleasantly surprised that this place didn't have inflated prices after being on Jimmy Fallon (how we heard of it).  We showed up before trendy New York dinner time to beat the rush- glad we did- but we sat at the bar to eat anyway.  Our bartender was efficient and friendly and added to the vibe they were going for.  The hostess was also great and I'm positive one of the owners was there and seemed genuinely concerned that everyone was having the best dining experience.  It just felt good to be there but, the food hit it out of the park!  Boyfriend and I shared the asparagus special that had creamy mozzerella was marinated almost as perfectly as the olives we devoured.  I ordered a beet and avocado salad- my two favorite vegetabes in one dish- and it was AWESOME.  BF had cavatelli sausage and sage butter that was delizioso.  I was also sipping on a great bourbon drink the entire time.  I don't travel to Brooklyn often, but this is even worth getting on the G train *GASP*!",5.0

"When a friend recently came to town, he requested a unique dinner experience* and when surveying the greater Cobble Hill landscape, what I discovered is that if you want an intimate, candlelit, brick-walled dining experience then you were in luck.Flaming sticks of meat? Not so much.The food at Frankie's was tasty, though not much stood out as must-haves. The mushroom crostini was flavorful, but $4 for one (though they pack a lot in) didn't engender a desire to buy a lot of them. The cheese plate was nice, and when they sent us the wrong meat originally, just told us to keep it before bringing us the correct one.For main courses, we had a really nice cavatelli that was cooked perfectly, but without the ground pepper on top didn't have a ton of flavor. The pork shoulder was good, but not outstanding, though it did have a delicious red sauce that proved perfect for being scooped up with the copious bread we were given.Frankie's is nice, though not systemically different from everywhere else trying for this same low-lit dinner style in the BK. What puts them over the top from a 3.5 star place to a four in my book are the people working there -- everyone was incredibly nice and accommodating. Sure, we were there late on a Tuesday night so maybe there's a different vibe on a Friday or Saturday, but I think Frankie's draws intrigue by being so far from the subway, in the way that if you have to walk that far for it, and people are, then obviously it must be good. You know what I mean?I think there are a ton of other restaurants in the neighborhood that offer this type of perfect-for-a-date-vibe but not all of them do it as welcomingly as Frankie's, and making me feel good for eating at your restaurant always gets an extra star from me.* - His suggestion: a two- or three-level dining room with an atrium in the middle or flaming sticks of meat with background dancers.

"My girlfriend I went there for a late lunch the other Sunday.  Loved it.  It was my third time here and at first I was disappointed because we were too late for brunch and the french toast was straight out the best I have eaten.  But I ended up ordering one of the homemade pastas; Cavatelli with Faiccos Hot Sausage & Browned Sage Butter.  WOW!  I just haven't quite had a dish like that before.  The pasta had a great texture, and maybe the right word is structure.  Biting into it was just different and great.  Sauce was excellent; nuanced.  It almost didn't need the spicy sausage, but it is hard to pass that up with a beer.  My girlfreind started with the lentil and smoked bacon soup, and that I would recommend as well.  She says the sandwich she got was delicious, but it looked boring to me.Service was spot on, though we went at a pretty chill time.",5.0

"I've been to Frankie's about a million times and this past weekend I attended my brother's wedding here. He and my sister-in-law had a small service held in the backyard under a canvas tent and the reception was held in the converted stable house. Everything was so lovely! From the candlelit tables, to the floral arrangements, to the food presentation. The stable seats about 40 people (I think), as everyone was seated at two long tables. There was also much room to mingle around, as we additionally had the entire yard to ourselves (there were portable heaters available, but we didn't need them). The stable has a small bar and a medium sized single bathroom so one doesn't have to go back into the main part of the restaurant. Being in the stable I felt detached from the restaurant, so there is a nice level of privacy and it felt like our party were the only people there. The staff did an excellent job and was ever attentive and friendly; always refilling wine and water glasses and the food was delicious as always. Cost wise--and you can check out their website--I think it's very affordable for NYC and I'm definitely keeping them in mind for when my time comes to plan my reception.",5.0
"My husband and I came here for dinner on a Tuesday night to celebrate our anniversary. (Aside: I had heard about Frankie's from a friend a few years ago as some of the best Italian food she'd eaten and finally made the trek).We arrived at around 7:30 to see a decent crowd. Since it was a summer night we opted for their outdoor area, which is very cute, small 2-4 person tables under a canopy. We ordered two things to start -  the cremini mushroom crostini and the salad with:  fennel, celery root & parsley with sliced red onion, lemon & pecorino. The mushroom crostini was good, but for me it was on the salty side and had a touch too much truffle oil.  However, my husband whose not always a mushroom fan, loved this dish and was impressed by the freshness and flavor of the mushrooms. The salad was tasty - it was fresh and balanced and dressed perfectly. A unique blend of ingredients I haven't seen elsewhere. The bread brought  and olive oil were also good. Then the mains came, my husband had gotten the linguine with trapanese almond pesto and I got the eggplant parmesan, which was a special that night. The moment I saw the eggplant, I was deflated. There on an oblong plate lay four eggplant medallions, with some tomato sauce and a sprinkle of cheese. As I bit into the eggplant more disappointment washed over me. The tomato sauce they had used was not seasoned and had no depth of flavor. The eggplant itself was grilled correctly but hadn't been seasoned.  And - if a dish has parmesan in the title, shouldn't it at least be present in the dish? Moving on... My husband's pasta was extremely rich and hard to eat after the first few bites. The reason being, trapanese is a pesto where the nuts are left in pretty sizable chunks, so each bite we were met with crunchy almonds. The novelty wears off quickly. In general the dish was heavy and very one note, with the small bit of ground basil and tomato fighting to poke through. Given how disappointed we were at the mediocre entrees after a pleasant first course, we opted against dessert. Not much more to add except that the service was not great. Our server was not friendly or efficient (she didn't come to check on us during the entire entree portion of the meal) and small details, like putting candles on the table before it was too dark to see, weren't addressed. So, minus 1 star for service and 2 for a mediocre meal where the pasta sauce felt like it had been poured from a jar onto my plate. Perhaps the meat is different but not a place I'd come back to as a vegetarian.",2.0

We started off with the Antipasto which was incredible.  Cheese and meat...obviously good, but on top of that there were sauteed mushrooms and roasted cauliflower.  This has officially put me on a mission to replicate the cauliflower at home, it was THAT good!For an entree I got House-made Cavatelli with Faiccos Hot Sausage & Browned Sage Butter and my boyfriend got the Meatballs with Pine Nuts & Raisins.  The Cavatelli was so delicious, the sauce was tasty and the sausage was just the right amount of spicy.  The Meatballs were also quite impressive.  I'm a tough critic when it comes to red sauce, and this was to notch.The ambiance is pretty old school Italian and the service was great.I highly recommend Frankies!",5.0

"Simple , greatly sourced items, Italian as close to home as I can get stateside. Really nice dinner. Great Italian wine list.",5.0
"Great local italian restaurant. Fresh pasta, herbs and great service. I had the soup, assorted cheeses and braised octopus salad. Was impressed with the home made mozzarella buffalo cheese.  The place can get very crowded.  I like the backyards and see how great it can be when the weather is nice.  Its pricer than what i expect but overall something worth experiencing.  I will be returning for the pasta.  I don't eat pork and heard that their meatballs are made from beef so yeah.  Heard the prune mascarpone desert is great.  Will return to try",4.0
"Ordered the Housemate Pappardelle with Braised Lamb, Tomato, Tarragon & Frankies Olive Oil. It was delicious. Although the proportions were just right, it was one of those meals where I wish I had seconds. My friends ordered the Sweet Potato & Sage Ravioli in Parmesan Broth, which was light and tasty, and also a a Spicy sauce Spaghetti with Uni, also delicious. Atmosphere is cozy but a little tight.

"This review is about the service as the food is still good. Called in advance to see if just coming for a round of drinks and a cheese and meat platter outside would be ok. the person who answered said of course no problem. We show up ten minutes later and are told wait for the hostess... about ten awkward minutes pass staring at am empty restaurant and only four tables in the garden taken. The hostess/manager/heavy accented frownie woman comes in with a huge attitude says we need to wait bc she is setting up other tables. ok... fine though I thought I should just leave really. we then sit down and it's not that she doesn't smile, I can deal with the lack of smile I guess but a scowl, eye roll and a look as if we are wasting her time every step of the way while being there. all we did was sit down, order a round and the platter, ask for check which she rolled her eyes when my husband asked for change. sorry 20% isn't enough for you.. so sorry. this woman worked as a waitress when this place first opened, maybe she is an owner. this was one of my favorite places to come to but now I don't want to ever return. She should think about how she treats customers. This place was so sweet when it first opened and had a great vibe. I love all of their places but it has lost its charm and the vibe that made it cool to begin with along with some simple great tasting food. now it seems all about turning tables, attitude and marketing their products more than caring about customers who by the way didn't have a complaint, question or any type of attitude at all.

"3.5 stars, rounding down this time. And I will explain why.As much as Frankies 457 is cute and relaxing... seriously, so cute that they were actually having a private wedding (reception?) in the back garden while I was there for brunch on a Sunday recently... the prices are just a bit higher than they should be.First off, the seemingly popular crostini are served by the singles. The ricotta and speck crostini we ordered was just a thinly sliced piece of toast, about 2 squared inch in size, topped with some ricotta and a tiny slice of speck. That little shit was $4.50, no joke. Since we were there for brunch, both the bf and I actually ordered the frittata, he the prosciutto & potato, and I the mushroom & pecorino. The frittata was pre-made and cut into wedges, served at room temperature, and actually quite dense and filling because it was almost quiche-like. While the flavors of the frittatas were good, I think I would've enjoyed it more if it was just a little fluffier and made to order. I did however, like the mixed greens on the side which was dressed in a very tangy, yet slightly creamy dressing.Another gripe about my brunch experience here that made it less than amazing was the fact that our dishes took a while to come out. Sure, I understand that perhaps the tiny kitchen was busy trying to serve the private evening in the back patio, but everything we ordered was cold/room temp anyway and really only required assembling anyway. I would consider coming back for dinner, but because Carroll Gardens is such a long trek for me, I don't really see that happening anytime soon...--P.S. Something is seriously wrong with the olive oil they serve with their bread. It's freaking pungent as hell, and literally burnt my throat. I actually wondered whether it was olive oil or gasoline for a minute.",3.0

"I had my wedding at Frankie's last Sunday and it was amazing! I was a little concerned about the quality of the food as it is served ""family style"" and wedding fare is always underwhelming. Well let me tell you my fears were unwarranted. The cavatelli was a huge hit and I don't like gnocchi but THIS one was amazing. The meatballs were great and the chocolate torte tasted like chocolate butter (which is a good thing). I would say pass on the cheesecake as that was the only disappointing dish. The servers were great and even packed up all the left over food so now our fridge is stocked! I worked with Marci who can be difficult to get ahold of (literally every single email I sent got an ""out of office"" reply) but our day of go-to Emory was awesome. The space is rustic-chique and all of my guests loved it. I had an open bar and added a half hour, making the whole event 3.5hrs which felt perfect.

"I am no longer under the spell of Frankie's 457. Granted, it is lovely inside. I always scope out restaurant bathrooms, and this one is straight out of a Restoration Hardware catalogue. The dining area is tight but cozy. Exposed brick and all that. If you're visiting in nice weather and are lucky enough to snag a coveted table in the charming garden, so much the better. [One of my girlfriends has already made an announcement amongst our group that she is having her rehearsal dinner in the Frankie's garden. She is not even engaged yet.] I will also grant you that the food is consistently good. High quality, prepared well, right in front of you. The menu, though, is limited, and never seems to rotate. My biggest complaint is with the service. The waitstaff is afflicted with a general air of gentrified BoCoCa snootiness, so heaven forbid you can't pronounce the name of an exotic cheese properly. You want to substitute something in one of their masterpieces? Quelle horreur! There are plenty of Italian restaurants in this neighborhood, most of them more affordable, more relaxed and with food just as good as Frankie's. [My fave is Fragole.]",3.0
One of the most over hyped place in Brooklyn and apparently on Yelp. I am not sure how it is for breakfast or lunch but definitely NOT great for dinner.   the wait is too long but I dont mind the wait for a good food. The food is just average and super overpriced.    If i come back again or you planning a visit definitely order 4 orders of Crostini....or better yet - get some General Tso from Wong Cho around the corner,2.0
"After years of  hearing the drums beat and the surprise reactions of not haven't been to Frankies on Court St., I finally got my chance.  Located in the heart of Carrol Gardens from whence i came, This now trendy, upbeat, young neighborhood filled with transplants whom out number ""The Localsl"", Frankies is considered a superstar.  My initial thought upon entering was ""Nice""!  Small, quaint, cozy, and hip with a great vibe.  Something you would expect to find in these trendy neighborhoods.  Not a place for larger groups, but great for you and one other.The service was great.  The staff was friendly, knowledgable and patient.  Patient because, when you have a bunch of rambunctious guys, whom are all about having a good time, even if its at the expense of others, and you are able to manage them and laugh every time a glass of wine was spilled, you get an ""A"".  That translated into an extra large tip. Hats off to Roberto, our server.After looking over the menu and realizing it's sicilian influence,  I inherently become wary.  Being of Sicilian ancestry and raised around old school sicilian style food, you can't help yourself.  I know what this stuff is supposed to taste like.Ok, food talk.  After literally ordering half the menu, I could honestly say the food was solid.  For those of you behind the times, it means ""good"", not perfect, but good.  Starting with the Crostini's, the Eggplant Caponata was creamy, savory and  slightly chunky. The Sicilian White Anchovy were perfect, slightly salty, oily and packed with that great anchovy flavor.  It was a good start to a fun evening.Moving to the salads, we had the Bufala Mozzarella & Arugula salad, hard to go wrong with this one.  The Braised Octopus with Dandelion Greens & Castelvetrano Vinaigrette, The Duck Liver toast with Arugula salad; my favorite!  The duck liver was creamy, sweet a little salty and great against the crunch of the toast.  The Fennel, Celery Root & Parsley with Sliced Red Onion salad, and Frankies Antipasto which you have a choice of  2 Meats, Cheeses, Veggies & Olives, were average.  I need to point out two things:  The Octopus although cooked perfect was a little fishy, which questions the level of freshness during the cooking process. ""The Frankies Antipasto"" not worth the $17 price tag.  I expected a little more.For dinner we shared, Frankies famous Meatballs with Pine Nuts & Raisins, meaty, nutty and complimented by a rich delicious sauce.  The House-Made Gnocchi Marinara & Fresh Ricotta was good, but the Gnocchi were a little dense.  The Sweet Sausage, Roasted Red Pepper & Onion Over Creamy Polenta was ok, and The House-made Cavatelli with Faiccos Hot Sausage & Browned Sage Butter, had the right amount of everything.  Guaranteed to taste every ingredient in every bite.The only dessert worth mentioning  was the Red Wine Prunes with Mascarpone.  Creamy, not too sweet, and the right amount of texture from the prunes to complete each bite.  A definite winner here.  You can skip the other desserts, they get low marks.Overall, the experience was good.  With the food fairly priced, and the equally fairly priced selection of good wines, throw in the good service, I think Frankie has earned his drums.  It's a neighborhood hot spot and I see why.",3.0
"I was dying to try Frankie's and glad I did! Small, intimate neighborhood hot stop that pays to visit during the week. I went after going to a wine tour at Brooklyn Winery and they quickly accommodated us when we walked in at 8:30. Menu favorites - burrata foccacia and the golden raisin and pine nut meatballs. It's a small menu but all plates were flavorful and well worth it. Can't wait to go back and maybe sit in the garden area.",5.0

"3.75 to be accurate...They were at the Frieze Art Fair and we had a nice, fresh and simple lunch.Good to know all these dishes could be found at their Manhattan and Brooklyn location...Fragrant Mushroom & Truffle Crostini.A Radish dish that I've been obsessively  trying to replicate at home. Homemade pastas and that heavenly Red Wine Prunes with Mascarpone!For full review with photos please visit my blog.",4.0
"Went on a Saturday night, so had to put our name in about 90 minutes before, but it was well worth it. It was my first time at the restaurant, but my fiance's second and she convinced me to have a cheat night (I usually eat G free). Amazing atmosphere, good drinks, and really great pasta! Dinner was very reasonably priced, and this is definitely the best italian food in a very italian neighborhood.The Ricotta and date desert is amazing if you still have room!",5.0
"I had my wedding at Frankie's last Sunday and it was amazing! I was a little concerned about the quality of the food as it is served ""family style"" and wedding fare is always underwhelming. Well let me tell you my fears were unwarranted. The cavatelli was a huge hit and I don't like gnocchi but THIS one was amazing. The meatballs were great and the chocolate torte tasted like chocolate butter (which is a good thing). I would say pass on the cheesecake as that was the only disappointing dish. The servers were great and even packed up all the left over food so now our fridge is stocked! I worked with Marci who can be difficult to get ahold of (literally every single email I sent got an ""out of office"" reply) but our day of go-to Emory was awesome. The space is rustic-chique and all of my guests loved it. I had an open bar and added a half hour, making the whole event 3.5hrs which felt perfect. Great wedding venue for a small wedding (mine was 32 guests)and for keeping it simple. I think if you are ""bridezilla"" you may be weary as no one is following you around checking on you every second, but for the rest of us, it was perfect!",4.0
"Great spot. I'll definitely be back.  I started with the ascarole and cannellini bean soup, which was very good, followed by the cavatelli and sausage with brown butter.which was fantastic. My friend had a Frankie's green salad to start and eggplant with marinara sauce as an entree, Both were delicious, Service was pretty good though not particularly warm/friendly.

"I am no longer under the spell of Frankie's 457. Granted, it is lovely inside. I always scope out restaurant bathrooms, and this one is straight out of a Restoration Hardware catalogue. The dining area is tight but cozy. Exposed brick and all that. If you're visiting in nice weather and are lucky enough to snag a coveted table in the charming garden, so much the better. [One of my girlfriends has already made an announcement amongst our group that she is having her rehearsal dinner in the Frankie's garden. She is not even engaged yet.] I will also grant you that the food is consistently good. High quality, prepared well, right in front of you. The menu, though, is limited, and never seems to rotate. My biggest complaint is with the service. The waitstaff is afflicted with a general air of gentrified BoCoCa snootiness, so heaven forbid you can't pronounce the name of an exotic cheese properly. You want to substitute something in one of their masterpieces? Quelle horreur! There are plenty of Italian restaurants in this neighborhood, most of them more affordable, more relaxed and with food just as good as Frankie's. [My fave is Fragole.]",3.0
One of the most over hyped place in Brooklyn and apparently on Yelp. I am not sure how it is for breakfast or lunch but definitely NOT great for dinner.   the wait is too long but I dont mind the wait for a good food. The food is just average and super overpriced.    If i come back again or you planning a visit definitely order 4 orders of Crostini....or better yet - get some General Tso from Wong Cho around the corner,2.0
"After years of  hearing the drums beat and the surprise reactions of not haven't been to Frankies on Court St., I finally got my chance.  Located in the heart of Carrol Gardens from whence i came, This now trendy, upbeat, young neighborhood filled with transplants whom out number ""The Localsl"", Frankies is considered a superstar.  My initial thought upon entering was ""Nice""!  Small, quaint, cozy, and hip with a great vibe.  Something you would expect to find in these trendy neighborhoods.  Not a place for larger groups, but great for you and one other.The service was great.  The staff was friendly, knowledgable and patient.  Patient because, when you have a bunch of rambunctious guys, whom are all about having a good time, even if its at the expense of others, and you are able to manage them and laugh every time a glass of wine was spilled, you get an ""A"".  That translated into an extra large tip. Hats off to Roberto, our server.After looking over the menu and realizing it's sicilian influence,  I inherently become wary.  Being of Sicilian ancestry and raised around old school sicilian style food, you can't help yourself.  I know what this stuff is supposed to taste like.Ok, food talk.  After literally ordering half the menu, I could honestly say the food was solid.  For those of you behind the times, it means ""good"", not perfect, but good.  Starting with the Crostini's, the Eggplant Caponata was creamy, savory and  slightly chunky. The Sicilian White Anchovy were perfect, slightly salty, oily and packed with that great anchovy flavor.  It was a good start to a fun evening.Moving to the salads, we had the Bufala Mozzarella & Arugula salad, hard to go wrong with this one.  The Braised Octopus with Dandelion Greens & Castelvetrano Vinaigrette, The Duck Liver toast with Arugula salad; my favorite!  The duck liver was creamy, sweet a little salty and great against the crunch of the toast.  The Fennel, Celery Root & Parsley with Sliced Red Onion salad, and Frankies Antipasto which you have a choice of  2 Meats, Cheeses, Veggies & Olives, were average.  I need to point out two things:  The Octopus although cooked perfect was a little fishy, which questions the level of freshness during the cooking process. ""The Frankies Antipasto"" not worth the $17 price tag.  I expected a little more.For dinner we shared, Frankies famous Meatballs with Pine Nuts & Raisins, meaty, nutty and complimented by a rich delicious sauce.  The House-Made Gnocchi Marinara & Fresh Ricotta was good, but the Gnocchi were a little dense.  The Sweet Sausage, Roasted Red Pepper & Onion Over Creamy Polenta was ok, and The House-made Cavatelli with Faiccos Hot Sausage & Browned Sage Butter, had the right amount of everything.  Guaranteed to taste every ingredient in every bite.The only dessert worth mentioning  was the Red Wine Prunes with Mascarpone.  Creamy, not too sweet, and the right amount of texture from the prunes to complete each bite.  A definite winner here.  You can skip the other desserts, they get low marks.Overall, the experience was good.  With the food fairly priced, and the equally fairly priced selection of good wines, throw in the good service, I think Frankie has earned his drums.  It's a neighborhood hot spot and I see why.",3.0
"I was dying to try Frankie's and glad I did! Small, intimate neighborhood hot stop that pays to visit during the week. I went after going to a wine tour at Brooklyn Winery and they quickly accommodated us when we walked in at 8:30. Menu favorites - burrata foccacia and the golden raisin and pine nut meatballs. It's a small menu but all plates were flavorful and well worth it. Can't wait to go back and maybe sit in the garden area.",5.0
"Not sure what to say about this place... I have become a regular just because I know this place will impress my friends visiting Brooklyn from Manhattan and it's great for a date, when I get to pick. What makes this place great is the ambiance, the warmness , and the beautiful backyard. Regarding the food, it's good, you can definitely tell everything is fresh. They are famous for their meatballs, true they are good. This restaurant does not carry chicken or salmon. so most of main courses are either rabbit, lamb, or sausage. These are hearty meals and there is nothing wrong with that. I just think some of the main dishes have way too much salt. The appetizers, like octopus salad or the mozzarella are just full with a mountain of salad. last winter though, after a long walk with my friend, we came in for a soup and it was perfect.",3.0
"This place is out of this world! The atmosphere, the staff, the wine and the food is AMAZING!My husband and I had our wedding in the back garden/stable room over a year ago. Great for parties. Frankie's knows how to run a party and keep the glasses always full and food a coming!It has become one of our favorite spots, and we are frequent customers. The food is so fresh and unbelievably delicious. Its a romantic, cozy place. The cavatelli with hot sausage and brown sage butter is my absolute FAVORITE, but everything is A++You must get some desert as well!",5.0
"It is tough when you love a girl (Frankies 17), but then you start to have feelings for her sister (Frankies 457). It can become very difficult, trying to cultivate these two relationships with equal passion and secrecy. You know one is on the Lower East Side and the other in Carroll Gardens, but still the appropriateness factor is kind of hard to justify.I met Frankies 17's sister, Frankies 457, this afternoon for the first time and she was actually prettier than 17. She was also larger, but both of their smiles invite you into a warm and relaxing place. 457 gained automatic points because she has an affinity for the outdoors (beautiful outdoor dining space in the back), while 17 is pretty crammed together in all aspects. Their menus looked similar, some would call them fraternal twins, but I didn't ask.I neglected the butternut squash soup that I love so much because that is something special between 17 and I. Instead I opted for the porchetta sandwich with arugula and mustard at 457. The bread was tender, but crispy and inside was carved and succulent. The taste was great and so my crush on 457 continued.I could not prolong my stay with 457 enough to sample anything else, but the time we spent together in her backyard seemed special to me. I just don't know how to go back to 17 and feel ok about it. I know I want to see both again and again.",4.0
"Excellent restaurant! Probably the best italian restaurant i've been to in brooklyn. A little pricey, but worth it. We sat outside because it was the end of the summer and the ambience was lovely. The inside looks nice too, and I'm sure indoor seating would also be a nice experience. Highly recommend this place!",5.0
"Frankies 457 is perfect.I went on a date with my boyfriend there on a Thursday evening and there was an hour wait. They offered us a tiny table near the front where we could have drinks while we waited. We got a half-carafe of the house red wine and it was phenomenal. Well-balanced, delicious, and inexpensive! After about 40 minutes, they took us out to the indoor eating area behind the garden. It's a gorgeous space and our server was friendly and attentive. She easily accommodated my dairy allergy, too- not necessarily an easy feat at an Italian restaurant. I ate the eggplant caponata crostini, the fennel salad, and the braised lamb (not on the menu this summer).The only issue I had is that the bread wasn't warm! I don't understand why restaurants do this. The olive oil was delicious but cold bread is totally lost on it. Even if you can't make it fresh baked, put it under a warming lamp or something maybe? It's a pretty easy step to make the dining experience seem that much better.I will definitely come back here.",5.0

Great for lunch....A wonderful selection of small crostini (which are actually quite large) and salads. I was set on a sandwich and the server recommended the BLT which had awesome super thick bacon. Really delish. My lunch guest had the quinoa salad. So fresh and light. Great dressing. Looking forward to coming back to try the pastas for dinner.

"The first thing you notice when you walk into Frankies 457 is that it smells LIKE HEAVEN. Because like half of the restaurant is taken up by a kitchen, there are amazing smells that seem to change every 5 minutes. Butter, garlic, tomato, sage... so basically I was ravenously hungry before even sitting down. And the food lived up to its smell. At our table, we got the pasta with rabbit, the eggplant parm, and the slow roasted pork shoulder (special weekend dish). Each dish was better than the next.

"My family and I just spent four months in Carroll Gardens (the best neighborhood in the world) and we went to Frankies so often, it never occurred to me to Yelp about it, since it felt so much like home. But now we're headed away and it's time to sing this magnificent restaurant's praises. The food is uniformly amazing -- traditional-seeming Italian fare, but all of it just off the beaten path enough (or from deep enough in the tradition that it's lesser-known to all but cognoscenti) that it's all not just comforting, it's consistently revelatory. Try the Cavatelli with sausage; the fennel and celery root salad; the chickpea and guanciale crostini; the sette anni peppers -- and the vegetable bolognese has a lemony kick that makes it the lightest, brightest, most invigorating bowl of red-sauced pasta you'll ever eat. All the pastas are made in house and these guys grow their own olive oil over in Italy -- the tart, vegetal, poetic kind that adds centuries of resonance to everything it touches. Eating at Frankies takes you down into the history of a neighborhood, and then down through the history of a city, and then down into the history of a whole country and culture across the ocean, down and down, all the way back to where people first tasted something and said, ""When can we have that again?"" The atmosphere is welcoming and honest and, I don't know how else to say it, present. These guys have your back.

"Went here for dinner on a Sunday night and waited 20 minutes for a table. This place has outdoor seating in the rear under a tent. Tables had small votives and was very cute and quaint. They were playing bluegrass and country music, which is a plus in my book. Five stars for ambiance. Food: We ordered carrots as an appetizer and they were pretty plain, no brown sugar or glaze, but were still sweet and delicious. We also had the greens salad and the dressing was great. The salad was pretty plain with no tomatoes, onions, or nuts, but the simplicity was still delish. For an entree I ordered the sweet sausage and red pepper. It was good, but there were no noodles in the dish - only polenta. I would have liked some noodles. Also, I wasn't impressed with the bread and olive oil served at the outset of the meal.

"the staff is not all that nice.  They think they're cool.this place has very good food.  My personal favorite is the sausage and broccoli rabe sandwich, on very soft bread. mmmm.  homemade sausage, possibly made in house or at the nearby pork shop, (which is a brilliant place, btw)Frankies makes great meatballs,  but the meatball sandwich is plain.They have nice little salads too.overall,  they have great pastas,  but they DO NOT COMPARE to Brucie, which is down the street on Court.  Brucie is pasta heaven, especially for somebody who knows pasta, and who knows about cooking creatively.Frankies 457 is actually very good.  I feel a little bad giving it a 4,  because they are so popular  and maybe I am being mean.  But truly,  they just arent a very loving establishment.  Brucie,  Seersucker, Court Street Grocers, Pork Shop, Stinky Brooklyn, and Four and Twenty Blackbirds are all nearby,  and these places are SUPER FRIENDLY and welcoming.  I get multiple 'good-byes'  and 'how are you?'s from the staffs at those places.  But frankies 457 seems to be a bit of a competitive environment.  Slightly cold.",4.0

"I like Italian food, but I don't know if I can say I love it. It has to be really good for me to want to write a review about it. First, they don't take reservations. One of the reasons I was so hesitant to try this place, but I've read so many great reviews, and I love Brooklyn, I had to check it out. We got there on a Friday night around 7:15pm, the hostess says: ""45 minute wait"". We expected it. We gave her our number, and went to get something to drink. There are plenty of coffee places around the area, ""Le Petit Cafe"" a block away (they serve coffee, and were friendly.) We came back at 8 pm, we were hungry! We finally got a table at 8:30. I really didn't mind the wait, and my friend and I came already prepared to wait. What an amazing meal! The restaurant itself is cute, and has that cozy feeling, and the crowd is the typical Brooklynite. They know about food! We had the polenta dish, AMAZING! The sweet sausages were delicious, and the red peppers were to die for. My friend had the pappardelle with lamb, so good!!! The crostinis are worth trying, we loved the ricotta and speck, so fresh, and tasty. I am always looking for the best Ricotta Cheese Cake in NYC, I love Veniero's or Caffe Dante, BUT FRANKIES Ricotta Cheese Cake is probably the best thing I ever ate.

"Pretty strong. The tight confines of entering through the bar area open up to a slightly more spacious back area with quite a few tables and the server to patron ratio is almost 1:1 which shocked me at first because you normally don't see that. However, it was a welcome site as we were constantly attended to but not hounded. The crostinis are fantastic. They're light and very tasty. Our favorite by far was the cremini mushroom and truffle oil one. I could probably eat just a few of those for my meal. My wife had the linguine with clams and I had the cavatelli with hot sausage and both were equally fantastic. The great thing about this restaurant that they've really got right is that the pasta is all homemade which makes for a satisfying pallet and nothing is too heavy. The restaurant is cute and quaint, however very tight on room throughout which became a headache as the night went on and they got more and more busy. It became difficult to move and even to leave. Their beer options aren't really that great and their wine is very over-priced. They did have my my wife's favorite wine but at more money than most Manhattan restaurants which is a turn off.SIDENOTE - they do accept credit cards now (sounds like business was hurting without it).",4.0

The quality of service you get with this place is hit or miss. The food is pretty good.. (I always get the sweet potato ravioli)... I could probably cook up something similar at home without having to wait and wait and wait... especially if the wait staff has you begging to even order food, wine, etc.I wish they would just take reservations.",3.0
"Wonderful food.  Nice location, too. Only wish their wine by the glass selection were a bit bigger (most of the options were by the bottle only).",4.0
I'm starting with 3 stars because I never actually got to experience my dinner here. On a Saturday at 7 pm the wait was 1 hour and 45 minutes....we weren't going to wait. I put my name down on the list anyway and went to Piquant for dinner instead...I got a call exactly an 1:45 later....too bad I was already half way through dinner elsewhere. I'd love to actually get in at some point and update my review about the food. I don't know I think its a little ridiculous to have to wait that long. Why don't they take reservations? I think they should in order to manage the flow of people better...I guess they don't really have to considering there were like 20 people ahead of me....but this wait would totally deter me from ever coming back at peak time.,3.0
"Recently had our June, day wedding at Frankies - and it was great!The garden area was the perfect setting for our ceremony and the stable a great venue for the reception. The staff were friendly and attentive and the food was fantastic - overall great experience!!",5.0
Everything was awesome. Gnocchi were to die for. Meatballs were homemade. Service was awesome. Just an awesome experience from start to finish. Decent wine selection too. Was a tad dark inside but it made it feel even cozier.,5.0
"Corkage is astronomical. $15 per bottle, which we weren't notified about until we sat down. BAD! However... The food is very reasonably priced and amazing.I had the rabbit with polenta which was incredibly good. The salads and charcuterie were also top notch. One star off b/c the staff were a little glum but that will not keep me from going back. A great local restaurant with fresh beautiful food.",4.0
"new favorite restaurant in this neighborhood. great service, nice cozy space and great and fresh variety of food. i came for lunch the first time knowing that every time i pass around dinner time, the line for a table is ridiculous. so i was pretty happy i scored a table for two immediately in this small space.had a variety of their crositinis and by far, my favorites were the chickpea and cremini mushroom with truffle oil. for the entree i got the parpadelle with bolognese sauce. so simple but so fresh and delicious.",5.0
"We had our rehearsal dinner in the carriage house behind the main dinning room n(OCT 4).  The staff, service, food and environment were all top notch.  I've eaten here and at their sister restaurant next door (Prime Meats) several times and have always had a great experience.  But if you want something extremely special, rent the carriage house and let the excellent staff and managers do the rest.  You will not be disappointed.",5.0
"Pretty strong. The tight confines of entering through the bar area open up to a slightly more spacious back area with quite a few tables and the server to patron ratio is almost 1:1 which shocked me at first because you normally don't see that. However, it was a welcome site as we were constantly attended to but not hounded. The crostinis are fantastic. They're light and very tasty. Our favorite by far was the cremini mushroom and truffle oil one. I could probably eat just a few of those for my meal. My wife had the linguine with clams and I had the cavatelli with hot sausage and both were equally fantastic. The great thing about this restaurant that they've really got right is that the pasta is all homemade which makes for a satisfying pallet and nothing is too heavy. The restaurant is cute and quaint, however very tight on room throughout which became a headache as the night went on and they got more and more busy. It became difficult to move and even to leave. Their beer options aren't really that great and their wine is very over-priced. They did have my my wife's favorite wine but at more money than most Manhattan restaurants which is a turn off.SIDENOTE - they do accept credit cards now (sounds like business was hurting without it).",4.0

"I'll tailor my review as a response to the distillation of Yelp reviews on Frankie's 457.  I was there during lunch on a Saturday and it was not super crowded.I didn't think the waiters were mean, inattentive or too cool to wait on me.  The waiters that dealt with my table of 5 were pretty darn nice.  I liked how they all had the same jeans and t-shirt.The atmosphere is awesome.   Perfectly Brooklyn in beautiful Carrol Gardens.  Good looking people, babies, friendly faces and happy customers.The food ... this is what really matters: Phenomenal!  I wouldn't call this ""Italian food"" beyond the spread of the ingredients being considered of all-things-Italian.  This is New American style Italian food, somewhere between French techniques, Italian ingredients and Americans doing what Americans do to push the boundaries (think Napa wines and Pacific NorthWest espresso).  Portions were perfect and filling, even if they looked small (but not pretentiously small).  Everything was just excellent.  Someone in the kitchen is paying attention to absolutely everything.  We sat there and talked about the olive oil that accompanies the bread for a while - how often does that happen?!Because the food was so damn good, Frankie's 457 gets 5 stars.  They almost were a 4 yelp star restaurant, in my opinion, due to the bathroom.  This is where they got it all wrong.  Maybe they were trying to be cool?  I don't know, but here's my tip for all restaurateurs: don't make bathrooms cool, make it simple and clean; people come for the food, not the bathroom experience.  So what was ""all wrong"" with the bathroom?  Well, it wasn't that it was dirty (clean enough).  The lights were excessively dim - perhaps ""cool"" and dim.  That was annoying.  The faucets did not stay on - meaning they had to be kept turned or they would shut off.  Kind of like in bus terminals so water is not wasted.  That is unnecessary for a restaurant in Brooklyn.  The soap was excessively fragrant and most of the (lovely) food I ate kept smelling of flowerly soap.  To top it off, the bathroom didn't have a sign and waiting for it was extra annoying because we were in everyone's way.  Funny how my bathroom rant overshadows the food portion, but look at my rating: 5 stars.",5.0

"This review was for a group dinner. It was so underwhelming, I could shed a tear. And it was my birthday! And we spent a THOUSAND DOLLARS!

I thought I did an awesome job, until a couple who RSVP'd ""no"" showed up. Well normally - yay, I have more friends! At Frankie's? No. They were SO PUT OUT ABOUT IT. They made SUCH a big deal! They said we were disturbing the other patrons and putting undue strain on the kitchen. No welcome, not happy we were there - they were entirely put out about it, all the way up to the management. The last woman to come was the very first ever mayor on Foursquare at Frankie's. A total regular - and she was late because she was feeding her newborn. They insinuated that I should TURN HER AWAY. Excuse me? Finally, they reseated us outside. Fine. We all moved out. But the food. Ugh. I was told on the phone that I should chose between a 3- or 4-course *pre fixe* menu. When it came, it was *family style*, not choices. I wish I would have known that ahead of time. The food at Frankie's is VERY GOOD. But the service was VERY SLOW and people were very HUNGRY - and we kept having to track them down to ask for more wine. It was awkward. When we got moved, we were moved from a perfectly fine man inside to two women outside who were clearly not happy to have us moved out there. Then? It rained on us. We had to move again.

Frankie's was the perfect setting for a great conversation on a beautiful day.We opted to sit outside in the garden which was surprisingly big and they even have a separate carriage house that you can hire for private events. I had a peek inside and it has a beautiful dark wood bar and looks like it would be a great space for an anniversary or even a wedding reception!But let's get on to the good stuff: the food.  Italian cheeses, pastas, antipasti, sandwiches and salads (and a cute waiter!) they absolutely have something for everyone and they make a note smack bang on the menu that they only serve organic, local fare. Love that! Louise got the arugula and parmesan salad that looked incredibly fresh with vibrant greens and a healthy dose of shavings. She also got the eggplant crostini which looked delish. I had seen a chap earlier order the sausage broccoli rabe on foccacia so I opted for the same. Holy moly! It was BIG and so almighty good. I could only eat half but I'm shoveling in the rest right now as I type one handed.If you're not from Brooklyn - or Carroll Gardens - the F train is only 3 blocks away.

"i was visiting NYC and told my friend i wanted a meal in brooklyn before i left town. i forgot to specify williamsburg (thought it was implied) so we ended up at this dark, bougey restaurant. it was an older crowd, lots of people on dates, but i liked the ambiance despite it not being what i was going for.in terms of the food, it was average. the caesar salad ($9), the ricotta with speck crostini ($4.50), and the free bread were all delicious. my entree - the gnocchi marinara with fresh ricotta ($15) - was just okay. it paled in comparison to the amaaazing gnocchi i had eaten at rubirosa the night before.what gives them the 1 star rating was the service. i'm pretty easygoing in regards to service. i understand that people make mistakes and can be in bad moods and that there's a lot that can go wrong during a meal. but the attitude of our server was inexcusable. we sat at the bar and the first thing i said was ""ooh! our waiter is cute."" too bad he was also a complete DICK. we ordered our wine. it took 20 minutes to arrive. cool, whatever. then we sat there waiting to order our food. mind you, we are sitting DIRECTLY facing this guy who is behind the bar. he's fiddling with the ipod. HE FIDDLED WITH IT FOR 10 MINUTES. during this time, both me and my friend said multiple times ""excuse me, we are ready to order"". he glanced up once and looked at us...then kept fiddling with the ipod. FINALLY, he walks over. my friend is peeved and asks, ""did you not hear us?"" he replies super snarky, ""no, i did...all four times."" DUDE. WTF. he had the same snarky attitude all night and i felt like he was super patronizing. it's a shame that one employee can ruin a dining experience for two laidback girls just looking for a nice evening. i hope he's since been fired.",1.0
"I've been here twice.  The place is great, but they don't take reservations.  I am subtracting a star because nobody should have to wait an hour and a half for dinner.  I will never attempt Frankies on a Saturday ever again.  The menu has something for everyone, including vegetarians.  The gnocchi are maybe the best I've ever had.  The crostini are great.  Nice wine list.  Reasonable prices.  Service is a little pretentious.  I feel like the staff talk to you like you're lucky to be there.  Will definitely return, just maybe not on the weekend.",4.0

"We came here for dinner last Monday night. I had sort of low expectations, because we'd had an awful experience at Prime Meats (great food, REALLY awful and aloof service), and it's my understanding they're the same owner. But we had a great time.The menu is somewhat limited, but we enjoyed everything we ate.  To start, we got oysters (which were great, and we're picky about oysters), the ricotta and speck crostini (small, but really tasty).  My boyfriend got the meatballs which were really tasty and served with raisins and pine nuts. They weren't dried out all, although it might've been nice if they'd been served with a little bit of pasta or something so that you weren't just eating meatballs for dinner. I had the butternut squash ravioli and it was AMAZING -- seriously awesome flavor and texture, cooked perfectly, in a little bit of broth.We liked our server, who was friendly but not annoying. We got there around 7 and easily found a seat but it was PACKED by the time we left (as in had to step over people to get out). There were a few more tables with screaming children than I'd prefer (and that didn't really seem like the atmosphere they were going for), but I guess there isn't much they can do about that. I guess that this place, like Prime Meats, sort of depends on who you get as a server. The food is definitely awesome, we didn't have an aloof too-cool-for-school waitress this time, so it might depend who you get.",4.0
Great italian food and great space...perfect for a date or something.  Unfortunately long waits if you don't come early BUT they do make some great mixed drinks at the bar.  We ended up sharing the following 3 main dishes:-Meatball-sweet potato ravioli-Pasta dish with Sausage (forgot the name)All great dishes and very tasty.  I would definitely go back during the summer when the outdoor area is open.  The neighborhood is super cool also if you want to walk around the area to digest or find a place for desserts/drinks.,4.0
"Had a late brunch here with a friend and received pleasant service and yummy food. I wasn't a big fan of the bread, but was blown away by the creamy polenta with sausage and onions. Like buttah. My friend had very delicate-looking sweet potato ravioli in an equally gentle broth. It was like eating savort sweet potato pie. For dessert, I went with a very simple mascarpone with brandied cherries. I often secretly just want cheese for dessert despite my sweet tooth, so this was a welcome combination of my two favorite food groups. My friend had the ricotta cheesecake, which had a dryness that I loved, but she could have done without. Actual brunch items made up a very small list, and unfortunately none looked interesting.

I didn't mind the wait though because they made me a very heavy-on-the-champagne mimosa and we sat in their lovely ""back yard"" and soaked up the sun.The french toast is as good as people say. Tastes deep fried, like a doughnut. Mmmm.Also, the ricotta crostini was incredible.",4.0
"Come early it gets busy, they don't take reservations. Decent italian place with a homey, intimate vibe. Ricotta speck crostini was great as well as the lemon fettucini veggie bolognese. Octopus  dandelion salad was tender, sweet and well balanced with the bitter greens. Broccoli rabe and pork shank spaghetti were underwhelming.",3.0
"Frankie fed me sweet potato ravioli bobbing in Parmigiano-laced broth and I lapped it up. Silly on agnolotti, he refilled our glasses with prosecco whose bubbly charm far exceeded its $37 price tag.I'm helpless before him, a stupid grin on my face the whole time we're together. It could be the grapevine-bedecked globe string lights, and the pure white panna cotta doesn't hurt either.  I think I'm in love.",5.0
"I went here for a quick lunch with blogger extraordinaire, Louise from onlytheblogknowsbrooklyn…. Frankie's was the perfect setting for a great conversation on a beautiful day.We opted to sit outside in the garden which was surprisingly big and they even have a separate carriage house that you can hire for private events. I had a peek inside and it has a beautiful dark wood bar and looks like it would be a great space for an anniversary or even a wedding reception!But let's get on to the good stuff: the food.  Italian cheeses, pastas, antipasti, sandwiches and salads (and a cute waiter!) they absolutely have something for everyone and they make a note smack bang on the menu that they only serve organic, local fare. Love that! Louise got the arugula and parmesan salad that looked incredibly fresh with vibrant greens and a healthy dose of shavings. She also got the eggplant crostini which looked delish. I had seen a chap earlier order the sausage broccoli rabe on foccacia so I opted for the same. Holy moly! It was BIG and so almighty good. I could only eat half but I'm shoveling in the rest right now as I type one handed.If you're not from Brooklyn - or Carroll Gardens - the F train is only 3 blocks away. Super affordable ($30 for two!) but remember to bring cash only.  Seems to be the perfect spot for an early dinner or a long lunch.",5.0
"i was visiting NYC and told my friend i wanted a meal in brooklyn before i left town. i forgot to specify williamsburg (thought it was implied) so we ended up at this dark, bougey restaurant. it was an older crowd, lots of people on dates, but i liked the ambiance despite it not being what i was going for.in terms of the food, it was average. the caesar salad ($9), the ricotta with speck crostini ($4.50), and the free bread were all delicious. my entree - the gnocchi marinara with fresh ricotta ($15) - was just okay. it paled in comparison to the amaaazing gnocchi i had eaten at rubirosa the night before.what gives them the 1 star rating was the service. i'm pretty easygoing in regards to service. i understand that people make mistakes and can be in bad moods and that there's a lot that can go wrong during a meal. but the attitude of our server was inexcusable. we sat at the bar and the first thing i said was ""ooh! our waiter is cute."" too bad he was also a complete DICK. we ordered our wine. it took 20 minutes to arrive. cool, whatever. then we sat there waiting to order our food. mind you, we are sitting DIRECTLY facing this guy who is behind the bar. he's fiddling with the ipod. HE FIDDLED WITH IT FOR 10 MINUTES. during this time, both me and my friend said multiple times ""excuse me, we are ready to order"". he glanced up once and looked at us...then kept fiddling with the ipod. FINALLY, he walks over. my friend is peeved and asks, ""did you not hear us?"" he replies super snarky, ""no, i did...all four times."" DUDE. WTF. he had the same snarky attitude all night and i felt like he was super patronizing. it's a shame that one employee can ruin a dining experience for two laidback girls just looking for a nice evening. i hope he's since been fired.",1.0
"I've been here twice.  The place is great, but they don't take reservations.  I am subtracting a star because nobody should have to wait an hour and a half for dinner.  I will never attempt Frankies on a Saturday ever again.  The menu has something for everyone, including vegetarians.  The gnocchi are maybe the best I've ever had.  The crostini are great.  Nice wine list.  Reasonable prices.  Service is a little pretentious.  I feel like the staff talk to you like you're lucky to be there.  Will definitely return, just maybe not on the weekend.",4.0
"My friend's bf didn't believe us when we told him that this place serves the best BLT. She took him here once and he was sold. Thick, crispy bacon on a crunchy fococcia bread spread with a thin layer of mayo. I'm still not really quite sure why they only serve it at lunch, but that seems to be the reason why I only make it here during lunch time. They have great salads and great crostinis too. They also made one of the best cups of cappuccino I've had in New York, it even came donned with caffe art. This place is a beauty and their staff are a charm. The BK location has outdoor seating that I'd love to make use of very soon. I'm totally a fan of Frankies!",4.0
"We came here for dinner last Monday night. I had sort of low expectations, because we'd had an awful experience at Prime Meats (great food, REALLY awful and aloof service), and it's my understanding they're the same owner. But we had a great time.The menu is somewhat limited, but we enjoyed everything we ate.  To start, we got oysters (which were great, and we're picky about oysters), the ricotta and speck crostini (small, but really tasty).  My boyfriend got the meatballs which were really tasty and served with raisins and pine nuts. They weren't dried out all, although it might've been nice if they'd been served with a little bit of pasta or something so that you weren't just eating meatballs for dinner. I had the butternut squash ravioli and it was AMAZING -- seriously awesome flavor and texture, cooked perfectly, in a little bit of broth.We liked our server, who was friendly but not annoying. We got there around 7 and easily found a seat but it was PACKED by the time we left (as in had to step over people to get out). There were a few more tables with screaming children than I'd prefer (and that didn't really seem like the atmosphere they were going for), but I guess there isn't much they can do about that. I guess that this place, like Prime Meats, sort of depends on who you get as a server. The food is definitely awesome, we didn't have an aloof too-cool-for-school waitress this time, so it might depend who you get.",4.0
Great italian food and great space...perfect for a date or something.  Unfortunately long waits if you don't come early BUT they do make some great mixed drinks at the bar.  We ended up sharing the following 3 main dishes:-Meatball-sweet potato ravioli-Pasta dish with Sausage (forgot the name)All great dishes and very tasty.  I would definitely go back during the summer when the outdoor area is open.  The neighborhood is super cool also if you want to walk around the area to digest or find a place for desserts/drinks.,4.0
"Had a late brunch here with a friend and received pleasant service and yummy food. I wasn't a big fan of the bread, but was blown away by the creamy polenta with sausage and onions. Like buttah. My friend had very delicate-looking sweet potato ravioli in an equally gentle broth. It was like eating savort sweet potato pie. For dessert, I went with a very simple mascarpone with brandied cherries. I often secretly just want cheese for dessert despite my sweet tooth, so this was a welcome combination of my two favorite food groups. My friend had the ricotta cheesecake, which had a dryness that I loved, but she could have done without. Actual brunch items made up a very small list, and unfortunately none looked interesting.

"Oh man I made the trip alllll the way out to brooklyn. Ok it's not that far, but it is. I got a brief tour of the neighborhood before heading over the Frankies. Upon entering the small cozy establishment the host looked over and said he'd be back in a minute, he was and informed us it is about an hour wait but we could have a drink in the garden as we waited. So we went outside and got a drink and perched ourselves on a bench. It is a very pretty space outside, it if was like 15 degrees warmer I would have been completely happy. It was about an hour wait or so before they came and showed us to our table, which was also outside. With a quick look through the menu we got the antipasta and I got the gnocchi and he got the cavatelli. The antipasta was delicious and then the entrees came fairly quickly. The gnocchi was good, it was fresh in a simple red sauce. I tried some of the cavatelli with spicy sausage which was very good. The service was good and the food was great.  I just wish it was a little bit warmer!

"Everything about this restaurant is fantastic. First of all, it is a very cute, very Bklyn Heights/Carroll Gardens area-type restaurant (read-intimate and cozy). The food is wonderful. I always say that I am going to try something new, but I almost always revert back to my usual-Cavatelli with sausage and browned sage butter-it never disappoints. My boyfriend branches out a bit more than I do and has tried the paparadelle with braised lamb and the ribeye dish-he loved the braised lamb. This place also has a great wine list. My only compaint is that the wait can be really long on Friday and Saturday nights. You can sit and have a drink at the bar while you wait, but because it is such a small restaurant, it can be hard to find a spot there as well.",5.0
"stopped in after work on a monday, and despite the fantastic weather, only had to wait a couple minutes to get a romantic table in the back garden.  drinks were brought immediately, but then we had to wait a good 20 minutes to order food (hence the star docking).  however, after we ordered, things went very well. my friend and i split the escarole salad, which was wonderful - tangy, little bit of a bite, with walnuts and cheese.  then he had some cavatelli with sausage, which had just the right amount of bite to it.  i had the gnocci.  i (temporarily) renounced my veganism for that gnocci, and i don't regret it at all.  sweet, amazing fresh ricotta on top of a tomato sauce that, as my friend put it, ""tasted like it had been cooking for at least 15 hours.""  there's also this amazing dining room, converted out of an old stable, in the back garden.  a perfect place to have an engagement party, or post project celebratory dinner.  good job, frankie.",4.0

I've lived in Carroll Gardens for many years and in the 90s I was consistently making trips into the city , Williamsburg or Park Slope to meet friends for dinner. That was fine, but I was thrilled when places like Frankies opened up and since, friends from any hood enthusiastically make the trek here to meet me :D It's always busy at night, esp weekends, but lunch is just as lovely & delicious.

"We came to Frankie's because we wanted a nice dinner. My fiance had raved to me about their food and we have friends who had their wedding in the back room. I expected a lot. Apparently it was too much. My theory is that it may be in inconsistent cook, it's the only explanation for the ranges in flavor. We started with 3 different Crostini, you only get one piece of bread for each but having 3 to split was enough. The avocado and pesto was delicious, but I am a fiend for avocado so I'll love it however you feed it to me so long as it's ripe. The cannellini, caper, lemon and anchovy was odd b/c, well, there was no anchovy flavor, which would seem like a good thing right? It was actually very fresh tasting, not oily at all. But we had a third crostini, not sure which one, but it was actually kind of fishy! It just seemed backwards that a crostini that was not supposed to have seafood tasted like it did while the one with anchovies, which would be excused should it taste a little oceany, did not. We also shared ""Frankie's Antipasto"" which is a plate of cheese, cured meats and olives. The cheese was ""eh"" I've got better at home. The olives seemed pretty good, despite my not being a big olive fan. The prosciutto was really good, I could have had more of that. The two types of sausage were the odd men out on this plate, one sausage was nice, the other tasted rancid, we didn't finish it. But we labored on to our main course, hoping these small discrepancies were the exceptions. For our main course I really wanted to try the gnocchi but b/c I am often disappointed by gnocchi I agreed to the Sweet Sausage, Roasted Red Peppers & Onions Over Pine Nut Polenta. The only thing special about this dish was the polenta, it was really well done. The topping, however, was uninspired and a mash up of flavors. Although, I will say that I could see that dish being a great comfort dish in the winter. We also shared the Sweet Potato & Sage Ravioli in Parmesan Broth b/c people had been raving about it and it really does sound delicious. It wasn't our night to have a great dish. The ravioli seemed to be made out of wonton wrappers. I kid you not. The broth had hardly any flavor at all and tasted almost like luke warm water.  It was like a weird wonton soup. The ravioli stuffing was, however, very good. It's these random inconsistencies that don't make sense - some very good things and some very bad things. The service was fine. Our waitress tried to be helpful although she may need to re-review the wine list as her recommendation of the super dry nero d'avola for a fruity wine was a bit off the mark. As for the wait time - we knew there would be a wait at 7-ish on a Friday so we stopped by, gave the guy a cell phone and went down the street for a beer. The phone rang almost exactly 45 minutes later, which is how long he had told us the wait would be.So, there you go.  The restaurant appears to be an exercise in extremes.",2.0
"Hands down the most AMAZING Italian feast I have had ever! I ordered the sage and sweet potato raviolis in a tasty vegetable broth. They were so unbelievably delicious and full of fresh flavors. It was a nice change having them served in a light broth rather than a heavy cream or tomato sauce. I also ordered a side of the cauliflower, which was roasted in olive oil and served at room temperature. I had never had such a hearty and filling side of cauliflower in my life! The service was friendly but very slow unfortunately. We ordered the chocolate torte for dessert which was very chocolaty and perfect for sharing because it was rather rich. All in all this was a delightful and perfectly filling dinner. Anytime I am visiting Brooklyn this place will be a must for dinner!",5.0
"This was my third time at Frankies since it opened, and I'll add to the general consensus that it's a good neighborhood Italian restaurant in a neighborhood with a lot of good Italian restaurants. It's certainly not an Italian-American red sauce joint (not that there's anything wrong with those), and in fact, not much red sauce can be found at all. It's primarily bread-based food--Italian sandwiches, crostini, some very nice bread and oil greets you upon arrival. Soups, cured meats and cheese.The vibe is relaxed, comfortable, and warm. Love the gas lantern in the front window. Some of the food is quite good, some just ok. The chicken liver crostini is very good, so is the ricotta crostini with honey and black pepper. The lentil soup with bacon is also good (though my wife makes it better at home with chorizo). My meatball sandwich was a bit uninspiring.

"Oh man I made the trip alllll the way out to brooklyn. Ok it's not that far, but it is. I got a brief tour of the neighborhood before heading over the Frankies. Upon entering the small cozy establishment the host looked over and said he'd be back in a minute, he was and informed us it is about an hour wait but we could have a drink in the garden as we waited. So we went outside and got a drink and perched ourselves on a bench. It is a very pretty space outside, it if was like 15 degrees warmer I would have been completely happy. It was about an hour wait or so before they came and showed us to our table, which was also outside. With a quick look through the menu we got the antipasta and I got the gnocchi and he got the cavatelli. The antipasta was delicious and then the entrees came fairly quickly. The gnocchi was good, it was fresh in a simple red sauce. I tried some of the cavatelli with spicy sausage which was very good. The service was good and the food was great.  I just wish it was a little bit warmer! (There is nothing worse than being cold which trying to relax - maybe that's why my office is kept at a brisk 43 degrees so no one can relax all day)",4.0
"Everything about this restaurant is fantastic. First of all, it is a very cute, very Bklyn Heights/Carroll Gardens area-type restaurant (read-intimate and cozy). The food is wonderful. I always say that I am going to try something new, but I almost always revert back to my usual-Cavatelli with sausage and browned sage butter-it never disappoints. My boyfriend branches out a bit more than I do and has tried the paparadelle with braised lamb and the ribeye dish-he loved the braised lamb. This place also has a great wine list. My only compaint is that the wait can be really long on Friday and Saturday nights. You can sit and have a drink at the bar while you wait, but because it is such a small restaurant, it can be hard to find a spot there as well.",5.0
"stopped in after work on a monday, and despite the fantastic weather, only had to wait a couple minutes to get a romantic table in the back garden.  drinks were brought immediately, but then we had to wait a good 20 minutes to order food (hence the star docking).  however, after we ordered, things went very well. my friend and i split the escarole salad, which was wonderful - tangy, little bit of a bite, with walnuts and cheese.  then he had some cavatelli with sausage, which had just the right amount of bite to it.  i had the gnocci.  i (temporarily) renounced my veganism for that gnocci, and i don't regret it at all.  sweet, amazing fresh ricotta on top of a tomato sauce that, as my friend put it, ""tasted like it had been cooking for at least 15 hours.""  there's also this amazing dining room, converted out of an old stable, in the back garden.  a perfect place to have an engagement party, or post project celebratory dinner.  good job, frankie.",4.0

"Just thought I'd update and say Frankies is still my favorite neighborhood restaurant! I've lived in Carroll Gardens for many years and in the 90s I was consistently making trips into the city , Williamsburg or Park Slope to meet friends for dinner. That was fine, but I was thrilled when places like Frankies opened up and since, friends from any hood enthusiastically make the trek here to meet me :D It's always busy at night, esp weekends, but lunch is just as lovely & delicious. I swear I've never had a bad, or even mediocre, meal here.",5.0
"We came to Frankie's because we wanted a nice dinner. My fiance had raved to me about their food and we have friends who had their wedding in the back room. I expected a lot. Apparently it was too much. My theory is that it may be in inconsistent cook, it's the only explanation for the ranges in flavor. We started with 3 different Crostini, you only get one piece of bread for each but having 3 to split was enough. The avocado and pesto was delicious, but I am a fiend for avocado so I'll love it however you feed it to me so long as it's ripe. The cannellini, caper, lemon and anchovy was odd b/c, well, there was no anchovy flavor, which would seem like a good thing right? It was actually very fresh tasting, not oily at all. But we had a third crostini, not sure which one, but it was actually kind of fishy! It just seemed backwards that a crostini that was not supposed to have seafood tasted like it did while the one with anchovies, which would be excused should it taste a little oceany, did not. We also shared ""Frankie's Antipasto"" which is a plate of cheese, cured meats and olives. The cheese was ""eh"" I've got better at home. The olives seemed pretty good, despite my not being a big olive fan. The prosciutto was really good, I could have had more of that. The two types of sausage were the odd men out on this plate, one sausage was nice, the other tasted rancid, we didn't finish it. But we labored on to our main course, hoping these small discrepancies were the exceptions. For our main course I really wanted to try the gnocchi but b/c I am often disappointed by gnocchi I agreed to the Sweet Sausage, Roasted Red Peppers & Onions Over Pine Nut Polenta. The only thing special about this dish was the polenta, it was really well done. The topping, however, was uninspired and a mash up of flavors. Although, I will say that I could see that dish being a great comfort dish in the winter. We also shared the Sweet Potato & Sage Ravioli in Parmesan Broth b/c people had been raving about it and it really does sound delicious. It wasn't our night to have a great dish. The ravioli seemed to be made out of wonton wrappers. I kid you not. The broth had hardly any flavor at all and tasted almost like luke warm water.  It was like a weird wonton soup. The ravioli stuffing was, however, very good. It's these random inconsistencies that don't make sense - some very good things and some very bad things. The service was fine. Our waitress tried to be helpful although she may need to re-review the wine list as her recommendation of the super dry nero d'avola for a fruity wine was a bit off the mark. As for the wait time - we knew there would be a wait at 7-ish on a Friday so we stopped by, gave the guy a cell phone and went down the street for a beer. The phone rang almost exactly 45 minutes later, which is how long he had told us the wait would be.So, there you go.  The restaurant appears to be an exercise in extremes.",2.0
"Hands down the most AMAZING Italian feast I have had ever! I ordered the sage and sweet potato raviolis in a tasty vegetable broth. They were so unbelievably delicious and full of fresh flavors. It was a nice change having them served in a light broth rather than a heavy cream or tomato sauce. I also ordered a side of the cauliflower, which was roasted in olive oil and served at room temperature. I had never had such a hearty and filling side of cauliflower in my life! The service was friendly but very slow unfortunately. We ordered the chocolate torte for dessert which was very chocolaty and perfect for sharing because it was rather rich. All in all this was a delightful and perfectly filling dinner. Anytime I am visiting Brooklyn this place will be a must for dinner!",5.0
"This was my third time at Frankies since it opened, and I'll add to the general consensus that it's a good neighborhood Italian restaurant in a neighborhood with a lot of good Italian restaurants. It's certainly not an Italian-American red sauce joint (not that there's anything wrong with those), and in fact, not much red sauce can be found at all. It's primarily bread-based food--Italian sandwiches, crostini, some very nice bread and oil greets you upon arrival. Soups, cured meats and cheese.The vibe is relaxed, comfortable, and warm. Love the gas lantern in the front window. Some of the food is quite good, some just ok. The chicken liver crostini is very good, so is the ricotta crostini with honey and black pepper. The lentil soup with bacon is also good (though my wife makes it better at home with chorizo). My meatball sandwich was a bit uninspiring. Coke bottles imported from Mexico with real cane sugar rather than the corn syrup we get here. Good service, reasonable prices. I wouldn't make a special trip out of my way, but if you're local, Frankies should be on your once or twice a year Bklyn restaurant repertoire.",4.0

"Took the 6 train to Borough Hall and wandered through Caroll Hills to get to Frankie's 457.   I wondered if it was the 457th Frankies that existed, or perhaps rather they used the house address as the name.20 minute wait was decent and they had us sit out back by the bar.   The waiter then came up and asked if we wanted to sit inside or out and I had made the mistake of saying it didnt matter.....the seating was nice but it was cold!  I was surpirsed at the number of outdoor guests who were willing to sit through this.   Luckily I threw on another sweatshirt that I had and kept my hat on (even though its rude to eat dinner with your hat on, my momma says).  After looking through the chefs choice cheese and meat platter section I realize that my Italian cheese knowledge is limited!  I know gorgonzola, mozarella and provalone...but I didnt know Amalattea and Tallegio.  Chefs choice means the chef picks for you...he did pick Amalattea.   Chefs choice also included the sweet and spicey sopressata with a plate of nicely sauteed mushrooms but very bland brocolli which was more effective at presentation than taste.I ordered ravioli because I really wanted to try sweet potato stuffed ravioli...I am a big fan of sweet potatos in general.  It was served in a broth which is...the water where the ravioli is boiled in with a bit extra parmesane and cilantro.   Honestly it was average...the ravioli looked more like very thin asian dumplings.   The meatballs were tastey...and my mom, though she is Polish, cooks really good Italian meatballs with a veal, pork and beef combination and these were equivalent to hers.I realize after eating here, and not having seen an authentic Italian menu for some time (I dont go out to Italian restaurants often, and I havent been back to Italy in several years now) that I need to brush up on my cheese names and also Italian cuisine authenticity.  Is it possible that ravioli in a broth is the norm while our Americanized version tends to pour tomato sauce or cream over it?   I am still a relatively new yelper, and would like to better understand food preparation.  I dont consider myself a harsh critic, because I like being open minded, and negativism on my part to me means that I am not thinking outside the box enough.  However, I have been cooking my own meals for some years now, reading cookbooks, and understanding flavors and spices so I think I am a decent judge at this point.  I will look into this ravioli prep and hope to stop by a few more restaurants with  a thorough formaggio menu.",2.0

I don't even remember what I got, but I remember it was good and that I want to go back there. If you are looking for a relaxed spot to get Italian you should go here.Dreaded cash only",4.0
"Took the 6 train to Borough Hall and wandered through Caroll Hills to get to Frankie's 457.   I wondered if it was the 457th Frankies that existed, or perhaps rather they used the house address as the name.20 minute wait was decent and they had us sit out back by the bar.   The waiter then came up and asked if we wanted to sit inside or out and I had made the mistake of saying it didnt matter.....the seating was nice but it was cold!  I was surpirsed at the number of outdoor guests who were willing to sit through this.   Luckily I threw on another sweatshirt that I had and kept my hat on (even though its rude to eat dinner with your hat on, my momma says).  After looking through the chefs choice cheese and meat platter section I realize that my Italian cheese knowledge is limited!  I know gorgonzola, mozarella and provalone...but I didnt know Amalattea and Tallegio.  Chefs choice means the chef picks for you...he did pick Amalattea.   Chefs choice also included the sweet and spicey sopressata with a plate of nicely sauteed mushrooms but very bland brocolli which was more effective at presentation than taste.I ordered ravioli because I really wanted to try sweet potato stuffed ravioli...I am a big fan of sweet potatos in general.  It was served in a broth which is...the water where the ravioli is boiled in with a bit extra parmesane and cilantro.   Honestly it was average...the ravioli looked more like very thin asian dumplings.   The meatballs were tastey...and my mom, though she is Polish, cooks really good Italian meatballs with a veal, pork and beef combination and these were equivalent to hers.I realize after eating here, and not having seen an authentic Italian menu for some time (I dont go out to Italian restaurants often, and I havent been back to Italy in several years now) that I need to brush up on my cheese names and also Italian cuisine authenticity.  Is it possible that ravioli in a broth is the norm while our Americanized version tends to pour tomato sauce or cream over it?   I am still a relatively new yelper, and would like to better understand food preparation.  I dont consider myself a harsh critic, because I like being open minded, and negativism on my part to me means that I am not thinking outside the box enough.  However, I have been cooking my own meals for some years now, reading cookbooks, and understanding flavors and spices so I think I am a decent judge at this point.  I will look into this ravioli prep and hope to stop by a few more restaurants with  a thorough formaggio menu.",2.0
"I really like this place. It's got a great location and yummy food. I went here once for brunch and got their challah french toast with fruit and syrup. Can't beat it!! It was pretty packed and even though it was a bit cool, the garden was in use. Next time I go back, I'd like to sit out there. It's got a nice little bit of flavor to it.",4.0
"Frankies 457 is Prime Meat's Italian brother. I've been a good 4-5 times and feel like I can write a review unlike some of these yahoos on yelp. Frankies is definitely one of those places that makes you feel warm and fuzzy on the inside and like you're getting an awesome deal that no one else knows about, but I know that's not the case, but nonetheless. Frankies makes solid good Italian food. I can't get enough of the (seasonal) pumpkin ravioli in Parmesan broth, god I'm salivating. Fluffy white pillows, sweet pumpkin swimming in a velvety parm soup with bits of parsley - YUM! Other suggestions: their salads are top notch as well as their soups Lamb Tagliatelle - ridiculous sausage and peppers - like grandmas and their drink menu is fabulous - try the Myrtle Berry prosecco drink Go and mange mange!

"After at least two years since my last visit, I'm happy to report that Frankie's 457 remains one of the best restaurants in Brooklyn.  In fact, if anything, my most recent experience rates as the most satisfying to date.We arrived at about 7:30 on a Saturday night--a notoriously difficult time to get a table just about anywhere--and Frankie's was no exception.  A crush of people hovered about the doorway, going in and out, muttering about the 90+ minute wait.  Famished and disheartened--but dead set on eating here after making the trek on a frigid mid-March night--I confronted the host, prepared for the worst.  ""Two?"" we inquired, not hopefully.  ""Let me see,"" he said, taking a quick walk through the dining room.  Amazingly, he returned with two menus and sat us immediately.  Bravo.  I felt truly blessed by our good fortune.Things got even better from there.  The service was friendly but not overly familiar, quick but never rushed, informed but not officious, and the food positively sublime.  The room was cozy and inviting as always, filled to near capacity but somehow not noisy, and we never felt as if we were dining on top of our neighbors, which I'd consider a minor miracle. The wine list is smart and relatively simple to navigate (provided you know the basics of some of lesser known Italian varietals) and we had a great inexpensive bottle of Montepulciano D'Abruzzo that paired wonderfully with the food.   And everything that came out of the kitchen was, quite simply, capital G great.  Starting with the crispy Sullivan Street Bakery bread, a smattering of olives and tangy extra virgin olive oil, and ending with a marvelously refined Tiramisu and Vanilla Panna Cotta, Frankie's delivers consistently on its promise of fresh, simply prepared Italian food.  The buffalo mozzarella in the arugula salad was the kind you dream about--milky and gorgeous--the white bean and escarole soup the kind you imagine your Fairy Italian godmother would make, loaded with parmesan and rich white beans, and the octopus salad firm and rich.  Pasta special entrees--Sage Ravioli and Cavatelli with Sausage were equally excellent.

Small place that packs quickly and despite an early evening had a 1 hour wait - so we ate at the bar. The menu is limited and portions smallish but the food was outstanding.  The gnocchi was excellent as was the cavatelli with sweet sausage. This is a great place for quick meal after work.,4.0
"Had my first experience here last night for my birthday dinner with my roommate.  We didn't have any wait, and the tables out back are very nice, except for a few mosquitoes buzzing around.  We waited awhile for our drinks and water to come, but our first waitress was pleasant (note that I said ""first"" because we experienced a variety of servers across the night).  We put in our order and waited patiently for our food. Food: The mushroom crostini was good, although kind of ridiculous considering that it is piled high on one piece of toast and could have really been split across two.  The lentil bacon soup was delicious, but I found the octopus salad to be a bit fishy for my taste (but I hate fish and my roommate didn't have a problem with it, so that's probably a personal thing).  The main dishes were both very good, I ordered the cavatelli and it was delicious.  For dessert we ordered the ricotta cheese cake and the prunes with mascarpone.  We then decided that both dishes felt like they were missing something (the cheesecake was dry and the prunes were soupy), so we decided to pour the mascarpone prunes over the cheesecake and found it to be much better than either dish on their own.  Service:  This is where things seem to fall apart.  There may possibly be a requirement for the servers to wear either thick framed glasses or a stupid hat in order to work here.  The hipster vibe across the servers was a little much for my taste, especially considering that the 2 servers that helped us after the first one was pulled to another section in the middle of our meal (seriously, why would management do that??) were really very blase and unfriendly.  Trying to place a second drink order forced me to flag the waitress down, and I felt like after our table got passed off to that waitress, that she really didn't care to deal with us.  The worst part was that my roommate asked our first waitress to put a candle in the dessert while I was up at the bathroom, and when the cake came, there was no candle.  He was more disappointed than I was and it definitely made us feel forgotten.I'd probably go back, but not for any kind of special dinner.  I'll have to store up my patience to deal with the service in order to enjoy the food, which really shouldn't be the case with a restaurant as well-known and commended as this one.",3.0

We hung out there and listened to great music while getting a nice pre-dinner buzz courtesy of the pleasant bartender.After about 1:45 we decided to march back across the street to Frankie's and hover - as to let them know, ""we're hungry, damnit!"" - We were greeted by the manager(?) - John - who apologized for the delay and let us know he was waiting for a table to clear. He graciously offered to buy us a bottle of wine. Of course we accepted.We were seated shortly thereafter and ordered two salads to share and a cheese appetizer. The first salad was their Roasted Beet & Avocado with Balsamic Vinegar. The beets were wonderful as were the avocado chunks. This is not a very innovative salad, but it is refreshing and flavorful. We also had the Fennel, Celery Root & Parsley with Sliced Red Onion, Lemon & Pecorino which was crisp, flavorful, and maybe even a bit spicy. The cheese was amazing. I had never had Stracciatella before. It's kind of a custardy mozzarella. Served with toasted crostini for dipping. Delicious.I had the House-Made Cavatelli with Faiccos Hot Sausage & Browned Sage Butter. It was wonderfully buttery and the cavatelli was perfect. The sausage could have been a little less dry, but the flavor was nice. Portion size looked small, but it was very filling.We ordered three desserts and none were good. The ricotta cheesecake was EXTREMELY dry and flavorless. The tiramisu was dry and covered in so much cinnamon it was hard to ingest. The best dessert was the wine soaked prune with mascarpone but even that was underwhelming. Stay away from the desserts. You don't want to leave this place on a bad note.Dinner for 5 was $125 (not including the comped bottle of wine of course) - Which was fine by me.

"In my quest to go out in Brooklyn more (go figure- I move to Manhattan, work in DUMBO so I split my time) I headed to Carroll Gardens to meet my BK friends for a bite. While we started at a few other places (reviews to come) we decided that dinner would be spent at Frankie's because ""the food is just Italian classic fantastic""---I'm sold.We walked in and since the place doesn't take reservations we had a 45 minute wait on our hands. No problem, we'll go across the street and check back. Oh wait---the host says---come sit at our new bar and we can come get you. So, right out of an episode of kitchen nightmares we walk through the back patio and into an empty kitchen being remodeled. Then enter the new bar, by the owner of Frankies---a Speakeasy restaurant set to open this spring. How fun! We waited there (for about 45 minutes to the tee) sipping on cocktails---note they do NOT serve vodka here because during the ""era"" of the restaurant vodka was not around. Hmm...OK good thing I'm not drinking this month b/c if I want a cocktail that's what I get. Enter back to Frankies for dinner where we ordered a small antipasti plate, munched on some great bread and ordered our various pasta dishes. Gnocchi was to die for in a red sauce. Add in some good conversation to a cozy atmosphere of Brooklyn plus dark wood furnishings and you have yourself a fantastic dinner for 4.",4.0

"This is Italian food on steroids. Beautiful and candlelit, it's the perfect date spot. The wine list is extensive with a good variation in pricing so you're not breaking the bank for your buzz. The menu is chock full of fresh, interesting options that will please the most complex or basic palate. We went with the broccoli rabe (perfectly cooked), the polenta (butter), and for my entree I chose the homemade gnocchi with dreamy ricotta. I tasted a few bites of the braised pork shank and was instantly bummed/jealous so if I go back that would be my first choice.

"I love Frankie's 457!It's a great place to go on a date, out with friends and family, etc...it's cozy and comfortable.  My friend and I, this is our spot to just catch up, eat some olives, yummy bread with olive oil and of course the vino.  They have a great wine list.  The crostinis are delicious and well as their different dishes.   My only grip is they don't take credit cards...so bring cash.",5.0
"I've been here a number of times and have never once been anything less than pleased. The pastas are always cooked perfectly and the wine and cocktail list are great. This is the kind of place to go family-style and you're going to miss out if you just order one dish for yourself. Don't skimp on the sides, the veggies are always fantastic. So why not give them 5 stars? 1. They don't take reservations for parties less than 6 which is a bummer since they are always packed. 2. The frustration of cash only establishments.3.

"We had a fabulous dinner here with friends about a month ago but because of the quantity of wine consumed I wasn't sure if the food was as spectacular as I thought - or if I was experiencing the restaurant through wine-goggles. We went back for brunch on Sunday on the early side, which was smart since we left the line was long, and had a lovely meal.  Nothing revolutionary, but totally solid.The frittata was fresh, the service prompt, and while I was trying to eat healthy I was making a mental list of all things I want to order next time (aka: French toast, and the mozzarella panini).Be sure to ask for bread on the table, the olive oil that comes with it is near perfection.",4.0
"In my quest to go out in Brooklyn more (go figure- I move to Manhattan, work in DUMBO so I split my time) I headed to Carroll Gardens to meet my BK friends for a bite. While we started at a few other places (reviews to come) we decided that dinner would be spent at Frankie's because ""the food is just Italian classic fantastic""---I'm sold.We walked in and since the place doesn't take reservations we had a 45 minute wait on our hands. No problem, we'll go across the street and check back. Oh wait---the host says---come sit at our new bar and we can come get you. So, right out of an episode of kitchen nightmares we walk through the back patio and into an empty kitchen being remodeled. Then enter the new bar, by the owner of Frankies---a Speakeasy restaurant set to open this spring. How fun! We waited there (for about 45 minutes to the tee) sipping on cocktails---note they do NOT serve vodka here because during the ""era"" of the restaurant vodka was not around. Hmm...OK good thing I'm not drinking this month b/c if I want a cocktail that's what I get. Enter back to Frankies for dinner where we ordered a small antipasti plate, munched on some great bread and ordered our various pasta dishes. Gnocchi was to die for in a red sauce. Add in some good conversation to a cozy atmosphere of Brooklyn plus dark wood furnishings and you have yourself a fantastic dinner for 4.",4.0

"This is Italian food on steroids. Beautiful and candlelit, it's the perfect date spot. The wine list is extensive with a good variation in pricing so you're not breaking the bank for your buzz. The menu is chock full of fresh, interesting options that will please the most complex or basic palate. We went with the broccoli rabe (perfectly cooked), the polenta (butter), and for my entree I chose the homemade gnocchi with dreamy ricotta. I tasted a few bites of the braised pork shank and was instantly bummed/jealous so if I go back that would be my first choice.

Decided to give this spot a go but was apprehensive after reading the negative staff reviews...not sure if it was just our night or whether they've taken note and improved things since obtaining the feedback below but i have to say the service was great and my lamb entree was out of sight and less than $20! Special mention should go to the woman on hostess duties ~ 1 week ago. There was no shortage of people queuing for a table and she was very attentive and considerate of all parties-providing updates and courteous check-ins with everyone waiting so as to ensure them they were being considered. Her service in particular set my mind at ease in knowing I came to the right spot and that everything else was likely to follow in the same vein. Sure enough it did. I left extremely satiated and didn't break the bank. Why go to Manhattan and drop $150 on a dinner for 2 when budget fine dining like this is available in BKLN?A more spacious setting would have earned the 5th star for me-although its not the reason to pass on this placeI'll be back:),4.0

While the escarole and iced coffee were very tasty, the meatballs in the tomato based sauce  had a sour vinegar taste. The polenta was more like a soupy, bland cup of grits. I had to add extra virgin and Romanoto get any taste at all.

My boyfriend and I came on a Friday night around 7:30 and were happy that we received a table withing 20 min. The atmosphere of this place is great - perfect lighting, cozy seating, and a great backyard seating under a tent.A wedding party was also going on in another outdoor area and didn't interrupt from the romantic mood of our dining at all. The food was excellent and perfect portions. We had two different types of pasta, a crostini and then the tiramisu for dessert. The house wine is very reasonably priced and not bad.I would recommend Frankies as a great date spot in Brooklyn!",4.0
"I am still thinking about the braised octopus salad!!!! I have to go back, everything we had was absolutely out standing.... even the very simple sandwich i had was great. This place does get crowded so be prepared to wait, it's so worth it.",5.0
"I had Frankie's at a catered event in Brooklyn.  It was the best pasta I've had since my time in Florence...gnocchi was unbelievable.  I'm just glad I was passing through from Chicago - otherwise, I would be a very large, regular patron.  Though I can't rate the restaurant experience, I highly recommend it for any catered event.",5.0
Good but not quite worth the price for what it is. Also way too loud on a Wednesday night to enjoy a meal. Great beers. Limited menu selection. Tomato salad was delicious.,3.0
"Just had a delicious meal here.  The salads were great, and my husband had some kind of cheese ball that was yummy.  The pastas were homemade and good.  It is nouvelle italian.  Arrive early to get a table since they don't accept reservations.",5.0
"E have the cookbook, so went in with high expectations.  Atmosphere was great, staff was friendly and responsive.  The food?  Well, the escarole and canellini bean soup was a little bland, as was the sauce on the eggplant.  The mushroom and truffle oil croustade was great.  Both entrees, the cavatelli with hot sausage and the house made linguini with lava beans were ok (the hot sausage was terrific).  In short, we didn't get the flavor experience we were hoping for, but are glad we tried it.",3.0
Decided to give this spot a go but was apprehensive after reading the negative staff reviews...not sure if it was just our night or whether they've taken note and improved things since obtaining the feedback below but i have to say the service was great and my lamb entree was out of sight and less than $20! Special mention should go to the woman on hostess duties ~ 1 week ago. There was no shortage of people queuing for a table and she was very attentive and considerate of all parties-providing updates and courteous check-ins with everyone waiting so as to ensure them they were being considered. Her service in particular set my mind at ease in knowing I came to the right spot and that everything else was likely to follow in the same vein. Sure enough it did. I left extremely satiated and didn't break the bank. Why go to Manhattan and drop $150 on a dinner for 2 when budget fine dining like this is available in BKLN?A more spacious setting would have earned the 5th star for me-although its not the reason to pass on this placeI'll be back:),4.0
"Another one I don't get. Why do people love this place? The garden is nice. Er, that's it. The food is meh. Nice ingredients assembled on a plate isn't quite the same as cooking. I can source decent sausage and salad at home for a fraction of the cost. When they do actually cook something it's just OK. Staff act like it's a big deal to eat here, and so by the looks of the reviews so do the diners. Why I don't know. It's not that it's bad it's just that it's really not that good.",2.0
"I just don't know what to say about Frankie's. These folks were on top of their game when they first opened up, except for lackadaisical service.  Now, they're just plain mediocre. As per usual, I went for lunch. I ordered escarole soup, meatballs with a side of polenta, and an iced coffee. While the escarole and iced coffee were very tasty, the meatballs in the tomato based sauce  had a sour vinegar taste. The polenta was more like a soupy, bland cup of grits. I had to add extra virgin and Romanoto get any taste at all. I really hope they get back their gusto.  Like I said they were in their game when they first opened up.As always the service was polite but slow. Frankie's house EVOO is one of the better ones I've had. .",2.0
"Frankie's is by far my favorite restaurant in New York.This is the place where friends call me when theyare there and i will give them a whole list of what to orderfrom apps to dessert.  My recommendations:Alovini Cabinico wine buffalo mozzarella & arugula salad (the mozz is making me drool just typing about it!)ricotta & provolone crostinicavatelli with sausage & sage butter (will change your life)squash & yam ravioli (don't be shy about finishing the broth)red wine prunes with mascarpone for dessert (these are NOT your grandma's prunes!)That is just dinner. For brunch you can't go wrong anyway you look at it.  The BLT is phenomenal and only available during lunch and brunch time.  Very warm and cozy, no-frills atmosphere. There is also a cool stable out back that you can rent for private shindigs. No reservations so you have to be a little patient when planning a trip.  But Frankie's is always well worth the wait!",5.0
"this place is out of control delicious *and* i love everything about the decor - everything is just pitch perfect. it's really romantic and i love that the food is not only tasty but also very local. i don't have much to add to what others have said..enjoyed the cheese plate, the gnocchi, my husband enjoyed his sausage pasta. the experience of drinking a pimm's cup, eating some amazing food and sitting outside on a nice summer night was just really, really nice.",5.0

"Clearly this place is mad hyped. My review is hardly going to make a dent, but I thought I should throw out my two cents anyway:The wait. Is. Just as ridiculous. As everyone says.

I would have stayed for the delicious-looking desserts but our server didn't even offer after we finished our entrees (which, by the way, were totally dank).Overall, probably won't be back if I'm in any sort of hurry to eat.",3.0
Went here about 9:30 on a friday night and got seated in 5 minutes. Service was pretty good and food came out quickly- which was nice because we were hungry at that point.

"Went with two Yelp friends to this renowned carroll gardens spot.  I think we were all a little underwhelmed, considering everything we'd heard.  We shared 3 cheeses and a teeny crostini, and although all of them were flavorful, the portion sizes were quite small (each cheese was about 3-4 bites' worth).  We ordered tagliatelle, pork chop stuffed with sausage, and yam and squash ravioli.  While everything was solidly good, nothing was really special.  My pork chop was a little stringy / veiny, and hard to chew through at points.  The ravioli itself was delicious, but it came swimming in a less than appealing pea-green broth.  The tagliatelle was soft and fresh, but I only had a bite so I can't really vouch for it.Overall, very...average.",3.0

"We went here last night for dinner, after hearing so many great things about the place and checking out all the raves on yelp.  We were excited to get seated right away, even though it was a Fri night.  The place was humming but the outside terrace was open so that left a few tables open inside.  I like the ambience Inside, high ceilings, mood lighting, etc.  after sitting for about ten mins a tall, blond waiter came to get our water preference, though by this point we were also ready to order our wine.  But he went off and after another ten minutes came by and we ordered the house red, a montepulciano.  When the wine came we were ready to order but he actually held up a finger (as in one minute please) and ran off.  Sorry, didn't realize I was inconveniencing you ;). So we sat back, said cheers and took a sip of our wine - which smelled like nail polish remover and tasted awful.  It must have turned.  We waited and waited and a totally different person, a young lady, came to get our order.  We told her about the wine, she sniffed it and agreed something was wrong and took it away (still unable to place our order btw).  Ten minutes later the tall blond waiter came by with the wine list and his suggestions.  We were confused, we thought the house red had just gone bad but he told us it was a lovely bottle and that's just how it tastes.  Um, ok.  So we selected and a few minutes later he brought us the wine but again, didn't stick around to get our order.  We were getting v hungry and anxious to put our order in.  A little while later the waitress who had taken our yucky wine away and to get our order.  We ordered the mushroom and truffle oil crostini and roasted vegetable salad as apps to share, I got the linguini with fava beans and my friend got the cavatelli with sausage.  30 mins later and still no food.  At this point we noticed the couple behind us (who were seated after us) were digging into their salads.  We waited more.  At this point we had finished our glass of wine and still no appetizer (and we are not fast drinkers!). About 45 mins after ordering (which was almost an hour and a half after being seated!) a third member of the waitstaff bring over a green salad - not the one we ordered.  We told her it wasn't ours and asked if we could please get some bread and more wine.  This third waitress was gracious enough to apologize for the mix up and to bring us a round of wine on the house.  That was nice, we ate our bread to stave off the hunger and continued to wonder about our food.  Well, I think we ended up eating at 10:30pm, when one single crostini came out.  It would have been nice if the waitstaff had explained that we would have one small piece to share and perhaps we should order more than one.  The roasted vegetable salad was good.  When our pastas finally arrived I think I had hit that point where you have been hungry for so long that the hunger goes away, you know what I mean?  My linguini was overdone and mushy.  I wasn't impressed.  My friend enjoyed the cavatelli but it wasn't anything amazing.  The whole experience though?  Abysmal.  There are many places in the same hood where I could have had same quality food with a far better dining experience.  I probably won't go back.  It's hard to say they just had an off night, too many things went wrong, so I wouldn't recommend this place to other.",2.0

I strongly recommend the mushroom crostini, which was light and fragrant, and the farro wheat in parmesan sauce - piping hot and equally delicious. For my entree, I had the sweet potato ravioli, which came and went very quickly. I was most impressed by the fact that Frankies does not attempt to overwhelm you with food.

"Let me start by saying that Frankie's doesn't get a 4th star mainly because of what happened when we walked in the door.  I had the night off and met my mom and her husband for dinner.  I decided on Frankie's because my step-dad is a ridiculously picky eater and my general rule for him is, ""when in doubt go with Italian or steak.""  We walked in the door around 5:15, I noticed a 40-year old guy on a razor scooter with his family...um, okay.  We stand there for about 30 seconds, no one comes to greet us...I begin to bristle.  Another 30 or so seconds go by, and still no one has come to greet us, or tell us how long the wait might be or even ask me to move as I inched along the wall by the bar.  I walk over to the pass...and wait.  A disinterested little bald-headed waiter comes over and asks if we've been helped, I tell him no and he says, someone will be right with us and then disappears to run food.  I don't trust him, considering more than two minutes have gone by and no one has said shit to me.  Look, I know restaurants are busy, I get that.  But when anyone...anyone walks into a restaurant, they should be greeted by someone, anyone; the manager, a server, a busboy, the fucking dishwasher, I don't care; and they should be greeted inside of a minute, hell 30 seconds.  Someone needs to make you feel welcome when you walk into a restaurant, period.  No one made us feel welcome when we walked into Frankie's and to say it pissed me off would be an understatement.  After that, their ""tasty"" food just didn't taste all that great to me.  The beet and avocado salad was decent, but not great; the arugula and buffalo mozzarella salad was, again, decent; I got the cavatelli with sausage.  The cavatelli were dense and the browned sage butter that was supposed to be the sauce had no real discernible taste.  My mother raved about the ravioli being the lightest she's ever had, but the dough was rolled thin, so I would hope so.  Her husband liked his bolognese, but thought the sauce was little watery...which it was.  In short, everything was okay.  I'll probably go back again and give them another shot, but I'll say this much: if I walk in there and wait more than sixty fucking seconds before someone speaks to me, Frankie's will be dead to me...",3.0
"Frankie's is pretty awesome. Better for lunch or dinner than brunch, but really just a great place. They have 3 different dining areas -upfront next to the bar/kitchen (kind of noisy, a lot of action with waiters running to seat people/people waiting to be seated), outdoor backyard-beautiful at night lit with Christmas lights, and a more private backroom that seems like a garage turned into dining space (much quieter back here). So depending on where you sit I feel you can have a very different experience. The food is mostly small portions, but great for sharing. Nice salad selection and amazing buffalo mozzarella that practically melts in your mouth. The cheese plates in general are delicious and wine can be ordered in a half carafe. Even their house wine (only $5 a glass) goes down smooth. The bread is always fresh, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, I always wind up asking for more. They serve it with their own brand of olive oil which is of a very high quality and for purchase. Their homemade pasta with Bolognese sauce actually tastes-homemade! The sandwiches are on tasty rosemary bread and they use meat from Faicco's (great Italian butcher shop where the locals buy their meat). They don't take reservations and it gets way too crowded on a weekend night so a better bet is on the off times if you don't want to wait. Also they don't have regular drip coffee, it's more like espresso, so keep that in mind, because it is strong/bitter if you are not prepared.",5.0
"This place was fantastic. I loved the rustic feel and friendly waiters, in addition to the casual ambiance. I strongly recommend the mushroom crostini, which was light and fragrant, and the farro wheat in parmesan sauce - piping hot and equally delicious. For my entree, I had the sweet potato ravioli, which came and went very quickly. I was most impressed by the fact that Frankies does not attempt to overwhelm you with food. The waitress gave the two of us three medium pieces of country-style bread with an incredible house olive oil, not a basket of raw dough like you'd receive at most cheap Italian eateries. The ravioli were just enough to keep me full, and the appetizers were similarly appropriately sized.",5.0

"I actually want to give them 3.5 stars.I used to go to Frankie's about once a week (sometimes once for dinner, once for brunch) for the past couple of years (my ex-boyfriend lives around the corner).  So, I've been here a lot.  My god it's frightening how much the Franks got from me (or, thankfully, my ex!)... I probably could have had a nice trip to the Maldives, considering the number of crostini, Vodka limeades, and prunes I've consumed at this place!Frankie's was spectacular as a neighborhood restaurant.  It was great to pop over and get a some crostini, a good salad, a great sandwich, and some decent wine.  Or for brunch, for the fabulous French toast.  But, as the Franks' star has risen, the dining experience just got progressively more frustrating with the crowds and the long waits.  Basically, yes, Frankie's serves very good, very solid food.  But it's not worth the crazy waits that their popularity have brought forth.  Over the many, many meals I've had at Frankie's, the food was always very consistently good.  And, the menu is also remarkably consistent.  They make some claim about local and seasonal, but there haven't been huge changes since 2005, when I first started eating there.  There have been a couple dishes that have been disappointing-- most often vegetarian pastas and occasionally salads-- but the menu and preparation is solid.  What's not consistent is the service.  The waitstaff can be extremely uneven.  Some are great, others rarely will refill glasses or ask if you want another drink (hello... um, please take my $12 for a glass of wine!), or leave you hanging at brunch when all you want is to get a cup of coffee asap before ordering.  And other mishaps.  These problems happen a lot more than they should considering the level Frankies is supposedly at.If they are seating in the garden when the weather is nice, or the carriage house, go there.  It's much nicer, although again, sometimes the service suffers out there. In all, I'd recommend hitting Frankie's for a weekday lunch, when it will be calm, and you can enjoy it.  Or go for a very late dinner, when the place has cleared out.  As much as I enjoy the avocado & beet salad, some of the crostini, and especially the lamb ragu, I wouldn't deal with the crowds or the attitude from 6-10 pm.NB, the French toast is better at Frankie's than at Prime Meats.

"First off, I really wanted to love this place. It gets 2 stars for the appetizers, which were lovely. We were greeted on a Sunday early evening to a lovely host. We sat in the back patio with our 15 month old. There were 4 other families there with young kids, so it seemed perfect.We ordered our meals and some pasta for the babe.Pasta and our appetizers (bruscetta and salad) arrived quickly, as did the lovely wheat beer. Things were going well. Food was great, service great. We're enjoying watching the babe chow down on the pasta. I finish my beer, I see others around us leave, we're chatting, then the bus boy asks if we would like a box for the pasta - umm no, we'd like our meals. Oh okay he says. 10 min go by - babe is now out of the high chair dancing with other little kids. Our waiter is there, seems to be enjoying or fake enjoying the dancing...um where's the meal. So, after 50 min from when we sat down, I ask the waiter - do you know when our meals are coming? Oh you haven't received your meal - let me check. This was sadly the last time that I heard our waiter's lovely Italian accent. 15 min later and me asking 2 other people where our meals are I receive an obviously broiled eggplant (burnt cheese, cool in the middle) 8 min after that my husband receives a steak that was pretty good, but couldn't enjoy it because I couldn't consume my food and we'd been there an hour and 15 min. and a kid isn't going to last that long. I wanted to complain to someone, but the waiter never came back and the host disappeared as well. The only one that would talk to us was the bus boy and I didn't want to put the blame on him. Obviously they forgot to place the entree order.  left the place 10 min before my husband because the babe was done.and so are we with this place that has so much potential. It only needs to fire everyone but the bus boy and start over.",2.0
"Consistently delicious food at this great date spot.  The ambiance is charming - the F lumbering by above ground, edison bulbs and exposed brick harken to another era - and the smallish menu is perfectly curated.  Favorites include the roasted beet & avocado salad, the roasted vegetables, sausage onions & peppers over polenta, & the cavatelli. Their bread (made by Sullivan Street Bakery,I believe) is addictive as well. Lovely all around.",5.0

"I'd heard that Frankie's 457 was great but my experience was anything but.  Our waiter, while polite, had an attitude which was a little too cool for my liking and didn't exhibit any enthusiasm whatsoever.  He also didn't write down our order, which would've been fine, had he not had to come back two minutes later to ask me to repeat to him what I'd ordered.  What I did eat, an eggplant sandwich, was good but nothing great.  My friend's gnocci was a big disappointment as it was hard and sort of gluey at the same time.  The huge outdoor seating area is a big plus but the lackluster food and service mean that I won't be coming back.",2.0
"Frankie's 457 has been a favorite in my family since it opened. Whenever I'm visiting home, this is a spot my parents and I are sure to go to. The food is always fresh and consistently delicious. My parents are huge fans of the crostinis (especially the mushroom and ricotta varieties) and I love the escarole salad and ravioli. We've gone out to dinner here a couple of times, but I generally prefer lunch. It's much easier to get seated and the menu is actually a little bit larger (the BLT, which is only served during the day, is mind blowing!) Meals can get a little expensive however, if you have a couple of appetizers and drinks, and they do only accept cash. The service is always great though, and the interior is gorgeous. I highly recommend Frankie's!",5.0

We went here on a reccomendation from local friends. We walked in on a late Sunday night  with no reservation and were seated right away. Our server was warm and welcoming.

Among the best examples of this style of food are the meatballs -- both as a sandwich as one of their ""specials"" -- and the sausage, onions and peppers served over polenta.   Also strong, but more elegant, is the squash (or is it sweet potato? pumpkin?) and sage ravioli in a parmesan broth.  You'll want extra bread to sop up all that liquid.  Disappointing, at least on our most recent visit, was the cavatelli with spicy sausage.  It is served in a brown butter and sage sauce that just lacked punch.   The lamb and papardelle was uneven -- tasty, braised lamb and soft pasta ribbons in a sauce that was slightly watery and lacking something.  On the other hand, we tried virtually every crostini and couldn't really find a major weakness.  And vegetable antipasti -- roasted cauliflower and sweet carrots -- were excellent.Frankie's is a place to which you'll want to return -- so many things to taste, and so many wines and cocktails to try.  Although the bar area is very tight, with little room to wait for tables to open, it's still the type of place you go to be comfortable.",4.0

The cheese was great, the veggies, interesting and the meat perfectly sliced and presented. My entree was sausage and peppers over polenta, great seasoning and texture.

"There has been a lot of buzz about Frankie's 457 on Court Street in Carroll Gardens and I was really excited to eat there for the first time recently. The menu looks great - big pasta section, interesting crostini options, descriptive cheese selection and cured meats.

My mushroom crostini was tasty - one piece of bread stacked high with mushrooms for $3 and my homemade cavatelli was texturally appealing but not incredibly flavorful.

"Never had a bad dish.  I love those crostini's, but order more than 1 because you'll want it.  I especially enjoy the roasted eggplant one.

Next, we had two yummy crostinis -- the ricotta and aged provolone.  So fluffy and creamy.  And, the avocado pesto -- also really good.  Then, we dined on their famous meatballs.  A must. The kids enjoyed the linguine with fava beans and gnocchi with ricotta and marinara.  I ravished the savory eggplant and mozzarella sandwich that made me weak in the knees. So delicious!

"I recently went to Frankie's for dinner and brunch all in the same weekend. I really enjoyed both meals. For dinner, we started with a cheese plate and left it up to the waitress to choose which cheese to include. She gave us a great variety. Our main courses consisted of very tasty fresh pasta and an eggplant sandwich that was just great. It seems like the thing to get at brunch is the french toast. Thats what I got, and I definitely recommend it. One of my favorite things about the restaurant is the outside seating area in the 'backyard'. This would be a really nice place to sit while on a date or with a group of friends.",4.0
"Frankie's is great for dinner, lunch AND brunch.",4.0
"This place is great, classy, simple, and delicious.  I like the light bulbs, haha.  The staff is friendly and casual.They have a rear room that you go through a courtyard to get to, and you can see it from the main restaurant;  I've never been in but my friend had his wedding reception there, and everyone said it was fantastic.  So, ask about their back room if you want a good location for a low-key private event.",4.0
"Great place in the neighborhood.  It definitely gets crowded, but the little bar and seating area up front can usually accommodate.  Nothing too fancy or out of the ordinary, but everything is done well.  My last time here I had their linguine with fava beans and toasted bread crumbs and it was fantastic.  Their meatballs are good too.",4.0
"Ive been to dinner and brunch here, and would never go back for lunch. They serve everything room temperature (menu did warn me, but who knew it would taste bad?)....which basically tastes as if they made it in the early morning and schleping it out as orders come in. Dinner however was better-- despite the long wait, cash only, and...again, the long wait.  Luckily they do have a very nice backyard, bar, and wine selection.  I'd recommend all of the crostinis, the cured meat tasting, and wow the meatballs.",3.0
"we ordered the gnocchi, tagliatelle, pate (chicken liver), bruschetta w/ricotta and honey, $3 for the one and only bruschetta i think is expensive, the gnocchi was good but not better than my grandma's, the tagliatelle was good but the sauce tasted like chef boyardee for some reason, also very liquid, will almost let the ragu flavor disappear. we also order 2 glasses of red wine, but the server instead of pouring a little for us to smell and taste he just pour the glasses and wander off, that person needs some training to do. we also order the ricotta cream cheese, not the best i had, the crust was not meant for that cheesecake, and was heavy instead of airy and fluffy. decor was nice but that can only do so much.",2.0
"We had a group scheduled for the outdoor patio where there is plenty of room.  First, several of the wait staff gave several individuals in our party that they were doing us the greatest of favors by seating us together.  Next, and unbeknownst to us they turned down several of our party at the front door who arrived later, despite space availability.   This place used to be great and the food seems good still, but we won't be back; too popular for their own good now and apparently no incentive to be hospitable anymore.",1.0
"One of the best meals I've had in the city in quite awhile, and relatively inexpensive as well.  Worth the trip out and twice on Sundays.",5.0
"Oh baby!  I know they don't need any more rave reviews; but Frankie's definately deserves them.I've been here a handful of times since moving to the area about a month ago and am already planning this weekends visit.  Break it down...-crostinis:  chewy and yet crunchy with fresh and ample toppings.  I've tried them all and have to recommend the cremini mushroom with truffle oil.  The ricotta with provolone is a close second.-Meatball sandwich:  the bread makes it!-The cavatelli was great.  I didn't think that brown butter could be improved; but the sage adds a little extra zip.  The sausage wasn't spicy enough.-The chocolate tart was simple and great.  At five bucks it's hard to go wrong.-The wine list is great.  I should point out that we always order the 500 ml carafe of montepulciano for $11 (best deal on court street...maybe).If you're looking for great price points on simply executed Italian dishes served by down to earth people, go to Frankies.  If you want deconstructed molecular gastronomical delights at exorbanant prices served by waiters in ties, go elsewhere.",5.0
"Looking for arrogant, pretentious service? Frankie's 457 in Brooklyn tops any dining spot I've frequented in NYC, the rest of the USA, or Italy. Want some Anglo waiter to pretend he doesn't understand your pronunciation of gnocchi or tiramisu? You've come to the right place. It's a shame the wait staff resorts to insults to make up for an outer borough inferiority complex because the setting is extremely simpatico and the food extremely good.",2.0

Terriffic.  Very comfortable and not at all uptight and with very yummie food.  The wine list is fantasitc.  The server was knowledgable and friendly.  The munchy-bits were delicious (especially the cheese).  And the view out back of the elevated F train rolling by was charming.  Very romantic.  I've been realizing that I only write reviews of places that I hate because I'm motivated to warn others to stay away.  I'm going to try to make more of an effort to praise the folks who get it right--Frankie's gets it right.,4.0

"If you like dark wood, thick French Toast and the occasional star-sighting with your Latte, go here. Great location, the opposite direction that most Manhattanites walk when slumming it in Carroll Gardens. While not a ton of edible offerings for a vegetarian, it's a great Sunday brunch spot. If you want a little peace and quiet, get there when the doors open at 11am, otherwise the place fills up within an hour with a good, mixed crowd. The frittatas are OK, but if you don't like luke-warm (aka: ""room temperature""), go for the hot options. I've heard great things about their thick-cut bacon, scrambled eggs are lovingly fluffy, homefries are superb, and save room for the Nutella Filone bread! Wow!

"I'd give Frankie's 5 stars except for the fact that it's always so damn crowded.  That's great for them, but then, hey...do they really need another perfect review?    At any rate, their Cavatelli with Sausage is pretty much my favorite food on the planet, their BLT is the best I've ever had, and they serve a chianti that's so damn delicious I'd bathe in it if I could.",4.0
"Okay, not quite a five, but at least a four and a half.  Best BLT ever.  And amazing, amazing pastas.  YUM!  Good french toast.  Great coffee.  Only complaint was that I had very yucky soup once.  But almost everything is done VERY well, and the prices are quite fair.  Love this place.",5.0

"This is just a lovely neighborhood spot. Get there early, so you don't have to wait for eons, and hope you can sit in the beautiful back garden, where the tables are luxuriously dotted around the space --  none of this pack-'em-in strategy of Manhattan restaurants. It's very peaceful, especially if you're enjoying a nice glass of Riesling (it's wonderful). I wholeheartedly recommend the generously proportioned beets-and-avocado salad, which melts in your mouth and is a heartier alternative to the other greens-heavy salads on the menu. The lentil soup I wasn't feeling so much -- kinda bland. My dining companions loved their pasta dishes. I've had their sandwiches before and wasn't really blown away, and the room-temperature (by design) fritattas at brunch are pretty unappealing. But go with a pasta for dinner and the French toast for brunch, and you're gonna like what you get. I guar-un-tee it!",4.0
