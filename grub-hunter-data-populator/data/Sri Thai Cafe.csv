Love the pad Thai ...and the pad Voon seen! Perfect blend of Chinese veggies and spices with enough meat to accompany ;)) The shrimp rolls are also delicious though they could use some more veggies and less shrimp which is something I've never said before lol... Usually the shrimp rolls from these places are all cabbage,5.0
Went here after snow blizzard Jonas 2016. It was one of the few places that was open and the Yelp reviews were good. Had the pineapple fried rice and Maassam curry. Everything we had was bland and the food made us feel gross after. The fried rice has raisins in it...not very authentic. And the Massam curry was WAY off. Not coming back. The service was the only good thing.,2.0
"Sri is hit or miss these days.Sometimes its as great as it always beenToday was not good thoughThe Pad thai is different each time i order itWhich would be cool but when its not good, its quite disappointingThat's probably 1/4 of the time, 3/4 its worthwhile",3.0
"Very average the few times I've been. Not sure what everyone is raving about. Had the Pad Thai. Ok. Had the red curry, very watery and not impressive at all. It might have been an off day or batch. It's cheap and their lunch special includes salad (supposedly soup but never been avail) and a spring roll. I suppose I need to try the spicy basil chicken, which a few seem to rave about. Also, my order has always been to go, which may change the quality of preparation. Right now a solid 3 (maybe even 2.75), but I will probably give it another shot or two.",3.0
"I'd definitely recommend this place. Reasonable pricing and very good food. We ordered a Pad Thai and mango duck curry. The noodle has nice texture and it tastes authentic. The mango duck curry is a must-try! It's pretty spicy so definitively not for the weak. But the mango and duck are great combos with the red curry. Very tasty. Also got a Thai iced tea, it's great relieving the spicyness. The lady there is really nice. Give it a try!",5.0
"Nothing particularly special but it's quick easy and affordable. The pad thai has pretty good flavor and the special comes with fried chicken chunks. The ""special noodle"" is decidedly underwhelming though and not really as spicy as advertised.",3.0
First time trying this place.  Kept it simple by ordering Pad Thai and spring rolls.  It's great!  I'll definitely go back.  It's on my route from work to home so the location is perfect.,5.0

"Move over Pok Pok, Sri Thai Cafe is a wonderful family run restaurant that brings the robust taste of Thai home cooking to a great neighborhood spot. Eating at Sri Thai is like being a guest in someone's home. Recommend the perfectly seasoned Phad See Ew and Penang Curry, tho I am sure everything on the menu is fantastic!!!",5.0
"We've been trying to come here for several tries.  It's a small, unassuming spot on Grand St that serves great Thai food. Not really a sit down restaurant since it's so small and there are only 5 tables of 2.  They don't even have a bathroom for customers!  Most customers take their food to go, but we stayed.  Food was served fresh and made to order. We had fried tofu, beef pad see ew, and beef rice noodles (forgot what it was called).  Cheap, fast food, small location, great for a quick bite.  Probably the best Thai place in Williamsburg area.  Don't come for the atmosphere or presentation, just for the food.",5.0
Average Thai.I have the pineapple main dish and I honestly wasn't pleased with the flavors. It was interesting to say the least.We also got the spicy basil which was better.The dishes were just a little watery.This is a cash only place.,3.0

"Had a quick lunch here (tofu pad Thai lunch special for $7ish, came w tiny salad and 1 spring roll).  The restaurant (truly a cafe) is very small ~6 two-seater  tables flanking the exposed kitchen. The business opens to the sidewalk for outdoor dining.  The service was fast & service was courteous. Pad Thai was tasty but a touch greasy/oily.  Good 1st impression, cool small spot for a lunch.",4.0
"Very much a little hole in the wall, but the food was really delicious! It's a tiny place, very few seats, plastic cups that look like they could have been purchased at the dollar store, but it has an endearing level of quirk to it. The staff were really nice, the portions adequate, reasonably priced, and the chicken pad see ew was on point. The Thai dumplings were also a fav. Though I don't frequent Brooklyn often, I'd go again if I was in the area, and would definitely recommend for take out/delivery.",4.0
"Food was to go: I ordered the Massaman Curry and the Beef Pad Thai. The food was decent, but I wish the rice to curry ratio was better. I received a small container of rice which is definitely not enough compared to the amount of curry there was. The service was fast, and the closest Thai place to where I live.",3.0
"This is the type of place where you the saying ""do no judge a book by its cover"" is very relevant. The place is a hole in the wall and looks dirty jenk. There is barely any seating and looks straight up ghetto. When I opened up the menu... there were marker slashes everywhere... basically have the menu was crossed out as in not available.BUT... the food was legit amazing yadig? Their spicy flat pad and curries were off the hook. Talk about authentic and talk about flavor flav. The flavor of the sauces is what got me hooked. The seasoning on all the plates was done to perfection- at least for my taste buds. I'm all smiles about this place. It's a must have if you in the north side of Brooklyn.",5.0
"New to the city and was craving the perfect curry to compete with my favorite spot from home. I got the green curry take-away. It was delicious! Spicy so if you aren't into hot then this dish may not be for you. Great portion size. Although maybe a bit pricey depending on your budget, I found it to be reasonable. Will definitely be going back again the next time I have a green curry craving",4.0
"Great Lunch Special I initially thought this place was closed but its not!! It's OPEN for service & I'm so glad it is because our experience there was great. We took advantage of the lunch special that came with salad & an appetizer with your meal. The salad was a small portion but the ginger dressing tasted authentic and was not overdressed. The spring roll was also small but very delicious and not greasy at all. Remember these appetizers are for a lunch special and its preparing you for the huge dinner-portion sized dish coming next.  I had the chicken pad thai which, surprisingly, was a very large portion size for lunch. It had large pieces of chicken, the flavors were bright and the meal was well balanced. The meal is practically cooked in front of you due to the size of the space & everything is made to order. We left feeling clean & satisfied unlike other places that leave you feeling full & lethargic. The food here was delicious and the service was intimate & attentive probably because its such a tiny spot but its well worth it to visit.",5.0

More vegetables than noodles, I felt like I satisfied my daily intake of green goodness in one of the most flavorful ways possible. Next time, I'm trying the pad thai.

"I really have no idea why people garnish this place with 4 and 5 stars. I get the feeling that they are either brainwashed or being paid to pump this place up. Sri Thai Cafe is a mom and pop Thai food operation. There's only thai people here and the kitchen takes up most of the restaurant. You can literally see the lady chopping up vegetables by looking over the counter. Seating is limited. It's got a nice mom and pop feel.That's about where the positives end. As other reviewers noted, the man who picks up the phone has the affability of a lime stone. He takes your order and then immediately hangs up. I decided to give them a shot, and get the Chicken Bangkok Fried rice. What came out is typical of thai fried rice : greasy, ingredients hastily thrown into a wok and sauteed and then laid over a bed of rice. It was actually overflowing with carrots, tomatoes and chicken and not enough rice. It tasted ok, but again like other reviewers pointed out, overly sweet. For $8.xx it was passable but not a dish I would go back just to order. Still it got the job done and would have warranted a 3 star review. But the lack of warmth in Sri Thai Cafe is astounding. I'm not sure if it's just the staff or perhaps it's a cultural thing but there's no effort made to please the customer. I saw bottles of Sriracha inside and went to pour some into little sauce containers which were clearly there. The man who takes the orders told me ""don't touch, no not for you."" Apparently you're not entitled to Sriracha sauce unless you eat in. He gave me cheapo pink red hot sauce in a packet instead and told me ""this is same thing"". Ok food. Awful phone manners and so cheap, they won't give you any Sriracha sauce to take home. (It costs $3 for a 28 oz bottle) I'm going to pass. And frankly, I hope this place shuts down.

And also, they only gave me a tiny thing of rice which wasn't enough for all my curry.I think I might be back sometime because it is so close to my house and their prices aren't that bad.

"Reasonable Thai food in a neighborhood with some very problematic Thai offerings. The place is catastrophically small in bad weather when the windows can't be opened, and the frequent takeout/delivery traffic means frequently bursts of cold air. The breezes in the summer are better, but it's not for truly hot days.The menu is Thai 101 and it's executed perfectly fine. They'll add some spice on request, but the default is relatively tame. There's not reason to make any sort of trip out here, but the vegetables are nice and fresh and compared to the gloop of Note Thai a few blocks down, this is a winner.

"Last week this place didn't opened and I panicked: Might the only good restaurant in our neighborhood be closing? Thank God, it didn't. But it made me want to write a glowing review of this place that has become a staple of our since we moved to East Williamsburg two years ago. Sri Thai is simple, cheap and delicious. We love the chicken noodle soup, pad sukiyaki, pad khi mao and papaya salad. It's amazing how much better this bare bones restaurant is than the Thai food at Sage just two blocks away. What it lacks in ambiance it more than makes up for in flavor. Of course, the menu could be a little more varied and service is rather curt.

"At first glance Sri Thai Cafe doesn't seem like much - it is a hole-in-the-wall restaurant with 4 tables. However, don't let appearances fool you!

The Pad Thai is to die for. You can order it spicy for an extra kick at no additional charge. One of Sri Thai Cafe's strengths is its lunch special. You can get a soup/salad, spring roll, and entree for $7-8 depending on what entree you select. It is A LOT of food for the price. The reason why Sri Thai Cafe does not get 5 stars is that actually eating AT the restaurant can be a downer. The restaurant is so small and the seating is so close to the open kitchen that it often feels cramped and very noisy. This is definitely not a place I would take a date.

Anyway, we're both pretty vegetarian and you can either get the tofu or extra veggies as the meat replacement, and both are good ideas.

I'll need to suffer another ride on the L train when I'm back to have dinner here.I would even order pad thai from this place. (If you're not aware, this is the worst and dumbest thing to order at a Thai restaurant). I would not put this up against Center Point or Sripraphai. But it blows pretenders like Zabb (Manhattan version) out of the water with a high-caliber automatic gun.",4.0
The tiny place was packed at 9 pm on a Sunday evening. Ordered coconut soup and masaman curry. They were filled with delicious fresh veggies. The woman working the kitchen took care to make sure each dish was prepared to perfection by sampling each one.  I'm new to the neighborhood and so excited this is just around the corner.,4.0
"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place. The food is great. You'll be craving it afterwards, it is so good. The man that works there is kind and overall there is very good energy there. It's rather small inside but there is always take out.",5.0
"This place is literally across the street from me.  I absolutely fell in love with its pad thai after devouring it within five minutes of picking it up.  The next time I was really disappointed.  It didn't have as much flavor as the first time.  I plan on going back, fingers crossed that the second time was just a fluke.",3.0
"So this place opened on Friday and the food is great.  I've been waiting for a good Thai place in this 'hood because while there are a few other Thai places around, they've been sorely lacking in flavor, quality, and variety--I'll order from them because I have a hankerin' for curry or basil something or other, but then am always disappointed.While eating the food from this place, I actually said ""yummy"" out loud to myself at my desk.The only drawbacks are the pricing--$9.00 for rather small portion of mango curry, and $2.00 for a serving of brown rice that was smaller than my fist (and I'm a small lady), and that the food was a bit on the oily side.Good luck little place. You'll be nice to have around when I'm in the mood to splurge financially and calorically.",4.0
"Adorable little place, friendly staff and good food! Would've given it a 5 but one time my food was a little scorched, it was still quite good though. So I would still advise you to eat here, I mean, no one's perfect.",4.0
"I thought this place was disgusting and regretted my choice to come here and think the reviews may be deceiving... we had the papaya salad to start which was really unlike any you may find in a normal thai restaurant or anywhere in s.east asia... as It was not fresh and looked sad, we ordered the thai soup and the beef noodle soup and they just tasted like they were out of a package, with some bouillon cubes thrown in...",2.0

"I ate here once after reading all the great  Yelp reviews, but I was really disappointed.  I ordered a vegetable stir fry, and the vegetables were clearly the pre-cut, frozen veggies you buy for $1.  There was no spice, or really any flavor whatsoever.",2.0
"These are the owners of the old Noodle Studio on North 5th, and they've brought autentic delicious Thai back to Williamsburg.  The chef/owner comes from a long lineage of chefs in Thailand, his mother at one point cooking on the brigade that served the king.  Great Noodles, Curries, and probably the best Pad Thai in NYC.  Anthony",5.0
"There's plenty of Thai places in Williamsburg/Bushwick, but this is one of my favorites (along with Note Thai). My Thai roommate also approves! Better to take-out than eat-in. They were closed for a month due to a death in the family and they had to go back to Thailand for the funeral :( But they're open now!",4.0
"The food is really good. The atmosphere is meh. The waitstaff is short with people, but for good reason, they are flooded with orders all the time. I repeat, the food is really good. Prices are reasonable with a pretty substantial portions and comes with plenty of protein of your choice. Usually in other Thai places when you order Chicken Pad Thai, there are only like 8 pieces of chicken or so. This place gives you a lot of chicken in each bite.",4.0

This is the best thai in the neighborhood. Seriously. The others are all sub par or just flat out bad. It's tiny and not always open and they may not answer the phone but delicious!!!!,4.0
"I'm sure the food is fine--but I tried to order delivery from this place and they told me I lived too far away to deliver. I literally live 8 blocks away. They told me their delivery radius is ""5 blocks."" This conversation came after being on hold for 3 minutes. A place should not advertise itself as having ""delivery"" if their delivery radius is literally within 1 minute walking distance--that's not delivery, it's paying too much for pick-up.Don't order delivery from here unless you live next door--in which case--just go pick up your food and avoid a tip.",1.0
"Small place, bit too small for my liking. I left the place smelling like I was the one cooking. Other than that, food was tasty, friendly waitress and quick service. This is more a fast food restaurant, not a place I would go on a date or go to often.",3.0
"I've been really hoping a good Thai restaurant would make its way to the neighborhood. I've only ordered delivery from Sri Thai so I can't speak to a sit-down experience, but the take-out was great. They gave me a 20 minute delivery time and made it in about 35, which is still really quick. The delivery person was so nice and apologetic, promising quicker service next time. His job is tough and I appreciated that he was trying to do it well. The food was still hot, too.Everything was delicious. I ordered the very tasty Tom Kha Gai and some great Drunken Noodles, which were perfectly spicy. The noodles weren't soggy, the vegetables were crunchy and uniformly chopped and it was just good. Very affordably priced, too. I look forward to ordering again!",5.0

"Decided to try a new Thai place and dropped by for a lunch special.  I always order the same dish the first time I eat at a new Thai restaurant, chicken pad thai, medium spicy, to establish a baseline.  I was not impressed.  The salad they gave me was damn near school lunch program salad, iceberg with thousand island dressing (honestly VERY close).  The pad thai looked good, on the dark and smokey side of pad thai, but was monochromatic and bland.  Missing was that aromatic transparency of flavors.  It could have been pad thai from a box.  The place is charming, the food was inexpensive, served lightening fast, but it was thoroughly unspectacular.",2.0
After a 4 hour car ride I was exhausted and famished. My darlin and I were in the mood for something spicy. From the heaves came Sri. The duck green curry was exceptional.

"Hard review to write because the food is absolutely spot on (but lacks spiciness), but the service is *weird*. 5 stars for the food. Service is odd but not hateful. Also, CASH ONLY.When I called to see what time they close, he wouldn't give me a straight answer, instead asking us ""when are you hungry?"" and that he'd kick other people out to seat us (?!).When we got there, all of the lights were off (only kitchen lights were on). Once we sat down, he only turned the little spot lights on in that section. The place is the size of a bathroom but having spot lights on only our table felt bizarre. Were they really trying to cut costs that much? Another weird moment came when I ordered a Thai iced tea but didn't want ice as it's freezing outside and I have a cold. I am used to Thai restaurants only filling half of my glass if I ask for it without ice, but he actually refused to sell it to me at all if I didn't want ice. I ended up having to get ice on the side in a separate glass just to be able to get my drink! (And fyi, it was only filled half-way).
