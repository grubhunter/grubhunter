"Ever since I brunched at Beco with my friend, she has consistently reminded me about our experience. ""Remember brunch at Beco?"" Yeah, it was about an hour ago.  The point I'm making is that Beco is really, really, ridiculously good.The space is much smaller than I anticipated, but on a beautiful Sunday, the outdoor seating gave a nice expansion for patrons and their cute puppies.  The people here seem to be the cool kids in the neighborhood and for such a causal spot, people were still dressed to kill.The brunch prix fix was perfect. One entree + espresso drink + cocktail.  Additional cocktails are priced in the single digits but one caipirinha is plenty strong.  My rabanada also did not disappoint.   Food is incredibly fresh and pleasing to the palette. I'm curious to see what Beco brings at dinner time.  So much so that I may have to find out.",5.0
"The food is authentic. The place looks pretty authentic too. I'm pretty sure you get better service if you sit by the bar counter, but I find it hard to resist outside sitting on a quite block. The bartender is always smiling, unlike the waitresses. It's a cozy place with random nights with live music. The feijoada was delicious. I love that they offer it as a brunch option. We usually eat it on Saturdays or Sundays, depending of where you live in Brazil. For about $20 you get a drink and coffee with your meal. The farofa & vinaigrette were on point. I could eat those by the spoon full. Collard greens were bright and buttery. Rice tasted like it was made in a pot, not a lame rice cooker. I've had their pão de queijo and it's good. Yes to caipirinhas. I think they use 51, unless that bottle is only for display. Haha Oh, they serve Guaraná Antartica.  Definitely worth coming here for brunch! Most of the entrees, with a caipirinha and coffee included, are about $16-17. Drinks are $5-6 during brunch. The only downside is that it's CASH ONLY, but I think it's worth getting cash out for this place.",4.0
Hot and muggy inside. Okay waiters. Rude bartender. Okay food. Overpriced food. Wouldn't come here again.,2.0
"If you're looking to have great Brazilian food for pre-fixe Sunday Brunch, this is your place.  The place itself does give off the very nonchalant and relaxed vibe.  I almost felt as if I were in Rio again.  When in Rio...you order the maracuja (passion fruit) and pineapple mint caipirinhas (Brazil's national cocktail) made with cachaça (sugar can rum), sugar and lime. The caipirinhas were alright, but not the best I've had.  Then again, it might have been the type of cachaca used.If you must order one dish, and one dish only, go for the Feijoada (Brazil's national dish).  Granted, you'll probably be so full and heavy after finishing this dish that it might require you take a nap right after, but it's well worth it.The feijoada (basically a black bean and meat stew) is accompanied by white rice, shredded collard greens, and orange slices. Farofa, made from yucca flour, and vinagrete (sort of a chow chow minus the sugar) was served separately in 2 small shot glasses.  And let's not forget the malagueta peppers provided at every table (a combo of small house cured spicy peppers) used give the feijoada some kick.I can honestly say this was one of the best feijoada I have had at a Brazilian restaurant (not to be compared to my mother's feijoada, of course). For those who don't know, the feijoada is meant to be shared with friends and family, typically on Saturday or Sunday afternoon gatherings.  It did bring back nostalgia, times family would just get together and bond over really good food and enjoy each other's company. We also shared an Herb Omelet, with smoked ham, hearts of palm and minas cheese.  Try the minas cheese, you'll like it! The omelet was accompanied by potato pancakes and mixed greens.  And the omelet was amazing! The combination of the ingredients gave it just the right flavor. Everything really came together to give you that unique experience (albeit in Brooklyn of course).If it weren't for the caipirinhas, I would have given this place 5 stars.  I would not hesitate to recommend this place to any of my friends or come back anytime for another great meal.",4.0
"We went to this place with a few friends for dinner as we were craving for some Brazilian food! We ordered the shrimp stew that came with rice, the chicken balls, filet mignon and the filet mignon baguette! The food itself was phenomenal and we enjoyed every single bite of it!  The downside: really small place , horrible lighting (can barely see the people sitting in front), very poor ventilation system and the cooking is done in the same room that the guests are sat in!, the staffs were extremely rude and didn't help with making us understand what the food was since it was our first time eating Brazilian food, and when we were leaving they called us back in front of everyone and asked us to pay more tip because what we paid wasn't enough! We felt extremely embarrassed and have had a grudge about that place ever since! Definitely wouldn't recommend.",2.0
"Beco is pretty Brazilian. Came here to watch a soccer game with some diehard fans (or futbol/football, if you want to get technical about it). I didn't have any of the food, but had a few caiparinhas.I have fond memories of acai in Rio, especially with the guy yelling at the beach and the frozen kind you can get at a walkup window on the street. So I just had to try their acai and guava caiparinha. It was good, but not great.However, I then spotted a Mike's Hot Honey caiparinha with passionfruit and lime. That one was great. A good amount of kick from the Hot Honey and some tartness from the passionfruit and lime. Actually ended up getting two of those.Bartender was cool, but be warned that it's cash only! There's an ATM in the corner by the front though.",4.0
"The food is pretty good, I expected bigger portions but the flavors were great. The coconut flan is the bomb. Our bartender wasn't that friendly, but she got the job done. Bring cash though, this place doesn't accept card. That's main reason for a 3 star rating. Who doesn't accept cards now a days?",3.0
"Review for a Sunday Brunch with a few Prixe Fixe options.This place is cool and cozy and does give you that authentic Brazilian vibe. Although I have never been to Brazil, this is just my take. I had the Feijoada. A whaaaaat? I had the Feijoada.The National Brazilian dish: black beans and smoked meat stew w/rice, sautéed collard greens, orange wedges and farofa.I enjoyed this dish a lot. Many different flavors, colors, and textures. All were fresh and blended well together. The meal included a drink & coffee. Of course, I had coffee and it was tasty and not as strong as I thought it would be, a good thing. For the drink, I had the Pineapple-Mint Caipirinha, this drink was awesome. I can drink these all day.",4.0
"Beco was a lot of fun. What seemed like a simple unassuming room when I arrived on Sunday around 4:30, quickly turned into quite a lively and packed joint as day turned to night. Very nice, low key yet still with a date-ish vibe. As a previous tourist in Brazil, I dream of authentic caipirinhas, and this place got it! Not too mention a cool passion fruit play on a traditional caipirinha. I also had a spicy drink with honey and passion fruit which was amazing. As for the food, it was quite delicious. I ordered the Moqueca -shrimp stew with coconut milk (which I recall having made with fish in Brazil, but this was yummy all the same). My date got the Feijoada- black beans and smoked meat, which he thoroughly enjoyed as well. We also tried the cheese bread and the chicken croquettes for appetizers, both of which  I'd recommend, especially the croquettes. On Fridays and Sundays they have a live ensemble band playing gorgeous Brazilian music. It really made the vibe and feel of this place transform, the whole room was really loving their set. I haven't been in a place that made me recall Brazil more since my visit 2 years ago. So when I'm getting the itch to return to Salvador or Rio, I'll just stop buy this place instead!",4.0
Drinks and sandwiches were excellent. The live band added a great extra touch. No complaints what so ever. Would recommend.,4.0
"They are pretty limited on beer, especially that night because their taps weren't working, but the pretty blonde got the Guinness to come out anyway, so yay! All they have in bottles are light, domestic beers, which is ok, but I wasn't in the mood for that. I discovered the little music venue they have hiding in the back; it feels like you are in a train car and there's a full band playing awesome music in the car with you. Very cool. It was packed back there. So this place gets 4 stars from me, especially since it's the closest bar to my friend's place. :)",4.0

"There are certain meals that I crave and the Moqueca at Beco is one of them - it's just that good.  My boyfriend always gets the Bauru sandwich, which is hearty and consistently amazing (high-quality for the $12 price tag).  An appetizer of the Pao de Queijo is a must - make sure to put the house hot sauce on it.  Love the atmosphere, which is very authentic and cozy - especially on the nights that they have live jazz; you feel like you've been transported out of New York.  The service is prompt and thorough, but not overly friendly.  Don't expect to have the waitresses explain the menu or offer suggestions - it's just not that kind of place, they expect people to know the deal already.  Note that it is cash only, so come prepared.  There is an ATM in the corner, but it's wedged between tables so not that easy to access/awkward when people are already seated around it.",5.0
"Came to Beco on a Sunday morning in need of a serious Bloody Mary. Boy, was I in luck.The place was packed and hot as hell-- no AC, just ceiling fans. A bunch of small tables scattered the dining room and a few outside beneath the awning. A dreadlocked bartender casually mixed cocktails as he chatted with some customers. I dug it. The kitchen was small and in plain sight. Hot plates facilitated all cooking. It was neat.The menu was small, but flavor was not. I ordered the eggs benedict to go and a Bloody Mary to stay. This was the best Bloody Mary I've ever had in my entire life, and that wasn't my hangover talking. Swear. It hit every note of salty, spicy and tangy. It saved my life. The eggs benedict was perfect. The portion size was perfect. The poached egg was perfect. The Hollandaise was perfect. It came with 2 potato pancakes. I only wished there were 13 more.Beco: highly recommended for hangovers and Sunday brunch.",4.0
"I had the shrimp in coconut stew. It came in a cup, which was odd but sort of interesting. The rice came with a side of green stuff. The meal was pretty good but I've had better moqueca. My date had the steak, which did not taste good at all. The place has ""vintage"" furniture, aka mismatched chairs and tables, which gives it more of a cafe feel. Don't know if that was what they were going for. There was a large pile of dust on top of the ceiling fans. Don't think I would come back here, at least not for the dinner options.",2.0
Loveeee their Caipirinha drinks!  We ordered a pitcher and had to fight off the urge of ordering another one. The waitress was friendly and helpful in choosing what to eat since I wanted empanadas but they had ran out. She helped me pick out the Bauru sandwich which was amazing!!! Unfortunately they have no air conditioner and on these hot summer days that is a necessity especially if your going to be drinking!,4.0
One of my very favorite places in Williamsburg and I always want to come here when I meet up with my friends that live in the neighborhood. It's warm and inviting no matter what time of year you visit. Toasty and cozy in the winter or light and airy in the summer. Service treats you like you are an old friend and the comfort food is hearty and flavorful. I love the moqueca (shrimp stew) and I do believe I've ordered it every time I've been. Drinks are tasty... you'll be surprised how quickly you can go through a pitch of capirinha!If I lived in this neighborhood I would sit outside with a coffee whenever I could.

"I came here with my roommates for dinner on a Thursday evening looking for something different, and Beco definitely did not disappoint! They have ample outside seating, which was great for us since I had my dog with us.

You know a restaurant is gonna be good when you can't pronounce anything you're ordering. The food came fairly quickly and was absolutely delicious! I can't speak to the true authenticity of it, since I have no experience with Brazilian food, but I do know that my tummy was very happy. The feijoada was unlike anything else I've ever eaten in my life. When you hear what goes into it, it doesn't sound the least bit appetizing, but the flavors somehow came together into one cohesive dish that our table kept going back for! If you're in williamsburg and looking to try something new, I would definitely recommend giving Beco a try! It is cash only and the restaurant is fairly small, but I think it's worth the wait.",5.0

Dolce-de-leche crepe with passion fruit sauce is amazing!!  Funny enough we had to do math to add the tax onto the final bill- no big deal- just weird that the waitress would hand checks like that.... she was probably dreaming in.. LALA land again!! lol Have been back and would go back again!",4.0
"This is a nice place to bring your dog and enjoy some feijoada out front with a caipirinha. The menu is very small so make sure there is something you're interested in before you go, but is is a nice little place at which to enjoy a warm summer night.",4.0
"I came here with my roommates for dinner on a Thursday evening looking for something different, and Beco definitely did not disappoint! They have ample outside seating, which was great for us since I had my dog with us. We ordered the arugula salad, feijoada, pao de queijo, sausage appetizer, and another appetizer that was toasted crostini with some kind of salsa heaped on top (I forget the name). You know a restaurant is gonna be good when you can't pronounce anything you're ordering. The food came fairly quickly and was absolutely delicious! I can't speak to the true authenticity of it, since I have no experience with Brazilian food, but I do know that my tummy was very happy. The feijoada was unlike anything else I've ever eaten in my life. When you hear what goes into it, it doesn't sound the least bit appetizing, but the flavors somehow came together into one cohesive dish that our table kept going back for! If you're in williamsburg and looking to try something new, I would definitely recommend giving Beco a try! It is cash only and the restaurant is fairly small, but I think it's worth the wait.",5.0

"Life is beautiful in those rare moments when your expectations are met. This side street treasure cafe is an island of cool. Sit outside with a hot coffee and breath in the rays of el sol. The feijoada nourishes body and soul; the ingredients, the texture, the taste - you think it was just made by someone's dear Aunty. It may be.PS - Sundays are a nightmare because of brunch.

"My last recent review proved little lasting. I had an unfortunate time during weekend brunch.  While the place was packed, loud, and busy - there is still no excuse for spotty service. The waitress forgot to bring menus, so we had to grab them ourselves.  Every. Single. Time. the waitress would pass by me, she would bump into my chair.  Hard.  At some point I was getting an anxiety attack.  The music was loud, but nice.  The drunk afternoon crowd was 10 times louder. What really annoyed me was that nobody seemed to know which menu was being served. So some people got an early dinner, some a late brunch, and others somewhere in between. It took 50 minutes to get appetizers. 50! I was asked if I wanted another drink once. The 2 hours we spent there, the place emptied out, but the service didn't improve one bit.  We had to ask 2 different waitresses for a check, until we got up to get it by the bar. I'm hoping my next experience would be the other bun to this sandwich.",3.0
For my first time here it was amazing. The food is great. Get the hearts of Palm apps. I also had the pork and beans dish. It was great.  Watch out for the basket they pass around for the band.

"Beco is my favorite restaurant in all of Brooklyn. Even if you don't live close by, I promise you this place is worth a subway ride.

"Last night was Dine Out Williamsburg and my friend and I wanted to support victims of Hurricane Sandy by supporting a restaurant that was willing to donate 20% of gross sales.  Not every participant in Dine Out Williamsburg was willing to donate that much, but Beco was and we figured - let's check it out.Beco was extremely inviting, with dim lighting and a helpful server who told us to sit anywhere that's free.  We took the corner table by the window and was relieved by how warm it was.  It was so cold last night!  Their menu isn't long, but it was definitely authentic Brazilian.  We ordered a pitcher of Guava Caipirinha, which was a steal at $24.  It was strong, but super tasty with a nice sweetness from the guava.  The pitcher filled up 4 glasses perfectly.  Do yourself a favor and just get the pitcher if you're with 2 or more people.  Once you taste how good these are, you're going to slap yourself for not just going for it.  We decided on the two main entrees that seemed the most exciting: Moqueca and Feijoada.  I've eaten plenty of Feijoada since my mom is Portuguese, but this was by far the best I've ever had.  First off, the plating was adorable and smart.  The feijoada comes in a tin mug on the side, which keeps the food hot while you spoon some onto the main plate they give you.  They give you a nice pile of perfectly cooked white rice, a nice portion of sauteed collard greens (so delicious) and two slices of fresh orange (super traditional way to serve this dish).  There was also a small metal container of farofa (toasted yucca flour which didn't really rock my world) and some onion relish - which was really tasty and complimented the dish well.The feijoada was so flavorful with chunks of pork (various cuts of it) and soft black beans that just melt in your mouth.  It was such a savory dish, perfect on a cold night.  I couldn't stop sighing while eating this dish, it was pure heaven!My friend loved the Moqueca - which I have to admit was equally delicious.  The shrimp were large and juicy.  The sauce was sweet with a hint of spices I couldn't quite place.  You can taste a tiny bit of the cilantro, but I'm one of those weird people that HATES cilantro and it didn't bother me at all.  So if you're also genetically inclined to hate it, don't worry - this is still a delicious dish.  My friend liked her dish so much that she finished THE WHOLE THING.  She didn't feel so hot afterwards, but nothing a walk couldn't cure.  Beco started to get busy about 9:30pm at night, but we were already half way done eating. So if you go about 7 or so, you shouldn't have an issue getting a table on a Thursday night.  Overall, it was an absolutely fantastic meal.  Every bite was heaven and I can't wait to go back over and over again.  The only sad thing is that all the desserts have dairy, which I can't eat.  They looked and sounded amazing.   Beco just might be my new favorite local spot!",5.0
"I was brought back to my honeymoon in Rio.First and foremost, they use traditional Brazilian juice, so their juice and rums are out of this world. If you don't try anything, get a Guava and rum. Other than thatm the coconut batido is as good as it looks.I got the mouqueca, wasn't the best mouqueca Iv had in the city, but it was highly enjoyable. Our friend date got the filet, it was juicy and spiced to perfection. Another friend got the feijoada, which was one of the better feijoada's Iv had in the city. I was disappointed with the almond dessert. It's the last one on the menu. The waitress recommended it, they must have told her to tell people that so they can get rid of them.And of course, the cheese balls go without saying. If you have a group, all you need is one order. You get about five balls.I like the fact that this place is off the beaten path, so it wasn't that crowded on a Saturday night that we couldn't get a seat for four. Around 830, it took less than 15 minutes to seat us. The place is a little small, and the environment is a little loud, and youre more likely to find gold in the Sahara before you find a coat hook, but we got used to it.The best part was its inexpensively, the four of us were very full and the costs came only to $146.",5.0
"They have some really fine, simple and cheap food here (for beeing in Broklyn). Go for something brazilian! The pastries is not very good. And to be honest, the fruit-capirinhias is not very good either since they use concentrade juice instead of fresh fruit. Go for the original one with lime instead :) For lunch is between $9-15 and the capirihias is $8-10. I will get back at night time next time since is a lot more busy then!",4.0
I have always thought that having steak for breakfast was for those who were extra carnivorous but having the Bife a Cavalo at Beco during brunch has completely changed my mind. So so good. The prixe fixe is a great deal and both of the drinks (caipirinha and latte) were delicious. Cash only and fills up quickly- arrive early if you hate to wait.,4.0
"The place could be fun but the waitress who is always there (dark hair) is very mean. She makes the beco experience very uncomfortable. My friends and I wanted to have a good time, but her attitude and the way she served us, in a rush and with an attitude, made us all say that we're never going back. There was music playing, during happy hour, so we decided to dance a bit and she asked us to go sit down. Really? A Brazilian place with music... And during happy hour? We already found a replacement, where servers are nice, food is awesome --- Tabare, highly recommend it.",1.0
"This is such a nice little neighborhood spot! I was going to a concert at the Music Hall and was looking for a new food option in Williamsburg so I decided to come here. If we didn't have the concert to go to I would have stayed here and listened to bossa nova. They have a great happy hour: $3 beers, and $5 caipirinhas. I had the maracuja, very tropical and on the stronger side. The guava was also nice. For food I was excited about their pão de queijo. I love those things! It's like mochi bread but made of cheese. They come 6pcs per basket, fresh out of the oven, nice and toasty. We had 2 orders! We also ordered their linguiça which was a tasty accompaniment to the cheese bread. Lastly, my friend and I split a sandwich. We had the ham and cheese, which was very good but next time I want to try the filet mignon or the chorizo sandwich. For dessert we shared the crepe filled with dolce de leite and the brigadeiro candy  Over all, the food scored 4 stars in Originality, 4 stars for Presentation, and 4.5 stars for Taste. And it was also really inexpensive. Definitely a place to keep in mind when in that area.",4.0

"I am so glad I said what I said about Beco. After two years of living steps away, I can honestly say that this is one of my favourite places... ever. Their brunch is incredible and I love that they serve Oslo -- the Americano wakes me up every time. And can I add that their Bloody Mary is literally the best I've ever had?I'm in love with this place, the end :)",5.0
"Last night was Dine Out Williamsburg and my friend and I wanted to support victims of Hurricane Sandy by supporting a restaurant that was willing to donate 20% of gross sales.  Not every participant in Dine Out Williamsburg was willing to donate that much, but Beco was and we figured - let's check it out.Beco was extremely inviting, with dim lighting and a helpful server who told us to sit anywhere that's free.  We took the corner table by the window and was relieved by how warm it was.  It was so cold last night!  Their menu isn't long, but it was definitely authentic Brazilian.  We ordered a pitcher of Guava Caipirinha, which was a steal at $24.  It was strong, but super tasty with a nice sweetness from the guava.  The pitcher filled up 4 glasses perfectly.  Do yourself a favor and just get the pitcher if you're with 2 or more people.  Once you taste how good these are, you're going to slap yourself for not just going for it.  We decided on the two main entrees that seemed the most exciting: Moqueca and Feijoada.  I've eaten plenty of Feijoada since my mom is Portuguese, but this was by far the best I've ever had.  First off, the plating was adorable and smart.  The feijoada comes in a tin mug on the side, which keeps the food hot while you spoon some onto the main plate they give you.  They give you a nice pile of perfectly cooked white rice, a nice portion of sauteed collard greens (so delicious) and two slices of fresh orange (super traditional way to serve this dish).  There was also a small metal container of farofa (toasted yucca flour which didn't really rock my world) and some onion relish - which was really tasty and complimented the dish well.The feijoada was so flavorful with chunks of pork (various cuts of it) and soft black beans that just melt in your mouth.  It was such a savory dish, perfect on a cold night.  I couldn't stop sighing while eating this dish, it was pure heaven!My friend loved the Moqueca - which I have to admit was equally delicious.  The shrimp were large and juicy.  The sauce was sweet with a hint of spices I couldn't quite place.  You can taste a tiny bit of the cilantro, but I'm one of those weird people that HATES cilantro and it didn't bother me at all.  So if you're also genetically inclined to hate it, don't worry - this is still a delicious dish.  My friend liked her dish so much that she finished THE WHOLE THING.  She didn't feel so hot afterwards, but nothing a walk couldn't cure.  Beco started to get busy about 9:30pm at night, but we were already half way done eating. So if you go about 7 or so, you shouldn't have an issue getting a table on a Thursday night.  Overall, it was an absolutely fantastic meal.  Every bite was heaven and I can't wait to go back over and over again.  The only sad thing is that all the desserts have dairy, which I can't eat.  They looked and sounded amazing.   Beco just might be my new favorite local spot!",5.0
"I was brought back to my honeymoon in Rio.First and foremost, they use traditional Brazilian juice, so their juice and rums are out of this world. If you don't try anything, get a Guava and rum. Other than thatm the coconut batido is as good as it looks.I got the mouqueca, wasn't the best mouqueca Iv had in the city, but it was highly enjoyable. Our friend date got the filet, it was juicy and spiced to perfection. Another friend got the feijoada, which was one of the better feijoada's Iv had in the city. I was disappointed with the almond dessert. It's the last one on the menu. The waitress recommended it, they must have told her to tell people that so they can get rid of them.And of course, the cheese balls go without saying. If you have a group, all you need is one order. You get about five balls.I like the fact that this place is off the beaten path, so it wasn't that crowded on a Saturday night that we couldn't get a seat for four. Around 830, it took less than 15 minutes to seat us. The place is a little small, and the environment is a little loud, and youre more likely to find gold in the Sahara before you find a coat hook, but we got used to it.The best part was its inexpensively, the four of us were very full and the costs came only to $146.",5.0
"They have some really fine, simple and cheap food here (for beeing in Broklyn). Go for something brazilian! The pastries is not very good. And to be honest, the fruit-capirinhias is not very good either since they use concentrade juice instead of fresh fruit. Go for the original one with lime instead :) For lunch is between $9-15 and the capirihias is $8-10. I will get back at night time next time since is a lot more busy then!",4.0
I have always thought that having steak for breakfast was for those who were extra carnivorous but having the Bife a Cavalo at Beco during brunch has completely changed my mind. So so good. The prixe fixe is a great deal and both of the drinks (caipirinha and latte) were delicious. Cash only and fills up quickly- arrive early if you hate to wait.,4.0
"The place could be fun but the waitress who is always there (dark hair) is very mean. She makes the beco experience very uncomfortable. My friends and I wanted to have a good time, but her attitude and the way she served us, in a rush and with an attitude, made us all say that we're never going back. There was music playing, during happy hour, so we decided to dance a bit and she asked us to go sit down. Really? A Brazilian place with music... And during happy hour? We already found a replacement, where servers are nice, food is awesome --- Tabare, highly recommend it.",1.0
"This is such a nice little neighborhood spot! I was going to a concert at the Music Hall and was looking for a new food option in Williamsburg so I decided to come here. If we didn't have the concert to go to I would have stayed here and listened to bossa nova. They have a great happy hour: $3 beers, and $5 caipirinhas. I had the maracuja, very tropical and on the stronger side. The guava was also nice. For food I was excited about their pão de queijo. I love those things! It's like mochi bread but made of cheese. They come 6pcs per basket, fresh out of the oven, nice and toasty. We had 2 orders! We also ordered their linguiça which was a tasty accompaniment to the cheese bread. Lastly, my friend and I split a sandwich. We had the ham and cheese, which was very good but next time I want to try the filet mignon or the chorizo sandwich. For dessert we shared the crepe filled with dolce de leite and the brigadeiro candy  Over all, the food scored 4 stars in Originality, 4 stars for Presentation, and 4.5 stars for Taste. And it was also really inexpensive. Definitely a place to keep in mind when in that area.",4.0
"Had a wonderful girls brunch yesterday at Beco!  Came in around 11:45am and we had a table of 4 available immediately.  The waitress was wonderful and pleasant.  The food appeared small at first glance, but it was plentiful and we were extremely full.  My friends and I ordered the Pao De Queijo (delicious! comes in 6 & shareable), Misto Quente (delicious), Feijoada (delicious! must try the pork stew), filet mignon (delicious!). We also had a pitcher of the Caipirinha (strong & sour, but delicious).",4.0

"I very reluctantly give this 2 stars. I have been coming to Beco since the week they opened and  have had lots of very enjoyable evenings here.

We saw our plates sitting ready in the kitchen window, and watched 3 different people - including our waitress - pick them up, look at the ticket, and then put them back down.  Once the food finally arrived - all dishes staggered by 5 minutes - it was good but not amazing.

My roommate had the steak and eggs, which was an amazing piece of filet mignon in place of your usual dried out strip steak. I had the herb omelette, and it was hands down the best I've ever had. I was actually shocked. Our other dining companion had the french toast, which I didn't try, but he seemed to enjoy it. Cappucinos were delicious and the drinks were strong and tasty.

"My second visit to Beco fully made up for the first which involved a waitress who didn't speak English. Not only was the food as fantastic as the first time (maybe even better) but service was right on this time around. The Feijoada was absolute perfection, comfort in it's most delicious form, filled with chunks of smoky pork. Love. The cheese bread is worth the 15 minute wait. I wouldn't lie. Also really loved the Carioca sandwich (banana, cinnamon, and CHEESE on brioche). A fabulous surprise. Our pitcher of caipirinha was nice and strong, a final touch to a really wonderful meal. Very pleased with my return and will continue to consider Beco as one of the stand-out restaurants in the neighborhood, now with better service than before.",5.0
"Great brunch place in the neighborhood.The staff is very friendly and the food is excellent.My fave is the feijoada a brazillian stew with bacon, rice and some salad. Yumm.The brunch comes with coffee and a drink.Sometimes they also have live music there.",5.0
In love with this place! Holy Moly!! Live music on Sundays. I've been there twice in the last month and it was perfect for a romantic night with my boyfriend and a great happy hour spot with my roommate! Food is insanely good and authentic. Their drinks are great too! Ambience is A++. Can't wait for my next visit!,5.0
"Have never had something here I didn't like. Great lattes, great pastries (cece cela?) delicious brunch and caipirinhas and badass dinners. It's even good as take out! Sooooo Brooklyn and quite a scene at brunch. Nothing fancy and that's the point. Highly recommend.",5.0
"This place makes me ridiculously happy that I dropped vegetarianism. Came here on an impromptu brunch date. It's a small place... probably sits about 40 people at maximum capacity, and has a small bar. It's cash only, but the prices are so reasonable that you can't even complain. The decor is simple- 70's clutter with chalkboard writing and old faded pictures. The tables are close together and intimate, so be prepared to have someone's booty in your face at some point. The place is packed, but the service is good, and certainly no where near pretentious. The brunch deal is fantastic. For $15 you get an alcoholic beverage, a meal and an espresso drink. I had the eggs benedict, served with a side of green salad and a hash brown, a pinapple-mint caipirinha and a mocha drink. There is no part of me that's disappointed. The drink was the perfect combination of lightly sweet, minty and boozy. I was afraid it was going to be too sweet, but really was lovely and refreshing. I loved my eggs benedict but it was the details that got me. The salad on the side had a simple yet tasty lemon dressing and the hashbrown was golden delicious without being overly fried or oily. The boy had the friojada, a large plate of rice and collard greens served with a meat stew of beans and what appeared to be pork. His dish was the winner. I'm still weary of eating mystery meat but the bean stew was delicious and I couldn't get over how damn tasty those collard greens were. What did they put in them? I need to know! Easily one of the best things I've tried. Terrific Brazilian brunch experience. Highly, highly recommend!",5.0
"Great campirinias. Very loud. Mediocre service from chill brazilians. They are sweet and kind but you might wait a very long time for water. The cheese bread is amazing. It's honestly really good. I am primarily a veggie person so I've had the rice, beans, egg and collard greens twice. I think its amazing. I never knew collard greens could be so delish. My husband loves the meat there. The sandwiches are served on gorgeous looking baguette. Neighborhood staple. Nothing to go out of your way for.",3.0
"I've been here twice for brunch and I have to say it's pretty damn good. For only $16 you get any coffee you like, an alcoholic drink, and an entree. I highly recommend the bloody mary, it's truly the best I've ever had. It's very strong and spicy! The winning dish here is the bife a cavalo, which is: steak, eggs any style, tomato salsa, rice, and beans. I want to eat another plate of it just thinking about it.Finally, my favorite Brazilian staple is pao de quiejo (cheesy bread).

I had eggs Benedict and I forget what my husband got but it had a side of linguica was AWESOME. most importantly, we got dessert. They had a trio of shot glasses filled with different items, like parfaits and other cold desserts/pudding type things. I'm not Brazilian so I'm not going to attempt to butcher the names but one of them was called Almond Joy and it was SOOOOO good. Keep in mind it's Cash only. Worth going back for sure.",4.0
"Cash only ! And tepid tap water. So far.very small place, open air, very nice staff just kinda laid back.  i thought both the entrees at the table were decent, i actually enjoyed mine, (the feijoiada), more, as leftovers the next day!caipirinha was decently strong, i had 2, and was pleasantly buzzed.i have attemptedd to come here on a Saturday night in the winter and it was packed to the brim. it was nice on a casual Saturday afternoon .",3.0
"Had an amazing brunch at this place today. We only went into Brooklyn to sell some stuff at Buffalo Exchange, and we're generally not into the vibe of most eateries in the borough, but Beco was great. We were seated right away and the $15 lunch deal (entree, coffee, drink) is pretty hard to beat. My roommate had the steak and eggs, which was an amazing piece of filet mignon in place of your usual dried out strip steak. I had the herb omelette, and it was hands down the best I've ever had. I was actually shocked. Our other dining companion had the french toast, which I didn't try, but he seemed to enjoy it. Cappucinos were delicious and the drinks were strong and tasty.

"Fellow Yelpers,It's easy to forget that the reviews you write are being posted in the public space because you're one out of so many other reviewers on the site airing their opinion. That is, until the owner contacts you apologizing for your experience at the restaurant with promises to make good the situation. Daniel, the owner of Beco, was exceptionally gracious in reviewing MY review and addressing the issues at hand. Let me clarify1) I was informed that the night I went, there was a guest DJ playing that lured in quite a bit of people to the 'bar scene' at the restaurant... impinging on the servers' access to the diners and the quality of dining there. Daniel has said that they will no longer do this to maintain the restaurant atmosphere2) Dark lighting - not sure how this will be fixed, but it has been addressed as it was hard to see what exactly we were eating3) Tip: This was the tipping point (har har) in my earlier review as I was more than annoyed with the waitress's reaction to a 10% tip on top of the already included 25% tip to the bill. A 25% tip is apparently not the restaurant's norm and the owner has apologized for this error. While I may not have enjoyed my initial experience at Beco, I certainly appreciate and applaud excellent customer service.

Definitely have their pitcher caipirinha - great value and refreshing for a hot lil spot.  Must try their cheese bread balls, and if you want light, have one of their fabulous sandwiches, or if you want more substantial meal order a big plate.  All the food is made fresh with high quality ingredients, and served with pride.  It's simply exquisite!!Don't miss out!!",5.0

"Beco is one of my favorite brunch places for three reasons: 1- I'm Brazilian 2- I live quite close 3- the food is good and the price is fair: 16 bucks for a dish + coffee + one drink is good enough for me. If you're looking for the delicious Brazilian caipirinhas or caipiroskas this place unfortunately is not for you: they are not made with fresh fruit, but bottled juices. SAD. But the Bloody Mary is super yum. Bife a cavalo is def my favorite. The steak is always soft, the eggs taste fresh and the beans are not from cans... Fantastic. Pão de queijo is a must if your need an appetizer. The staff is usually pretty happy and helpful. I had a little attitude from a Brazilian server today, that coincidently (or not) started when I asked her in Portuguese to trade my guava mimosa for a caju mimosa, the one I had ordered.

Small Brazilian joint that has awkward seating in which you have to cross over other seats to get in. The food is made behind a glass shield reminiscent of a cafeteria. There was a guy sitting behind my eating partner strumming a guitar.The pao de queijo was so delicious with it's cheesy tapioca goodness. I also tried the capririnha and it was fresh and lime-y. The abrobrina (zucchini) was too salty and hard to eat.My friend had the feijohada and said it was just ok. The wooden look of this casual dining place is nice but I'd probably just pop in for a capririnha and pao de queijo and skip the meal.Cash only is weird too at these prices.,3.0

"My go-to place for a light dinner, or casual date night with the boyfriend.  We almost always get the same thing- pao de queijo to start, the vegetariano sandwich for me, the bauru sandwich for him, and a glass of vinho verde.  I've probably had this same meal 15 times and never get tired of it.The prato feito is another great option, if you're feeling a little more hungry- you can choose from a variety of sides, including eggs, beans, rice, farofa, and vegetables to put together your own plate of 4 items.  The food is simple, well-portioned and consistently tasty.The staff is very laid-back and friendly, and the atmosphere is cozy.  When the weather is warm, their outdoor seating in front is the best!",4.0
"At Beco, there's an unofficial two for one deal- a sauna and a meal for the price of a meal.  No need to worry about keeping warm while dining here.Fun, [obviously] hipster vibe at this place where the diners are packed in tightly and the candle lights are kept low.  I had the feijoada which was well made with all sorts of extras on the side.  Though I enjoyed it at the time, it's not the kind of dish I'd come back for again and again.  Overall, solid place.",3.0

The eggs benedict was good but I didn't like that my salad had slimy greens and my potato pancake was partially burnt and black. The drinks are strong which is why I gave an extra star. They offer a prix fixe for brunch ($15) and have decent prices but I'd only come back if I was wasted and couldn't distinguish my left from my right...even though I can't distinguish my left from my right when I'm sober. But, you get my point.***CASH ONLY***",2.0
This is my favorite brunch spot in north side. It is pretty much all Brazilian faire so great option if you are searching for something different for midday boozy dining. Sweet and tropical cocktails paired with extremely spicy entrees. I guess the spiciness mainly comes from the pickled chilies on the table.,5.0
"One star is pushing it. I haven't had an awful experience at a restaurant in such a long time so kudos to Beco for breaking my winning streak.I was looking to find a place with outdoor seating b/c I had my dog with me. Thanks to Yelp, I found what sounded like a great brunch spot to try. My group of 3 headed there and found seating fairly quickly despite the brunch rush. There were 3 waitresses working, 2 who appeared nice and had a pleasant demeanor and 1 with an attitude who sauntered back and forth. Lucky for us, we had the latter. I should've known it was going to be a shitty experience when I politely asked for a water dish for my dog and she replied, ""Yup, I've been doing it all day."" But the food smelled amazing so I sucked it up.She took our orders quickly and while waiting for our food and drinks, had the opportunity to experience the following:1) Drinks take a while to come to your table. By this time, the place was already emptying out.2) Never checked on us to see if we needed any refills, granted all we had was 1 bloody mary and the rest, water. I had to purposely place the empty bloody mary at the edge of the table for someone to take a hint but I guess that was still too cryptic for them.3) Overheard our waitress happily chatting with 2 older men about how annoying Yelp is, that it's for losers and they need to find a real job. However, she does take the time to read them but also gets annoyed at the lengthy reviews and if you have something bad to say, then just get to it. Hope these bullet points work for her.4) Didn't realize 45 min. passed since we last ordered but as my group contemplated about leaving, our waitress sauntered over and mentioned that she ""did a terrible thing to us."" She FORGOT to put our order in. She tried to make amends by offering drinks and getting anything we needed while she put the rush order in. I only agreed to wait the ""10 minutes"" for the food b/c hell, we were there for 45 min. already.5)We ordered another bloody mary but 5 min. later, I saw the waitress offer a free bloody mary to the woman next to us and mentioned something about it being complimentary since it's one of the last ones left. What happened to ours? I'll never know.We finally decided to leave and my BF was considerate enough to pay for the 1 bloody mary he did drink and mentioned to the waitress that we're leaving. She didn't seem to care at all so yeah....am I ever going back to Beco?

"I haven't had much experience with Brazilian cuisine, so this is more from an objective, how-good-it-tasted standpoint, rather than an authentic/inauthentic perspective.So...what I've had before coming to Beco was the Pao de Queijo, when one of my Buddhist friends, who was Brazilian, would bring it to gatherings. It was cheesy and bready. I'd assumed that what she brought was the real deal, so when I got the pao at Beco, I was a little disappointed by how chewy it was. The texture kind of reminds me of Japanese mochi or the way some Chinese and Korean bakeries put mochi in their baked breads. So now I know that Pao de Queijo is *supposed* to be chewy, and if I want a more bread pao, I'd have to go to the place (in Astoria somewhere) where my friend got hers.Next, the feijoada, the national dish of Brazil. A friend said that this was very good and authentic, albeit a bit thick. I didn't like it as much, as I was expecting more meat and less beans (I'm not a huge fan of beans). I did like the side of sauteed kale, though. It tasted so much like sauteed Chinese greens (don't know the name in English).The linguica was ok...kind of plain and boring. Not even as much flavor as the chorizo I've gotten at Colombian restaurants (not the same thing, but they're both sausages).Finally, the caipirinha that I had was like a bitter, mint-less, sugar-less version of a mojito.

The caipirinha is the beverage of choice - good anytime of the year or day for that matter.It's also amazing to witness the sheer amount and quality of food they are able to turn out in that tiny, tiny kitchen space.",4.0
"My go-to place for a light dinner, or casual date night with the boyfriend.  We almost always get the same thing- pao de queijo to start, the vegetariano sandwich for me, the bauru sandwich for him, and a glass of vinho verde.  I've probably had this same meal 15 times and never get tired of it.The prato feito is another great option, if you're feeling a little more hungry- you can choose from a variety of sides, including eggs, beans, rice, farofa, and vegetables to put together your own plate of 4 items.  The food is simple, well-portioned and consistently tasty.The staff is very laid-back and friendly, and the atmosphere is cozy.  When the weather is warm, their outdoor seating in front is the best!",4.0
"At Beco, there's an unofficial two for one deal- a sauna and a meal for the price of a meal.  No need to worry about keeping warm while dining here.Fun, [obviously] hipster vibe at this place where the diners are packed in tightly and the candle lights are kept low.  I had the feijoada which was well made with all sorts of extras on the side.  Though I enjoyed it at the time, it's not the kind of dish I'd come back for again and again.  Overall, solid place.",3.0
"Don't come here if you're hard of hearing.Do come here if you like LOUD NOISES.Don't come here if you want good service.Do come here if you like waitresses that forget your order and bring out your meal ass backwards. The food is okay, and unfortunately, due to loud noises and confusion, we didn't order the Feijoada which is Brazil's national dish. The eggs benedict was good but I didn't like that my salad had slimy greens and my potato pancake was partially burnt and black. The drinks are strong which is why I gave an extra star. They offer a prix fixe for brunch ($15) and have decent prices but I'd only come back if I was wasted and couldn't distinguish my left from my right...even though I can't distinguish my left from my right when I'm sober. But, you get my point.***CASH ONLY***",2.0
This is my favorite brunch spot in north side. It is pretty much all Brazilian faire so great option if you are searching for something different for midday boozy dining. Sweet and tropical cocktails paired with extremely spicy entrees. I guess the spiciness mainly comes from the pickled chilies on the table.,5.0

Our choices were farofa (toasted yucca flour), beans, couve (sautéed, chiffonaded collard greens), and abobrinha (sautéed, julienned zucchini). They were all very good, apart from the farofa, which is just some sort of flour you add to the beans if they are too loose.We then ordered feijoada (a stew of beans with beef and pork meats), which apparently is Brazil's national dish. In fact, I would suggest you get this dish: the beans taste better with pork and beef (trust me on this: I'm a doctor), and the dish comes with collard greens. I also liked the fact that the chopped greens for the dressing came in a shot glass: nice touch!Both our waitress and the bartender were friendly and good.If you don't mind the eyesore on the other side of the street (one of the ugliest buildings this side of the iron curtain), I would say this is a good spot for a relaxed, unpretentious, and somewhat cozy date.",4.0

"Beco is a simple, inviting Brazilian cafe right near McCarren Park. We wandered by and the table in the window convinced us to stay and have the Caldo Verde, the Berinjela, the Bauru and the Pao de Queijo. Don't feel bad, I don't speak Portuguese either.The Caldo Verde is a potato soup with collard greens. Definitely tasty, and I highly recommend you add the chorizo for $2. It's still only $6 in total, and the sausage adds a nice little kick. In fact, I don't think you should order it without chorizo. (Unless you're a vegetarian. And if you are, you should rethink that decision. It's not that I want to get into an ethical debate or anything. It's just that - and I'm not an expert on vegetarianism so don't quote me on this - I'm pretty sure you're not allowed to eat chorizo. And chorizo is really good. Just some food for thought. Get it? This is the longest parenthetical tangent I've ever gone on.)Next up was the Berinjela, an eggplant dip served with nice, warm pita. It wasn't what I was expecting, but that's probably because I'm not that bright. I was expecting baba ghanoush, and this is a Brazilian spot. Still very tasty, especially with a few drops of the homemade hot sauce on the table. The Bauru is a steak sandwich with tomatoes, and cheddar-like cheese. Very juicy, very nice, and decently priced at $9, especially if it is actually filet mignon (I have my doubts, but I can't prove anything). I would say that this needed a condiment, but in addition to the hot sauce, there's a little jar of this fantastic chimichurri on every table. Use it liberally. The presentation was great, too. There were these miniature sides: I got tiny pickles* in a shot glass, and microscopic fries (really just potato stix) in a little metal bowl. I actually enjoyed the dinkiness** of food items. That never happens!Our last item was the Pao De Queijo, which are essentially little bread balls, filled with cheese. Can't be bad, right? Well, they were actually a bit bland without the table sauces. But chimichurri and hot sauce make everything better. I'm going to start carrying them around with me.

"Folks I hate to break it to you, but this is not Brazilian... The food isn't bad, (Not great either). But they have what I'd call an identity crisis. If you just walked in unbeknownst of the fact that this is a Brazilian place you won't hate it, but you'll think you're eating anything other than Brazilian food. All this said, it's a nice place to hang out, and if the right bar tender is working you'll get a great Caipirinha. Pair that with a ""Mixto quente"" which is not bad at all, and hopefully with good company you'll have a good time.Not sure if they always have the same guys, but once I was there and there was a Trio, that was nothing short of fantastic. They played some beautifully nostalgic chorinhos......que me deu saudades...",2.0
"I was recently here on a Friday night. It took a while to find the place as it seems off the beaten path, but it was totally worth it. It was bustling, but not overwhelming. We sat at the bar, which was fine. Bartender was busy and distracted, but friendly and cool. There was live music, which was awesome. Great atmosphere for something casual but intimate. Unfortunately, the kitchen was closing as I got there (11ish), so I didn't bother sampling any of the main dishes, which looked great. Had the bruschetta and the Whisky w/ Coconut water (ok. I had a few). Perfect snack and the drink was a pleasant novelty. I would definitely go back for the food any time of day.",4.0

"Beco is like a hug. It always seems to be open with a full menu -- whether 7am or 1am. Their Brazilian specialties are incredible and even their simple dishes like the omelette are exceptional -- fluffy and fresh. It's an often overlooked detail, but if you're a snob about well-dressed salads, you'll be happy with Beco. All the salads are PERFECTLY dressed and seasoned. No soggy greens. No bad oil-to-vin ratios. Best of all, the staff is warm and friendly. They'll move tables to accommodate my baby stroller on a Saturday morning, and they'll let me linger over a glass of wine on a Friday Night, while listening to live music.It is probably one of the best (kept secrets) in Williamsburg.",5.0
"Recommended by a dear friend during our recent trip to NYC. Beco is a small, warm place tucked in the heart (well, one of the ventricles) of Williamsburg, that hipster paradise, but Beco isn't at all pretentious. It's very cozy, and the staff is very friendly, quick with a recommendation for those of us not all that familiar with Brazilian cuisine that doesn't involve massive amounts of charred steak - not that I'm complaining.I thoroughly enjoyed the ""feijoada,"" a black bean and meat stew complemented with rice, farofa (yucca flour), and couve (sauteed collard greens, which I loved), along with a pair of baked empanadas, and a plate of cheese bread, compliments of the house. Very enjoyable!My visit to Beco was also made better by the company of dear friends. I definitely want to go back to Beco the next time I'm in NYC.",4.0

"Winter or Summer, Inside or Out, Beco provides one dynamo of a sandwich. In particular, both the ""Misto Quente"" (a Brazilian croque madame?) and the Vegetariano w/ Minas Cheese are excellent.

"New Year's Day brunch is something I take very seriously. There are few traditions I hold as dear as this one, so choosing Beco as this year's venue was no small thing, especially never having been. I'd walked by it a hundred times or more (probably way less though), and had heard great things from one of my roomiez. The prixe fixe brunch was what caught my eye initially, though. For like $15 you are allowed an entree, an espresso drank, and a boozier option--its like the management are writing prescriptions for hangovers back there.All this aside, the experience itself was lacking. We arrived just before the rush, and thank the good lord, because if I--like others after us--had waited around for a tepid cappuccino, pedestrian steak-and-eggs, and NO mimosa, there would have been a one-man riot on Richardson Street. As it turned out, we did wait an inordinate amount of time for those things to arrive to the table, and we almost missed the early closing of Graham Ave Meats and Deli because of it.*I feel a bit bad, though. It was our server's first day (really?? you're starting a new server for the brunch rush on New Year's Day??), and my girlfriend's french toast was actually pretty great. Neither of us got our booze, but it was taken off the bill, and we got some bloody's on our way home. I'll give this place another shot, but maybe just the one.*Not to worry, we got our sandwiches.",3.0

I've not had one brunch entree there that I wasn't completely satisfied with.If you go there to meet a friend for drinks, get a pitcher of Capirinha.. it may make you drunk off of your ass, but it's worth it. The 'Caldo Verde' and 'Pao de Queijo' (w/chorizo!!) are great snacks to get while drinking. Service is fantastic - everyone is friendly and they often have live music.

"This place has me conflicted. Some really positive things and some negative ones.The food is seriously great. There were four of us here the other night and all of us loved what we had: the moqueca, the housemade gnocchi, feijoada, choripan sandwich. A bunch of dishes I had never heard of before and the adventurous spirit paid off very well. Love the atmosphere too. It's small but cozy, and the fact that the cook is standing in the corner making everything gives the room a great smell and ambience.However, the entrees were a little too expensive for the amount of food you get. Some of us were still hungry after finishing--which may have been our fault arriving ravenous. I still would recommend the sandwiches as much more reasonable and you get just as much food. Additionally, the service wasn't great. Took us forever to grab someone to order, get the check and pay. It's not like they couldn't see us; it's one little room. Plus they only take cash which I find aggravating. Places with entrees close to $20 shouldn't be cash only.I'm optimistic though.

"This was my second time at Beco and I really enjoyed it. The food & drinks are great and generally pretty cheap. We started with the cheese bread & Portuguese sausage which were both amazing.

Great flavor, good bread and it comes with the cutest mini fries you have ever seen. We also worked are way through multiple pitchers  of caipirinhas which were delish and at only $28 each are a good deal. The only reason I won't give this place five stars is because I was pretty unimpressed with the service. We had a reservation but when we arrived they said it would be at least 20 more minutes before we could be seated.

"Had a delicious brunch here. With four, we got a table right away on a Sunday at 1:30. Service was good. Loved my eggs florentine and my fiancé had the special, a beef and bean stew with rice and greens. It was excellent. Decor isn't anything special, just a cute, tiny dive with great food.",5.0
"I love coming here.  Sure, it is small, cramped, and the kitchen is the size of a bathtub, but it never stopped me from enjoying myself.I've tried everything on the menu, and I have also had the privilege of trying new drinks that are soon to be offered at the bar.  The cheese bread is tasty, bauru is a perennial favorite, and the drinks are always mixed right.If slow service gets you down, get a clue.  They want you to relax and have a good time.  Us New Yorkers are so impatient, we mistake slowing down for laziness.  Beco is a terrific place to go with friends or to meet new people.  My only recommendation is that if you have a big party (8 or more) call ahead so they can make accommodations.",5.0
"Love this place as long as I don't bring friends and they run out of their signature filet mignon for brunch.  Small Brazilian spot with a lot of character, great food, great drinks!   Some of the best caipirinhas around.  I think they understand they are a small place but don't over extend themselves and do it wellThe best welcoming atmosphere is when owner is working and the additional outdoor seats for more pleasant weather days was a plus!",5.0
"I love latin brunches and Beco didn't disappoint. $14.95 prix fixe that comes with any regular brunch plate, espresso, and choice of boozy beverage. I usually like the all you can drink spots, but considering I was riding my bike, 6 greyhounds would not be very wise. I had a really refreshing pineapple mint caipirinha, and the bife a cavalo. It came with filet mignon, fried eggs, rice, beans, and salsa. Everything was tasty and fresh.It's a small space but the windows open up with tons of light so even if you're inside you still feel outside. I definitely would like to come back and try their lunch/dinner menu.",5.0
How cute is this place?! I love the vibe and the people And yes it's small but whatevs. My only critique is that I found my food to be a bit salty on more than one occasion (the Feijoada and the Bife A Cavalo) which is a bummer and keeps me from keeping it in my regular rotation.,3.0
"As an authentic Brazilian Yelper, I try to review the Brazilian places on here.  Beco is the best.  It's not a restaurant. I mean, their food is OK.  It's a bit inconsistent.  Sometimes the Pao de Queijo isn't salty enough.  Or sometimes  the Feijoada (which I think is priced a bit too high at like $18) is too creamy.  The linguica is good though.  But, the guys who work here are great.  Daniel the main bartender.  Cynthia.  And the owner Dan.  Dan is great.  He cares about your complaints.  An attentive owner, and that's a good thing.  And he lives across the street so he's always there.Let's get to the booze though.  Good caipirinhas.   Bottles are priced at 3-4 bucks, which is great.  And they have a random beer -- Palma Louca, which is Brazilian, but I've NEVER seen it in Brazil nor heard of it.  I guess it would be like an American going to an American bar in Europe and they happen to sell like Genesee (bc most people havent heard of it).  Although thankfully, it's better than Genesee haha.  Xingu is another beer that for some reason is popular here, but is non-existent in Brazil (think Fosters in Australia).  Presidente.

"Had a delicious brunch here. With four, we got a table right away on a Sunday at 1:30. Service was good. Loved my eggs florentine and my fiancé had the special, a beef and bean stew with rice and greens. It was excellent. Decor isn't anything special, just a cute, tiny dive with great food.",5.0
"I love coming here.  Sure, it is small, cramped, and the kitchen is the size of a bathtub, but it never stopped me from enjoying myself.I've tried everything on the menu, and I have also had the privilege of trying new drinks that are soon to be offered at the bar.  The cheese bread is tasty, bauru is a perennial favorite, and the drinks are always mixed right.If slow service gets you down, get a clue.  They want you to relax and have a good time.  Us New Yorkers are so impatient, we mistake slowing down for laziness.  Beco is a terrific place to go with friends or to meet new people.  My only recommendation is that if you have a big party (8 or more) call ahead so they can make accommodations.",5.0
"Love this place as long as I don't bring friends and they run out of their signature filet mignon for brunch.  Small Brazilian spot with a lot of character, great food, great drinks!   Some of the best caipirinhas around.  I think they understand they are a small place but don't over extend themselves and do it wellThe best welcoming atmosphere is when owner is working and the additional outdoor seats for more pleasant weather days was a plus!",5.0
"I love latin brunches and Beco didn't disappoint. $14.95 prix fixe that comes with any regular brunch plate, espresso, and choice of boozy beverage. I usually like the all you can drink spots, but considering I was riding my bike, 6 greyhounds would not be very wise. I had a really refreshing pineapple mint caipirinha, and the bife a cavalo. It came with filet mignon, fried eggs, rice, beans, and salsa. Everything was tasty and fresh.It's a small space but the windows open up with tons of light so even if you're inside you still feel outside. I definitely would like to come back and try their lunch/dinner menu.",5.0
How cute is this place?! I love the vibe and the people And yes it's small but whatevs. My only critique is that I found my food to be a bit salty on more than one occasion (the Feijoada and the Bife A Cavalo) which is a bummer and keeps me from keeping it in my regular rotation.,3.0
"As an authentic Brazilian Yelper, I try to review the Brazilian places on here.  Beco is the best.  It's not a restaurant. I mean, their food is OK.  It's a bit inconsistent.  Sometimes the Pao de Queijo isn't salty enough.  Or sometimes  the Feijoada (which I think is priced a bit too high at like $18) is too creamy.  The linguica is good though.  But, the guys who work here are great.  Daniel the main bartender.  Cynthia.  And the owner Dan.  Dan is great.  He cares about your complaints.  An attentive owner, and that's a good thing.  And he lives across the street so he's always there.Let's get to the booze though.  Good caipirinhas.   Bottles are priced at 3-4 bucks, which is great.  And they have a random beer -- Palma Louca, which is Brazilian, but I've NEVER seen it in Brazil nor heard of it.  I guess it would be like an American going to an American bar in Europe and they happen to sell like Genesee (bc most people havent heard of it).  Although thankfully, it's better than Genesee haha.  Xingu is another beer that for some reason is popular here, but is non-existent in Brazil (think Fosters in Australia).  Presidente. And occasionally, Quilmes.  And Argentine wine.  Because my Brazilian buddy Thiago and I can be obnoxious, we had no qualms drinking and celebrating our succulent, dominating victory over Argentina by ONLY drinking Argentine booze.  Ahhh.  It made our celebration THAT much better.And more importantly, FUTEBOL.  This is my exclusive place for watching the Seleçao play.  They have a huge projector screen and I've had some memorable evenings here.

My wife also ordered the feijoada but it was too much for her so, of course, more meat for me. I was in vegetarian hell and loved it! I really do like this place, very casual and inviting. The first time I went was on a Saturday and it was really fun, the Brazilian beats were pumpin' and people were groovin' (obviously drunk off caipirinhas). This time was a Tuesday and the place was Bossa Nova and jazz, cool and  relaxed. The decor is still wack but who cares the food is delicious. And as much as I enjoy it, I have to admit, the main reason I am looking forward to go back is for their national cocktail.

"My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this little Brazilian gem while driving by... the warmth of the tealights drew us in on a chilly Sunday night. We'd just had a big dinner elsewhere, but it looked too inviting not to check out, so we stopped in for a drink. So glad we did! I am a huge fan of all things guava, so when I asked the bartender if she could make me something with guava she suggested a Guava Caipirinha. Wow. I'd had Caipirinha's before, but never with guava. Delicious! My boyfriend wanted something warm, so he asked her if she could make him a Bailey's & coffee. She didn't have Bailey's, but offered to make him ""her Mother's homemade version of it"". Wow again! The food smelled wonderful, so we came back with some friends for dinner about a week later. I had the hearts of palm and tomato salad which had a light, vinegary dressing. Simple and fresh. My boyfriend ordered the Caldo Verde: Potato soup with collard greens and chorizo. So yummy. For my entree I tried the Moqueca: Shrimp stew with coconut milk, peppers, cilantro and ginger. My boyfriend had the Feijoada, which is the national dish of Brazil: Smoked meat stew with black beans, farofa and hot sauce. Both were really good. Our friend tried one of the specials: Gnocchi with lamb ragout, which she loved. Beco is a fantastic, cozy spot that's perfect for a romantic dinner or a small group. Can't wait to go back :)",4.0

"So we went there for dinner on Friday night after about half hour deciding where to eat.  It was a wise decision; this place reminds me of being in my tropical paradise.  The decor is simple and cozy and with lively Samba playing but not overly intrusive, the atmosphere gives a feeling of being in Sao Paulo.  Rafael greeted us with a pleasant smile, warm attitude and gave amazing service to boot.  He promptly brought our caipirinhas (8/10 more crushed lime would be nice), and freshly made cheese bread (10/10 absolutely incredible).  We ordered traditional Feijoada (black beans with pork) and shrimp Moqueca both served with white rice and greens and both were exceptional.  Having had the good fortune of visiting Brazil and enjoying their unique cuisine, this little place in Billysburg is truly worth the trip.",4.0

"This place really reminds me of being back in Brazil.  It has a totally laid back vibe, and is a great place to get some snacks, some drinks, and watch some futebol on the weekends.  You can check out my full review on Power-Animals:(power-animals.com/2011/0…)",4.0
"Finally another Brazilian restaurant besides La Casa. I heart farofa! The traditional Brazilian dishes here are the way to go - meaty black beans, garlic chopped kale, farofa, rice - all excellent. Nice wine, too. Attentive service. Oh boy, I sense it will get more crowded now. Oh well, such is life. With Pete's Candy Store right there, too, you never have to leave your cozy little 1 block radius. Heaven.",4.0
"So we went there for dinner on Friday night after about half hour deciding where to eat.  It was a wise decision; this place reminds me of being in my tropical paradise.  The decor is simple and cozy and with lively Samba playing but not overly intrusive, the atmosphere gives a feeling of being in Sao Paulo.  Rafael greeted us with a pleasant smile, warm attitude and gave amazing service to boot.  He promptly brought our caipirinhas (8/10 more crushed lime would be nice), and freshly made cheese bread (10/10 absolutely incredible).  We ordered traditional Feijoada (black beans with pork) and shrimp Moqueca both served with white rice and greens and both were exceptional.  Having had the good fortune of visiting Brazil and enjoying their unique cuisine, this little place in Billysburg is truly worth the trip.",4.0
"my favorite new place in the neighborhood.  my fiance and i went on a warm night, enjoying our happy hour-priced drinks by the window.  he got a whisky/coconut water concoction that did the trick, while i sipped a stella.we started with an eggplant dip appetizer that was perfectly flavored, moved on to our chicken salad and steak sandwiches and finished with banana cake dessert.  the portions were decent, but not gut-busting, and the presentation was simple and effective.  everything tasted extremely fresh and could be dubbed its own brand of chic comfort food.",5.0
"Rockin Bauru.. Filet Mignon extraordinaire... Bangin' bread, crusty and crunchy... small intimate atmosphere with a sense of celebration and enthusiasm - igual Brasil!!!! It was quite empty when I went and I think that is probably the best time to find it...

"The space is a bit cramped, but the food was excellent. I'm definitely kicking myself in the balls for not ordering the fillet mignon, but that's what multiple visits are for. The waitress was as attentive as she could be, considering she was the only person serving about 30 people. I'm sure the tips are worth it, but it must get stressful at times.",4.0

"I was really impressed.  My friend featured them on her website and after that all I could think about was their cheese bread and what things I could plan in W'burg to rope people into escorting me there.  Finally on a Wednesday night an opportunity presented itself, CMJ shows were playing at the new Knitting Factory only 4 blocks away.  We arrive at Beco and it seems way less glamorous than i had imagined it.  I pictured a bar full of hip people sipping Brazilian drinks of muddled fruit and gin.  Instead there were 3 other diners and luncheonette tables.  I ordered as advised by my friend, the vegetable sandwich for me, the beef stew for WB, and an order of the cheese bread.  The food came out quickly, but not too quickly.  The bread on my sandwich was nutty and filling, had great slices of veggies not soaked in oil and a perfect amount of cheese.  WB's beef stew that comes piping hot in a mug was rich. The more I looked for chucks of fat to avoid, it became apparent they were nowhere to be seen.  The waiter was really nice, there was a low key vibe and the prices were really reasonable.  I think the most expensive meal was $18 dollars.  Next time I'm going back for drinks and a basket of cheese bread.",4.0

"Delicious food, great service and cozy ambience! We loved everything that we ordered - the cheesy bread, the arugula salad and the shrimp stew - with the exception of the gnocchi with lamb ragu, which was just ok. The gnocchi wasn't as light and pillowy as I would like it to be. The cheesy bread was hot, straight out of the oven with a cheesy gooey center but not in a gross, heavy way that trashy American pizza tends to be. The arugula salad was perfectly dressed with buttery butter beans and beets. I could have eten just that for dinner and been perfectly happy. My shrimp stew was velvety and hearty but again, without being overly heavy. It came with delicious garlicky greens. Overall, the meal was very satisfying!",4.0
"Great place!  I came with a big group for a birthday dinner and even though the place is small (we probably took up 1/3 of the entire restaurant), they were completely accommodating and didn't rush us at all.   Delicious drinks (try the caipirinha or the whiskey with coconut water), reasonably priced / tasty food and great music.  Make sure to try the pao de queijo.One of my new favorites!",5.0

"About time I review Beco. I've only been enjoying their mouth watering, fresh fruit and lime muddled caipirinhas (love strawberry-mint, pineapple best) and other yummy food items for over six months now. Simple, warm lighting and wooden furnishings, reminiscent of such laid back spots in Brazil (i've heard). Pao de quiejo made fresh. Banana cheese sandwich, shrimp moqueca, and feijoada are mmmmmm mmm! Kind staff and attentive owners. Brunch is also amazing - delicious herbed omelets and most likely, very interesting conversation with fellow bar stool mates. sigh, smile...",5.0

I love this place. Sure the service isn't perfect. The waitresses seem sorta aloof but that doesn't bother me. The food is great and my favorite time to come here is brunch.

Brunch was delicious and a good value even though it seemed expensive at first glance to the menu. You get coffee and juice or alcohol with your meal for roughly $14.95 and a ton of food. Everything was very fresh and our eggs were perfectly cooked which is sometimes a challenge to find in Williamsburg.The interior of this restaurant is lovely and decorated in a minimal 1970's style with chocolate brown tile behind the open kitchen.Very cool and tasty. Can't wait to go back.,5.0
"This little multi-hyphenate, restaurant-bar-cafe serves up amazing traditional Brazilian food in its friendly, inviting atmosphere.  The first time my boyfriend and I came here I wasn't too hungry so I ordered the hearts of palm brushetta and bean soup.  It was so simple, yet so delicious - the light smooth texture of the soup was just so good, especially when you add the burned yucca flour to it.  You have to ask for that on the side, but I think it's so good I would eat it with anything and everything.  Bu the truly stand out dish of the night was what my boyfriend ordered - the - I think it was Wednesday night special - but I might be mistaken  - beef stewed in red wine. My taste buds are still yearning for that. I have to remember what night they have it so I can get it again.  I told the owner Dan, who is as nice as can be and who also happened to use his carpentry skills to build the restaurant that the beef stew was too good to not always have on the menu.  Damn, I want some right now.  When I went back I ate the potato soup with collards, again simple done well, and the chicken salad which is not like chicken salad I've had before - the texture is crunchy from the shoe-string potatoes in there. Another great thing is that they also play soccer matches on their projector when there is a big game on.  Just a perfect place to sit back, have a unique cocktail - condensed milk and whiskey anyone? And just chill out in the lax environment of Beco.",5.0
