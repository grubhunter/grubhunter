"This place never disappoints.  While everyone is waiting on line at EGG for brunch last Sunday, I slipped in here and had a much tastier (and healthier) meal that tasted so fresh.   Beets with eggs, made gluten free for my friend who ordered the same thing.  Yummy.   I always take friends from out of town here.The best combination of affordability and gourmet taste.",5.0
"Look, I LOVE the food, been coming here for ages. But waitresses/waiters, STOP plopping down next to me and mumbling through the menu (I know this is what you're instructed to do, so I guess i'm talking to the mgmt here). To make it even more confusing, the dishes are unique, complex (delicious, like I said), but all they scribble down on your table while they tell you is ""SOUP"" for example (when the soup they're vocally describing is something like butternut squash with a balsamically reduced brussel sprout on top and a cracker baked with manchego). I don't wanna have to ask again what there is to eat. Luckily I usually just go for the burger here because its so damn good. I will raise this to 5 stars gladly if they just smarten up a little bit and stop acting like they're hungover.",2.0
"I really want to like this place, but my recent visit did not prove that either. Instead I became sure about my review. The intentions are good. The Diner-style joint is really cozy, the food decent - but the service is just a pain. Really, really terrible. Not a smile, not even a small-talk. The three waitresses did not say anything to me. Not welcome, not goodbye, nothing in between - Nothing. It is quite a talent actually. Big applause. They do not like their job. Fair enough, I suggest they find another one.The food is important and their burger is decent. Do no get the hype though. I miss something to blow me away. The bun is a little worthless, while the beef and cheese is good. They do need some kind of sauce. Everything becomes bread-meat which can be good if the meat is extraordinary - it just isn't. The fries are good though, while I really love their homemade sauces like mayo and ketchup.Dear Diner. I had hoped for a long relationship. I even gave you a second chance, yet you proved something else. I will not visit you again, so sorry.",2.0
"When I saw the outside of this place I thought I was sadly mistaken. How the hell did I bookmark this place and how does this place have 400+ reviews and 4 stars? The outside looks like a gross, run down mobile home and the door is a piece of sh*t that's hard to open. But the inside of this restaurant is what caught me by surprised. It's small and does look like its namesake, a diner. The food was anything but generic, diner food. They obviously did not put a lot of money in the ambiance of this joint. There are no menus, no tablecloths only candles. No sort of decor whatsoever. What they did put all their money into was the food. They're menus change daily I'm assuming since the waitress had to hand write what they were serving on paper tablecloth in front of us. For appetizers we ordered the beets with yogurt and the beef tartare. The beets were heavenly! I wish I knew what type of reduction was on those beets. It was so delicious and the yogurt complemented them perfectly. The beef tartare had a fried egg on top which always excites me. The toast it was served on unfortunately was burnt, hard and cold. I will probably not order it again. For the entree my friend ordered the char (a fish I have never tried until Diner) with broccoli raab. I ordered the whole trout that was butterflied and deboned. The char was good. The broccoli raab was smokey and delish. But it was the trout that took the cake and gave this place 5 stars. It was to die for! It was served lentils with a spicy kick. For dessert we ordered the apple cheddar tartine. Perfectly sweet but I wish it was larger. I will return to Diner. They cook food perfectly and only focus on that.",5.0
"Skip dinner come for the desserts. Very cool, authentic and pretentious. Everything you would expect from Brooklyn's best diner by Peter Luger. But considering you need a exceptional memory to decide what to eat and the servings are small and over priced I wouldn't be back.",3.0
"This is a fun, trendy, spot that is a converted rail road car.  It's small with no pomp and circumstance, but the service and food are great. There are no menus, instead your hipster waiter writes thing like ""fish"" or ""salad"" on the table while she gives a robust description of the preparation. The toast, salad and whole fish were excellent. I'll be back! It's perfect for a girls night out or double date. Not great for groups or an intimate date night.",4.0
"Okay, first a little precedence.  As a vintage resident of the pre-beard 'hood, I've dined at Diner since they opened.  When Caroline was around, the food was terrific.  Some meals were transcendent in that farm to table way - the uncommon amazement on a produce-barren winter eve.  Don't get me wrong, there were the occasional clunkers, particularly on the odd, over-booked fashionista weekends.  And, please don't misunderstand, the place has never ever been considered ""cheap"".  I chalked this up to all the ""good, clean, fair"" Petrini-rhetoric about the virtues of local and sustainable (which, as someone who works in the biz, I'm totally down with).  The food value seemed okay, back then.  But this...THI$ is a new level of F'd-up...My assistant and I were headed over the ""bridge"" on our way back from Manhattan.  We debated lunch, ""Pies n Thighs...($45 lunch for 2)??  Naw, we haven't been to Diner in a long time...""(Reference attached Diner check)First off:The name chilaquiles is derived from a Nahuatl word meaning ""in a salsa of chiles.""  It is sometimes nicknamed ""a broken-up old sombrero"" because it contains broken pieces of old, dried tortillas.  In short, it is a dish devised by poor folks to salvage food that would ordinarily be tossed to the pigs - poor folk food.It's curious how this po' folk food comes to cost $16!While the Diner chilaquiles were serviceable, they did lack soul in a way things usually do when they get reinvented.  I failed to see how (or, if it is possible/necessary for...) these stale tortillas could have been elevated to a point where they deserved a $16 price tag... $10??...$12...sure...hell, even $14!  But, FREEKIN' $16...for a LUNCH chilaquiles?!?...and, then:There was the coffee.  Seriously??  $7.50(!) for two(!) plain ol' cups of coffee?!? ...and, the pièce de résistance:A SINGLE, $14 slice of chocolate cake!!!  This slice of flourless chocolate cake was fine, but fer crissakes...?!?!  I can only surmise that it was made with some of that ""fancy"" ""single source"" chocolate from those now-defrocked (vanityfair.com/news/2015…) Billyburg dipsters who have been parading around in the King's New Clothes, just down the road, for waaay too long.  Why else would a $6 slice of cake show up on your tab as a $14(!!!) slice of cake???Of course, all of this price rage might have been mitigated if you only had a heads-up.  At the Diner, any discussion of menu prices is some how considered an affront to locavore mores.  The menu is scribbled on a diner's paper table covering (which at a vintage time, was actually considered quaint).  This hen's scratch, in addition to not being clear regarding menu items is even more cryptic regarding prices.  Why else would a sane individual order $16 chilaquiles for lunch?!?So...Staring at our $90 (with a 20% tip) Williamsburg lunch tab (see attached photo), we couldn't help but ruminate how nice the cloth tablecloth lunch might have been over in Manhattan... at Jean-Georges.  Jean-Georges Vongerichten, one of only five Three Michelin-starred chefs in New York, consistently awarded four stars by the New York Times and three Michelin stars:JEAN-GEORGES 1 CENTRAL PARK WESTLunch Prix Fixe $38Choice of Appetizer, Entrée and DessertAppetizer*Butternut Squash Soup, Black Trumpet Mushrooms, Chives *Fried Calamari, Basil Salt, Citrus-   Chili Dip*Tuna Tartare, Avocado, Spicy Radish, Ginger Marinade*Shrimp Salad, Avocado, Tomato, Champagne Vinegar Dressing*Baby Beet Salad, Black Olive and Feta CheeseEntrée*Fresh Spaghetti with Basil Pesto, Roasted Brussels Sprouts*Rigatoni with Meatballs and Smoked Pepper-Tomato Ragu*Sautéed Black Sea Bass, Caramelized Cauliflower and Poppy Seed-Buttermilk Vinaigrette *Sesame Crusted Salmon with Sautéed Potatoes, Black Olives and Passion Fruit*Roasted Hake, Black Beans, Avocado and Cilantro*Roasted Organic Chicken with Artichokes, Shitakes and Parmesan Jus*Veal Milanese with Parmesan, Escarole and Lemon*Cheeseburger, Crispy Onions, Russian DressingDessert*Jean-Georges Warm Chocolate Cake, Vanilla Bean Ice Cream Almond Cake, Green Apple Sorbet, Crème FraîcheAlright, while it turns out Mr. Vongerichten does not have $16 chilaquiles on his lunch menu, he does have many other ""decent"" offerings and... guess what...???A Jean-Georges lunch is THE SAME DAMN PRICE!!!  And...three courses with NO DESSERT SHARING!!Gotta call a BIG FAT B$ on this one!Sorry Andrew, sorry Mark, gunna haf'ta leave you boys to the Chinese tourists and the luxe-condo, Ivy League ""artists"".To quote the late Joey Ramone...¡Adiós Amigos!",1.0

The play on a diner with edge, if you will.The food is fantastic. Nothing you order will disappoint. Most recently, I was there and had the BEST CAKE OF MY LIFE. Notice the caps, take it in, because I take cake seriously. This Olive Oil cake rocked my world and did things for me that I didn't know cake could do.John from Diner was so sweet and gave me his email to get this recipe! Alas, maybe I typed it in wrong, but the email bounced. John, if you are at all paying attention to Yelp reviews, please let me know how I can recreate this magic cake!",5.0

"It was pretty great. I was there for dinner on a sat night.  I have to say from the menu being written down on our table paper to friendly waitress (and they were incredibly busy) to great wine to great food. It is somewhat packed in there with tables. So, you may do fam style seating which is okay, but I wouldn't suggest if you are wanting to be somewhat private. Food is pretty good. The fam style sharing of small plates is good. Order some of the great apps. a couple entrees to share. Definitely not gourmet, but on the side of comfort/trendy/organic creative dishes. Decor is pretty simple and original. Diner turned into upscale, slightly hipster and low light romantic place. Easily could be a cool place found in east village, LES.

Well, we were but when the waitress came over she took it away from us, sat down at our table with us, and began writing on the table cover. She wrote out the entire menu for the day from memory and told us in detail what each one was.The food was so simple and yet totally unique and incredibly delicious. They took basic dishes and transformed them into top notch items. Hints of flavors in every bite that I would have never expected to find or enjoy in combination with one another were pleasantly surprising me at every turn.The ambiance here is a cleaned up dirty.

You can always expect to enjoy unique combinations. I absolutely recommend trying the scone or donuts/donut holes with every brunch. If you're visiting Williamsburg or live in the area, this is not a place to miss. I live a few blocks away and I am angry at myself for not checking it out sooner. Again, if you want to go to a place that cares about their food and provides  interesting choices, definitely come here!",5.0
"Funky little place with a creative menu. Creative in its inventiveness, preparation, and presentation. When I say presentation I refer to how the menu is given to you. They don't (or didn't when we were there) have a printed menu. The server writes it on the table. Which seems cool except our server didn't have very good handwriting, the place is dark, and it was a bit noisy so we couldn't really hear what the choices were. Consequently we pretty much just had to have them repeat the menu choices again. That was just a quirk to the place. Certainly no reason to avoid it. The food and cocktails were very good.",4.0

"We came here because of the great reviews I saw, but I don't think it really lives up to them, and the price range really should be $$$. Like everybody mentioned, they don't have a regular menu. After they seat you, they tell you what they are serving for the day. It's an interesting experience, but I would've liked to have a real menu and see the ingredients and the prices ahead of time. We ordered the duck leg and the burger. Both were good, but not *very* good. The burger was $15 base, plus $2 each for cheese and tomato; the duck leg was $22. They were also serving steaks and pork chops, and for the price of them, you'd hope they'd be dry aged like Peter Luger's (I didn't ask). When the waitress was telling us the prices, I felt like I should have read the reviews more carefully. Overall, for the price of the food, I was a little underwhelmed.

"This place definitely gets rave reviews just because people feel bad hating on somewhere that has a solid consensus.Definitely, do not believe the hype. I've come here twice, now and both times have been so underwhelmed with the quality of the food that I couldn't really finish it. It just grossed me out. I truly have no problem with whole fish, obscure cuts of meat and anything that picky eaters would eliminate. In fact, I love them and order them all the time.Last night I went with a friend to Diner at about 7:30 and was seated right away. The service was abysmally slow from the beginning. We sat there hanging out, looking forward to all the buzz until the waitress graced us with her presence. She had a very unhelpful attitude, scrawled on the table as we knew she would and walked away. We ordered the Butter Beans, which were just fine. I enjoyed them, except for the fact that they arrived after another extremely long wait. The waitress came by and removed them from our table before we were really done with them. Next came out the Bluefish and the Short-Ribs. If they had been served to us at a different restaurant we would have been disgusted, really. But because they came from Diner, we gave them the benefit of the doubt. Both were over-oiled, leaving our mouths greasy and thick with goo. The veggies were wilted and had no snap. The Bluefish, already being such a strong fish was actually smoked and tasted like a bagel spread.There's also the fact that you don't know the cost of anything because the waiters don't write the prices on the table, which is kind of scary if you want to have a sense of what you're getting. And when you want to order, it's not very helpful that you don't remember, ""does this dish has anchovies or was it ramps?""It's an extremely loud restaurant, also which takes away from the romantic appeal of sitting in those cute diner booths.Very, very bad experience in all.

"Came to this place cuz it was rated 4stars on yelp.. but it was the most disappointing brunch ive ever had in nyc. They change their menu daily so the waitress comes up to give a verbal menu. And initially I thought it was interesting but then I saw how quickly it became a fault. They were serving ""steak n eggs"" with beef heart and beef liver which sounded so irresitably original. But I thought it would be steak with a side of heart n liver so u have some meat to fall back on. And prior to my ordering, I had asked the waitress if there was an actual flank of some sort to which she replied yes. Miscommunication error. I was starving... and for my liver eaters.. youd understand when I say there's only so much liver u can eat before it gets overbearing. That side of eggs was a big relief.Of the other things I had.. the all-liked grassfed burger was really not so pleasing. It's nicely ground n my boyfriend had it ordered medium. I usually like my meat medium rare n I couldnt even bring myself to sink my teeth in without telling them to recook it. So after attempt #2, we had a medium rare burger that was tasteless. Luckily they do have a very nice light mayo that u can smother it in. Side of fries.. good when salted, but after a couple, u can taste that the oil they fried it in was a bit stale.The second best thing on the table was a trout. They give you two good sized pieces that's seared with the skin on so it's nice n crisp. Fish was nicely cooked n came with brussel sprouts which were also good.Best thing on the table were the side of chips that came with a chicken burger. I didnt get to try the chicken burger. But the chips were freshly fried n seasoned so that theyre just the right bit of spicy.

"Don't let the name fool you. This place is nothing like a traditional diner except in the way it's laid out. And that's a good thing. The small and upscale menu changes daily, and I'd say the average price of an entree is about 25-35 dollars (burgers are less). My boyfriend and I came here on a Friday night around 7. There was a 35-minute wait for a table, so we opted to sit at the bar, which was perfectly fine. We were given a drinks menu as well as a handwritten food menu. I wasn't sure what to expect from the cocktails here, but my boyfriend's Tom Collins was great as was my gimlet. For food, I got the bluefish with mussels, and my boyfriend got the burger. The fish and mussels were excellent and were the right amount of food--not too much, not too little. My boyfriend is pretty particular about burgers and is often disappointed when he orders them at places that allegedly have great ones, but he reported that this burger was the best one he's had in NYC. They actually cooked it the way he wanted it (medium rare), and it was juicy. The fries were great also (I sampled some). For dessert, we split the flourless chocolate cake, which was amazing and decadent. It's a pretty decent size, so I recommend splitting it unless you're super hungry.The bartenders were nice and attentive; the ambiance was casual; and most importantly, the food was stellar. I will definitely be coming back here.",5.0
"Great food. Great experience. All of the items available that night are written out on the table in front of you as the server explains each dish in detail.

The ambiance was cozy and the wait staff were very attentive and knowledgeable about food and wine. Overall, highly recommended.",4.0
"This is the epitome of new Brooklyn (in a good way). Diner is a cramped little old school diner (circa 1920s) reclaimed and turned into a go-to destination for delicious food cooked and prepared by someone who really cares. Definitely no crappy diner food here. The only issue is the prices are a little high and portions are a little small, nothing outrageous though. I was so pleased with my meal that it didn't bother me that I wasn't full leaving the place, something that normally bothers me a lot more. I came here for brunch and got the country breakfast ($13) which was a biscuit, split and topped with sausage gravy served with a couple scrambled eggs and some greens. I'd go as far as to say these were the best biscuits and gravy I've ever had. As far as other prices, you're looking at $5 for bacon or OJ, mimosas and draft beer started at $7 though they did have bottles for $5, and diner entrees here are in the mid 20s. As I said, not cheap but from my experience, delicious.",4.0
"God this place is so annoying! When we sat down to eat, the waitress comes over to tell us what's on the menu. She reels off long and complicated dishes, and then scrawls with a pen on the table single words like 'toast' or 'chicken'. No details, no prices, nothing. It's so irritating and pretentious. It was hard not hard not to laugh. Hey - I went to a restaurant once and they had all the dishes typed up with details and prices for everything. What an ingenious innovation! Or even just write it up on a chalkboard if it changes so often you don't want to waste printer ink.I have to admit that the food was really good, although when the check came and it was $125 for two of us I kind of wished I'd asked the prices for everything.",3.0

There was a 35-minute wait for a table, so we opted to sit at the bar, which was perfectly fine. We were given a drinks menu as well as a handwritten food menu. I wasn't sure what to expect from the cocktails here, but my boyfriend's Tom Collins was great as was my gimlet. For food, I got the bluefish with mussels, and my boyfriend got the burger. The fish and mussels were excellent and were the right amount of food--not too much, not too little. My boyfriend is pretty particular about burgers and is often disappointed when he orders them at places that allegedly have great ones, but he reported that this burger was the best one he's had in NYC. They actually cooked it the way he wanted it (medium rare), and it was juicy. The fries were great also (I sampled some). For dessert, we split the flourless chocolate cake, which was amazing and decadent. It's a pretty decent size, so I recommend splitting it unless you're super hungry.The bartenders were nice and attentive; the ambiance was casual; and most importantly, the food was stellar. I will definitely be coming back here.",5.0
"Great food. Great experience. All of the items available that night are written out on the table in front of you as the server explains each dish in detail. The menu seem to change regularly.I chose the duck as a main dish and Diner's twist on consomme as my starter. Both were great. The ambiance was cozy and the wait staff were very attentive and knowledgeable about food and wine. Overall, highly recommended.",4.0
"This is the epitome of new Brooklyn (in a good way). Diner is a cramped little old school diner (circa 1920s) reclaimed and turned into a go-to destination for delicious food cooked and prepared by someone who really cares. Definitely no crappy diner food here. The only issue is the prices are a little high and portions are a little small, nothing outrageous though. I was so pleased with my meal that it didn't bother me that I wasn't full leaving the place, something that normally bothers me a lot more. I came here for brunch and got the country breakfast ($13) which was a biscuit, split and topped with sausage gravy served with a couple scrambled eggs and some greens. I'd go as far as to say these were the best biscuits and gravy I've ever had. As far as other prices, you're looking at $5 for bacon or OJ, mimosas and draft beer started at $7 though they did have bottles for $5, and diner entrees here are in the mid 20s. As I said, not cheap but from my experience, delicious.",4.0
"God this place is so annoying! When we sat down to eat, the waitress comes over to tell us what's on the menu. She reels off long and complicated dishes, and then scrawls with a pen on the table single words like 'toast' or 'chicken'. No details, no prices, nothing. It's so irritating and pretentious. It was hard not hard not to laugh. Hey - I went to a restaurant once and they had all the dishes typed up with details and prices for everything. What an ingenious innovation! Or even just write it up on a chalkboard if it changes so often you don't want to waste printer ink.I have to admit that the food was really good, although when the check came and it was $125 for two of us I kind of wished I'd asked the prices for everything.",3.0
"Went to Diner last night because I somehow remembered it as a cozy and delicious neighborhood bistro (I lived in Wburg in 2000 long before hipsters invaded like ants to a deserted picnic.) Alas, we were led to a rocking table outside where one of our two chairs was also doubling as a door stop. The warm, unmistakable smell of rotting carcass permeated the breezy night air. Our waitress approached and in hungry expectation, we awaited the menu presentation. Instead, she informed us there would be no antiquated written list for us to hold in our hands. While jotting down words on our paper table cloth with a pen, she rambled a list of culinary vocabulary as if reading from a Cordon Bleu text book. When she was finished, we looked down to see a mouthwatering description of choices that read exactly as such: Starter, Salad, Blue Fish, Fish, Hen, Meat, Big Meat, Pork.  We asked for GASP! a printed menu because our lesser brains couldn't remember anything she recited aside from, ""Tonight we have some food."" But clearly we are consumerist morons because she scolded us and pronounced, ""Our menu changes daily and it would be a total waste of paper to print out menus everyday."" Somewhere, in the annals of my memory, I seemed to recall seeing this phrase on sheets of deconstructed trees at another eating establishment: Menu Changes Daily. But I've traveled a lot and eaten at a lot of places so who knows, I could be totally making that up. Embarrassed that our short term memory loss prevented us from deciding between Meat and Big Meat, we made a mad dash for Marlow and Sons, which happened to be right next door. The odor of decomposing corpse immediately vanished. I marveled at the chef's DAILY selections on the printed menu that was placed directly into my hands. And after a delicious meal of local Blue Fish with Cannellini Beans with Croutons and a Brick Chicken with Green Beans, we were offered a giant bag of complimentary pastries to take with us.

"I want to cry writing this review, because alas, this was my favorite go-to restaurant when I lived in Brooklyn, and I miss it so, so much.I don't know what it is about this place. Despite the sometimes unfriendly Hipster waitstaff, and the almost unbearable Hipster clientele that make up 95% of the Diner scene, I simply could not get enough of this place. At 6'3"", 240 pounds, I'd manage to bend my body in half and squeeze my giant frame through the tiny door of this original, barely-refurbished 1927 diner, week after week, just for the privilege of eating their amazing food.(How's that for an intro to a 5-star restaurant?)Vapid Hipsters aside, I know EXACTLY what it is about this place:The food. There's no real menu at Diner, save for the burger and steaks which are always available. You learn the menu at Diner when your server sits down with you and writes it out on the parchment-like paper that serves as a tablecloth. The menu can change almost daily, though the theme of ingredients used will typically last through a month or so. Pay attention -- for the whole writing-on-the-table thing is a useless gimmick. For example, as the server describes to you the most amazing salad with 20 ingredients grown fresh from their local farm, all they write on the table is ""SALAD."" Not too helpful when you need to recall the 11 or 12 extremely verbose items they just finished reading to you. The food at Diner is simply amazing. When I moved to Brooklyn, I ate, like 4 or 5 different things, and generally refused to try anything new. I never believed I would try so many new foods until I came to Diner. Diner was my breakthrough. Every single thing I ever got talked into trying here (hello, rabbit?) I ended up not just liking, but LOVING. Diner's food is so fresh and so well prepared that I will pretty much try anything they serve up here.But when it's all said and done, what's the most standout, special thing Diner serves? The burger. Raised from cows on their own farm, and ground to order, Diner makes a burger that must have crack in it, because its amazingness defies reality. I have never, ever had a burger this good. No matter how you order it, it will come out rare-to-barely medium rare. Meaning, it will still be twitching and bleeding when it arrives on your plate. And that's the crack, I think. I used to eat burgers medium-to-medium well, but Diner converted me and showed me what I was missing out on. Perhaps I'm a vampire, I dunno. But you haven't lived until you've eaten a burger from Diner. The fries are amazing too. As is the homemade mayo. DO NOT PUT KETSCHUP ON YOUR BURGER OR FRIES HERE. It's mayo or nothing.Oh, how I miss you Diner. You're like that ex-girlfriend I wish I could bang again.",5.0
"Very average brunch experience. And about 25% more expensive than it should be.  $15 for grits with 3 shrimp.  $9 for 4 deep-fried golfball sized doughnuts. Cold chick pea salad (cold like a fridge, not room temperature) with a cold poached egg. Silly system of the waitress reciting the specials (can they not print up a daily menu?) and then scribbling one word descriptions (eg. ""poached"") on the paper table setting. No price mentioned. Very average bloody mary.Really cool, pro, gracious hostess named Alexandra. Otherwise all good service and team work.Nothing bad about this place. I just excepted more. Too many other awesome brunches in Bk to bother coming back here.",3.0
This place has a small menu of simple but delicious dishes and a charming old-school diner atmosphere -- grab a booth with a view of the JMZ trains rattling by overhead or take a stool at the counter for the full diner experience.

"First of all let me say that my tolerance for Williamsburg and its denizens is extremely low. My sister lives there though and she picked this place and so I that's how I ended up taking the L to hipster Mecca and eating in a restaurant that doesn't have a sign outside. Always a sure fire give away that the place is ""cool"". Anyways, the service was extremely friendly and accommodating which is why they are getting 4 stars instead of three. I had called ahead to ask if they had candles bc it was my sisters birthday and I wanted to sing and all that jazz. I literally can't even accurately tell you exactly what I had bc they don't have menus. The server wrote the categories (chicken, pork chop, salad, etc.) on the table cover and explained everything verbally but the place was pretty loud so we could only hear every other word. Cool restaurants don't need signs or menus! All of us ordered the burger bc it seemed like the daftest bet and they only thing we actually were given prices for were the steaks and they were completely outrageous. $35 for a six ounce sirloin. I'm a certified fat kid and six ounces of sirloin is like two bites. The bone in ribeye was $90 bucks and a pound and a half. Which is just ridiculous. I work in the food industry and I have no idea how they justify that price. We started with a salad that was mixed lettuces, apples, parmesan and some sort of vinaigrette. It was delicious and the flavored blended perfectly. The burger was mediocre at best. The fries were way too salty.We had the flourless chocolate cake for dessert and it was the highlight of the meal. TLDR: overpriced hipster establishment with awful food and great service.",1.0
"This is definitely a quintessential Brooklyn joint, complete with a visit from Anthony Bourdain on the early episodes of his famous TV show. I heard about this place years ago and was taken here by chance by friends after a long day dealing with extra traffic on our way to the BK.  The place was dark and hip but with attentive service and a bustling vibe.  We started with a few beers and quickly ordered a burger and the fish special.  For a no-frills bar, the food sure did deliver.  The burger was more gastropub quality than diner brand.  The fish, cooked perfectly, belonged in a BYOB restaurant that you need reservations weeks in advance for.  All in all, impressive and perfectly quaint.  A great stop at close to midnight on a Saturday night; the kitchen wasn't on auto at that point and churned out some good food.  This is most likely one of those places that I won't return to anytime soon for no good reason.  I'm glad I was surprised by our visit here and hopefully chance will partake in our restaurant adventures here once again.",4.0
"Diner wears a charming and retro aesthetic, housed in a tiny dining space reminiscent of old train cars and vintage diners.  But there's nothing retro about the food; despite the name, no standard diner fare awaits here.On a quiet Broadway corner, outdoor seats cluster around the non-descript restaurant, offering views of Williamsburg Bridge.  Inside, there's a mix of leather or wood booth seating along one window-lined wall, seats at a bar, and a few more booths in a nook off to the side.  Diner is known for extensive lines, a product of popularity, very limited capacity, and a no reservation policy.  Arriving early for lunch on a rainy Monday was a nice way to enjoy the place; the absence of people lent a lovely, small-town feel to the place.The easy-going and friendly staff got us settled in right away.  In a gesture that could be gimmicky but instead delighted us, our waiter narrated the menu, writing one word to describe each dish right onto the white paper lining our table.  Of course, an orally communicated menu could only work with a small menu; for lunch, theirs was only 7 items deep.  That short list of appetizers and entrees was diverse, but Diner isn't the place for overly picky or limited palates.  The menu that day?  Summed up in their one word shorthand: peach, string bean, frittata, succotash, whitefish, brisket sw*, and burgers.The food sparkled with fresh ingredients and skillful prep.  The chilled peach soup was refreshing yet rich, dotted with crushed almonds and olive oil.  Brightly flavored string bean salad well-balanced with spicy arugula and warm feta cheese.  The delicious succotash was an excellent meld of sweet corn, earthy mushrooms, and smoked fish.  Crusty, gently charred fresh bread smeared with good white fish salad finished off the entrees.  Our server asked if we wanted dessert, and we asked for a menu without thinking.  One dessert was all they offered, and surely no other was needed if its a fresh white peach and berry crisp, hot and perfectly balanced between sweet and tart.The beverage list is quite extensive and not committed to anyone's memory; there's a menu for that.  Besides the long wine list, there are cocktails from the bar and respectable beer choices.Diner is a wonderful place to dine.  Its ambience and style suggests precious, yet it isn't.  The compact and ever-changing menu will be an attraction for those open-minded and curious, and the quality of the food rewarding.  See me here again for dinner and other meals.*sw = sandwich",4.0

"I like the vibe here. Friendly service so far.I like a lot about this place. Service was very slow but friendly. To quantify it: the table next to me waited 1/2 hour to get their check and I waited 40 minutes between my salad and my entree. The food was delicious and so was the wine. The salad was a nice size but for some reason I was still really hungry after my entree. I ended up ordering another appetizer. In the end, I'm not sure why but after a salad, an appetizer and an entree I left not full at all. Total with tip was $86.86. I will definitely come again but I will eat a little first :).",4.0
"You know why hipsters are so skinny? It's cause they eat Diner sized portions. OK,OK I kid, I couldn't help it. Came here cause my friend lives in the neighborhood and the reviews here seem to be great. Even though it was less than a hour after opening, outside seating area was already full (which was a shame cause it was a beautiful day), as was most of the inside. We had to settle for eating at the bar area, which was not a bad thing.The menu is literally a long strip of paper with crudely handwritten menu for the day. Unique, I guess. Our waiter/bartender took our order of poached eggs and a spinach/chicken (or tuna, couldn't remember to be honest) salad and two orange juices (should have gotten the bloody mary's, they looked awesome). Food took almost 20 minutes to arrive, which would have been acceptable given the busy atmosphere, but that attitude took a complete 180 when saw it. The first thing that popped into both our minds was, 'Is this it?'. My friend and I had a feeling this would be the case as we were waiting for our food and glancing at what other people had ordered. We saw the person next to us eating pancakes, which looked amazing and would have made a great side dish. But as small a portion as it was, it was considered a $13 dish. No thanks. Here's the thing, the food was pretty good. Well the spinach salad was OK, not bad. My poached eggs over toast was actually pretty tasty. Both had a mishmash of fancy sounding ingredients which I guess added to it's overall pleasant taste. But everything is completely overpriced for the portion size. Either make it a couple of bucks cheaper (and have an appetizer section) or double the portions (or add more sides to the dish). Our total with tax and tip was $50. That's two dishes and two drinks. Completely and utterly over over priced. The orange juice alone was $10 (one small $4, one large $6). Granted it was very fresh (not store bought, for the price is better not have been). Look, things will not change. This place has a long list of regular customers and people who swear by it. Which is completely fine as it is a very unique establishment in a very young and hip neighborhood.As we both were not fully satiated by the meal, we headed over to Fette Sau and downed some ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS barbecue.",2.0
First time going to the diner and it was interesting. I came here for brunch. You really have to pay attention to the server or you might not be really eating. They do have a small menu listing about 4 dishes. But there's plenty off menu. I'm assuming they change it up? Although the experience was different I didn't find too much excitement in the food. I had the poached eggs and while it did taste better than others I've tried it also lean towards the salty side too.,3.0
"I want to cry writing this review, because alas, this was my favorite go-to restaurant when I lived in Brooklyn, and I miss it so, so much.I don't know what it is about this place. Despite the sometimes unfriendly Hipster waitstaff, and the almost unbearable Hipster clientele that make up 95% of the Diner scene, I simply could not get enough of this place. At 6'3"", 240 pounds, I'd manage to bend my body in half and squeeze my giant frame through the tiny door of this original, barely-refurbished 1927 diner, week after week, just for the privilege of eating their amazing food.(How's that for an intro to a 5-star restaurant?)Vapid Hipsters aside, I know EXACTLY what it is about this place:The food. There's no real menu at Diner, save for the burger and steaks which are always available. You learn the menu at Diner when your server sits down with you and writes it out on the parchment-like paper that serves as a tablecloth. The menu can change almost daily, though the theme of ingredients used will typically last through a month or so. Pay attention -- for the whole writing-on-the-table thing is a useless gimmick. For example, as the server describes to you the most amazing salad with 20 ingredients grown fresh from their local farm, all they write on the table is ""SALAD."" Not too helpful when you need to recall the 11 or 12 extremely verbose items they just finished reading to you. The food at Diner is simply amazing. When I moved to Brooklyn, I ate, like 4 or 5 different things, and generally refused to try anything new. I never believed I would try so many new foods until I came to Diner. Diner was my breakthrough. Every single thing I ever got talked into trying here (hello, rabbit?) I ended up not just liking, but LOVING. Diner's food is so fresh and so well prepared that I will pretty much try anything they serve up here.But when it's all said and done, what's the most standout, special thing Diner serves? The burger. Raised from cows on their own farm, and ground to order, Diner makes a burger that must have crack in it, because its amazingness defies reality. I have never, ever had a burger this good. No matter how you order it, it will come out rare-to-barely medium rare. Meaning, it will still be twitching and bleeding when it arrives on your plate. And that's the crack, I think. I used to eat burgers medium-to-medium well, but Diner converted me and showed me what I was missing out on. Perhaps I'm a vampire, I dunno. But you haven't lived until you've eaten a burger from Diner. The fries are amazing too. As is the homemade mayo. DO NOT PUT KETSCHUP ON YOUR BURGER OR FRIES HERE. It's mayo or nothing.Oh, how I miss you Diner. You're like that ex-girlfriend I wish I could bang again.",5.0
"Very average brunch experience. And about 25% more expensive than it should be.  $15 for grits with 3 shrimp.  $9 for 4 deep-fried golfball sized doughnuts. Cold chick pea salad (cold like a fridge, not room temperature) with a cold poached egg. Silly system of the waitress reciting the specials (can they not print up a daily menu?) and then scribbling one word descriptions (eg. ""poached"") on the paper table setting. No price mentioned. Very average bloody mary.Really cool, pro, gracious hostess named Alexandra. Otherwise all good service and team work.Nothing bad about this place. I just excepted more. Too many other awesome brunches in Bk to bother coming back here.",3.0
This place has a small menu of simple but delicious dishes and a charming old-school diner atmosphere -- grab a booth with a view of the JMZ trains rattling by overhead or take a stool at the counter for the full diner experience. It's not cheap; our bill for two came to $66. Highly recommended for lunch/brunch.,4.0
"First of all let me say that my tolerance for Williamsburg and its denizens is extremely low. My sister lives there though and she picked this place and so I that's how I ended up taking the L to hipster Mecca and eating in a restaurant that doesn't have a sign outside. Always a sure fire give away that the place is ""cool"". Anyways, the service was extremely friendly and accommodating which is why they are getting 4 stars instead of three. I had called ahead to ask if they had candles bc it was my sisters birthday and I wanted to sing and all that jazz. I literally can't even accurately tell you exactly what I had bc they don't have menus. The server wrote the categories (chicken, pork chop, salad, etc.) on the table cover and explained everything verbally but the place was pretty loud so we could only hear every other word. Cool restaurants don't need signs or menus! All of us ordered the burger bc it seemed like the daftest bet and they only thing we actually were given prices for were the steaks and they were completely outrageous. $35 for a six ounce sirloin. I'm a certified fat kid and six ounces of sirloin is like two bites. The bone in ribeye was $90 bucks and a pound and a half. Which is just ridiculous. I work in the food industry and I have no idea how they justify that price. We started with a salad that was mixed lettuces, apples, parmesan and some sort of vinaigrette. It was delicious and the flavored blended perfectly. The burger was mediocre at best. The fries were way too salty.We had the flourless chocolate cake for dessert and it was the highlight of the meal. TLDR: overpriced hipster establishment with awful food and great service.",1.0
"This is definitely a quintessential Brooklyn joint, complete with a visit from Anthony Bourdain on the early episodes of his famous TV show. I heard about this place years ago and was taken here by chance by friends after a long day dealing with extra traffic on our way to the BK.  The place was dark and hip but with attentive service and a bustling vibe.  We started with a few beers and quickly ordered a burger and the fish special.  For a no-frills bar, the food sure did deliver.  The burger was more gastropub quality than diner brand.  The fish, cooked perfectly, belonged in a BYOB restaurant that you need reservations weeks in advance for.  All in all, impressive and perfectly quaint.  A great stop at close to midnight on a Saturday night; the kitchen wasn't on auto at that point and churned out some good food.  This is most likely one of those places that I won't return to anytime soon for no good reason.  I'm glad I was surprised by our visit here and hopefully chance will partake in our restaurant adventures here once again.",4.0
"Diner wears a charming and retro aesthetic, housed in a tiny dining space reminiscent of old train cars and vintage diners.  But there's nothing retro about the food; despite the name, no standard diner fare awaits here.On a quiet Broadway corner, outdoor seats cluster around the non-descript restaurant, offering views of Williamsburg Bridge.  Inside, there's a mix of leather or wood booth seating along one window-lined wall, seats at a bar, and a few more booths in a nook off to the side.  Diner is known for extensive lines, a product of popularity, very limited capacity, and a no reservation policy.  Arriving early for lunch on a rainy Monday was a nice way to enjoy the place; the absence of people lent a lovely, small-town feel to the place.The easy-going and friendly staff got us settled in right away.  In a gesture that could be gimmicky but instead delighted us, our waiter narrated the menu, writing one word to describe each dish right onto the white paper lining our table.  Of course, an orally communicated menu could only work with a small menu; for lunch, theirs was only 7 items deep.  That short list of appetizers and entrees was diverse, but Diner isn't the place for overly picky or limited palates.  The menu that day?  Summed up in their one word shorthand: peach, string bean, frittata, succotash, whitefish, brisket sw*, and burgers.The food sparkled with fresh ingredients and skillful prep.  The chilled peach soup was refreshing yet rich, dotted with crushed almonds and olive oil.  Brightly flavored string bean salad well-balanced with spicy arugula and warm feta cheese.  The delicious succotash was an excellent meld of sweet corn, earthy mushrooms, and smoked fish.  Crusty, gently charred fresh bread smeared with good white fish salad finished off the entrees.  Our server asked if we wanted dessert, and we asked for a menu without thinking.  One dessert was all they offered, and surely no other was needed if its a fresh white peach and berry crisp, hot and perfectly balanced between sweet and tart.The beverage list is quite extensive and not committed to anyone's memory; there's a menu for that.  Besides the long wine list, there are cocktails from the bar and respectable beer choices.Diner is a wonderful place to dine.  Its ambience and style suggests precious, yet it isn't.  The compact and ever-changing menu will be an attraction for those open-minded and curious, and the quality of the food rewarding.  See me here again for dinner and other meals.*sw = sandwich",4.0

"I like the vibe here. Friendly service so far.I like a lot about this place. Service was very slow but friendly. To quantify it: the table next to me waited 1/2 hour to get their check and I waited 40 minutes between my salad and my entree. The food was delicious and so was the wine. The salad was a nice size but for some reason I was still really hungry after my entree. I ended up ordering another appetizer. In the end, I'm not sure why but after a salad, an appetizer and an entree I left not full at all. Total with tip was $86.86. I will definitely come again but I will eat a little first :).",4.0
"You know why hipsters are so skinny? It's cause they eat Diner sized portions. OK,OK I kid, I couldn't help it. Came here cause my friend lives in the neighborhood and the reviews here seem to be great. Even though it was less than a hour after opening, outside seating area was already full (which was a shame cause it was a beautiful day), as was most of the inside. We had to settle for eating at the bar area, which was not a bad thing.The menu is literally a long strip of paper with crudely handwritten menu for the day. Unique, I guess. Our waiter/bartender took our order of poached eggs and a spinach/chicken (or tuna, couldn't remember to be honest) salad and two orange juices (should have gotten the bloody mary's, they looked awesome).

"The first time we ate at Diner, a light lunch for two it all went pretty okay. Love the old interior diner space and they have a nice terrace. More recently (Tuesday Oct 14, 2014) a small group of six went in for a dinner with a rather different experience...Starting with the embarrassing, (mostly for us but I'm sure to some degree for the others in the party, as they were obliged to hang around by the front door waiting for us), 'no sit you down until ALL the guests have arrived!' policy, though it was late and empty, a US system we visitors will never fathom as long as we live here. I understand the concept but there should be some common sense discretion on the part of the host. Ahhh, Speaking of the host... Once us two latecomers had arrived, the seating process was unnecessarily and painfully slow, while we firstly, went unnoticed until speaking up, that Hello, ALL the party had arrived, the hostess seemingly more interested in an all night long discussion with a someone at the bar, coupled with her unnecessary priorities like slowwwwwly strutting to the opposite end of the space and baaaaaack to get us a bottle of water though we weren't in any position to drink it until we were actually sat down and were given glasses our table waiting and waiting right next to us?? I think I can speak for all of us saying we felt quite secondary to the hostesses, air of superiority priorities from the get go. Wouldn't be the first time, but it is always a rotten start to an evening.To the contrary, our wait staff were super friendly, fun and knowledgeable though we were a little confused and annoyed as to why it took a good 15 minutes to inform us our wine order was out of stock? We finally had our first sip of wine some 25 minutes after arriving. Luckily we had some water, I suppose.  While the courses written on the paper table cloth is sorta quaint and okay for a four course lunch menu, it really doesn't work for a 9 course dinner, especially if some of the guests aren't native English speakers. It's a lot to remember, especially when you include all the side veg, sauces and garnishes. A couple of us have worked in some of the worlds best restaurants and have been obliged to remember similar but not when we're customers pleeeease. At least one small blackboard passed around on request would save the wait staff much repetition and the customers good food ordering time. Another embarrassing aspect, which comes off as a little snooty, is not having any prices marked. Either you act like money is of no consequence and possibly spend oodles more than you would have liked, or you have to look cheap and ask the prices of everything you may be considering. Either way, it doesn't work. Limit the embarrassment Diner and please ask the staff to write the prices down as well if you must continue with this system.Wanting to experience some variety, we shared 3 starters and 4 mains. As per what was written on our table top; soup, risotto, salad, fish, beef, burger and something else I forget. See? If it had all been written down I may have even remembered some of the tasty garnishes... All the food was pretty good, nothing to write home about, but well prepared and tasty enough, the soup and the grilled fish being the best and actually very good. The interesting wine list is comprehensive for a small restaurant, the diner being associated with the Marlow and Sons group, so we drank well. In the end we found the $60 per person + tip bill a little more than expected, but hey we didn't actually know the prices of anything, so in truth didn't really know what to expect in this respect. I don't think I'm wrong in saying that most diners hate surprises on the check?So I can recommend Diner for a couple or foursome looking for a simple uncomplicated lunch but as far as the evening goes, if it didn't gel on a quiet night, I would would hate to see the service on a busy night when most of the staff must be repeating the menu over and over to a handful diners while the others, just wait...",3.0

"It has been years since I have been to NY (Uh, I really need to do something about that!), but I remember my breakfast at Diner so vividly. My sister lived just a few blocks away and told me about breakfast to live for (don't die for food, that is just silly and wasteful). I asked her to tell me about the menu... she told me to forget about the menu and that we will have to see what the specials are. Uh, okay. Suddenly, breakfast turned into a spontaneous adventure. It was a crisp cold day and that made the wait for a table seem much longer than it most likely was in reality. After what seemed to be an eon, our server sat us down. He was a short dude with stunning blue eyes (irrelevant, but I had not seen eyes that color ever in my life and not since). He told us about the specials and sure enough that is what we ordered... apple pancakes and the cheddar grits with sausage. We waited a while for our food. Blue eyes came to our table several times to chat and make sure we had beverages. Then the food. The pancakes were simply amazing, however, not nearly as amazing as the cheddar grits... oh little baby Jesus! So amazing! Grits of a lifetime. I feel Jill Scott was singing about these grits in her song ""The Way""When I return to NY (oh, and I will), you will find me at Diner. Perhaps I should write them ahead of my arrival to make sure that they will be serving the cheddar grits. Yes and please.",4.0
"My girlfriend and I wandered into Diner thinking it was Marlow and Sons, woops! (I think they are affiliated anyways.) My review is probably atypical as we ate a vegetarian dinner and this place looks like they focus mainly on their meat mains.We were seated immediately at the bar (we have no issues eating at the bar, especially on a busy Friday night). Our server was attentive and made us some pretty tasty cocktails!The menu changes day-to-day and on that Friday, the only vegetarian selections were four different small plates; we ordered one of each and shared everything family style. Our bib lettuce salad was well dressed, though a tad boring (a few pears were hidden in there but it was mostly a huge plate of lettuce); our beet dish was decent but average.The highlight was definitely the grilled eggplant and the side of grilled sourdough bread we received with it. The consistency of the eggplant was like that of garlic that has been baking and breaking down for a long time. I've had a lot of soggy, gooey eggplant but this vegetable is so good when prepared properly.If the rest of our meal was up to the caliber as the eggplant I'd bump it to four stars. Nice atmosphere and the meat dishes looked tasty but the vegetarian options just weren't too exciting!",3.0
"We went to Diner for brunch in the midst of a snowy Sunday storm and were pleasantly surprised to get a booth for 6 during peak hour.The interior is super cosy with low ceilings and a long bar to sit and dine at too.The food menu is spoken word so make sure you pay attention when the waiter is disclosing the details of each delicacy. There weren't too many options for vegetarians but a handsome spread available to carnivores. The food was delicious, fresh and satisfying. Prices are a bit above average but you can tell you're paying for quality produce.The service was good but served with a side of pretentious undertones - nothing unexpected in this neck of Brooklyn.Recommended to tourists on the prowl for authentic BK experiences.",4.0
"Every time I walk passed the diner, it is jam packed inside and out, so I decided to try it. When I walked in on a Sunday at noon it was mobbed. I asked the girl behind the main counter if I could place a to go order. She said she had to check with the kitchen to see if that was allowed. When she came back with a yes, I ordered a side of French fries and a side salad. Without looking at the bill, I gave her my credit card and later on realized I was charged $19.00 for a side order of soggy oily French fries and a ""side"" salad that consisted of lettuce with olive oil. NO cucumber, tomato, onion...NOTHING. This place is over priced and not worth the money. I paid more than ANY PLACE in Manhattan. SMH. I would never go back nor would I recommend them to ANYONE. Save your money. Tons of reasonable places in the area with better tasting food.",2.0
"wandered in on a Sunday morning thinking this was going to be a divey diner, and was (pleasantly) surprised to learn that this was a much more upscale brunch menu. delicious drinks, friendly waitstaff, and only a ~10 minute wait for outside seating on the first nice day of spring. love it!",5.0
"Hipsters aside, it's the best brunch in Brooklyn. There are so many reasons to get mad at this place, between the excessive wait times and general air of over-coolness. But the food saves all. And as soon as you venture into your toffee-glazed french toast or any one of the many farm-fresh, perfectly composed egg dishes, you'll feel like you're a part of something special.",4.0
"The first time we ate at Diner, a light lunch for two it all went pretty okay. Love the old interior diner space and they have a nice terrace. More recently (Tuesday Oct 14, 2014) a small group of six went in for a dinner with a rather different experience...Starting with the embarrassing, (mostly for us but I'm sure to some degree for the others in the party, as they were obliged to hang around by the front door waiting for us), 'no sit you down until ALL the guests have arrived!' policy, though it was late and empty, a US system we visitors will never fathom as long as we live here. I understand the concept but there should be some common sense discretion on the part of the host. Ahhh, Speaking of the host... Once us two latecomers had arrived, the seating process was unnecessarily and painfully slow, while we firstly, went unnoticed until speaking up, that Hello, ALL the party had arrived, the hostess seemingly more interested in an all night long discussion with a someone at the bar, coupled with her unnecessary priorities like slowwwwwly strutting to the opposite end of the space and baaaaaack to get us a bottle of water though we weren't in any position to drink it until we were actually sat down and were given glasses our table waiting and waiting right next to us?? I think I can speak for all of us saying we felt quite secondary to the hostesses, air of superiority priorities from the get go. Wouldn't be the first time, but it is always a rotten start to an evening.To the contrary, our wait staff were super friendly, fun and knowledgeable though we were a little confused and annoyed as to why it took a good 15 minutes to inform us our wine order was out of stock? We finally had our first sip of wine some 25 minutes after arriving. Luckily we had some water, I suppose.  While the courses written on the paper table cloth is sorta quaint and okay for a four course lunch menu, it really doesn't work for a 9 course dinner, especially if some of the guests aren't native English speakers. It's a lot to remember, especially when you include all the side veg, sauces and garnishes. A couple of us have worked in some of the worlds best restaurants and have been obliged to remember similar but not when we're customers pleeeease. At least one small blackboard passed around on request would save the wait staff much repetition and the customers good food ordering time. Another embarrassing aspect, which comes off as a little snooty, is not having any prices marked. Either you act like money is of no consequence and possibly spend oodles more than you would have liked, or you have to look cheap and ask the prices of everything you may be considering. Either way, it doesn't work. Limit the embarrassment Diner and please ask the staff to write the prices down as well if you must continue with this system.Wanting to experience some variety, we shared 3 starters and 4 mains. As per what was written on our table top; soup, risotto, salad, fish, beef, burger and something else I forget. See? If it had all been written down I may have even remembered some of the tasty garnishes... All the food was pretty good, nothing to write home about, but well prepared and tasty enough, the soup and the grilled fish being the best and actually very good. The interesting wine list is comprehensive for a small restaurant, the diner being associated with the Marlow and Sons group, so we drank well. In the end we found the $60 per person + tip bill a little more than expected, but hey we didn't actually know the prices of anything, so in truth didn't really know what to expect in this respect. I don't think I'm wrong in saying that most diners hate surprises on the check?So I can recommend Diner for a couple or foursome looking for a simple uncomplicated lunch but as far as the evening goes, if it didn't gel on a quiet night, I would would hate to see the service on a busy night when most of the staff must be repeating the menu over and over to a handful diners while the others, just wait...",3.0
"Been there twice, and so far it didn't disappoint. I like the fact that the most noticeable thing to me so far was their handmade ketchup. Natural condiments is always a plus in my book.

"It has been years since I have been to NY (Uh, I really need to do something about that!), but I remember my breakfast at Diner so vividly. My sister lived just a few blocks away and told me about breakfast to live for (don't die for food, that is just silly and wasteful). I asked her to tell me about the menu... she told me to forget about the menu and that we will have to see what the specials are. Uh, okay. Suddenly, breakfast turned into a spontaneous adventure. It was a crisp cold day and that made the wait for a table seem much longer than it most likely was in reality. After what seemed to be an eon, our server sat us down. He was a short dude with stunning blue eyes (irrelevant, but I had not seen eyes that color ever in my life and not since). He told us about the specials and sure enough that is what we ordered... apple pancakes and the cheddar grits with sausage. We waited a while for our food. Blue eyes came to our table several times to chat and make sure we had beverages. Then the food. The pancakes were simply amazing, however, not nearly as amazing as the cheddar grits... oh little baby Jesus! So amazing! Grits of a lifetime. I feel Jill Scott was singing about these grits in her song ""The Way""When I return to NY (oh, and I will), you will find me at Diner. Perhaps I should write them ahead of my arrival to make sure that they will be serving the cheddar grits. Yes and please.",4.0

"Fantastic food- albeit service not the best, and portions being quite small.   Diner (right next to Marlow and Sons) is a well known place in the 'burg. So you can expect waits. I came here on a Sunday at noon (prime time) with 2 others and it was way more crowded (and loud) inside than out (inside decor looked.. old, quaint, spacious enough).  Al fresco dining included a few tables and benches lined up around the restaurant.  For some reason, the waitress knew we were here (granted we had to wait for 1 person) but kept giving the open tables to others that came in after us, or didn't demonstrate a sense of urgency to those that were leaving that people were waiting... Not a big deal but we waited say 20 minutes for our table. We sat outside.   Once the meal began, I didn't have much complaints. They were a bit slow with refilling waters (they give you a- ahem- room temp bottle to pour yourself) but otherwise, the menu was explained well and our waitress was sweet in making sure we got everything we needed. The food came out really slow, but I'd like to think this is because it's incredibly fresh. So.. as you may have noted, they don't have a formal, descriptive menu here- because the menu changes daily, the waiters have to explain everything- writing sparse notes on your paper table cloth.   According to one of the girls I ate with, they always offer their fresh fresh burger (which she recommends is so fresh and yummy- as it's butchered in-house- it looked very big!) There a lot of eggs here. Poached eggs (this is what I got... two perfectly poached eggs ((they were perfectly shaped!) atop an eggplant puree (barely there..eh), haricot vert, grilled peaches (the best part) and a  small buttered small baguette), frittatas, ""sunny"" eggs atop succotash (this is what the two others I was with got- it was a fruitful plate of a nicely done runny egg atop ham, corn, and summer veggies). We also shared a side of fries.  While I felt my egg plate was quite small (I mean, yes it was 2 full eggs done perfectly- the veggies were a bit light.. maybe I just have a piggy appetite), the fries were pretty big (well then again, we were 3).  They  were also damn good!  Very crispy, but not oily, very short, chubby and well salted.  Served with a bit of mayo, Belgian style. Definitely come for the fresh food and the fries.  I'd like to come back for dinner (where it is totally menu-less), where it's apparently better.  If you're a sweet brunch person, then you can choose between the special pancakes (ours was apricot with mascarpone).",4.0

Either way I would gather most people already know this place isn't exactly Denny's, and I was admittedly pretty excited to try it out given what I'd heard about their kitchen.Well, my results were a mixed bag, I'm sad to say. I was a little underwhelmed by the preparation of the food here, and the tiny portion of duck I received left me wanting to stop for a snack on the way home.

The waiter's shorts were so short I thought he might get pubes in my food and the food was mediocre at best. I ordered the heirloom tomato salad and porgy(?) fish. The tomato salad was ok but the addition of olives was odd. I was told they were out of porgy after about 20 mins, they didn't know they ran out?

"What a great little restaurant tucked near the Williamsburg Bridge. From the outside, it's slightly unappealing with its boxy exterior, but with its old interior, it really has a charming feeling to it.Sitting down with a friend, they only gave us a beer and wine list. I went with the Bartender's choice of bottled Troegs. The waitress shortly came and explained the menu to us while writing it down on our paper table cloth. This helps gives the place a more intimate feeling, along with the tight setting, though it might be hard remembering what the dishes come with and you won't know much each dish is. The online menu does give you an idea though.I went with the $15 grass-fed cheese burger, which turned out to probably be the best burger I've had in NYC. It came with a thick broiche bun and the burger was real big and substantial. Flavorful meat and importantly, they properly salted the burger. The other highlights were the pickled onions and the homemade ketchup. The fries were decent, but I kept having them in order to eat more of the ketchup. It appears more like a tomato sauce and has a strong tomato flavor instead the factory version's simple sour and sweet without any tomato-ey depth.My friend had a $19 duck leg with peas.

The servers are super-nice -- and I love that when I brought a friend with allergies with me, they really checked to make sure nothing relevant even touched her food -- and knowledgeable about the menu, without making me feel dumb for the occasional, ""I have never heard of that thing you mentioned -- what is that?"" type question. The burger is a superb stand-by -- one of my favorites in the city, and one of the only items that's always on the ever-changing menu -- and all the food is awesome. Fresh ingredients, really well made, and creative without losing its simple good taste. Love, love, love.",5.0
"Absolutely the best!  Amazing atmosphere, highly recommend for a date or ANY occasion.  The service is always adorable and amazing.  Make sure that you share whatever soup they have that day- it will blow your stupid soup mind.  But trust that everything they do is amazing and you will be surprised by every dish.",5.0
"Whatever you want to say about this place, my significant other and I payed $172.00 for a steak, tomato salad, two glasses of wine, and some weird basil desert. The steak was extremely chewy and difficult to eat and the wine was boring. Might as well have gone to Peter Luger. The tomato salad was good though, and they probably do other things better, but I shouldn't be hungry after paying that much.",2.0
"I used to love coming to this place about 7 years ago and it used to be great. I noticed the decline in quality of good and service so decided to take a long break. A few nights ago I thought I would give it another shot in case things have improved. I remember why I quit going and will not be coming back. The waiter's shorts were so short I thought he might get pubes in my food and the food was mediocre at best. I ordered the heirloom tomato salad and porgy(?) fish. The tomato salad was ok but the addition of olives was odd. I was told they were out of porgy after about 20 mins, they didn't know they ran out? They have me a choice of whole trout or another white fish instead. The trout was grilled whole and salty. I ate half of it because I was hungry but nothing special about this place or the food. I will not be returning, Diner's time has passed.",2.0
"When I'm walking in the door I just hear Bob Seger singing ""Still The Same"" - this is one of the first good dining experiences I had when I arrived in New York 10 years ago.  They have an equally adept hand at proteins and veg, service is laid back but not brookyn-service-laid-back.  Prices still seem more reasonable compared with the rest of the empire Diner spawned.  It's still great.  Also the backless diner stools at the counter still leave me aching the rest of the night.  Actually, probably worse now because I am 10 years older.",5.0
"What a great little restaurant tucked near the Williamsburg Bridge. From the outside, it's slightly unappealing with its boxy exterior, but with its old interior, it really has a charming feeling to it.Sitting down with a friend, they only gave us a beer and wine list. I went with the Bartender's choice of bottled Troegs. The waitress shortly came and explained the menu to us while writing it down on our paper table cloth. This helps gives the place a more intimate feeling, along with the tight setting, though it might be hard remembering what the dishes come with and you won't know much each dish is. The online menu does give you an idea though.I went with the $15 grass-fed cheese burger, which turned out to probably be the best burger I've had in NYC. It came with a thick broiche bun and the burger was real big and substantial. Flavorful meat and importantly, they properly salted the burger. The other highlights were the pickled onions and the homemade ketchup. The fries were decent, but I kept having them in order to eat more of the ketchup. It appears more like a tomato sauce and has a strong tomato flavor instead the factory version's simple sour and sweet without any tomato-ey depth.My friend had a $19 duck leg with peas. He loved it.Diner is reasonably priced, has incredible food, and it's just an experience going there.",5.0

"I don't know why I didn't review Diner four months ago when I was actually here.I spent about a week in New York just eating my way through the city and Brooklyn. I've come to NYC for conferences and business a couple times, but never got to explore the great eating culture here, so I made it my goal to come to a few notable spots -- Diner was one of them.I'll be honest: I heard about Diner through Anthony Bourdain: No Reservation (and I'm proud of it).The ambiance:Loud. Hipster. Explicit. It's actually a wonderful place if you can tolerate the brash atmosphere developed by both the personnel and the patrons. If Williamsburg isn't your cup of tea, you'll hate Diner -- it's as easy as that. I quite enjoyed it.The food:I started with some local IPA from New York. It was okay (I was longing for my San Diego-based Stone IPA at that point). I ordered a crispy kale salad with smoked bacon and pine nuts. It was a decent starter, but I felt like I could get this at other places. I followed that up with a roasted bone marrow croque, which was actually a very very nice dish. The richness of the bone barrow was complimented nicely with the overly crunchy piece of toast. If I came again, I'd probably order the burger as everyone around me was eating one, and they all looked damn delicious.The service:What service? I had to keep yelling to get a second beer. My order wasn't taken until 3-4 minutes after I started trying to call a waiter/bartender.If you like good food in a hipster gastropub setting, do come to Diner. Before dinner, consider going to Marlow & Sons a block away for wine and oysters, too. I did and it was a great way to pique my appetite.",4.0

I usually avoid chicken when dining out but this bird was top notch.A couple of things to note:Though Diner is the name of the joint, the setting and menu are both a definite step up. Prices definitely match the vibe, though. I was pretty disappointed with the small number of options in the wine by the glass category. Service was friendly and professional and while I dug the whole ""Let's write the menu out on the paper tablecloth"" thing, it would have been nice to have a  paper menu (with prices) to refer back to.Overall, I really enjoyed my meal at Diner and would return.

"This place is a bit over-hyped and as with many hip NYC spots, over-priced. We started with iced coffee, OJ and a scone. All A-OK. The scone, in fact, was the bomb, one of the best I've had. Then we ordered the large bloody mary and the cocktail with Pimms, lemon...I can't entirely remember. All good. This is basically where the good experience ends. I can see the menu protocol is much debated here. Personally, I'm not that into it simply because I can't ever read the waitresses handwriting. I also like to seriously peruse a menu before I order and that's just not possible here. It's a bit of a guessing game and since the waitresses here aren't really into customer servicing, you kind of just have to pick something and see what comes out. Granted though it's a novel set-up.For actual brunch we ordered the Poached Eggs with Corn Succotash and then the Duck Confit Hash with a sunny egg on top. When I order something written only on the menu/table as the ""Duck"" dish, I'm expecting to eat some duck. It comes out and we literally have to fish around the dish to find a few shreds of duck--about a spoonful in an already small-portioned dish. The rest of the hash had roasted potatoes, leeks and mushrooms with a sunny egg that was, in my opinion, overcooked (where I come from sunny eggs are still pretty runny, but maybe everyone has a different take on that?). Basically, we paid $14 for an overcooked sunny side egg and a few handfuls of roasted veggies with basically a garnish of duck confit.The Poached Eggs with Corn Succotash was similar. I will hand it to them, they were 2 perfectly poached eggs--kudos. The ""Succotash"" was basically a spoonful of corn and about 4 yellow cherry tomatoes, served with two slices of toast, one of which was entirely charred. The waitress did come by and say ""So sorry, do you want me to get you more toast?"" I declined because I was already a bit put-off and didn't want to interact with the staff or else show my disdain. But I've worked in restaurants for nearly 10 years. When you notice the cook messed-up, and the runner I suppose failed to notice the burnt toast, you don't offer to fix it, you just do it. That's what customer service is all about. And I mean...it's toast. She could have picked up a few more slices in the amount of time it took her to ask if I wanted more. Granted, I guess some people really like burnt toast. This dish was $11. Two poached eggs with basically a handful of corn and tomato and some burnt toast. The meal total was $65 plus another $10 for tip. I don't think we'll be coming back anytime soon...or ever. For the record though, my boyfriend had a great experience at one of Diner's sister restaurants Roman's. I've also heard great things about Marlow & Sons. This was my second time at Diner, the last time was over two years ago. I've given them two chances. With those price points, I wouldn't recommend it.",2.0
"Super cute, rusty ol' place.  Why is eating in rusty, worn-down places so fun/cool/desired?  I bumped into the door, and my friend lectured me on the fact that I have not had a tetanus booster since grade school.  Doctors... I'll show you a booster.  (I don't even know where I am going with that.)Had brunch here - minimal wait on a Sunday at 11 a.m.  The menu has a handful of non-descript breakfast items (omelette, pancakes, country breakfast, cheeseburger, etc.) which the waiter will then describe the menu flavor twists (i.e., type of omelet, type of pancake, etc.) in addition to writing down a few other off-menu specials on the paper tablecloth (of course there'd be paper tablecloths - the place is hip!).The doctor galpal had one of the specials with a housemade split sausage link, sunny side egg perched atop a lovely, warm summer vegetable succotash. I got the country breakfast, a well-rounded spread made up of fried okra (beautifully crisp and fresh), awesome, velvety scrambled eggs, an okay biscuit slathered with raspberry jam and basil butter and one rustic looking sausage patty.  I'd put these scrambled eggs in my top three favorite in the city.  It's bold, but I'm feelin' it!We also espied Rose Byrne nyukking it up in the corner with her WASPy friends.  That's cool.  The girl needsta eat!  And if anyone could put some meat on those fragile bones, it would be Diner.",4.0
"The diner has some good food hidden in an inconspicuous space. We were there for my brothers birthday so they had a pretty reasonable set menu.

"How many times can one say they've eaten in a station-wagon turned restaurant? One of the few things that make  Diner very unique The place really takes after its name.

"Had lunch here for the first time on a quiet summer Monday. Service was good. Started with a chilled corn soup which was excellent. For main dish ordered trout with succotash of vegetables. Trout was deliciously flavored and crispy. Veggies were super oily though had a nice roasted flavor. Also had chicken chilaquiles which was extremely underwhelming. Chicken was bland and had a chunk of cartilage. Green sauce was pretty bland too and the tortillas were completely soggy. Should have known better to save the Mexican food for a real Mexican restaurant. Lunch for 2 came out to $50 with only one app, a bit overpriced for a quite mediocre meal.

"I don't know why I didn't review Diner four months ago when I was actually here.I spent about a week in New York just eating my way through the city and Brooklyn. I've come to NYC for conferences and business a couple times, but never got to explore the great eating culture here, so I made it my goal to come to a few notable spots -- Diner was one of them.I'll be honest: I heard about Diner through Anthony Bourdain: No Reservation (and I'm proud of it).The ambiance:Loud. Hipster. Explicit. It's actually a wonderful place if you can tolerate the brash atmosphere developed by both the personnel and the patrons. If Williamsburg isn't your cup of tea, you'll hate Diner -- it's as easy as that. I quite enjoyed it.The food:I started with some local IPA from New York. It was okay (I was longing for my San Diego-based Stone IPA at that point). I ordered a crispy kale salad with smoked bacon and pine nuts. It was a decent starter, but I felt like I could get this at other places. I followed that up with a roasted bone marrow croque, which was actually a very very nice dish. The richness of the bone barrow was complimented nicely with the overly crunchy piece of toast. If I came again, I'd probably order the burger as everyone around me was eating one, and they all looked damn delicious.The service:What service? I had to keep yelling to get a second beer. My order wasn't taken until 3-4 minutes after I started trying to call a waiter/bartender.If you like good food in a hipster gastropub setting, do come to Diner. Before dinner, consider going to Marlow & Sons a block away for wine and oysters, too. I did and it was a great way to pique my appetite.",4.0
"""Get the burger! You must try the burger! Seriously, the Diner burger can't be beat!""Well, we had the burger at Diner and it was fine. Not bad but I've definitely had better. On the other hand, the pan roasted half chicken was sublime. I usually avoid chicken when dining out but this bird was top notch.A couple of things to note:Though Diner is the name of the joint, the setting and menu are both a definite step up. Prices definitely match the vibe, though. I was pretty disappointed with the small number of options in the wine by the glass category. Service was friendly and professional and while I dug the whole ""Let's write the menu out on the paper tablecloth"" thing, it would have been nice to have a  paper menu (with prices) to refer back to.Overall, I really enjoyed my meal at Diner and would return. Should you get the burger? Only if you order the chicken as well...",4.0

"Visited Diner on a trip to Brooklyn for a concert with three friends.  I arrived with one friend around 1:30PM on a saturday about a half hour before the others and went in to check out the wait time.  The first thing you notice is the lack of a sign.  There's no billboard advertising how amazing it is or even a sign on the building.  If it wasn't for Yelp and some word of mouth I would never have known about Diner.  Apparently the heavy metal doors from what appears to be the turn of the 20th century are also a time machine.  You are transported from modern day Brooklyn into the 30s.  The walls are still white enamel with wooden benches and tables.  It's literally like time has stopped.There was no wait but we were seated at the bar while we waited for our friends to arrive (the way it should work everywhere).  The bartender offered us a drink menu but we were driving to Philly immediatly following brunch so we passed although the Bloody Marys and Mimosas looked quite tasty.  We were given two glasses and an antique green glass bottle filled with room temperature water to sip on while we waited.  Finally our friends arrived and we were promptly seated.We were brought fresh glasses and a new bottle of water for the table.  I really appreciate this as I'm a huge water drinker and I feel like servers get annoyed constantly bringing me water.  The server came to the table and gave us a menu with a few standard items on it then proceeded to go over the specials, writing one word to describe each on the paper tablecloth.  There were too many to list/remember here but I will cover what each of us ordered.  I had the fried chicken sandwich with curry mayo and arrugula served with fresh cut potato chips.  Best chicken EVER!  It was so moist with a nice crunchy breading and just enough mayo to hold the sandwich together.  The foccicia bread was fresh and buttery.  The potato chips added a nice salty balance and were cut paper thin and were cooked perfectly, not too crunchy, not too flimsy.One friend had the pancake feature which was Johnny cakes (cornmeal pancakes) topped with smoked trout and served with fresh creme.  The portion size was small and a side of roasted potatoes would have been nice to add some substance.  The pancakes themselves were simply delicious and rich.  The smoked trout was flaky and had a rich smoke flavor without being fishy.  The creme wasn't really needed and provided too much contrast for my pallate but it was on the side anyway and easy to avoid.Another friend had the clam hash consisting of little neck clams served over a mix of hash brown potatoes, onions, fennel and topped with a raw egg yolk.  It was tasty but didn't quite offer the full breakfast/brunch feeling.The final member of our party had the omlette feature which was a three egg omelette filled with lobster and cream cheese.  This was super rich and had a good amout of lobster in it.  A side of toast would have been nice but it was still filling.The consensus on the food was that the chicken sandwich was the best option if you were hungry and looking for quantity while still keeping the quality high.  Everyone wished they had ordered it.If I'm in Brooklyn again I will definitely stop by Diner again.  I simply need to try the burger.  What an experience!",4.0
"It pains me to write this review, as Diner has been on my restaurant bucket list for a while and I have never heard anything less than superb about this place. We believe that we may have gone on an off night or maybe we didn't order the right items, but the disappointment was enlarged by the fact that I had decided to spend my poker earnings here, instead of on our go-to burger place in the neighorhood, Juniper.I ordered my burger medium rare, but it came out bloody as all hell. It was dangerously bloody, and I felt like I was eating raw fish that was covered in spices. All I could taste were the spices in raw fish-like consistency. The fries were equally bad...they didn't have any kind of crispiness and was just super salty.My friend took a couple bites of his burger and got it to go. I finished half of my dish and asked them to take it away. The waitress clearly knew that something was up, and asked us about it, but for some reason we decided not to complain about it...and I regret that now.Being a huge burger fan, I was very disappointed in Diner's burger. Not only because I had high expectations, but because it cost $13.50...and that ain't cheap. For a delicious burger in the hood, go to Juniper.

"Diner aka Broadway Diner is a great place to have a drink.  It is smooth and sexy the way you want it to be.  It'll rub you right, and speak in soft smooth tones.  Even purr in your ear.  All this despite the destination being Marlow & Sons, and somehow you end up here.  That is a very find Plan B.At this hour it is simply a bar.  And dinner + drinks, plus Miss Favela are long since a distant memory.  Yes indeed it's dark, and the Williamsburg bridge is looming silently overhead, like a giant monument to the city.  It's hazey to remember, but Hazey Davey seemed to be what I imbibed, that and an endless stream of lips.  That's all I can say that's all I must reveal.",4.0

"This is my second review of diner and it's partially a marlow & sons review as well. I always love the menu at both places and I have pretty much always loved the food I get, but after last Friday at marlow and ordering food to go at diner tonight, I just had to write another review. It's probably my 6th time for diner and I'm just so tired of the portion sizes for the price we pay. My friend and I tend to share everything when we go. Tonight when we asked over the phone what the pasta was, it was mentioned at the end that it was an appetizer or a small meal. We always get the pasta, but I think I've gotten to a point where I am OVER IT. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious , although the pepper almost made me friend gag because it was so hot. The portion size for $20 is just absurd and laughable. Portion sizes for them are getting to be outrageous. They've always been small but I'm getting to the point where I  can't justify it anymore. So delicious but so overpriced for the portions. It's not just the pasta, its everything.",3.0
"Watch the music video for ""Milkshake"" by Kelis before eating here. You'll thank me.But seriously. Incredible food. Wonderful service. Charming atmosphere.Diner was my birthday dinner with my best friend and it didn't disappoint. The whole evening was charmed, actually. We rode the East River Ferry over from 34th Street (highly recommended) and wandered through South W'burg to the restaurant. So quaint and so peaceful. App: fried eggplant with watermelon and some green stuff. Who knew watermelon went so well with salty fried things? Delicious!Entree (Me): Sirloin steak with some sort of crunchy green beans and (oddly) three big, buttery, delicious shrimp. The steak was heavenly perfection. Entree (Her): Bluefish on a bed of potatoes and some sort of sauce. I don't know. All mixed together on the fork and into my mouth, it was an explosion of amazing flavors. I'm not a huge fish fan, but this stuff was legit.Dessert: Strawberry shortcake. This was good, but not life-changing. I'd pick something else if I could have a do-over. But we still licked the plate clean.(We did not try the milkshake, so I don't know if it actually brings all the boys to the yard.)This is yet another top-notch dining spot in Brooklyn.

"A simple diner feel to the T!  There is some glam in the diner with the old-fashioned tables to the diner-style-metal doors to the slight slantedness feel inside the diner. We sat outside on a sunny Saturday morning having our brunch. Looking at their menu, it seemed like they have a simple menu. What I found out was that they do change around their menu and add many specials (4-5 additional dishes). Some of their main dishes ingredients change as well; for example, I got the rhubarb pancakes. My boyfriend got the country breakfast, where they served kale as a side dish.I have got to say this. I really enjoyed my boyfriend's country breakfast. The scrambled egg was a bit yolkly, light, and fluffy. The biscuit and gravy was good and extremely filling. The kale was incredible with a slight kick to it in the end that we could not identify but kept eating and eating. Everything on this plate was gone. My boyfriend really enjoyed my rhubarb pancakes. The pancakes themselves were moist, fluffy, and light. They were decent made pancakes - but there was no wow factor in it for me. I thought that the rhubarb though good, by itself, but with the pancake...it was overpowering.",3.0
"This review is based on a bar experience only. So, we came into Diner yesterday for an after-lunch cocktail. We actually thought this place was another restaurant, and it took awhile to figure out where we were. The place is small with a lunch-counter style bar and a handful of booths. The guys ordered beers ($8 draughts & $5 btls of Presidente) and I had a tasty Hibiscus Tequila concoction. We asked to see a menu, and they hand us a receipt paper with handwritten menu on it. This was awesome. I guess it changes daily, which is about as good as it gets. I switched to a white wine after, and it was something different that I wouldn't usually get. Will def. be back for dinner, this place was cute and I bet the food is tops.",4.0

It was dangerously bloody, and I felt like I was eating raw fish that was covered in spices. All I could taste were the spices in raw fish-like consistency. The fries were equally bad...they didn't have any kind of crispiness and was just super salty.My friend took a couple bites of his burger and got it to go. I finished half of my dish and asked them to take it away. The waitress clearly knew that something was up, and asked us about it, but for some reason we decided not to complain about it...and I regret that now.Being a huge burger fan, I was very disappointed in Diner's burger. Not only because I had high expectations, but because it cost $13.50...and that ain't cheap. For a delicious burger in the hood, go to Juniper. It was my fault for deciding to cheat on Juniper with Diner...karma's a bitch!",2.0
"Great menu. Never in my life would I have thought I'd be eating beef heart and tongue, and pay for it. I tried it for the first time here, and I liked it.The laid back atmosphere and the cool way they present their menu was nice as well.Their chicken dish was good, it was perfectly spiced and seasoned. But, this review is really about the beef heart and tongue. That was worth three stars by itself",4.0
"Diner aka Broadway Diner is a great place to have a drink.  It is smooth and sexy the way you want it to be.  It'll rub you right, and speak in soft smooth tones.  Even purr in your ear.  All this despite the destination being Marlow & Sons, and somehow you end up here.  That is a very find Plan B.At this hour it is simply a bar.  And dinner + drinks, plus Miss Favela are long since a distant memory.  Yes indeed it's dark, and the Williamsburg bridge is looming silently overhead, like a giant monument to the city.  It's hazey to remember, but Hazey Davey seemed to be what I imbibed, that and an endless stream of lips.  That's all I can say that's all I must reveal.",4.0
One of the most consistently high quality and delicious burgers around.  Also can't go wrong with the changing seasonal menu of locally grown produce based entrees.  Wait staff are friendly and ambience is nice.,4.0
"This is my second review of diner and it's partially a marlow & sons review as well. I always love the menu at both places and I have pretty much always loved the food I get, but after last Friday at marlow and ordering food to go at diner tonight, I just had to write another review. It's probably my 6th time for diner and I'm just so tired of the portion sizes for the price we pay. My friend and I tend to share everything when we go. Tonight when we asked over the phone what the pasta was, it was mentioned at the end that it was an appetizer or a small meal. We always get the pasta, but I think I've gotten to a point where I am OVER IT. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious , although the pepper almost made me friend gag because it was so hot. The portion size for $20 is just absurd and laughable. Portion sizes for them are getting to be outrageous. They've always been small but I'm getting to the point where I  can't justify it anymore. So delicious but so overpriced for the portions. It's not just the pasta, its everything.",3.0
"Watch the music video for ""Milkshake"" by Kelis before eating here. You'll thank me.But seriously. Incredible food. Wonderful service. Charming atmosphere.Diner was my birthday dinner with my best friend and it didn't disappoint. The whole evening was charmed, actually. We rode the East River Ferry over from 34th Street (highly recommended) and wandered through South W'burg to the restaurant. So quaint and so peaceful. App: fried eggplant with watermelon and some green stuff. Who knew watermelon went so well with salty fried things? Delicious!Entree (Me): Sirloin steak with some sort of crunchy green beans and (oddly) three big, buttery, delicious shrimp. The steak was heavenly perfection. Entree (Her): Bluefish on a bed of potatoes and some sort of sauce. I don't know. All mixed together on the fork and into my mouth, it was an explosion of amazing flavors. I'm not a huge fish fan, but this stuff was legit.Dessert: Strawberry shortcake. This was good, but not life-changing. I'd pick something else if I could have a do-over. But we still licked the plate clean.(We did not try the milkshake, so I don't know if it actually brings all the boys to the yard.)This is yet another top-notch dining spot in Brooklyn. Two thumbs way up.",5.0
"4 stars because the service was kind of confusing.. so many employees, not all the tables were full, yet me & my man were left to wait, a lot.. That being said, America.. F*** YEAH. This place is off the chain with its choices. How does one decide when everything sounds like the best thing you could possibly eat at that moment? And then scone of the day?! I mean honestly, it's like God kissed mah face and said, be merry my child, be merry.",4.0
"A simple diner feel to the T!  There is some glam in the diner with the old-fashioned tables to the diner-style-metal doors to the slight slantedness feel inside the diner. We sat outside on a sunny Saturday morning having our brunch. Looking at their menu, it seemed like they have a simple menu. What I found out was that they do change around their menu and add many specials (4-5 additional dishes). Some of their main dishes ingredients change as well; for example, I got the rhubarb pancakes. My boyfriend got the country breakfast, where they served kale as a side dish.I have got to say this. I really enjoyed my boyfriend's country breakfast. The scrambled egg was a bit yolkly, light, and fluffy. The biscuit and gravy was good and extremely filling. The kale was incredible with a slight kick to it in the end that we could not identify but kept eating and eating. Everything on this plate was gone. My boyfriend really enjoyed my rhubarb pancakes. The pancakes themselves were moist, fluffy, and light. They were decent made pancakes - but there was no wow factor in it for me. I thought that the rhubarb though good, by itself, but with the pancake...it was overpowering.",3.0
"This review is based on a bar experience only. So, we came into Diner yesterday for an after-lunch cocktail. We actually thought this place was another restaurant, and it took awhile to figure out where we were. The place is small with a lunch-counter style bar and a handful of booths. The guys ordered beers ($8 draughts & $5 btls of Presidente) and I had a tasty Hibiscus Tequila concoction. We asked to see a menu, and they hand us a receipt paper with handwritten menu on it. This was awesome. I guess it changes daily, which is about as good as it gets. I switched to a white wine after, and it was something different that I wouldn't usually get. Will def. be back for dinner, this place was cute and I bet the food is tops.",4.0
"One of my favorite places in Williamsburg, along with Marlowe & Sons (neighbor restaurant and same owner).Fresh seasonally grown produce only is used for anything in the menu, making it a tasty worthwhile experience always. It is on the expensive side, but considering how they source the produce, the attention to detail towards everything, and the way everything is prepared, it quickly pays off for itself, leaving you with only one desire at the end of it all: come back as soon as possible.LOVE everything about this place!",5.0
"I had brunch here last weekend with my boyfriend.  I must say... best blood Mary I've ever had!!!  It was perfectly spiced.  Delicious.  I immediately regretted not ordering the large after one sip.  We started with the homemade bacon with some sort of yogurt and tiny, grapefruit-esque fruit.  The bacon was soooo tasty!  The slabs were nice and thick, just the way I like them.  And the contrast with the drippy yogurt and fruit was beyond good.I ordered the country breakfast.  It definitely hit the spot with the big, crumby buscuit topped with sausage gravy.  Yumm.  The collard greens were surprisingly sweet and very tasty.  Together with the scrambled eggs, everything was just right!I had a bite of my b/f's burger and it was delicious.  He was quite pleased with it as well.This place was crowded and the wait was long... but on a warm day, it's worth the wait.  Just enjoy a bloody mary and people watch.",5.0

"I went here for dinner with 2 other people and all of us agreed this place didn't live up to the hype. Our waitress read off the menu by memory and even wrote the menu on the table, which was pretty cool, but the writing was in cursive and looked like a bunch of squiggles; barely readable. I had he pork shoulder cut with fingerling potatoes that night. A plate full of potatoes with a tiny portion of pork the size of 3 fingers and the thickness of 1/4 if an inch. The cut seemed like it was boiled and tasted like regular ham; nothing special. I'll give it another go and hopefully the next experience will change my mind.",2.0
"How do you end your day when you start drinking at 2pm on a Saturday to watch the Euro quarterfinals and then go on an all day long boozefest? You make the trip to Brooklyn and go to Diner of course!We got there around 930 pm and our group of 4 didn't have to wait for a table. The place felt like it could have been someone's mobile home a long time ago but it wasn't dilapidated by any means - in fact the décor was quite charming. Our waitress asked us what we wanted for drinks and we settled on a bottle of La Pepie cabernet. She suggested that we have it chilled. This was a first. I've never had chilled red wine but why not? I don't knock anything till I try it at least once. It turned out to be a great choice for a hot summer night.Onto the food. Our waitress started by writing down the menu on our table. Another first! This was a nice touch cuz it kept us engaged - well, as engaging as four hammered people can be anyway. We got the seared tuna and fried green tomatoes for apps; the duck, rib eye (20 oz) and the burger for mains. The fried green tomatoes with the aioli was amazing, as was the duck which had really good flavors. The rib eye wasn't bad either but they didn't get the temperature quite right. It was medium though we ordered it medium rare. The tuna was perfectly cooked with a raw center and while I didn't try the burger the fries were great. My only gripe is it took about an hour for the entrée to come out. Even though they made it better by giving us a free app plate, it shouldn't take so long to bring out the mains especially since we weren't there during peak hours.  4 stars for food but I had to take away one star for taking so long with the mains.",3.0

"This awful place is crawling with mean rude hipsters who can't even get the food right. Save your time and money and go to some other restaurant in NYC.  My son didn't even eat the gross soggy disgusting ""fries"" they gave him. The food was terrible, the staff was worse.I get it, you're too cool for a written menu, too cool to give out pricing, and you're too cool to associate with people who need high chairs, booster seats, etc... Believe me I get it. We called ahead of time, and no one told us we weren't ALLOWED to bring our 19 month old son to this dump. Instead the Maitre'D waited until we order an expensive bottle of wine and ordered the food to tell me how people are walking out of his restaurant due to noise level that is apparently not caused by the blasting music and crowded floor, but only by my son who is cranky and hungry. ""Take him outside, around the block.."" He told me, Are you serious? I had to spend the whole night outside with my son in the cold, and not an apology, no free drinks no nothing just a big F U. If my husband and I weren't being treated to the dinner by a supplier from out of town I would have paid for the wine and walked out.I've worked in a Michelin rated restaurant in NY, I know sometimes you can have bad night and sometimes you have to go up to a table and say something, but to tell someone to take take their son outside into the cold before even offering some sort of solution is absurd, rude and unprofessional.

"Worst dining experience ever!!!I was actually really looking forward to eating here for a long time, but just haven't had the chance with my schedule as of late. One of the suppliers to my company, Josh, offered to take me out to dinner in my neck of the woods, so I figured this would be the perfect time to check it out. He told me that I can bring my wife and kid to join us. When this place says they are not children friendly, they really mean it. We sat down, ordered a nice bottle of wine and started to settle down. There were no printed menus, which is okay, since the server wrote the menu on the paper that was placed on the table. But the only thing that I knew the prices for were the steaks, which ran a bit pricey. I've waited tables before, one of the most important things is to let the customer know the pricing, so there are no surprises at the end of the night. Just asJosh and I started to discuss business, the server starting pushing for us to order, we definitely felt  as if they were trying to turn the table. Let me also relate to the server on some level, my child is 19 months old and was a bit cranky this particular evening. But instead of offering some form of entertainment or something to occupy my son, the Maitre'D came up to the table and stated, ""It is difficult for me to ask you, but if something is not done to settle your child down, I'm going to need you to take him outside, walk him around the block or something."" He told us about crayons to draw on the paper tablecloth or some fruit to occupy the boy after my wife and son stepped outside at the advice ofthe Maitre'D. At this point our appetizers are about to hit the table, so I didn't want to just walk out on the food, not to mention it wasn't my call since I was being treated to this dinner. Josh, who is truly doing his best to impress me, and I are just sitting there awkwardly muttering a few words to each other got our food, but my wife completely missed all of it. The food wasn't terrible, but it wasn't phenomenal either. The poached egg, sat atop this broth which lacked seasoning, and the greens completely overpowered the dish. The asparagus appetizer was quite good though. My burger was okay, but I wanted toget out of there so fast, feeling for my wife, I did not get a chance to really enjoy anything. I expected more, much more from this place, and was highly disappointed. I will also be filing a complaint to the better business bureau as a business entity, against this place and with NYC.gov.

"If all diner food was as good as Diners', there'd be a shit ton more of them around. Our party of five showed up on a Sunday afternoon around 200pm and waited for one half an hour for our table. They seated us at a large table in the back corner that could really seat 6. Their menu is a bit confusing since they don't really have a set menu as it changes every day. For example, the menu consists of a bunch of things that are done each day, i.e., pancakes, salad, omelet, egg sandwich, soup etc. The server will come over and tell you what each one are for that particular day (pancakes are blueberry today, omelet is feta and spinach, egg sandwich is melted brie, fried onion rings and ham, etc). Then they write the days entrees down on the paper table covers which might be listed as country breakfast, bratwurst and lentils, pork belly, steak frites - you get the idea. It's a great idea and done exceedingly well.  We all ordered large bloody mary's mixed with extra horseradish and a perfect blend of vodka. Then the appetizers, I ordered the greens with lemon vinaigrette, chopped onions, beans and thin sliced apple as did my two of my friends. My friend's girlfriend ordered the fresh crabmeat salad crostini served on pumpernickel - this was the obvious winner as everyone wanted a piece and it was good.Entrees, 2 hamburgers, rare-med rare, fresh brioche buns, house cured pickled red onion, and a leaf of lettuce. Wowwwwweee. A country breakfast with biscuits and sausage gravy, scrambled eggs and these biscuits and gravy, ridiculous.

Arrived slightly  before 11am and didn't have to wait. Will probably need to come back to give it a second chance for dinner.",3.0
"If all diner food was as good as Diners', there'd be a shit ton more of them around. Our party of five showed up on a Sunday afternoon around 200pm and waited for one half an hour for our table. They seated us at a large table in the back corner that could really seat 6. Their menu is a bit confusing since they don't really have a set menu as it changes every day. For example, the menu consists of a bunch of things that are done each day, i.e., pancakes, salad, omelet, egg sandwich, soup etc. The server will come over and tell you what each one are for that particular day (pancakes are blueberry today, omelet is feta and spinach, egg sandwich is melted brie, fried onion rings and ham, etc). Then they write the days entrees down on the paper table covers which might be listed as country breakfast, bratwurst and lentils, pork belly, steak frites - you get the idea. It's a great idea and done exceedingly well.  We all ordered large bloody mary's mixed with extra horseradish and a perfect blend of vodka. Then the appetizers, I ordered the greens with lemon vinaigrette, chopped onions, beans and thin sliced apple as did my two of my friends. My friend's girlfriend ordered the fresh crabmeat salad crostini served on pumpernickel - this was the obvious winner as everyone wanted a piece and it was good.Entrees, 2 hamburgers, rare-med rare, fresh brioche buns, house cured pickled red onion, and a leaf of lettuce. Wowwwwweee. A country breakfast with biscuits and sausage gravy, scrambled eggs and these biscuits and gravy, ridiculous. An order of the steak frites and the pork belly served with grits, braised greens, wow again. Next time you are in Brooklyn, look this place up; it is well worth the trip. Finished with a hot toddy, again, amazing.",5.0
"Sometimes the food is fantastic, sometimes it's transcendent. Either way, it's worth it. You can count on Diner. You can count on there to be a wait, the service to be exceptional, and the food to satisfy that itch for a thoughtful, unpretentious, damn fine meal.",5.0
"Get ready for a crazy scene, a possible wait, and a charming if cramped experience. The food is simply terrific. And the waiters ingratiate themselves to you, sitting by you and drawing items on the paper on your table as they describe them. At least they did for me the last time I went. I would recommend this place to faux-foodies and real foodies. There is care put into the menu and the prep--there's a reason theyv'e been a longstanding toast of the town.  Worth checking out. But if you don't like crowds and coo-el, stay away.  Often crowded with Hipster Doofi.",4.0
"I like that every time I come here, it's like trying a new restaurant except that I'm not worrying about too-hip-for-thou service, mediocre brunch choices, inconsistent wait times or other miscellaneous adventure-related nonsense. For brunch, it's hard to get more excited for anywhere: I've never waited, the staff is knowledgable and sweet, I've never had anything I didn't love, there are scones with devonshire cream, and unlimited refills on delicious coffee.Also, my mom and boyfriend and BFF/roommate came here with me, and now I am forever graced with memories of my fave people in my fave place, being awesome.**Docked a star for the bloody mary's. I love that they have a little size, but there's not enough soupy tomatoey peppery goodness to offset the heavy-pour booze, which led to me running into the street on weekend shouting ""I AM THE QUEEN OF SUMMER."" At noon.**",4.0
"I've been here twice once for brunch and once for a late night diner. Both times the food was consistently great, made with farm fresh ingredients.The service was also outstanding even though the time we went for dinner was perhaps 10 minutes before the kitchen closed - I've been to plenty of places that made you feel very unwelcome towards closing time, but not here. You get the feeling this is a place that truly cares about what they are doing, they have created a very special restaurant. It isn't cheep but it is well worth it.",5.0
"Beautiful little details in a lovingly cared for diner car, the tight space is filled with promising smells of really good cooking. Perfectly executed salads, soups and a stellar burger.

"The atmosphere is very nice and the service was excellent.  The food was neither.  While the ingredients were fresh, the overall preparation was terrible.  I ordered a white fish (bass I think, maybe cod).  It was slightly burned on the outside and completely uncooked in the center.  My special woman friend ordered the duck.  I am no duck expert so take this with a grain of salt.  The duck was roughly half fat and skin and the other half meat.  Maybe that's normal?  She weighs in around 100 lbs and was still hungry.  The part that was meat was very good.I could probably name 5 restaurants in the same price range or less that I would recommend over Diner.  Here goes:  Lighthouse, St. Anselm, Traif, Sweetwater, Rye.  I could go on...",2.0

"This classed up diner near the Williamsburg Bridge follows the Wburg formula of making everything blue collar really expensive.

But Diner mostly rewards the journey.Inside there are booths and tile but candles and swank instead of lights that make you look 100 years old. It took us a little while to get a table so we took to the bar for what my friends said were alternately ""good"" and ""not good"" cocktails (I'm not in AA or anything, I just had a beer.) When the waiter took our order he wrote the menu on the piece of paper covering our table, and though he explained it all we were left with a grid that said stuff like ""chicken"" and ""cod.""

"There is nothing quite like Diner. In all my travels I have yet to find its equal. That may sound like hyperbole, but I assure you it is not. I'm sitting there now, writing this review on their white parchment table-setting, cramped in one of their tiny booths to the right of the door. It's dusk and the lone candle on our off-kilter table flickers as I write these words.The space is smaller than you would expect, ill-fitted for the amount of people it sees every night. Waits can be long. Andrew Tarlow, the owner of Diner and a slew of other Billyburg mainstays, took to the crazed idea of cramming his first venture into an old 1920's metal dining car--hence the name, the food itself bears little resemblance to your typical diner fare. The exterior recently gained a facelift with new wood and a fresh coat of red paint but the inside still has that wonderful patina of decades long past. The floor slopes, bar stools wobble, tables slant. The bathrooms are so small one can barely turn around, and if you're sitting on the end of a booth you are sure to be jostled by the waiters and other patrons. The staff are often surly, and quite probably still hungover from the night before, serving your meal with a mixture of apathy and disdain. These may sound like slights but they add to the charm and endear the place all the more. It's the masochist in me, I guess.Of course these musings will have to be transcribed and, knowing me, revised, but the sentiment contained herein will remain the same. It speaks through the spilt beer and stains of ketchup, the oil spots from dropped fries and succulent hamburgers cooked to perfection. All remnants of a meal savored and long remembered.There aren't a variety of choices for their burgers, just grass-fed beef on a warm challah roll with a leaf of lettuce and pickled onions on the side. You can add cheese if you're so inclined. There's your choice, would you like a cheeseburger or a hamburger?Each time I order it I think it cannot possibly be as good as the last--having the handicap of the present and lacking the rosy-tint bestowed upon a memory--and, yet, every time it lives up to that memory. The tenderness of the beef, the freshness of the bun, the saltiness and the crunch of the fries.There are other menu items that change with the season and the waiter recounting them tries her best to steer you away from the goal, tries to tempt you with other fare. Sometimes she succeeds. Everything I have ever ordered was superb, but few compare to the magnificence of that burger. Except for the Prime Rib. When I state that I want their Prime Rib to be the last meal I ever eat, I mean just that. It came perfectly seasoned with a light char on the outside and the middle cooked to a medium-rare nonpareil and when you cut a piece and placed it in your mouth it practically melted. It was paired with a watercress salad in a light lemon-vinaigrette with just the hint of cracked black pepper and when finished with a lush Côtes-du-Rhône, rolling over your tongue, marrying the flavors...well, the sensation is not suitable to print. The three played upon each other as great musicians might play upon each other, elevating one another to the point of sublimity. Again, you may think hyperbole but you would be mistaken. The words I use are a paltry shadow of the rapture that was that meal. But, alas, a ninety-two dollar cut of steak and a very expensive bottle of wine are not an everyday occurrence. They are saved for those special occasions. Last meals.And so it's the burger that draws you back time after time. That and the dream of the perfect steak.

"Took my parents on a stroll on the Heights Promenade followed by dinner here this past Sunday... again, the service was great.  Food? Amazingly delicious. My parents couldn't stop raving about how good everything was and normally they are very critical of my restaurant picks.  Cocktails were also great.  Desserts were great.  Pasta?  Still wonderful.  It may be ""off the radar"" for the rapidly evolving and fiercely trendy NY food scene... but they're still one of those places I'd bring out-of-towners for a true taste of NYC (or Brooklyn rather).We had the same ""tasteless"" beef shank that Carmela F. had... it was cooked properly this time.  Yes, the polenta was very creamy but the beef was ultra tender with a huge amount of beefy and savory flavor.Our tile fish was incredibly tender and again full of flavor (maybe something is wrong with their taste buds as this was definitely not under- nor over-seasoned) . Our true favorite was the pork belly with brussel sprouts.  Taiwanese people LOVE pork belly and we're also insanely picky about having it cooked properly... a great example of how to retain the tenderness of the meat while amazingly having a crispy crust without tasting like a slab of fat.  My parents asked for a second helping of the brussel sprouts because they were so impressed and the kitchen actually was nice enough to oblige for a very fair price.The simple desserts?  Well, the flourless chocolate cake was delicious, rich and creamy... it was probably a tad sweeter than we'd like but the mousse was spot on, balancing sweetness with strong cocoa flavor perfectly.The best compliment I've heard for Diner's food is that it tastes ""Chinese"" with a depth of flavor and savoriness that's present in the best of Chinese cuisine that have been perfected over hundreds of years. The PQR is still spot on... amazing food, service was super friendly, professional, and very knowledgeable... the bill was very reasonable considering we also had drinks.  Unlike Butter, it was all beyond ""nice""... tons of other reviews say ""amazing.""  And yes, there were plenty of hipsters but I think we were all just folks looking for a amazing meal.",5.0
Diner makes me happy because:1) the food is fucking delicious.2) they recite the whole menu to you and write it as they go on the table. 3) I like dining in a twinkie shaped room!,5.0
"This spot is ideal for down-to-earth duets, or 2-3 low-key pals; but feels suitable for pretty much anyone who isn't lame. Don't dine with the lame, but if you must, certainly don't dine with them at Diner. They don't deserve it, and they won't appreciate it.Because: shanty-chic Diner is the best restaurant in Williamsburg. It feels both local and extraordinary- a roadside brick cottage lazing in the industrial junklot under the Williamsburg Bridge, with dynamic and delicious daily menus, and slim, sugar-voiced servers who probably regularly make Craigslist's Missed Connections column.Diner may seem a bit small-town, but the food is cooked and garnished in accordance with NYC standards. It's good and tasty and  fanciful and just a little bit fancy. It's cheap - a multi-course dinner runs in the $15 - $30 range / head. Diner's signature quirk is that the menu changes daily, and is scrawled at every table change in casually perfect penmanship on the paper tablecloths. The romantic in me admires the style (a love letter, to my stomach!); the eater in me adores the simplicity. Five to six simple options: soup, salad, fish, meat. Dessert.  This is the way neighborhood restaurants ought to be - simple, but with a strong brand, and inaccessible or invisible to those that don't know and love the neighborhood.",5.0

"If there was ever a way to give a sixth star.... Diner would be amongst the first places to pop into my head...At Diner, you never know what to expect... but in an awesome way. That's because they make the menu fresh every day based on what's seasonal and what strikes their creative fancy. Which earns them huge stars for originality, creativity, and work ethic. Well, come on.. get at it, what did you have???Being summer, the lady and I started with the peach and cucumber soup... A beautifully chilled and pureed soup tricked out with some super quality yogurt, scallions, and radishes. Absolutely one of the best treats of the summer. Super tasty and refreshing.Next.... the house made fettuccine with eggplant, squash, onions, and garlic. Light and tender, the pasta was amazing and the quality was so fresh you could taste the egg in the pasta. Vegetables were tender and savory. Garlic was wonderfully roasted. Top it off with shaved reggiano... A wonderful summer dish that made me remember my pastafarian roots.The piece du resistance of the day = green bean salad with bacon slab. Being a baconsaurus, this immediately struck my fancy as a must have dish. Beans were lightly roasted and tossed with breadcrumbs, garlic, oil, and shallots, beans, basil, eggplant and cherry tomatoes. Light salt. Throw on two of the most amazingly smoked hunks of bacon ever that were, so tender they fell apart just by staring at them, and you have one of the best dishes consumed.The beef heart carpaccio and bone marrow was the reserve dish that I never got around to that day, but I'm hoping it will happen another time to try. A bit out of my adventure comfort that day. But I'll be back for sure for something out of the ordinary here! They also seem to have a standard burger on their menu that I'm sure is out of this world.Dessert.... O yeah Dessert. Peach and blueberry pie!!! And I mean a personal little pie with fresh whipped cream. Incredibly flaky buttery crust hit the spot soooooooo nicely.Raspberry and plum crumb!!! Represented the pinnacle of freshness and summer fruits and berries. Served with a nice sour yogurt... Orgasmically fresh, and the crumbs were nicely spiced with nutmeg and Cinnamon.All this talk about food is making me thirsty.... Well they have some nice seasonal beers on bottle and tap to quench that thirst. They also do up some very nice sounding cocktails that are guaranteed to pack a punch!O yeah, I forgot that there are servers and ambiance here. Well, being in an old diner, and not doing much to the decor really sets the feel of this place. Counter (pretty much a bar now) and booths appear to have never been touched by the hand of time (though they do have a more modern seating area in the back). Nice and dim lighting sets the mood to the oldies and alternative over the PA. Outdoor is available on the nice days, but I dig the vibe here. The service is equally wonderful as the setting. Uber friendly staff sits next to you and goes over the menu for the day and writes it down on the table setting. Additionally, they give you ample time to mill over the options before returning to take care of your order. Bottles of tap on the table take care of not having to ask over and over for palate cleanser. The staff genuinely seems as excited for the food as you are. Lovely experience indeed.Diner is definitely the place to go for a true treat!!! And if any place deserves an above the top rating... This is It... EAT UPS!!!!",5.0
"Marlow & Sons and Diner are pretty much the same spot right next to each other.  I been here a few time and every time had been great.  Service is top notch and food is great.  Not a fan of the bathroom and I have a short attention span so I don't like the no menu part very much.  I just said yeah give me what you just said.  This is the only reason I cross the bridge, I hope to find more reason to cross the bridge.",4.0
"Refreshing to find a good comfy meal after too many bad experiences in New York.I headed to Williamsburg on a cold Tuesday, December. Christmas coming.Robert Goncalves, the owner of Domaine Wine Bar in Long Island City was praising this restaurant for a long long time.From outside, this restaurant looks like one of those restaurant-diners that I could only find in Montana or North Dakota.  But then , when you read the menu and take a first look at a wine list....you might change your mind...Celery root soup, pheasant susage in a pheasant consome, filet mignon with french fries and a apple crumb cake were great dishes, well cooked, satisfiying.Domaine Le Deux Anes from Corbieres was the wine of the night.A blend of Carignan and Grenache Noir this Funky Cold medina has all the poopiness you might expect form a terroir driven importer like Jenny & Francois.I will definitely be back.Kudos for the unusual. interesting and exciting wine list, with nice little bottles  from France and Italy. Great place.One little complaint - I wish the stone cold hotties working there would be friendlier and warmer....The winter's here...",4.0
"Took my parents on a stroll on the Heights Promenade followed by dinner here this past Sunday... again, the service was great.  Food? Amazingly delicious. My parents couldn't stop raving about how good everything was and normally they are very critical of my restaurant picks.  Cocktails were also great.  Desserts were great.  Pasta?  Still wonderful.  It may be ""off the radar"" for the rapidly evolving and fiercely trendy NY food scene... but they're still one of those places I'd bring out-of-towners for a true taste of NYC (or Brooklyn rather).We had the same ""tasteless"" beef shank that Carmela F. had... it was cooked properly this time.  Yes, the polenta was very creamy but the beef was ultra tender with a huge amount of beefy and savory flavor.Our tile fish was incredibly tender and again full of flavor (maybe something is wrong with their taste buds as this was definitely not under- nor over-seasoned) . Our true favorite was the pork belly with brussel sprouts.  Taiwanese people LOVE pork belly and we're also insanely picky about having it cooked properly... a great example of how to retain the tenderness of the meat while amazingly having a crispy crust without tasting like a slab of fat.  My parents asked for a second helping of the brussel sprouts because they were so impressed and the kitchen actually was nice enough to oblige for a very fair price.The simple desserts?  Well, the flourless chocolate cake was delicious, rich and creamy... it was probably a tad sweeter than we'd like but the mousse was spot on, balancing sweetness with strong cocoa flavor perfectly.The best compliment I've heard for Diner's food is that it tastes ""Chinese"" with a depth of flavor and savoriness that's present in the best of Chinese cuisine that have been perfected over hundreds of years. The PQR is still spot on... amazing food, service was super friendly, professional, and very knowledgeable... the bill was very reasonable considering we also had drinks.  Unlike Butter, it was all beyond ""nice""... tons of other reviews say ""amazing.""  And yes, there were plenty of hipsters but I think we were all just folks looking for a amazing meal.",5.0
Diner makes me happy because:1) the food is fucking delicious.2) they recite the whole menu to you and write it as they go on the table. 3) I like dining in a twinkie shaped room!,5.0
"This spot is ideal for down-to-earth duets, or 2-3 low-key pals; but feels suitable for pretty much anyone who isn't lame. Don't dine with the lame, but if you must, certainly don't dine with them at Diner. They don't deserve it, and they won't appreciate it.Because: shanty-chic Diner is the best restaurant in Williamsburg. It feels both local and extraordinary- a roadside brick cottage lazing in the industrial junklot under the Williamsburg Bridge, with dynamic and delicious daily menus, and slim, sugar-voiced servers who probably regularly make Craigslist's Missed Connections column.Diner may seem a bit small-town, but the food is cooked and garnished in accordance with NYC standards. It's good and tasty and  fanciful and just a little bit fancy. It's cheap - a multi-course dinner runs in the $15 - $30 range / head. Diner's signature quirk is that the menu changes daily, and is scrawled at every table change in casually perfect penmanship on the paper tablecloths. The romantic in me admires the style (a love letter, to my stomach!); the eater in me adores the simplicity. Five to six simple options: soup, salad, fish, meat. Dessert.  This is the way neighborhood restaurants ought to be - simple, but with a strong brand, and inaccessible or invisible to those that don't know and love the neighborhood.",5.0
"this place is a hidden gem! the wait on the weekends is long, but totally worth the wait.the server writes the menu on the tables, like the fish of the day, the vegetable of the day and so on and so forth. the signature drinks are funky and packed with flavor, the tangerine scone was probably one of the best ive ever had in my life. id love to go again, on a day when i have hours to wait ;)",5.0
"FIne overall, but overpriced and unremarkable food, with a heavy helping of pomp and elitist pretentious bs, which I find repellant. As with many institutional eating establishments in NY, Diner is resting heavily on its laurels. The neighborhood has more than caught up with this place, it has surpassed it. Diner seems to be the last to know.",2.0
"They handwrite the menue on the table as they explain it to you, a little too hip for my taste... And you don't get an idea of what the meal is really like since you only remember the main ingredient. Food was pretty good though, even if I didn't get what I had expected!",3.0
"I was a little apprehensive at first, walking up to the ramshackle corner spot, entering through a rickety door to see a pretty cramped space...but since making a trek out to Williamsburg just to check it...I had to stick to the plan.So glad I did because, Oh My God, one of the best brunch meals ever!Shared the:Poached Eggs - with broccoli puree, toast with pancetta (to die for!)Country Breakfast - scrambled eggs (how can they be that good??), sweetened kale (yum!!), biscuits and gravyAdd in some large bloody mary's and the realization that Blue Bottle was a few streets away = :))",5.0
"If there was ever a way to give a sixth star.... Diner would be amongst the first places to pop into my head...At Diner, you never know what to expect... but in an awesome way. That's because they make the menu fresh every day based on what's seasonal and what strikes their creative fancy. Which earns them huge stars for originality, creativity, and work ethic. Well, come on.. get at it, what did you have???Being summer, the lady and I started with the peach and cucumber soup... A beautifully chilled and pureed soup tricked out with some super quality yogurt, scallions, and radishes. Absolutely one of the best treats of the summer. Super tasty and refreshing.Next.... the house made fettuccine with eggplant, squash, onions, and garlic. Light and tender, the pasta was amazing and the quality was so fresh you could taste the egg in the pasta. Vegetables were tender and savory. Garlic was wonderfully roasted. Top it off with shaved reggiano... A wonderful summer dish that made me remember my pastafarian roots.The piece du resistance of the day = green bean salad with bacon slab. Being a baconsaurus, this immediately struck my fancy as a must have dish. Beans were lightly roasted and tossed with breadcrumbs, garlic, oil, and shallots, beans, basil, eggplant and cherry tomatoes. Light salt. Throw on two of the most amazingly smoked hunks of bacon ever that were, so tender they fell apart just by staring at them, and you have one of the best dishes consumed.The beef heart carpaccio and bone marrow was the reserve dish that I never got around to that day, but I'm hoping it will happen another time to try. A bit out of my adventure comfort that day. But I'll be back for sure for something out of the ordinary here! They also seem to have a standard burger on their menu that I'm sure is out of this world.Dessert.... O yeah Dessert. Peach and blueberry pie!!! And I mean a personal little pie with fresh whipped cream. Incredibly flaky buttery crust hit the spot soooooooo nicely.Raspberry and plum crumb!!! Represented the pinnacle of freshness and summer fruits and berries. Served with a nice sour yogurt... Orgasmically fresh, and the crumbs were nicely spiced with nutmeg and Cinnamon.All this talk about food is making me thirsty.... Well they have some nice seasonal beers on bottle and tap to quench that thirst. They also do up some very nice sounding cocktails that are guaranteed to pack a punch!O yeah, I forgot that there are servers and ambiance here.

"I decided to come here for lunch with my brother and a friend to catch up. The setting was very much like that of a trailer home turned into a diner. Its small but cozy. There is outdoor seating but we were far too hot from the walk and preferred the cool air conditioned interior. We were greeted the moment we walked in and the waiter was super friendly, though busy, and explained the surprisingly short menu. The down side is that there is no menu given to us, the waiter had to explain and write it down on the paper covering the table. A rather unique concept however, there were no prices. My friend and I ordered the grass-fed burger with fries and my brother ordered the Gumbo. We also had the cornbread as dessert. We were given water in these green, beer-like bottles, which I loved, but was not cold. The food took a bit to arrive but most likely from having to cook it on the spot. The beef was so tender and practically melted in my mouth. I am so glad I chose to come here and have it. However, it was a bit too salty for my test- I could taste the salt granules in my burger. While the beef doesn't look particularly daunting, I had a hard time finishing it and had my brother eat half of it. The gumbo my brother ordered came with shrimp and sausage over rice. The shrimp was amazing. However, the sauce consistency was a bit like curry, which I don't like. Finally, the cornbread. Its presentation was so pretty. It was cooked perfectly, with a crispy outer layer and delicious inner one. There was a type of peach sauce and blueberries around it. The blueberries were sour and not at all appetizing, but everything thing else was delicious. This is definitely a must try if you are craving a great burger. However, it is definitely pricy! I must come here to try brunch!",4.0
"This is one of my favorite restaurants in New York. It's everything I am.. if I was a restaurant. Simple, unassuming, seasonal and local cuisine.

It's grass fed and it's only like, $13, on a brioche bun! It's one of those places that uses every bit of the animal in delicious, creative ways. The way food should be done. Good place to take a date to, although be careful and make sure your date is not a vegetarian. I made this mistake once, not asking her dietary restrictions, and when the server came and wrote down the specials on the butcher paper that covers the table, it was nothing but stuff like, rabbit rillettes, sweetbreads, liver and... fish. hahah...

"Diner is another charming addition to the busting Williamsburg brunch scene, and has a few standout qualities that put it at the top of this pretty long list. I had brunch here on a late September Saturday morning when it was still lovely enough to sit outside. The brunch menu presented a well-priced offering of American brunch dishes, most of which were casual and the perfect supplement to what most people need to be a hangover cure. Offerings ranged from omelets to pancakes to various salads and sandwiches, so overall very laid back and completely unpretentious. I had a large omelet, which was served with breakfast potatoes, and it was really great. A friend had the breakfast sandwich (I believe it was egg & sausage) and that looked even better than what I was having. Thumbs up on the good coffee as well, which the attentive and friendly staff repeatedly topped off for everyone. The restaurant itself is cute and the name comes from it having been a former diner (or at least I think so). The interior is long and narrow, but larger than it looks from the outside. There is a hidden dining room behind the main area, so they can accommodate quite a few people at rush times, and as I mentioned, the outdoor seating was a big plus.  Overall, a highly recommended stop if you're in need of some good brunch on Williamsburg's South Side.",4.0

"I'd heard such good things about Diner but was very disappointed.First, good points: Diner has great atmosphere, and we had great service.Now, bad: I found it very strange that there was no menu but that our server wrote down every available item on our paper tablecloth. It was also very weird that no prices were mentioned. We ordered an appetizer, two entrees, a bottle of wine (there *was* a wine list with prices), and afterward, two desserts. Our appetizer was very good. But then both of our entries were unbelievably over-salted. Like, shockingly so. We feel awful sending anything back so we thought about it for a minute and just decided to eat the entrees anyway. The chicken I ordered was a bit tough and stringy. The dessert I ordered, a flourless chocolate cake, was bland and chalky and had just come out of the fridge; none of the homemade warm molten goodness I was hoping for.After our meal, I was very surprised to see that our bill was $144. We eat out at nice places in Williamsburg all the time and this is way higher than average, even for the best places in the neighborhood. $144 is a lot of money to pay for food that wasn't even good.The check wasn't itemized in any way, which was annoying, so I did some math in my head to try to figure out where the hell this $144 total came from. Our bottle of wine was $42; that was the one item we knew the price of. So, let's see, guessing some prices here, that's one appetizer at $15, two over-salted entrees at $30(!) each, and two bland desserts at $13.50 each. Plus the wine, and that come out to our total, $144. Do those prices seem a little bit crazy-high to you? Especially for food that's not enjoyable?",2.0
"Charming atmosphere, but not good for claustrophobic guests. Loud and cramped for a place out in Williamsburg. Our waitress scrawled the menu items onto our table cloth in ballpoint pen. So that's charming if you're good at reading cursive upside down, and pretentiously annoying if you're not.Our table ordered the bass, the strip steak, the sirloin, and the burger. All were tasty but expensive, and the portions were small, so minus half a star for value.The kitchen was very slow, and they had run out of filet by 8pm,  so minus another star for kitchen logistics.Our waitress was excellent; attentive with the drinks and food, and comped one of our meals that my friend thought was ""chewy"".I won't go here again, but it was fun to try.",3.0
"A fellow foodie friend was in town so we knew we had to get our game right and take him out for good eats. **side note: the last time we had foodie friends in town and attempted Diner, the unfortunate combo of the long wait, frigid coldness, and lack of space forced us to bail and head elsewhere. so, scoring space at the bar for our 10 min wait was cool and cool** So, this time, we were told the wait would be about 45, but the hostess sat us before we could even finish our first drink at the bar. This, as well as the aforementioned drinks, were great starts for what was to be a superb dinner. The menu included several incredible sounding dishes, but we decided on the Spinach Salad and White Bean soup to start.

"OMG.  This place makes me want to give up my comfortable life in suburban DFW and move to an apt across the street from them.We were in NYC for only a few days but I made sure this place secured a spot on our ""must go"" list.  That meant we had to take a subway from Midtown, but we don't mind that generally.  It was cold and windy and the long 5-6 blocks from the station to the restaurant almost got us to ditch the plan and stop at Peter Lugar's.  So glad we didn't.We were told it would be a half hour wait and she showed us to a little corner at the end of the bar where we could stay out of the way and not be outside in the cold.  Eventually, seats at the bar opened so we grabbed those and ordered wine.  They offered to feed us at the bar but since we had already waited 15 of our 30 minutes and the bar stools aren't very comfy, we opted to wait for a table.  In the end we waited an hour because there was this one table of three who WOULD NOT LEAVE.  I mean, really people.  Lingering over coffee and dessert is fine after a nice meal.  But they sat there another 30-40 minutes after paying the bill.

"Went via a suggestion from a friend and so glad we did!!This restored corner diner is a gem. Great atmosphere, libations and even more amazing food. The menu changes daily, so they come and scribble it on the table for you when you sit down. Love that personal touch! The wait staff was super friendly and knowledgeable. It's always nice to know exactly where your food is coming from and how exactly it's being prepared. There's delicious fare for carnivores and vegetarians alike. Can't wait to come back and see what's on the menu that day!",5.0
"I'd heard such good things about Diner but was very disappointed.First, good points: Diner has great atmosphere, and we had great service.Now, bad: I found it very strange that there was no menu but that our server wrote down every available item on our paper tablecloth. It was also very weird that no prices were mentioned. We ordered an appetizer, two entrees, a bottle of wine (there *was* a wine list with prices), and afterward, two desserts. Our appetizer was very good. But then both of our entries were unbelievably over-salted. Like, shockingly so. We feel awful sending anything back so we thought about it for a minute and just decided to eat the entrees anyway. The chicken I ordered was a bit tough and stringy. The dessert I ordered, a flourless chocolate cake, was bland and chalky and had just come out of the fridge; none of the homemade warm molten goodness I was hoping for.After our meal, I was very surprised to see that our bill was $144. We eat out at nice places in Williamsburg all the time and this is way higher than average, even for the best places in the neighborhood. $144 is a lot of money to pay for food that wasn't even good.The check wasn't itemized in any way, which was annoying, so I did some math in my head to try to figure out where the hell this $144 total came from. Our bottle of wine was $42; that was the one item we knew the price of. So, let's see, guessing some prices here, that's one appetizer at $15, two over-salted entrees at $30(!) each, and two bland desserts at $13.50 each. Plus the wine, and that come out to our total, $144. Do those prices seem a little bit crazy-high to you? Especially for food that's not enjoyable?",2.0
"Charming atmosphere, but not good for claustrophobic guests. Loud and cramped for a place out in Williamsburg. Our waitress scrawled the menu items onto our table cloth in ballpoint pen. So that's charming if you're good at reading cursive upside down, and pretentiously annoying if you're not.Our table ordered the bass, the strip steak, the sirloin, and the burger. All were tasty but expensive, and the portions were small, so minus half a star for value.The kitchen was very slow, and they had run out of filet by 8pm,  so minus another star for kitchen logistics.Our waitress was excellent; attentive with the drinks and food, and comped one of our meals that my friend thought was ""chewy"".I won't go here again, but it was fun to try.",3.0
"A fellow foodie friend was in town so we knew we had to get our game right and take him out for good eats. **side note: the last time we had foodie friends in town and attempted Diner, the unfortunate combo of the long wait, frigid coldness, and lack of space forced us to bail and head elsewhere. so, scoring space at the bar for our 10 min wait was cool and cool** So, this time, we were told the wait would be about 45, but the hostess sat us before we could even finish our first drink at the bar.

Appetizers came. We got the squid salad, which was delicious. Little did we (that would be us plus the man half of the other side of the table) know, tragedy would hit shortly after. On our end, we faced a mediocre cut of steak and anticlimactic burger. But in view of our neighbor's disposition, I can't complain.

"Apparently Marlow & Sons and Diner are owned by the same person.  We decided to stop into M and S for a quick cocktail before hitting up Diner for dinner.  After dismissing multiple items off the menu that were oh-so-very tempting, we decided to split the burger and the rotisserie 1/2 chicken for our main courses.  We started with a kale salad which was incredible! In an attempt to not be overly gluttonous, I had to dismiss the potato leek soup which sounded and smelled intoxicating as well.Tjhe burger was not as juicy and rare as I'm used to/how I normally like it, but it was a good burger! The french fries were cripsy and more memorable than the burger and the soggy bun it was served on.On the other hand, the chicken was superb! Comparably awesome to my beloved chicken at Zuni Cafe (located in San Francisco), it was satisfyingly tasty and came served with sauteed bok choy, squash confit garlic and herbs, and a sherry pan sauce. Yum.  Our server was hipsta-dorable and answered all our questions thoroughly.  We didn't even get and / or need a menu - she explained each dish while writing it down for us right on our table!  I definitely would recommend Diner to anyone and can't wait to go back!",4.0

"I.... don't.... like..... hipsters.There! I said it. It can't be taken back! That being said it's Williamsburg so obviously it's a mecca for the hipster crowd and Diner is no exception. It helps that every single time I've come here for a meal, I've bumped into Josh Hartnett and who doesn't love that kind of eye candy.I believe he lives across the street from this place (is he going to sue me for writing that down here?)Okay, back to Diner. This place is like the hipster-y throw back of a 50's diner, a little run down looking and I'm pretty sure the whole place is somewhat lopsided but there is no denying this place has character.The wait staff is attentive when they're not too busy being fabulous and mingling with the regulars (sadly I am not) and they read out the day's menu to you while simultaneously writing on the big white sheet of paper that serves as your tablecloth.Since the menu changes almost daily, there's not a lot of point in telling which specific dishes except maybe that the hamburger is outstanding, juicy and delicious and everything a hamburger should be, and that there was with beet salad that I tried once that I can't seem to get out of my head. Beets! Who would've thunk it!I suggest that if you're strolling around the neighbourhood, you should mosey on over and grab a bite here.

been here a few more times since my first review.so good every time. EVERY TIME.BURRRGGERRRRRRRRR!,5.0
"I came here yesterday for Saturday brunch around 1 pm and the wait wasn't too bad.  Sure, it felt like the staff people took their time to acknowledge us (all of them did seem pretty busy tending to their tables) and I wanted to seat ourselves since there were 2 empty tables right in front of us.  But, patience is a virtue and after about 10 minutes, we eventually got seated.  It was pretty cool that our waitress scribbled down their specials on our table, but it still didn't keep us from asking, ""So, what's in that dish again?""  I ordered their pancakes with the rhubarb compost and it was delicious!  (Not as good as Clinton St. Bakery's :) The dish came with 3 decent sized pancakes and I took my time savoring the flavors.  I didn't bother using the maple syrup because the compost was sweet enough to carry the flavors of the pancakes.  I felt satisfied after finishing my meal.  One of my other friends ordered the country breakfast.  Though it looked good, I couldn't believe how drenched the biscuits were in the gravy, to the point where I didn't realize those were biscuits at all.The interior, as my friends had quipped, felt like we were inside a boat.",4.0
A lovely meal of somewhat innovative cuisine prepared perfectly. The grilled corn on the cob was exceptional. Our swordfish which can dry out quickly if not cooked perfectly was cooked as perfect as I have ever had. The swordfish was served over a light plumb sauce with a side of bok choy which almost always I find a bit unappealing as it is normally a bit slimy. This bok choy was cooked fully but was crunchy and delightful. Dessert was a delicious maple flan with shortbread.

LOVE THIS PLACE. second time going to diner today - did not disappoint. i was able to get a table w/no wait at 2:30PM. i had the corn beef hash w/poached eggs. my bestie had the country breakfast plate - the gravy is out of this world! we shared a spinach salad w/mustard vinaigrette and washed it down w/some bloody marys.the food is always solid+ amazing!! no complaints w/service.Diner and Rye are my 2 fave go-to brunch spots in southside willyburg. 2 thumbs up!!!,4.0
"*Still* one of my favorite places--and even when it's crowded (if you don't mind the wait) most of the seating is comfortable enough (meaning unlike some places where you're elbow to elbow with strangers--and their conversations--here there's space in the booths to have relative privacy, albeit a noisy atmosphere).  To really enjoy the offerings be adventurous with your selections.  Being shy can cause missed opportunities here.  It's less exotic than bold...which is not meant to be a negative observation at all!",4.0

"Apparently Marlow & Sons and Diner are owned by the same person.  We decided to stop into M and S for a quick cocktail before hitting up Diner for dinner.  After dismissing multiple items off the menu that were oh-so-very tempting, we decided to split the burger and the rotisserie 1/2 chicken for our main courses.  We started with a kale salad which was incredible! In an attempt to not be overly gluttonous, I had to dismiss the potato leek soup which sounded and smelled intoxicating as well.Tjhe burger was not as juicy and rare as I'm used to/how I normally like it, but it was a good burger! The french fries were cripsy and more memorable than the burger and the soggy bun it was served on.On the other hand, the chicken was superb! Comparably awesome to my beloved chicken at Zuni Cafe (located in San Francisco), it was satisfyingly tasty and came served with sauteed bok choy, squash confit garlic and herbs, and a sherry pan sauce. Yum.  Our server was hipsta-dorable and answered all our questions thoroughly.  We didn't even get and / or need a menu - she explained each dish while writing it down for us right on our table!  I definitely would recommend Diner to anyone and can't wait to go back!",4.0
"A small, cozy place with loud music. The food is so-so and not really worth it. As a vegetarian, there's the minuscule fettuccine dish. Eh.Went back for brunch: much better! The dinner here is a total bust but the brunch is pretty fantastic. The pastries were really delicious and a necessary splurge. They also were very accommodating for my vegetarian ways and happily made substitutions.",4.0

"I.... don't.... like..... hipsters.There! I said it. It can't be taken back! That being said it's Williamsburg so obviously it's a mecca for the hipster crowd and Diner is no exception. It helps that every single time I've come here for a meal, I've bumped into Josh Hartnett and who doesn't love that kind of eye candy.I believe he lives across the street from this place (is he going to sue me for writing that down here?)Okay, back to Diner. This place is like the hipster-y throw back of a 50's diner, a little run down looking and I'm pretty sure the whole place is somewhat lopsided but there is no denying this place has character.The wait staff is attentive when they're not too busy being fabulous and mingling with the regulars (sadly I am not) and they read out the day's menu to you while simultaneously writing on the big white sheet of paper that serves as your tablecloth.Since the menu changes almost daily, there's not a lot of point in telling which specific dishes except maybe that the hamburger is outstanding, juicy and delicious and everything a hamburger should be, and that there was with beet salad that I tried once that I can't seem to get out of my head. Beets! Who would've thunk it!I suggest that if you're strolling around the neighbourhood, you should mosey on over and grab a bite here. Unpretentious food at only slightly pretentious prices but that's Williamsburg for you.",4.0
been here a few more times since my first review.so good every time. EVERY TIME.BURRRGGERRRRRRRRR!,5.0
"I came here yesterday for Saturday brunch around 1 pm and the wait wasn't too bad.  Sure, it felt like the staff people took their time to acknowledge us (all of them did seem pretty busy tending to their tables) and I wanted to seat ourselves since there were 2 empty tables right in front of us.  But, patience is a virtue and after about 10 minutes, we eventually got seated.  It was pretty cool that our waitress scribbled down their specials on our table, but it still didn't keep us from asking, ""So, what's in that dish again?""  I ordered their pancakes with the rhubarb compost and it was delicious!  (Not as good as Clinton St. Bakery's :) The dish came with 3 decent sized pancakes and I took my time savoring the flavors.  I didn't bother using the maple syrup because the compost was sweet enough to carry the flavors of the pancakes.  I felt satisfied after finishing my meal.  One of my other friends ordered the country breakfast.  Though it looked good, I couldn't believe how drenched the biscuits were in the gravy, to the point where I didn't realize those were biscuits at all.The interior, as my friends had quipped, felt like we were inside a boat.",4.0
A lovely meal of somewhat innovative cuisine prepared perfectly. The grilled corn on the cob was exceptional. Our swordfish which can dry out quickly if not cooked perfectly was cooked as perfect as I have ever had. The swordfish was served over a light plumb sauce with a side of bok choy which almost always I find a bit unappealing as it is normally a bit slimy. This bok choy was cooked fully but was crunchy and delightful. Dessert was a delicious maple flan with shortbread. The shortbread was exceptional and not overly short.It is so nice to walk away from a meal feeling satisfied and not ripped of. Bravo to Diner!,5.0

"Either I hit my dad in a bad food mood or I am totally wrong about his palate. But it doesn't matter that he didn't enjoy this meal because I LOVED it. Diner is one of the shining culinary lights of Williamsburg in my opinion. I really admire the seasonal dishes and cozy/shabby decor. So I thought it would be a great place to take my dad and is girlfriend out to dinner. Little did I know that she grew up in Queens and is still under the impression that all of Brooklyn is controlled by the Hasidim and utterly unlivable. And my dad had a cold. We got there at 6:30 and had NO trouble finding a seat. I was ready to order a bottle of wine or at least a cocktail but everyone at the table gave me a look when I suggested it so my husband and I just split the Six Point Brownstone: nice beer, little tangier than I like it. For starters I had the Duck Hearts with Rhubarb Butter. Amazing. Since getting into liver I've thought about venturing into other organs and this was definitely rewarding. It is such a strong muscle really that it makes sense that it would taste good. Husband said it just tasted like duck. Hmmm. The rhubarb butter was amazing - must learn to make at home... For my entree I had the Fish Stew which was very salty. The mussels were a little undercooked but the fish was amazing and the greens in the soup were very tasty. I tough the saffron was a bit overpowered by the salt but overall, very nice. Two people at the table had burgers and The chicken was great but 1/2 a chicken is a lot for one person. And of course, for dessert we ordered a piece of the flourless chocolate cake. I had to share but it was worth it. Next time I'll make sure I go with foodies.",5.0

"An old metal diner has been converted....wait, no, it hasn't. An old metal diner remains an old metal diner with some of the best food in all of New York.

"My first NYC review! After seeing this on ""No Reservations"" I was pumped to try this place. Let me preface by saying, I want to give it a 5, but just can't. Reasons for deserving a 5-:1. Love, love the decor, totally awesome old diner with a very Brooklyn vibe to it (if I even know what that means yet). You won me on ambience alone. 2. Service was also fantastic, our server was very nice, friendly and attentive but not annoying, perfect. 3. Nice menu- everything sounds good and interesting, I'd like to try more. The mussels were tasty as was my husband's zucchini salad.Reasons I can't give it a 5:1. My 'would be' amazing grilled watermelon salad had seeds in it. Why? I kept chewing on black watermelon seeds, totally ruined it for me. It was so good, but FULL of seeds so I couldn't eat it.2. Also, I kind of liked that the menu is short and written on your table, but I want to know the prices. Sorry, I'd love to order whatever sounds delish, but I also want to know what I'm getting in to. Weird.3. Salt. Too much of it. Most places have problems underseasoning, but the burger we had was like a salt lick, so were the fries (but that was ok). Easy on the salt. I'll be back, liked the vibe a lot and will try the steak with the bone marrow butter next time.",3.0
"I just don't know how they do it. It's just so good. I wish I lived closer so I could go here more often. Brunch is amazing, but dinner is as well. I still have dreams about the velvety sweet potato puree alongside an expertly cooked steak. Between that puree and the consumee we started with, there was hours and hours of work on the plate. It can be somewhat difficult to remember the menu since it's dicated and only the main ingredient of each is scribbled onto the table. Our waitress was very sweet though and was happy to repeat the dishes to us.",5.0
"So I ordered the burger medium-well, which, I know, is a very gauche burger order. That said, it wasn't terrible but was no Father's Office burger and I'm sure cost more (though you'd never know since there are no fucking prices listed). But this brings me to my real complaint: the waitress laughed at me. Not just laughed, heckled me for my burger order (which is due to an experience I had with undercooked meat recently). Let me go on. The whole ridiculous gimmick with the writing of the menu on the table is simply an excuse for one of these American Apparel glad bitches to shove her tits in the face of all men folk at the table. She was rude to me (the only female) so such an extent that even the men I was with noticed it.

"It's amazing to come to a restaurant each time expecting a different menu of the best, freshest, seasonal ingredients and have most dishes range from good to wonderful. There is no point describing individual dishes because they are not on the menu anymore. And that's the fun of it.The flavors and interesting combination of ingredients are even more impressive knowing that the Chef has only a few days to a week to come up with each particular dish. Chapeau!",4.0
"I joined Diner for lunch today, along with a lot of other seemingly happy people. First off hands down, the service was fantastic. Everyone was super nice. The host made sure that even though we were still waiting for one more person to come and it was getting crowded he always kept us posted and didn't forget about us at the bar. The bartender was super nice and made me a virgin bloody mary. The waitress although was busy took the time to chat a little with us and she seemed super sweet too. I'm really impressed with that first off because a nice friendly staff really adds to the meal. I like the writing on the table of the specials. I like the verbal descriptions of the menu and then there is the food. Super fast service. I had the mussels, they were devine. The french fries, amazing! Plus i dig my fries with mayo.  Boyfriend had the burger and he said it was the best. I also thought the fried fish sandwich looked fantastic. Overall experience was fantastic!",5.0
"Great comforting food tarnished by long waits and spotty service. Things are cramped inside the trendy refurbished diner - the drinks are strong and so is the smell of pretentiousness. This place would easily be 4 stars if it weren't for the fact that I feel like I'm constantly craning my neck to get a refill of water. The food itself is very good - their rotating menu changes often assuming seasonality and availability of produce, which keeps the meals hearty yet somewhat healthy-tasting.",3.0
"My first NYC review! After seeing this on ""No Reservations"" I was pumped to try this place. Let me preface by saying, I want to give it a 5, but just can't. Reasons for deserving a 5-:1. Love, love the decor, totally awesome old diner with a very Brooklyn vibe to it (if I even know what that means yet). You won me on ambience alone. 2. Service was also fantastic, our server was very nice, friendly and attentive but not annoying, perfect. 3. Nice menu- everything sounds good and interesting, I'd like to try more. The mussels were tasty as was my husband's zucchini salad.Reasons I can't give it a 5:1. My 'would be' amazing grilled watermelon salad had seeds in it. Why? I kept chewing on black watermelon seeds, totally ruined it for me. It was so good, but FULL of seeds so I couldn't eat it.2. Also, I kind of liked that the menu is short and written on your table, but I want to know the prices. Sorry, I'd love to order whatever sounds delish, but I also want to know what I'm getting in to. Weird.3. Salt. Too much of it. Most places have problems underseasoning, but the burger we had was like a salt lick, so were the fries (but that was ok). Easy on the salt. I'll be back, liked the vibe a lot and will try the steak with the bone marrow butter next time.",3.0
"I just don't know how they do it. It's just so good. I wish I lived closer so I could go here more often. Brunch is amazing, but dinner is as well. I still have dreams about the velvety sweet potato puree alongside an expertly cooked steak. Between that puree and the consumee we started with, there was hours and hours of work on the plate. It can be somewhat difficult to remember the menu since it's dicated and only the main ingredient of each is scribbled onto the table. Our waitress was very sweet though and was happy to repeat the dishes to us.",5.0
"So I ordered the burger medium-well, which, I know, is a very gauche burger order. That said, it wasn't terrible but was no Father's Office burger and I'm sure cost more (though you'd never know since there are no fucking prices listed). But this brings me to my real complaint: the waitress laughed at me. Not just laughed, heckled me for my burger order (which is due to an experience I had with undercooked meat recently). Let me go on. The whole ridiculous gimmick with the writing of the menu on the table is simply an excuse for one of these American Apparel glad bitches to shove her tits in the face of all men folk at the table. She was rude to me (the only female) so such an extent that even the men I was with noticed it.

At first we thought it was the onions that was making it salty, but it was the actual meat itself.  The fries were good, although heavily salted.Afterwards, all we wanted was something SWEET to even out the bitter/salty foods!  AND it was pretty dang expensive. $7 soup plus $15ish omlette.....

"I had a friend who used to live a block away from Diner. And whenever I visited her (and I did quite often), I'd always ask about the place. It always has a line, and had a reputation to be quite a good place to eat.She has since moved away from the neighborhood, but my curiosity with the restaurant stayed.In a recent trip to show a friend around New York, I made it a point to head here for dinner. It was a Sunday, and we arrived just in time before the place got packed.The place is a delight with its jab at a diner--where you would expect huge portions of comfort food, but instead serves really delicious sit-down-restaurant-type food.The staff were a little distant, but I believe it's because we were new (and this is New York we're talking about after all). It took them a while--remember, we were here before the place got filled--to ask us for a beverage (their wine selection seems good, but my friend didn't want to drink that night so I only got a glass), introduce us to the evening's menu, and take our order. I got the pasta to start, and the chicken as my entree. My friend skipped the starters and went for the steak. It took the restaurant a curious amount of time to bring out the food. They weren't cold, so that means it wasn't forgotten, but at the same time, I wondered what happened in the kitchen.The food was great. Most definitely not diner-quality food, but also not overly high-brow as to intimidate. The pasta was light and well-cooked, and portioned just right. My friend thoroughly enjoyed the steak (the butcher shop next door, after all, is also owned by the same people), and I swooned with the chicken. It was fall-of-the bone lovely. (Yes, I said ""lovely"" to describe food.) All in all, I certainly would be coming back the next time I cross the bridge once again. (And I'm sure that won't take long.)",4.0

"My husband and I visited NYC to see the Tim Burton Retrospective at MoMA. I admit I came here because of the mention in Anthony Bourdain's No Reservation's episode on the 5 Burroughs.  The sell for me was the bone marrow butter.  We arrived early, ~6PM, which  is early for most people, but we like to indulge, so an earlier dinner gives us a chance to walk off a big meal.Very rarely do I care about atmosphere, but I loved the vibe here.  Despite the cramped space, dark room, and long wait if you get there later, the dining experience was perfectly low-key.  I absolutely loved their indie music catalog.The menu is small.  The wait staff scribbles the menu on the table.  We wanted to order everything but settled for about half of the items.As starters we had the pork rillettes served with crostini, mustard green salad, and fennel soup finished with smoked trout.  All the appetizers were great, but the fennel soup was *phenomenal*: creamy and smooth with a smoky finish.  Unreal. As if the appetizers weren't enough, we also ordered the porterhouse steak with bone marrow butter.  The steak came with french fries and watercress salad.  It was a meal in itself, plenty enough for 2 people.  If we were thinking about waistlines we should not have ordered the starters, but hell, we were on vacation and there to eat!  We didn't waist a thing.  All was eaten clean except perhaps a few fries that I reluctantly left behind.To top off the big meal we ordered for dessert the brown butter cake.  Even on full bellies we devoured every last morsel. This was hands-down my favorite meal during our visit, and one I'll longingly want to experience again.",5.0
"I like everything about this place.  The food (especially the steak/meats) are always awesome.  Same owners as Marlow & Sons (around the corner) and the late, great michelada paradise of the South Side, Bonita.I do believe they are quite conscious about getting all of their meat and produce from local farms, which is great.  Service is usually decent, but if it's crowded, expect to wait a little while (not a shock, right?)I would eat just about anything on the menu that changes nightly and is written down on your table by your server.  I recommend it all.It can definitely be on the pricier side though.  I tthink a bill (with tip and drinks (and drinks) and wine and a little more wine) could end up between $80 and $90 per person.They also have a nice little outdoor area.",5.0

"Just came here for brunch on Sunday.  The brunch menu was great!  They have a seasonal menu as well as some typical favorites.  I had the Country Breakfast with a mimosa.  My husband and friend who recommended we come here had the Rabbit Hash and a beer/mimosa.  We also ordered the donut holes.  The donut holes came first and where pretty good.  After I had one I realized I should have ordered coffee!  So I saved the rest for after we finish our main dishes.  My Country breakfast came with perfectly made scrambled eggs, very tasty wild spinach and biscuits w/gravy.  The only thing I had to comment on was the biscuits were a little on the hard side but other than that it was AMAZING!  The hubby didn't want to share the Rabbit hash so i'm assuming it was great also!  I would have never knew about this place unless a friend suggested we go!  It was definitely a great find for me and would definitely come back!  The dinner menu sounds amazing also!",5.0
"Great food, very interesting menu.  The food changes often and keep sup with the season.  Some seems to even be farm fresh.  Great selections.

"Folks only read the bad reviews, but here's an exceptionally positive one.I remember stumbling in on a lark for brunch.  I ended up somehow with the rabbit terrine served (as it should) with grilled country bread, pickles and mustard.  Hands down some of the best terrine I've had the pleasure of eating.  How often is terrine or any forcemeat for that matter this memorable?  The dinner service is as delicious, as it is crowded--I like going for lunch on off-days instead, sitting bar-side, ordering the daily variation a on tuna fish or whitefish salad with a cold-brew coffee.  Light, delicious, a bit oily (again as it should be), total perfection.  The service always seems way more professional than anyone in cut-offs should be capable of--I've yet to experience any overt rudeness or inattention after twenty or so meals here.  Maybe I'm lucky?",5.0
"I had a friend who used to live a block away from Diner. And whenever I visited her (and I did quite often), I'd always ask about the place. It always has a line, and had a reputation to be quite a good place to eat.She has since moved away from the neighborhood, but my curiosity with the restaurant stayed.In a recent trip to show a friend around New York, I made it a point to head here for dinner. It was a Sunday, and we arrived just in time before the place got packed.The place is a delight with its jab at a diner--where you would expect huge portions of comfort food, but instead serves really delicious sit-down-restaurant-type food.The staff were a little distant, but I believe it's because we were new (and this is New York we're talking about after all). It took them a while--remember, we were here before the place got filled--to ask us for a beverage (their wine selection seems good, but my friend didn't want to drink that night so I only got a glass), introduce us to the evening's menu, and take our order. I got the pasta to start, and the chicken as my entree. My friend skipped the starters and went for the steak. It took the restaurant a curious amount of time to bring out the food. They weren't cold, so that means it wasn't forgotten, but at the same time, I wondered what happened in the kitchen.The food was great. Most definitely not diner-quality food, but also not overly high-brow as to intimidate. The pasta was light and well-cooked, and portioned just right. My friend thoroughly enjoyed the steak (the butcher shop next door, after all, is also owned by the same people), and I swooned with the chicken. It was fall-of-the bone lovely. (Yes, I said ""lovely"" to describe food.) All in all, I certainly would be coming back the next time I cross the bridge once again. (And I'm sure that won't take long.)",4.0

"The interior is an interesting take on an old dingy diner one would find on some off road in the middle of nowhere or in a Tarantino movie.  I would be a lot more impressed if not every single restaurant in Williamsburg opted to look like that, there is really only so many mason jars, mismatched furniture and dark lighting you can take in one neighborhood before they star to look the same.  The food always ranges from very very good to good. The menu changes seasonally (may be even more often) and while the more brave and forward choices like bone marrow with fried okra are a hit or miss (too salty in my opinion) and the New Orleans style gumbo, which was a little too bland, you won't go wrong with something safer.  For instance the Braised Chicken and Quinoa with vegetables served on top of a slightly salted yogurt, was nothing short of incredible.The desserts deserve a separate nod, as they are almost all very good. The plum and apple gallette with mascarpone was light and airy and delicious. The service is the usual hipster, slightly less than helpful, ""i'm just doing this for now"" attitude i've come to expect of Williamsburg, but that's nothing new.

"I know next to nothing about where to find good restaurants in brooklyn.  Call me a snob, call me whatever you want, call it a drawback of living in manhattan but I was lucky to find out about this place when I went with some friends who live in Williamsburg.My friend and his wife had selected this place after dining around various NYC places during restaurant week.  We were all looking for something nice, but a little low key as it had been a while since I had gotten to see them and wanted to chat without having to fight over the noise of a busy restaurant. I can only speak for the dinner aspect, but the whole concept here is that the restaurant exists in an old style diner with an emphasis on fresh and a daily changing menu.  If you look online you'll see a very very basic/small consistent menu, but the magic is in the specials which I'll get to later.We showed up early, at 6pm and were seated without quickly without a reservation.   Took a little bit of time for our server to come by but not long enough where it was annoying.  Having worked in restaurants before I tend to be a little bit anal about this kind of thing.As I mentioned previously, the magic is in the specials.   Unlike a traditional restaurant where a server rattles off maybe a few dishes and you're left trying to remember what he said, this place does an excellent job of presenting the various dishes.  Our server whipped out his pen and carefully wrote down the various salads, apps, and entrees on the paper that was laid out covering the table.  In addition to this, he also named a lot of ingredients that went into each dish.  By the time he was done I'd say there were well over 12 things on the paper which was pretty impressive.I settled on the black sea bass as I had consumed a late lunch and was looking for something relatively light.  My friend ordered the burger medium rare and I can't remember what his wife ordered.All of our dishes were cooked perfectly.  His burger was slightly on the rare side, just the way he mentioned he had liked it.  My fish was also perfect and went well with the bok choy it was served over.  It had been deboned so no need to worry there.After we finished, our plates sat for a considerable amount of time before someone other then our server cleared them.  At this point the restaurant was defintely busy, but not overly crowded so I understand how it happened.  The only downsides that we really experienced was service that was good but not lights out.  Also when writing down the various specials, no price is mentioned so if you're concerned make sure to ask.  My fish was $26 dollars which is on par for a nice restaurant, but still would have liked to know before hand.I'd come back here for sure.  Also makes a cool little date spot for someone not in the area.",4.0
"I came here for brunch recently- their menu is quite varied. This place kind of represents your Williamsburg hipster in it's own little way. The exterior of the restaurant certainly looks different, the interior as well. Similar to a hipster- the tight pants, oversized glasses, flanel shirt. The brunch menu has some recognizable dishes such as pancakes, eggs, or burgers, (i.e the plain white shirt you might see them wearing) but it also has some unique items as well- sordfish crostini, chocolate sandwich, honey custard (i.e the bright green or red pants). I was leaning towards the chocolate sandwich but ended up going for the swordfish crostini which was an open-faced sandwich with a sordfish-mayo-like salad on top and some deliciously zesty greens on the side. The honey custard tasted like smooth-custardy HONEY in a bowl. Can't complain about that either. With this level of creativity I can only image what kind of unique/delicious items must be on their dinner menu. I haven't actually seen the No Reservations episodes that took place here, but have certainly heard about it. I might just move to Williamsburg and start wearing flanel after this meal. Was a unique brunch with plenty of options for my non-egg-eating self.",4.0

Favorites were roasted carrots with sunchoke puree, pork rillette with pickled vegetables and toast, string bean salad with shallot vin, mint, sungolds, pickled egg and aged goat cheese (I'm a sucker for goat cheese).Desserts were also great.

I think that there were only around 4 things on the menu but I'm sure each one was tasty. I enjoyed the fsh sandwich. Even though it was a fried fish sandwich, it was incredibly light and crispy.

"Deliciousness.Came here on a Sunday evening with a friend for dinner. I was anticipating a long wait, but we were lucky and were seated immediately around 6:45/7ish before the crowds really came. The dining car is AWESOME. It looks tiny and strange from the outside, like it belongs somewhere else. Inside, it is cozy and dim and really really cool.Our waitress was great. They write the menu on the tablecloth/paper as they explain to you each dish. I liked  that approach, especially since I love to hear about each dish on a menu anyway. However, since they don't write the prices down, it feels awkward to ask, because it seems like they assume you can afford whatever they make. But not writing the prices down keeps the menu focused on the food. I see both sides.My friend and I decided to share several starters and one entree. We had a spinach salad with egg, fresh herbs and fried scallions. I know that sounds ridiculously simple, but it was so fresh tasting, it was probably my highlight. Also had fluke crudo with beets, grapefruit and radish. Awesome! The fettucine with lobster, clam and bacon in a spicy tomato sauce was not as good as I had hoped - it definitely was not spicy. But the flavors were well blended and the noodles tasted fresh. We split a burger. It was great. Not the best burger ever, but you get your $14 worth. I liked the horseradish mustard a lot. And the fries were well made.We had a seasonal beer on tap - I think it was Geary's Winter ale? It tasted like Christmas. It was really tasty - dark and malty with bright spicy flavors. It was the cherry on top of the meal, so to speak.We didn't indulge in dessert, since I was in the mood for something light. Though the Earl Grey pot de creme sounded really good. Two beers, 2 starters, a small plate of pasta and the entree ran us around $80 total, which was not bad at all. Great food and atmosphere!",4.0

The place looked like a car taken from an old train.....a really old run-down train though. So the 45 minute wait for bunch was worth it.....Only after we found out that there was more to the regular menu!

We finally decided on getting the chicken sandwich with egg whites and a pear aioli, the burger, and a chocolate scone. The chicken sandwich was fantastic! OMG I loved the fries...I loved how they were super crunchy which was almost like the texture of potato chips. There was this amazing red wine vinegar pickled onion on the burger, which took the burger to the next level! Wow! That was genius! Then there was the scone....they spread nutella and creme fresh in the middle of this scrumptious piece of baked good.

I was dumbfounded the first time I tried it and couldn't get enough.2007 - a dark year. No more cinnamon toast and the Kedgeree didn't go over so well so you took it off the menu. I think you were ahead of your time, so don't take it too hard.2008 - We didn't see a lot of each other. I think we had grown apart and just needed some time to figure things out.2009 - I had been thinking about you a lot and wanted to see if there was still a spark.

We did start with a grilled cantaloupe salad, it was great; simple, fresh, and seasonal. my companion thought it was awesome, a raving review from someone who has never had grilled cantaloupe. And then there was the burger... sin cheese, med-rare... it was delicious! good bun, perfectly done, simple toppings, good house made mayo (if that's your thing) Only thing I would do differently next time is add the cheese...I'm very confused why its just not on the menu with cheese, but oh well...I'm not really sure where to rank it but its worth the trip to s. williamsburg...at least once:) Although, I may have to check out diner for their other offerings in the future - everything looked/smelled delicious!",4.0

"Went for a late lunch with DH and grandma and had a nice time - music was a little loud, but that's fine. Their target audience is early 20s hipsters - I'm almost 30 and decidedly un-hip.All 3 of us went for the burgers were great. Definitely not the best burger I've ever had in my life, but you could taste the high quality of the beef used to make it. Minus 1 star for a very limited menu.

"I went to Diner for brunch with a few family members. Judging by food alone, I would give it 5 stars--the frittata was absolutely amazing, with eggplant and whipped goat cheese.

"Went here for brunch on New Year's Day, great food GREAT bloody mary. It was really busy, our service was great. I'll go back. I had country breakfast, eggs, biscuits and gravy- awesome. The fries were the bomb. the burgers looked wonderful, i'll go back for one of those.",4.0
"I moved to Williamsburg shortly after Diner first opened (incidentally, a block away).  Restaurant-wise, it was slim-pickins: the L Cafe, the Grey Parrot, Bliss, and Planet Thai, basically.  While exploring, I spied that green awning, drew in for a closer look, and after my first meal I was hooked.It's a love affair that has outlasted 3 boyfriends, and 5 apartments, and spanned 3 cities over 2 continents.Diner has always been the best, and continues to be.Why?  Because they just do food right.  Their specialty is taking seasonal, mostly familiar ingredients, and combining and preparing them in ways that really showcase the best of their flavors and textures.  Nothing is thrown in there because it's trendy.  There is no experimentation for experimentation's sake.  Their dishes offer different perspectives on ingredients we love, often while introducing new ones-  all while remaining completely approachable.  So much of what I have learned about food and wine (and especially cheese), has been because of what I have eaten here.And yes, their burger and fries are extremely good.",5.0

"This is hands down my favorite restaurant ever.The wait can be long sometimes but it is well worth it.  The menu is changing every day to accomodate what's fresh, and I've never had a meal that was anything less than one of my best meals ever.  Can never resist the french fries, dare I say they are the best I've ever had?  And that's coming from a french fry snob...The pork chop, when they have it, is always amazing no matter how it's prepared.  And the cheeseburger, which you can get every day, is my favorite burger in NYC.  Brunch is fabulous, dinner is wonderful, by far my favorite place in Brooklyn.Great place to take foodie out of towners, parents, friends....anyone and everyone.LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.",5.0
"Absolutely stellar restaurant.  We actually started around the corner at Marlow&Sons for a drink and a dozen oysters.Our menu:Paparadelle Dragon bean saladHalibut - mint and crisp peasPork chop with eggplant and squash vinegar dressingALL of it was top-notch.  The room was supercool.  I would gladly come back over and over, especially starting off around the corner for more Morlowe and Sons oyster bar.",5.0
"Solid 4 stars. Truth be told I went for the burger (a friend of mine and I are kind of on a mission) and I was NOT disappointed.... unlike with the Minetta burger. I was pleasantly surprised with the menu - changing seasonally, I ALMOST decided the ditch the burger plan and try something else. We did start with a grilled cantaloupe salad, it was great; simple, fresh, and seasonal. my companion thought it was awesome, a raving review from someone who has never had grilled cantaloupe. And then there was the burger... sin cheese, med-rare... it was delicious! good bun, perfectly done, simple toppings, good house made mayo (if that's your thing) Only thing I would do differently next time is add the cheese...I'm very confused why its just not on the menu with cheese, but oh well...I'm not really sure where to rank it but its worth the trip to s. williamsburg...at least once:) Although, I may have to check out diner for their other offerings in the future - everything looked/smelled delicious!",4.0
"I have eaten at Diner dozens of times and have always taken for granted how great of a restaurant it is. The daily specials are seasonal and done well and their regular menu items are always good. Try diner for one of the best burgers in the city or if you are in the mood for fancy food, their specials will not disappoint. Be sure to start off with a few drinks, their bartenders are great.",4.0

"Went for a late lunch with DH and grandma and had a nice time - music was a little loud, but that's fine. Their target audience is early 20s hipsters - I'm almost 30 and decidedly un-hip.All 3 of us went for the burgers were great. Definitely not the best burger I've ever had in my life, but you could taste the high quality of the beef used to make it. Minus 1 star for a very limited menu.

"By the order of their appearance here are my impressions on this place:1) we walked by it one weekend day and saw a bunch of people waiting. My feeling was : something interesting must be happening in this seemingly uninteresting place.2) one Saturday night we met an acquaintance whose boyfriend lives in the  neighborhood and who, after asking us where we had been, said this was the best place to eat in Williamsburg.3) we decide to go and we enter the place on a Saturday evening, somewhat late. It was clear from the first moment - the place is affluent in pretentiousness: intentionally unintentional. The crowd I'd say was similarly intentionally unintentional. The waiter writes down the plates of the day on the paper table cloth. Attention here - no prices ;)4)  we order a salad and an entree each: one was chicken something, the other lamb-asparagus-something. The salad was delicious, amazing I can say. Both of our entrees amazing as well - delicious, well made and most importantly prepared from extremely carefully picked meat! I think I haven't eaten better lamb in New York. I wonder where he got it from.  But, be aware !!! the chef, as much as he is good in choosing the right ingredients and cooking them just perfectly,y has one little but important problem - I think he has salt-sensing deficiency! Both our entrees were very, very, very salty! Might have this been only on this specific evening? I don't know, perhaps, or I hope. I hope, because there was no real reason to cover the food with salt since the meat was so obviously fresh and good anyway.5) oh, and we saw a rather famous musician sitting at the bar6) finally, the check revealed to us that one of the entrees was seriously overpriced. For this hidden little trap and for the over-salting thing, I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars.",4.0

"Oh, Diner. I had such high expectations for you. I had heard about your Bloody Marys and your burger. How it was the stuff of legend.I had also heard about the ridiculously long wait, so I ventured there on a Sunday afternoon ... brunch time.I walked in with my dining companion and noticed most seats were full, save a few spots at the bar. Not ever having been there before, we stood in the doorway and waited for someone to take our names for the waiting list or direct us to a table. And we waited. And waited. Several employees walked by for several minutes before one girl (who had already passed us a handful of times) stopped and mumbled, ""Would you like a table?""She jotted down our names and directed us to the bar to wait. I was eager to try the Bloody Mary, but the bartender chose to basically ignore us. We were confused ... we were sitting there, being attentive, not looking away or consumed in smartphone use. Why were we not being served drinks? Too busy chatting with the regulars at the bar and taking shots with them? That's cool and all, I love a laid-back bartender, but if you could swing by and ask if I wanted anything -- even just offering a drink menu -- that would be ideal.A couple who came in after us were seated before us. Just as we were about to open our mouths to complain, we were led to a table.We barely looked at the menus. Two grass-fed burgers, medium rare, with cheese, please. And oh yes, the Bloody Marys. And a Coke for my friend.The Bloody Marys came out promptly ... and left something to be desired. I am a voracious consumer of Bloody Marys and I seriously can't ascertain what the hype was about. It tasted painfully underseasoned. My friend never got his Coke.But oh my god, the burger. The burger was everything I wanted and more. How often do you order a burger medium rare and it actually comes out medium rare? But this was cooked PERFECTLY, buttery, lightly seasoned, tasting more like steak than ground beef. My mouth is watering as I type this. Sweet lord that burger is absolute perfection.When the check came, we asked to take the Coke off, since we had never gotten it. Our waitress stared at us for a minute, then looked at our table. No, there is no empty glass there. Please just take it off the tab.Anyway. Service = awful (and it wasn't even that crowded!), food = transcendent. I will be back for that burger. Hopefully the service will be better.",3.0

This place has been around about 10 yrs.The interior of feeling like inside of a Tin can and the retro deco is pretty cool. I like the marblish walls in the side room.My visits have not been that frequent as many in the past, these days but, whenever I have visitors from out of area/town, I take them there.

"As I waited for my dinner companion, I sat at the bar and started with a wet martini - a great drink that I will order again. I love gin. And the expected ambiance of neighborhood loafers hanging from the rafters was quickly downplayed by the lovely fact that the tables were more empty than filled. I could enjoy my drink in peace without any pretense.After hearing stories of long waits, we decided to go early [7pm or before] on a weekday  - a wise choice. Once we were half way into our food, the restuarant really picked up and became very loud and more crowded.Now on to the food - for starters, we ordered the acorn squash tempura as well as the flatbreads with homemade merguez sausage, served along a few stewed carrots and a yogurt sauce.The acorn squash was delictable - served perfectly hot. Perfectly crispy and airy - and the squash pieces were smooth and buttery, retaining their structural integrity. The merquez was spiced well. The flatbreads were way over salted, but at least it was good salt. Second came the steak [the larger cut of the two] - so we shared. It was perfectly cooked medium rare. It was incredibly buttery and delicious, a real pleasure to eat. I guess grassfed cows that are butched the same day are the way to go.Great service. Flavorful food. I'll definitely return, but only before 7pm on weekdays.",4.0
"I was explaining to my students how to give a proper opinion. Not an easy task because there are so many avenues into the enterprise. I've only eaten here once, but the burger was enough that I have used that example years later. I was relating to them that the opinion is based upon your expectations up to that point. So a lot of previous experiences with the subject impact the moment of encounter: previous burgers from cookouts, your own attempts, fastfood forays at four in the morning, an inundation of advertisements, opinions of others...schema. So my opinion of the burger experience is based upon the amount of care and thought evidenced by my past and present experiences. I described to them how the true burger experience is not about the fanfare of sauces and garnish, but the burger itself. That any true burger has the fanfare built into the patty itself. Seasoned properly and grilled properly. The effect is putting down the burger to ""chew"". Chewing should be an experience in itself because you are aware. Artwork gets you to do that, be aware of the moment. I held that first bite in my mouth as long as I could. Then looked down at my plate pleased with the knowledge that I had a lot of these little moments left to go. So powerful that I remember it vividly years later.",4.0

"May I discuss my love for Diner?  It's perhaps my favorite brunch spot.  The changing daily menu, the local and seasonal produce, the waiters' knowledge on the food they're serving and its provenance provides a dining experience that is difficult to find anywhere else.  This is not to mention the quality of the ingredients, which is unparalleled, or the obvious care that goes into the preparation of every meal.  My potatoes, for example, were cooked in slivered leeks, taragon, and baby rosemary and was perfectly balanced.  My omlette was cooked and folded perfectly and filled with grilled corn, caramelized red onion, and grilled jalapeno with cheddar that was bursting with flavor.  My bloody mary was very spicy, though not very strong alcohol-wise.  My dining partner's chickory salad with a poached and then batter-fried egg (whose yolk broke open, making a dressing for the salad) was delicious.Five stars, five stars, five stars.  If you'd like to avoid the lines (which are perilous at any iconic brunch place) I'd recommend showing up before 11, when they open.  There will already be some people waiting, but there are shady benches to rest on.  In such a way, you will avoid having to rank Diner lower in your Yelp review, since that seems to be the basis for many of these 4-star ratings.Abundant love!",5.0

"We used to call this place 4 star diner since when it opened we heard that the owner used worked as a chef in 4 star restaurant/hotels and that's why the foods are so good.  We never checked the fact but foods are indeed exellent and the idea of being out of of no where like right under the Williamsburg bridge definitely added some uniqueness. This place has been around about 10 yrs.The interior of feeling like inside of a Tin can and the retro deco is pretty cool. I like the marblish walls in the side room.My visits have not been that frequent as many in the past, these days but, whenever I have visitors from out of area/town, I take them there. Some who lives in the area do not know about it sometimes so... Quite a pleasant surprise for some.There could be some wait during brunch time on weekends.Highly recommended...",4.0
"As I waited for my dinner companion, I sat at the bar and started with a wet martini - a great drink that I will order again. I love gin. And the expected ambiance of neighborhood loafers hanging from the rafters was quickly downplayed by the lovely fact that the tables were more empty than filled. I could enjoy my drink in peace without any pretense.After hearing stories of long waits, we decided to go early [7pm or before] on a weekday  - a wise choice. Once we were half way into our food, the restuarant really picked up and became very loud and more crowded.Now on to the food - for starters, we ordered the acorn squash tempura as well as the flatbreads with homemade merguez sausage, served along a few stewed carrots and a yogurt sauce.The acorn squash was delictable - served perfectly hot. Perfectly crispy and airy - and the squash pieces were smooth and buttery, retaining their structural integrity. The merquez was spiced well. The flatbreads were way over salted, but at least it was good salt. Second came the steak [the larger cut of the two] - so we shared. It was perfectly cooked medium rare. It was incredibly buttery and delicious, a real pleasure to eat. I guess grassfed cows that are butched the same day are the way to go.Great service. Flavorful food. I'll definitely return, but only before 7pm on weekdays.",4.0
"I was explaining to my students how to give a proper opinion. Not an easy task because there are so many avenues into the enterprise. I've only eaten here once, but the burger was enough that I have used that example years later. I was relating to them that the opinion is based upon your expectations up to that point. So a lot of previous experiences with the subject impact the moment of encounter: previous burgers from cookouts, your own attempts, fastfood forays at four in the morning, an inundation of advertisements, opinions of others...schema. So my opinion of the burger experience is based upon the amount of care and thought evidenced by my past and present experiences. I described to them how the true burger experience is not about the fanfare of sauces and garnish, but the burger itself. That any true burger has the fanfare built into the patty itself. Seasoned properly and grilled properly. The effect is putting down the burger to ""chew"". Chewing should be an experience in itself because you are aware. Artwork gets you to do that, be aware of the moment. I held that first bite in my mouth as long as I could. Then looked down at my plate pleased with the knowledge that I had a lot of these little moments left to go. So powerful that I remember it vividly years later.",4.0
"We tried everything on the menu.  The waiter was great and wrote down the daily specials right on the paper tablecloth.  The service was very friendly and quick.  They don't try to rush you out and let you enjoy your meal.We had the pork chops, steak, sea bass, fettucine and chicken.  Everything was delicioso!  We got a trio of desserts and I fell in love with the pumpkin spice cake.  I am going to dream of that cake for at least a month!I am going to make this place a regular go-to.",5.0

"Kind of overrated. Reasons for this:-Tough tough steak: we shared the bistro steak and the half chicken, and the bistro steak was chewy. No, not chewy as in good chewy, but chewy as in it was similar to chewing on rubber. I don't think I could have chewed it enough to down it very easily or well.

The breast was a little on the dry side. And the skin was overly salted. As someone who enjoys and is good at cooking, I will turn my head away and say, no, I could definitely have done this way better.

Foodies paradise!!  This is a tiny place in Williamsburg.  It's right next door to Marlow and sons butcher shop.  We went there for brunch. The place was super crowded but the staff was very helpful in trying to get us seated. We only waited about 5 minutes which was impressive.  The seating is very right which means I was able to follow the hipsters conversations on either side of us. Nonetheless the experience was great. Our waitress wrote the specials on the white paper table cloth.  Nice touch.  And from what I understand the menu changes daily with what is locally fresh.   We started with a sardine app which had Beats mandarin slices with a homemade cream.    Ridic!  My lovely gf had the lobster omelette. Perfectly done. Lobster was plentiful in a nice sauce wrapped by a moist omelette .  Sided with cubed potatoes with made from scratch ketchup.  I had the duck hearts with collard greens over a light egg salad.  the duck hearts were cooked perfectly and the flavor was brain meltingly good.  Highly highly recommended for anyone who appreciates the culinary arts.,5.0

"Really cool place, cool location, low key atmosphere and good lighting.  At first I thought the concept of the waitress writing the menu on our table was a little awkward but she was super cool and really knowledgeable, which made it so hard to choose.  Since the menu changes so often this might be a bit arbitrary, however my friend chose the mussels and fries which smelled great and the fries were cooked well.  I had the half chicken with brussells sprouts and acorn squash.  The chicken was cooked and seasoned perfectly, no complaints there.  I wish I had a few more sprouts and squash though, they were tasty though a little undercooked, there was just such a small portion of them on the plate for the $22 price tag.  We decided to 'splurge' and go for dessert, best idea we had all night.  We got a lemon tart with olive oil and sea salt.  Now, I'm not really a tart person-- give me chocolate or cake any day-- but something was telling me this tart was gonna be bomb, especially since I love a smart addition of sea salt to any dessert.  Well duh, I was right.  This tart might have been my favorite part of the meal.  If it's still on the menu, get it.  All in all, a great meal at Diner that has inspired me to try Marlow and Sons (but next time I'll be sure someone else is payin'),",4.0

"Having read about this place on Yelp I was fully expecting a 30 min wait on Saturday evening.  Arrived a little past 7PM and to my surprise, no wait!  There is a god.  Went over the menu and quickly realized that there was only 1 item - the grass fed burger.  Our fears of no variety were quickly put to ease when the waitress assurred us there were close to 10 specials and she proceeded to write all of it down on our paper table mat.For apps we ordered the chickory salad and the corn on the cob.  The chickory salad came with a fried egg on top and little pieces of braised beef.  This is the most unhealthy best tasting salad I've ever had.  The corn on the cob was fried with tomatoes and watermelon infused butter.  I like.  For our entree I got the steak and fries.  It was topped with a bone marrow sauce and it was really tastey, but the quality of meat was not good.  It was really chewy and me being the lazy person that I am, I started swallowing chunks of steak because I was getting tired of chewing.  The fries were also waaayyy tooo salty.  My dates 1/2 range chicken was reallly good and tasty- flavored with leeks and artichoke.Although my steak was disappointing, the delicious apps and the chicken make up for it.  Due to the ever changing menu I'll be back to try their new stuff - just not the steak.",4.0

"Really cool place, cool location, low key atmosphere and good lighting.  At first I thought the concept of the waitress writing the menu on our table was a little awkward but she was super cool and really knowledgeable, which made it so hard to choose.  Since the menu changes so often this might be a bit arbitrary, however my friend chose the mussels and fries which smelled great and the fries were cooked well.  I had the half chicken with brussells sprouts and acorn squash.  The chicken was cooked and seasoned perfectly, no complaints there.  I wish I had a few more sprouts and squash though, they were tasty though a little undercooked, there was just such a small portion of them on the plate for the $22 price tag.  We decided to 'splurge' and go for dessert, best idea we had all night.  We got a lemon tart with olive oil and sea salt.  Now, I'm not really a tart person-- give me chocolate or cake any day-- but something was telling me this tart was gonna be bomb, especially since I love a smart addition of sea salt to any dessert.  Well duh, I was right.  This tart might have been my favorite part of the meal.  If it's still on the menu, get it.  All in all, a great meal at Diner that has inspired me to try Marlow and Sons (but next time I'll be sure someone else is payin'),",4.0
"Such a great brunch spot. Bloody mary might be the best in town. Staff is good, food is great. Never been there for dinner, but I'm sure the food is excellent. I love the ambiance, vibe and concept. Everyone is pretty laid back, which generally makes for a more enjoyable time.",4.0

"Having read about this place on Yelp I was fully expecting a 30 min wait on Saturday evening.  Arrived a little past 7PM and to my surprise, no wait!  There is a god.  Went over the menu and quickly realized that there was only 1 item - the grass fed burger.  Our fears of no variety were quickly put to ease when the waitress assurred us there were close to 10 specials and she proceeded to write all of it down on our paper table mat.For apps we ordered the chickory salad and the corn on the cob.  The chickory salad came with a fried egg on top and little pieces of braised beef.  This is the most unhealthy best tasting salad I've ever had.  The corn on the cob was fried with tomatoes and watermelon infused butter.  I like.  For our entree I got the steak and fries.  It was topped with a bone marrow sauce and it was really tastey, but the quality of meat was not good.  It was really chewy and me being the lazy person that I am, I started swallowing chunks of steak because I was getting tired of chewing.  The fries were also waaayyy tooo salty.  My dates 1/2 range chicken was reallly good and tasty- flavored with leeks and artichoke.Although my steak was disappointing, the delicious apps and the chicken make up for it.  Due to the ever changing menu I'll be back to try their new stuff - just not the steak.",4.0

"Disappointing.The cold squash soup was refreshing and had fantastic bursts of sharp mint. It would've been delicious were it not for one problem: it was too salty.The komatsuna salad was lemony and littered with halved dark cherries. Too salty.The bluefish, again, was too salty.I really wanted to like this place. I'd come back for brunch, and I'm interested in trying the burger, but I'd be reluctant to come back for dinner.",3.0
"Thank god I found the name of this place. Thank god for yelp. I don't know why I am writing this review now. I ate here about 3 or 4 years ago. But the name of the place was lost to me.

All I remember was eating the best chocolate souffle in a dimly lit traincar on a weekday night, while it snowed outside. I hope this place is the place. But it was amazingly good, and the traincar decor inside was unforgettable. That's all I have to say about this place, only b/c I barely remember it. Hopefully it wasn't just a dream.",5.0
"Went here tonight with the mom, sister and boyfriend combo- I feel like it's sometimes hard to come up with a parental friendly place in Williamsburg that's fun but not too hipster and angsty. Diner is the perfect friendly medium, the food is excellent, if a bit pricey, the service is polite (waiter took time to come over and explain history of the diner when my mom, as predicted, asked the busboy) and at night it becomes so charming and romantic when they light the candles. Great place, want to come back before it gets cold, can't imagine those thin tin walls keep out the draft very well!",5.0
"3.5 stars. Based on the burger alone, I would give this place a 4. But while the other food was good, it wasn't fantastic. The way that the waitress wrote down the menu on the table was cute, but by the time she was listing the entrees my mind began to wander. Is this a gimmick? An effort to save paper? Also, the menus on the website are messed up, as they link to the wrong thing when you click on them. Diner's burger lived up to the rave reviews it got from a former-vegetarian-who-has-seen-the-light friend of mine. White cheddar, pickled onions, and a brioche bun made for a tasty combination. And for half the price of the Minetta burger, it's definitely a more reasonable option. I would definitely come back for it. The gin cocktail I had was good, a little alcoholy tasting, but solid. The flourless chocolate cake I split with my friend was fine, not great. In sum: Burger = Worth a return visit. Everything else = I could do without.",3.0

"I've only been here once, for a late lunch. The menu is limited, but they add to it with lots of specials. I, for one, would rather have a small menu of good stuff than a big, mediocre stereotypical diner menu anyways. That said, I had the burger and fries. They were really really really good.

"Wow!  A very disappointing meal.My husband and I had a lovely lunch here in September.  Dinner in February, however, was a total disappointment.We came with high expectations, and nowhere did our meals measure up.  Our salads were overly greasy and boring.  My main dish featured overly greasy vegetables with uncomplex seasoning and tasteless wild striped bass that was seared rock-hard on the outside with no seasoning whatsoever.  My husband's main dish featured greasy and boringly-seasoned fennel, tender but tasteless and juiceless beef shank, and polenta made decent only because it was literally oozing butter (I can make delicious polenta if I added that much butter, too).  Even the simple desserts were disappointing -- dry muffins, boring mousse, and a flourless chocolate cake that, while tasty, had a flawed, dry, and overly-crumbly texture.To be fair, the staff could not have been more gracious.  I can't remember the last time I complained at a restaurant, but at these prices I felt entitled.  They very generously and with no prompting from me comped us the main courses and the desserts.  They expressed a wish that we return.  I really appreciate the generosity, but we didn't go to Diner to get free food, but GOOD food.We may try them again, but for lunch or brunch.  I don't know if we'll take a chance on another dinner.It pains me to report this, as I do my best to support sustainably produced, locally sourced, and humanely raised food.  Oh well, one less celebratory dinner option for me.",2.0

it has been three weeks since I unexpectedly received a call to meet a friend in Williamsburg.  I had never traveled across the Williamsburg Bridge but my trusty Tom Tom got me there in one piece!  I trust my friend so when we met in front of the Diner I ignored the exterior and realized that i had to keep an open mind as we walked through the door. Amazing that we did not have to wait on a Friday nite but we were pretty early I believe before 6 pm.  The waitress did not have to go any further than the wild alaskan salmon and we both experienced an amazing meal. The salmon was perfectly cooked and the sweet potato puree with the carrots was delicious. As usual my friend's suggestion was spot on and it will be definately worth another trip  over that narrow old bridge again in the very near future!,4.0
"Inked out hipster hotties on the edge of town On the Hasidic side of the Williamsburg Bridge is a grown up, war battered, high end hipster dining hangout that is like that self-made, established thirty something hipster that still acts like the shit but now has the hard won underground following and foodie cred to back it up. Then again, being around that ultra cool grown up on his inked out turf has it's drawbacks.My preppy father from Westchester asked the bartender if they had any Gran Marnier which was greeted with an icy, disdainful stare that screamed, you're not sophisticated or hip enough to enjoy the re-imagined spirits and master minded delicacies that we have to offer. Get lost and go hipster haunt slumming someplace else next time you can't get a reservation at Peter Luger's. The moment my father asked for that Gran Marnier I felt blacklisted from the place and punished for poor taste by mere association. You would think my father asked the waiter what type of Kosher wines they had from the Rothschild estate. If I was a Hasidic Jew, I'd hide my face underneath my big furry black hat until the silent scolding session was over after my father ordered the house Sangiovese instead. I only know this from wine sales but Sangiovese is the grape they use in Chianti but don't expect to ask for a Chianti not a Sangiovese at the bar without being silently sneered and scolded on the spot. Williamsburg represents a new legion of butcher teaching  chef owners that set up their inspired cooking movements there so they could serve their deconstructionist, do it yourself, dressed down nerdy counterparts while giving the f-you to restaurant dress codes, reservations, menus and dusty old French relics like Gran Marnier.   But feeling downsized and downgraded by a bartender in Williamsburg is an official greeting that you get for playing tourist in their territory.  Menus don't exist here and I don't know how often the chefs mix it up but based on the diverse selection of specials offered to us it seems as varied as Jack White's record collection. Now rattling off specials in place of menus has been done before but watching my cute, worn living waitress scribble down the title of each appetizer and entree after each mention on top of the paper place mat with a broken off number two pencil was definitely a cool, welcome first for me. It wasn't good penmanship either which you noticed as she wrote them down which forced me to mentally latch on to dishes when she first described them before I'd get lost making out the scribbled names that seemed forced for spoon fed sake. For my appetizer I got the asparagus spears bathed in hollandaise and fried up shallots that resembled mini onion rings which was has ruined regular onion rings for me forever. I ordered Goat which was served like two lamb chops except more bone and even less meat with a Salsa Verde on the side. The Salsa Verde was a nice springy condiment that added some nice zesty crunch to the smoky, veal chop sweet goat meat. The goat meat appreciated the complimenting coating yet it came off as an excessive accessory.  Despite the goat portions being small and the big bone in the middle that was frustrating to cut around like the crowd on the 7 train at Queensborough Plaza, I'd order this dish again and again. Holding my goat chop by the bone and digging my teeth into that sweet tinged, smooth ruffled, weighty, charred bite of Goat meat made roasted leg of lamb and dark turkey things suddenly seem downright boring in comparison. Overall I was impressed with the quality of food, creative preparation and the restaurant 's commitment to reinventing what a fine dining experience in New York can be. This dining experience forces most New Yorkers that don't live in Williamsburg outside of their dining comfort zone which shakes up the senses and opens you up to a cooler more present now that's still unmistakably forward thinking all at the same time. Scruffy posturing is a minor drawback when you realize that chef owners that run Diner or Marlow and Sons on the edge of town are serious artists that just don't have the time to kiss ass and be nice if you're not fighting for the home team and I can accept that.  Restaurants like Diner have added gritty sexy allure to these outskirts of Williamsburg and built a rock and roll following that's more kick ass punk than Indy Rock. And how lucky are New Yorkers that live in Brooklyn or Queens like myself that get to enjoy such a radically altered, palate elevating experience on a Saturday Night without having to make a reservation or see one banking douche-bag in sight that won't scare away all of those scantily clad, toned, inked out , French wine sipping, blond hipster hotties at the edge of the bar that come ready to rumble?",4.0

"I'm pretty disappointed with the direction Diner has headed.  I'm pretty much over it.  I've been eating there for over 10 years, and it was once my hands-down favorite.  I first went in for a weekend brunch.  We were seated right away.  I liked that it was funky, fun, tasty and cheap, and that they were playing Let It Bleed pretty loud, even though I don't usually like loud music in restaurants.  The prices have risen sharply over the years, with some entrees going up to the 30 dollar range and steaks even more expensive.  Yeah, they butcher their own cow and use the eyeballs to moisten the salad dressing and the salad is grown in the same cow's manure, but who really cares?  It's certainly not a better steak than Luger's across the street, and the price is comparable.  They now have stores and blogs and cookbooks and fan clubs, but I don't see any real improvement to the food.  If anything, I think it's gone downhill.  I took a friend from out of town there for the burger recently.  It's an expensive burger, but I still felt good about ordering it as it was truly one of New York's best in my mind, if not on many top burgers lists.  This time, the burger was saltier than ever (it was always pretty salty), not very juicy, and the fries (which were also always pretty intense) were practically burned and seasoned to death.I had a lot of great dates at Diner in the past.  The food, the cool atmosphere, and the company all combined to create a truly memorable, almost sublime experience, all for around 60-75 bucks.  I had steaks, fish, and pasta dishes that blew my mind.  The beer, wine, and cocktails were reasonably priced as well.  I felt a kinship with the waitstaff.  That we were similar people interested in similar things.  We would chat and enjoy each others' company.  Not so anymore.  Now it's just a bunch of poseurs with attitude acting like they're cooler than you and can't be bothered to deal with you.  I also once found the practice of writing all the specials on the paper table cloth endearing, but now it is somewhat tedious and awkward, especially if you don't feel like ordering any of the specials after they've been lengthily explained to you.  Since the writing of each is in shorthand, you can't remember crucial details and have to ask them to repeat some information later, which annoys the servers.  I love the idea of a daily menu, but I think a printed version is necessary.It seems like the clientele has changed a lot over the years too.  They all seem like jerks from Manhattan or the new frat boy contingent of Williamsburgers now.  It's a downright expensive place to eat, and you're sitting in a pretty non-fancy environment, especially if you get stuck in the back, which is a loud, claustrophobic nightmare.  Brunch is still a good value, but I've walked out many more times than I've stuck around to eat.  It's just too crowded, hectic, and annoying.",2.0

"Diner is one of favorite places in Williamsburg.  Scratch that...it's one of my favorite restaurants in all of NY.  Scratch that again...it's one of my favorite places anywhere.  In fact, Diner is one of the reasons why I decided to move to NY, many, many, many years ago.  I was strolling through Williamsburg with a friend of mine, late at night, it was pouring outside, and we stumbled in here, and it blew my mind.  There we were, in an old, falling down diner car, listening to Interpol & Tricky interspersed with some old school soul classics, drinking Martinis, surrounded by good looking people in their 20's having a good time.  Cool decor?  Check.  Cool music, better than anything you'd hear at any restaurant/bar in Boston at the time?  Check.  No big screen televisions showing sports, totally ruining the ambience?  Check.  Better looking patrons than those in Boston?  Check.  Better food, with far less pretension than anything I ever experienced in Boston?  Double-check.At that moment, I remember uttering under my breath, ""why the hell am I not moving here?""  ...and about 2 months later I did so.But enough about me...let's get back to Diner.  As everyone else has mentioned, the burgers are to die for.  As are the french fries.  They're so good that when friends come in from out of town to visit, Diner is usually our first stop, and they leave a fan as well.  The specials can be a little bit hit or miss, but I've never had anything bad at Diner...just the occasional meal that was only so-so (which still means that it's a better meal at a more reasonable price than you'll find most places.  Everything's relative).I'm hesitant to give them 5 stars for two main reasons.  One is that I used to find their seasonal cocktail offerings to be charming.  Nowadays I find it kind of annoying.  Just as I hone in on a certain cocktail and decide ""this is what I'll drink when I come here"" the menu changes, and I'm back at square one.  And Two, the prices have gone up (but then, prices have gone up everywhere...especially in Williamsburg).  I don't find Diner to be as reasonably priced as it used to be.  It's still worth what they charge...it just takes a larger bite out of the wallet is all.",4.0

"This is our GO TO brunch spot!! Basically every weekend my roommates and friends in the building crush Diner for a late Sunday morning/early afternoon meal.  It always starts with a 15-20 minute wait at-least to compensate our unusual 4-6 person party we come in with consistently.  The staff is always overwhelmed because the place is not meant for parties above 4 really.  There is one great spot in the back for 4-6 but only really one spot for over 4 people.  But off the back large bloody mary's and coffee is attained at the bar while we wait for our selected booth/table.  The bloody mary's are loved by all my companions but I can't stand tomato juice so I just chug the coffee down till my hands shake.  When we sit down we are immediately awaiting our specials to be drawn on the paper place mat on the table.  The staff has a complex specials list memorized which they generally write in cursive on the table.  The paper place mat is great, we always bring our own pens and draw, its so fun yet so simple.To the food, brunch menu is phenomenal.  The country breakfast is my go to but the burger is crazy good.  Either will satisfy your needs to the max.  Also the fries they make are dipped in crack tasty.

"I wish I could fall in love with every place as hard as I fell for Diner. My friend Trevor and I were walking Williamsburg, trying to decide on a place to eat. He mentioned a spot that he would frequently bike past but had never been inside of, and though it was a bit of a walk on a cold day, I could not be more grateful for our willingness to trek. The lunch menu was small, which I enjoy, and the ambiance was such a mix of solo lunchers with newspapers, and four-top hung over hipsters, all of whom looked unfazed by their surroundings. Being a Diner virgin, I just sat and took it all in. I usually can't finish a cup of coffee. I'll order one, drink about 2/3rds of the thing, and then realize I'm done. I drank FOUR CUPS here. It was delicious. Our adorable waitress wrote the specials on our table, which had a white piece of paper as a tablecloth, and though they all sounded spectacular, I already knew I wanted a burger. I cannot make this plain enough. This was the best goddamn burger I've ever had in my life. It required time and focus, as art observed usually does. This is not a place to wolf your food. Please be courteous, and love what you're there to do. The experience of eating can be very primal, out of necessity, and simultaneously a completely human experience, something developed and magical. Diner is pure magic. Trevor got the chicken sandwich, and if I hadn't ordered that burger, I would have been really blown away. I had already fallen in love though, the sandwich was nice, really nice, but I was already taken. I saw what other people had ordered- a giant bowl of mussels? A really fresh looking omelet?

"Diner is well worth the wait, hype, time, money, etc.  Took my wife there for a birthday dinner and a night out away from the kids and we were both sad when we finished our desert as we knew we would have to leave.  Our service was great and food was impeccable.  Yes, they do write the evenings menu on the table and we had to read some of it upside down but who cares....our waiter was awesome and made us feel welcome and important.  We went with some of his suggestions on the menu and some of our own and everything was a hit.  The atmosphere was very cool and reminded us of our time living in Europe, where everyone eats together and actually shares conversations between tables.  We arrived right at 6pm and were seated immediately, but by 6:30 the place was packed.  Lots of candles and cool music (no bubblegum) and surprisingly there were several tables with kids.Our meal started with a whitefish soup and beef carpaccio...I'm not much of a soup guys and don't eat much beef but I found myself licking the bowl and wondering if there were extra orders laying around that I might be able to snag.  Both portions were very filling.  Just before our entree's we shared a bowl of fettuccine that was easily one of the best bowl of pasta I've ever had.  This leads into my one and only complaint....it was so good that I needed more.  The portion was good but tasting that good it should be double the size.  As for our entree's, my wife had the Cod and I had the Pork Chop and both were EXCELLENT.  So good that it almost started a fight between us....my wife was eating so fast as she could not control herself and then wanted to do the same to my pork chop.  What little I tasted of her cod was really good...moist and flavorful.  My chop was cooked to perfection...soft and juicy with a  great grilled outer layer.  Huge portion!!!!  We finished the night with desert and all I will say is ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING""  ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING""I wouldn't consider myself or my wife as ""foodies"" but we both appreciate a good meal and even more great service and we received both at Diner.  I could easily eat there a few times a week and would probably order 2 orders of carpaccio, 1 order of the pork chop, 5 orders of the pasta, and 10 orders of the bread pudding.  Seriously!This is not the place to be uptight and overly critical.  Yes, it is in an old dinner and the decor is straight forward...nothing fancy but this is not to say it's lacking.  It just is what it is.  Another very cool place in Brooklyn without being pretentious and reaching.  Great food, great atmosphere, great times.....",5.0
"Trendy, small, cozy, and delicious.This place is a little on the pricy side of things.  People who enjoy this place, value quality over quantity.  The ingredients are locally grown, organic, and sustainable.  The menu is different everyday.  Put together by the chef after a visit to the market.  So what you get depends upon what is fresh today... literally!Anthony Bourdain filmed part of an episode of his wildly popular No Reservations show here.  Tony praised it and ultimately questioned why he hadn't known about the great food culture of Brooklyn until now.  Asking: ""Is it too late for me?""Fun Facts:Rumor has it that the burger, which isn't on the menu, is to die for.  Though I've never tried it and cannot confirm its existence.This is a great date spot.I've rubbed elbows with celebs here (no names thats just tacky).  Nobody too famous, but still kind of fun when you're out to dinner.",5.0

"Diner is well worth the wait, hype, time, money, etc.  Took my wife there for a birthday dinner and a night out away from the kids and we were both sad when we finished our desert as we knew we would have to leave.  Our service was great and food was impeccable.  Yes, they do write the evenings menu on the table and we had to read some of it upside down but who cares....our waiter was awesome and made us feel welcome and important.  We went with some of his suggestions on the menu and some of our own and everything was a hit.  The atmosphere was very cool and reminded us of our time living in Europe, where everyone eats together and actually shares conversations between tables.  We arrived right at 6pm and were seated immediately, but by 6:30 the place was packed.  Lots of candles and cool music (no bubblegum) and surprisingly there were several tables with kids.Our meal started with a whitefish soup and beef carpaccio...I'm not much of a soup guys and don't eat much beef but I found myself licking the bowl and wondering if there were extra orders laying around that I might be able to snag.  Both portions were very filling.  Just before our entree's we shared a bowl of fettuccine that was easily one of the best bowl of pasta I've ever had.  This leads into my one and only complaint....it was so good that I needed more.  The portion was good but tasting that good it should be double the size.  As for our entree's, my wife had the Cod and I had the Pork Chop and both were EXCELLENT.  So good that it almost started a fight between us....my wife was eating so fast as she could not control herself and then wanted to do the same to my pork chop.  What little I tasted of her cod was really good...moist and flavorful.  My chop was cooked to perfection...soft and juicy with a  great grilled outer layer.  Huge portion!!!!  We finished the night with desert and all I will say is ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING""  ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING"" ""GET THE BREAD PUDDING""I wouldn't consider myself or my wife as ""foodies"" but we both appreciate a good meal and even more great service and we received both at Diner.  I could easily eat there a few times a week and would probably order 2 orders of carpaccio, 1 order of the pork chop, 5 orders of the pasta, and 10 orders of the bread pudding.  Seriously!This is not the place to be uptight and overly critical.  Yes, it is in an old dinner and the decor is straight forward...nothing fancy but this is not to say it's lacking.  It just is what it is.  Another very cool place in Brooklyn without being pretentious and reaching.  Great food, great atmosphere, great times.....",5.0
"Trendy, small, cozy, and delicious.This place is a little on the pricy side of things.  People who enjoy this place, value quality over quantity.  The ingredients are locally grown, organic, and sustainable.  The menu is different everyday.  Put together by the chef after a visit to the market.  So what you get depends upon what is fresh today... literally!Anthony Bourdain filmed part of an episode of his wildly popular No Reservations show here.  Tony praised it and ultimately questioned why he hadn't known about the great food culture of Brooklyn until now.  Asking: ""Is it too late for me?""Fun Facts:Rumor has it that the burger, which isn't on the menu, is to die for.  Though I've never tried it and cannot confirm its existence.This is a great date spot.I've rubbed elbows with celebs here (no names thats just tacky).  Nobody too famous, but still kind of fun when you're out to dinner.",5.0

Nothing bad to say about this place. Really dig the atmosphere and i like the fact that there is only a burger on the menu and the rest of the food is what they where cooking that day. Food was super fresh and cooked perfect. Went to Diner with 5 people and all of our meals were amazing.,4.0

"Really like Diner.  1) I love diners; 2) I love well executed food with great ingredients; 3) I love the atmosphere of this place. The first time I ate there, ours was the last meal out of the kitchen for the night, something like 1 am.  This was almost a year ago, but I still remember those two fat, amazing scallops we ate and the flourless chocolate cake that blew me away.  Went back last week and had a very good jerusalem artichoke soup, some excellent housemade fettucine and a good piece of swordfish with a crispy potato and some strangely fishy-tasting kale. Also had the flourless chocolate cake, still quite good but not the mind blower it was the first time through.  Prices are not cheap, but the service has been real good and the atmosphere is unpretentious and comfortable.  I know this place has been around a while now, but I'm glad it stuck around long enough for me to enjoy it.",4.0
"By far one of the best dining experiences I've had in NYC.  Fine, you're in hipster central, but the food and service are great.  We had to wait at least 45 minutes when we went there on a Saturday night, so we enjoyed a drink or two.  There are several cocktail choices, and the one I had (with elderflower and gin) was great.  The wine and beer are very reasonably priced as well.  Since we had to wait a little longer than what we were initially told (maybe just 10 minutes longer), our waitress told us that the first round of drinks were on the house.  This gets a MAJOR plus in my book.  For being a no-reservations establishment, I understand having a longer wait than expected at times, so they certainly didn't have to give us free drinks or any sort of compensation since it's not their fault by any means, but the fact that they made this gesture is what great service and hospitality is all about.  It's quite interesting that they verbally recite and hand-write the menu on the table as you're sitting there.  This just goes to show that the menu is small but based on what available fresh straight from the farm ingredients they have that day.  Not only does the menu change daily, but it changes throughout the course of the night as well.  We started with a grilled squid salad.  I honestly don't remember all the components of the salad, but the dressing was quite garlicky and quite amazing - one of the best salads I've ever had.  Ok, so being originally from Chicago, I'm all about the smashed griddled burger (a la Shake Shack for you New Yorkers).  The really thick grilled type burgers tend to be harder to impress, but Diner served one of the best burgers I've ever had, regardless of the type.  It was grilled to perfection (medium rare!), juicy, full of natural flavor, topped with white cheddar, and served with pickled onions (i think).  Seriously, fantastic.  I can't comment much on my boyfriend's steak, but I remember it also being perfectly grilled, flavorful, and incredibly tender.  Portion isn't huge for the steak, but enough nonetheless.  This is a place that I cannot wait to return to once I'm back in NYC.  Will definitely have to try it out for brunch/lunch as well.",5.0
"A friend recommended this place to me and said it's one of the best places for brunch in Williamsburg but that it's small and gets crowded very fast. No kidding!

Service was okay--not bad, but felt it was a bit slow once it got busy. The menu is very simple, just a few things and a few specials not on the menu. I went with the open ham sandwich (w egg, toast, dijon on the side), my friend got whatever market salad special it was, and we shared a side of the french fries. My open sandwich was good (glad I had the dijon on the side because it was super strong and I hate mustard) but definitely NOT worth the $13. I mean, it was good and fresh but really??? It didn't even come with anything! And this is Williamsburg! I asked my friend how her salad was. She responded, ""You mean cole slaw?"" Yeah, it looked like cole slaw. She said it was ok but it was also $10 and prob not worth that price. The fries ($5) were very good though. We also each got a pot of green tea ($4). So all in all we paid just over $20 incl. tax and tip for a mediocre brunch.Cute place though. I hear the grass fed burger is good, and there's also a chocolate sandwich ($6) as an option.

"The menu's so good but I mostly get the wandering eye and fall prey to the burger which is one of the best in the city and cooked to perfection.  We've  had many meals there and appreciate how Diner strives to use local, fresh ingredients and masterfully crafts the menu on a regular basis.You have to be prepared for the space which is intimate, boisterous and just a bit cramped.  If you're gonna spill government secrets you'll probably be overheard by the 5 people sitting around you but it'll be OK because, after all, they're hipsters!",4.0
"Diner is like the Emperor's New Clothes of diners...First of all, its a diner with restaurant prices.  Which is actually something my fellow Yelper Danielle H. whispered to me as we entered.  Don't get me wrong, the food is good and the clientele is diverse.  But for fuck's sake---HELLOO? ITS UGLY AND... ITS A DINER!  Granted, its a cool old street car diner, but there are better preserved ones.  If I were to pick a restaurant purely for its kitsch Williamsburg ""dinerness""  I'd choose Relish over Diner.

"""Birthday dinner this Friday!"" the email reads, ""we've rented out a room at Diner.""  Wha?  I'm thinking to myself,  Diner has a room?  That you can rent out?

The meat was so tender I wanted to cry, and the polenta so flavorful and buttery...just out of this world.  The only sad thing about the Airstream is that it's not air-conditioned, so it's not really realistic to rent it out once the weather becomes more consistently warm--even once it's consistently above 50--with 15 warm bodies in there, it can heat up pretty quickly.  But in about 8 months or so when we get that first frost, I'm all about coming up with a reason to have a party.",5.0

We both had the chicken sandwich with blue cheese, which may sound boring but it was not at all. It was sooooooo good!

"So I have this bad habit of only remembering the good places that I eat, so all my reviews end up being really positive BUT here I go again: eat at this place!We had to wait while for a table even on a Wednesday night, and it was quite claustrophobic in the doorway since there's no place to stand really where you aren't in the way of waitstaff and clientele passing through (it's set up like a real, old-school diner so its very narrow with seats at the bar that runs the length of it) but once we were seated, we felt redeemed. There's a pretty intriguing if minimal cocktail menu as well as a full bar, and if you get seated at the counter as we did, that provides some lively entertainment throughout your meal. The scene here is as hip and trendy as you would expect for the neighborhood, but everyone seemed pretty relaxed and content despite the ""cool' factor --- a happy state of affairs that one doesn't come across so often in Manhattan. For eats, I can vouch for the rabbit-belly and fennel salad (which was a special, but if you're lucky it will be there when you go) because of its really unusual blend of textures as well as flavors. This was definitely on the outer fringe of things I'm willing to eat, but I'm glad I took the risk. Its a dish that my mind keeps going back to a week later. For a main course, try the coq au vin with barley if  you're not too tempted by the burgers that everyone seems to order. That's what I'll have next time. The chicken was very flavorful and perfectly cooked, but man did those burgers smell good!Can't remember if it was a special or not, but the chocolate mousse dessert was a very good call. Enjoy!

"I hadn't made it out to Diner before because it's a bit far from the L, but my husband and I were in the area for a concert and decided to stop in. We got there around 7:30 PM on a Saturday and were seated immediately, which was surprising, as I had been told to expect a wait. The whole ~writing the menu on the table~ schtick is a little iffy, but the waiters are all friendly and knowledgeable, so I will let that one slide. I ordered a cocktail with tequila, ginger, and grapefruit bitters, which was fantastic and heavy on the booze (thanks, guys!) and my husband got their version of a Manhattan, which was equally alcoholic and delicious. When it came to dinner, I had to order the burger that I had heard so much about (it isn't on the menu, per say, during dinner, but it's always an option - just ask), while my husband ordered the bass with morel mushrooms and a fresh pea and asparagus salad. Both dishes were unbelievably good - his mushrooms were earthy and buttery, and the fish had the crispiest skin ever. My burger, though, was the star of the show. I say this as someone who has ordered a burger at almost every restaurant I've been to: Diner has, without a doubt, the B E S T burger I've ever tasted in my entire life. It was perfectly medium rare (AKA more on the rare side, as it should be), the bun was sweet and toasted, and whatever the burger was seasoned with was spot on, especially the copious amount of salt, which I would have thought would be too much, but it just kept me coming back for more and more; it was addicting. We were in such a good mood after our meal that we even ordered dessert, which we never do. We split the lemon bundt cake with brandied cherries and whipped cream, which was yet another winning plate. All of our plates went back licked clean, and I only wish that I could head over to Diner every day to experience their magnification food. I know it's a little bit a trek to get over there for most Williamsburg-ers, but get off your ass and go because it's the best food you'll have in town.",5.0
"I love Diner so much.  Conveniently located a mere two blocks away from my friend's apartment, it is lovely to be catered to by such caring people while nursing a hangover.The menu is limited, but there are tons of new specials everyday, which is great for someone like me because I like to be surprised and love hearing a long list of possible tasty options (variety is music to my ears!).  The server writes all the specials down on the sheet of paper that doubles as a tablecloth; the first time I went, my server actually sat down next to me, read the specials and wrote them down - I actually cringed at first because I had no idea what he was doing.The food is delicious, and the prices are reasonable (think $12-18 for an entree).  A typical breakfast for me usually consists of their moist and juicy cheeseburger, but I've ventured and tried a few other dishes including scrapple (pork offal mixed with cornmeal and spices, molded into a loaf, sliced and fried in lard - DELICIOUS) and the goat cheese omelet which was utter perfection because it was not browned, was not too dry nor too wet and kept a perfect form (I am an expert on omelets and all things breakfast), and the goat cheese was in perfect warm, creamy ratio to every bite of egg.  Diner is not the first place on my mind when I'm hungry and feel like spending a few bucks, but the attentive service, charm of the interior and having an ever-changing menu (that is sure to be good) makes it a once-in-a-while mainstay in my diet.",4.0
"Had a real NYC style dinner, coming here at 11pm to eat and still had a wait. Food was well-portioned and delicious. Wait staff was ok. French press coffee was perfection.

"I finally made it over here today with my friend for lupper. You know, late lunch, early supper. So, maybe because of the time we were there the menu was very limited. The server did write the specials down for us on our paper table covering which is a great idea for those of us with short- term memories or A.D.D. We both had the chicken sandwich with blue cheese, which may sound boring but it was not at all. It was sooooooo good! And the service is great, very relaxed, didn't mind that we sat and guffawed for ages. I live close. I'll be back. Even if I didn't live close, I'd be back.",4.0
"1st time i went: Fantastic service. Loved the burger , made to perfection just like I asked. Overall, a casual cool atmosphere and top quality food - can't ask for anything more.2nd time: took a friend for his birthday. The fries had a nicely fried roach. Management comped the meal. Never went back. Not the cleanest place , but nice vibe.",2.0
"So I have this bad habit of only remembering the good places that I eat, so all my reviews end up being really positive BUT here I go again: eat at this place!We had to wait while for a table even on a Wednesday night, and it was quite claustrophobic in the doorway since there's no place to stand really where you aren't in the way of waitstaff and clientele passing through (it's set up like a real, old-school diner so its very narrow with seats at the bar that runs the length of it) but once we were seated, we felt redeemed. There's a pretty intriguing if minimal cocktail menu as well as a full bar, and if you get seated at the counter as we did, that provides some lively entertainment throughout your meal. The scene here is as hip and trendy as you would expect for the neighborhood, but everyone seemed pretty relaxed and content despite the ""cool' factor --- a happy state of affairs that one doesn't come across so often in Manhattan. For eats, I can vouch for the rabbit-belly and fennel salad (which was a special, but if you're lucky it will be there when you go) because of its really unusual blend of textures as well as flavors. This was definitely on the outer fringe of things I'm willing to eat, but I'm glad I took the risk. Its a dish that my mind keeps going back to a week later. For a main course, try the coq au vin with barley if  you're not too tempted by the burgers that everyone seems to order. That's what I'll have next time. The chicken was very flavorful and perfectly cooked, but man did those burgers smell good!Can't remember if it was a special or not, but the chocolate mousse dessert was a very good call. Enjoy! And go at as ""off"" an hour as you can manage to beat the crowd!",3.0

"how does this place not have 5 stars? maybe i've just gotten lucky. both times i came we showed up early, got seated right away, and had a very pleasant and helpful server. eating at a geriatric hour comes in handy more often than not in new york. plus, the last time i was there, they played nothing but magnetic fields. which is a-ok with me! the food is amazing. i can eat anything here--anything--even things that don't even sound good, and they are. things i wouldn't ordinarily like. love the juxtaposition of high-quality food in an old diner setting.this place is only listed at $$, but i honestly feel like it's more $$$--it's not the kind of place where you can just order an entree and call it good. if you're not very well off, it's probably gonna be a special occasion place, not a random meal out place.",5.0
"Perfection is seldom found in Williamsburg (for me, at least) in terms of eating out.  Somehow, DINER seems to match my own excitement each and every visit.Culling a simple yet effective menu, Diner attracts locals and adventurers alike.  The Specials on the menu are told to you in detail by a lovely waiter/waitress, and they really seem to know each and every dish.  From their amazing brunch to the whole dinner experience, Diner's prices, ambience and GREAT wait staff prove a formidable ally when hungry in Williamsburg.Great are their eggs, their corned beef hash and ANY fish specials, and somewhat under the radar is their all-knowing Burger.  It's not too dressy, it's made to perfection and it's taste is unmatched in the line of Greats in NYC!!  Try it! you won't be disappointed!Great place, tremendous value and implacable service. A MUST",5.0
Love this place. I will drive to Brooklyn for this place. I don't know why but I do. It gives me a certain feeling. I like the vibe and how the waiters act like they are your friends discussing the menu. Sometimes they even write it down on the paper right in front of you. I only order the cheeseburger. I have tried other things but decided to make this place my burger spot,5.0

"The place was cozy. Incredibly so. Table on top of banquette table on top of plaid shirted waitress on top of ironic glasses wearing customers on top of let me write the entire menu down with the exception of our Anthony Bourdain approved cheeseburger in illegible semi-script on your paper table ""cloth"" (sans prices I might add) because we're too cool to use actual menus - how rare for a restaurant, an old restaurant to be able to retain it's unabashed ""hipster relevance"" still after all these years. So sure, Diner is iconic of a certain post-collegiate, Daily Show worshipping clientele whose biggest concerns of the day are probably not forgetting to TiVo Mad Men, measuring out their Carbon Footprint, and fretting over how to perfectly coif their facial hair, but does that make the food any good? As a big lover of these folks' newer ventures (see: Marlowe & Sons), for my hard earned buck, I'd rather be eating over there. It's not that the food wasn't good at Diner per say, it's just that it was incredibly ok. For a spot that received such glowing reviews in the past and is experiencing something of a second coming given the success of Marlowe, I have to say I was expecting more than an inedibly frozen slice of Spice Cake for desert, a corn bread ""salad"" appetizer that  felt oddly unsatisfying  - it wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything I would crave at 3 AM on a Friday evening after a night of too many drinks.  The main courses faired slightly better: my pork chop was salty and moist and vaguely smokey and definitely made me feel like less of a Jew for enjoying it so much. However, in truth, I only ordered the pork chop because it was supposed to come with an ""eggplant mascarpone,"" and if I'm a lover of anything it's eggplant and mascarpones. When my plate arrived, I search for the eggplant marscapone but it was nowhere to be found!? Where did you go eggplant marscapone? And then there was the ""award winning"" burger. Why does it seem like every restaurant I set foot in has an ""award winning burger""? From the Corner Bistro to The Spotted Pig- it doesn't matter if you're lost in Williamsburg Brooklyn or standing in the middle of Park Avenue, I would wager you are probably no more the three block from some place whose burger is ""award winning.""  So yes, the burger at Diner is delicious - the meat moist and juicy and the addition of pickled onions certainly a nice touch - I admired it's simplicity, but really was it memorable, deserving of awards? I think not. It was a ""solid"" cheeseburger, but perhaps I would've liked it more if there were some other options on the ""menu"" that were healthier and I wasn't feeling obliged/coerced/manipulated to order this burger. C'mon Diner, NO FISH on the entire menu!?!? Not cool. As the meal wound to a close I found that I adored my company and the completely obliging service and the general ambience of being around folks discussing when Sufjan Stevens' new record was coming out - however no matter how much I would've liked to, I just didn't adore the food.",3.0

This place is special because everything they make taste extremely fresh and it feels like you are eating something that was just picked from a garden. i will definitely be back here soon despite the long ride there.",5.0
First time visiting the Diner today and certainly not the last. I absolutely loved every dish I ordered.

"This used to be one of my favorite places in the city.  I was in denial, but after 5 so/so - bad meals in a row, I'm calling it quits.   Portions have become tiny and the food quality has decidedly gone downhill.  I brought a friend visiting from Iceland.

Dinner service hadn't started yet and it seemed like the staff was having a meeting and learning the menu for the night. The place itself is cozy and has so much character. The Service was friendly, fast and helpful. The food is fresh and everything tasted great. We had a Beef Carpaccio (melt in your mouth delicous and fresh) I had the Cod and my bf had the Fettucine. Both were delicous but my boyfriend was wishing that his portion was a little bigger. For dessert we had a Maple syrup custard with ginger cookies... yummmm. It was suprisingly light and refreshing. The drinks were also very well made. All in all we enjoyed it very much and want to return for brunch. Be warned that by 7pm it gets packed and there will be a wait.",4.0
"Diner represents everything that's cool about Williamsburg, and none of the things that suck about Williamsburg.  It's privately owned, intimate, extremely high quality, cute (the building tilts west -- seriously), stylish, and fun.  It's not a haven for tourists, it's not a scene spot, and it's not pretentious.  The service has always been friendly and, despite a menu that doesn't read too differently from an old diner menu, the dinner specials are the type of fare you'd expect at top-tier Manhattan restaurants.  Add to the mix their sister spot next door, Marlow & Sons, and Diner is really a Southside powerhouse.",5.0

"I live right near Diner, and go there whenever I can afford it.It's not cheap, but it's easily worth it. I don't know who these folks are that are bad mouthing the food.

"Diner has the best burgers in Brooklyn. However they tend to cook it a bit rare, so order it a bit more well-done than what you would usually eat (seriously, i've had to send back burgers which I ordered medium-rare before). They make some pretty good Bloody Mary's too.",5.0
"The place was cozy. Incredibly so. Table on top of banquette table on top of plaid shirted waitress on top of ironic glasses wearing customers on top of let me write the entire menu down with the exception of our Anthony Bourdain approved cheeseburger in illegible semi-script on your paper table ""cloth"" (sans prices I might add) because we're too cool to use actual menus - how rare for a restaurant, an old restaurant to be able to retain it's unabashed ""hipster relevance"" still after all these years. So sure, Diner is iconic of a certain post-collegiate, Daily Show worshipping clientele whose biggest concerns of the day are probably not forgetting to TiVo Mad Men, measuring out their Carbon Footprint, and fretting over how to perfectly coif their facial hair, but does that make the food any good? As a big lover of these folks' newer ventures (see: Marlowe & Sons), for my hard earned buck, I'd rather be eating over there. It's not that the food wasn't good at Diner per say, it's just that it was incredibly ok. For a spot that received such glowing reviews in the past and is experiencing something of a second coming given the success of Marlowe, I have to say I was expecting more than an inedibly frozen slice of Spice Cake for desert, a corn bread ""salad"" appetizer that  felt oddly unsatisfying  - it wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything I would crave at 3 AM on a Friday evening after a night of too many drinks.  The main courses faired slightly better: my pork chop was salty and moist and vaguely smokey and definitely made me feel like less of a Jew for enjoying it so much. However, in truth, I only ordered the pork chop because it was supposed to come with an ""eggplant mascarpone,"" and if I'm a lover of anything it's eggplant and mascarpones. When my plate arrived, I search for the eggplant marscapone but it was nowhere to be found!? Where did you go eggplant marscapone? And then there was the ""award winning"" burger. Why does it seem like every restaurant I set foot in has an ""award winning burger""? From the Corner Bistro to The Spotted Pig- it doesn't matter if you're lost in Williamsburg Brooklyn or standing in the middle of Park Avenue, I would wager you are probably no more the three block from some place whose burger is ""award winning.""  So yes, the burger at Diner is delicious - the meat moist and juicy and the addition of pickled onions certainly a nice touch - I admired it's simplicity, but really was it memorable, deserving of awards? I think not. It was a ""solid"" cheeseburger, but perhaps I would've liked it more if there were some other options on the ""menu"" that were healthier and I wasn't feeling obliged/coerced/manipulated to order this burger. C'mon Diner, NO FISH on the entire menu!?!? Not cool. As the meal wound to a close I found that I adored my company and the completely obliging service and the general ambience of being around folks discussing when Sufjan Stevens' new record was coming out - however no matter how much I would've liked to, I just didn't adore the food.",3.0
Best brunch ever.I won't comment on the rest.,5.0
"i have only been here once but that was enough to fall in love with this place. i have to say living on the upper west it was kind of a pain to get here because i went on a Saturday and the weekend schedule for the train runs differently but once i took a bite from their burger, all my anger towards the MTA just melted away. it was the perfect and most delicious burger i have ever had (besides mine) and the pickled onions on the burger is a genius idea. This place is special because everything they make taste extremely fresh and it feels like you are eating something that was just picked from a garden. i will definitely be back here soon despite the long ride there.",5.0
First time visiting the Diner today and certainly not the last. I absolutely loved every dish I ordered. I am a big fan of hearty food as it reminds me of my childhood when my grandma or mom cooked from the freshest ingredients and everything from scratch. This is the place to feel like I'm back home in my old kitchen. The aroma and taste are purely nostalgic and I will return to the Diner whenever I'm in the area.,5.0
"This used to be one of my favorite places in the city.  I was in denial, but after 5 so/so - bad meals in a row, I'm calling it quits.   Portions have become tiny and the food quality has decidedly gone downhill.  I brought a friend visiting from Iceland.

"One of the better places i've been to in this part of the burg. i live about 15 mins away from this place and i am smitten with their weekly/ seasonal specials. Their main menu is short with the usual suspects but its all about the specials here anyway. They line each table with a large sheet of paper instead of table cloth. Its the first place i've been to where they write down the specials on your table ""cloth"" with you instead of a printed out weekly specials in the menu.  It feels affable when waiters / waitresses spend more than the normal 10 seconds with you. Service may feel slower because of this but the food is worth the wait.",4.0
"It's small. But this is one of my favorite date spots. It feels like an old train or, to be less creative, ahem *diner*. This is not the crappy diner you go to after you were taking shots of patron offa some ugly white girls belly button into the wee hours of the morning. No this place is a shining example of understated beauty. The ""menu"" is given by the waitress from memory. I've been here three times and it never ceases to amaze me how these ladies remember all that--plus the menu changes all the time. I've had all sorts of dishes here from headcheese to duck to a great porterhouse (beat the crap outta that Peter German handgun joint). Oh and what I love the most about this place--they treat their veggies on the same level as their excellent meats. If you have a lil extra coin to spend and have a hottie you want to enjoy a meal with, this so called diner should be at the top of your list.",4.0

"Perfect brunch spot = fantastic service (the waiters sit with you to ""talk food"" - aka discuss the menu), quirky and quaint atmosphere, and totally amazing food! I highly recommend the fried chicken sandwich on brioche. (I have a limited spice tolerance - but I didn't find it to be too hot.) The scone of the day was blueberry, peach, and devonshire cream, which was pretty much heaven on a plate!!! We had no wait at 10am on a Sunday - however it was a super rainy summer morning.",5.0
This review is for the burger. Everything I have eaten here has been good but the burger cooked medium rare is my good friend. It is always amazing! The meat is fresh and tasty (I have bought the ground beef they use from marlow and daughters with great results too). I have eaten at Lugers and Dumont plenty of times and this is best burger in Williamsburg.,5.0

"I was visiting NYC, and looking for a good place to eat when a friend recommended this place.  A few friends and I walked into the place not knowing what to expect.The place is an old rail diner car that's been converted into a restaurant.  It's very tight in there, yet some may say it's intimate.When we sat down at the table we weren't given menus.  We weren't really sure what the story was until the waiter showed up.  He amazingly recited the whole menu, which changes daily, from memory while writing info on the paper table cloth.  It was quite impressive, while the offerings on the menu were even more impressive.The friend that recommended the place to me said that they have a great burger.  Since I didn't want to order a really expensive dish off their daily menu I went with the burger.  I was not disappointed with the burger and fries.I can't recall all of the details since I was actually there 3 months ago.  I can say with all certainty that when I go back to NYC I'll be going to this place again to try some of their other offerings!",5.0
"I just ate here for the first time the other night and it was so delicious!  The steak had some deep down real beef flavor, and the fries and lightly dressed lambs quarters that were served with it were incredible as well.  Similarly perfect was the dandelion salad with a fried egg on top.  A little more expensive than my regular fare but worth it!  Get their meat just up the street too.",5.0

"Working across the street, I've ended up here a lot. My first time I had an amazing chocolate sandwich, but the second time I ordered it they left it in the toaster way too long. Crumb city!They only have about 5 things on the menu and they are not all great. Somehow they made a crappy goat cheese salad (way too bitter) and I didn't love the biscuits and gravy either. The specials can be tempting but are unpredictable; one day it's tunafish canapes and another it's a dutch baby. I guess next time I'll suck it up and get a burger since the only other option is the omelette and I hate eggs. They seem to want to show off that they have all the latest hipster tracks because they frequently blast them at a volume that makes pleasant lunch conversation problematic.

"I go to brunch pretty much every sunday with friends and I was a little disappointed in last Sunday's choice, even though it was mine!  We went to Diner in W'burg, where I have been many times and after waiting for nearly an hour, we where asked if we could sit outside as the tables where already set up - why not ask us that straight away instead of making us wait??  They had changed  the menu and reduced it to 6 things with 4 or 5 specials - overall 3 items were chocolate and one was donuts!  If I wanted bloody donuts I would go to Dunkin's.....they also didn't have their steak and eggs which was a huge disappointment and I was still so hungry after the meal that my friend had to give me a power bar!  Kinda sad.....not sure if I want to go back again even though it was my standby if I wanted a local brunch....",3.0
"What happened to this place??? I used to enjoy the food here but tonight it was simply AWFUL. I ordered the chicken cacciatore special. It was ONE chicken leg with a few mushrooms and pieces of tomato and a piece of grilled bread. The size was that of an appetizer but even worse is the fact that it was LOADED with salt. Even the bread was soaked in salt. My partner ordered a pulled pork special. Guess what? Pure salt. He sent it back and ordered a burger instead. Guess what? Loaded with salt, fries loaded with salt. I simply could not believe how bad everything was. The chicken leg cost them about $1 and they charged $18. Had it been delicious or even mediocre I would not be writing this review. I do not care how ""trendy"" Diner is. We agreed we will never, ever, go back. There are so many far better places to eat, it was pure disappointment.",1.0

"Another charming and stylish Williamsburg oldie but goody.I used to enjoy the food at Diner a lot as it was well done Bistro food, and has been in the Neighborhood at least the whole time I have been which is about 8 years now.Good burgers, on a tasty bun, with really well spiced fries, and for brunch a really rich Steak and Egg breakfast the steak being quite thick, and juicy.As happens in restaurants that you have know for a long time, the quality has changed, altough I find this to be a hit or miss proposition where sometimes both the service and food will be medium to mediocre, and at others will be excellent.For instance after knee surgery and being under for 6h my friends brought me to Diner for lunch and it was quite a comforting experience being in the dark and classic space, as well as having this rich and comforting food after the cold and starck clinical oppressiveness of the hospital.In someways diner is suffering the fate of neighborhood/family style places whose restaurateur has moved away from this particular place, and therefore the service becomes disinterested in the customers.",3.0
"Yeah, it's probably a hipster spot, and I freakin' despise hipsters, but I couldn't care less. The food was delicious. We had parmesan soup, arugula salad with hazelnuts and grilled pear, and ribeye for two, and enjoyed everything immensely. I actually didn't really care for hearing the menu (and seeing the summary of it on the paper) from the waitress. Thought it took way too long. I can understand it for restaurants that have a very short menu, but their menu's not exactly small. The only dish I didn't like was the side watercress salad that was served with the ribeye. It was rather one-dimensional, and I'm not a huge fan of watercress on top of that. Other than that, totally happy with the experience here. I love that they use good quality ingredients and cook them in a way that make them shine. It's not cheap, but considering the quality of ingredients, it's worth it for me. I'll be back for that burger and brunch soon.",4.0

"Another charming and stylish Williamsburg oldie but goody.I used to enjoy the food at Diner a lot as it was well done Bistro food, and has been in the Neighborhood at least the whole time I have been which is about 8 years now.Good burgers, on a tasty bun, with really well spiced fries, and for brunch a really rich Steak and Egg breakfast the steak being quite thick, and juicy.As happens in restaurants that you have know for a long time, the quality has changed, altough I find this to be a hit or miss proposition where sometimes both the service and food will be medium to mediocre, and at others will be excellent.For instance after knee surgery and being under for 6h my friends brought me to Diner for lunch and it was quite a comforting experience being in the dark and classic space, as well as having this rich and comforting food after the cold and starck clinical oppressiveness of the hospital.In someways diner is suffering the fate of neighborhood/family style places whose restaurateur has moved away from this particular place, and therefore the service becomes disinterested in the customers.",3.0
"Yeah, it's probably a hipster spot, and I freakin' despise hipsters, but I couldn't care less. The food was delicious. We had parmesan soup, arugula salad with hazelnuts and grilled pear, and ribeye for two, and enjoyed everything immensely. I actually didn't really care for hearing the menu (and seeing the summary of it on the paper) from the waitress. Thought it took way too long. I can understand it for restaurants that have a very short menu, but their menu's not exactly small. The only dish I didn't like was the side watercress salad that was served with the ribeye. It was rather one-dimensional, and I'm not a huge fan of watercress on top of that. Other than that, totally happy with the experience here. I love that they use good quality ingredients and cook them in a way that make them shine. It's not cheap, but considering the quality of ingredients, it's worth it for me. I'll be back for that burger and brunch soon.",4.0

"SERVICE = Kind of sub-par. While our hostess was extremely accommodating, this did not make up for our waiter's failure to give a hoot about us, which I found astounding. Upon arriving, the place was not too crowded, and we were told by the hostess to kindly wait a few minutes before out waiter explained the menu and told us the specials. We waited patiently and finally, after a few attempts of giving him the ""eyes"", our ginger haired waiter sauntered over non-chanlantly explaining the menu in great detail, which is a nice touch, however it is a bit easy to forget each detailed explanation.

The pork rillette app was decent. The steak bistrot was $24.00 and of VERY good portion size and quality. The accompanying watercress salad was tasty (albeit uninteresting). The bone-marrow butter was a really nice touch, but the salt was incredibly over-the-top. To go inline with my gripes about oversalted food, the fries were very salty. Even for my salt-loving father, who LOVES everything super salty, he was miffed. The famous burger is really not great and I had a much better one at River Styx or Roebling tea room.VALUE = Meh.

But still, the flavor of the meat was divine. Grass-fed organic beef that was seared on the outside, a bit rare on the inside but still delicious.

"Perhaps I was so desperate for a good brunch that I saddled Diner with unrealistically lofty expectations, but I think the truth is that Diner is just not very good.  While my burger was plump and juicy and the special omelettes boasted stellar combinations of ingredients, the overall quality of the food was not high enough to justify the prices.  The clientele is oppressively self-aware but apparently not aware enough to go elsewhere for good diner fare.  The space is appealing but does not make for speedy service since it's well nigh impossible to move around.  My companion and I thought that sitting at the counter might improve our chances of being served quickly, or at least having our coffee refilled semi-regularly, but no such luck.  Frankly if I worked at Diner I wouldn't be too attentive either, for clearly the majority of the customers were there to be seen and not to eat (as evidenced by my wan neighbor perched precariously on her bar stool, who left her tuna sandwich virtually untouched and scarely glanced at her home fries). Ordinarily I would make allowances for having waltzed in at the busiest time of day, and bad service and bodily discomfort alone are not enough to make me forego a place if the food is good and the price is right.  Unfortunately neither of these is true of Diner.",3.0
"I hope this review will help Diner improve because the place has potential to be a good spot. The atmosphere is what you come to Wiliamsburg for, eclectic, electric, creative. But that's where it stops. The menu is limited, if not just plain weird. The food is not good, and it's not hard to make a good burger or even a chicken sandwich. I live nearby and would love if they had good tasting recognizable food.",2.0

"I've been coming to diner with my honey and two friends for the past 6 years, nearly every friday night. I remember it as a greasy spoon palace, when the ribeye was soaking in grease and so were the fries, the air was heavy with smoke, and the waitrons were hot as nails. I lost my affection for the place when they stopped serving red meat a few years back (allegedly because the chef refused to work with such low-quality beef). Thankfully they brought back the steaks, though family style like ol' peter luger down the street -- and the family-style steaks are at peter luger prices. I would avoid the individual steaks, especially the flatiron (your cheap-o option in the grocery store) because the family-style is almost always heavenly. We always order the family-style steaks if they're available, and we still love the fresh menu and the waitstaff. The owners, mark and andrew, are sweethearts with business acumen, especially mark, who's always quick with the quips. In all, I've had a very long-term relationship with diner, and I still adore it.",4.0
"i have long lived in brooklyn and never somehow popped into diner. after a stop at a wine bar down the street, i recently had a chance to head in on the coldest night of the fall starving. diner is very cool looking, very cozy, dimly lit and populated by lots of good looking people, staff included. they had me at hello, when i walked in and discovered that all of notorious b.i.g.'s ready to die was playing. amazing. the menu is always a burger and i believe a goat cheese salad and the list of daily specials is long. me and dot z. split a special roasted pumpkin salad topped with bacon and fried egg and it was awesome. simple, salty and hearty. dot had a fish stew for his main and it seemed a bit lean for a main course, but it was tasty. i chose the broccoli risotto, but sorta regretted it. the portion was on the smaller side, it wasn't very thick and satisfying and it was crazy-salty. the fries we got as a side to split helped me forget the risotto. service was good, quick and i will go back for sure.",4.0
"The food here is good but I think the wine list is overpriced.  The cheapest wine by the glass is $9.  Strange, considering that the burger is only $10 at lunch.  The overpriced wine list seems to be a big trend with restaurants in New York right now.  Sorry, but I really can't fathom any pinot grigio that is worth $9 or $10 a glass!",3.0
yoooo this place is awesome. went here with my girl and ate a cheeseburger with a bloody mary. try the fried chicken sandwich too omg so good,5.0
"This might actually be my favorite place in all five boroughs.  An old diner car (or so it seems), this restaurant is worth the trip to Williamsburg.  Whether you're in the mood for burgers and beer or cosmopolitans and chicken, the food won't disappoint,",5.0
"Diner is a little off the beaten path but it's worth the walk.  They have plenty of outdoor sidewalk seating, you can get a chocolate sandwich (which I highly recommend), and the coffee is amazing!  The service is pretty good and the prices are quite reasonable.  If you are a fan of Williamsburg brunch and want a new favorite, try Diner.",5.0
"On the sign, it states that they've got the best pancake in the world, it means that the United Nations had a session and voted to have Broadway Diner, located at Bayonne NJ USA as having the best pancakes in the world! Bwahahaha... Seriously, I come here once in a while depending on whether I'm visiting Bayonne. The pancakes and the service is pretty good.

i choose the burger it is so good!,4.0
i'm not into the gimmick of having them write the specials on the table. the food was excellent; the selection not that wide and the prices way too high,3.0
