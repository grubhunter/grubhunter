"Mmm I had such an amazing brunch here!!! I came here on a beautiful, sunny Saturday for brunch with my husband and sat outside on the sidewalk.  We were starving so we decided to start with the churros con chocolate which were delicious and the perfect starter to hold us over while waiting for our mains. We were having a difficult time choosing between all of the delicious items listed and decided to split the butterscotch pancakes and Huevos Rancheros. The Butterscoth pancakes were my favorite! I have a MAJOR sweet tooth- the combination of butterscotch chips in the pancakes along with the banana brûlée and maple pecan was insane! They were so good, I wished that I hadn't decided to split them with my hubby. Luckily, they're so huge I'm not sure I could have finished them myself anyway. The Huevos Rancheros were good, but you can't really go wrong when ordering these. For brunch, they also have  $5 frozen margaritas, mimosas and blood marys. I will definitely be back for brunch and cannot wait to try dinner!",4.0
"I recently moved to Carroll Gardens, and this place has become my favorite in the neighborhood (along with a few celebrities I see there too). It also happens to be in the running for my favorite Mexican in NYC (along with Javelina and Rocking Horse Cafe). Everything here is amazing. The frozen margaritas, served in a mason jar, are all fantastic. I love the passion fruit one particularly. The elote grilled corn here is phenomenal. I thought I had experienced the best elote known to America in Phoenix at Gallo Blanco until I came here, and even my Phoenix friends admit that this is better.But here's what really amazes me about Bar Bruno. The fish tacos. I have lived in Southern California for 10 years. I'm a regular at places like Wahoo's in Laguna Beach. When I moved to NYC, I never expected to find fish tacos this good here. The fish is freshly battered (think the best fish and chips you've ever had), and three tacos make for a very satisfying meal for me. All of my California friends that have visited agree that these are on par, if not the best.I also enjoyed the chilaquiles here, but it just seemed that it needed more meat or protein to make it a substantial dish. It is a perfect one for vegetarians.I'm still trying out things here, but so far everything is excellent. The service is friendly and impeccable. I rarely wait very long, even on a busy night. It's all good. I'm a huge fan.",5.0
"I don't get to Brooklyn very often, however my partner and I stopped in for a quick lunch. Service was fine, kale salad nicely done. I'f I was in the area again I might stop in or try someplace new.",3.0
"This place was a nifty find! I came here with my boyfriend for a birthday lunch date for myself, and we had a lovely experience. The staff were friendly and attentive, and the food was delicious. The grilled corn starter was amazing, I would've ordered two more for the hell of it!My boyfriend had the fish tacos which he said were great but a tad smaller than he imagined, and I had the pulled pork with a side of fries. The pork was juicy and cooked just right, and I loved that the whole sandwich comes sitting in a giant bowl of chili mole sauce. (We dipped those yummy, crispy fries in that sauce..and it was so worth it!!!) I would come back here again, just for the corn and the sauce! Haha!",4.0
"I would love to live near this place forever. Everything I ate here on multiple times-the fish tacos, the huevos rancheros, the burger, the carnitas tacos and the pork sandwich in the soup thing (sorry forgot the name-someone took a pic of it though it's like halved and placed in a bowl-so yummy) have been amazing. Their handcut fries are really good too, as well as their frozen margarita. Very yummy. Go here, nice atmosphere, outdoor seating once the weather is good and friendly people.",5.0
"Welcoming, warm atmosphere. Seated immediately on a Sat night. Great michelada, and consistent. Carnitas and fish tacos are very respectable. The churros and chicken wings are the 2 best things IMO, and are a must-order. I give it 5 stars for value - we went with 4 people and had multiple rounds of drinks and severely over-ordered on food and still came out under $200. We liked everything we ordered.",5.0
"Only stopped by for brunch drinks, but they were cheap before 4pm ($5 for a Bloody Mary) and delicious (oh so spicy with a generous stalk of celery). Good place to sit on the sidewalk and people/dog watch as well. Nice waitresses. Hope to be back to try the food, as the menu looked tempting.",4.0
"Solid kid friendly brunch spot! 2 couples and 2 toddlers wanted some brunch Saturday after our morning music class. Our friends who live in the neighborhood suggested Bar Bruno as they come here all the time. I was honestly skeptical for Mexican brunch with the kids but kept an open mind.We were seated immediately in a large round booth in the back - perfect! The kids were given colored pencils and paper. We got a corn split in half for the kids and guac to start. Everything was great. $5 drinks are awesome, too! I got an iced coffee that came in such a large carafe I had trouble finishing it! I got the huevos rancheros which was done perfectly! The potatoes that come with it remind me of the potato wedge French fries I used to have growing up. So good! My husband got the butterscotch pancakes which were ridiculously indulgent. More dessert than breakfast but he didn't complain! We both got some bacon on the side - his was crispier than mine but we all loved it. I would highly recommend brunch here, especially with kids!",4.0
"Fun atmosphere mixed with friendly service and thoughtful Mexican cuisine is the perfect combination for a good time. We were greeted by the hostess at the door, and even though it was busy, she was very accommodating and sat us within minutes. The margaritas were refreshing, the guacamole and homemade tortilla chips were delicious and the tacos were made with love. All and all, a very pleasing evening. We are definitely coming back!",4.0
"Good brunch, good drinks, good delivery. I love their tacos, and knocked one star off because when I've ordered fish tacos at times sometimes the fish had been a little rubbery (as in they rushed getting my food together - I still ate it, and liked it overall). Ultimately they're so cool and nice, and at the end of one particularly drunk night they actually let me play music off my phone (sorry guys). A great neighborhood spot!",4.0
"I'm updating this review primarily to express my concern that the address may be incorrect. While the street address is technically 520, I think they may want to change it to 420.

"Kale Dip for Days. This place is super cute and quaint and has an eclectic Mex/American menu. They've got delicious spicy wings- they are hot! The cojita cheese corn is delish, but the kale dip is seriously amazing. I had a burger which was delish, but I've also tried the fish/carnitas/short rib tacos which are also very delish. Recommend this great neighborhood spot.",4.0
"The service was horrible. Food is decent, but nothing special. We went for lunch today (a slow Friday afternoon). They didn't take our drink order until 15 mins after seating us at one of their sidewalk tables. The waiter barely came around, never brought our second round of drinks, never refilled our water (which would've come in handy when I got a wicked bite of jalapeño). I had to go inside and ask the bartender for a new carafe of water. There was no one inside, so I don't understand why the waiter didn't tend to his outside tables. We asked for the check and told them to cancel our second round of drinks because we were tired of waiting around. I wish we would've tried Jolie Cantina instead.",2.0
"Coming from southern CA, authentic Mexican food (no, Tex-Mex is not Mexican food) is always a challenge to find in NY. However, this is one of my favorite places in BK! This place is definitely worth the trip if you're coming from Manhattan or Queens. It's a great excuse to get good, cheap food that is outside of the tourist traps. Upon entering, everyone is really friendly and welcoming towards you! It's nice that it's not one of the snobbish places that turn you off. It's relaxing and welcoming here. Honestly a great Mexican place which is hard to come by here.The service is always amazing. Even when they're super busy, they still make it work which is something that doesn't happen to often in the area. The guac is a must! Definitely get it because it doesn't get much better than theirs. Pork belly tacos are super tasty and filling. Order a margarita (or two, or three) because you will NOT be disappointed. The cucumber margarita is one of my favorites because it is soooo refreshing. I would avoid the frozen margaritas because I've had better and they were pretty watered down in the end.4 stars because maybe I'm being a little biased, but coming from southern CA I expected a lot more from the fish tacos. They seemed a little bland and boring for my taste. On the many times I've been here, I've only ordered them once. I will maybe try them again when I go back but until then, I would hold out on the fish tacos. Definitely give this place a try if you're craving Mexican food. This is as good as it gets in the neighborhood!",4.0
"Randomly came across this place as I was in the neighborhood waiting to go to Lucali's. Had a few hours to kill so after Yelping it, decided to check it out. We got fries, kale dip and margaritas. Everything was great, especially the kale dip and margaritas. I absolutely loved the kale dip. My only complaint is I wish they had chicken tacos. Oh, and the music. If only they played better music. Regardless, I would recommend this place if you're in the area. I would love to come back here for brunch.",4.0
"Came in for a quick lunch during a FIFA game. Since there was no seating inside, we opted to sit outside - on a cold and rainy summer day. Reviews raved about the fish tacos so we toughed it out.We ordered a carafe of red sangria which served about 3 glasses and tasted like grape juice. The guacamole was delicious - definitely the highlight of the meal. The pumpkin seeds are a nice touch. The biggest disappointment were the fish tacos. The dish came with 3 nicely portioned tacos with a load of delish toppings, yet it had NO flavor. I added some chipotle spice for a kick, but the tacos alone are lacking big time.The service was great, can't doubt that and the ambiance inside seemed really fun.",3.0

"Amazing! Firstly our waitress was phenomenal haven't had such great service in NY in a while! When I  came into the restaurant for the tortilla soup, she informed me that it was chicken stock base, and recommended the hearty stew. Woooo! The most scrumptious vegetable base, complemented with steamed veggies. I'd love a bit of ancho heat, but that's because I love heat and spice with meals. My bf had the burger, they listened and made it well done! He enjoyed it, and the egg add on was cooked perfectly. And those fries, oh hello good memories of childhood!!!! However, what did us in was that cafe con leche. I'm never one to pin point such a pedestrian item against our whole meal, but the scent, the taste, the quality, and the lingering aroma was unlike any other.

"We had a craving for some Mexican food. Bar Bruno was in walking distance, so we made it happen.Started with corn all around. Really fantastic. I really loved the corn. For the main course, we went with the fish tacos and pork belly tacos. Both very good. I liked the pork better, while my wife preferred the fish. (I think they were both too different to go back and forth.) Throw in a can of Tacate, and you are all set. We finished the meal with some churros. Tasty stuff. Overall, we were pleased with the service and food. Go eat tacos. It's lovely! (Then grab a loaf of lard bread across the street for the walk home.)",4.0

"Bar Bruno is definitely off the beaten path, and was empty on a Saturday at noon for brunch on a rainy summer day. It is child friendly and they offer crayons for kids to color and have booster seats. The chairs are awful, right out of your junior high school classroom. Really weird. I am pretty sure those chairs are meant to be uncomfortable so that students pay attention. Well, I am out for a meal and I prefer to be comfortable!Service was pretty slow even though we were basically the only people dining inside. They do have outdoor sidewalk seating covered by an awning. The menu did not that everything was made to order so I sort of was prepared for it to take time. I found it difficult to get the waitresses attention, although she seemed nice. I came here for the $4 drinks at brunch-mimosas, bloody marys and frozen lime margarita. They are small but I can still dig the price.I had the chilaquiles verde, which just weren't 'verde' enough so I got a side of salsa verde for it. I tasted the maduros and they were good. They only have one unisex bathroom, but with a modern hand dryer that I hadn't seen before, so modern that my friend thought it was a paper towel dispenser that wasn't dispensing.They aren't doing anything particularly exciting here, so I don't see why I would return.",2.0

The kale salad is the best salad I have ever had. I look forward to coming to Brooklyn just to visit Bar Bruno to order this salad.  It is a great lunch place for families. Highly recommend a visit to Bar Bruno.,5.0

"Being an LA native, finding quality Mexican food in NYC can be a challenge. Although I wouldn't say Bar Bruno is 100% authentic, it is definitely of top quality and great flavors. I've had the carnitas and shrimp tacos. Both are very good. Would like maybe an extra shrimp in each taco as 2 shrimp doesn't quite do it. Don't skimp on the shrimp! The carnitas are loaded with pork and very satisfying. Always go for rice and black beans on the side as these might be better than what I've had in the west. My wife swears by the chilequiles (sp?) and always orders with chicken. Bar Bruno is a regular spot for us to start the weekend.",4.0
"Sometimes it pays to walk a bit further in order to discover something special.

"I had to update my review because I really do like bar Bruno; their food is solid and it's a nice place to have in the neighborhood. I love their tortilla soup and salads. I just can't bring my self to give it five stars because I think it's generally overpriced. I paid $20 for a shrimp salad. And it was good but not a salad with any special or particularly expensive ingredients in it (lettuce, corn, cucumber, white beans and shrimp-- that's it). Even if some of the items were a couple of dollars less it would make a big difference. I would be much more inclined to get that salad again, for instance, if it was $17 or $18.

"This place has a great variety of tacos.  My favorite was the spicy kimchi and steak tacos. They came out a bit soggy bc I think they sat a minute too long before the server grabbed them, but otherwise they were delicious. They are pretty spicy so don't order them if you can't handle the heat. The kale dip was good as well but pretty much tasted like any standard spinach and artichoke dip. The bar menu was unique and fun. I ordered a ""bloody beer"". It was a light pilsner-like beer with tomato juice and spices. It was still light even though it had all the ingredients. They have outdoor seating which is nice to enjoy the gorgeous neighborhood's beauty.",4.0
"Delicious food. I came here with my wife and with another couple, we were not really expecting much, but now I can not wait to go back.

"I'm a huge fan -- Period.  Nicest staff.  Great locals to start up random conversations with.  And, the best Mexican food in the neighborhood.  What more can you ask for?!  My secret tip:  everyone goes for the tacos because they an obvious delicious choice, but if you really want to taste perfection, order the chicken.  You won't be disappointed.",5.0
"Unlike my fellow yelpers below, I won't comment on the chairs or the hand dryer in the bathroom or the fact that they are busy or not or that they don't have enough Mexican food on the menu. Because...who cares? I don't think those are fair measures of a place. I've lived two blocks from here since it opened and it has always been solid. I've been about 6 or 7 times, and ordered delivery even more often.For brunch, the frozen margaritas (which are just about perfect!) and the variety of micheladas (which you probably can't find many other places) are great additions to the food. But this is not why I go. I go for the pancakes (and I even claimed I didn't like sweets, but their butterscotch pancakes are incredible!!!), the burger, the tacos, the queso fundido, the large salads, and the decent (though inconsistent and admittedly not-stellar) service. I will note, however, that I tend to be extra nice to waitstaff, and this waitstaff reciprocates, even if they are a bit slow. Bar Bruno also happen to be awesome at delivery--fast and yummy, with never a mess-up. For this price, the food and atmosphere, are terrific. And if you can't stand using a unisex bathroom or sitting on a ""school"" chair, ask for a booth, pee before you leave the house, or go somewhere else.",4.0

Topped with pickled onions, avocado, spiced mayo, all in a perfectly crispy yet soft sesame seed bun, it is a wonder to eat.  Two negatives; everything is a dollar or two more expensive than it should be, especially the drinks and there are no good lunch specials/happy hours.",4.0

We stumbled on this place accidentally when Pok Pok had a two hour wait.  We were so surprised with the food.  It was great!  The tortilla soup had the perfect amount of spice and giant avocado pieces.  The kale dip was a pleasant alternative to guac or spinach dip.  The pork belly tacos were crispy and had a spicy end - but not too spicy.  The waitresses were super nice and accommodating!  We can't wait to see what they have for us next time!,5.0

"My girlfriend and I stumbled upon this place by accident.  It was a balmy winter day so we decided to take a long walk from Manhattan to Brooklyn to try out this pizza joint (Lucali's) that everybody has been talking about.  After five miles of walking, we got to the door, only to find out they were closed for two weeks.  Needless to say, we were both utterly disappointed, hungry, tired, and in desperate need to pee...  We immediately searched for the first restaurant in sight and found Bar Bruno.  We were both pleasantly surprised and shared the grilled corn, guacamole and chips, and the grilled chorizo sandwich.  All of it was awesome.  The guac had bits of cheese mixed in and the chips were those strong, crunchy ones.  The corn was really good too but a bit over priced compared to similar corn I've had at other places.  The sandwich was awesome, manchego cheese, the chorizo was crispy and very tasty, the bread was soft and warm and I'll say it again... manchego cheese.  The seats aren't tight and music was just right creating a very nice atmosphere.  The service was also really good and fast.",4.0
"This little place is one block from me and I have never visited until last night. The food is excellent, fresh and very flavorful.

"I love this place. Amazing food and drinks, but have always been dissapointed by the service. Today was the worst. The bartender  gave out a round of tequila shots and when I asked for a small beer back, he said I could drink it without. I thought he was kidding, at least hoping he wasn't as rude as he came off. Unfortunately, he was not kidding and would not give me a bit of beer as a chaser. He told me I would need to pay for a full beer after being there all afternoon, spending lots of money. I love that place but the service is sadly often lacking. Was highly offended and will never tip him well again.",2.0
"Have been here a number of times already and it has become one of our favorite spots in the neighborhood.First of all, the staff is very friendly and accommodating.  Have been there with a bunch of friends (6 adults), 2 toddlers and an infant, and they were able to sit us all comfortably.  They also have a goodie bag for kids with crayons, little planes and toys (which I feel the adults enjoyed even more than the kids).Really like the decor, a bistro with a retro, soccer theme to it.The menu is not too ample, but it is solid and the food is fresh and tasty.  The appetizers are really nice (loved the ceviche and the morcilla with avocado) bur maybe a bit on the small side, but then, if you are going to order a sandwich, you don't really need too much of a appetizer, as the sandwiches are huge.  We have ordered different sandwiches and they are all fresh, delicious and come with a side of either French fries, salad or Israeli cous-cous.  As I mentioned, the sandwiches are huge and I always end up bringing home half of mine (not a complaint!! just a comment).As far as desserts go, the flan is creamy and rich and we also had the maple ice cream, which was delicious.Right now they are open only for dinner (and until late!!),but they will be opening for breakfast, brunch and lunch soon.Really hope that they keep up with the quality, prices and friendliness.",5.0

After talking to several people about what happened to me all convinced me this was very surprising. So I went back after raves about the burger. I tried it again and it was ok. Not really juicy but cooked to order medium rare. The bun is a average sesame bun the toppings ok and the fries seemed mostly small parts of fries.

The music is splendid, and the crowd is a nice, diverse set of people from around the neighborhood. The service is spot on; there was only about two waitresses and one bartender and they worked very hard to keep customers fed and happy. The most vital part of any restaurant besides running their operation smoothly is their food. Bar Bruno's food was absolutely terrible from start to finish. My wife ordered the burger which wasn't cooked to temperature as it was completely over done, dry, and tasted like cardboard. I ordered the skirt steak, which although was cooked right, it was way over salted and killed my palate. The french fries were standard, formerly frozen, they're the same thing you'd get at any local diner. Having said this, the prices are outrageously high for the quality of food received.  If you're a business that's trying to keep up with the other restaurants nearby, i.e., Prime Meats, Dubuque, Buttermilk Chanel, Fragole, you have to USE quality ingredients. You can't charge top dollar for abominable, tasteless food - period. Simply put, I will not be returning to this restaurant unless serious changes are made to their menu and their quality of ingredients. I do however, hope they succeed, as I hope all small businesses in the neighborhood succeed.  Having said that, Bruno needs to stop fooling their customers with a nice decor and warm atmosphere, and concentrate their energy on producing quality food.",2.0

"Didn't realize this place exists until I searched for something in that specific area on yelp, but great location. Sometimes you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of Smith and Court.

The quinoa veggie burger was unique and had all the things I love: quinoa, avocado, fries. The service was so so. Nice enough guy but a bit forgetful. I'll be back.",3.0

"I've only been here for brunch, but can't wait to come back for dinner! And more brunch! And lunch! And really for any food, whenever.Bar Bruno was bustling, but not outrageous, on a Saturday afternoon around 1 o'clock when my boyfriend and I strolled in for a bite. We were promptly seated by a very friendly server. ""How's life today?"" he asked. ""Life's good,"" I replied. ""Life IS good,"" he exclaimed back. Ok, then, awesome dude! The menu had a ton of tasty-sounding options...creative, yet accessible food, with that delicious Mexican flavor flair. For instance, a BLT with ""spicy mayo"" that I'm looking forward to trying. BF went with the huevos rancheros, which for $11 was a monster quantity of food -- accompanied, oddly, by french fries. Not that he was complaining; he downed the entire thing. I tried the frisee salad, which came topped with a fried egg and loaded with some yum sausage, ripe avocado, and flavorful shredded cheese. I ordered the dressing on the side, and am glad -- there was so much going on, I didn't even need it. Seriously, one of the best salads I've ever eaten.Service, from the endearing greeting to the very end of the meal, was perfect. The only reason I dock a star at all is because A) the bloody mary was meh; B) I've only tried this place once, and want to evaluate dinner before I consider the coveted five-stars.Seriously, though -- I strongly, strongly recommend. I'll even meet you there for brunch, whoever you are.",4.0
"I was very excited to try this place, but I left disappointed. The service was bizarre - granted our waitress was 'in training' but she was super weird - staring at us, awkward silences - and the food was not great. The space, however, is very nice and I could see it being a good place to go for drinks and maybe appetizers but I will not come back to eat again. Don't get me wrong, the food is edible, but there are much much better options available within walking distance. If you must eat here, avoid the super bland sandwiches.I really hope they get it together and improve the food, the place has a lot of potential and would be a great addition to the neighborhood...",2.0
"Bar Bruno is finally the neighborhood bar just a couple of blocks from our apartment that we've been waiting for. We've been a couple of times for dinner--no waiting, good food, and the best vodka tonics I've ever had. Seriously. We visited for brunch the first time last weekend. I got the breakfast sandwich--it came on a crunchy baguette with black bean spread, scrambled eggs, cheese, and sausage. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it! The service isn't amazing, the food won't blow your mind, but I love the vibe (it reminds me of the cafes in Italy) and the vodka tonics alone are worth the visit...especially when it's a 5 minute walk.",4.0

"I live a few blocks away from Bar Bruno.  Since they opened, I have walked by and admired the renovation, but the menu always seemed mediocre and uninspired.  I finally tucked in with a friend this morning for a late Columbus Day breakfast thinking maybe I was missing something and the food tasted better than it looked on the menu.  The atmosphere IS great - a welcome addition to the neighborhood -- intimate, great decor (vintage European Cafe).  with full bar, nice music.Unfortunately, the food is just as uninspired and mediocre as the menu looks.  I doubt I will ever come back.  There are way too many other choices in the neighborhood for great, fresh tasting food and this is not one of them.  It's a shame. Nothing about the meal was tasty.  I had the asparagus and goat cheese omelette.  My friend had the egg sandwich.  The egg sandwich was on toasted whole wheat.  Not particularly good bread.  The omelette was slightly overdone, the asparagus over-cooked.

Not bad this latin fusion food place.I had the corn on the cob with cheese. It was awesome. It was really good.I also had the thyme chicken as a main course. it wasn't so bad but it wasn't great either. Would probably not order it again.,3.0
"Didn't realize this place exists until I searched for something in that specific area on yelp, but great location. Sometimes you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of Smith and Court. I think the best word to describe this place is cozy. It looks like a typical brownstone space turned into a business: long and narrow and old looking. The food and drinks were decent. The quinoa veggie burger was unique and had all the things I love: quinoa, avocado, fries. The service was so so. Nice enough guy but a bit forgetful. I'll be back.",3.0
Received a very thoughtful reply from the business owner and are happy to give it another try. A small word from the owners goes a long way!,4.0
"A wonderful place, and so glad it's in my neighborhood!  Great frozen margaritas at a good price, and the fish tacos are light and tasty.  The waitstaff is courteous, friendly, and fun.  Highly recommended!",5.0
"I've only been here for brunch, but can't wait to come back for dinner! And more brunch! And lunch! And really for any food, whenever.Bar Bruno was bustling, but not outrageous, on a Saturday afternoon around 1 o'clock when my boyfriend and I strolled in for a bite. We were promptly seated by a very friendly server. ""How's life today?"" he asked. ""Life's good,"" I replied. ""Life IS good,"" he exclaimed back. Ok, then, awesome dude! The menu had a ton of tasty-sounding options...creative, yet accessible food, with that delicious Mexican flavor flair. For instance, a BLT with ""spicy mayo"" that I'm looking forward to trying. BF went with the huevos rancheros, which for $11 was a monster quantity of food -- accompanied, oddly, by french fries. Not that he was complaining; he downed the entire thing. I tried the frisee salad, which came topped with a fried egg and loaded with some yum sausage, ripe avocado, and flavorful shredded cheese. I ordered the dressing on the side, and am glad -- there was so much going on, I didn't even need it. Seriously, one of the best salads I've ever eaten.Service, from the endearing greeting to the very end of the meal, was perfect. The only reason I dock a star at all is because A) the bloody mary was meh; B) I've only tried this place once, and want to evaluate dinner before I consider the coveted five-stars.Seriously, though -- I strongly, strongly recommend. I'll even meet you there for brunch, whoever you are.",4.0
"I was very excited to try this place, but I left disappointed. The service was bizarre - granted our waitress was 'in training' but she was super weird - staring at us, awkward silences - and the food was not great. The space, however, is very nice and I could see it being a good place to go for drinks and maybe appetizers but I will not come back to eat again. Don't get me wrong, the food is edible, but there are much much better options available within walking distance. If you must eat here, avoid the super bland sandwiches.I really hope they get it together and improve the food, the place has a lot of potential and would be a great addition to the neighborhood...",2.0
"Bar Bruno is finally the neighborhood bar just a couple of blocks from our apartment that we've been waiting for. We've been a couple of times for dinner--no waiting, good food, and the best vodka tonics I've ever had. Seriously. We visited for brunch the first time last weekend. I got the breakfast sandwich--it came on a crunchy baguette with black bean spread, scrambled eggs, cheese, and sausage. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it! The service isn't amazing, the food won't blow your mind, but I love the vibe (it reminds me of the cafes in Italy) and the vodka tonics alone are worth the visit...especially when it's a 5 minute walk.",4.0
"This place is just down the street from us. Love the atmosphere, love the staff, very solid, tasty food. Excellent salads, we go here often when we dont want to cook.  My only complaint is that the quinoa burger seems like its deep fried which was disappointing when i ordered it trying to be healthy.

"I live a few blocks away from Bar Bruno.  Since they opened, I have walked by and admired the renovation, but the menu always seemed mediocre and uninspired.  I finally tucked in with a friend this morning for a late Columbus Day breakfast thinking maybe I was missing something and the food tasted better than it looked on the menu.  The atmosphere IS great - a welcome addition to the neighborhood -- intimate, great decor (vintage European Cafe).  with full bar, nice music.Unfortunately, the food is just as uninspired and mediocre as the menu looks.  I doubt I will ever come back.  There are way too many other choices in the neighborhood for great, fresh tasting food and this is not one of them.  It's a shame. Nothing about the meal was tasty.  I had the asparagus and goat cheese omelette.  My friend had the egg sandwich.  The egg sandwich was on toasted whole wheat.  Not particularly good bread.  The omelette was slightly overdone, the asparagus over-cooked.

"This place finally opened up a few weeks ago just a few blocks from my apartment in the location of the former Marius Cafe, and tonight my boyfriend and I stopped in to try it out!We're both vegetarian so we had somewhat limited options with their current menu, but I ordered and loved the Frisse Salad (mixed greens with sliced parmesan topped with a fried egg) and my boyfriend ordered and equally enjoyed some kind of cheese sandwich with vegetables and spiced mayonnaise.  The side of fries we shared was super delicious!  At the start of the meal we enjoyed fried plantains with a very tasty cliantro dip on the house, which was a nice touch!  The atmosphere was really nice- I loved the new floorplan compared to that of Marius Cafe and the school chairs and wood accents gave the place a relaxed and cool (but not TOO cool) kind of vibe.The staff seemed very nice too.I can definitely see coming down here many more evenings for dinner or just to enjoy some drinks at the bar.  And I can't wait until they start serving brunch (my top favorite meal of the day!).  I'd love to see this place do well, so stop in some time!",5.0
"Wow. Why haven't I been coming here all along??Bar Bruno is A+. Went on a Friday night and the place was comfortably attended, maybe because of the weather? With the tasty-looking menu and cool decor I was amazed that we didn't have to wait for a table. The drinks here are very good and the prices are totally decent - I  had a Tin Tan and a Miss Margarita and both were great. A refreshing change from your typical margarita. There is a complimentary order of chips and salsa brought to the table, and while it's a bit small, it's pretty good. We ordered chips & guac (a generous serving, very fresh for $6),  and the chicken wings to start. The wings were crazy - they were breaded and deep fried and came with two sauces for dipping, very different from your typical hot wing but very very good. Had a hard time choosing entrees since everything looked really good, but we ended up splitting an order of fish tacos and the vegan olla mole verde (not sure if I got that right...) which was basically like a vegetable stew in mole sauce with tortillas on the side. The tacos were fantastic, some of the best I've had in the city. The stew was pretty good, but I wanted it to be a little heartier, and maybe include beans/rice or something. Still, great that they have veg options on the menu.Also, the service was really great. The waiter helped give recommendations, and nothing arrived on the table til we finished with what we were currently eating. Which I appreciated, since we were sort of eating pretty slowly... so major points there! I will definitely return ASAP.",5.0

Love the decor too - it's not every restaurant in BK that is a shrine to George Best. 5 stars if the service wasn't a little slow sometimes.",4.0
"6 of us walked in at rush hour with no reservation. they moved people to seat us. free plantains. complimentary fries (because they moved us, too). very nice staff. great drinks (highly recommend the late night sans gin and the hemingway).",5.0
"I've been here a few times since it opened, and the consistency has been a little off.  First time, I had a delicious sandwich, a nice glass of wine, and I thought this was going to be my new hangout.  The next time, I couldn't even finish my meal.  The last time I went was just for drinks, and the mixed cocktails were not good.  I'll try it again soon, but my hopes aren't super high.  Reminds me a little of when it was a bagel place, then a croissant place, then a general breakfast place, then a lunch counter, then this (which I really want to work because of its proximity).  It doesn't even need to be incredible food to become a regular hangout, just consistent quality and attentive service.",3.0
"The food is quite good, but the service is just bizarre. Have been twice, once opening weekend, and once 5 weeks later, and both times, had to wait forever for weird things, waiters seemed totally confused, etc. Really enjoyed the burger and chicken sandwich though, and the fries are great.I will caution that the salads are oddly small for the price. Also, they are awfully proud of their beers--$8 for a Lagunitas in a bottle? No thanks.Overall, this place has lots of potential, but they need to get their service straight and bring down those drink prices if they want anyone to order them.",3.0
"Excellent food and drinks selection, very comfortable atmosphere. One of my favorite local restaurants.",5.0
"The perfect place to tuck in to a nice burger, sandwich or steak for lunch or dinner.  Very relaxed atmosphere and very kid friendly (when the kid is with us) and an excellent place to grab a couple beers when the kid is not with us.",4.0
"Oh Bar Bruno, how we want to like you!  When Bar Bruno opened, my husband & I were excited to have a corner bar/restaurant so conveniently close. We were immediately disappointed witht the food. (The exception are the fries = salty, fried deliciousness.) Since that first visit however, we've been back 4 times, mostly out of convenience and in hopes that the food would get better. This past Friday, we got a glimmer of hope witht the addition of fish tacos to the menu. Bottom line - nice local neighborhood spot for a bite to eat and a drink, but I wouldn't walk more than 3 blocks to eat there.",2.0
"Really solid food, both Mexican and French on the menu without trying to fuse the two.  Nice vibe, great spot for brunch or dinner or drinks (try the shishito peppers appetizer, a variation on spanish pimientos de padron).  The ONLY real gripe is the soundtrack - doo wop music? Really?  Appropriate for a Johhny Rockets but doesn't do this place a service.  Still, worth a trip or three....",4.0

"My boyfriend and I were foolish children and did not plan our Valentine's evening. We had no reservation, and it was slightly drizzly outside. Bar Bruno had opened around the time we were moving into our place in Cobble Hill. We decided to try it. They did not ask us for a reservation so I don't think they take them. The inside was adorable! The ceiling has those quaint tin ceilings that I love about NY. We say down right before the rush. When I say rush I mean like a tidal wave. Within ten minutes the entire place was full. There seemed to be just one waitress and she flew around the place with this huge pretty smile on her face trying to get everyone sorted. I started with the soup of the day, black bean, flavorful, not overly salted, and a nice portion, not too small not too big. We both had bottle beers to drink. For our main course I had the veggie burger(quinoa?), very good, and he had the mussles with fries. As I don't eat seafood I can't personally say if it was good, but he really liked it and he slurped on the liquidy leftovers at the bottom of the bowl. We had a giant profiterole for dessert. Why the 5 stars? You know when you go somewhere and the food is actually good? Like across the board good and not crazy weird?That's this place. The service was warm and as attentive as possible for how busy this place was. It was also cozy, not too loud and accessible.",5.0
I have always had great food and service every time I have been here. The Cocktails are fun and the small wine list works perfectly.,5.0
"Like other reviewers, I really wanted to like this place. The one star is for decor and location which is very inviting. I decided to go in for a drink and perhaps stay for dinner. Unfortunately, the service was not good. The bartender seemed overwhelmed -- not sure why because the bar was not full -- he did not even look at us to say hello. When we finally ordered, I had to wait another few minutes for my martini (until I had to ask for my drink). This, combined with a watered down martini in a half-full glass convinced me not to give dinner a try. I did not even finish the drink. I think this place needs new management, if they could get it together I would give it another try.",1.0
"Had an excellent lunch experience here today reading on my ipad.  Enjoyed the chicken sandwich and an iced tea -- attentive but not smothering service, great vibe, loved the quiet, understated atmosphere.  Great cookies at the bakery across the street for dessert.  :)",5.0
"We have been here twice for brunch (we live around the corner) and are now BIG fans! Try the BLT (with avocado!) and the best fries in the City. The quinoa burger is a winner as well. Smashing Bloody Mary with just the right proportions. Top notch cappuccino. In a neighborhood brimming with places to go this is our new favorite (and we are not easy). The plan is to try everything on the menu! Give it a shot, you won't be sorry.",5.0
"I was happily surprised, the food was good, the french fries cispy and delicious, tried the queso and the chicken sandwich and both were tasty, best of all we ran into 3 friends while there, clearly a good neighborhood hangout!",3.0
"I have been to Bar Bruno 3 times already since it opened and every time I am thrilled with the quality of the food and the service.  I live nearby in Red Hook and there aren't many restaurants that are as charming and delicious as this place.  I usually don't write reviews but after the steak poivre I ordered last night I just had to; it was the perfect blend of spicy pepper with mustard seed, cream and fresh parsley, bon!  Their chopped salad is delicious, so are their small plates, mussels, burgers and the fries are not to be missed.  I hope this place sticks around for a long time",5.0
"There was a group of four of us. We tried to go to Lucali first, but the wait was too ridiculous, so we went here. We were glad we did. We got complimentary plaintains with a tasty cilantro dip to start. We waited a bit for our dishes, but were distracted by our michaladas, and second plate of comped plaintains. And the wait staff gave us a round of drinks on the house because of the wait, so we couldn't complain. We waited about 35 minutes or so for our burgers and cheese sandwiches, and we housed them when we got them. They were really flavorful and filling. As a side, the fries were really crispy, and the couscous was really delicious. The staff still felt bad about the wait, so we got dessert on the house too! The pistachio gelato and flan were delicious. My friend usually hates flan, but she love this. It's their first week or so, so there are kinks to be worked out, but they were more than accommodating, generous and welcoming. Can't wait to go back!",5.0
