"The food here is great, but I honestly can't imagine that I'll return here for brunch. Oh my goodness, when I say this place is cramped, I really mean IT. IS. CRAMPED! I honestly felt like I was in a scene on Broad City making fun of how cramped this hip Brooklyn brunch spot was. Getting seated was hysterical and certainly made for an uplifting start to the experience. Now onto the experience! There isn't really table service, you order and pay (including tip) at the counter and wait for your food to be delivered to you. We had to ask a few times for napkins and place settings and I was brought a dirty water glass so then I had to maneuver my way back out of this bizarre seating arrangement to grab myself a clean one. As for the food, it was fantastic. I ordered the shakshuka (which was actually the entire reason we decided to try this place) which was amazing. I added feta to my plate and my dish came to nearly $17! That's pretty steep for essentially eggs in a tomato sauce. Eggs were done to perfection, the sauce had a nice spice to it, and two slices of bread are included to sop up all the saucy goodness. Upon leaving, my friend accidentally knocked the sugar packets off another table (due to it being so cramped) and instead of offering to help, the workers there kind of just awkwardly stared as we picked things up off the floor before finally making an exit. I didn't have a bad experience by any means, I just don't think the food was phenomenal enough to justify the price and I personally found the atmosphere to be uncomfortable. Great shakshuka, though.",3.0
"Delicious food and excellent service. When our brunch plans fell through at a nearby establishment, friends and I called re.union to see how long the wait was. The person over the phone said that a party was just about to clear out and that they would hold the table for us since we were on our way. So nice!Shakshooka - smelled kind of like a lasagna. Warm and hearty without being too heavy.Chocolate chip pancake - gooey and oh so delicious. Had the consistency of a pound cake.Schnitzel sandwich - that battered chicken was so crispy and flavorful! The condiments were a good compliment/addition without overpowering the chicken.Mediterranean omelette - it was good but didn't quite wow me. Slightly bland, but I liked the salad and bread that came with it.Service was superb! It appeared to be cafe style so I didn't expect anyone to wait on us once we got our food. I asked one of the gentlemen where I could get a spoon, and he eagerly got one for me and told our table to let him know if we needed anything else. Everyone was so pleasant! High on my list of places to which I'll return.",4.0
"This is a great neighborhood spot for a casual brunch, light lunch or breakfast. It's a small spot with seating that is sort of first-come, first-served (they may or may not take reservations but when you come in, there's no hostess and you just order at the counter and seat yourself). I like the avocado toast - it's a small-to-medium sized portion with hearty bread and comes with a poached egg and potatoes. The potatoes are nothing to write home about but the rest is delicious. I also like the shakshuka and quinoa salad. Great coffee. Sometimes good people-watching also. All in all a good neighborhood meeting spot.",4.0
Cute corner cafe that is perfect for reading or studying. I came here on a Sunday afternoon and loved it because there was so much natural light and it was relatively quiet (I personally hate reading at Toby's because it's so loud and very difficult to even nab a seat). They also have good brunch options my personal favorite being the shakeshuka - though they make it less watery and spicier than most other places. Update: just came again and tried the avocado toast and herb omelette. Would highly recommend both they were delish. The omelette comes with a bun (it's more like an omelette sandwich) and the bun was delightfully fresh),4.0
"Re.union looks like a designer's playbox - soft bright lights, olive and pastel shades, neat hand-scrawled chalk art and menus. We called ahead on Labor Day to make sure they were open, hoping to find the perfect location for the perfect last meal of vacation. By the time we three walked through the unassuming open door, we were sold. The menu is delightfully foreign and familiar at the same time. Classics like granola, eggs, and toast are paired with Israeli salad, shakshuka, and schnitzel. There's room for everyone in the family here, both palate and space-wise. We settled down in a corner near the cubby wall with Lattes, Iced Chai, and an oh-so-flaky Almond Croissant, continuing to admire the picturesque way everything was set up before realizing as well that the bottom-most cubbies contained pull-out boxes filled with toys for the young'ns. Functional AND cute. The waitstaff came out one at a time to bring us our food as it became ready. We had decided that the Almond Croissant was the best decision of the morning when the Reunion Breakfast was brought out, and we quickly had to change our minds because this colorful, paintbrush palette of a dish took the cake. The canvas? A basket of soft, crusty bread. Among the homemade dips in the tray were tahini, beet, jam, butter, and olives. Accompanying this was a plate of scrambled eggs (just the right amount of fluffy) and Israeli salad (refreshingly tart). Before we even had time to finish feasting our eyes on this dish, the Avocado Toast and Yogurt & Granola came out as well and we hardly knew how to capture everything with our eyes, let alone phones. Hastily the food pictures were taken, and even more hastily our metal forks descended on the plate closest to us. Everything was visually stunning, and not overwhelmingly seasoned. The Avocado Toast had a good ratio of bread to avocado and egg, but I wish there were slightly more sprouts. Alone, any of the components in the Yogurt & Granola could have been your typical high-quality ingredients, but together with shreds of coconut, seasonal fruits, and honey, this was a bite to behold. Chai lattes can easily err on the side of too sweet or too herby, but this one was just right for me. They brew Stumptown coffee, and it outshone most of the other places we went to while in NYC (the West Coast is another story). A squat metal water dispenser sits in the corner near the bathroom, with glass cups sitting adjacent.Restroom-goers are greeted with a Shakespearian monologue on the door. The restroom itself is clean and comfortable, doubling as a storage room but managing to keep things largely out of the way. There's a small step stool for those that need it to reach the sink.We barely managed to finish our food and felt we got our money's worth for the quality and quantity of food. As this is a less touristy spot, we felt relaxed the whole time and found the employees to be great as well. A return trip, even just for a cup'a joe, will be necessary.",5.0
"Mixed feelings regarding this friendly and quiet cafe in Williamsburg.Stopped by here on a lazy Sunday afternoon, hoping to find something that fits the bill of late lunch/early dinner/breakfast for dinner. The cafe is beautifully designed, and calls for a ""no laptops - talk to a friend!"" rule on weekends.I ordered a shakshuka to go, and got a little bit of sticker shock at the markup from $13 to $17.  The cashier explained that the shakshuka is slightly marked up since it is served with a complimentary coffee/tea as part of the cafe's weekend brunch option. While part of me was not surprised (insert commentary on the aftereffects of Wburg gentrification here), I was still a little miffed. As one normally is when there is a steep markup of relatively inexpensive ingredients.Upon opening the shakshuka in the apartment, I noticed that the shakshuka barely filled up half of the tiny restaurant container. And for some odd reason, only the yolks were visible. The egg white seemed to have disappeared among the small chunks of eggplant and arugula leaves.I will credit the cafe for the super friendly cashier and staff, and for providing a yummy spiced yogurt, arugula side salad and rustic bread, but I was very disappointed at the shakshuka itself. Incredibly small takeout portions for the price of weekend brunch.",3.0

"Excellent place to sit down for brunch or run in and get your daily cup of coffee. They serve stumptown coffee including nitro cold brew, which every coffee lover should try. It was not too crowded on a Sunday morning and it was peaceful inside. The wall decor is adorable and plating is also pleasing. The staff was friendly and did not make any errors. I took my family out to brunch and every dish was fantastic. I has scrambled eggs with Israeli salad and it came with a basket of bread and a variety of spreads. Perfection! My father ordered the shakshuka and my mother ordered fruit and yogurt. Although they were all amazing my brother's schnitzel sandwich took the crown.

"Road tripping last week up the east coast and stayed in this wonderful neighborhood of Williamsburg in Brooklyn.  Hotel Le Jolie was our bed for the night which I will review next.  Anyway, we checked in around noon and were pretty hungry.  So we walked around the corner to this little spot.  Appearance: clean and hip.  Took a look at the large menu up above the cash register and fell in love with the items described.  The two very attentive guys that greeted us also answered my questions about the menu items.  I was tied between the Avocado toast and the Balkan.  One of the gentlemen recommended the Balkan and said it's a local favorite.  I believe he said it's his too.  So, I took his recommendations.  Other orders for our group were the Schnitzel and the PB & homemade jam (we had a child in the house). Sat down and enjoyed the ample view of the town through the large top to bottom windows that encircle this corner cafe.  Oh, I forgot to mention that I ordered tap water and was directed to these tin jugs for self serve water.  They were filled with delightful lemon-lime enhanced tap.  Already this place had 3 stars in my book just by appearance and service.  Now about the food...So, our order came out pretty quickly.  The guy who helped us in the front also brought our food to the table.  Our plates looked presentable, clean and yummy.  Now for the taste.  I have to say that my sandwich was the best I've had in quite some time.  I was overly impressed!  It was overstuffed (never a bad thing) with perfectly seasoned and grilled eggplant, caramelized onions, fresh arugula and tomatoes, tahini and smothered with a cheese which was described as Turkish feta but tasted like the most creamy, delicious goat cheese.  I'm still thinking about this amazing sandwich 4 days later.  The schnitzel was perfect as well.  I tasted it and it was delicious.  Also tasted the PB&J and it was great!  Overall, I was so impressed with this little place that I came back the next morning and enjoyed a delicious breakfast.  The same gentleman was there that morning and took our order.  What a nice guy!  I did not get his name but he was so courteous and just plain cool!  Breakfast: lattes!  So good!  I had an almond milk hot latte In a nice cup with some foam art on top.  (I love all foods but I have a knack of sticking mostly to vegan or vegetarian foods) Almond croissant and chocolate croissant were fresh and so good.  My hubs ordered an iced latte which was served in a mason jar and the shakshuka which I tasted and was out of this world!  If I lived in Brooklyn, I'd have breakfast and lunch here everyday!  Can't say enough about this little joint.  Next time I'm in NY this will be first on my list, no doubt!  YES!!!!",5.0
"UPDATE: The owner, Eldad, responded to say they were making changes in their crew and were working towards greater consistency.

Sat down and enjoyed the ample view of the town through the large top to bottom windows that encircle this corner cafe.  Oh, I forgot to mention that I ordered tap water and was directed to these tin jugs for self serve water.  They were filled with delightful lemon-lime enhanced tap.  Already this place had 3 stars in my book just by appearance and service.  Now about the food...So, our order came out pretty quickly.  The guy who helped us in the front also brought our food to the table.  Our plates looked presentable, clean and yummy.  Now for the taste.  I have to say that my sandwich was the best I've had in quite some time.  I was overly impressed!  It was overstuffed (never a bad thing) with perfectly seasoned and grilled eggplant, caramelized onions, fresh arugula and tomatoes, tahini and smothered with a cheese which was described as Turkish feta but tasted like the most creamy, delicious goat cheese.  I'm still thinking about this amazing sandwich 4 days later.  The schnitzel was perfect as well.  I tasted it and it was delicious.  Also tasted the PB&J and it was great!  Overall, I was so impressed with this little place that I came back the next morning and enjoyed a delicious breakfast.  The same gentleman was there that morning and took our order.  What a nice guy!  I did not get his name but he was so courteous and just plain cool!  Breakfast: lattes!  So good!  I had an almond milk hot latte In a nice cup with some foam art on top.  (I love all foods but I have a knack of sticking mostly to vegan or vegetarian foods) Almond croissant and chocolate croissant were fresh and so good.  My hubs ordered an iced latte which was served in a mason jar and the shakshuka which I tasted and was out of this world!  If I lived in Brooklyn, I'd have breakfast and lunch here everyday!  Can't say enough about this little joint.  Next time I'm in NY this will be first on my list, no doubt!  YES!!!!",5.0
"UPDATE: The owner, Eldad, responded to say they were making changes in their crew and were working towards greater consistency. I'm happy to say it's a success :) my drink is now way more consistent and I don't have to worry about how my coffee is going to taste that particular morning!--this is my coffee place before work, and i always get the same thing during the summer, iced soy latte. i've come to learn that depending on who the barista is, it'll taste different - sometimes it's actually perfect, and sometimes, like today, a new barista pulls a weak ass shot and it's like kiiinda coffee-flavored milk (like, was that a double?), or it's over/underextracted and bitter or sour. i've come to get kinda scared when people i've never seen before are working the espresso machine cause i never know what i'm going to get.i love the oatmeal raisin scones. croissants are from balthazar, and they make solid plain ones but the almonds are really bready in the center, and i prefer mine flaky. that's just personal preference though. beautiful shop, nice people, near work = i'm a repeat customer, but i do wish baristas would be more consistent.",5.0
"I live really close to re.union and am a regular customer. The food is really high quality and I love that it's a coffee shop meets restaurant. The owner is always around and the place has really nice ambiance. The only thing that bothers me is that they have a no laptop rule on weekends, which I understand to some degree if it was busy. But I came here this morning to get some work done and enjoy their food and was surprised when a bus boy asked me to put my laptop away. The place wasn't remotely full or busy. It was off-puting, as the reason I love this place so much IS that it's a coffee shop with great food.",4.0
"Reunion, you really outdid yourself this morning. These pancakes are blowing my mind and I have to tell the world. Happy 1 yr anniversary!",5.0
Really cute coffee shop! Re.union has all your typical cafe stuff (including Dough doughnuts!) plus a small breakfast and lunch menu that's Mediterranean inspired. I had the shakshooka (which came with a small israeli salad and yogurt) and my fiance ordered the herb omelette sandwich. Both are highly recommended. Will definitely be one of my go-to cafes in the neighborhood.,5.0

"Very nice place, pretty new in the neighborhood.   We ordered the apple tart breakfast item with a Turkish coffee and cold brew.  They have big seating area, great brunch options and free wifi.   It's a nice little place to go for a break or to read a book but it's not a cheap place.   Even on a rainy day, it's kept clean.   Definitely worth a couple of return trips.",5.0

"UPDATE: The owner sent me a message apologizing for the burn; he was the one who gave me the towel at the counter. Apparently the employee who forgot to mention the heat was new. But he was accompanied to our table by another female employee...Still, for the apology I will go back up to 4. ----------------There are so many things I liked/wanted to like about this place, but then I got burned. Literally. I ordered the incredible green breakfast, which came with a delicious salad with fresh cheese, a frittata-like egg thing with potatoes and greens, and some sweet pesto on the side that was great on top of the eggs. My friends both ordered the schnitzel sandwich, which had some kind of lemony delicious on it. They very much liked theirs too! And they gave us a sweet bread bowl for the table that even included a croissant that was quite nice. The vibe of the place was cute, and we barely had to wait in a line even on a Sunday at 1:30 pm. It was a little confusing in terms of how the food would come to us/how much to tip when you came to the counter. I was thinking it would be something where they'd call out your name, but it turned out to be that they brought it to the table. Just a heads up on that. So I would have given them 4 stars for sure, but here's what went down: when they brought my food to the table they sat down all our food in front of us/we said thanks/they headed away. We all began to dig in. And then I bumped my hand on the handle of the cast iron pan on my plate containing my eggs. And SCREAMED! It burned me. A day later, I've still got a red spot on my palm. For all the times I have gone to restaurants in which the waiter tells me to be careful, the plate is hot (while they hold it with their own hands) and it's really not that bad, this one time in which an INCREDIBLY hot object is put in front of me, no warning. Additionally, when I went up and asked for some ice for my palm, no one apologized, even the person who had sat it in front of me without a warning. They did give me ice and a towel, though! Maybe because the manager-looking guy was over there when I asked for the ice they didn't want to reveal their error? If they had apologized, I probably would have gone 4 stars. I'm definitely not writing them off, as the food and experience were overall good. It seems like the employees maybe just need to work a little more on their game.",4.0
"Yum! I've lived in NYC for 22 years and last Saturday was my first time in Williamsburg. I was overwhelmed by all the cute cafes in the area, but my friend suggested we meet here :)The inside is so cute. It's small, but manages to get so much sunlight, so it's nice and cozy and has great natural lighting. I'm a huge carnivore so I was a little distressed when trying to pick something to eat (they don't have any meat dishes). I got the avocado toast which was honestly very very good, and the side potatoes were perfectly cooked and seasoned.I'm not a huge coffee/espresso drinker because I have a weak stomach (7/10 my stomach can't handle coffee) so whenever I drink a coffee/espresso and don't have to run to the bathroom is a good day. It was a good day. I ordered a mocha and it was perfect. Not too sweet and just... perfect. HAHA. I'm honestly surprised that there aren't many reviews for this place. Would absolutely recommend! :)",4.0
"I just had the best pumpkin spice latte I've ever had. What a gem! We stumbled upon this place while staying near Williamsburg and chose it as our pre-airport/last breakfast spot. So glad we did!! The iced latte and the black coffee are also 5/5 stars. The almond croissant made my dreams come true...the perfect flaky pastry to sweetness ratio. My companion raved about the steel cut oatmeal and I wish I could take it back home and save it for a cold winter morning. It was topped with roasted apples! My other friend got an omelette sandwich and described it as ""fresh and savory with a well crafted, soft bread."" Lastly, the yogurt and granola was a classic that stood up against the other delicious treats we had. Creamy, tart, fresh berries, dates and honey. We are in breakfast food heaven!! The ambiance (relaxed mix of students and elders, English and French, laptops and paperbacks) added to this peaceful, blissful, and necessary Brooklyn morning. Thanks re.union!",5.0
"Pictures are truly misleading. This is just a coffee shop (such as starbucks) not a sit down restaurant. Nothing I consumed was good. Had a bland egg sandwich, avocado toast, awful burnt tasting coffee, and I nibbled on what they called a salad (it's just a side topping aka salsa). Nothing had flavor and my avocado wasn't all that great (a bit bitter), I could see the rotting parts on it as they just mashed it in. Overall I'd say if you want extremely expensive cafe junk then this is for you, if not then keep far away.",2.0
"This is a review about the atmosphere and not the food, since I didn't order any, though I've heard the brunch is very good.I went here on a Sunday afternoon.

I ordered a decaf coffee (around $3.45) and was going to sit down and do some work when I learned that laptops are prohibited on weekends. I don't know if this is a Williamsburg trend or what, but it was disappointing, and I find the laptop ban at coffee shops / cafes pretentious. I would understand the ban at a fancier restaurant.I'm having difficulties finding a cozy coffee shop or cafe in Williamsburg where I can read and use my laptop on my days off, which happen to be weekends. The experience today (not my first in this neighborhood) made me want to move back to Manhattan. No offense, to all the Williamsburg fans out there.Also, the staff at re.union were not rude but not warm, either. No smiles. When I asked for a napkin, the man working behind the counter seemed annoyed that I didn't see the napkins on the shelf by the milk.

"There aren't enough good things to say about this place.  It's run by a super nice couple, and has only been open for a month or so.  So far I've had a few of the soups, the kale salad, the Israeli salad, and the beet cured salmon.  Every single one was delicious.  The kale salad is definitely my go to menu item.  The quinoa is perfectly seasoned, the kale lightly sautéed, and who doesn't love avocado?As far as coffee goes, I haven't been let down yet.  I generally go for a cortado, it's always been solid.It's a great place to go, sit for a while, munch, and get some work done.",5.0
"Ordered a Grilled Cheese sandwich and it was cute, the interior is good and the staff is quite friendly and social with their customers. Nothing but good vibes all around.",5.0
"Said that the shackshooka was going to be served with a salad and yogurt, we never got that. Although it was good and the place was super cute, it was overpriced and not filling.",3.0
The grill cheese is the best with bacon and the omelette  sandwich was amazing. I also had the hot chocolate which was delicious!,5.0
"I just recently visited re.union for brunch, and then again for lunch today, and I have to say that I'm a huge fan. They serve Stumptown coffee, so there's that. And their menu is small but phenomenal. I highly recommend their Shakshooka, it was absolutely delicious, but really everything looks great. I also love the environment. It's a little Wes Anderson, a little bit European, a mix of modern and whimsical... well, I guess it's just a lot Brooklyn. Also, the manager (or who I am guessing is the manager) is extremely friendly and welcoming. Lastly, they have free wifi. This may be one of my new freelance spots. The only reason I haven't given it 5 stars is because it's a tad more expensive than my usual hangs - but nothing out of Williamsburg's new price point.",4.0
"What a gem! Food is delicious and the place is beautiful. Ate there a few times and tried different dishes, all were fresh and very tasty. I especially enjoyed the Mediterranean breakfast, shakshuka, fancy grilled cheese sandwich (with tomato jam!!), and Stumptown coffee! The staff and owners are very friendly and the free wifi is a big plus!",5.0
Excellent breakfast and coffee. Had the shakshuka and it was one of the best I've ever had. Roommate had the Nutella sandwich and loved it.,5.0
"The food never disappoints. Inna, Eldad, and the kitchen crew put so much effort and care into every dish, and you can definitely tell with each bite. The herbs omelette sandwich, shakshooka, warm kale salad (add chicken!), and schnitzel are my all time favorites. Can't go wrong with any of those.",5.0
"Dropped by for lunch during a nearby event and ordered a stunning tuna sandwich that was like a salad niçoise on toast. Plus Stumptown cold brew. Excellent food, cozy atmosphere and very friendly staff. Wish I lived nearer!",5.0
Delicious and thoughtful food that is fresh and tasty. Went for brunch and everyone was blown away by their dishes (pretty sure we had one of everything among 4 of us) Coffee was good as well and it's a really cute atmosphere. Highly recommended and I can't wait to go back for sandwiches/salads!,5.0
"Awesome staff, ambience, food and real coffee! Great for week day breakfast and weekend brunch. So awesome to have a local that opens at 7.30am! Only minor gripe is they don't bring utensils out to table with food so when their gorgeous food comes to the table, you have to leave it and pick up your own knife and fork. Otherwise this place is perfect!",5.0
"Delicious shakshooka! Get the special with added eggplant and feta. Great sandwiches, too. The owner and staff are super friendly. I go to this place all the time and they always welcome me with a smile.",5.0
"Food is very good and the owners are incredibly nice. The best part for us is that it is kid friendly.  They have kids meals (I love that), highchairs and even TOYS!",5.0
Went for brunch. Delicious extremely creative food. Servers went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable. Love the interior to,5.0

"Front staff initially welcoming. Downhill from there. Layout poor - design means that patrons have to climb over each other/stand on your seat to get in/out/place order/go to bathroom etc.  Food very disappointing.  Lukewarm cappuccinos. Egg dish served undercooked on limp arugula. Had to ask for the bread side and it came much later after eggs cold and the bread was neither fresh nor toasted.  It was stale!! All in alll, a waste of time and money. NEVER AGAIN.",1.0
