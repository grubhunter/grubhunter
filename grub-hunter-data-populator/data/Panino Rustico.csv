Had the best lunch today at Panino Rustico. Everything was excellent from service to food .Can't wait to go back!,5.0
"Great spot, they have a few outdoor tables for the warmer times of year. If the hipsters ever find out about this place we'll have to put a wall around the neighborhood.Closed on Sundays, FYI.",5.0
"I am obsessed with their creamy basil dressing! I ordered the turkey panini with fontina, bacon and avocado on a everything flatbread. Presented with a small side of mixed greens and the panini was hot pressed to my liking. Let's not forget their corn chowder soup!!! It's creamy and delicious. I also had their grilled chicken panini with avocado and goat cheese with balsamic glaze. I wasn't a fan of the glaze since it was too overwhelming. Other than that, everything else that I tried lived up to my expectations. Just keep in mind that they only take cash.",4.0
"Walked in today since this place was chilling in my bookmarks for a while, and since it's close by I figured why not? Soo glad that I came in to finally try this place since I know that this won't be another place that I'm crossing off my bookmarks and forgetting.Although they are well known for their paninis, don't hesitate to get their savory crepe. It truly is SAVORY & cheaper ;). I ordered the last one down the list (fontina, turkey, basil sauce) and from start to finish it was delicious. These crepes are shaped like a rectangle as opposed to some cylindrical ones that you might see/eat. From the outer crisp corners, you can taste how delicious the batter is. From the middle, you can taste generous chunks of turkey and cheese. The basil sauce they put on top is lip licking good & I wouldn't mind if they did a few more squiggles of that on my crepe.I also had a bite of my boyfriend's panini (proscuitto, mozz, tomato & basil pesto sauce). It was a great panini, but I still prefer my crepe over his. Also had 1.25 mini canoli's to finish off and they were great. P.S. I think the online menu prices might be cheaper than what it actually is. P.P.S They have really cute local & regular customers who sing along to the music playing",5.0
"Absolutely love this place and the BYOB! A little drink here and there makes everything more enjoyable.I've had the smoked salmon panini everyone raves about and I must say, they're absolutely right. It deserves every compliment anyone can think of. I've also had the prosciutto with mozzarella, tomato, and basil pesto. Is that not a perfect combination?! This place uses extremely fresh ingredients and everything is of high quality. Even their bread has the perfect crunch!I've had their smoothies before. Up to par with their food.Only thing I wish was different was the size of the restaurant. It is extremely popular so it gets a bit crowded sometimes. Feel like everyone's on top of each other.",4.0
So happy to have found this place. Delish! The waitresses are cute and sweet.  Food was on point! I will be back!,5.0
"The panini was amazing! I am huge on toasted bread, but not so much on deli meats, but to my surprise, it was far better than I expected. We ordered P12, P20, and P35, and P35 was by far the best of the 3. P35 had turkey, bacon, avocado, and the basil dressing. Usually, I'm not a fan of turkey meat, but I was blown away by how well the layers went together. The basil dressing was wonderful and when paired with the avocado, it moistened the turkey and melted in my mouth, creating a really smooth and pleasant texture. The crisped bacon provided a contrast in textures--and honestly, bacon makes everything taste better. If the panini was 2% insufficient before the bacon, the bacon completed the deal and kicked it up a notch. It was definitely one that I would make the commute to Brooklyn for again and again!The other 2 we ordered was alright, but definitely lacking in comparison to P35. The goat cheese in P12 was not to my liking, but goat cheese is one of those ingredients that is an acquired taste. The sun-dried tomatoes were really fragrant--by scent alone, P20 was definitely a winner, but for me, it wasn't enough to pull the entire sandwich together and elevate it the same way P35 was elevated. Overall, this place is definitely worth trying!!",5.0
"Such an nice place to find among a residential area !My boyfriend and I went to this cute little Panini spot in hopes for a good sandwich and we were not disappointed ! I ordered the Chicken, Pepper and Mozzarella Panini and it was delicious ! He ordered something along the lines of a Reuben. The menu has about 45 Panini choices and they also serve breakfast ( 2nd breakfast ?;) ) !There is outside seating and seating indoors with cute petite tables. The inside of the café/bistro is modern and inviting. The waitresses are nice and  helpful -- a casual feel to the service. The bathroom was tidy ( which is always a plus). Each Panini was about 9 -11 bucks, came with a tiny salad. Overall it was a awesome find and delicious spot I'll go back to. Cat approved !",5.0
"The service here is seriously so noteworthy. The girls are so pleasant and attentive! Came here Thursday evening, was the warmest since winter was happy to see we could sit outside already. Came with a friend we mentioned wanting to share a soup and they split it for us which is so appreciated. The food is just remarkable, really. All fine quality ingredients. Great dining experience all around!",5.0
"The paninis here are a work of art!! Very authentic and delicious. I got the p41 with grilled chicken, avocado, and sundries tomatoes. The sundries tomatoes were a little sour for my taste, but the grilled chicken and cheese part of the sandwich was amazing! The frozen hot chocolate is also great quality.",4.0
"Came here on a cold week night. Place is located in a residential area, as this is the only eatery on the block. The place is small and jam packed with patrons, wait time wasn't too long. There's a large selection of paninis, along with their other popular bruschetta and crepes choices as well. Me and my friend decided to share P.18, P.38, and the tomato basil brushcetta. All the dishes came out warm, fresh, and tasty. The paninis were savory and delicious with the right portions, we devoured it within minutes. This will be our new go-to spot when we are in the neighborhood.",4.0
"Stop by with family for an afternoon lunch. I had an excellent chicken panini with fresh mozzarella and broccoli rabe. It had a small side of arugula salad. There are many many more panini to choose from. The major downside is its in a neighborhood where parking can very difficult depending on the time and day. I found legal on street parking around the block. I'm not sure if they offer valet parking, which common for Brooklyn restaurants.Lastly, cash only!",4.0
"Small little cafe located on 17th ave. Great place for breakfast, lunch, brunch, desserts, or just plain oh  coffee. I've been to Panino Rustico twice so far I've enjoyed both visits. Everything is extremely affordable and service is great. Everyone is just so friendly there! It's CASH ONLY but they have an ATM available. Although it's a small cafe they also offer outdoor seating. Another plus is BYOB! Would I go back? Most definitely!",4.0
"Been in a little explorative mood lately, so I've been walking around the neighborhood looking for some decent food.Popped into Panino Rustico upon Yelp recommendations, and ordered the P20 (you can just tell them your order by number). You can dine in here, which is great, but they are cash only. The waitstaff were friendly enough; they asked if I wanted water while I waited. The P20 is a panini with grilled chicken, red pepper, basil pesto, arugula and mozzarella. The panini bread itself is nice - the crunch is there and provides a good texture contrast to the fillings. The grilled chicken is a bit bland and tough, but the rest of the sandwich comes together quite nicely. Overall, the panini is very solid, and if you live nearby, I definitely would recommend it, but it's not some place to trek out for. They also have smoothies, crepes, espresso drinks, so maybe I'll be back for a crepe!",4.0
"PROS:- The Paninis are really good!!- P24 - Mozzarella, Basil, Proscuitto, and Sundried Tomato Panini- Strawberry crepe - they offer to split the crepe in half for us because they noticed we were sharing it.- Has tables outside if you want to lounge in the sun.- Good Ice CoffeeTHE OKAY:- Earl Grey Tea- Iced Green Tea- Bruschetta plate - I know its not the same as crostinis but I like crostinis better because the bread is not as thick.CON:- Cash ONLY",4.0
"Pros:Specifics: Grilled chicken and mozzarella or goat cheese, tomato basil with cheese, prosciutto and cheese, turkey and avocado are genuinely fantastic. The craft:The bread the ingredients the temperature its made all make for perfect sandwich one you're rolling your eyes back from. New additions:They now have Everything style paninis ( like the bagels) and they make it even better ( and for some reason a bit bigger). Good2know:If u eat there they give u a free glass of complimentary wine its hard not to feel at peace in there cute little outside area. Also it is BYOB so u can bring whatever u want if u want more than a glass ( also call ahead to confirm im not sure policy on if they always give the glass but im almost positive). NOT the main event: Creamy basil and pesto sauces are excellent. Cream of brocoli soup is very good but overpriced which brings us to.... Cons:GETTING JIPPED:Way too expensive, a panini 8 or 10 i understand but 10,12 plus is an insult completely! With tax it can be 14 for one panini what the hell! Especially because I happen to know for a fact that their profit is HUGE! Also if u don't add the toppings like ( avocado or tomato ) they think you're stupid and make the sandwich tiny with less meat in it as if u don't realize that topping or no topping the sandwich shouldn't look like a school lunchSTAFF ISSUES: The girls make up prices sometimes so make sure u ask her why your 3 ingredient panini cost 12 plus bucks. A lot of times customers dont want the specific panini options the menu writers have prepared and when u make your own they try to trick u. Sundried tomato soup is a bit sour at all times and wheat panini ( i usually love whole wheat and grains bread) is dry and has a hint of medicine flavor. Very poor quality grain.",3.0
Really yummy! My friends and I shared 3 different types of paninis and they were all extremely yummy! The hot roast beef the grilled chicken and the prosciutto were amazing! Also had the iced cappuccino and it was great. Will definitely be back!,5.0
"Delicious paninis! It's a small cafe located in an Italian residential area and I could definitely feel the Italian vibes once I entered the place haha. Service was very nice. The waiters constantly went around asking diners if they needed anything. There was also a guy who forgot his CD's on the table and one of the waiters actually went outside to chase after him to give them back to him! I got the Panini with grilled chicken, mozzarella, peppers, arugala, and pesto and thought it tasted amazing! All of the ingredients complimented each other really well and the bread was not too tough to chew on. It's about $10 for one panini but it's definitely possible to split it into two meals so the price is not that unreasonable.This place sort of reminds me of Lioni's Italian Heroes (which is close by...) because the sandwiches are so good! Definitely recommended if you're in the area!",4.0
Always a great little restaurant whenever I decide to come here on a whim. I always get the pastrami panini which never disappoints. The smoothies are delicious and are great with any meal. You cannot leave this place without trying their dessert crepes. They taste just as good as they look. The girls that work here are always friendly and attentive.,5.0
"Can we talk about p18 for a second? Because between the prosciutto, fresh mozzarella and pesto sauce I don't think I've ever been happier. Perfect ingredient proportion, amazing flavor and even a small fresh salad on the side literally brought me to a small piazza in the center of Rome. For dessert we had the sweet crepe with Nutella, strawberries and banana doused in whipped cream. I'm pretty sure the description does enough justice for the dish.

I only had half of the whole panini and I was full. Had the panini delivered and by the time it got here, it was still crunchy and not soggy. The panini was packed with the ingredients. Definitely worth the money. The grilled salmon was delicious. Not a fan of the goat cheese but it went well with the grilled salmon and avocado.Decided to also get a crepe and it was good but next time, I might ask them to side the hershey's chocolate and pour it on myself when I get the food. I will definitely order from here again.",5.0
"My friends and I all ordered paninis; two prosciutto paninis and one grilled chicken. By far, this is one of the best paninis I've ever had except for one minor detail.

The waitresses were friendly and we didn't have to wait too long for our food! The interior of this little cafe was inviting especially with its little patio out in the front.

My point is that: it doesn't have to fancy restaurant, that you need to wait a week for a seat, or to charge so much money that you will make 1000% profit. Just offer good food, people will appreciate it. Ok, enough, now to the food: Panini!! Not too dry, not too liquid, little crispy (I asked to give it extra 2 minutes).

Basically a Greek salad, but requested no olives or onions and also got no tomato or dressing!  Also got a salad with walnuts, balsamic and tomato and was so gross, though the balsamic was good.  Also got a balsamic crepe with mozzarella and prosciutto and the mozz literally couldn't even be cut through with a plastic knife, it was so tough!!  Would not order from here again.  Disappointed!  The chicken Caesar wrap was tasty and again the balsamic dressing was awesome!",2.0
"One of the best places for brunch, lunch, or a light dinner. Inside there are 2 four seater tables, and 8 two seater tables. Outside there are about 8 tables or so.

It's true they only accept cash but I quickly noticed two visible signs when I walked in and the atmosphere machine in plain view was very obvious.

Can get a bit crowded on Saturdays where families will take up the tables.Highlights are the goat cheese and spinach panini or the prosciutto panini. The bread was pressed and grill great. Wonderful soft bread with a crunchy outside. They also provide good crepes as we had a peanut butter and nutella one which was made well. Go for their fresh coffee as well.",4.0

"Love this hidden gem. It's located in a residential area, away from all the noise on 86 street. The staff here are super friendly and accommodating. There were so many options of what to have in my panini. I opted for #36 which was grilled chicken with avocado, goat cheese and balsamic dressing. Average waiting time for our food (10 mins.) I also had a latte which was nothing spectacular. But it wasn't great. The panini was loaded with cheese which I love! I actually asked to swap the goat cheese for pepper jack but I don't think the waitress remembered. But it's not big deal because he panini was delicious regardless! I'll definitely be back for another brunch! Next time I want to try their crepes!",4.0
"The panini's are really freaking amazing!! I had I think a P18 It has proscuitto, fresh mozzarella and Pesto I ALSO ADDED BACON(for an extra charge) but, it is so definitley worth it. I've been back twice. Its great. They even put this amazing side salad contraption with some green dressing! Amazing. Coffee was eh. They have an awesome machine I just don't think it was executed properly because there were some leftover grinds which wasnt great. Regardless there panini is two thumbs up!!",4.0
Love this place! Local restaurant with amazing food. I usually can't decide what to order cause everything on their menu is delicious. I love to come here on summer nights cause you can sit outside and really feel like you are dinning in Europe. Nice leisurely dinner.,5.0
"After eating here,  I'm convinced heaven is a Brooklyn panini. Best hot pressed sandwiches I have ever had, and all ingredients are so fresh! Also, order a cup (or a bowl!) of the creamy tomato soup; ""mouth watering"" is an understatement!",5.0
"Read the reviews so I said I had to try and it lived up to its billing. Ordered the #18 (proscuitto, basil pesto, cheese) and everything was delicious. I almost ordered another one to go. The only gripe if i had one was the portions were small but maybe i just need to start eating less.Will definitely be back this place blows some of the other sandwich shops in bk out of the water.",5.0
Grilled chicken with bacon and avocado was the bomb. Service was slow and not very personable but the sandwich made up for it. Bathroom was clean also. I will be back,4.0
"Great neighborhood panino and cafe shop in a area that is short on this type of food. You'll get great morning or lunch coffee, pastries, or paninis. Can get a bit crowded on Saturdays where families will take up the tables.Highlights are the goat cheese and spinach panini or the prosciutto panini. The bread was pressed and grill great. Wonderful soft bread with a crunchy outside. They also provide good crepes as we had a peanut butter and nutella one which was made well. Go for their fresh coffee as well.",4.0
"LOVE. I FELL IN LOVE WITH THEIR CREAMY BASIL. I mean, if I could have one last meal I'd have the panini with grilled chicken, goat cheese, avocado and creamy basil. I would die happy.",5.0
"This place accepts cash only.Found this place on yelp when I was looking for places to eat around my neighborhood. It's tiny on the inside, but there was a good amount of seating. I ordered the  P18. Prosciutto with Fresh Mozzarella Panini and it was really tasty. The bread was toasty, the cheese was melty. The sandwich was really oily, the oil from the pesto was dripping. The sandwich also came with a small salad. Overall, I really enjoyed it and I would definitely come back!",5.0
"Great panini, glad I finally got to try this place for lunch. Ordered the 18 and 25 panini through yelp with the ceasar salad to share. Prepaid, and it's ready to pick up. If you're eating inside they are cash only. The panini tasted great and had the perfect proportions of everything. Salad ingredients were fresh.",4.0
"Love this hidden gem. It's located in a residential area, away from all the noise on 86 street. The staff here are super friendly and accommodating. There were so many options of what to have in my panini. I opted for #36 which was grilled chicken with avocado, goat cheese and balsamic dressing. Average waiting time for our food (10 mins.) I also had a latte which was nothing spectacular. But it wasn't great. The panini was loaded with cheese which I love! I actually asked to swap the goat cheese for pepper jack but I don't think the waitress remembered. But it's not big deal because he panini was delicious regardless!

This place used to be a hidden gem when it opened a few years ago because it's located in such a residential area. But words have spread and people travel to make this cute coffee/sandwich place a destination. Had so many of their panini and breakfast crepes and they're so good. Everything is so fresh and they're not cheap with the stuffings. The frozen hot chocolate is compatible to serendipity. I'm craving for one right now just thinking about it. The staff is super nice. Cash only! But they have a ATM machine inside.,5.0
"They have really good panini's here. I love to get the    Panini with fresh mozzarella , prosciutto, lettuce , tomato and pesto sauce. That's my favorite one.

"My absolute favorite is the panini with cacciatorini goat cheese and black olive tapenade! The flavors are amazing and the olive ties everything together nicely.

"I ordered the roast beef, mozzarella and sun dried tomato panini this time and it was good overall. But the sun dried tomatoes' taste were alittle off. Also, I felt like the roast beef was alittle too dry. Other than that, it was filling! You gotta have an empty stomach to munch on one whole panini. Personally, I thought the first time I came here, I experienced a better time. The taste was perfect. This time it was just alittle off you can say.The interior is sweet but alittle crowded. But it's okay!! That's what makes this restaurant good. Also, the customer service is very good. But the waitresses continuously comes up to ask if we're doing fine and all when we have food in our mouth which I find disturbing but I respect that.I would come back many more times!!",4.0
"This place has the best paninis in Brooklyn! The wraps aren't bad either. But I wouldnt recommend getting the crepes, they're not the best. The waiters here are too over friendly. One time, I took a really big bite of the panini ('cause it was THAT good), and the waiter asked me how everything was going. I couldn't reply back to her without making a fool of myself. This other time, the sauce dripped out of my mouth and leaked down my chin ('cause it was THAT juicy), and the waiter once again asked me how everything was going. I did not need to reply back for her to understand that the meal was amazing.",5.0
"Update: Ordered take out. Grub hub doesn't show the full descriptions of the panini, so I just winged it. Got proscuit to, red onion and fontina cheese. It was boars head ham. Not prosciutto. We ordered grilled vegetables and they are so charred and smothered in balsamic, I actually can't even tell what the vegetables are. Caesar salad was good. Croutons are homemade, crunchy and tasty. My daughters turkey panini was good also. Oh, and whoever re-wrote my grub hub ticket wrote down the wrong address, so I had to wait an even longer time for my food",3.0
"The place is small in size, but not small in taste! They have a nice variety of wraps and fresh and delicious.  For lunch, many people are willing to wait 30 mins just for a pain or wraos. They also make smoothies, also quite good. Had a blueberry banana smoothie. They also have an espresso machine, hot and strong!  The waitresses are young, cute and very customer centric. This is a nice place to go for a quick bite with fresh delicious food. They only take cash, and they have an ATM on site.",4.0
Food- ordered the breakfast panini ( two eggs with cheese and ham. Two egga with cheese and bacon) very good. The panini was crisp. I forgot to take a picture since I was too eager to eat it. Don't be an idiot like my fiance and order a bagel in a panini place.ServIce: deserves five plus stars. We also ordered a sweet crepe to share between the ppl and the waitress asked us if we wanted them to split it the way for us! How nice. It was served as if we each had our own full crepe.This review is base on one visit. We'll try other paninis next time. Hope I can still say it's five star for me.,5.0
To die for. Really. There isn't one thing on this menu that doesn't live up to mouth watering expectations. I have no other words. Only downside is it's cash only. There is an atm but they charge you. So just FYI.,5.0

"This cute little espresso, breakfast/lunch spot is located right on the corner and it has an outdoor and indoor seating, it can def. become busy and crowded but once you get your seat everything is just happiness from there from your choice of coffees to your salad and choice of having maybe some sweet crepes, a bowl of soup or a nice toasted panini of your taste bud. You can order online for free also and the workers are very kind and attentive to you. I love the tree outside that had all white lights decorated around it also! Bring your own bottle of wine & enjoy it with a nice order of ANTIPASTA with assorted meats and olives which was the cutest presentation when it landed on my table. As you can see in the picture I put up. The meats were nicely cut thin and fresh! I loved the little bowl of olives too, I am obsess with salt and olives are just everything just be careful there pitted. Main dish we had the grilled chicken panini with mozzarella, argula, roasted peppers and pesto dressing with extra pesto on the side! That sauce is everything, just pour it on everything and anything thats how good it was and so fresh! The panini is actually pretty big too so I had some to take home, woohooDessert we had us the sea salted caramel gelato with a mini fresh cannoli and the Nutella crepes! OH MY SWEET SUGA HEAVENS! IT WAS EVERYTHING MORE! Super fresh, taste was impeccable and how can you ever go wrong on Nutella! Its was just the best ending and sweetness to my meal! Lauren one of the owners is a total gem, she offered us a complimentary glass of red wine and she was so attentive and helpful with our food choices and orders, she won be over big time with the choice of the Nutella crepes! Girl you is the bombbb ! LolPrices are reasonable and great and I will for sure be back here!

Excellent paninis! Delivery service is also excellent. They arrive very quickly and are very courteous.Salads could use some work. I ordered a standard chicken salad with dressing on the side.

It's something like $8 for a crepe or panini. I can't recommend this place enough!",5.0
"The food taste deliciously great! I've ordered Roast Beef w/ Fresh Mozzarella Wrap (W4) and Fresh Strawberry & Strawberry Preserve Sweet Crepe (S12) total amount to $14.70.The workers and the cashier are both pretty friendly and positive. Nice place to visit. Good food as well, and I will come back here next time.",5.0
This is one of the best places I have eaten at near where I live in Brooklyn. Great Italian panino.,5.0
"Seriously this place gets better every time I come here. Aside from the Paninis, which are still the best I ever had since my last review, and a great cup of coffee, the bruschetta here is off the chart! Don't miss out on the eggplant and goat cheese and the pomedoro, you will will not regret it.Wish they were open on Sundays because thats when my craving to come here is at its peak lol",5.0
Favorite Panini spot ever! Working down their list to try every Panini combo they offer. So far they are all sooooo good!,5.0
"Ive experienced better. I don't like the fact that they don't accept debit or credit. I don't like how small it is. The panini is good I'm not gonna lie, but I've had better and the sandwiches are small and not filling.",2.0
Great little place in Bensonhurst Brooklyn. They have great coffee and crepes. However their panini menu has a delicious variety sandwiches. Also they have whole wheat bread for those who may be conscientious about their diet. When the weather is nice sit outside! It is one of my favorite places in Brooklyn.,5.0
"I found this place on yelp a long time ago but haven't got a chance to visit until today. I order P20 which is grilled chicken panini with mozzarella, red pepper and pesto. It's probably the best panini I ever had. The staff is very attentive too. The panini is huge and I  can only finish half of it and take the other half home. I need to try their dessert next time!!",5.0
They have an amazing staff and the paninis & crepes are winners. Everything here is great from the food to the staff,5.0
"Okay, this review can't be that long b/c everything on their menu that is a panini is a must-have. God, I love bread and crunchy bread with ooey goodness inside is just christmas everyday. They do delivery too! Panino Rustico, you may be the reason my abs are leaving. All is forgiven.",5.0
"I'm always on the search for new restaurants in the South Brooklyn area, since moving here. Upon walking in, we were seated right away. The entire menu looked just delicious! So my friends and I decided that we were going to order different paninis to share. When the food came out, it was presented on a platter nicely cut up ready to share. The presentation was beautiful and the paninis were just outstanding! Great experience! I will definitely make this my regular spot!",5.0
Great local spot. Everything on that menu is delicious. The crepes are a must have. I never have to wait long for a delivery either.,5.0
"I was there for lunch on Friday,with my daughter and her boyfriend.we sat outside the service was great they asked if I wanted a glass of wine.the food was great and the service is even better.they make great panini's and the crepe's are to die for.i would recommend if you have not ate here to give it a try you will not be disappointed.thx again owner Louie for such a good place in Dyker heights to come to and have good food. Can not wait to go back.",5.0
I would say this is somewhat a gem in Brooklyn. It's like having a Manhattan brunch without going to Manhattan. The decor is cute and there is outdoor seating.  We had to film a short skit and chose Panini Rustico to be our location and they didn't give us a hard time. I didn't give it a five star because the food wasn't exceptional. It was good but not memorable and the crepe was not very good.,4.0
"I found this place on yelp and had been meaning to try it out. My friend and I came here for a late lunch. I am well aware that they are known for their paninis, which looked delicious by the way. My friend and I ended up going for a sweet crepe (Nutella and strawberries) and a savory crepe (prosciutto, mozarella). My friend got the frappe, which wasn't overly sweet or overly watered down. I had an iced Americano, loved it! Their coffee is pretty good here!Service was good too, I'd definitely recommend this place for a nice cafe experience and I will definitely be back to try a panini! I also love the fact that it's located in a quiet area so you can sit outside when the weather is nice!",4.0
"My husband and I were in Brooklyn yesterday for business and we were hungry. After spending several minutes researching restaurants in the area we came across this little gem.  The interior was very inviting and the workers were pleasant. Which was already a plus in my book. We ordered the P20 (grilled chicken, mozzarella, roasted red pepper, arugula & basil pesto) and the P37 (grilled chicken, bacon, pepper jack cheese & ranch dressing). Both sandwiches were very good.  The chicken was moist, the bread was crisp everything was fresh. Traveling from Long Island might be a bit of a journey but I can't wait to try more items from their menu. Thanks for a delightful afternoon!!",5.0

"Really cute little corner cafe with delicious paninis. I've been wanting to try this place for a long time and so glad I did. I do wish there was a panini option with roasted/grilled veggies with olive tapenade or anything that wasn't fish with olive tapenade but no biggie. I ordered the Hot Soppresata, Smoked Mozzarella & Roasted Peppers Panini instead and that was so good. I'm no good with Italian (the language) so I had no idea what soppresata was when I ordered it but was crossing fingers it was a type of meat, which thankfully it was! It wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be but it had a bit of heat. Overall a tasty and flavorful sandwich, which came with a small side salad on the plate. Their frozen hot chocolate was also pretty good on a hot day. Would love to come back and try their other menu items!",4.0
"This place is a true gem, Brooklyn should value genuine businesses like this a lot more.Delicious soup, great coffee and the best panini's I've ever ate. My favorite is the smoked salmon with avacodo, onion and cheese. Awesome place to grab a bite in the summer time, especially with the outside seating. Price are reasonable and affordable, cash only! Respect!",5.0
"Yummmmm! It's a welcome variety of food considering all if the Japanese, Chinese and pizza places around here. Panninis are HUGE. Very tasty, and you can tell all of the ingredients are remarkably fresh. Mozzarella bruschetta is out of this world. Staff is very friendly and accommodating.",5.0
"Cute cafe! I ordered the salmon avocado panini. The salmon was very fresh. I think adding some cream cheese instead of goat would be better for me though. The one flaw is it's a small cafe so when the staff are using the blender, it's really loud",4.0

"This place has the best egg sandwich I've ever had in my entire life. It is ridiculous. The eggs are so fluffy and perfect and they taste great. I ask them to put mozzarella on mine, which they do at no extra charge, and there is so much of this amazing stretchy fresh mozzarella it's just bananas. All of the food is great, I love a good cheese plate and they never disappoint. The delivery wait time is like 15 minutes every time and the delivery gentlemen are always lovely. Anddd most incredibly they are consistent, it is always top notch and always greatly satisfying.I finished my eggy sandwich as I finished this review and I already miss it. I'd consider obesity just to eat one of these every meal.",5.0

"THE LOVE I HAVE FOR THIS PLACE....On the corner of 83rd and 17th you'll find this little gem. The restaurant is small but has outdoor seating for the warmer months. Sitting outside enjoying their delicious food is why I keep coming back for more. Their meat and cheese plates are fun to snack on as a little appetizer. All their soups are homemade and DELICIOUS. I was never a soup person and never will be unless it's here. Their salads are refreshing and their dressings are also homemade. TO THE PERSON WHO INVENTED THE CREAMY BASIL DRESSING: I WOULD KISS THE GROUNDS YOU WALK ON! I really do love that dressing. Now, the paninis, everything is fresh, homemade feel, and smooshed on two toasty pieces of bread. The salmon, red onion, avocado and goat cheese panini is a MUST try and seems to be quite popular. I have tried many of their paninis and can proudly say was never disappointed. This place is also BYOB, which I have yet to take advantage of. It is also kid friendly which I really appreciate (high chair, kid menu and all!)",5.0
"Panino Rustico can do no wrong! I may sound like a fan girl, an I admit, I am! They are among my favorite cafés ever. They hit every single cafe requirement for the perfect cafe.1. The food is amazing. They have a huge menu page worth of Paninis. You can't go wrong! Salmon truffle, and prosciutto ones are my favorite. But roast beef was good too. Oh and the soups. They have two to three daily soups. The last time they had a tortellini one that I adored.2. Coffee! Actually good coffee. And also options of lattes and cappuccinos.3. Free wifi! Holy shit. It's near impossible to find free wifi around here. But they have it! And they have outlets! And they let you sit and do work. I work in the field writing reports so that's a big must for me.4. Clean bathrooms. And actually just having a bathroom. Do you know how many cafés don't? Puts a real damper on hanging out in a place.5. Great staff. All the girls working here have been very sweet and nice. 6. And finally for the summer there are outdoor tables in the front! So yeah. Can't do wrong. I tell you.

Their creamy basil dressing is basically good enough to drink...",4.0
"The food was very good. Just got to say that the service wasn't as satisfying as I would liked it to be. First arrived and we notified the girls (employees) we were going to have a seat outside... Okay no more thank 5 min went by  and I had to stand up and wave at the girls ( employees) for attention. Okay I understand maybe they didn't see us. So they give us the menus and we order good so far and our plates arrived quickly again good so far, but the thing that blew me off was that I wasn't offer any utensils nor napkins so I literally got up and got my table  what we needed.

I don't even know why this place has a higher star than 3. Their panini isn't even so great and is not worth the price. The panini is so dry and hard and they don't give a lot of meat with it.

"Such a great place in a very casual environment. Always busy.Paninis are large enough to share (and if you tell them that you are sharing, they will gladly put them on separate plates for you). The same goes for the soups. I love the meat and cheese dishes that are served with brilliantly toasted slices of bread ends drizzled in olive oil.

However, the last time I came here I didn't have such a great experience. There seems to be a lot of waitresses working, but the service here was horrible.  First, I was really confused as to who our waitress was.  Our pellegrinos were warm and had to ask several times for cups with ice and straws. Every time i would ask for something, like a napkin, a knife, or sugar, I would be given a fake smile and an eye roll. We asked for the check and it took about 20 minutes for us to receive it.  From now on I'm doing take out!",3.0

There seems to be a lot of waitresses working, but the service here was horrible.  First, I was really confused as to who our waitress was.  Our pellegrinos were warm and had to ask several times for cups with ice and straws. Every time i would ask for something, like a napkin, a knife, or sugar, I would be given a fake smile and an eye roll. We asked for the check and it took about 20 minutes for us to receive it.  From now on I'm doing take out!",3.0
"Panino not only has a wonferful and welcoming staff, they have the best crepes and the best coffee, brewed to perfection. I had their Turkey Crepe, it was savory with just the right amount of creamy basil dressing, arugula and fontina cheese. Warm and deliciously cheesey. Yum!",5.0
Amazing food and nice atmosphere. It's small and quaint but the service is nothing short of excellent. The menu is so large I often have trouble deciding what to order (never a bad thing though). The one downside which is why I didn't give this place 5 stars is the fact that they do not accept cards. Cash only however they do have an atm in case you don't have cash on hand. The creamy basil pesto sauce is so good I want to order a bucket to go and use it with everything I cook at home. There are chairs outside also for those that prefer fresh air. This place isn't expected where it is as it's located in a pretty residential area but I am so glad that it is. My go to picks are p20 grilled chicken roasted peppers and mozzarella as well as p26 grilled chicken and broccoli raab. Must try if you haven't.,4.0
"They have delicious Paninis & Nutella Crepes. The outdoor seating is great and it's bring your own wine ! What more can you ask for ? You have to try the Pastrami Swiss pickles & mustard on an Everything Panini , it's to die for !",5.0
Ordered out twice so far everything was delicious!  Minus one star because food was delivered almost cold. But I will definitely eat in again.,4.0
Their paninis are too die for. My boyfriend and I have been addicted to Starbucks paninis but after trying out this spot ... I think we found our new obsession. It's always great to leave room for their crepes because they are also really good. One of the best I've had & you can customize it any way you'd like. The staff here is very attentive to the customers and very friendly,5.0
First time here and I must say it was delicious! I was definitely surprised how unique it tasted especially the way the salmon was cooked (in a good way)!  The bread was very crunchy just the way I liked it!,5.0

"If you live in Bensonhurst, or if you just came out of New Utrecht looking for something to eat with your friends, go to Panino Rustico. One; The atmosphere is nice in here. Two; Its relatively close and its right near the D train and the B1. Three; The food is so good. I obviously went for the nutella banana crepe and it was absow amazing. Though I took it to go, so it wasnt very appealing to the eye.. thats not the point! The paninis are just as well fantastic, from breakfast to lunch paninis and crepes, there is so much you can ask for! and of course its a cafe so lets not forget about the coffee, its amazing! Why not buy your coffee here rather than that nasty dunkin donuts down the block?",5.0
"I am Speechless with the horrible service that is provided by the girls that have been there for over a year. Nasty attitude- I'm not sure if I'm being envied, but it never fails.          As i mentioned in the previous review that i really enjoy the food and the outside sitting and thats why i keep going back- not sure if i am the only one being so picky but today was one of my worst experience. As we walked in and requested a sit for 5 people outside - we were told that cant be arranged and a debate between the coworkers started happening like it was a court decision. I left them inside and our group helped ourselves. Our order was taken and food came out- tasted great but we had to ask for silverware, sAlt, pepper and ketchup (really! I thought this was a must). We decided we wanted coffee, the water took forever to come and take our order but we were enjoying the weather and didn't bother us. Once the coffee came out of course we had to go inside and get our sugar inside - where i ran into the owner by the door  and he tried to help me. As we were having a coffee a friend joined us but she had to go inside order her coffee and desert because the outside is never attended by the waters and they dont care. She was welcomed with a horrible service by the waitress inside which she had to confront her and aSk her what the problem was! At the end i went inside to pay and i get a check without a total and the waitress tells me a total that wasn't matching to my total- i asked her did she include the tip? She got all pissed off and she said NO the tax is not on the bill.. (How m I suppose to know?) Her attitude got to me and I told her -i assumed that there isn't any tax since you guys take only cash and don't report all the money. I gave the blond nasty waitress money and she gave me money back but i needed change for the tip (maybe i shouldn't have left Anything bc they truly didn't deserve any) she walked away from the counter and i had to ask someone else for change.. Left them 15% tip but im upset at myself. I for sure next time wont tip or pay my bill if something like this happens.. The workers will definitely bring the place down if its not resolved by owner.",1.0

"Panino Rustico is a diamond in the rough. It is excellent. Its a small panini shop in the middle of a very Italian neighborhood. The ingredients taste fresh, and made with care.

I love this place, and everyone I goes with loves it too. Meghan called me a reality show junkie when i told her this, but last time I was there I saw three of the girls from the Oxygen show Brooklyn 11223, having lunch.Anyhow, if you are in the neighborhood, Panino is excellent and worth your time/money.I can recommend Panini P23",5.0
"Really great cream of tomato soup with chicken! Panini's are decent sized. Two people could share. The dessert looked really good. Best part, it's byob!

"It took guts for the owner of this establishment to put it where they did. You first need to understand that Panino Rustico is not in the ideal location, there are no other restaurants around it and it's surrounded by a mostly residential area that also has distributors, a 99 cent store and a tax preparer. To put a fantastic little cafe/Italian restaurant in this area was genius, and hopefully this will be the start of better surrounding establishments!Panino Rustico is done right, it's small but has a charm like no other place in the area besides Mona Lisa cafe about 6 blocks away. My wife had gone here a few times with friends and raved about it so i gave it a shot. Before i get to the food, keep in mind the place is small so seating during prime hours could take a while, and they do have outdoor seating too. It's safe to say i love everything about Panino Rustico! The menu is simple and at the same time extensive. There's a small list of antipastos, soups and salads...I started with a ""small"" option Caesar salad that was huge so my wife and i shared. The lettuce was fresh and crispy and the Caesar dressing was creamy but not too rich. There were also a ton of croutons and cheese shavings to top it off. The 'bread and butter' of the restaurant is basically a laundry list of panini or wrap options! Fortunately there's a ""make your own"" option so i went with that. I constructed a wrap with avocado, fresh mozzarella, sun dried tomato, basil, lettuce, oil and regular tomato. It was served with a side of greens and was fabulous! The wrap was put together well and toasted properly so i have zero complaints. Dessert is the other main attraction at this charming establishment! A vast selection of crepes, shakes, smoothies, coffee and gelato makes Panino Rustico a great destination for a date or an after dinner snack. Once again the ""make your own"" option comes into play for the crepes so i went all out! I went with the banana and nutella crepe with caramel drizzle and whipped cream, it was so good that i attempted to order a second until my wife stepped in and said otherwise.Once again, i have to commend the person who put this place here because it's perfect in every way and adds a great food destination for people in the neighborhood. It can't be understated how important it is to have a cool new place to go to where you can fill up on fantastic food and not break the bank! Our salad, sodas, wraps and crepes came out to $35, can't beat that! Highly recommended! One of the best in the area for sure.",5.0

"What can I say about this simply awesome neighborhood more-than-just-(DELICIOUS)panini-place? Having been to this place more times than the amount of digits on a normal set of hands and feet, I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed (I've only checked in 9 times, usually because I've been so eager to dig into my meal). Service is always spot on, food always hits the spot. Forgive me in advance, but I don't remember the numbers of the panini's, so I'll just stick with descriptions because all are unique enough that you can't be mistaken. I usually get the salmon panini (which is by far the most popular one from what I hear), but I've been branching out recently and the panini with bacon and ranch dressing is absolutely to die for. Though, if the name is any indication, panino Rustico prides itself on panini's, don't be scared to try a delicious wrap. I suggest the Caesar wrap. I usually end the meal with a double espresso and one of their sweet crepes, (they have savory crepes, but I have yet to try one) of which the lemon and sugar crepe is amazing. In a nutshell, food is always great, service is always great, Panino Rustico is ALWAYS great! Try it, you'll be hooked.",5.0
went today. Had Caesar salad which was a bit salty. Had Grilled chicken avocado goat cheese and balsamic glaze panini. It was pretty good. My husband got the espresso in a coffee cup. Good espresso but if this place says espresso bar on the window it should be served in an espresso cup.  Not sure if maybe they ran out but it wasn't that busy and it was the morning like 1130. My husband also had Caesar salad and the grilled chicken bacon provolone panini and he enjoyed it. The only thing for me that was annoying was the menu. It's on a laminated paper but the font is too small to read and the ink is faded out. It's like a laminated Xerox copy of the menu which I think is kinda ghetto fab. It's better to laminate a better copy on nice paper. Just because this place is nice so the menu should do it more justice. So I suggest you guys change that menu to make it darker so it's easier to see better. Otherwise good food tho!,3.0
"What a surprise, last night my parents took me here raving about this tiny place. I must say from.the moment we walked in the owner was so friendly and gracious to my parents and I.  The eggplant and goat cheese app is not to be missed. I'm.still thinking about it!  The panini sandwich's were so delicious, fresh and perfectly prepared. Don't forget to save room for the homemade canolis . I'll jump in my car any day of the week from NYC  to pick up my parents and go back to this great little place in Bklyn.",5.0
"As part of the 5BBC  (five borough bike club) we stopped by during a friday evening ride led by Bill M. The ride was fine, we zig zagged through the beautiful neighborhoods of Brooklyn from Grand Army Plaza. The ride made a stop at Panino Rustico and WOW WOW WOW.. this place blew my socks off. The breads were perfectly toasted and the ingredients were all excellent. The prices were fair (not Bánh mì cheap but not hipster expensive) 8-9 bucks is average. The gelato is 3 bucks a scoop (little pricey but very nice). In both cases I split the sandwich with someone else and both halves were AMAZING. When the Bill M. announced another Brooklyn ride with a stop here, I was the first in line. And again the 2 paninis I shared (different this time but I forget which) were delicious. I think the only downside is its location, it's in a mostly residential neighborhood in Bensonhurst (which is far for me). But since I have a car, a motorcycle, a bicycle.. I'll drive to avoid hipsters, no problem. Also the lines CAN get long if this place gets a flood of people (no thanks to the 20+ bicyclist) but I'd rather it be made with care than to be rushed. The owner is friendly. The servers and waitresses are pretty (probably there for the summer). What's not to like?",5.0

It's a very small location that has a real cozy feel and mom/pop owned flavor. You feel like you are sitting at someones house. They have an extended panini section with so many choices. I loved the prosciutto/mozzarella pesto panini. The pizza was great too. Appetizers of eggplant were delicious. It was so good, that I came back two days later  in the morning for cappaccino and the banana/nutella crepe. OMG- the crepe was heaven. We stayed about 2 hours and not rushed feeling at all. The place did get crowded at lunch time though so we did try to get out so not to take up a table, but they never pushed us out. We could have stayed all day. What a great place!",4.0

It's on a laminated paper but the font is too small to read and the ink is faded out. It's like a laminated Xerox copy of the menu which I think is kinda ghetto fab. It's better to laminate a better copy on nice paper. Just because this place is nice so the menu should do it more justice. So I suggest you guys change that menu to make it darker so it's easier to see better. Otherwise good food tho!,3.0
"What a surprise, last night my parents took me here raving about this tiny place. I must say from.the moment we walked in the owner was so friendly and gracious to my parents and I.  The eggplant and goat cheese app is not to be missed. I'm.still thinking about it!  The panini sandwich's were so delicious, fresh and perfectly prepared. Don't forget to save room for the homemade canolis . I'll jump in my car any day of the week from NYC  to pick up my parents and go back to this great little place in Bklyn.",5.0
"As part of the 5BBC  (five borough bike club) we stopped by during a friday evening ride led by Bill M. The ride was fine, we zig zagged through the beautiful neighborhoods of Brooklyn from Grand Army Plaza. The ride made a stop at Panino Rustico and WOW WOW WOW.. this place blew my socks off. The breads were perfectly toasted and the ingredients were all excellent. The prices were fair (not Bánh mì cheap but not hipster expensive) 8-9 bucks is average. The gelato is 3 bucks a scoop (little pricey but very nice). In both cases I split the sandwich with someone else and both halves were AMAZING. When the Bill M. announced another Brooklyn ride with a stop here, I was the first in line. And again the 2 paninis I shared (different this time but I forget which) were delicious. I think the only downside is its location, it's in a mostly residential neighborhood in Bensonhurst (which is far for me). But since I have a car, a motorcycle, a bicycle.. I'll drive to avoid hipsters, no problem. Also the lines CAN get long if this place gets a flood of people (no thanks to the 20+ bicyclist) but I'd rather it be made with care than to be rushed. The owner is friendly. The servers and waitresses are pretty (probably there for the summer). What's not to like?",5.0

"Yay! What a find in the middle of a neighborhood. My sister told me about this place as she comes all the time and her daughters order from here as well (yay for take out). It's a very small location that has a real cozy feel and mom/pop owned flavor. You feel like you are sitting at someones house. They have an extended panini section with so many choices. I loved the prosciutto/mozzarella pesto panini. The pizza was great too. Appetizers of eggplant were delicious. It was so good, that I came back two days later  in the morning for cappaccino and the banana/nutella crepe. OMG- the crepe was heaven. We stayed about 2 hours and not rushed feeling at all. The place did get crowded at lunch time though so we did try to get out so not to take up a table, but they never pushed us out. We could have stayed all day. What a great place!",4.0

All three were delicioius. Everything is made to order. All the ingredients tasted fresh. My boyfriend always orders the P20 and substitutes the arugula with baby spinach and they never give him a problem for it. The paninis range from $8 to $10, which is not bad considering how good they are. The panini comes with a small salad if you dine-in but not if you order to go.

"Discovered this place while visiting my mom in the nearby rehab center.

"Love this place. I've been back many times, and absolutely enjoyed each visit. Continuing to tell people about it. Seriously, stop by. - Sandwich snob friendly. Whether you're looking for a good, well made, borderline fancy (yet somehow, super hearty) sandwich or a long cup of coffee with a friend, this is probably the best place in the neighborhood to do it.- Wifi & Study friendly. Anyone who needs a quiet, friendly, sunny space with wifi and outlets to work should also put panino rustico on their list.- Family & Kid Friendly. If your kid's not an asshole, I'm sure they will receive them with open arms. There is such strong family value here, it hits you like a hug. Lou, the owner, was so gracious with my friend and her kids; the waitresses and the other patrons all ended up joining their conversation. Uh... the resulting disco party was a hit. Also, the biggest jar of nutella I've ever seen in my life. See high shelf behind counter. Plot ways to steal it when awesome waitresses are not looking.",5.0
"Absolutely fantastic food! My favorite is the bruschetta (I get the classic one and the one with goat cheese). Paninis are delicious, and the waitstaff have been very accommodating when I've asked to make substitutions or modifications.

"Wow, where to begin!? Starting from the first week Panino Rustico opened I've been coming here almost every Friday or Saturday. To start, the decor and mood to the place is what this neighborhood needed. Great for a quick lunch or even a classy dinner date and they deliver! The staff is nothing but fantastic. The ladies work and give full attention. You could tell the workers actually love their job which is great. The owner of the place (Louie) is a great guy, comes out and checks on every table and makes you feel right at home. Now, for the food... I have my second home in Italy which gave me a great understanding of Italian food, especially Panini's. With all honesty, this is the one and ONLY place that can be JUST AS AMAZING as the Panini's in Italy. Soups are great, salads are fresh..what more to ask for!? Their deserts are awesome, I recommend a Crepe with a nice  Italian Espresso (great mix). Been living in the neighborhood for about 16 years and this is now, and always will be, my ALL TIME FAVORITE.",5.0
"Aside from the fact that one of my closest friends lives in this area, after having lunch here a few days ago, I can say that I would travel to the furthest end of brooklyn any day to experience Panino Rustico again and again. Located on the corner of a quiet block in a cute family neighborhood, Panino Rustico offers a place to be if you need to get out of the house. I am insanely jealous that no such sanctuary exists in my neighborhood but take solace in knowing that when i visit my dear friend in Bensonhurst, that the question of ""where to eat"" need not be answered. It was bustling on a Saturday afternoon. We waited 10 minutes to get a table. The menu boasts of sandwiches and paninis, for their namessake, and some interesting blended beverages. Not much of a fan for sweets or milkshakes, I took a chance and ordered the frozen hot chocolate. It was great! I had a hard time deciding on a sandwich because everything just sounded so amazing. I ended up ordering the special of the day which was the Sonny Special. Grilled Chicken. Sun Dried tomatoes. Avocado. Fontina cheese. I asked for mayo because I thought it would be dry. The panini arrived warm and crispy. The bread is pure perfection. Great crunch. Not too hard. Not too chewy. The melt of the cheese was spot on and the ingredients together made my soul smile. The panini came with a side salad that had a creamy green dressing- maybe basil- and was simply outstanding. What a gem! I cant wait to return. Be mindful that they are closed on Sundays, and just recently stopped taking credit cards. Bring cash. (if you forgot the cash, they have a No Fee ATM in the restaurant)Come hungry. (cant wait to return for the PB & J crepe!)",5.0
"I passed by here one night and this place wasn't even opened yet. However, being the panini lover I am, I got sources telling me this place has opened up. This place only opened about a week ago. After my morning errands, I decided to take a walk down here to check this place out.Panino Rustico has outdoor seating, which is pretty nifty because there aren't that many places in this neighborhood that has this. The interior of this place was simple and pretty spacious. People who worked there were really friendly. After chatting with Lauren and Louie, I found out this business is ran by their family. They've told me they get their breads freshly made from Il Fornaretto on a daily basis, which is also a local favor. According to Louie, their ingredients are all local because they want to provide the freshest ingredients. I can't disagree with that because after trying out their panini and smoothies, I know their ingredients are pretty fresh.I've ordered the smoke salmon with goat cheese, red onion, avocado and truffle oil. The bread was grilled to perfection. It had a crispy crunch at every bite - my only complaint was all the bread crumbs got all over the place - but it's so worth it. The panini had generous slabs of avocado, which I loved it a lot. The panini was really light and fresh in, out and all about. I've gotten the four berry (strawberry, blackberry, blueberry and raspberry) and the pineapple, coconut and banana smoothies. Both smoothies were really natural and refreshing. I actually favor the pineapple, coconut banana smoothie a little more than the four berry. At this restaurant, they have antipasti, insalata, panini, bruschetta, savory and sweet crepes, fruit smoothies and even some pastry sweets. And hey they even have gelato! This place allows you to bring your own wine with $5 corking fee. To me it's a odd because I never thought of pairing panini to wine, crepes yes, but panini no. But what the hey, my alcoholic friends out there can drink any time of day with any food pairing.While I waited for my order, there were a lot of locals that stopped by and said hi to the staff. It just amazes me how this place was only established about a week ago and yet it seems like they've been around for a decade or so. Places like this becomes a local favor and it's the go to place for locals to chit chat and talk about the community. It's like those coffee houses that you see in movies, where everyone knows each other type of deal. There should be more places like this in the neighborhood.And what also amazes me is that they open at 6AM and closes at 11PM on weekdays. I really like that they open so early and close so late, so now I know where I can always find food.",4.0

It is a great place to go, and the prices are great. We went on a Friday afternoon, and we had to wait 10 minutes for a seat because it was so packed! Great place to dine with the family.",5.0
Everyone I know that has eaten here agrees that the place is awesome. Quality ingredients put together masterfully make for a delicious meal. Staff is always super nice and serves you with a smile. The only negative is that the space is small so prepare to squeeze in.,5.0
"Love this place. I've been back many times, and absolutely enjoyed each visit. Continuing to tell people about it. Seriously, stop by. - Sandwich snob friendly. Whether you're looking for a good, well made, borderline fancy (yet somehow, super hearty) sandwich or a long cup of coffee with a friend, this is probably the best place in the neighborhood to do it.- Wifi & Study friendly. Anyone who needs a quiet, friendly, sunny space with wifi and outlets to work should also put panino rustico on their list.- Family & Kid Friendly. If your kid's not an asshole, I'm sure they will receive them with open arms. There is such strong family value here, it hits you like a hug. Lou, the owner, was so gracious with my friend and her kids; the waitresses and the other patrons all ended up joining their conversation. Uh... the resulting disco party was a hit. Also, the biggest jar of nutella I've ever seen in my life. See high shelf behind counter. Plot ways to steal it when awesome waitresses are not looking.",5.0
"Absolutely fantastic food! My favorite is the bruschetta (I get the classic one and the one with goat cheese). Paninis are delicious, and the waitstaff have been very accommodating when I've asked to make substitutions or modifications. The service is very relaxed, which is perfect because I don't want or need to be pampered here. The waitstaff has always been responsive when I've asked for things and that's all I need. Great hidden spot!",5.0
"Yes!!!!! I finally tried this place tonight! Great menu, amazing paninis, adorable cafe, clean, friendly service, open till 10pm weekdays and it's right in the neighborhood AND they have outdoor seating AND its bring your own wine!? WTH more can I ask for? They don't skimp on ingredients, the bread is perfect and the prices are pretty decent because the panini is very filling. My stomach is so happy.",5.0
"Wow, where to begin!? Starting from the first week Panino Rustico opened I've been coming here almost every Friday or Saturday. To start, the decor and mood to the place is what this neighborhood needed. Great for a quick lunch or even a classy dinner date and they deliver! The staff is nothing but fantastic. The ladies work and give full attention. You could tell the workers actually love their job which is great. The owner of the place (Louie) is a great guy, comes out and checks on every table and makes you feel right at home. Now, for the food... I have my second home in Italy which gave me a great understanding of Italian food, especially Panini's. With all honesty, this is the one and ONLY place that can be JUST AS AMAZING as the Panini's in Italy. Soups are great, salads are fresh..what more to ask for!? Their deserts are awesome, I recommend a Crepe with a nice  Italian Espresso (great mix). Been living in the neighborhood for about 16 years and this is now, and always will be, my ALL TIME FAVORITE.",5.0
"Aside from the fact that one of my closest friends lives in this area, after having lunch here a few days ago, I can say that I would travel to the furthest end of brooklyn any day to experience Panino Rustico again and again. Located on the corner of a quiet block in a cute family neighborhood, Panino Rustico offers a place to be if you need to get out of the house. I am insanely jealous that no such sanctuary exists in my neighborhood but take solace in knowing that when i visit my dear friend in Bensonhurst, that the question of ""where to eat"" need not be answered. It was bustling on a Saturday afternoon. We waited 10 minutes to get a table. The menu boasts of sandwiches and paninis, for their namessake, and some interesting blended beverages. Not much of a fan for sweets or milkshakes, I took a chance and ordered the frozen hot chocolate. It was great! I had a hard time deciding on a sandwich because everything just sounded so amazing. I ended up ordering the special of the day which was the Sonny Special. Grilled Chicken. Sun Dried tomatoes. Avocado. Fontina cheese. I asked for mayo because I thought it would be dry. The panini arrived warm and crispy. The bread is pure perfection. Great crunch. Not too hard. Not too chewy. The melt of the cheese was spot on and the ingredients together made my soul smile. The panini came with a side salad that had a creamy green dressing- maybe basil- and was simply outstanding. What a gem! I cant wait to return. Be mindful that they are closed on Sundays, and just recently stopped taking credit cards. Bring cash. (if you forgot the cash, they have a No Fee ATM in the restaurant)Come hungry. (cant wait to return for the PB & J crepe!)",5.0
"I passed by here one night and this place wasn't even opened yet. However, being the panini lover I am, I got sources telling me this place has opened up. This place only opened about a week ago. After my morning errands, I decided to take a walk down here to check this place out.Panino Rustico has outdoor seating, which is pretty nifty because there aren't that many places in this neighborhood that has this. The interior of this place was simple and pretty spacious. People who worked there were really friendly. After chatting with Lauren and Louie, I found out this business is ran by their family. They've told me they get their breads freshly made from Il Fornaretto on a daily basis, which is also a local favor. According to Louie, their ingredients are all local because they want to provide the freshest ingredients. I can't disagree with that because after trying out their panini and smoothies, I know their ingredients are pretty fresh.I've ordered the smoke salmon with goat cheese, red onion, avocado and truffle oil. The bread was grilled to perfection. It had a crispy crunch at every bite - my only complaint was all the bread crumbs got all over the place - but it's so worth it. The panini had generous slabs of avocado, which I loved it a lot. The panini was really light and fresh in, out and all about. I've gotten the four berry (strawberry, blackberry, blueberry and raspberry) and the pineapple, coconut and banana smoothies. Both smoothies were really natural and refreshing. I actually favor the pineapple, coconut banana smoothie a little more than the four berry. At this restaurant, they have antipasti, insalata, panini, bruschetta, savory and sweet crepes, fruit smoothies and even some pastry sweets. And hey they even have gelato! This place allows you to bring your own wine with $5 corking fee. To me it's a odd because I never thought of pairing panini to wine, crepes yes, but panini no. But what the hey, my alcoholic friends out there can drink any time of day with any food pairing.While I waited for my order, there were a lot of locals that stopped by and said hi to the staff. It just amazes me how this place was only established about a week ago and yet it seems like they've been around for a decade or so. Places like this becomes a local favor and it's the go to place for locals to chit chat and talk about the community. It's like those coffee houses that you see in movies, where everyone knows each other type of deal. There should be more places like this in the neighborhood.And what also amazes me is that they open at 6AM and closes at 11PM on weekdays. I really like that they open so early and close so late, so now I know where I can always find food.",4.0
"Very nice, but a little bit small place. Big choice of tasty paninis. :) Staff is nice. 4 stars for two reasons. First reason: I think prices are a little bit high for some things on the menu. Second reason: they don't really know what comes after what and bring everything together to you table. So while you are eating your soup, you other order ( that has to be hot) is getting cold.But in total the place is nice and probably I will be back.",4.0
"Their paninis are fresh and tasty for the most part. The thing that I don't like is that they don't take credit cards. They went through the hassle of installing an ATM machine, that way if you don't have cash, you can conveniently take it off from the ATM machine with a service fee of course, but why inconvenience your customers and just not accept credit cards?",3.0
"the great thing about this place is that you can sit outside and stare at all the characters for hours. very cozy indoors as well & they serve above average espresso. the food is too simple and boring, actually, and that's the downfall of rustico. paninis with the same repeating ingredients - it gets old after your third time here because even the first time they are just OK. nutella crepes are also OK - as expected, nothing exciting. iced coffees are def way below average, small and overpriced. bruschetta - also just OK. but come on, if that's on your already teeny-tiny menu it better be tasty and craving-inducing not just OK? ya? i mean it's bruschetta, i can make better at home on a whim. all in all, i like to come here for brunch or an evening meal with a friend when we can sit outside and chat for awhile. i come here despite the food, not because of it.",3.0
"New favorite neighborhood spot!I've been meaning to come here for the longest time because it's about the only cute place you can casually sit and eat outside within the neighborhood- the next option being mona lisa which is kind of meh to me.I got the chicken with pesto panini and cream of tomato soup which were both great and the service there is quick and fast. The servers are very good as well.  If you are wondering what happened to all the Italians in Bensonhurst, they are all here at Panino Rustico! Can't wait to go back to try the crepes!",5.0
"Charming little place in the middle of nowhere in Bensonhurst. You'll miss it if you walk to fast. Staff is attentive but not overwhelming, just the right amount of service for a small place. Food is excellent, fresh, and very tasty. Salads are fresh as well. Panini is large enough to be shared. I shared a Panini and a Crepe and was full. Overall a cute little place to stop by for lunch or a snack.",5.0
"The food is always amazing and after a long week all I wanted was a panini to go with my wine on a Friday night. Well, after a few calls, busy tone, being hung up on, and a back and forth with Delivery.com for a half hour, I found out they actually ran out of paninis. Kind of annoyed because I was really in the mood but they still got 4 stars because the food is always good and so is the service...but don't answer and then hang up, just make up some excuse like the kitchen is closed or tell the truth that you ran out of paninis, believe me, I'm sure most of your customers have worked in restaurants and have had their share of moments like this, we will understand that rather than being hung up on. Hopefully I can get my favorite panini at some point next week.",4.0
"Yummy panini, definitely going there again and again. I love the ambiance. I highly recommend this cafe for brunch time, their paninis are quite big for one person, you can always share/split it with your partner. I gave it 4 stars because I wasn't impressed with their savory crepes.",4.0
"I trekked to this cafe today.  There are not many Italian pastries places with seating around here.  It is a clean cafe that serves sandwiches, coffee, and crepes.  There are relaxing and soothing oldies playing in the background.  The ladies who work here are welcoming.  I definitely love their bruschetta with fresh tomatoes, onions, and fresh mozzarella.  It was the highlight of my visit.  It took about half an hour for this delicious bruschette to be prepared, and sadly, I was armed with an immense appetite.  (minus one star)   What really grinded my gears was that it was not busy at the time, since I saw that there was about five customers total and three waitresses on staff.  The bread is crunchy and coated with extra virgin olive oil, making it delightfully delectable.  The smoked salmon with goat cheese panini adorned with red onion, avocado and truffle oil was decent.  To be honest, after eating this, I realized that I'm not a fan of lox in heated form--but this is a lesson learned when ordering new things.  I would have to say that it was an interesting blend of ingredients and definitely filling. There is a clean bathroom in the back.  Not to mention that the interior has paintings, a television, and a huge window to let in the beautiful sunlight.   When I came in, there was plenty of adequate seating 20 to 30 seats.  The store comprised of regulars from the neighborhood who visit as and mothers who ask one another how their kids are doing in school.  It is a nice, friendly vibe.  Everyone kind of knows each other and people come in for their usuals.In this experience, I had a large coffee for $2.39 and a signature panino for $8.49 and a slice of brushetta for $1.99.  My total bill after taxes came out to be $13.20.   Score!  These are prices are great.  To my chagrin, there was no bruschetta in sight for over twenty minutes, so I had to remind someone that I ordered it. (minus one star)  I do not mind that they use fresh ingredients or take their time to make it, but I do not like being forgotten.  I must say that the restaurant is located on 83rd and 17th avenue so it is a few blocks from the D train if you do not mind the walk.  Did I mention they have free wifi?  =)  I think I'll come back and try another panini.",3.0

"Fantastic, Fresh Food! You will not be dissappointed!Even though their paninis are pretty pricey for Bensonhusrts, they are so tasty and fresh. Their salad portions are also huge.I also LOVE the fact that they offer whole wheat bread. My only complaint is that the staff should ask you whether you want whole wheat bread or regular. They don't do that and so I forget to get my panini with whole wheat bread. Also, they don't ask whether you want your salad dressing on the side when you get an order to go and then my salad gets soggy by the time I get to eating it. As a matter of course, all to-go salads should have the dressing on the side!!!!!Anyways, I do LOVE their paninis!",4.0

"Best of ingredients, however, they need to provide the customer with a greater quantity of them. I swear that they must make about a dozen paninnis with a single 3 oz. can of Italian tuna. The female wait staff is certainly friendly enough but I don't need 4 or 5 of them to ask me if everything is ok, or if anybody has taken my order halfway through my paninni. The place is clean and efficient but too small. I don't want to be able to smell the deodorant, or the lack of it on the people piled on top of me. How can a desert crepe prepared 3 feet from my table arrive to me cold ?  If you are a hearty diner trying to lose weight and just enjoy dining in public then this is the place for you. If you are uneasy with being stared at for 25 to 30 minutes by the 2 or 3 local loiterers, then you most likely will want to stay away to avoid the temptation of confronting the loiterers and creating a ""scene"".

This is actually the 2nd time I ordered from them since they use the new panini bread, hoping they might switch back the old bread, but disappointed once again.

I had panini both times (b/c the 1st time it was just so good). Crispy, flavorful, fresh, moist panini bread. Ordered the smoked salmon w/ goat cheese. Great combination and great sandwich. I also couldn't resist a frozen hot chocolate - it hit the spot throughout the meal.

Amazing. You can't find a better spot to just grab a bite to eat.   I will continue to go here for an amazing meal.

"Went here with my boyfriend on a Monday night. I had the smoked salmon panino ( includes avocado, red onions). It was big, toasty, fresh & delicious. My boyfriend had the prosciutto panino, it was just as delicious. The coffee is delicious too.  Tasty food Good Prices Good Customer ServiceDefinitely will go back.",5.0
The salmon and avocado with goat cheese panini packed a flavor punch. There was a party in my mouth and I was having a blast. The only negative thing I have to say is the order took way too long to arrive. There were about 3 other tables occupied with a couple of people so I dont understand why my table was so special that they took so long.,4.0
"The hubby and I went for a late brunch today, I had been bugging him to go with me for a while and he finally gave in. I had been thinking about a panini but ended up trying a savory crepe because I was in a lighter-meal mood. My crepe had prosciutto, mozzarella and arugula, with a balsamic glaze drizzled on top. I also had a lemonade smoothie since the sun was out when we went in and it was starting to warm up. Hubby opted for a simple green tea and grilled chicken cesar wrap. The wrap was also pressed in the panini machine, making the exterior a bit crispy. I loved my crepe, although it was quite salty because they filled it with a generous amount of prosciutto. I still ended up eating it all...The mister said his wrap was tasty, but felt it was a little pricey for the size. Service was good, the girls were as quick as possible with the place filling up rapidly after we arrived. Next time I'll try a panini, or a sweet crepe...or maybe both?",4.0

"1st time was about 6 months ago. Just went again for a 2nd time. Once again they exceeded my expectations. I would give the food and service 6 stars if i could. I had panini both times (b/c the 1st time it was just so good). Crispy, flavorful, fresh, moist panini bread. Ordered the smoked salmon w/ goat cheese. Great combination and great sandwich. I also couldn't resist a frozen hot chocolate - it hit the spot throughout the meal. Every dish is given great care when made.The waitresses were awesome - always on top of things and never behind on anything. Great small local place right around the corner. Not a lot of food can be stored in such a small space - so fresh food is always guaranteed!",5.0

"Such a cute little place to drink coffee, eat, and study! Their food is very good and hearty -  I tried their minestrone, and if they know you are sharing, they split if for you! At first when they brought out the 2 bowls of soup, we were like, ""oh we just ordered one soup"" because each one of them is a normal size soup! Man, if I ordered the soup and ate it by myself.. I would probably have leftovers (damn it, i shouldn't have shared so I can have some at home!). Anyway, the soup is hot, flavorful, filled with fresh ingredients, and comes with amazing toast. Then we got 2 plates of bruchetta - asparagus with parmigiano reggiano and truffle oil (which is my favorite!) and mozzarella with tomato and fresh basil. Everything is just so fresh and tasty! The bread might be a little TOO crispy, but it's still good. Then I got the cappuccino, which is very good, but just kind of small and not hot :( I was slightly disappointed in the temperature. But I have had their iced coffee before and it's also very good. (That one definitely doesn't have any temperature or size problems haha)There is also free wi-fi there! That's why I say it's good to study at. Staff is soo friendly. The owner is always helpful and makes amazing food :) Everyone always has a smile on their faces. Good, cozy, family-owned business.",4.0
"Absolutely loved this place! Came here with one of my friends after someone suggested it to him late last Thursday. We got the Bruschetta Di Pomodoro as apps, which were nice and not that filling. Then we shared the Prosciutto Cotto with mozzarella, tomato and mayo. The portion was big enough to share and it was so good, probably the best panini I had.  Obviously there was room for dessert and we share the Nuttella crepe with strawberries. Amazing! I will be coming back and I will be bringing friends! They also have a byow (bring your own wine) which i think is great since they don't sell liquor. The prices are extremely reasonable also!",5.0

"I've been living in the neighborhood for almost a year and finally decided to stop in for lunch with my brother. The food was good, but the service was AWFUL. To me good service and good food go hand in hand. Not happening in this case. These young girls were too busy talking about God knows what amongst themselves that tending to customers was not important.

No more Panino Rustico for me.",1.0
"I am coming home late on a Friday night talking to my boyfriend about what we should eat for lunch the next day and all of a sudden a guy, who was supposedly in a deep slumber, awakens to our conversation and suggests Panino Rustico. With such a great plug for this place and the fact that it was close-by home, we ventured to this new spot in Bensonhurst. This cozy corner has plenty of dining tables for guests, as well as a skinny counter for those in want of some sun. The restaurant is family-owned and the staff is made up of its members. Our mystery person was the son of the owner and a great guy. He greeted us warmly when we entered the restaurant and made a concerted effort to make us feel welcomed. He also served us a complimentary plate of assorted cheeses, olives, and bread with olive oil! I ordered the smoked salmon with goat cheese, red onion, avocado, and truffle oil. They do not skimp on ingredients here: the goat cheese was creamy, the avocado freshly cut, and the red onion awakened my taste buds. The smoked salmon was thick and peeked out from the crispy, crunchy bread. However, I liked my boyfriend's panini even more than mine - the prosciutto with mozzarella, tomato and basil pesto. A thick slice of mozzarella held together home-made prosciutto. The basil pesto percolated through the layers and infused the bread, and pulled together a great sandwich. The sandwiches are sizeable, neither one of us could finish both halves. The great part about the proscuitto/mozzarella panini is that it reheated very well and maybe even better for a midnight snack =).  In summary: Great neighborhood joint, great people, great sandwiches.",4.0

Long story short...after we ate our panini, we called them back and ordered two more of the salmon one! SUPER DELICIOUS...and the texture of the bread was perfect.

He also got the beef barley soup which was very good too. we shared the apple cinnamon crepe with caramel sauce and it was also very good. We just love it and it's 2 minutes from the house. Try the cafe frappe, yummy! so nothing bad to say about this place AT ALL. Go and enjoy. they also deliver.",5.0

"First time here, and the staff was very friendly and quite helpful. We chose two panini; #20 - chicken, fresh mozz, arugula, peppers, and #27 - porchetta and broccoli rabe, which was our fave.  Shame we don't live in the neighborhood, the sandwiches were delicious!  If we find ourselves nearby again, it's a stop I would make in a heartbeat.",4.0

Great food Great atmosphere The best crepes and sandwiches.  We all had a great time.  We will be back especially for the nutella crepe and the smoked salmon sandwich.,5.0
"I've been here twice already and plan on visiting much more...the menu is pretty expansive for such a small place and each dish is made with care - fantastic bread and excellent ingredients. There's a television mounted on the wall, which my husband especially likes so he can watch a game while we enjoy our coffee and crepes or a delicious sandwich. The staff is extremely nice and helpful, I think one of the waitress is the owner's daughter and she's got a wonderful demeanor and was very attentive. Very impressed, we needed a place like this in the neighborhood.",5.0
