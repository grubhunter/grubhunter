"This review is only for their brunch, which is fantastic! My boyfriend and I arrived at around 11:45 am on a recent Saturday and it was pretty packed. They don't take reservations for brunch, so go early or be prepared to wait. There were people waiting for seats by the time we left maybe an hour or so later. We were seated at the chef's counter, which is a fun experience. The two drawbacks about this is that it's pretty warm in that area due to the open kitchen, and the back room only has two small windows that open to a brick wall and plants, so it's not lit by sunlight. The front area has two cute window tables that fit two or three people, and there is also a good sized bar. The back room has tables against the wall, a long community table, and then a long chef's counter, which is fun to sit at because you can watch everyone cooking and orders going out. We each got an iced coffee, which were strong and large. I got the duck hash (I had heard so much about it!) and he got the biscuit benedict. (The biscuits were delicious and had a great fluffy texture!) I was glad that the portions were large and everything was really tasty! I seriously loved this brunch. Other people have said that the duck hash is too small, but I found it to be a lot of food and very filling. There were tons of potatoes. It was a bit too salty for me, so I took some of my boyfriend's really tasty lettuce (it had some dressing on it) and put it on the hash. We also ordered a side of the sausage, which was also really good. The service was wonderful. Professional, efficient, and friendly. We hardly had to wait for anything. We ordered the salted caramel custard doughnuts to go and enjoyed them at Brooklyn Bridge Park. Our bill was around $60, but we did order a lot. I think they have a really reasonably priced menu with something for everyone. My boyfriend always complains when a restaurant's brunch menu doesn't have a plate of just classic eggs, bacon, and toast, and he was definitely satisfied by the biscuit benedict!",5.0
"This place has a lot of hype, so I was excited to try it. I sat down and went straight for the wine list, told the gentleman at the bar we were interested in something natural with a bit of bottle fermentation; I threw around phrases like carbonic maceration, etc. He sort of smiled at me and told me they focus on natural wines, and then pointed out what seemed like a very interesting choice, from a place I've never drank wine from, made with some indigenous grapes or what have you. Anyway, it was good but he ignored what I was actually asking for in the wine and just went for what he saw as interesting/sellable. Whatever, it will do.The starter was nice: cauliflower with anchovies, tons of citrus and butter flavor with the caramelized vegetable. I wish we stuck to the small plates, but we decided we should try some meat, and opted for the most grand option: a steak (bavette cut to be exact). I've had a lot better, and for $32 I expected a lot more. It was overcooked, and it had a really bad charred flavor, none of the smoke/fattiness you would expect from a grilled piece of prime beef. It came with a handful of fries and about 4 leaves of red mizuna. Unfortunately I felt pretty disappointed about it.It's a great space, and the menu looks promising, but I was unhappy with 2 out of 3 things. The service, though perfectly attentive, was incredibly pedantic -- I actually heard the same pitch used over and over again at people sitting all around us and it began to echo with annoyance. I might go back, but only if someone else is footing the bill, there are a lot better options for their price point.",2.0
"My absolute favorite spot in New York City!  Service is always top notch and the food beyond words -- in a very positive way!!I love the interior design, from the open kitchen to the stylish bar.  The play urban music here so although they have a fancy style it's still a place I'd feel comfortable going to in flats.  The crostini with ricotta cheese, mint and honey is DIVINE! I'd move in here if I could.  I absolutely love Colonie",5.0
"Went to Colonie on Tuesday night to meet a friend that lives in the area. It was excellent! We didn't have a reservation (which I would recommend) and it was quite busy around 8:30pm on a Tuesday. We had to wait a few minutes, but we were able to order a drink while we did it was no big deal. We had heard from a friend that the best place to sit was at the ""kitchen table"" and that's where we were seated. The reason it's called the kitchen table is because it's a long bar stool area around the open kitchen. It was Awesome! There were 3 chefs cooking in the kitchen and we were able to watch them prepare all of the food for the restaurant, while enjoying our own meals. It was so interesting to see and very entertaining! My friend and I both ordered the Tagliatelle and it was really good! Fresh homemade pasta with just cheese, butter and pepper. So simple yet very tasty. I would definitely recommend. I also had a very interesting glass of wine. It was an orange wine, but considered a Pinot Grigio, which I had never heard of! My friend ordered the fig cake for dessert and that was so much better than expected! It was a great texture and tasted perfect. Check out Colonie & don't forget to request the ""kitchen table."" I'll be back when I return to the Brooklyn Heights area!",5.0
"I had a good brunch expeience at Colonie. My cousin, her friend and I decided to meet up here to catch up with each other and enjoy some good eats. I had heard nuff about their duck hash and was looking forward to indulging. We were seated at a corner of the Chefs table and were immediately greeted by Chef Paul. We watched him and his team pump out dish after dish; damn that bacon looks good, oh look thats the shrimp and grits, yum look at how thick the biscuits are, oooo look at that pancake! I was sold!...Two orders of shrimp and grits with a side of bacon and one order of buttermilk pancakes with creme fraiche and maple syrup; Ill save the duck hash for my next visit. Drinkwise, I went with their Cool Hand Cuke a mix of organic cucumber vodka, St. Germaine, cucumber juice and mint syrup. I'm a complete sucker for cucumber anything so my drink was absolutely delish and refreshing. The shrimp and grits looked very appetizing. The shrimp were large and the heirloom grits had mushrooms and shallots; My cousin and her friend said they were very flavorful. After watching Chef Paul make my pancake I kind of knew, texture wise, what to expect. It's one pancake, made in a small frying pan; which gave a nice crust to the outside of the cake. It reminded me a bit of a pound cake just with a crust on the outside. Dense cake but still soft on the inside and rich from the buttermilk. The maple syrup soaked right in and the freshly whipped creme fraiche made them that much better. We made sure to save room for dessert. I knew the doughnuts were a must get but decided to ask the waitress her opinion of what's better, the monkey bread or the doughnuts? (both were equally popular throughout Yelp reviews) With no hesitation, she said the doughnuts Lol Chef Paul even commented and said yeah the doughnuts are a must get, he likes them better than the monkey bread too. I thought that was pretty funny as hes the one that makes the monkey bread and the pastry chef makes the doughnuts. We were brought out four cinnamon sugar donuts filled with salted caramel custard, you could legit see the custard oozing out of the doughnuts! They weren't large in size but more so the perfect amount for the three of us. We each had one and after the first bite my mouth was filled with creamy sugary goodness. I'm pretty sure I had sugar all over my mouth lol After the next bite came the slight saltiness from the custard filling, which was nice contrast. The donuts were warm and a great after meal treat, so good my cousin and I fingerlicked the bowl lolI would love to come back for the duck hash and to try more drinks.",4.0
"Great vibes! I was very pleased to be here for a date night. People were in variable dress so if you were dressed up or more casual you felt comfortable. We had oysters which were delicious! I loved their market fresh fish stuffed with fennel and herbs. My boyfriend had casta rigante which was good, but nothing really special. It was a heavier taste than expected. The service was good - our waitress was very concerned that everything was delicious and enjoyable. They didn't ask to take our coats, and could have checked in more, but did quite well considering how busy it was. It is a noisy spot with music and clustered tables, but that's typical of this area (as a NJ person). Creative cocktails - yummy. I had the antique roadshow and he had a winter in Oaxaca that were both yummy. Great spot! Will come again. Several groups that seemed happy having larger group dinners.",4.0
"I came here for brunch and really enjoyed the drinks. The bloody Mary's were one of the best Ive had, I really enjoyed the one with clam juice as well.  The food was also very good.  The only thing is they don't take reservations so be prepared to wait if you go during the weekend like I did.  They do allow you to start ordering drinks while you wait so that's a plus.",4.0
"The only reason I didn't give this place four stars is the TIGHTLY packed tables/noise level.  It's already pretty loud in here, but the problem is compounded by having only a two inch gap between tables.  I couldn't hear anything the waitress said and had to strain to hear my dining companion.The space is very pretty and the living wall is gorg.  The burger was maybe the best I've ever had and the cocktail list is extensive.   Honestly, I may be back to check out their dollar oysters  at the bar, but I can't see cramming myself into one of the tables again.",3.0
"This place is just bad. I've been here a few times because I want to like it but every time is more disappointing than the last. The food always takes forever and they always have an excuse not an apology. The tipping point was when i came here with a larger group. After we waited an hour and 45 mins and only received coffee we simply got up and walked out. It was getting a little crazy. The manager, who is a rude, nasty, unprofessional person had come over to our table multiple times to provide excuses for why the food is taking so long. Never once said sorry, brought us more coffee or anything. As we left he proceeded to curse at us! He acted like a total nut. AND of course instead of apologizing for the horrible experience gave us a bill that had things on it we never received.",1.0
"Okay, so Colonie is not a 3 star restaurant.  Every time I return, it's a memorable, good (sometimes great) meal.  Their vegetable section is unparalleled - I love their brussel sprouts, spaghetti squash, and cauliflower.  These dishes are hearty enough to have two as a main course.Tip: although I generally dislike well done red meat, if you want your burger done medium well, you should emphasize this to your waiter.  My boyfriend has never received a medium well burger, though that's how he orders it to be cooked.",4.0

"Damn, my neighborhood is sexy and sophisticated! Not only because I ooze that stuff (obviously... not really.... nope,) but because of places like Colonie.Came here on a Saturday night with my sister and had a brilliant time. We walked in and I immediately felt a sense of calm. The ambiance is classic but trendy; the kind of place you go to if you want to impress a date. All the tables are candlelit. Yet it wasn't annoyingly pretentious (save for the hostess*). Aka, my kind of place. Oh, and the cocktails are great, too! I ordered this cucumber-infused number. Will have to try one of their ""orange"" wines next time (apparently that's a thing) and the food. *Unlike the bartenders who were super friendly, the hostess was very pretentious and almost seemed bothered by our presence. Maybe she was just having a bad day?",5.0
Love this place! Always a good scene. Everything I've had on the menu has been delicious - don't miss the sticky date cake!,5.0
cute space and food was pretty good.Came here for brunch! we had the monkey bread to start. Be warned that it's sweet and it's best to share amongst friends; but it's delicious! i'd recommend having it with a piping hot cuppa joe. Their bloody mary was decent. Could be a tinge spicier.had the duck hash which was actually REALLY good. i was on a low-cab diet so it was a poor choice for me since it's packed with potatoes. The shrimp and grits look awesome!,4.0
"Brunch: Lets confront this off the bat, throw your diet away and get the doughnuts. They are out of this world, pastry chef level quality, delicate French cream filled pillows of wonderfulness. I cannot express this sentiment enough. The iced coffee is silky smooth nitrogen infused and the hot is French pressed. You could leave after the coffee and doughnuts, the other dishes are good but won't get you back to that first high. The Benedict is yummy, with a small spatter of greens and a delightful lemon sauce, same with the kale omelet. If you want to be decadent go for the duck hash. It's certainly screams ""brunch"" not diner at this Neaveux American haunt for the rich if not so famous of Brooklyn Heights & Cobble Hill. It's a big crowd pleaser with out of town friends and even the skeptical manhattanites that come my way. The doors open at 11 AM and there is a considerably long line by that time - they do not take brunch reservations.Dinner is not a disappoint either, think farm-to-table and a lot of flavoring with bacon. The restaurant is always noisy and crowded, but somehow still manages to be an intimate date or friend setting.",4.0
"Solid 4 stars for brunch (may be a 4.5 on next visit)For some reason the menu just never intrigued us enough to stop in Colonie; however, when in desperate need of brunch and not wanting to walk any further we finally took the plunge today.  Despite being packed a table freed up and we were squeezed in.  Tables are tight and it is insanely loud so don't expect to have much of a conversation with whoever you are with, but nonetheless, it has a good vibe. Our waitress was awesome (Kristin I think) and really set the tone for meal.  She was really good at answering questions with not just an answer but guidance.  When my wife was curious about the iced coffee she said it was awesome and ""came from a keg"". Sure enough it arrived looking like a beer and was perfection.  Strong but not too strong and not too bitter. We went with the eggs Benedict on biscuits and and the duck hash.  Presentation was perfect and the dishes looked impressive and were a generous portion size.  The eggs Benedict was very good but the biscuits were seriously undercooked.  I am sure they would have swapped out, but we decide to just eat as was. The duck hash was the real standout. Great flavor and a ton of duck. In the end we ended up splitting our dishes as they were the perfect combination together.  A little duck over the hollandaise was delightful as was mixing in with the hash. We are definitely getting this combo again and just splitting from beginning. Only criticism of hash is that they need to give you two eggs.  One is not enough and leaves the hash dry in the end. Of course we so wanted the basket of made to order donuts but will have to save for next trip....which may be next Saturday or even tomorrow night!",4.0
"Everything was spot on here. My drink was delicious n strong, a cocktail called talent scout, like an old fashioned with extra orange. My friend's burger was the best, I stole a share of that. The barman was great, and the place looks lovely. There's no reason to drop a star!",5.0
"This place is so cute! I am really thrilled that it is in my neighborhood. The staf is very friendly, I had their burger, it was good, I definitely want to be back to try more food and hang out there on the weekends. I want to have a brunch day there with my girls too!",4.0
"What a cute brunch spot! Let me preface this by saying that only half our table ordered correctly (50% of my party would most likely give this 2 or 3 stars). The burger is not to be missed (their housemade beet ketchup is unreal!), as are the house ricotta crostini and monkey bread. The biscuits are delicious. I would recommend the Benedict, as one of our guests loved it.On to the drinks. You can't go wrong here. If you're looking for a little spice, the chili margarita is delicious, but if you are craving something light and Spring-y, don't miss out on the Cool Hand Cuke- it's to die for (more like a silent killer).  The disappointing plates were shrimp & grits and leek and gruyere scramble. They lacked in both flavor and portion. We also ordered a couple baskets of donuts which only contained the seasonal custard inside and were displeased with both the size and flavor. We were hoping for nutella (as the menu promised). Overall, I gave it a 4 because I ordered right (burger/cool hand cuke) not to mention the service and ambiance were off the charts. I think we'll all be back, now that we know what to order.",4.0
"Literally just walking out of this place and am disgusted by the service we received. Our waitress Courtney refused to take my friends dish off the bill, which she did not even touch. When my friend asked why we were still being charged, she said her manager said she wasn't allowed to take it off the bill since she offered to replace the dish. I done out every night and have never, in my past 7 years in New York received this kind of service. Good luck to this spot!",1.0

"We visited Colonie back in November right before Thanksgiving. When we arrived for our 8pm reservation the place was bumping! The bar/entry area is very small so we were shoulder to shoulder with the folks around us. They were a tad backed up the night we dined but were very apologetic and kept good communication with us while we waited. I think we ordered everything on the menu and it was all phenomenal, no joke. The house made ricotta and pork chop were especially good. I am super impressed with the exec chef who grew up in small town Maine and made it in the big city! Bravo Colonie!",5.0
"Too many little things made this place a place I wouldn't visit again. My inlaws, great uncle, sister-in-law, fiancé, and I arrived at 11 when the place opened but every table was already full so we had to sit around the open kitchen. I didn't mind because it's pretty cool to see the system of setting up plates. The layout was odd since we were far from each other, and the waitstaff had to awkwardly get close to us to hear anything since the loud hip hop music was blasting. Not brunch music and not at 11 in the morning. Lower the music. I ordered the Cool Hand Cuke after ready countless reviews saying this was the best cocktail. Maybe it's my palate but this cocktail was not great. For $12 about 1/3 of the glass was empty, I tasted no mint what so ever, and it basically tasted like bad pickle juice. I was disappointed. Now onto the food. My fiancé ordered the duck hash and I was quite impressed. Every element on his plate worked in harmony. My mother-in-law was not very pleased with her eggs benedict. She said the poached egg was undercooked and the hollendaise was thin and weak. We ordered the donuts and the one I had was good. Peanut butter mousse inside a freshly fried donut? Yeah, they were good. The biscuits were also very good. Now my entree was a complete bust. I ordered the shrimp and grits. I also added the fried egg for an extra $3. The grits tasted pretty good but were cold. The mushrooms that topped the grits were chewy and spongelike. The shrimp were a serious issue. I'm all about paying for good food and I don't mind if a place is a little more expensive as long as the food is worth it, but this meal wasn't. 2 of my shrimp were overcooked while 2 were undercooked. Out of the ones I received 1 wasn't deveined. Are you kidding me? I could barely eat anything on my plate and it was almost $20. What a waste. The fried egg was overcooked and rubbery on the bottom and the whites were barely set on top. My dish was mostly a bust. The kitchen moved quickly but I would have much rather waited for hot, cleaned, well cooked food.",3.0

"One of our favorite local brunch spots.  Its on the more expensive side but the food is always great quality and delicious, the cocktails are great too.It can be a bit of a squeeze if you sit at the open kitchen but its really cool to watch the chefs cook your brunch.All the dishes we've tried have been fantastic, my husband loves the duck hash, I have had the scramble, pancakes and burger a couple of times, the monkey bread is to die for and the doughnut basket is heaven.Try the Cool Hand Cuke, its a really refreshing and different cocktail!",4.0
"I came with a large group (12+) and we were entertaining clients. They even customized our menu's with our company names! The staff was excellent, their service was impeccable for such a large party. My glass was never empty and plates were cleared quickly. The food, however, was inconsistent from plate to plate.Spaghetti Squash Salad: Must eat.Carrots with Yogurt: Skip it.Hanger Steak: I thought it was under seasoned, but learned that one should use the aioli and table salt to tie it all together. The fries, on the other hand, were drowning in salt. As a lover of dessert, the sticky date cake rocked my world. It's the best dessert I've had (out) in a very long time. The donuts, on the other hand, were ok.I'd come back, but only pick certain dishes!",4.0

"A must for brunch! Not at all far from Manhattan, and also a great distance from Brooklyn Bridge if you're walking to/from Manhattan. The juice is freshly squeezed, which is always a pleasant surprise. The biscuit benedict was also lovely! I loved the atmosphere -- it's a pleasant and beautiful restaurant. We were lucky enough to get seats by the kitchen area so we could see everyone at work. I am still dreaming of the donuts that I had here. They were incredible -- warm, crispy on the outside, perfectly soft on the inside, and the filling would just dribble out.

"Sigh. The location of this brunch spot is ideal for Cobble Hill/Brooklyn Heights residents, but it fails to deliver. Before I get into the bad, I will say the restaurant is GORGEOUS.

I love the high ceilings, plus it was nice and cool on a rather warm day (I'm sure it's toasty when the temperature drops).But on to the bummers: Our service was sluggish, the food was just fine and everything was rather overpriced for the area. The waiters and waitresses here seem the be the main complaint of the Yelp reviews, and I totally get it. There seems to be some major miscommunication between the kitchen staff and the servers. I think if they polished up the menu, knocked off a couple bucks from the mains and got everyone talking to each other this could be a sweet spot in Brooklyn Heights close to the park.

"I'm not quite sure why this restaurant has such great reviews. I went there last night and ordered the oysters, which were delicious, the mushroom pasta, ricotta crostinis and the brussel sprouts with bacon. Everything was just ok. Based on the reviews we probably should have ordered a meat but the pasta is homemade and brussel sprouts are usually super tasty. The Brussels were over cooked and very dry. The mushroom pasta had a good sauce on it but it was nothing spectacular bc it was pretty much a vodka sauce. The crostinis with ricotta were fluffy and the taste was super subtle. I don't think I'll go back again but if I do I would definitely go with a meat dish rather than a pasta! I sat next to a guy who order the pork chop and he LOVING the cabbage.",3.0
"The pork chop changed my life. I will weep daily knowing I live in LA and this chop is so far from me. The creamy polenta it rested on was outstanding. Foodie heaven. Cant say enough kind words about this place. GET THE PORK CHOP! Ok, I am done. PORK CHOP!!!!!!Ok now I am done.",5.0
"The weather was getting nice again, which means Sunday brunch! The wait at Colonie was about 45 minutes, but it was well worth it.We were a group of five, and they sat us at the counter in front of the open kitchen. I spent most of the meal marveling at all the things the chefs were making and how delicious it all looked. From my time at the bar, I can tell you that the shrimp and grits were super popular, as was their burger (special of the day). They also bake their biscuits and burger buns in house, which is cool.Speaking of, get the biscuits. Just do it. Comes with fresh churned butter and jam. Flakey, buttery, yummy. An order comes with two.For my main, I had the duck hash. If you're hungry, you won't be after this. In addition to the potatoes, which are filling, they give you a TON of duck and a poached egg. Spiced just right, very delicious and reasonably priced at around $15.Service was great and quick.The only thing I'll fault them for is their coffee.

"January 2015:AVOID unless you are a vacuous trust fund kid for whom novelty is more important than quality.  Why you need to be vacuous too?  Because the noise level is so ghastly that you can't even talk to the person 6 inches away from you never mind the waitstaff who fein a preposterous air of self-importance and think ignoring you is their way to salvation.  Of course in their defense the tables are so close together that getting near a patron takes enormous agility and cunning.  The good news is that you cannot hear anything the waiters say and can thus blithely ignore the absurdly overpriced specials - can a burned trout really be worth $36 or a perfectly ordinary hamburger justify an $18 price tag. And yes you have to wait 5 minutes for a waiter to appear whom  you can then beg for ketchupThe place is modeled on economy class airline seating. If you enjoy sitting in the lap of the patron next to you, this is the place to go.The food? a pompous menu offers little choice - 4 entrees when we visited. Yet even so, the food is mediocre and seems largely based on grilling dead things in oil till their skin turns black.  The entrees are ""modestly"" sized and a few florets of some cruciferous vegetable will add an extra $9 to the price.  The $9 side salad had 15 very small leaves of some greenish thing(s): the local green grocer sells the same leaves for 99 cents.  Did I say AVOID?  Good, that's what I meant.",1.0
I've been to Colonie before and had great meals. Today was not so great. We were seated at the chefs table where I had to watch the chef handle raw hamburger meat with his bare hands then pick up fresh salads with the same hands and finish plates off. I ordered the eggs Benedict. One egg was cooked fully through with a hard yolk and the second was undercooked with runny whites. A new chef came in and took over as we were finishing and the first thing he did was put gloves on to handle the burger meat.... Very inconsistent meal and service.  The atmosphere is always great but I don't think I can eat there again if that same chef is there.,2.0
"Really enjoyed our dinner at Colonie.  We were time-pressed and ate at the bar -- which, like the rest of the place, was beautifully furnished.  The bartender, Nathan, was super-nice, and knowledgeable about the menu.  Food was excellent: we had the mussels, the Cresta Regate pasta, and the burger and all three were very good.",5.0

"I had brunch on Sunday, and although the staff was friendly and attentive, the food left something to be desired. I had Eggs Benedict served on a cold stale biscuit, which arrived 5 minutes before my wife's food, which was scrambled eggs with a cold side of potatoes. The side order of Berkshire bacon, was nothing more than bacon chips in 2 inch diameter cup. Also cold.To top off everything, lukewarm coffee in a less than a single serving French press. I don't care what's being served for brunch, if the coffee is not hot....game over!",1.0
"January 2015:AVOID unless you are a vacuous trust fund kid for whom novelty is more important than quality.  Why you need to be vacuous too?  Because the noise level is so ghastly that you can't even talk to the person 6 inches away from you never mind the waitstaff who fein a preposterous air of self-importance and think ignoring you is their way to salvation.  Of course in their defense the tables are so close together that getting near a patron takes enormous agility and cunning.  The good news is that you cannot hear anything the waiters say and can thus blithely ignore the absurdly overpriced specials - can a burned trout really be worth $36 or a perfectly ordinary hamburger justify an $18 price tag. And yes you have to wait 5 minutes for a waiter to appear whom  you can then beg for ketchupThe place is modeled on economy class airline seating. If you enjoy sitting in the lap of the patron next to you, this is the place to go.The food? a pompous menu offers little choice - 4 entrees when we visited. Yet even so, the food is mediocre and seems largely based on grilling dead things in oil till their skin turns black.  The entrees are ""modestly"" sized and a few florets of some cruciferous vegetable will add an extra $9 to the price.  The $9 side salad had 15 very small leaves of some greenish thing(s): the local green grocer sells the same leaves for 99 cents.  Did I say AVOID?  Good, that's what I meant.",1.0
I've been to Colonie before and had great meals. Today was not so great. We were seated at the chefs table where I had to watch the chef handle raw hamburger meat with his bare hands then pick up fresh salads with the same hands and finish plates off. I ordered the eggs Benedict. One egg was cooked fully through with a hard yolk and the second was undercooked with runny whites. A new chef came in and took over as we were finishing and the first thing he did was put gloves on to handle the burger meat.... Very inconsistent meal and service.  The atmosphere is always great but I don't think I can eat there again if that same chef is there.,2.0
"Really enjoyed our dinner at Colonie.  We were time-pressed and ate at the bar -- which, like the rest of the place, was beautifully furnished.  The bartender, Nathan, was super-nice, and knowledgeable about the menu.  Food was excellent: we had the mussels, the Cresta Regate pasta, and the burger and all three were very good.",5.0
Cute restaurant on Atlantic avenue. The brunch was great. Good presentation and service. The leek scramble was done very nicely as the eggs were fluffy and savory. The sausage add on was nice too as it was house made patty like. Duck hash was delicious with the poached egg on top. Def will go again.,4.0

We went to Colonie for dinner for the first time the other day. We had the ricotta crostini to start and the burger and Tagliatelle...Everything was wonderful. The food was delicious and the service was great.  We enjoyed what we ordered but we both agreed that we would try something else next time: just to see how everything else is.

"Colonie is finally living up to its initial promise. Everything I said previously is still true: the space is absolutely lovely (the open kitchen an excellent touch), the cocktails are superb, and the staff is excellent (although, my waiter did try and convince me that rye was bourbon for some reason).The food seems to have improved leaps and bounds, however, to the point where it matches the rest of the restaurant. You're certainly paying for the privilege, but more than a few dishes are worth the cost. A few favorites:The Smoked Ricotta Raviolo. Raviolo is not a typo: you are only getting one, but the flawless, yolk-filled pasta could indeed be worth $14.The Scallops. If you've never had sunchokes, this is the dish that will make you love them. The Spaghetti Squash Carbonara. Deceivingly listed among the vegetables, this is no side, but a vegetarian main. Hidden underneath a mountain of foam, this could almost serve as an entire meal, and if all vegetarian dishes were this good, I'd give up meat. (OK fine, it has bacon in it.)Perhaps it's a bit too pricey for a regular evening out, but Colonie has become a fine choice for a special occasion; I only wish I had a few more where I wasn't responsible for picking up the check.",4.0
"Have been to Colonie a few times for brunch and just once for dinner. Usually not a bad wait for brunch, which is a rarity these days.

"Delicious brunch with a menu that changes periodically. The service here is not fantastic but not bad enough to warrant missing out on this spot, and the space is airy and bright with a kitchen in the center so you know your food is made to order. As for the food, it's fresh, seasonal, and the portions are generous. I have been twice and tried the donuts both times. The first time I fell in love with the slightly crispy, freshly fried filled donuts. Today's donut, cinnamon sugar with a salted caramel custard filling, was just okay, surprisingly bland in comparison to the selection offered in the fall. The scramble ingredients vary and it's a simple but good option. Today I tried the rib special with honey cornbread, which initially I thought would be too much food, but it was so good I stuffed my face. No regrets.",4.0

Honestly, it tasted like something I could make myself, and I'm not much of a cook.

It's basically 90% hash and 10% duck. We all felt full because of the potatoes but unsatisfied because there's so little duck. Shrimp and grits is a pretty special dish. I like the ingredients a lot. It has all sorts of enoki and wood ear and other sorts of mushrooms. Shrimps taste pretty good too. But the mushrooms are too salty in there. The service and dining atmosphere is excellent.

And this past weekend my *medium* burger came out completely raw in the center - it was literally cool to the touch, mushy, bright red and frankly not something I felt comfortable eating.  The server never came over to check how everything was, so even though I contemplated asking for it to be thrown back on the grill a tad, I never got the opportunity.  Interestingly, my partner had ordered his burger medium rare, and yet I saw them take my burger off the grill well before his (and also saw it sit there for 10 minutes before it was brought to our table, which explains the cool temperature).  The service is very inconsistent - sometimes it can be great, but when they're busy (brunch, weekend nights) it often sucks (looooong waits, multiple forgotten items, no check-ins, etc.).I'm sad.  I wanted to love this place, wanted to recommend it to friends and feel comfortable taking guests here, but I can't count on it to always do the job.  I'd still give it 3 stars, and will still sometimes return on weeknights (there isn't exactly a ton of competition in the immediate area) but meh. The sticky date cake is still really good.",3.0
"I'm not sure how this place is a star short of perfection on Yelp reviews. I walked in on a Sunday night and was greeted by a very amicable host and served by a friendly waitress. I was blown away with the lighting and decor- great ambiance. As an entry I had raw goat cheese and a homemade terrine de camagne- both delicious. My partner and I shared the beet soup, cucumbers (with salmon) and the Colonie Burger, for dessert we had the carrot cake. Everything about this place is homey- especially the food. It all tasted like something you could make yourself at home, if you're a good cook that is. I read a two-starred comment stating that this place was over priced- I'm wondering if we went to the same restaurant?

"Came here with my boyfriend, and was seated at the bar. It wasn't too comfortable, but I can't blame them, the place was hopping.Ordered:Cauliflower - Definitely tasty. Cauliflower was sweet, and the sauce went well with it. The anchovy didn't add to it though, and you have to like capers.Octopus - Did not love, which was disappointing, because I love a good grilled octopus. The meat was tender to the point of being mushy, and the sauce that came with it did not really mix well. Did not finish.Cassoulet - Solid. Very hearty and flavorful, pretty filling.Doughnuts - Was alright, a little bit anti-climactic. Burger - I enjoyed more than my BF, though I like beets and sweet better. Solid, but a little messy and certainly not the best burger I've ever had.Gelato - Pistachio gelato was outstanding. Rich, creamy and nutty.Overall - Food was ok, enjoyment level varied, but everything ran on the rich and heavy side.Service - Was ok. Food was a bit slow (especially dessert... they took a long time with the doughnuts and the gelato was melting by the time they brought both out). Servers were nice enough.",3.0

"My wife and I had dinner here and were completely blown away. Firstly,  incredible decor. The space is timeless elegance but kinda cool. The service was brisk and polite. All the staff seem to really know their stuff and that's rare these days. The music rocks. Seriously, I asked about the playlist several times  it was that good. Combined with all this greatness comes the food. The menu is so creative. Incredible flavour combinations I can't even begin to imagine how one thinks this stuff up! We really had a great night.

"An interesting experience. We went here for brunch on Father's Day. I was surprised we did not have to wait, however we were seated no questions asked at the Chef's Open kitchen/bar in the back.

"Went here for brunch on Sunday. The restaurant had a great ambience, solid menu, and decent wait time (~20 minutes at prime brunch time).  The biggest concern was around their treatment of food allergies. My boyfriend is allergic to eggs. He explained his allergies to the server and ordered the burger without the bun and without the fried egg. When the burger came out it was bunless but was still served with a fried egg. Mistakes happen, but instead of bring out a new burger, the server simply took the egg off and brought out the same patty. Luckily, we noticed bits of egg still on the plate and were able to get a new one made, although that took an additional 15 minutes. Otherwise, the food was fine. The pancakes and burger are both solid options but not spectacular and not worth the $18 price tag. The coffee was very good, but the main draw is the feel of the space, and unfortunately not the food or the service.",2.0

"Brought the children here for brunch on a Sunday afternoon today. We are fairly familiar with the various hot spots to have brunch on the weekends, and we've heard great things about Colonie. I had the Biscuits Benedict which was visually appealing, prepared very well and tasted wonderful. The reason for the poor review is because I had ordered the pancakes for my 2 children. We know pancakes in Brooklyn, and were really looking forward to the wonderful deliciousness as they were well prepared and plated very nicely precut into quarters with a side of whipped cream and maple syrup. They were very excited, but unfortunately found that they oddly tasted very salty in a few bites. After tasting myself and confirming, I was wondering if somehow the chef mixed up fine salt with powered sugar. I let our waiter know and after checking with the kitchen he was very kind enough to replace the order, but they children's appetite was already gone.

"Get. The. Duck. Hash.That's all, folks.Okay, I lied. I have a few more things to say, but you really just should just go to Colonie for brunch and order the duck hash.It's Saturday and you want a Brooklyn brunch.

You want adorable hipster toddlers and friendly hipster servers, and more than anything else...you want good food. You want Colonie.Colonie has a short brunch menu, but they do what they do extremely well. My dad had the almond granola with Greek yogurt - small, but the perfect amount if you're not that hungry. I, however, had just gone on a long run. My dad was taking me out to brunch. I was taking no prisoners: I ordered the duck hash.Now, up until this point, I've been ""meh"" on duck. I had a questionable experience at a French restaurant which perhaps gave me an unfair impression of the meat, but Colonie did much to reverse that opinion. The duck is silky and shredded, clinging in savory little strips to the red bliss potatoes. The poached egg floats lovingly over the potatoes and duck and provides the perfect complement to the flavor of the duck. It was just the right amount of food, and I left full and happy.I'd like to try Colonie at some point for dinner, though that duck hash will be hard to beat. The place is super tiny, and the brunch rush was insane. But hey, it's Brooklyn on a Saturday morning, so I'll stop stating the obvious.",4.0

Came here for dinner with friends ( who are very opinionated) and was thoroughly impressed. The waiters are very helpful in navigating the menu. Must try: date cake for dessert.

"This place was ok.... It wasn't bad but I have certainly had better food than this. Selected colony for brunch as my boyfriend raved about it. We ordered the bread basket which had a yummy lemon ginger muffin, a doughnut, and a scone. The muffin was good but the rest were just average. I selected the poached eggs with ham on a biscuit.  I liked that the meal came with a salad but overall it was incredibly bland with the food being drenched in hollandaise sauce. My boyfriend ordered the duck which was much better. Overall the portion size was great. The food is very dense and filling. I didn't order any cocktails as the mimosas looked too pulpy and the specialty drinks didn't appease me.  For the price I don't understand what everyone is complaining about. It's not outrageously overpriced at all. I think in this case the food could be great for some and not others which doesn't make Colonie bad. The service was a bit slow and the waitress did come to apologize that the kitchen got backed up.

"Okay, I debated between 4 and 5 so just know that although it's not a five, this place is seriously good. Also, this is all based on memory because it has been quite a while since visiting the restaurant (I moved cities).First off, why it can't be a 5 is mainly due to the layout. I went with my friend and her family (all foodies and restaurant people), and we discussed this when they seated us to the side near the window. If they had reorganized some of the seating, there could be room for more tables or maybe overall cleaner space.The food is excellent. We got almost everything on the menu and split it between 4 people. The highlight for me was a pork chop. Cooked amazingly, which is a real treat because some places seem to overcook their pork to a point of undesired dryness. The desserts were all delicious, and whoever mentioned the doughnuts, amen. There was even one dish with a side of homemade mayo. My friend despises mayo and even she was able to eat it (it tasted more refreshing and less like you're being punched in the face with a sauce that should taste 100% like mayo, if you get what I mean).The service is nice. I don't remember our server's name but she was friendly, not pushy or overly accommodating, and she recommended a good wine when we asked. Overall, I really cannot wait to go back when I'm in the city. And you should do the same!",4.0

"Colonie is a tasty brunch and dinner spot.Must complain about service, however.  The most recent time we came the waiter was acting a little odd.  I asked for my eggs scrambled on my favorite duck hash instead of poached, as they are in the menu.  He seriously told me that I wasn't allowed to have them scrambled.  That they had a new *rule*!  I looked crestfallen, and said I'd had the dish that way before.  Then I said I needed more time to pick something else off the menu.  At that point he agreed to bring the eggs scrambled.  Culture shock - I live in the New York of ""Please make my latte with soy milk and half a sugar"" or whatever so I felt really annoyed.Anyway, the food is good, although the room is loud.  Be prepared to stand up for yourself if you get this waiter and you are particular, like me.",3.0
"So Colonie is good, but not amazing. The decor is minimal, urban-rustic-chic, I went for brunch but imagine the evening lighting makes for a romantic space.  The bread basket was tasty and on the smaller side, yet large enough for our 4 top to sample each of the breads and the especially lovely donut. I ordered the flavorful beans and eggs, perfect if you want a lighter brunch item.  I sampled the shrimp and grits, good, flavorful yet not stupendous and was told that the biscuit benedict was delish..it looked as much and the portion was sizable.Overall, Colonie is A-Ok if you happen to be in the neighborhood stop in, I'm sure it will be enjoyable, however, it just didn't hit that 'must return' mark for me.",3.0

Came here for dinner with friends ( who are very opinionated) and was thoroughly impressed. The waiters are very helpful in navigating the menu. Must try: date cake for dessert. Lamb chops received a group nod. Onlyyyy negative IF I'm being very picky is the cocktails are average. But don't think twice about checking out this place.,5.0
"This place was ok.... It wasn't bad but I have certainly had better food than this. Selected colony for brunch as my boyfriend raved about it. We ordered the bread basket which had a yummy lemon ginger muffin, a doughnut, and a scone. The muffin was good but the rest were just average. I selected the poached eggs with ham on a biscuit.  I liked that the meal came with a salad but overall it was incredibly bland with the food being drenched in hollandaise sauce. My boyfriend ordered the duck which was much better. Overall the portion size was great. The food is very dense and filling. I didn't order any cocktails as the mimosas looked too pulpy and the specialty drinks didn't appease me.  For the price I don't understand what everyone is complaining about. It's not outrageously overpriced at all. I think in this case the food could be great for some and not others which doesn't make Colonie bad. The service was a bit slow and the waitress did come to apologize that the kitchen got backed up. No big deal but since the kitchen is out in plan view it looked like they would do a bunch of plates at once then send them out.

"Went on a Saturday for brunch with a group of 6 friends.The restaurant isn't very large and they don't take reservations. We waited about 20 minutes to get seated. I really like the ambiance and decor of the restaurant. The bartenders and servers are all very cool and laid back. There's a beautiful vertical garden in between bar and dining room.One negative thing about eating there on a hot day is that they have an open kitchen right in the main dining area. It can get a bit warm but its totally cool watching the cooks in action.We ordered the breakfast basket ($7) to share with the table. It comes with a cherry scone, carrot muffin and doughnut. All the pastries tasted freshly baked and still warm but the size of it was a joke. They were mini versions so we basically shared a bite and it was a little overpriced to go for a second basket.Everyone really enjoyed their entrees. Portions are not large but the food is fairly rich in butter and fat so I guess its just as well. I had the duck hash which is prepared with roasted potatoes and meaty chunks of duck with one poached egg. I think 2 eggs would have been more standard considering that it was on the smallish side.Hubby got the pancakes and declared it the BEST he's ever had. They were super fluffy and really crispy on the outside-- I presume from being cooked in an obscene amount of butter but my guy was very content.Service was also very good as we were attended by our main waitress as well as other runners. Overall a really nice place to have brunch in Brooklyn Heights.",4.0
"Get over yourself colonie..used to really like this restaurant but went today for brunch and our waiter was a total piece of sh1t. Horrible attitude acting like he was doing us a favor serving us. Totally ruined the experience. This place has a B by the way, not a good sign, but something I overlooked because we had had good experiences previously. They ran out of the pastrami sandwich (at noon, really?!) so I ordered a burger and asked to have it without the egg. Clearly that's too difficult for them as they are very strict about substitutions. I'll be taking my money elsewhere, good riddance.",1.0
"Food was excellent but I was really turned off by how loud and noisy it was inside the restaurant. I had to shout my way thru the entire dinner and my voice was horsy by the end. Also doesn't help that this place had a 1.5h wait, although I guess it was sat nite after all. Place offers lots of small plates, great for sharing with friends. I like the cucumber vinaigrette that comes with their raw oysters. They also had grilled octopus that was very tender. Their beet salad was also well prepared. The beets just melted in your mouth!Overall, I would suggest trying the place on a off night otherwise, prepare to have a shouting match during dinner.",3.0

"I have been to Colonie like four times now, and have become less and less impressed.  The space is beautiful, and the service is timely, but the menu has become lacking and the attitude of the staff is ridiculous.  I don't eat meat, but do eat fish and yet it's VERY hard to find anything on the menu that doesn't have meat in it... even the veggies!  The only entree option was a whole fish, which was so riddled with bones, i had to stop eating it.  They will keep the meat out of some of the veggies, but it all depends on the chef's mood as to what he will subtract from the dish.  My husband wanted to hold the duck egg on his burger and the chef refused to do it.  A little odd to me for a Brooklyn restuarant, and more than little ridiculous since my husband is allergic to duck egg so had to switch his entree. The food quality was ok- but overall expensive for the portions and we both ended up feeling dissatisfied with our meal and the price we paid.  Too many other good options to go back, which is too bad because the space really is cool (though very crowded if that matters to people).",2.0

It can get a bit warm but its totally cool watching the cooks in action.We ordered the breakfast basket ($7) to share with the table. It comes with a cherry scone, carrot muffin and doughnut. All the pastries tasted freshly baked and still warm but the size of it was a joke. They were mini versions so we basically shared a bite and it was a little overpriced to go for a second basket.Everyone really enjoyed their entrees. Portions are not large but the food is fairly rich in butter and fat so I guess its just as well. I had the duck hash which is prepared with roasted potatoes and meaty chunks of duck with one poached egg. I think 2 eggs would have been more standard considering that it was on the smallish side.Hubby got the pancakes and declared it the BEST he's ever had. They were super fluffy and really crispy on the outside-- I presume from being cooked in an obscene amount of butter but my guy was very content.Service was also very good as we were attended by our main waitress as well as other runners. Overall a really nice place to have brunch in Brooklyn Heights.",4.0
"Get over yourself colonie..used to really like this restaurant but went today for brunch and our waiter was a total piece of sh1t. Horrible attitude acting like he was doing us a favor serving us. Totally ruined the experience. This place has a B by the way, not a good sign, but something I overlooked because we had had good experiences previously. They ran out of the pastrami sandwich (at noon, really?!) so I ordered a burger and asked to have it without the egg. Clearly that's too difficult for them as they are very strict about substitutions. I'll be taking my money elsewhere, good riddance.",1.0
"Food was excellent but I was really turned off by how loud and noisy it was inside the restaurant. I had to shout my way thru the entire dinner and my voice was horsy by the end. Also doesn't help that this place had a 1.5h wait, although I guess it was sat nite after all. Place offers lots of small plates, great for sharing with friends. I like the cucumber vinaigrette that comes with their raw oysters. They also had grilled octopus that was very tender. Their beet salad was also well prepared. The beets just melted in your mouth!Overall, I would suggest trying the place on a off night otherwise, prepare to have a shouting match during dinner.",3.0
Went here few times and the food is excellent.  Doughnuts for dessert are delicious.,5.0
"I have been to Colonie like four times now, and have become less and less impressed.  The space is beautiful, and the service is timely, but the menu has become lacking and the attitude of the staff is ridiculous.  I don't eat meat, but do eat fish and yet it's VERY hard to find anything on the menu that doesn't have meat in it... even the veggies!  The only entree option was a whole fish, which was so riddled with bones, i had to stop eating it.  They will keep the meat out of some of the veggies, but it all depends on the chef's mood as to what he will subtract from the dish.  My husband wanted to hold the duck egg on his burger and the chef refused to do it.  A little odd to me for a Brooklyn restuarant, and more than little ridiculous since my husband is allergic to duck egg so had to switch his entree. The food quality was ok- but overall expensive for the portions and we both ended up feeling dissatisfied with our meal and the price we paid.  Too many other good options to go back, which is too bad because the space really is cool (though very crowded if that matters to people).",2.0
"Here for brunch today....Very nice interior; industrial with a rustic feel. Our waitress was excellent! She was very attentive and paid attention to every detail.I had the french toast which came with a berry jam, whipped mascarpone, and maple syrup. It was all delicious and filling. I also had a side of well scrambled eggs ($4).  I passed on a cocktail this morning (was out too late and had one too many drinks last night), so I washed things down with a perfectly brewed earl grey. I will most definitely return here the next time I'm in the BK.",4.0

"Brunch here was really good. Don't be discouraged by the price scale here, brunch is regular $$ price, not $$$. For brunch I got the duck hash, which was really good. For dessert, I got the sticky date cake, which was amazing. Definitely recommend this place for brunch.",5.0
"i've had so much good food in this area that is it hard to top all of the other great restaurants, but OMG Colonie is straight up amazing and i'm still thinking about the ricotta with honey.  i went here on a sunday evening and tried a variety of offerings.  the duck egg was delicious as well as the octopus with fingerlings.  the brussel spouts come in a large order and we couldn't even finish everything.  the cocktails are unique and the atmosphere leaves nothing to be desired...except maybe a little more light in the bathroom.  it was dark in there!!!why not five stars??? the wait between dishes was a little too long in my opinion.  i love to have a long and relaxing dining experience, but it could have been a little faster.  i was HUNGRY...but left super satisfied.highly recommended and the staff is the best eye candy around.",4.0
"This is the first place I dined at in Brooklyn, and I think it may have ruined me for other restaurants in the borough. Beautifully designed and thoroughly inviting.

I've been in for both brunch and dinner and I've left extremely happy and satisfied every time.",5.0
"I've come here for the brunch which is really good. However, this review is for dinner.  I didn't make a reservation so we were seated at a bar table by the window.  It was surprisingly comfortable for a small triangular table for 3. The cocktail menu is very good and the ambience has a cool vibe to it. My dinner guest pointed out that their drink menu is quite extensive with specialty liquids. For apps we had a the liver mousse crostini and duck egg farro. Both were very good with taste and texture. For entrees we had the pork chop - seasoned very well but very slightly overcooked and scallops - average. The scallops were one of the specials of the night. It was very fresh and perfectly cooked. However the dish lacked texture and flavor. It was disappointing bc the portion was also too small to fill me up. $27 for 5 scallops wasn't really worth it. The the roasted Brussels sprouts with dried cranberries  did make up for it though. The restaurant is full of ambience and food is very good. I will definitely return to try other dishes and would recommend to anyone looking for a trendy new American restaurant.",4.0

"I'm docking them a star because the brunch burger used to be my favorite item on the menu (heck, possibly my favorite burger of all time, exluding my grandmother's of course), but something about it has changed in the last few months. It used to come juicy with piquant spicy mayo on the bun and a restaurant-made ketchup blend for the shoestring fries that was both tangy and sweet.  I'm ashamed to say it, but I wouldn't wash my hands after eating that burger so I could smell them later in the day to remind myself of its sensory delights. For whatever reason it's now more pedestrian, something akin to a Shake Shak burger, and I'm left wondering if it was all a dream or if some sadistic kitchen warden decided that the human race did not deserve such a palate-pleasing comestible.Okay, I'm done with the hyperbole.

"I was in town for a wedding nearby and the bride recommended Colonie as a good place to find some brunch. My cousins and I walked over and arrived late - about 1:45 on a Sunday - and were seated almost immediately by the charming host. I loved the open kitchen and the wall of greenery hanging beside it. We ordered iced coffees (a ginger beer for my cousin) and all were refreshing after the muggy walk over. We ordered the duck hash, the biscuit Benedict, and the hamburger with fries. All were really, truly delicious. The duck hash was super-savory and rich - those potatoes were fried up perfectly! The duck interspersed was tender and awesome. Not a traditional ""hash"" in that everything is put together and fried up, but still awesome. Add a runny poached egg and you've got a winner.I'm not normally a fan of Benedicts (see discussion of hollandaise in Bourdain's ""Kitchen Confidential"") but this one was excellent, both the parts and the whole. The biscuit was divine, the ham salty, the eggs perfectly poached, and the hollandaise rich yet tart - it had a lovely lemon presence and I died over it. All hollandaises should be so lemony! All together it was a fantastic bite. I did not try the burger but my cousin reported it was excellent. We nibbled on his fries, which looked like they were not going to be that good, but they WERE. And I'm a fry snob so that's really saying something.Finally, we ordered the three filled donut holes both before the meal, and after for dessert! The salted-caramel vanilla cream was very tasty and you definitely got all of those flavors. Nutella was nutella (shrug).

"Colonie is spectacular in everyway - service, food, decor.  It is one of the best run restaurants in Brooklyn.  I've been here numerous times for brunch and dinner, and have sat at the bar by the chef's station.  Watching the chefs, servers, runners, callers and hosts run like clockwork is a testament to Brad McDonald and the owners.For brunch, I've had the pancake, duck hash, burger, monkey bread, eggs benedict - but not all in one sitting.  The pancake is literally a cake in a pan - thick and doughy and buttery.  Duck hash is probably very bad for you, but seriously unbelievable delish.  Monkey bread is freshly baked with a sticky sugary coating on top.  Burger is spectacular.  For dinner, all of the mains are perfectly executed.  The scallops are cooked to a T with microgreens and peas and carrots, really some of the best I've had.  Pork chop and Steak are meaty and seasoned well.  Butter lettuce is so simple yet revelatory.  All the crostinis are toasted and topped with various goodness.Ugh, I really can't say enough about this place.  Never change Colonie.",5.0

"Along with Traif, I think Colonie has been one of my top meals in NYC.I was with one friend around 7:45 on a Friday night with no reservation (do they even take them?) and we were greeted by an extremely friendly hostess who told us there was a wait of about 45 minutes. She took down my number and my friend and I went two doors down to Floyd (go here! beers and cozy couches. perfect place to wait for dinner). The hostess from Colonie called my cell at 8:30 and we went back and we were seated at the bar that overlooks the kitchen. I was disappointed to be sitting at the bar at first, but actually overlooking the kitchen was sweet! Really fun to watch the chefs and prep cooks do their thing.My friend and I were in the mood to try a lot, so we ended up ordering three apps and two entrees, all to share.The egg salad crostini was pretty mind-blowing. I think it was because of the smoked marrow and veal jus that was somehow perfectly incorporated into the egg salad. These unique flavors infused the dish so well. The duck egg, hen-of-the-woods mushrooms, and farro was SO YUM. First of all, this was not just a fried duck egg. It was like, DEEP fried. But somehow sunny-side up. The mushrooms and farro were rich and complex. Another epic win.The Brussels sprouts were perfectly fried and accompanied by cranberries (yum) and large chunks of bacon (should be yum, but they were oddly a little bit lacking in flavor). I think the bacon issue might have been from braising the bacon with the brussels sprouts, post-frying... could this have zapped all the flavor out of the bacon? Anyway, I'm nitpicking here. Fried brussels sprouts are awesome and I was happy.My only qualm was more an issue of our ordering choices- both the egg salad crostini and the duck egg dish were really rich, I think our third app should have been a salad instead of the fried brussels sprouts, particularly because our two entrees were rich as well. They have some really cool looking salads on the menu and I'd probably do this next time.Entrees:-Scallops with apricot, curry, pickled eggplant, pine nuts. W-O-W. The components I just listed should probably speak for themselves as far as how awesome it was. Perfectly seared, very large, texturally INCREDIBLE sea scallops. Can't recommend this enough.-Hanger steak with fries, roasted garlic aioli, baby greens... The fries were incredible, thin and salty and crisp, and the roasted garlic aioli was addictive. The hanger steak was absolutely delicious. Here's the thing though- Colonie just does such wonderful inventive things with flavors, I don't think I would necessarily order a steak here again. Not because it's not awesome- the steak WAS awesome. But I think you can order something more unique. But my friend was in a steaky mood (happens to the best of us right?) and it was certainly wonderful. (I was vying for the pork chop or the bass as our second entree and I can't wait to come back and try those).Everyone was super friendly, our waiter was great, and everyone in the kitchen who we were watching from our perch at the bar was smiley despite being super swamped with orders.It's gorgeous inside, with a wall of plants (dare I say these are herbs they use in the food?

"I am not usually a five star on the first time type of reviewer, but Colonie deserves it. Not only is the food delicious - I really enjoyed the shrimp and grits, which was comforting, exciting, and light all at once - but the service is great. We ordered a bread basket, but the bartender forgot to put the order in. We decided not to get it at that point since we were powering down our entrees. But they brought out a free one after we finished, just to say thanks and sorry for messing it up. That is just a cool thing to do. And I must say I highly recommend ordering this. The scone was insane. I also just love the whole vibe of the place - casual, fun, yet with awesome food. Can't wait to go back.",5.0

"I waited to try this place a few times before reviewing. I live really close to Colonie and I want to love this place, but I feel like the food is inconsistent. The first time I went, my husband and I shared a few things and overall were really disappointed. We shared a pork belly dish which was all fat (I don't think that this is on the menu anymore), a meat & cheese plate which was delicious and had a good mix of flavors and a fish dish which was not memorable. We also both got a stomach ache later that night after dinner which kept us from going back for a while. Their menu changes constantly so when I've visited again, I've had better experiences. I went for brunch and had the duck hash which was tasty and went for dinner once more and tried the soft shell crab special which was good. The service here is always great and I love the interior especially the little area that they call the garden, which is a bar counter that has a wall of plants that goes to the ceiling.",3.0
"Not an A, just OK. First time my man and I went there, we ordered a few plates to share, thinking they were small enough to do so. All the plates -about six, came out at once and were plonked on our table, filling it completely. Totally inappropriate and almost crude. My husband didn't feel completely inundated as I did. All the waiter had to do, was to take note that we had plenty of food to keep us occupied and quite happy for a while, and then maybe bring the rest later. No such luck. The food has the potential to be amazing. A couple of small changes could make the world of difference. Less seasoning - ie, we had an octopus dish that was ridiculously salty. Also EVERYTHING was unusually rich. It was almost as if the ingredients weren't given a chance to stand up for themselves -like everything was just anointed with too much oil, or...? For example, we went a month or so later for a 2nd try. This time we just ordered an entree each.

"A fabulous dinner in a gorgeous restaurant!We walked in around 7, had to wait for our table for 4, so we stood at the bar and ordered a round of drinks. I got the Full Sail lager ($6), a light, decent beer. Looking around I noticed the exposed brick walls paired with wooden floors and wooden white-washed cabinets, all lit with millions of candles. And then the living wall. What a place! After being seated I realized they had an open kitchen, and had used a mirror to make the restaurant seem more open (and it definitely helped).We finally got seated and ordered up a feast. Of that, I tried the following:-raw oysters with cucumber mignonette (a zesty salsa)-ricotta crustini with honey and mint leaves-wild mushroom crustini with chives and Parmesan-fried brussel sprouts with bacon and cranberries-skirt steak with chili aioli, fries and braised winter greensThe oysters: first time I've ever had oysters, and I figured this was the geographical area to start my adventures. I would recommend this dish to anyone who loves oysters and to anyone who hasn't had them before. Not fishy at all, and pleasantly fresh.The ricotta crustini: just get it, you'll love it.The brussel sprouts: it was a night of trying things, and so this was also the first time I've had brussel sprouts. Interesting taste, made wonderful with the bitter cranberries and rich bacon.The steak: the waitress said it was recommended that it be cooked medium rare, but I got it medium. I still thought it was a little undercooked, but it was still good, and the aioli was a great addition.Expensive, gorgeous, delicious and worth it.",5.0
If I lived closer to here I would come here more often! I came here for brunch with a couple of friends and ordered the Shrimp and [heirloom] Grits. I must say. Full of flavor and aaaaamazing. I was hesitant in ordering because I've never had heirloom grits before but I was really glad I did! They were bigger in size and if I remember correctly doughy in texture. The shrimp fresh and very well made. My other friends got the Duck Hash and Asparagus & Gruyere Scramble both amazing as well each with its own unique amazing seasoning and flavor.I love the atmosphere of the restaurant. The open kitchen was very nice and clean. The entire wait staff was very inviting & courteous. To boot the guys were cute! (what can I say I'm single right now). We noticed that the back end is very fitting for a large party (making note that it will be good for one of our birthday's coming up). I think this restaurant would also have a great night ambiance maybe for romantic dinner or date with girlfriends. Yum.,5.0
"My friend and I ate here after she was rewarded a chef's tasting for two for contributing to ""Start Up"" a few months back to help with the opening.We made reservations and were seated within 15 minutes of arrival.

"I am not usually a five star on the first time type of reviewer, but Colonie deserves it. Not only is the food delicious - I really enjoyed the shrimp and grits, which was comforting, exciting, and light all at once - but the service is great. We ordered a bread basket, but the bartender forgot to put the order in. We decided not to get it at that point since we were powering down our entrees. But they brought out a free one after we finished, just to say thanks and sorry for messing it up. That is just a cool thing to do. And I must say I highly recommend ordering this. The scone was insane. I also just love the whole vibe of the place - casual, fun, yet with awesome food. Can't wait to go back.",5.0
"Oh man what a place - try a bit of everything (or as much as you can afford). Great vibe, great service, GREAT food.",5.0
"I waited to try this place a few times before reviewing. I live really close to Colonie and I want to love this place, but I feel like the food is inconsistent. The first time I went, my husband and I shared a few things and overall were really disappointed. We shared a pork belly dish which was all fat (I don't think that this is on the menu anymore), a meat & cheese plate which was delicious and had a good mix of flavors and a fish dish which was not memorable. We also both got a stomach ache later that night after dinner which kept us from going back for a while. Their menu changes constantly so when I've visited again, I've had better experiences. I went for brunch and had the duck hash which was tasty and went for dinner once more and tried the soft shell crab special which was good. The service here is always great and I love the interior especially the little area that they call the garden, which is a bar counter that has a wall of plants that goes to the ceiling.",3.0
"Not an A, just OK. First time my man and I went there, we ordered a few plates to share, thinking they were small enough to do so. All the plates -about six, came out at once and were plonked on our table, filling it completely. Totally inappropriate and almost crude. My husband didn't feel completely inundated as I did. All the waiter had to do, was to take note that we had plenty of food to keep us occupied and quite happy for a while, and then maybe bring the rest later. No such luck. The food has the potential to be amazing. A couple of small changes could make the world of difference. Less seasoning - ie, we had an octopus dish that was ridiculously salty. Also EVERYTHING was unusually rich. It was almost as if the ingredients weren't given a chance to stand up for themselves -like everything was just anointed with too much oil, or...? For example, we went a month or so later for a 2nd try. This time we just ordered an entree each. I had the scallops which had beautiful flavours accompanying them but they too were just unnecessarily rich and again, way too salty.",3.0

"My latest restaurant adventure was Colonie, for dinner. Having been there for a lovely brunch back in October, I arrived with expectations high as an elephant's eye. The dinner fell a wee bit short of that though. But I digress. Let's start with the brunch I vaguely recall.I and three friends ordered the bakery baskets. Amazing pastry, corn muffins, and little cakes so adorable my teeth hurt for weeks after. Definitely try everything with the sweet cream butter. I was channeling Paula Deen that day; I think I spread it on my finger while waiting for the main course. The bite wounds are just healing, thanks for asking.The meal itself was also very scrumptious. I ordered the biscuit benedict. After deciding the mimosas weren't sparkly enough (2 parts simply orange, 1 part Andre I'm guessing), I switched to their amazingly refreshing version of a Pimm's Cup; I downed 2 or 3. The cucumber stick really ties the flavour profile together.I left Colonie fat and happy, unlike my wallet. All (or most?) of their stuff is local, organic, and all that crap that hippies ask about; understandably, eating better drives the cost up. I will say though that there are items for less elsewhere, which taste just as yummy, and that are equally as grass fed and cage free. Now, then, we come to dinner. We were seated straight away, though much to my chagrin closely sandwiched between two other tables; still, having been in New York for this long, I am grown accustomed to it, and quickly forgot about the leopard-clad eurotrash girl's elbow jabbing me in my love handles. Our waitress. Dear god. I am sure she is a lovely person, but I am not clear why it took her 20 minutes to realise she had a pair of thirsty (and hungry!) customers to help. I guess she was too busy plaiting her hair intro dreadlocks and ordering every shirt from Etsy.com. We got our drinks (I went for the Pimm's again, it came in a lesser amount than for brunch, boo.) and then it was time to assuage the hunger gremlin in my stomach. The she-leopard next to me had settled into her meal of cage-free, hand-raised, mozart-playing, shakespeare-reciting chicken and ceased her emphatic gesturing so I could enjoy my steak frites. Medium rare, of course. The steak was slightly over salted, and the frites too. But the sauce was good and the portion of steak was sensible. Not the tenderest cut of meat though; I expect more from a cow that wiles the day away languishing on purple velvet divans on 40 acres of birch woods in upstate wherever. But still good! We splurged and ordered the donuts with the curded caramel filling; I followed my donuts with a nice Tokaj. Great way to finish a meal, in my opinion. Funny enough, the clearing of the table and bringing of the check were as speedy as anyone could hope for, and our waitress, forgetting any social grace, retrieved and open the signed check to see her tip while standing a mere stone's throw from the table. I had to chuckle.Overall, Colonie is a good place to eat. The layout is interesting, the decor (replete with barnwood and a ""living wall"") is charming, and the food is generally tasty. I had to knock it down a couple pegs for the price and the waitress, but I don't think it would take a whole lot of convincing to get me back there. I think I'd stick to the brunch though; I'm more easily plied with promises of butter and a pimm's cup the size of my head.",3.0

Generally unattentive and slow.My last brunch there was the worst. The server either forgot to put our order in or just let someone else grab our food.  Either way, we sat there for 30 mintues without seeing our server and without food.  The chefs knew it, the expediter had to know it as he was only 5 feet from us, but no one took the time to care.  None of the other servers bothered to ask if we needed anything.  Awful.Once the server realized her mistake she offered a forced ""sorry"" and no explanation.I'm sure it is a perfectly adequate experience for people who are lucky enough not be neglected but I'm certainly not going out of my way to give this place another shot.  It's just not worth it.",1.0

"My boyfriend and I finally tried this spot on Saturday night. We weren't sure whether or not reservations would be required but we figured after the snowstorm it would be ok. Big mistake. Even with the bad weather the wait was over an hour for a table although there were probably 6 spots open at the bar. Luckily we were able to snag seats and sit down for our meal.There was kinda a mix of a setting and a jerky guy that was sitting next to me at the bar who was on a ""I'm on a date and gonna talk about what hot shit I am"" type of vibe. He rubbed me the wrong way - but that's not the restaurants fault, its just unfortunate it drew that kind of crowd to an otherwise chilled out neighborhood.We started off with the 3 cheese plate and an order of meat. Delicious and good portions.Next we got the grilled endive salad, fluke entree, brussel sprouts veggies, spaghetti squash.Salad and squash were all good but nothing that blew my socks off. Honestly, the presentation was more impressive than the taste. The Fluke entree with kale was tasty but again - didnt blow my socks off, specifically for $25 and the fish portion was quite small.Now to the brussel sprouts. Albeit - its my fault that i didn't read that they were fried, but still, no big deal. I love brussel sprouts anyway its served. What they failed to detail was these brussel sprouts were FRIED TO DEATH. like death. death death. like so burnt and fried that it ruins your palette for anything else. even 3 hours after my meal all i could taste was the bitter burnt taste. which is such a shame because i didn't even get the brussel sprouts flavor.  i'm definitely not one to ever complain at a restaurant or send food back but i wish my boyfriend hadn't eaten so many because i really would have sent it back. To end on a good note, their cocktails were AMAZINGGG. i tried the Blaire's Pear which was tart and sweet and delicious. Not huge for the price and I gulped down the whole thing pretty quick. I also tried the Cucumber cocktail which was sooo good. Tons of other people were drinking it so i figured it had to be good. It was.My recommendation - skip the overpriced food and come for cheese, cured meats and delicious cocktails. You'll be more than happy and won't have a $150 bill for two at the end of the night.",3.0

Have been here when the bartenders are friendly and helpful, other times, not so much. The bartender yesterday was on the chilly side, and we ate at the bar. My boyfriend had the pate - we've had it a few times and know it usually comes with some great bread. Not this time. When we asked for some, she just seemed hassled.

"The brunch is not nearly good enough to justify how bad the service is.First, sitting in front of the kitchen isn't that bad.  It's only awkward for a second.  Second, it gets crowded but I've never felt squeezed.However the servers I've delt with are absolutely terrible. Generally unattentive and slow.My last brunch there was the worst. The server either forgot to put our order in or just let someone else grab our food.  Either way, we sat there for 30 mintues without seeing our server and without food.  The chefs knew it, the expediter had to know it as he was only 5 feet from us, but no one took the time to care.  None of the other servers bothered to ask if we needed anything.  Awful.Once the server realized her mistake she offered a forced ""sorry"" and no explanation.I'm sure it is a perfectly adequate experience for people who are lucky enough not be neglected but I'm certainly not going out of my way to give this place another shot.  It's just not worth it.",1.0
"Nice decor. Attentive service. Menu was not very inspired and executed poorly (lots of salt). The pricing seems way off with veggie sides - that are simply just vegetables - costing more than some mains. Both steaks ordered at our table were not cooked properly and sent back. With all the amazing restaurants in the area, I won't return to Colonie.",2.0
"I had an amazing dinner at Colonie. Reminded me of the grand bistrots parisiens. The food was great, from beginning to end. The setting is very nice. Open kitchen, which is always a good sign. I was lucky not to have to wait as it was during the week. I HAVE TO GO BACK FOR BRUNCH.",5.0
"My boyfriend and I finally tried this spot on Saturday night. We weren't sure whether or not reservations would be required but we figured after the snowstorm it would be ok. Big mistake. Even with the bad weather the wait was over an hour for a table although there were probably 6 spots open at the bar. Luckily we were able to snag seats and sit down for our meal.There was kinda a mix of a setting and a jerky guy that was sitting next to me at the bar who was on a ""I'm on a date and gonna talk about what hot shit I am"" type of vibe. He rubbed me the wrong way - but that's not the restaurants fault, its just unfortunate it drew that kind of crowd to an otherwise chilled out neighborhood.We started off with the 3 cheese plate and an order of meat. Delicious and good portions.Next we got the grilled endive salad, fluke entree, brussel sprouts veggies, spaghetti squash.Salad and squash were all good but nothing that blew my socks off. Honestly, the presentation was more impressive than the taste. The Fluke entree with kale was tasty but again - didnt blow my socks off, specifically for $25 and the fish portion was quite small.Now to the brussel sprouts. Albeit - its my fault that i didn't read that they were fried, but still, no big deal. I love brussel sprouts anyway its served. What they failed to detail was these brussel sprouts were FRIED TO DEATH. like death. death death. like so burnt and fried that it ruins your palette for anything else. even 3 hours after my meal all i could taste was the bitter burnt taste. which is such a shame because i didn't even get the brussel sprouts flavor.  i'm definitely not one to ever complain at a restaurant or send food back but i wish my boyfriend hadn't eaten so many because i really would have sent it back. To end on a good note, their cocktails were AMAZINGGG. i tried the Blaire's Pear which was tart and sweet and delicious. Not huge for the price and I gulped down the whole thing pretty quick. I also tried the Cucumber cocktail which was sooo good. Tons of other people were drinking it so i figured it had to be good. It was.My recommendation - skip the overpriced food and come for cheese, cured meats and delicious cocktails. You'll be more than happy and won't have a $150 bill for two at the end of the night.",3.0

"Some of the food is quite good, some eh. Duck Rillette - delish. Pate seems to be not as good as it was, brussel sprouts - excellent. Prosciutto - gross. Came kind of minced up and thick.

Have been here when the bartenders are friendly and helpful, other times, not so much. The bartender yesterday was on the chilly side, and we ate at the bar. My boyfriend had the pate - we've had it a few times and know it usually comes with some great bread. Not this time. When we asked for some, she just seemed hassled.

The cocktails list was small, each drink highlighting a different refreshing component, yet not pretentious in the least. I enjoyed the Cool Hand Cuke. It was a little on the bitter side, but it was so crisp, chilled, and beautifully garnished, I scarcely find it prudent to mention this slight criticism. Upon being seated in the rear of the restaurant, our waitress approached. She had great recommendations but never an overzealous upsale. She suggested an amazing Rose, and I think Roses are tough. I like very few, but she hit the nail on the head with this one. She offered each of us some suggestion or slight alteration to what we ordered, and each was satisfied with the end result. Two of my dining companions ordered the hanger steak and neither left a bite to share. The other had a chicken dish, and she gave it a full endorsement calling it ""not too chickeny"", tender, gently seasoned, and well complemented by its delicate sauce and side vegetables. I ordered the ricotta, honey crostini with basil; a small cheese plate with watermelon preserves, blueberries, and crisp poppyseed crackers; and an AMAZING corn dish. Prior to Saturday night, I had not met a hushpuppy in NYC that even approached ""good"" or even worthy of the name. The two I was served at Colonie, surrounded by cheesy creamed corn, were different than any hush puppy that has ever passed my lips, but I can't imagine one that could be any better.

She seemed to know exactly when we needed her, yet she did not hover. It's a difficult balance to strike, especially with the house busting at the seams.

"I came to Colonie for a lingering Saturday brunch. From the second I stepped foot in the door, I knew I would love it. The interior is well done; a Brooklyn standard of white and wood with antique metal accents, completed by a central wall of green foliage. It was a beautiful haven from the outdoor elements.The coffee was served in individual french-preses which we all know makes us squeal with delight (even if some of you complain about practicality). Needless to say; this made for some excellent coffee. The bloody mary's were the perfect Saturday afternoon combination of strong liquor and not-so-spicy-that-I'm-going-to-regret-my-Friday-evening-ventures tomato; a palatable drink that I feel I'm left craving. The oysters were monstrous and delicious (I can't remember where these hailed from), and the meal amazing as well. I stuck to the basics and ordered the leek and gruyere scramble and I have to say the eggs were done very well; cooked just enough to remain a bit soft, but not in the least bit watery.From the hostess to the wait-staff; everyone was attentive without being pushy and very very kind. Not too shabby on the eyes, either.",5.0
"For all the hype this place just didn't do it for me. The atmosphere is great and the service equally good, but there is something really lacking in the food. The only menu item I enjoyed was something I didn't even order, a friend shared her Ricotta Crostini with me (thankfully), and it was delicious. The rest of the meal (all 4 of our entrees) were bland 1 was even overcooked (a steak that was well done that was ordered medium). Finally, the part of the meal I looked most forward to, dessert, was a complete letdown. Their dessert list on paper sounds amazing. I had the foie gras cherry glazed donuts. They were hardly edible. It tasted like someone had heated up smuckers cherry jelly and had poured it over dunkin donut cake donuts. Yuck. I won't be returning here.",2.0

(5) We ended our meal with a slice of chocolate cake, which was good but nothing out of this world. I'd definitely try a different dessert.I cannot wait to go back to Colonie. The staff is friendly, the menu is original and the food is extremely well-prepared.",5.0
Love love love this place! Been here numerous times for brunch and dinner and each experience has been better than the one before. The food is really yummy and innovative and overdelivers compared to what you would expect just from reading the description on the menu - the Duck Hash for brunch and Rabbit & Foie Gras Terrine are all time favorites. The cocktails are always amazing - I'm personally a huge fan of Cool Hand Cuke. The ambience is nice and the decor is lovely. Sitting at the open kitchen and watching the chefs cook and prepare food really adds to the experience. The wine selection is nice and adequate but could be more extensive. My only wish is that they would start taking reservations...,5.0
"I love this place.  The pacing can sometimes be off but the food is well worth the wait.  Our favorite dishes: Ricotta Crostini, Summer Squash soup, Ricotta Gnudi, the Crab and Avocado app, Duck Breast entree, Scallops -- all amazing!One bit of advice: While the chef counter is truly my favorite place to sit, it can be UNBEARABLY hot during the summer months.  (I feel bad for the guys behind the counter - I can't imagine how much worst the heat is in there.)  Stick to eating at the upfront bar if you are looking for that kind of experience.",4.0
"Consistency is not one of this restaurant's strengths. I went back about three weeks later with a group of friends, and ordered almost the exact same meal. The kohlrabi salad was very watery this time and very bland. My steak was over done and the fries weren't edible because of all the salt that was poured on them. The server wasn't attentive and didn't seem all that thrilled to be there, but the cocktails were still great and strong!",2.0
"Pretty cool place. Very Brooklyn Heights! Noisy, industrial elegant, alive. I had the hanger steak and they cooked it just right. This can be a tough cut of meat to prepare correctly. Cook it just a little too long and it is very tough to eat. Do it right and it is a delight to eat. It's also called the ""butchers' cut"" because it is the section that the butcher shop owner would take home to his family because it was so go.",4.0
"I came to Colonie for a lingering Saturday brunch. From the second I stepped foot in the door, I knew I would love it. The interior is well done; a Brooklyn standard of white and wood with antique metal accents, completed by a central wall of green foliage. It was a beautiful haven from the outdoor elements.The coffee was served in individual french-preses which we all know makes us squeal with delight (even if some of you complain about practicality). Needless to say; this made for some excellent coffee. The bloody mary's were the perfect Saturday afternoon combination of strong liquor and not-so-spicy-that-I'm-going-to-regret-my-Friday-evening-ventures tomato; a palatable drink that I feel I'm left craving. The oysters were monstrous and delicious (I can't remember where these hailed from), and the meal amazing as well. I stuck to the basics and ordered the leek and gruyere scramble and I have to say the eggs were done very well; cooked just enough to remain a bit soft, but not in the least bit watery.From the hostess to the wait-staff; everyone was attentive without being pushy and very very kind. Not too shabby on the eyes, either.",5.0
"For all the hype this place just didn't do it for me. The atmosphere is great and the service equally good, but there is something really lacking in the food. The only menu item I enjoyed was something I didn't even order, a friend shared her Ricotta Crostini with me (thankfully), and it was delicious. The rest of the meal (all 4 of our entrees) were bland 1 was even overcooked (a steak that was well done that was ordered medium). Finally, the part of the meal I looked most forward to, dessert, was a complete letdown. Their dessert list on paper sounds amazing. I had the foie gras cherry glazed donuts. They were hardly edible. It tasted like someone had heated up smuckers cherry jelly and had poured it over dunkin donut cake donuts. Yuck. I won't be returning here.",2.0
"Simply put... outstanding. This review is based on the brunch we recently had here which was our first dining experience at the restaurant. The brunch easily rivals Buttermilk Channel for best in the neighborhood. I recommend the shrimp and grits, sausage, and eggs with gruyere and leeks but I'm not sure you can go wrong with anything on the brunch menu. Looking forward to a dinner here in the near future.",4.0
"Came here for a lovely friend's birthday brunch on Sunday and had a great time.  It took a while for our table to be ready, but once we were seated, we had such a nice time.  The open kitchen full of beaded chefs was certainly a plus! :) I had the duck hash - - - after a few weeks of eschewing carbs, it was worth cheating on my diet!  And not-huge portions made it feel like a special meal, not a hangover-greasy-spoon  joint.  My friends raved about the shrimp & grits (and egg!).  The date cake?  Awesome.  The donuts?  Awesomer.  Seriously, I was still thinking about them later in the day.Overall, great atmosphere, great vibe, very sweet server.",4.0
"The food was decent. The place seemed like it would be cool except that the (good) music was loud, so everyone was yelling over it - though it was 10 on an Friday, so people getting loose is not really surprising. The steak was good, but there was a philosophical disagreement about the fries: they were so skinny as to be basically potato chips, which I liked, but my wife (who ordered them) was less enamored. I had decent but not spectacular octopus and a frankly unmemorable salad. The duck rillette crostini was solid. What really put me off, though, was that one of our party clearly ordered a salad and an appetizer, with one to be brought with the main courses. Instead, they both materialized with the apps, leaving him the undesirable options of either husbanding his (warm) food and eating extra-slowly, or finishing his meal long before anyone else. We had been very clear with the server, yet when I said, ""oh, you've brought both [redacted]'s courses at once"" there was not a flicker of understanding in this person's eyes. This typified the staff's overall attitude, and our particular server was uninformed about their wine list as well, having to ask another server to answer our questions.",2.0
"I was really excited to try this place out but...The food was expensive and mediocre. Steak with fries under their ""Large"" category for $24 (!!) was appetizer size. In fact it was less food than my ""Small"" category dish of Black Risotto, which although many rave about was flavorful but way too al dente for my taste. I've never had Pork Belly which is served as ALL fat...maybe that is their style to serve it with no layer of meat or I got a bad batch but it did NOT taste good. My friends had the Foie Gras Doughnuts which they said was unexpectedly flavorless.Also, we waited for a table of 5 about 1 1/2 hours while at least 6 tables of two got seated. I think the front-of-the-house needs a better system so the wait time isn't so high and low. THEN they end up squishing us into a table meant for 4 so 3 of us were benched on one side, elbow to elbow with other tables!Its getting 2 stars for the wait staff being pleasant and the atmosphere and decor being well designed and comfortable.

"Let me preface this by saying my experience was colored by the service and treatment we received and not by the food nor decor. Also, one bad apple does not spoil the apple cart - I realize that, and you should to. We arrived (party of 3) at 8:15 on a Saturday - we expected a wait, and there was one, of approximately 1.5 hours. The host kindly indicated that we should most likely just wait for bar seating to open as it did regularly - ""they're first come, first served"" he crowed! We waited, and waited, and waited... when finally a seat opened, the patron was escorted to her table (I watched this happen) and we approached the bar's now empty seat. The bartender with the endearing Australian accent and curly golden locks promptly plopped a reserved sign down and said, ""sorry mate, the seat's still taken - she's just gone to the loo."" I protested mildly and he insisted, so we waited some more. During this time we confirmed with two more staff that the bar was indeed, ""never reserved, always first come, first served!"" 20 minutes later two more seats opened at the bar - right next to the one that remained vacant - and we were eager to eat and sit. When we approached the bar - BOOM! - down come two more reserved signs! I honestly thought the bartender was kidding, but no, he now happily admitted that he was saving all three stools for his friends that were coming by in a little while. When I calmly pointed out that not only had he lied about the first seat, but we'd been told by multiple staff that the bar was first come, first served and that we'd been waiting for over an hour, he shrugged and said ""sorry, mate."" I understand wanting to show your new place of employ off to friends as much as the next guy, but this is your job and the place is new - should you really be driving paying customers out, so you can hand free drinks out to your friends?!? I can't imagine management would be happy with that.  I am as disappointed by the treatment as I am by not having been able to taste the food, but honestly if we'd stuck around everything would have been just a little too bitter that night.

"This is a great restaurant.  I stopped in after a busy week and ate at the communal table that is seated around the kitchen.  I had the heirloom tomatoes with feta to start which were full of flavor (no sea salt from the tiny dishes near by needed) and then I had the striped bass which was cooked perfectly.  I learned from the chef that all of the food is sourced locally. I know that's not a new ""thing"" these days, but it was impressive to hear how much went into actually operating a restaurant with locally sourced food.   The portions are not huge, so I definitely had room for dessert.  I tried a couple of their donuts with a salted caramel creme on top.   They were, quite honestly, pieces of heaven!   As I had a great view of the cooking and food preparation in their (only) kitchen, I was able to see everything being made.  Everything looked delicious.  Next on my list are the scallops, quail egg small plate and steak.  The head chef runs a great kitchen, everyone was working in unison, had great nature about them and seemed to be enjoying themselves.  It's so nice to have a place like this in Brooklyn.  I'm definitely becoming a local!",5.0
"Hubby and I stumbled into Colonie hot, sweaty, and starving on a Friday night after other dinner plans fell through. We had no idea what the wait might by (I don't think they take reservations). I think the hostess could see the desperation on our faces and we were seated immediately at the very back table (which was actually awesome b/c there is a lot of separation so it feels like a very private table). Our waiter could not have been nicer and more helpful with all of our questions. We had the meat plate, several drinks, scallops, striped bass, and brussel sprouts. Everything was delicious and well worth the price. The decor is so lovely. Don't miss this great spot in Brooklyn!",4.0
"I was really excited to say the least when i headed to Colonie with a group of six for sunday brunch. The place is very cute,modern and i liked that they had an open kitchen where you can see all the food being prepared. Our group decided to order the ""basket"" of assorted donuts which turned out to be four very,very tiny donuts that were ok but certainly not worth the $8 price tag. As we were ordering our dishes,our server proceeded to tell us about their special burger which was to be served Medium and topped with an egg and ""because of limited quantity there would be no substitutions allowed"". Now the burger sounded great to me and so i asked our server if i can order it but to leave out the egg(not a fan of eggs) and he said that the burger would not be served otherwise. Clearly,i was not asking for substitutions but for me to order the $18 burger sans the eggs! Anyway,i went ahead and ordered it and handed over the egg to a friend. The burger was again ok and definitely served Rare! As we were heading out,one of my friends who was a bit stunned at the burger situation insisted on letting the manager know that we were not happy to be denied such a simple request on my part. The manager went on to defend the reason why the burger would not be served without the egg(because the chef believed the burger would not taste the same without the egg). Really? Its a burger. Needless to say,will not be returning.",1.0

"Went here after a full day of Biking and dancing in 1920s fashion around Governor's Island. We were in the mood for comfort food, and was thinking of biking over to Smith street, but... Too tired! We decided to walk into this inviting place on Atlantic Ave, and sat at the Bar. The Menu wasn't too big, but focused. Started off with Cranberry bean Crostini and.. OH! Egg with SMOKED Bone MARROW.. You knows I gots to get that! Believe me,.. It's as good as it sounds, and the Crostinis are quite big! My Girl and I had Flying Dog Porter, and Six Point to wash it all down.. Both Brews excellent, and Both, made in NY. Woot! We continued to explore their menu, with adding on a Rabbit-Foie Gras Terrine, A Scallop Entree' and a Duck breast with lentils as well... The Terrine, is flawless! Rich, tender,smoooth... Plenty of meat to go around, and just amazing. As good as it gets. Simply came with Frisee' salad, that were crunchy and bitter. A bit much for my girlie, but I thought the bitterness played well with the dish. -""It's a perfect circle""-She whispers. How so?? She grabs the 'bush' of Frisee' and explains, ""THIS is what Wabbits eat, and now it's on the same plate"".. Oh, Asso.. Then, Professor obvious, what will Duckie eat then!?!?!.. She quietly dangles a perfect piece of toast. Well then, Everybody is happy.. Let's have another round of drinks! At this point, we were a wee bit tipsy, so I can't recall the other silly things we were discussing about but, oh- When the Scallops and the Duck arrived, we sobered up real quick! First, the Scallops. Seared perfectly- Sweet, and meaty, with Mushrooms, Apples and lemony herb.. Wow! So elegant, you'd think this dish was coming from a posh Michelin starred place, rather than from a Neighborhood joint in Brooklyn. Really nice, but There were only 4 Scallops, so I did not want to steal anymore from my Date. The Duck was Fa~ntastic as well, with perfectly rendered skin/VERY CRISP, and cooked Medium rare. The Lentils were buttery, and firm. The Sauce? Man, the Duck Sauce was just amazing! Deep flavor, and so silky- Looks like a sauce straight out of French laundry's cookbook. I wish I could bottle it up to take home for breakfast. YUM! Our plates were wiped clean in seconds. Our bartendress was quite amazed... We get that a lot, wherever we go LOL. I wish we had room for Dessert, but.. Not this time; We still have to ride back over the Bridge to get back to Manhattan! Well, Colonie definitely gave us enough 'fuel' for our journey back.. Next time, we're driving down here! Awesome!!!",4.0

"In the search for delicious food, I rarely venture off the island of Manhattan. And when I do, it's certainly not to Brooklyn Heights - a neighborhood typically considered more stale and historic than its other borough counterparts. Yet on my way to the NY Transit Museum, and at the strong recommendation of a friend, we ended up brunching at Colonie, a casual yet chic spot, complete with candles and its very own herb garden wall. And what a great meal it was!This farm-to-table restaurant offers only the freshest, highest-quality ingredients and handles them beautifully, ensuring each flavor and texture is enjoyed on its own, while still existing as part of a cohesive whole. Many of the preparations are straightforward with little razzle dazzle, but some are truly inspired. Unexpected offerings like the Mushroom Egg Toast and Duck Hash are successful, though the latter has less flavor than expected. While everything is tasty,  and the simpler options are more of a ""sure thing,"" it's the unique dishes that make the trip to Brooklyn Heights worthwhile.",4.0

I got it on the recommendation of a friend, and I would suggest you follow mine and every other yelpers lead here and save room for dessert.  It was holycrapomgomgomgdon'ttalktomeI'mhavingamoment good.  Is it taboo to go to a restaurant for a drink and dessert these days?  Because I'd consider that the perfect date.",4.0
"Hate to burst everyone's bubble, but don't believe the hype! As others have noted, this is a very beautiful restaurant -- the decor and the lighting and the general look and feel are pitch perfect. Unfortunately, everything else was a huge disappointment. I'll cut right to the chase: the food was pretty bad...and not at all inexpensive. We had a tough overcooked pork belly, an over-salted kale salad with a vague fishy flavor, another over-salted cauliflower dish with a nacho-tasting sauce (blech!), over-salted and limp fillet of trout (with chunks of chewy bacon !?) and a burnt chocolate bread pudding for desert. Pretty much a complete disaster other than our oysters on the half shell appetizer, which was good . . . Can't say that the drinks are that great either. I would perhaps recommend going here to have wine and cheese and cured meats (we didn't try the cheese or meats, but how badly can those get screwed up?) because it looks so nice . . .

The Terrine, is flawless! Rich, tender,smoooth... Plenty of meat to go around, and just amazing. As good as it gets. Simply came with Frisee' salad, that were crunchy and bitter. A bit much for my girlie, but I thought the bitterness played well with the dish. -""It's a perfect circle""-She whispers. How so?? She grabs the 'bush' of Frisee' and explains, ""THIS is what Wabbits eat, and now it's on the same plate"".. Oh, Asso.. Then, Professor obvious, what will Duckie eat then!?!?!.. She quietly dangles a perfect piece of toast. Well then, Everybody is happy.. Let's have another round of drinks! At this point, we were a wee bit tipsy, so I can't recall the other silly things we were discussing about but, oh- When the Scallops and the Duck arrived, we sobered up real quick! First, the Scallops. Seared perfectly- Sweet, and meaty, with Mushrooms, Apples and lemony herb.. Wow! So elegant, you'd think this dish was coming from a posh Michelin starred place, rather than from a Neighborhood joint in Brooklyn. Really nice, but There were only 4 Scallops, so I did not want to steal anymore from my Date. The Duck was Fa~ntastic as well, with perfectly rendered skin/VERY CRISP, and cooked Medium rare. The Lentils were buttery, and firm. The Sauce? Man, the Duck Sauce was just amazing! Deep flavor, and so silky- Looks like a sauce straight out of French laundry's cookbook. I wish I could bottle it up to take home for breakfast. YUM! Our plates were wiped clean in seconds. Our bartendress was quite amazed... We get that a lot, wherever we go LOL. I wish we had room for Dessert, but.. Not this time; We still have to ride back over the Bridge to get back to Manhattan! Well, Colonie definitely gave us enough 'fuel' for our journey back.. Next time, we're driving down here! Awesome!!!",4.0
Super pretentious and overpriced.  Our waitress was uptight and just not friendly.  The food was just alright and definitely not worth the money.  The people who like this place must be crazy or assholes.  Good luck.,1.0
"I need to preface this by saying that my first experience at Colonie didn't blow me away.  It certainly wasn't terrible, but I  was just expecting more, since most of my BK friends rave about the place.My boyfriend and I really fell in love with everything about Colonie on our 2nd visit.  We ordered a LOT.  The charcuterie is definitely an excellent deal, they really give you a lot.  We also got the burrata and heirloom tomato special which was really incredible too.  Our entrees were fantastic.  We got the scallops and the halibut- both cooked perfectly.  They have wine on tap as well, which I love.  Service was great.  I have nothing bad to say. Can't wait to try the 2 DUMBO restaurants!",5.0
"In the search for delicious food, I rarely venture off the island of Manhattan. And when I do, it's certainly not to Brooklyn Heights - a neighborhood typically considered more stale and historic than its other borough counterparts. Yet on my way to the NY Transit Museum, and at the strong recommendation of a friend, we ended up brunching at Colonie, a casual yet chic spot, complete with candles and its very own herb garden wall. And what a great meal it was!This farm-to-table restaurant offers only the freshest, highest-quality ingredients and handles them beautifully, ensuring each flavor and texture is enjoyed on its own, while still existing as part of a cohesive whole. Many of the preparations are straightforward with little razzle dazzle, but some are truly inspired. Unexpected offerings like the Mushroom Egg Toast and Duck Hash are successful, though the latter has less flavor than expected. While everything is tasty,  and the simpler options are more of a ""sure thing,"" it's the unique dishes that make the trip to Brooklyn Heights worthwhile.",4.0
"Loved the atmosphere, very warm and comfortable, cozy, yet well designed.  The waitress was nice, and the food was good.  I sort of had one of those moments where I looked at the menu and nothing was really screaming out to me, and to be honest it's a couple months later and I can't remember what I had - EXCEPT - the bread pudding!!!  Holy crap. I got it on the recommendation of a friend, and I would suggest you follow mine and every other yelpers lead here and save room for dessert.  It was holycrapomgomgomgdon'ttalktomeI'mhavingamoment good.  Is it taboo to go to a restaurant for a drink and dessert these days?  Because I'd consider that the perfect date.",4.0
"Hate to burst everyone's bubble, but don't believe the hype! As others have noted, this is a very beautiful restaurant -- the decor and the lighting and the general look and feel are pitch perfect. Unfortunately, everything else was a huge disappointment. I'll cut right to the chase: the food was pretty bad...and not at all inexpensive. We had a tough overcooked pork belly, an over-salted kale salad with a vague fishy flavor, another over-salted cauliflower dish with a nacho-tasting sauce (blech!), over-salted and limp fillet of trout (with chunks of chewy bacon !?) and a burnt chocolate bread pudding for desert. Pretty much a complete disaster other than our oysters on the half shell appetizer, which was good . . . Can't say that the drinks are that great either. I would perhaps recommend going here to have wine and cheese and cured meats (we didn't try the cheese or meats, but how badly can those get screwed up?) because it looks so nice . . . As for dinner: stay away.",2.0
"Let's start with the positive:  The sticky date cake with salted crème fraiche ice cream is life altering. Such deliciousness raised a two star review to a three star.And the review goes downhill from here.  The food at Colonie is rather disappointing, which is a shame because it's a physically beautiful restaurant.The Egg, which at $10 should be making one hear angels sing, is literally a single fried egg on a bed of plain spelt and plain beans with tiny mushrooms.  Remarkable in its mediocrity, and with each tiny bite a reminder that you just spent $10 on a $0.10 fried egg and have little to show for it.The Brussels sprouts, which are a staple at many New American restaurants--nothing special here, and the bacon pieces were overly fatty.The ricotta and honey crostini is good, but the same thing about a mile away at Frankies 457 has it beat.Perhaps most disappointing was the $22 tiny pork chop, where approximately 1/4 was fat or gristle, expectorated into my napkin.  I had the Bergamot Margarita; nothing special.Even though they've now been opened for several months, the service is still rusty.The food is hit or miss, and the price to value ratio at Colonie is poor, which means I won't be back, except perhaps for the sticky date cake to eat at the bar after dining at another local restaurant.",3.0
"Colonie can colonize all it would like, and I'm fortunate enough that it has built its pillars in my backyard - just about. The pleasure-to-please front of the house staff only foreshadowed the meticulously attentive wait service. From the moment our four-top sat to the time we left, our water glasses never made it past the half empty mark and our champagne glasses were always brim-full with our sparkling Lambrusco. Throughout the extensive meal our place settings were reset at least three times, which was whole-heartedly appreciated - the simple pleasure of eating off of a clean plate! It's these little nuances, the attention to detail that already set Colonie apart from the numerous establishments that tout good food, but rest all too comfortably on their laurels of hype and swank, dismissing the service aspect of the dining experience all together. Colonie tallied big brownie points to this end - and we haven't even gotten to the food yet! If you can have your cake and eat it too, then you have it all figured out. And Colonie was able to do that. The plates were on point. Most of what we ordered was per the recommendation of our knowledgeable server (paralelling what we were tending towards already), and those were the dishes that won us over for the most part. The oysters were a fail-safe start to the feast, fresh and made interesting with a vinegar-based cucumber mignonette sauce, beautifully balancing their essence of the sea. Keeping it light, we opted for fluffy ricotta crostini, their pillowy dunes drizzled with sweet honey and aromatic tears of fresh mint leaves. Downright decadence with every chewy morsel.Floating back to the ocean, the dainty octopus left much to be desired. One of the few missteps in our spread, the image shows a 'before' picture, though it scarily resembles an 'after.' A thin meager tentacle cut into three short pieces were thoughtlessly laid upon an uninteresting bed of mizuna greens, fennel and apple. Perhaps pulpo at its worst. If this is the intended execution, I recommend not recommending it. Similarly underwhleming, but relievingly the only other unremarkable dish, was the kale salad. Now I know kale is tough - literally, and as a consequence often figuratively. But sometimes a chef can master this harsh leaf and massage it into a delicate green. Such was not the case here, unfortunately. Tossed in an anchovy dressing with carrots and cherries, the flavors were unpronounced and the rough texture was hard to overlook, try as I might.But after surpassing these humps it was smooth sailing from there. A lifeboat came in the form of a flavor-forward heirloom beet salad. This rugged root provided a welcoming firm texture against the soft ricotta salata, and supple oranges, with a round finishing crunch from the crystalized hazelnuts. Staying the course of understated robust flavors, the black risotto topped with a web of crispy enoki mushrooms was delightfully smooth on the tongue but maintained a rich depth without the heavy weight risotto often brings.As if our palates could not be tickeled any further, more favorites were ushered out. A perfectly seared  meaty artichoke, laying in tender husky chunks atop a wonderfully acidic blood orange hollandaise sauce. Talk about the bold and the beautiful. And the layers of flavor persisted in a layered lasagna of rabbit, sundried tomatoes, and swiss chard. Yes, it is as good as it sounds. An ultimate comfort food revamped rabbit-style. What's not to love? Many would say Brussels sprouts. But love them or hate them, they are the new ""it"" vegetable, making fashionable appearances on every seasonal menu. And Colonie certainly delivers with theirs, satisfyingly crispy with savory bacon and sweet cranberries. A melt in your mouth experience that will certainly erase their fabled bad rap. Some of the best Brussels I've had - and I've been to Brussels.So exit the small plates, which carried a fine presence in our meal.  But we couldn't ""Colonize"" without testing the larger dishes as well. Enter the most substantial and succulent grilled scallops that have ever graced my palate. Then plop them on a  sweet kabocha squash puree dressed with pickled red cabbage and it's heaven on a plate. I wanted to bathe in these flavors and textures for eternity (but knew there would be some sort of sin involved if that were possible). Unyielding and bold, much like its large-plate companion, the roast pork was charred to a perfect crisp, the moist meat oozing supple juices. Served with grainy yet silky grits and heaping glazed root vegetables, it was a hearty dish all too appropriate for a medieval king's dinner. And royal we felt, as the dining experience could only be extended by nothing other than dessert. Colonie has all their ducks in a row and I am hopeful they will keep it this way in spite of their growing popularity - to which I realize I am contributing. I have no doubt I will become a regular. So let's just say, put it on my tab.",5.0

We had a great seat at the kitchen counter of the adorable chefs. We have a really wonderful server by the name of Genevieve.

I could do without the Aussie bartender.. he left us waiting for a bit to order. But everyone else from host to owner to chef was amazing.What an awesome dining experience.",5.0
"Dear ColonieAlthough you sometimes get too crowded and we decide not to wait, we still really like you.We like the cocktails although they are a little pricey (help a girl out-specials every once in a while?), and we can get the exact same beer a half block away for 2 bucks less. But your bartenders are really creative, and we drink their concoctions despite the price. We like sitting at the bar, or at the open kitchen counter, although seeing our $19 piece of octopus come from a plastic container sitting by the grill is a bit disconcerting. Especially when the said $19 piece of octopus is surrounded by so many friends, and yet ends up as a single piece on our plate. And then we end the evening still feeling happy and full, despite the fact that we've just paid a little more than we'd like for what amounts to farm-to-table-ish tapas. We keep coming back though, because even when we don't totally love every bite (the beet salad with cocoa was somewhere between strange and strangely tasty), there's enough there that's satisfying and awesome. So, I don't know. Wanna knock off a few bucks on some of your dishes? Or run some type of special? We're still going to come, but we'll feel a little less liking rolling our eyes at some of the prices.Thanks! Ps. All kidding aside..the crostinis are AMAZING. Get the duck. Or the fig, if you like fig. And then wonder why the fig comes on a piece of crostini the size of your face, while the duck crostini is itty bitty.",4.0

"Went for Brunch, actually got too much food, so I'm not sure which plates are the ""too small"" plates. I had the eggs benedict on a biscuit and my boyfriend had the duck hash. Both were delicious. I also got coffee, which I enjoyed out of a personal French press. It was a bit awkward when we first walked in, the hostess was a bit nonchalant and looked at us like we might be tourists and wasn't it cute that we wanted to eat there. (We actually live around the corner - maybe it was because I was carrying an umbrella..?) She asked if we wanted the ""kitchen counter"" or a table and, being confused by the ""kitchen counter"" situation I just said table. I was glad, because the folks sitting at the counter seemed to feel a bit awkward.This is one of those places where you end up sitting very close to the other patrons because the tables are close together in a small space, but I don't really mind that. It was a bit expensive, but we enjoyed the food, did not have any trouble with the music being loud (it seems like every Brooklyn restaurant has reviewers complaining about ""thumping"" music at all hours of the day...not sure what that is about!) and we really loved the decor - lots of greenery. We have considered going back for dinner a couple of times but the menu seems very limited and quite pricey.",3.0

"We've now had a few stellar meals at Colonie - it's become one of our go-to's in the neighborhood when we're looking for a nicer meal.  The food is delicious, the service gracious, and atmosphere perfect whether you're celebrating something or just looking for a nice dinner.Most recently, I can't say enough good things about the fig crostini or the donuts for dessert.  I've been pregnant the last few times, so while I've had to eye the cocktail list longingly, my husband reports that his samples have been tasty, and the wine list quite good.  I've enjoyed that they leave a water bottle on the table...What I love most about Colonie, though, is sitting at the bar in the back.  Sure, you're a little cozy with your neighbors, but watching the ballet that is the kitchen preparing meals is a ton of fun.  Seeing all those plates just made me want to try everything... We'll certainly be back.",5.0

"Came here Thursday at 8:45pm with a friend and was told there would be a 45 minute wait.  We walk maybe 7 minutes down the road, and they call saying there's seat at the kitchen.  It was a bit hot there, but it was fun figuring out who was on garnish, expediting, etc.  We got the sweet corn over polenta with lime and hush puppies.  It needed a bit of heat, but it was flavorful.  The hush puppies got a little soggy, but they were authentic.  The ricotta gnudi were pillows of heaven with what is the first time I have ever tolerated olives and sweet tomatoes.

"Went for Brunch, actually got too much food, so I'm not sure which plates are the ""too small"" plates. I had the eggs benedict on a biscuit and my boyfriend had the duck hash. Both were delicious. I also got coffee, which I enjoyed out of a personal French press. It was a bit awkward when we first walked in, the hostess was a bit nonchalant and looked at us like we might be tourists and wasn't it cute that we wanted to eat there. (We actually live around the corner - maybe it was because I was carrying an umbrella..?) She asked if we wanted the ""kitchen counter"" or a table and, being confused by the ""kitchen counter"" situation I just said table. I was glad, because the folks sitting at the counter seemed to feel a bit awkward.This is one of those places where you end up sitting very close to the other patrons because the tables are close together in a small space, but I don't really mind that. It was a bit expensive, but we enjoyed the food, did not have any trouble with the music being loud (it seems like every Brooklyn restaurant has reviewers complaining about ""thumping"" music at all hours of the day...not sure what that is about!) and we really loved the decor - lots of greenery. We have considered going back for dinner a couple of times but the menu seems very limited and quite pricey.",3.0
"Went here for a celebratory family dinner the night after my wedding and was extremely disappointed with the entire experience. The food was ok...but not great, and definitely not as good as some other local places nearby. The thing that totally ruined the experience was the staff. The waitress was beyond rude, pretentious and unprofessional, to the point where she would visibly scowl and roll her eyes when a glass of ice or extra fork was asked for. Definitely not returning. Ever.",1.0
"We've now had a few stellar meals at Colonie - it's become one of our go-to's in the neighborhood when we're looking for a nicer meal.  The food is delicious, the service gracious, and atmosphere perfect whether you're celebrating something or just looking for a nice dinner.Most recently, I can't say enough good things about the fig crostini or the donuts for dessert.  I've been pregnant the last few times, so while I've had to eye the cocktail list longingly, my husband reports that his samples have been tasty, and the wine list quite good.  I've enjoyed that they leave a water bottle on the table...What I love most about Colonie, though, is sitting at the bar in the back.  Sure, you're a little cozy with your neighbors, but watching the ballet that is the kitchen preparing meals is a ton of fun.  Seeing all those plates just made me want to try everything... We'll certainly be back.",5.0

"It's so charming here. A nice big bar area in the front and an open kitchen in the back this place feels welcoming, clean and refreshing. The food is basic meat and vegetables and that exactly how the menu is set up. Raw, cheese, meat, salads, entrees, vegetables. The steak was full of flavor and served with yummy fries.

"Have been to Colonie twice since they've opened and have mixed feelings about the place.  The food is good, but it's definitely still working through it's new restaurant jitters.  The portions are tiny for the price.  The two of us shared a crostini, each had a big dish and shared a carafe of the house wine and our meal was $120.  It's a bit crazy.My second visit there I encountered quite a wait.  The host informed me it would be an hour, so we headed over to Roebling for a cocktail.  We came back an hour later and the host informed me it be another 1/2 hour.  Now, I get that's it busy but I feel that if you're a restaurant that doesn't take reservations then you should be realistic about your wait times.  I was ready to say let's just go to Henry Public but my friend had never been and really wanted to wait.  Honestly, no restaurant should have an hour and a half wait but we stayed anyway and had a good, albeit expensive meal.",3.0
"I don't think words can describe how phenomenal this place is so let me break it down for you. My sister had been dying to try this place, so after watching a movie at the nearby theater this past Sunday we decided to try Colonie for dinner with our husbands. We weren't starving for dinner yet and wanted to have a few drinks down the street at another bar. Though the restaurant does not take reservations, the hostess Chelsea offered to take my sister's cell phone number and call us in about 45 minutes to let us know how busy the dining room was getting. I honestly didn't expect her to call, but low and behold exactly 45 minutes later she called! She told us that they were now on a wait and it would be approximately another 25-40 minutes for a table. No problem. We decided to stay at the bar and have another round of drinks since Chelsea so graciously offered to call us again 10 minutes before a table would be leaving to give us time to get over to the restaurant. And what do you know, maybe 15-20 minutes later that sweet Chelsea kept her word and called us to let us know we could head on over. We walked back over to Colonie, were greeted with warm and friendly smiles and hellos, and were seated promptly. Chelsea, I'm seriously considering calling up your restaurant and speaking with a manager to let them know how amazing you were. You went above and beyond front of the house expectations. We hadn't even stepped foot inside the restaurant yet and I could already tell this place was going to be great! On top of that, every person in that restaurant was just as courteous, prompt, and friendly. The service that night could not have been any more perfect.Ok, now for the food and drinks. The four of us ordered signature cocktails which were delicious and packed a punch. I had the Cherry Oh Baby and oh baby would I drink it again. The ricotta crostini and clam crostini were so scrumptious that after we devoured them we ordered a second round. My sister, my husband, and I ordered the steak, while my brother in law ordered the fish entree. He devoured his, though commented that it was a slightly smaller portion than ours. The steaks--oh my lord. Perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned, and the fat melted in my mouth. The homemade fries were divine and I'm ashamed to admit that I ate my entire little bowl of garlic aioli. The baby greens topped with vinaigrette was the perfect addition on the plate as it cut through all the richness of the steak and fries. As for dessert, my husband and I shared a strawberry tart and I'm still bitter that I just didn't order my own because, well, it was that damn good. My sister ordered their seasonal cherry clafouti, and being half French myself it may not have been the clafouti my own grandmother made, but it was warm and gooey and decadent. My brother in law ordered the sticky toffee cake and one bite had me blown away. Seriously, the entire two hour meal we had consisted of oohing and ahhing over the service, the ambience, and the exceptional food. I don't live in Brooklyn, as we were visiting from eastern Long Island, but my sister and brother in law eat out at fine dining restaurants a lot and they both exclaimed how this was probably the best restaurant they've ever eaten at in Brooklyn. Colonie, I can't wait to come back.",5.0
"Great presentation and good food. The duck is outstanding. Mmm cheeses!

"The look and ""feel"" are very good. The food is also very good but pricey, with fairly small portions. Odd that they don't give you any bread or similar to nibble on while you are waiting for your food. My only real complaint is the loud, thumping music. For a restaurant of this calibre this music is inappropriate, more like something you would hear in a cheap bar. It annoyingly added to the general volume of sound on a busy Saturday night.",3.0
"After hearing friends talk about Colonie my husband and I decided to check it out last week.  Upon entering I was impressed with the atmosphere - and pleased with being seated at the bar overlooking the kitchen.  The night started off on a high note with my strawberry-habanero margarita but then continued to go downhill from there.  The octopus appetizer was the best thing I ate while there - but definitely not the best I've had.  We ordered the scallops, pork chop and a side of brussel sprouts (fried with bacon and cranberries).  My scallops were slightly overcooked, my husbands pork chop was undercooked and the brussel sprouts were not fried - they were charred.  Charred black.    Colonie had potential to be a gem in the neighborhood - but it will take a lot of convincing for me to return.",2.0
"I came here with a beautiful girl, a brother by pact, and a beautiful girl.

Tasty. No one had plans to get tipsy.   A perfect sideboard to our mains. I had the beans and eggs after sharing a basket of baked goods with my party. All were superbly tasty, unique, and yet still comforting.    My only gripe was that the portions were small. I'd have to spend quite a bit to get my fill here.    For someone like me, I'd come to Colonie for the flavor, the service (great staff!), and the atmosphere (friendly clientele..and seriously, what's with the entire staff being extremely beautiful?). The music choice was very interesting but all tasteful. I asked our server and he said that all the staff contribute. Cool!    I look forward to going back. I'll be saving up to splurge!  By the way.

"I had been wanting to try this place since it opened, and finally got the chance this Saturday night. We waited out the rain and arrived at about 7 pm, expecting a lengthy wait. To our delight, we were lead to the last two seats at the kitchen counter--a fantastic surprise! Not only did we get to partake in the delicious food, but we also got to watch it being cooked, and also got to hear the conversations between servers, the chefs, and expiditers--it was like watching some kind of complicated theater production. We ordered the cara cara margarita for a cocktail--the smoked paprika salt on the rim was delectable, and the orange flavor was nice. We split a ricotta honey toast and a green salad for appetizers. Both of these were pretty good, nothing that reinvented the wheel though. For an entree, I got the pork chop, which was perfectly tender, and the sides were delicious as well. Joe got the scallops--again, perfection. We split the violet artichokes, which turned out to be the shining stars of our meal--they arrived in a paper cone, a la street food, and were like a healthy version of carnival snacks. A real treat! Speaking of treats, we couldn't ignore dessert after watching them prepared not 3 feet away all night. We got the doughnuts, lovely little fried balls of dough injected with salty caramel. They were good, but I was a little disappointed there wasn't more salty caramel sauce. Next time, I might go for the ice cream instead. I would highly recommend this place for the service, atmosphere (it's beautiful inside), and, not least of all, the delicious food. Worth every penny!",5.0

The turnips were pickled and didn't go with everything else on the plate. Octopus:Duck Rillette: One of my favorite things we ordered. It felt rather light and refreshing despite the fact the meat is cooked in its own fat.Raviolo: Another hit! The egg yolk pulled all of the other ingredients together. The pasta itself was nicely cooked. Mains:Scallops:Skirt Steak: Cooked perfectly rare. It was a bit sweet but the meat was tender and delicious.Brussel Sprouts:Cauliflower: Romanesco cauliflower is beautiful. We suggested that they say it is Romanesco on the menu.

I realize that eggs Benedict seem like a typical, obvious brunch item that anyone should get right however I find that many people just can't poach eggs correctly and we're rather picky about our hollandaise. They nailed it. Nailed. It. Perfectly poached eggs with light, zesty hollandaise, gorgeous country ham on top of two slightly sweet, freshly baked biscuits. So good. The Gruyere eggs at first glance appear to be just scrambled eggs with a light dusting of Gruyere but once you take a bite they reveal themselves to be creamy, fluffy, delicate, lightly scrambled eggs with rich Gruyere swimming through out. They are paired with cripsy-on-the-outside-smooth-on-the-inside potatoes that seem almost infused with the slightest hint of fresh rosemary. All served with a nice spicy watercress salad, lightly dressed with what I believe to be a sherry vinaigrette. Lovely. The oysters were perfectly shucked, not a drop of brine spilled and were served with a cucumber mignonette that seemed perfectly suited for an early brunch.",4.0
"My husband and I walk in on an early Saturday morning.  Prime brunch time!  There was a five minute wait, since they had to get a table ready for us.  I thought the atmosphere was spectacular with a wall of plants and wooden theme.  Where I sat I could see everyone working hard in the kitchen.  I also noticed that the portions were modest.  I thought it was just enough, but people on my right were complaining the entire time about the size of their food.  My hubby got the duck hash which he was reeling over, it was apparently tingling for the tastebuds.  For my decision, I went with the yogurt granola which I found fresh and delicious.  I especially like the wooden bowls that my food came in.  It made it feel as if it came from mother nature herself.  It has a nice calming effect being surrounded by plants and wood.  I'm not sure how to put it into words, but I would recommend just visiting to see it for yourself.",4.0

I sent my steak back to be cooked further and saw the cook take my salad off the plate with his bare hand and transfer it to the new plate. Really? Gross.The server had no personality. Place is tiny where tables need to be pulled out to sit behind. There were three other tables on a Saturday night all with small children. Not the ambiance you are looking for as a couple.

"I was excited my friend randomly called me to go celebrate her recent promotion at La Colonie. I had driven past it multiple times and always wanted to try it. La Colonie was a fantastic place to got to for an impromptu celebration on a Monday night.  The food met my expectations, the ambiance is nice and comfortable, and the service was on target.Food:St. Simone Oysters: You can't really go wrong with a delicious salty burst in your mouth, but I must say they were nicely shucked.Appetizer:Duck Egg: This was actually my least favorite item we ordered. The turnips were pickled and didn't go with everything else on the plate. Octopus:Duck Rillette: One of my favorite things we ordered. It felt rather light and refreshing despite the fact the meat is cooked in its own fat.Raviolo: Another hit! The egg yolk pulled all of the other ingredients together. The pasta itself was nicely cooked. Mains:Scallops:Skirt Steak: Cooked perfectly rare. It was a bit sweet but the meat was tender and delicious.Brussel Sprouts:Cauliflower: Romanesco cauliflower is beautiful. We suggested that they say it is Romanesco on the menu. The anchovies and caper added the right amount of salt. A bottle of some affordable Gruet and some wine....I will definitely return!",4.0
"I go here for brunch pretty often and really like it. I have tried a number of different things on the menu-the pancakes are to die for, but be warned it is a huge portion/incredibly sweet. I also really like the leek and gruyere scramble-it is simple but good and comes with really good potatoes on the side. The basket of doughnuts are also delicious-the nutella filled one being my favorite. This place can be pretty pricey for brunch (especially if you order drinks) but it is a really cute restaurant with good food and a good atmosphere.",4.0

"It's on what, 10 years ago, was a nondescript block of Atlantic Ave. near the BQE; its neighbors were a burger bar, an ""old man bar"" called Montero's (cool neon sign), and a Tex-Mex Brooklyn chain place, which has since closed. The two-thousand-aughts have brought a chic/hep vibe, and it's in that universe, rather than the stale beer one, that Colonie is situated.It's a nice place: it's storefront width and fairly unadorned with exposed brick walls, but came off as airy and pleasant. The back is where the restaurant proper is, highlighted by a bar around an open kitchen. The clientele is very ""new Brooklyn"": mid-30s couples with $900 chunky glasses and three young children and the young'uns who aspire to be them. The menu had an appealing ""artisinal-this, artisinal that"" theme. A friend and I ordered breakfast foods here and were surprised at how humdrum the food was. The pancakes were a single pancake, cut into quarters, with a little diner pitcher of syrup. The bacon was two strips that wouldn't look out of place at the diner where that syrup came from, although it was smoky and flavorful. For two, with bloody marys, this was more than $50. So, I'd say this is a great place for a second date or to show out-of-town friends a cool place in your new hometown. But I wouldn't rush there for the food.",3.0

I realize gratins are going to be buttery and I generally don't order them. But as a vegetarian who wants more than salads, I didn't have much else to choose from.  I didn't finish it, not even close.  Sticky date dessert:  this is served with creme fraiche ice cream and burnt caramel.  It is a five star dessert.  I highly, highly recommend you leave room for this.

"Wow. I swear I ate at a different restaurant than where everyone else ate... I went to brunch there yesterday for the first time, after hearing good things about the place. We had a great table in the back, and ordered some delicious tea and coffee (in your own french press - fantastic!). And that's about as good as it got.The leek/gruyere scramble was half-cooked, uninspired and rather grey. The tastes did not blend well, even if it had been cooked thru. The side salad was giant pieces of lettuce drowning in dressing. The chef didn't even bother to tear them or give them a chop. I have little tolerance for that kind of laziness. Potatoes were mushy, boring, no seasoning, not even salt. The Biscuit Benedict had a delicious and quite perfect hollandaise, but the biscuits were like hockey pucks - no fluff, no air, overbaked. The bread basket was teeny and just no better than any of the bakeries up the street.The service wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great. The place was packed with a line out the door, and it took our server nearly 20 minutes to bring the check when we were done. Chipped plates & mugs, too. I expect better care & attention from a restaurant that has such high ratings.",2.0

"Agree with a lot of the reviews here. The atmosphere is good, the food not so much. In my case it was not edible. Hard and dry octopus with (2, tiny) old, stale potatoes. Both my friend and I got the same thing and although we left what wasn't much food to begin with in our plates the waiter took them back without asking if there had been anything wrong! Strange, no? Tried dessert since we were still hungry, mediocre pie special for me and my friend got a cheese plate with one tiny little piece of cheese...$80 later we had to look for a place to eat...it was not my first time here but it will be my last. Friendly place but following that all too familiar and predictable pattern: portions getting smaller, prices higher and quality just not there. The 1 star is for atmosphere.",1.0
Hands down one of the best restaurants in Brooklyn. Brunch is amazing. Duck hash. Monkey bread is a must. Dinner is also great. Seasonal ingredients. Small yet very thoughtful menu. Every time I go to Colonie I am aware of the artful service and the vibe feels so good.  I get a feeling that the owners take really good care of the staff and that the staff really believes that they are an essential part of the restaurant and not just the employees.,5.0
"Other than the food not being absolutely terrific, I enjoyed everything else.Cool space.  Great neighborhood.  Staff was pretty good (fyi: when I overtip you it's always a nice touch to say thank you and not ignore me when I pass you on the way out.  It makes me regret the 40% gratuity you got just because I waited tables at one point in my life and believe in Karma).  Big fat open kitchen and cool surfaces and decor.I just didn't have great plates.The Egg was the star player (but what's that crunchy stuff?)The Octopus wasn't feeling well.The Scallops were tasty and fresh and I ate around the apricots/eggplant.The Chicken was better once I got it away from the pool of mustard.Overall the front of the house staff could use a little reigning in.  You're working, I'm paying.And I'm thinking I just caught the kitchen on either an off night or a point where they're sick of the menu.  I felt like there might a lot talent in that team tho.Still better than most.",4.0

We like the ""European"" portions (so there's no need for the staff to ask if you want to take the rest with you). The 'heirloom tomatoes' are so tasty that our kids (!)  asked us to order more (!). Then why not five stars? Well, because the place has been 'overhyped' a bit. Of the four times we went, we decided two times to go somewhere else because the wait would be more than 90 minutes. One time was on a weekday at 6:00pm so there was a table; and one time we decided to order and eat at the bar instead of waiting for a table (which was fine).

We had a great table in the back, and ordered some delicious tea and coffee (in your own french press - fantastic!). And that's about as good as it got.The leek/gruyere scramble was half-cooked, uninspired and rather grey. The tastes did not blend well, even if it had been cooked thru. The side salad was giant pieces of lettuce drowning in dressing. The chef didn't even bother to tear them or give them a chop. I have little tolerance for that kind of laziness. Potatoes were mushy, boring, no seasoning, not even salt. The Biscuit Benedict had a delicious and quite perfect hollandaise, but the biscuits were like hockey pucks - no fluff, no air, overbaked. The bread basket was teeny and just no better than any of the bakeries up the street.The service wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great. The place was packed with a line out the door, and it took our server nearly 20 minutes to bring the check when we were done. Chipped plates & mugs, too. I expect better care & attention from a restaurant that has such high ratings.",2.0
"I live close by and have been here a couple times.  The food is really good -- loved the ricotta crostini and the scallops.  The back room tends to get very loud during dinner time, so if you can snag one of the front booths, much better.",4.0
"Agree with a lot of the reviews here. The atmosphere is good, the food not so much. In my case it was not edible. Hard and dry octopus with (2, tiny) old, stale potatoes. Both my friend and I got the same thing and although we left what wasn't much food to begin with in our plates the waiter took them back without asking if there had been anything wrong! Strange, no? Tried dessert since we were still hungry, mediocre pie special for me and my friend got a cheese plate with one tiny little piece of cheese...$80 later we had to look for a place to eat...it was not my first time here but it will be my last. Friendly place but following that all too familiar and predictable pattern: portions getting smaller, prices higher and quality just not there. The 1 star is for atmosphere.",1.0
Hands down one of the best restaurants in Brooklyn. Brunch is amazing. Duck hash. Monkey bread is a must. Dinner is also great. Seasonal ingredients. Small yet very thoughtful menu. Every time I go to Colonie I am aware of the artful service and the vibe feels so good.  I get a feeling that the owners take really good care of the staff and that the staff really believes that they are an essential part of the restaurant and not just the employees.,5.0
"Other than the food not being absolutely terrific, I enjoyed everything else.Cool space.  Great neighborhood.  Staff was pretty good (fyi: when I overtip you it's always a nice touch to say thank you and not ignore me when I pass you on the way out.  It makes me regret the 40% gratuity you got just because I waited tables at one point in my life and believe in Karma).  Big fat open kitchen and cool surfaces and decor.I just didn't have great plates.The Egg was the star player (but what's that crunchy stuff?)The Octopus wasn't feeling well.The Scallops were tasty and fresh and I ate around the apricots/eggplant.The Chicken was better once I got it away from the pool of mustard.Overall the front of the house staff could use a little reigning in.  You're working, I'm paying.And I'm thinking I just caught the kitchen on either an off night or a point where they're sick of the menu.  I felt like there might a lot talent in that team tho.Still better than most.",4.0

"Colonie hosted a perfect birthday dinner for my partner's 40th.  First and foremost, from the planning stages to the night of, the owners and staff could not have been more accommodating and gracious.  The beautiful atmosphere, customized 4 course menu, hand selected wines and impeccable service all added up to a perfect evening for our 28 friends and family.   And the food was absolutely delicious...  They deserve a Michelin star.  Lots of Love to Colonie!",5.0
"Food ranged from really excellent to not so good. The wines by the glass were just ok. Love the bar and the open kitchen. The space is nice, and the people are nice. There are just way better options in the area. I don't think we would be back but not because of anything bad, just because you can do a lot better for a lot less money.",2.0
"We went here four times now. The food, the service, the atmosphere: absolutely great. We like the ""European"" portions (so there's no need for the staff to ask if you want to take the rest with you). The 'heirloom tomatoes' are so tasty that our kids (!)  asked us to order more (!). Then why not five stars? Well, because the place has been 'overhyped' a bit. Of the four times we went, we decided two times to go somewhere else because the wait would be more than 90 minutes. One time was on a weekday at 6:00pm so there was a table; and one time we decided to order and eat at the bar instead of waiting for a table (which was fine). And you can only reserve as of five persons :-(. If you don't like waiting (people) at the bar you may decide to wait a few months, the buzz will (hopefully) slow down eventually.",4.0

Another bonus was the chili strawberry margarita - a perfect blend of spicy and sweet. Chef Brad was an absolute pleasure to meet, and was almost like our third dinner guest - conversing with us the entire time while also providing us with an education. During dinner, Emily came over to chat and remembered both my friend and I from when we last visited about two months ago. I found this extremely impressive.

"We've been to Colonie twice, once when it first opened.  I was overwhelmed by the space; it's beautiful, and clearly the Kickstarter money paid for a few place settings at best.  Then, I got to thinking: I've seen this before, in practically every modestly new restaurant that favors the ""Hamptons Barnyard"" style and it made me think the trend was getting maybe a little old.  Still, they've invested so much in this and the partners and staff were super-friendly so I am wishing them well. The food: My fish was cooked well but less than room temperature so decidedly cold.  I chalked it up to start-up jitters. I never had oysters Rockefeller and i really enjoyed them, so that's good.The second time trying there was a 2+ hour wait, so thank you River Deli for seating my family from out of town quickly and warmly.The second time we made rezzies as we had a larger party. Service was attentive, food was really just  'meh' at Saul prices (but nowhere remotely close to Saul quality).  I will pay anything for a great dining experience but I honestly felt like I was paying for the reclaimed wood ceiling and not the food.  The wine on tap seems like a gimmick at $12 a glass for a wee pour. I guess in closing, don't try so hard on the 'experience'.  Take a note from the neighborhood institutions: it's all about the food.",2.0

"My new favorite restaurant in an area otherwise deprived of decent choices. The vegetable dishes were savory and large enough to suffice as main courses (perfect for vegetarians). The charred brussel sprouts were DELICIOUS.My fish was flavorful and simple, yet surprisingly filling. We had the date cake and creme fraiche ice cream for dessert and it did not disappoint. The cocktails were fresh and original too. Aside from the food, the wait staff were nothing but genuine and friendly (they make that extra step without being too invasive). The ambiance was comfortable and hip and though I laughed at the description of the plant wall they had on their website, it was a nice touch. I also enjoyed the fact that the restaurant itself felt quite spacious despite the fact that it was nearly filled to capacity. I will definitely be coming back and I don't often feel that way about the often too trendy and fleeting NYC restaurant scene.",5.0

"A friend and I dropped into Colonie last night (Wed).  It was superb in all respects.  We went just after 6:00 and sat at the corner of the ""kitchen bar"".  A perfect location to watch the chefs do their magic, talk and see the restaurant.  The food was a 10 out of 10.  ""The Egg"" was fantastic.  The pork chop was perfect.  I highly recommend the crostini with duck.Our server, Sara, was top-quality - she was attentive and guided us through the entire menu.  Place your entire meal in her hands and you won't be disappointed.",5.0
"Far and away one of my favorite dining experiences. The menu is wonderful-- its easy to create a meal of small and large plates (the egg salad crostini and gnudi are especially tasty) and the cocktails are awesome. (They put like, real strawberries in the strawberry margarita. What a novelty!)The service is warm and very knowledgeable of the menu with no hint of pushiness. This is truly a neighborhood  restaurant-- affordable, friendly, and delicious! Worth a trip to BK if you don't live there already. Head to Floyd or Henry Public afterwards for a nightcap.",5.0
"We went on Saturday night at 8pm (prime time) and they were able to seat us at the counter. This was great because we were able to watch the chef's masterfully prepare the meals. The food was AMAZING, decor is gorgeous and service was excellent. We had the doughnuts and sticky date cake for dessert and both were heavenly. I highly recomment this place!",5.0
"After using Yelp for some time, I felt compelled to post my first review after eating at Colonie this evening. The food was spectacular - easily the best meal we've had in the neighborhood since moving to the area over three years ago. The ambience, food, cocktails and service were all fantastic. I can't recommend it highly enough.",5.0
"We've been to Colonie twice, once when it first opened.  I was overwhelmed by the space; it's beautiful, and clearly the Kickstarter money paid for a few place settings at best.  Then, I got to thinking: I've seen this before, in practically every modestly new restaurant that favors the ""Hamptons Barnyard"" style and it made me think the trend was getting maybe a little old.  Still, they've invested so much in this and the partners and staff were super-friendly so I am wishing them well. The food: My fish was cooked well but less than room temperature so decidedly cold.  I chalked it up to start-up jitters. I never had oysters Rockefeller and i really enjoyed them, so that's good.The second time trying there was a 2+ hour wait, so thank you River Deli for seating my family from out of town quickly and warmly.The second time we made rezzies as we had a larger party. Service was attentive, food was really just  'meh' at Saul prices (but nowhere remotely close to Saul quality).  I will pay anything for a great dining experience but I honestly felt like I was paying for the reclaimed wood ceiling and not the food.  The wine on tap seems like a gimmick at $12 a glass for a wee pour. I guess in closing, don't try so hard on the 'experience'.  Take a note from the neighborhood institutions: it's all about the food.",2.0
"Inventive cuisine, friendly staff, inviting atmosphere. What more could you ask for? Worth the hype.",5.0
"My new favorite restaurant in an area otherwise deprived of decent choices. The vegetable dishes were savory and large enough to suffice as main courses (perfect for vegetarians). The charred brussel sprouts were DELICIOUS.My fish was flavorful and simple, yet surprisingly filling. We had the date cake and creme fraiche ice cream for dessert and it did not disappoint. The cocktails were fresh and original too. Aside from the food, the wait staff were nothing but genuine and friendly (they make that extra step without being too invasive). The ambiance was comfortable and hip and though I laughed at the description of the plant wall they had on their website, it was a nice touch. I also enjoyed the fact that the restaurant itself felt quite spacious despite the fact that it was nearly filled to capacity. I will definitely be coming back and I don't often feel that way about the often too trendy and fleeting NYC restaurant scene.",5.0
"My boyfriend and I came here yesterday (Saturday) for dinner and everything was wonderful. The food was amazing, the cocktails were amazing, the decor, music, service, etc. We had to wait about 20 minutes for seats but it was worth it. Can't wait to go back there!!! Some people on here have been complaining about the ""overly enthusiastic service,"" well we LOVED it.

"From the management that brought you Public, Double Crown and Madame Geneva, Colonie, located on a busy stretch of Atlantic Avenue, brings a new breath of fresh air to the restaurant-starved neighborhood of Brooklyn Heights. In recent years, other local favorites such as the Italian staples, Queen and Noodle Pudding, as well as the game-centric Henry's End, have brought notoriety to the area, but not destination worthiness. That has all changed with the joyous arrival of Colonie. Opened in 2011, with its gutsy New American menu, Colonie is headed by Chef Brad McDonald who replaced Alex Sorenson (Mas-Farmouse) earlier this year. Chef McDonald brings an astonishing pedigree with him, having staged at some of the best restaurants in the world including Alain Ducasse at Essex House, Per Se, and Noma. His talents, along with an adept and enthusiastic wait staff, has merited Colonie with the highest current food rating (26) for Brooklyn Heights in the 2011-12 NYC Zagat Guide. The restaurant is bedecked with a ceiling that is completely lined end-to-end with wood planks, and between the lively bar patrons and the brick wall dining room lays an impressive and towering vertical herb garden where the cooks can pick their daily foraging. The airy, open kitchen is designed to reduce temperature in the dining room. This is a welcome relief to the customers that scrum to be seated at the dining bar attached directly to the open kitchen. The crafty barkeeps execute one of the most interesting libation menus I've seen as of late. All juices are freshly pressed to order, using commercial juicers found in the best vegan establishments. My friend, Isabel, who is a ""newbie"" to New York and my ""foodie-in-training"", joined me in sampling the Sugar Kiss Cooler house cocktail ($12); a delightful and refreshing mixture of organic gin, Lillet, fresh melon juice, basil syrup, and sparkling wine. The restaurant only takes reservations for parties of five or more. We waited comfortably at the bar for about thirty minutes, before graciously being seated in the bustling dining room. The menu has everything for everyone, from the light eater to the ravenous multi-course craving ""foodie"". For starters, we indulged in absolutely luscious Rabbit & Foie Gras Terrine with a Frisee Salad topped with Port Reduction ($14). The intricate quality of this charcuterie was as amazing as the famous Tourte De Gibiers I once encountered at Bar Boulud. From the vegetable selections, we thoroughly enjoyed the savory Braised Young Leeks with Romesco Sauce, Almonds and Cilantro ($11). Colonie has a masterful wine list with excellent choices from the nearby wineries to the international and many at very reasonable prices. After a thorough perusing of the wine list, we selected a bottle of the superior 2008 Domaine Chantegut Vacqueyras from the Rhone Valley; a powerful spicy, raspberry, and cherry-fruited blend of Syrah with Grenache ($49). From the large plate choices, Isabel and I were floored by a succulent quartet of sweet, juicy, and impeccably seared Scallops with Apricot and Curry Purée, Pickled Eggplant and Pine Nuts ($22). The seasonal and all-together remarkable Berkshire Sausages with Fennel, Peppers and Onion ($18) were a perfect summation to the main courses. To bring this glorious meal to an appropriate crescendo we pampered ourselves with a tasty, albeit pedestrian Blueberry Citrus Almond Tart and Buttermilk Ice Cream ($8). Conversely, the Fresh Salt-Caramel Custard Filled Doughnuts ($8) paired precisely my crisp glass of Hungarian Tokaj Cuvée Classic Dessert wine ($16). Two stars for the inspiring cuisine, another for the hip scene and rustic digs, one more for the attentive and smiling service. Dinner for two with cocktails, bottle of wine, tax and tip was $210.",4.0

"Portions people, portions. I went with Jordan S & like he said, we all left hungry.

The duck hash was the clear winner, and I feel kind of bad that I ate a few bites of my friends'. However, the asparagus omelet was pretty tasty and fluffy itself. The Bloody Marys were also really nicely flavored, but again too small for the price tag. The place is damn cute though and I just loved being in there. That's got to be worth something, and I will probably be back if I am feeling fancy enough to afford dinner there. Word to the wise: the two window tables up front are first come first served so if there's a long wait you might be able to snag one of those.

"I've been here twice so far.  Once, I sat at the kitchen counter thingie with two friends.  That was a fun experience, watching the chef.  He seemed like a nice guy.Last night, I went with 4 of my friends for my birthday.  The host held a table in the back for us, even though my friends were a little late.  I really like the ambiance here, and the food is great, too.  I've had a few of the crostini, a bunch of the vegetables and salads, and pretty much anything they have that involves risotto or mushrooms.However, last night, our server was a heinous b*.  My friend had put her umbrella on the floor in the corner behind our table.  When the server noticed it, she glared at it and us like there was a dead raccoon on the floor.  My friend apologized and said she thought it'd be out of the way there, and the server was just rude in response.  She also was a b* about how to pronounce certain menu items--I have off-the-boat Italian relatives; they pronounce ricotta in just two syllables.  I know it's a contested topic, but, hey, server, don't be obnoxious.  Don't try to correct me with your Middle America pronunciation of the word.  You know what I'm ordering.  Just write it down on your pad and call it a day.  As we were getting ready to settle the check, my friend asked if she could break a 5 dollar bill with some singles and some quarters.  The server, again, was laughably rude, telling my friend that ""we don't do coinage here,"" with an ugly snarl on her face and an aggressive tone in her voice.  Really, lady?  Who are you?  Who talks like that?  People who say rih-cat-ah?  Oh, okay.This would have been a 5-star review, but this woman just needs to go.  What is she so pissed about?  I can never understand people who work in a service industry yet clearly hate dealing with people.",4.0
"I want to give this a 2.5 but can't so we'll round up (out of generosity.) My husband and I live in the area and decided to go for an early dinner on Sat. We sat at the ""chef's table"" which was fun, and had a yummy cocktail to start. Next came the ricotta with honey and mint crostini, delicious and super simple, then the beet salad with orange and crispy hazelnuts. To this point I would have been happy. The restaurant itself is very beautifully designed and I loved the feel. Then we ordered ""small dishes"" for our mains since we both did salads, I had ""The Egg"" since I'd read it was a must and he had the orchiette which was super tiny but good. My egg was cooked through- huh? This was supposed to be a delicious runny egg on top of wheatberries and mushrooms, not so and it took a while for anyone to come ask about it. They sent it back (I hate doing that) and after we'd finished everything else the new dish appeared. It was good, not great, the egg was burned around the edges. The brussels sprouts were pretty amazing and earned the place an extra star. After having  a few small dishes and a drink the bill came to $112. This makes me hate living in NY. What? I could have cooked a better meal at home, sorry to say but true. The bill left a bad taste in my mouth especially since they barely apologized for the egg- no dessert, no drinks no comped dish. I wouldn't recommend it, maybe for a drink in the front but that's about it.",3.0
"I wish I'd reviewed Colonie after the first four times I'd visited because everything was wonderful--food, environment, and service. However, I went last night with visiting friends and the food and atmosphere were still excellent (though portions seemed to have decreased a little, which was fine) and the hostess was lovely, but our server was really disappointing to the point where her b*y attitude tainted the entire experience. I don't know if Ashley V. (according to our receipt) was just having a bad day, but she was rude and unprofessional, rushing us along, never smiling, never checking on us, and making a couple snippy remarks. It was unacceptable and I was embarrassed because I had just been telling my friends how great every aspect of this restaurant had been on previous visits. Despite this, we still left a decent tip because I love the restaurant and I imagine the tip is shared among several people. I'm definitely going back to Colonie, but will request not to sit in her section--she was so ""blech""!",4.0
"Went here for brunch with my boyfriend a few months ago and have been meaning to write about it ever since. With so many trendy places popping up, I've been disappointed with interesting decore and average food. Colonie, from my experience, has gotten (almost) everything right. THE FOOD-and that's what any restaurant should really be about-was absolutely delicious. I don't remember the last time I so thoroughly enjoyed every bite, all atmospheric considerations aside (and Colonie is very quaint yet modern and cool in terms of decor). I had the scrambled eggs with gruyer and asparagus...seriously, right down to the home fries (which, let's face it are usually a boring yet necessary side dish) were just divine. Can't wait to try Colonie for dinner!! Down side? a little too close quarters in terms of tables and the staff wasn't the most attentive. Still! Worth trying.",4.0
"Came here for brunch with my family, and since waiting for a table would have been a little too long for us, we decided to eat at the bar, which was totally fine.  The bartender was friendly and responsive, and on the whole I found the staff to be very pleasant and helpful - they really tried to get us to a table, but it just wasn't working out.  The food, on the whole was really delicious.  I heard rave reviews about the steak sandwich from my stoic Irish-Catholic father who will pretty much describe just about anything as ""fine,"" and the ramp scramble from my mother.  We ordered the ""basket of baked goods"" which were also excellent.  I had the duck hash with roasted fingerling potatoes and a poached egg.  Firstly, only including one poached egg I feel was a little more than stingy.  Second, it was less poached and more borderline hard-boiled it was so overdone.  Which is really a shame because I was very much looking forward to having that yolk mix in with the potatoes and duck.  Speaking of the duck, the dish was probably 98% potatoes, seriously I think there were two small pieces of duck in there.  And while those two pieces were incredibly delicious, I was left scratching my head as to why this was considered a main course.  I mean, really it was half an ounce of meat.  Not cool for $13.  Oh but the BACON is delicious.  The bloody Mary was good, interesting they used jalapeno, but needed more heat.  The ones at Henry public or Jack the Horse are way better. I wanted to give this place 3 stars on account of the silly portion size, but the cooking here is pretty special.",4.0

"I went on a great date last night to Colonie in Brooklyn. The second you enter the restaurant you feel like you are in a farm to table restaurant in Rhinebeck or Woodstock. The bar is beautiful and the sitting is unique. There is an open kitchen and the staff is so friendly and inviting. We tried a lot of great small dishes. I recommend them all. The Egg dish is fantastic. It is like nothing you have eaten before. So unique tasting with the spelt. My mouth is watering thinking about it. We also had the risotto, which was probably my least favorite although I would definitely order it again. A little chewy, but definitely seemed like the taste the chef was going for. Do not skip the mushroom crostini. The bread is seasoned and grilled perfectly, the thyme on the wild mushroom is fantastic. We shared the two pieces of crostini, but I definitely wanted them both to myself! We also had the beet salad. The hazelnuts are incredible, you will want to eat them by the handful. The ricotta salada really compliments the rest of the dish. I always love shaving it over my pastas. Will definitely start using it in salads. If you have room for dessert (we didn't), definitely try one. The people sitting next to us seemed to order one of everything and it all looked good. Well worth the trip to Brooklyn!",5.0
"It is a welcome change to see nicer restaurants coming to Brooklyn heights.  Colonie is Trendy = Loud and crowded with long waits either for a seat and/or food.  Food relies on far too much butter and salt for my palate.  It's probably best as a fun, meeting place, but not if you have experience at better restaurants.",2.0

"I've been here twice so far.  Once, I sat at the kitchen counter thingie with two friends.  That was a fun experience, watching the chef.  He seemed like a nice guy.Last night, I went with 4 of my friends for my birthday.  The host held a table in the back for us, even though my friends were a little late.  I really like the ambiance here, and the food is great, too.  I've had a few of the crostini, a bunch of the vegetables and salads, and pretty much anything they have that involves risotto or mushrooms.However, last night, our server was a heinous b*.  My friend had put her umbrella on the floor in the corner behind our table.  When the server noticed it, she glared at it and us like there was a dead raccoon on the floor.  My friend apologized and said she thought it'd be out of the way there, and the server was just rude in response.  She also was a b* about how to pronounce certain menu items--I have off-the-boat Italian relatives; they pronounce ricotta in just two syllables.  I know it's a contested topic, but, hey, server, don't be obnoxious.  Don't try to correct me with your Middle America pronunciation of the word.  You know what I'm ordering.  Just write it down on your pad and call it a day.  As we were getting ready to settle the check, my friend asked if she could break a 5 dollar bill with some singles and some quarters.  The server, again, was laughably rude, telling my friend that ""we don't do coinage here,"" with an ugly snarl on her face and an aggressive tone in her voice.  Really, lady?  Who are you?  Who talks like that?  People who say rih-cat-ah?  Oh, okay.This would have been a 5-star review, but this woman just needs to go.  What is she so pissed about?  I can never understand people who work in a service industry yet clearly hate dealing with people.",4.0
"I want to give this a 2.5 but can't so we'll round up (out of generosity.) My husband and I live in the area and decided to go for an early dinner on Sat. We sat at the ""chef's table"" which was fun, and had a yummy cocktail to start. Next came the ricotta with honey and mint crostini, delicious and super simple, then the beet salad with orange and crispy hazelnuts. To this point I would have been happy. The restaurant itself is very beautifully designed and I loved the feel. Then we ordered ""small dishes"" for our mains since we both did salads, I had ""The Egg"" since I'd read it was a must and he had the orchiette which was super tiny but good. My egg was cooked through- huh? This was supposed to be a delicious runny egg on top of wheatberries and mushrooms, not so and it took a while for anyone to come ask about it. They sent it back (I hate doing that) and after we'd finished everything else the new dish appeared. It was good, not great, the egg was burned around the edges. The brussels sprouts were pretty amazing and earned the place an extra star. After having  a few small dishes and a drink the bill came to $112. This makes me hate living in NY. What? I could have cooked a better meal at home, sorry to say but true. The bill left a bad taste in my mouth especially since they barely apologized for the egg- no dessert, no drinks no comped dish. I wouldn't recommend it, maybe for a drink in the front but that's about it.",3.0
"I wish I'd reviewed Colonie after the first four times I'd visited because everything was wonderful--food, environment, and service. However, I went last night with visiting friends and the food and atmosphere were still excellent (though portions seemed to have decreased a little, which was fine) and the hostess was lovely, but our server was really disappointing to the point where her b*y attitude tainted the entire experience. I don't know if Ashley V. (according to our receipt) was just having a bad day, but she was rude and unprofessional, rushing us along, never smiling, never checking on us, and making a couple snippy remarks. It was unacceptable and I was embarrassed because I had just been telling my friends how great every aspect of this restaurant had been on previous visits. Despite this, we still left a decent tip because I love the restaurant and I imagine the tip is shared among several people. I'm definitely going back to Colonie, but will request not to sit in her section--she was so ""blech""!",4.0
"Went here for brunch with my boyfriend a few months ago and have been meaning to write about it ever since. With so many trendy places popping up, I've been disappointed with interesting decore and average food. Colonie, from my experience, has gotten (almost) everything right. THE FOOD-and that's what any restaurant should really be about-was absolutely delicious. I don't remember the last time I so thoroughly enjoyed every bite, all atmospheric considerations aside (and Colonie is very quaint yet modern and cool in terms of decor). I had the scrambled eggs with gruyer and asparagus...seriously, right down to the home fries (which, let's face it are usually a boring yet necessary side dish) were just divine. Can't wait to try Colonie for dinner!! Down side? a little too close quarters in terms of tables and the staff wasn't the most attentive. Still! Worth trying.",4.0
"Came here for brunch with my family, and since waiting for a table would have been a little too long for us, we decided to eat at the bar, which was totally fine.  The bartender was friendly and responsive, and on the whole I found the staff to be very pleasant and helpful - they really tried to get us to a table, but it just wasn't working out.  The food, on the whole was really delicious.  I heard rave reviews about the steak sandwich from my stoic Irish-Catholic father who will pretty much describe just about anything as ""fine,"" and the ramp scramble from my mother.  We ordered the ""basket of baked goods"" which were also excellent.  I had the duck hash with roasted fingerling potatoes and a poached egg.  Firstly, only including one poached egg I feel was a little more than stingy.  Second, it was less poached and more borderline hard-boiled it was so overdone.  Which is really a shame because I was very much looking forward to having that yolk mix in with the potatoes and duck.  Speaking of the duck, the dish was probably 98% potatoes, seriously I think there were two small pieces of duck in there.  And while those two pieces were incredibly delicious, I was left scratching my head as to why this was considered a main course.  I mean, really it was half an ounce of meat.  Not cool for $13.  Oh but the BACON is delicious.  The bloody Mary was good, interesting they used jalapeno, but needed more heat.  The ones at Henry public or Jack the Horse are way better. I wanted to give this place 3 stars on account of the silly portion size, but the cooking here is pretty special.",4.0
"Still some kinks to be worked out.  Service at the bar is slow and confused.  Nice atmosphere, though.  Probably worth a second try.",2.0
"I went on a great date last night to Colonie in Brooklyn. The second you enter the restaurant you feel like you are in a farm to table restaurant in Rhinebeck or Woodstock. The bar is beautiful and the sitting is unique. There is an open kitchen and the staff is so friendly and inviting. We tried a lot of great small dishes. I recommend them all. The Egg dish is fantastic. It is like nothing you have eaten before. So unique tasting with the spelt. My mouth is watering thinking about it. We also had the risotto, which was probably my least favorite although I would definitely order it again. A little chewy, but definitely seemed like the taste the chef was going for. Do not skip the mushroom crostini. The bread is seasoned and grilled perfectly, the thyme on the wild mushroom is fantastic. We shared the two pieces of crostini, but I definitely wanted them both to myself! We also had the beet salad. The hazelnuts are incredible, you will want to eat them by the handful. The ricotta salada really compliments the rest of the dish. I always love shaving it over my pastas. Will definitely start using it in salads. If you have room for dessert (we didn't), definitely try one. The people sitting next to us seemed to order one of everything and it all looked good. Well worth the trip to Brooklyn!",5.0
"It is a welcome change to see nicer restaurants coming to Brooklyn heights.  Colonie is Trendy = Loud and crowded with long waits either for a seat and/or food.  Food relies on far too much butter and salt for my palate.  It's probably best as a fun, meeting place, but not if you have experience at better restaurants.",2.0
