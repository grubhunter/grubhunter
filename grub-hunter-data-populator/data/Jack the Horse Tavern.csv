"I have been to Jack the Horse twice in the last 3 months for dinner, the last time this past Saturday. Both times were pleasant experiences, the first time was an out of the park 5 star experience and my last experience was more of a 3 star, so I am giving them a 4 star average. The first time I went with a group of friends and we shared a lot of sides and starters along with our mains and everything was delicious. The Brussels Sprouts and Cauliflower were both great. The Macaroni & Cheese, Beets and the Grilled Octopus were all great dishes! For my main I had a special of the day, which was Short Ribs and was AMAZING. I also tried a bit of my friends burger which was SLAMMING! This past Saturday I had the Hanger Steak, which I just wanted to be better, the quality and flavor of the meat was just sub-par compared to my last experience and the amazing short ribs.The environment is cozy and borders almost on enchanting, you really could image you are in a tavern from a bygone era, and its location on a charming corner of Brooklyn Heights really helps that feel.",4.0
Great cocktails. Okay food. Hated our server. He was obnoxious and and unfriendly. We had Mac and cheese- too many bread crumbs. Steak- nice flavor but over done. Mussels- good flavor and enormous. Carrot cake was great. Seriously wouldn't go back JUST because our server bothered me so much.,3.0
"A wonderful and lovely Brooklyn joint to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon brunch. Two thumbs up for the aptly named ""Krista's Excellent Scones, Biscuit & Jams ($7). While I have no clue who Krista is, she should be proud of these baked goods! Something very comforting about how delightfully buttery and crumbly the scones were. I took a long time to decide what to order as the menu contained so much that I love. I eventually settled for the Eggs Orleans. The juicy Barcat oysters were fried crisply and paired splendidly with the hollandaise, artichokes and poached eggs. It was a nice balance of tart and creamy. Bacon lovers have to order a side of crisp (very) ""Bacon, Bacon, Bacon!!"" The Bloody Mary is quite tasty though you may want them to up the tabasco if you typically enjoy a spicier version of it.",4.0
"I came to this place based on a friend's recommendation and I have to say that she didn't disappoint!  I had heard they had an awesome happy hour, so I can't say much about their restaurant as a whole.  Their happy hour though is an easy five stars!I walked in with a friend and there was a small high top table near the bar where we were seated--happy hour is bar seating only.  The place was casual and queit; it's a great place to catch up with friends and not shout over loud background music.  Before introducing himself, the waiter walked over and pointed to my friend and me and named two drinks.  Usually, I would find this a little annoying, but for some reason, it was endearing and I went with his recommendation.  Their happy hour cocktails are $6 and happy hour beers were $4.  Their drink list for happy hour wasn't huge (probably about 6 different drinks), but my friend and I were more than happy with what we had.   The food menu for happy hour is also relatively small, but it includes the famed smoky gouda mac and cheese, which is...wait for it...so gouda.  It is definitely very smoky, but everything about it is perfect--bread crumbs, ample portion...perfect!  We also had the bacalao croquettes with sweet pickle aioli.  These were good, but they weren't as delicious as the mac and cheese.  Still, I was happy we ordered them.Overall, I can't think of anything that I'd change about my experience at Jack the Horse Tavern, and I would easily go back any day for happy hour or even try their full menu!",5.0
"I came here for the Mac & Cheese after it made the Gothamist (and many others) list for best Mac & Cheese in the city.It's definitely on the creamier, decadent side...In the best way possible. You can taste the hint of smokiness provided by the Gouda mixed with the additional richness of the fontina. Tiny bit overboard with the breadcrumbs. I have no complaints per se, but I've just had better. Happy hour was a great deal! Will definitely come back for a drink.",3.0
"My wife and I were in Brooklyn for the last night of our stay in NYC and were very excited to have dinner at Jack the Horse Tavern, plus oysters at the small room next door. We had reservations for 7:30, but ended up hungry and arrived about 5:30 for oysters and found an empty restaurant. We asked the hostess if we might eat some oysters and then bump up our dinner plans, she said no, they were fully booked.We went next door for oysters as planned and figured we'd get enough to hold us for a while, then we could walk around and come back for our 7:30. While enjoying our drinks, the hostess came in and said she could seat us at 6PM but would need the table by 8PM. Fair enough. We aren't dawdlers; we like to eat and enjoy, then move on.The oyster room is compact and very cozy. The service was very prompt, cocktails good, and who can't enjoy a $1 oyster? So far so good.We walked over at 6PM and sat down at a small table on the bench that runs the length of the back wall. Great ambience, really a very nice place located in a very charming section of Brooklyn Heights. (For what it's worth, about half the tables were still empty, although starting to fill, and two remained empty until almost the very end of our meal.)And then the hostess spilled an entire glass of water on my crotch! Okay... I mopped myself off but was soaked through to my underwear and enjoyed the rest of the meal in a very damp state. Did I mention it was December?The waitress was apologetic and, fortunately, I'm not a hot head and decided to let it go, despite my soaking underwear. The funny thing is, the manager, waitress, hostess, no one came over and said ""gosh, so sorry. Can we buy you an appetizer? Can we buy you a cocktail?"" That would have been a well-received gesture but, alas, one that never came.Still, I'm feeling good, I'm with my wife and into my second cocktail, and I try to enjoy myself no matter what.Our ravioli appetizer arrived luke warm. I again let it go and we did enjoy it, cool as it was. My next cocktail arrived, the Hemingway Daiquiri, which was most delicious.Our entrees arrived (still no visit from the manager) in the form of diver sea scallops and a roasted duck breast. Again, not very hot, although they looked well cooked. I wondered if they had been sitting in the window for a while. Both dishes were tasty, although a bit under salted. The duck was good for a few bites until I ran into a thread of gristle or connective tissue that made it inedible. I had to spit a mouthful into my napkin.When the waitress came over I asked her to take it away. I've probably done that twice in my whole life, so that's a biggie. Again, no visit from the manager ""I'm sorry you didn't like the duck, can we get you something else?"" Why not? That's a serious issue.They did take the duck off the tab without me asking. My wife and I headed out the door; the hostess didn't even notice as she noodled on her iPhone. No ""good bye, I hope you enjoyed your meal."" No anything.This is, I think, the first time I've ever reviewed anything on Yelp, and I only took the time because, as a small business owner myself, I would want to know if things were wrong with my business. Most restaurant customers, once disappointed, won't say a word and will, disastrously, never return.This is a charming place in a very charming Brooklyn neighborhood. Unfortunately, we were left disappointed, which was unexpected given the reviews I read before booking. They had all of the pieces of the puzzle and just couldn't quite put them together for us. When you run a $25+ a plate restaurant you need to have everything working like a clock. The hostess, the server, the food, everything. There are just too many other places where customers can spend their money and have a great experience. I would much rather spend $150 on a great dinner than waste $50 on a mediocre one. All in all we spent about $120 at JTH; probably half that was kind of ""meh."" I don't want to slam them with a one star review, as I think that's a bit cruel, but I wish I could make it 2.5 stars. I'm sure they can do much better than what we received.My suggestion would be to hit the oyster room during happy hour for cocktails, appetizers and oysters, then maybe try the restaurant if you are feeling lucky. If not, head to one of the other neighborhood establishments. There are plenty to choose from. We ended up having after-dinner drinks at the Brooklyn Heights Wine Bar which we greatly enjoyed.",3.0
"Came here for Sunday brunch. Bad waitress and that kills the entire experience...Bloody Mary was not impressive either. No drink specials -- $9 for a mimosa and $10 for a classic bloody.

But anyway, no food for me and I will take my money and appetite elsewhere. Minus the $10 wasted on the Bloody Mary. So -- 2 stars because the hostess was quite pleasant.

This place is a must visit when in Brooklyn Heights. They have great drinks and food. Matt is one of the best bartenders behind the counter.

They didn't even allow me to explain myself and completely humiliated me.Shame on you!

"I have been to Jack the Horse twice in the last 3 months for dinner, the last time this past Saturday. Both times were pleasant experiences, the first time was an out of the park 5 star experience and my last experience was more of a 3 star, so I am giving them a 4 star average. The first time I went with a group of friends and we shared a lot of sides and starters along with our mains and everything was delicious. The Brussels Sprouts and Cauliflower were both great. The Macaroni & Cheese, Beets and the Grilled Octopus were all great dishes! For my main I had a special of the day, which was Short Ribs and was AMAZING. I also tried a bit of my friends burger which was SLAMMING! This past Saturday I had the Hanger Steak, which I just wanted to be better, the quality and flavor of the meat was just sub-par compared to my last experience and the amazing short ribs.The environment is cozy and borders almost on enchanting, you really could image you are in a tavern from a bygone era, and its location on a charming corner of Brooklyn Heights really helps that feel.",4.0
Great cocktails. Okay food. Hated our server. He was obnoxious and and unfriendly. We had Mac and cheese- too many bread crumbs. Steak- nice flavor but over done. Mussels- good flavor and enormous. Carrot cake was great. Seriously wouldn't go back JUST because our server bothered me so much.,3.0
"A wonderful and lovely Brooklyn joint to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon brunch. Two thumbs up for the aptly named ""Krista's Excellent Scones, Biscuit & Jams ($7). While I have no clue who Krista is, she should be proud of these baked goods! Something very comforting about how delightfully buttery and crumbly the scones were. I took a long time to decide what to order as the menu contained so much that I love. I eventually settled for the Eggs Orleans. The juicy Barcat oysters were fried crisply and paired splendidly with the hollandaise, artichokes and poached eggs. It was a nice balance of tart and creamy. Bacon lovers have to order a side of crisp (very) ""Bacon, Bacon, Bacon!!"" The Bloody Mary is quite tasty though you may want them to up the tabasco if you typically enjoy a spicier version of it.",4.0
"I came to this place based on a friend's recommendation and I have to say that she didn't disappoint!  I had heard they had an awesome happy hour, so I can't say much about their restaurant as a whole.  Their happy hour though is an easy five stars!I walked in with a friend and there was a small high top table near the bar where we were seated--happy hour is bar seating only.  The place was casual and queit; it's a great place to catch up with friends and not shout over loud background music.  Before introducing himself, the waiter walked over and pointed to my friend and me and named two drinks.  Usually, I would find this a little annoying, but for some reason, it was endearing and I went with his recommendation.  Their happy hour cocktails are $6 and happy hour beers were $4.  Their drink list for happy hour wasn't huge (probably about 6 different drinks), but my friend and I were more than happy with what we had.   The food menu for happy hour is also relatively small, but it includes the famed smoky gouda mac and cheese, which is...wait for it...so gouda.  It is definitely very smoky, but everything about it is perfect--bread crumbs, ample portion...perfect!  We also had the bacalao croquettes with sweet pickle aioli.  These were good, but they weren't as delicious as the mac and cheese.  Still, I was happy we ordered them.Overall, I can't think of anything that I'd change about my experience at Jack the Horse Tavern, and I would easily go back any day for happy hour or even try their full menu!",5.0
"I came here for the Mac & Cheese after it made the Gothamist (and many others) list for best Mac & Cheese in the city.It's definitely on the creamier, decadent side...In the best way possible. You can taste the hint of smokiness provided by the Gouda mixed with the additional richness of the fontina. Tiny bit overboard with the breadcrumbs. I have no complaints per se, but I've just had better. Happy hour was a great deal! Will definitely come back for a drink.",3.0
"My wife and I were in Brooklyn for the last night of our stay in NYC and were very excited to have dinner at Jack the Horse Tavern, plus oysters at the small room next door. We had reservations for 7:30, but ended up hungry and arrived about 5:30 for oysters and found an empty restaurant. We asked the hostess if we might eat some oysters and then bump up our dinner plans, she said no, they were fully booked.We went next door for oysters as planned and figured we'd get enough to hold us for a while, then we could walk around and come back for our 7:30. While enjoying our drinks, the hostess came in and said she could seat us at 6PM but would need the table by 8PM. Fair enough. We aren't dawdlers; we like to eat and enjoy, then move on.The oyster room is compact and very cozy. The service was very prompt, cocktails good, and who can't enjoy a $1 oyster? So far so good.We walked over at 6PM and sat down at a small table on the bench that runs the length of the back wall. Great ambience, really a very nice place located in a very charming section of Brooklyn Heights. (For what it's worth, about half the tables were still empty, although starting to fill, and two remained empty until almost the very end of our meal.)And then the hostess spilled an entire glass of water on my crotch! Okay... I mopped myself off but was soaked through to my underwear and enjoyed the rest of the meal in a very damp state. Did I mention it was December?The waitress was apologetic and, fortunately, I'm not a hot head and decided to let it go, despite my soaking underwear. The funny thing is, the manager, waitress, hostess, no one came over and said ""gosh, so sorry. Can we buy you an appetizer? Can we buy you a cocktail?"" That would have been a well-received gesture but, alas, one that never came.Still, I'm feeling good, I'm with my wife and into my second cocktail, and I try to enjoy myself no matter what.Our ravioli appetizer arrived luke warm. I again let it go and we did enjoy it, cool as it was. My next cocktail arrived, the Hemingway Daiquiri, which was most delicious.Our entrees arrived (still no visit from the manager) in the form of diver sea scallops and a roasted duck breast. Again, not very hot, although they looked well cooked. I wondered if they had been sitting in the window for a while. Both dishes were tasty, although a bit under salted. The duck was good for a few bites until I ran into a thread of gristle or connective tissue that made it inedible. I had to spit a mouthful into my napkin.When the waitress came over I asked her to take it away. I've probably done that twice in my whole life, so that's a biggie. Again, no visit from the manager ""I'm sorry you didn't like the duck, can we get you something else?"" Why not? That's a serious issue.They did take the duck off the tab without me asking. My wife and I headed out the door; the hostess didn't even notice as she noodled on her iPhone. No ""good bye, I hope you enjoyed your meal."" No anything.This is, I think, the first time I've ever reviewed anything on Yelp, and I only took the time because, as a small business owner myself, I would want to know if things were wrong with my business. Most restaurant customers, once disappointed, won't say a word and will, disastrously, never return.This is a charming place in a very charming Brooklyn neighborhood. Unfortunately, we were left disappointed, which was unexpected given the reviews I read before booking. They had all of the pieces of the puzzle and just couldn't quite put them together for us. When you run a $25+ a plate restaurant you need to have everything working like a clock. The hostess, the server, the food, everything. There are just too many other places where customers can spend their money and have a great experience. I would much rather spend $150 on a great dinner than waste $50 on a mediocre one. All in all we spent about $120 at JTH; probably half that was kind of ""meh."" I don't want to slam them with a one star review, as I think that's a bit cruel, but I wish I could make it 2.5 stars. I'm sure they can do much better than what we received.My suggestion would be to hit the oyster room during happy hour for cocktails, appetizers and oysters, then maybe try the restaurant if you are feeling lucky. If not, head to one of the other neighborhood establishments. There are plenty to choose from. We ended up having after-dinner drinks at the Brooklyn Heights Wine Bar which we greatly enjoyed.",3.0
"Came here for Sunday brunch. Bad waitress and that kills the entire experience...Bloody Mary was not impressive either. No drink specials -- $9 for a mimosa and $10 for a classic bloody.

Great cocktails. Okay food. Hated our server. He was obnoxious and and unfriendly. We had Mac and cheese- too many bread crumbs. Steak- nice flavor but over done. Mussels- good flavor and enormous. Carrot cake was great. Seriously wouldn't go back JUST because our server bothered me so much.,3.0
"A wonderful and lovely Brooklyn joint to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon brunch. Two thumbs up for the aptly named ""Krista's Excellent Scones, Biscuit & Jams ($7).

"I came to this place based on a friend's recommendation and I have to say that she didn't disappoint!  I had heard they had an awesome happy hour, so I can't say much about their restaurant as a whole.  Their happy hour though is an easy five stars!I walked in with a friend and there was a small high top table near the bar where we were seated--happy hour is bar seating only.  The place was casual and queit; it's a great place to catch up with friends and not shout over loud background music.  Before introducing himself, the waiter walked over and pointed to my friend and me and named two drinks.  Usually, I would find this a little annoying, but for some reason, it was endearing and I went with his recommendation.  Their happy hour cocktails are $6 and happy hour beers were $4.  Their drink list for happy hour wasn't huge (probably about 6 different drinks), but my friend and I were more than happy with what we had.   The food menu for happy hour is also relatively small, but it includes the famed smoky gouda mac and cheese, which is...wait for it...so gouda.  It is definitely very smoky, but everything about it is perfect--bread crumbs, ample portion...perfect!  We also had the bacalao croquettes with sweet pickle aioli.  These were good, but they weren't as delicious as the mac and cheese.  Still, I was happy we ordered them.Overall, I can't think of anything that I'd change about my experience at Jack the Horse Tavern, and I would easily go back any day for happy hour or even try their full menu!",5.0
"I came here for the Mac & Cheese after it made the Gothamist (and many others) list for best Mac & Cheese in the city.It's definitely on the creamier, decadent side...In the best way possible. You can taste the hint of smokiness provided by the Gouda mixed with the additional richness of the fontina. Tiny bit overboard with the breadcrumbs. I have no complaints per se, but I've just had better. Happy hour was a great deal! Will definitely come back for a drink.",3.0
"My wife and I were in Brooklyn for the last night of our stay in NYC and were very excited to have dinner at Jack the Horse Tavern, plus oysters at the small room next door. We had reservations for 7:30, but ended up hungry and arrived about 5:30 for oysters and found an empty restaurant. We asked the hostess if we might eat some oysters and then bump up our dinner plans, she said no, they were fully booked.We went next door for oysters as planned and figured we'd get enough to hold us for a while, then we could walk around and come back for our 7:30. While enjoying our drinks, the hostess came in and said she could seat us at 6PM but would need the table by 8PM. Fair enough. We aren't dawdlers; we like to eat and enjoy, then move on.The oyster room is compact and very cozy. The service was very prompt, cocktails good, and who can't enjoy a $1 oyster? So far so good.We walked over at 6PM and sat down at a small table on the bench that runs the length of the back wall. Great ambience, really a very nice place located in a very charming section of Brooklyn Heights. (For what it's worth, about half the tables were still empty, although starting to fill, and two remained empty until almost the very end of our meal.)And then the hostess spilled an entire glass of water on my crotch! Okay... I mopped myself off but was soaked through to my underwear and enjoyed the rest of the meal in a very damp state. Did I mention it was December?The waitress was apologetic and, fortunately, I'm not a hot head and decided to let it go, despite my soaking underwear. The funny thing is, the manager, waitress, hostess, no one came over and said ""gosh, so sorry. Can we buy you an appetizer? Can we buy you a cocktail?"" That would have been a well-received gesture but, alas, one that never came.Still, I'm feeling good, I'm with my wife and into my second cocktail, and I try to enjoy myself no matter what.Our ravioli appetizer arrived luke warm. I again let it go and we did enjoy it, cool as it was. My next cocktail arrived, the Hemingway Daiquiri, which was most delicious.Our entrees arrived (still no visit from the manager) in the form of diver sea scallops and a roasted duck breast. Again, not very hot, although they looked well cooked. I wondered if they had been sitting in the window for a while. Both dishes were tasty, although a bit under salted. The duck was good for a few bites until I ran into a thread of gristle or connective tissue that made it inedible. I had to spit a mouthful into my napkin.When the waitress came over I asked her to take it away. I've probably done that twice in my whole life, so that's a biggie. Again, no visit from the manager ""I'm sorry you didn't like the duck, can we get you something else?"" Why not? That's a serious issue.They did take the duck off the tab without me asking. My wife and I headed out the door; the hostess didn't even notice as she noodled on her iPhone. No ""good bye, I hope you enjoyed your meal."" No anything.This is, I think, the first time I've ever reviewed anything on Yelp, and I only took the time because, as a small business owner myself, I would want to know if things were wrong with my business. Most restaurant customers, once disappointed, won't say a word and will, disastrously, never return.This is a charming place in a very charming Brooklyn neighborhood. Unfortunately, we were left disappointed, which was unexpected given the reviews I read before booking. They had all of the pieces of the puzzle and just couldn't quite put them together for us. When you run a $25+ a plate restaurant you need to have everything working like a clock. The hostess, the server, the food, everything. There are just too many other places where customers can spend their money and have a great experience. I would much rather spend $150 on a great dinner than waste $50 on a mediocre one. All in all we spent about $120 at JTH; probably half that was kind of ""meh."" I don't want to slam them with a one star review, as I think that's a bit cruel, but I wish I could make it 2.5 stars. I'm sure they can do much better than what we received.My suggestion would be to hit the oyster room during happy hour for cocktails, appetizers and oysters, then maybe try the restaurant if you are feeling lucky. If not, head to one of the other neighborhood establishments. There are plenty to choose from. We ended up having after-dinner drinks at the Brooklyn Heights Wine Bar which we greatly enjoyed.",3.0
"Came here for Sunday brunch. Bad waitress and that kills the entire experience...Bloody Mary was not impressive either. No drink specials -- $9 for a mimosa and $10 for a classic bloody.

I took a long time to decide what to order as the menu contained so much that I love. I eventually settled for the Eggs Orleans. The juicy Barcat oysters were fried crisply and paired splendidly with the hollandaise, artichokes and poached eggs. It was a nice balance of tart and creamy. Bacon lovers have to order a side of crisp (very) ""Bacon, Bacon, Bacon!!""

"I came to this place based on a friend's recommendation and I have to say that she didn't disappoint!  I had heard they had an awesome happy hour, so I can't say much about their restaurant as a whole.  Their happy hour though is an easy five stars!I walked in with a friend and there was a small high top table near the bar where we were seated--happy hour is bar seating only.  The place was casual and queit; it's a great place to catch up with friends and not shout over loud background music.  Before introducing himself, the waiter walked over and pointed to my friend and me and named two drinks.  Usually, I would find this a little annoying, but for some reason, it was endearing and I went with his recommendation.  Their happy hour cocktails are $6 and happy hour beers were $4.  Their drink list for happy hour wasn't huge (probably about 6 different drinks), but my friend and I were more than happy with what we had.   The food menu for happy hour is also relatively small, but it includes the famed smoky gouda mac and cheese, which is...wait for it...so gouda.  It is definitely very smoky, but everything about it is perfect--bread crumbs, ample portion...perfect!  We also had the bacalao croquettes with sweet pickle aioli.  These were good, but they weren't as delicious as the mac and cheese.  Still, I was happy we ordered them.Overall, I can't think of anything that I'd change about my experience at Jack the Horse Tavern, and I would easily go back any day for happy hour or even try their full menu!",5.0
"I came here for the Mac & Cheese after it made the Gothamist (and many others) list for best Mac & Cheese in the city.It's definitely on the creamier, decadent side...In the best way possible. You can taste the hint of smokiness provided by the Gouda mixed with the additional richness of the fontina. Tiny bit overboard with the breadcrumbs. I have no complaints per se, but I've just had better. Happy hour was a great deal! Will definitely come back for a drink.",3.0
"My wife and I were in Brooklyn for the last night of our stay in NYC and were very excited to have dinner at Jack the Horse Tavern, plus oysters at the small room next door. We had reservations for 7:30, but ended up hungry and arrived about 5:30 for oysters and found an empty restaurant. We asked the hostess if we might eat some oysters and then bump up our dinner plans, she said no, they were fully booked.We went next door for oysters as planned and figured we'd get enough to hold us for a while, then we could walk around and come back for our 7:30. While enjoying our drinks, the hostess came in and said she could seat us at 6PM but would need the table by 8PM. Fair enough. We aren't dawdlers; we like to eat and enjoy, then move on.The oyster room is compact and very cozy. The service was very prompt, cocktails good, and who can't enjoy a $1 oyster? So far so good.We walked over at 6PM and sat down at a small table on the bench that runs the length of the back wall. Great ambience, really a very nice place located in a very charming section of Brooklyn Heights. (For what it's worth, about half the tables were still empty, although starting to fill, and two remained empty until almost the very end of our meal.)And then the hostess spilled an entire glass of water on my crotch! Okay... I mopped myself off but was soaked through to my underwear and enjoyed the rest of the meal in a very damp state. Did I mention it was December?The waitress was apologetic and, fortunately, I'm not a hot head and decided to let it go, despite my soaking underwear. The funny thing is, the manager, waitress, hostess, no one came over and said ""gosh, so sorry. Can we buy you an appetizer? Can we buy you a cocktail?"" That would have been a well-received gesture but, alas, one that never came.Still, I'm feeling good, I'm with my wife and into my second cocktail, and I try to enjoy myself no matter what.Our ravioli appetizer arrived luke warm. I again let it go and we did enjoy it, cool as it was. My next cocktail arrived, the Hemingway Daiquiri, which was most delicious.Our entrees arrived (still no visit from the manager) in the form of diver sea scallops and a roasted duck breast. Again, not very hot, although they looked well cooked. I wondered if they had been sitting in the window for a while. Both dishes were tasty, although a bit under salted. The duck was good for a few bites until I ran into a thread of gristle or connective tissue that made it inedible. I had to spit a mouthful into my napkin.When the waitress came over I asked her to take it away. I've probably done that twice in my whole life, so that's a biggie. Again, no visit from the manager ""I'm sorry you didn't like the duck, can we get you something else?"" Why not? That's a serious issue.They did take the duck off the tab without me asking. My wife and I headed out the door; the hostess didn't even notice as she noodled on her iPhone. No ""good bye, I hope you enjoyed your meal."" No anything.This is, I think, the first time I've ever reviewed anything on Yelp, and I only took the time because, as a small business owner myself, I would want to know if things were wrong with my business. Most restaurant customers, once disappointed, won't say a word and will, disastrously, never return.This is a charming place in a very charming Brooklyn neighborhood. Unfortunately, we were left disappointed, which was unexpected given the reviews I read before booking. They had all of the pieces of the puzzle and just couldn't quite put them together for us. When you run a $25+ a plate restaurant you need to have everything working like a clock. The hostess, the server, the food, everything. There are just too many other places where customers can spend their money and have a great experience. I would much rather spend $150 on a great dinner than waste $50 on a mediocre one. All in all we spent about $120 at JTH; probably half that was kind of ""meh."" I don't want to slam them with a one star review, as I think that's a bit cruel, but I wish I could make it 2.5 stars. I'm sure they can do much better than what we received.My suggestion would be to hit the oyster room during happy hour for cocktails, appetizers and oysters, then maybe try the restaurant if you are feeling lucky. If not, head to one of the other neighborhood establishments. There are plenty to choose from. We ended up having after-dinner drinks at the Brooklyn Heights Wine Bar which we greatly enjoyed.",3.0
"Came here for Sunday brunch. Bad waitress and that kills the entire experience...Bloody Mary was not impressive either. No drink specials -- $9 for a mimosa and $10 for a classic bloody. On a good note, they only use organic eggs. I was hoping to try an omelet but the only come ""standard"". So paying to add a protein was not an option. Wth? I'm PAYING. But anyway, no food for me and I will take my money and appetite elsewhere. Minus the $10 wasted on the Bloody Mary. So -- 2 stars because the hostess was quite pleasant. Very pleased with her energy. She should pass some along to the slow, terrible waitress.",2.0
"Walked in during happy hour. Bar area was crowded. Dining area completely empty. Hostess said the bar was full and to try the room next door (different space, same restaurant).

"The roast chicken is amazing. I can't wait to go back and try it again. It's a very large portion with both a breast and a piece of dark meat. Definitely large enough to share or for a second meal. This place has a nice, cozy atmosphere with a somewhat older crowd for dinner",4.0
This place is a must visit when in Brooklyn Heights. They have great drinks and food. Matt is one of the best bartenders behind the counter. Every one that works at Jack the Horse Tavern is super friendly. Brunch is amazing. Find it on Sundays from 11 to 3 I think. Get the hanger steak and a nice beer.,5.0
"Was pumped to try this place after all the mac and cheese and burger reviews. After a wait at the bar, snagged a table and placed my order only to have the waitress and chef/owner ask us to leave as we had an animal (who by the way is a service animal, 5 lbs and kept in an enclosed bag). They didn't even allow me to explain myself and completely humiliated me.Shame on you!

"I have been to Jack the Horse twice in the last 3 months for dinner, the last time this past Saturday. Both times were pleasant experiences, the first time was an out of the park 5 star experience and my last experience was more of a 3 star, so I am giving them a 4 star average. The first time I went with a group of friends and we shared a lot of sides and starters along with our mains and everything was delicious. The Brussels Sprouts and Cauliflower were both great. The Macaroni & Cheese, Beets and the Grilled Octopus were all great dishes! For my main I had a special of the day, which was Short Ribs and was AMAZING. I also tried a bit of my friends burger which was SLAMMING! This past Saturday I had the Hanger Steak, which I just wanted to be better, the quality and flavor of the meat was just sub-par compared to my last experience and the amazing short ribs.The environment is cozy and borders almost on enchanting, you really could image you are in a tavern from a bygone era, and its location on a charming corner of Brooklyn Heights really helps that feel.",4.0
Great cocktails. Okay food. Hated our server. He was obnoxious and and unfriendly. We had Mac and cheese- too many bread crumbs. Steak- nice flavor but over done. Mussels- good flavor and enormous. Carrot cake was great. Seriously wouldn't go back JUST because our server bothered me so much.,3.0

"I came to this place based on a friend's recommendation and I have to say that she didn't disappoint!  I had heard they had an awesome happy hour, so I can't say much about their restaurant as a whole.  Their happy hour though is an easy five stars!I walked in with a friend and there was a small high top table near the bar where we were seated--happy hour is bar seating only.  The place was casual and queit; it's a great place to catch up with friends and not shout over loud background music.  Before introducing himself, the waiter walked over and pointed to my friend and me and named two drinks.  Usually, I would find this a little annoying, but for some reason, it was endearing and I went with his recommendation.  Their happy hour cocktails are $6 and happy hour beers were $4.  Their drink list for happy hour wasn't huge (probably about 6 different drinks), but my friend and I were more than happy with what we had.   The food menu for happy hour is also relatively small, but it includes the famed smoky gouda mac and cheese, which is...wait for it...so gouda.  It is definitely very smoky, but everything about it is perfect--bread crumbs, ample portion...perfect!  We also had the bacalao croquettes with sweet pickle aioli.  These were good, but they weren't as delicious as the mac and cheese.  Still, I was happy we ordered them.Overall, I can't think of anything that I'd change about my experience at Jack the Horse Tavern, and I would easily go back any day for happy hour or even try their full menu!",5.0
"I came here for the Mac & Cheese after it made the Gothamist (and many others) list for best Mac & Cheese in the city.It's definitely on the creamier, decadent side...In the best way possible. You can taste the hint of smokiness provided by the Gouda mixed with the additional richness of the fontina. Tiny bit overboard with the breadcrumbs. I have no complaints per se, but I've just had better. Happy hour was a great deal! Will definitely come back for a drink.",3.0
"My wife and I were in Brooklyn for the last night of our stay in NYC and were very excited to have dinner at Jack the Horse Tavern, plus oysters at the small room next door. We had reservations for 7:30, but ended up hungry and arrived about 5:30 for oysters and found an empty restaurant. We asked the hostess if we might eat some oysters and then bump up our dinner plans, she said no, they were fully booked.We went next door for oysters as planned and figured we'd get enough to hold us for a while, then we could walk around and come back for our 7:30. While enjoying our drinks, the hostess came in and said she could seat us at 6PM but would need the table by 8PM. Fair enough. We aren't dawdlers; we like to eat and enjoy, then move on.The oyster room is compact and very cozy. The service was very prompt, cocktails good, and who can't enjoy a $1 oyster? So far so good.We walked over at 6PM and sat down at a small table on the bench that runs the length of the back wall. Great ambience, really a very nice place located in a very charming section of Brooklyn Heights. (For what it's worth, about half the tables were still empty, although starting to fill, and two remained empty until almost the very end of our meal.)And then the hostess spilled an entire glass of water on my crotch! Okay... I mopped myself off but was soaked through to my underwear and enjoyed the rest of the meal in a very damp state. Did I mention it was December?The waitress was apologetic and, fortunately, I'm not a hot head and decided to let it go, despite my soaking underwear. The funny thing is, the manager, waitress, hostess, no one came over and said ""gosh, so sorry. Can we buy you an appetizer? Can we buy you a cocktail?"" That would have been a well-received gesture but, alas, one that never came.Still, I'm feeling good, I'm with my wife and into my second cocktail, and I try to enjoy myself no matter what.Our ravioli appetizer arrived luke warm. I again let it go and we did enjoy it, cool as it was. My next cocktail arrived, the Hemingway Daiquiri, which was most delicious.Our entrees arrived (still no visit from the manager) in the form of diver sea scallops and a roasted duck breast. Again, not very hot, although they looked well cooked. I wondered if they had been sitting in the window for a while. Both dishes were tasty, although a bit under salted. The duck was good for a few bites until I ran into a thread of gristle or connective tissue that made it inedible. I had to spit a mouthful into my napkin.When the waitress came over I asked her to take it away. I've probably done that twice in my whole life, so that's a biggie. Again, no visit from the manager ""I'm sorry you didn't like the duck, can we get you something else?"" Why not? That's a serious issue.They did take the duck off the tab without me asking. My wife and I headed out the door; the hostess didn't even notice as she noodled on her iPhone. No ""good bye, I hope you enjoyed your meal."" No anything.This is, I think, the first time I've ever reviewed anything on Yelp, and I only took the time because, as a small business owner myself, I would want to know if things were wrong with my business. Most restaurant customers, once disappointed, won't say a word and will, disastrously, never return.This is a charming place in a very charming Brooklyn neighborhood. Unfortunately, we were left disappointed, which was unexpected given the reviews I read before booking. They had all of the pieces of the puzzle and just couldn't quite put them together for us. When you run a $25+ a plate restaurant you need to have everything working like a clock. The hostess, the server, the food, everything. There are just too many other places where customers can spend their money and have a great experience. I would much rather spend $150 on a great dinner than waste $50 on a mediocre one. All in all we spent about $120 at JTH; probably half that was kind of ""meh."" I don't want to slam them with a one star review, as I think that's a bit cruel, but I wish I could make it 2.5 stars. I'm sure they can do much better than what we received.My suggestion would be to hit the oyster room during happy hour for cocktails, appetizers and oysters, then maybe try the restaurant if you are feeling lucky. If not, head to one of the other neighborhood establishments. There are plenty to choose from. We ended up having after-dinner drinks at the Brooklyn Heights Wine Bar which we greatly enjoyed.",3.0

"I have been to Jack the Horse twice in the last 3 months for dinner, the last time this past Saturday. Both times were pleasant experiences, the first time was an out of the park 5 star experience and my last experience was more of a 3 star, so I am giving them a 4 star average. The first time I went with a group of friends and we shared a lot of sides and starters along with our mains and everything was delicious. The Brussels Sprouts and Cauliflower were both great. The Macaroni & Cheese, Beets and the Grilled Octopus were all great dishes! For my main I had a special of the day, which was Short Ribs and was AMAZING. I also tried a bit of my friends burger which was SLAMMING! This past Saturday I had the Hanger Steak, which I just wanted to be better, the quality and flavor of the meat was just sub-par compared to my last experience and the amazing short ribs.The environment is cozy and borders almost on enchanting, you really could image you are in a tavern from a bygone era, and its location on a charming corner of Brooklyn Heights really helps that feel.",4.0
Great cocktails. Okay food. Hated our server. He was obnoxious and and unfriendly. We had Mac and cheese- too many bread crumbs. Steak- nice flavor but over done. Mussels- good flavor and enormous. Carrot cake was great. Seriously wouldn't go back JUST because our server bothered me so much.,3.0

"I came to this place based on a friend's recommendation and I have to say that she didn't disappoint!  I had heard they had an awesome happy hour, so I can't say much about their restaurant as a whole.  Their happy hour though is an easy five stars!I walked in with a friend and there was a small high top table near the bar where we were seated--happy hour is bar seating only.  The place was casual and queit; it's a great place to catch up with friends and not shout over loud background music.  Before introducing himself, the waiter walked over and pointed to my friend and me and named two drinks.  Usually, I would find this a little annoying, but for some reason, it was endearing and I went with his recommendation.  Their happy hour cocktails are $6 and happy hour beers were $4.  Their drink list for happy hour wasn't huge (probably about 6 different drinks), but my friend and I were more than happy with what we had.   The food menu for happy hour is also relatively small, but it includes the famed smoky gouda mac and cheese, which is...wait for it...so gouda.  It is definitely very smoky, but everything about it is perfect--bread crumbs, ample portion...perfect!  We also had the bacalao croquettes with sweet pickle aioli.  These were good, but they weren't as delicious as the mac and cheese.  Still, I was happy we ordered them.Overall, I can't think of anything that I'd change about my experience at Jack the Horse Tavern, and I would easily go back any day for happy hour or even try their full menu!",5.0
"I came here for the Mac & Cheese after it made the Gothamist (and many others) list for best Mac & Cheese in the city.It's definitely on the creamier, decadent side...In the best way possible. You can taste the hint of smokiness provided by the Gouda mixed with the additional richness of the fontina. Tiny bit overboard with the breadcrumbs. I have no complaints per se, but I've just had better. Happy hour was a great deal! Will definitely come back for a drink.",3.0
"My wife and I were in Brooklyn for the last night of our stay in NYC and were very excited to have dinner at Jack the Horse Tavern, plus oysters at the small room next door. We had reservations for 7:30, but ended up hungry and arrived about 5:30 for oysters and found an empty restaurant. We asked the hostess if we might eat some oysters and then bump up our dinner plans, she said no, they were fully booked.We went next door for oysters as planned and figured we'd get enough to hold us for a while, then we could walk around and come back for our 7:30. While enjoying our drinks, the hostess came in and said she could seat us at 6PM but would need the table by 8PM. Fair enough. We aren't dawdlers; we like to eat and enjoy, then move on.The oyster room is compact and very cozy. The service was very prompt, cocktails good, and who can't enjoy a $1 oyster? So far so good.We walked over at 6PM and sat down at a small table on the bench that runs the length of the back wall. Great ambience, really a very nice place located in a very charming section of Brooklyn Heights. (For what it's worth, about half the tables were still empty, although starting to fill, and two remained empty until almost the very end of our meal.)And then the hostess spilled an entire glass of water on my crotch! Okay... I mopped myself off but was soaked through to my underwear and enjoyed the rest of the meal in a very damp state. Did I mention it was December?The waitress was apologetic and, fortunately, I'm not a hot head and decided to let it go, despite my soaking underwear. The funny thing is, the manager, waitress, hostess, no one came over and said ""gosh, so sorry. Can we buy you an appetizer? Can we buy you a cocktail?"" That would have been a well-received gesture but, alas, one that never came.Still, I'm feeling good, I'm with my wife and into my second cocktail, and I try to enjoy myself no matter what.Our ravioli appetizer arrived luke warm. I again let it go and we did enjoy it, cool as it was. My next cocktail arrived, the Hemingway Daiquiri, which was most delicious.Our entrees arrived (still no visit from the manager) in the form of diver sea scallops and a roasted duck breast. Again, not very hot, although they looked well cooked. I wondered if they had been sitting in the window for a while. Both dishes were tasty, although a bit under salted. The duck was good for a few bites until I ran into a thread of gristle or connective tissue that made it inedible. I had to spit a mouthful into my napkin.When the waitress came over I asked her to take it away. I've probably done that twice in my whole life, so that's a biggie. Again, no visit from the manager ""I'm sorry you didn't like the duck, can we get you something else?"" Why not? That's a serious issue.They did take the duck off the tab without me asking. My wife and I headed out the door; the hostess didn't even notice as she noodled on her iPhone. No ""good bye, I hope you enjoyed your meal."" No anything.This is, I think, the first time I've ever reviewed anything on Yelp, and I only took the time because, as a small business owner myself, I would want to know if things were wrong with my business. Most restaurant customers, once disappointed, won't say a word and will, disastrously, never return.This is a charming place in a very charming Brooklyn neighborhood. Unfortunately, we were left disappointed, which was unexpected given the reviews I read before booking. They had all of the pieces of the puzzle and just couldn't quite put them together for us. When you run a $25+ a plate restaurant you need to have everything working like a clock. The hostess, the server, the food, everything. There are just too many other places where customers can spend their money and have a great experience. I would much rather spend $150 on a great dinner than waste $50 on a mediocre one. All in all we spent about $120 at JTH; probably half that was kind of ""meh."" I don't want to slam them with a one star review, as I think that's a bit cruel, but I wish I could make it 2.5 stars. I'm sure they can do much better than what we received.My suggestion would be to hit the oyster room during happy hour for cocktails, appetizers and oysters, then maybe try the restaurant if you are feeling lucky. If not, head to one of the other neighborhood establishments. There are plenty to choose from. We ended up having after-dinner drinks at the Brooklyn Heights Wine Bar which we greatly enjoyed.",3.0

"I have been to Jack the Horse twice in the last 3 months for dinner, the last time this past Saturday. Both times were pleasant experiences, the first time was an out of the park 5 star experience and my last experience was more of a 3 star, so I am giving them a 4 star average. The first time I went with a group of friends and we shared a lot of sides and starters along with our mains and everything was delicious. The Brussels Sprouts and Cauliflower were both great. The Macaroni & Cheese, Beets and the Grilled Octopus were all great dishes! For my main I had a special of the day, which was Short Ribs and was AMAZING. I also tried a bit of my friends burger which was SLAMMING! This past Saturday I had the Hanger Steak, which I just wanted to be better, the quality and flavor of the meat was just sub-par compared to my last experience and the amazing short ribs.The environment is cozy and borders almost on enchanting, you really could image you are in a tavern from a bygone era, and its location on a charming corner of Brooklyn Heights really helps that feel.",4.0
Great cocktails. Okay food. Hated our server. He was obnoxious and and unfriendly. We had Mac and cheese- too many bread crumbs. Steak- nice flavor but over done. Mussels- good flavor and enormous. Carrot cake was great. Seriously wouldn't go back JUST because our server bothered me so much.,3.0

"I came to this place based on a friend's recommendation and I have to say that she didn't disappoint!  I had heard they had an awesome happy hour, so I can't say much about their restaurant as a whole.  Their happy hour though is an easy five stars!I walked in with a friend and there was a small high top table near the bar where we were seated--happy hour is bar seating only.  The place was casual and queit; it's a great place to catch up with friends and not shout over loud background music.  Before introducing himself, the waiter walked over and pointed to my friend and me and named two drinks.  Usually, I would find this a little annoying, but for some reason, it was endearing and I went with his recommendation.  Their happy hour cocktails are $6 and happy hour beers were $4.  Their drink list for happy hour wasn't huge (probably about 6 different drinks), but my friend and I were more than happy with what we had.   The food menu for happy hour is also relatively small, but it includes the famed smoky gouda mac and cheese, which is...wait for it...so gouda.  It is definitely very smoky, but everything about it is perfect--bread crumbs, ample portion...perfect!  We also had the bacalao croquettes with sweet pickle aioli.  These were good, but they weren't as delicious as the mac and cheese.  Still, I was happy we ordered them.Overall, I can't think of anything that I'd change about my experience at Jack the Horse Tavern, and I would easily go back any day for happy hour or even try their full menu!",5.0
"I came here for the Mac & Cheese after it made the Gothamist (and many others) list for best Mac & Cheese in the city.It's definitely on the creamier, decadent side...In the best way possible. You can taste the hint of smokiness provided by the Gouda mixed with the additional richness of the fontina. Tiny bit overboard with the breadcrumbs. I have no complaints per se, but I've just had better. Happy hour was a great deal! Will definitely come back for a drink.",3.0
"My wife and I were in Brooklyn for the last night of our stay in NYC and were very excited to have dinner at Jack the Horse Tavern, plus oysters at the small room next door. We had reservations for 7:30, but ended up hungry and arrived about 5:30 for oysters and found an empty restaurant. We asked the hostess if we might eat some oysters and then bump up our dinner plans, she said no, they were fully booked.We went next door for oysters as planned and figured we'd get enough to hold us for a while, then we could walk around and come back for our 7:30. While enjoying our drinks, the hostess came in and said she could seat us at 6PM but would need the table by 8PM. Fair enough. We aren't dawdlers; we like to eat and enjoy, then move on.The oyster room is compact and very cozy. The service was very prompt, cocktails good, and who can't enjoy a $1 oyster? So far so good.We walked over at 6PM and sat down at a small table on the bench that runs the length of the back wall. Great ambience, really a very nice place located in a very charming section of Brooklyn Heights. (For what it's worth, about half the tables were still empty, although starting to fill, and two remained empty until almost the very end of our meal.)And then the hostess spilled an entire glass of water on my crotch! Okay... I mopped myself off but was soaked through to my underwear and enjoyed the rest of the meal in a very damp state. Did I mention it was December?The waitress was apologetic and, fortunately, I'm not a hot head and decided to let it go, despite my soaking underwear. The funny thing is, the manager, waitress, hostess, no one came over and said ""gosh, so sorry. Can we buy you an appetizer? Can we buy you a cocktail?"" That would have been a well-received gesture but, alas, one that never came.Still, I'm feeling good, I'm with my wife and into my second cocktail, and I try to enjoy myself no matter what.Our ravioli appetizer arrived luke warm. I again let it go and we did enjoy it, cool as it was. My next cocktail arrived, the Hemingway Daiquiri, which was most delicious.Our entrees arrived (still no visit from the manager) in the form of diver sea scallops and a roasted duck breast. Again, not very hot, although they looked well cooked. I wondered if they had been sitting in the window for a while. Both dishes were tasty, although a bit under salted. The duck was good for a few bites until I ran into a thread of gristle or connective tissue that made it inedible. I had to spit a mouthful into my napkin.When the waitress came over I asked her to take it away. I've probably done that twice in my whole life, so that's a biggie. Again, no visit from the manager ""I'm sorry you didn't like the duck, can we get you something else?"" Why not? That's a serious issue.They did take the duck off the tab without me asking. My wife and I headed out the door; the hostess didn't even notice as she noodled on her iPhone. No ""good bye, I hope you enjoyed your meal."" No anything.This is, I think, the first time I've ever reviewed anything on Yelp, and I only took the time because, as a small business owner myself, I would want to know if things were wrong with my business. Most restaurant customers, once disappointed, won't say a word and will, disastrously, never return.This is a charming place in a very charming Brooklyn neighborhood. Unfortunately, we were left disappointed, which was unexpected given the reviews I read before booking. They had all of the pieces of the puzzle and just couldn't quite put them together for us. When you run a $25+ a plate restaurant you need to have everything working like a clock. The hostess, the server, the food, everything. There are just too many other places where customers can spend their money and have a great experience. I would much rather spend $150 on a great dinner than waste $50 on a mediocre one. All in all we spent about $120 at JTH; probably half that was kind of ""meh."" I don't want to slam them with a one star review, as I think that's a bit cruel, but I wish I could make it 2.5 stars. I'm sure they can do much better than what we received.My suggestion would be to hit the oyster room during happy hour for cocktails, appetizers and oysters, then maybe try the restaurant if you are feeling lucky. If not, head to one of the other neighborhood establishments. There are plenty to choose from. We ended up having after-dinner drinks at the Brooklyn Heights Wine Bar which we greatly enjoyed.",3.0

"I have been to Jack the Horse twice in the last 3 months for dinner, the last time this past Saturday. Both times were pleasant experiences, the first time was an out of the park 5 star experience and my last experience was more of a 3 star, so I am giving them a 4 star average. The first time I went with a group of friends and we shared a lot of sides and starters along with our mains and everything was delicious. The Brussels Sprouts and Cauliflower were both great. The Macaroni & Cheese, Beets and the Grilled Octopus were all great dishes! For my main I had a special of the day, which was Short Ribs and was AMAZING. I also tried a bit of my friends burger which was SLAMMING! This past Saturday I had the Hanger Steak, which I just wanted to be better, the quality and flavor of the meat was just sub-par compared to my last experience and the amazing short ribs.The environment is cozy and borders almost on enchanting, you really could image you are in a tavern from a bygone era, and its location on a charming corner of Brooklyn Heights really helps that feel.",4.0
Great cocktails. Okay food. Hated our server. He was obnoxious and and unfriendly. We had Mac and cheese- too many bread crumbs. Steak- nice flavor but over done. Mussels- good flavor and enormous. Carrot cake was great. Seriously wouldn't go back JUST because our server bothered me so much.,3.0

"I came to this place based on a friend's recommendation and I have to say that she didn't disappoint!  I had heard they had an awesome happy hour, so I can't say much about their restaurant as a whole.  Their happy hour though is an easy five stars!I walked in with a friend and there was a small high top table near the bar where we were seated--happy hour is bar seating only.  The place was casual and queit; it's a great place to catch up with friends and not shout over loud background music.  Before introducing himself, the waiter walked over and pointed to my friend and me and named two drinks.  Usually, I would find this a little annoying, but for some reason, it was endearing and I went with his recommendation.  Their happy hour cocktails are $6 and happy hour beers were $4.  Their drink list for happy hour wasn't huge (probably about 6 different drinks), but my friend and I were more than happy with what we had.   The food menu for happy hour is also relatively small, but it includes the famed smoky gouda mac and cheese, which is...wait for it...so gouda.  It is definitely very smoky, but everything about it is perfect--bread crumbs, ample portion...perfect!  We also had the bacalao croquettes with sweet pickle aioli.  These were good, but they weren't as delicious as the mac and cheese.  Still, I was happy we ordered them.Overall, I can't think of anything that I'd change about my experience at Jack the Horse Tavern, and I would easily go back any day for happy hour or even try their full menu!",5.0
"I came here for the Mac & Cheese after it made the Gothamist (and many others) list for best Mac & Cheese in the city.It's definitely on the creamier, decadent side...In the best way possible. You can taste the hint of smokiness provided by the Gouda mixed with the additional richness of the fontina. Tiny bit overboard with the breadcrumbs. I have no complaints per se, but I've just had better. Happy hour was a great deal! Will definitely come back for a drink.",3.0
"My wife and I were in Brooklyn for the last night of our stay in NYC and were very excited to have dinner at Jack the Horse Tavern, plus oysters at the small room next door. We had reservations for 7:30, but ended up hungry and arrived about 5:30 for oysters and found an empty restaurant. We asked the hostess if we might eat some oysters and then bump up our dinner plans, she said no, they were fully booked.We went next door for oysters as planned and figured we'd get enough to hold us for a while, then we could walk around and come back for our 7:30. While enjoying our drinks, the hostess came in and said she could seat us at 6PM but would need the table by 8PM. Fair enough. We aren't dawdlers; we like to eat and enjoy, then move on.The oyster room is compact and very cozy. The service was very prompt, cocktails good, and who can't enjoy a $1 oyster? So far so good.We walked over at 6PM and sat down at a small table on the bench that runs the length of the back wall. Great ambience, really a very nice place located in a very charming section of Brooklyn Heights. (For what it's worth, about half the tables were still empty, although starting to fill, and two remained empty until almost the very end of our meal.)And then the hostess spilled an entire glass of water on my crotch! Okay... I mopped myself off but was soaked through to my underwear and enjoyed the rest of the meal in a very damp state. Did I mention it was December?The waitress was apologetic and, fortunately, I'm not a hot head and decided to let it go, despite my soaking underwear. The funny thing is, the manager, waitress, hostess, no one came over and said ""gosh, so sorry. Can we buy you an appetizer? Can we buy you a cocktail?"" That would have been a well-received gesture but, alas, one that never came.Still, I'm feeling good, I'm with my wife and into my second cocktail, and I try to enjoy myself no matter what.Our ravioli appetizer arrived luke warm. I again let it go and we did enjoy it, cool as it was. My next cocktail arrived, the Hemingway Daiquiri, which was most delicious.Our entrees arrived (still no visit from the manager) in the form of diver sea scallops and a roasted duck breast. Again, not very hot, although they looked well cooked. I wondered if they had been sitting in the window for a while. Both dishes were tasty, although a bit under salted. The duck was good for a few bites until I ran into a thread of gristle or connective tissue that made it inedible. I had to spit a mouthful into my napkin.When the waitress came over I asked her to take it away. I've probably done that twice in my whole life, so that's a biggie. Again, no visit from the manager ""I'm sorry you didn't like the duck, can we get you something else?"" Why not? That's a serious issue.They did take the duck off the tab without me asking. My wife and I headed out the door; the hostess didn't even notice as she noodled on her iPhone. No ""good bye, I hope you enjoyed your meal."" No anything.This is, I think, the first time I've ever reviewed anything on Yelp, and I only took the time because, as a small business owner myself, I would want to know if things were wrong with my business. Most restaurant customers, once disappointed, won't say a word and will, disastrously, never return.This is a charming place in a very charming Brooklyn neighborhood. Unfortunately, we were left disappointed, which was unexpected given the reviews I read before booking. They had all of the pieces of the puzzle and just couldn't quite put them together for us. When you run a $25+ a plate restaurant you need to have everything working like a clock. The hostess, the server, the food, everything. There are just too many other places where customers can spend their money and have a great experience. I would much rather spend $150 on a great dinner than waste $50 on a mediocre one. All in all we spent about $120 at JTH; probably half that was kind of ""meh."" I don't want to slam them with a one star review, as I think that's a bit cruel, but I wish I could make it 2.5 stars. I'm sure they can do much better than what we received.My suggestion would be to hit the oyster room during happy hour for cocktails, appetizers and oysters, then maybe try the restaurant if you are feeling lucky. If not, head to one of the other neighborhood establishments. There are plenty to choose from. We ended up having after-dinner drinks at the Brooklyn Heights Wine Bar which we greatly enjoyed.",3.0

"I have been to Jack the Horse twice in the last 3 months for dinner, the last time this past Saturday. Both times were pleasant experiences, the first time was an out of the park 5 star experience and my last experience was more of a 3 star, so I am giving them a 4 star average. The first time I went with a group of friends and we shared a lot of sides and starters along with our mains and everything was delicious. The Brussels Sprouts and Cauliflower were both great. The Macaroni & Cheese, Beets and the Grilled Octopus were all great dishes! For my main I had a special of the day, which was Short Ribs and was AMAZING. I also tried a bit of my friends burger which was SLAMMING! This past Saturday I had the Hanger Steak, which I just wanted to be better, the quality and flavor of the meat was just sub-par compared to my last experience and the amazing short ribs.The environment is cozy and borders almost on enchanting, you really could image you are in a tavern from a bygone era, and its location on a charming corner of Brooklyn Heights really helps that feel.",4.0
Great cocktails. Okay food. Hated our server. He was obnoxious and and unfriendly. We had Mac and cheese- too many bread crumbs. Steak- nice flavor but over done. Mussels- good flavor and enormous. Carrot cake was great. Seriously wouldn't go back JUST because our server bothered me so much.,3.0

"I came to this place based on a friend's recommendation and I have to say that she didn't disappoint!  I had heard they had an awesome happy hour, so I can't say much about their restaurant as a whole.  Their happy hour though is an easy five stars!I walked in with a friend and there was a small high top table near the bar where we were seated--happy hour is bar seating only.  The place was casual and queit; it's a great place to catch up with friends and not shout over loud background music.  Before introducing himself, the waiter walked over and pointed to my friend and me and named two drinks.  Usually, I would find this a little annoying, but for some reason, it was endearing and I went with his recommendation.  Their happy hour cocktails are $6 and happy hour beers were $4.  Their drink list for happy hour wasn't huge (probably about 6 different drinks), but my friend and I were more than happy with what we had.   The food menu for happy hour is also relatively small, but it includes the famed smoky gouda mac and cheese, which is...wait for it...so gouda.  It is definitely very smoky, but everything about it is perfect--bread crumbs, ample portion...perfect!  We also had the bacalao croquettes with sweet pickle aioli.  These were good, but they weren't as delicious as the mac and cheese.  Still, I was happy we ordered them.Overall, I can't think of anything that I'd change about my experience at Jack the Horse Tavern, and I would easily go back any day for happy hour or even try their full menu!",5.0
"I came here for the Mac & Cheese after it made the Gothamist (and many others) list for best Mac & Cheese in the city.It's definitely on the creamier, decadent side...In the best way possible. You can taste the hint of smokiness provided by the Gouda mixed with the additional richness of the fontina. Tiny bit overboard with the breadcrumbs. I have no complaints per se, but I've just had better. Happy hour was a great deal! Will definitely come back for a drink.",3.0
"My wife and I were in Brooklyn for the last night of our stay in NYC and were very excited to have dinner at Jack the Horse Tavern, plus oysters at the small room next door. We had reservations for 7:30, but ended up hungry and arrived about 5:30 for oysters and found an empty restaurant. We asked the hostess if we might eat some oysters and then bump up our dinner plans, she said no, they were fully booked.We went next door for oysters as planned and figured we'd get enough to hold us for a while, then we could walk around and come back for our 7:30. While enjoying our drinks, the hostess came in and said she could seat us at 6PM but would need the table by 8PM. Fair enough. We aren't dawdlers; we like to eat and enjoy, then move on.The oyster room is compact and very cozy. The service was very prompt, cocktails good, and who can't enjoy a $1 oyster? So far so good.We walked over at 6PM and sat down at a small table on the bench that runs the length of the back wall. Great ambience, really a very nice place located in a very charming section of Brooklyn Heights. (For what it's worth, about half the tables were still empty, although starting to fill, and two remained empty until almost the very end of our meal.)And then the hostess spilled an entire glass of water on my crotch! Okay... I mopped myself off but was soaked through to my underwear and enjoyed the rest of the meal in a very damp state. Did I mention it was December?The waitress was apologetic and, fortunately, I'm not a hot head and decided to let it go, despite my soaking underwear. The funny thing is, the manager, waitress, hostess, no one came over and said ""gosh, so sorry. Can we buy you an appetizer? Can we buy you a cocktail?"" That would have been a well-received gesture but, alas, one that never came.Still, I'm feeling good, I'm with my wife and into my second cocktail, and I try to enjoy myself no matter what.Our ravioli appetizer arrived luke warm. I again let it go and we did enjoy it, cool as it was. My next cocktail arrived, the Hemingway Daiquiri, which was most delicious.Our entrees arrived (still no visit from the manager) in the form of diver sea scallops and a roasted duck breast. Again, not very hot, although they looked well cooked. I wondered if they had been sitting in the window for a while. Both dishes were tasty, although a bit under salted. The duck was good for a few bites until I ran into a thread of gristle or connective tissue that made it inedible. I had to spit a mouthful into my napkin.When the waitress came over I asked her to take it away. I've probably done that twice in my whole life, so that's a biggie. Again, no visit from the manager ""I'm sorry you didn't like the duck, can we get you something else?"" Why not? That's a serious issue.They did take the duck off the tab without me asking. My wife and I headed out the door; the hostess didn't even notice as she noodled on her iPhone. No ""good bye, I hope you enjoyed your meal."" No anything.This is, I think, the first time I've ever reviewed anything on Yelp, and I only took the time because, as a small business owner myself, I would want to know if things were wrong with my business. Most restaurant customers, once disappointed, won't say a word and will, disastrously, never return.This is a charming place in a very charming Brooklyn neighborhood. Unfortunately, we were left disappointed, which was unexpected given the reviews I read before booking. They had all of the pieces of the puzzle and just couldn't quite put them together for us. When you run a $25+ a plate restaurant you need to have everything working like a clock. The hostess, the server, the food, everything. There are just too many other places where customers can spend their money and have a great experience. I would much rather spend $150 on a great dinner than waste $50 on a mediocre one. All in all we spent about $120 at JTH; probably half that was kind of ""meh."" I don't want to slam them with a one star review, as I think that's a bit cruel, but I wish I could make it 2.5 stars. I'm sure they can do much better than what we received.My suggestion would be to hit the oyster room during happy hour for cocktails, appetizers and oysters, then maybe try the restaurant if you are feeling lucky. If not, head to one of the other neighborhood establishments. There are plenty to choose from. We ended up having after-dinner drinks at the Brooklyn Heights Wine Bar which we greatly enjoyed.",3.0

"I have been to Jack the Horse twice in the last 3 months for dinner, the last time this past Saturday. Both times were pleasant experiences, the first time was an out of the park 5 star experience and my last experience was more of a 3 star, so I am giving them a 4 star average. The first time I went with a group of friends and we shared a lot of sides and starters along with our mains and everything was delicious. The Brussels Sprouts and Cauliflower were both great. The Macaroni & Cheese, Beets and the Grilled Octopus were all great dishes! For my main I had a special of the day, which was Short Ribs and was AMAZING. I also tried a bit of my friends burger which was SLAMMING! This past Saturday I had the Hanger Steak, which I just wanted to be better, the quality and flavor of the meat was just sub-par compared to my last experience and the amazing short ribs.The environment is cozy and borders almost on enchanting, you really could image you are in a tavern from a bygone era, and its location on a charming corner of Brooklyn Heights really helps that feel.",4.0
Great cocktails. Okay food. Hated our server. He was obnoxious and and unfriendly. We had Mac and cheese- too many bread crumbs. Steak- nice flavor but over done. Mussels- good flavor and enormous. Carrot cake was great. Seriously wouldn't go back JUST because our server bothered me so much.,3.0

"I came to this place based on a friend's recommendation and I have to say that she didn't disappoint!  I had heard they had an awesome happy hour, so I can't say much about their restaurant as a whole.  Their happy hour though is an easy five stars!I walked in with a friend and there was a small high top table near the bar where we were seated--happy hour is bar seating only.  The place was casual and queit; it's a great place to catch up with friends and not shout over loud background music.  Before introducing himself, the waiter walked over and pointed to my friend and me and named two drinks.  Usually, I would find this a little annoying, but for some reason, it was endearing and I went with his recommendation.  Their happy hour cocktails are $6 and happy hour beers were $4.  Their drink list for happy hour wasn't huge (probably about 6 different drinks), but my friend and I were more than happy with what we had.   The food menu for happy hour is also relatively small, but it includes the famed smoky gouda mac and cheese, which is...wait for it...so gouda.  It is definitely very smoky, but everything about it is perfect--bread crumbs, ample portion...perfect!  We also had the bacalao croquettes with sweet pickle aioli.  These were good, but they weren't as delicious as the mac and cheese.  Still, I was happy we ordered them.Overall, I can't think of anything that I'd change about my experience at Jack the Horse Tavern, and I would easily go back any day for happy hour or even try their full menu!",5.0
"I came here for the Mac & Cheese after it made the Gothamist (and many others) list for best Mac & Cheese in the city.It's definitely on the creamier, decadent side...In the best way possible. You can taste the hint of smokiness provided by the Gouda mixed with the additional richness of the fontina. Tiny bit overboard with the breadcrumbs. I have no complaints per se, but I've just had better. Happy hour was a great deal! Will definitely come back for a drink.",3.0
"My wife and I were in Brooklyn for the last night of our stay in NYC and were very excited to have dinner at Jack the Horse Tavern, plus oysters at the small room next door. We had reservations for 7:30, but ended up hungry and arrived about 5:30 for oysters and found an empty restaurant. We asked the hostess if we might eat some oysters and then bump up our dinner plans, she said no, they were fully booked.We went next door for oysters as planned and figured we'd get enough to hold us for a while, then we could walk around and come back for our 7:30. While enjoying our drinks, the hostess came in and said she could seat us at 6PM but would need the table by 8PM. Fair enough. We aren't dawdlers; we like to eat and enjoy, then move on.The oyster room is compact and very cozy. The service was very prompt, cocktails good, and who can't enjoy a $1 oyster? So far so good.We walked over at 6PM and sat down at a small table on the bench that runs the length of the back wall. Great ambience, really a very nice place located in a very charming section of Brooklyn Heights. (For what it's worth, about half the tables were still empty, although starting to fill, and two remained empty until almost the very end of our meal.)And then the hostess spilled an entire glass of water on my crotch! Okay... I mopped myself off but was soaked through to my underwear and enjoyed the rest of the meal in a very damp state. Did I mention it was December?The waitress was apologetic and, fortunately, I'm not a hot head and decided to let it go, despite my soaking underwear. The funny thing is, the manager, waitress, hostess, no one came over and said ""gosh, so sorry. Can we buy you an appetizer? Can we buy you a cocktail?"" That would have been a well-received gesture but, alas, one that never came.Still, I'm feeling good, I'm with my wife and into my second cocktail, and I try to enjoy myself no matter what.Our ravioli appetizer arrived luke warm. I again let it go and we did enjoy it, cool as it was. My next cocktail arrived, the Hemingway Daiquiri, which was most delicious.Our entrees arrived (still no visit from the manager) in the form of diver sea scallops and a roasted duck breast. Again, not very hot, although they looked well cooked. I wondered if they had been sitting in the window for a while. Both dishes were tasty, although a bit under salted. The duck was good for a few bites until I ran into a thread of gristle or connective tissue that made it inedible. I had to spit a mouthful into my napkin.When the waitress came over I asked her to take it away. I've probably done that twice in my whole life, so that's a biggie. Again, no visit from the manager ""I'm sorry you didn't like the duck, can we get you something else?"" Why not? That's a serious issue.They did take the duck off the tab without me asking. My wife and I headed out the door; the hostess didn't even notice as she noodled on her iPhone. No ""good bye, I hope you enjoyed your meal."" No anything.This is, I think, the first time I've ever reviewed anything on Yelp, and I only took the time because, as a small business owner myself, I would want to know if things were wrong with my business. Most restaurant customers, once disappointed, won't say a word and will, disastrously, never return.This is a charming place in a very charming Brooklyn neighborhood. Unfortunately, we were left disappointed, which was unexpected given the reviews I read before booking. They had all of the pieces of the puzzle and just couldn't quite put them together for us. When you run a $25+ a plate restaurant you need to have everything working like a clock. The hostess, the server, the food, everything. There are just too many other places where customers can spend their money and have a great experience. I would much rather spend $150 on a great dinner than waste $50 on a mediocre one. All in all we spent about $120 at JTH; probably half that was kind of ""meh."" I don't want to slam them with a one star review, as I think that's a bit cruel, but I wish I could make it 2.5 stars. I'm sure they can do much better than what we received.My suggestion would be to hit the oyster room during happy hour for cocktails, appetizers and oysters, then maybe try the restaurant if you are feeling lucky. If not, head to one of the other neighborhood establishments. There are plenty to choose from. We ended up having after-dinner drinks at the Brooklyn Heights Wine Bar which we greatly enjoyed.",3.0

"I have been to Jack the Horse twice in the last 3 months for dinner, the last time this past Saturday. Both times were pleasant experiences, the first time was an out of the park 5 star experience and my last experience was more of a 3 star, so I am giving them a 4 star average. The first time I went with a group of friends and we shared a lot of sides and starters along with our mains and everything was delicious. The Brussels Sprouts and Cauliflower were both great. The Macaroni & Cheese, Beets and the Grilled Octopus were all great dishes! For my main I had a special of the day, which was Short Ribs and was AMAZING. I also tried a bit of my friends burger which was SLAMMING! This past Saturday I had the Hanger Steak, which I just wanted to be better, the quality and flavor of the meat was just sub-par compared to my last experience and the amazing short ribs.The environment is cozy and borders almost on enchanting, you really could image you are in a tavern from a bygone era, and its location on a charming corner of Brooklyn Heights really helps that feel.",4.0
Great cocktails. Okay food. Hated our server. He was obnoxious and and unfriendly. We had Mac and cheese- too many bread crumbs. Steak- nice flavor but over done. Mussels- good flavor and enormous. Carrot cake was great. Seriously wouldn't go back JUST because our server bothered me so much.,3.0

"I came to this place based on a friend's recommendation and I have to say that she didn't disappoint!  I had heard they had an awesome happy hour, so I can't say much about their restaurant as a whole.  Their happy hour though is an easy five stars!I walked in with a friend and there was a small high top table near the bar where we were seated--happy hour is bar seating only.  The place was casual and queit; it's a great place to catch up with friends and not shout over loud background music.  Before introducing himself, the waiter walked over and pointed to my friend and me and named two drinks.  Usually, I would find this a little annoying, but for some reason, it was endearing and I went with his recommendation.  Their happy hour cocktails are $6 and happy hour beers were $4.  Their drink list for happy hour wasn't huge (probably about 6 different drinks), but my friend and I were more than happy with what we had.   The food menu for happy hour is also relatively small, but it includes the famed smoky gouda mac and cheese, which is...wait for it...so gouda.  It is definitely very smoky, but everything about it is perfect--bread crumbs, ample portion...perfect!  We also had the bacalao croquettes with sweet pickle aioli.  These were good, but they weren't as delicious as the mac and cheese.  Still, I was happy we ordered them.Overall, I can't think of anything that I'd change about my experience at Jack the Horse Tavern, and I would easily go back any day for happy hour or even try their full menu!",5.0
"I came here for the Mac & Cheese after it made the Gothamist (and many others) list for best Mac & Cheese in the city.It's definitely on the creamier, decadent side...In the best way possible. You can taste the hint of smokiness provided by the Gouda mixed with the additional richness of the fontina. Tiny bit overboard with the breadcrumbs. I have no complaints per se, but I've just had better. Happy hour was a great deal! Will definitely come back for a drink.",3.0
"My wife and I were in Brooklyn for the last night of our stay in NYC and were very excited to have dinner at Jack the Horse Tavern, plus oysters at the small room next door. We had reservations for 7:30, but ended up hungry and arrived about 5:30 for oysters and found an empty restaurant. We asked the hostess if we might eat some oysters and then bump up our dinner plans, she said no, they were fully booked.We went next door for oysters as planned and figured we'd get enough to hold us for a while, then we could walk around and come back for our 7:30. While enjoying our drinks, the hostess came in and said she could seat us at 6PM but would need the table by 8PM. Fair enough. We aren't dawdlers; we like to eat and enjoy, then move on.The oyster room is compact and very cozy. The service was very prompt, cocktails good, and who can't enjoy a $1 oyster? So far so good.We walked over at 6PM and sat down at a small table on the bench that runs the length of the back wall. Great ambience, really a very nice place located in a very charming section of Brooklyn Heights. (For what it's worth, about half the tables were still empty, although starting to fill, and two remained empty until almost the very end of our meal.)And then the hostess spilled an entire glass of water on my crotch! Okay... I mopped myself off but was soaked through to my underwear and enjoyed the rest of the meal in a very damp state. Did I mention it was December?The waitress was apologetic and, fortunately, I'm not a hot head and decided to let it go, despite my soaking underwear. The funny thing is, the manager, waitress, hostess, no one came over and said ""gosh, so sorry. Can we buy you an appetizer? Can we buy you a cocktail?"" That would have been a well-received gesture but, alas, one that never came.Still, I'm feeling good, I'm with my wife and into my second cocktail, and I try to enjoy myself no matter what.Our ravioli appetizer arrived luke warm. I again let it go and we did enjoy it, cool as it was. My next cocktail arrived, the Hemingway Daiquiri, which was most delicious.Our entrees arrived (still no visit from the manager) in the form of diver sea scallops and a roasted duck breast. Again, not very hot, although they looked well cooked. I wondered if they had been sitting in the window for a while. Both dishes were tasty, although a bit under salted. The duck was good for a few bites until I ran into a thread of gristle or connective tissue that made it inedible. I had to spit a mouthful into my napkin.When the waitress came over I asked her to take it away. I've probably done that twice in my whole life, so that's a biggie. Again, no visit from the manager ""I'm sorry you didn't like the duck, can we get you something else?"" Why not? That's a serious issue.They did take the duck off the tab without me asking. My wife and I headed out the door; the hostess didn't even notice as she noodled on her iPhone. No ""good bye, I hope you enjoyed your meal."" No anything.This is, I think, the first time I've ever reviewed anything on Yelp, and I only took the time because, as a small business owner myself, I would want to know if things were wrong with my business. Most restaurant customers, once disappointed, won't say a word and will, disastrously, never return.This is a charming place in a very charming Brooklyn neighborhood. Unfortunately, we were left disappointed, which was unexpected given the reviews I read before booking. They had all of the pieces of the puzzle and just couldn't quite put them together for us. When you run a $25+ a plate restaurant you need to have everything working like a clock. The hostess, the server, the food, everything. There are just too many other places where customers can spend their money and have a great experience. I would much rather spend $150 on a great dinner than waste $50 on a mediocre one. All in all we spent about $120 at JTH; probably half that was kind of ""meh."" I don't want to slam them with a one star review, as I think that's a bit cruel, but I wish I could make it 2.5 stars. I'm sure they can do much better than what we received.My suggestion would be to hit the oyster room during happy hour for cocktails, appetizers and oysters, then maybe try the restaurant if you are feeling lucky. If not, head to one of the other neighborhood establishments. There are plenty to choose from. We ended up having after-dinner drinks at the Brooklyn Heights Wine Bar which we greatly enjoyed.",3.0

"I have been to Jack the Horse twice in the last 3 months for dinner, the last time this past Saturday. Both times were pleasant experiences, the first time was an out of the park 5 star experience and my last experience was more of a 3 star, so I am giving them a 4 star average. The first time I went with a group of friends and we shared a lot of sides and starters along with our mains and everything was delicious. The Brussels Sprouts and Cauliflower were both great. The Macaroni & Cheese, Beets and the Grilled Octopus were all great dishes! For my main I had a special of the day, which was Short Ribs and was AMAZING. I also tried a bit of my friends burger which was SLAMMING! This past Saturday I had the Hanger Steak, which I just wanted to be better, the quality and flavor of the meat was just sub-par compared to my last experience and the amazing short ribs.The environment is cozy and borders almost on enchanting, you really could image you are in a tavern from a bygone era, and its location on a charming corner of Brooklyn Heights really helps that feel.",4.0
Great cocktails. Okay food. Hated our server. He was obnoxious and and unfriendly. We had Mac and cheese- too many bread crumbs. Steak- nice flavor but over done. Mussels- good flavor and enormous. Carrot cake was great. Seriously wouldn't go back JUST because our server bothered me so much.,3.0

"I came to this place based on a friend's recommendation and I have to say that she didn't disappoint!  I had heard they had an awesome happy hour, so I can't say much about their restaurant as a whole.  Their happy hour though is an easy five stars!I walked in with a friend and there was a small high top table near the bar where we were seated--happy hour is bar seating only.  The place was casual and queit; it's a great place to catch up with friends and not shout over loud background music.  Before introducing himself, the waiter walked over and pointed to my friend and me and named two drinks.  Usually, I would find this a little annoying, but for some reason, it was endearing and I went with his recommendation.  Their happy hour cocktails are $6 and happy hour beers were $4.  Their drink list for happy hour wasn't huge (probably about 6 different drinks), but my friend and I were more than happy with what we had.   The food menu for happy hour is also relatively small, but it includes the famed smoky gouda mac and cheese, which is...wait for it...so gouda.  It is definitely very smoky, but everything about it is perfect--bread crumbs, ample portion...perfect!  We also had the bacalao croquettes with sweet pickle aioli.  These were good, but they weren't as delicious as the mac and cheese.  Still, I was happy we ordered them.Overall, I can't think of anything that I'd change about my experience at Jack the Horse Tavern, and I would easily go back any day for happy hour or even try their full menu!",5.0
"I came here for the Mac & Cheese after it made the Gothamist (and many others) list for best Mac & Cheese in the city.It's definitely on the creamier, decadent side...In the best way possible. You can taste the hint of smokiness provided by the Gouda mixed with the additional richness of the fontina. Tiny bit overboard with the breadcrumbs. I have no complaints per se, but I've just had better. Happy hour was a great deal! Will definitely come back for a drink.",3.0
"My wife and I were in Brooklyn for the last night of our stay in NYC and were very excited to have dinner at Jack the Horse Tavern, plus oysters at the small room next door. We had reservations for 7:30, but ended up hungry and arrived about 5:30 for oysters and found an empty restaurant. We asked the hostess if we might eat some oysters and then bump up our dinner plans, she said no, they were fully booked.We went next door for oysters as planned and figured we'd get enough to hold us for a while, then we could walk around and come back for our 7:30. While enjoying our drinks, the hostess came in and said she could seat us at 6PM but would need the table by 8PM. Fair enough. We aren't dawdlers; we like to eat and enjoy, then move on.The oyster room is compact and very cozy. The service was very prompt, cocktails good, and who can't enjoy a $1 oyster? So far so good.We walked over at 6PM and sat down at a small table on the bench that runs the length of the back wall. Great ambience, really a very nice place located in a very charming section of Brooklyn Heights. (For what it's worth, about half the tables were still empty, although starting to fill, and two remained empty until almost the very end of our meal.)And then the hostess spilled an entire glass of water on my crotch! Okay... I mopped myself off but was soaked through to my underwear and enjoyed the rest of the meal in a very damp state. Did I mention it was December?The waitress was apologetic and, fortunately, I'm not a hot head and decided to let it go, despite my soaking underwear. The funny thing is, the manager, waitress, hostess, no one came over and said ""gosh, so sorry. Can we buy you an appetizer? Can we buy you a cocktail?"" That would have been a well-received gesture but, alas, one that never came.Still, I'm feeling good, I'm with my wife and into my second cocktail, and I try to enjoy myself no matter what.Our ravioli appetizer arrived luke warm. I again let it go and we did enjoy it, cool as it was. My next cocktail arrived, the Hemingway Daiquiri, which was most delicious.Our entrees arrived (still no visit from the manager) in the form of diver sea scallops and a roasted duck breast. Again, not very hot, although they looked well cooked. I wondered if they had been sitting in the window for a while. Both dishes were tasty, although a bit under salted. The duck was good for a few bites until I ran into a thread of gristle or connective tissue that made it inedible. I had to spit a mouthful into my napkin.When the waitress came over I asked her to take it away. I've probably done that twice in my whole life, so that's a biggie. Again, no visit from the manager ""I'm sorry you didn't like the duck, can we get you something else?"" Why not? That's a serious issue.They did take the duck off the tab without me asking. My wife and I headed out the door; the hostess didn't even notice as she noodled on her iPhone. No ""good bye, I hope you enjoyed your meal."" No anything.This is, I think, the first time I've ever reviewed anything on Yelp, and I only took the time because, as a small business owner myself, I would want to know if things were wrong with my business. Most restaurant customers, once disappointed, won't say a word and will, disastrously, never return.This is a charming place in a very charming Brooklyn neighborhood. Unfortunately, we were left disappointed, which was unexpected given the reviews I read before booking. They had all of the pieces of the puzzle and just couldn't quite put them together for us. When you run a $25+ a plate restaurant you need to have everything working like a clock. The hostess, the server, the food, everything. There are just too many other places where customers can spend their money and have a great experience. I would much rather spend $150 on a great dinner than waste $50 on a mediocre one. All in all we spent about $120 at JTH; probably half that was kind of ""meh."" I don't want to slam them with a one star review, as I think that's a bit cruel, but I wish I could make it 2.5 stars. I'm sure they can do much better than what we received.My suggestion would be to hit the oyster room during happy hour for cocktails, appetizers and oysters, then maybe try the restaurant if you are feeling lucky. If not, head to one of the other neighborhood establishments. There are plenty to choose from. We ended up having after-dinner drinks at the Brooklyn Heights Wine Bar which we greatly enjoyed.",3.0

"I have been to Jack the Horse twice in the last 3 months for dinner, the last time this past Saturday. Both times were pleasant experiences, the first time was an out of the park 5 star experience and my last experience was more of a 3 star, so I am giving them a 4 star average. The first time I went with a group of friends and we shared a lot of sides and starters along with our mains and everything was delicious. The Brussels Sprouts and Cauliflower were both great. The Macaroni & Cheese, Beets and the Grilled Octopus were all great dishes! For my main I had a special of the day, which was Short Ribs and was AMAZING. I also tried a bit of my friends burger which was SLAMMING! This past Saturday I had the Hanger Steak, which I just wanted to be better, the quality and flavor of the meat was just sub-par compared to my last experience and the amazing short ribs.The environment is cozy and borders almost on enchanting, you really could image you are in a tavern from a bygone era, and its location on a charming corner of Brooklyn Heights really helps that feel.",4.0
Great cocktails. Okay food. Hated our server. He was obnoxious and and unfriendly. We had Mac and cheese- too many bread crumbs. Steak- nice flavor but over done. Mussels- good flavor and enormous. Carrot cake was great. Seriously wouldn't go back JUST because our server bothered me so much.,3.0

"I came to this place based on a friend's recommendation and I have to say that she didn't disappoint!  I had heard they had an awesome happy hour, so I can't say much about their restaurant as a whole.  Their happy hour though is an easy five stars!I walked in with a friend and there was a small high top table near the bar where we were seated--happy hour is bar seating only.  The place was casual and queit; it's a great place to catch up with friends and not shout over loud background music.  Before introducing himself, the waiter walked over and pointed to my friend and me and named two drinks.  Usually, I would find this a little annoying, but for some reason, it was endearing and I went with his recommendation.  Their happy hour cocktails are $6 and happy hour beers were $4.  Their drink list for happy hour wasn't huge (probably about 6 different drinks), but my friend and I were more than happy with what we had.   The food menu for happy hour is also relatively small, but it includes the famed smoky gouda mac and cheese, which is...wait for it...so gouda.  It is definitely very smoky, but everything about it is perfect--bread crumbs, ample portion...perfect!  We also had the bacalao croquettes with sweet pickle aioli.  These were good, but they weren't as delicious as the mac and cheese.  Still, I was happy we ordered them.Overall, I can't think of anything that I'd change about my experience at Jack the Horse Tavern, and I would easily go back any day for happy hour or even try their full menu!",5.0
"I came here for the Mac & Cheese after it made the Gothamist (and many others) list for best Mac & Cheese in the city.It's definitely on the creamier, decadent side...In the best way possible. You can taste the hint of smokiness provided by the Gouda mixed with the additional richness of the fontina. Tiny bit overboard with the breadcrumbs. I have no complaints per se, but I've just had better. Happy hour was a great deal! Will definitely come back for a drink.",3.0
"My wife and I were in Brooklyn for the last night of our stay in NYC and were very excited to have dinner at Jack the Horse Tavern, plus oysters at the small room next door. We had reservations for 7:30, but ended up hungry and arrived about 5:30 for oysters and found an empty restaurant. We asked the hostess if we might eat some oysters and then bump up our dinner plans, she said no, they were fully booked.We went next door for oysters as planned and figured we'd get enough to hold us for a while, then we could walk around and come back for our 7:30. While enjoying our drinks, the hostess came in and said she could seat us at 6PM but would need the table by 8PM. Fair enough. We aren't dawdlers; we like to eat and enjoy, then move on.The oyster room is compact and very cozy. The service was very prompt, cocktails good, and who can't enjoy a $1 oyster? So far so good.We walked over at 6PM and sat down at a small table on the bench that runs the length of the back wall. Great ambience, really a very nice place located in a very charming section of Brooklyn Heights. (For what it's worth, about half the tables were still empty, although starting to fill, and two remained empty until almost the very end of our meal.)And then the hostess spilled an entire glass of water on my crotch! Okay... I mopped myself off but was soaked through to my underwear and enjoyed the rest of the meal in a very damp state. Did I mention it was December?The waitress was apologetic and, fortunately, I'm not a hot head and decided to let it go, despite my soaking underwear. The funny thing is, the manager, waitress, hostess, no one came over and said ""gosh, so sorry. Can we buy you an appetizer? Can we buy you a cocktail?"" That would have been a well-received gesture but, alas, one that never came.Still, I'm feeling good, I'm with my wife and into my second cocktail, and I try to enjoy myself no matter what.Our ravioli appetizer arrived luke warm. I again let it go and we did enjoy it, cool as it was. My next cocktail arrived, the Hemingway Daiquiri, which was most delicious.Our entrees arrived (still no visit from the manager) in the form of diver sea scallops and a roasted duck breast. Again, not very hot, although they looked well cooked. I wondered if they had been sitting in the window for a while. Both dishes were tasty, although a bit under salted. The duck was good for a few bites until I ran into a thread of gristle or connective tissue that made it inedible. I had to spit a mouthful into my napkin.When the waitress came over I asked her to take it away. I've probably done that twice in my whole life, so that's a biggie. Again, no visit from the manager ""I'm sorry you didn't like the duck, can we get you something else?"" Why not? That's a serious issue.They did take the duck off the tab without me asking. My wife and I headed out the door; the hostess didn't even notice as she noodled on her iPhone. No ""good bye, I hope you enjoyed your meal."" No anything.This is, I think, the first time I've ever reviewed anything on Yelp, and I only took the time because, as a small business owner myself, I would want to know if things were wrong with my business. Most restaurant customers, once disappointed, won't say a word and will, disastrously, never return.This is a charming place in a very charming Brooklyn neighborhood. Unfortunately, we were left disappointed, which was unexpected given the reviews I read before booking. They had all of the pieces of the puzzle and just couldn't quite put them together for us. When you run a $25+ a plate restaurant you need to have everything working like a clock. The hostess, the server, the food, everything. There are just too many other places where customers can spend their money and have a great experience. I would much rather spend $150 on a great dinner than waste $50 on a mediocre one. All in all we spent about $120 at JTH; probably half that was kind of ""meh."" I don't want to slam them with a one star review, as I think that's a bit cruel, but I wish I could make it 2.5 stars. I'm sure they can do much better than what we received.My suggestion would be to hit the oyster room during happy hour for cocktails, appetizers and oysters, then maybe try the restaurant if you are feeling lucky. If not, head to one of the other neighborhood establishments. There are plenty to choose from. We ended up having after-dinner drinks at the Brooklyn Heights Wine Bar which we greatly enjoyed.",3.0

"I have been to Jack the Horse twice in the last 3 months for dinner, the last time this past Saturday. Both times were pleasant experiences, the first time was an out of the park 5 star experience and my last experience was more of a 3 star, so I am giving them a 4 star average. The first time I went with a group of friends and we shared a lot of sides and starters along with our mains and everything was delicious. The Brussels Sprouts and Cauliflower were both great. The Macaroni & Cheese, Beets and the Grilled Octopus were all great dishes! For my main I had a special of the day, which was Short Ribs and was AMAZING. I also tried a bit of my friends burger which was SLAMMING! This past Saturday I had the Hanger Steak, which I just wanted to be better, the quality and flavor of the meat was just sub-par compared to my last experience and the amazing short ribs.The environment is cozy and borders almost on enchanting, you really could image you are in a tavern from a bygone era, and its location on a charming corner of Brooklyn Heights really helps that feel.",4.0
Great cocktails. Okay food. Hated our server. He was obnoxious and and unfriendly. We had Mac and cheese- too many bread crumbs. Steak- nice flavor but over done. Mussels- good flavor and enormous. Carrot cake was great. Seriously wouldn't go back JUST because our server bothered me so much.,3.0

"I came to this place based on a friend's recommendation and I have to say that she didn't disappoint!  I had heard they had an awesome happy hour, so I can't say much about their restaurant as a whole.  Their happy hour though is an easy five stars!I walked in with a friend and there was a small high top table near the bar where we were seated--happy hour is bar seating only.  The place was casual and queit; it's a great place to catch up with friends and not shout over loud background music.  Before introducing himself, the waiter walked over and pointed to my friend and me and named two drinks.  Usually, I would find this a little annoying, but for some reason, it was endearing and I went with his recommendation.  Their happy hour cocktails are $6 and happy hour beers were $4.  Their drink list for happy hour wasn't huge (probably about 6 different drinks), but my friend and I were more than happy with what we had.   The food menu for happy hour is also relatively small, but it includes the famed smoky gouda mac and cheese, which is...wait for it...so gouda.  It is definitely very smoky, but everything about it is perfect--bread crumbs, ample portion...perfect!  We also had the bacalao croquettes with sweet pickle aioli.  These were good, but they weren't as delicious as the mac and cheese.  Still, I was happy we ordered them.Overall, I can't think of anything that I'd change about my experience at Jack the Horse Tavern, and I would easily go back any day for happy hour or even try their full menu!",5.0
"I came here for the Mac & Cheese after it made the Gothamist (and many others) list for best Mac & Cheese in the city.It's definitely on the creamier, decadent side...In the best way possible. You can taste the hint of smokiness provided by the Gouda mixed with the additional richness of the fontina. Tiny bit overboard with the breadcrumbs. I have no complaints per se, but I've just had better. Happy hour was a great deal! Will definitely come back for a drink.",3.0
"My wife and I were in Brooklyn for the last night of our stay in NYC and were very excited to have dinner at Jack the Horse Tavern, plus oysters at the small room next door. We had reservations for 7:30, but ended up hungry and arrived about 5:30 for oysters and found an empty restaurant. We asked the hostess if we might eat some oysters and then bump up our dinner plans, she said no, they were fully booked.We went next door for oysters as planned and figured we'd get enough to hold us for a while, then we could walk around and come back for our 7:30. While enjoying our drinks, the hostess came in and said she could seat us at 6PM but would need the table by 8PM. Fair enough. We aren't dawdlers; we like to eat and enjoy, then move on.The oyster room is compact and very cozy. The service was very prompt, cocktails good, and who can't enjoy a $1 oyster? So far so good.We walked over at 6PM and sat down at a small table on the bench that runs the length of the back wall. Great ambience, really a very nice place located in a very charming section of Brooklyn Heights. (For what it's worth, about half the tables were still empty, although starting to fill, and two remained empty until almost the very end of our meal.)And then the hostess spilled an entire glass of water on my crotch! Okay... I mopped myself off but was soaked through to my underwear and enjoyed the rest of the meal in a very damp state. Did I mention it was December?The waitress was apologetic and, fortunately, I'm not a hot head and decided to let it go, despite my soaking underwear. The funny thing is, the manager, waitress, hostess, no one came over and said ""gosh, so sorry. Can we buy you an appetizer? Can we buy you a cocktail?"" That would have been a well-received gesture but, alas, one that never came.Still, I'm feeling good, I'm with my wife and into my second cocktail, and I try to enjoy myself no matter what.Our ravioli appetizer arrived luke warm. I again let it go and we did enjoy it, cool as it was. My next cocktail arrived, the Hemingway Daiquiri, which was most delicious.Our entrees arrived (still no visit from the manager) in the form of diver sea scallops and a roasted duck breast. Again, not very hot, although they looked well cooked. I wondered if they had been sitting in the window for a while. Both dishes were tasty, although a bit under salted. The duck was good for a few bites until I ran into a thread of gristle or connective tissue that made it inedible. I had to spit a mouthful into my napkin.When the waitress came over I asked her to take it away. I've probably done that twice in my whole life, so that's a biggie. Again, no visit from the manager ""I'm sorry you didn't like the duck, can we get you something else?"" Why not? That's a serious issue.They did take the duck off the tab without me asking. My wife and I headed out the door; the hostess didn't even notice as she noodled on her iPhone. No ""good bye, I hope you enjoyed your meal."" No anything.This is, I think, the first time I've ever reviewed anything on Yelp, and I only took the time because, as a small business owner myself, I would want to know if things were wrong with my business. Most restaurant customers, once disappointed, won't say a word and will, disastrously, never return.This is a charming place in a very charming Brooklyn neighborhood. Unfortunately, we were left disappointed, which was unexpected given the reviews I read before booking. They had all of the pieces of the puzzle and just couldn't quite put them together for us. When you run a $25+ a plate restaurant you need to have everything working like a clock. The hostess, the server, the food, everything. There are just too many other places where customers can spend their money and have a great experience. I would much rather spend $150 on a great dinner than waste $50 on a mediocre one. All in all we spent about $120 at JTH; probably half that was kind of ""meh."" I don't want to slam them with a one star review, as I think that's a bit cruel, but I wish I could make it 2.5 stars. I'm sure they can do much better than what we received.My suggestion would be to hit the oyster room during happy hour for cocktails, appetizers and oysters, then maybe try the restaurant if you are feeling lucky. If not, head to one of the other neighborhood establishments. There are plenty to choose from. We ended up having after-dinner drinks at the Brooklyn Heights Wine Bar which we greatly enjoyed.",3.0

"I have been to Jack the Horse twice in the last 3 months for dinner, the last time this past Saturday. Both times were pleasant experiences, the first time was an out of the park 5 star experience and my last experience was more of a 3 star, so I am giving them a 4 star average. The first time I went with a group of friends and we shared a lot of sides and starters along with our mains and everything was delicious. The Brussels Sprouts and Cauliflower were both great. The Macaroni & Cheese, Beets and the Grilled Octopus were all great dishes! For my main I had a special of the day, which was Short Ribs and was AMAZING. I also tried a bit of my friends burger which was SLAMMING! This past Saturday I had the Hanger Steak, which I just wanted to be better, the quality and flavor of the meat was just sub-par compared to my last experience and the amazing short ribs.The environment is cozy and borders almost on enchanting, you really could image you are in a tavern from a bygone era, and its location on a charming corner of Brooklyn Heights really helps that feel.",4.0
Great cocktails. Okay food. Hated our server. He was obnoxious and and unfriendly. We had Mac and cheese- too many bread crumbs. Steak- nice flavor but over done. Mussels- good flavor and enormous. Carrot cake was great. Seriously wouldn't go back JUST because our server bothered me so much.,3.0

"I came to this place based on a friend's recommendation and I have to say that she didn't disappoint!  I had heard they had an awesome happy hour, so I can't say much about their restaurant as a whole.  Their happy hour though is an easy five stars!I walked in with a friend and there was a small high top table near the bar where we were seated--happy hour is bar seating only.  The place was casual and queit; it's a great place to catch up with friends and not shout over loud background music.  Before introducing himself, the waiter walked over and pointed to my friend and me and named two drinks.  Usually, I would find this a little annoying, but for some reason, it was endearing and I went with his recommendation.  Their happy hour cocktails are $6 and happy hour beers were $4.  Their drink list for happy hour wasn't huge (probably about 6 different drinks), but my friend and I were more than happy with what we had.   The food menu for happy hour is also relatively small, but it includes the famed smoky gouda mac and cheese, which is...wait for it...so gouda.  It is definitely very smoky, but everything about it is perfect--bread crumbs, ample portion...perfect!  We also had the bacalao croquettes with sweet pickle aioli.  These were good, but they weren't as delicious as the mac and cheese.  Still, I was happy we ordered them.Overall, I can't think of anything that I'd change about my experience at Jack the Horse Tavern, and I would easily go back any day for happy hour or even try their full menu!",5.0
"I came here for the Mac & Cheese after it made the Gothamist (and many others) list for best Mac & Cheese in the city.It's definitely on the creamier, decadent side...In the best way possible. You can taste the hint of smokiness provided by the Gouda mixed with the additional richness of the fontina. Tiny bit overboard with the breadcrumbs. I have no complaints per se, but I've just had better. Happy hour was a great deal! Will definitely come back for a drink.",3.0
"My wife and I were in Brooklyn for the last night of our stay in NYC and were very excited to have dinner at Jack the Horse Tavern, plus oysters at the small room next door. We had reservations for 7:30, but ended up hungry and arrived about 5:30 for oysters and found an empty restaurant. We asked the hostess if we might eat some oysters and then bump up our dinner plans, she said no, they were fully booked.We went next door for oysters as planned and figured we'd get enough to hold us for a while, then we could walk around and come back for our 7:30. While enjoying our drinks, the hostess came in and said she could seat us at 6PM but would need the table by 8PM. Fair enough. We aren't dawdlers; we like to eat and enjoy, then move on.The oyster room is compact and very cozy. The service was very prompt, cocktails good, and who can't enjoy a $1 oyster? So far so good.We walked over at 6PM and sat down at a small table on the bench that runs the length of the back wall. Great ambience, really a very nice place located in a very charming section of Brooklyn Heights. (For what it's worth, about half the tables were still empty, although starting to fill, and two remained empty until almost the very end of our meal.)And then the hostess spilled an entire glass of water on my crotch! Okay... I mopped myself off but was soaked through to my underwear and enjoyed the rest of the meal in a very damp state. Did I mention it was December?The waitress was apologetic and, fortunately, I'm not a hot head and decided to let it go, despite my soaking underwear. The funny thing is, the manager, waitress, hostess, no one came over and said ""gosh, so sorry. Can we buy you an appetizer? Can we buy you a cocktail?"" That would have been a well-received gesture but, alas, one that never came.Still, I'm feeling good, I'm with my wife and into my second cocktail, and I try to enjoy myself no matter what.Our ravioli appetizer arrived luke warm. I again let it go and we did enjoy it, cool as it was. My next cocktail arrived, the Hemingway Daiquiri, which was most delicious.Our entrees arrived (still no visit from the manager) in the form of diver sea scallops and a roasted duck breast. Again, not very hot, although they looked well cooked. I wondered if they had been sitting in the window for a while. Both dishes were tasty, although a bit under salted. The duck was good for a few bites until I ran into a thread of gristle or connective tissue that made it inedible. I had to spit a mouthful into my napkin.When the waitress came over I asked her to take it away. I've probably done that twice in my whole life, so that's a biggie. Again, no visit from the manager ""I'm sorry you didn't like the duck, can we get you something else?"" Why not? That's a serious issue.They did take the duck off the tab without me asking. My wife and I headed out the door; the hostess didn't even notice as she noodled on her iPhone. No ""good bye, I hope you enjoyed your meal."" No anything.This is, I think, the first time I've ever reviewed anything on Yelp, and I only took the time because, as a small business owner myself, I would want to know if things were wrong with my business. Most restaurant customers, once disappointed, won't say a word and will, disastrously, never return.This is a charming place in a very charming Brooklyn neighborhood. Unfortunately, we were left disappointed, which was unexpected given the reviews I read before booking. They had all of the pieces of the puzzle and just couldn't quite put them together for us. When you run a $25+ a plate restaurant you need to have everything working like a clock. The hostess, the server, the food, everything. There are just too many other places where customers can spend their money and have a great experience. I would much rather spend $150 on a great dinner than waste $50 on a mediocre one. All in all we spent about $120 at JTH; probably half that was kind of ""meh."" I don't want to slam them with a one star review, as I think that's a bit cruel, but I wish I could make it 2.5 stars. I'm sure they can do much better than what we received.My suggestion would be to hit the oyster room during happy hour for cocktails, appetizers and oysters, then maybe try the restaurant if you are feeling lucky. If not, head to one of the other neighborhood establishments. There are plenty to choose from. We ended up having after-dinner drinks at the Brooklyn Heights Wine Bar which we greatly enjoyed.",3.0
"Came here for Sunday brunch. Bad waitress and that kills the entire experience...Bloody Mary was not impressive either. No drink specials -- $9 for a mimosa and $10 for a classic bloody. On a good note, they only use organic eggs. I was hoping to try an omelet but the only come ""standard"". So paying to add a protein was not an option. Wth? I'm PAYING. But anyway, no food for me and I will take my money and appetite elsewhere. Minus the $10 wasted on the Bloody Mary. So -- 2 stars because the hostess was quite pleasant. Very pleased with her energy. She should pass some along to the slow, terrible waitress.",2.0
"Walked in during happy hour. Bar area was crowded. Dining area completely empty. Hostess said the bar was full and to try the room next door (different space, same restaurant). I went elsewhere.Unsure why you'd turn down business while the dining area remained empty. Accommodate your customers.",1.0
"The roast chicken is amazing. I can't wait to go back and try it again. It's a very large portion with both a breast and a piece of dark meat. Definitely large enough to share or for a second meal. This place has a nice, cozy atmosphere with a somewhat older crowd for dinner",4.0
This place is a must visit when in Brooklyn Heights. They have great drinks and food. Matt is one of the best bartenders behind the counter. Every one that works at Jack the Horse Tavern is super friendly. Brunch is amazing. Find it on Sundays from 11 to 3 I think. Get the hanger steak and a nice beer.,5.0
"Was pumped to try this place after all the mac and cheese and burger reviews. After a wait at the bar, snagged a table and placed my order only to have the waitress and chef/owner ask us to leave as we had an animal (who by the way is a service animal, 5 lbs and kept in an enclosed bag). They didn't even allow me to explain myself and completely humiliated me.Shame on you! Will be following up to ensure the proper steps are taken as the chef/owner loudly mentioned it was a health code violation when it's an even bigger violation to not allow someone who has a service animal to eat at your establishment.",1.0
"Five stars for the food.Two stars for the service.Great food, though cold.Have been to this restaurant several times so was very surprised at the poor service from the time it took to order to the time it took to get the food and not getting drinks that were ordered.",4.0
"We have been to this place at least 8 times in 3 years (we live in the neighborhood), and used to like it a lot - but in our opinion it has gone downhill... the last two visits have been mediocre to low quality.  We don't understand why.  My wife ordered the short rib - whatever they served was not a short rib, we know what a short rib looks like and tastes like and this wasn't it- and it was burnt and tough.  We also got the hangar steak - which was overly-seasoned with something (soy sauce or teriyaki, don't know) and didn't taste fresh.  No refills on water and no bread basket brought to the table.  The other dish (roasted chicken) was good and my drink was good.  For these prices, this shouldn't happen.  We are considering not going back due to this.",2.0
"My friend Jim introduced me to the flank steak here, and I've never looked back!  Scrumptious!  While I haven't tried anything else on the menu, my dining companions have, and they have thoroughly enjoyed fish dishes, etc. The appetizers and entres are creative and reasonably priced. Arrive a couple minutes early and treat yourself to a creative cocktail designed by the talented bartenders.",4.0

"This review is for dinner (can't wait to try brunch - stay tuned for an updated review):This Michellin-star rated tiny gem feels like it's waiting to be discovered.  Nestled in the quieter hills of Brooklyn Heights, near the promenade but not on a main drag, JtH Tavern still feels like a find (even though they've been discovered and featured and celebrated).  The service is superb - waitstaff offer great recommendations based on your likes and yearnings.  And just when I was about to say, ""the food is taking a long time"", our dishes came to our table and were worth every single minute spent waiting.  Be patient, have some wine, and you will be thoroughly rewarded.  Prices are reasonable, $19-$25 for an entree.  And the ambiance is inviting - come with friends or bring a date, you will enjoy your experience.I ordered the pork chop (tender and flavorful) with broccoli rabe and bacon, my friend ordered the steak with roasted potatoes - we never even spoke to each other once the dishes arrived!  I kind of wish I had remembered to ask to try his dish.  Can't wait to come back for my favorite meal of day - Brunch...",5.0
"The duck was amazing. The cocktails superb. The chocolate mousse dessert is the best dessert we've had in years - and one of us is a NYC chef. Please change the music line up. We are frequent patrons and love you, but the 70s overload with the music is dated and boring.",5.0
"This place is great! Here for dinner on a summer Saturday night w family and just so good. Service excellent and waitress (Maria) perfect. Beet salad and Angus hangar steak for me and a couple of glasses of Chardonnay. Standard operating procedure for me. This is just such a great spot in the Heights too, just a couple of blocks off the promenade, maybe come here after a little evening walk and view of the bridge and the city skyline.",5.0
