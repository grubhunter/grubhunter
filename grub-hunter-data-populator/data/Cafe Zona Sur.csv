"Wonderful!!  This place is amazing! Really, really great food at decent prices --and a lovely atmosphere. The Hanger Steak, the  Sammy Steak and the Salmon are always there and always perfect. They sometimes have baby artichokes that I just adore.Was there last night and had for the first time their Creme Brûlée, it was unforgettably  fantastic.",5.0
"In the few years this place has been open, the prices have gone up exorbitantly. The mac & cheese used to be $10, it's now $16; all of the sandwiches have gone up by $2 (around a 20% increase); a watery, foamy, generic hot chocolate will run you almost $5. For the inconsistent service and quality (we once waited over an hour for our food, which came out incorrect anyway, with only a minor apology to show for it) , I'd rather spend my money elsewhere.",2.0
"Came here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch with my boyfriend. We arrived around 1pm and the cafe was not crowded. I knew they had a backyard so I requested to sit in the backyard but they were hosting a birthday party there so I didnt get to (bummers, it was so beautiful out). I ordered the Zona Sur Grande ($12) which came with two pancakes with fresh fruits,  two eggs any style of your choice, bacon or sausages and home fries. Everything was pretty much just normal; nothing was burnt (phew), eggs over easy as requested, home fries were crispy and soft and pancakes were just your typical pancakes.  I also ordered the red sangria ($7)  The sangria was really good, it had the bitterness of wine but the sweetness and tartness of the fruits. My boyfriend ordered the Steak Sammy ($14) which had grilled hanger steak, gruyere cheese, caramelized onions, arugula and horseradish mayo on ciabatta bread with a side of fries. The sandwich was pretty good, oh so cheesy and very juicy. The fries were my favorite though, perfectly crispy and seasoned.All in all, I had a pretty normal experience, nothing too extraordinary. But if you're in the area and want something else besides tacos and fast food, this is the place to go to!",4.0
"I've been here twice. The food is good. But I can't support this place.Cafe Zona Sur might as well be called Conquistador Cafe because it's the epitome of a certain grotesque brand of gentrification. The name of the restaurant is the most Spanish thing about it. The waitstaff wears plaid Urban Outfitter looking flannels. The cafe has a bicycle logo. Contrived, corny.Take a walk outside Cafe Zona Sur and it's all working class people and Mexican families, none of which will ever patronize Cafe Zona Sur. Reviewers rave about the ""great vibe."" They've been hoodwinked by a specific type of hipster millennial business model. The predominant vibe here is urban narcissist. Tacos El Bronco is a few doors down. Go there. Overtip.",1.0

"I had reviewed this previously, but wanted to update.During the week, with the right weather, the outdoor is comfortable and quiet.Nice Latin music plays in the background.Couple all that with a very broad and diverse brunch menu and I'm a happy camper.My caprese sandwich, with tomato, fresh mozzarella and rosemary infused foccacia bread, made for a delightful morning.  Other selections, leave this a nice menu compared with other more expensive restaurants with limited brunch or breakfast menus during the week.Worth it.",5.0

"It's humid and hot. We made a reservation very much in advance, but apparently our booth was given to another party an hour earlier but was not told there was a big party coming in. We had to sit outside in the heat with no breeze because there were to many umbrellas covering the top and the fences were high.The food was good, not exceptional but good. The reason why the review is so low was because it was so hot that no one enjoyed their food. The toddler in our group was dropping sweat, no one was happy. It would have been better if we were sitting inside, but unfortunately it wasn't broth to our attention that we could move inside when now seats freed up.",2.0

I love coming here for breakfast, I've tried the huevos rancheros which comes with eggs, black beans, avocado and one layer of tortilla underneath.  When I first saw it I honestly wasn't impressed and was feeling disappointed, but all the flavor put together hit the spot and I was happy and full at the end of my meal.  The fluffy pancakes were also very delicious! I also enjoy their french fries it is packed with just the right amount of flavor and crunch.  I do have to say that I didn't like their iced latte, although the coffee is good and I will surely stop by here to get me a nice cup of caffeine fix.  Last but not the least, the tiramisu needs to be mentioned and praised.  It is simply a taste of sweet paradise.  Cafe Zona Sur I will be back for more!",4.0

"What a cute little place.  I went here for dinner by myself and felt very comfortable.  There is one person who does everything, takes orders, prepares wines or beers, greets.  It's small enough where it's not so bad.  I didn't see much of it besides a string of white lights hanging, but they also have a patio.  The draft beer is an IPA and was very delicious and hop forward.  The mac and cheese was breaded and topped with onions.  It was hearty and tasty, but the cream could have been a little thicker.  The sautéed spinach was good, cooked in oil and garlic.  It was a bit too salty for my taste and a bit too oily, but it paired well with the mac and cheese.I could tell it's a regulars type of place because the waiter asked if I was new to the neighborhood and that he hadn't seen me before.  Even though there was one person working and a steady string of people coming in, the service was prompt, attentive, and friendly.  I'll definitely be going back.",4.0

"Stopped by for a brunch while dropping off my car at Jimmy's Auto's a couple blocks down.. I had read great reviews and was pretty excited about the place. When all was said and done, everything was just... a-ok. They do have a nice back yard style patio but there were a lot of bumble bees flying around and so we headed back inside.The service, while the staff was super friendly, brought us mango flavored tea when we ordered iced coffee. There was some confusion at first because the waiter asked if we wanted to try the mango flavored coffee when we ordered the iced coffee.. in either case, we asked him to clarify if the coffee was mango flavored or tea; I stated if the coffee was mango flavored, I was willing to try that but we all wanted iced coffee; the Mango flavored tea was pretty good however.The food.. we were starving. We ordered the Picada Salad cause the gf loves goat cheese.. she seemed to enjoy it for the most part.. but once she picked off the moderate amount of goat cheese, the salad became pretty non-noteworthy. I ordered the Huevos Rancheros, which was surprisingly good, albeit really messy. I asked the waiter if it was meant to be eaten like a wrap since it was served on corn tortillas but he said he didn't know, so I ate salad style. Lastly the Mac & Cheese was ok. It was very soupy and I guess I'm not a big fan of that.All in all, I had a pleasant experience but probably wont be a returning customer.",3.0
Came here for brunch with my boyfriend. We were immediately seated but we had the worst table in the restaurant. It was right beside the entrance and whenever someone opened the door it would hit the side of my chair and sometimes my leg...Luckily a table opened up and we got our tables changed. The staff was friendly and took down my order right away. My boyfriend ordered the pancakes and I ordered the huevos rancheros. Of course we ordered the Colombe coffee which deserves 5 stars. The food came 15 minutes later which is pretty average timing.Their huevos rancheros were overall a 3.5 stars. I've had better but these hit the spot at the moment. Would come here more often since it's in Brooklyn!,4.0
"Updated to add that Zona Sur has just gotten better and better in the year since they opened -- they're now our go-to lunch and brunch spot on the weekend and we order delivery at least once a week.

"Immoral (and potentially illegal) business practices taint this restaurant. I came here with my family for father's day lunch (6 people). The ambiance was fine and slightly rustic. The air conditioning was also sufficient. The food... wasn't overwhelming. Think of this place as... a mediocre spanish restaurant who's trying real hard to be hipster. Both of which they don't excel at, not that either is a great thing.   We asked for the check towards the end. The check came with a 20% gratuitiy added on top of the subtotal for the food. Which is illegal as of Jan 1, 2014: tripadvisor.com/Travel-g… . Not only did they add the mandatory gratuity (of 20%!) onto the subtotal, they charged TAX onto the mandatory gratuity. So it was (our food subtotal + 20% gratuity) * 8.875% tax = Final Total (tripadvisor.com/ShowTopi…)I didn't make a scene at the restaurant as I was with my family and out celebrating Father's Day. I mentioned it to our waitress, who hesitated until I asked her to check this with the manager for me. Came back and said ""that's how we've been doing it"". I paid then left. In all, something as stupid as this will ensure that I will NOT be going back to this restaurant. I will NOT be recommending this place. Any questions, feel free to msg me.",1.0

"TL;DR: Deeply satisfying food, relaxing atmosphere, slightly above priced compared to other neighborhood offerings and very welcoming kind staff.I had it in my mind that I would eat a light healthy lunch to start my swimsuit body journey on the right foot. With the thought of having the avocado salad and grilled chicken (which I've had and it's delicious) I headed to zona sur. Little did I know that I'd be tempted by the diet-breaking jezebel known as grilled cheese. So on this cold dreary January day I had a delightfully satisfying tomato soup with a cheddar and bacon grilled cheese. I also ordered a green tea that came served in a ridiculously precious wee-little cast iron tea pot. The tomato soup was a deeply flavorful affair and so chunky it ached to be scooped out with the grilled cheese. Unlike most tomato soups it wasn't overwhelmingly acidic or in an attempt to dampen the acid punch, overly creamy. It was beautifully complemented with a drizzle of fragrant olive oil. The grilled cheese was a perfect companion to the rich and savory tomato soup. It was crunchy, gooey, cheesy and bacon-ey....hello what more could you ask for!I did not leave a single crumb on my plate. And if I wasn't so vain I would've licked the tomato soup bowl. I like to think that someone in the kitchen was having a beautiful day because every SINGLE bite had a little love. You know how sometimes you get a grilled cheese and the very edge doesn't have butter or isn't perfectly toasted? Yeah, not here. Edge to edge, corner to corner, BUTTERED, TOASTED AND CHEESED.Also the servers were lovely and down to earth. We had a nice conversation about the transformative powers bacon has on a grilled cheese.A+ grilled cheese and tomato soup.",5.0

"What a cute little place.  I went here for dinner by myself and felt very comfortable.  There is one person who does everything, takes orders, prepares wines or beers, greets.  It's small enough where it's not so bad.  I didn't see much of it besides a string of white lights hanging, but they also have a patio.  The draft beer is an IPA and was very delicious and hop forward.  The mac and cheese was breaded and topped with onions.  It was hearty and tasty, but the cream could have been a little thicker.  The sautéed spinach was good, cooked in oil and garlic.  It was a bit too salty for my taste and a bit too oily, but it paired well with the mac and cheese.I could tell it's a regulars type of place because the waiter asked if I was new to the neighborhood and that he hadn't seen me before.  Even though there was one person working and a steady string of people coming in, the service was prompt, attentive, and friendly.  I'll definitely be going back.",4.0
Amazing Croque Madame I could keep coming back just to eat that. Also very nice ambience and the owners are lovely!!,5.0
"Move over Park Slope, Sunset Park is moving up with this hidden gem among all the Mexican restaurants I found this awesome  Cafe. I have been there 4 times in the past several weeks and it just gets better from the awesome Sangria to the coffee at brunch!  I have never ordered a steak outside of a Steakhouse but was in the mood so had their special ribeye cooked perfectly & tender and big! fried artichoke hearts & mussels a must try. Than you have to choose from all those deserts that don't disappoint. Brunch fresh coconut pancakes with sides of sausage & bacon :)The staff is very friendly great service & makes you feel welcome. But the best comes at the end of the meal the check will keep you smiling. Enjoy!!.",5.0
"Stopped by for a brunch while dropping off my car at Jimmy's Auto's a couple blocks down.. I had read great reviews and was pretty excited about the place. When all was said and done, everything was just... a-ok. They do have a nice back yard style patio but there were a lot of bumble bees flying around and so we headed back inside.The service, while the staff was super friendly, brought us mango flavored tea when we ordered iced coffee. There was some confusion at first because the waiter asked if we wanted to try the mango flavored coffee when we ordered the iced coffee.. in either case, we asked him to clarify if the coffee was mango flavored or tea; I stated if the coffee was mango flavored, I was willing to try that but we all wanted iced coffee; the Mango flavored tea was pretty good however.The food.. we were starving. We ordered the Picada Salad cause the gf loves goat cheese.. she seemed to enjoy it for the most part.. but once she picked off the moderate amount of goat cheese, the salad became pretty non-noteworthy. I ordered the Huevos Rancheros, which was surprisingly good, albeit really messy. I asked the waiter if it was meant to be eaten like a wrap since it was served on corn tortillas but he said he didn't know, so I ate salad style. Lastly the Mac & Cheese was ok. It was very soupy and I guess I'm not a big fan of that.All in all, I had a pleasant experience but probably wont be a returning customer.",3.0
Came here for brunch with my boyfriend. We were immediately seated but we had the worst table in the restaurant. It was right beside the entrance and whenever someone opened the door it would hit the side of my chair and sometimes my leg...Luckily a table opened up and we got our tables changed. The staff was friendly and took down my order right away. My boyfriend ordered the pancakes and I ordered the huevos rancheros. Of course we ordered the Colombe coffee which deserves 5 stars. The food came 15 minutes later which is pretty average timing.Their huevos rancheros were overall a 3.5 stars. I've had better but these hit the spot at the moment. Would come here more often since it's in Brooklyn!,4.0
"Updated to add that Zona Sur has just gotten better and better in the year since they opened -- they're now our go-to lunch and brunch spot on the weekend and we order delivery at least once a week. They serve La Colombe coffee and Colson pastries on weekday mornings, which is a lovely stop before getting on the train. You owe it to yourselves to make Zona Sur a regular part of your Sunset Park life!",5.0
"Immoral (and potentially illegal) business practices taint this restaurant. I came here with my family for father's day lunch (6 people). The ambiance was fine and slightly rustic. The air conditioning was also sufficient. The food... wasn't overwhelming. Think of this place as... a mediocre spanish restaurant who's trying real hard to be hipster. Both of which they don't excel at, not that either is a great thing.   We asked for the check towards the end. The check came with a 20% gratuitiy added on top of the subtotal for the food. Which is illegal as of Jan 1, 2014: tripadvisor.com/Travel-g… . Not only did they add the mandatory gratuity (of 20%!) onto the subtotal, they charged TAX onto the mandatory gratuity. So it was (our food subtotal + 20% gratuity) * 8.875% tax = Final Total (tripadvisor.com/ShowTopi…)I didn't make a scene at the restaurant as I was with my family and out celebrating Father's Day. I mentioned it to our waitress, who hesitated until I asked her to check this with the manager for me. Came back and said ""that's how we've been doing it"". I paid then left. In all, something as stupid as this will ensure that I will NOT be going back to this restaurant. I will NOT be recommending this place. Any questions, feel free to msg me.",1.0
"VERY happy to have this place in our neighborhood! It is really an oasis because there is nothing else like it, as far as cuisine and ambiance, in Sunset Park.The food is excellent: nice quality and prepared to perfection.The outdoor seating is expansive. It's very clean and it's clear the owners take pride in their business. Cafe Zona Sur also takes credit cards which in Sunset Park is a RARE thing. Plus they have a friendly staff. Love this place!",4.0
"TL;DR: Deeply satisfying food, relaxing atmosphere, slightly above priced compared to other neighborhood offerings and very welcoming kind staff.I had it in my mind that I would eat a light healthy lunch to start my swimsuit body journey on the right foot. With the thought of having the avocado salad and grilled chicken (which I've had and it's delicious) I headed to zona sur. Little did I know that I'd be tempted by the diet-breaking jezebel known as grilled cheese. So on this cold dreary January day I had a delightfully satisfying tomato soup with a cheddar and bacon grilled cheese. I also ordered a green tea that came served in a ridiculously precious wee-little cast iron tea pot. The tomato soup was a deeply flavorful affair and so chunky it ached to be scooped out with the grilled cheese. Unlike most tomato soups it wasn't overwhelmingly acidic or in an attempt to dampen the acid punch, overly creamy. It was beautifully complemented with a drizzle of fragrant olive oil. The grilled cheese was a perfect companion to the rich and savory tomato soup. It was crunchy, gooey, cheesy and bacon-ey....hello what more could you ask for!I did not leave a single crumb on my plate. And if I wasn't so vain I would've licked the tomato soup bowl. I like to think that someone in the kitchen was having a beautiful day because every SINGLE bite had a little love. You know how sometimes you get a grilled cheese and the very edge doesn't have butter or isn't perfectly toasted? Yeah, not here. Edge to edge, corner to corner, BUTTERED, TOASTED AND CHEESED.Also the servers were lovely and down to earth. We had a nice conversation about the transformative powers bacon has on a grilled cheese.A+ grilled cheese and tomato soup.",5.0
"Cute, trendy, cozy, and located in Sunset Park, if this isn't a sign of gentrification, I don't know what is! I lived in Sunset Park for a little while, and when I discovered this place, I was in awe. I thought diner food was as good as it was gonna get in the neighborhood. Whether I ordered food for delivery or opted to dine in, the food was consistent. Their breakfast special offers a generous portion at a great price. The egg torta is my favorite. The coffee is really good, and there's always refills. Have one of their burgers, and you'll be full ALL day. This place is such a wonderful addition to the neighborhood, and I will surely make it a point to stop in for a bite whenever I'm around.",5.0
"Still one of my favorite restaurants in the area, but when it comes to delivery and takeout they have issues.

"is New American restaurant in Sunset park representing a couple's food journey. The food is solid to delicious. Fluffy pancakes for brunch, large bowl of guacamole anytime. For dinner: PEI Mussels are succulently bathing in a broth of white wine, garlic and bay leaves, al dente squid ink linguine with seafood and penne bolognese with a hearty homemade ragu. The Penne bolognese is so good, you will keep forking bits from your partners plate even though you filled up on broth from the PEI mussels. (I don't know if I was supposed to spoon almost all of the broth into my mouth, but that's what I did!)The adorable ambience is why you should frequent this restaurant. Wooden chairs with hearts.

The Pain au chocolate was buttery, flaky, fresh and dangerous, the thought of doubling back for another was only thwarted by a definite need to be at point 'A' by X time.

"I'm new in the neighborhood, so I was searching for a good place to have brunch. All the reviews here on Yelp made me go to Cafe Zona Sur.It was a Sunday morning (around 11:30) and the place had plenty of available seats. The inside area is cool and cozy. There's also an outside area, which apparently was more fun.I spent exactly 30 minutes in there. They have plenty of options, but it was easy for me to choose Huevos Rancheros, since I love it. The coffee costed me $2.5, which is kind of expensive, since they didn't refill it.The dish came in about 5 minutes and was delicious, however, a little smaller than I was expecting. I ate it all in no more than 6 minutes and asked for the check. I paid in total around $13,60 + tips, which is not too much, but also not as cheap as I thought it could be. It's been less than one hour from that, and I feel hungry again.The waiters spoke English and Spanish, which is cool. All the clients at the time were either White, or Asian, or Latin.I guess it's a good place for having ""American"" food, for seating and spending some time. Maybe my rating would be better if I wasn't in such a hurry. Anyways, I have eaten more and paied the same in wealthier neighborhoods.",3.0

The egg torta is delicious, as is their salad with grilled chicken, and steak sammy if you are in the mood. And the big breakfast plate is satisfying on every level. In the summer the patio is the best I know of in the area and live music makes brunch an even more special event.

There's also outdoor seating in their backyard but I like eating indoors in case of bugs. :P Def will come back.",5.0

"surprisingly to find a nice cafe like this in Sunset Park.   Friends recommended to gather here for Sunday brunch.  The minute i walked in, i liked it.  I have to say I did not expect this type of cafe in Sunset Park.  The server was friendly, food was decent tasty, not pricey.  There were live music, that's a plus.  Will def bring my friends back here. Can't believe i used to live in Sunset park for years and did not notice them.",4.0
"I'm new in the neighborhood, so I was searching for a good place to have brunch. All the reviews here on Yelp made me go to Cafe Zona Sur.It was a Sunday morning (around 11:30) and the place had plenty of available seats. The inside area is cool and cozy. There's also an outside area, which apparently was more fun.I spent exactly 30 minutes in there. They have plenty of options, but it was easy for me to choose Huevos Rancheros, since I love it. The coffee costed me $2.5, which is kind of expensive, since they didn't refill it.The dish came in about 5 minutes and was delicious, however, a little smaller than I was expecting. I ate it all in no more than 6 minutes and asked for the check. I paid in total around $13,60 + tips, which is not too much, but also not as cheap as I thought it could be. It's been less than one hour from that, and I feel hungry again.The waiters spoke English and Spanish, which is cool. All the clients at the time were either White, or Asian, or Latin.I guess it's a good place for having ""American"" food, for seating and spending some time. Maybe my rating would be better if I wasn't in such a hurry. Anyways, I have eaten more and paied the same in wealthier neighborhoods.",3.0
"Classy little cafe with an excellent outdoor patio. Enjoyed a Sunday brunch here on the back patio, where live music and the sunshine accompanied my meal. They have a solid and simple regular breakfast menu, but their specials are the gem of their brunches. Great place with great service, a mimosa to start you off and you're good to go!",4.0
"Small place with delicious brunch. Went around 1150 and waited 5 mins for a table for 4. There was live music. Friendly staff and fast service. Cheap yummy brunch! Definitely recommending to friends. Had the pancake with fruit, egg, sausage and home fries for $10. How amazing is that? Sausage taste gourmet and pancake was so fluffy! Hubby had the steak Sammie and it was bursting with flavor. Everything is so reasonably priced. This place is getting popular and soon the wait time for brunch will be longer. Try it out!",4.0
"My husband and I were staying at a nearby hotel so we decided to stop in for brunch. There were only a few other patrons eating at the time so service was fast and our server was great. I really liked the laid back vibe of the place. I ordered the French toast, bacon and hash browns with a mimosa. My meal was pretty good, the mimosa was just okay. All in all, a solid brunch.",3.0
Best brunch in brooklyn. You wouldnt expect to find such a cozy restaurant in sunset park but it does exist! I will be back!,4.0
"I have been coming here to eat and work since it opened years ago and it continues to be my go-to place for getting things done or for just having a delicious bite near my home that is outside my house. The egg torta is delicious, as is their salad with grilled chicken, and steak sammy if you are in the mood. And the big breakfast plate is satisfying on every level. In the summer the patio is the best I know of in the area and live music makes brunch an even more special event. It's run by a super sweet family so you are supporting a local business and family in a direct way by coming. I'm almost scared to post this review as I'd hoped it would stay a hidden gem but love should be shared.",5.0
"I recently moved into the area. I saw the reviews on yelp and decided to give it a go. I had the steak which I ordered rare. It came perfectly cooked, which is no mean feat. The steak was all about the flavour and not about the size. A refreshing change. The fries were also very tasty and the side of spinach was properly cooked and not over salted as you find in so many other places.I am looking forward to going back and trying their other dishes. Add very good and friendly service and this place stands out in the area. Excellent value for the money.",5.0

"Decided to grab a bite before a Costco run in the Sunset Park area.  Really wanted to like this cute new brunch and dinner place which even has a black tea named after Queen Lili'uokalani.  (We're suckers for anything Hawaiian!) The huevos rancheros was tasty enough as was the steak and eggs but service leading up to our eating was abysmal.  We waited over an hour for our food, watching people who came in after us get their plates first. We had to bring this to our server's attention because she seemed clueless not realizing our food wasn't coming out in spite of our being there before the other customers.  Only then did she check and told us somehow the kitchen didn't get our order which is transmitted to them online. (How can that happen since all the other orders seemed to be getting filled okay?!).  Big offense here on her part by not taking ownership of the situation!  There was so much she was doing wrong and not doing to correct the problem.  Others continued to get their food before us.  She should have gone straight into the kitchen to tell them to push our food first due to this oversight regardless if it was a computer glitch or not.  Instead (and what irritated us more) she was standing no where near the kitchen but was idling by the bar and avoiding our gaze which I can tell you quickly turned into a sneer.  She seemed helpless and offered a croissant to make up for our long wait.  She didn't even offer to fill our coffee cups.  The other server did however maybe because he felt sorry for us.  I must say the other server did everything correctly and that is why his tables got their food promptly.  What could have been a nice find in the middle of a transitioning neighborhood is now our nightmare to avoid.  If she continues her lackadaisical service, this place could lose a lot of potentially loyal customers like us and fail as a business in general before it even gets off the ground.  Even if the food were extraordinary which it is not, poor service negates all of the chef's efforts.  What a pity!  Good luck and good bye Cafe Zona Sur!  We hardly knew ya!",1.0

"When I first went here with my girlfriend last summer after it being recommended to us is one of the better places in the neighborhood, I thought this place would become a saving grace of the neighborhood.

They sell Stumptown coffee and baked goods from Colson Patisserie which is a welcome thing in a neighborhood that has more Mexican joints than you can shake a stick at. Not that I have anything wrong with Mexican food. It just gets a little monotonous. I find it a little annoying that they play the TV almost all the time given the fact that they're pretty obviously trying to cater to a slightly more upscale clientele. It's a good place to have lunch and do a business meeting or catch up with friends. I wish they did a separate dinner menu.",4.0

"If you know Sunset Park then you're aware it's nearly impossible to get an artisan, bistro-y type experience with food in this neighborhood - until now.

But lunch menu items are uninspired and have a greasiness to them. I wish there were more ""healthy"" options available.Quality of ingredients: If you're going to charge Williamsburg bistro prices you'd better NOT be serving GMO produce, farm-raised carcinogenic fish patties or hormonal proteins. The recipes and creativity is on point, I just wish they'd step up their game when it comes to quality of ingredients. I've noticed a bit of a decline in the consistency of quality, overall, too. I hope they tend to this.As for the coffee - and this goes for anyone serving coffee - If you're going to sell iced coffee just prepare and sell cold brew. Everyone is aware that if all you're doing is brewing hot coffee then icing it later the customer is getting ripped off if you're charging the BK standard of $3-4 a cup. If Zona Sur would switch their iced coffee to cold brew, sans a price increase since they just raised it anyway, that would be great.All in all, it's a good place when you need to eat something in SP and don't feel like hitting up a food truck.

"Popped in for a quick lunch with the husband. Very casual, laid back environment. Guac and chips- homemade chips, similar to the Fried noodle chips from Chinese take restaurants, but wider. Very different from your usual chips that come with guac. Guac was lacking in lime, but it's understandable since lime prices went up recently. Zona sur burger - husband said it was very juicy and perfectly medium rare. He didn't like that the meat was shaped more round than flat, which I guess made it harder for him to eat it as a burger. Fries that came with the burger - good! Home made cut fries with potato skin still attached. They were perfectly fried and salted. This is better than the shake shack ones (the fat krinkle ones before being switched to the skinny burnt potato sticks). Egg torta - very flavorful! Never thought I would like a veggie sandwich with bacon, but it was so juicy and hearty. Plus the bun was freshly toasted. Seems like they bake it on premise. Definite coming back again when we are in the neighborhood doing our costco runs!",5.0
"Cafe Zona Sur is the first of its kind in Sunset Park. It's the kind of place that feels laid back enough to spend a lazy afternoon sipping coffee and going about your business without feeling pressured to get up and go. It's the kind of place you wake up wanting to go to for a casual unassuming breakfast or lunch on Sunday morning with a friend or significant other. It's nice enough to take your parents to without making them feel like they're too old for the place, and without making you feel like you're at an old-time establishment that dates back to your parents' teenage years.The food is just as inviting and satisfying as the atmosphere. The mac and cheese is creamy and hearty and a great meal for a rainy day (or not!). It came out piping hot in a small skillet, topped with bread crumbs and sweet caramelized onions. The chicken torta is just as filling. While the sandwich is not as stuffed as you would find it at other torta places, it is nevertheless delicious. It's a great mix of different flavors - grilled chicken, bacon, avocado, and chipotle mayo. Sprinkle on some hot sauce, and BAM - awesome sandwich. The accompanying fries are crispy and herb-seasoned (tasted like rosemary); however, my batch came out a little too salty for my liking.I was really impressed by Cafe Zona Sur. The waiter was friendly and attentive, and the food came out relatively quickly. I read some articles that indicated that the restaurant would soon open for dinner service, and I look forward to that. In the meantime, I will definitely be back for breakfast, and I'm so happy to have this addition to the neighborhood.",4.0
"This place is legit. The staff is friendly and my lunch was delicious. I ordered an avocado salad with grilled chicken. The avocado was fresh along with the tomatoes and cucumbers. The only thing that could've been better was more salad and variation; it was only arugula that was used.

"We order delivery pretty frequently from Cafe Zona Sur, and we're never disappointed. Their dinner entrees are always good quality, the hangar steak frites are my favorite, my boyfriend normally gets the chicken and mashed potatoes, always cooked to perfection! Sometimes the evening deliveries can take a while, but I assume that they would be busy on Saturday nights!As far as breakfast, I would like them to have a broader selection than what they currently have, but if you're looking for good quality hangover food this is a good go-to spot. I will order from them again for both! I give Cafe Zona Sur three stars...only because I'm not sure I would ever go there to eat publicly when there are so many other options in the neighborhood. But I would encourage others to go.",3.0
"Great food (except for the mac-n-cheese, sorry, my grandparents are from the south and it just doesn't come close to our recipe) my favorite is the steak and chimichurri sauce which is absolutely delicious. I love their sangrias and the breakfast sandwiches are SOO yum! My son loves their pancakes!",4.0

"Love, love, love this place! Cafe Zona Sur is my go to place for brunch. The poached egg crostini is hands down my favorite meal there. They took it off the specials this past month but I'm hoping they bring it back. The outdoor seating in the back is super cute as is the indoor space. Overall, this place has a great vibe with a really friendly staff. Dinner menu is solid, love the Mac and Cheese dish. I've order delivery a couple of times too and it was impressive. So happy to have this spot in the neighborhood. Don't know what I would do without it. Bring back the poached egg crostini!!",5.0
"I absolutely love this place!!! Amazing brunch, very cute and relaxing outside area.The staff is very sweet. The poached egg crostini is absolutely delicious!! Don't get rid of it!!! If you happen to be in the area, go check this place out, you will not be disappointed. And yay!! I'm the 100th review!!",5.0
"Food is awesome. Service is good.  Ambience is chill and cozy. Great brunch on weekends w/ live music. Backyard w/ outdoor seating is great in summer.  The quality of the meals is pretty uniformly great- the portion sizes can be a little underwhelming depending on what you order.  Most places will let you bring your own wine if you pay a 10-20 $ uncorking fee, but they won't here.  On the other hand they have nice wine specials on Mondays...",4.0
"Love this place.  Consistently great food.  Owners are dope.  They have nice music on occasion.  Coffee's pretty good, and it's a nice place to hang.I love the burger, steak and eggs, all egg sammiches, the chicken on top of veggies...this place is great.  A new place in Sunset Park and a very welcome addition.",5.0
"Popped in for a quick lunch with the husband. Very casual, laid back environment. Guac and chips- homemade chips, similar to the Fried noodle chips from Chinese take restaurants, but wider. Very different from your usual chips that come with guac. Guac was lacking in lime, but it's understandable since lime prices went up recently. Zona sur burger - husband said it was very juicy and perfectly medium rare. He didn't like that the meat was shaped more round than flat, which I guess made it harder for him to eat it as a burger. Fries that came with the burger - good! Home made cut fries with potato skin still attached. They were perfectly fried and salted. This is better than the shake shack ones (the fat krinkle ones before being switched to the skinny burnt potato sticks). Egg torta - very flavorful! Never thought I would like a veggie sandwich with bacon, but it was so juicy and hearty. Plus the bun was freshly toasted. Seems like they bake it on premise. Definite coming back again when we are in the neighborhood doing our costco runs!",5.0
"Cafe Zona Sur is the first of its kind in Sunset Park. It's the kind of place that feels laid back enough to spend a lazy afternoon sipping coffee and going about your business without feeling pressured to get up and go. It's the kind of place you wake up wanting to go to for a casual unassuming breakfast or lunch on Sunday morning with a friend or significant other. It's nice enough to take your parents to without making them feel like they're too old for the place, and without making you feel like you're at an old-time establishment that dates back to your parents' teenage years.The food is just as inviting and satisfying as the atmosphere. The mac and cheese is creamy and hearty and a great meal for a rainy day (or not!). It came out piping hot in a small skillet, topped with bread crumbs and sweet caramelized onions. The chicken torta is just as filling. While the sandwich is not as stuffed as you would find it at other torta places, it is nevertheless delicious. It's a great mix of different flavors - grilled chicken, bacon, avocado, and chipotle mayo. Sprinkle on some hot sauce, and BAM - awesome sandwich. The accompanying fries are crispy and herb-seasoned (tasted like rosemary); however, my batch came out a little too salty for my liking.I was really impressed by Cafe Zona Sur. The waiter was friendly and attentive, and the food came out relatively quickly. I read some articles that indicated that the restaurant would soon open for dinner service, and I look forward to that. In the meantime, I will definitely be back for breakfast, and I'm so happy to have this addition to the neighborhood.",4.0
"This place is legit. The staff is friendly and my lunch was delicious. I ordered an avocado salad with grilled chicken. The avocado was fresh along with the tomatoes and cucumbers. The only thing that could've been better was more salad and variation; it was only arugula that was used. It was 11 something but it was worth since I got tired of the Mcdonalds salad and Castillo empanadas, lol. Cool food and peeps. Would definitely order from here again (@s long @s I still work in the area;-).",4.0

"Every time I come here it's just lovely! This place opened up about a week after my boyfriend and I moved to the neighborhood...I feel like it was meant to be. The staff is friendly and attentive. The food is always delicious. The steak sammy is my favorite and I end up ordering almost every time but last night I switched it up. Ordered the focaccia pizza and steak frites (what can I say...I like steak). Everything was great. A nize, cozy spot on a cold winter night.",5.0
"Unexpectedly good for this neighborhood and a sure sign that gentrification efforts are spreading into Sunset Park.Prices (around $15-$19 for a dinner entree) are probably a bit higher than average for this neighborhood, but reasonable for what you're getting.

The hanger steak with chimichurri was good (three of us ordered this) and our server was nice about switching out the fries with veggie sides. The day's shrimp risotto was also solid. The chicken paillard, with light and crispy skin and a buttery sauce, was probably my favorite. And while nothing was top-notch, everything was good.Our server was attentive and refilled our water pitcher and glasses often.

"I was pleasantly surprised to find a new brunch place in this part of Brooklyn since there's a severe shortage of them!

I highly recommend this dish and so does the nice waitress!My friend ordered the zona sur grande ($10), which is pretty much the standard brunch platter with eggs, sausage/bacon, potatoes, and pancakes. I was surprised to find out that the pancakes comes with berries and confectioner sugar sprinkled on top. thumbs up for the extra touch!The only thing I was disappointed about was the coffee (since I've read the other raving reviews). I highly anticipated the la colombe coffee (as a regular at the NOHO la colombe shop) but my iced latte came out tasting watery and the iced coffee had the same issue and even had a lot coffee ground in it. They nicely replaced it though.Overall, the food and ambience was excellent but perhaps the coffee barista could work on making the coffee better!",5.0
"Loved it!  My dad and I took my mom here for Mother's Day brunch.  Let me just start off by saying please do not let the address/area fool you into thinking this place is bad or low class.  Yes, Sunset Park isn't a great neighborhood but honestly we could not be happier that we chose this place for brunch.  My dad is a 78 Greek man and complains about EVERYTHING.  He was so super happy with his brunch.  He had pancakes, eggs, potatoes and sausage.  Everything was perfect.  He especially enjoyed the coffee.  I had the juevos rancheros and could not have been more happy with them.  My mom had the breakfast sandwich and enjoyed it immensely.  The prices are fantastic.  $35 for 3 people on Mother's Day?!  That's unheard of.  I'm so so happy that we chose this place over anywhere in Bay Ridge.The ambiance is great, it was a beautiful day out so the door was open and people kept filing in.  The music is great and it's just a nice, relaxing place to have a good meal.  The staff is exceptionally nice.  My father is handicapped and they were more than accommodating.  The waiter (I wish I remembered his name) was so pleasant and attentive and is honestly one of the reason's we'll be coming back.  My mom even wants to back for dinner and we only left there an our ago!",5.0

"Very well done. Basically this place is a bistro, with many of the dishes (skate wing, steak frites) you'd expect to see on a French Bistro menu. Based on their Croque Madame I'd trust the French dishes here - it was correct in every way. They also make a big deal out of breakfast/brunch, and the French toast my wife got was a prefect example of the dish. The menu is rounded out with some Italian and Latin-American fare. This makes sense for the neighborhood. The coffee is not as good as what you'd find at a place devoted to coffee, but more than good enough for a bistro. Nice selection of beers and table wines as well.And the prices are completely fair, which is how a neighborhood bistro is supposed to be - a little splurge, not a major one. If romantic casual is your thing this place is for you. Service and ambiance very good as well. Flamenco music in the background during our visit fit the vibe perfectly.

"Nice spot to grab brunch.  Came in with a group to celebrate a friend's birthday.  Ambiance is sparse but they mentioned they're about to open up an outdoor patio out back which should help.Ordered guacamole and chips to start which was good.  Both the chips and guac are obviously homemade.  Also started with a couple pitchers of Sangria.  I personally don't drink it but everyone at the table liked both the red and white versions.  I had beer.  Unfortunately their selection is lacking, the budweiser/corona/blue moon variety, whereas I prefer microbrews.Entrees included huevos rancheros, steak salads, a chicken torta, burger, and steak sandwich.  Once again everyone seemed to like their selections.  My steak sandwich was excellent.  Marinated skirt steak sliced up and mixed with just the right amount of Gruyere and sauteed onions all stuffed between grilled chibatta.  The homemade fries accompanying it were also tasty.The birthday girl was treated to a tiramisu.  Honestly not great but I attribute some of that to the fact we may have rushed them on it...seemed like it should have sat out of the cooler and warmed up a bit.  However since it was comped I shouldn't complain.Overall a great experience.  I'd certainly return.",4.0

"I took my mom here for Mother's Day. We loved it. She got the steak sandwich and I got the chicken sandwich. They were delicious. The owner (I think) came out and made sure we enjoyed everything. Our server was also very friendly. The cafe is super cute. We loved the Spanish music that was playing.  There is a large outdoor space in the back. I cannot wait to go back. I'm so happy there's a place like this in the neighborhood.  Although, I would love it if the mimosas were cheaper, or they offered unlimited for brunch.",4.0
I absolutely love this place! I recommend the Zona Sur Burger with the garlic french fries-- so delicious.  I am so happy this place is in my neighborhood; it was a much needed addition.  If you want a nice dinner or even if you just want to sit and unwind by having a glass of wine -- this is the spot.Its also nice to even have a place that sells a decent salad here in Sunset Park.  I also recommend the house salad with grilled chicken for those days you want something light - the greens are fresh and delish.,5.0
"A rare gem that you will truly knock your socks off on all levels--the food, the people, the interiors, the coffee, the prices, opens early, the lack of a wait... One visit and you will be hooked.We discovered them (thanks to Yelp) while looking for ""somewhere new"" that might be a little off of our beaten path. It has quickly become a favorite breakfast spot of ours and part of my weekly routine.Don't let the address discourage you either, Park Slope peeps...it's right off the R at 45th Street and truly rivals other favorites of ours (including Buttermilk Channel, Stone Park Cafe & Seersucker).Maria and Luis will treat you like family from the start.  Be sure to tell 'em Greg sent you!",5.0
"An awesome breakfast place. The coffee is excellent. Repeat the coffee is excellent.  This coming from a former Barista in Portland, Oregon.  I mean it's so good that I happily drank it without cream.The food is high quality and well prepared. The prices are extremely reasonable. I would come back (and have) again and again.  Bonus: They are going to open a garden patio in the back. An oasis in Brooklyn.  I'm really happy to have found this gem.",5.0
"Wonderful food, some of the best service I've ever had, and a bunch of little extra touches that made it great. The pastries were top shelf, they had La Colombe coffee (which is delicious), and the croque madame was one of the best I've ever had. Worth the trip.Edit: changed from a 5 star review to a 4. I had the pastries again in December 2013, and they were quite bad. I'm not sure if they changed suppliers, and the brunch food I had months earlier was really great-- but those pastries were hard to get through.",4.0
"Nice spot to grab brunch.  Came in with a group to celebrate a friend's birthday.  Ambiance is sparse but they mentioned they're about to open up an outdoor patio out back which should help.Ordered guacamole and chips to start which was good.  Both the chips and guac are obviously homemade.  Also started with a couple pitchers of Sangria.  I personally don't drink it but everyone at the table liked both the red and white versions.  I had beer.  Unfortunately their selection is lacking, the budweiser/corona/blue moon variety, whereas I prefer microbrews.Entrees included huevos rancheros, steak salads, a chicken torta, burger, and steak sandwich.  Once again everyone seemed to like their selections.  My steak sandwich was excellent.  Marinated skirt steak sliced up and mixed with just the right amount of Gruyere and sauteed onions all stuffed between grilled chibatta.  The homemade fries accompanying it were also tasty.The birthday girl was treated to a tiramisu.  Honestly not great but I attribute some of that to the fact we may have rushed them on it...seemed like it should have sat out of the cooler and warmed up a bit.  However since it was comped I shouldn't complain.Overall a great experience.  I'd certainly return.",4.0
"Came here for my husband's Father's day brunch with our toddler. The outside is very unassuming and the surrounding area is actually a tad sketchy. But once you go in and head towards the backyard seating area, you feel like you're taken to a Latin countryside.The food was great. We ordered a chicken torta and a sammy steak. Both were nicely done on both portion and taste. The guac (slightly small) came with homemade chips.  And we tried out the mac and cheese as well. This was our least fav because it was a bit too oily.Service was nice but a bit slow, esp. since more customers started to fill up the place--indoors and out.Overall it was a nice experience and a cool spot within Sunset Park BK.",4.0
"This place is awesome!  Sunset Park is a great food neighborhood, but this place is a bit more upscale and ambience-y than most other places around, while still being cool and a little bit under the radar.  GREAT guacamole with homemade chips, and a very generous portion.  Cheeseburgers and bellinis were delicious also.  The service was accommodating, friendly, and completely comfortable.Highly recommended!!",5.0
"On our first night in Brooklyn, we went to this restaurant. We weren't disappointed! We shared a chips and guacamole, which was really good! Homemade guacamole with warm chips.

No problem- I just headed to my other favorite place, YourHouse Cafe, a couple of subway stops deeper into Brooklyn. Win/win! Maybe I'll call Zona in advance next time.",5.0

"Sunrise at Sunset Park. Forget any where north of here if you're looking for a good hangar steak and frites at a reasonable price.  Chef Luis Hernandez will ensure that the steak is cooked at the right temperature.  Paired that steak with an appetizer round of the freshest mussels in a mild guajillo chili sauce.  The arugula salad was crisp, cold and delicious. Get here quick and enjoy a new neighborhood gem.",4.0
"Warm and cozy environment, staff is lovely and best of all the food is excellent.  I live in Bushwick and went to check it out with my family and we loved it.  The coffee was awesome, pancakes were delicious and the huevos rancheros were tasty.

"My roommate and I just moved into the neighborhood and decided to give Cafe Zona Sur a try for brunch. The tiny cafe has a decidedly french feel, and the waitstaff were even wearing black berets.

Every group that sat down commented on the size of the glasses, which was pretty amusing. We proceeded to order coffees and a Bellini. The Colombian coffee was fantastic, and the Bellini was good -  but not great, for $10. The food, however, was phenomenal. I ordered a breakfast sandwich with bacon, cheddar, eggs, and avocado on a croissant. Every ingredient was fresh and well-cooked, including the croissant itself, which was my favorite part!Downsides: They couldn't split the check, and there was no wifi service.All things considered, I will definitely be back!",4.0

Got the special which was steak and eggs and it was dynamite. Steak and eggs both cooked to perfection as ordered. Portion size was perfect. Prices are really fair also for the quality of the food. Everything was very fresh. Very friendly staff also. Can't wait to go back.,5.0
"A neighbor recommended me the Cafe Zona Sur. I figured I would go on a week night. Well, I did.  I found a jewel. This place is an oasis.  The service is excellent without being overwhelming. The ambiance is welcoming, cozy, a bit shabby chic, but comes together beautifully.  I love brick walls.  I looked at the menu and loved it. Small, concise, well put together, emanates freshness.  Took the waiter's suggestion and ordered the grilled sea food mix with grilled vegetables.  This dish was an amazing surprise.  The salmon was cooked to perfection. Seared gold and subtlety spiced --the Chef only knows what he uses-- tasty, grilled to a medium rare transparency in the center which made it even more flavorful. The calamari... al dente is a way to describe it but was perfectly snapping in your mouth and the shrimp sweet and soft and juicy.  The perfect point. As for the veggies... what can I say... it is so difficult to describe perfection.  Chef Luis pushes the envelope. Pushes the cooking point just a bit past al dente, so that the pieces are cooked but no raw center, and still crunchy but not mushy.  I added a bit of lemon just because but the dish didn't need anything as it came out of the kitchen.  The plate was really well balanced and had a piece of grilled pineapple which was surprisingly nice and gave a dash of spark.  I recommend this dish anytime.  Saw the steak and fries being served to a customer sitting a table or two from  me.... grilled to perfection... Chef Luis has a gift and the technique. He knows the trade and he has the artistic touch that is so difficult to come by.  I am coming back to Zona Sur for more!!!! The place has a small bar which is welcoming to astray customers who don't want to sit at a table and feel isolated.  There is soft music. Nice volume, just right to allow you to chat and to hear your counterpart.  No tv is more than a plus.  Their coffee is out of this world.  Espresso for me nice and not bitter at all and no lemon zest...yes!!! no lemon zest!!! a true espresso finally and has to be found in Sunset Park!!!! I fell in love with this place.  They do take out and delivery as well and they have lunch and brunch. Cannot wait to report on my next experience.  If anybody can get a hint on Chef Luis' spice mix... please... email me... haven't tasted anything like it anywhere!!!!",5.0
I went here for dinner with a group of 10 friends and both the service and food were awesome!  All of my friends enjoyed their meals and everything I tasted was good.  Beware of the sangria its yummy but it will sneak up on you.  I will be going back.,5.0
"This is the best new restaurant I've been to in a really really long time with two of the most important attributes rarely found together: Amazing food and UN-PRETENTIOUS! Usually I find American cuisine boring, but I was looking for a place close to home to bring out-of-town friends and chose Cafe Zona Sur because of the outstanding yelp reviews. It's a small, quiet, unassuming place with a simple, homey exterior and interior. My friends had salads, one with rare sliced steak, and I had the salmon over kale. My friend's steak was perfectly cooked, and my salmon, a fish which always tastes the same to me, blew my mind from the first bite. The kale was also perfectly cooked and it was in a creamy dijon sauce that was perfectly seasoned. For dessert, I had the lava cake, the best I've had, with vanilla ice cream and a surprisingly good strawberry (especially for October.) The prices are extremely reasonable. One of the outstanding things about this place is the atmosphere. Our waitress was a young Russian woman wearing jeans with a genuine, laid back, friendly demeanor. We met the owner/chef - genuine, down-to-earth, and friendly. As we walked out, I noticed they had a delivery menu! I couldn't believe it. These guys would bring this food to my house?? I immediately called my parents who live nearby and told them to run to Cafe Zona Sur and bring all their friends.",5.0
Great new restaurant in Sunset Park adding a much needed American/Latin Bistro menu with an incredible brunchStaff is great and very attentiveDesserts and pastries are well doneThey just opened for dinner in late March but have been open for mornings and afternoons for quite some time.I highly recommend this restaurant and I am looking forward to the back yard to be open for al fresco dining soon,5.0
"Great food, great ambiance, great music, great customer service. Free wi-fi. Close to the subway. What more can you ask? This lovely cafe in Sunset Park has the fluffiest banana pancakes; the chicken torta with fries was the perfect balance of healthy and filling. They made everything with organic eggs. It was a little taste of France (maybe also because we were listening  to Edith Piaff) in Brooklyn.",5.0
"Lovely spot in Sunset Park. A refreshing alternative to the awesome authentic, yet greasy tacos. We have eaten here twice and always get great service. Hamburger is a nice juicy patty that can be cooked rare. The rosemary french fries are awesome! The staff is friendly, La Colombe coffee is great.",4.0
"I love this place.  Its a nice change from the (admittedly wonderful) Mexican and a Asian places in the neighborhood.  The food is always spot on.The only thing I would complain about is the service.  I come here pretty regularly, and its always TERRIBLE.  It takes years to get a simple coffee, and often they forget to bring drinks all together.  Nonetheless, you can't beat it for the price.  Its worth a visit.",4.0
"This place has got it all right. The look and feel is hip, but not pretentious. The food was incredible, and FRESH. You can taste the difference between these eggs and other eggs. The crepes were also mind blowing. You will not be disappointed, no doubt.Matt",5.0

"Came with a friend. The decor is nice, there's a few small tables scattered through the restaurant, and the best part was the whiskey water bottle with shot glass cups. It was cute, but Annoying. I'm a big water drinker, more like a camel that just stores water, so I was constantly refilling the little cup every few minutes. I ordered the egg torta and it was one of the best breakfast sandwiches I've had. I really wanted to order the croissant sandwich, but I'm glad I didn't because I would have missed out. My friend ordered the healthy steel cut oats but it was on the salty side. Perhaps they mistook salt for sugar? Or steel cut oats are salty? I don't know, oats are too healthy for me. I really liked this place, so i plan to return for the croissant sandwich and a nice mocha latte. I'm drooling already.",4.0

"As new Sunset Park residents, my husband and I were skeptical that Zona Sur would live up to our expectations of an upscale restaurant with non-hispanic cuisine so close to our new home, but were pleasantly surprised when we stopped in several Saturdays ago.  The owner/chef introduced himself and was very pleasant.  We will be back and are routing for Luis.",4.0
"This adorable bistro is such a great addition to the neighborhood--it's become our go-to brunch spot. The backyard patio space fills up quickly on the weekend, for good reason: it's blooming with plants and full of whimsical cafe chairs. The music selection always transports me to a chic Parisian street. The lattes are yummy (featuring coffee from La Colombe), and the food is spot-on. Faves include the breakfast pizza (fontina and poached eggs on delicious focaccia) and lemon-ricotta crepes. Dinner is delicious, too--especially the burgers and the creamy mac n cheese.

"Cafe Zona Sur, we have been waiting for you! Great little eatery. So charming, the food is great, the prices so fair, the owner absolutely lovely, as was the service.
