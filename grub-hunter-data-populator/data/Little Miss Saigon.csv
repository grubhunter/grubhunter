"My friend and I went here on a groupon. The sandwich, I had sardine and she had chicken, made a good lunch. I got it spicey, but it needed some Siracha sauce for the extra kick.

"I don't think I'll be able to patronize LMS after yesterday.+ I've purchased their shredded chicken bahn mi & grilled chicken multiple times since my initial review, because LMS is in my neighborhood and not only do I support local businesses but I LOVE bahn mi's and Vietnamese food. + The main issue is quality control. Too many times I've received a bahn mi with ONE piece of meat. That's NOT okay to me. I'm not paying $7 per sandy for ONE measly piece of chicken. sometimes there's a decent amount (not SUFFICIENT) of meat, but then either no veggies or way too much veggies that the bread becomes soggy. - i bought sandwiches for my family yesterday and was completely EMBARRASSED when my mom opened up her bahn mi to show me there was like nothing in the sandwich. Barely any chicken, two jalapenos (i always request spicy with extra jalapenos on the side- which they forgot, again), BUT a heaping of carrots. I DIDN'T ORDER A CARROT SANDWICH and the bread was HARD. + i think they need to find a system or way to produce the sandwiches in a uniform manner, so that it's CONSISTENT.TRULY DISAPPOINTING.",2.0
"i like this place.  i wanted to give it more stars, but there's a few things that were a bit amiss..  there were good things too though, and the 'bad' things weren't so bad.  here was my experience:ordered delivery, they were SUPER FAST!  (i live super closeby, but still! it was at my door in under 20 minutes - WHOA!)  i got the grilled pork sandwich - i LOVED the crunchy french bread, but did not like the way the meat was seasoned.  (and there wasn't much meat there at all either!)  now, that's a preference of taste, that has nothing to do w/ the 3 star rating i gave it - i just know that (for me) i won't be ordering that sandwich again, cuz of the seasoning  it's some kind of spice that i don't like - i don't know what it is, but when i get it, i am disappointed   : p  but, again - that's not little miss saigon's fault xoxo (i just need to figure out what that spice is so i can steer myself clear of it next time!)  but again, LOVED the crunchy, fresh baguette the sandwich was served on, and because there was so little meat anyway, i was able to eat it and just basically enjoy the bread.  (i was hungry!)  the veggies and cilantro on the sandwich were awesome too - wonderfully fresh and crunchy.  my complaint is that for a sandwich, it was all bread and not enough meat or veggies!  no flavor really either (there was supposed to be mayo on this?  i didn't see any..)  all of this being said, i will say that i loved how there was a nice big piece of cucumber in both halves of my sandwich - very fresh, crispy and satisfying.  i ordered a shrimp summer roll with the peanut sauce which was ""o.k.""  like nothing to write home about.  the sauce was meh - nothing special.  it was thick and peanut-ey, but was just adequate - didn't gross me out, but didn't blow me away.  it was just.. there.  the rolls themselves were good - they were fresh and everything - but my complaint is that there were only 2 pieces of shrimp in each! so 1 shrimp cut in half for each roll for $4.50 - it was mostly stuffed with noodles, and, to add insult to injury, one of the tails hadn't been cleaned properly, so there was that hard skin of the tail left on the shrimp of one of my rolls as well.  great!  besides the skimpy shrimp, they skimped on the veggies in the rolls, too  : (  i wasn't too happy about that!  especially because i saw pics of fellow yelpers with 4 or even 5 ""half pieces"" of shrimp in each of their rolls!!!  how disappointing to get.. 2 (only 1 shrimp!!!) in both of mine!  : (   they stuffed it WAY full with those noodles though, boy.  not my thing.  (maybe it was the person who made them that day?  or they happened to be running out of shrimp when my rolls were made?)  either way, i felt ripped off as i sat glumly eating the few mouthfulls of noodles with a few bits of cilantro and julienned carrot that made up my ""shrimp"" summer rolls..  : (i got a taro bubble tea and was surprised that it came in such a little cup for $4..  that was disappointing.  i was expecting a ""regular sized"" one for that price - this was pretty mini.  also, i was not expecting it to be purple - when i get my taro bubble tea in chinatown, it's white, a lot bigger, a lot cheaper, and it has ""taro texture"" - i drank the purple silky drink and was left unsatisfied.  finally, i tried 2 pieces of their sponge cake - the chocolate chip and the green tea.  they were like little puffs of angel food cake, and both were great.  the chocolate chip was my favorite - tiny bits of semi-sweet chocolate distributed plentifully throughout - YUM!  : )  the owner (teddy) who i spoke with when i ordered about a groupon (i couldn't use it on delivery, and i guess it had expired too, which was disappointing) was really nice on the phone when he took my order, and he threw in an almond cookie which was nice.  the delivery person had to come back because they had forgotten to put in my taro bubble tea (i felt so bad for the guy!)  he was so sweet about it, and i spoke to teddy again to specifically ask him to please take care of him! (which i'm sure he did, cuz he said he would).overall, the $22 i paid for these few items (indeed, it came in one tiny bag, which, in a way was good cuz i was able to say, right there when it was initially delivered - wait, where's my tea!!?!) left me feeling very unsatisfied.final thoughts:  i might stop in there if i happen to be walking by for a tea with a hunk of chocolate chip cake, but overall this (unfortunately) felt really disappointing - the very small amount of skimpy / not very flavorful food i got for $22 bucks left me very unsatisfied, which is very disappointing because i really, really wanted to like this place!  sadly i don't think i'll be ordering from them again   : (",3.0
"When I learned about the opening of this eatery I knew that I had to go by quickly so that I could try it for myself. The solid five stars also led to me having high expectations for the food. We ordered mango bubble tea, the chicken sandwich, and the vegetable rolls. The bubble tea took awhile to make because they were making the bubbles.... While I liked the mango and green tea mix part I found the bubbles to be too chewy and ended up not wanting to chew them at all.The vegetable roll was fresh. I was disappointed that no avocado was included because I have had them elsewhere with avocado. I tried the peanut sauce once and found it to be too strong and did not use it.The chicken sandwich did not have a lot of meat and was wanting in terms of flavor. My husband added cheese and mayo to help the flavor out....Sadly I will not be returning as I did not like the food at all. The service was quick and friendly. Also they don't print receipts.",2.0
"I really want to love it here considering how close in proximity it is to my apartment. So far I've frequented twice: the first to try the bahn mi and the second to try the summer rolls. As other reviewers have stated these sandwiches aren't the most generous when it comes to meat, but if you're craving a bahn mi and don't feel like traveling far they get the job done. In my opinion, the quality of the bread is a deal breaker and on this occasion mine was dry to the point of no return. No amount of spreads could bring this bread back to life. While it wasn't the worst sandwich I've had in my life there were definitely elements that could have made it more enjoyable. On a positive note, I also gave their bubble tea and almond cookie a try and both were very good. Overall, I'd give that particular experience three stars. My second stop was fueled by a craving for fresh spring rolls: the weekend prior I had these amazingingly crunchy, veggie filled rolls from a different restaurant in Park Slope and was looking for an alternative nearby. While searching, I stumbled yet again on Little Miss Saigon and decided to walk over. They had a pack of two freshly made summer rolls ready to purchase and within a minute I was on my way home. When I unwrapped the rolls I was disappointed to find that they had not been cleaned properly. I could see the trails of ""dirt"" (fecal matter) in my shrimp through the rice paper, a sight that easily kills your appetite. Determined to give these a try, I carefully ripped it open to remove the ""dirt"" and out spilled a unnecessary amount of rice noodles, a tiny piece of iceburg lettuce, a sprig of cilantro and three half cuts of shrimp. Don't get me wrong, these rolls are HUGE but it's mainly because they are filled with noodles, not actual veggies. At this point, I have an unsightly pile of unflavored noodles and some shrimp that weren't cleaned properly. I attempted to eat some of the rice noodles by dipping them into the peanut sauce but at that point I was defeated and starving. Although I would give them 5/5 stars for speediness, the fact that my food was not cleaned properly is a big turn off. Every restaurant has it's own style for preparing food and I can completely respect something different but the overfilling of noodles just didn't do it for me. Sadly, I do not think I will be back.",2.0
"This hidden gem in Ditmas is delicious!! I say hidden because it's tucked behind two gorgeous trees that provide a ton of shade for the small outside seating. This place is tiny so ideal for take out but the food is big on flavor. I got the grilled pork with may, pickled daikon and carrot with cucumber. The pork is perfectly grilled for a mix of tender and crispy textures. The marinade is mouth watering. I was sad when my sandwich was gone. It was that good.I also got a matcha milk tea with bubbles (boba/pearls) and was so happy the tapioca was cooked correctly. Perfectly soft yet chewy! Believe me lots of places screw this up.Highly suggest stopping in for pretty muh anything they offer. You can see it being made right on the spot.",5.0
Stopped in for dinner and there are no seats except 2 by the wall which I imagine cant fit anyone comfortably. i had a grilled chicken avoc salad which I thought was pretty good. Also tried the sandwich and didn't think the ratio of bread to meat/fillings were that great.,3.0
"I was so excited to learn that a viet sandwich shop had open nearby, sadly it was very disappointing. I really wanted to like this place so much so that I gave it a second chance. First time I ordered the grilled chicken bahn mi, which was extremely salty. The second time I ordered the LMS special with the fried pork and pate, and also the boiled chicken bahn mi. The LMS special pate had a weird taste to it, like it had gone bad. The boiled chicken bahn mi was exactly that, boiled chicken thrown in with some veggies. It's very disappointing that they don't put any type of house special sauce that I'm used to in bahn mi's I usually get. Especially for one with, just plain boiled chicken.",2.0

"Nice, clean shop making tasty sandwiches.  Brought home to my family 2 orders of summer spring rolls and 4 sandwiches: 2 LMS specials, 1 grilled pork and 1 grilled chicken and everyone was pleased with the food.  Personally I really loved the peanut dipping sauce for the spring rolls - it was very aromatic and no one wanted to share it.  I noticed a canister of premium Bazzini peanuts in the shop and suspect that's what was in this sauce!",4.0
"Little Miss Saigon is a wonderful addition to the neighborhood! First of all, I love Vietnamese food, especially banh mis so I was super excited when I heard this place was opening up. I have tried the LMS and the grilled pork banh mis and they are both delicious. I prefer the LMS though... Order it and your mouth will thank you. I've also had the milk bubble tea which is always made perfectly. Definitely will try out the other ones, but the milk tea one is too good not to get every time I stop by.The place is small so like everyone else said, it's great for take-out. They also take credit card which is convenient. They also have loyalty cards. Make sure to pick one up and your 10th bubble tea and/or banh mi is free! What's better than free food?! Side note: Teddy (the owner) is super friendly and funny. He always greets you with a smile and he already knows me and my bf by name. I hope Little Miss Saigon flourishes and stays forever!

"I had the opportunity to order take out from LMS the other day. I have recently returned from a trip to Vietnam so my expectations were high! I ordered the Garden Roll as well as a few sandwiches... The loss of 1 star is due to two things:1. I didn't taste the sweet ""pickled"" flavor of the carrots or cucumber as I did in traditional Banh Mi - I believe they were raw, and unpickled. 2. I had a random HOT pepper hidden in my sandwich that I didn't see however it was SO hot that it pretty much destroyed my tastebuds/mouth!I did enjoy the meal over all and it is good to see some more Asian flare coming into the neighborhood!

"You know that scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark where Indiana Jones grabs the artifact and gets chased by the boulder?

It's a win-win.You can taste their quality ingredients and they make easily one of the top banh mis in NYC (I should know, I've hit up pretty much every banh mi shop in town).

"Really glad to have bahn mi in the neighborhood! It's the perfect, affordable thing we've been missing. I like that they're open til 9 and have a tofu option - it's fake chicken. I'd love to see fake pork (like Hanco's) added, or even just grilled/plain tofu added, but that's minor.",5.0
"I've had all of the sandwiches and the grilled pork is my favorite. All the bubble teas are great, too, they can be either iced or hot. Friendly staff too.",5.0
Amazing lil spot! Super friendly owner and staff. The LMS special and grilled pork bahn mi sandwiches are to die for! Big portions for a great price. Plus they have bubble tea! Get your fix of Viet and bubble tea here~,5.0
The staff here is so nice and was so accommodating. It was delicious as well.,5.0
"I really really wanted to like this place, but after trying three of the sandwiches don't think we'll be going back, at least not for the sandwiches. Yeah, the bread is a good size and really excellent, but they have a real problem with the quantity and distribution of filling. Flavors were there, but the bread dominated all the sandwiches. We opened up the shredded chicken one and there were literally five small shreds of chicken with a spattering of cilantro leaves and pickled vegetables. Plus, they're NOT the only banh mi in the neighborhood. Bashi Channel on Cortelyou has one for only a dollar more (although only one kind), but I definitely think we'll opt for that in the future. Interested if others who have given it a shot had the same experience. We were really hoping for something along the lines of Sau Voi in lower Manhattan or what you get in Sunset Park, but just feel it didn't measure up. But I know they just opened and maybe they were running low on some ingredients and trying to stretch them or something, so will probably give it another shot in a few months to see if anything's changed. But pretty disappointed overall.",2.0
