"I don't really know how to describe how much I love La Vara. I'm more than a little partial because this is where we went to celebrate our engagement after a long walk through Prospect Park, Park Slope, a couple Hill neighborhoods, but that partiality speaks more to my fiancé and my love of the place from before that thrilling moment.You probably want to try for a reservation because it's teeny, and if you're lucky, it'll be a nice day and you will get the honor of a back patio seat.The portions are small, and it's a little expensive. That said, it's a place I know I can count on for an amaaaaaaaazing special treat of a meal.After you order (do get a cocktail, even the simple gin Kas is refreshingly delightful), they bring a tiny amuse bouche. A nice start.The fried artichoke, daily croqueta, and sobresada con miel are our staple ""first course"" tapas. Now, they don't always come out in that order, but they're on the ever so slightly less rich side of the menu, so that's how my brain maps them. The honey with the sobresada is foamed and oh sooooo good.The suckling pig shouldn't be missed out on. It's a pretty simple preparation and the herby green sauce cuts through the fat nicely. We usually get one or two more of the smaller dinner plates, none of which have been disappointing.And olive oil ice cream. OHHH that olive oil ice cream. I have tried on a couple occasions to make it at home since it is my favorite ice cream (and I love, love, love ice cream), but I keep having to come back here. Do make sure to save room for this dessert, or don't because it's more likely there will be some left if I come on the same night. :P",5.0
"La Vara is a cute, tapas style restaurant nestled in Cobble Hill.  Adorable looking place. Great service. I really want to love the food, but was sorely disappointed.  Okay, I mean, I didn't hate everything - the alcachofas were delicious.  I loved the croqueta - they were so flavorful and texture was perfect. I was not impressed with migas aragonesas - it was very oily, and I felt like I was eating a medley of onions.  The lamb meatballs were okay - a little dry, gamey.    The biggest disappointment was grilled octopus that we ordered - it was obviously not fresh and was slimy.  It was a real turnoff for the meal.",3.0
"I came here on a Friday night around 10pm and even though the place was small, we didn't have to wait too long to get a seat at the bar. However, I can imagine a reservation being necessary during peak hours. They serve small portioned plates, so I would advise getting multiple things - which takes its toll on your bank account if you are also buying drinks - which you definitely should, but so worth it!I was there with one other person so we ordered four things and shared them all:Alcachofas (fried artichokes with anchovy aoili) $9 : So delicious, the artichokes were fried perfectly and not burnt and the aoili complemented them without being overpowering. We were tempted to order a second round, but this was the first dish to come out so we decided to wait and see if we would still be hungy. Berenjena con miel  (Crispy eggplant with honey, melted cheese, and nigella seeds) $9: Also very tasty, the eggplant was exactly as described - crispy, but not overbreaded nor did it feel oily. The honey was a nice sweet bite and the cheese gave the dish a slight tanginess (the leftover cheese was great on top of the bread they serve) I just wish it was a little  more melted. Huevos Rellenos (devlied eggs, green tahini) $5: Not my favorite part of the night, I wasn't the biggest fan of the green tahini sauce on top and it was just a deviled egg which I don't find to be something very specialFideua (Valencian style noodle paella, shrimp, squid, clams, aoili) $18: One of the best dishes we had that night. Since we were sitting at the bar right next to all the waitresses, one of them told us to mix everything together rather than how it was served. I've never had paella with aoili before, but it was so good, I wish the serving was larger. But let's be honest what doesn't aoili taste good with?The drinks were also well made and the staff was very friendly and had good tips for us throughout the meal and also what their favorite dishes are so we can try it when we come back. Overall a very good experience that I would bring a small group to where you can share food and drinks and chat!",4.0
"Overall: overpriced small portions that are unimpressiveCucumber salad - Just a simple salad with feta cheese.Lamb meatballs - Packed with spices.Stuffed Rabbit - Tender and chewy, but comes in only 3 small pieces.Pork - The best thing I've eaten here that is also decently sized. Super crispy outside and full of flavor.Dessert Special - Dough donut with ice cream with espresso poured over it. Dough donut and ice cream by itself would've been awesome, but they went and ruined it. The espresso made the donut super soggy and bitter. Who likes a soggy, bitter donut?? This was the worst dessert I've ever had.",2.0
"La Vara might just be one of my new favorite spots. It's a lovely little restaurant on a charming street in Cobble Hill...cozy and warm inside and not a table was open on a Saturday night. Bad timing brought the health inspector right during our meal, which meant the kitchen was temporarily shut for a little bit but the staff was friendly and gracious and brought out delicious crispy spiced chickpeas for all the tables to nibble on while we waited.We opted to share a bunch of plates between three people. Highlights included the fried artichokes with anchovy aioli (so perfectly lightly fried), the cumin lamb, and the house made Catalan sausage (don't miss this dish!). Oh, and the shrimp! Quite pricey at $10.50 per shrimp but these are the jumbo kind, head and shell on, cooked in preserved lemon, and dripping with juices when you pull the head off. Totally messy and delicious. The dessert, too, was sublime and I highly recommend the almond cake and the olive oil sea salt ice cream - they went perfectly together! Looking forward to returning and trying more dinner items and their famous brunch.",5.0
"As many people probably already mentioned, La Vara was definitely not some place where you get high end delicate food with marvelous decoration; however this special cute place did offer me a feeling of relaxation on a sunny Saturday morning, the exact feeling I was looking for after a long tired week.My friend and I were sharing many small dishes. Carajillo, the donut bathed in coffee was for sure my favorite. For entrees, I went with others' selection and chose the local squid and scrambled cod (so tender!!). All courses were fantastic and fed me well!Service was also adding extra credit. As a Michelin-starred restaurant, I think La Vara did a very good job in terms of presenting decent local food, rather than focusing on presentation.",5.0
"In a quiet area of Cobble Hill, La Vara is understated but quite a find even in an area known for its restaurants, walkable streets, and beautiful architecture. Since we went on Valentines Day the menu was prix fixe but I'll make the assumption that the quality and service are similar otherwise. This is one of the best dining experiences I've had in New York and elsewhere, and I will absolutely be back for a less formal occasion.The food was complex, richly Spanish, and remarkably delicious, presented nicely without trying too hard. Over 6 shared courses we tried a huge variety of meat, seafood, and vegetable plates, including (my favorite) seared duck, seafood stew, octopus, eggplant, pâté, clam, leeks, and olives, all paired (almost) perfectly with 8 different glasses of wine and sherry, ending with a simple but satisfying dessert of chocolate mousse and fruity sorbet.The service was great, timely, and comforting, though slightly unorganized for the event-oriented dinner, but attentive, happy, and more than willing to answer any questions. Everything was knowledgeably explained which led to us enjoying the meal that extra amount to make this easily a 5-star experience. The setting is simple but refined, lit well for the occasion, and situated in the perfect location to leave an unforgettable dinner and take a long walk through beautiful Cobble Hill (even in sub-zero temperatures).",5.0
"I had dinner here with my parents and my boyfriend when my parents were visiting NYC. It's not cheap, so it's a great place to go when your parents are treating you! :) I made us a reservation about a week in advance, which I would recommend since the place is small. There are two booths by the windows in the front-perfect for larger groups. There is also seating at the bar, and then one table that seats probably 10 people, and then a small number of 2 person tables behind that. We sat at the 10 person table (be prepared to sit close to other parties!) The hostess and our waiter were both very welcoming and patient. The food came out at a good pace and our waiter even offered to chill our bottle of wine to my dad's liking. The space felt clean and simple in the best way. The exposed brick, the lighting, the minimalist decor, and the white furniture were all perfect. Now for the food! We had: -spiced fried chickpeas -- We loved these!! They had a lot of flavor--cumin, I think? They were so simple but super flavorful and addicting.-cucumber and grain salad -- Also really yummy! Again, super simple but flavorful and refreshing. A nice contrast to the salty and fried dishes. -noodle paella -- Not my favorite. Didn't have much flavor. -Catalan sausage -- This was good except that I was expecting one large sausage. This was a skinny sausage wound around a few times. -Spanish red shrimp -- Really good! Each plate comes with 2 large shrimp-lots of flavor. Expensive though. -duck special -- Delicious! This was done perfectly. I only wish we'd ordered the suckling pig! We meant to but forgot by the end of the meal. For dessert we had tres leches flavored custard. This is was okay but I would probably get the ice cream or almond cake next time. Tapas style places are nice because they draw out the meal and allow people to just sit, relax, and talk. No one is in a rush or busy scarfing down their meal because each plate comes out as it's ready, and everyone just eats a little of each one. We had a really wonderful dinner here! My only complaint is that it does get loud, so don't go with anyone who is hard of hearing!",4.0
"La Vara has been in my to-try list for more than a year before I finally got to check it out last night. And it did not disappoint!The restaurant is located on a quiet, tree lined street in Cobble Hill BK. I already felt welcome the moment I stepped inside. This is my fav neighborhood in BK in terms of food - you got Battersby, Dover, Bergen Hill and many others around court street and smith! And unlike popular restaurants in Manhattan, the acclaimed restaurants in this hood are less hustle bustle, more tranquil and neighborly charm. Once I seated at the bar, the friendly bar tender promptly passed me the wine and food menu. Too bad I forgot to ask her name :/ she's so lovely and gave good recommendations for food - can't ask for better services! Onto the food. I am especially liking that there are quite a few daily specials to choose from , in addition to the many options on the stable menu. I opted for the house salted cod salad and the beef tongue stew that was special of the day. Both are excellent!The cod salad was light yet pack of flavors! I adore the nutty smokey flavors from the pistachio oil drizzle over the salad - it goes hand in hand with the fresh citrus and sweet pomegranate that accompany the cod, it's magical! I can't describe it but I can def taste and enjoy it immensely :)Now the beef tongue. It brings me back all the good memories of Barcelona! The soft beef tongue are chopped in small chunks, dotted in a hearty caper tomato sauce decorated with carrots and sweet pea. It reminds me of the beef stew in Dublin which is considered peasant food but it delivers such a heart-warming effect especially in a chill autumn night. I paired it with a Spanish Grenache and they work quite well together.The only regret I had was that I went by myself and I could only tried two dishes while every item on the menu looked amazing! I shall come back soon!",4.0
"I wanted to love this place, but just didn't.The chickpeas were salty and I just felt like the food was meh. It was good but nothing super special.Most dishes have egg in them (which I don't eat) and made it difficult for me.The staff was soooo sooo sooo nice though and accomodating.It was a really pleasant experience though.",3.0
"I went to La Vara for brunch (hold your groans) because they didn't have any other reservations available for a Saturday (call/reserve early and often!).The space is cute, and very nondescript (especially for a Michelin starred restaurant), but that's part of the charm. There's exposed brick, tiled ceilings and a cute bar.Anyway, since it was brunch time, had to start out with Bloody Mary's (not on the menu, but basically half the patrons were sipping on them). They were delicious (and SPICY).For food, started out with the patatas bravas. They were fried well but too heavy. Maybe skip this one if you're not ravenous.For mains, they have a lot of egg dishes and variations. Shared two of them. The Tortellita de Gambas (Andalucian shrimp and a chickpea wafer with a fried egg on top) was definitely Spanish-inspired and unique. If you don't get freaked out by crispy tiny shrimp, then this is a great dish. It was over a chickpea wafer, which added a lot of texture and was a nice detour from standard toast or crostini.Also had the Huevos con Migas Aragonesas (poached eggs with chorizo and bread crumbs). Eggs were poached well, and the salty chorizo chunks and sweet roasted grapes were a good contrast.Service was great, and I would definitely come back to try their dinner menu (which everyone tells me I should've done originally). Oh well, a guy's gotta eat.",4.0
"KenScale: 8.5/10La Vara has long been on my hit list of Brooklyn restaurants. Helmed by chef Alex Raij and her husband Eder Montero (whose other restaurant El Quinto Pino I visited last year and enjoyed my meal), it has been gaining acclaim for its reinterpretation of Spanish cuisine with Moorish and Jewish touch. On my recent dinner, I couldn't quite pinpoint how different influences were all coming together, but didn't really care because the food at La Vara is generally outstanding.The dinner menu consists of mostly shareable tapas plates. Spiced fried chickpeas would be a great snack anywhere at a Spanish restaurant, and the crispy eggplant with honey and melted cheese was also wonderful with its rich complexity of flavor within a single bite. Migas aragonesas, a dish of hand torn bread and chorizo, grapes, rosemary and pastured egg, was another winner. I was deeply impressed with how the different ingredients were coming together yet the dish itself wasn't that heavy but rather delightful and fun. Fideua, a noodle style paella that came with shrimp, squid and clams, also had a nice touch, although I wish the portion were slightly larger. Spanish red shrimp a la plancha was rather small compared to the somewhat hefty price ($21 per two on my last visit), but the crunchy texture of the shrimp was still memorable and I probably could've had at least 5 more of those. On the other hand, pollo asado, a giant half chicken roasted over spiced onions and cumin, was more satisfying in portion and I did like the spicy kick of the otherwise nicely cooked chicken. The winner of the meal on my visit, however, cumin roasted lamb breast. I was absolutely in love with the juicy texture of the meat with great balance of flavor thanks to simple preserved lemon-date condiment. All of the dessert dishes that my dining party tried were great as well. None of them were overly sweet; from homemade olive oil ice cream to Galician almond cake. The best of the bunch was this dish called Egipcio that consisted of orange blossom scented date walnut tart, lemon curd and sweet cream. It was absolutely delicious and I couldn't stop digging it!The restaurant, located on a quiet corner of Carroll Gardens, has that cozy neighborhood vibe of a typical restaurant in Brooklyn that I love so much about. Getting a reservation wasn't that difficult, although the restaurant became quickly packed by the start of my meal. There is extensive Spanish wine selection (unfortunately I don't know much about Spanish wine, but the bottle of white that we was crisp and worked well with various dishes). La Vara is one of those places that I would love to come back either for full dinner or even quick wine and snack time. The cooking here is serious and elegant, especially in easily shareable format where you can get a taste of a large number of dishes to explore the culinary beauty of Spain.",4.0
"Very nice restaurant! I never been to a Spanish restaurant before, but I would recommend this one to my friends. The portion of the food doesn't really match the price, but it is good for a fancy dinner out. Plus, the waitress lady was really nice! She was very patient and explained everything I didn't understand. I would totally go back just because of the service!",4.0
"Having eat at both Txikito and El Quinto Pino multiple times, I was excited to eat at La Vara. And I was not disappointed. The spot has a great energy and we were able to book a 4 top at 7:30pm on a Wednesday night without much difficulty. Unlike other places that block off their prime reservation times from opentable or other online reservation systems, La Vara was happy to have us. The waitress was fantastic. Very helpful with ordering and with drinks, especially wines. She knew the menu extremely well and could describe things beautifully. This kind of service is one of the keys to getting a Michelin star and something many other NYC restaurants lack in their experience. We ordered nearly half the menu, but the definite highlights were those others have mentioned - the fried artichokes, the eggplant, the big ol' slab suckling pig. Enjoyed every single dish we had. Only sadness was that we ran out of room before we could eat the entire menu. Wine recommendations were great. A rose from Lebanon was a particular revelation. Tried the draft sherry and have to say that was a miss, but it was my own choice. It's dry and tart and a bit punchy. Prices were reasonable for the quality of the food and the entire experience. Dinner + drinks worked out to less than $100/person. Hope to get back again to try the rest of the menu.",5.0
"Been wanting to try this place out for a long time. Finally, I get my chance, and what do I do? Eat brunch here. Ugh, I'm still shaking my head over that one.Go to a tapas place, eat tapas. Not the same brunch eggs that every other restaurant in Brooklyn will be serving on a Saturday afternoon. Although to be fair, their egg dishes are way more interesting.Oh well. So we started off Bloody Mary's which were great. We ordered a few dishes to share: patatas bravas,  Huevos con Migas Aragonesa, and Tortellita de Gambas. The patatas bravas were solid, but a little overcooked and overall kind of unmemorable. The Huevos con Migas Aragonesa was a dish of fried eggs, chorizo, bread crumbs, seared grapes, and sweet onion, which to me sounds like the best stuffing ever, topped with eggs. It was quite delicious despite that the chorizo made the dish a tad salty. The Tortellita was also pretty yummy, with eggs, a chickpea ""wafer"" and dried shrimp. Service was great and the experience was enjoyable despite the presence of screaming babies, but the true experience will be when I come back for dinner!",4.0
"I must say that I had good good food at La Vara. The place is unique, cozy and welcoming.

With good wine, you will enjoy here.Many interesting dishes to select from, and the starters are as good as the place.  We took the waiter recommendation (Excellent service), and everything went smooth, delicious and enjoyable.

"Yeah... This place is cute as hell and concur with my fellow Yelpers. This is not the mission I'm on, My mission, if you will is to drink a cocktail after the Yankees lost with my buds.

The older uptight folks are being replaced with this younger mind set.This is not the case with La Vara. We walk in and everyone is eating and enjoying the food. We slide to the back of the bar and this old, frog face manager tells us we need to move to the front of the bar. He's all eyes on us. I can sense his Sith Hatred. We're not tattoos bikers and we're not loud. What gives dummy? The bartender is ignoring us and this dude is watching us like a hawk. Now I wanna grab the guy and take a picture with him. (Singing - Why ya gotta be so rude..)We had three cocktail, left a tip and split. If I was a 15 years younger, I would have grabbed this guy and kissed him on his stupid bald head while my buddies laughed and snapped a picture. They didn't have cell phone cameras back then..

"Unlike some of the other reviewers, I WILDLY enjoyed my first experience at La Vara, about a month after they opened.  It was a birthday dinner there (for myself) and the meal was delicious and memorable in all the best ways.  Exquisite execution of unique dishes and ingredients.  A quality meal and great service.  I very much looked forward to returning.Fast-forward to NYE 2014.  I tried to book La Vara for a NYE dinner, about two months in advance of the date.  They accepted my reservation.  I sat smug and looked forward to the meal.  About a week later, they left me a voicemail saying they decided not to be open that night, and, oh well...sorry!  Admittedly, I landed on my feet with a reservation at Brooklyn Fare for NYE, but still, why take orders for a special dining night and then decide to close?  That was a head scratcher.Fast-forward to last week.  My fiancé and I are moving out of the neighborhood and I had been telling him about my amazing La Vara meal for so long I thought I should treat him to a dinner there before we upped sticks entirely.  The meal was 'meh' for both of us.  The portions have become ridiculously small for the price.  We ordered three smaller plates and two larger, and then ordered a third larger dish to try and achieve that happy-full feeling.  Of the smaller plates, the fried artichokes stood out, but mainly because nothing else did.  The biggest offender was the anchovy dish that arrived with 4 slivers of anchovy and 3 pieces of bread to eat them with.  For a table of 2.  I mean, come on La Vara.  You couldn't have sprung for that 4th disc of baguette?  Pitiful.  Our third smaller plate was the anchovy dish which looked like a puddle of watery tomato and a few headless fish drowning in it's lifeless waters. At this point I was hoping for a miracle with the other dishes, but it never happened.For larger plates, we ordered the rabbit loin (which was tender, but the accompanying compote/salad was overly sweet).  The Red Spanish prawns (TWO PRAWNS.  TWO.  ONE - TWO.  THAT'S IT.) were delicious, but there were TWO.   And, the pasta paella.  They use a matchstick shape of pasta that looked (and tasted) a bit like Lipton Cup O'Soup.  Not that I think they use this there, but you could basically get the same mouth feel and flavor sensation buying a packet of the soup and added a couple of chewy clams and the teeniest sliver of calamari.We did not stay for dessert as most of the options were dull and predictable.  We saw one of the fig cakes being brought out to a neighboring table, but it looked like little more than a big Fig Newton with a splodge of cream on it.  Five stars for our server, who was exceedingly friendly and pleasant.  2 stars for the food.",3.0
"I don't know if it was La Vara's fault or mine that I didn't enjoy my first experience with them two years ago, right when they opened. But life is about second chances. I believe it was the poet laureate Two Chainz who said that: ""My whole story is just about me having a second chance.""*This whole story is about La Vara having a second chance. And in my past few visits, they've killed it. Since their inception, the space itself has become more inviting (I love their garden immensely), and the service more welcoming. Most importantly, the consistency of the food has improved considerably.The menu changes often, and it's entirely likely that you could make a meal out of the intriguing specials available. Some of my favorite items have been seasonally available, such as the summer squash fritters or the torn bread served with chorizo oil and grapes. I've never seen more gorgeous deviled eggs than the ones La Vara served with green sauce, and the daily croquetas are never a bad decision.One item that tends to be a staple is the fried artichokes. I'm never sad about dipping into this salty, fatty bomb of flavor, and the bacon paprika stew is a similarly solid choice.Regardless of what you order, however, you are virtually guaranteed a meal of intensely flavorful, beautifully presented small plates. And although you may want more of any given dish, it's just as well that they are tiny portions. Not merely because almost everything is quite rich, but also because this affords you the opportunity to taste more items coming out of this kitchen, and that's a good thing. ______________*He also said, ""My wrist deserve a shout out, I'm like, 'What up wrist?' My stove deserve a shout out, I'm like, 'What up stove?'"" Less relevant to this review, although now that I think about it, La Vara's stove deserves a shout out. I'm like, 'What up La Vara's stove?'",4.0
"I love love love La Vara! I have been coming since they opened in 2012 and have yet to be disappointed. Their food reflects the highest standards of quality, and the flavors are so unique. Though I love the menu mainstays, like the Conejo (yes, their rabbit is good enough to make you forget about Peter) or the Escalivada (omg their romesco is insane), it's their specials that always interest me the most. You really get a sense that the chefs and sous chefs are engaging with the ""story"" of La Vara in unexpected ways. The last time I was in (admittedly a few months ago) I had the Huevos Escalfados special, which had these really dark and earthy foraged mushrooms and the smoothest poached egg imaginable. But what really stole the show was the cauliflower! It was flash fried (who knew that cauliflower could be so good?) and then laid on top of a sauce which I think was also cauliflower. Too good. You guys have to go, the hype is real and that Michelin star is definitely earned.",5.0

With good wine, you will enjoy here.Many interesting dishes to select from, and the starters are as good as the place.  We took the waiter recommendation (Excellent service), and everything went smooth, delicious and enjoyable. I could tell that they do a lot so each person who visit here will leave happy, and I can say that IO left happy, and I will return happy.",5.0
"Yeah... This place is cute as hell and concur with my fellow Yelpers. This is not the mission I'm on, My mission, if you will is to drink a cocktail after the Yankees lost with my buds. (Go Yankees!)I pass this place and there's a bar. Bar=Beer right? Also, I like a front of the house hipster hostess. With hipster hostesses, anything goes and no one is judgmental. The older uptight folks are being replaced with this younger mind set.This is not the case with La Vara. We walk in and everyone is eating and enjoying the food. We slide to the back of the bar and this old, frog face manager tells us we need to move to the front of the bar. He's all eyes on us. I can sense his Sith Hatred. We're not tattoos bikers and we're not loud. What gives dummy? The bartender is ignoring us and this dude is watching us like a hawk. Now I wanna grab the guy and take a picture with him. (Singing - Why ya gotta be so rude..)We had three cocktail, left a tip and split. If I was a 15 years younger, I would have grabbed this guy and kissed him on his stupid bald head while my buddies laughed and snapped a picture. They didn't have cell phone cameras back then.. La Vara, Nice place to not grab a drink with your buddies, especially the one wearing a Mets Jersey.",2.0
"Unlike some of the other reviewers, I WILDLY enjoyed my first experience at La Vara, about a month after they opened.  It was a birthday dinner there (for myself) and the meal was delicious and memorable in all the best ways.  Exquisite execution of unique dishes and ingredients.  A quality meal and great service.  I very much looked forward to returning.Fast-forward to NYE 2014.  I tried to book La Vara for a NYE dinner, about two months in advance of the date.  They accepted my reservation.  I sat smug and looked forward to the meal.  About a week later, they left me a voicemail saying they decided not to be open that night, and, oh well...sorry!  Admittedly, I landed on my feet with a reservation at Brooklyn Fare for NYE, but still, why take orders for a special dining night and then decide to close?  That was a head scratcher.Fast-forward to last week.  My fiancé and I are moving out of the neighborhood and I had been telling him about my amazing La Vara meal for so long I thought I should treat him to a dinner there before we upped sticks entirely.  The meal was 'meh' for both of us.  The portions have become ridiculously small for the price.  We ordered three smaller plates and two larger, and then ordered a third larger dish to try and achieve that happy-full feeling.  Of the smaller plates, the fried artichokes stood out, but mainly because nothing else did.  The biggest offender was the anchovy dish that arrived with 4 slivers of anchovy and 3 pieces of bread to eat them with.  For a table of 2.  I mean, come on La Vara.  You couldn't have sprung for that 4th disc of baguette?  Pitiful.  Our third smaller plate was the anchovy dish which looked like a puddle of watery tomato and a few headless fish drowning in it's lifeless waters. At this point I was hoping for a miracle with the other dishes, but it never happened.For larger plates, we ordered the rabbit loin (which was tender, but the accompanying compote/salad was overly sweet).  The Red Spanish prawns (TWO PRAWNS.  TWO.  ONE - TWO.  THAT'S IT.) were delicious, but there were TWO.   And, the pasta paella.  They use a matchstick shape of pasta that looked (and tasted) a bit like Lipton Cup O'Soup.  Not that I think they use this there, but you could basically get the same mouth feel and flavor sensation buying a packet of the soup and added a couple of chewy clams and the teeniest sliver of calamari.We did not stay for dessert as most of the options were dull and predictable.  We saw one of the fig cakes being brought out to a neighboring table, but it looked like little more than a big Fig Newton with a splodge of cream on it.  Five stars for our server, who was exceedingly friendly and pleasant.  2 stars for the food.",3.0
"I don't know if it was La Vara's fault or mine that I didn't enjoy my first experience with them two years ago, right when they opened. But life is about second chances. I believe it was the poet laureate Two Chainz who said that: ""My whole story is just about me having a second chance.""*This whole story is about La Vara having a second chance. And in my past few visits, they've killed it. Since their inception, the space itself has become more inviting (I love their garden immensely), and the service more welcoming. Most importantly, the consistency of the food has improved considerably.The menu changes often, and it's entirely likely that you could make a meal out of the intriguing specials available. Some of my favorite items have been seasonally available, such as the summer squash fritters or the torn bread served with chorizo oil and grapes. I've never seen more gorgeous deviled eggs than the ones La Vara served with green sauce, and the daily croquetas are never a bad decision.One item that tends to be a staple is the fried artichokes. I'm never sad about dipping into this salty, fatty bomb of flavor, and the bacon paprika stew is a similarly solid choice.Regardless of what you order, however, you are virtually guaranteed a meal of intensely flavorful, beautifully presented small plates. And although you may want more of any given dish, it's just as well that they are tiny portions. Not merely because almost everything is quite rich, but also because this affords you the opportunity to taste more items coming out of this kitchen, and that's a good thing. ______________*He also said, ""My wrist deserve a shout out, I'm like, 'What up wrist?' My stove deserve a shout out, I'm like, 'What up stove?'"" Less relevant to this review, although now that I think about it, La Vara's stove deserves a shout out. I'm like, 'What up La Vara's stove?'",4.0
"I love love love La Vara! I have been coming since they opened in 2012 and have yet to be disappointed. Their food reflects the highest standards of quality, and the flavors are so unique. Though I love the menu mainstays, like the Conejo (yes, their rabbit is good enough to make you forget about Peter) or the Escalivada (omg their romesco is insane), it's their specials that always interest me the most. You really get a sense that the chefs and sous chefs are engaging with the ""story"" of La Vara in unexpected ways. The last time I was in (admittedly a few months ago) I had the Huevos Escalfados special, which had these really dark and earthy foraged mushrooms and the smoothest poached egg imaginable. But what really stole the show was the cauliflower! It was flash fried (who knew that cauliflower could be so good?) and then laid on top of a sauce which I think was also cauliflower. Too good. You guys have to go, the hype is real and that Michelin star is definitely earned.",5.0
"La Vara is Michelin Starred? Damn! And I thought I was cool, checking out this Jewish/Spanish fusion in Cobble Hill...but apparently I'm way behind.Went to La Vara mid-week with a group of friends, and had no problem getting seated right away at a beautiful round table by the window.  The place is tiny, but bright, and I spotted a back garden for brunching outside.  Our waitress was tremendously helpful and very attentive - excellent service.  We tried everything on the menu - the fried chickpeas, artichokes, sobrasada con miel (pork with honey bruschetta,) the fiduea (noodle paella,) eggplant, deviled eggs, foie gras, some kind of caramelized onion flatbread, and octopus.  Like any self-respecting blogger, I tried everything.My favorite was actually the pork with honey bruschetta - the foamed honey was really surprising and sweet.  Artichokes with anchovy butter were a surprising winner too.  We ordered duplicates of some dishes, wine, sangria, and I started sweating - ""Guys, this bill is going to be, like, $600!""  Not the case.  It was even affordable (by NYC standards.)  Check it out with a small group or a date.  The townhouses around that area are enviable as well.",4.0
"We came here for a private event where there was passed plates and a set bar drink menu.  Very impressive.  To me, the fried skate was the best.  Fried perfectly, seasoned well, and quality fish.  the fideua was good, not the best I've had, but still had a good flavor.  I had some mimosas which were heavy on the champagne in a good way.  The best thing about the place was the service.  Very pleasant and kept our large group very full with food and drink.  I would definitely go back for dinner.",4.0

Definitely check those two out if you can!A note on service...the bartender was ridiculously knowledgeable and friendly, and when we asked about their very unusual sherry she launched into a mini lesson on the history of their particular offering.

To be fair, the drinks were good and the staff nice, yet not engaging.I am writing this review for the owner/chef who I know is amazing and probably isn't there as much to pay attention for small details in the kitchen which have made the food go downhill.After ordering, we were presented with a small amuse bouche of carrot juice and cumin in a sherry glass. This alone started the meal off poorly, the opposite of the amuse point. It was flavorless and cold. We wish it just didn't come out at all. We started with the fried eggplant with honey and cheese which was one of my favorites previously. There was too much cheese, the eggplant was not crispy and not sweet enough. The chicken hearts were good but it was a very small bite more of a snack than an appetizer and not worth $13. The migas (also one we raved about in past visits) had too much paprika and not enough grapes; it was not exciting. The croquettes of the day which were described as Serrano ham were actually some bland potato/cheese fried mush.. Not distinguishable and definitely no ham involved. The last dish, Lingua special was the worst of all. Arrived after 45 min sitting and wasn't sure it was even the right cut. It tasted like regular beef and was very chewy. The carrots were undercooked as well. Also small for the price, $18 for a tiny stew.

"I rarely make a bad review. Perhaps if we got to taste the menu this may change. Sunday evening I had been planning to take my fiancee to this newly michelin starred restaurant, so much so I thought i would book a month in advance in order to make sure we had a good evening.

I walk up to the servers chatting to each other and I let them know i had a reservation for 2 for 8pm.

They've earned Michelin stars yet it's still a casual vibe so that whether you are passing by for a casual bite or planning a special dinner, it always feels right.all of their waitstaff treats you like family yet they have the knowledge and expertise of true professionals, the delicious menu is absolutely singular.",5.0
"This place was really good. I had food combinations I've never thought of before. I'll start by saying they need another extra toilet and service was just fine, I wasn't overly wowed.Eggplant with cheese was sweet and comforting. Fried artichokes tasted almost like meat it was so complex in flavours. The stand out for me, although the rest at my table didn't like it, was this cod, orange, olives, cheese and pomegranate salad. It is rare in life that you have something you've never had anything like it before. I am still thinking about this whacky dish from days ago. Chicken was boring. Dessert was too. Stick to apps and fish.",4.0
"Cute place! We sat at the bar and I enjoyed my glass of sangria while waiting for A. For some reason, I found myself enjoying it a lot more in the beginning, while it somehow got stronger towards the end. Anyway, a huge + for this place because A actually enjoyed our meal here very much. We shared the fried artichokes with the suckling pig and the suckling pig was delicious! It's definitely a small portion for the price ($30) but it was definitely worth trying. Super nice bartender too. :)",4.0
"This is a great place to have a pretty affordable Michelin star experience in NYC.I've been to La Vara twice now. The first time with a couple friends, the bartender was exemplary and shared so much with us about the sherry that they have. A couple weeks later took my mom there when she was visiting the city because I knew the experience I would be getting. Made a note to get the fried artichokes and the suckling pig again the second time, but didn't have a plate either time I wouldn't get again. The space is great on a quaint street in Brooklyn and the service is remarkable. Make a reservation and get out to Cobble Hill.",5.0
"My fiancé and I just came to eat here... we didn't want large amounts of food so we searched for a place that offers small plates and came across this gem. We ordered the crispy artichoke, the crispy eggplant, the zucchini pancakes, the deviled eggs (all 10/10's), the ground goat with pasta, the swiss chard wraps and the date tart for dessert (7/10's). If you're looking to be stuffed this place isn't for you because all of the portions are really small... even having ordered all of that between the two of us, we could still go for another meal or two!Overall we loved the ambiance as well at the service and would highly recommend! I would suggest making a reservation because the place is a cozy size and they can get pretty busy making the wait long.",4.0
"This is an amazing dinner place! Been here a bunch and never disappointed.It can get a little expensive because the plates are meant for sharing and very very yummy so you end up ordering half the menu but its well worth it!I expected the brunch to be just as good as dinner but it wasn't, stick to trying this place for dinner first.tip: they don't usually take reservations for 2 on weekends so walk over, put your name down and walk to a bar on court to wait..",5.0

The dinner menu has changed a little since my first visit a year and half ago, but they have nightly specials. I liked the fried eggplant, the remojon salad, the lamb meatballs, and the roasted pig. As someone mentioned below, the egipcio is a cookie-biscuit thing versus a tart that most people think of (sweet filling with a pastry crust). I'm not a big fan of this as it could be dry.

"Second time around went for brunch so I can finally get my hands on those churros. Had the fried chickpeas, poached eggs with grapes and ham and finally the churros. Chickpeas were well seasoned and great when mixed with the ham and grapes and egg dish which was a delicious example of a savory and sweet combo. Finally the churros came three a piece with a side of dulce de leche sauce. OMG, they were awesome. Light and crispy and sweet enough that I didn't need to use too much of the sauce which was a bummer because I wanted to finish the sauce. They don't have the olive oil ice cream until dinner; maybe next time I'll see if they have any ice cream just so I can have with the sauce.

I celebrated my birthday at La Vara with about 14 friends.  The place is small but they were able to set several tables together for our party.   The service was accommodating and the food so delicious especially the noodle paella.  Their gin and tonic's were really good too.  We had a great time!!  My friends all loved the food.  The one disappointment was that they had booked a second large party right after us and they insisted they had a two hour table turnover.  It was so disappointing as my friends had traveled far to make dinner.   I wish they would have told us in advance.  But I guess that's life in Brooklyn these days.,4.0
"A tapas restaurant with the pedigree of Txikito, but approaching it by way of Moorish and Jewish influences.  Tucked discreetly in a quiet, residential Cobble Hill block, La Vara is a cozy place of exposed brick contrasting with white.  Suited for small groups and quiet dinners, although there are two banquette tables by the windows for larger groups as well as some bar seats.  This low-key restaurant quickly garnered attention after opening, and seemed deserving of it at my visit.Lengthy menu divided into snacks (pica pica), fried (fritos), breads (panes), cold (frios y ensalata), hot (calientes), and desserts (postres), with full ingredient lists of each.  Be ready for the list of specials.  As your server describes each, it may sound nearly as long as the print menu.  As typical of NYC tapas, portions vary, but few are likely to approach standard entree sizes.  Most are sized for sharing among small groups of 2 - 4, and this is the best course to take.The food was lovely to lay eyes on, colors and textures arranged or mounded to create a beautiful palette in every dish.  Flavors were no disappointment, with great use of textures.  Among the refreshing, there were tender artichokes and fava beans bound by a silky poached egg and showered in bits of crisped crumbs.  A tower of fried mini shrimp cluster atop a smooth cubed cucumber and tomato salad, contrasting perfectly.  Quail eggs served with green tahini touched with olive oil make a good snack; a plus that the diner peels them, in my opinion.  Croquetas, varying each day, came in a pair, well-fried and tasty.Rich, lingering flavors can be found in a simple dish of earthy anchovies soaked in good olive oil, doused with sesame and crushed hazelnuts, great with charred toast.  The migas, a dish of chunks of chorizo, bread crumbs, grapes, onions, and capers was a wondrous riot of flavors savory, sweet, and sour, and very fragrant.Perhaps the most memorable dish was a special, the Perol de Verduras.  This layered vegetable dish highlights the best of La Vara: well-cooked, fresh ingredients, combinations that both contrast and complement in flavor and textures, with a delicious sauce.  And a sight to behold.  It deserves a permanent place on the menu.La Vara is a wonderful tapas place, and the best in Brooklyn, although arguably competition is lacking.  The food is inventive and fantastically made.  As expected with tapas, the cost will add up with multiple plates so plan accordingly, but hardly unexpected for the quality of execution.  At its tiny size and limited reservation policy, come early and with no more than a party of four.",4.0
"Love La Vara!  Great culinary creativity for tapas from Chef Alex Raij and Eder Montero. The Chelsea places are a bit more traditional (El Quinto Pinto, Txikito), but come to La Vara to be wowed.  Plus, this place is actually very vegetarian friendly!  You'll find plenty of veg dishes - perhaps even more than tapas.  Like the other places, La Vara is small  (decor is very lively and bright though) so be sure to make a rez.  I made a 2 person rez to celebrate bf's birthday for 9:15pm on a Sat.. but we arrived an hour early as we were in the area and they kindly seated us. Service was great all night- informative, helpful and prompt.  We had: - the fried chickpeas, fun as a fiery fried snack.. but not too much heat or greasiness (this was a theme across the board- even though things were fried, I never felt sick) - the crispy eggplant with cheese and honey and some kind of special black sesame seed- surprisingly light, with a hit of sweetness, very yummy- the special salad of the night- very clean summery cucumber, tomato, watercress, a special Spanish ricotta like cheese... delicious with house made croutons but I will say, had a tad bit too much dressing -the migas- house made fried pieces of bread (yum!) soaked with grapes, capers, and super cured chorizo- not the plump kind, more like the thinly dried out kind -the fideua or traditional Catalan paella made with short noodles, creamy aioli, and seafood- perfectly cooked baby octo, shrimp and clams.  I love this type of authentic paella, which is not tomato based or rice based as others are.  The noodles had a strong seafood flavor and almost tasted a little Asian-the vegetable terrine, a special. Light tomato sauce with fried cauliflower on a bed of potato and zucchini... really hearty but light at the same time -for dessert, we were debating between the sea salt and olive oil and date cake. Our server highly recommended the date cake, and it was definitely really nice.  It was like a softer biscotti on the outside- hard, but chewy and gooey on the inside with a dark molasses type of feel.  Atop was cream and a really yummy lemon curd- I love tart desserts!-of course, we had a pitcher of Sangria, which gives you about 5 glasses. It's not overtly sweet and disgusting like many other places; very fresh and tart with fresh fruit. Highly recommend. $150 after tip.",4.0

"My roommate and I suffered constant grief from a friend because we live so close to La Vara and never went before. He, on the other hand, has gone at least 4 times and lives in comparatively ""far away"" dumbo-ish. Granted, when we had tried to go in the past, we always were told there was some obscene wait of 3 hrs+. So after getting denied at Lucali for a 4 hr wait, we thought maybe we should at least try get have a look see at La Vara and...lo and behold, A TABLE!!!*WE DID IT WE DID IT! It was meant to be, obviously :)Standouts for me were the cumin lamb, stuffed rabbit, and the suckling pig (maybe not original per se...but very very tasty). The fried eggplant was also good, though I could maybe do with more honey and less cheese. Sangria could have been better if I were to nitpick, but hey, booze! *there was a real reservation due in about an hour's time so as long as we nommed fast and skiddaddled before then, the table was OURS. of course that wasn't a problem!",4.0
"My hubby & I were lucky enough to get a table at 8:30pm on a Friday night without having to wait. On the recommendation of our waitress, we started with a bottle of the Vina Sastre which was as amazing as she described-full-bodied with a hint of sweetness. We shared 7 different plates- each was unique and bursting with flavor. We started with the croqueta because really, who could resist? Sticking with the fried theme, next we had the berenjena con miel--  mm that eggplant paired with sweet honey and salty cheese, so good! We also had the mallorcan flatbread which was good, but nothing out of this world and another chorizo dish which had the perfect amount of kick. We had the suckling pig which was a special of the night- honestly, it wasn't as great as I'd hoped and didn't have quite as much flavor as the other dishes. The chicken asado was moist and bursting with flavor. The standout dish, was the Remojon which we ordered on recommendation from our waitress(the wine was delicious, so we knew she wouldn't steer us wrong). The ingredients in the Remojon were unique and at first, sound kind of odd together- but were so insanely delicious, I could eat this every day-- the citrusy salt cod paired so well with the pistachios/pistachio oil, egg and pomegranate. Mmm it was so delicious!!I can't wait to come back & try the rest of the menu!",4.0
"Struggle of the evening: Suckling pig or Fideua? Torn, I ultimately chose the suckling pig, which was one of the specials. And lesson learned: specials don't typically wind up being as special as advertised. Also, I'm unfortunately a sucker for specials (One more time: specials!).While the pig was good, it was a tad dry and it wasn't an outstanding, knock-your-socks-off dish. It was OK enough to make me deeply regret not ordering the fideua so I may have to come back for it. I was thiiiiis close to throwing my hands in the air and just ordering it after I finished my pig, but we had already ordered 3 apps prior to our main courses, and I didn't feel like pigging out any more (pun always intended).Of the appetizers offered, we went with the Croqueta del Dia, which was smoked ham and cheese for that day, Sardina a la Antigua, and Migas. They were all good, although we could've done without the croquetas. They were disappointingly tiny, only came with 2, and were more cheesy than anything else. To be honest, none of the appetizers really jumped out at me so we kind of rolled the dice and went with it. The Migas was probably the best of the 3 and apparently it's not always on the menu (?) so go for it if you see it.I left feeling as though I was supposed to love the place much more than I did.

"I came here with co-workers last night for a staff dinner. Our table of six was seated relatively comfortably in a round table by the window. We ordered around ten dishes to share, and the restaurant gave us two small plates on the house while we were waiting. I won't even pretend to remember exactly what every dish was. However, I can say that they all tasted amazing. A special shout-out to the tomato in sizzling cheese, served with charred bread. The best thing I had, though, was definitely the chicken - what WAS that sauce? It was subtle but added so perfectly to the meat, which was slow roasted and tender.I don't really drink, but my coworkers had two gin and tonics, a vodka martini, and some wine. They all said the alcohol was wonderful.Desserts were varied and interesting: the tart with rich hints of sweetness, the almond cake almost overpowering with its tart, sugary, chewy consistency, and the custard - such a light but interesting flavor.

"La Vara is a small Spanish restaurant in Cobble Hill and it's a great discovery! When you pass by the windows it looks so warm and inviting you just want to try it. We went in a small group for dinner and were able to share more tapas, salads and entrees. La Vara has a pretty eclectic menu with something for all tastes. It also has a slew of specials of the day, so many that our heads spun as the waitress rattled them off. Every item we ordered was delicious, but here are the ones I am coming back for:*Anchoas an Aceite - These are not anchovies you get on your Domino's Pizza slice. They're imported and flavored with sesame and hazelnuts. *Alcachofa - Fried artichokes like I've never tasted before. How can I go back to plain old steamed ones at home?*Cordero al ajo Cabanil - Cumin roasted lamb breast. Hearty and flavorful.*Lechon - Not on their regular menu, but the absolute best suckling pig I've had in Brooklyn or Manhattan! We should've ordered more of this and were politely fighting over the pieces. Tasty, tender pork with absolutely fantastic crispy skin.The bartender mixes good specialty cocktails and the wine list is almost exclusively Spanish. Service is pleasant and accommodating.

"I stopped in last night to celebrate my belated birthday dinner with my date.  I was torn between a 4-5 stars but the overall experience and service was great! Decor: very clean and elegant, hardwood floors and white walls, ample bar space to sit down and several tables outside. We sat outside on the back patio there were only 3-4 tables. Granted it was 86 degrees the whole day the back was shaded by a huge tree and the temperature by 6pm dropped. Beverages: SANGRIA, mind blown I had one glass and was wobbling out of there. Date had two glasses and had to drive to Beantown. I couldn't imagine how I felt so loopy.. They put gin in their sangria along with sugar and apples and lemon. Well I knew from that point on I was going to like this place. Food: We had one Fritos and two calientes. Mind you I'm not a big fish eater and majority of this menu was fish or had some in it. We started with the alachofa ($9) fried artichoke with anchovy alioli. So fingerlicking good. Perfectly crispy, not oily. The alioli was smooth, not fishy, didn't have an after taste and a little zesty. So last time my date and I got together he had goat tacos so we were still on the kick and went with the Gurullos. Loved the handmade murcian pasta. Yes the texture might be acquired for some because it's slimey. But there was a lot of flavor in the ground goat. I wouldn't call this a summer dish because of the smokey flavor of the meat. Would love to make this on a nice fall night, with a glass of red wine by a fire. ($15)The last dish of this epic meal was the suckling pig ($30), slow roasted pig with crispy skin. Pretty sure my eyes and I perked up when I heard pig on the menu. They meat didn't dry it was still juicy. Anthony Bourdain would've loved to be part of this meal. Clearly I'm not Kosher.Service: Nick was awesome and personable, he shared his own experiences growing up also not liking fish, spicy food and only shellfish. Service was attentive and our water cup was constantly filled. He knew the menu and he told me what was in the sangria.

"As to be expected, the results of searching for Sephardic cuisine on Yelp are far from appetizing. Along with dozens of synagogues and nursing homes, a gastroenterologist pops up, as does as a religious bathhouse. Among the handful of restaurants listed, most are Israeli and/or Mizrahi, and one is La Vara.Departing from the average tapas offerings of most NYC establishments, La Vara attempts to capture the cultural melding, and often clashing, at the heart of Spanish culinary history...and it does a damn good job of it.With my host of food allergies, I expect to eat a done-up salad and simple piece of meat when stepping into foodie heaven. Our waitress welcomed me to a noisy, yet half-empty La Vara with a detailed menu, conveniently coded for those with restrictions. So instead of eating like a rabbit, I ate one. The Conejo en Escabeche reminded me of an elegantly plated Moorish tagine, yet the bitterness of cooked olives perfectly balanced the sweetness of this dish. My dining companion initially dismissed rabbit as 'flavorless' and olives as 'briny'. He devoured most of it, leaving me to the Cordero Al Ajo Cabañil which was almost as perfect. Overwhelmingly doused with cumin, the lamb paired brilliantly with the tart lemon-date preserves and acidic barbecue-style hot sauce dabbed across the plate. The condiments really hit home on the Sephardic front, the sweetness of dates and zest of lemon masked the lamb's gaminess similar to the lard/garlic treatment used by non-Muslim/Jewish Spanish chefs. The portion was generous and a tad bit overcooked, but I didn't let a bit of char get in the way of cleaning the plate. They'll offer you pieces of hard-crusted bread to sop up the sauces. Take them up on it, if you're able.I was thrilled to see traditional Migas on the menu, and forced my partner to indulge on an order... which he gobbled up in a fit of bliss.  Our waitress recommended the an egg-covered stew of fava beans and artichokes, which was more like a hot salad and lacked any distinctive flavor. As per usual, I appetizered for dessert and went with the Escalivada, also a server recommendation. By far the richest dish of the evening. If I could take a bath in a vat of that romesco sauce, I would. A bold, spicy, and nutty base for the leeks atop it. Gold. My partner went for the Churros and licked away the bowl of dulce de leche that came with them. The pitcher of sangria we ordered lasted 'til the very end, and so did our waitress, who stuck around after her shift was through to make sure we were satisfied.

"My roommate and I suffered constant grief from a friend because we live so close to La Vara and never went before. He, on the other hand, has gone at least 4 times and lives in comparatively ""far away"" dumbo-ish. Granted, when we had tried to go in the past, we always were told there was some obscene wait of 3 hrs+. So after getting denied at Lucali for a 4 hr wait, we thought maybe we should at least try get have a look see at La Vara and...lo and behold, A TABLE!!!*WE DID IT WE DID IT! It was meant to be, obviously :)Standouts for me were the cumin lamb, stuffed rabbit, and the suckling pig (maybe not original per se...but very very tasty). The fried eggplant was also good, though I could maybe do with more honey and less cheese. Sangria could have been better if I were to nitpick, but hey, booze! *there was a real reservation due in about an hour's time so as long as we nommed fast and skiddaddled before then, the table was OURS. of course that wasn't a problem!",4.0
"My hubby & I were lucky enough to get a table at 8:30pm on a Friday night without having to wait. On the recommendation of our waitress, we started with a bottle of the Vina Sastre which was as amazing as she described-full-bodied with a hint of sweetness. We shared 7 different plates- each was unique and bursting with flavor. We started with the croqueta because really, who could resist? Sticking with the fried theme, next we had the berenjena con miel--  mm that eggplant paired with sweet honey and salty cheese, so good! We also had the mallorcan flatbread which was good, but nothing out of this world and another chorizo dish which had the perfect amount of kick. We had the suckling pig which was a special of the night- honestly, it wasn't as great as I'd hoped and didn't have quite as much flavor as the other dishes. The chicken asado was moist and bursting with flavor. The standout dish, was the Remojon which we ordered on recommendation from our waitress(the wine was delicious, so we knew she wouldn't steer us wrong). The ingredients in the Remojon were unique and at first, sound kind of odd together- but were so insanely delicious, I could eat this every day-- the citrusy salt cod paired so well with the pistachios/pistachio oil, egg and pomegranate. Mmm it was so delicious!!I can't wait to come back & try the rest of the menu!",4.0
"Struggle of the evening: Suckling pig or Fideua? Torn, I ultimately chose the suckling pig, which was one of the specials. And lesson learned: specials don't typically wind up being as special as advertised. Also, I'm unfortunately a sucker for specials (One more time: specials!).While the pig was good, it was a tad dry and it wasn't an outstanding, knock-your-socks-off dish. It was OK enough to make me deeply regret not ordering the fideua so I may have to come back for it. I was thiiiiis close to throwing my hands in the air and just ordering it after I finished my pig, but we had already ordered 3 apps prior to our main courses, and I didn't feel like pigging out any more (pun always intended).Of the appetizers offered, we went with the Croqueta del Dia, which was smoked ham and cheese for that day, Sardina a la Antigua, and Migas. They were all good, although we could've done without the croquetas. They were disappointingly tiny, only came with 2, and were more cheesy than anything else. To be honest, none of the appetizers really jumped out at me so we kind of rolled the dice and went with it. The Migas was probably the best of the 3 and apparently it's not always on the menu (?) so go for it if you see it.I left feeling as though I was supposed to love the place much more than I did. Maybe I just ordered all the wrong things but dinner was good. Not great. Would like to come back for that fideua though.",3.0

"Enjoyable dining experience at La Vara. The place is pretty tiny and very loud. We sat at a table that they did not call communal but it was. OK with me but don't try to have a private conversation there! The hostess was very nice and accommodating even with the throng of people in the tiny waiting area.The food was interesting and tasty. They served a large variety of Spanish tapas with a mediterranean flair. The food comes out incredibly fast. Limited cocktails with a good mix of wines.Fried chickpeas- kinda like popcorn or bar nuts. Finger food to munch while your food is being prepared. They were pretty good.Suckling pig- I have had better suckling pig. Could use a bit more flavor or sauce. It was tender but nothing to write home about.Rabbit- I love rabbit.... however I wasn't impressed with this one. Just kinda blah.Tuna empanadita special-  Very plain to me, but the other diner with me enjoyed them. Could use a dipping sauce.Favorite items-Chicken hearts- Skewered yakitori style with a scrumptious salad. I think that salad was the highlight of the meal. It consisted of mint, arugula and a delicious lime-date dressing. The meat was succulent and perfect.Green pepper and baby shrimp salad- delightful small pieces with an avocado sauce. Very refreshing.Overall- I would go back and try more items on the menu. There is a such a variety that I feel I would find more favorite items. I leaned towards liking the smaller plates and the salad based items better than the meat and fried items on the menu.",4.0

Décor is a bit generic/nondescript and things -- as in many Brooklyn restaurants -- can feel a bit tight when the place gets crowded.",4.0
"Cozy place! Great, unusual, tasty food..  You won't get an over sized meal here so don't plan on coming hungry.  This is a tapas place, a chance to share some food with your friends and have a drink while you're at it.  They take pride in what they do here and I am a big fan.  We came Wednesday evening and the place was full.  Make a reservation as this place is quite small and fills up quick.",5.0
"Rather uneventful yet expensive meal. We tried 6 things:1) The foie gras came with a brioche that remarkably resembled a stale airplane roll and was also accompanied by some cheap green olives. 2) The market vegetables baked in a paper bag were $16, and the bag barely had anything in it. 3) The suckling pig was fine4) The bread with chorizo & quail egg was nice5) The special seafood stew was swimming in the pool of cream with very little flavor.6) The desert ""Egipcio"" that was named an almond tart was in reality a really dry and boring cookie with a tiny bit of date filling.All in all - very boring and overpriced.There are better options in the neighborhood.",2.0
"Food is great, I've enjoyed pretty much every dish I've had.  Only things that keep me from giving it 5 stars is staff and cost.",4.0
"Enjoyable dining experience at La Vara. The place is pretty tiny and very loud. We sat at a table that they did not call communal but it was. OK with me but don't try to have a private conversation there! The hostess was very nice and accommodating even with the throng of people in the tiny waiting area.The food was interesting and tasty. They served a large variety of Spanish tapas with a mediterranean flair. The food comes out incredibly fast. Limited cocktails with a good mix of wines.Fried chickpeas- kinda like popcorn or bar nuts. Finger food to munch while your food is being prepared. They were pretty good.Suckling pig- I have had better suckling pig. Could use a bit more flavor or sauce. It was tender but nothing to write home about.Rabbit- I love rabbit.... however I wasn't impressed with this one. Just kinda blah.Tuna empanadita special-  Very plain to me, but the other diner with me enjoyed them. Could use a dipping sauce.Favorite items-Chicken hearts- Skewered yakitori style with a scrumptious salad. I think that salad was the highlight of the meal. It consisted of mint, arugula and a delicious lime-date dressing. The meat was succulent and perfect.Green pepper and baby shrimp salad- delightful small pieces with an avocado sauce. Very refreshing.Overall- I would go back and try more items on the menu. There is a such a variety that I feel I would find more favorite items. I leaned towards liking the smaller plates and the salad based items better than the meat and fried items on the menu.",4.0
"Excellent spanish tapas place. Went there for brunch and eager to go back for dinner.Recommended: patatas bravas, churros, la vara burger, el quim (squid with eggs), tortillas gambas (shrimp)Friendly staff. Small spaces so perhaps not great for large groups. Supposedly has garden seating but not sure.",5.0
"One of my local favorites -- very friendly staff and excellent food overall.  Beer selection could improve (especially if you are celiac or gluten free), the same dish can sometimes be uneven, and it is very loud - hence 4 stars rather than 5.  But on the whole it is an excellent place.",4.0
"It was my birthday and E asked where we'd like to go. My response, same as years before, was tapas with byob. Although he didn't deliver on the byob at La Vara, the tasty tapas made up for that minor hiccup. Wine bottle are a little on the high side so we started out with Sangria which is sweet and boozely. I would just suggest to ask the to add less ice. Definitely order the hot tapas plates and the specials. What was memorable were the fried artichokes, suckling pig, and the cumin roasted lamb.",4.0

"I came here last night after seeing all the good reviews, craving tapas, and wanting to find a place nearby in Brooklyn. Well, it must have been a bad night because I was sadly disappointed. We had a table by the kitchen opening and could see the food being spooned out of plastic takeout containers by less than enthusiastic kitchen staff. Maybe because it was a monday night and was slow? But thats not much of an excuse... No complaints on the service which was fast and attentive. The food however: - We started with the sardines, deviled eggs, olives, and sausage spread. Sardines were way too salty but not bad. Deviled eggs (or rather 1 egg) were nothing special. Olives are olives and hard to screw up. The spread was kinda gross with an overly gooey texture. - We thought to try to special of suckling pig. We heard good things about crispy skins etc. At $30 for 1 plate, we were expecting something great but eeekk! The skin was rubbery and overly salty is some places, the meat was overcooked and hard in others, and there was a fowl aftertaste that lingered for a long time after I finished. For $30 a plate (and a portion enough for 1 person)? Really?- Ended the night with olive oil ice cream (which I was very much looking forward too because I've had it elsewhere and loved it).  But even that was obviously kept in the freezer for too long and a little too liberally doused in sea salt. The taste was more vanilla than olive oil. Well that was our night. Had the prices been a bit lower, I might have gone a bit easier on it. But the prices they charge command better quality. Again, maybe it was a bad night but I think I'd rather just venture out into the city for a better tapas place next time.",2.0

"That suckling pig will have you sucking your fingers! The ""paella"" was delicious, but had fideos (tiny, thin spaghetti) instead of rice, none the less it was still damn delicious.

It's really just meh-to-ok. I came on a Saturday night and was really happy/lucky to get a table. Our waitperson was friendly friendly and  food came out quick. The problem was the portions were psychotically small (even for tapas) and mostly not very good. We had the famous artichokes that tasted like street fair food - greasy and not much flavor. And a chick pea spinach ""stew"" that really truly tasted like hospital food - limp and swampy and generally very unappealing.  The eggplant was very good, however, as was the flat bread. I just think given the hype and prices, I was expecting a lot better and that chickpea stew isn't up to par for most home chefs, let alone such an acclaimed restaurant. I was really surprised.",2.0

"La Vara is truly destination dining and perhaps an ideal first date restaurant. It features an exotic menu, is located on one of the prettiest streets in the city (a quiet, residential block no less), and generally hits both dimensions of food quality and (relative) value. Actually, let me walk away from that last assertion to simply state that menu prices appear low, but the sum total at the end might end up being greater than what you had expected... still, isn't that true for all meals featuring Tapas / Small Plates?Lately, there appears to be a Spanish restaurant revival in the city. What's intrigued me about La Vara are the Sephardic and Moorish influences in the cuisine - appealing to the romantic in me who likes to embellish the imagination of what life in Andalusia must have been like prior to 1492 with followers of three great religions co-existing harmoniously. So, it's somewhat annoying when servers completely ignore the cumin, saffron, and eggplant influences in the cuisine (introduced by Muslims) while crediting the entire differentiation from the norm as Sephardic.I don't believe that I've appreciated a similar sensory onslaught in a meal lately. The ubiquitous meatballs (lamb) are incredibly juicy and go well with the mint yogurt, while the crispy eggplant (Berenjina) with honey, nigella seeds and melted cheese is superlative and absolutely best-in-class. I've enjoyed the Gurullos for the fluffiness of the pasta (thought that the spiciness of the Sumac was overpowered by the butter), the Fideua for the casual introduction to noodle based paella, the Cordero (cumin roasted lamb breast with lemon-date condiment) for the interior/exterior meat texture contrast, and the Pollo Asado (half chicken roasted over spiced onions, cumin, coriander) for spices and gravy - though it would probably wow others not intimately familiar with Indian cuisine. There have been a few misses as well. Among them Ortiguillas Po'Boy (special) as one of the many fried dishes on the menu, but one where the oil dominates the flavor, the Garbanzos (spiced chick peas - one of the laggards amongst more popular recent versions such as at Pig and Khao), and Remojon (citrus and salt cod salad with pistachios) which had a mélange of flavors and textures - perhaps too many for any to stand out or for salad to serve the function of an appetizer.My favorite desserts have been the Torta Santiago (flourless almond cake) with its effortless charm and the Egipcio which is much like a Pop-Tart filled with date and walnut paste brought to magical heights courtesy the lemon curd and the tender shortbread. Top notch! But, not what it would appear on first glance - much like most of the meal. Tapas have truly grown up beyond the typical Patatas Brava.

"What a delicious brunch.  Everything we ate was well prepared, and I very much enjoyed the atmosphere of this casual spot.  Four of us ate together--we had (cut and pasted from the menu): GARBANZOS FRITOS: La Vara spiced fried chickpeas * 3 PATATAS BRAVAS: EQP's rough cut crispy potatoes with spicy alioli * 6MOJE: layered salad of imported tuna, olives, endive, Marcona almonds * 14 CUCHIFRITO: crispy lamb hash with poached eggs, ajo cabiñil sauce * 11EL QUIM: local squid and crispy morcilla with broken eggs, Boqueria style * 11ALCACHOFAS Y FAVAS: olive oil braised artichoke and fava bean stew, poached eggs * 12 All of these dishes were great.  I especially like the cuchifrto and the el quim--both were stand outs. I am generally not impressed by brunch.  I love brunch, don't get me wrong, but the food doesn't often outshine the much desired Bloody Mary.  I think La Vara though offers really great food at reasonable prices.  I will definitely be back.",5.0

"If a review was based on just ""how good is the food"", it would get 5 stars. But, since I also consider ""how good was the dining experience"" to be just as important, it only gets 3 stars. Below are some highlights based on my three visits (feel free to skip to ""Summary"" for an expedited read:Food: First of all, yes, the food is awesome, a bit rich, but awesome. Recommendations include: garbanzos fritos (fried chickpeas),fideua (seafood paella), albondigas (lamb meatballs, and pollo asado (half a chicken). Value: I am not 100% sure, but I think the prices listed on their website are not up to date, and reflect a less expensive dining experience. I also would love to recommend the crispy eggplant, and deviled eggs but I just think they are too expensive (I feel like I am eating $5 every time I take a small bite). Restaurant environment: The restaurant is small but surprisingly comfortable. There is a large booth that can accommodate a 6-7 size party. One gripe was how LOUD it was. With less than half the restaurant full on a Tuesday evening, we had to shout to hear each other over the other parties' chatter. Service: They always ask you if you have been there so they can recommend you get the right amount of dishes to share per group which is nice. They also are quite helpful at suggesting menu items. But when they tell you of the specials..get ready for some serious speed talking and in my case, complete zoning out after the 100th special is read. This most recent visit, I asked for a written list of the specials, which they had, but seemed hesitant to fork over (pun intended). Lastly, there is always a frustrating amount of time that passes when you are done eating, and when you can actually leave the restaurant (a common theme with NYC dining that annoys me). Summary: Amazing food, pretty good service, small portion sizes/too expensive for what it is.Final thoughts: Either the portion sizes should be bigger OR the prices should be cheaper. I don't need or want some endless pasta and breadsticks deal, but since this place doesn't strike me as ""fine dining"", it is simply not acceptable to charge $8 for four little pieces of crispy eggplant (which to their credit, does taste amazing).",3.0

"What a delicious brunch.  Everything we ate was well prepared, and I very much enjoyed the atmosphere of this casual spot.  Four of us ate together--we had (cut and pasted from the menu): GARBANZOS FRITOS: La Vara spiced fried chickpeas * 3 PATATAS BRAVAS: EQP's rough cut crispy potatoes with spicy alioli * 6MOJE: layered salad of imported tuna, olives, endive, Marcona almonds * 14 CUCHIFRITO: crispy lamb hash with poached eggs, ajo cabiñil sauce * 11EL QUIM: local squid and crispy morcilla with broken eggs, Boqueria style * 11ALCACHOFAS Y FAVAS: olive oil braised artichoke and fava bean stew, poached eggs * 12 All of these dishes were great.  I especially like the cuchifrto and the el quim--both were stand outs. I am generally not impressed by brunch.  I love brunch, don't get me wrong, but the food doesn't often outshine the much desired Bloody Mary.  I think La Vara though offers really great food at reasonable prices.  I will definitely be back.",5.0

"Oh La Vara, how I wish you were just a smidge better because you are two blocks away from home and the would-be perfect place to lure unsuspecting Manhattan stalwarts into the BK! As it stands, this is a solid four-star spot with definite five-star potential and I've been a couple of times in the past few months (including a last minute Monday-night visit where the place was near-empty). Negative points for having so many unwritten ""specials"" (quotes because some of the specials seem to just be regular dishes that for some reason haven't been printed on the menu--i.e., the suckling pig) that your waitress' recall ability becomes an inside joke with the table. Just WRITE THEM DOWN. You have those cute little cocktail menus that are the PERFECT size for a nightly specials menu! Not all of us can remember eight to ten additional dishes after downing that delicious/dangerous tequila-based cocktail during the initial menu perusal... just sayin'. Get: suckling pig, goat pasta, fried artichokes, eggplant, rabbit, white gazpacho soup special (if available--and be sure to eat the shrimp in your soup bites as the broth alone tastes a bit like tahini sauce). Skip: Sardines (literally just canned sardines on a plate), bread/chorizo special salad (unless you like your charred bread to be black and inedible), stuffed pepper special, paella. Overall, there is room for improvement, but the restaurant provides an enjoyable experience and a variety of yummy tapas to please all palates.",4.0
"ALMOST gave this a 5, but i'm not entirely sure if my happy feelings are a result of the company I was with or of the restaurant. I'll re-review again.Came for dinner on a Wed night around 8:30. Zero wait, score! Sidenote, I wish life was a series of small plates. For instance, you could be a zookeeper for two mos and bounce off to being a pro wrestler another month. Just, small plates. Lots of them. Anyway, WE ordered a series of small plates: Alcachofa fried artichokes, anchovy alioli: The alioli made this dish, which is saying a lot for me bc i dislike white creamy sauces. Fried artichokes were exceptionally tasty,Cordero Al Ajo Cabañil: my favorite dish of the entire menu. lamb was incredibly tender and flavorful. Brick De Acelgas: Interesting take on a veggie spring roll. Prob healthier. Would've preferred it to be not fried. And, two specials - raw scallop dish in a sauce and a pane with chorizo. The raw scallop was really interesting. It was tartare-esque with bursts of citrus. The pane w chorizo was good in concept, but we had to request a 3 min egg on top and some fresh ground pepper. The staff was great in accommodating this and all of our requests, which makes this place a winner in my eyes.",4.0
"This was the best meal I had during a week in New York, and probably the best so far this year.A group of four, we arrived after a gruelling hour wait drinking possibly the best cocktails I've ever had at Red Gravy nearby and crumpled into our table at half nine on a Wednesday. The size of the portions and the size of the group meant we could sample a fairly good selection of the menu. We had about 2-3 tapas each, all shared, which was absolutely more than enough (I've seen other Yelpers complaining that the portions meant you needed to order about 8 each, I find this slightly terrifying). Some portions were larger than others, but most were of the traditional saucer sized variety.There were a healthy amount of specials available, all explained and recommended by our friendly Spanish waitress and we tried a few of these. Steamed ramps appeared in a brown paper bag we had to cut open, accompanied by a rich romesco sauce, the American take on the traditional Catalan calçot dish. Migas (of the Spanish, not tex mex variety) were a deliciously moreish and large plate of crispy fried Chorizo, breadcrumbs and caramelized onions. I decided against ordering the berenjenas con miel, fried aubergines with cheese and honey, after an underwhelming experience with the same in other tapas places. When my Dad ordered them, I demolished them. The aubergine had been peeled and sliced into batons, the sauce, a mix of manchego and a creamy Mozzarella like cheese whose name escapes me, was the perfect blend of sweet, tangy and creamy.Each dish that came out seemed better than the last. Alcachofa, fried artichokes with anchovy aioli were just the right mix of crispy and melting, the aioli having enough anchovy to give it a bite without being so much as to put off someone like me who doesn't really like them. The cordero, cumin roasted lamb, tasted like a confit, with an addictive zingy preserved lemon and date condiment. Pan amb tomaca, the traditional tomato bread had a twist of mojama (air cured tuna) and nori. Escalavida, a traditional vegetable stew was paired with a light tahini sauce, an unusual take that combined richness with the fresh, lush taste of the vegetables. The croquettas were the only unremarkable dish of the night, being absolutely fine, but not the best I've ever hadWe finished off, although by now thoroughly full, with two desserts. Olive oil ice-cream with sea salt tasted exactly like its ingredients, in the best possible way, though was not to my taste to be honest. The other dessert, a special, involved an elegant and light black sesame macaron and many other things I can't remember.While the prices range from low to high, the bill for all the food with wine and sherry for four people came to a pretty reasonable (by New York standards) $230 which is worth noting as many reviews said you'd need to spend at least 100 a head to manage here. We spent the rest of our time in New York deliberating whether to return but never did. There is a danger of attempting to recreate the amazing experience of the first time trying something wonderful on holiday which can never really be repeated. But if I lived in Brooklyn, I would come here as often as my paycheck allowed.",5.0

"(4.5 Stars)We walked out of La Vara thinking, ""That was one of the best meals we have had in recent memory."" Surprisingly, La Vara did not arrive on our radars from one of our usual sources - the countless food blogs we frequent - but simply from strolling through the delightful Cobble Hill neighborhood, dreaming about being able to afford one of the gorgeous brownstones, and then - oh so fortuitously - stumbling upon this gem one summer's eve. We took one look at the menu and booked for the following weekend.Seated on the small patio outside, we were transported to an idyllic, quiet oasis on a tiny deck in Brooklyn. (Note: It can get rather loud inside, though, once the masses arrive.) We took to the extensive menu and began deliberating. Of course, the staff were an absolute delight and - not only guided us through the treats on offer - but also suggested that we order a few plates, get through those and then reevaluate our hunger/desires from there. Unlike former greats (read: Traif, which has now become rather disappointing), we were given the freedom to make ad hoc decisions as to where we saw our palates moving through the course of the meal. And they moved, baby! As George Constanza would say. But this is not Seinfeld.Food (First Round): We started with the Alcachofa (fried artichokes, anchovy aioli) which were sublime. I would have been completely content with seven plates of this constituting our meal. You must order these.The garbanzos fritos (La Vara spiced chickpeas) were very tasty, though - considering how spectacular everything else is on the menu - this is one of those cheap thrills on which I wouldn't necessarily waste my appetite. If you need something to nibble on during your leisurely meal, grab some for the table, but this would not be on my ""Best of La Vara List"".The Berenjena con Miel (crispy eggplant with honey, melted cheese, nigella seed) was great. While it did not represent eggplant in its typical form, it was a combination of crispy-on-the-exterior-­silky-on-the-interior and bathed in a tub of honey-cheesy heavenly curds. Praise the lord!(Second Round):The salt-baked fish of the day with harrisa ajada was delicious. We ordered a single piece of the white fish and the delicateness of the fish, paired with the fragrant bite of the harrisa proved to be the perfect balance to the other rich items on our table.The Cordero Al Ajo Cabanil (cumin roasted lamb breast, scallion, preserved lemon-date condiment) was as exquisite as it sounds. Like all the dishes at La Vara, the flavor combinations are flawlessly executed, with the sweetness of the preserve cutting the richness of the perfectly prepared lamb. ""Oh my!"" as George Takei would say. This should certainly be on your eating itinerary.(Dessert):The Egipcio (orange blossom scented date walnut tart, lemon curd, sweet cream) was delicious -- it is everything you wish a fig newton could be... but thicker and richer. When balanced with the tart richness of the lemon curd and the fluffiness of the cream, there was much in the way of moaning with pleasure.Natillas de Arroz con Leche (cinnamon-rose and rich scented custard with grapefruit and rosemary) was also a delight - delicate and floral, it was a perfectly refreshing way to end an incredible meal.Conclusion:As with all tapas places, you run into the problem of finding a delicious dish and wanting to eat all of it, lamenting the fact that you ever agreed to share these delectable items. For two, the portions were perfect, providing us with a chance to slowly make our way through the lovely menu. Of course, we are already strategizing our next meal. At around $120 for two people (including a glass of wine), it is well within the realm of reason when compared to the likes of The Grocery, which is a little more dear. With flavors that are perfectly balanced and wonderfully executed, this is the type of neighborhood establishment one comes to treasure. We will certainly be back to dabble in more of their creative and delicious fare on offer.",5.0
"Went here last night, had a wonderful experience. A small space on Clinton, but tastefully done. Atmosphere is airy and playful, with decor that doesn't try too hard to be cool. Tight, and hard to walk around really, but overall bearable (although this was a Thursday, not sure how cramped it gets on weekends).Despite a few slip ups (hostess not paying attention, bartender forgot our glasses of wine while we waited for a table, but apologized and was pleasant), my initial impression was overall good. You could bring your wine glasses outside and enjoy the weather while you wait, and the wait was not long (for 2).The service at the table was impeccable. Small plates were brought, as usual, when they are ready. Dirty/empty plates were taken away as needed, water refilled, etc. The server was fantastic. Accommodating, understood the intricacies of the menu and the food, and was a delight to interact with. Very profession, and she knew her shit.Now, the food: We had the lamb meatballs with mint yogurt, which were very good but not great, the meat quality didn't astound me. The roasted beet salad with sunflower seeds and oil was fantastic, the beets were perfectly done. Tomato rubbed bread with cured meats was amazing, I haven't tasted something that good in a while. Eggplant with honey and cheese was the best part. It tasted like ""french toast sticks with eggplant"" as my friend described. We also had a zucchini special appetizer stuffed with cheese in a tomato sauce. Really good. For dessert we had the olive oil ice cream (better than I expected), and the date walnut tart with sweet cream and lemon preserves. That was my favorite part of the meal. To die for.So, for a bunch of small plates (not that small) and a bottle of wine and another glass later, the pricetag wasn't too bad either (about 80 a person). I'll be back!",4.0
"This place was awesome.  The wait for a table for three on a Saturday night at 10 pm was an hour, but we killed the time with awesome cocktails at the Henry Public and were definitely ready for dinner by the time our table was ready.We had:* Pitcher of sangria* Special of zucchini cakes* Special dish of squid, pork, and shrimp in white bean gazpacho* Eggplant with melted cheese and honey* Flatbread with onions and blue cheese* Layered salad of tuna, olives, endive, and marcona almonds* Braised tongue with peas and carrots * Almond cake* Walnut tart with lemon curdI wasn't enamored of the special in the gazpacho, but it was still really good.  Everything was pretty much awesome, but, if I had to play favorites (and I think I do, as this is Yelp), my favorites were the eggplant, the tuna salad (the mixture of tuna, olives, and marcona almonds was unexpected and amazing), and the walnut tart.  I really liked the flatbread also, but it's less inventive than some of the other things we had.All in all, I would wait for this place again - but, as it takes reservations on OpenTable, you shouldn't have to!",4.0
"Two weeks ago I left this restaurant extremely disappointed and I'm still thinking about how my experience here was a complete and utter let down. So the night started with my boyfriend, my parents, and I arriving for our 9:30 reservation 10 minutes early to be told that the party before us had just ordered another entree so it'd be a bit of a wait. That's fine, we understood that those sort of things happen and the staff has no control over it. To bide our time, we decided to have a couple drinks at the bar. Here it was that the service started plummeting downhill. First of all, it took the bartender about 15 minutes to acknowledge us. When we were able to order, my mother and I got a bottle of sparkling rose, from which the bartender poured over half a glass, noticed the glass was dirty, dumped out what she poured, and didn't even do anything to make up for what she wasted of our bottle. So basically, we lost half a glass that could have easily been made up for with the open bottle I noticed behind the bar. We both kept waiting for her to correct her mistake but nothing happened. Then 10:15 rolls around and we're still waiting for our table. We are asked again what time we made our reservation for because apparently the staff couldn't be bothered to keep tabs on the people they've left hanging. After realizing we'd been there for close to an hour, they sent us out some tiny snacks. It was a nice gesture and all but a little disappointing, after all we were famished at this point and a bowl of fried chickpeas between 4 people was not doing the trick. Finally, we were seated at a little past 10:45. The rest of the meal was okay but had been thoroughly tainted by the 1.5 hour wait. Food was decent but the plates were so tiny. Even smaller than tapas. Plus it seemed like we were being rushed. We left at around midnight, our wallets $400 lighter and feeling like we got gypped.",1.0
"The food here is better than it was at almost every restaurant we visited in Spain, and we went to some pretty fancy restaurants. Don't expect to find another paella bar: the cuisine is more Moorish than Valencian, and it is outstanding. Here's what to get:Croquettas: perhaps the best we've ever, ever had. A must.Suckling Pig: if they have it, it would be criminal NOT to order it. Don't even think about ordering anything else unless you get the pig.Cordero Al Ajo Cabañil: imagine duck confit, but with lamb. This was the tastiest, most succulent lamb meat I've ever had. Crunchy on the outside, tender and moist on the inside.Anything with langostinos (as a side, they don't give you many).You can probably skip dessert - it was the only part of the meal we weren't thrilled about. The homemade ice-cream was lacking in flavor (and sugar); it was also icy rather than creamy, probably due to the low sugar and/or fat content.The best seats are at the bar, which is wide enough and comfortable that you don't need a table. You also get the added benefit of observing pure magic, courtesy of Pablo (your bartender/waiter).There is a significant obstacle you need to overcome before enjoying any of this deliciousness, and it is... well, you aren't the only one who is hoping to enjoy it. Their reservation policy is logical but annoying (only for parties of 4+, and if you're hoping to score one on Fri/Sat, book 2-3 weeks in advance). And really, if you decide to check this place out on a weekend, expect 45 min to 1:30 hr wait. Then, if/when you do end up at a table, ask for earplugs.

Sort of like having - Spanish sushi and or Chinese Dimsum. 2. If you happen to have a large appetite, prepare to spend or go else where. I was also wondering about the reviewers, I felt the honesty was a little canned. But to each his own. One reviewer, my comments:GARBANZOS FRITOS: La Vara spiced fried chickpeas * 3 - really small plate, I would order two, if your company is more than two.PATATAS BRAVAS: EQP's rough cut crispy potatoes with spicy alioli * 6 - again, food as a teaser, order two. MOJE: layered salad of imported tuna, olives, endive, Marcona almonds * 14 - and I can go on. CUCHIFRITO: crispy lamb hash with poached eggs, ajo cabiñil sauce * 11EL QUIM: local squid and crispy morcilla with broken eggs, Boqueria style * 11 -  and on. ALCACHOFAS Y FAVAS: olive oil braised artichoke and fava bean stew, poached eggs * 12 and on. I will admit very sexy drinks. Again, this is a $65 - $75 dollar per person night - if you have the dollars, prepare to spend. And, you may still be hungry at the end of the night!This comment gets to me: ""Take note, Buttermilk Channel, Frankie's, Talde, and the rest of you overhyped restaurants  - this place is the real deal, and you should all be taking notes. - Wow, this is rich!Another ebullent quote: ""I love small plates. With a few adventurous people, you can try such an array of flavors. La Vara is a very small restaurant. We got in just under the wire; we waited about 20-30 minutes, with later arrives quoted times of 1 hr or more."" - Again, does this person get out much, it should be small and pricey. Here's another gushing one:""If I lived in Brooklyn, I'd come here all the time. I'm from the New York area and this is one of the best restaurants I've ever been to.

"Great!  Loved the clean, white look of the place.  We had the best seat in the house, a nice booth right in the front window - ask for that if you are a group of 4.  We had the sardines, fried artichokes, the jamon croquetas, the rabbit, the lamb meatballs and a couple of specials - one was a fish filet in a harissa sauce and the other was a take on a deviled egg.  Delicious food, only wish we could come back and try everything else.  Perfect pacing.  Very nice, friendly service.",4.0
"This place is definitely expensive for the amount of food you get.  I a few small plates and 2 entrees, with 4-5 beers and it came out to $105 not including tip.  The atmosphere was a little weird at first, but this was my first time in this neighborhood.  When my date arrived, the lights dimmed, and the place got more crowded and loud, but not overwhelmingly so.  The wait staff was very nice and very knowledgeable... The bar tender and was also social, which was nice.  They all waved goodbye to me as i left. I love meatballs, and the lamb ones were awesome. I would recommend for a couple who wants to walk in a cute area of Brooklyn, and try a few snacks.",4.0

"La Vara is our go to 'nice' place.It's small, so go early or get an RVSP.Favorites: Migas, chick peas, crispy eggplant, sprouts. The little sandwiches were a bit underwhelming.And there is the rub...this place is expensive, and the plates for 'sharing' are really good for 2 people...and there's not a lot of food. And it adds up quick. Also...it's small...and on a busy night, people might be 2 deep at the bar, and you're trying to eat.But if you know what you're getting into...it great, and interesting.",4.0
"So I had a craving for paella and was on the search for an authentic quality meal in Brooklyn.  I found this restaurant. Based on the reviews I thought it would be a good choice. The menu looked eccentric. Saw pictures of the restaurant and thought what do we have to lose. Now I'm a quality over quantity girl any day of the week but the portions here with the exception of the pollo asado are really small. You've been warned.The food wasn't that great.My friend and I ordered the Alcachfa( artichokes with anchovy aiolli, Carabineros(red shrimp), pollo asado, and fideua(paella). The Alcachfa was interesting in a good way crispy and salty.The Carabineros were a joke. Two shrimp marinated in sauce for $20. After tearing off the head and breaking down the shell the shrimp were very small My friends piece was especially small. The pollo asado was tasty and juicy and the paella left more to be desired. The four shrimp in the paella looked dehydrated. The four small clams were good and the three pieces of squid were fresh and cooked well. Sigh! in retrospect I should have complained about the portions....but I felt like a fool for suggesting this place. The sangria tasted watered down and the fruits were not good. I had a slight buzz though. My friend and I ate in silence paid and left. I would not come back here. I can tell the food is cooked with quality ingredients but the portions and entrees are not equal to the prices. The only thing that helped the meal were the continuous portions of bread another waiter kept bringing us giving us a humble sympathetic smile each time as if he intuitively sensed our disappointment.",2.0
"Came here with a group of a Friday night and was especially excited about it after it showed up on Serious Eat's recent guide of vegetarian options in NYC. It was a nice selection for a group with its focus on small plates and encouragement to share. Many great dishes stood out although surprisingly the ones I was the most excited about (blue cheese flatbread, skate special) were somewhat disappointing and ones I ordered just to fill out a full meal (pasta with goat butter, swiss chard) turned out to be amazing. I was a little baffled by what they decided to fry (like the skate) and disappointed that I wasn't given more warning about when these preparations would come up. Why anyone would take a delicious, delicate fish like skate, deep fry it is beyond me. The space was really cute, but it got really loud in there which made it difficult to talk among out party of 6. I'd say I'd come back for a date, but when wouldn't be able to share as many options. All in all, I'm glad I tried La Vara but left a little let down. I really wouldn't say it lived up to the billing of being good for vegetarians that Serious Eats placed on it.",3.0
Food is good but the place is too loud. It's very hard to have a conversion or hear the many specials. There are too many waiters working but none around when your wine glass is empty,3.0
"Dinner at La Vara was a very rewarding experience - the food, the ambiance and the service were top notch. We ordered a few tapas that included vegetables, rabbit, and fish and all were delicious complemented by executive sauces. It was certainly a feast in the mouth.",5.0

Tapas place. They range from small to medium sized tapas and recommend 2-3 tapas per person for the table. The food was good but I wasn't so impressed that I'll need to go again any time soon. Had the lamb breast and the friend eggplant with honey and cheese( forget which kind ). Also tried the fried chickpeas and the fish of the day dish. Customer service was excellent.

"Went for dinner tonight in honor of the Jewish New Year. Have really been looking forward to visiting the restaurant as the menu sounded good and the chef has a good reputation.Shared the Sardina  a la antigua, crispy eggplant with honey and melted cheese, croquette of the day, the stuffed rabbit loin and the gurullos. All the food is tasty. The crispy eggplant is orgasmic, the rabbit loin tasty in its simplicity, the pasta comforting.The space is nicely designed. white tables and chairs, brick wall, vaguely spanish cut out sheet metal design on the wall. My critique: Service was too stiff. There wasn't a warm feeling and the waiter served all food too quickly. He also forgot that our pasta hadn't arrived and had already cleared away our utensils. It was not a welcoming atmosphere; as though the restaurant takes itself too seriously. The tab, including two glasses of wine was $100 before tip. The warm course, the rabbit and pasta dishes, are meant for sharing, and not entree size. So this is a lot of money for grazing food.

"More and more I'm becoming convinced that the small plates concept is just another phrase for throwing a bunch of bar food at the wall and seeing what sticks.  I'm not saying the food I had a La Vara was bad.  It's not.  Things like the olive oil flatbread topped with caramelized onions and blue cheese would be an amazing snack, teetering on top of a Madrid bar stool drinking Spanish beer.  But as part of a dinner that cost $100 in Brooklyn?  Nah.  So too the $14(!) salad of 5 overcooked shrimps, melon balls and avocado.  A fantastic, refreshing nibble if it costs 2 euros with drinks.  Not so attractive as an appetizer.  The ubiquitous beet and greens salad was too restrained here, though the flavor of the beets was outstanding.  And, while I'm a total sucker for almond cakes, the one we got was almost laughably simple for an $8 restaurant dessert - just a white slice of cake topped with a few poached cherries. Having said that, the crispy fried baby eggplants with ricotta like cheese and honey were fantastic, little exploding packages of crisp.   And we enjoyed the tender, flavorful, stewed tongue with peas and carrots, though wondered why there wasn't any accompanying rice or bread or couscous.  All in all, too expensive for too little.  It's such an attractive restaurant on such an attractive street that I wished for more, but I didn't get it.",3.0

The menu is interesting in that there is a wide variety of sizes of dishes. Too often, brunch is giant and if you want a smaller, lighter meal, you're stuck with yogurt. I had the poached eggs with artichokes & lima beans, which were really lovely and a perfect light start to the day. Everyone else's meals were also very tasty & on the smaller side, so if you're super hungry, be aware. The bloody marys were excellent.

"La Vara is tightly tucked into a very cute corner of Clinton Street, by the park. The location is perfect, and the space is a cute one, conducive to smaller groups overall, but it also has a few 5 and 6 tops, I believe. Service has been good so far, sometimes slow but usually just fine.The food is really wonderful. I have heard it's Jewish inspired Spanish, and that does not really show through to me, except perhaps in the chicken dish, but either way, the food is overall quite delicious. The eggplant fritters with honey, as many people have commented, are a must try. The flatbreads are all great. The chicken, well, I could make it at home, but my friend loved it. I have also had a special, this white bean soup with cod, which literally was the best soup I have ever had.

"As many have mentioned, the service at La Vara really shines. Everyone working in that restaurant was attentive, friendly, and warm, but not to the point where we felt suffocated. Also, the decor is great.The food was pretty good too. We tried a bunch of stuff. - Fried artichokes were a (predictable) greasebomb, but the accompanying aioli was delicious. - Salt cod salad had a nice texture thing going on, but the flavors were too restrained for my liking. - Corn soup (on special) was aggressively sweet and could've used some smoke, spice, or acid to cut through it. - Chicken hearts were awesome, but too few on the plate. (6 chicken hearts and a pile of herbs for ~$15? Really guys??) - Albondigas were a standout. Aggressive lamb flavor, excellent yogurt sauce. Better savor it though, as you get 5 marble sized meatballs.- Sausage stuffed cuttlefish, which was probably our favorite dish of the night, is the only one that I would say is a can't miss dish. - Fideua was just okay, a little oversalted. - A fig dessert on special was tasty, but it was really just yogurt and figs, which are in season now.We also had a couple of glasses of sherry each and a tasty, if unremarkable, bottle of Albariño. I left feeling underwhelmed, particularly after taking the hefty pricetag into account. Small plates should have a comparably small/reasonable price point and these didn't, so I won't be back.",3.0
"The flavors were amazing! Especially to our famished selves after waiting 45 mins for our table. But no worries, that's about what I expected. The staff was amazingly friendly ad accommodating.

"La Vara was the perfect dinner spot for our small group of four. Say yes to everything - it was all awesome. Fried artichokes - got an extra order. Andaluz-style skate is a must. Don't think too much about the menu, just order a lot. You won't be disappointed.",5.0
"I'm not one to jump on the ""new restaurant"" bandwagon, but when I took a look at La Vara's menu, I couldn't help but get excited. In print, each dish looked vibrant and exotic and refreshingly different from the classic farm-to-table, Southern American inspired restaurants here in Brooklyn.Boyfriend and I ordered 7 dishes in total, including dessert, so I'd say we gave the menu a fair chance. The dishes arrived in rapid succession--so rapidly in fact that we were done with all 7 dishes in under 30 minutes. Tiny plate after tiny plate hit the table and each one was only OK and nothing more. The huevos de codorniz were difficult to eat and not worth the payoff after all. The aceitunas hit the table strangely late in the procession of dishes, and were disappointing at best (there was no citrus, no herb, just a lot of oil).The berenjena con miel had a lot going for it texturally (crispy eggplant, soft cheese) but it lacked salt and the honey was nonexistent. Dish after dish fell flat, notably the fideúa, which my boyfriend (formerly a resident of Spain) was extremely excited to have. The flavor of the noodles was muddled--kind of like what happens when you're trying make a meal from what's left in your pantry and you end up with something that tastes sort of generally savory (hello soy sauce), but has no distinctive flavor.The one redemptive dish was a special that night, a cuttlefish stuffed with sobrasada. Finally! A little spice! A little contrast between the tender sweetness of the cuttlefish and the oily crumble of sausage!It should be noted that the dishes are sorrowfully small, so much so that my boyfriend suggested that we take photos of each dish with a penny on the plate for scale. I don't mind small servings, but I was tremendously unsatisfied--and not just because I was still hungry. I couldn't reconcile my menu-induced expectations and my 30-minute-meal experience.As we walked out of the restaurant, less than an hour after we walked in, my boyfriend said, ""Let's go get a loaf of bread."" And we did.",2.0
"Came with very high expectations and was hoping to get a similar experience as Tio Pol in Chelsea.

"In the restaurant industry service service is king.  We were excited to try the new restaurant by the owners of Txikito but almost walked out the door part way through.Arrived at 7:30 and put my name down for a 4-top. The host said that it would be about a 25 minute wait due to a table taking a while to finish up their meal.  We waited patiently by the bar having a drink while the minutes ticked by.  Enticing appetizers were being shuttled by us and the smell  of the kitchen was fantastic.  after 45 minutes I approached the host, who calmly apologized and said it wont be much longer. 20 minutes later i cornered him and said WTF.  His response was ""Oh...these people were ahead of you"".  I looked behind us and a brand new group of 4 were standing around ""our"" table.  I said to him we've been here for over an hour how can they be ahead of us?  He proceeded to call them by name saying that they have been here forever (obviously friends of his). At this point I was ready to curse this guy out and walk out, but Molly the bartender saved the night.   We ended up grabbing seats at the bar and had an amazing experience with the food and wine.  The anchovy appetizer fantastic and the Pork entree was cooked perfectly.  Overall a good meal that would have gotten 4 stars, but the 90 minute wait and preferential treatment to this jagoff's friends made it get knocked down.   I understand it's opening week and everyone wants to have their friends or whomever join, but service is king and at the end of the day, everyone is a customer.Thank you Molly for saving our dinner experience!",3.0
"The food is undeniably good but it's a tapas place and everything on the menu is meant to be shared, meaning the portions are tiny and you in no way fill up. So you keep ordering more and more until you realize it's pointless, you will never fill up and ask for the bill which by then comes up to an astronomical figure. Good business model.",3.0
"Come late, at a strange time, or be prepared to wait. La Vara is pretty tiny, although the bright lights keep it from feeling too cramped. We sat at the bar, and found the bartender/server incredibly engaging and attentive. Due to some allergy issues, we (ok, I) had a lot of questions, and she was really great about getting answers and not making a big fuss. I think La Vara really is a great addition to the neighborhood, but I'm with some other reviewers on the price. Their food/fullness/price ratio is just a bit off. The husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our very late dinner last weekend, but we walked away with a not unsubstantial bill...sans drinks. I could happily eat their eggplant dish every darn day. It was that good. And I really enjoyed the empanada-style cornmeal pockets with seafood. I was hoping to try the cuttlefish dish, but they were out by the time we arrived (well past 10pm).  The husband liked but didn't love their homemade pasta with goat. I couldn't try the pasta, but the tiny nibble of goat was good if a bit bland. We both really enjoyed dessert. His ""slice"" of date cake w/ lemon curd and cream was huge, and I found my rice pudding-ish/grapefruit dish a little strange but refreshing and delicious. If not for the memory of that eggplant dish, I'd probably give them 3 stars (just too expensive). But I think they earned that extra star. And if I'm being honest, I want them to stay in business so that I can go back any time I want (well, any time that not's prime dinner time) and eat that eggplant dish.",4.0
"It's hard for me to enjoy a meal more than this. Can't wait to go back.I shared a sizable meal with a girlfriend at the bar. We had probably a dozen small plates, capped at the end by the suckling pig (that's not what it's called, but it's the dish they're really known for. Crispy skin you have to crack with a fork; tender, gorgeous, moist shank...yum.) By far one of the best dishes was the salt cod salad with pomegranate seeds, olives, and a whole bunch of other fun stuff including citrus. It was a gorgeous plate, and so unique. The empanadas were sorta sweet, but nothing special. The chicken heart salad was really fantastically delicious for being so simple - the hearts come on a skewer on the side...The whole Ashkenazi/Moorish blend is pretty clever. The menu and the decor are refreshing. It's bright and airy. La Vara's menu is super creative, and the flavors live up to the promise. I hope they're appreciated, and don't lose their neighborhood comfortable feeling as they become more popular.",5.0
"My wife and I are huge fans of the proprietors' Manhattan basque tapas restaurant, Txikito: we have probably been over 30 times, including having our wedding reception dinner there back in 2010 because we so wanted our friends and family to sample our favorite restaurant. So since we have moved from Chelsea to Clinton Hill in 2011 we haven't gone back to Txikito so often. When I read Chef/owners Alex and Eder were opening a place in Brooklyn I was really looking forward to trying it out.I took my wife there for a recent birthday weekend dinner. We were not disappointed: different aesthetic vibe to Txikito, but the food was very similar with exquisite tastes and lots of kitchen TLC. I had both a superb cold cod salad (Remojón) and a skate special (what can I say I like fish) and my wife had the delicious daily Croquetas and Garbanzos Fritos to start. We both chose the half chicken (Pollo Asado) which with its cumin was really good. The staff were impressed we polished off two servings. Like at  Txikito the deserts are exquisite in flavor and we had the orange blossom scented date walnut tart, lemon curd, sweet cream (Egipcio) which might have been a dish to many, but it was a birthday dinner after all.Like Txikito another superb restaurant, where every dish is delicious and served with care. When I read less than 5 star reviews of either establishment I can only presume the authors favor sheer volume over flavor and good cooking. Their loss.",5.0
"As many have mentioned, the service at La Vara really shines. Everyone working in that restaurant was attentive, friendly, and warm, but not to the point where we felt suffocated. Also, the decor is great.The food was pretty good too. We tried a bunch of stuff. - Fried artichokes were a (predictable) greasebomb, but the accompanying aioli was delicious. - Salt cod salad had a nice texture thing going on, but the flavors were too restrained for my liking. - Corn soup (on special) was aggressively sweet and could've used some smoke, spice, or acid to cut through it. - Chicken hearts were awesome, but too few on the plate. (6 chicken hearts and a pile of herbs for ~$15? Really guys??) - Albondigas were a standout. Aggressive lamb flavor, excellent yogurt sauce.

Not sure if that is the best way to execute as it gets loud in there and you can't hear the lengthy, non-intuitive names  (ie mar Y montanas stands for a seafood dish).  Anyhow, the waitress actually commended herself on her ability to not need to take down the order, and her uncanny ability to recite all 40 specials off the top of her head.  Sadly, she got one of our dishes wrong...not a big deal, but we ended up paying for a dish we never ordered...Moving onto the food...Really delicious flavors...Listing top ten.Shrimp: Head on shrimp - cooked perfectly, head edibleSquid and pork ribbons- Call back to Txikito menu-also sitting in some type of delicious broth, not quire sure what it was- but this dish was killerFideua- Paella with seafood and sausage.  Got two orders it was so damn good.Lamb Meatballs- Perfection.Braised beef tongue- nicely braised and doused in a delectable tomato sauce.Other standards:Jamon and Pan con tomate- heads up, if you're a big cured meats fan, not a ton of that here, but included in some dishesHeirloom tomato salad with manchego- solidBacalalo stuffed peppers- Solidgreat cocktails, great cocktail glasses...nothing felt forced upon you (ie only spanish wines in short glasses, etc). pretty much everything you could want, including speedy service and a plethora of menu options.highly recommend. Great for a date or groups. My new favorite place.",4.0
"I love it here. La Vara is the best small plate restaurant that I've ever been to. Here you get what you pay for, every ingredient is top of the line. The service is amazing and the staff knows perfectly well what they have on the menu. The ambiance is perfect for a nice date or a small group gathering. Amazing wine list!",5.0
"An great date place in a great neighborhood, but please don't go to La Vara if you're tight on funds and/or extremely hungry.I asked my husband to take me there based on a positive review in a magazine, and while we really liked the ambiance, service and food, we knew we were in for a rude tapas awakening when we saw just how small the plates were.  We left there much lighter of pocket but still starving and went for ice cream afterward.",3.0
"Awesome!So many excellent small plates, order as many as you can muster. Great for getting a taste of everything.Each dish was better than the last, only slight points taken off for the addition of mint to the otherwise delicious chicken heart salad.",4.0
"Awesome food, but we had to wait two hours(!) for a table. Our friend was insistent on waiting, and it was great food! The staff was great and the food arrived quickly once we sat down. And they did warn us it would be two hours. I would probably eat here again but only with a reservation. (they don't take same day reservations)",4.0
"Walked in on a Friday night around 7;45. We called in advance and they weren't taking any more reservations, and the reservations on open table were booked. However, they still took walk ins and we ended up sitting at the bar right away. This place is small but really cute. All of the food was excellent. We had the deviled eggs, the kale rolls, the lamb meatballs and the chicken. Very cute ambiance and good food. Great for a date or a low key girls night.",5.0

Great spot for High end Tapas.  Tried a bunch of items on the menu and everything was delicious and extremely fresh.They don't take reservations reservations  and  the place is very small.   Get a beer or wine at the bar and expect to wait 45 min for a table.  This restaurant would get at least 4 stars if the table we sat at wasn't so close to another table that you feel like the person on another table is so close you'll think they are part of your party.,3.0
"I ended up writing a Yelp review a mere 2 hours after my meal ended, not because I'm such a huge fan of Yelp, but because I enjoyed my experience so much I had wanted to write a letter to the restaurant....unfortunately it turns out they don't have a website. So here I am. I can't remember the last time I had such an enjoyable experience at a NYC restaurant. The food was good. Like, REALLY, good. But we ate so many different things, I can't even begin to remember, much less review it all. Except for the Almond Cake. Save room for dessert. And don't plan on sharing. But what really sets La Vara apart is the service. Every single person we encountered - from the hostess, to the bartender, to the server, to the food runners - was so welcoming and so kind. From when I walked in to when we all left, I felt more like I was visiting a friend (who can really cook!) rather than sitting in a restaurant.I should mention that we were a group of women, old friends (some of us have been friends for 20+ years), that do our best to get together every other month. We all come from the restaurant business, but we're not all still in it. There seems to be something about a group of women dining out that make most servers cringe. We saw it when we worked in the business and we experience it when we dine out. And sure, after a few rounds of drinks we might get a little loud. But there's no dressing on the side, light butter, split the check 7 ways, with this group. We are out to enjoy each others company, some good food and some good wine. And La Vara was the perfect place to do just that. Thanks La Vara, now just get a website and an email address!",5.0
So glad we finally tried this place. The food was all amazing and plenty of dishes for my vegan wife. The staff were great and the chef is charming and is almost poetic in his description of dishes as he delivered them to our table.This may be the best place in this part of Bklyn. I don't remember what we had (don't remember what I had for breakfast) but it was all great.,5.0
"Expensive as all get out. As in, impossible to get full without mortgaging your house unless you do what we did and just fill up on bread. I'm pretty sure we tore through at least 4 plates of bread and it's not even like the bread is anything special. It's just a vehicle for sopping up all the delicious sauces/juices from the various dishes. I mean, don't get me wrong, the food is pretty great, albeit nothing mindblowing. I just don't think you can justify it given the tiny portion sizes and high cost. Believe me, I have no qualms about dropping large amounts of cash if it's justified (which in some cases it is), but I can't find it in myself to do it at La Vara. We ended up getting the eggplant w/ honey and cheese which was pretty stellar and followed that up with the lamb meatballs and mint yogurt. Again, another great dish and both had me licking the plate clean. It didn't help that the servers kept trying to clear dishes off before we had finished and yes, we had 3 or 4 different waiters attending us. It probably had something to do with us arriving shortly after opening for dinner so the place was pretty empty. We also got the stuffed rabbit loin (pretty decent) and the suckling pig which was fantastic (nice and tender inside with crispy crackling skin) but quite pricey at $30. The pacing was also pretty off as well as we often felt rushed to finish a dish so that the following dish wouldn't get cold (which ended up happening with our lamb). I can't really fault the food. I just wish prices were more reasonable for what you get... and we still had to get a second dinner a couple hours later to sate our hunger.",3.0

"Tasty tapas! Came here with high hopes since I had heard good things from friends in the neighborhood and the place did not disappoint.  All of the dishes sound, look, and, most importantly, taste amazing.  In particular, highlights were: (1) a scrapple-like dish of burnt chorizo bits and grape slices, (2) a fried eggplant dish, and (3) a sardine in oil with toast.  The food isn't cheap but it's great quality and a fun atmosphere.  It's small and doesn't take reservations for small parties, so plan on arriving and waiting for a table.  Worth it. My only regret? Not ordering the suckling pig appetizer - a regret I can and will remedy at my next trip.",4.0
"Good quality food and good service, but this is not the place to go if you have less money than brains. Other NYC tapas places will offer the same or better quality for a much better price. Unfortunately, La Vara does not live up to the hype, and I would not return or recommend to a friend.",2.0

"Take note, Buttermilk Channel, Frankie's, Talde, and the rest of you overhyped restaurants - this place is the real deal, and you should all be taking notes.My husband has been wanting to try this place because he is a Spanish Jew. We walked in for dinner this evening, and were greeted by the nicest people. We were seated immediately, which was fabulous. This place is not overdone. It's actually quite lovely. Our waitress was just awesome. She was friendly, knowledgable, and ever present, without being overbearing. She even asked us from the beginning if there was anything at all that we couldn't eat. That was really cool as my husband has recently been diagnosed with a disorder that prevents him from having anything with seeds.To start, my husband had the quail egg appetizer, and I had the fried eggplant. Wow! I didn't have any quail egg, but my husband seemed to really like it. The eggplant was amazing. It was very lightly fried eggplant sticks, over honey and a soft cheese. I've never had anything like it. Even after I finished the eggplant, I dipped the bread in the cheese just to finish it. We shared a glass of sangria. It was wonderful. Authentic, and not at all saccharine. For our main course, my husband had the noodle paella, and I had the half chicken. My husband loved his paella, only he wished it had been a bit bigger. The chicken was delicious. Cooked perfectly, tender, and the skin was just amazing. It was sitting in a juice/broth, with caramelized onions. It was savory, and flavorful. I was surprised it didn't have anything on the side, but I'm not going to complain. It was a big dish. I had to take some of it home. Once we finished, our waitress kindly wrapped my chicken up in the cutest aluminum package that she fashioned herself (sometimes, it's the little oohs, and ahhs that can be exciting). We didn't think we were going to have dessert, but we decided to look at the menu. Our waitress told us of a special dessert they were serving- a french toast-type dessert with a syrup that I cannot remember. We decided on that. Holy g-d!!!!! It was like a little french toast custard of sexiness. I honestly didn't think it was going to be so good. One of the few times we actually savored dessert. We didn't want it to end. My only real gripe is that they allow very young children after sundown. As the mother of an 8 year old, sometimes I want to go somewhere nice without kids. And when i'm paying good money, I don't feel like hearing screaming toddlers, throwing utensils on the floor. It's completely disrespectful, and we all know that Cobble Hill, and Park Slope parents cannot be trusted to mind their own little heathens. The restaurant should put in a policy about this. As far as price goes- they are a bit on the expensive side. However, this is one of those times when it was actually worth it. It's one of those restaurants you go to when you want to treat out-of-towners, or a romantic partner to something really different, and amazing. This place will win you points, regardless.",4.0

"I love small plates. With a few adventurous people, you can try such an array of flavors. La Vara is a very small restaurant.

The menu is extensive with good selections in various categories of fried, bread, salad, warm and other categories. Vegetarians rejoice! There are many good selectins for you. The list of specials was long and they all sounded great. In fact our order went something like this ""we'll take them all"". We excluded two of about 8 specials and picked 4 items from the menu. Lots of stuff I had never had: sea anemone (sorry Nemo, your house is delicious and tastes like oysters) andsea cucumber (bit firm of texture but delicious). The only dish that missed was a special salt cod relleno (stuffed pepper); not because it wasn't delicious, just because it wasn't as great as all of the others. The winners were the regular menu lamb breast and eggplant & honey, the special suckling pig, a special squash and black-eyed pea dish, and the sea cucumber. Everything was awesome, and the server was genuinely appreciative of our wait and very helpful with the menu. The wine list was reasonably priced with great picks. This place rules.",5.0

"Found this place through a yelp search and was very satisfied with my choice. We went during the week and did not have a reservation, however only waited about 10 mins for two seats at the bar. A table was going to be available soon, but we were hungry and not picky about where we were sitting. I would give the food here a 4 but the service was a clear 5 were we were. The bartender was attentive and soooo friendly and knowledgable. The restaurant was featuring a list of specials that all sounded delicious, so we ordered 3 of them: tomato cucumber salad with fried baby shrimp on top, green peppers stuffed with cod, and cauliflower fritters. All were delicious. The salad was particularly tasty and the texture was interesting because of the small crunchy shrimp. After that we ordered the tomato bread with cured tuna and nori and the seafood paella. My other half loved the tomato bread and it might have been his favorite. I, on the other hand, wasn't a huge fan since I am not really into intense fishy flavor. Last, but not least, the seafood paella was amazing. Oh my, so good. It was perfectly seasoned and packed wi seafood. Definitely the favorite for me. The wine selection was good, and the cocktails looked interesting. Dessert would have been amazing but we were stuffed. Overall, you won't be sorry for checking this place out. The food is great, the restaurant is very cute and the staff was pleasant and attentive. It's not very big though so if you plan on a weekend, a walk up might not work out for you.",4.0
"Lovely styled place, with nice service and a few tables that don't make you feel like you are on a train during rush hour. However it is overpriced for what they give you. The staff made a suggestion as to how many dishes for us to order and although I agree with others that the eggplant is great, it just wasn't enough food at all to call it dinner. If you leave an establishment thinking about the possibility of pizza later or wondering if you have a snack at home, its not worth it. I'd looked forward to the possibility of returning, but the food is not consistently good enough nor sized correctly to make that possible whether or not I have a wage raise. Makes me a little sad as its in my new neighborhood.",3.0
"Just a great evening of food! Terrific, well informed staff.  Very helpful with the extensive menu. Helped us create  an incredible meal. Plenty of food in  with all the different plates. Small, medium and large. Highlights: fired chick peas, salted cod salad, Paella (with noodles, not rice. Valencia style) suckling pig special (awesome with crispy skin) . The Egypt style dessert with dates and lemon curd, stunning. I really loved this place.",5.0
"If I lived in Brooklyn, I'd come here all the time. I'm from the New York area and this is one of the best restaurants I've ever been to. I also spent some time in Spain and La Vara's tapas were way better than any I've tasted there. My boyfriend and I came on a Saturday evening. We only had to wait 30 minutes which wasn't so bad. At first I was a little hesitant to sit at the bar, but the bartender was great company and served us some delicious Sangria. I don't remember everything I got, but all the dishes were orgasmic. I savored each and everyone. When I left the restaurant I felt so full and happy. And that's the beauty of a good restaurant. 5 stars all the way, you can't go wrong here.",5.0

"I love Spanish food. I've been to. Barcelona among other areas and especially loved Catalon cuisine. I've been to the sister restos to la Vara and liked them a lot, but I think this place tops them, a not just because we were desperate for a place like this in Cobble Hill. Briefly, the place is lovely, the service very good and the food.  Imaginative and phenomenally delicious. I felt like I was in Barcelona. We had everything from tongue to chicken hearts to braised beef cheek, but there's plenty there for less adventurous eaters. The wine list is good as well. It gets crowded on weekends, so arrive early or plan on sitting at the lively bar, my preference. I'm so happy to have this place close!",5.0

"Found this place through a yelp search and was very satisfied with my choice. We went during the week and did not have a reservation, however only waited about 10 mins for two seats at the bar. A table was going to be available soon, but we were hungry and not picky about where we were sitting. I would give the food here a 4 but the service was a clear 5 were we were. The bartender was attentive and soooo friendly and knowledgable. The restaurant was featuring a list of specials that all sounded delicious, so we ordered 3 of them: tomato cucumber salad with fried baby shrimp on top, green peppers stuffed with cod, and cauliflower fritters. All were delicious. The salad was particularly tasty and the texture was interesting because of the small crunchy shrimp. After that we ordered the tomato bread with cured tuna and nori and the seafood paella. My other half loved the tomato bread and it might have been his favorite. I, on the other hand, wasn't a huge fan since I am not really into intense fishy flavor. Last, but not least, the seafood paella was amazing. Oh my, so good. It was perfectly seasoned and packed wi seafood. Definitely the favorite for me. The wine selection was good, and the cocktails looked interesting. Dessert would have been amazing but we were stuffed. Overall, you won't be sorry for checking this place out. The food is great, the restaurant is very cute and the staff was pleasant and attentive. It's not very big though so if you plan on a weekend, a walk up might not work out for you.",4.0
"Lovely styled place, with nice service and a few tables that don't make you feel like you are on a train during rush hour. However it is overpriced for what they give you. The staff made a suggestion as to how many dishes for us to order and although I agree with others that the eggplant is great, it just wasn't enough food at all to call it dinner. If you leave an establishment thinking about the possibility of pizza later or wondering if you have a snack at home, its not worth it. I'd looked forward to the possibility of returning, but the food is not consistently good enough nor sized correctly to make that possible whether or not I have a wage raise. Makes me a little sad as its in my new neighborhood.",3.0
"Just a great evening of food! Terrific, well informed staff.  Very helpful with the extensive menu. Helped us create  an incredible meal. Plenty of food in  with all the different plates. Small, medium and large. Highlights: fired chick peas, salted cod salad, Paella (with noodles, not rice. Valencia style) suckling pig special (awesome with crispy skin) . The Egypt style dessert with dates and lemon curd, stunning. I really loved this place.",5.0
"If I lived in Brooklyn, I'd come here all the time. I'm from the New York area and this is one of the best restaurants I've ever been to. I also spent some time in Spain and La Vara's tapas were way better than any I've tasted there. My boyfriend and I came on a Saturday evening. We only had to wait 30 minutes which wasn't so bad. At first I was a little hesitant to sit at the bar, but the bartender was great company and served us some delicious Sangria. I don't remember everything I got, but all the dishes were orgasmic. I savored each and everyone. When I left the restaurant I felt so full and happy. And that's the beauty of a good restaurant. 5 stars all the way, you can't go wrong here.",5.0

"A terrific place to order a bottle of wine and some tapas. Located where Café Clinton used to be, Lauren Vara has undergone a complete renovation. Gone is the dilapidated bar interior. The interior is now white and silver. The patio remains but it too has been renovated. The wine menu is a winner. Plenty of range. I'm surprised they don't offer flights. It would be a great way to enjoy their tapas. Some tapas are what you would expect at a Spanish restaurant but many are unique. I was impressed with the very long list of daily specials and pleased that the waiter told us the price of each one. No sticker shock here but it does get very busy.

At a little over $30 per person before tip (one drink per person), I was pleasantly surprised at the value and full (but definitely not stuffed).

"The experience of eating at La Vara - open just six months, the waitress told me - was confusing. The idea was enchanting: culinary conviviencia, the peaceful encounter, for several generations, of Jews, Catholics and Muslims in medieval Spain. Service was gracious and charming. On the plate, the enchanting idea of fusion succeeded sometimes, sometimes not. We went early, without reservation: no trouble being seated. Delightful, attentive service. I probably know more about the waitress than I should!It was the food that was confusing. Appetizers worked fine: marinated sardines and fresh kale rolled in small tacos were  fresh and authentic. My rabbit entree was puzzling: bright,  pungent saucing with tasteless meat: American rabbit just doesn't have the taste of rabbit in Spain or France (like poultry in general). The dish would have been wonderful with Spanish rabbit, but didn't work with local material. My son's entree was an insult to the idea of lamb: the basic content (really? meat? lamb???) was tasteless, treated with an interesting crust of Moroccan spice. A Mallorcan flat bread and its topping were delicious. Desserts were quite good. Dishes are small and unsatisfying.

It was excellent - and the heads were still on the shrimp (very authentic and tasty).  The lamb meatballs were a little dry, and the empanadas and the croquettes were both a disappointment.  The special that night was a stuffed zuchini over a fresh tomatoe sauce - wow - that was something special.  Perfect combination and very creative.  The sangria was superb - perfectly light and not too sweet.  Service was great - very friendly and inviting.  I'll be heading back....but warning:  nothing at La Vara blew me away, except the sangria.  Reason enough to go back, but over the long-term a signature dish will be needed.",4.0

"Let's get one thing out of the way upfront: The chef here is talented and capable of creating wonderful dishes. That's the good part. The ONLY good part. There's zero love here. Everything conspires against the potential of the food. This restaurant seems to be run by people who really don't like people, and wish they would stay away. So while  the food's quality ranges from decently good to excellent, it's served in absurdly, insanely (even for NY) tiny portions. Example: A $14 salad at brunch consistent of a very small plate of chopped vegetables and maybe half an ounce of minced (canned) tuna. It would've been an adequate amount to make one bruschetta, no more. Yet the waitress steered my wife towards it claiming it was more of an entree size than the shrimp salad she initially wanted. Bread with your meal? Not unless you ask for it, and even then, it will be stale (on two occasions) and served with no butter or oil. Over three visits, we discovered that not a single thing here is entree sized. It may be called an entree, it will certainly be priced like an entree, but they are, at best, moderate appetizers. Imagine a tapas restaurant at quadruple the normal price - which in NY is already high- and you'll get the idea. So the value is abysmal. You can easily spend $50-$75 per person on food alone here and leave hungry. This isn't the upper east side, where you can get away with that kind of nonsense.

It was perfect.  We finished with 2 Entrees... The tongue and the cumin lamb.  Both were outstanding.  We went to the Chocolate Room for dessert because we were craving a brownie sundae, but the dessert menu looked amazing....

"The food, quite simply was rockin' .  My Wife and I get few nights out together these days, so after hearing about La Vara from a few friends for weeks and weeks, we finally stopped in and sat at the bar for dinner.  Firstly, the bartender was very helpful.  He guided my wife into the right glass of wine, and was not at all judgmental when I ordered Vodka, as bartenders these days often are.  We ordered the fried chickpeas which were holy crap awesome...Followed up by sardines.  I never met me a sardine I didn't love and these did not disappoint,  We then shared the salt cod and citrus salad... It was perfect.  We finished with 2 Entrees... The tongue and the cumin lamb.  Both were outstanding.  We went to the Chocolate Room for dessert because we were craving a brownie sundae, but the dessert menu looked amazing.... We can't wait to go back to eat more of the menu.  It's one of those menus that makes it impossible to decide because you wish you could order it all.",5.0
