"Awesome spot! My avocado egg sandwich came on an amazing biscuit and was absolutely great! The perfect brunch. It is pretty tight to squeeze around tables with big winter coats on, but it's very small and quaint. A great place to huddle up for an afternoon with your laptop and some great food and coffee. Their Mexican Hot Chocolate sounds amazing but is probably too hot for me...I'd ask about it though!",5.0
"Went to this cafe on my recent trip to New York. It was right across the street from my friends apartment and was the third stop in our quest for a good bacon egg and cheese (people run out of bagels in New York... who knew!) My bacon egg and cheese was good. I liked how they used a panini press, it made it a little unique in comparison to the regular bagel shops. I liked the crispy outer shell.The space was super cute and it was a nice day so we sat outside. The only weird thing is that I noticed the owner scolding her workers- which was kind of awkward... Your customers notice these things!",3.0
"Really steamy entry (windows fogged and no sign isn't the best way to attract customers, but hey) and a tight space once you're inside. The Cheddar Chive Biscuit was a solid buy for $3.27; appears on your CC as Buenos baby llc.",4.0
"Came in for breakfast on a Wednesday morning. I read a lot of reviews before going in so I was sure to order the Fulton sandwich. I'm not a big fan of meat so this was the perfect breakfast for me, it was filling but not too heavy. The coffee was also great, after ordering hot coffee, I changed my mind to iced coffee and the barista changed it for me right away. Overall, food was great and so was the service. Will definitely be back",4.0
"Love this place, great atmosphere, delicious breakfast sandwiches, friendly service, sweet playlist.",5.0
"This is an extremely cozy cafe that serves breakfast and brunch. I absolutely love it for a laid back breakfast sandwich/brunch. As almost every other reviewer has said - get the Fulton sandwich. It's great, even without meat, and I was surprised to see that it filled me up. The cheddar cayenne chive biscuit is heavy and dense, super tasty. For $7, it's so affordable and includes avocado.My only gripe would be that we constantly had to ward off flies, but I'm guessing as cooler weather draws nearer, that won't be a lasting problem.",4.0
"This is one of my favorite cafe/coffee shops in the area.Get anything with their cayenne, cheddar & chive biscuit or just by itself. They are seriously the best! The place is small and cozy up front but has a big table in the back and a small outdoor area with extra room. The storefront is basically unmarked so keep your eyes open as your walking down Fulton on the north side or you might miss it.",5.0
"My first time in Lunitas I really loved it. It was a cute and cozy place. Small local business. Amazing food. All the things I care for. However, each time I returned I got disappointed. This little gem, became a hole in the wall. Let me start off by saying the word about the place can not maintain what it's trying to produce. It's basically got on bread and butter thing, the Fulton sandwich. It's good, it's damn good. It's a top ten breakfast sandwich in Brooklyn. Truth. It's not to die for though. There are better options for breakfast. Yes that bun is perfect. If you get it with bacon it's amazing! There are better breakfast sandwiches though, and that's the only thing this place provides. It's not even a good deal like how most mom and pop shops are. I can go to two Dominican restaurants that are nearby, that provide more options, better food and half the cost. The only other thing they had worth eating was the empanadas. The empanadas cost $4 each! While that's not a lot of money, for an empanada it is. Then comes getting a seat. It's cool if you want to be a place that has people sit themselves. It's another to not enforce any regulations and let people be complete morons. One of the times I returned, every seat was taken. There's a two hour table limit, but there were people there doing nothing. Just sitting there, not eating. Not doing anything. No one is enforcing these rules. And if you have paying customers, you have to realize the person who is just sitting there charging his iPhone has to go. I placed an order and they asked if I'd like to eat there. I said, yes but there doesn't appear to be any seating. They told me I can sit at the communal table in the back. That table was occupied by a whole group of friends who just went cycling together. I wasn't going to sit in the back with a bunch of strangers, sitting off the edge of a bench, trying to eat with them, like a weirdo who crashed their party. I waited till someone finally rose. Eventually a couple got up, and they didn't bother to clean up their mess. I sat down, and moved away from the table. I wasn't going to bus it. Eventually they came over with my food, and the waitress looked puzzle. I explained It wasn't going to touch someone's mess. She gave a look and cleaned it off poorly. I ate my meal, which to me has lost it's allure. And left, not before busing my own table. I may not have been happy, but I'm a decent human being. I think I'm over it. If you want good authentic food, there are tons of better options. With more space, that cost less money, and have way more options. I don't think I'll be returning.",3.0
"So the food looks just like the photos. But I'm writing not purely on my opinion of the food. I found a hair on my Fulton with bacon. Super awkward for me cause I hate to be ""that guy"" especially while being black in Brooklyn. So my boyfriend brought it up. Now I'm not adding photos since this isn't about the hair so much as the response to it. My boyfriend goes and tells whom were assuming is the owner. When the conversation gets to me this is were I feel awkward. He mentions he has a hat on and offers to give me another one. At this point, good or not, I'm okay not having anymore of the meal made over or not. I ask for an oatmeal instead. He didn't charge use for my sandwich which I would not expect to pay for. But I was charged for my oatmeal that replaced it. Now understand its not the cost or anything that made me feel awkward. My opinion is more that it would have made more sense to comp my meal at the least so that I didn't feel like he thought I put the hair in my food. Beyond anything it just gave me a bad vibe. Of course this is an incident and things happen. He apologized and that's that I suppose.",3.0
"If you find yourself in Clinton make sure to stop by for the best breakfast sandwich you have ever had. Seriously, they run out so don't wait all day. The coffee is solid but the Fulton is avocado eggs, and secret sauce that will drive your taste buds crazy. Truly a mom and pop store with very nice owners that care about their business. I had the fore mentioned food and drinks and left moaning still...",5.0
"I had the FuLton which seems to be the special. The presentation of my plate was amazing and I forgot to take a picture UGH. The own is such a sweet woman. She greeted me with a smile.

"Searching for breakfast/brunch places on Yelp! and stumbled onto this place, which, at the time, had all 5-star reviews, so I was anxious to visit.At the recommendation of fellow Yelpers, I went for the Fulton egg sandwich. It was outstanding. You can't go wrong with a cheddar chive cayenne biscuit. That biscuit had some kick, too! Eggs were perfectly cooked. Avocado was fresh.What I really love, though, is how quaint and cozy this place is, especially on this rainy day. The couple who run the place are so sweet, and the space is incredibly calm. We should all take a lesson in zen from them. The entire operation - all the cooking and food prep, the coffee brewing - everything - is done in a small space behind the counter. How do they work without killing each other?The decaf is made to order in a press. It was very good.Tip: plan your visit soon. This place is about to explode and there will be a line for blocks to get inside.",5.0
"Amazing little spot with one of the best breakfast sandwiches I have eaten. Their signature sandwich, the Fulton, has scrambled egg, herbs, tomato, and avocado on a cheddar/chive/cayenne biscuit. (Yes, you read that right). And you can add bacon if you're so inclined, as I was.  This is a tiny place with a genuine, laid back vibe. Your meal is prepared right behind the counter in one of the littlest kitchens I've seen, by friendly folks who clearly enjoy their customers and making great food. We owe our visit to Yelpers as the 5 star review got our attention while looking for a new place for breakfast in this part of town.",5.0
"I'll add my voice to the chorus:  the Fulton is a damn good breakfast sandwich.   Fresh eggs, avocado, spicy/cheesy biscuit...delicious.  And the Brooklyn Roasting Company coffee is top notch.  Lunitas is a bit of a walk from our place, but will definitely be in the breakfast rotation going forward.However:  trying to sit down to eat here is a pain in the butt.  There's usually a big crowd in a small space on weekend mornings, and it's a free-for-all for any available seats.  Plus you have all the usual coffee shop frustrations of people setting up their computers to use the wifi for hours on end (this should not be condoned during prime breakfast/brunch time), groups sitting but not eating or lingering over their empty plates when a dozen people are standing around.  The atmosphere would be much more pleasant if the staff would be more active in managing the restaurant--hate having to take my Fulton to go and end up eating cold eggs when I get home.",3.0

"- This place is great for egg lovers.

"Lunitas is the little spot that could.  This Argentinian-like cafe has some great breakfast specials and little bites that are quite scrumptious.  Wasn't planning to, but tried the house favorite The Fulton, which with its cheddar-chive biscuit, egg, tomato and avocado is quite tasty.  I can imagine with the ham it was that much better, but a brother doesn't go there.  The service is also very nice, which is always my number one thing to squabble at (yes, I'm talking about you National).  However, the most amazing aspect of this place is that they do all this with a hot plate stove, toaster over, what looks to be a salamander (sp) [not the lizard], and not much else.  I'm positive they make those biscuits elsewhere though.  Regardless, I'm glad that the check-ins from Yelp friends and reviews from others are accurate. Though very cozy, it is definitely worth the return.",4.0
"Sometimes, as in the case of Lunitas, pros and cons are the same. It's narrow and new enough to make most people walk by, but also small and new enough to give you a sense of real peace and quiet. And you might just walk in and love or hate the vintage café mix-match furniture, authentic enough to give you the sense of a Cuban paradise, beautifully rustic and beat down. This café's charm is ugly/pretty to the  fullest extent. I'm wise enough to know that's not for everyone. Even though it should be, strong coffee isn't my forte, so I wasn't particularly in love with the latte. But I was impressed with the just-right-spiced Mexican hot chocolate and the cheddar jalapeno scone. Mmmmmhmmmm. Found some music in that little treat of goodness. I just wished it were warm and straight out of the oven.I'll be back to celebrate the quiet at Lunitas and to try the much-loved Fulton.",4.0

Came here for breakfast and had the Fulton breakfast sandwich. It was delicious ! Scrambled egg topped with avocado on a cheddar cayenne biscuit. The biscuit isn't the traditional southern crunchy exterior and soft flaky interior type of biscuit. The flavor put me more in the mind of a jalepeno cornbread muffin but not as dense.

The owner is muy simpatico and plays great music.EAT-The Fulton egg sandwich on the cheddar chive jalepeño biscuit - savory goodness -Fruit/Granola/Yogurt - no skimping whatsoever - freshest variety of fruit-Empanadas - all homemade, you can taste the love!I love this spot. Best cafe in the hood. The only way this place could get better is if they had homemade whipped cream for their hot chocolates. I haven't checked on this matter but will look into it come winter and report back.NOM.",5.0
"Lunitas seriously is as good as it gets.Went for the first time based on Yelp reviews, and now I'm a regular. Can't recommend the Fulton enough -- the eggs are delicious and the biscuit is fantastic. The iced coffee is exquisite and the owners are as nice as can be.",5.0
"I can't begin to explain how amazing this place is.  From the coffee to the specialities, the baked goods to the sandwiches, everything at Lunitas is top of the line.  They have even redefined the breakfast staple of bacon, egg, and cheese (didn't think one could improve upon a classic... I was wrong).  The owners are two of the most wonderful people one can meet.  This is truly a hidden gem!",5.0
Wow this place is amazing!! This is going to be my new breakfast spot! The fulton is my favorite! The decor is very nice and hip.  Friendly staff  now I understand why this place has 5 stars! this place rocks!,5.0
Tried the Fulton sandwich and it was awesome. The past reviews about this dish were correct. Kinda tastes like spicy Red Lobster biscuit with eggs. I will be back!,5.0
"I went yesterday to take advantage of the first truly warm day of the year. It is a narrow little place but it is bright and airy. I ordered a panini, but they were out of their usually bread so they put it on a croissant instead. I was a little hesitant at first, but it was delicious! If prices were .50-1.00 cheaper than I would have given it a 5 star rating.",4.0

"I'm not sure if this is supposed to be an Argentine cafe (I don't think the food is particularly Argentine), or if it's just that the owners are Argentine. But regardless, it's a very cute cafe to stop in for breakfast/brunch. Their semi-spicy cheesy biscuits are delicious, so any sandwich that involves them is probably going to be good. The food was fresh and healthy-tasting, and they played some great music (in Spanish, of course). Lunitas is a nice place to hang out for brunch or grab a coffee.",4.0
"Cozy place, deeeelicious food and really, really good service. The Fulton sammich was stupendous, the empanada fantasic and the coffee really good. Really great place.",5.0
"Let me preface this review by stating that I am Cuban, and I am fully aware of what a good empanada should taste like. Saying this, Lunitas prepares some very authentic flavors for the empanadas. Although the fillings are not your typical beef, chicken or cheese, somehow the authentic flavor stands out and is wonderfully complimented by other fusion notes. You have to try their empanadas as well as their chimichurri (which is very authentic as well). Other than that, their pastries, coffee and other breakfast items are delicious as well. Go to this place, people. Right now if you can.",5.0
"place was a total win. Good service by nice people, great coffee, and delicious food, both hot and pastries. Also has a really cool vibe.",5.0
What a great spot! I came in as they were opening and got terrific service by the owner. The space is comfortable for homework/work. The music isn't too loud and there are outlets a plenty. They have a 2 hour limit at the tables though I'm sure this is flexible esp if you're spending $. I think I found my new study spot. Oh! Brooklyn Roasters coffee served here and the food was delicious. Hot and cold options!,5.0
I just spent a nice few hours here and loved it! Delicious food and drinks and wonderful atmosphere/music. The owner I met was super friendly and nice to talk to!,5.0

Was pretty disappointed in this place. Cute spot but the Fulton sandwich I had high hopes for and it wasn't the greatest. I think the cheddar biscuit it was on was doughy and it was missing something. The eggs and avo on it were good but just was disappointed.,2.0
What a treat  .the cappuccino  was perfection as was the French pressed coffee. ..as a side we got yogurt with nuts and strawberries. ..the Fulton breakfast sandwich to die for. A real bright spot.,5.0
Came by for a to go breakfast. It's really a one man show and since I was on the go it took longer than expected. I opted for the Fulton. An it wasn't bad my only grip it was a bit cold by the time I received it. Overall it was ok. I think the corner deli would have been hotter and cheaper!!,3.0
"Really cute place in the neighborhood.  Service,  food, ambiance is all equally great! I went there for brunch and had The Fulton with Bacon...delicious! Also, go early on  weekends as it is quite small and gets packed quickly.",5.0

"This place is awesome. Friendly staff, delicious food, some of the better coffee in the area, and quite reasonable prices. Strongly recommend The Fulton with chorizo. All it needs is a liquor license and some more seating and it could be a truly stellar brunch.",5.0
Such an amazing sweet spot that serves breakfast & lunch. Food is delish. The owners are the nicest people with beautiful kids. I love that they have children's books to occupy the kiddos when they come in with their parents. It's a quaint hidden lil spot that is serving this neighborhood more than just good food but also positive vibes. P.s. The Fulton sandwich is a must when you come here.,5.0
Great little place with friendly service. Very relaxing atmosphere. Simple and tasty dishes - will be coming back!,5.0
"I really adore this place. It's beautifully decorated and the owners did a fantastic job fixing up the space. Personally, going to Outpost gives me a lot of anxiety and I can't seem to get comfortable. Lunitas is the perfect alternative. The owners are really sweet and friendly, and overall, the entire place is a lot more welcoming. I haven't dabbled too much in the food department, but I hear they now serve empanadas so I'm sold.",5.0
"Best place for a yummy breakfast sandwich with a Latin twist.  This place is airy and bright with a children's corner in the back, toys and books available.  Try the Fulton with chorizo.",5.0
"We usually go to Outpost, which I don't like very much, and when it was full (as always) we decided to come across the street to Lunitas. Plenty of space, pleasant, quiet music, good coffee (all things that Outpost does not have!), and yummy looking food. Definitely my new neighborhood favorite. Also, they have a really cute kid's clothing store in the back!Also also, pastries are half off after 3pm!",5.0
"One of my favorite breakfast / lunch spots. Great service, fresh food, quiet atmosphere... Highly recommended !",5.0
"In a strange oasis of coffee shops, Lunitas reigns king. Nothing beats a hard-working small business that cares about its customers as much as its products. The staff are friendly and welcoming, the coffee is delicious, and the music is usually tasty (and the empanadas are killer!). It's hard not to smile when you're here, and the backyard will be crucial once it's open. Great job, guys!",5.0
"Lunitas is my go-to place in the neighbourhood. The food has always been great but it's getting better and better. The oatmeal, the omelette, and the empanadas are all great. But the sandwiches are the real deal. I tried a new sandwich yesterday that's not on the menu yet -- best sandwich I've had in a long time.I tried the blueberry and mint drink this afternoon. Exactly what I needed after being in the sun all morning.The owners are really friendly and it's a great place to read or work.",5.0

"Fantastic and much needed coffee shop in the neighborhood! I don't even really want to write this review because I'm afraid that this place will get discovered and everyone from the overcrowded Outpost will cross the street and take all the open seats.

"The rare 5-star review! This place deserves it. I just visited for the first time; the service was friendly and the food delicious. The egg sandwiches are pricey, but it's not the case (like with so many other places) that the prices are jacked up only to pay the rent-- ingredients were fresh and well put together. I ordered the Fulton, which was, come to think that other coffee shops charge $3.50 for the cheddar/chive/cayenne biscuit, kind of a steal at $7.",5.0
"A friend invited me to breakfast, suggesting Lunita's.  Now, I live right down the block from Lunita's but for the months that it has been open, I have not stepped in once. I'm an Outpost regular, so that was part of it. But also, the building that houses Lunita's just doesn't really catch the eye. I pass it by every single day on my way to the subway to go to work.I said to my friend, ""Why not Outpost?"" She replied that she liked Outpost and Lunita's both - that it wasn't a competition between the two. Now, having met her there for breakfast, I see exactly what she means. Lunita's is *wonderful* - the owners and staff are friendly. The coffee is strong and delicious. And best of all, they offer what Outpost doesn't and seemingly never will - cooked food. Namely, EGGS. Egg sandwiches, egg plates. That's a game-changer.Plus, let's face it. We love Outpost but sometimes it's a goddamn cluster. I think if you're looking for a quiet heart-to-heart with someone, Lunita's might be a better option. (Have to say, though, if it's Oatmeal you're looking for, stick to Outpost. They are the kings and queens of that particular breakfast item.)All in all, I'm very glad to have popped into Lunita's that one time, because I've done it since then, and will continue to.",5.0
"I am sure I will never go to Outpost again.  These guys are a much better experience.  I visited here three times during my recent trip to Brooklyn.  Every sandwich was excellent, every cup of coffee superb.  The husband/wife team really make you feel welcome, they engage you in conversation, they make a serious effort to get to know you.  I felt like I was with friends while I was in Lunitas.  The Fulton sandwich is excellent, you must try it.  The caprese sandwich was delicious.  They cook to order, so its always fresh and warm.  The coffee is hand pressed throughout the day and I really loved their coffee.  Cannot wait to come back to Brooklyn to visit with them and try some more of their wonderful coffee and food offerings.  You must walk past Outpost and cross the street to try this place.  You will not be sorry.",5.0
"Lunita's is my go-to spot. The space and staff are charming, the coffee/food excellent (especially  the Fulton, egg sandwich on cheddar chive biscuit), and they always play delightful music. Also, in the back there are children's clothes/toys for sale (will definitely hit that up for friends' baby showers and kids birthdays) and a nice spot for bigger groups to sit.",5.0
"It's unassuming and easy to walk past, but this is seriously the most chill spot in the neighborhood. They have a small menu, but everything is fresh and delicious and very reasonably priced.

"I love eggs. I eat them every morning before work, but on the weekends I make them myself because there's no place around my apartment that serves just scrambled eggs on a plate. I was 100% truly just complaining about this and the fact that I had a headache and had to make breakfast myself when I happened to walk by Lunitas. I decided I'd just grab a bagel, but when I walked in, I noticed that THEY. MAKE. EGGS. Fresh eggs! Any way you want them! And the coffee? Superb. I hate to bring up the competitor *ahem* Outpost *ahem* across the street, but I will never go there again. Lunitas' owners are friendly, it has a family vibe and it's decorated in such a way that I felt like I was world's away from NY. It's also so fairly priced that I thought they made a mistake. I ordered two eggs and a large iced coffee which came to just over $5. I told them they must have the price wrong, but he assured me that's all it costs. Needless to say, this is my new go-to place in the neighborhood to get some work done, read or just grab some good eggs & coffee.",5.0

"Lunitas is just the platonic ideal of the cute Brooklyn coffee shop. Owned / operated by an adorable couple who always have their adorable baby on the premises. Probably because they just opened and they're looking to gain a toehold they are super doting - like friendliest coffee shop employees in history. Pastries are quality. Coffee is french press - sometimes they let it get a lil bit too gritty, but they keep it strong / fresh. They sell handmade baby clothes.
