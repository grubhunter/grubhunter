"I was planning to have brunch at a another restaurant, but they told me that there would be a 1 hour wait. So I decided to come here instead, and I was pleasantly surprised by the food and the service:Turmeric: fresh turmeric, ginger, lemon, agave and soda water. It's a spicy drink that boost the digestion.GF Burger: spicy roasted corn and pinto bean burger with chipotle mayo, lettuce, tomato, avocado, Brooklyn Brine pickles served on house made GF bread with choice of seasoned potato wedges or salad. I haven't had a burger for ages. I was glad that this burger is made with vegetables and gluten-fee. A lot of places that makes vegetarian or vegan burgers aren't necessarily gluten-free. Also, I was concerned that there would be too much bread. But I was pleased that the bread was rather small, the same size and thickness of the corn and bean burger. It's very crumbly, which makes the burger easier to eat with a fork than with the hands. The corn and bean burger was on the dry side. Fortunately, there's the mayo and the garnish to moist it up. The potato wedges are baked with sage leaves and served with ketchup sauce.It's a nice place for brunch with mostly communal tables.",5.0
"I've been here twice in the past year and I must say - this is my favorite vegan restaurant!  This place is super convenient to get to as it is right by Atlantic Ave.  It has a super cozy feel to it and super cute wall decors!  I've only been here for dinner and not brunch so that's what I will be talking about.  I came here with my boyfriend on a Saturday night around 9ish and there was no wait at all (very surprising since this spot is sooooo good but maybe because it's also located in a not so high traffic neighborhood).I must say the service was a bit slow.. there were only 3 waiters/waitresses but they don't seem the most attentive.  If you don't wave your hand to get something, they won't really come by and ask if you need anything.  Let me move onto the food we got...GF Burger - this burger is made with spicy roasted corn and pinto bean burger with chipotle mayo, lettuce, tomato, avocado, Brooklyn brine pickles served on house made GF bread with a salad.  I did not like this burger at all... it was so hard to eat!  The bread was easily breakable and everything just fell apart on my first bite.  The pinto bean burger was really dry and the sauce was way too spicy for my taste.  The salad was really good though but overall very disappointed in this burger.Mob Burger Deluxe - this is a crimini mushroom made with potato roll (or choice of whole wheat) secret sauce, Brooklyn brine pickles, charred onion, tomato, smoked eggplant and lettuce with seasoned potato wedge.  This was really good!  The mushroom was so juicy and all the ingredients just paired so well with each other!Sundae w/ key lime pie & vanilla ice cream - this was the bomb-diggity!!! It came in a chocolate shell, toasted hazelnuts and coconut lemon whipped cream!  This was probably the lightest ice cream I've ever ate and was simply DELICIOUSOur bill came out to be just under $42.00 - a bit on the expensive side but you are eating vegan food so it is worth it!Also wanted to mention the very first time we came here (January 2015), complimentary kale chips were served but this time around they don't have that anymore - what a pity cause that was really good!",4.0
"3,5 starsI was super excited to try this place! I love the idea of the communal tables and the easy going art gallery feel this place has and the garden is a plus.  A little on the hipster side but so what. This vegetarian/vegan restaurant gets points for creativity (grilled romaine), but lost some in terms of taste. While I didn't dislike the food and I thought the pancakes were decent, I think overall the food looked better than it tasted. PRO TIP:  give them a try for dinner maybe  because brunch was meh.",3.0
"My first time eating an American style vegetarian meal, and I had no regrets... Other than finishing every morsel on my plate. Between my companion and me, we ordered the mob burger deluxe and the cheeseburger deluxe with potato wedges on the side. We got the butternut squash soup to share. The flavoring of the butternut squash was delicious; slightly spicy with different herbs. The burgers were on point. I would recommend coming at least once to try the food out.",4.0
"The food here is simple, clean and not heavy, tasty in all, and the space open and with comfortable noise but not loud. I always have a good meal here, brunch, lunch, or late night munch after BAM.  Enjoy the communal table seating as well ...  staffs are always very knowledgable with food and friendly too.",4.0
"Delicious food served here.  I have been a few times over the years and always enjoyed my meal. Flatbread pizza is a winner, as is the seitan parm sandwich which is filling and comes with delicious and gigantic potato wedges. Great for large groups due to communal seating but also good for dates, who can sit across or next to you.",4.0
"MOB is a nice cozy vegan restaurant, love the seating arrangement which is communal. Servers were friendly. Had the gluten free burger which i regret ... should've ordered the mob burger in retrospect. Being that it is gluten free, the burger was on the dry side. Lemon cheesecake was OK.  I'll be back to the try the mac and cheese and their brunch!",4.0
"I used yelp to guide me. I came here expecting yuca fries. The nice employee said we dont do that here and it may have been a special. Browsed the yelp some more and saw that they serve kale chips in lieu of bread. Was kindly told we dont do that anymore and  that ppl who return for the chips are often disappointed when they are told its not there no mo.The food was good tho when i got it. Ordered flatbread pizza, potato wedges, and CARROT BACON. The carrot bacon didnt remond me of bacon though more like carrot flavored bbq chips. A little pricey but i would come back again!",3.0
"This place is great, love the simple yet industrial decor. The kale chips are so freaking good that my friend & I ordered extra. The food is definitely banging.  My favorite were the mac & cheese, yuca fries & burger; just simply delicious!",4.0
"M.O.B. is a vegan fast-casual restaurant near the Atlantic-Barclays stop in Brooklyn. They specialize in burgers and sandwiches that vegans and nonvegans can enjoy.I came here on a weekday for lunch. The decor here is interesting. You should check it out just for that! A few diners were eating when I arrived -- it's a good place to bring a computer and work since the tables are big. You'll have space to spread out your papers. Order in the back and your food comes out to you. I ordered the meatball sub and it was delicious.... the best vegan meatball sub I've had (but I've had only a few). I especially liked the sun-dried tomatoes infused in the meatballs. The meal was savory and substantial -- it filled me up more than a salad can, and I ran around town for hours before getting hungry again.They make all their burgers, patties, and meatballs in house -- so it's NOT the frozen Boca burger patties that other restaurants use and then mark up the price to $15. The menu changes, so make sure to try the specials since they might not be there next season. I could definitely take my meat-eating brother and father here when they are in town. I can't wait to come back and try more of their menu. Overall-- M.O.B has great selection, great service, and great flavors. You'll see me again there!",5.0

It feels like you've arrived at a friendly picnic table, even if you're not meeting anyone. Great place for groups or strollers, as there is plenty of space.The food is consistently great (I recommend the Mac & Cheese).I also like that they've invested in the neighborhood (it's not the most obvious place to put a vegan restaurant).",5.0
"I'm not a vegetarian or vegan, but I embrace plants, and was happy to try this. This was the first vegan restaurant I've tried that was so focused on burgers... it was actually surprising when I looked at the menu.The burger is FANTASTIC. While it doesn't taste or feel like meat, it has great texture and is not dry at all. It's bursting with flavor. However, the hot dog... not so much. My mom and I split the burger and the hot dog and there is a significant difference between the two and the burger was the winner by a mile.We got the potato wedges with it. Started with the Cauliflower appetizer, which also had a lot of flavor and was cooked to perfection.We were not offered the kale chips some others had mentioned. Service was OK... not fantastic, not horrible. But yeah, if I was in the neighborhood, I'd come back for that burger! :)",3.0

"I came to Brooklyn on business and found this spot through reviews on yelp for a good vegetarian spot. I've been veg for over 10 years so I was pumped to try it. I have the MOB burger and it was absolutely delicious. Probably the best veggie burger I've had, ever. Or at least in the top 3. The spot is cool too with communal tables and quirky lights ~ different music. The potato wedges were good but I kinda wish I had tried the salad instead. Price seemed high for a veggie burger but it was worth it.Only reason it's not 5 stars is because of service. I came at 5PM and no one else was there. I had never been here before and no one greeted me so I didn't know if I sat myself or what. I went to the back of the place where someone eventually came out, but overall service OK. I'd go back! I'd love to try to the mac and cheese or go for brunch.",4.0

"I made three trips here, once for brunch, once for dinner and once for take-out.  Servers and staff were friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. Comfortable, clean and interesting seating space both inside and out. Plaques of ""dead"" vegetables hanging on the wall ...Fun!Brunch-Blueberry pancakes, awesome!! Green smoothie with oat milk hold the lemon, very refreshing.  The tofu scramble portion size was very small and consisted of tiny sized pieces of tofu and shiitake mushroom. I think it could have used chunkier tofu and maybe chopping up some of those MOB dogs into the scramble (or as an option) would also be welcome and make it more enjoyable. I added the Carrot Bacon which sounded interesting. Texture was right, it looked like bacon bits but tasted mostly like liquid smoke ...not bad for carrots. Dinner-Salads were big fresh and reasonably priced. Sadly there was nothing that special about the Mac & Cheese or the Cheese-Dog deluxe to warrant their $18 & $17 price tags ...even if organic and home-made.  I expected my mind to be blown.  Both were enjoyable but not worth the price tag in my book.  Mac & Cheese as a side would be nice.My take-out order was ready on time even with a last minute item add-on.Pizza MOB was solid as were the desserts.Would love to see breakfast items offered daily.",4.0
"Disclaimer: I'm not a vegan, nor am I a vegetarian. If you are either of those, you should probably take my review with a grain of salt.I came here with one of my best friends who happens to be vegan. He's a big fan of M.O.B. as it's hard to find a quality vegan burger these days. He typically orders the Mob Burger Deluxe, which he loves and continues to rave about. I probably should have ordered that, but instead went for the Mob Dog Deluxe mostly out of curiosity and fascination with the ingredients list.The Mob Dog is made with spiced carrot, mushroom and chickpeas, and topped with mustard, ketchup, sauerkraut, and relish, all inside of a sweet potato roll. It sounded pretty good! I ordered it with a salad. The salad was nice; red and purple greens lightly dressed. The dog looked cool. The taste, however, yikes. The first couple bites reminded me of the outside breading of a corn dog. Not bad, necessarily, just odd. The texture was kind of mushy and bread-y. The further I got into it, the more I felt like I was eating cardboard. The bun was way too thick for the dog. I got sick of it about 2/3 in and couldn't finish it. Another disclaimer: I like real hot dogs. I'm slightly ashamed to admit it since God only knows what goes into a typical hot dog link. However, I've grown to love that flavor and texture and don't appreciate mushy cardboard-y versions (even though the ingredients of the Mob Dog were surely healthier!).The decor is weird, but I dug it. The service was slow. There were only 3 small parties when I came, yet we had to wait 10 minutes for them to pick my credit card up after dropping the bill. If my friend takes me to M.O.B. again, I'm having the burger.",3.0

Everyone's food came before mine including the 2 people from our group who arrived late and ordered after me. Several people in my group had the same dish as me, and I raised my hand when the server called it out to serve, but she didn't notice me I guess or forgot what I ordered. They didn't use any system to keep track of who ordered what. Not that it would have mattered if they had made all the dishes. Anyways, I finally asked her where my food was, and she apologized and said it'd be out asap.Food was fine when it came. I'm not a vegetarian so I'm not the best critic, but it was decent enough. But I only had 10 minutes to eat it.And when I had to leave after my 10 minutes of inhaling my food, the server was nowhere to be found. I walked back into the server area myself to ask for a box and asked her to take my meal off the check. She said she'd talk to the manager, and I let her know I'd be happy to talk to the manager as well. The server then informs me that the manager won't comp the meal but would happily give me a dessert on the house. I reminded the server that the whole issue was that I had to leave early and didn't have time for more food. Finally I gave in to some cake to go. Ughhhhhhhhh.

"This is our third visit in four years, and it has been slowly getting more disappointing.  The garden feels more neglected than ever.  The interior is feeling less like a restaurant and more like a rumpus room.But, the food...Don't know if they stopped the kale chip amuse bouche, but it would've been nice.First, the main course menu has been pared down to a few burgers, a few hot dogs, and a mac and cheese.  The star -- the burger -- was unavailable.  I ordered the GF burger with potato fries.  What I got was the driest, crumbliest veggie burger ever.  Bland and dry.  I ate it with a fork until I was sick of eating it.  It came on a ""bun"" which was truthfully the dryness, the texture, and the *weight* of MDF board.  Seriously.  I'm astonished because these people are supposed to be vegan experts, and when your menu is all burgers and dogs, you better be a maestro at them.Potato wedges were crispy outside, but again, dry inside.Also ordered was the mac and cheese, with its chew cream.  Also extremely dry.  Pasta was way overcooked and floppy.Appetizer of gazpacho was nice, but please leave the pink peppercorns off of it -- they have a strong flavor that seriously does not work with cucumber gazpacho.Staff is nice and welcoming.The place is expensive for what you get, even if the food was.. edible.. which it mainly was not.",2.0

We clean our plates and feel nourished and refreshed but not really full. I definitely feel lighter in my wallet! I guess I'm okay with having to pay more for a relaxing experience with so many great options and no need to negotiate substitutions. So far the service has been fine, no complaints. I'm not thrilled with the communal dining at the long tables indoors but I love the peaceful backyard and its smaller tables.

"This is our third visit in four years, and it has been slowly getting more disappointing.  The garden feels more neglected than ever.  The interior is feeling less like a restaurant and more like a rumpus room.But, the food...Don't know if they stopped the kale chip amuse bouche, but it would've been nice.First, the main course menu has been pared down to a few burgers, a few hot dogs, and a mac and cheese.  The star -- the burger -- was unavailable.  I ordered the GF burger with potato fries.  What I got was the driest, crumbliest veggie burger ever.  Bland and dry.  I ate it with a fork until I was sick of eating it.  It came on a ""bun"" which was truthfully the dryness, the texture, and the *weight* of MDF board.  Seriously.  I'm astonished because these people are supposed to be vegan experts, and when your menu is all burgers and dogs, you better be a maestro at them.Potato wedges were crispy outside, but again, dry inside.Also ordered was the mac and cheese, with its chew cream.  Also extremely dry.  Pasta was way overcooked and floppy.Appetizer of gazpacho was nice, but please leave the pink peppercorns off of it -- they have a strong flavor that seriously does not work with cucumber gazpacho.Staff is nice and welcoming.The place is expensive for what you get, even if the food was.. edible.. which it mainly was not.",2.0
"I appreciate M.O.B. because everything on the menu is vegan. So many choices! No need for questioning! I like the ""buttermilk"" biscuit sandwich (seitan sausage, smoked eggplant, avocado, aioli, tomato on a flaky roll, with house salad) and my friend likes the burger. The portions are small. We clean our plates and feel nourished and refreshed but not really full. I definitely feel lighter in my wallet! I guess I'm okay with having to pay more for a relaxing experience with so many great options and no need to negotiate substitutions. So far the service has been fine, no complaints. I'm not thrilled with the communal dining at the long tables indoors but I love the peaceful backyard and its smaller tables. It's nice having M.O.B. to eat at during the Atlantic Antic, since the only thing I saw there that I would eat was roasted corn.",4.0
"Really fun vegan place.Pros:+ Comfort food, but great variety of healthy and indulgent options.+ You know how some restaurants bring you a basket of bread? Well M.O.B. said + Outdoor patio is a gorgeous space. I was here on the hottest of days, yet the massive trees kept me shaded, and I couldn't believe how cool and comfortable I was.+ Salads are the perfect size for a meal and are very creative. Instead of being ""indulgent"" salads with chunks of fake meat, they are a bowl of unique fruits and veggies and flavors. A lot of thought went into them, and I really appreciate them. I had the Granada Salad and it was unlike any salad I've ever had. Great flavor, and my body felt excellent when I finished.+ Mac and cheese is pretty darn delicious (a friend ordered it and I tried a few bites). They claim it is ""the best they've ever had,"" but I'll admit that I've had better. I'm partial to my own homemade recipe, so maybe it's hard for me to try others. But they top it with beautifully seasoned veggies, including bright green broccoli. That part looked more appealing to me than the mac, but that's just me being me.+ The inside space is cool as well. It's not really my style, but I can appreciate the ""fun"" of it. It's different: instead of a bunch of small tables, it has four or so looooong tables. Think ""great hall"" from Hogwarts, except with lots of bright reds and yellows and blues.+ Our waitress was THE. SWEETEST.Cons:- I wish the mac and cheese was available as a side. It is only available as an entree, and is one of the most expensive items on the menu ($18). It's massive, and nobody in our group who ordered it could finish it (not even close). I would love to see a small (side) bowl of it available for $5 or so. I bet it'd be a big seller because people would eat it as a side in addition to an entree. In fact, a small bowl of mac would have gone so well with my salad!- As beautiful as the patio space is, you can see into the kitchen. Normally, I love this, but our view was not ideal. From where we sat, we just saw all the massive containers of all their spices and condiments, and it was just not endearing. It's not like we saw anything gross or scandalous, but it was just very industrial. In the midst of our enchanting patio space, we had the side-view of what felt like the ""closet"" of the kitchen. - Be aware that brunch items (particularly the scramble) frequently run out on the weekends. I'm going to be optimistic and think that they are following a ""We don't want to waste food so we'll just serve this until it runs out and then OH WELL"" philosophy. Because food shouldn't be wasted, so I appreciate that. Regardless, if you want the scramble, be there early.The menu here seems to be so good.

"I had my first experience dining here at MOB this week. I came for a late lunch/early dinner.

She told me about a free burger opportunity which was very exciting! Now to the part that matters. I got the MOB deluxe burger. It was amazing! The secret sauce... Mmm. I added the pepper jack cashew chesse which is made in house. Next time I would leave off the eggplant. It was a bit rubbery and chewy. The burger came with A side of potato wedges, which I wish were a bit more crispy. The ketchup and bread are not house made ( I understand the bread, but seriously learn to make your own damn ketchup!!!!) I also had the purple smoothie, it was perfect!

I will concede that the portions aren't huge - we had planned to split an iron mob and a salad, but we ended up ordering one additional iron mob to fill the proverbial gaps.  The space itself is fairly cool - four communal tables, and a patio (though it was raining today so not possible to enjoy the outdoor space) - and the restaurateurs play cool music a la Iron & Wine. The only downside is something about the acoustics in the space make it hard to hear - we were there on a quiet, rainy Tuesday evening, and the restaurant was about 1/4 full, and it still felt like we had to shout to hear each other.",4.0

Have been going here since it first opened but today's rude service (or lack thereof) by someone named Fadoua was unreal. My spouse and I walked in sat and waited. There was one other person in the restaurant at 3:30pm. Initially we weren't sure they were open though the kitchen staff was in the back. I looked and saw Fadoua was arguing on her cell phone. Later she came and threw down the menus not saying hi back to us- not even saying a word. We waited another 15 minutes after we decided what we wanted to order and finally I went to the cash register and asked her if there was table service. She had me order at the counter and messed up our order. Wow! Seriously. I've never had such rudeness in a restaurant. I had been going to M.O.B over the summer and don't remember her. I don't know if she's new but the fact that they have a server who could even act that way means I won't be returning and will tell people to go to Sun in Bloom where the staff is much much nicer and attentive. And the food is better. Perhaps that's because we couldn't enjoy our meal since most of it was spent discussing how unreal this woman was and how we should walk out. I regret we didn't walk out. We won't be back.,1.0
"I love the atmosphere of this place. The plaques of dead vegetables that died for noble, delicious causes was cute, as was all the other artwork on the walls. Seating is at large communal tables, also nice. About the food. I went here once for dinner and it was soo good! However because of how pricey this place is, I can only speak to one dish. And that may well be the only thing I have here. $18 for mac & cheese, what! With tax and tip, it was a $23 meal for one, though admittedly the portion was big and I took home leftovers. It was my first time seeing vegan mac and cheese so I splurged. Honestly the smoked pecans on top tasted way too much like real bacon for me, but maybe that's just me.

Truth be told, I wasn't that excited when I saw the menu - it's fairly limited, especially for dinner.  But everything we sampled, particularly the iron mob (essentially a flatbread pizza served with kale, shitakes, and a very non-horseradishy horseradish aioli) and the kale salad (served with quinoa, roasted chickpeas, and green apples) was truly excellent. I will concede that the portions aren't huge - we had planned to split an iron mob and a salad, but we ended up ordering one additional iron mob to fill the proverbial gaps.  The space itself is fairly cool - four communal tables, and a patio (though it was raining today so not possible to enjoy the outdoor space) - and the restaurateurs play cool music a la Iron & Wine. The only downside is something about the acoustics in the space make it hard to hear - we were there on a quiet, rainy Tuesday evening, and the restaurant was about 1/4 full, and it still felt like we had to shout to hear each other.",4.0
Very good food! All 100% vegan! I will be back and will recommend this place to everyone!,5.0
"I came here for brunch on a Saturday just past noon and the place was empty, so I was a little skeptical. However, the food was quite good. They have a decent selection and the whole menu is vegan. It is a little on the pricey side, but many items and homemade. I had a shiitake and corn tofu scramble that was pretty regular, but also a sweet potato and kale hash which helped to amp up the flavor and homemade flatbread in addition. I definitely want to check this place out for lunch or dinner.",4.0
Have been going here since it first opened but today's rude service (or lack thereof) by someone named Fadoua was unreal. My spouse and I walked in sat and waited. There was one other person in the restaurant at 3:30pm. Initially we weren't sure they were open though the kitchen staff was in the back. I looked and saw Fadoua was arguing on her cell phone. Later she came and threw down the menus not saying hi back to us- not even saying a word. We waited another 15 minutes after we decided what we wanted to order and finally I went to the cash register and asked her if there was table service. She had me order at the counter and messed up our order. Wow! Seriously. I've never had such rudeness in a restaurant. I had been going to M.O.B over the summer and don't remember her. I don't know if she's new but the fact that they have a server who could even act that way means I won't be returning and will tell people to go to Sun in Bloom where the staff is much much nicer and attentive. And the food is better. Perhaps that's because we couldn't enjoy our meal since most of it was spent discussing how unreal this woman was and how we should walk out. I regret we didn't walk out. We won't be back.,1.0
"I love the atmosphere of this place. The plaques of dead vegetables that died for noble, delicious causes was cute, as was all the other artwork on the walls. Seating is at large communal tables, also nice. About the food. I went here once for dinner and it was soo good! However because of how pricey this place is, I can only speak to one dish. And that may well be the only thing I have here. $18 for mac & cheese, what! With tax and tip, it was a $23 meal for one, though admittedly the portion was big and I took home leftovers. It was my first time seeing vegan mac and cheese so I splurged. Honestly the smoked pecans on top tasted way too much like real bacon for me, but maybe that's just me. As a whole, the mac and cheese was super creamy and delicious. Eat with hot sauce!",4.0

"This place is all over the map. The first time I dined here the veggie burger was great, one of the best I have had in NYC, but still some room for improvement. Other times, the veggie burger has been mushy, small, tasteless. I hope you guys get it together, it's definitely not worth $18 a veggie burger at this point.

"The food here is fucking great. Fresh and tasty. I've tried almost everything on the menu. Here are a few stand-outs that I think are worth trying:1. Mob Burger Deluxe on a wheat bun, w/ ""cheddar"" cashew cheese and potato wedges. EXCELLENT! *side note*:For optimal potato wedges, ask for them to me extra crispy.2. On the lunch menu before 5pm, the California Burger. Slightly different from the Mob Burger Deluxe, but equally flavorful. Has avocado slices if you like avocados. Also pairs well w/ extra crispy potato wedges. 3. Blueberry Pancakes: Super fluffy and tasty! 4. Buttermilk Biscuit Sandwich: Fucking amazing. As satisfying as eating a sausage biscuit. Although Portion can be considered small for some, I think it's a decent size. If you are starving during brunch hours, I recommend ordering this + share the Blueberry Pancakes as a desert after. You won't be disappointed. 5. Mac n' Cheese: For a dish that is dairy-free, it mimics the creamy texture of a classic Mac n' Cheese quite well. The potion size is good and the flavor is adequate and satisfying. 6. Pizza Mob: Very delicious! You won't have the same 'filled' feeling as if you would eat a classic large NY pizza slice, but hey, you're at a vegan joint, so you can't expect a pizza's-pizza. Nonetheless it a great spin on a healthy pizza and tastes really good. 7. MOB Dog: *disclaimer* This one is an acquired taste! First time I tried this I didn't like it. I gave it a chance though. After the second time, I didn't mind it and would order it agin if in the mood. If you are a first-timer at this place, I do not recommend ordering this meal as your first meal here. You will likely be disappointed, especially if you are use to real hot dogs.",5.0

We got the roasted cauliflower to start which was great and not too oily. I ordered the GF Burger (w/ salad), which was a perfectly seasoned, handmade vegan burger (+1 for Brooklyn Brine!). The extra order of the carrot bacon on top was a true treat. So smokey and delicious! My boyfriend, a wheat-eating carnivore got the same and was throughly impressed. The coconut tapioca pudding at the end was super light and not too sweet. Crowd pleaser.",5.0

"Another great lettuce-head spot, with a decidedly humble vibe - none of that holier than thou vegan 'tude... ""But what *percentage* raw are you??"" First off, the seating is awesome: long tables that you share with everyone. Yall will also share a giant shaker of sea salt, which forces you to smile and be courteous with your neighbors. Everyone gets complimentary kale chips, which are fresh, delicate and full-flavored. They were very crumbly, as kale tends to get when placed in a dehydrator.I was leaning toward the boring Margherita MOB, until the server admitted that the Iron Man was actually his favorite (after I asked, of course). I made the excellent decision of listening to him and added the gluten free crust. This would have been plenty - and at $11, a total steal - but I got fries too (next time, I'd skip the fries and save room for dessert). The best part was that the MOB arrived in a shiny silver plate cheesily shaped like the Brooklyn Bridge. I just about lost it. On a kitschy vs. adorable graph, it would be in quadrant I (super kitsch, super adorbs). Note to gluten-h8rs: None of the items under the Entree section are G-free, so stick to a salad or MOB (you must specifically ask for the gluten-free flatbread). On that note, I'd love for them to have a more extensive food menu (there are 2 MOBs, 3 entrees and a handful of Sides to choose from, and that's it.) and The food also took more than 40 minutes to come out. And the fries were just a tad too oily. Overall however, I'd come back, and for those of you who live or work in the area, I'd imagine it a fantastic lunch spot.",4.0

Lastly, we got the MOB burger-- probably one of the tastiest vegan burgers I've had. I'd definitely recommend it and I'd like to go back for brunch!",5.0
"I'll confess I was unimpressed the first time I visited M.O.B. I don't even recall what I had but it just wasn't amazing. Not bad! Just not memorable. So, it was some time before I ventured back, this time on a lunch date with a friend. My experience could not have been more different. The burger might be one of the best, if not the best, veggie burger I have ever had. Unbelievably delicious! The burger turned around what probably was a ""to return or not to return"" visit from a ""not likely"" to a ""how soon can I go back.""",4.0
This place is amazing. Nothing like a bottle of wine and vegan macaroni and cheese. The Brooklyn bridge arch shaped M.O.B. pies are amazing and the design and family style seating was really neat. Very clean environment and super fresh food with a very artistic twist make this one of my favorite places. Definitely worth the one hour ride and detour through the hood.,4.0
Nothing is bad about this place but I find everything underwhelming. Especially for the price. It's way too expensive for what it is.,3.0
"Came to dinner here before a show at BAM. The ambiance is great. Good vibe throughout. Clean bathrooms. Interesting wall art.The wait staff was attentive and kind. I ordered the dog. It was tasty. The crispy fries were delicious but the ketchup you dip them in was SO FABULOUS it made the fries even better. I literally couldn't get enough. I ran out before the fries were consumed.We ordered dessert. The brownie sundae with raspberry coulis is delicious. The raspberry was so fresh and tart. Awesome. Serves with a coconut based vanilla ice cream. I wanted to lick my plate.I didn't give 5 stars because I think $15 was too much for the dog. I recommend this restaurant though. And, it seems kid-friendly, as there was mats on the corner and toys and such.",4.0
"Another great lettuce-head spot, with a decidedly humble vibe - none of that holier than thou vegan 'tude... ""But what *percentage* raw are you??"" First off, the seating is awesome: long tables that you share with everyone. Yall will also share a giant shaker of sea salt, which forces you to smile and be courteous with your neighbors. Everyone gets complimentary kale chips, which are fresh, delicate and full-flavored. They were very crumbly, as kale tends to get when placed in a dehydrator.I was leaning toward the boring Margherita MOB, until the server admitted that the Iron Man was actually his favorite (after I asked, of course). I made the excellent decision of listening to him and added the gluten free crust. This would have been plenty - and at $11, a total steal - but I got fries too (next time, I'd skip the fries and save room for dessert). The best part was that the MOB arrived in a shiny silver plate cheesily shaped like the Brooklyn Bridge. I just about lost it. On a kitschy vs. adorable graph, it would be in quadrant I (super kitsch, super adorbs). Note to gluten-h8rs: None of the items under the Entree section are G-free, so stick to a salad or MOB (you must specifically ask for the gluten-free flatbread). On that note, I'd love for them to have a more extensive food menu (there are 2 MOBs, 3 entrees and a handful of Sides to choose from, and that's it.) and The food also took more than 40 minutes to come out. And the fries were just a tad too oily. Overall however, I'd come back, and for those of you who live or work in the area, I'd imagine it a fantastic lunch spot.",4.0
"MOB is such a wonderful place! I swear my energy changes every time I walk through the door. The ambiance is very clean and zen. The staff is always sweet and extremely informative about the menu. I've had the chance to eat brunch and dinner here and both were delicious (the blueberry pancakes are what dreams are made of.) The menu can look a bit pricey at first glance; however, the quality of food is outstanding and well worth it! In the warm weather, check out the adorable patio out back. Definitely a must try for all :)",5.0

"This place is a gem. The food was fabulous!! I had the mushroom burger and my husband had the mac n cheese. Both plates were Oh!! Sooo Gooood. They do change up the menu for the season. I like when restaurants do that because it keeps me interested and wanting to come back to find out what new vegan dish they have concocted. I gave a rating of a 4 because the service was not on point and I almost gave it a 3. Let me explain why. We came with a group of 13 which they were able to accommodate as far as seating us all together. However, the food was not all served at once. By the time the last person received their dish, the first person was already done. Yikes! I don't think that was the waitress' fault but it is not a good reflection on what's going on in the kitchen. We were disappointed because we came in to celebrate a birthday and by the time half of us were ready for dessert, the other half was still eating. We were going to wait for the rest of the group to get their food but we figured that would cause more chaos... and good thing we didn't wait. Our food would have definitely gotten cold by the time the last dish came out... and if we asked the waiter to heat up our food... it would have been a mess in the kitchen. So we decided to eat but it was the most pleasant experience having hungry folks watch you eat and then having those folks feel rushed once they got their food.....",4.0
"How do you know when your a fat ass? Maybe it's when you ""pre-gamed"" for food instead of alcohol and drag your boyfriend along; our pre-game was 2 Jamaican patties and ice cream. Or maybe it's when you tell the waiter your order and you get a look and a comment that it's a lot of food. Sorry I can't help but to try everything! And this is why I need to suffer through jogging for an hour or at least attempt to. Hey, you know the saying, it's the thought that counts right?  Free kale chips. Say what? Say what? This can't be true. The price of kale chips rapes my wallet! The moment our waitress set down the plate of kale chips, it was gone. That's how you devour free food asian style..... then you ask for free refills. Haha. Sorry mom, I decided to save space for the real deal so I didn't ask for refills. We started off with the hot creamy corn soup with popcorn. Who needs oyster crackers with soup when you could have popcorn! Whole grain and less calories. What more can you ask for? Maybe a little bit fresher? The popcorn tasted kind of stale but it was still satisfying. Entrees: Mob's Iron Man and Margherita flatbread -  I prefer the flatbread to be flatter but the toppings made up for it. I eventually just ate the toppings and ditched the flatbread. Mob Dog deluxe with all the fillings  and a side of potato wedges - Amazing presentation. It was a healthy hearty dog with a hint of spice. Mac and cheese - I found you! My sister ordered this for me once and I forgot where it was from so when I saw it, I was flying with the birds and eventually hit a pole for not paying attention. This dish inspired me to make mac and cheese with mushrooms and pecans. Which btw, gave me the title of the best mac and cheese maker. Dessert (That's right, I ordered all the desserts they had. Bring on the stares!):Chocolate and Hazelnut Torte - Hazelnut and chocolate has got to be the best combo. I never had nutella before but I think this is the vegan version of nutella. Plus coconut whip cream! Lemon Cheesecake - I think I'm over the lemon cheesecake phase. It wasn't bad, but I think I moved onto Key Lime. It came with blueberries on the side and 3 rounds of addicting coconut whip cream. Mob's chocolate sundae - One scoop of ice cream, with hardened chocolate, crushed nuts on the bottom and here it comes, whip cream! Now I'm usually not a fan of whip cream, but this was a whole new level! It wasn't sweet but instead tasted so natural. Mob's Brownie - Hm, not my type of brownie. I was hoping for a warm fresh brownie topped with a scoop of cold ice cream melting. It was a great size and presentation but I'm picking when it comes to brownies. It was on the side of too much flour. So why four stars? Ambience, service, mac and cheese.",4.0
"Vegetarian/vegan but on the filling side - MOB was both delicious and adventurous. I had the Gardensnake Gazpacho, which I could eat by the pail, the MOB Burger, which was so rich and savory and perfect, and the Chocolate Hazelnut Tart, which put me on the floor. Certainly the most interesting thing I had was the Beet Wine - I don't usually love beet things (too earthy - like eating dirt), but I went for it and was not disappointed; the sweet and tanginess of it overpowered the earthiness; it was like drinking a delicious perfume. Staff was great as well, though I came at 5:30 on a Tuesday.",5.0
"While visiting a vegan friend in NYC, we ended up spending a weekday in Brooklyn in the rain. In fact, most of that trip involved rain.

Instead, I got the burger.Now my big mistake here was, I think the night before, when I arrived in Brooklyn, I took this friend out for dinner at a pub near her apartment, where I decided to celebrate my lil vacation with a beer, a bacon cheeseburger, and some fries. I don't usually eat meat, and rarely go for the red meat-meat candy (aka bacon)-cheese trifecta, but hey, when in rome. Who orders a salad at a pub?

Kale chips: yum! Crunchy & the right way to start the meal. Mac-n-cheese: awesome! Creamy, indulgent, and filling. You just can't stop eating it... And certainly wouldn't want sharing it. Do trust. Burger: tasty! Delicious mushroom. Like you sure there's no meat here? Hmmm. Every part seems well thought out. At first glance it seems a bit too small but still great tasting. Quinoa salad:: refreshing, chilled, healthy deliciousness!! Chunks of avocado, perfectly cooked quinoa, & some other veggies I can't remember right now but you should know it rocked. And top it all off with a spritz of lime juice- ta da! Wine & beer available to enjoy with your vegan meal... Overpriced for sure but for the best vegan you'll have? Live a little & splurge on this meal. Perfect date night.",5.0
Here from out if town and fell in love with this place. Wish we had this in Dallas! The atmosphere is chill and laid back. Very different from the normal New York life.

"The veggie burger here isn't just a hamburger manqué -- it is its own magical thing that takes the idea to a while new level. Love the MOB flatbreads too, and the salads.I'm sad to see that the dinner menu has been curtailed recently; brunch is your best bet for variety. Everything on offer then is pretty great.Super-friendly service, and convenient for pre/post show dining from BAM or Barclays. One complaint is that some non-alcoholic drinks that sound house-made are in fact just bottled Argo teas, which is a bit of a bummer.",4.0
"As soon as I sat down, I was served the most unique free appetizer - crispy kale chips (I think it was kale) and a cool blue bottle of water. What better way to start: great intriguing appetizer and a gorgeous looking bottle.I am not a nitpick judge on Top Chef. I value a restaurant's interior design more than its food. That said, from someone uninterested in food, I must admit that the burger here is one of the best ones I've ever tasted.It was levels higher than Five Guys and a few notches higher than those I've eaten at hotels. It was really good. Don't expect a huge sized burger. The size was just right and more than enough to fill you up. It comes with a choice of side salad or fries. I of course chose the fries (potato wedges) which were awesome. I am used to crispy fries. These ones were softer and more roasted but still very good.Plating was decent. Clean, modern but not that impressive or avant garde. But, I think their vibe is more casual and rustic.Coffee was in a vessel that you press down. It was cool to look at but still tasted average. It wasn't bad. I just expected it to be extra magical because of the magical ritual involving the pressing-the-coffee-down bottle. At least I got the option of almond milk on the side.As a design snob, I pay notice to even the small sources of beauty. You can see the design intent all over the place. The mismatched chairs. The equally mismatched but equally gorgeous row ofceiling lamps. Are mismatched things the new gorgeous trend? Exposed bricks. One yellow wall. Weird but engaging wall art. The long farm-like tables. It somehow all works together. That's the magic of Brooklyn's DIY aesthetic. Service was pleasant, constant checking in if everything is going well without sounding fake or being too obtrusive.

"""I think I wanna go to that spot on Atlantic Ave., the vegetarian one where - ""My wife's head exploded before I could finish that sentence.Her combustion was for a noble cause, of course, defending my unwaveringly carnivorous ways. In fact, Maimonide Of Brooklyn supports its own form of martyrdom, as well, it would seem. No, not for the same cause as my own, as you will surely find no meat on the menu here. But to commemorate various befallen friends (in this case, fruits and vegetables), mounted like deer heads along one wall - ""Mr. Avocado, 2009-2010, died for guacamole,"" ""Miss Banana, June 2008-August 2008, died for banana bread"" - you get the idea. But before we go any further, let's resurrect the wife in this sensationalized account, so that I don't end up sleeping on the couch tonight.And she's back.Now. Why would it appear that I, a self-professed meat-eater extraordinaire, am pouring on the praise for a place that praises produce over processed animal entrails? It's no riddle, my friends. Even as a rabid devourer of protein-and-fat, I simply, sincerely enjoy the food at Maimonide, in all its earthy goodness.What helps is their vegetarian dishes' ability to prove themselves as supremely hearty, and not only healthy, alternatives for all my fellow meat-eaters out there. Take the Belly Charmer MOB, for example. Essentially a robust flatbread of sorts, in the shape of one of the Brooklyn Bridge's signature arches (or maybe just a boat to anyone choosing to ignore iconic architecture), this veggie vessel's cargo includes eggplant, pistachios, harissa, zucchini, mint, carrots, and about a dozen other items I don't treat my body to often enough. These ingredients are not only substantial picks, but the crust of this MOB is thick, wholesome, and delicious.Maimonide is also a bit of a brunch underdog. It flies far enough under the radar on the weekend that there's not much of a crowd - even though there most definitely should be. The Buttermilk Biscuit Sandwich is a fine choice (although I can't defend its ""sandwich"" status given it crumbles into pieces of eggplant, avocado, tomato, and carbs pretty much upon first grab), but the real winner is the Spicy Yellow Grits. Of course, this was what the wife ordered, so I was reduced to stealing bits of garlic sauteed kale and Japanese sweet potato ""sausage links"" from her bowl when she wasn't looking.Creative vegetarian cuisine aside, Maimonide Of Brooklyn reaches interior design nirvana. It's jam-packed with Kings County pride and Americana punk sensibility. Those same arches found shaping your tasty MOB are the same ones carved out as doorways between the dining area and the back bar / kitchen, again paying homage to the most famous of East River crossings. The wall opposite the aforementioned hunting trophies is a giant, re-imagined star-spangled banner, seating is comprised of four, giant communal tables, plus an arcade table (Pac-Man and Spade Invaders are free of charge!), the music ranges from jazz to indie rock to hip-hop, there's an origin-story-style comic book about the establishment for your reading pleasure, and there's even back patio outdoor seating for the warmer months.To all my carnivore comrades, while I know my enthusiasm here may be overwhelming, do not fear for me. I still almost always order the burger if I see it on a menu. Veal is still in my diet, even after seeing that South Park episode years ago where the boys discover it comes from baby cows. And bacon, well - my love for bacon isn't going anywhere. Call me an animal. No pun intended.But Maimonide of Brooklyn may very well be the first (and right now, only) vegetarian spot that's had me under its spell, to the point where I've actually craved it. It's conflicting and confusing to admit this, and trust me, typing it all out doesn't make it any more logical to me either. But just try to resist its casual-cool demeanor and veggie goodness.

So while I was waiting 8 years for my check (and long had run out of water to drink to entertain myself), he walked right by me and stood there for some time, screwing around picking a song, then he was going to walk away and still didn't even look at me, so I said, excuse me, can I have my check? Then when he came back to give it to me he had a much less friendly look on his face, like, oh, you're one of *those* customers. Yes, I'm one of ""those"" annoying customers who prefers not to spend an entire hour having a veggie burger and water in a restaurant by myself on a freezing cold-ass night that was just getting more and more freezing the later it got as you ignored me to anally retentively fuck with the music.

"This was my first time trying a vegan restaurant. My friend and I wanted to try the hot dog and the M.O.B deluxe burger.  Thank god we shared it because the hot dog was atrocious.  I am not quite sure if it was wasabi and mustard but it was too pungent.  However, the M.O.B deluxe burger was exceptional so I advise not to get the hot dog unless you like that strong taste of wasabi and mustard.",3.0
"""I think I wanna go to that spot on Atlantic Ave., the vegetarian one where - ""My wife's head exploded before I could finish that sentence.Her combustion was for a noble cause, of course, defending my unwaveringly carnivorous ways. In fact, Maimonide Of Brooklyn supports its own form of martyrdom, as well, it would seem. No, not for the same cause as my own, as you will surely find no meat on the menu here. But to commemorate various befallen friends (in this case, fruits and vegetables), mounted like deer heads along one wall - ""Mr. Avocado, 2009-2010, died for guacamole,"" ""Miss Banana, June 2008-August 2008, died for banana bread"" - you get the idea. But before we go any further, let's resurrect the wife in this sensationalized account, so that I don't end up sleeping on the couch tonight.And she's back.Now. Why would it appear that I, a self-professed meat-eater extraordinaire, am pouring on the praise for a place that praises produce over processed animal entrails? It's no riddle, my friends. Even as a rabid devourer of protein-and-fat, I simply, sincerely enjoy the food at Maimonide, in all its earthy goodness.What helps is their vegetarian dishes' ability to prove themselves as supremely hearty, and not only healthy, alternatives for all my fellow meat-eaters out there. Take the Belly Charmer MOB, for example. Essentially a robust flatbread of sorts, in the shape of one of the Brooklyn Bridge's signature arches (or maybe just a boat to anyone choosing to ignore iconic architecture), this veggie vessel's cargo includes eggplant, pistachios, harissa, zucchini, mint, carrots, and about a dozen other items I don't treat my body to often enough. These ingredients are not only substantial picks, but the crust of this MOB is thick, wholesome, and delicious.Maimonide is also a bit of a brunch underdog. It flies far enough under the radar on the weekend that there's not much of a crowd - even though there most definitely should be. The Buttermilk Biscuit Sandwich is a fine choice (although I can't defend its ""sandwich"" status given it crumbles into pieces of eggplant, avocado, tomato, and carbs pretty much upon first grab), but the real winner is the Spicy Yellow Grits. Of course, this was what the wife ordered, so I was reduced to stealing bits of garlic sauteed kale and Japanese sweet potato ""sausage links"" from her bowl when she wasn't looking.Creative vegetarian cuisine aside, Maimonide Of Brooklyn reaches interior design nirvana. It's jam-packed with Kings County pride and Americana punk sensibility. Those same arches found shaping your tasty MOB are the same ones carved out as doorways between the dining area and the back bar / kitchen, again paying homage to the most famous of East River crossings. The wall opposite the aforementioned hunting trophies is a giant, re-imagined star-spangled banner, seating is comprised of four, giant communal tables, plus an arcade table (Pac-Man and Spade Invaders are free of charge!), the music ranges from jazz to indie rock to hip-hop, there's an origin-story-style comic book about the establishment for your reading pleasure, and there's even back patio outdoor seating for the warmer months.To all my carnivore comrades, while I know my enthusiasm here may be overwhelming, do not fear for me. I still almost always order the burger if I see it on a menu. Veal is still in my diet, even after seeing that South Park episode years ago where the boys discover it comes from baby cows. And bacon, well - my love for bacon isn't going anywhere. Call me an animal. No pun intended.But Maimonide of Brooklyn may very well be the first (and right now, only) vegetarian spot that's had me under its spell, to the point where I've actually craved it. It's conflicting and confusing to admit this, and trust me, typing it all out doesn't make it any more logical to me either. But just try to resist its casual-cool demeanor and veggie goodness.

"Really great spot. Loved the open space, loved the fact that they have wifi and are cool with people working there for extended periods of time. And the food is wonderful!My only disappointment? I had scoped the website and wanted to try the Saucisson - a ""Dry cured fennel and sage saucisson of sundried tomato, porcini mushroom and sunflower seed on whole grain sourdough toast with aioli, and pickled radishes."" But the item is no longer on the menu and they need to revamp the site. So I went with the oyster mushroom and chick pea ""nuggets"" with mustard instead, which were a good, hearty choice.So then I really REALLY wanted to do a half and half on the MOB, which wasn't possible. I was bummed since I don't live in the area, but powered through it ;) I ended up with the Bright Eyes, which was a good choice, but I found myself looking around at everyone else's meal longingly too. Yeah, I'm a fat kid. Don't judge.Here's the description of Bright Eyes from the menu: ""House made cashew yogurt, peperonata,a sweet and lightly acidic (from white wine vinegar) stew of sweet peppers and onions. Next the mob is topped with fresh seasonal fava beans and crimini mushrooms roasted in garlic. The final garnish on this mob is a touch of spicy and fresh tasting watercress.""",4.0

The waiter suggested the Chamomile/Honey Wine to my buzz-seeking group. It was completely refreshing and my little party of three easily finished the generous carafe. The service all around was stellar, and the outside garden was cute and lively.I really can't say enough good things about it, and I will most certainly be back. What a find!",5.0
"Came here last night with a group of people I wouldn't necessarily define as vegetarians. In fact, we probably would be the opposite.

We all ordered dessert after and continued to keep the drinks flowing. The cheesecake and the brownie were really tasty.In addition to the great setting out back and delicious food our server was fantastic.

"Coming to a place named/nicknamed MOB, what drew me on the menu was to get a MOB. So, I got what was called a Belly Charmer which consists of Tagine of eggplant, zucchini, and carrot, moroccan spices, pistachio, mint and cilantro on pita-like bread. i really want to like this place, I really do. I like the idea but the MOB was not terribly impressive. It kind of had the look and taste of a pizza, but not as tasty. The particular MOB I got had pistachios on it which was a little weird, but I can't decide whether I hate or love the bites that included a pistachio. Overall, a bit bland. Points for their outdoor garden seating and complimentary kale chips (they were superb but the stems could have been removed, they were a little chewy compared to the lightness of the kale chips).I would come back to try their burger, but for a place named MOB, I would have expected a little more from their signature named dishes.",3.0
"This place is a vegetarian's idea of a wet dream. I saw this place after one of my runs and was curious about it, but wasn't sure if it was Kosher or what. Luckily, a friend of mine clued me in. He also told me about a comic book that talks about this place. It is an awesome colouring book. I mean seriously, if you eat veggies, it gives you superpowers! We came here on a Saturday night near 10pm and there were still a few people eating. Most of the seats are communal. So if you have social anxiety, you might want to skip this place. I personally love breaking bread with others. Food is bonding. The waitress came by quickly, brought us water and kale chips drizzled with olive oil as snacks. Yummy! The main thing they have here are MOBs. What you ask is an MOB?MOB is basically an open-faced sandwich, a bit like a pizza, only better and healthier. The bread is made from a special recipe and the shape is like the arches on the Brooklyn Bridge.We ordered two MOBs. I had the Moroccan one, which was an eggplant tagine with also pistachios. I absolutely love tagine, but usually it is meat-based so I can't have it, so I was so happy to eat it here and it was devoured quickly! My date had a Greek/Mediterranean one. It had kale, mushrooms and a sun-dried tomato paste. Absolutely yummy!I will definitely be back to try the ""saucisson"" and also to try other MOBs. I am so elated this place opened in my neighborhood. They also have a nice turntable here and the space is massive. I would love to rent this place out for a veggie party!",5.0
"What a strange restaurant. The concept is a place where you get custom vegan flatbreads (not pizza) made with a proprietary dough, with the bread shaped like a bullet (or the arches of Brooklyn, according to the menu). The space is huge and consists of only four gigantic tables, so you'll probably get to know your neighbors. They give you a hipster comic book with the menu, but I couldn't be bothered to actually read the thing, which features what I assume is the ""Maimonide"" as the main character (a bearded, bespectacled hipster in a toga or something). Oh, and your silverware is hidden in a drawer underneath your spot at the table. The wall decorations are strange and eclectic.So, there's a lot going on and I don't really think it comes together (too many cooks in the kitchen).Anyway, onto the food: You get free kale chips with your meal, which is nice. For my appetizer I started off with the oyster mushroom and chickpea breaded bites ($5) which come with a liquid-y honey mustard sauce. I thought these were okay, but a bit dry, and I wasn't a fan of the dipping sauce.For my main course I got the ""smiley"" ($8) as it was the only flatbread that didn't feature an ingredient that offended me in some way (every other one had something like figs, or cilantro or horseradish or raisins). It consisted of a sundried tomato sauce, topped with small cubes of silken tofu and then a generous amount of arugula.I thought it tasted okay, but wasn't something I'd go out of my way for. The sauce was a bit sour and the silken tofu was a poor choice, given its texture (a firmer, pan-friend tofu would have worked better and given the dish better color).It basically was a pizza without cheese. Granted, I picked the most pizza-like dish on the menu. That said, the proprietary dough wasn't that interesting or impressive: it's slightly spongy bread. Great.For dessert I got a slice of their homemade cheesecake ($7). I thought it was competent, but not great. It was a bit too dry and suffered for a lack of creaminess. I do, however, give them props for their unusual recipe: they make their own cashew milk yogurt to give the cheesecake its base. Most vegan cheesecakes are made with tofutti cream cheese, so this was a rare thing to see. That said, the results were underwhelming.The service was unfailingly polite, friendly and helpful. Kudos to them for having a wonderful staff. I was also given a free goodie bag containing a bunch of random treats, which was a nice gesture.On a whole, Maimonide is interesting, but not great. I appreciate that they take risks with their menu and decor, but I don't think they all succeed. However, I probably will come back here for a drink on their outdoor patio, and maybe try one of their more unusual flatbreads.",3.0
"I liked Maimonide but do not think that I will go back for $10 of a basically slice of pizza.We went there while visiting the ISKON temple in the neighborhood as it was meatless day for us. I ordered the rissoto balls and my husband ordered an appetizer for himself. He didn't know that the portions shall be so tiny. So I had to order a Mob for myself.We liked the ambiance, the kale chips and the yuca fries. The Mobs?

"Really great spot. Loved the open space, loved the fact that they have wifi and are cool with people working there for extended periods of time. And the food is wonderful!My only disappointment? I had scoped the website and wanted to try the Saucisson - a ""Dry cured fennel and sage saucisson of sundried tomato, porcini mushroom and sunflower seed on whole grain sourdough toast with aioli, and pickled radishes."" But the item is no longer on the menu and they need to revamp the site. So I went with the oyster mushroom and chick pea ""nuggets"" with mustard instead, which were a good, hearty choice.So then I really REALLY wanted to do a half and half on the MOB, which wasn't possible. I was bummed since I don't live in the area, but powered through it ;) I ended up with the Bright Eyes, which was a good choice, but I found myself looking around at everyone else's meal longingly too. Yeah, I'm a fat kid. Don't judge.Here's the description of Bright Eyes from the menu: ""House made cashew yogurt, peperonata,a sweet and lightly acidic (from white wine vinegar) stew of sweet peppers and onions. Next the mob is topped with fresh seasonal fava beans and crimini mushrooms roasted in garlic. The final garnish on this mob is a touch of spicy and fresh tasting watercress.""",4.0

"This place is the architectural equivalent of a warm hug. I was here last Sunday for brunch w/ some gal pals and was immediately impressed with the smiling faces that greeted me as well as the fun/charming interiors. It was if the inspiration of the interiors were sunflowers and smiles ... seriously. Just light/airy/tangelo-colored happiness. No joke: The place will make you happy.The food also seems determined to love you. I was a bit ""eh"" at the thought of vegetarian cuisine (since I was starving) but the complimentary cinnamon rolls and my ""Iron Man"" MOB more than filled the void. Fresh and hearty! The waiter suggested the Chamomile/Honey Wine to my buzz-seeking group. It was completely refreshing and my little party of three easily finished the generous carafe. The service all around was stellar, and the outside garden was cute and lively.I really can't say enough good things about it, and I will most certainly be back. What a find!",5.0
"Came here last night with a group of people I wouldn't necessarily define as vegetarians. In fact, we probably would be the opposite. After a few rounds of drinks and settling into an atmosphere that was totally comfortable we began to really enjoy ourselves.The flatbreads were great everyone enjoyed their meals. We all ordered dessert after and continued to keep the drinks flowing. The cheesecake and the brownie were really tasty.In addition to the great setting out back and delicious food our server was fantastic. I can't recall her name but a very sweet girl from Wisconsin who really was attentive and friendly. Overall we had an excellent experience and we left completely satisfied.Would certainly recommend this establishment to anyone willing to have a meal that is different and satisfying.",4.0
"Went to Marty Markowitz' ""State of the Borough"" address with a friend that I always drag to vegan places I want to try. Figured this spot was close and well-fitting with the nationalistic (boroughlistic) theme of the night. We shared the chickpea nuggets, Iron Man MOB and tapioca dessert.Breakdown:Nuggets were bland and dipping sauce was just mustardIron Man was an undercooked flatbread with vegan mayo and steamed kale with a few undercooked shitakes tossed on topTapoica was good but the sugar cookie in it was stale and soggy.The service was good but my friend has a severe nut allergy and when I asked which desserts we could have, the server recommended a cheesecake made with cashews.The atmosphere gets the stars.",2.0
"Coming to a place named/nicknamed MOB, what drew me on the menu was to get a MOB. So, I got what was called a Belly Charmer which consists of Tagine of eggplant, zucchini, and carrot, moroccan spices, pistachio, mint and cilantro on pita-like bread. i really want to like this place, I really do. I like the idea but the MOB was not terribly impressive. It kind of had the look and taste of a pizza, but not as tasty. The particular MOB I got had pistachios on it which was a little weird, but I can't decide whether I hate or love the bites that included a pistachio. Overall, a bit bland. Points for their outdoor garden seating and complimentary kale chips (they were superb but the stems could have been removed, they were a little chewy compared to the lightness of the kale chips).I would come back to try their burger, but for a place named MOB, I would have expected a little more from their signature named dishes.",3.0
"This place is a vegetarian's idea of a wet dream. I saw this place after one of my runs and was curious about it, but wasn't sure if it was Kosher or what. Luckily, a friend of mine clued me in. He also told me about a comic book that talks about this place. It is an awesome colouring book. I mean seriously, if you eat veggies, it gives you superpowers! We came here on a Saturday night near 10pm and there were still a few people eating. Most of the seats are communal. So if you have social anxiety, you might want to skip this place. I personally love breaking bread with others. Food is bonding. The waitress came by quickly, brought us water and kale chips drizzled with olive oil as snacks. Yummy! The main thing they have here are MOBs. What you ask is an MOB?MOB is basically an open-faced sandwich, a bit like a pizza, only better and healthier. The bread is made from a special recipe and the shape is like the arches on the Brooklyn Bridge.We ordered two MOBs. I had the Moroccan one, which was an eggplant tagine with also pistachios. I absolutely love tagine, but usually it is meat-based so I can't have it, so I was so happy to eat it here and it was devoured quickly! My date had a Greek/Mediterranean one. It had kale, mushrooms and a sun-dried tomato paste. Absolutely yummy!I will definitely be back to try the ""saucisson"" and also to try other MOBs. I am so elated this place opened in my neighborhood. They also have a nice turntable here and the space is massive. I would love to rent this place out for a veggie party!",5.0
"What a strange restaurant. The concept is a place where you get custom vegan flatbreads (not pizza) made with a proprietary dough, with the bread shaped like a bullet (or the arches of Brooklyn, according to the menu). The space is huge and consists of only four gigantic tables, so you'll probably get to know your neighbors. They give you a hipster comic book with the menu, but I couldn't be bothered to actually read the thing, which features what I assume is the ""Maimonide"" as the main character (a bearded, bespectacled hipster in a toga or something). Oh, and your silverware is hidden in a drawer underneath your spot at the table. The wall decorations are strange and eclectic.So, there's a lot going on and I don't really think it comes together (too many cooks in the kitchen).Anyway, onto the food: You get free kale chips with your meal, which is nice. For my appetizer I started off with the oyster mushroom and chickpea breaded bites ($5) which come with a liquid-y honey mustard sauce. I thought these were okay, but a bit dry, and I wasn't a fan of the dipping sauce.For my main course I got the ""smiley"" ($8) as it was the only flatbread that didn't feature an ingredient that offended me in some way (every other one had something like figs, or cilantro or horseradish or raisins).

Four large communal tables that encourage communion and conversation. Plaques dedicated to the ""fallen"" vegetables you're about to consume. A clever little comic book delivered with every menu that frames the genesis of the restaurant as a super hero origin story. It's the actual food that leaves something to be desired. Not in quality or taste, but in portion size and presentation.  $11 for a veggie burger and a salad is reasonable for lunch. But the burger is nearly of the slider variety and comes haphazardly thrown together with a crudely thrown down bed of naked greens and a pickle wedge. Basic and kind of lackluster (and too small to satisfy). The patty itself was delicious, but drowning in too much thosand island-like sauce.

My meal was only half over by the time I figured this out.___* And, for the price, it better be.** Even if it is nice to have societal permission to sit next to each other at a restaurant.",4.0
"When a review starts with ""this place has potential"", you kind of know where it's going to go. But this joint does. The space is wonderfully designed. Open and airy. Four large communal tables that encourage communion and conversation. Plaques dedicated to the ""fallen"" vegetables you're about to consume. A clever little comic book delivered with every menu that frames the genesis of the restaurant as a super hero origin story. It's the actual food that leaves something to be desired. Not in quality or taste, but in portion size and presentation.  $11 for a veggie burger and a salad is reasonable for lunch. But the burger is nearly of the slider variety and comes haphazardly thrown together with a crudely thrown down bed of naked greens and a pickle wedge. Basic and kind of lackluster (and too small to satisfy). The patty itself was delicious, but drowning in too much thosand island-like sauce. I wanted to give this place a higher rating, but all the stylish buildup of the ambience and decor was kind of slummed down by the actual meal. I did appreciate the free kale chips though.",3.0
"Yummy - everything we ordered tasted great--from the complimentary kale chips they delivered to us with our Belgian beer, to the amazing chocolate torte and pressed coffee we finished out our evening with.I love dining without any worries that there are hidden animal products lurking in my food!Service was friendly, knowledgeable, and fast-you really can't ask for more in that department!Our appetizer of oven roasted Jerusalem artichokes served with shiitake mushroom gravy was the perfect cold night comfort food.I would highly recommend the M.O.B Burger, a cremini mushroom burger on a delicious sweet potato roll with smoked eggplant and special sauce (the smoked eggplant was divine).We loved the large tables and unique string of overhead lamps (each one is different).We really enjoyed the place and we will definitely be returning!",4.0
"I was between a 3 and a 4 for this rating, but because of the nice ambiance and cool ideals behind this place I went with a 4. I ate here with my husband, who is gluten free - obviously GF + anything else = difficult to find options. We decided to order MOBs (huge pizza/flatbreads with fresh toppings) and a roasted cauliflower bowl to start. The appetizer was awesome, flavorful and large - oh and everyone receives kale chips and filtered water when they sit down, so we didn't mind the somewhat lengthy wait for our MOBs. They were...a little bit disappointing. Unfortunately the GF dough was, well, doughy! The toppings were wonderful though, and I assume that a ""normal"" MOB would probably be better. I also saw many orders of the Mac & Cheese and Mushroom burger that looked AMAZING. I'd come back to try either of those dishes!",4.0
"The mac and cheese is incredible - could not believe it wasn't real cheese. In fact it's the along the best Mac and cheese I've had, vegan or not. The iron man flat bread was also delicious.",5.0
"there was a time when Manhattan had the best vegan restaurants (Counter, Herban Kitchen, Veg City Diner, Helianthus, Zen Palate (when it was good), Angelica Kitchen, etc... no more. One of the three best vegan regular restaurants (not including fancy places like Dirt Candy) is definitely definitely M.O.B. Everything, and I mean, everything I have ever had there has been amazing.  The tofu scramble is absolutely worth me trekking in from Jersey on the weekend. The fries and veggie burger are best and fill the void left by Counter's demise.... and the salads are equally damn good. The champagne with the lavendar sugar cubes, the ice cream sundae (that could feed an army), the beer. You can't go wrong here. American food at its best.  Plus its a cool spot alone or with a huge crowd. I had my birthday there and everyone but me was a hardcore meat-person and everyone ate and enjoyed their food.",5.0
"Can you say AMAZING! Everything I tried was DIVINE. The communal seating at first feels awkward at first, like first day at new school cafeteria but then you get over it.I love that they give you Kale chips rather than bread while you look over the menu. I tried so many things on their menu that was just to die for. I had the Cauliflower appetizer that was great ( I need that recipe)The Mac and Cheese was amazing. It tasted like smoked Gouda but it was vegan, I was like What! Oh and don't forget the flat breads, you must try the Flat breads. I have the Iron Man and it was heavenly.Everything was great. I'm going to have to come here often.",5.0
"The decor here always intrigued me and I finally stopped in to try it.  It's a vegetarian restaurant, but instead of honoring fruits and veggies in their natural form, they cater to those who love American staples - pizza, mac n cheese, and burgers.  I was expecting better options on the menu.  Typically these types of foods are priced $10-$12 but not here...everything was way overpriced.  Ordered the corn soup as a starter, but the server brought it out with our entree. The mushroom burger was tasty but not worth $16, especially since the fries that accompany it were nearly burnt to a crisp and cold. This is a ""one and done"" spot for me.",2.0
"Wandered past M.O.B. one day and perused the menu, as you do, but found myself saying, ""I can eat that, I can eat that, I can eat that,"" as a vegan does when perusing the menu, before actually noticing the whole menu is vegan.  This is always exciting and I looked forward to a brunch there like crazy.That weekend the service wasn't stellar, though the food was.  Mac and cheese is always a winner and I don't need to extoll the awesomeness of it beyond what so many other reviewers already have.  The MOBs are like baby pizzas; cooler than pizzas because instead of being slathered with greasy dairy the airy crunch of the crust carries rich, tasty, roasted veg. All this washed down with a pomegranate somethingoranother cocktail.Inspired to go back for dinner we got service that was unwarrantedly exceptional and the food was just as fantastic.  A dedicated carnivore friend joined my gal and I at the last minute and was blown away by his meal.So many non-vegetarians/non-vegans seem to be surprised when dinner isn't simply raw iceberg lettuce and two carrot sticks artfully arranged.  M.O.B. is as far from lettuce and carrot sticks as fois gras is from a duck.  We're lucky to be in a city where vegan food is, if not the norm, easy enough to access for a night out.  But it's interesting to bear in mind that this place is one of two locations: the other is in Paris.  And the French seem to have something against vegetables, much less vegetarians.  So this is one of maybe a couple of dozen veggie restaurants that can make it in one of the meat-lovingest cities there is...Now that I'm done writing the review I'm hungry and I think I'm going to wander over there for lunch.  There's still so much on the menu I haven't tried.",5.0
"Beet wine. Why are you tasty and unexpected? Are you a wine, or are you a cocktail? Get this drink. It comes in a big goblet-y wine glass with ice. Love this place. So far I have consumed two seperate MOBs, the Summer Glow and the Belly Charmer. MOBs are constructed like a flatbread pizza, but don't taste anything like pizza. They are arch shaped (boat shaped) baked doughs with a variety of vegetables, seasonings, and sometimes fruits and even chocolate. They are served in a baking tray and can be eaten with a fork and knife, or lifted up hand to mouth. Filling and unique.I've also sampled the Mac and Cheese, which is actually macaroni with cashew cream, olive and truffle oil, and brocolli. Very delicious.Is this food actually healthy, or just deceptively void of obviously unhealthy ingredients? Not sure! Either way, I'm in.",4.0
"The place is good for large groups or a single person but if you're two or three people, the large tables are very inconvenient. The music is perfect. The kale chips you get before ordering are not good at all. The hot dog isn't good either (and that for $17 with vegan cheese). The burger was delicious. The crispy fries should be called burnt fries ugh. The potato wedges are meh. Waitress was very nice. We didn't wait for too long.

"I love when I find a vegan restaurant that makes me forget I'm eating vegan food. The food here is flavorful and fresh. We stopped in for a late brunch after wandering around Brooklyn during a visit to NY. I had the buttermilk biscuit and the BF had the Iron Man MOB. The biscuit had a great, moist texture...it melted in my mouth. The ingredients are simple, but it tasted so rich. I didn't get to try the Iron Man because it was inhaled within seconds of its arrival, but there were no complaints from that end of the table. The only thing we found disappointing were the yucca fries. We go bananas for yucca fries, but theirs were a little dry and bland. Oh wells, can't win 'em all.Service is a bit inconsistent, but friendly which makes it hard to be upset.

How could this be?! How could I, a hardcore Brooklynite, foodie and nutrition nerd miss the existence of this place?

We politely informed her of the error, so server took it back, but 5 minutes later brought out only 1 dog for me. We waited and waited for the other dog to come. It must have been at least 10 minutes. Mine got cold waiting so long. In the end, we barely ate our meals. The server brought our check and charged us for only 1 entree, so we presumed that was a gesture to apologize for the mistakes and long wait. We thought that was decent. I paid, but the server had the nerve to bring back a different check with both meals charged. Sorry, MOB, but the mistakes were on your end, not ours.

To me it was always bland, usually either undercooked or overcooked. Not to mention always under seasoned.  Then I discovered MOB, what a revelation, vegetarian food that is lactose free and tastes incredible.  I tried the eggplant / mushroom burger with oven baked yucca fries and coconut tapioca pudding garnished with perfectly ripe slices of juicy bright orange colored mango, and a simply delicious and crispy sugar cookie.

"Love the food here! I'm an omnivore, but went with a vegan friend. You will not miss meat at all. Everything's delicious, well seasoned and filling. The veggie burger I had was the best veggie burger of my life. Delish!Very casual, relaxed, kind of cafe atmoshpere. Everyone shares big communal tables. Fun place to stop in with friends.",5.0
"Happy and expressive service, good music, intriguing layout. Food was robust--no anemic hippie stuff whatsoever. We had the corn soup with curry popcorn, the burger (HOLY MOLY, delicious sauce, plus pickle and yucca fries with homemade ketchup) the Belly Charmer (flatbread with really-tastes-Moroccan spices, eggplant, mint, veggies) and the Iron Man (flatbread with spinach, aioli with a hint of horseradish, mushrooms). Housemade ginger ale and a glass of pinot grigio. I would come here in either in a frentic Michael Pollan moment, OR at regular stuff-my-face o'clock. I'm going back. Prepare for me, Maimonide.P.S. If you live near this place you are just straight up silly not to try it. It's like the hip-hop, vegan lil sis of Bedouin Tent.",4.0
"Space is pleasant (not crowded at all) and kale chips were good. MOB hot dog was only ok. (Dog was dry and cold and side salad was just some mixed greens.) Might have been a one-off thing, but we weren't too pleased about our service either. We both ordered MOB dogs, but server brought out a burger to my friend and nothing to me. We politely informed her of the error, so server took it back, but 5 minutes later brought out only 1 dog for me. We waited and waited for the other dog to come. It must have been at least 10 minutes. Mine got cold waiting so long. In the end, we barely ate our meals. The server brought our check and charged us for only 1 entree, so we presumed that was a gesture to apologize for the mistakes and long wait. We thought that was decent. I paid, but the server had the nerve to bring back a different check with both meals charged. Sorry, MOB, but the mistakes were on your end, not ours. Not in the mood for discussion, we paid that full amount ($34 for 2 hot dogs and a few greens) and even gave a good tip, but I'll probably think twice before recommending or returning.",2.0
"A well thought through ode to Brooklyn and well executed concept; tasteful vegan dishes with a impressive collection of designed interior, friendly, casual staff and laid back ambiance, making the MOB experience a 4+ experience. +.. plus for the gluten free bread, -... minus for going over the top on the AC.. bring a scarf or sweater.",4.0

"Maimonide is a dream come true! I suffer from that terrible fate of a gluten intolerance, and I so miss the bread. Maimonide came to the rescue by offering these amazing sandwich/pizza boats filled with deliciousness and available gluten-free.The space itself is lovely. It's bright and beautiful, with lots of candles and quite charm. The waitstaff are dapper and charming, and just there when you need them. I also love that their tables have these secret drawers in them (look for them!). We tried the yucca fries which were delicious. But, by far the best at our table was the  Iron Man, an amazing blend of kale, shitakes, and spicy aioli. It really doesn't get better than this. Maumonide is a place that vegans and gluten-free folks will rave about, but the delicious food will leave everyone very very happy.",5.0
"I have to say I was amazed, I am a former pro chef, and confirmed carnivore. I was brought to MOB by a friend who said you will not believe what a good  food this restaurant is and vegetarian.   I have always been disappointed by the food of vegetarians. To me it was always bland, usually either undercooked or overcooked. Not to mention always under seasoned.  Then I discovered MOB, what a revelation, vegetarian food that is lactose free and tastes incredible.  I tried the eggplant / mushroom burger with oven baked yucca fries and coconut tapioca pudding garnished with perfectly ripe slices of juicy bright orange colored mango, and a simply delicious and crispy sugar cookie. How the chef makes a lactose free  cookie that tastes this good is beyond me. I want the recipe !!!",4.0
I could not have more good things to say about this place. I live in cobble hill and try to stop in once a week. The ambiance is utterly unique and inviting and the staff are all absolutely delightful and welcoming.I am a vegan and have never had vegan food quite like this. Most other vegan joints tend to lean heavily towards processed soy products which simply isn't the case at MOB. Their selection is really distinct and composed mostly of fresh veg (and you can really tell). They also have a great selection of deserts - definitely try one of their 'cheese' cakes or the tapioca. To top it off they have a great beer/wine/drink list and a quiet outdoor space where you can enjoy your meal in the summer sun.I also had brunch here a few weeks ago and it was absolutely to die for. This is a must try for all vegans and non vegans alike!,5.0
"Though it was painful to fork over sixteen bucks for a dinner consisting only of a burger and fries, the MOB Burger was hands down the best vegetarian burger I've had.  The textures (call me crazy, but it's the closest thing I've had to barbecued pulled pork) and flavors (secret sauce!) elevated the burger so far out of the realm of soy patties and black bean creations that calling it a veggie burger might be a little blasphemous.  The yucca fries (served with Sir Kensington's ketchup no less) were pretty tasty too.I got my food to take away, but still got to experience the solid service: polite, efficient, and bearing kale chips.  The kale chips were crisp and, on the whole, delicious, but a little too salty for me (though I'm pretty finicky about salt).  While waiting, I read their philosophy as chalked on a board below the cash register.  One tenet was ""To democratize access to a balanced and gastronomical diet, especially for young people, in a city like New York, where access to quality restaurants is often reserved for the richest.""  I'm going to go ahead and say that sixteen dollars for burger and fries and ten dollars for their modestly-sized (but delicious-looking) MOBs is not exactly democratizing.  If I could get the same meal I had tonight for ten or twelve bucks, I'd be a regular customer.",5.0
"By far, the BEST vegetarian restaurant I have ever been to. Not only is the food delicious here, but the atmosphere is awesome! We sat inside at one of the large wooden tables and there were candles lit everywhere! The outside seating looked just as comfortable! We got the popcorn soup (I'm obsessed with popcorn!) and the saucisson for the appetizer. Let me tell you, I died. It was SO GOOD!!! The popcorn soup was served cold, which was really refreshing, and it was served with popcorn on the side. I just dumped the whole thing in and ate it together. The saucisson was recommended by the waitress, and I am so thankful she did! I got the Iron Man MOB for my entree (similar to a pizza), while my boyfriend got the MOB Burger. My boyfriend is a meat-eater. He loves his meat.. but to this day, he cannot stop talking about their burger! Seriously, just go and check them out.",5.0

When the adorable cinnamon rolls came to welcome us upon sitting down, I sighed and asked if there was dairy in them, the answer that this was a vegan restaurant and there was no dairy just made my beautiful morning blossom!  They were actually delicious as was the grits brunch and the mushroom burger. The french fries (no more yucca!) were also disappointing, (get the salad?) but the pickles were super tasty as was the french press coffee.

The ""cheese"" is made of cashews & is flavorless, but somehow costs $2 extra. ""Just ok"" mac & ""cheese"". Hot dog that doesn't really get anywhere near the consistency or ""snap"" of the real thing. They can't even make a decent potato wedge--cold, not cooked all the way through, & lacking in really any kind of flavor.

"Three stars with a disclaimer: I am not a vegetarian. When I walked in to Maimonide, I was instantly struck by the design of the restaurant.

I stood in the doorway for a little while, uncertain as to whether or not I should seat myself. There were slender sylph-like male waters wearing tee shirts and funky one-shouldered white aprons, but they were all busy gliding across the floor and talking to guests. Eventually, I awkwardly made my way to the end of a communal table and waited for one of them to approach me. I ordered the corn soup, a salad with greens and sherry shallot vinaigrette, and the Brave Heart M.O.B., which was essentially a flatbread pizza with sundried tomatoes, kale, and mushrooms. The soup was good, although a bit sweet. The salad was pretty straightforward. I'd have enjoyed it more if the dressing had a little more zing - as it was, it tasted fairly bland. When I got my M.O.B., it looked a little different than I expected (no trace of sundried tomato), but I took a few bites anyway. I eventually realized that I'd been given the Iron Man M.O.B. instead of what I'd ordered. It's really not my style to kick up a fuss, so I decided to keep it. When I told my waiter what happened, he gave me a small piece of another, dessert-like M.O.B. to smooth things over. It wound up being my favorite part of the meal. I can't remember the name, but it was delicious, with ripe bananas and a fig spread. On an interesting side-note, I asked my server for the restaurant's wi-fi password, as I wanted to download a book on my Kindle. The server told me that the owners don't believe in guests using the internet while dining there, as it doesn't jive with the communal spirit of the restaurant. Oh-kayyyy... All in all, Maimonide just isn't my cup of tea. I probably won't be going back anytime soon.",3.0
"There was a nice vibe to the place and if you're straight-laced it's kind of hipstery, but getting to have brunch outdoors in the back patio was a bonus. With every menu they also passed out a comic based on the life of Maimonides which was cool in theory but they should have passed it out with the check at the end because it just got in the way.

"This place was a parade of non-stop delicious fantasticness. They have the best mac & cheese I've ever had.  I'm not a vegetarian, and I had to keep reminding myself that it was vegan.  It was rich, and creamy, and some how had a smoked taste of being cooked with bacon. We also had the privilege of the watermelon gazpacho.  There are not enough good things to say about the flavors of this really unique, light & delicious soup.  Everything we ate was great, the beer selection was really good, and my Lavender Wine cocktail, while a bit pricey, was still wonderful.  Not to mention the friendly attentive staff.",5.0
"Free kale chips as an appetizer, what a lovely surprise! I ordered the gluten free Iron Man MOB. It was really delicious, thanks to the horseradish aioli, and very filling. I also had the beet wine, which was earthy and minty and wonderful. The ice makes the glass a little difficult to drink out of though, so be careful! I was really worried I was going to dribble beet juice on my white dress. My food arrived very quickly, but it took a long time to find my waitress afterwards to get the check.",5.0

"Food was delicious but not enough to fill me up. I ordered the California burger with a side salad. The burger is little - I could have had 2. If you have an expansive budget, it's great to eat here and order until you are satisfied. I had hoped my $13 lunch would fill me up, but it did not. My server was courteous and friendly. I prefer to be left alone mostly, but I understand waitstaff are probably encouraged to check in with their customers. I did enjoy eating at a big long wooden table. Typical New York, there were 4 diners and each of us chose to have a a long wooden table to ourselves.",3.0

We were too full for dessert but had a couple of their complimentary cinnamon buns which were amazing but will definitely be going back and saving room for dessert as they looked really fantastic. Overall, the food was prepared beautifully and well seasoned with complex and interesting flavors. The prices were also extremely reasonable. The atmosphere is partial cafe, partial family style dining, overall very inviting. The waitstaff is attentive and friendly.

"I've had my eye on this space since last summer b/c I'm always interested in supporting vegan enterprises.  The dining room is composed of 4 large community tables which are a means for encouraging people to interact. It seems that they really want this to be a melting pot much the way that Brooklyn is. Two Brooklyn Bridge like arches separate the dining room from the open kitchen. Perhaps the lighting from the kitchen can be toned down a touch so as not to glare into the dining room. It was nice to see that they didn't use the standard florescent tube fixtures in the kitchen. Rather, they used individual stemmed lights suspended from the high ceiling. Nearly one whole wall in the dining room is covered in an artistic rendition of the stars & stripes (US flag) & a giant thrown-like chair graces the wall at one end of the room.  Each place setting is equipped w/ a drawer that contains flatware and napkins. A really nice touch. Two very large unusual speakers (everything is unusual; by the way) pump out hip hop music but not too loud to be in the way. To be fair, I was probably the 3rd or 4th customer to eat here. We shared some conversation w/ the one other person at our table who was interested in what we had ordered.  We started w/ the fennel & sage saucisson which was served w/ aioli & whole grain toast. This sausage is a home run; full flavored & perfect texture. The salad of baby lettuces w/ Sherry vinaigrette was light, well dressed & garnished w/ watermelon radish. For entrees, we ordered the Iron Man ""MOB"" & the Belly Charmer ""MOB."" MOB stands for  Maimonide Of Brooklyn (in case you hadn't guessed). All the entrees are served in a Brooklyn Bridge arch shaped bread-like tart shell that arrive to the table on a custom made cast aluminum tray that perfectly cradles the concoction. If that's not a mouth full, read on!The Belly Charmer consisted of tagine of eggplant, zucchini, carrot, Moroccan spices, pistachio, mint & cilantro. Personally, I would have preferred if the eggplant had been cooked much more (crispy & creamy) but it was cooked through. The flavors were balanced & the pistachios added just the right accent.The Iron Man was our favorite of the two entrees. It too is served in the bread shell (as are all of the entrees). It consisted of shiitake mushrooms (nicely browned), sauteed kale, horseradish aioli & parsley. The aioli was the perfect balance to the nutty shiitakes. These entrees are almost like getting a large designer slice of pizza made w/ healthful ingredients. I might suggest that they offer a gluten-free option once they get settled. We also sampled their olive oil roasted yucca fries. They were nice & crispy and toothsome as you would expect from yucca. We were pleased to have been offered some spicy ketchup that they had been experimenting with. It definitely rounded out the fries. Although we only drank sparkling water, it was nice to see that they offered fresh fruit juices as well as Fizzy Lizzy sparkling fruit drinks.The waitstaff is warm & eager to please. Nobody was beyond answering questions & are on their way to knowing the in & outs of the menu. The menu is very reasonably priced & accessible to many. I believe that this is their intention. Two of us had everything that I mentioned & spent $41.00 including a 20% tip.  I'm confident that they are off to a great start & will win the hearts of Brooklynites & non-Brooklynites alike in no time.

"I am completely enamored with this restaurant. Its trademark open faced sandwiches are a real culinary treat but what gets less attention is the awesome sides and out-of-this-world brunch. The chef(s) present innovative, healthy, and absolutely delicious versions of comfort foods. Buttermilk Biscuit Sandwich Of Smoked Eggplant, Avocado, Aioli, and Tomato is but one example. I swear, everything I've eaten there (and I'm slowly making my way through the whole menu) has blown me away. Aside from the food, here's a top five list of things I like about the place:1. gorgeous patio out back2. really good musicians playing in the corner on weekend nights.

Dessert. (sorry, i realize that also falls in the food category but i really can't leave it out.)My advice: go and go often.

"a friend suggested wandering over here on a friday night because they were open late and so we did. the kale chips they give you right off the bat are great. i ordered the lavender champagne which was absolutely delicious and we got the roasted colored cauliflower as an appetizer. omg. i wish i could have had it as an entrée. the aioli was absolutely to die for and the cauliflower was cooked to perfection. we both got MOB burgers which were pretty good but honestly, i'd go back again just to eat the cauliflower and kale chips.",4.0

"Loved it. Beautiful backyard patio to sit quietly and eat with my husband. He is a meat-eater, so it was a treat to be able to sit down to a meal where we could share everything.

We had a great time and will surely eat there again soon!",4.0
"Really love this place. The service is excellent - friendly and attentive - the music is great, and the food is fresh and so good. My favorite is the gluten-free belly warmer MOB with yucca fries.

my boyfriend and I had dinner here. the food was amazing. it will def be our spot. my mother and i are transitioning to a vegan diet. i cannot wait to bring her here.eta: the menu is a bit carb-heavy. i hope to not consume as much carbs next time around.,4.0

"I went there today with a friend and a gentleman named Ara waited on us and he was awesome! Great service and suggestions. I eat gluten free and dairy free so sometimes it is difficult to find things that are yummy while out to eat and this place was perfect.

"I've had my eye on this space since last summer b/c I'm always interested in supporting vegan enterprises.  The dining room is composed of 4 large community tables which are a means for encouraging people to interact. It seems that they really want this to be a melting pot much the way that Brooklyn is. Two Brooklyn Bridge like arches separate the dining room from the open kitchen. Perhaps the lighting from the kitchen can be toned down a touch so as not to glare into the dining room. It was nice to see that they didn't use the standard florescent tube fixtures in the kitchen. Rather, they used individual stemmed lights suspended from the high ceiling. Nearly one whole wall in the dining room is covered in an artistic rendition of the stars & stripes (US flag) & a giant thrown-like chair graces the wall at one end of the room.  Each place setting is equipped w/ a drawer that contains flatware and napkins. A really nice touch. Two very large unusual speakers (everything is unusual; by the way) pump out hip hop music but not too loud to be in the way. To be fair, I was probably the 3rd or 4th customer to eat here. We shared some conversation w/ the one other person at our table who was interested in what we had ordered.  We started w/ the fennel & sage saucisson which was served w/ aioli & whole grain toast. This sausage is a home run; full flavored & perfect texture. The salad of baby lettuces w/ Sherry vinaigrette was light, well dressed & garnished w/ watermelon radish. For entrees, we ordered the Iron Man ""MOB"" & the Belly Charmer ""MOB."" MOB stands for  Maimonide Of Brooklyn (in case you hadn't guessed).

"Wow...who knew vegetarian could be so good!  Ok, well, maybe you did, but I didn't.  Not that I'm a big meat eater either, but vegetarian fare never really crossed my mind.  So glad we decided to venture out for something different.  When you first roll up, the place is very unassuming and low key.  You walk in and you see it's not set in the standard restaurant style.....there a four very large family style tables.  The decor is urban/funky/chic.  The crowd is, just as the Yelp profile states, hipster in nature.  We were immediately greeted and told ""don't be shy, just find a spot anywhere"".

For entrees we had the MOB burger which was deeeelish! I can't have sesame seeds so they accommodated me by putting it some nice hearty toasted slice bread.  My wife had one of the specials that came with polenta and artichokes and it was very good.  The girls split the Mac n cheese which came with broccoli rage and smoked cashews.  The Mac was delicious, but none of us was thrilled with the flavor the smoked nuts brought to the dish and the broccoli rate was too bitter for the kids (but I love it, so it didn't go to waste).  Of course we had to do dessert, so two of us opted for the coconut tapioca, which was creamy and delicious, one had the chocolate torte with homemade Nutella...if you like chocolate, you'll love it.  And my wife had one of the specials again which was a cake made from some Asian fruit and coconut frosting.  That cake was AWESOME!!!!  Considering the amount of food we ordered, the price was average and ther service was fine.  We will absolutely be back again, yes, with the kids.",4.0

"We had the mushroom and pea nuggets, corn soup, and yuca fries, all of which were pretty delicious. Then we had two MOBs (boat-shaped kind of pizza crusts topped with various stuff) , the Iron Man (greens, mushroom and alot of aioli) and the Belly Charmer (tagine of eggplant, carrot, and pistachios). Both were good, but the Iron Man was the standout - rich and flavorful, if almost impossible to bite for all the greens.They used to have a delicious carrot cake with hazelnut frosting which was great, that they no longer make. The cheesecake is okay. The tapioca pudding sounds boring, but is delicious.They also do a good brunch - the spicy grits are great. Pancakes are good. The other biscuit thing not memorable. The space is large and bright, with four communal tables. Very nice. The servers wear smocks that make them look like cult initiates. A comic book which describes very little of anything comes with the menu. The MOBs come on a big metal Brooklyn bridge shaped platter, each sitting in its arched slot. You push your MOB off onto another empty plate, and eat it. Can't figure out what's up with the metal platter. Your utensils are in little drawers under the table, bound in rubber bands. The check comes closed in a little can. The to go containers are just perfectly engineered to fit a MOB, and fit into the paper bag that comes with them perfectly. Its a little precious.I recommend, though they do have some things to work out.",4.0

"loved their brunch, will be back for more for sure.friends suggested this place and I thank them for it.its a great space, love the airyness of it, the huge communal tables, wall decor friendly service and, of course, the food.I had the grits with kale and mushroom sausage, which was delish, bf had their burger, also very tasty. my friends also had the pancakes which were fluffy and yummy. shared one of their MOBs, very tasty!their beer selection is nice, too and I had the beet-cocktail, which, if you like beet, is very nice as well.would be a great place for a celebration since they have such big tables.cant wait for summer days in the garden",5.0
"Great service and such a cool designed place! The mac n cheese was delicious along with their m.o.bs, coconut tapioca was awesome! Yuum!",4.0
Loved it. Great vegan food.,5.0
Tonight was my first visit. I ordered the nuggets and the mac and cheese. I had the nuggets first and I DID NOT LIKE them. I was worried the mac and cheese would be terrible but it was GREAT. I would love the recipe because it was on of the BEST vegan mac and cheese I have ever had. I can't say that it tastes like the real thing because I've been vegan for 16 years but I could eat another bowl right now!,4.0
i have found my favorite vegan/vegetarian restaurant on this planet. i wish i could give this place a 6th star. that is all.,5.0
"We had the mushroom and pea nuggets, corn soup, and yuca fries, all of which were pretty delicious. Then we had two MOBs (boat-shaped kind of pizza crusts topped with various stuff) , the Iron Man (greens, mushroom and alot of aioli) and the Belly Charmer (tagine of eggplant, carrot, and pistachios). Both were good, but the Iron Man was the standout - rich and flavorful, if almost impossible to bite for all the greens.They used to have a delicious carrot cake with hazelnut frosting which was great, that they no longer make. The cheesecake is okay. The tapioca pudding sounds boring, but is delicious.They also do a good brunch - the spicy grits are great. Pancakes are good. The other biscuit thing not memorable. The space is large and bright, with four communal tables. Very nice. The servers wear smocks that make them look like cult initiates. A comic book which describes very little of anything comes with the menu. The MOBs come on a big metal Brooklyn bridge shaped platter, each sitting in its arched slot. You push your MOB off onto another empty plate, and eat it. Can't figure out what's up with the metal platter. Your utensils are in little drawers under the table, bound in rubber bands. The check comes closed in a little can. The to go containers are just perfectly engineered to fit a MOB, and fit into the paper bag that comes with them perfectly. Its a little precious.I recommend, though they do have some things to work out.",4.0
"This place was recommended by a friend of mine and the whole family (vegans) went.  I like the concept of a communal table and there are about 5 in this place.  The wall has artwork made by previous patrons on the wall.  They are red, white and blue sheets of paper which make up the American flag on the wall.  I like this place because it's open and friendly.  Each table has a bowl of delicious kale chips to munch on while making up your mind. There were 5 in our party, so we had 2 bowls.  Even the kids in the group loved them.  We all had different  entrees but I personally got the hot dog or more to the point, the carrot dog.  It was a delicious mix of carrots and spices that hit the spot.  We all got yucca fries which were equally delicious.  It is a little pricy but I think when you serve vegan food and you make all your own cheez etc. it can run into money.  One person got one of the flatbread pizzas and loved it.  There were some gluten free options as well.",4.0
Been here at least 5 times already and its fantastic every single time. We've tried pretty much the entire menu by now and all the dishes are delicious. You don't have to be a vegetarian to enjoy this food either -- it's very filling and satisfying. The service is super friendly and the space is really cute and quirky in a good way. Can't wait to go back!,5.0
"clean, different, positive and most important, healthy atmosphere. the menu was familiar, but different. lots of color, flavor and uniqueness.they place is just downright about quality of consumption. they want you feeling good after you eat.nice vibe inside. giant communal tables. when i went it was kinda quiet, they had a dj who was playing laid back hip-hop and other varieties, and it wasnt too loud at all.prices are adequate. food and service, far exceedes adequate. I'm down with M.O.B.oh yah, and although i didnt experience it in a dinning sense, they have an awesome outdoor garden/patio deal with tons of space!",5.0
"This place rocks. Tasty, healthy food -- I'm not a vegan but I like the food and the vibe and plan to be a regular. The MOBs (basically flatbread pizzas) are great -- esp. the Smiley, and the Glowing Skin was nice too. Hopefully they'll rotate them occasionally and have different types. The vegan burger is awesome. We had a special of artichoke crostini, which were dynamite. The wine list is good. There are some misses: The BellyCharmer MOB was exquisite the first time (moroccan style) tho not so much when I went back (but maybe I wasn't in the mood for it, not sure). A friend had the vegan ""saucisson"" -- the first bite was good but you can't eat the whole thing -- the taste is too strong. We had some sort of oyster mushroom ""nuggets' -- not very good. And the honey-chamomile wine, while it sounds good, was not to my liking -- it is tea mixed with wine, and I didn't care for whatever wine it was mixed with. Also, the pasta was on the menu and they didn't have it (it wasn't clear that they'd run out -- rather it seemed like they didn't quite have their act together) . So I hope they work out those kinks. As far as the decor goes, it is great, creative, interesting, fun -- though it's a definite challenge for first-timers to find the silverware!  And the music and the DJ are great (I think they may do live music Fridays and Saturdays) . And the garden looks nice. And the brunch menu looks good. The service is excellent -- everyone is radiant and friendly and lovely. I hope this place succeeds. It's a bit out of the way but overall (if you heed my advice!) worth the trip. Oh, and the vegan no-cheesecakes (chocolate and otherwise) are great!",4.0
"I cannot say enough about how wonderful my experience was here at this place. I would absolutely go back and recommend this to anyone (travelers or locals!). I had a coupon from Living Social (remember to always read the small print) so that is what brought my friend and I to this place. We took a train to Brooklyn and got off at Atlantic Avenue, walked a few blocks Northwest of the station we arrived at and we were there! The walk gave us a good cultural experience. We were greeted as we walked in and inferred that we could sit anywhere. Our server, Arie, welcomed us and gave us the run-down of how our coupon worked as well as their service. He brought us Kale Chips and waters. We each had a glass of wine, I would recommend the Beet Wine if you are wanting a new experience and flavor! Then he brought us our soups for appetizers. The soup was amazing and full of flavor! Once finished with those, we had our main course. I cannot exactly remember what our flat breads were but one had Spinach, mushrooms, and a Alfredo-like sauce on it, and the other had diced vegetables with a pesto sauce. Both were so delicious. During our meals we were educated on the history of the restaurant and the neighborhood! After our main course, we had dessert! A cheesecake (made with no cheese though!) and a tapioca pudding. Both once again were yummy! I would highly recommend anyone to dine at this place, I will definitely go back on my next trip! It is a secret to the the tourist world...but I guess that is what we enjoyed about it! Very local and full of history, while eating a healthy meal to nourish our bodies! :)",5.0
