"Found mix of dead and live roaches in our plates. When I went to the salad man to ask for some tahini, I found him playing with his finger in his dirty feet. Unclean staff. You will be easily got deceived by a food the look fresh, but full of bacteria. I ended up having H. Pylori bacterial infection in my gout. Avoid them If you want to be in a good health.DEAD AND LIVE SMALL ROACHES IN OUR PLATES.",1.0
"Service is a bit strained but we got there just as the Watchtower let out for lunch so they were slammed. Still worth the wait. Lawmaking is exceptional , falafel is too. Merguez sausage has excellent flavor but a bit dry.  Bread is hit and hummus delicious try the hibiscus or loomi cold drinks. They are delightfully different flavored that will let your mouth feel happy   Great food experience in a very family run sort of place.  Definitely will be a favorite when I am on that side of the river!",4.0
"I hate that I wasn't that hungry when I came here. I was showing a few friends the city and decided to catch a breather here. Very easy location to find. It was my first time here. We ordered chicken sandwiches and were not disappointed. Pita was incredibly fresh and the chicken was full of flavor. The only complaint I have of the sandwich is that I would have liked some more sauce, sandwich overall was a bit dry but still good nonetheless. I really wanted to try their falafel plate but unfortunately really wasn't that hungry hence my first sentence. The waitstaff was incredibly friendly, I ordered a loomi (Egyptian drink) and it was my first time having it. After I tried it the waiter came up to me and said that if I didn't like it he would exchange it for another at no cost! A friend had the hibiscus drink which was really delicious but I didn't mind my loomi drink. They also gave us cornbread on the house which was really generous on their part. Decor leaves something to be desired but don't let that keep you from going in and trying the food!",4.0
"This place was hoppin' on a Saturday late afternoon. I got the salad platter (choice of 5 salads) and the dish was very pleasant... until I encountered a hair in my dish. I guess things like this happen? I did think the pita/bread that they serve with the platter was on the harder side than other Middle Eastern places and I prefer the softer pitas.If I happened to be in the neighbourhood again and was hungry, I think I'd come back here? ... I'm unsure, but its a possibility.",3.0
"Very unassuming place. We came in the earlier side of the evening, after walking over the Brooklyn Bridge. No one was eating inside so we were a little suspect. But we decided to give it a try since there were many positive Yelp reviews. So glad we did! Everything was delicious!! My husband got the merguez plate and cleaned the plate! I shared the shrimp pitza with my 8 year old and also ordered a small falafel plate. Don't expect your standard type of pizza! It's better! Definitely going to come back when I am in the hood and try different things.",5.0
"Had the lambajin and chicken pizza, no one liked the lambajin, the tomato sauce kills it but the chicken was good, so was the feta salads and stuffed grape leaves. The meat sandwich wrap was also ok but nothing was mind blowing. I've been to the middle east and i absolutely love manakeesh, but the pitza (manakeesh) here is nothing like that experience.  The place is quiet,  mostly empty,  The guy behind the counter is nice but It's not a memorable experience. It's okay for a bite.",3.0
Just a great combination of a good mediterian food for great prices in such a great location. I recently got transfered to this neighborhood and was looking for such a place. Thank God this place is here. The look is pretty casual with great and friendly personel. Food is always fresh. Highly recommend visiting it when around this area.,5.0
"It's a small, relaxed, no frills, sit-down cafe. The food was delicious. We got the 5-salad appetizer which came with tasty (but somehow not overly-filling) pita bread. The ""sandwiches"" were packed with meat and flavor. You get a good amount of food per $, especially compared to Manhattan. CASH ONLY",4.0
"First time going in at 7pm last Thursday. I wanted a falafel as I don't eat meat or chicken.  I was told they were out of falafel. At 7pm on Thursday? It's the like the Pope saying he's out of prayers. Make some more! Then i asked to just buy a pita cause I was starving and needed a snack to make it through my journey to find food elsewhere. I was told he could not make one pita, it took too much time. Huh? Are they rolling each one by hand? Is that why they don't have time to make more falafel? As the young kids would say, FOH.I wish I could review the food, but unfortunately, I was not given the opportunity to buy any. The attitude was bad enough to kill my appetite for anything this place has to offer, especially when an amazing middle eastern spot called Fatoosh is just on the opposite end of Hicks (by Atlantic).",1.0

The ""white sauce"" is the real thing--tahini based, not that sour cream/mayo crap that you find at other places. $10 for lunch sounds about right in this area. The only problem is that I wish it was a bit closer to my work place. It's a bit of a walk from Dumbo, especially in the winter.",4.0
Good food and reasonably priced. Felt like it was my first time eating real middle eastern food.  Generally very aromatic tastes with spice forward (not to be confused with hot) flavor.  Well made. Their pita bread came out steaming hot. The falafel was full of flavor but my taste buds wanted more salt. It was well made with a nice crispy outside and moist crumbly inside. Chicken pitza was our other dish which is as also good. Again my taste buds wanted more salt but the food was definitely spice forward. Not sure what spice but it wasn't a cumin base. Heavy on the peppers. The green onions were also a nice compliment. The pizza bread had a subtle smoky flavor. Crispy crust with a nice doughy base. Ther was no cheese to hold things together but it was still a well made pitza in my book.,4.0

"This no-frills place has cheap, great mediterranean food. We go quite often since it is down the street from our apt, and it is consistently good.The decor is nothing to write home (or yelp) about, but it is clean and there is always a table if you decide to dine-in. In the summer, there are outdoor tables and palms on the sidewalk for people watching.Service is friendly, but a little slow; the reason it seems to be slow is because everything is made to order, including each pita. When we order (usually for take-out) we see them start with pounding out our pita and popping them into the oven; when they come out, they are super fluffy and puffy delectable carb clouds!

"I stumbled upon this place when I was walking  around  Brooklyn and I was absolutely  blown away. I have yet to taste something  so authentic  and delicious as far as middle eastern food in NYC go. The food was so flavorful but light at the same time, not greasy like all the fast food and high end joints in Manhattan.  The spinach  and cheese pie, chickpea and spinach  salad, and baba ghanouj  are a must!",5.0
Excellent food and service. Garden salad and soup was incredible...the falafels were good and the humus was excellent.,4.0
Love the chicken sandwich and it was cheap. They do take a while to make the food so call ahead.,4.0
So I came down here to grab a salad during the arts festival.  Their garden salad is so good other garden salads soups take that name off their menu until they equal the quality of this place.  Very friendly staff and good price especially for the variety of vegetables yet great taste of the salad.  Will definitely be coming back here often!,5.0
"This no-frills place has cheap, great mediterranean food. We go quite often since it is down the street from our apt, and it is consistently good.The decor is nothing to write home (or yelp) about, but it is clean and there is always a table if you decide to dine-in. In the summer, there are outdoor tables and palms on the sidewalk for people watching.Service is friendly, but a little slow; the reason it seems to be slow is because everything is made to order, including each pita. When we order (usually for take-out) we see them start with pounding out our pita and popping them into the oven; when they come out, they are super fluffy and puffy delectable carb clouds! Great fresh pita! And usually one of the staff serves complimentary tea while you're sitting and waiting for the food.Note: no alcoholic beverages served here; signs are posted everywhere, almost comically.Also, CASH ONLY (with ATM inside)Best food we've had here:***Chicken sandwich (this is our standard, go-to here)***Pita and [fill in the blank; humus, babaghanouj, nothing but pita]***Spinach cheese pie***Beet salad***Merguez sandwich (although kinda greasy)",4.0

"After taking hundreds of Brooklyn Bridge Park photos in a hot summer day on  September 04, I really need a cool and relaxed evening without lots noise or large crowd.I really want a fresh cold dish and just a quiet place to sit.  This place was it.  I took the fellow ""Yelpers"" recommendations and ordered the lam sausage with fresh green salad and hummus dip (you have egg plant as other option).  My best friend had the chicken felafel.  Lam was dried and tasteless only gets good with the hummus dip.  The chicken felafel was very juicy and tasty.  So why 4 stars?  Because the staffs were very friendly, and genuinely nice.  We didn't order any drinks but we've got a pitch of ice cold water with fresh slice of yellow lemon.  Very affordable price, fresh food, quiet, calm, and good hosting brings me back to chicken felafel for the next time.  10 minutes waking distance from the Brooklyn Bridge Park entrance.  (NYkers walk, not a touristy walk).

"Tutt Cafe is a great dining option if you're in the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood. A great place for a sit down meal or takeout, It's a cheap but delicious option that was really necessary in the Heights area. While I did have takeout, I noticed on a Saturday lunchtime how packed the place was. There was young families, older individuals, and some more college aged kids all dining. The place is very relaxed a there were a lot of kids. Their menu is very affordable and I like how they offer pizzas and more traditional Middle Eastern fare.I had the lambajin, which can be described as a lamby spread on pizza dough.  A large pizza for 1 (it's approximately 10 inches), you will be full afterwards, though it does taste significantly worse after the first bite. I loved my first bite, but it slowly lost it's appeal as the crust was not as crisp near the center and was not as good when it was not piping hot. The topping was something like a middle eastern sloppy joe (with lamb) and you'd really have to try it before you explaining what it tastes like.All in all, I think it's a 3.5 star joint, but I think its prices and its uniqueness gives it that extra bump up to 4 stars",4.0

"So Bobby C. has been advocating for this place since he came here a few months ago, going on and on about their delicious falafel. Blah Blah. We were in the general area on Saturday, and after storming out of Waterfalls Restaurant due to their horrible new owner, he persuaded me to make the cold walk down to Tutt's for his precious falafel. While we sat there after ordering 2 falafels and a chicken Pitza, he made 2 bold statements:1) This is the best falafel you're gonna have ever.2) After this you won't be able to eat at Cheep's again.Of course refering to Cheep's Pita Creations, my go to spot for cheap falafel goodness. Now the Tutt's cafe falafel finally came out, and here's what's up: it's smaller than Cheep's, but I guess that's to be expected. They didn't put enough white sauce in it for my liking as well. Outside of that though, it was the best falafel I've ever had. Fresh baked bread, right when you order it, the actual falafel that's fried up has so many spices that you really barely notice the lack of sauce. Oh man is it good. And it better be too, because it's $4 (compared to the new city standard of $2.50 for Cheep's or even Mamoun's). And despite it's small stature, it's actually quite satisfying.It was great ordering that chicken Pitza as well. I've never had anything like that, chicken with lots of spices on a baked pita, with herbs and peppers and stuff, it had a very unique taste, almost magically delicious. Everything we had at this place was amazing, including the beers we bought at Key Food earlier because Tutt cafe is BYOB (sweet).This is the best falafel around, but there's a very good chance I will be eating at Cheep's again, I mean, it is open really late, cheaper, and a lot closer to places I'm usually at than Tutt's.

The gentleman who spoke to me on the phone was lovely, as was the deliveryman. Delivery was prompt and my food was piping hot! Just like it was fresh out of the oven.I did get a pitza, which was really tasty, with a nice, flavorful sauce, ample amount of cheese, and fresh veggie toppings - but everything else blew the pizza out of the water! Fresh hummus and fresh baked pita = YUM. The falafal was really good too and the salads were huge and super fresh. A side of stuffed grape leaves had my boyfriend yell at me from the kitchen: THIS IS INCREDIBLE! All this for under $30 including tax and tip! Enough food for lunch and dinner! That's dirt cheap for Brooklyn Heights. I definitely have a new take out standby, and I am excited to sit down for a proper meal in the cafe.",5.0
"Please order the spinach-cheese pie. It really is a pastry filled with delight (said Mo C.). At $4.50, the cheapskate skeptic in me declared, ""No."" But it was recommended by Yelpers AND the other items were around the same price, so I added it. The pastry was 19 cm+ (7.4 inches) and fairly thin. It was soft and loosely filled with fresh spinach. The stringy mozzarella cheese was a wonderful accompaniment to it, adding a satisfactory chewiness to the pie.Falafel sandwich had flavour and seasoned goodness. The onion stood out the most in freshness, and gave the sandwich/burrito styled item an extra crisp taste. If you're ordering items to go, it may take 10 minutes, as they appear to freshly bake and make most items. Love you, Tutt Cafe!",5.0

"I've been looking forward to stopping by Tutt's after good friend of mine recently moved to Brooklyn Heights.  It's only a short walk down the street and I just can't resist middle eastern food. So last weekend on an empty stomach, we stopped in for an incredibly satisfying yet affordable meal.  We ordered à la carte and shared a lamb sandwich, chick pea soup with fresh baked pita, some really incredible roasted eggplant babaganoush, with fresh baked pita and a fresh baked mini pita pizza.Whatever you do make sure you order pita bread in some form, it's amazing. It arrives quickly from the oven to your table as a huge puffed up steaming pillow of awesome. Their pita really couldn't be better and they offer so many choices of toppings, so enjoy. The pricing is very reasonable; for all that I mentioned above think we paid $25 for two which really can't be beat.Keep in mind this is not  fine dining but that's ok, here's what to expect. Tutt's is an oddly decorated & smallish cafe that comes complete with 1 overworked server and a bunch of bakers scaling dough behind the front counter. What's funny is they recently closed for a short time for renovation. After visiting however, I'm thinking the renovations were not cosmetic. Perhaps they installed more ovens but who knows, either way, I like it. In fact, a group of people we met up with later overheard us raving about it and ran down to pickup some lamb sandwiches to go. I'm pretty sure only one lamb sandwich made it out the door.  Tutt's is just another excellent choice for an affordable meal in Brooklyn Heights, which seems to be expected for the area. I also enjoyed a meal at one of the best sushi restaurants just off Henry St. a few weeks back and I'm looking forward to exploring the area.",4.0
"Good food for a good price. Casual diner atmosphere, but attentive and friendly staff. Great location--just down the block from both the brooklyn heights theater and the promenade.I suggest the spinach pie as an appetizer. I had a platter which was under $10; Crisp salad, warm pita, yummy sausage, and good hummus.",4.0
"Why has it taken me this long to order from here? This place is literally a minute from my apartment and it is delicious!This review is for their delivery and food - I haven't eaten in the restaurant - YET!I had a desperate crazing for pizza and Fascati's was on one of their many holiday hiatus so I decided to finally give this place a try. The gentleman who spoke to me on the phone was lovely, as was the deliveryman. Delivery was prompt and my food was piping hot! Just like it was fresh out of the oven.I did get a pitza, which was really tasty, with a nice, flavorful sauce, ample amount of cheese, and fresh veggie toppings - but everything else blew the pizza out of the water! Fresh hummus and fresh baked pita = YUM. The falafal was really good too and the salads were huge and super fresh. A side of stuffed grape leaves had my boyfriend yell at me from the kitchen: THIS IS INCREDIBLE! All this for under $30 including tax and tip! Enough food for lunch and dinner! That's dirt cheap for Brooklyn Heights. I definitely have a new take out standby, and I am excited to sit down for a proper meal in the cafe.",5.0
"Please order the spinach-cheese pie. It really is a pastry filled with delight (said Mo C.). At $4.50, the cheapskate skeptic in me declared, ""No."" But it was recommended by Yelpers AND the other items were around the same price, so I added it. The pastry was 19 cm+ (7.4 inches) and fairly thin. It was soft and loosely filled with fresh spinach. The stringy mozzarella cheese was a wonderful accompaniment to it, adding a satisfactory chewiness to the pie.Falafel sandwich had flavour and seasoned goodness. The onion stood out the most in freshness, and gave the sandwich/burrito styled item an extra crisp taste. If you're ordering items to go, it may take 10 minutes, as they appear to freshly bake and make most items. Love you, Tutt Cafe!",5.0

I am extremely picky when ordering chicken from a restaurant, even high-end ones, as not everyone goes to the (admittedly obsessive) lengths I do when preparing chicken at home to remove sinew and other ""crunchy"" bits.

My BF had the chicken sandwich which I thought was better.  The fresh pita out of their pizza oven was also very good.  Overall, for around $11, this was a good spot that I'd come to again.

"Not familiar with Brooklyn Heights, my husband and I were wandering around on a Sunday afternoon, looking for an interesting restaurant that was open -- a lot of places are closed for lunch and / or on Sunday period, so it was a little disappointing until we came across Tutt Cafe.This place is casual and cheap -- which makes the delicious, freshly baked dishes even more tasty, in both my estimation and my husband's opinion!  The only downside is that they don't take credit cards -- but if you've got cash on you, then it's worth shelling out the currency to order a wide-cross section from the menu!We ordered falafel balls, which came out quickly (about ten minutes) and were steaming; they were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and had a delicious nutty flavor.  Immediately following that, the waiter served us piping hot pita bread (that was still inflated from baking) and very smooth hummus.  For our main courses, my husband ordered a Mediterranean sausage -- which was much less greasy than an Italian style sausage.  It almost had the consistency of a more dry meatloaf, except it was all meat, and pretty spicy!  It was great, although I don't think I personally would enjoy a whole meal of this particular sausage.I loved what I ordered, though -- the Chicken ""Pitza.""  I don't know if there really is such a thing as Mediterranean pizza (""pitza""), but even if this place invented it for their menu, I don't care.  It was great.  The lemon chicken was extremely moist and well flavored / spiced.  The concept of Mediterranean pizza, I guess, is that you don't have any cheese or tomato sauce -- the delicious crust was steaming, crunchy and doused in olive oil instead of the usual toppings.  Then the chicken and diced red and green peppers completed the trimmings.The atmosphere was, as I said, casual -- but cozy -- and we enjoyed ourselves immensely.  It's tucked away on a side-street in Brooklyn Heights, not too far from the Brooklyn Heights Promenade, which offers an incredibly view of the Manhattan skyline.  If you're wandering around the area, definitely check this place out.",5.0

"Brooklyn Heights is one of many charming neighborhoods which is pleasant to stroll through on a lightly cool March evening. With its historic, high-sealing-brick row homes, sporadically scattered bars, and quaint cafes, it's a calmly romantic excursion.Tutt Cafe is nestled on a quiet street between the gorgeous, extravagantly mortgaged apartments. As we walk in we're a bit hesitant due to the initial, Chinese take-out atmosphere (aka non-atmosphere). With a flashy green awning, empty dining room with few tables (half of which were nude, while the others sported a double layer of cloth), random Christmas lights throughout, a soda fridge, and explicitly cheesy menu item photos, our initial reaction was plan B...which, due to its non-existent nature, left us with the opportunity to sit wherever we pleased (see pics at mariyayufest.blogspot.com).The pleasant waiter/phone attendant/cashier/expediter/host rushed to our table with two menus and asked us if we might be interested in any beverages (non-alcoholic, as Tutt Cafe is BYOB). We chose the finest NYC tap water they had to offer, which was delivered in a large pitcher accompanied by lemon and two metallic glasses; a positive sign. As we made our choices, the phone rang non-stop, as the friendly multi-tasking, aforementioned gentleman hurriedly rushed to please everyone. A few more clients entered, all seating themselves and all greeted with the same respect and welcoming nature.For appetizers we chose the plate of mixed salads (babaghanouj, humus, stuffed grape leaves, lentil & bulgar, and laba salad) as well as spinach and cheese pie. Our initial request of falafel was regretfully rejected, due to the fact that they just sold their last order of the fried savory balls. Nonetheless, we moved on to the Lambajin (middle eastern pitza with lamb) and leg of lamb sandwich.Our colorful plate of salads was brought out after a much anticipated ~20 minute wait-with a surprise! Two, perfectly cooked, fluffy, fried falafel rounds topped our flavorful and delicate grape leaves (perhaps this contributed to our wait). The most tender, not over fried, appropriately crispy, and exceptionally sized falafel drops were a great start to what was going to be a tasting adventure. The humus and babaghanouj were fittingly flavored, while the laba salad (a middle eastern yogurt, flavored with mint), had a slight sourness and was a great dipping sauce for the puffed pita (which came with the plate). The lentil/bulgar salad was tender and the grains were perfectly cooked, however it's flavor was lacking. The fried onion garnish provided a nice texture alternative, yet did little in adding flavor.Our next course-the spinach and cheese pie-was served on a wooden peel, escorting a lemon wedge. The puffed, homemade pita was stuffed with tender spinach-cut into bite size pieces, allowing for full enjoyment without the stringy mess which sometimes is encountered when the spinach is too large. The cheese was just melted and when combined with a tiny squeeze of the lemon, provided a fresh flavor to the large pie.As we filled our bellies, our final courses emerged out of the open kitchen. The liberally served, extremely tender lamb, cradled by a fresh pitta, lettuce, and tomato, had mild flavors and virtually no tendons. The generously sized pitza filled the restaurant with a strong aroma of cumin. Topped with ground lamb and tomato, it encompassed an incredible blend of middle eastern spices, while being carried on freshly baked pitza dough-with a golden crust,which once more made a great vessel for the left over laba salad.As we slowly finished our exorbitant menu, the initial hesitation was completely forgotten. Feeling completely at home in Tutt's extremely warm (literally and figuratively) space our appreciation flowed for the abundance of variety, flavor, and hospitality. As we waited for the check, the distinctively pleasant waiter hurried over with a small plate of basbousa (semolina cake with yogurt and honey) ""on the house"". Being fabulously surprised, yet intensely full, we thanked our gracious host and had no choice but to immerse ourselves in the sweet. Semolina's particular texture, combined with the strong honey flavor gave this pudgy cake a pleasant mouth feel, however, was a bit dry (perhaps a bit of Arak-the milk of lions-a Middle Eastern distilled alcohol would have done the trick).The last delight arrived in a little black book...our indulgent, multi-course evening set us back only $30.00...tax and all!

After having stopped in only one other time in the last year and a half since we moved to park slope, they still remembered us! Granted we had been in there all the time before we moved (when I say next door, I mean they could lean over the gate and hand me my food while I was in the doorway!)And the food was just as good as I remembered! My favorite is the Green Pitza. I barely ever had to tell them what I was ordering, it was my regular! My husband had the Lentil and Bulgar salad, his favorite, and we shared some Babaganush.

No one at the table with me looked happy with their food. I had a falafal sandwich (which is long and thin, rolled in one of their admittedly fresh pitas) and though the falafal itself was tasty, the sandwich was meh. I'd stick to Heights Falafal one block over.",2.0

After having stopped in only one other time in the last year and a half since we moved to park slope, they still remembered us! Granted we had been in there all the time before we moved (when I say next door, I mean they could lean over the gate and hand me my food while I was in the doorway!)And the food was just as good as I remembered! My favorite is the Green Pitza. I barely ever had to tell them what I was ordering, it was my regular! My husband had the Lentil and Bulgar salad, his favorite, and we shared some Babaganush. I sure do miss going there regularly, but it's a nice treat whenever we're in the area. :)",5.0
"I was there with my friend, and we tried the food, and it was fresh and tasty. It's really fresh. They call it slow food. Everyone likes it. And we will come back to try the rest of the food. And I wish to give them 6 stars. It's healthy food.",5.0
"Dropped by after reading the Yelp reviews on my Iphone...we loved it...sat outside.  Had the 5 salad plate, the falafel plate and some amazing pitta bread...great place and tremendous value...three blocks from the Brooklyn Heights Promenade...great place!",4.0
"Docked two stars for truly bad service. The waiter mixed up an order, forgot about us for long periods of time (there were only two occupied tables in the restaurant), forgot things, and waited over ten minutes to bring us the check once we'd asked for it. Then he waited another ten minutes to come get the cash we left, even though we were trying to get his attention (and again, empty restaurant!)Docked one star because the food was just decent, nothing great. No one at the table with me looked happy with their food. I had a falafal sandwich (which is long and thin, rolled in one of their admittedly fresh pitas) and though the falafal itself was tasty, the sandwich was meh. I'd stick to Heights Falafal one block over.",2.0

"This place was fantastic for the price, and the salads are all awesome.  Unfortunately, the falafel is not as crispy as I'd want it to be, and I actually found it to be a little over-seasoned (or maybe just over garlicky).  The humus, grape leaves, labna, and beet salad are all fantastic.  The babaganoush wasn't as awesome as I was hoping it would be - again, it might have just been that the garlic flavor overpowered the smokey eggplant.  The pita is SO fresh and amazing and warm and fluffy, so I will definitely be returning for the pita and salads...I'd pass on the falafel next time, though.",4.0
"I've never been to their location but get delivery from TC at least once every 2 weeks.  Very affordable, free delivery, good sized portions and awesome food!I'm stuck on the chicken plate and can't seem to get away from it not matter how many times I tell myself to get something else.  The chicken is grilled; tender, juicy and very well seasoned.  You can taste a good amount of garlic as well as many other of Mediterranean spices that are used.  They give you a good amount of chicken for $9.00.  I been wanting to try their baba ganush, but am stuck on their hummus as much as I am with the chicken.  The hummus is creamy with a touch of olive oil....good stuff here.  And it comes with FRESHLY baked pita bread, that, even when delivered is still nice an steamy.  I've also had their falafel, which was also very tasty.  But ordering a side of falafel with the chicken plate seemed to be too much food for me.   Their pitza is supposed to be the hype, but again, I haven't been able to venture past the chicken plate. If you're in the delivery area, TC is legit in my book -- cheap, good and filling.",4.0
"I have been to Tutt Cafe many times now.  It is a little gem hidden in Brooklyn Heights on Hicks St.  Unless you knew it was there, you would never go looking for it on that block.  But, when you stumble across it is worth it to stop and sample the cuisine. The menu is a Mediterranean fare, spinach pies, falafels, salads. and fresh baked pita.  They have a pizza oven where they make the pita bread while you wait.  They also serve pitza.  A pita pizza...  They have various toppings... I really enjoyed the Lambajin pitza... a middle eastern pizza full of lamb, onion, tomato, parsley, and spices... Good stuff..  For dessert they have baklava and basbousa (semolina cake) and great smoothies.The atmosphere is a little dark... but I have seen them have successful parties there. I believe they are cash only also...  But, if you are in the heights this is a great place to check out.",5.0
"Three delicious suggestions:Merguez sandwich --- spicy lamb sausage, lettuce, tomato, onion and little sauce wrapped in a freshly grilled pita.Lamb sandwich --- i wish they had shawarma but this is close.  Tasty grilled leg of lamb, tomato, lettuce, onion and a light spicy  sauce in a freshly grilled pita.Lentil soup -- served with a lemon wedge.  The lemon joice gives a delicious zesty tang to a wonderful vegetarian lentil soup.Great stuff!",4.0

"When I traveled to Egypt in 2001, I was amazed by the complex of tombs and temples in Luxor and delighted by the colorful fish that populated the Red Sea.  The fertility that hugged both banks of the Nile was as thick as a butcher's furrowed brow, but the food that was harvested from that narrow strip of green and swaying palms was bland and mushy.When I returned home I had memories of Picasso fish and still felt the eerie shadow cast by the Colossi of Memnon, but the only memory registered by my palate was the curiosity of fresh dates whose flesh seemed like wooly cotton candy and whose skin was crisp and red as an apple.  Still, I preferred the dry ones.It comes as little surprise that I greeted Tutt Café with a bit of suspicion when my beautiful fiancé mentioned a small, Middle Eastern BYOB not far from her apartment.  The Astroturf and plastic lawn furniture scattered in front of the restaurant did little to allay my fears, and the menu read like a primer for the standard falafel, chicken pita and tabouleh dishes that are ubiquitous at establishments of this ilk.After ticking off foul (Egypt's national dish, a staple made from fava beans and almost any other bean, pulse, lentil or small-dye pasta: but in this case, tossed with tomatoes, parsley, onion and garlic) out of habit, and ordering a bowl of harira soup (a chickpea and lentil stew) I began to take interest in some more unusual salads.A spinach and chickpea salad is more accurately a fried onion and wilted spinach dish that is better than it sounds. Lemon juice livens it and the chickpeas fill it out.  Lentils and bulgar--two of my favorite foods--are as substantial as they sound and, also garnished with fried onions, have a deep caramelized flavor.  I love dolma (grape leaves stuffed with spice-flecked rice) and Tutt's are as serviceable as any you can find, if not outstanding.The menu is a bit heavy on onions, fried or raw, and chickpeas (which also appear in a hummus that is lightened by a prudent portion of tahini).  This could be a criticism, but I remember Egyptian food in much the same way.  Somehow, Tutt manages to makes and remake these staples in ways that are just challenging enough for the palate to refresh itself, rather than surrender to the intense flavors of sumac, zaatar and garlic.  Choosing the selection of five salads (almost larceny at $9) and a cold loomi (citrus) or hibiscus drink will give you a healthy, delicious meal for under $15 (with tip) that would be $25-$30 at a mediocre tapas bar.  And the fresh pita, arriving like a flour-dusted pillow as wide as a steering wheel but, probably, too hot to grab right off, will round out a generous lunch or dinner.The pitas are outstanding.  A bit of water, flour and yogurt rolled out like a pizza crust and cooked on a skillet in a matter of minutes causes passersby to wonder what youthful memory is being conjured.  Was it the first time they smelled fresh bread or waking up and making toast before their parents poured them a bowl of cereal?  This is ""the small, good thing"" Raymond Carver's baker crafted.Other dishes that will surprise and delight are a Green Pizza that reads fairly awful: leaks, scallions, fenugreek and mozzarella.  Mozzarella?  Hardly native to Egypt, this soft, young cheese melt over that green and mild leaks, alarming scallions and grassy fenugreek leaves in one of the city's best kept pizza secrets.  This dish is so good that I abandoned the lambajin (a etymological and culinary relation to the lamajhoon or Armenian pizza which was my favorite childhood treat) after the first and have since ordered a green pizza on each visit.This is not gourmet food, and it is not the type of countrified comfort food that has crept into the Brooklyn culinary milieu.  The dishes are limited, somewhat repetitive but they hit familiar notes in delicious ways.  A leg of lamb pulls apart with a gentle push of a fork and almond-shaped slivers of whole garlic slide out of the crevices in which they were flavorfully imbedded.  The mint mayonnaise is thicker than it would be at a fine, or finer, dining establishment, but on a sandwich it works.The only weakness of Tutt is ironic.  The foul suffers from constant insipidness.  Perhaps it's a hardheaded refusal to use canned tomatoes in winter (cans of San Marzano tomatoes would be amazing) rather than the mealy, pinkish dice currently employed.  Maybe a simple concasse would add some concentration, but as of now the foul suffers.  Just a few blocks from Henry's End or Noodle Pudding and within shouting distance of Jack the Horse Tavern, Tutt Café contributes to a flavorful few blocks of dining out that is as varied as any other part of this burrough.",4.0

Juicy chunks of marinated succulent chicken with delicate spices on top of a crusty pizza base fresh from the oven, too good for words. The iced mint tea was really refeshing as well and the service top notch !  One of the best foodie experiences I've had in New York. They also have shawarma sandwiches for $6.

We got the garlic pita to start and I am not kidding you it was unbelievable. Also had 2 falafel plates with hummus which were equally good. Will definitely be back!!!",4.0
"Tutt is a wonderful little Egyptian cafe on a beautiful tree-lined street in Brooklyn Heights.  The people who work here are friendly and attentive.  The food is cheap and plentiful.  I'm in love with the freshly baked pita bread that always comes straight out of the oven.  I'm also crazy about the beet salad, the pitzas (kind of like a pizza made with pita bread), the homemade soups, the... ok, I really like everything I've tried here, not to mention the fact that the most expensive thing on the menu is a ten dollar leg of lamb plate which leaves me stuffed and content for the rest of the day.   I'm really going to miss Tutt when I move out of Brooklyn Heights next week.",5.0
"One would think that finding great cheap middle eastern food in the nyc area would be a snap.  Well... I haven't found that spot in my hood.  I had to stumble upon this little gem on an autumn walk-about last year.  The prices are right, the food is great and the staff is friendly.  What more does a girl need?  Oh yeah... open one up in my neck of the woods!",4.0
"the pita.... perfect, so warm and fluffy.  nicest guys who work here too.",4.0
"Excellent destination for Mediterranean. Menu is what you'd expect of a Mediterranean place. Food is very good and their bake-to-order pita is to die for, and don't miss out on the Baba ghanoush.Interior is nothing special, a good for casual lunch. Staff is friendly and quick. Very reasonable prices.",4.0
"Handmade pita!!!!! Light, fluffy, and pillowy pita. aah..what a delight.   Why can't every middle eastern restaurant have this? And the spinach cheese pie was perhaps the most delicious food I've ever tasted that did not have some sort of meat product in it. This little place is a gem--a scruffy, not very well polished one--but a gem nevertheless.  Wish I lived closer so I could go back again and again.",5.0
Always good! I usually get the assorted mixed plate--you can choose 5 salads from their selection. Its totally healthy and totally delicious- happy combo.  When Im just in the mood for delicious I go for the merguez sausage.inside decor--average.  Outside during warm weather is better.Its my reliable neighborhood take out spot.,4.0

"I love their PITZAS! I am a big fan of thin crusted pizzas, but the idea of a pizza made with pita crust is quite unusual in comparison and well worth a trek over Brooklyn Bridge for a taste test. These pitzas are 10 inches in diameter & come in 6 or 7 different varieties. The cheese can be mild, but the amount of toppings they offer is plentiful. I usually get mine with mushrooms, artichoke, garlic, & parsley. It is a very light pizza, so a whole pie is enough to feed one person. Also, for $7-$8 a pie...that's quite a bargain!",4.0
"A very quiet and friendly atmosphere. The food was good and reasonably priced, great for lunch. I tried there Chicken plate that came with Pita bread and hummus, which was just delicious. And there pitzas was just splendid. Highly recommend!",4.0
"Tutt Cafe is a hidden gem of fresh and delicious egyptian food hidden amongst brownstones on an entirely residential block. I've tried just about everything on the menu and you really cant go wrong. The choices for an entre are variations on a theme - sandwhiches, platters or pitzas of lamb, chicken, falafel, or vegetables. A pitza is a Pizza made with a pita crust and not necessarily with cheese. A single pitza can be eaten by one person - and thats a big portion. I really cant convey how amazing the pita is here. I lived in Israel for a year, and this is the only pita I've had in New york that compares. It comes out hot and fresh, straight from the large brick ovens. Also make sure to sample the babaganouj which has more flavor then every package of store bought baba you've ever bought COMBINED.My only complaint is that I wish there were specials or more choices on the menu so that I could justify going there more.",5.0
We stumbled upon this place when our two Zagat choices failed us by being closed for lunch.  It was really good middle eastern food.  I got seasoned grilled chicken with hummus and they make fresh pitas there that were soooo good.  The waiter was very friendly and they gave us free cake at the end that was also really good.  Try it!,4.0
"This place has a cool friendly vibe to it.  I ordered the spicy lamb sausage which was rather...err...not attractively presented (looked like a turd on a plate), but boy it was delicious!  Wonderfully spiced, but not overly hot. The hummus and salad on the side were fine.  The plate also came with an outstanding hot pita the was puffed up right out of the oven.  A big miss, IHMO was the garlic pita.  I normally am quite the garlic fan, but the garlic was so raw and overpowering that the pita had a bit of a bitter after taste. If not for the garlic pita, I would have easily given this place another star.  Service was both friendly and efficient.",3.0
"Tutt is a great lunch place. All dishes that I have sampled so far (lambajin, merguez, tabouleh, hummus, chicken plate, leg of lamb) are fresh, light and tasty. The merguez is particularly flavorful but achieves a high mark on the burp-o-meter...",4.0
"Tasty stuff. I am huge fan of their Murguez (sp?) not really sausages (? no casing) but wonderfully spiced little ground lamb treats. Everything here is tasty - as people have said things have a nice tart flavor that really is something special. Good hummus, good pitas. Service in the place is slow and they are cash only so be prepared but its always worth the wait. You can cram a lot of people in here around lunch time.",4.0

"Tried Zaatar pita, and Babaghanjouj.I thought the zaatar pita was pretty solid, sesame seeds gave strong flavor on a very flat pita....The baba ghanouj itself wasn't particularly interesting, but the fresh pita---a very thin pita which is kind of puffy with bubbles---was hot and fantastic. I am definitely going back.ok just went back again.garlic pita is ridic amazing! lemon and garlic on a pita...spinach cheese pie is a puffy delight....my friend had a lamb merguez sandwich is small for the price but good...he said he needed to have a real meal after that....better to order the plate and cough up the cash instead of a sandwich...service is slow....but due to preparation time probably",4.0

"Nice to find a good falafel joint in the neighborhood.  And looks like you could actually have a comfortable meal in their dining room.  Fresh pitas are a very nice touch (although I let one of mine sit for a half-hour and it got very hard).  Doesn't beat Mamoun's in the city or even Oasis in Williamsburg, but it's down the block so I'll be back.",4.0
