"Delicious and very high quality sushi. I would put this place on par with Bond Street Sushi in Manhattan in terms of quality for both the sushi and the fish. What's better is it's not nearly as expensive! The prices are the only thing that are average about this place. They have creative rolls as well as the traditional staples, and really really fresh fish. The staff is extremely friendly (the sushi chefs greet you in Japanese when you walk in) but really the food speaks for itself. It's BYOB, which is just one more positive thing to say about this new Park Slope restaurant. Looking forward to my next time there!",5.0
"Actual rating: 4.5 For a desire of sushi, we decided to go to Sushi Yashin since it had great ratings and was close by to the gardens. The exterior and interior are quite modern and simple. I especially loved how they had the sushi chef's area. The tables area bit small but definitely sturdy. When we got the 3 sushi rolls, our immediate attention was on their California roll. Most of the time, we're used to seeing imitation crab meat but we noticed it looked different. Without much thought, I grabbed it to eat. As I was chewing, I knew it didn't taste like imitation but I couldn't pinpoint a reason. As a person who doesn't eat crab much, it took my boyfriend telling me it was real crab before realization dawned on me. It was absolutely delicious! Their salmon roll was also fresh, rich and fatty. Their eel roll was good as well. But definitely try their salmon and California!Sake oyakodon - my boyfriend loved it. The salmon was very good for the price we paid. He thinks everything was well worth it. And their ikura was really good! It didn't taste fishy, but rich and deep, like the ocean. It paired well with the rice and everything was seasoned well.I had the kashiwa soba. It was seasoned well - not too salty for my taste. The only down side and the reason why I took off 0.5 stars was the fact their in one of my chicken pieces, they had a towel. :(Aside from that, their chefs and wait staff was very kind and their service was great. The waitress greeted us with smiles and was always checking up on us. Would definitely visit again!",4.0
"I only wish this place was closer to me. It's not the most mind-numbingly good sushi you'll ever find, but it is excellent, fresh sushi at affordable prices (which in New York is a rarer breed of restaurant than mind-numbingly good sushi at mind-numbing prices). It seems on certain days, certain cuts of fish are particularly good. The day I went it was the tuna. Personally, I am quite basic with my sushi preferences: salmon is my go-to. And boy, the salmon was sleek, silky, and my friend berated me for calling it ""melt-in-your-mouth"" (because that's really what it was). I was sorely tempted to just order a whole plate of salmon sashimi after my meal.We sat at the bar, which meant we got to see the chef prepare everything. It's a small restaurant that hasn't been open for too long, so not too crowded or noisy. It was actually quite peaceful on a Sunday evening. One of the best things about this place is that it's BYOB, which makes it an even rarer breed of sushi establishment. Hard to find in Manhattan.",5.0
"Don't come here expecting large portions! I ordered a $11 roll and was surprised to see that it was only 5 pieces.. My friend actually finished her roll before I started eating. That being said, it was the best sushi I've ever had. Enough to give it 5 stars even though my wallet says 3.I'll be back once I graduate and can afford to splurge on a normal sized meal here - probably like 5 rolls.",5.0
"MAMA MIA, this is the freshest sushi spot in the hood. Fall apart tender, so fresh and ready in minutes. The spot is cozy and only has a handful of tables. Delivery and pickup is quick and efficient. Bravo!",5.0
"Came here today after seeing the 5 star reviews and I was quite dissapointed.. Maybe my expectations are a little high but sushi katsuei is in the same area and they are amazing so to last long in this area your food had to be up to par. It was empty when I arrived which I didn't mind since I wanted omakase and getting all the focus of the chef should make each piece splendid.. Unfortunately unlike other omakase spots they don't ask you what you don't like.. (I highly dislike horse mackerel and would have preferred to not have it in my omakase)Their prices are not accurate on their website. I saw 8 piece for $25 and 12 piece for $40 so I thought wow that's a steal I have to try... However our 8 piece omakase turned out to be $50 which was definitely not worth it for what we got. Some of the fish tasted extremely fresh and the others not so much.. My favorite was probably the king salmon everything else was nothing to write home about it was actually very lacking especially their ""big eye tuna"" tasted like regular $2 tuna I can get anywhere and I've had amazing big eye tuna before so this was not even close.. Our Uni was supposedly from Santa Barbara which is my favorite type of Uni but i definitely had better.. Their roe however was good and sweet.. All omakase ends with a hand roll but this one didn't.. At least we got a yuzu miso soup? Meh... We Got the black miso cod after seeing pics on Yelp but regretted it after the second bite, it lacked the miso taste and was quite salty. ( if you want amazing miso cod go to zenkichi) I took pics of everything in their menu for future yelpers to see since their Yelp menu is limited and their prices online is inaccurate. I would not come back and not recommend this place for that price.. Go to yasaka in the city where it's super fresh authentic and deliciousness in every bite and it's more affordable or go to katsuei which is a few blocks away.",3.0
Checked out this new spot with my friend and the service and quality of the food were tops. I ordered the sashimi deluxe and my friend ordered two of the maki rolls. Both were prepared with amazingly fresh fish that. Melted in your mouth. I will be back here many times! I'm already dreaming of when I can return!,5.0
"Park slope was in need of a high quality, moderately priced sushi restaurant. Im happy to say Yashin has filled that need. The flavor, quality, and service are always top notch. The regular menu is well rounded and delicious. It's diverse but not overwhelming. I've tried nearly every roll and appetizer and have yet to be disappointed. The shining star of this place however is the constant rotation of specials. The owner proudly showcases his latest find at the market and incorporates it into many of the dishes. I highly recommend getting there early since the word is getting around about how great this place is. Do it!",5.0
"This is by far one of the best Sushi restaurant in Park Slope on 5th Ave!!! I don't write review much but this one is worth to take my time to give those who are in or near Park Slope and wanting some closeness to authentic Japanese style sushi and believe me on this as I am one picky sushi eater! Not only are the sushi amazing, but the service is also just as good quality as the food :)",5.0
"Park slope has its share of sushi spots, but it just got serious with Yashin...Stopped by to try out this new restaurant and it impressed! My usual haunt in the city is with Mitsu @ Sushi Yasuda... So take that as a benchmark for what it's worth when judging the review.The decor was spot on with a modern but cozy feel. As always, requested to sit at the sushi bar with the Chef. Also it's BYOB! We brought a sixer of Asahi to enjoy our dinner.Started with the chef's Devine appetizer, (basically a mini okamase of choice cuts of the day). My favorite part was the ""baby yellow tail"" flown in fresh from Hawaii, lines of omega fat marbled throughout. The Hokkaido hotate (scallop) was crisp and delicious so we couldn't help ourselves so I tried the bacon wrapped bbq hotate appetizer, which was worth it for the bacon alone!Service is very attentive and fast as what I ordered was crafted fresh in front of me. So I tried the recommended Kaisen Don (sashimi, uni & ikura on a bowl of warm sushi rice). Uni a good barometer of how good a sushi place is and it was perfectly silky and flavorful. Welcome to ""The Slope"" Yashin, we'll be coming back for our fix of freshness.",5.0
"Such a bummer about this place.  Given the amazing reviews, I was stoked to have a new sushi spot in the neighborhood.  I went here for lunch and was completely underwhelmed by the service (super slow even with only one other patron there), as well as the food.  The sushi had no flavor, the beef in the lunch special was full of fat and tendons, and the salad was lack luster.  I'm willing to try this spot again, Monday at lunch was not my jam.",3.0

"So disappointing! We placed an order for delivery and more than two hours later, we are still waiting for our food. The delivery man must be lost...wandering the streets of Brooklyn. We stood at the door watching for him. We texted the address and cross streets to his cell phone when he seemed confused about our location. Maybe he does not know how to use GPS? He is not answering his phone. His boss tried calling him, also. No answer. We asked the restaurant to refund our money on our credit card. I just spoke to the credit card company...no refund from the restaurant.Do not trust this restaurant with your credit card. Pay cash...if they show up with your food. But, best advice...stay away from this place.",1.0
"Food = 5/10, it's okay but a short walk away is Katsuei which has this place beat by miles.Service = 3/10, the waitress didn't give me water or tea, then took about 15 minutes to realize I didn't have a menu. She also took my unfinished miso soup without asking.",2.0
"Thought all the five star ratings were suspicious, but now I see this place is the real deal.  We've been there twice in one week, once with kids and once as date night.  It's a cozy place that is both appealing for couples and families.  Uni is fresh and so thankful we finally found a place that has quail egg.  All sushi fresh and prepared in appetizing manner.  BYOB for now, but hope that changes later.  Yaki soba portion size not huge, but it's quality vs quantity.",5.0
"First when I entered the shop, I was given a warm welcome despite the freezing cold outside :) Even though the night was busy for the chefs, making omakase sushi for everybody, they manage to keep up and serve the freshest sushi on demand and with explanations.

Excellent and fresh sushi! +BYOB. Affordable  prices. Staff is very nice and friendly. Absolutely recommend it!,5.0
Tried this new sushi place today and we were amazed by the quality of the fish. We had omakase because we were too lazy to pick from the menu. My husband basically had all different types of fish. This is not something that the neighborhood sushi restaurant can compared. We had high quality sushi but yet a friendly price. Will definitely come back!,5.0
"Tried this new Japanese restaurant with not much to expect because there has not been a good one in the neighborhood in ages.

Friendly and attentive service5. I got complimentary ice cream :pSince i sat at the sushi bar, I was able to chat with the chef-owner. He had moved on from the infamous Sushi Takahachi in Tribeca with 10 years. This is gonna be my goto sushi place in Park Slope from now on!",5.0
"I was in the neighborhood craving sushi for supper. Stop by and tried this little sushi restaurant. Apparently, the place is cozy and surprisingly those friendly chefs used to work at TriBeCa Takahachi. The fishes are undoubtedly fresh, rolls are similar to Takahachi, and price is reasonable.They make modern sushi, less rice with bigger cuts of fish with unique light sauce. I noticed a hint of plum in some sushi.The chef will create off menu sushi as per our request.Overall, it's a great and affordable sushi restaurant in the neighborhood.",5.0

"Tonight my husband and I at at Sushi Yashin. The atmosphere is warm and inviting and the staff is very friendly and accommodating.  The two owners are there preparing fresh sushi and sashimi to order.  I tried the miso soup which was to die for along with a salad plus two California rolls. The rolls actually had real crabmeat instead of the artificial stuff you get at most sushi places. My husband had a spicy tuna roll and avocado roll. We also sampled a few pieces of sushi such as yellow tail tuna with a house made jalapeño sauce, a tuna with cilantro sauce, again house made and a salmon. Everything was so fresh and delicious. As full as we were, we just kept eating until nothing was left. I think I even ate all the ginger and wasabi. I highly recommend Sushi Yashin. If I could give more than 5 stars I would.

"Guys whatever you do, don't order delivery and don't order lunch special. We paid $28 with tax and tip for the saddest pair of faux bento boxes ever. No rice. No veg. A literal TABLESPOON of seaweed as the ""chef's choice"" side dish. Did I mention no rice? No ginger. No nothing. And then that fake nonsense where they fill in with salad, but it's just some leaves. The salmon was very delicious, I'll give them that, but the piece was tiny. We are two ladies, not big eaters, and we were starving after this. We called to argue that it's not a bento box, just a piece of salmon, but the manager just wouldn't admit it and kept saying ""but it's cheaper!"" Yes, it should be cheap because you'll have to buy a huge sandwich after. Also delivery took an hour and a half.",2.0
This is a really good restaurant! The fish is super fresh and the presentation is beautiful. The flavors are excellent -- high quality dishes. It's better than Taro and nearly on par with Sushi Katseui. There is a lot of mediocre sushi in Park Slope so this is a very welcome newcomer.,5.0
