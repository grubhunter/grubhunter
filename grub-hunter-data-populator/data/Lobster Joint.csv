"If you love lobster this is the place to go. Lobster is my favorite food ever and this place certainly lives up to its name. The outdoor area is awesome but if it's cold I recommend sitting up at the bar. On my most recent visit I tried the Lobster mac and cheese and it was fantastic. The portion was so large I brought home half (and it was still delicious as left overs). It is covered in lobster and I even found some full claws! My second favorite meal are the lobster rolls. They are stuffed with lobster meat in both the New England and Connecticut rolls. The Connecticut is a little too buttery for me but still delicious, I prefer the New England. Highly recommended this spot for a casual date night. Can't wait to go back for brunch!",5.0
"N.E. Lobster Roll: Dry, not fresh, unplump, no seasoning, unbuttered...Never again. Pickle: Bland, unseasoned Fishyness. French fries: Hot, fresh, albeit out of the frozen bag that was sitting on the prep table, but what-evz! I came for Lobster.Service: Fantastic! Too many other FRESHer Lobster joints",2.0
"Came here a while back with my best friend and I have to say that this place is nicely tucked away and has a great vibe in itself. However, that said, I found it quite difficult to get to the location considering I don't live in the area -- we had to take the train & the bus afterwards into the residential area.I got the Connecticut roll since I dislike mayo and it was a decent portion along with the fries. The both of us weren't able to finish the fries; and in terms of pricing it's pretty similar to any other lobster place like Luke's or Lobster & Burger. Of all the places though, they probably gave the most lobster in the actual roll.All in all it was a pretty good place if you live around the area and crave lobster; I probably just wouldn't come from the other side of Brooklyn again for it.",4.0
"We've been meaning to try out this place for a long time, then we were meaning to write a review for this place for a long time, both were delayed and pushed back, for a long time.  But, here it is!This place has been on our radar for a while, but due to its location away from the city and far from public transportation, it's a little bit harder to get to.  Also, we almost never go to this part of Queens.  But when we did go on a Saturday, we realized how easy it would've been to come here, and easy street parking.We got to ordering the onion rings and Connecticut lobster roll with fries instead of chips.  The roll comes loaded with lobster, as expected, along with fries and some slaw.  First impression was delicious lobster, great!  Then a few minutes later, as the lobster high goes away, we realized the flavor wasn't much.  The sandwich was basically lobster and bread, the butter didn't really appeal to us and the bread seemed plain.  Next time, we'll try another sandwich and see how that goes.",3.0
"My love for lobster knows no bounds. It doesn't matter if it's broiled, baked, in a soup, stuffed in a sandwich, part of a salad, I'd happily eat it in any form. My lobster-loving palate has been realized at Lobster Joint, a BK spot that does all the above and more.Like anything in the seafood realm, most of the food is going to be pricey. Sandwiches range from $17-20 and the dinner plates are $22-40. At these prices, it's hard to believe lobsters were once seen as cheap, sea bottom feeders. Those days sound wonderful.Speaking of wonderful, how about that lobster mac and cheese ($17)? Tender chunks of lobster buried in a gooey shell of white cheddar in pasta shells never tasted so good. Baked to perfection with copious amounts of cheesy goodness means this is one of their more popular choices. In fact, it gets gobbled up first whenever I'm here in a group.The trio of lobster rolls -- New England ($17), Connecticut ($17), and Lobster Club ($19) -- are all tasty in their own right. There is just enough herb mayo for the New England and Lobster Club, while the CT roll is quite lovely with melted butter. The Lobster Club with the added bacon and avocado is the overall winner.If you're into a more traditional approach to lobster, shoot for the Lobster Dinner ($36) which comes with a 1.5 Ib lobster, red potatoes, corn on the cob and coleslaw. For the more atypical and unqiue takes I recommend the Lobster Shepherds Pie ($21) and the Lobster Corn Chowder ($9). There are other standouts that are completely non-lobster, such as the Mahi Mahi Sammy and the delicious Crabcakes ($21). And of course, don't forget about the 3 sides for $12 deal, one could just fill up exclusively on those.During good weather months, this place is always packed. I visit every so often to get my lobster indulgence on, but I tend to avoid this place like the plague during brunch. The wait staff is always rushing folks out and the waits get pretty crazy at times. But if you're willing to brave the lines, just remember to shoot for happy hour. It's the only time I'm ever there anymore.",4.0
"I'll start this review by saying that it's definitely worth it!  If you like lobster and you want to to enjoy it in an easy setting without the downtown or steakhouse pretentiousness then this is a great place to check out.  I found myself in Greenpoint for an art exhibit and jumped on yelp to find a new place to check out and how can you pass up a spot called ""Lobster Joint.""  I had no real expectations.I pursued the menu knowing that I was most likely going to have lobster but there is numerous other seafood staples and soups that I'll likely go back to try.  I was skeptical at the price to amount of lobster ratio that I'd receive. Most places skimp on the lobster portions. I ordered the basic lobster roll.  I received my lobster roll and was slightly underwhelmed at first glance. I was expecting a nice French baguette but it was a simple toasted bread.  However, upon closer inspection, it was literally loaded down with lobster meat.  It was very fresh and warm with melted butter sauce to make it complete.  The taste was great.  I got the side of fries which were crispy and also very good.My companion ordered the lobster club roll. This iteration included avocado (everybody else's favorite) and bacon (my favorite ingredient)!  This was also served on the same basic toasted bread but without the butter sauce and cold as a club sandwich would come. I have to say that bacon and lobster are meat to be wrapped tightly together, however, I still prefer my basic lobster roll just a little more.  For her meal, she took the house chips which were your basic good enough ""in house chips.""All in all this is a great place to wash down some very tasty lobster with a nice selection of craft (or otherwise) beers. Sit in the front window and watch the people pass by or take it to the back patio with your friends and enjoy the atmosphere as though you were in your own overtly expensive Brooklyn backyard.",4.0
"On last Friday of Lent, we made the walk up to the northern reaches of Greenpoint from Williamsburg to get our fill of fish as tried to be good Catholics and avoid meat. We were not disappointed. Sure, the prices are high given that this is a place where you order at the counter and get a number, but it's worth it for the quality of the food that you are served. I got the Salmon Sandwich with fries, and the Rye Collins. The sandwich was delicious and the fries were the perfect level of crispy ( I couldn't stop eating them...). The drink though...the lime was a little overpowering. I really didn't taste any rye at all. It tasted a bit like I was drinking super concentrated lemon-lime Gatorade. I would return for the food, but stick to beer next time I got.",3.0

"I can't say enough good things about Lobster Joint. My go-to place for Taco Tuesday, their fish tacos are hands down my favorite in NYC. Also top on my list for brunch... Can't go wrong with their Bloody Mary (lobster claw, HELLO!), it's so flavorful. The menu is stellar, they have something for everyone. Their lobster rolls knock it out of the park (or should I say water), by far the freshest I've tasted in a long time. I've tried about everything on the menu and can't complain about one thing. Even the sides are worth the trip! Cute and clean atmosphere and such a friendly staff- all around awesome vibes!!",5.0

"When I walked in Saturday afternoon I thought something was amiss because I was meeting a large party for brunch and I was 2 hours late - but the place was pretty much empty. Then I realized past the main room, kitchen, and bathrooms is a large outdoor area (covered by a tent, with pretty lights strategically strung around it, at the moment to keep the heat in). There is a lot of space out there and about 30 people from the brunch party were gathered around long wooden tables chatting and eating.I ordered the sauteed pollock and asparagus and it was delicioso. The pollock was breaded and looked small when the server brought my plate out to me, but was quite filling. I liked the vinaigrette that was used on the asparagus as well.According to the people around me the lobster roll was good and so was the chowder (which came in a small bowl - so it's better to get if you are not all that hungry).We were not rushed and we pretty much had the back yard all to ourselves, so I would say this is a good spot for group meetups and things of that nature. Many of the items on the menu are expensive (because, seafood), but at least you will enjoy your meal.",4.0
"My last meal on earth would be lobster followed by smores... After I ate at the lobster joint I was almost positive that I could pass to the other side and feel absolutely accomplished in life and ready to go!From the service, to the price point, to the food... This place was just perfection! We entered on an uneventful Sunday evening and this place just made our night spectacular! We got an order of mussels to share, and a few orders of different oysters. They were both so fresh I could still taste the ocean. The lobster rolls were buttery, sweet and juicy! Everything a lobster roll should be! The roll came with crispy fries and a pickle the perfect accompaniment. I usually never finish my food this was one of those rare times where everything on the plate was obliterated!!! I would happily ruin my diet every single day of the week, for one of the lobster rolls here! I can't wait to go back and have another... And another....!",5.0
Not what it used to be! Came here on a Friday night in March. The place raised the prices on lobster roll which could make sense depending on the supply of lobsters. But the food was subpar.

"Got brunch here a couple of months ago. We each got a Bloody Mary which was great. The mix was spicy and they top it off with a meaty lobster claw. I got a lobster roll with fries which were very well done and crispy. The roll had a good amount of big meat chunks and not too much mayo to over power the taste. Coleslaw was cool, light and crunchy. Just how I like itMy boyfriend got the lobster blt and loved it. The bacon crispy, avocado ripe and all the flavors combined were delicious",5.0
"Good lobster roll. Pricing is pretty standard and decent value based on the amount of lobster you get. Overall I really enjoyed it. It was fresh and refreshing and not overly heavy.

So fresh and just the right amount, the salad that comes with it is perfectly paired and portioned. Also had the calm chowder and it is heavenly-- just the right amount of creamy. There is not waitress so you order are the bar and take a number which is great-- I like this type of serves some times because you aren't always being interrupted-- would you like something else; would you need a refill.. if you want something you go and get it yourself.",4.0

The mac and cheese while teeny, was tasty and cheesy (I did have to add a little salt to it)The not so good: our lobster roll didn't have nice big chunks of lobster meat, making it worse, the lobster seemed a little overcooked- a tad dry.

I'd go during a happy hour or for something on special for sure. And definitely for one of those Bloody Marys!",4.0
"Awesome place for brunch, lunch, and dinner. Makes for great food and drinks too. They are very seafood oriented as their name suggest. But this translate into their drinks as well. This is our 5-6th 100th time coming? Don't remember. But this time was brunch and they have a $21 pre fixe that comes with coffee and a choice of mimosa or Bloody Mary. Hint. Get the Bloody Mary. It has a lobster claw in it for god sakes. One of the best bloody Mary's I've had for brunch in a long time. Food is on point, lobster Benedict, lobster rancheros, crab and asp omelette and mushroom frittata. All good. The beers here are reasonably priced at $6 per pint. Although I preferred the lower east side location,(closed down though.) the green point one is also worth checking out. All in all. Great place for good priced food and drinks.",5.0
"I was happy to find a popular Brooklyn spot without overwhelming wait times. Cool interior- great for a chill afternoon with friends, very relaxed atmosphere but definitely go for the backyard with wooden tables and benches.As concerns the food, we ordered the warm lobster roll ( Connecticut style) with side salad and side of mac n cheese. The good: service was quick, nice presentation- a massive salad portion. The mac and cheese while teeny, was tasty and cheesy (I did have to add a little salt to it)The not so good: our lobster roll didn't have nice big chunks of lobster meat, making it worse, the lobster seemed a little overcooked- a tad dry. All in all, might give it one more try- but for now it's pretty average, there's better lobster joints in Brooklyn.",3.0
"This is a solid address to eat lobster!! I went yesterday with a friend a ordered 8 oysters and 1 steamed lobster. Oysters were really tasty and the lobster was amazingly good!! The only wrong thing about this dinner is that the order wasn't properly made and we had to wait 40 min for the lobster. It was ok because as a really good customer service they offered us 6 other oysters, a glass of white wine and an ice cream cookie to share. I will come back for sure in august with my best friend :) thank you lobster joint team!",4.0

"After a long Labor Day at the beach I decided that a lobster roll would be the appropriate summer closer.  Since I was dropping someone off in the area I headed to The Lobster Joint.  Lobster Joint is a no frills, beer on tap and partial self service joint, which works for me.  I will give a rundown of the order via the good and the not so good.The Good:The Connecticut Lobster x2 was almost as good as a CT roll.The Crispy Oysters aka Fried Oysters were solid.The Fried Clam strips were decent.  Not the best strips, but they hold up.The Not so Good:You can run up a tab here really quick.  Note* I also had 2 beers while I was waiting for my order, which added to the bottom-line.",4.0
"I had the Connecticut Lobster Roll. It's basically just lobster, butter, and bread. Which was fine With me! It was delicious. Could've been a little less greAsy, though. It definitely felt like a heavy, rich treat. The French fries were amazing, we couldn't not finish them. I saw their brunch menu on the wall and it looked even better than the regular menu! You may want to try brunch here.Also, we saw their bloody Mary's. They looked amazing! All decked out. Had a huge hunk of lobster meat hanging off the side. Service was great. Both the cashier and the bartender were hilarious. It did take about 20-30 minutes to get my food, though.Would I come back? Probably. I'll try brunch sometime!",4.0

"My husband brought me here for dinner tonite. We parked right infront and I spotted ""Happy hour $1 oysters"" on the sign outside the door, and immediately fell in love. They have many choices for happy hour; $4 sliders and draught beer. The chicks behind the counter are not that friendly. She didn't finish the previous transaction before starting to take our order. The bartender chick was kinda rude. We ordered a dozen oysters, clam strips, 2 each of fried oyster, crabcake, and lobster sliders, New England lobster roll w/fries, Lobster Ale,and Mermaid Pilsner. Food came out in less than 10 minutes, as they are ready. The oysters we got were smaller than average, but can't really complain for $1. They came with the typical sauces. My husband wanted horseradish which didn't come with, so we asked. He didn't like it. I was happy with cocktail sauce and lemon. Oysters were fresh. Wish I could've had room for more. Clam strips were nice and crispy, came with a great sauce. However, too much batter, not enough clams. It was almost like the tiny ends on a calamari tentacle. Not used to clam strips like that. Always had meaty clam strips. Same story with the fried oyster in the slider. It was like a batter sandwich. Crabcake slider was ok. Lobster slider was the best. It was like a mini lobster roll. My husband's lobster roll was good. Same lobster on the slider. Fries were good. Beers were good too. To sum up, I love the vibe. Felt like I was on vacation in New England. Next time I come I will stay away from the fried seafood. The servers were very nice. Much friendlier than the chicks at the bar and register.",4.0
"Okay, just came from here like a couple of hours ago Saturday night (8-15-2015) for the first time and I must say that the food here is good. I ordered the Lobster Club Roll and the fried Clam Strips and both were really good. If I had to choose though, I would say that the Clam Strips edged out the Lobster Club Roll a bit. The Clam Strips were just so damn good! The strips were fried perfectly, had the right amount of salt, and the right batter giving it that perfect taste. I got my orders to go but they actually gave me the Clam strips first as a sit in order so while they went to check on my Lobster Club and other orders, I got the chance to eat some before they got a take home container for it. Lol when the guy came back, I almost couldn't stop eating them, and could have finished them right there but didn't. Lol the guy even asked "" you want them to go"", I laughed and said ""Yeah"" and then he almost laughed before taking them away. When I got home I got the chance to taste the Lobster Roll but continued to eat the Clam strips until I finished them and then came the Lobster. The Lobster Roll wasn't so flavorful in my opinion but was good. The meat tasted good but didn't have the fresh ocean taste like I read someone said it had in their review. I was looking for that but didn't get it but that was okay. The meat was tender and cooked well. There was a sauce used on it that I am not sure of that could use some improvement or otherwise you have a top notch meal. The bacon used for this was pretty good, and was a nice combination with the Lobster. I wonder if they used Nueske's Bacon. As a side along with this, I chose Fries and they have good fries, I was surprised. Usually in joints like this, if you order fries, they usually don't have too much taste, lack of salt and are too damn soft. I would recommend these to fry lovers. Usually I am a pretty harsh critic but on a scale from 1-10, I would give the Lobster Joint a 8.  I will definitely be heading back here some time to try something else either with someone or by myself again.",4.0

The normal lobster roll will run you about $17 and is a large portion. You have a choice of homemade potato chips or a salad,a pickle and a small cup of cole slaw. The $1 oysters during happy hour are the way to go! We got thirty on our last trip! The sliders are also amazing. Choices or crab cake, lobster or fried oyster.

"This is my preferred place in the city when I am in the mood for a lobster roll. Nothing like hopping on the ferry during the summer and a nice quiet stroll through Greenpoint.Location: Stinks that the Manhattan location is closed, but with a car or ferry Greenpoint is accessible.Ambiance: Stools and tables inside and outside area for dinning as well. There is a TV usually playing sports by the bar. Great overall feeling.Service: Great service, bartenders helpful and friendly. Staff brings out food fairly quickly.Food: I have had the heuvos rancheros with lobster. Very tasty, although the pico de gallo didn't taste the freshest when I had it. The lobster given was a good amount. The lobster rolls here are great, tasty and packed with a good portion of lobster. I prefer the simple Connecticut of lobster and butter.Highly recommend!",5.0

"I have found my favorite spot for lobster, hands down. New England lobster roll, Connecticut lobster roll, chowder, a plethora of other scrumptious seafood options, these alone are enough to make me like Lobster Joint. The winning factor though?  A heated outdoor patio. I repeat, A HEATED OUTDOOR PATIO. I was baffled to find no one else was seated out there because it is beyond awesome. It's warm outdoor seating, as if you were enjoying your lobster on a fine spring day.  The lobster was cooked to perfection, and they didn't skimp on the portion.  Is it pricey?  Yes. But it's lobster, it's supposed to cost you more than the average meal.  The New England clam chowder was good in terms of flavor, but personally I prefer a thicker, creamy chowder. That's my preference though. All in all, great seafood selection, great execution, and amazing seating.",5.0
"Went for Happy Hour, and happy we were. My friend and I sat at the bar and had a dozen oysters at $1 a piece (great). Then we ordered the sliders at $4 each: lobster, crab cake and fried oyster. They were served on a sweet bun (maybe Hawaiian?) and filled nicely, but pretty small.  So six sliders really adds up for what it turns out to be. Ok, I needed more oysters so we ordered another 10. Hey, for a buck a piece why no??? And we may have ordered a New England lobster roll....and cocktails.  Fuck it, I'm on vacation.  I forgot to mention: if you're a fan of spice, ask for horseradish and put a little on an oyster and a couple of drops of Tabasco. Don't forget the squeeze fresh lemon juice on them before anything else.  My mouth is watering again. Our bartender was nice, too. And he was wearing a Sriracha tshirt.",4.0
"First impressions of Lobster Joint - low key, casual and friendly atmosphere. Some may even say it's kinda cozy and even romantic in the evening. The air is filled with low lighting that radiates a slowness, almost as if time stands still, combined with relaxing maritime decor. While the menu is displayed in the back board, it clearly shows a good variety of seafood selections. All was good until I tried the food. It was my first time so I decided to go for the lobster roll. What a disappointment! The lobster roll only had claw and knuckle meat, plus it was not freshly made. It tasted like the meat had already been prepared and out for some time. Maybe next time I'll try something else on the menu and have better luck.",3.0
"Lobster Joint, you are so cute and delicious. Came here on an unpretentious Thursday night, missing Happy Hour by 2 minutes. The hostess graciously extended it to us, which was really nice of her! $4 Lobster Ales, $1 oysters. mmmm beerMy date had a lobster roll and I went for the crab cake sandwich. Both delicious, fresh and heavenly. My crab cake was so fresh, it was literally falling apart. Will return on the weekend for one of their glorious clawed up Bloody Marys.",4.0

Perfect for brunch, lunch and dinner.",5.0
"Though I rarely leave a review this one well deserved it. A) had it not been for the lighter decor this place can pass for a local watering hole. Tables are sticky and no one seems to care. Even the bartender. B) you order the lobster Mac and patiently wait. You wait so long that your server sits down to eat her food. Fine the place was very quiet and she was hungry. Then you wait. Finally the food arrived 30+ min later as I was ready to leave hungry. C) for lack of better terminology this food is fit for a dog. Under cooked shells, all wet, the lobster (just claws as that was all in the Mac) taste like sea water. No lobster chunks. Just a messy stew of flakes, raw claws and undercooked Mac. D) upon leaving the well respected or so I thought lobster joint I felt a punch in my stomach. The type of punch which requires an Imodium. Secondly it hasn't been more than 90 minutes and I have already vomited. Yes, asked the uber driver to pull over so I can hang my head out and go. FYI I drank water. The lesson I learned from this ambitious attempt to get lobster from a place called lobster joint was that I don't feel bad for leaving a 11% tip. I feel bad for not leaving after taking a bit. To the server: when you ask how the food is and I shake my head while making a face of disgust then follow up with awful., ask me if there's anything else you can get me instead. Or problem solve. Had that happened, I would probably try something more edible than $17 Mac and you would have gotten a 50% tip. Waste of money, time this meal was and I still feel sick. #lobsterjointgreenpoint",1.0
"Love love this place! The best lobster rolls in NYC! Great lobster to bread ratio. Lobster rolls are a little smaller than a 6inch sub, but thats okay but they have a great menu selection and lots of yummy food to try! The french fries are good, too. We come here all the time!!",5.0
"This is my preferred place in the city when I am in the mood for a lobster roll. Nothing like hopping on the ferry during the summer and a nice quiet stroll through Greenpoint.Location: Stinks that the Manhattan location is closed, but with a car or ferry Greenpoint is accessible.Ambiance: Stools and tables inside and outside area for dinning as well. There is a TV usually playing sports by the bar. Great overall feeling.Service: Great service, bartenders helpful and friendly. Staff brings out food fairly quickly.Food: I have had the heuvos rancheros with lobster. Very tasty, although the pico de gallo didn't taste the freshest when I had it. The lobster given was a good amount. The lobster rolls here are great, tasty and packed with a good portion of lobster. I prefer the simple Connecticut of lobster and butter.Highly recommend!",5.0
"The food is amazing so it's hard to pick a favorite but if I had a gun to my head and was forced to pick one it would be The Connecticut Lobster Roll . They have a good happy house, and the staff is great. Shout out to Stefania, who always plays the best playlists!",5.0

"I have found my favorite spot for lobster, hands down. New England lobster roll, Connecticut lobster roll, chowder, a plethora of other scrumptious seafood options, these alone are enough to make me like Lobster Joint. The winning factor though?  A heated outdoor patio. I repeat, A HEATED OUTDOOR PATIO. I was baffled to find no one else was seated out there because it is beyond awesome. It's warm outdoor seating, as if you were enjoying your lobster on a fine spring day.  The lobster was cooked to perfection, and they didn't skimp on the portion.  Is it pricey?  Yes. But it's lobster, it's supposed to cost you more than the average meal.  The New England clam chowder was good in terms of flavor, but personally I prefer a thicker, creamy chowder. That's my preference though. All in all, great seafood selection, great execution, and amazing seating.",5.0
"Went for Happy Hour, and happy we were. My friend and I sat at the bar and had a dozen oysters at $1 a piece (great). Then we ordered the sliders at $4 each: lobster, crab cake and fried oyster. They were served on a sweet bun (maybe Hawaiian?) and filled nicely, but pretty small.  So six sliders really adds up for what it turns out to be. Ok, I needed more oysters so we ordered another 10. Hey, for a buck a piece why no??? And we may have ordered a New England lobster roll....and cocktails.  Fuck it, I'm on vacation.  I forgot to mention: if you're a fan of spice, ask for horseradish and put a little on an oyster and a couple of drops of Tabasco. Don't forget the squeeze fresh lemon juice on them before anything else.  My mouth is watering again. Our bartender was nice, too. And he was wearing a Sriracha tshirt.",4.0
"First impressions of Lobster Joint - low key, casual and friendly atmosphere. Some may even say it's kinda cozy and even romantic in the evening. The air is filled with low lighting that radiates a slowness, almost as if time stands still, combined with relaxing maritime decor. While the menu is displayed in the back board, it clearly shows a good variety of seafood selections. All was good until I tried the food. It was my first time so I decided to go for the lobster roll. What a disappointment! The lobster roll only had claw and knuckle meat, plus it was not freshly made. It tasted like the meat had already been prepared and out for some time. Maybe next time I'll try something else on the menu and have better luck.",3.0
"Lobster Joint, you are so cute and delicious. Came here on an unpretentious Thursday night, missing Happy Hour by 2 minutes. The hostess graciously extended it to us, which was really nice of her! $4 Lobster Ales, $1 oysters. mmmm beerMy date had a lobster roll and I went for the crab cake sandwich. Both delicious, fresh and heavenly. My crab cake was so fresh, it was literally falling apart. Will return on the weekend for one of their glorious clawed up Bloody Marys.",4.0
"One of my favorite restaurants in the neighborhood. Always a good to. The fact I can get a lobster roll all year round is just amazing. The have a great backyard that's enclosed and heated during the winter which is awesome. Their bloody marys have a huge lobster claw in them and are to die for. Perfect for brunch, lunch and dinner.",5.0
"Though I rarely leave a review this one well deserved it. A) had it not been for the lighter decor this place can pass for a local watering hole. Tables are sticky and no one seems to care. Even the bartender. B) you order the lobster Mac and patiently wait. You wait so long that your server sits down to eat her food. Fine the place was very quiet and she was hungry. Then you wait. Finally the food arrived 30+ min later as I was ready to leave hungry. C) for lack of better terminology this food is fit for a dog. Under cooked shells, all wet, the lobster (just claws as that was all in the Mac) taste like sea water. No lobster chunks. Just a messy stew of flakes, raw claws and undercooked Mac. D) upon leaving the well respected or so I thought lobster joint I felt a punch in my stomach. The type of punch which requires an Imodium. Secondly it hasn't been more than 90 minutes and I have already vomited. Yes, asked the uber driver to pull over so I can hang my head out and go. FYI I drank water. The lesson I learned from this ambitious attempt to get lobster from a place called lobster joint was that I don't feel bad for leaving a 11% tip. I feel bad for not leaving after taking a bit. To the server: when you ask how the food is and I shake my head while making a face of disgust then follow up with awful., ask me if there's anything else you can get me instead. Or problem solve.

"Decided to have a quick bite to eat, so we stopped by the Lobster Joint as our AirBnB was on the same block. We ordered a lobster roll, which came with fries and a small side of coleslaw. The fries and coleslaw were pretty standard, and the lobster roll was okay. The lobster was all cut up and mixed with mayo. The flavors were okay... I've had better. I would have preferred the lobster meat served whole and not cut up.The restaurant is nice and the staff was friendly, giving us tips on where to go for our nightly adventure we planned for that night. It was pretty quiet the time we went on a Saturday afternoon. It appears that they are more busy during brunch.Overall, it was okay.

"First off let me say that I don't like mayo and I try to avoid it at all costs. But when I read another review saying that it's very light then I figured what's the harm & had to try it out. So down to business - I got the Lobster Club Roll and let me tell you it was so delish. The lobster was really fresh & herb mayo only enhanced the natural sweetness of the lobster. There was no globby mayo attacking a perfect lobster....which is a plus for me. I was happy to see that I had at least 2 huge claws & lots of tail in this lobster roll. Great portion size for this sandwich. Picture posted was after I had taken a few bites of my lobster roll. My fiancée got the traditional New England Lobster Roll and he really enjoyed it but kept giving my lobster roll some serious side eye because it looked like I had more lobster! We also ordered (4) Blue Pointe Raw Oysters. Really fresh and super tasty.I've been to Maine during ""Lobster Fest"" and this was by far one of the best lobster rolls I've ever had. If you're into lobster and want some super fresh lobster roll outside of Maine then this place is great for your fix. You can sub out the traditional roll for Bibb lettuce which is great if you are trying not to carb it out too much. Their raw oysters are on point. The only thing is the price is a little steep but I think it's worth it because portions are well sized and the food is very fresh.  If and when we come back I'd really like to try the Lobster Mac & Cheese.

For happy hour, order all of their sliders. Seriously. I usually have fries for a side but decided to try their onion rings and was happily surprised. The batter to onion ratio was perfect! If you're a sports fan, they do show games at the bar so you can get your sports and seafood fix.

"Wonderful weekday lunch special I'll continue to come in for, but the lobster roll is overpriced, even for an NYC lobster roll. If this lobster roll was beyond compare I might be persuaded to pay $26 again, but the potato chips were too oily/flavorless, and the meat I'd give a B. The lobster roll at nearby Littleneck Outpost has tastier, more tender meat and perfect potato chips...for $18. If I were going to charge $26 for a lobster roll in Greenpoint, I'd seriously step up my game on the quality...or accept that I have to price consistent with market norms for the area. Maybe loyal regulars will pay that, but plenty of more casual customers won't. I'd experiment before committing to this price tag.",3.0

For happy hour, order all of their sliders. Seriously. I usually have fries for a side but decided to try their onion rings and was happily surprised. The batter to onion ratio was perfect! If you're a sports fan, they do show games at the bar so you can get your sports and seafood fix. I appreciate that they don't have a tv in the backyard so you can enjoy it without people (like me) swearing and shouting during one of the soccer matches.",4.0
"Wonderful weekday lunch special I'll continue to come in for, but the lobster roll is overpriced, even for an NYC lobster roll. If this lobster roll was beyond compare I might be persuaded to pay $26 again, but the potato chips were too oily/flavorless, and the meat I'd give a B. The lobster roll at nearby Littleneck Outpost has tastier, more tender meat and perfect potato chips...for $18. If I were going to charge $26 for a lobster roll in Greenpoint, I'd seriously step up my game on the quality...or accept that I have to price consistent with market norms for the area. Maybe loyal regulars will pay that, but plenty of more casual customers won't. I'd experiment before committing to this price tag.",3.0
"Pretty great, it does what it says on the awning. Delicious lobster rolls, as well as a pretty good selection of lunch time options if you're not into paying 16-20 $ for a sandwich and some fries, and I'm a huge fan of their fries. Sliders and chowders are delicious, and the slaw is tasty. Very  rarely full, or insanely busy around lunch time, so it makes a good spot to grab some seafood.",4.0
"Came here with some friends for a late dinner and it was great. Fried oysters plus fish and chips are a great combo before you go out drinking. Minus one star for not having any of the good sounding desserts available. In terms of booze, get the pitcher. Worth it.",4.0
"I really enjoy Lobster Joint. I have only been here during HH but it's a nice stop before wherever I'm going (even if it's home...). $1 Oysters are available - they're not the best shucked oysters I've had, since you could still find some pieces of the shell, but they'll do for me. I tried the oyster shooters - not for me because they're made with Vodka but pretty cheap. Drinks are tasty (enough) to enjoy with the food. What I really liked was the sliders. I had all 3 - lobster, crab, fried oyster - and they were all REALLY good!! So good to wish they weren't just sliders.The spot itself is nice and cozy - I've never had an issue getting a place to sit, but perhaps if you go later there would be. You order and pay first then the waiters bring you your food (who are super friendly) and let you be. Haven't tried the Lobster Claw Bloody Mary yet - looks tasty... but maybe when they add it to the HH menu ;)",4.0
I've been here *two times*. I strongly recommend the shrimp and calamari. They season the shrimp very well and they have a little special sauce that is so delicious!      I loved it backyard it's very peaceful! They put a fan which I really appreciate... and there is stones everywhere...the first time it was perfect...the second time the neighbors next door were doing construction it was very loud.      The actual lobster roll is not my fav. The first time i had it ...it was a lunch special and they put coleslaw on it and I hate coldslaw. I thought that was very odd. But honestly its about preference maybe you like coleslaw. Other than that it's very delicious. Its hard to find really good lobster but this place is worth checking out.,5.0

"Went here while waiting for a St. Vitus show to start. Everything is rather expensive. Ordered the $8 clam chowder and an $8 apple pie.

The taste was light and fine, the portion very small--it was like 1.25-1.5 cups of chowder. The apple pie was good and worth the $8 because you get a full mini sweet/tart pie topped with their special bourbon infused whipped cream. Everything was going okay after the sticker shock until my mouth met a piece of white plastic. At first I thought it was a piece of a lobster's inner skeleton, but it was too thick and opaque, definitely a piece of plastic. I have to say this is really disgusting. In school we were told to avoid working with burning plastics due to it being carcinogenic. Trying to hold back my stomach from having eaten food tainted with heated plastic, I informed staff of this foreign object. The person asked if I wanted another pie. After declining that offer, he refunded my money. I felt guilty that they lost $8 + tax even though this was their fault, so just to be nice, I gave them a second tip. I know, I know, they really don't deserve it and I should never be pressured to tip more than once!What is up with all these places leaving pieces of plastic in the food? That's just gross.

"Awesome first time in Greenpoint last night! Having never been, I felt like we were in another country- probably Amsterdam with all the tulips, thick frame glasses, and ubiquitous smell of weed. Paulie Gee's had a 2 hour wait at 8:40 so we ventured over here. Glad we did because I'm not sure I could have lasted that long! I had the New England Lobster Roll and it was excellent- very buttery with thick pieces of meat. The outdoor heated garden in the back had a fun, laid-back vibe. I would definitely come back and pick up some Mother's Day cards at WORD (adorable hipster bookstore) on the way.",4.0

"My husband and I are big fans of great seafood and for that reason we trek all the way from south brooklyn to greenpoint to enjoy Lobster Joint. I love lobster but I'm not a fan of mayo -- the Connecticut lobster roll is perfect. Tons of lobster claw meat tossed in perfectly warm butter is to die for. My husband always has at least a half dozen oysters, the black duck oysters being his latest favorite. We've also tried the calamari, popcorn shrimp and mussels -- all of which is amazing enough to keep you coming back. Great bar selections (I especially recommend the rye Collins) and attentive, friendly staff.  Go hungry as you'll probably end up trying many menu items since it's so hard to choose!",5.0

"I originally came in to pick up my takeout order, however I found the feng shui enticing enough to stay and eat in. The entire front of the restaurant was open and meshed well with the rainy/cloudy day. Of course as soon as I ate my perfectly seasoned and goldened fries the restaurant's set up became irrelevant. I devoured the fried delicacies within minutes and then I transitioned to the Connecticut Lobster Roll which arguably was the best roll of my lifetime. All of this was accompanied by good conversation with the bartender. All in all, I had a damn good meal this past Sunday evening.",5.0
"I have been here a couple of times and for some reason this is my first review...but each time was very very good and deLish!!!When you walk in its kinda of set up like the old school fish markets, where you place your order first then go sit somewhere.  They will bring your food to you hot and fresh.  I like this because its seems you get your food faster, then wanting for a waitress.  However, it seems very challenging to other people so prepare yourself...to order first and the menu is ont he wall people just look up:)I came for brunch again and I will say I am a freak for a good bloody mary.  However, this place went a little over the top by putting a fresh lobster claw as a delicious edible garnish!!! A+ for that and it was tastey.  I had the Lobster ranchero and I must say it was fresh, flavorful and filling.  Everytime I go I wish I lived closer so I could get it more often:)Also had the lobster roll and mac+cheese both were good but I could have used more lobster in my roll other than that it was still tastey.FYI --- if the weather is warm go seat out back its nice and there is a lot more seating back there!!",5.0
This review is for happy hour only. The HH had 1 dollar oysters which are quite tasty and I am not a big oyster fan. The HH beer prices are 4 bucks for Allagash ( one of my favorite) The sliders are pretty danty but they are tasty. I also tried the seafood bisque which was very yummy but it is not part of the happy hour. If you are looking for a Happy Hour look no further.,5.0
"Whoah, 5 star review. And honest to Allah, I don't even like lobster. I don't.Crab cakes, so good. Crispy oysters (ok you can't really mess them up, but yeaaah..) they were great. I took my famously picky, food-frustrating mother here, which is the truest test that most restaurants are not even ready for. And yes, she complained about the bun-bread. ""Are you sure you can't dig up some ciabatta? I would LOVE that on a pita."" No mom, sorry. All burger bun, all the time, everything. So she gets some fish sandwich, I don't remember and she likes it, she really does. And the fries are perfectly crispy and the cole slaw is of complementary seasoning, with not-too-much mayo.So I've dined-in here pretty often. Drank-in even more often (Shipyard Pumpkin all day). But I was only truly amazed when Lobster Joint really DELIVERED on a delivery order. It was the blackened Mahi sandwich, I remember it well. I remember ordering it later into the evening, second-guessing my choice of a fish fillet for delivery. Everything that can go wrong often does during a food delivery. But no. My sandwich arrived and it was the best fish sandwich I've ever had. The little cup of tartar was just enough. The fries, still crisp despite the commute. The Mahi melted into the burger bun when I bore down and it was everything. I'm still confused. It left me disoriented, as if a mere whisper of a dream, and I had to believe that the round tin and plastic (all that was left) was proof enough that it happened.",5.0
Amazing Connecticut lobster roll and fries we're mouth watering. I'll see yall at rockaway next!,5.0
"Awesome first time in Greenpoint last night! Having never been, I felt like we were in another country- probably Amsterdam with all the tulips, thick frame glasses, and ubiquitous smell of weed. Paulie Gee's had a 2 hour wait at 8:40 so we ventured over here. Glad we did because I'm not sure I could have lasted that long! I had the New England Lobster Roll and it was excellent- very buttery with thick pieces of meat. The outdoor heated garden in the back had a fun, laid-back vibe. I would definitely come back and pick up some Mother's Day cards at WORD (adorable hipster bookstore) on the way.",4.0
Awesome happy hour specials on sliders & cocktails every weekday 4-7. Sliders served on top a bed of light coleslaw.  Mmm...coleslaw!Must come back for the blood mary served witha lobster claw for Saturday/Sunday brunch!Cute port hole in bathroom.,4.0
"My husband and I are big fans of great seafood and for that reason we trek all the way from south brooklyn to greenpoint to enjoy Lobster Joint. I love lobster but I'm not a fan of mayo -- the Connecticut lobster roll is perfect. Tons of lobster claw meat tossed in perfectly warm butter is to die for. My husband always has at least a half dozen oysters, the black duck oysters being his latest favorite. We've also tried the calamari, popcorn shrimp and mussels -- all of which is amazing enough to keep you coming back. Great bar selections (I especially recommend the rye Collins) and attentive, friendly staff.  Go hungry as you'll probably end up trying many menu items since it's so hard to choose!",5.0
"Great place. It's in greenpoint kind of no where. But food is great. Hate the lines they are awful,but worth wait",5.0
Great casual atmosphere with reasonably quick service. Got the bacon and lentil soup--surprisingly great combo! Alongside had 2 sliders--lobster roll and crab cake. Pretty damn good. Fantastic quality seafood.,4.0
"I originally came in to pick up my takeout order, however I found the feng shui enticing enough to stay and eat in. The entire front of the restaurant was open and meshed well with the rainy/cloudy day. Of course as soon as I ate my perfectly seasoned and goldened fries the restaurant's set up became irrelevant. I devoured the fried delicacies within minutes and then I transitioned to the Connecticut Lobster Roll which arguably was the best roll of my lifetime. All of this was accompanied by good conversation with the bartender. All in all, I had a damn good meal this past Sunday evening.",5.0
"I have been here a couple of times and for some reason this is my first review...but each time was very very good and deLish!!!When you walk in its kinda of set up like the old school fish markets, where you place your order first then go sit somewhere.  They will bring your food to you hot and fresh.  I like this because its seems you get your food faster, then wanting for a waitress.  However, it seems very challenging to other people so prepare yourself...to order first and the menu is ont he wall people just look up:)I came for brunch again and I will say I am a freak for a good bloody mary.  However, this place went a little over the top by putting a fresh lobster claw as a delicious edible garnish!!! A+ for that and it was tastey.  I had the Lobster ranchero and I must say it was fresh, flavorful and filling.  Everytime I go I wish I lived closer so I could get it more often:)Also had the lobster roll and mac+cheese both were good but I could have used more lobster in my roll other than that it was still tastey.FYI --- if the weather is warm go seat out back its nice and there is a lot more seating back there!!",5.0

"This place is adorable, and we heard afterwards that there is a pretty sweet backyard area for dining as well. However, the front area of the restaurant was already quite charming and fit their seaside theme, without being too kitschy.We had two orders of the Connecticut lobster roll, based off of Yelp reviews and photos of the very generous portions. However, I have to say it was only OK. It was definitely generous, both the bun itself and lobster pieces, as well as the side of fries/chips/whatever you choose. The price was also pretty decent compared to other lobster roll places in the city, but not that much cheaper. While impressive looking, the lobster pieces themselves felt a little rubbery - either overcooked, or not as fresh as they ought to be. The Connecticut roll also had a bit too much butter for my liking. The fries and homemade chips, however, were pretty darn good.Would we be back? To be honest, probably not, since it is so far, and we have found other places with better lobster rolls. However, if we were to come back, I would love to try their other types of rolls - perhaps they would be better?",3.0
These guys have no idea what they are doing. Not seafood people at all...Just jumped on the lobster roll trend to try and make a dollar. Not surprised the East Village location closed...The menu is terrible and the service is horrible. Clam strips? Are you serious...Whole belly clams my friends...Not strips. Such a bummer...At the very least take a trip to Maine and study up on the lobster roll. Very sad!,1.0
Oh thank you yelp for helping me find my new spot!! Delicious lobster roll!! The crispy oysters were also perfection. Can't wait to come back! Maybe tomorrow...LOL,5.0
"I had been meaning to make a trek to this joint in the furthest reaches of Greenpoint since reading Ron C.'s excellent review of 6/13 and feasting my eyes on his stunning photographs. Alas, the summer flew by, and I didn't make it here during picnic table-friendly weather to enjoy the quite reasonable brunch deal. Nonetheless, my dinner and bar experiences at the charming Lobster Joint were most enjoyable. The first time I came here, I had to try the famed lobster claw bloody mary, which was skillfully prepared with the freshest ingredients (homemade spicy tomato base, crisp celery, tart lemon and lime wedges, crunchy half sour pickle, and last, but not least, a heaping helping of sweet, plump lobster claw). Despite the elaborate construction involved in this potent potable, it was served quite promptly by bartender extraordinaire, Amanda, who also makes a great Arnold Palmer cocktail and improvises upon set cocktails, tweaking them to each customer's preference, no matter how eccentric.  Amanda is also well versed in the food menu and makes excellent recommendations.  When I came here for dinner, I had a sampling of my friend's lobster corn bisque, which was hearty with a well-seasoned tomato base, sweet corn and fresh basil. I also tried the lobster club roll, which is prepared New England style with a twist, loaded up with heaps of fresh claw meat, thinly sliced celery, a hint of light, homemade herb mayo, a layer of sliced ripe avocado, and two large strips of crispy bacon atop a toasted potato roll. To keep things light, I chose, in lieu of chips or fries, a motley salad composed of mixed greens with tomatoes, shredded carrot, and radish in a lemon vinaigrette. This generously portioned dish, which also includes a pickle and coleslaw, is definitely suitable for sharing (and a much better bang for the buck than its counterpart from the Redhook Lobster Pound Truck).On my second visit, I also had the opportunity to chat with the talented and creative head chef, Justin Ernsberger, a graduate of the French Culinary Institute whose past experience includes stints at Aqua Grill and the Mermaid Inn. I learned that Lobster Joint would be expanding to the Lower East Side shortly and that some additions to the already extensive, enticing menu may be in the works. The friendliness of the staff at every level here really made it a stellar (to the power of 5) experience.",5.0
"Love this place! My husband and I eat at the restaurant and also order delivery. The delivery is always decent. My favorite is the Bibb Salad. I have that no matter what. Then I'll either have a lobster roll, or a crab roll or lobster bisque or clam chowder. The calamari is delicious as well. If you go in on a weekend do yourself a favor and get a Bloody Mary. They make theirs nice and spicy w HUGE lobster claws dangling off the side. Honestly, we never had anything there that we didn't like!On one negative note (sadly), we've been coming here since they first opened the actually restaurant (when Asia (or is it Aja?) still worked there) and lately they've been hiring people who really don't give a crap about you or the service. On Sunday nights they just want you to get out of their faces. They're rude and treat you like they are better than you are but we still keep coming back because we'll outlast the staff...we promise.",5.0
"Not always a fan of huge, really expensive lobster rolls, but I really did enjoy all the food at Lobster Joint. $4 sliders during happy hour are a pretty good deal and you get about a claw full of meat. Oysters are pretty fresh and tasty too, especially for $1 each. Weirdly enough, I've never had drinks here during happy hour, only food. And you know what? I don't regret it one bit.Mahi Mahi Sandwich is a bit salty, but the salmon sandwich is always pretty killer and the prices for each are pretty decent. $12-14 for a seafood sandwich and a big portion of fries? Not too shabby at all. Lobster bisque is pretty good and there are some big chunks of lobster, but I kinda wish they used cream. Seems a bit acidic for my taste, but still decent. Onto the lobster roll. Quality stuff. They definitely load up the lobster and the flavors are pretty well balanced. And again, since it comes with fries, I guess I can forgive the $17 price tag. I can't say I'll always get the lobster roll, especially with all the other good offerings, but definitely one of the more solid lobster rolls in all of New York City. With a name like Lobster Joint, well, you know it better be good.Given that it's in Greenpoint, the crowds aren't as bad, and I feel like the prices are pretty good for a high quality seafood joint. This is definitely a place to check out, no matter which location you hit up. I've actually never been to the LES location even though it's closer to me, but I can say the outlook is good, given the quality and value I got at the Greenpoint location. After comparing menus online, seems like the prices are pretty even, which is another good sign.",4.0
"Stopped in to check out their lobster rolls. I ordered the New England Lobster Roll.  The meats were a lot claw and knuckle and not much tail. Let's be honest, you're not supposed to be full when you go out for a lobster roll and ordering more than one may or may not make you feel like a pig.That said the order did come with fries and cole slaw. The space is cool, friendly and welcoming. The condiments including the ketchup a fancier, premium kind.  Lobsters are expensive and you get what you pay for.  Luke's lobster roll is mostly tail but it's also $20 a pop without the accoutrements plus their better quality lobster meat is a chilled in fridge temperature when it's served which is not as unpleasant as getting food poisoning but still unpleasant.I would definitely be back for happy hour.  Seems like that's where the action is at.",4.0

"There's nothing to say about the Lobster Joint that hasn't been said before.  The staff is incredibly nice, they serve delicious, fresh seafood at reasonable prices, and the interior/outdoor space is perfect for dinner and/or drinks with friends.I really don't think you can go wrong with anything on this menu.  I tried all of their sliders and a couple oysters during their HH - it was so good, I took a lobster roll to go for the next day!Keep it up Lobster Joint, you rock :)",5.0
I got a delivery within the hour. The lobster mac and cheese was amazing. Then to top it off with a cookie ice cream sandwich. I think I may just ordered a couple of those sandwiches to keep in the freezer.,5.0
Love this place. We come here often for early dinner with our young child.The backyard area is big and open. Lots of high chairs available. It's covered so if the weather is fantastic it's not as nice as a real garden but if it's a little rainy or cold then it's great.All dishes I've had are delicious. For kids get the side order of mac n cheese for $5 (or 3 sides for $12 and throw in a veggie and their amazing onion rings!)This place isn't cheap but it's not super expensive either. Great value.,4.0
"Had never been to Greenpoint or taken the G so figured why not? My friend told me about the Lobster Joint so I grabbed a couple of friends and headed over for a casual summer lunch. We sat in the back, which is full of picnic tables and my friend's son ran around as he pleased which was a plus for us since he's got a lot of energy right now!We sat for hours and ate a leisurely pace with no one bothering us. The staff was friendly (you order in the front and they deliver to your table). Had the Lobster Rancheros, which was a first. I love lobster and i also love huevos rancheros. And yes, together they make a lovely match. My friends got the hamburger, salmon and lobster roll, all of which were deemed winners.",4.0
"Good food. Nice folks. But Lobster salad with tax was about $20... Argh, pricey seafood indeed....The thing I don't get is - It has been news that lobster prices have dropped significantly over the last 10 years - to the point where it is not even worth it for many New England lobstermen to go out (price of petrol/expenses just makes it not worth it).  I have family up there, and this is the big story - LOBSTER PRICES ARE DOWN.So my question -  who's going to go up there and fill up a truck with this cheap lobster, bring it back, and offer us some less expensive lobster rolls. $12 would be great!",3.0
"The food here is overall very good and they serve 2 fully respectable (if not quite transcendent) versions of the lobster roll, the original cold mayo laced version more commonly found as well as the rarer Connecticut style served in hot butter.  Didn't enjoy the crab roll quite as much but was certainly decent.  Other specialties I've yet to try include the lobster mac and cheese and traditional steamed lobster dinners.Decor is very nice and really helps give you the summer in New England feeling and the service has always been friendly and quick.What makes this place solidly worthy of 4 stars is the AWESOME happy hour, which immediately became among my personal favorites in the city.  Heres why;-4 dollar seafood sliders like the cold lobster roll type, crab cake and fried oysters-the inclusion of there fantastic mixed drinks like the delicious fresh vodka lemonade, and, the house specialty dark and stormy.  All of the drinks are significantly marked down to 4 bucks a pop. -1 dollar select raw oysters which (actually good varieties offered as opposed to other spots where your likely to find only cheaper and far less tasty southern ones)-all beers 4 bucks (least impressive aspect of the happy hour)in closing, a trip to this place during the hours of 4-7pm on a weekday will make a instant fan for life out of any lover of seafood &/or booze, and surely any decent person is at least one of the two.",4.0

"Have been planning on checking this place out for some time now, had the New England lobster roll and fried oysters, it was pretty good much. Better than other places I have been in NYC, the only thing I did not like about it was the fries they were clearly something frozen that they probably got from Sysco or some other restaurant food supply place, that was the only let down about the place, the staff seemed to be very attentive and friendly.For a $19 lobster roll in NYC I think it is a great deal",4.0

FOOD: Connecticut style Lobster Roll - over, seriously over flowing with chucks of lobster, poached in warm butter and placed in a delicious butter roll.  Comes with fries and slaw.   Lobster club - just as delicious, with Bacon & Avocado!!  The fried oyster roll was also very yummy.  The lobster mac & cheese, I have no words.. just freaking awesomeness..!!!!    Spent $90 lunch - totally worth it... Go early (if you have young ones) - you get the whole place to yourself. Will definitely return for more lobster goodness!",5.0

"Wow. What a great find. Located in Brooklyn.  Locals know it well. A casual dining experience. Walk up to the counter and order. Menu of clams, muscles, numerous types of lobster rolls, lobsters, seafood, salads,etc. Food is ready quickly. Take it to go. Eat inside at tables or go to the backyard and eat at a picnic tables. Service was fast and friendly. Coming from Manhattan, its worth the trip.",5.0

"The lobster joint is one of the most interesting places you can find in the LIC neighborhood.It is really New England feeling pure! The atmosphere is cozy and relaxed, the back patio is a great place to enjoy the last warm days (and especially with our son who can run around without disturbing anybody).

The homemade chips are also noticeable. We can only recommend the Muscadet wine that compliments the food perfectly.

Happy Hour is a must! Can't beat the $4 Lobster Sliders. The $1 oysters were fresh though a bit small. I really enjoyed the cream-less Lobster Corn Bisque on this chilly evening and of course the $4 beer. We also ordered the Lobster Mac N Cheese which was freshly prepared but pretty ordinary. We came early and were able to hold and hear a conversation but as the Happy Hour grew to a close the place was packed and loud. Obviously a popular spot for good reason.,3.0

I found this place as I always find places on YELP of course!!!!I took my hubby out for fathers day dinner but on Friday to avoid the crowds. I ordered the New England Lobster Roll with french fries and he ordered the Fish and french fries. While ordering we wanted to get some beer but not sure what to get the lovely lady taking the order allowed us to have a taste of all 3 or 4 beers on tap. We liked the Mermaid one the best. Once our food came out it was soooooooooooo good looking i had to take a pic. It was even more tasty then it looked! I got my friends on instagram to quickly ask about this place just by a picture alone. They also ended up going the same weekend for brunch! We sat in the front facing out of the door/windows. What a beautiful night a little too chilly for me to be in their huge back yard but when I went to take a glimpse of it the back yard was packed with people! WE ARE DEFINITELY GOING BACK!!!

"They really deserve five stars but it came down one star after last night. My roomie and I dined here last night. We were both really hungry and ordered with our eyes like usual. We had delicious fried oysters on a shell with a bed of cole slaw. We also tried the fried calamari with homemade marinara. I liked it a lot but the sauce was missing an ingredient I couldn't quiet point out.I ordered a New England clam chowder which was creamy and not too rich which I enjoyed. She ordered the Lobster Mac and Cheese. She only enjoyed the lobster from it, but the mac and cheese part had a little too much flour to cheese ratio so it made it really sticky and not pleasant.I should have stopped after all that food but I had to try their famous Connecticut style lobster rolls. The bartender or kitchen  brought over the New England which I would have and should have gladly devoured. Ended up waiting 20 mins for them to boil a new lobster and by the time I received it, it tasted rubbery like they boiled it too long. The salad on the side tasted fishy. I really didn't want to complain or make them fix my order again so I just ate it. Kinda felt ill after I did that. Even if it was cooked properly I don't think I can enjoy eating a warm/hot fleshy lobster roll. I'll stick with Luke's Lobster Rolls forever.

"I looked on yelp near by and found this spot. I am glad I did, the food was delicious. My boyfriend had fried calamari and broiled mussels. The calamari was light you can taste the seafood without the overpowering deep fry taste that is heavy on your stomach. It was breaded to perfection the right combination of crisp and crunchy. The mussels I must admit were a bit bland but nonetheless enjoyable. I had a dozen of east coast oysters at 2.39 each. They were simply delicious. For drinks I had a vodka lemonade very delicious and my boyfriend a coke.

"Had the lunch special, clam chowder soup with a lobster slider and crab slider. Soup was very good, however, the lobster slider was just ok, nothing especial. Same could be said for the crab slider.

If in the neighborhood, I might give it another try but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.",3.0
"It's been a while since I last came here and figured it was the perfect spot for dinner on a hot night with a group of friends.  We were surprised by how busy it was at about 7:30pm on Saturday, but the line moved fast and their backyard is huge so we found a table without issue.They really know what they're doing here, both in terms of service, speed of getting your food and what they're making.  Everything was fantastic.It only took about 15 minutes for us to get food.  We were already enjoying cold beers and the fun atmosphere in the backyward. Our party ordered the following:- Lobster Rolls w/ fries: You can't go wrong with these.  They're awesome, fresh and delicious.  My friends were really surprised by how much lobster it came with.  Definitely worth the price.- Fish & Chips: absolutely outstanding.  This comes with a very large cod filet, which is so perfectly crisp on the outside and tender flakey goodness on the inside.  It was enough to share w/ two people.  The fries are really good as well.- Crabcake platter: comes with 2 giant crab cakes which are perfectly panfried and really succulent.  It has the sweetness from the crab, but also a lot of flavor from spices and the bread crumbs that hold it together.  It was really delicious and I savored every bite.  I got this with a side of coleslaw which was fresh and crisp.  Definitely a good option if you're trying to avoid all the fried.  I like that they put the crab cakes on lettuce to keep it away from the sogginess of the cole slaw.  Smart move!Also ordered fried oysters to share, which was yummy!  They were huge and perfectly fried.  Liked that they were served in the shell - it was a fun appetizer.So yeah, this place rocks!!  Definitely want to come back for happy hour (apparently they have $1 oysters, but have yet to confirm) and their brunch, which sounded yummy.",4.0

"Its a nice place to go to. Very cozy and reminds me of small seafood places in New England.   Food is B+,  I had better,  but for Brooklyn area at that price its great.  They cook well and food is fresh.  Service needs a little bit of improvement.  Again its not bad,  but you come in, and have to order and pay right the way.  I found it awkward because I got half of service,  and I did not know how to tip.  It's a small place and if they train busboy or waiter to take orders that would be great.  Other than that,  it's a definetly a place to stop at. Parking is not the issue,  especially after 7pm.",4.0
"Let me start by saying, that I LOVE the lobster joint. This has been my neighborhood go to place for years now. I am a huge fan of their lobster salad and their onion rings. I always bring my friends and family there...but last night was one of the worst experiences and I have to say I'm really upset about it. We sat down at the bar and were promptly helped by the bar tender/waitress (with pink hair). We placed our order at 7:45pm, we got the crab cake dinner, the lobster salad, and three sides (pickles, union rings and fries). We were hungry and tired. The place was full, but not packed and she was only helped my boyfriend and I, and one duo of people at the bar. By 8:45 our food had still not arrived. She made the excuse that they were trying to bring everything out at the same time. I wish she had just owned up to the fact that their the kitchen was backed up, or that she had forgotten to put in our order (which is much more likely). We sat and watched EVERYONE around us who had arrived after us receive their food. Not cool. By the time the food arrived I was so annoyed I couldn't even enjoy my meal",1.0
"When in Greenpoint go to the Lobster Joint! Really cute restaurant with a bar and tables in front and an enclosed heated patio in the back! Their menu is pretty extensive and is written right above the register on a big chalkboard. I knew right away what I would be having. A Connecticut style lobster roll (warm with butter), fries, coleslaw, pickle and a can of coke! All that for $22. I was given a number and headed back to the garden to grab a table and wait for our food to arrive (my friend got the same). When the food was delivered to us I was floored buy how huge the lobster pieces were! After I took my picture for yelp and other social media, I dove right in. WOW. The lobster was a buttery, heavenly goodness! The fries were also really good as we were lucky to get a batch that must have just been made. On the table is a roll of paper towels, a holder of silverware rollups, and all the different condiments you could want'; I just stuck to the ketchup for the fries. I highly recommend this place to anyone in Greenpoint or even Williamsburg, it is cute and delicious!!",5.0

I love the conecticut style lobster roll buttery and was really good. the mac and cheese was next to my fave top pick. it was incredibly good.the service was terrible, our food came soooo late we were online for 20 mins and we waited for our food for at least 45 mins.the calamari wasnt all that. the ketchup was weird, it tasted like there was some liquor in it. the lobster roll was too small for the price. they are just lucky that that food was good.",3.0
"Had the lunch special, clam chowder soup with a lobster slider and crab slider. Soup was very good, however, the lobster slider was just ok, nothing especial. Same could be said for the crab slider. Maybe my expectations of this place were too high and they weren't met. The price was a bit high given the size of the sliders. If in the neighborhood, I might give it another try but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.",3.0
"It's been a while since I last came here and figured it was the perfect spot for dinner on a hot night with a group of friends.  We were surprised by how busy it was at about 7:30pm on Saturday, but the line moved fast and their backyard is huge so we found a table without issue.They really know what they're doing here, both in terms of service, speed of getting your food and what they're making.  Everything was fantastic.It only took about 15 minutes for us to get food.  We were already enjoying cold beers and the fun atmosphere in the backyward. Our party ordered the following:- Lobster Rolls w/ fries: You can't go wrong with these.  They're awesome, fresh and delicious.  My friends were really surprised by how much lobster it came with.  Definitely worth the price.- Fish & Chips: absolutely outstanding.  This comes with a very large cod filet, which is so perfectly crisp on the outside and tender flakey goodness on the inside.  It was enough to share w/ two people.  The fries are really good as well.- Crabcake platter: comes with 2 giant crab cakes which are perfectly panfried and really succulent.  It has the sweetness from the crab, but also a lot of flavor from spices and the bread crumbs that hold it together.  It was really delicious and I savored every bite.  I got this with a side of coleslaw which was fresh and crisp.  Definitely a good option if you're trying to avoid all the fried.  I like that they put the crab cakes on lettuce to keep it away from the sogginess of the cole slaw.  Smart move!Also ordered fried oysters to share, which was yummy!  They were huge and perfectly fried.  Liked that they were served in the shell - it was a fun appetizer.So yeah, this place rocks!!  Definitely want to come back for happy hour (apparently they have $1 oysters, but have yet to confirm) and their brunch, which sounded yummy.",4.0
"This is my favorite place for lobster rolls outside of Maine. The lobster rolls, lobster mac and cheese, mussels, and clam chowder are delicious. Everyone I bring here loves it as well. I almost didnt want to review because I don't want it to get so crowded... but they deserve it!",5.0
"Best lobster roll around.  Prices are great.  Can get crowded, but never too long a wait.  Friendly staff and decent beer on tap.  Clam strips, fried oysters, and clam chowder are also a hit.",4.0
"Its a nice place to go to. Very cozy and reminds me of small seafood places in New England.   Food is B+,  I had better,  but for Brooklyn area at that price its great.  They cook well and food is fresh.  Service needs a little bit of improvement.  Again its not bad,  but you come in, and have to order and pay right the way.  I found it awkward because I got half of service,  and I did not know how to tip.  It's a small place and if they train busboy or waiter to take orders that would be great.  Other than that,  it's a definetly a place to stop at. Parking is not the issue,  especially after 7pm.",4.0
"Let me start by saying, that I LOVE the lobster joint. This has been my neighborhood go to place for years now. I am a huge fan of their lobster salad and their onion rings. I always bring my friends and family there...but last night was one of the worst experiences and I have to say I'm really upset about it. We sat down at the bar and were promptly helped by the bar tender/waitress (with pink hair). We placed our order at 7:45pm, we got the crab cake dinner, the lobster salad, and three sides (pickles, union rings and fries). We were hungry and tired. The place was full, but not packed and she was only helped my boyfriend and I, and one duo of people at the bar. By 8:45 our food had still not arrived. She made the excuse that they were trying to bring everything out at the same time. I wish she had just owned up to the fact that their the kitchen was backed up, or that she had forgotten to put in our order (which is much more likely). We sat and watched EVERYONE around us who had arrived after us receive their food. Not cool. By the time the food arrived I was so annoyed I couldn't even enjoy my meal",1.0
"When in Greenpoint go to the Lobster Joint! Really cute restaurant with a bar and tables in front and an enclosed heated patio in the back! Their menu is pretty extensive and is written right above the register on a big chalkboard. I knew right away what I would be having. A Connecticut style lobster roll (warm with butter), fries, coleslaw, pickle and a can of coke! All that for $22. I was given a number and headed back to the garden to grab a table and wait for our food to arrive (my friend got the same). When the food was delivered to us I was floored buy how huge the lobster pieces were! After I took my picture for yelp and other social media, I dove right in. WOW. The lobster was a buttery, heavenly goodness! The fries were also really good as we were lucky to get a batch that must have just been made. On the table is a roll of paper towels, a holder of silverware rollups, and all the different condiments you could want'; I just stuck to the ketchup for the fries. I highly recommend this place to anyone in Greenpoint or even Williamsburg, it is cute and delicious!!",5.0
"I really enjoy this place, but as with any seafood restaurant in the city, I'm always left feeling like, ""Holy sh*t, we just spent a lot of money on not a lot of food that was DELICIOUS, but now I'm still hungrrryyyy....""That said, the brunch is VERY filling, and a pretty great value - especially the lobster rancheros, and it comes with a coffee and your choice of a mimosa or lobster claw bloody mary (I hate bloody marys, but how cool is that in concept?!).We also came here for Happy Hour, which offers a slew of discounted food and drinks every Friday afternoon.  We spent about $50 for:   4 mini seafood sliders (2 lobster, 1 fried oyster, 1 crab cake), 10 oysters ($1 ea), two cocktails (Limonitas, which are lemonade with tequila), two beers and two oyster shooters (shot of chilled vodka with an oyster at the bottom, Tabasco optional). It was a good time, but we were definitely still not as drunk and full as we would have been if we had spent the money elsewhere.  HOWEVER, the food was great, and chillin in their lowkey backyard patio on a Friday afternoon is the perfect way to start off a Brooklyn weekend.",4.0

"One of my favorite parts about summer is that it finally feels appropriate to eat a lot of seafood. In fact, I'm one of those strange people who only likes to eat certain foods during certain seasons. One of those foods is seafood.My boyfriend knows me all to well, and knows that there is nothing I love more in the summer than a tasty lobster roll. He called me on Saturday evening (the night before our anniversary) to ask me if I'd be willing to change the restaurant we normally go to on our anniversary (the Crab House). Since we had a late boat ride planned, I didn't mind. He took me here.Nothing fancy, but I'm not the type of girl who needs fancy. I just need tasty :)You walk up to order, they give you a number and you display on the table. Then they bring you the food. We ordered two lobster rolls (I opted for the regular one with butter and my guy ordered the one with avocado and bacon) and an order of the fried clams. We sat down and literally 5 mins later someone brings over a plate of food and says ""Here are your fried oysters"". Only we order clams. I told him and he immediately put in the order for clams and let us keep the oysters anyway (my first time having them!). The food was out in no time and everything was delicious! The lobster was perfect and the roll was overflowing with it. The clams were perfect! The oysters were tasty too, although I still prefer the clams. I can't wait to come back here, everything was so tasty and the people were very nice and helpful. I think we found a new go-to seafood spot :)",5.0

"Fiancé and I were heading to bk from LIC and happened upon this fine joint. Seating is communal but seeing as it was a nasty/rainy day we sat at a table by ourselves. I ordered a lobster Bloody Mary- ratios were perfect and can't complain when drinking an alcoholic beverage with a piece of lobster just chilling next to the celery. We shared 4 oysters (2 west and two east) which were super fresh and tasty. Also shared the lobster salad and the Connecticut lobster roll. The former came with this delicious vinaigrette of some sort. I know it's tough to mess up a salad with lobster chunks but it's also equally difficult to make it stand out with so few ingredients- here they have succeeded. The lobster roll was simply the bomb. Forget the drive to Maine, take the subway here instead.",5.0
"We went here on a whim due to a hankering for some oysters on the half shell. We proceeded to order the blue point oysters and steamers as they were on the menu that day. The oysters were flavorful and plump and the steamers were a thing of beauty. I would have liked a few more steamers for the price(14 bucks) but  given their deliciousness I cant be too upset. For the main entree the wifey went with the lobster club, which was lobster roll goodness with the added benefit of bacon. The roll came out overflowing with very large chunks of lobster meat. I choose to get the lobster shepherds pie. I went with this choice because I haven't seen that type of offering before and was intrigued. I wasn't sure how mashed potatoes would meld with sweet lobster meat, but it was a match made in heaven. I dont think it hurt that it was a cold, windy november day and this dish was just what the doctor ordered. The shepherds pie was stuffed with large chunks of lobster meat to my delight. One always has to wonder how much actual lobster will actually be in a dish when you try a restaurant for the first time.

So I get my boo to go out to brunch on a Sunday afternoon.  It wasn't any trouble parking; found a parking spot right in front...thats great... so far so good.  We go inside, and much to my dismay it wasn't charmingly decorated; it actually had the set up of a 67 Burger, where you order your food, get a number and sit anywhere that is available. No biggy, most lobster joints and fish and crabby shacks are set up like this.  They had the game on so that was a plus since my boo had a fantasy game that he was in the middle of playing before I guilted him to come out with me.  Now to the food: So I ordered the Connecticut lobster roll, lobster mac and cheese, and a dozen of Stoney Brook oysters.  For me the oysters were the best, then the Connecticut lobster roll, which was quite good.  It wasn't over done at all.  It was quite simple...warm lobster drizzled with butter on a nice soft roll.  Thy didn't skimp at all on the lobster either, which I respect.  The lobster mac and cheese was barely okay, borderline disappointing.  I had to sprinkle salt and pepper on it because it was so bland, but it did have a lot of lobster chunks inside so I wasn't totally disappointed with it.  To drink we had a mimosa, a dark and stormy, and a ginger snap.  All which were quite tasty.  The bartender was cute and friendly; the woman taking the orders seemed as if she was just there to do that.  No smile, no niceties, just taking the order.  All and all, I will be back.  Make sure you look at the brunch specials for 21 plus a mimosa, tea, or coffee before you order.  Don't notice it after you spend 130.00 like me.",3.0

Yes we were hungry, yes we finished it all, and surprisingly we were not high hahaOut of all those orders above, the only thing I would classify as just okay is the soup.

"After having dinner here, I was definitely seafooded out and left rubbing my tummy savoring those last few bites. Tip: Kitchen closes at 2AM for those who want to grab a bite after a night of drinking. You have to order at the cashier and they will bring your food to you. For a relatively new restaurant, this place has been doing great. Came here on a Friday night at 9pm and there were a good amount of people still eating dinner. For inside seating there are 3-4 long tables (communal style), seating  on the side bar with high bar stools, and seating at the bar. There is outdoor seating as well. My boyfriend and I ordered from our stomachs:1. Lobster Salad - Huge Salad that was plenty for 2 people. If you want to be on the healthier side, this would do good for an entree. Lots and Lots of Lobster. Delicious with the grapefruit. 2. Stone Crab Claws - For $9, you get 4 stone crab claws. These are small and perhaps not worth the money. But each small claw has plenty of meat. We were lucky and they gave us 5 claws (sweet).3. Lobster Roll & Crab Roll - I have to say that they use mayo minimally or at least it tastes that way. My favorite out of the too was the crab roll. The crab was just so much more flavorful than the lobster. Both were extremely juicy . But to win my heart, you have to be juicy and flavorful. The rolls were put on a grill and drenched with butter. MMMMM.. The rolls were a little crunchy and so it was hard to cut the rolls in half. I noticed that they did pitchers for cocktails.

"Ventured into a part of Brooklyn I've never been to before last night to attend the pre-grand opening of a new seafood restaurant.  As soon as I heard they were serving lobster rolls I knew I had to go try it.  Plus, everything on the menu was 1/2 price, including drinks, so it was a no-brainer.The place was packed when we got there.  The restaurant itself is a decent size but I suspect that the 1/2 off everything attracted many more people.  We waited on line for about 5-10 minutes to place our order.My girlfriend and I each had a lobster roll ($17 menu price) and we shared a crab cake sandwich ($14 menu price).  The chunks of lobster on these rolls were unreal.  They were literally exploding out of the bread and it looked as if an entire lobster was butchered, shelled, and shoved into the tiny bun.  The meat was lightly seasoned and the roll slightly toasted, but unbuttered.  I thoroughly enjoyed every bite of it, but would have preferred butter on the bread and perhaps a little stronger seasoning on the lobster meat.  It's great that it wasn't slathered in mayo like other ones I've had.  It also came with a bag of Cape Cod kettle cooked chips, a pickle, and small container of slaw.The crab cake sandwich was equally as delicious but not quite as meaty.  It was served on a standard bun with lettuce, tomatoes, and onions along with amazingly crisp and tasty fries, a pickle, and slaw.  It had great flavor and the seasoning was done right.My other friends also got lobster rolls, a crab cake sandwich, fish and chips, and a lobster bisque.  It appeared they enjoyed everything aside from the soup, which they said they probably wouldn't order again.  The tartar sauce that came with the fish and chips was like crack.  Everyone was dipping everything into it.Everything was fresh (which is extremely important for seafood) and generously portioned.  Most of us shared a pitcher of Lobster Ale ($20 menu price) to wash down the food.  It's a red ale with loads of chewy caramel malt, a touch of fruit and butter, and a grassy hop finish.The decor was fantastic.  From the anchor and wheel of a ship on the wall to the light bulbs encased in glass tubes and metal rope cleats as door handles, everything fit perfectly into the nautical theme.  The wooden floor boards gave the impression of being on a dock.For everything 1/2 price, it was truly a bargain.  For full price, I would still come back and try a few other things on the menu we didn't get to try this time, like the lobster mac and cheese.  Lobster Joint officially opens for business 5/27/11.",4.0
"Awesome happy hour special for the sliders and cocktails! 4 to 7 on weekdays, so right after work this is a great place to swing by. I came here for happy hour with a friend and we got an order of 10 oysters (1 dollar each!), about 8 sliders (each slider is 4 dollars) along with a side of onion rings and some clam chowder. Yes we were hungry, yes we finished it all, and surprisingly we were not high hahaOut of all those orders above, the only thing I would classify as just okay is the soup. Nothing special there but the sliders and oysters were awesome. Definitely will be coming back for another round to embrace my inner fat boy.",5.0

"After having dinner here, I was definitely seafooded out and left rubbing my tummy savoring those last few bites. Tip: Kitchen closes at 2AM for those who want to grab a bite after a night of drinking. You have to order at the cashier and they will bring your food to you. For a relatively new restaurant, this place has been doing great. Came here on a Friday night at 9pm and there were a good amount of people still eating dinner. For inside seating there are 3-4 long tables (communal style), seating  on the side bar with high bar stools, and seating at the bar. There is outdoor seating as well. My boyfriend and I ordered from our stomachs:1. Lobster Salad - Huge Salad that was plenty for 2 people. If you want to be on the healthier side, this would do good for an entree. Lots and Lots of Lobster. Delicious with the grapefruit. 2. Stone Crab Claws - For $9, you get 4 stone crab claws. These are small and perhaps not worth the money. But each small claw has plenty of meat. We were lucky and they gave us 5 claws (sweet).3. Lobster Roll & Crab Roll - I have to say that they use mayo minimally or at least it tastes that way. My favorite out of the too was the crab roll. The crab was just so much more flavorful than the lobster. Both were extremely juicy . But to win my heart, you have to be juicy and flavorful. The rolls were put on a grill and drenched with butter. MMMMM.. The rolls were a little crunchy and so it was hard to cut the rolls in half. I noticed that they did pitchers for cocktails. These are very small pitchers so be forewarned. E had the Belfast Bay Lobster Ale  which was very crispy, golden color  and not hoppy at all.",4.0

"FANTASTIC Lobster Roll..Growing up in New England I was very impressed. Nice toasted bun, good balance of mayo and it was overflowing with fresh delicious lobster which was most important. Little pricey, but every once in awhile it's ok. Love the options of fries, chips or salad and the portion of the salad was hearty. And a pickle!I wasn't as enthused about the clam strips, the flavor was a tiny lacking. That however did not stop me from chowing down. My boyfriend had the shrimp poppers and he said those were delicious. Coming back pronto.",4.0
"Cute restaurant, except for the awkward ""take-out"" / sit down pricing setup. We went on a Friday night and sat at a table awkwardly until we figured out that we had to order everything at the bar - but then the food and bill is brought to you? So you still tip on waitress service even if its kind of takeout?Anyway, the beer and drink menu is awesome and many of the drinks come by the pitcher! I don't eat shellfish, but was happy to find a surprising number of non-lobster options on the menu. I had the fish and chips which had the LARGEST piece of fried fish I had ever seen.  I ate a third of it and was foisting the rest off on my friends. There are a variety of lobster/clam/fish options and my friends liked their sandwiches. I'm no lobster roll aficionado obviously, but this is a cute restaurant with good food, and I would definitely go back in the summer, if only for a pitcher of dark and stormys!",3.0

"Went to Greenpoint for an obscure art gallery opening/showing and dying of hunger at approximately midnight, Lobster Joint was my savior!A dead quiet residential neighborhood that houses probably the most generous serving of lobster in the city...it's almost a secret I don't want to share but I ain't selfish like that. :)Lobster roll for $17...without fries. It may seem a little pricey...but the amount of FRESH lobster you get is ridiculous. The fries were bland but salt's at your disposal. A friend of mine had the oysters...and all I heard were orgasmic-sounds for a good 20 mins during and after he devoured them.Staff were extremely patient and friendly at 1:30am...considering my friends were being obnoxiously loud and drunk.

"I seriously cannot believe all the positive reviews for this place! I came here with my boyfriend, his mom and his dad. We all wanted to have a nice seafood dinner but it turned out aweful! Excited for this place, since they claim to have really good lobster rolls, we came. Upon arriving into Lobster Joint, it was just really confusing. There was no one to tell you that you had to order your food at the counter and then go find your own seat. After standing around for like 5 minutes, we were then told to make the line to order food! While reviewing the menu board on the wall, we reached the counter. I ordered the clam strips with fries, the bfs dad ordered fried fish I believeaand the bf ordered a clam chowder soup, a lobster roll and lobster Mac. My boyfriends mom really likes shrimp and does not eat much fried food so she asked for shrimp and the girl at the register had the worst attitude in planet history! She said ""if you don't see shrimp, then we don't have shrimp"". Really?!!! It was just a question. So my bf's mom was reviewing the menu again to see what she can possibly get, the girl was just so annoyed like as if we were taking up so much time. There was no one behind us and the poor lady wanted to see what she can get! You have lobster, scallops, clams etc. But no shrimp! Not our fault. So his mom decided on scallops and grits I believe it came with. She was not happy with this choice either. So we took our number that we place on top of our table that indicates our order. However, the backyard setup was really nice! They had long wooden benches, with umbrellas and rock gravel that covered the floor. This does not make up for anything though. Finally food. My food came first. We were going to wait until eveyones food came out but it was taking really long, so I shared my clam strips. There was a big basket full, so why not. Then my bf's lobster roll and soup and his mom's scallops. His dad told us to go ahead and eat while he waits for his food. Starting with my clam strips, superrrr salty! Unbearable. Literally gave me a headache. Fries were decent. My bfs lobster had a tangy fake mayo taste to it and I didnt see what all the fuss was about, I've had a million better lobster rolls. His clam chowder soup was okay. Little bit of a peppery taste to it. The mac was decent. I did not try his moms food, but she said her scallops were good. Now! After all this, we were basically finished eating our food and they never brought his dads food! Which he paid for and was on the receipt! He was so mad. He did not even want anything anymore. I felt as if the girl as the register did it deliberately because we took long to order, I can't confirm, but that's how I felt. He got his money back though.Lobster joint has bad bad food and staff with attitude. Not a pleasant experience and I will not be back here!",1.0
"Hooray that this exists and hooray that it exists in Greenpoint!  I got a lobster roll and salad, but I should have gotten fries.  They looked great.  I ordered the Connecticut Lobster Roll which is the butter (not mayo) kind.  Loved it.  Had lobster rolls at some of the world-renowned places in Maine just weeks before having my roll here at Lobster Joint and was quite satisfied.  My friend got the Mahi-Mahi sandwich, which didn't really make sense to me, but she loved it.  So, good.  The service was pretty awful.  She did the thing where you stand there politely in front of her for seemingly endless minutes while she completely ignores you.  It became clear that, since I was just a lady without a hot beard, I was going to have to make an effort to get any acknowledgement.  However, the beauty of counter-service is that I just moved on, got cozy with my friend, and ate good grub.Prices are high, but also what you'd expect.  I recommend.",4.0
"I went to try a lobster role on Thursday night and loved it! Fresh, and savory with a unique texture--in a good way. Great overall feel in the restaurant and friendly staff --the girl at the register was really nice, and gave us some tips for a bar to go to later that night in the neighborhood.  A little pricy, but that was expected for lobster.",5.0

"I live right around the corner from the Lobster Joint and go here all the time to eat and/or drink! The food is always amazing and relatively quick. The Crispy Oysters are pretty much perfect, as is the New England Clam Chowder ! The Lobster Claw Bloody Mary alone is enough to bring me there. The backyard picnic tables make it a perfect spot for both small or large groups. Friendly staff, cool casual atmosphere.. I Love You Lobster Joint",5.0
"FANTASTIC Lobster Roll..Growing up in New England I was very impressed. Nice toasted bun, good balance of mayo and it was overflowing with fresh delicious lobster which was most important. Little pricey, but every once in awhile it's ok. Love the options of fries, chips or salad and the portion of the salad was hearty. And a pickle!I wasn't as enthused about the clam strips, the flavor was a tiny lacking. That however did not stop me from chowing down. My boyfriend had the shrimp poppers and he said those were delicious. Coming back pronto.",4.0
"Cute restaurant, except for the awkward ""take-out"" / sit down pricing setup. We went on a Friday night and sat at a table awkwardly until we figured out that we had to order everything at the bar - but then the food and bill is brought to you? So you still tip on waitress service even if its kind of takeout?Anyway, the beer and drink menu is awesome and many of the drinks come by the pitcher! I don't eat shellfish, but was happy to find a surprising number of non-lobster options on the menu. I had the fish and chips which had the LARGEST piece of fried fish I had ever seen.  I ate a third of it and was foisting the rest off on my friends. There are a variety of lobster/clam/fish options and my friends liked their sandwiches. I'm no lobster roll aficionado obviously, but this is a cute restaurant with good food, and I would definitely go back in the summer, if only for a pitcher of dark and stormys!",3.0
Everything Very Good and staff is super nice. Would be 5 stars but I'm comparing it to lobster on the cape and its not quite there.,4.0
"This is my favorite restaurant in Greenpoint!! Very high quality, fresh ingredients! Super nice staff! Great hours! Adorable decor! My only suggestion is that I wish the bread wasn't so crappy. I'm guessing the smushy white hamburger buns are traditional, but I would be willing to pay extra for a lovely multi grain roll. Other than that no complaints at all!! I eat there at least one a week! Yum Yum!!",5.0
"Went to Greenpoint for an obscure art gallery opening/showing and dying of hunger at approximately midnight, Lobster Joint was my savior!A dead quiet residential neighborhood that houses probably the most generous serving of lobster in the city...it's almost a secret I don't want to share but I ain't selfish like that. :)Lobster roll for $17...without fries. It may seem a little pricey...but the amount of FRESH lobster you get is ridiculous. The fries were bland but salt's at your disposal. A friend of mine had the oysters...and all I heard were orgasmic-sounds for a good 20 mins during and after he devoured them.Staff were extremely patient and friendly at 1:30am...considering my friends were being obnoxiously loud and drunk. They didn't even make a fuss when my friend split his over-filled beer!Tip-bits: Open till 2am Tue-Sat!Cafeteria style seatingCondiments and paper towels are all at the table",5.0
"I seriously cannot believe all the positive reviews for this place! I came here with my boyfriend, his mom and his dad. We all wanted to have a nice seafood dinner but it turned out aweful! Excited for this place, since they claim to have really good lobster rolls, we came. Upon arriving into Lobster Joint, it was just really confusing. There was no one to tell you that you had to order your food at the counter and then go find your own seat. After standing around for like 5 minutes, we were then told to make the line to order food! While reviewing the menu board on the wall, we reached the counter. I ordered the clam strips with fries, the bfs dad ordered fried fish I believeaand the bf ordered a clam chowder soup, a lobster roll and lobster Mac. My boyfriends mom really likes shrimp and does not eat much fried food so she asked for shrimp and the girl at the register had the worst attitude in planet history! She said ""if you don't see shrimp, then we don't have shrimp"". Really?!!! It was just a question. So my bf's mom was reviewing the menu again to see what she can possibly get, the girl was just so annoyed like as if we were taking up so much time. There was no one behind us and the poor lady wanted to see what she can get! You have lobster, scallops, clams etc. But no shrimp! Not our fault. So his mom decided on scallops and grits I believe it came with. She was not happy with this choice either. So we took our number that we place on top of our table that indicates our order. However, the backyard setup was really nice! They had long wooden benches, with umbrellas and rock gravel that covered the floor. This does not make up for anything though. Finally food. My food came first. We were going to wait until eveyones food came out but it was taking really long, so I shared my clam strips. There was a big basket full, so why not. Then my bf's lobster roll and soup and his mom's scallops. His dad told us to go ahead and eat while he waits for his food. Starting with my clam strips, superrrr salty! Unbearable.

The lobster was hard and tasted more of cardboard than of the yummy sweetness that lobster is supposed to taste like. The original Lobster Roll was dressed in a light homemade herb mayo--which did nothing to try to bring out the flavor of the lobster-- it was just sort of a runny whitish water coating the lobster.My friend also had the crab and corn soup which literally was just some red greasy water with some corn kernels and crab strings floating in it.I am so sorry Lobster Joint-- I wanted it to work out.

"O.M.G. Visited Lobster Joint on Saturday shortly after arriving from San Francisco. What a great little ""joint"" this is!  Justin Ernsberger brings all his years of experience with seafood, most recently as chef of The Mermaid Inn EV to bear. Great, great menu thoughtfully crafted with all the best of a NE lobster shack in a really smart understated and polished operation in Green Point. It's designed as a quick service restaurant, so the generous open space that leads straight from the front door to the cash register under the large chalkboard menu to place your order. Get your number and grab a seat, inside or out, and your entire order is brought to you before you know it.  The bar has an equally thoughtful menu of special cocktails plus a great selection of beers.I had the excellent clam chowder that is rich without the weight, the incredible lobster roll and perfect fresh homemade slaw plus broccoli rabe.I really appreciate all the handcrafted counters, tables, and bar. You can tell a lot of love went into building Lobster Joint. It's enhanced by the rare antique Japanese glass buoys and other select antique fishing gear over the bar. The decorating makes a statement without being kitschy. It's obvious Lobster Joint wants their customers to be the focal points...in every way.It's a testament to the professionals who are behind Lobster Joint that the operation and service are already sooo smooth after only being open 10 days.Obviously, Rose L. fancies herself both a food and a restaurant design critic. while lacking the requisite credentials or aesthetic to be either.",5.0

"Hands down, THE best delivery service I've had in New York.  This was my first time ordering delivery from Lobster Joint, but I do eat at the restaurant semi-regularly.  I've hesitated to order before because it seems like seafood delivery could easily be a disaster, but decided to give it a shot.The guy who took my order was super efficient and organized, friendly etc.  He estimated 45 minutes for delivery time - the food was at my door (several blocks away) less than 20 minutes later.  Everything arrived perfectly as ordered - hot, fresh, just like in the restaurant.Really impressed, I almost can't believe it!  Well done.",5.0
"O.M.G. Visited Lobster Joint on Saturday shortly after arriving from San Francisco. What a great little ""joint"" this is!  Justin Ernsberger brings all his years of experience with seafood, most recently as chef of The Mermaid Inn EV to bear. Great, great menu thoughtfully crafted with all the best of a NE lobster shack in a really smart understated and polished operation in Green Point. It's designed as a quick service restaurant, so the generous open space that leads straight from the front door to the cash register under the large chalkboard menu to place your order. Get your number and grab a seat, inside or out, and your entire order is brought to you before you know it.  The bar has an equally thoughtful menu of special cocktails plus a great selection of beers.I had the excellent clam chowder that is rich without the weight, the incredible lobster roll and perfect fresh homemade slaw plus broccoli rabe.I really appreciate all the handcrafted counters, tables, and bar. You can tell a lot of love went into building Lobster Joint. It's enhanced by the rare antique Japanese glass buoys and other select antique fishing gear over the bar. The decorating makes a statement without being kitschy. It's obvious Lobster Joint wants their customers to be the focal points...in every way.It's a testament to the professionals who are behind Lobster Joint that the operation and service are already sooo smooth after only being open 10 days.Obviously, Rose L. fancies herself both a food and a restaurant design critic. while lacking the requisite credentials or aesthetic to be either.",5.0
"Came to visit New York for a friend's art show in Manhattan, and we happened to rent out a loft in Greenpoint.  Luckily, we were fortunate to be a couple of blocks away from this fine establishment - and we didn't even know that they just opened a few days before we got in.  BEST PLACE EVER.  Lobster roll was amazing, well portioned and fresh.  Highly recommended, and I'm sure that this place will be yelped approved within the next couple of weeks or so.",5.0
I want to give this place 4 stars but the last time I ate there where so many flies in there I couldn't finish my food.  I do not know how a place could operate under health codes with so many flies.  It was just beyond anything I had ever seen at any place with indoor or outdoor seating.  There is no possible way that they could keep them out of the kitchen. gross,2.0

"OK.  I don't ever write reviews, but I can't help myself.  I love the Lobster Joint so much I want them to start a frequent buyers card club.  The prices are incredibly reasonable for lobster rolls, especially for the quality of lobster roll you get here. (CLAW MEAT!!!!)The staff is amazing although they probably think I'm crazy for coming here so much.  I love the casual atmosphere, too.  The only thing that's missing is a bay outside the window.

"Warm beer, unseasoned food, and odd table service. It has the ambiance of a school cafeteria. The food has no pop. The New England lobster roll with ""herb mayo"" adds nothing to the steamed lobster, the cold slaw was tasteless, even the salad dressing added no flavor. The lobster corn bisque had great color but was surprisingly tasteless. Sad that you had to depend on salt and pepper to try and save the meal. The place is clean and the fries were the only thing that came with flavor. This place is the pale chicken of seafood. Won't be going back.",2.0

Total score!My soup was delicious. Though it was not my favorite NEC ever, it was still very tasty. The Crab Roll was unreal. Not only was it packed with crab on a perfectly toasted hot dog roll, it was dusted with just enough Old Bay to put it over the edge! My boyfriend's Lobster Roll was to die for. It was filled with huge chunks of claw meat. And the oysters were all the better because they were only $1 each.

The lobster roll was a little cold but was good.  This was actually my second time But the first time was better.  They gave half as much lobster this time.  The First time was in July and maybe the seasonal shellfish was cheaper then?   There's.

"This place is pretty great. No wait when we got there, there was seating, and the food was great. It's like being in some backyard beach house with your friends. The beer could have been a little colder when we first got it, but the service was great and the specials were wonderful. It's nice to have a place like this in Brooklyn.",4.0
"Everyone talks about the lobster rolls , however you must try the Burgers soooo tasty ,as good as Dumont. And the salads are huge and really fresh.I also had the lobster Mac and cheese which just melts in your mouth.Its well worth the trip from Manhattan or anywhere for that matter !",5.0
The lobster roll was a little cold but was good.  This was actually my second time But the first time was better.  They gave half as much lobster this time.  The First time was in July and maybe the seasonal shellfish was cheaper then?   There's. Only one restaurant like this in greenpoint.  It was good.  I Will return again.,4.0

"Well, we've been meaning to go to this place for quiet a while, but for whatever reason a combination of the distance, heat, and hunger always conspired against us and we ended up going somewhere else along the long, long walk up Manhattan Ave.We finally made it, and we're really glad that we did. It's a lobster shack, Greenpoint style. Now what does that mean? Well you have the requisite hipster collection of craft beers, not a Coors Light (or crazy larry as they're called in the Midwest) in sight. Everyone seemed to be in their hipster summer wear, but the great thing about is that it was an affectation, it was just hey, we're in Greenpoint and we like lobster. Which by the way is pretty much what we were looking for. The food was very good. The lobster roll was plentiful, could have used a little more celery for texture and flavor contrast, but as lobster roll's go, very good. My lady friend had the club, and that looked like the thing to get. Let's put it this way she wouldn't share. And the oyster's-go for the Hama's were near perfect. The onion rings, are worth the calories, a nice panko type of crust and a full onion flavor. And who can overlook the hearty bloody marry the lobster claw meat?So why not 5 stars? Well there could have been a little more stocked raw bar, a shrimp cocktail, a lobster cocktail, that type of thing. But all in all this was worth the hike and we're glad we finally made it. We'll be back, and hopefully the raw bar cupboard will be a little more full, other than that, don't change a thing. You've got a good Greenpoint thing going on",4.0

"Definitely over rated! My boyfriend and I ordered the Lobster soup over the clam chowder(even though we love clam chowder) and to our surprise it was tasty.

My boyfriend literally peeled the batter off piece by piece just to get to the fish. The fish was a little dry and had no flavor what so ever! Needless to say, we ate the chips(french fries) and soup for dinner.We may go back and try something different, but not anytime soon.",3.0

"I had dinner there this past  saturday night (8:30) with some family members.

We were smart enough to split up so we could save a seat at the same the others ordered. It's the smart move, because this place fills up.First... we all really enjoyed the food. I'm pretty serious about my lobster/lobster rolls, and these are among the best I've had in brooklyn, particularly at the price point.  The atmosphere is casual and relaxed. The backyard is very well done. And other dishes I saw around me looked really tasty as well.But one thing really bothered me, and it's not insignificant.  I was unable to order our table another round of drinks during dinner. When the food arrived, I ran inside (the server doesn't take orders) to grab some more drinks. There was a line at the register, but room at the bar. The bartender came over to me and asked what I wanted, I asked about the drinks and she told me I had to wait in the line again to order. I replied that we just got our food and wanted a second round, she said that's not how it works. So I went back outside empty handed, we ate our delicious lobsters and then went somewhere else for another drink. Does this detract from our experience? Not too much, but I can't help thinking how rigid and shortsighted it was to not let a customer buy more drinks without waiting in a now longer line for a second time. Most restaurants make their real profits on alcohol (which is why they all want liquor license), and this approach is really stupid from a business point of view; as well as inconvenient from a customer perspective. They have a bar. and a bartender. Is it really so difficult to let the bartender take a follow-up drink order?

"usually i have a problem with lobster rolls. i like them. i just don't like paying for them.well, a coworker and i decided that we were going to try out the lobster joint, though we have similar feelings about lobster rolls.so much claw meat! and delicious fries! tasty drinks and a really laid back space is going to make me change my tune about lobster rolls.",4.0
"This place serves up a pretty tasty lobster roll. I like New England style and theirs does not have too much mayo or filler (CELERY). Some great herbs and plump chunks of lobster. I got the lobster club, which was great, but part of me wished I had opted for the straight-up lobster roll, because he taste of the lobster is special and you shouldn't take any attention away from that. Great atmosphere and friendly customer service. I can't wait to go back for oyster happy hour.",4.0
The lobster roll is legit. My advice? Substitute a side of fries for chips.,4.0
"Tried this place with my BF today.  I had the fish n' chips and he had the lobster club with bacon and avocado. It was excellent! The beer battered fish was not greasy at all and the fries were perfect.The tartar sauce is the BOMB. I have never had better tartar sauce and I was told it is made fresh daily. My BFs Lobster roll had ALOT of meat - totally worth the price. Their cole slaw was also good. Its a cute spot, can't wait to try other stuff on the menu.",5.0
"Love this place! Had a really, really great experience here with some of the best casual service I've had in ages. It was a Sunday night so not too busy. Nice atmosphere. Very New England seaside style interior. White, clean, lots of natural wood. Both the bartender and server were very friendly. We took a look at the placard menu and placed our order. I had the Crab Cake sandwich and my friend ordered the Lobster salad. YUM! Both of them were exceptionally good. Most everything on the menu looked delicious. We had a really great time chumming it up with the server and bartender. They offered us a ""Pickle Back"" on the house. Which neither of us were aware of. It's a shot of Whiskey backed with pickle juice. A Brooklyn staple, we were told. This is now added to my short list of neighborhood haunts.",5.0
"One of the few places I'd actually ride the G train for. Great gin and tonics and even better seafood.  It's nice to have a place in the neighborhood for good, down to earth food.  The mussels were amazing and we'll be back to try more things on the menu.",4.0
Food great and i love the clam chowder,4.0
You know I went last night and I was so happy to get a great roll.  The food came out looked good my girlfriend got the lobster salad and I got the roll.The roll had hardly any meat on it.  Then in comparison to her salad she had about double the meat I had I counted at least 4 claws in her salad.  So I was a little disappointed in that part I mean lobster is the point fill the roll.  If they don't know how to do it go to Red's in Maine they crush it!!!,2.0

"So..... I have really been waiting to write this review about lobster joint! After tons of compliments from a friend I decided to check the place out as my birthday lunch spot. Unfortunately my experience was not good at all. We were a party of 10 and there is NO waiter/ waitress service so we had to improvise on the orders. After handling 10 request I headed out to the front to make our orders. NOTHING OFF THE MENU WAS AVAILABLE!! I found my self going back and forth to tell my party what they wanted was not available. WE ALL ENDED UP ORDERING HAMBURGERS WHICH IS CRAZY SNICE WE CAME FOR SEA FOOD!!! the lady at the bar made a mistake on a drink of ours and we were trying to clarify the drink she got pissed off at us and made a comment  like this ""I will give u a dollar to go the corner store to get a SODA"" she then slapped 4 drinks on the counter top and said ""GET OUT!!"" I Kidd  you not! What a birthday I had! I guess if the color of my skin was like hers I would have gotten better service!! The world we live in!",1.0

"A few friends and I were getting together to grab a bite and were int he mood for seafood. I found out about Lobster Joint after doing a search on yelp. The reviews looked great and the menu looked more than promising. Plus, they had an outdoor eating area and the weather was perfect. WE all ordered the lobster roll and split the mac n cheese and crispy oysters. The oysters were okay - not a must for the future.The lobster mac n cheese was full of lobster and cheese but could have used a bit more seasoning.The lobster roll - large delicious chunks of lobster (A+), not to crazy on the mayo (which was perfect to my preferences), the bun was nicely toasted but to small in my opinion.Overall, I enjoyed the food and would definitely come back to try out the rest of the menu.",3.0

"I think I've had everything on the menu here and have savored and loved every bite.

"I just got back from eating here, the food, as usual, was great, the service however is another story. We sat down and got our food, 5 minutes into chowing down; I felt something on my arm, I looked down, and a huge cockroach was walking across the table and my plate. It was a reaction to say ""oh my god, that's a huge cockroach"" I didn't mean to call attention to myself, but when you look down and see that, it's kind of a reaction. After that, I continued eating. I work in the service industry and I realize that these things happen. The cockroach probably cam from outside, since the restaurant looked clean, and it's a pretty open space. That didn't really bother me. What did bother me is the way the two girls behind the counter handled it. They looked at me scowling, like I was trying to ruin everyones meal, one of them even looked at the other and said ""did that really just happen?"". Now, I did not, and wouldn't ever ask for anything to be comped off the bill, as I know the wait staff didn't put that roach on the table, but jeez. At least come over and say, ""sorry about that huge disgusting bug that just ran across your plate"", at least share a laugh about it. Instead they treating me like I was a total jerk for being grossed out. Kinda a bummer I won't be coming back because the food was great, what a shame.",2.0

"I was in town for work and had heard about this new place from a friend of mine.  When a restaurant just opens you expect there may be some hiccups.  Everything was top-notch here.  Food was AWESOME.  Price point was completely reasonable.  Beer and liquor selection is simple but sophisticated.  My buddy and I had the lobster rolls and a couple lobster ales.  The seasoning on the lobster roll was excellent, the bun was cooked PERFECTLY and the portion of lobster meat was generous.  I'm a cole slaw aficionado (if that is possible) and their cole slaw is fresh, unique without being weird and overall, wonderful.  The Lobster Ale's sweetness goes perfectly with the lobster.  Lobster beer from Maine is pretty much a no-brainer so I thought that was a great choice.  The decor makes you feel instantly comfortable as well...from the handmade tables to the nautical-themed wall behind the bar the place feels like you should have just walked off the beach.  Lastly, the service was superb.  Everyone we encountered was extremely friendly without it being forced.  They were also very attentive to our needs.  I would travel a great distance to get a lobster roll here.",5.0
