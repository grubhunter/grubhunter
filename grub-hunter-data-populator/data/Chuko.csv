"I've been to most of the ""hot"" ramen spots in the city - Ippudo, Momofuku, Totto, etc., but Chuko remains my solid, unbeatable #1. The kale salad is probably also among my favorites (and I am not a huge kale fan or follower). Between my boyfriend and myself, we've had almost everything they have to offer, and everything is worth the wait. Even if we didn't live within a 10 minute walk, this would always be our go to place for a deliciously satisfying bowl of ramen. *I will note, however, that it is pretty obnoxious to start charging for the spicy oil.",5.0
"Came at 6 on a Sunday and was surprised by no wait! First time for everything I guess. Started with the Kale Salad which was so delicious- those fried clumps? Superb. The shrimp bun was really great too- normally I steer pork but didn't want pork overload. Both my companion and I got the miso ramen with roast pork and we both were blown away. So glad I live so close to this place- I'm dying to try all of the ramen.Yes, its a little pricey and cash only- but I think worth it. The staff was also super friendly and prompt. Five stars for sure.",5.0
"The atmosphere was fun and relaxed. The sort of famous ramen however, not so great. The broth was average. The noodles weren't infused with the flavor. (I usually want to slurp them in, when it's good, but the urge to slurp was minimal)The pork on top was a little cold still. I wouldn't say it was bad, but for $15 I wouldn't go again on purpose.",3.0
"Chuko is one of those spots where even if you arrive in the moments before the largest snow storm of the decade, like I did a few weeks ago, you will still have to wait a bit for a seat.Once you do brave the line however, the food is pretty amazing. The fried kale salad here is as superb as everyone says, with a bright Asian-influenced vinaigrette and amazing crunch.  The pork bone ramen was also pretty outstanding, with a deep umami flavor and hefty noodles. Make sure to ask for the chili oil with this. I got the sliced roast pork but I realized I prob should have gone with the ground pork, which everyone around me had. Also, the shrimp buns were absurdly delicious and surprisingly light despite the fact they are fried shrimp covered in sauce. So yeah, plenty of negatives: cash only, long lines, cramped seating, no desserts...but the food is so wildly excellent that it is worth it.Also, as for the desserts, one of the best ice cream shops in the entire country--Ample Hills Creamery--is like two blocks away, so def make sure to rock that afterward.",5.0
"CASH ONLY!Top 3 favorite ramen spot!Decor: very simple, high chairs at the bar and window seats, and they've got table seating as well. It's dim in there during dinner so don't expect good lighting in your photos unless you're sitting by the windows, or turn your flash on, but I don't recommend you do that lol.Food: I always get the pork bone broth w/ pork chasu cause why go any other way? It's $15 a bowl but trust me when I say you're tummy will be stuffed after this one. There isn't too much going on in the ramen, which is great cause it allows you to enjoy and appreciate their rich broth!  I normally like the squiggly noodles and this dish comes with the straight ones, but I'll eat any type of noodles with this broth! I tried the kale salad for the first time today because Mike Chau raves about it on his review, and I finally understand why! The kale was perfectly blanched, dressed with like a sweet miso dressing - I think - topped with sweet raisins and thinly sliced fried sweet potatoes! Everything was so good together I couldn't believe how flavorful it was. Normally when I eat kale, I'm toughing it out, but this salad was truly enjoyable! Service was good, waiters and waitresses are always polite and provide great recommendations (which is why I always order and continue to order the pork bone ramen). Today we waited long for the ramen, but it was well worth it.",5.0
"The veggie ramen @ Chuko is one of my favorite ramen bowls in the city!Probably come here the most often whenever I have a ramen craving because it's in the neighborhood, but make no mistake - this place still makes some of my favorite ramen anywhere in NYC. The wait can be a bit long in the evenings, but they have a cool little phone app that you can use to see where your party lies in the queue. Plenty of nearby places where you can grab a quick drink while you wait, even their sister Bar Chuko right across the street. The space itself isn't very large, a bit cozy. Dimly lit. In addition to the main seating area, bar seats and some stool seats at the window facing out towards the street if you're by yourself or a couple/small group. The servers I've had have always been attentive and affable.Foodwise, I recommend the veggie miso ramen. For you carnivores out there, I still recommend the veggie ramen! Just ask for the pork added to it and they will gladly oblige. They cram so much umami in that veggie broth it's crazy. My go-to is the veggie miso ramen with spicy chili oil and soft boiled egg +/- pork depending on how I'm feeling. The ramen comes out piping hot, just on the edge of almost burning your mouth, but not quite - the perfect temp! Noodle texture is always spot on, with the perfect 'bite'. Only thing I'm probably not too fond of is the cash-only policy...but it's something I'm learning to get used to after moving to NY. Anyhow, if you're in the neighborhood and craving ramen, definitely worth a stop!",5.0
"I so wanted to hate you Chuko. How many times have I walked by you since you first opened and said oh hell no, I am not waiting in that line (20? 50? 100?). I am too old and there are way to many phenomenal ramen shops out there these days to wait in line anywhere.  Sure I have unnecessarily waited for Momofuko and Ippudo with out of town guests many a time (as I am one hell of a host) , but I would never go to either on my own. Just not worth the wait. I and long assumed Chuko was the same, as places like Dassara serve equal if not better ramen than Momofuko and Ippudo. Plus this place has been making piles of cash hand over fist for years now yet still are greedy bastards not taking any credit cards. Then came the perfect storm this evening. By pure chance we had decided to hit Gold Star Beer Counter for some phenomenal Maine Brewing Company Beers and realized we were hungry and for once it was 10 minutes before Chuko opened. As luck would have it we arrived just as the doors were and there was absolutely no wait. I was still skeptical but decided to dive in with their steamed pork bun with chili mayo and kale salad with crispy sweet potatoes and raisin (yes, I would never have guessed I would order a kale salad here too, but I am a brooklynite after all). The pork bun was phenomenal and perfectly balanced out with thin slices of cucumber on top.  The kale salad was also phenomenal with a really amazing dressing and just perfection all around. For our ramen, the wife went with the veggie ramen with squash and market veggies and pork belly (as nothing goes better with veggie anything than pork). She also went with the ""optional"" soft boiled egg on top...oh why oh why do places charge extra for eggs these days?  Just raise your prices $5 and include the egg and take credit cards....you will make even more of a killing and have happy customers who will order more not having to worry about running out of cash. Sorry...back to the food.  The veggie ramen with pork was perfection. Just a great range of balanced and even flavors. I went for the kimchi ramen with ground pork and it too was just pure perfection.  Perfectly cooked al dente noodles with an intense spicy broth that surprisingly wasn't too rich or buttery...it was just pure delight.  Soooo usually a place this popular, and with truly deserving highly rated food comes surly service with staff who want to rocket you out of there for the next in an endless line of cash paying customers. Not so here. Our waitress was super attentive and nice and did not rush us in any way.  In fact after finishing our appetizers she asked if we wanted more before bringing our ramen out.  She was also super attentive with our water and seeing if we needed anything (without rushing us). On the downside the drink selection is limited to sake, wine, Sapporo on tap, and expensive Japanese beers in bottle.mfor $10-11 a bottle. I was going to cave on the Sapporo when I noticed a Japanese IPA. Didn't even think such a thing existed but how could I not try. It was really excellent and refreshing...in a Japanese kind of way of course. Okay so not sure what else to say other than I was so wrong and should have gone here years ago.  Of course maybe it is better not to know how good this place is. After all, I had no need to wait in line for ramen until I came here...and now I am hooked. You will be too, so consider yourself warned.",5.0
"I dream of oodles of noodles. Hence, I made it one of my personal missions to try out as many ramen joints as I can in the NY area. I've heard great reviews from Chuko and one evening I got hungry and decided to search for the closest ramen place to me. Chuko was the first to pop up and there I go. It's a small place with not a lot of seating. We arrived around 6:30 on a weeknight and it was already packed. However, they had windows seats and we decided to sit there. It was definitely not the most comfortable seating but you gotta do what you gotta do. The menu had various types of broth you can choose from and then you choose what protein you would like with the soup. I chose the pork bone with roast pork.Our ramen came pretty fast and we digged in. The broth was so rich and full of flavor, I end up drinking a lot of it. The noodles also had that ""bounciness"" to it that I like and wasn't all clumped together. TLDR: the ramen was pretty darn good.The only reason this place isn't a 5 but instead a 4 is because of the seating. It's not the most comfortable of places and sometimes I just want to enjoy my warm soupy ramen at my leisure. You cannot do that here at chuko. However, I do see myself coming here again (maybe lunch) when they are less busy.",4.0
"REDEMPTION. I think the previous time was an off night for broth. The miso ramen with added pork and egg we had this time was perfect. Well, almost perfect as they initially forgot the pork and there was a hair in my wife's soup. The staff was great though, they brought the pork right out and got a new soup for my wife out in 5 minutes. They were really apologetic about it too and gave us a free extra app. Another great discovery this time was the kale salad, which has a miso dressing that is to die for. Will continue to come here at hopefully non-peak times as it does get very busy.",4.0
"Fast, efficient service with delicious ramen.I've been here twice and had the pork bone ramen each time. It was delicious and hearty without being too salty. The pork was very tender. My favorite part about the ramen here are the noodles - chewy enough and not too thin (although I prefer slightly thicker noodles in general). Also has a limited but quality selection of beers.Cash only.",4.0
"I absolutely LOVE Chuko - my new favorite ramen place! I came here with some friends on a Tuesday evening and there was a bit of a wait, but we were able to go to a bar across the street to kill some time (thanks Woodwork!). I have to say, the food and the amazing service here made the wait absolutely worth it. Between the three of us, we sampled about half of the menu - everything was phenomenal. A tip for your visit though: this is a cash only restaurant!To start, we ordered the pork buns, shrimp buns, and crispy brussels sprouts. The pork buns were exactly what you would expect: soft, fluffy buns and a delicious blend of flavor within each bite. The shrimp buns were delicious as well, and the crispy shrimp filling was a nice touch.  Make sure to ask for the garlic chili sauce to dip your buns in!When it comes to the ramen, you literally cannot go wrong. We ordered the Pork bone ramen, vegetable ramen, and kimchi ramen, all of which were equally good despite being so different. Each person's broth had such a deep range of flavor, I'm salivating as I'm writing this. I highly recommend getting the ground pork as a protein option regardless of what ramen you get (although veggie and ground pork seemed to stand out the most), since the ground pork adds a little kick to it and is quite flavorful in itself. TL;DR - Cash only. Amazing service, even better food, and definitely worth the wait.",5.0
"Very good ramen but definitely not the best in the city like advertised. It's pretty decent but I think Jin Ramen and Ippudo beat it by far.What I really liked was their miso ramen. I think is the best choice. From the flavorful broth to the awesome noodles, the whole dish integrates a lot of different tastes into one great experience. The butternut squash is a wonderful touch and the poached egg adds that need of egg and thickness inside the broth.I expected more from the pork bone ramen. Their noodles are thin and not as tasteful as the miso ramen. The whole soft boiled egg is a plus since in most of the ramen places they give you just a half. The roasted pork is not memorable in either miso nor pork ramen.Good appetizers and buns, specially the shrimp one but again not comparable to Jin Ramen or Ippudo.Best place for ramen in Brooklyn for sure but not the best in town.",4.0

"It's Sunday. I had this ramen on Tuesday & I'm still not over it! It was THAT GOOD. Seriously. Chuko has the most delicious ramen I've ever had. Started off with a steamed pork bun ($5) - it's a great bite. The bao was warm and the pork belly was tender. Not much to it, but these are such a staple in ramen places so I had to try it! THE RAMEN (~$15) - best ramen, hands down. I got the pork bone ramen and omg. I've never had a ramen with that much flavor. It was so rich that I couldn't believe it for the first few slurps. The noodles were good (and a decent amount). The pork belly I got with it was tender, juicy, and didn't have too much fat on it (just how I like). It's definitely one of the simpler ramens I've had - there aren't too many components to it. My boyfriend got the kimchi ramen. I normally don't tolerate spicy things too well, but I sampled his and it was delicious as well! It had a kick to it, but nothing I couldn't handle. We actually ate in silence for a while because we were so engrossed in eating.Service was fine, and the food came out pretty quickly. I came here around 6 and there was no wait, but by the time we were finished there was a wait. It has a chill vibe - dark and intimate at night. A bit loud in here, which was surprising to me.

"Usually the ramen is AMAZING. Like, the only place I want to go to the morning after a night of heavy drinking. Maybe it was because I wasn't hungover or maybe they just lost their touch.

This is pretty good considering we've been told to wait over an hour before. Seems like they need to pick up their game again.",4.0

The glazed pork belly was fatty with a caramelized crust. The pickled cucumbers, daikon, and carrot added a sour crunch. The spicy mayo and cilantro leaf provided the final touch. I opted for the Kimchi Ramen which came rather quickly. The broth was spicy with Korean flavors. The curly medium cut noodles were cooked al dente and intertwined perfectly with the ground pork. The kimchi added sweetness and texture to the dish. The super soft boiled egg had a running yolk. This dish was packed with simple but bold flavors. It kind of reminded me of a Mapo Tofu Ramen.

"Delicious ramen and fast, friendly service. This place is always crowded for a reason. Even at lunch time on a weekday. I usually get a spot fairly quickly though at the bar if I'm solo. The shrimp buns are delicious. They have a tasty tarter like sauce on crispy tiny shrimps. The miso soup with roasted or ground pork is my favorite. Right now they have some butternut squash in there which is pretty different and really adds an extra later of flavor. The roasted pork sometimes is just borderline too fatty for me. But overall this ramen is bangin. It's a tad bit sweet in comparison to most ramen I've had if that's not your thing. It happens to be mine so I liked it.

"I don't know how word got out about this place but an hour and fifteen minute wait for dinner at 6pm on a Sunday? Argh, how I hate this ""no reservations"" trend and the fandom ramen has garnered. After an hour and fourteen minute long escapade that almost made us miss the 15 minute window we had to return to the restaurant following the ""We're almost ready for you!"" text, my boyfriend and I were finally seated.The menu is short and sweet. Of the 4 ramen dishes they offer, you have the option to go with the tried-and-true Miso or Soy ramen found in most, if not all, ramen restaurants, or the Pork Bone or Kimchi ramen. All come with your choice of roasted pork, steamed chicken, or ground pork. With wood ear mushrooms, mustard greens, and bamboo, the Pork Bone ramen was my pick, and I harbored zero regrets. Great mix of flavors from the pork and vegetables. My boyfriend ordered the Kimchi ramen, which tasted exactly how you'd expect it to taste. It was definitely a lot richer than mine, so he walked away much fuller. If you don't let the wait get to you, you're in for a delicious dinner.",4.0

Sprinkled with raisins and a ginger ( not you ron howard, sit down) dressing made for one refreshing and healthy treat. The buns were decent, worth trying once. The ramen broth was clean and light. Noodle were cooked perfectly thou were slightly thinner than other ramen joints I've been to. Overall, a solid place with a cool hipster vibe.",4.0
"The service and staff are great. Location is stellar in one of the best BK neighborhoods. That's about it. Not sure if last night was an off night for the kitchen, but both the pork bone and miso ramen my friend and I had were sub-par. There was no depth of flavor in that broth at all. It felt tamed and flat. I left feeling like I had not satisfied my ramen craving. We were there for the mad dinner rush, and the FOH turned tables quickly and had a great attitude and energy about them. It's a bit crowded, but not in a bad way, feels cozy. Will try to come back and see what the hype is about? This simply was not good  ramen.",2.0
"This place is in a great spot in a great hood with a friendly and fun staff. Only reason I gave 4 and not 5 is $15 for Ramen is frankly unethical. That said, their veggie ramen is the best I've had. Drinks are a little pricey, too. It's loud, dark and costs a little more than it should to enjoy...

"It's hard to find a ramen joint outside of the city. It's even harder to find it in Central Brooklyn. Chuko is a welcome addition to the neighborhood. So when I was having a ramen craving, this was the perfect place to try.I ordered the Pork Bone Ramen. The broth was amazing! It was the kind that they simmered for hours and spiced it just right. Unlike other ramen places, Chuko keeps their toppings simple. The pork bone ramen came with the chashu, scallions, mushrooms and a boiled egg. The chashu was great - not too fatty and flavorful. The boiled egg was lacking though. Though it was boiled properly to a soft boil, it was plain! I think I've been spoiled for too long with the soy soaked eggs. This egg felt like it was overlooked. We also ordered the wings to try. They were crispy and juicy coming out of the kitchen. I really liked that the ramen didn't come out until we were completely done with the wings. That's great service! Everyone knows ramen noodles don't last much past 5 minutes after they've been added to the broth. So I really appreciated that there was enough attention paid to our table and we never felt rushed.This will likely be my go to ramen spot in Brooklyn from here on out. It was an easy choice. :)",4.0

The broth lacks in consistence and flavor, honestly tasted like salted water...! The pork bun was good but too much chili mayo and kinda pickles veggies.The salt and pepper wings were too salty and burned, tasted like the station hasn't been cleaned for days!Compared to other ramen place it's been the worst so far.

Service wasn't overbearing at all, but still provided everything we needed. Definite plus on this end. Nice ambience too; a tad loud but nothing too bad at all.Overall, it wasn't the best ramen I've ever had, but you certainly won't walk away disappointed.

"Came in at around 6pm on Friday evening and it was half empty. My friend and I thought we went to the wrong place but here we are. It's good that we don't need to wait but the food is really a disappointmentBroth was way too salty than I would liked it to be. Noodles are ok, but since the soup is the essence of ramen, I am really disappointed. The dried ramen is also very bold in flavor, but not in a good way. The flavoring of everything is so dense, and you have to drink so much water that you feel full really soon. The service and environments are pretty good but I did came in for the food.",2.0

"I don't know how word got out about this place but an hour and fifteen minute wait for dinner at 6pm on a Sunday? Argh, how I hate this ""no reservations"" trend and the fandom ramen has garnered. After an hour and fourteen minute long escapade that almost made us miss the 15 minute window we had to return to the restaurant following the ""We're almost ready for you!"" text, my boyfriend and I were finally seated.The menu is short and sweet. Of the 4 ramen dishes they offer, you have the option to go with the tried-and-true Miso or Soy ramen found in most, if not all, ramen restaurants, or the Pork Bone or Kimchi ramen. All come with your choice of roasted pork, steamed chicken, or ground pork. With wood ear mushrooms, mustard greens, and bamboo, the Pork Bone ramen was my pick, and I harbored zero regrets. Great mix of flavors from the pork and vegetables. My boyfriend ordered the Kimchi ramen, which tasted exactly how you'd expect it to taste. It was definitely a lot richer than mine, so he walked away much fuller. If you don't let the wait get to you, you're in for a delicious dinner.",4.0
"Chuko has a dope, laid back vibe that follows suit with their sister joint Bar Chuko. Now while they do have tables, the better seating would be at the bar. Why? Cause all the cool kids are doing it. The boss and I ordered the pork buns, kale salad and their pork bone w/ mustard green ramen. I have to admit that the kale salad was actually quite good. Sprinkled with raisins and a ginger ( not you ron howard, sit down) dressing made for one refreshing and healthy treat. The buns were decent, worth trying once. The ramen broth was clean and light. Noodle were cooked perfectly thou were slightly thinner than other ramen joints I've been to. Overall, a solid place with a cool hipster vibe.",4.0
"The service and staff are great. Location is stellar in one of the best BK neighborhoods. That's about it. Not sure if last night was an off night for the kitchen, but both the pork bone and miso ramen my friend and I had were sub-par. There was no depth of flavor in that broth at all. It felt tamed and flat. I left feeling like I had not satisfied my ramen craving. We were there for the mad dinner rush, and the FOH turned tables quickly and had a great attitude and energy about them. It's a bit crowded, but not in a bad way, feels cozy. Will try to come back and see what the hype is about? This simply was not good  ramen.",2.0
"This place is in a great spot in a great hood with a friendly and fun staff. Only reason I gave 4 and not 5 is $15 for Ramen is frankly unethical. That said, their veggie ramen is the best I've had. Drinks are a little pricey, too. It's loud, dark and costs a little more than it should to enjoy... Kind of like a foreign exchange student you meet on a train during your year abroad - different, novel and spicy... But not exactly the sum total of the parts you originally saw on the menu. But yummmmmm....",4.0
"It's hard to find a ramen joint outside of the city. It's even harder to find it in Central Brooklyn. Chuko is a welcome addition to the neighborhood. So when I was having a ramen craving, this was the perfect place to try.I ordered the Pork Bone Ramen. The broth was amazing! It was the kind that they simmered for hours and spiced it just right. Unlike other ramen places, Chuko keeps their toppings simple. The pork bone ramen came with the chashu, scallions, mushrooms and a boiled egg. The chashu was great - not too fatty and flavorful. The boiled egg was lacking though. Though it was boiled properly to a soft boil, it was plain! I think I've been spoiled for too long with the soy soaked eggs. This egg felt like it was overlooked. We also ordered the wings to try. They were crispy and juicy coming out of the kitchen. I really liked that the ramen didn't come out until we were completely done with the wings. That's great service! Everyone knows ramen noodles don't last much past 5 minutes after they've been added to the broth. So I really appreciated that there was enough attention paid to our table and we never felt rushed.This will likely be my go to ramen spot in Brooklyn from here on out. It was an easy choice. :)",4.0
"It's actually 2 stars for the food, but the service was too good, it deserves 3 for that!Went there with my girlfriend on a sunday night. Arrived at 6.10 and we wait an hour to be seated, the place was pretty busy.The service was great, very welcoming and prepared staff.The food tho, wasn't as we expected. The broth lacks in consistence and flavor, honestly tasted like salted water...! The pork bun was good but too much chili mayo and kinda pickles veggies.The salt and pepper wings were too salty and burned, tasted like the station hasn't been cleaned for days!Compared to other ramen place it's been the worst so far. C'mon guys you are super nice, try to improve your pork bone broth!!!",3.0
"Pretty dank ramen and a definite must try for ramen lovers.I had the kimchee ramen with ground pork and a spicy broth and it was delicious. Plenty of pork, just the right amount of spice and the kimchee taste really shines through. It wasn't too busy but had all the right ingredients and they worked together very well.Quite a tight little area, but we were able to sit down right away and the food came I more than 10 minutes after ordering. Service wasn't overbearing at all, but still provided everything we needed. Definite plus on this end. Nice ambience too; a tad loud but nothing too bad at all.Overall, it wasn't the best ramen I've ever had, but you certainly won't walk away disappointed. Would love to return and try some of their appetizers. Those chicken wings on the menu look and sound legit!",4.0

The soup was very rich and comforting, had a lot of flavor but I do wish it were a tad bit spicier. The noodles were chewy and had the perfect bite to them. I think this is a great first date place for anyone looking for a chill night. I don't think it is a good place for a big group to come together however.

I wish he would give me a complimentary bun for that. And I waited patiently for the ramen: veggie miso with scallion, market vegetables (bamboo, cabbage, spinach), squash and a poached egg.

"Chuko is a ramen house in the good side of Brooklyn.  It's a couple of blocks off the B train.  It's a pretty ordinary size restaurant with a bar and tables.  It totally screams hipster to me for two reasons: 1) the menu and 2) the workers.  In short, if Chuko was an actual person, it could be seen wearing a fanny pack and a Tom Selleck mustache.  The menu.  Chuko only has like 12 items on the menu and one of those items is kale.  If Kale isn't a hipster indicator, then I don't know what is.  Anyway, it took me a very long time to decide on what I wanted since their food selection is so extensive.  How did I decide?  I just went ""eeny meeny miny moe"" catch a Pork Neck Ramen by its toe. Anyway, the ramen.  The Pork Neck was actually really soft and I have a feeling it was sous vide cause the texture tasted like it was sous vide.  The flavors were there, ripped apart very easily, and it was super fatty.  The broth is rich and flavorful.  I requested a side of spicy miso to add to the broth and IMO it made the broth better.  The ramen was thinner and chewier than some ramen I've had.  It soaked up the broth very well and it also cooled down the broth too damn well.  I really dislike when my soup broth simmers down to warm.  I dislike it so much that I rather watch a marathon of Keeping Up With The Kar-JackAss-ians than have my soup broth come out warm.  Overall, Chuko is a modern take on an old world cuisine.  It does fine and I would put it next to Ippudo.  However, both still trail my all time favorite, Totto Ramen.  So the list goes like this.  Totto, Ippudo, Chuko, Puto, and YOLO.",4.0
"For a Thursday night it was very packed! Thankfully I have forgotten to get cash so I went for a walk to my bank's ATM. The hostess (I think thats her job title) named Susan was very nice and knew where the closest bank was and told my friend and I where to go. By the time we came back people were leaving so more seats! Yay! We were seated quickly as Susan remembered us even though there were a few more new customers coming in. Can I also add that Susan has amazing tatts on her arms and you just cant seem to look away? My friend asked her about them and Susan was so friendly to talk to us about it after our order was placed. A few quick minutes later after our drinks and appetizer (yummy pork and shrimp buns!!! *q*) were served, our main dishes arrived. If memory serves right my friend got the kimchi with roasted pork ramen and I got the kimchi with ground pork ramen. Both bowls were so good! The broth wasnt salty and was pretty light which was great. The ramen was also delicious and just right! But I guess you cant go wrong with noodles? Haha! At first I thought the ground beef might be a tiny bit spicy, but it was only a small hit. After that it wasnt spicy at all. Makes sense since I assume most japanese dishes are not meant to be as spicy as other asian cuisines. But that also depends on your taste buds too!When we got our food Susan came back to check up on us and everything was great! My friend is a fast eater when it comes to food she enjoys so she finished her bowl in a blink of an eye. I too finished the noodles and beef at that point and I am a pretty slow eater. Susan once again came to check up on us for the very last time and commented how we did a great job finishing our bowls. Haha! After that my friend finished the soup in my bowl and she tends to do that when she likes the soup base. I'm not much of a soup person when it comes to ramen, but if I did I too would have finished it.Even though the environment was a little loud it wasnt bad at all. Unlike regular bars or big restaurants the noise level was tolerable and you can still hear yourself talk, which made my friend and I stay for a bit to relax after we finished our meals.

"I had such high hopes for this place. My friend had heard great things so we decided to commute to Park Slope to try it out. Upon arriving, we were told there was an hour wait. Pretty annoying but we figured it MUST be good if people are waiting, right?? WRONG. The ramen was so-so. There are way too many ramen places that are equivalent if not better than Chuko. Even more annoying is that its cash only. Who carries cash nowadays? No one with dignity, that's who. I will say the shrimp bun was amazing though but again, you can get that at any ramen place. Overall I would avoid this place unless you have cash on hand, live close by, and there's no wait. So basically just don't go.",2.0

"Logistics: Can't order snacks or bites to go, only ramen. Cash only.Shrimp bun: this is some good subtle stuff. The bun is amazingly fluffy and fresh. While a little light on shrimp, the balance with the tartar sauce and pickled cabbage is delightful. I'm glad they only serve one, because this is the type of snack you could down quickly and repetitively without a second thought.Kale salad: kapow in your mouth. A little heavy on the salt n miso but I'd choose this over a post-crossfit Gatorade any day. They mix in a little crunchy kale which is a nice treat in addition to the raisins and sweet potato chips.Brussel sprouts: yum yum, but share with a friend. I went a little hog wild over this dish, the sprouts at the top are nice and crispy, but as you make it to the bottom you hit the steaming suckers soaking in fish sauce. The lovely combo includes jalapeno slivers and peanuts on top. Share with a friend or suffer the wrath of sensory overload.",4.0
"Something is in this broth. Something fantasmal.

He ordered the pork bone ramen as well as the steamed bun. The waitresses were rushing around this tightly packed space, and yet they made sure we were comfortable as they warmly took our orders and cleaned up for us and brought us extra napkins without us even mentioning that we had a drop of whatever on our table.The food came out very quickly as well. I was so taken aback by the fast service. We order and then boom, there's our food. ""Hi, are you finished?"" Boom, our check. We didn't feel rushed at all/ pressured to finish either.",5.0
"We were just here for lunch today and I'm happy to report that the food is delicious and everyone that works there is super friendly. It's been snowing all day and a hot bowl of ramen really hit the spot - especially when the ramen was super yummy!We got in right before the big lunch rush around 12:30. Some people waited out in the snow for 45 minutes to an hour - but it became totally understandable once we dug into our meal. We ordered the salt & pepper chicken wings, gyoza, kimchi ramen (soft boiled egg, ground pork), and pork bone ramen (soft boiled egg, roasted pork).The chicken was some of the juiciest if not The Juiciest I've ever had. It had perfectly crispy skin with amazing flavor. My boyfriend declared he could just go to Chuko and eat a mountain of the wings. They were really that good. We were also super impressed with the gyoza because, to be honest, neither of us have ever had actually good gyoza before. And this was not only good, it was great! This might be a weird observation but the dumpling wrapper had a great texture - not too flimsy but not super thick either. The boyfriend and I liked that it was clearly gyoza, just done very well - without shifting too heavily to a more Korean or Chinese dumpling style if that makes sense. As for the ramen, I had the pork bone and the boyfriend got kimchi. The kimchi ramen here uses ""newer"" kimchi, so there isn't that sour bite that longer-fermented kimchi gets. It's also slightly sweet. I personally wouldn't order the kimchi ramen only because, when I'm craving kimchi soup, I want Korean, super spicy, super flavorful, super fermented Kimchi Jigae (kimchi stew). Boyfriend thought it was good but it won't become his go-to. I ordered the pork bone with roasted pork and a soft boiled egg and it was very delicious. The broth was flavorful but not super salty or super oily. The noodles were thinner, which was the perfect pairing with the broth. I loved the mustard greens and wood ear mushrooms (my fave!) but, what really made this bowl of ramen for me (randomly) was the bamboo shoots. It just made the flavors of the broth better somehow! The roasted pork was also super tender and wasn't all fat but did have enough fat that it wasn't dried out, so that was good too. By the way, their soft boiled eggs here are divine.We can't wait to go back and try the miso and soy ramen next! PS: Cash only!",5.0

"I had been looking forward to trying Chuko for a long time and it lived up to the hype! The wait when we arrived was 30 minutes so we put our name in and then went and had some drinks and some delightful pickles at Bar Chuko across the street. When texted, we headed back over to Chuko and mentally prepared for our big bowls o' ramen.The service was great; the staff was incredibly friendly and courteous. The restaurant is tiny and somewhat cramped but it's a hip atmosphere. Absolutely no artwork on the walls...the brick becomes the artwork, I guess? (Ha). Very Brooklyn. I had read in the NY Times about their kale salad so I started with that. The kale was so crisp and fresh and dressed in a tangy sauce. Also in the salad were plump golden raisins, pieces of fried kale, and sweet potato chips. It was really delicious. My boyfriend had the steamed pork bun to start. He loved the spicy mayo on it but otherwise said it was very standard. Definitely try their fabulous chilli oil for dipping if you like spice! It was great and so garlicky.The ramen was excellent. The pork bone broth was rich and hearty. The kimchi ramen was as well just with the added spicy kick and ground pork. Oh, and the egg in each bowl was cooked so perfectly. It was my favorite part, just the right amount of runny. And of course the noodles rocked. Really fun for a date night on a chilly winter evening! Highly recommended.",4.0

"I had such high hopes for this place. My friend had heard great things so we decided to commute to Park Slope to try it out. Upon arriving, we were told there was an hour wait. Pretty annoying but we figured it MUST be good if people are waiting, right?? WRONG. The ramen was so-so. There are way too many ramen places that are equivalent if not better than Chuko. Even more annoying is that its cash only. Who carries cash nowadays? No one with dignity, that's who. I will say the shrimp bun was amazing though but again, you can get that at any ramen place. Overall I would avoid this place unless you have cash on hand, live close by, and there's no wait. So basically just don't go.",2.0
"Computer system went down for seating...prior group was allowed to put their name in yet my family of four wasn't given the same accommodation? Pen and paper still exist...why you would turn away +15 ppl waiting due to a technical glitch is beyond me. Sorry, but won't be coming back.",2.0
excellent ramen. Go for lunch (if you can) to avoid waiting.,4.0
"Logistics: Can't order snacks or bites to go, only ramen. Cash only.Shrimp bun: this is some good subtle stuff. The bun is amazingly fluffy and fresh. While a little light on shrimp, the balance with the tartar sauce and pickled cabbage is delightful. I'm glad they only serve one, because this is the type of snack you could down quickly and repetitively without a second thought.Kale salad: kapow in your mouth. A little heavy on the salt n miso but I'd choose this over a post-crossfit Gatorade any day. They mix in a little crunchy kale which is a nice treat in addition to the raisins and sweet potato chips.Brussel sprouts: yum yum, but share with a friend. I went a little hog wild over this dish, the sprouts at the top are nice and crispy, but as you make it to the bottom you hit the steaming suckers soaking in fish sauce. The lovely combo includes jalapeno slivers and peanuts on top. Share with a friend or suffer the wrath of sensory overload.",4.0
"Something is in this broth. Something fantasmal. I was pretty full halfway through eating my kimchi ramen, but it was so good, I couldn't stop.I came in with my friend after watching a show at Barclays, and even though the place was packed, we were seated straightaway at the bar. He ordered the pork bone ramen as well as the steamed bun. The waitresses were rushing around this tightly packed space, and yet they made sure we were comfortable as they warmly took our orders and cleaned up for us and brought us extra napkins without us even mentioning that we had a drop of whatever on our table.The food came out very quickly as well. I was so taken aback by the fast service. We order and then boom, there's our food. ""Hi, are you finished?"" Boom, our check. We didn't feel rushed at all/ pressured to finish either.",5.0
"We were just here for lunch today and I'm happy to report that the food is delicious and everyone that works there is super friendly. It's been snowing all day and a hot bowl of ramen really hit the spot - especially when the ramen was super yummy!We got in right before the big lunch rush around 12:30. Some people waited out in the snow for 45 minutes to an hour - but it became totally understandable once we dug into our meal. We ordered the salt & pepper chicken wings, gyoza, kimchi ramen (soft boiled egg, ground pork), and pork bone ramen (soft boiled egg, roasted pork).The chicken was some of the juiciest if not The Juiciest I've ever had. It had perfectly crispy skin with amazing flavor. My boyfriend declared he could just go to Chuko and eat a mountain of the wings. They were really that good. We were also super impressed with the gyoza because, to be honest, neither of us have ever had actually good gyoza before. And this was not only good, it was great! This might be a weird observation but the dumpling wrapper had a great texture - not too flimsy but not super thick either. The boyfriend and I liked that it was clearly gyoza, just done very well - without shifting too heavily to a more Korean or Chinese dumpling style if that makes sense. As for the ramen, I had the pork bone and the boyfriend got kimchi. The kimchi ramen here uses ""newer"" kimchi, so there isn't that sour bite that longer-fermented kimchi gets. It's also slightly sweet. I personally wouldn't order the kimchi ramen only because, when I'm craving kimchi soup, I want Korean, super spicy, super flavorful, super fermented Kimchi Jigae (kimchi stew). Boyfriend thought it was good but it won't become his go-to. I ordered the pork bone with roasted pork and a soft boiled egg and it was very delicious. The broth was flavorful but not super salty or super oily. The noodles were thinner, which was the perfect pairing with the broth. I loved the mustard greens and wood ear mushrooms (my fave!) but, what really made this bowl of ramen for me (randomly) was the bamboo shoots. It just made the flavors of the broth better somehow! The roasted pork was also super tender and wasn't all fat but did have enough fat that it wasn't dried out, so that was good too. By the way, their soft boiled eggs here are divine.We can't wait to go back and try the miso and soy ramen next! PS: Cash only!",5.0

"Really delicious ramen. My big NYC complaint is that most places profess being the best and often its just another salty broth. Here everything was fresh, tasty and flavorful.  This place gets packed at prime times and now I know why.  We ordered two different bowls and both were great!",4.0
"I had been looking forward to trying Chuko for a long time and it lived up to the hype! The wait when we arrived was 30 minutes so we put our name in and then went and had some drinks and some delightful pickles at Bar Chuko across the street. When texted, we headed back over to Chuko and mentally prepared for our big bowls o' ramen.The service was great; the staff was incredibly friendly and courteous. The restaurant is tiny and somewhat cramped but it's a hip atmosphere. Absolutely no artwork on the walls...the brick becomes the artwork, I guess? (Ha). Very Brooklyn. I had read in the NY Times about their kale salad so I started with that. The kale was so crisp and fresh and dressed in a tangy sauce. Also in the salad were plump golden raisins, pieces of fried kale, and sweet potato chips. It was really delicious. My boyfriend had the steamed pork bun to start. He loved the spicy mayo on it but otherwise said it was very standard. Definitely try their fabulous chilli oil for dipping if you like spice! It was great and so garlicky.The ramen was excellent. The pork bone broth was rich and hearty. The kimchi ramen was as well just with the added spicy kick and ground pork. Oh, and the egg in each bowl was cooked so perfectly. It was my favorite part, just the right amount of runny. And of course the noodles rocked. Really fun for a date night on a chilly winter evening! Highly recommended.",4.0
"Aside the long wait, the food is great. Lucky to have Chuko as my neighborhood ramen joint. Last time I was there, Iron chef Morimoto was sitting a few tables away. Miso ramen with chicken is my go to and the Brussels sprouts were very addicting. The pork buns were good too but I'd rather not sacrifice stomach space for that ramen soup. Get there early, put your name down, go across the street to bar Chuko, have a few Saturday cat beers and wait for them to call you for your table.",4.0
"Cash only. Long wait. Worthy delicious ramen. Located on a dark corner of Vanderbilt and Dean in Prospect Heights this lovely quaint restaurant is definitely worth a visit... But maybe not with all the hype. Yes the Kimchi ramen is freaking delicious and I'd go back for it during the winter, but I don't know about waiting an hour for my table on a regular Friday night at 7pm. We grabbed a few drinks nearby while waiting for the text to tell us our table was ready. It was really a very accurate system. It took an hour for our table to be rest and they gave us 15 minutes to get back to the restaurant. We could have canceled our place on the wait list by just sending a text back, indicating such. The pork-bone ramen had the smoothest broth and the kimchi ramen was super flavorful. It isn't the spicy kimchi but the traditional savory flavor with a bit of warmth.The ambiance here is romantic with dim lighting and candles. Do not go with a large group. Three is hard to accommodate as the tables are meant for two.The service was wonderful. The bartender had fantastic service with a very cute smile! ;-) All the staff were great.",4.0

I was feeling kind of tipsy from drinking the wine so quickly, but the server was relentless about getting us out of there. It was really uncomfortable, because we just wanted to finish the wine at a normal human pace, but the server was having nothing of it. Every two minutes he came back to see if we were done, and eventually my date said, ""We're just finishing our wine,"" to which the server replied,  ""It's Friday night and it's really busy,"" as if we had been sitting at a prime table for several hours after ordering only appetizers - but was not the case. In fact, we foolishly tipped him 20% which upon receipt, he gave us a contemptuous look, and I left feeling horrible in spite of eating a pretty delicious dinner.2) Since then, I've gone back a few times, always feeling a bit on edge about how I would be treated by the waitstaff.

After we get seated we get water and a server immediately, so we order drinks and gyoza. Time goes by, we drink or waters. Finally, our waiter comes back, takes our ramen order and disappears. Time goes by, we finish our water and give our waiter looks saying ""where are our drinks, it's been forever."" Finally, a friendly bartender brings our drinks. Moments later our waiter shows up and says ""hey, what did y'all order? i never put your order in."" no ""sorry"" or anything. Our food shows up, it's great. We eat, we finish and we're so full that I stand up and go outside where my friends just happen to be passing by. When I come back, 3 minutes later, I bump into the hostess who says to herself ""where did he go?!?!"" and then looks at me and sighs in my face!!!!! my friend who I was having dinner with tells me that we got kicked out (!!!) by the hostess cause we were taking too long trying to get cash (they dont take cards of course) from their atm. So food 5 stars, service 1 star. Ugh.",3.0
I had their kimchi ramen and wasn't disappointed.  Only complaint was the wait.,4.0
"Four stars for the food but two for the staff. The ramen is amazing and I love the atmosphere, but I've had the same hostess every time I go and she is frankly kind of a bitch. I understand how busy it gets and how chaotic that can be, but if I continuously feel unwelcome, I will not keep coming and will not recommend this place to others. We get it, you're a popular restaurant. Get over yourselves and continue to serve good food without the attitude.",4.0
The kale salad wasn't as decadent as I thought it would have been. I still enjoyed the sweet potato crisps but the kale tempura was not mixed well and all sank to the bottom. The gyoza was quite dry and flavorless. Veggie miso ramen could have used more veggies and definitely less salt.,3.0
"The first impression of Chuko were not good. I had to flag down a waiter for the menu while I watched other patrons get theirs promptly even though they came after us. My place setting was missing a napkin. Also, it had a very Americanized feel to the restaurant.I had the pork bone ramen. It was lighter in flavor when what i usually order but it was decent. It tasted better once I added the spicy oil to it.Bf enjoyed his spicy kimchi miso ramen. When I sampled the broth, I found it too heavy with salt. Nonetheless, he slurped up the whole bowl.

"Small ramen shop with really nice staff. Our group of 4 only had to wait 10 minutes to sit at the bar on a Saturday at 2, which is a plus.

"Not terrible, definately not better than totto^. That person is obviously an amateur reviewer or culinarian. The bowl of tonkatsu ramen was pretty straight forward.

Lacked depth of flavor as if there weren't enough aromatics such as ginger or onions in the broth. I enjoyed it, but not as much as the other three I mentioned. Sorry, it just didn't have the depth or fullness I look for in a ramen. Something was missing.",2.0
"Wow, wow, WOW.Went here on a Sunday night with some friends. The wait ended up being about 90 minutes but fortunately I have some other friends that live around the corner so we just hung out at their place for a bit.I ate my way through Tokyo and Kyoto last year so when my friends told me this was fantastic ramen, I'll admit I was a bit skeptical because surely no where can you find good ramen outside of Japan. Oh how wrong I was.This place is amazing. We started with shishito peppers (which I had never had before and quite enjoyed), brussel sprouts (wowza these are tasty) and the pork buns (not quite as good as pork buns from Momofuku but still pretty damn tasty). I had the veggie miso ramen and I could have probably eaten two more bowls. Not because the portions were small; in fact they were a good size. I just didn't want to stop eating the amazing ramen. Just....wow. Note - this place is cash only.",5.0
"Everytime I come here is such an amazing delicious experience. The music, the people, the food, the drinks! Holy smokes everything! My favorite is the soy ramen, with chicken or pork... So delish!

The broth was flavorful and addicting, and the pork was tender and fatty - just the way I like it!

"Chuko is a ramen joint located in the heart of Hipster Brooklyn, NY. Since I haven't shaved in a couple of weeks, I blended in nicely. As I entered on a Saturday night, I was told the wait will be about one hour. I decided to kill time at a bar across the street called Woodwork, check them out. Upon receiving a text message stating my table is ready, I entered the very small dining area with eager tastebuds. Pretty much anyone who knows me, knows I love ramen. I ordered the pork bun as an appetizer. The bun was light and fluffy, the pork melted in my mouth, and the spicy mayo combined with the pickles worked well. I also ordered the Pork Bone Ramen. The broth was just okay in my opinion. The pork was awesome, but the main star I believe, was the perfectly cooked soft boiled egg. One thing that bothered me were the noodles. Although cooked perfectly, it just seemed to be too thin for me. All in all I still enjoyed it and would return anytime and highly recommend. In the meantime, my search for a ramen spot that is on the same level, or beats the crap outta Ippuddo NY, continues.",4.0
"I ventured out yet again to Brooklyn in hopes of finding a place better than many of what I believe to be average places in Manhattan. This place really does not disappoint. I got the pork bone ramen and it was very very good. The broth made this ramen so amazing and I don't believe i have been to another place that makes it the same way. I came in the winter and that made it all the more satisfying.  We also started with brussel sprouts, which was very good (its kind of hard to mess up brussel sprouts). When I came I think they priced the pork buns at 7 dollars each, which was pretty steep in my opinion. I think they changed it now but my friend and I were a bit shocked at that. I took off a star because the wait time is rather long and its very confusing as there is a ""chuko bar"" which shows up on google maps. I think they need to differentiate it a bit more. This place is rather far from the subway and the walking distance is a bit of an inconvenience but other than that, this place is a def must visit for ramen fanatics.",4.0
"While everyone at our table was all going to order the pork ramen, the waitress convinced me to be the black sheep and order the Veggie miso and add pork.  It was a good choice!  The veggie miso ramen actually has the wavy noodles, while the pork ramen has the straight, white noodles (which in my mind isn't really ramen).  While the broth was tasty, everyone was super thirsty by the time we got back, and went straight to the fridge to quench our thirst.  We also ordered the salt & pepper chicken wings, gyoza, and pork buns.  Even though the salt & pepper wings were marinated, the salt & pepper were not present.  The waitress said the wings were marinated in chicken bouillon and lemon and then double-fried, which is how they get them so crunchy.  Gyoza and pork buns were just okay.",3.0

The restaurant is not huge but it has adequate seating and spaced out. We didn't feel like we were squished. After we placed our order we didn't have to wait long for our food to arrive. I had the pork bone ramen with roasted pork. It comes with boiled egg, scallions, and wood ear. The broth was really really good, but just a little salty. After I finished the broth, I was thirsty. The roasted pork was delicious and well flavored and they give you two thick pieces. The noodles had the perfect texture and the portions were just right. All the ramen were $13, which is comparable to prices in the city for ramen. Overall, this is a great spot for ramen in Brooklyn.",4.0

"[Repost of review from 3/29/2013 that Yelp moved to the listing for Bar Chuko for no reason]I can't believe I'm saying this, but the best part of my meal at this ramen joint was the Kale Salad. It's just that good.The kale ($8) was one of those dishes that I didn't particularly want to try, but felt the need to because every reviewer, Yelper and their mother goes on about how good it is.It turns out they were all correct. I was shocked at how flavorful and addictive this little bowl of kale, golden raisins, crispy sweet potato pieces and vegetables was. Sure, it's not particularly healthy given that it must be mostly fried, but it's so good. I could have eaten another bowl.But I didn't - I saved my room for one of the steamed Pork Buns ($5), which also happened to be an excellent rendition. I'm not a fan of the ones that are pure fat, so this one, with just a tiny strip of fat on top, was perfect. The mayo was applied a little too much for my taste, but it was still great.Finally, the ramen - this is a pretty bare bones bowl, compared to some of the other places where you can add in all kinds of meat and corn and other toppings. Luckily it's so good and flavorful it doesn't need all that extra stuff. I got the Miso Ramen ($13), which consists of scallion, an egg, cabbage, and a choice of chicken or pork. I opted for the chicken to go on the lighter side, and it did not disappoint.The space itself is also really nice. Lots of seats at the bar as well as tables, and it doesn't feel as cramped as several of the other popular ramen places in the city do. I got there nice and early for lunch, but there was definitely a wait by the time I left around one.This is an awesome spot for an extremely satisfying meal.

"I came early at opening time, I was seated quickly. I must first mention the our waiter was awesome and very attentive. The menu is very limited, make sure to ask about daily specials not listed on the menu.I ordered the Pork Bone Ramen, the broth was flavorful but I didn't care too much about the noodles, they were thin type ramen noodles as appose to the thicker egg Ramen noodles which I prefer, the egg noodles have a bite to them which makes the the soup ( as a whole) taste better. If you decide to order this soup make sure to order a side of egg noodles for only $2.00, it worked out for me because I just dumped it in the bowl. Yummy. Also make sure to add their special garlic chili oil to your soup which elevates the flavor.The garlic chili is insanely good and not too spicy.Make sure to order the wings as well, request them well done for extra crispness.My experience was good but I've had better ramen, that's basically the only problem.I blame myself for living in NYC and being exposed to many good eats (restaurants).",4.0

"First ramen joint we tried in Brooklyn. We've been to plenty of ramen restaurants allover Queens and Manhattan and Chucko definitely did not disappoint. Started off with the pork buns, which is mandatory at any ramen spot. Then I followed it up the classic miso ramen and my lady friend had the kimchi ramen 'cus shes into all things spicy. Tasted great, broth was fatty and not overly salty. Outside was cold and wet so it made it extra good having that warm soup belly. They had some ramen specials, including one that had bacon, written on the board when we went. I want to go back just to try that. It's not in the current menu online but I hope they still have it.Service was great, food came out on time, and our waitress sounds just like Amy Farrah Fowler.Heads up, Cash only!",5.0
"This place is a 5 for me, mostly because I absolutely love showing this place off to friends and visitors who brave the trip to Brooklyn from whatever borough they're in.Things to know:1. They have an electronic wait listGo in and tell the host your name/#, and feel free to roam around. They don't always have this system in place, but they are normally pretty lenient about it - they're not like other places where you MUST be there when they call your name or you go to the back of the line.2. The kale salad is amazing.It is one of my favorite things to eat, ever. It's delicious, and even if you don't like kale or salad, you will like this. It has pieces of tempura'd kale, along with crunchy sweet potato, golden raisins, and just an addictive dressing.3. Different ramens have different noodles.I'm not a ramen pro, so I'm not sure what these noodles are actually called, but I know the pork bone ramen has a thinner, harder noodle than the miso ramen, which has a slightly thicker, softer noodle.4. Go within 1/2 an hour of opening to avoid a wait.I am so, so, so lucky to live so close by, that on weekends I can wake up and walk to Chuko with no fear of a wait. Otherwise, I think the wait is around 15 minutes to an hour, depending on when you go.5. Don't go with a gigantic groupIt's a pretty intimate area - it's not the most comfortable place to eat, unless you're lucky and get one of the side booths.6. Cash onlyBut don't fret, they have an ATM in store. One down side - sometimes the ATM can only spit out 50's, so just be aware of that.7. Extra noodles are $1 extra.So, double the size of your meal for an amazing price! Although, I rarely ever finish the first bowl of noodles.. 8. Everything is delicious.I have been trying to eat my way round the menu, and so far, there isn't a single thing I haven't liked. My favorites are the miso ramen (I think it has more depth of flavor than the pork bone, and you won't even want to add the spicy garlic oil that they offer) and kale salad (must be said again).",5.0
"If your looking for great ramen, you've picked a great place.. Located at the corner of Vanderbilt Ave is this small gem.  When walking in there is a long ramen bar to the right and a hand full of tables that get filled up quickly so get here early when they open. If you can't snag a table quickly you are placed on a waiting list and banished to wait outside till you are called womp womp!!  :)  When you are finally seated your given a limited menu but the choices are so good! I've had much of the menu from the Gyoza which are dumplings. They have that great crispy side and come with a spicy dipping sauce.  The Fried Brussel sprouts with peanuts and spicy peppers. The sprouts go well with the peanuts. The shrimp and pork buns which are delicious my fav is the shrimp I love the crunch of the fried shrimp and the sweetness of the bun.  My all time fav is the sweet potato and kale salad although it sounds healthy it is def not it is fried and delicious!  It also has a great dressing and has sweetness from raisins. The main reason I'm here though is for the ramen and I always get the miso ramen with pork and bamboo shoots they are so good. The soup is rich in flavor  and for the price they give so much and the quality is great. I absolutely love this place! They also give garlic chili oil that goes so well with the ramen. You must check this place out!! It is cash. Parking isn't bad around this area.",5.0
"We love this restaurant: the ambience, food and service were all excellent. With 10 tables and seatings at the bar plus a bench facing the street, the place was packed when we visited. They have a simple menu.  We ordered kale and brussel sprout as appetizers and they were fantastic with cold Sapporo beer. The miso ramen was really flavorable. I loved being able to break the egg yolk in the soup broth (instead of the usual hardboiled version). Had a great time. Beware: like most Japanese restaurants they only accept cash.",5.0
"Chalk it up to Chuko for being the best out of the three ramen spots that I tried in NYC. Came here on a snowy winter day, which is the perfect type of day for ramen. But lets be honest, when isn't there a perfect day for ramen? Ramen here was actually pretty on point. Definitely not the best I've ever had, but at least the ramen broth actually had a decent flavor and the meat was tasty. Noodles were the best part imo, as they weren't overly cooked and actually had a bit of firmness to them. It's a pretty small place so keep that in mind regarding wait times and size of groups. Also cash only is a little iffy in this technological day and age, but they've got an ATM in the back so at least they got that covered.All said, it's a nice spot for some food in Brooklyn! Definitely wouldn't mind coming back next time I'm in that neck of the woods.",4.0

"I came early at opening time, I was seated quickly. I must first mention the our waiter was awesome and very attentive. The menu is very limited, make sure to ask about daily specials not listed on the menu.I ordered the Pork Bone Ramen, the broth was flavorful but I didn't care too much about the noodles, they were thin type ramen noodles as appose to the thicker egg Ramen noodles which I prefer, the egg noodles have a bite to them which makes the the soup ( as a whole) taste better. If you decide to order this soup make sure to order a side of egg noodles for only $2.00, it worked out for me because I just dumped it in the bowl. Yummy. Also make sure to add their special garlic chili oil to your soup which elevates the flavor.The garlic chili is insanely good and not too spicy.Make sure to order the wings as well, request them well done for extra crispness.My experience was good but I've had better ramen, that's basically the only problem.I blame myself for living in NYC and being exposed to many good eats (restaurants).",4.0
"Waited 90 minutes for a table. Was the food worth it? Maybe... On the flip side, I actually respect and appreciate that they don't take reservations. Prices are somewhat inflated but the portions are hefty and the noodley goodness keeps you feeling warm inside. Cool place!",4.0
"First ramen joint we tried in Brooklyn. We've been to plenty of ramen restaurants allover Queens and Manhattan and Chucko definitely did not disappoint. Started off with the pork buns, which is mandatory at any ramen spot. Then I followed it up the classic miso ramen and my lady friend had the kimchi ramen 'cus shes into all things spicy. Tasted great, broth was fatty and not overly salty. Outside was cold and wet so it made it extra good having that warm soup belly. They had some ramen specials, including one that had bacon, written on the board when we went. I want to go back just to try that. It's not in the current menu online but I hope they still have it.Service was great, food came out on time, and our waitress sounds just like Amy Farrah Fowler.Heads up, Cash only!",5.0
"This place is a 5 for me, mostly because I absolutely love showing this place off to friends and visitors who brave the trip to Brooklyn from whatever borough they're in.Things to know:1. They have an electronic wait listGo in and tell the host your name/#, and feel free to roam around. They don't always have this system in place, but they are normally pretty lenient about it - they're not like other places where you MUST be there when they call your name or you go to the back of the line.2. The kale salad is amazing.It is one of my favorite things to eat, ever. It's delicious, and even if you don't like kale or salad, you will like this. It has pieces of tempura'd kale, along with crunchy sweet potato, golden raisins, and just an addictive dressing.3. Different ramens have different noodles.I'm not a ramen pro, so I'm not sure what these noodles are actually called, but I know the pork bone ramen has a thinner, harder noodle than the miso ramen, which has a slightly thicker, softer noodle.4. Go within 1/2 an hour of opening to avoid a wait.I am so, so, so lucky to live so close by, that on weekends I can wake up and walk to Chuko with no fear of a wait. Otherwise, I think the wait is around 15 minutes to an hour, depending on when you go.5. Don't go with a gigantic groupIt's a pretty intimate area - it's not the most comfortable place to eat, unless you're lucky and get one of the side booths.6. Cash onlyBut don't fret, they have an ATM in store. One down side - sometimes the ATM can only spit out 50's, so just be aware of that.7. Extra noodles are $1 extra.So, double the size of your meal for an amazing price! Although, I rarely ever finish the first bowl of noodles.. 8. Everything is delicious.I have been trying to eat my way round the menu, and so far, there isn't a single thing I haven't liked. My favorites are the miso ramen (I think it has more depth of flavor than the pork bone, and you won't even want to add the spicy garlic oil that they offer) and kale salad (must be said again).",5.0
"If your looking for great ramen, you've picked a great place.. Located at the corner of Vanderbilt Ave is this small gem.  When walking in there is a long ramen bar to the right and a hand full of tables that get filled up quickly so get here early when they open. If you can't snag a table quickly you are placed on a waiting list and banished to wait outside till you are called womp womp!!  :)  When you are finally seated your given a limited menu but the choices are so good! I've had much of the menu from the Gyoza which are dumplings. They have that great crispy side and come with a spicy dipping sauce.  The Fried Brussel sprouts with peanuts and spicy peppers. The sprouts go well with the peanuts. The shrimp and pork buns which are delicious my fav is the shrimp I love the crunch of the fried shrimp and the sweetness of the bun.  My all time fav is the sweet potato and kale salad although it sounds healthy it is def not it is fried and delicious!  It also has a great dressing and has sweetness from raisins. The main reason I'm here though is for the ramen and I always get the miso ramen with pork and bamboo shoots they are so good. The soup is rich in flavor  and for the price they give so much and the quality is great. I absolutely love this place! They also give garlic chili oil that goes so well with the ramen. You must check this place out!! It is cash. Parking isn't bad around this area.",5.0
"We love this restaurant: the ambience, food and service were all excellent. With 10 tables and seatings at the bar plus a bench facing the street, the place was packed when we visited. They have a simple menu.  We ordered kale and brussel sprout as appetizers and they were fantastic with cold Sapporo beer. The miso ramen was really flavorable. I loved being able to break the egg yolk in the soup broth (instead of the usual hardboiled version). Had a great time. Beware: like most Japanese restaurants they only accept cash.",5.0
"Chalk it up to Chuko for being the best out of the three ramen spots that I tried in NYC. Came here on a snowy winter day, which is the perfect type of day for ramen. But lets be honest, when isn't there a perfect day for ramen? Ramen here was actually pretty on point. Definitely not the best I've ever had, but at least the ramen broth actually had a decent flavor and the meat was tasty. Noodles were the best part imo, as they weren't overly cooked and actually had a bit of firmness to them. It's a pretty small place so keep that in mind regarding wait times and size of groups. Also cash only is a little iffy in this technological day and age, but they've got an ATM in the back so at least they got that covered.All said, it's a nice spot for some food in Brooklyn! Definitely wouldn't mind coming back next time I'm in that neck of the woods.",4.0

Yes the wait can be long but it is totally worth it- this is coming from someone that hates waiting. Our party of three arrived on a sunday night and had to wait almost 75 minutes to be seated (we grabbed drinks at bar chuko around the corner). We were seated on the counter which also made it uncomfortable to carry on a conversation but we managed. I got the pork broth ramen which was perfect and I just writing this review is making me crave another bowl. The quantity and quality of the bowl was perfect and at the end of I was fully satisfied. I picked pork as my meat which was excellent. I loved the garlic chili oil (asked for thirds) and started eating as a side. My one regret was that I didn't get to try the kale salad as the ATM was out of order and we weren't carrying much cash. Next time I'm bringing more cash so that I can try more of the menu instead of a great simple bowl of ramen.,5.0
"It's 85 degrees out and starting to rain on a Monday night. I walk into Chuko and luckily I saw almost half the bar empty even though the seats were full. I tell the host that it's just me and I can sit at the bar. He tells me he could probably 'swing that' and asked to put my name on his list then asked that I go back outside to wait in the rain. He comes out after 5 minutes, calls out a random name several times and pretends there was someone before me. He walks back in and emerges out right away and turns to me and says my name. Oh lucky me... I was seated at the corner of the bar and the guy at the bar poured me a full glass of room temperature water. There was no air conditioning with only a tiny bit of air from the fan on. I ordered the shrimp bun $5 which was a single bun with two breaded  fried shrimp with a tangy mayo sauce topped with pickled veggies and shredded cabbage. Tasty but unremarkable. I also got the Miso Ramen $12 with Roast Pork +$2. If you don't ask for the pork add on for an extra $2 for just 2 pieces, it's just a bowl of noodles with a soft boiled egg and some corn. The broth was rich, creamy, and very flavorful. However, the noodles were a bit too alkaline-y. The guy at the bar asked if I also wanted the chili garlic oil and that was a great addition. I poured it all in my bowl of ramen and it added some extra kick to the broth. They did turn up the air slightly higher as I was leaving but everyone was sweating in that restaurant through my whole meal and even the guy next to me kept asking for ice.

"There's a saying that goes like this: ""the way you eat is the way you have sex."" This ramen joint in Brooklyn is a place you take someone you're interested in dating, because you like to eat messy and sloppy. I ordered their salt & pepper chicken wings, gyoza and tonkotsu ramen. First, the wings- flavorful and crunchy (=potato starch, cooked to order) . Wings are tricky. I had wings at a famous ramen shop on 1st Street who had the nerve to drag out the pre-cooked wings and toss some seasonings to them. Yuck. Legit wings here. Highly recommend them.Pot stickers- less emphasis on Nira (garlic chives), possibly more catered to non-Japanese customers, but hey.. They were tasty, cooked perfectly and also won't give you a horrendous Nira breath.And now, to the ramen- very original. Pork broth was clean, not extra fatty and a hint of smokiness- bacon? Chicken stock to go with the pork bone? It is definitely an original and stand on its own. It came with a house made roast garlic chili oil. Delicious, and I'm now drenched in sweat. I like getting dirty, covered in sweat after a fantastic bowl of ramen. Was it good for you too? Noodles were from Sun Noodle Co- always reliable and good. Chewy and frizzy, just the way I like it. Always ask if they can make it extra chewy (more al dente).I usually look for a bowl of rice- if the broth is extremely fatty, I need it to ""anchor"" in my tummy, so the rice would soak up some of the fat. This is how I can keep it for more than 1-2 hours. They don't serve rice, but I didn't need it. It was ""assari""(clean) and pretty lean. I will be back for another messy meal.",5.0

"Tonight I waited in the cold, wet rain with my friend Emma for over an hour to eat at Chuko (ok, so we drank cappuccinos in Le Gamin while we waited). I think that this was the longest I had ever chosen to wait and eat at a restaurant, but it is so worth it! When you put your name down, they actually take your number and text you once your table is ready, so you can feel free to stroll around the neighb while you're waiting. So convenient.When we got the text that our table was ready, we headed over and were seated immediately. Emma had been here before, so she ordered for us. We got 2 pork buns, the crispy brussels and we each got a bowl of the miso ramen.The brussel sprouts were delicious! Charred perfectly to a nice crisp, with crunchy peanuts and salty fish sauce. I could eat these all day, everyday! The pork buns were also very good, that chili mayo is a winner for sure.When our miso arrived, we were two happy campers. The broth is so pungent and flavorful, probably the best I've ever had. It was so rich that it almost seemed buttery. They give you a whole egg, and when you punch it open, the velvety yolk will make your ramen even more delicious. This was so rich, that neither of us could finish, but they made for some pretty satisfying leftovers.For $50, I'd say that this is quite a luxurious meal for two. Don't let the wait scare you away, there are plenty of places to wait in the meantime (Bar Chuko, Le Gamin, Ample Hill).",5.0
"I have to be completely honest. Came here with co-workers who hyped this place up big time. They live in the area. I guess I should have known better the moment we arrived, judging by the crowd of mostly non-Japanese patrons legit waiting for tables, for ramen. RAMEN NOODLES. Nothing wrong with this, but this joint is a perfect example of a niche cultural experience making big bucks off hipsters who are OK with paying $15 for a bowl of freaking soup... It's soup people. The restaurant itself is nicely appointed and I'm not knocking the food, but it's overpriced and overhyped and I'll stick to my Mom & Pop basement joints in Flushing than this place any day...",3.0
"Just a nice side story to set up the scene. I put my name down for a table-- about an hour wait. So I went to run some errands. When they texted that my table was ready, I quickly hopped in the car and drove there. Of course, the traffic gods decide to pull one on me when I was about 10 blocks away from the place. So I decided to ditch the driver and just run in the cold for 10 blocks just so I don't lose my seats from Chuko. From this review, I obviously made it in time but for about 20-30 minutes, I couldn't breathe. Okay, time to see if this place was worth the run.Food: Had to order the pork buns, kale salad, brussel sprouts and a bunch of different ramen. The pork buns were decent-- nothing memorable at all. Ippudo still has the best pork buns. Kale salad and brussel sprouts were okay. I wished the kale salad was mixed a bit because some kale had too much dressing and some had none. I do like the crunch though and who doesn't like kale. The brussel sprouts were spicy and roasted which I do enjoy. I would probably pick the kale salad over the brussels. Time for the ramen piece. Get the veggie ramen. The best of out the ones I tried. Loved the texture of the noodles. The broth flavors were balanced and with their garlic chili oil, oh boy. The pork bone ramen does not use traditional ramen noodles, which is a bummer! It's more of vermicelli noodle type. Didn't really enjoy that broth either. The soy ramen was my second favorite-- nice and subtle flavor. Lastly, the miso ramen was not memorable. Sorry.Ambiance: Place is small but by no means too cramped. Not too loud either. Restroom was clean-- no complaints. Service: First time I came the service sucks. I wanted to wait in the restaurant and they gave me an attitude and was like ""Hey, you're not going to wait in here, right?"" Well, all is forgiven after my second attempt of trying to test this place out. The waitress was really nice. Water was replenished whenever it was empty. She even let one of my friends charge their phone. The Bottom Line: I'll be backkkk-- even though the wait is brutal. I asked if I could add 2 more people to my party 20 mins after I put my name down, and they told me it was an extra 2-3 hour wait. Sorry, must ditch the 2 people then. Place was pretty good overall.

Get the pork-bone ramen and never look back. Worth the wait. Go have a drink at Weather Up across the street and it'll make the time fly. One of the best ramen joints in the city.,5.0
"There's a saying that goes like this: ""the way you eat is the way you have sex."" This ramen joint in Brooklyn is a place you take someone you're interested in dating, because you like to eat messy and sloppy. I ordered their salt & pepper chicken wings, gyoza and tonkotsu ramen. First, the wings- flavorful and crunchy (=potato starch, cooked to order) . Wings are tricky. I had wings at a famous ramen shop on 1st Street who had the nerve to drag out the pre-cooked wings and toss some seasonings to them. Yuck. Legit wings here. Highly recommend them.Pot stickers- less emphasis on Nira (garlic chives), possibly more catered to non-Japanese customers, but hey.. They were tasty, cooked perfectly and also won't give you a horrendous Nira breath.And now, to the ramen- very original. Pork broth was clean, not extra fatty and a hint of smokiness- bacon? Chicken stock to go with the pork bone? It is definitely an original and stand on its own. It came with a house made roast garlic chili oil. Delicious, and I'm now drenched in sweat. I like getting dirty, covered in sweat after a fantastic bowl of ramen. Was it good for you too? Noodles were from Sun Noodle Co- always reliable and good. Chewy and frizzy, just the way I like it. Always ask if they can make it extra chewy (more al dente).I usually look for a bowl of rice- if the broth is extremely fatty, I need it to ""anchor"" in my tummy, so the rice would soak up some of the fat. This is how I can keep it for more than 1-2 hours. They don't serve rice, but I didn't need it. It was ""assari""(clean) and pretty lean. I will be back for another messy meal.",5.0

"Tonight I waited in the cold, wet rain with my friend Emma for over an hour to eat at Chuko (ok, so we drank cappuccinos in Le Gamin while we waited). I think that this was the longest I had ever chosen to wait and eat at a restaurant, but it is so worth it! When you put your name down, they actually take your number and text you once your table is ready, so you can feel free to stroll around the neighb while you're waiting. So convenient.When we got the text that our table was ready, we headed over and were seated immediately. Emma had been here before, so she ordered for us. We got 2 pork buns, the crispy brussels and we each got a bowl of the miso ramen.The brussel sprouts were delicious! Charred perfectly to a nice crisp, with crunchy peanuts and salty fish sauce. I could eat these all day, everyday! The pork buns were also very good, that chili mayo is a winner for sure.When our miso arrived, we were two happy campers. The broth is so pungent and flavorful, probably the best I've ever had. It was so rich that it almost seemed buttery. They give you a whole egg, and when you punch it open, the velvety yolk will make your ramen even more delicious. This was so rich, that neither of us could finish, but they made for some pretty satisfying leftovers.For $50, I'd say that this is quite a luxurious meal for two. Don't let the wait scare you away, there are plenty of places to wait in the meantime (Bar Chuko, Le Gamin, Ample Hill).",5.0
"I have to be completely honest. Came here with co-workers who hyped this place up big time. They live in the area. I guess I should have known better the moment we arrived, judging by the crowd of mostly non-Japanese patrons legit waiting for tables, for ramen. RAMEN NOODLES. Nothing wrong with this, but this joint is a perfect example of a niche cultural experience making big bucks off hipsters who are OK with paying $15 for a bowl of freaking soup... It's soup people. The restaurant itself is nicely appointed and I'm not knocking the food, but it's overpriced and overhyped and I'll stick to my Mom & Pop basement joints in Flushing than this place any day...",3.0
"Just a nice side story to set up the scene. I put my name down for a table-- about an hour wait. So I went to run some errands. When they texted that my table was ready, I quickly hopped in the car and drove there. Of course, the traffic gods decide to pull one on me when I was about 10 blocks away from the place. So I decided to ditch the driver and just run in the cold for 10 blocks just so I don't lose my seats from Chuko. From this review, I obviously made it in time but for about 20-30 minutes, I couldn't breathe. Okay, time to see if this place was worth the run.Food: Had to order the pork buns, kale salad, brussel sprouts and a bunch of different ramen. The pork buns were decent-- nothing memorable at all. Ippudo still has the best pork buns. Kale salad and brussel sprouts were okay. I wished the kale salad was mixed a bit because some kale had too much dressing and some had none. I do like the crunch though and who doesn't like kale. The brussel sprouts were spicy and roasted which I do enjoy. I would probably pick the kale salad over the brussels. Time for the ramen piece. Get the veggie ramen. The best of out the ones I tried. Loved the texture of the noodles. The broth flavors were balanced and with their garlic chili oil, oh boy. The pork bone ramen does not use traditional ramen noodles, which is a bummer! It's more of vermicelli noodle type. Didn't really enjoy that broth either. The soy ramen was my second favorite-- nice and subtle flavor. Lastly, the miso ramen was not memorable. Sorry.Ambiance: Place is small but by no means too cramped. Not too loud either. Restroom was clean-- no complaints. Service: First time I came the service sucks. I wanted to wait in the restaurant and they gave me an attitude and was like ""Hey, you're not going to wait in here, right?"" Well, all is forgiven after my second attempt of trying to test this place out. The waitress was really nice. Water was replenished whenever it was empty. She even let one of my friends charge their phone. The Bottom Line: I'll be backkkk-- even though the wait is brutal. I asked if I could add 2 more people to my party 20 mins after I put my name down, and they told me it was an extra 2-3 hour wait. Sorry, must ditch the 2 people then. Place was pretty good overall. Can't find another good ramen place in brooklyn.",4.0
"This is one of the best ramen broths I ever had! You can actually finish it, and bear it! It's not overly salty at all and doesn't leave that lingering MSG taste on your tongue. The noodles are also great. I think the pork could have been more tender, and the gyoza deserves 3.5 stars. Besides that, the kale salad was excellent! Brussel sprouts a little too soggy and juiced up. Let us taste some of the vegetable please! :)",4.0
"We made a wrong turn and ended up first at Chuko Bar instead.The cooking staff were taking a break just outside the kitchen and pointed us in the right direction, just one block down and across the street. I ordered the Gyoza which I found to be different from what I am used to.  Not better, just different.The pork bone ramen I had was good, but judging from what I have read, I had high expectations. The pork, at least, was tasty.  My wife really liked the vegetarian ramen which she ordered with slices of pork (oxymoron). She loved it.The food was good, but not the best I have had ramenwise.  The search for the holy ramen continues.",3.0
"This place is awesome and very busy...went on a Wednesday night but still had to wait around thirty minutes. The restaurant itself is pretty small but in a nice and cozy way. Staff is courteous and efficient. Menu is small but oh so good. We got shrimp buns and a spicy pork bun as appetizers. The shrimp bun was delicious. I, myself don't eat pork but my peers said the pork bun was great as well. For mains, I got the vegetarian miso ramen which was one of the best ramen I've ever had! My relatives who were with me, one got a pork bone ramen the other got a kimchi. Both were more than happy with their selections. After trying my vegetarian miso ramen however, our general consensus was that the vegetarian miso was the best! Anyway definitely recommend Chuko.

The portion was more than expected and I couldn't finish the whole bowl. The cost was around $14.For apps, we got the pork buns and wings. I would definitely recommend the pork buns.

As far as ramen goes Chuko is a decent neighborhood shop. Simple wood table and bar interior. On this cold rainy night it seems like everyone had the same thought.

"Went to this spot with my other half. We were in the mood for some good ramen closer to home (in Queens), than our favorite Ippuddo. Although it didn't meet the standard, I have to say it's some pretty damn good ramen.The place was small, hip, and laid back.  We went on a Saturday so it was really crowded and the wait time about an hour. Luckily there was a bar close by to hang out at.  After we got notified via text that our table was ready, we headed over and quickly took our seats at the bar. The staff was very friendly and attentive, our food came out quickly. We had pork buns and the Pork Bone Ramen. The buns were amazing but not as amazing as Ippuddo. It had a slightly spicy mayo sauce and the buns were nice and fluffy. The pork itself was well cooked, juicy, and well seasoned. I'd say this spot secured third place on our ""Best Ramen We've Ever Tasted"" list. The ramen was very good and had a decent broth and was very savory and it did not have that seafood broth taste that Momofuku had. Pork was good but not the ""wow"" I was looking for and the noodles...well they were good but I don't like thin noodles in my ramen.  Over all, it this is a great ramen spot for ramen junkies such as myself.  And if you are wondering, our Best Ramen We've Ever Tasted list goes as follwing:1)Ippuddo NY (NY, NY)2) MOMI Ramen (Miami, FL)3) Chuko (Brooklyn, NY)4) Momofuku (NY, NY)The search continues for more amazing ramen joints!",4.0

"Chuko serves soul warming ramen in a small modern space. Chuko is CASH ONLY and often has long waits. They also do not have an indoor place to wait for a table - just two benches outside. These constraints take a solid ramen joint down a star for not being user friendly. (I often go to Ample Hills or Unnameable Books to wait it out) They do have a clever texting system to beckon you to your table, which is pretty accurate. The food is always solid. The pork bun is small, but delicious, the kale salad is surprisingly good. The shiso peppers are sometimes a special, and they are fun to play pepper roulette. The pork bone broth ramen has the best broth but I did notice that they used egg noodles. It also comes with some tasty, fatty, melt in your mouth roast pork slices. The soft boiled egg is also perfectly executed.  That said, the food is comforting, but not mind blowing, and after a long wait the hype may not be worth it.

"I'm not sure what happened or how Chuko became the huge deal  that it is, from a small neighborhood gem, but it's now quite hard to get seated here within a reasonable time span on a busy night. It's also quite hard to get seated here on a not-busy night. It might be appropriate to drop the blanket statement of it's just hard to get seated here unless you get here early. We had come when the Super Bowl started to finally get seated without any wait (and even, within 20 minutes the place was packed). This shows that the kind of people who like to go to Chuko are the kind of people who don't particularly enjoy American football; this makes me like Chuko more. I get why people want to come eat here. For a small, simple ramen place, they've managed to make it feel like a scene; like somewhere you want to sit and eat. With it's dim, deep red tint and playlist (even if the playlist chronically crosses aggressively into the trying-too-hard zone at times), it's the kind of place you want to have dinner in, even before you know what the kitchen is about.But the kitchen is good. Just not two-hour-wait good. However, in their defense, I don't think very many places are ever two-hour wait good. There is a ramen menu  I enjoyed my pork miso ramen and thought it was hearty broth and the steam bun starters were great. The kimchi ramen was pretty rich and flavorful.

"KenScale: 8.0/10Chuko is a ramen joint in Prospect Heights that since its opening has been a beloved ramen spot among Brooklyn residents. I was visiting Brooklyn Museum recently and had a sudden craving for hot broth of ramen, and ended up here. I came over slightly after 6 p.m. on Sunday and given a wait time of one hour. Should I keep on waiting or head back to Manhattan? I was torn at first, but decided to wait out. I'm glad that I did, but not for the reason you would expect.Yes, the ramen here is the highlight, but what really stole the show were a couple of starters. I've now had multiple kale salads at different places before, but the one at Chuko was one of the best. With cripsy sweet potato, raisins and miso it had a wonderful flavor that further enhanced the fresh texture of the kale. I kept wondering how they came up with this recipe, and couldn't stop diggin in until the bowl was empty in 30 seconds. I was also pretty impressed with the crispy brussels that came with fish sauce and peanuts (again, not an ordinary brussels sprouts salad you pick up in your neighborhood salad bar), and the steamed bun of pork and chili mayo was also quite delicious, with unique flavor that was somewhat different from what I had at places like Momofuku. After filling my stomach with these delicious starters, the ramen dish finally arrived. I liked the spicy kimchi ramen that I ordered, with an intensity that was burning my inside but still so addictive. I also tried my dining companion's miso ramen with scallion, egg and squash and the broth there had a pretty moderate and soothing feel to the dish. Perhaps due to the dearth of ramen shops in Brooklyn, Chuko will get absolutely packed (the restaurant doesn't take reservations, and a dining group that came in the middle of my meal was called a 2-hour wait time!), so be there early. I liked the cozy, hipster feel of the shop crowded with youngers from all over Brooklyn. The restaurant takes only cash but there is an ATM inside that you can use. There are some affordable sake and beer menus that can complement your meal nicely. Chuko is the first ramen joint in Brooklyn that I've visited, and it certainly didn't disappoint. I rarely make it out to Prospect Heights area (my outer limit of my Brooklyn excursion is usually Williamsburg, Greenpoint or Carroll Gardens), but I would definitely come back for another satisfying meal next time I visit this area.",4.0
Maybe it was an off night but the ramen here was meh given all the hype. Kimchi was way better than pork version but both lacked deep flavor. At $14 it's way overpriced for what it was. Ipuddo and Hide Chan in Manhattan are way better. Cool space though and good service.,3.0
"Most important: the ramen is sick, including the vegetarian ramen, which is on my top 10 for sure. But I've been with enough non-vegetarians to know that ALL the ramen here is sick. So definitely go! But the experience -- it's not a totally relaxed low-key kind of ramen shop. It's so popular and small that there's often a line, and almost always a wait, even on weekday evenings. They use an app (you can download it) where you can see where you are on the list and guess how much longer your wait will be, and there are plenty of nice bars right there (Weather Up is right across the street) so it's not the worst place to be waiting. Just know you're going to be. Once you're seated, you might have that crowded New York restaurant feeling where you feel a little too stressed out by all the people waiting for tables to remember to breathe while you're eating. And you might be seated really close to strangers. But hopefully you're used to that by now. So... even though the ramen is amazing it's not usually my top choice. But it's definitely worth making the effort now and then.The service is always lovely. They give great recommendations and don't up-sell you or anything like that.Remember it's cash only (but there's an ATM inside).",4.0
"Just okay. The broths at Chuko left my palate with more to be desired. It was salty and not a meaty, hearty, fill your soul with comfort style like I am used to from star joints like Ganso or Ippudo. The I opted for pork belly instead of ground pork in my kimchi ramen and what i got was a dry slab of sad meat with fat that was tough and chewy...the exact opposite of melt in your mouth pork belly. the pork bone ramen special was more of the same. weak broth, sad pork. the kale salad was fine. the pork bun and the shrimp bun were also not up to par. they broke apart upon first bite spilling everything out everywhere (stale bun??) and the pork was again, not as tender and melty as i have come to expect my pork buns to be. i can see how people are excited about this as a neighborhood joint but it is NOT worth a trip out of your own neighborhood for this ramen.",3.0

"Chuko, I go, we go..:) I've been to Chuko about 3 times and they never disappoint. It's located exactly 1/2 a mile from my job, I usually walk or run over. Service is great, I usually get my ramen within 5-10 minutes. My favorite is the pork bone Ramen which I always get with the pork belly. The broth is super flavorful, the pork and veggies are cooked to perfection and the eggs are not overly runny like many other places. The place itself is not super big, a bit on the cozy side which is not an issue for me as I usually go during lunch time. I love Chuko and will continue to support the business as long they continue to provide great service and great food.",4.0
"DELICIOUS! We had to wait over an hour to get a seat on Saturday night, but it was well worth it. We got a free wine sampling at the store across the street and then stopped to get a drink at a bar while we waited. When our table was ready we had a friendly and attentive waiter. The ramen was amazing and the sake cans were fun. All in all a great time! Just a side note - the kimchee ramen is great, but be aware that it's fresh. I personally prefer slightly aged or even sour kimchee, so while I enjoyed it, it wasn't a 5 star rating for me.",4.0
I was craving ramen so we came here. Our go to is usually Ippudo but that's in Manhattan and always a long wait. Glad to say we now have a new go to in Brooklyn! The noodles here is very reasonably priced and it taste delicious! I think the buns are better at Ippudo but my husband thinks the Pork Belly Ramen is actually better than Ippudos. I don't eat pork so I appreciate the chicken alternative here. Will definitely be back! I gave it 4stars bc there was a long wait..about 45mins. So just be prepared for that,4.0
"I'm not sure what happened or how Chuko became the huge deal  that it is, from a small neighborhood gem, but it's now quite hard to get seated here within a reasonable time span on a busy night. It's also quite hard to get seated here on a not-busy night. It might be appropriate to drop the blanket statement of it's just hard to get seated here unless you get here early. We had come when the Super Bowl started to finally get seated without any wait (and even, within 20 minutes the place was packed). This shows that the kind of people who like to go to Chuko are the kind of people who don't particularly enjoy American football; this makes me like Chuko more. I get why people want to come eat here. For a small, simple ramen place, they've managed to make it feel like a scene; like somewhere you want to sit and eat. With it's dim, deep red tint and playlist (even if the playlist chronically crosses aggressively into the trying-too-hard zone at times), it's the kind of place you want to have dinner in, even before you know what the kitchen is about.But the kitchen is good. Just not two-hour-wait good. However, in their defense, I don't think very many places are ever two-hour wait good. There is a ramen menu  I enjoyed my pork miso ramen and thought it was hearty broth and the steam bun starters were great. The kimchi ramen was pretty rich and flavorful. While the salt & pepper wings were cooked very well, the seasoning and outer layer was a bit bland. One particularly enjoyable part of Chuko is their sake collection, which has rotating specials.

Loved the broth and the chewiness of the noodles (i don't like soft noodles.) Squash was quite a surprise in a good way. Overall, Chuko is one of the best ramen places in NYC. Believe me, I've been to many others in US and Japan as well. Can't wait for my next visit!",4.0
By far the best Ramen I have ever had! My boyfriend had the Kimchi and I had the normal one. It was so good I think our neighbors were annoyed by or constant talking about how good eveythting was. Highly recommend coming here you won't be disappointed.,5.0
"The food is phenomenal! I keep coming back for more of the Kimchi Ramen. My boyfriend loves the Pork Bone Ramen. The only downside is there is always a wait of at least 45 minutes and you can't call ahead or make reservations. It is also cash only, which can be a hassle but there is an atm in the restaurant.",5.0
"This place is rated one of the top ramen places in the country, and since I'm a ramen fanatic, I had to try this place when I visited NYC. So far, I've been here twice and enjoyed both experiences. I went to Brooklyn with a good friend of mine around 5 on a Friday and stepped into Chuko, a small, minimalistic, modern space. There is a bar on the right side, bench seating on the left, and tables in between. We were seated immediately at the bar and we were served by an attractive host with a smile that mesmerized us. She showed us which ramen she recommended (kimchi ramen) and left for us to decide, but we spent more time debating whether she is half Asian or full.We tried their beer tap which was Belgium white wheat beer and it was really great and smooth. The gyoza we ordered for appetizers came in 6 pieces. The goyza is filled with a small amount of hot soup, pork with green onions and I recommend eating with caution and take one bite at a time than eating it with one bite. The menu is quite simple with 4 ramen options. Chuko's specialty is the kimchi ramen. I tried it and it was absolutely delicious! Filled with relatively spicy and rich soup base, chewy and curly ramen noodles, ground pork, a perfectly molten whole egg, and topped with diced lettuce on top. It really hit the spot. For me, the most important part of the ramen is the soup base and I loved it. Even though I not a huge fan of spicy food, I highly recommend trying this!  The other ramen we ordered is the pork bone soup ramen. The broth was rich and flavorful, with straight noodles, thin slices of pork, seaweed, and half of a molten egg. I tried this one my second visit and found it to be just as delicious as the kimchi ramen.The service was awesome! The only downside is that this place is cash only, with a ATM near the restroom with a high service fee charge. I recommend to bring enough cash for a good meal!",4.0
There is always a line outside and a wait. Good thing there is a bar across the street. They will text you when the table is ready. The appetizers is EVERYTHING here.  The crispy Brussels sprouts were amazing. Surprisingly packed with flavor. I also loved their agedashi tofu. The broth was done just right and they used the right toppings too. Krispy kale and pork belly bao was unique and different. Ordered their pork bone ramen. Broth was bland and my soft boiled egg was flavorless. Texture of noodle was good. They used thick chunks of pork belly. Confused as to the kind of veggies they used (had a pickled taste) so it changed the taste of my broth slightly Solid 3.5 stars. will return to eat the apps again but not the ramen.  It's too trendy and American style.,3.0
"SO GOOD! We had to wait a little over an hour for a table for 2, but it was well worth it. The sticky buns were a bit pricy but delicious - tried both the shrimp and pork.  Thumbs up for the chicken wings too!  I tried the chicken ramen and my date had the pork - both excellent! Service was great as well.  Will definitely be coming back and can't wait to check out Bar Chuko! YUM.",4.0
"This place is nice! Small place, limited seating but service was good and food was good.Ramen is cooked nicely, although it was nothing special it was a decent ramen. Pork bun was nice, although a little pricey. Brussel sprouts... well ehh i dont like brussel sprouts so i shouldnt review  it hahaOverall its a good vibe, modern decor. Nothing that special to make me HAVE TO come back to this place, but if in the area id come back",4.0

"3 stars for the ramen.1 star for the service.This place doesn't even hold a candle to MU Ramen, where the ramen is 10x better and service is great and not so rushed.Service at Chuko is totally RUSHED to the point of being uncomfortable. Five of us dropped $200 bucks on ramen (believe it or not) they took our ramen away before we finished, our drinks before we finished them, and even the tip we were leaving right out of my hand. The Asian waitress even smashed my finger with a chair while noticeably upset that we sat for a few minutes while digesting our food. As for them ramen, it's good, but definitely not worth a 1-2 hour wait. The ramen was very contrived and did not blow any of us away. (Maybe that's because we eat at the extraordinary MU ramen all the time) Wake up Brooklyn, the ramen is not worth such an insane wait!For now we will stick to the classics like ippudo or Ivan or MU if we don't want to the treated like cattle. Or physically abused.",2.0
"Chuko is the first place I can remember succumbing to the whole kale craze. Sure, these days, kale is more basic/widely accepted than Taylor Swift.* And the Kale Salad at Chuko may be partially deep-fried. But still. It's this little bowl of kale two ways (fresh and tempura), golden raisins, crispy sweet potato chips, and miso drizzle that has most people at a ramen spot talking. When the dish is done, try and tell yourself you couldn't take down a few more orders. It's that good.The ramen itself is crave-worthy, as well, which should be more expected than the kale given Japanese noodles is Chuko's bread and butter. My go-to is the Miso - on paper, a standard mix of egg, scallion, corn, and roasted pork (super salty, how I like it). But it's the broth that really makes or breaks a big bowl of ramen for me, and with this pick, it's always the same, wonderful experience. I swear, it evolves throughout my meal, kind of like Violet Beauregarde's three-course gum, except I don't get rolled out of the room like a giant blueberry when it's over (even if I feel that way). What I mean is that is has this chameleon-like quality to improve whilst I take it down, as it blends with the other ingredients - the base here becomes creamier with the egg, sweeter with the corn, and obviously spicier with the addition of the sidecar of chili oil with garlic chips. Tossed with perfectly cooked, no-clump noodles, this is some magical ramen.I'd also suggest the Pork Bone offering, if you'd instead prefer some wood ear mushrooms and thinner noodles. The Crispy Brussels with peanuts and fish sauce is another appetizer of fried deliciousness. And I almost always order a bottle of Hitachino Nest White Ale here, since it's an easy favorite of mine amongst Japanese beers, and happens to pair well with a pipin' hot bowl o' ramen.Despite the fact that Chuko means ""vintage"" in Japanese, the restaurant is actually very modern, minimalist, clean. And seemingly always packed. Expect lengthy waits at peak hours (though they'll text you when your table is ready, in case you want to grab a drink somewhere else on Vanderbilt). And finally: cash only.While this isn't my hood, I still claim Chuko as my ramen spot. Like I have some kind of homefield ramen advantage here. And so far, we're working on a perfect record.*Hey, Tay.",5.0

"This Prospect Heights restaurant serves one of the better ramen in Brooklyn, and they do pretty well with everything else they serve.  Opened by a team formerly of Morimoto, it shows in the quality and consistency of the food.Chuko holds a corner space on increasingly trafficked Vanderbilt, its small dining room flooded with natural light by day.  Casual and low-key, but too sleek and polished to ever be mistaken for a greasy spoon.  A few specials are detailed on the large blackboard above the bar, which incidentally isn't much of a bar but offers dining seats for solo folks.  It just barely adds to the very concise menu: a handful of ""Snacks,"" slightly larger ""Bites,"" and the ramen choices.  Is brevity an issue?  The variety is just right, and a pick from each section is more than enough for most.  But the core menu stays much the same, so it won't take too many visits to have the full run of the menu, possibly just one with enough people in a group.  But a ramen joint need not aim ambitiously, and I could be back quite often for the very same bowl of ramen.The excellent ramen noodles are from Sun Noodle.  Springy and toothsome and hard to get enough of; some are wavy and others the thin, straight type. They do miso and soy ramen, served with a decent roast pork, or steamed chicken, which I've not tried, and those lovely hard boiled eggs with soft, semi-runny yolk.  Good versions of these classic ramen, with a nice clarity of flavor in the broth, although they fall short of sublime.  There's a spicy ramen with kimchi and ground pork, spicy enough for those who like heat but not punishing in the least.   A steadfast veggie version rounds out the regulars.  A tasty, housemade hot chili oil with garlic adds good flavor to just about everything.A brothless mazemen is often a special.  The mentaiko version may be my favorite, and I like it more than the soup ramen.  A great version with quality ingredients, refreshing with pops of that tantalizing umami flavor.The snacks and bites aren't especially inventive, but most are done well, such as simple, satisfying pork gyoza with supple skin and a nice, seared bottom, or freshly fried chicken wings seasoned with just salt, pepper, and a spritz of lime juice.  Crispy fried Brussels Sprouts are doused in a spicy fish sauce vinaigrette, a la Momofuku, and is a riot of flavors.  A steamed bun filled with fried shrimp, shredded cabbage, and a tangy garlic aioli was decent, but didn't quite come together enough for great.Sapporo premium and two Coedo beers by the bottle, a rotating domestic on tap, and a handful of sake for adult beverages.  Goes nicely with the food, which they seem suited for.My favorite place to have a casual, satisfying bowl of ramen in Brooklyn, the soy ramen edging out the rest if they don't happen to have mazeman on offer.  It gets crowded quick so head over earlier to avoid, and bring cash.",4.0

The noodle was the noodle you can get from the grocery store for less than a dollar. No spice, no vinegar, no taste... Veggie miso came with lots of this cheap noodle, one egg, couple of pumpkin like cubes and a tiny bit of cabbage pieces. You pay $14 for this tasteless so called ""ramen"". Ugh!Plus, we sat on the window bar and it was so sticky and dirty!!!",1.0
"Love this place to death.  Best ramen I've ever tasted. The waitresses are total sweethearts (except for one sour douche who literally slid a drink at me across the bar--not cool)ACHTUNG: CHUKO MANAGEMENT Seriously cash only is for amateurs and you guys basically have a license to print money at this point.  And having an on premises ATM that charges a fee is just kick in the balls.  You're actually turning a profit from not accommodating your customers--once again, not cool.",4.0
"This place seriously rocks. Don't screw up!! Get the miso ramen. It's definitely not a traditional bowl, which I'm usually against, but this time it's different. This bowl of miso ramen is an amazing interpretation. The broth is perfect. It's a slightly unusual taste at first, but as you get into it, you start to understand the depth of the flavor and the care that went into making it (these guys are pros, seriously, google it). By the end of the bowl you start to question your sanity, considering how your date would respond if you ordered a second bowl. The shame, the regret, the delicious gluttony of it all. This bowl is basically the Turkish Delight (Narnia reference, kids) of ramen. It's the only bowl of ramen I'll drive to Brooklyn for. A+++++ would eat again.Also: cash only (ATM inside), the wait can suck, go at weird times.",5.0
Delicious! Always always delicious.,5.0
This is a pretty good spot all around and the best one I have had in Brooklyn. Pork bone broth is good but I really liked spicy miso. They give a good amount for extra noodle orders too. Haven't had a chance to try all the appetizers but they're a bit pricy compared to the amount you get for the noodles.,4.0
The best japanese ramen in NYC!!! The miso ramen is the must try!,4.0
"I've been to many ramen places all over NYC and I gotta say, Chuko Ramen is probably my #1. (Yes, better than Totto and Ippudo!) every time I go there I have an amazing experience. The Kimchi ramen is extremely good!!!!! It's not too spicy, not too kimchi-ey, it's perfect! The waitors and waitresses are also ways exceptionally friendly and they seem happy to be working there. We went once right when they were about to close and they let us sit at the bar and take our time to finish our food, and even gave us extra noodles even after the kitchen was closed!

"It took me over a year to step into Chuko despite living down the street and loving ramen. One, because there was always a line and two, I lived in Japan for a few years so part of me wanted to disbelieve the hype. Great ramen should be a solitary experience in which a man/woman can reflect upon the depths of his soul... by looking deeply in a bowl of scalding yet soothing noodles... get lost... be found... feel satiated and become complete...So anyway I was walking by and finally decided to try it. It was almost 11pm but I still had to wait 15 minutes for a seat at the bar. The service was brisk and personable. I got the tonkotsu ramen which was indeed very well balanced and the hit of garlic chili oil made it something really special. I'll be stopping in more often so I guess I'll just have to put up with the waiting.",4.0
"I'm not sure I've ever left a restaurant in tears.  But I did so last night.  As many have reviewed, the food at Chuko is fantastic.  And they are correct.  It's fantastic.  Which is why I've been about five times now.  Each time, the food was great, but there was something slightly off about the service.  I would return again hoping that maybe it was just an off day for the staff or maybe I was just making up how I was feeling.  Because each time I went, I felt really dismissed as a customer, especially a solo customer.  Which is funny because as a frequent solo diner, I really enjoy ramen shops as they are often perfect for a solo eater.  I always understood there would be a wait at Chuko .  The wait was never the issue.  The issue was how dismissive the staff was to me as a customer.On last night's trip to Chuko, despite a fairly empty restaurant after 8:30, I was directed to a seat by both the window and right next to the door (which does have a curtain to protect from draft).  And a radiator on full blast.  When the host walked by a few minutes later I mentioned how hot it was and her reply was ""yeah I know"" before walking away.After more minutes passed, another employee came over to ask if I had been waiting long.  She sounded concerned.  When I expressed that I had and that I was also fairly uncomfortable in my current seat, she did try to find me another but to no luck.  It was then that my overall frustration with the restaurant just came pouring out and I sighed and mentioned how disappointed I was with the service during my visits.  At this time, the employee said she was the manager and would like to know more about my experiences.  She then seemed shocked to learn that despite my experiences with the service, I had continued to come back.  She almost demanded to know why I would bother coming back if I didn't like them.  To which I replied that it is my nature to try to give things a few chances, because everyone has a bad day.  It didn't seem strange in the least to me that I would try it a few times to see if things changed or if an employee was just having an off day.  But she seemed shocked and almost appalled at this notion, as if I was just asking for it to have a bad experience.She then switched back to seeming to be concerned with what exactly had been wrong with my experiences.  At this point, though,  I could feel all of her defenses up and wished I had just left then but I really was hoping there would be a some sort of resolution.  I told her that I often felt dismissed as a solo diner and that as a frequent ramen eater and frequent solo diner, this was really upsetting.  She told me that this was just how I was feeling and had nothing to do with how I was treated by the staff.  That basically I was internalizing it.  She was quite condescending. I couldn't believe it.  She then continued to basically berate me trying to get more out of me on why I didn't ""like them.""  Throughout, she reminded me that it was a small restaurant and that there would always be a wait and there was nothing they could do about that.  Which was odd because I had not once complained about a wait.It seemed nothing I said would work for her so I finally said that maybe I should just go.  She said ""maybe you should"" and she walked away as I gathered my things in tears.  Again, I've never ever been made to feel like that dining out.  I LOVE dining out.  I LOVE dining out alone.  I LOVE ramen.  But I also like having a pleasant and respectful dining experience.  I don't think that's too much to ask.  In the end, I seemed to have been practically kicked out for trying to give some feedback.  I understand that some restaurants are brisk and efficient.  But there is a difference between being brisk and being rude.  I respect a manager that stands up for her employees but I do not respect a manager that has no intention whatsoever of bettering a customer's experience.

This kale salad is special. It's tangy, crispy, crunchy, and savory with a hint of sweetness from the golden raisins that gather at the bottom of the bowl. The creamy miso dressing pleasantly coats the bits of fried kale and sweet potato, which add plenty of texture to the fresh kale itself, and I almost ordered another as soon as I tasted it.

The egg (which I think you can ask for it poached vs soft boiled) was cooked the perfect amount with the gooey yellow but the egg is not seasoned at all.

"The food is delicious, but given the cramped space and the lines it's often too much trouble to go. Only attempt it if it's 15 minutes before it opens for lunch or dinner; then you can walk right in.

"the best kale salad ever.  it's got sweet potato crunch, kale pieces both crunch & tender, sweetness of golden raisins, and overall just damed deliciousness.  It's money well spent.  Trust me.i was also skeptical of the vegetarian ramen...but i went with it and got roasted pork to top off.  the broth is deeply umami richi, as it is made out of kombu-miso,  All around delicious. the noodles were slightly chewy, and made of egg noodles, which is not the traditional wheat.  i could have done without the pork buns...a little too mayo-ish for me, and the pork was dressed plainly.  i'm used to the taste of bbq when it comes to these buns.the restaurant is pretty tiny and be prepared to wait...we got there relatively early, so the wait was only 30 min, so not bad at all.  solid eats in BK esp when it comes to good ramen, where evidently is too much of a shortage...considering the insane long lines everywhere!",4.0
My favorite ramen place in all of NYC. I love the pork belly ramen with the vegetable broth base. I've been here at least 10 times and always get the same thing! I also love the kale salad. And you have to get the sake that comes in little panda glasses you can take home!,5.0
"I knew this place was popular so I decided to try it when I discovered this block that is near my house with all the bars and restaurants. I never knew it existed! I love ramen places, although when I came to Chuko I just wanted some appetizers and alcohol. The place is cute and on the smaller side and they have a decent size bar in there. I was a little disappointed with the menu. Their schtick is supposed to be ramen and small plates but there were not many choices for small plate food. We just got the chicken wings and shishito peppers. I love the peppers, they were marinated and roasted, a little crunchy and had a nice tang to it. The chicken wings were really good but they only give you four little pieces. I got one of the sakes for my drink. It was good, creamy and on the sweeter side.I think this place would be really awesome if there were more small plate choices on the menu and if the priced matched the portions. They were way too expensive for teeny amounts of food.",3.0
I went here on a date and sat at the bar because the restaurant was full and there was a wait! We didn't mind because the bartender was super sweet and very knowledgeable.

You just can't stop eating after the 1st piece. Then we had the salt and pepper chicken wings that were made to order.  They were still sizzling hot and steaming when served.  The skin is crispy and the inside is perfectly cooked - tender and juicy.The miso ramen is served in a thick miso soup with wavy noodles, along with an onsen tamgo (egg), perfectly cooked - very soft and just cooked enough to take shape.  I also like how small pumpkin pieces are added in to insert just a tad of sweet flavor to the ramen. One minor nitpick is that the pumpkin could have been cooked to a softer texture.  The pork bone ramen is served with a rich tonkotsu broth with thin noodles and a soft boiled egg, along with some shredded wood ear and other vegetables. The broth is not too thick and not too oily.  It was a good match with the thin noodles. The soy ramen with thin noodles has the lightest broth, and comes with soft boiled egg and marinated bamboo shoot.You can choose roasted pork, ground meat or steamed chicken for each bowl of ramen.  We all chose roasted pork and it was one of the best two pieces of roasted pork I had in ramen.

I'm so glad we actually came early because once 5:45PM came, the whole place was filled up with a long waiting list. Phew* lucky us! We ordered the shrimp & pork buns and kimchi ramen. Shrimp buns were really good but the pork, which I thought was not that great. It tasted kind of weird. The kimchi ramen was savory, a bit spicy and very filling. I forgot to mention, the noodles were al dente! Yes! Love the chewiness! Good thing we were warned beforehand to mix the soup base because there were tiny pieces of grounded pork on the very bottom (Thanks Bonnie).

Not sure what is going on with quality control here? I love Chuko but I'm scared to eat the food after two bad experiences in a row. Hope they can the quality back up because it is usually delicious.",2.0
Food here is absolutely fantastic. A wonderful alternative to some of the treats Momofuku and Ivan dish out in Manhattan. Huge plus is the ability to wait at many of the local bars for the text message telling you your table it ready. Who can't enjoy that.,5.0
Wow! Best ramen in the city!! So yummy. Pros: the ramen!!! Yummy! So good especially in a cold night! The sake is really good too!! The little one in a glass jar with all the pandas on it is my favorite.Cons: cash only! It's weird because Bar Chuko down the street accepts credit cards. Tips: get there early and leave your name! It takes awhile to get a table! Owners tip: open one in Manhattan!! :),5.0
"i loved the pork buns at chuko ramen. the pork belly comes without any dressing/marinade on the actual meat itself but the buns have a slather of spicy mayo which compliments the meat perfectly without overpowering it. heaven. when you pick up the bun and take a bite, the juicy fat from the meat runs down your hands... its truly amazing. the ramen was delicious as well. the first bite i had tasted like a whole thanksgiving meal. all the best flavors combined in one bite but it needed a little more salt. to me, its really the saltiness of ramen broth that helps cut through the rich flavors so you can keep eating and eating. eventually towards the end of the meal, i started getting not sick but... ""tired"" of the richness of the broth.",4.0

"I had been wanting to try Chuko for a very long time and last night, I finally did.  Being in the upper 30s, windy and rainy, it was basically perfect ramen weather.  I went with a group of 4 and we were seated after about a 10 min wait at 6:30 on a Friday.  Not bad.The place is small, and popular, so if you come at peak hours, expect a bit of a wait.  Luckily, there's no shortage of watering holes in the area, so you can certainly head off to another local establishment to wet your whistle while you wait for your table.  The menu is simple and relatively limited.  We started with the kale salad, pork buns, gyoza (special) and brussels sprouts.  All were really delicious.  I love pork buns, and they are very well done here.  The kale salad was great, with a delicious and savory miso dressing.The ramen here deserves the accolades it gets.  I am not going to wax on about who's is the best, who's isn't very good, who's is overrated or otherwise, but I can tell you that the ramen here is much more sophisticated, complex and delicious than the ramen served at my house.  Among us, we had the veggie, the soy and the kimchi.  All were very good on their own merits.  The veggie, like many have stated, is delicious.  The broth is outstanding and full of flavor.  The soy was good, but probably the least interesting to me.  The kimchi (w/ ground pork) had some nice kick and a hearty, savory base.  To top it all, the portions are significant, so you likely won't be leaving here hungry.The prices are reasonable, and the beverage menu is limited, so you probably won't get into too much trouble here.  Very friendly and accommodating staff, and relaxed environs.  It's a tight space, so not really recommended for parties greater than 2-4.  Overall, I really enjoyed it and would recommend.",4.0

"Chuko is terrific - maybe not the best ramen in the city, but definitely the best in this part of Brooklyn. I've been there a couple times and have always come away impressed and satisfied. Today I tried the veggie miso (as recommended by my server) and it definitely exceeded my expectations. The broth was hearty and rich and the noodles were cooked perfectly so that they were springy, not soggy. All of the toppings were excellent as well, even the squash, which I have to admit I'm not a huge fan of normally, but in this ramen it worked. I recommend getting it with and egg, roasted pork, and their chili oil, which has heat and a nice garlicky bite to it. I also had the spicy pickles as an appetizer and they were fantastic. In the past, I've had their miso, pork bone, and kimchi ramens and their gyoza, all of which are awesome. Service is friendly and the atmosphere is laid back. I highly suggest you try this place if you're in the neighborhood. Just try and get there on the early side, since the wait can be pretty ridiculous, especially on the weekend.",4.0
"I'll be the first to admit I've been skeptical of the whole recent fancy ramen trend, but Chuko may have changed my mind.First off, prepare to wait. We walked in on a Sunday night around 6:45, gave a name/number, and was quoted a 1.5 to 2 hour estimate for a group of 3. So we went elsewhere in the neighborhood for some drinks (great neighborhood for that) and almost exactly 2 hours later, we got the call.We were seated immediately and placed our orders. The special of the night was a pork bone ramen with a choice of chicken or pork. The three of us all ordered it with pork.But first, we started out with Brussels sprouts and pork buns. The Brussels sprouts were charred perfectly and topped with spicy pickled green peppers. Pretty damn good. The waitress told us beforehand that the buns were smaller than usual so it was $3 instead of $5. They were still pretty standard size (not sure we would've paid $5 each for a pork bun otherwise). The pork itself definitely tasted like it was marinated (something a lot of ""fusion"" places forget about) and was doused in some good orange chili mayo sauce.They also have three kinds of canned sake available. We ordered the regular, and the more aged one. I liked the regular one more as it didn't have as much bite, but both were a good complement to the meal (and served cold).Now, onto the ramen. I'll have to echo the sentiments of everyone who loved the garlic chili oil. I could eat that stuff forever (if I didn't care about my breath).The ramen itself was interesting. It was more reminiscent of wonton noodles from Chinatown than ramen. A little chewier and more rubbery. The pork bone broth was delicious. A bit heavier than other ramen broth I've had, but that's not at all a bad thing. It came with two slices of fatty pork and a halved egg. In context, everything worked well together. It was definitely a case of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts. And yes, to quell my oft-thought criticism of ramen, the bowl was big enough to leave me full.Our waitresses were both very nice. One of them came by and apologized for our ramen taking a long time because she caught me looking toward the kitchen (it actually wasn't taking that long; I was just checking her out).Though at the end of the meal, we were basically rushed out. Our waitress handed us the check before we could ask for it (or anything else). To be fair, they don't offer desserts anymore, but maybe we wanted another beer? As soon as a different waiter took our cash, he came back a minute later and told us he had another party waiting for our table that he promised they would be seated before a certain time. We were still drinking our sake, so that was a bit rude. I don't think he consulted our waitress at all about how we were doing.So basically, the food was good, and I'd give them 3.5 stars if it were possible. They lose half a star for each of the three reasons:1) The 2 hour wait for a table.2) Not accepting credit cards.3) Being kicked out.But I'm feeling nice, so I'll round up to 4 (and also because they were playing some kickass 90s music while we were there).",4.0

"My wife (who lived many years in Japan) and I have tried a lot of ramen places in NYC, and this is by far one of our favorites. The ramen noodle consistency was perfect, the broths flavorful and the ingredients fresh. The crispy brussel sprouts ""bites"" were to die for. They have Sapporo beer on tap, and serve sake and wine as well. The place is small, and only takes cash. However, it is hard to exceed $50 for two unless your drink a lot.

"I forgot to review this from when I went in June. Luckily, I checked in on Yelp to remind myself later. My sister and I came up to Brooklyn, NY to visit a friend and he brought us here for ""the best Ramen in the area"". Now...in DC I'm only familiar with Pho (and I'm a HUGE pho fanatic) and he said it was similar so I was down. The place is really small and he said there's always a wait...which I didn't mind because I'll wait for anything that's supposed to be the best. We get in maybe thirty minutes later...the menu is really simple. Basically five ramen soups to choose from and they have a special ramen for the day. The broths vary in degree of strength. i believe miso (or veggie) is the lightest broth and soy is the strongest in flavor. There's also a Kimchi ramen that i was afraid to try because I don't rock with Kimchi like that (I mean...it's old ass cabbage) and there's a pork belly ramen and veggie. My friend suggested the soy ramen so that's what I went with. My sister picked the Kimchi because it was supposed to be spicy.Our food arrives quickly and smells great. My soy ramen had soy broth, smoked pork, noodles, maybe some onions (don't remember) and a soft boiled egg. The broth isn't the same as pho broth. This broth was way darker and more dense in consistency but not slimy like egg drop or hot and sour soup (which I HATE with a passion...keep that half ass jello broth away from me bro) and the serving bowl isn't nearly as large. This broth could stand on its own in flavor whereas with pho they give you basil, jalapenos, bean sprouts and lime to accompany your dish. Would I prefer ramen over pho? Hell nah...Pho for life; however, I really enjoyed my ramen...and even ate most of the egg. I'm not a fan of runny yolk so I worked around it. Whenever I decide to go back to New York I'll definitely hit this spot again and try the miso or veggie ramen.",4.0

"Modern spin on traditional Japanese Izakaya snacks that are all homeruns, great sochu cocktails (happy hour $3 what?!) and the service was professional but laid back. Highly recommend but get there early because it fills up quick",5.0
"Chuko is terrific - maybe not the best ramen in the city, but definitely the best in this part of Brooklyn. I've been there a couple times and have always come away impressed and satisfied. Today I tried the veggie miso (as recommended by my server) and it definitely exceeded my expectations. The broth was hearty and rich and the noodles were cooked perfectly so that they were springy, not soggy. All of the toppings were excellent as well, even the squash, which I have to admit I'm not a huge fan of normally, but in this ramen it worked. I recommend getting it with and egg, roasted pork, and their chili oil, which has heat and a nice garlicky bite to it. I also had the spicy pickles as an appetizer and they were fantastic. In the past, I've had their miso, pork bone, and kimchi ramens and their gyoza, all of which are awesome. Service is friendly and the atmosphere is laid back. I highly suggest you try this place if you're in the neighborhood. Just try and get there on the early side, since the wait can be pretty ridiculous, especially on the weekend.",4.0
"I'll be the first to admit I've been skeptical of the whole recent fancy ramen trend, but Chuko may have changed my mind.First off, prepare to wait. We walked in on a Sunday night around 6:45, gave a name/number, and was quoted a 1.5 to 2 hour estimate for a group of 3. So we went elsewhere in the neighborhood for some drinks (great neighborhood for that) and almost exactly 2 hours later, we got the call.We were seated immediately and placed our orders. The special of the night was a pork bone ramen with a choice of chicken or pork. The three of us all ordered it with pork.But first, we started out with Brussels sprouts and pork buns. The Brussels sprouts were charred perfectly and topped with spicy pickled green peppers. Pretty damn good. The waitress told us beforehand that the buns were smaller than usual so it was $3 instead of $5. They were still pretty standard size (not sure we would've paid $5 each for a pork bun otherwise). The pork itself definitely tasted like it was marinated (something a lot of ""fusion"" places forget about) and was doused in some good orange chili mayo sauce.They also have three kinds of canned sake available. We ordered the regular, and the more aged one. I liked the regular one more as it didn't have as much bite, but both were a good complement to the meal (and served cold).Now, onto the ramen. I'll have to echo the sentiments of everyone who loved the garlic chili oil. I could eat that stuff forever (if I didn't care about my breath).The ramen itself was interesting. It was more reminiscent of wonton noodles from Chinatown than ramen. A little chewier and more rubbery. The pork bone broth was delicious. A bit heavier than other ramen broth I've had, but that's not at all a bad thing. It came with two slices of fatty pork and a halved egg. In context, everything worked well together. It was definitely a case of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts. And yes, to quell my oft-thought criticism of ramen, the bowl was big enough to leave me full.Our waitresses were both very nice. One of them came by and apologized for our ramen taking a long time because she caught me looking toward the kitchen (it actually wasn't taking that long; I was just checking her out).Though at the end of the meal, we were basically rushed out. Our waitress handed us the check before we could ask for it (or anything else). To be fair, they don't offer desserts anymore, but maybe we wanted another beer? As soon as a different waiter took our cash, he came back a minute later and told us he had another party waiting for our table that he promised they would be seated before a certain time. We were still drinking our sake, so that was a bit rude. I don't think he consulted our waitress at all about how we were doing.So basically, the food was good, and I'd give them 3.5 stars if it were possible. They lose half a star for each of the three reasons:1) The 2 hour wait for a table.2) Not accepting credit cards.3) Being kicked out.But I'm feeling nice, so I'll round up to 4 (and also because they were playing some kickass 90s music while we were there).",4.0

Although very hesitant at first I must say.. WOW!! I'm Not the type of guy to go too far out of the box when it comes to food. Last week it happened to be super cold out and I was in the mood for soup leaving the Brooklyn museum and a friend recommended Chuko. I had been to a few Ramen places in the past and never really had good bowl of Ramen and was never too exited about it.. None the less it was freezing out and wanted some sort of soup.  You Will need to go early to get a seat or expect to wait outside.. there are usually long lines but if you get past the people elbowing for position thru the door you will experience good service and an AWESOME bowl of Ramen. So flavorful and rich is was almost luxurious especially after the egg in the Romen was mixed in... It was so delicious I went back the next day and brought my wife and she agreed. If you want Ramen and your in Brooklyn...This IS THE PLACE.Can't wait to go back.,5.0
The restaurant is really a nice cozy place.  I was seated right away once they opened for dinner.  I ordered my food right away because I had researched it earlier.  I started off with the pork bun.  It was good and I have tried pork buns at other places and this one was good.

"Nothing beats a bowl of ramen on a cold winter evening.

Like most popular ramen shops, the restaurant doesn't take reservations and there is no space to wait inside. The hostess did kindly redirect us to a bar across the street to pass the time. I hope Chuko gets a kickback for all the business they direct to the bar :)Besides serving up umami-infused bowls of ramen, Chuko also offers delicious vegetable appetizers that you don't usually see in ramen shops.- Tonkotsu ramen - This was actually a special of the day, so if it's available when you go, definitely order it. The pork charshu is nicely seared and falls apart when you pick it up. The thin noodles were chewy and the pork broth thick and flavorful, and I drank every last drop. The ramen also comes with a poached egg - AWESOME! I'm always sad when I have to pay extra for an egg at other ramen shops.- Steam pork bun with chili mayo - Fatty pork galore :Q. Loved the slight kick from the chili mayo. Only disappointment was that the bun kind of falls apart when you pick it up. It needs to better withstand that juicy fatty pork!- Crispy brussels with fish sauce and peanuts - Delightfully crispy but a bit on the greasy side. The fish sauce/brussel sprouts combination is irresistible - you won't be able to eat just one.- Kale salad with crispy sweet potato and raisins - Another vegetable winner!

"Bottom line, the food is very good, and if you're in the neighborhood there is no reason for you to not check it out. That being said, if you're from jersey like myself, its not really good enough to travel all the way to Brooklyn, there are places in jersey that are cheaper and just as good. Got an order of the miso ramen, gyoza, and brussel sprouts.Apparently the veggie ramen is all the rage, but im a miso guy. The noodles - really tasty, probably some of the best ive ever had. The broth on the other hand as a bit lacking, but still very tasty.Gyoza, was a little soft for my liking, im by no means terrible with chop sticks, but they're were a little difficult to pick up.The brussel sprouts though, let me tell you, I never in a million years would have thought that you could have brussel sprouts anything other than meh, but these were unfreaking believable. I believe they are roasted than sautéed with garlic. If i was just chilling, I would haven no issue casually eating them. And again, Im talking about brussel sprouts.Final AnalysisReal solid joint, definitely check out if you're in the neighborhood. The place looks more like a hip joint that serves ramen, rather than a traditional restaurant. They dont take reservations, and theres normally an hour wait, so if you do want to go, get there early, and put your name and phone number down. - they'll call you when your table is ready",4.0
"There's certain things I look for in ramen spots. And my main one is VARIETY! I dislike going to places that have like 3 types of ramen soups, about two appetizers, and a special of the day. Chuko, had that menu. Okay, maybe they had more than 3 types of ramen (about 4 or 5), there wasn't much else. Yes, their fried chicken wings are the bomb, especially dipped in their heavenly chili garlic oil, but for me I need something else! They had pork buns which I didn't try, okay, but that's not a meal. I need rice. I need a nice little rice dish.  Naruto Ramen on the other hand offers all types of ramen, rice dishes and appetizers. I had the speed ill of the day at Chuko, which was ""Mazeman"". Curly egg noodles with scallions and some herbs mixed with cod row and served warm. It was okay for me. The row gave it kind of creamy texture which was nice, but after a while kinda got me nauseated. And the flavor had to much of a lime/lemon flavor. I also tried the pork bone ramen. It was nice. Light in flavor,  could have used more seasoning.  But they do give a lot of pork!  Once you add the chili garlic oil, definitely adds more flavor to the soup. Everything was decent. But I craved more and left a still hungry! I will probably return to give it a other go and try other things on the menu.3 stars for the menu, but the waiters get 5! Super nice, friendly,  and very informative!",3.0
"My yak and I went the other night. Wait was around 45 minutes. Not too bad at all. They use that dope-ass app that let's you know you're place in line which got our night off to a really tech'd out start and kept my yak from flappin' her jaw about ""how much longer!?"" I just flash the app to her and then she stops her whining. Anyway, food was pretty good. We ordered a few of the apps on special which did the job. We split a bowl of the pork ramen which was pretty good too. Kind of hard to judge other than the fact that the bartender was really feeling himself. Really fancied himself a cool dude who possibly had better things to do with his Saturday night. That irked us a bit but not so much where we won't go back in there to try the other ramens. We just will try not to sit at the bar where the guy was really flashing some serious, grade-A smugness. But hey, not the restaurant's fault. They can't keep tabs on all their employees attitudes at all times. It's just a good example and reminder to me that good, friendly, helpful, no-attitude service really can be a difference maker.

"Omg my friend brought me here for a late dinner and had raved about the kale salad. We both ordered a plate. It was really good, with a miso/ponzu style dressing and battered, fried kale globules that were divine. I ordered the vegetarian ramen which was AMAZING. I actually think it was better than the veggie ramen I had in LA at Orochon and that was already delicious. The soup was unctuous, deep, rich and everything ramen broth should be. I am almost a little skeptical that its vegetarian - that's how good it was. Our ramen was a bit slow coming and my friend inquired about it. Turns out the order didn't get in. Our server apologized and comped our salad which was so thoughtful. I didn't think we were too inconvenienced so that was so above and beyond I had to recognize the service. Great spot, no lines, and definitely the best veggie ramen I've had to date. Wow can't believe that title lies in BK, not LA.",5.0
"I am usually against cash only places but this place was totally worth it. The veggie miso was friggin amazing and the kale salad is out of this world. The staff was super friendly. The atmosphere is small but gets loud pretty fast. Best to get there early so you wont have to wait at the bar. Not that there is a problem with the bar, but im not much of a drinker. But i would highly recommend the IPA (i dont remember the name)",4.0
"Great food, decent price, and even though the wait was an estimated 2-2.5 hours on a Saturday night at 8pm, we stuck it out at the Bar Chuko across the street and all was well.

"Decor is pretty cool, waitress was super cute and spot on with holding down the fort, kale salad (as promised from the other reviewers) was great, ramen...not so much.First, slightly disappointed that no tea can be found, but I lived. Got a bottle of Hitachino White for a little something refreshing as a backup. I've been curious about Chuko's ramen, but had a late lunch, so shared an order of agedashi and ordered the kale salad as my main.Orders are brought out as they're ready, it seems (if that matters for anyone), so my ramen-otaku friend's miso ramen came out first. I will say it looks stunning. I had a few slurps of broth which started out interesting in a good way, but by the time my friend made it near the end, it got very...texturey. Like the miso was improperly mixed or came from powder. Which was weird. We also thought it was a little weird that it came with cabbage? I've never seen that in a ramen. I didn't mind it, but definitely a surprise. Corn looked raw, and friend said it was cold. Didn't try the pork or egg, but as delicious as it looked, friend said those were lukewarm as well. Most disappointing of all - and could have saved the ramen if it had been better - were the ramen noodles. It tasted like they ordered their ramen from the same place Ochado does...slightly plasticky-sealed bag tasting. Which is disappointing.The kale salad is the miso ginger dressing that most sushi places drench atop their salads, but lightly tossed with the kale, allowing it to somehow cut through any of the bad taste of the plant. They also cooked (boil?) it perfectly so you don't feel like a rabbit munching in leaves. It's topped with sweet potato slices, some raisins and surprise tempura-fried kale pieces. Pretty yummy!Agedashi was pretty great as well. A tad too salty for our tastes (still definitely edible), but the fried breading on the outside (and flavor) was deeelicious.Basically, not a place I'd recommend for ramen, but some other gems can be found.",3.0

"I came here to try the vegetarian ramen, which A and I weren't impressed with but their chicken wings, shrimp and pork buns, and age tofu get the thumbs up. I definitely regret getting their brussels sprouts, which were way overly flavorful and salty. Maybe their pork broth ramen is better but I wouldn't make the far trek out here again and much prefer the ramen noodles from other places like Jin Ramen.",3.0
"As a vegetetarian, I am limited with my ramen options.  Compares to Ippudo or Totto, the misobroth with the garlic chili oil added was perfect.  Creamy, not salty amd flavorful. The noodles from Sun were perfect and the right chew. This is definitely my favorite ramen place. I am opening up a business a few blocks down so am happy to patron this place in the future. I got their at 12 pm sharp on a Wednesday and I was the first. Yay.",5.0
"Bottom line, the food is very good, and if you're in the neighborhood there is no reason for you to not check it out. That being said, if you're from jersey like myself, its not really good enough to travel all the way to Brooklyn, there are places in jersey that are cheaper and just as good. Got an order of the miso ramen, gyoza, and brussel sprouts.Apparently the veggie ramen is all the rage, but im a miso guy. The noodles - really tasty, probably some of the best ive ever had. The broth on the other hand as a bit lacking, but still very tasty.Gyoza, was a little soft for my liking, im by no means terrible with chop sticks, but they're were a little difficult to pick up.The brussel sprouts though, let me tell you, I never in a million years would have thought that you could have brussel sprouts anything other than meh, but these were unfreaking believable. I believe they are roasted than sautéed with garlic. If i was just chilling, I would haven no issue casually eating them. And again, Im talking about brussel sprouts.Final AnalysisReal solid joint, definitely check out if you're in the neighborhood. The place looks more like a hip joint that serves ramen, rather than a traditional restaurant. They dont take reservations, and theres normally an hour wait, so if you do want to go, get there early, and put your name and phone number down. - they'll call you when your table is ready",4.0

Highly recommend.  Loved the fried kale & non fried mixed together, it was refreshing.  Didn't like the raisins but the husband seemed to love it. Miso Ramen with extra pork belly - it was decent, the broth was not overly salted like some places - thankfully. Kimchi Ramen - standard, w/ ground pork - this was a disappointment.  I can totally make a more killer one at home! Blah...  The ""noodle"" should be cooked for an added 3 mins.  What they served us was 'undercooked"" ramen, which is too al dente and never a good experience when you used your chopsticks and the silky noodles refuses to ""BEND"".   Again, I've had much better ramens.. especially in Tokyo, any bowl of ramen is better than this.   However, when in roam, still decent for a desperate meal.

"I ate here almost three weeks ago and I still cannot stop thinking about it.

The side of garlic they serve with the soups was so good I could have eaten it on it's own, but poured on top of the meat, it was heavenly. The noodles were thinner than most ramen I've had, but we're still super filling and cooked perfectly. The meat was tender, but still fell apart in your mouth with a perfect texture to complement the noodles and flavorful broth. The only bad thing about Chuko is the wait (the restaurant is small and not suitable for large parties). But!

I don't eat kale, don't really care for it that much but this kale salad is worth getting. Even for a carnivore such as myself. Next is their pork buns. Well worth the five bucks, this bad boy is super flavorful and will not disappoint. I also really enjoy their goyza, which can typically had off their menu specials. The Ramen dishes are pretty solid. Not the best I've had but overall pretty good. If you like something with a kick, like how I do, I suggest the Kimchi. Spicy broth with egg, noodles and pork.

"My most recent work travels brought me to the great big city isle, and on my free evening I had occasion to venture down to my favorite NYC borough to visit a friend. On his recommendation, I was fortunate enough to enjoy a late meal at Chuko, which, for anyone that has paid attention, is my kind of place.  I know many of you read the word ramen and flash back to your college years; late night cup of noodles that served primarily to sate the insatiable beer-crazed munchies that drove you to inhale all manner of things in your younger days that you would balk at now.  For the record: this is not the ramen of your youth.  And even if it were: would you really balk at it?  Don't most people occasionally enjoy the taste of nostalgia?  I'm not the man to ask, where ramen is concerned.  I spent all of my college calories on DP Dough.  I thoroughly enjoyed the kimchi ramen --- a steaming bowl of noodles with scallions, ground pork, and a fried egg thrown in for good measure.  Very good measure. Strong, spicy flavor and a nourishing meal, washed down with a cold Sapporo. There were some pretty good looking appetizers on the menu as well (steamed pork buns, spicy pickles, crispy sprouts) but we stuck with the ramen.  My friend ordered his go-to, the miso ramen, which was also delicious but, being a man that prefers his food with a little kick, it was kimchi or bust for me.This is a pretty tight spot but a long wait was made tolerable by the use of modern technology and alcohol.   They take down your cell phone number and encourage you to venture over to the bar across the street while you wait, Woodwork.  Great little bar with Empire IPA and Brooklyn Lager on draft.  A good one-two punch on a Thursday night.",4.0
BANGING bowl of ramen. Great chili sauce.,5.0
"First time trying mentaiko mazeman-style ramen, and I wanted to like it. The chef tops ramen noodles with bacon, cod roe, shiso, scallion, and yuzu. I decided to trust the chef and try it even though it sounded it like it would be salty. It was indeed too salty. The cod roe also gave it a sea-like flavor, which was strange. The dish was extremely heavy and the sauce was quite thick, even though the ingredients sounded sparse and light. I actually felt a bit nauseous two-thirds of the way through and couldn't finish it. The crispy brussels sprouts that everyone raves about were not bad, but not as crispy on the outside as I've had elsewhere. The name really raised my expectations, and unfortunately they weren't met. The kale salad was also good, but not the best I've ever had (try Darwin's Cafe in SF!)Cold noodles were a win, but quite Westernized with ham cubes, corn, tomato, and a dash of mustard on the side of the bowl. They were unfortunately sold out of tonkotsu (pork bone) broth on this particular Wednesday night around 9:30pm, which was unfortunate, because a) it's my favorite and b) it's supposed to be  the best broth they have.

"Damn this place is good.It's just a shame that you have to wait so long, but they do have a bar across the street for that now.  Better yet, just come toward the end of the evening so that you're only waiting for the next table to open up instead of the 20-30 person line you will likely find if you come during peak dinner hours.  Only problem with coming in later is that you may also miss out on the specials, which, I have discovered, are always worth trying, and what actually make each visit unique.  And for a place that does usually have a long wait, I gotta hand it to them- they do a great job of trying to get people in and out of there as efficiently as possible without compromising the quality of the food or making you feel rushed.I think by now I have tried the entire menu (only takes a handful of visits in order to do so).  The buns aren't the greatest in the world, but they are delicious, and I would recommend the shrimp bun if you want something different from your typical pork bun.  The brussels sprouts are also a great starter, and you can't go wrong with any of the ramens, which will take care of you in that way that only a perfect ramen soup can.They don't do takeout, which is a little annoying, but most annoying is that you can't even order extra food to take home with you.  They WILL pack up your leftovers and send you with a doggy bag, but if you try to order and take home something, they simply say no, which I just don't understand.",4.0

"Mmmmmm. Love this place. Can't get enough! Kale salad and shishito peppers are amazing. Perfect balance of spicesPork ramen is so delicious! The kind of pork that falls off the bone... broth is creamy and savory... just perfect! Mazeman ramen equally delicious but it has no soup base. Super tasty. My boyfriend ordered this on back to back visits at Chuko.Service was also excellent. Such friendly workers. They got us what we need when we needed it. Easy as pie. Only downside is that they are super busy, so you've got too wait your turn. Also, it's cash only. But hey, if there's no wait, there must be a reason why... no?",5.0
"My most recent work travels brought me to the great big city isle, and on my free evening I had occasion to venture down to my favorite NYC borough to visit a friend. On his recommendation, I was fortunate enough to enjoy a late meal at Chuko, which, for anyone that has paid attention, is my kind of place.  I know many of you read the word ramen and flash back to your college years; late night cup of noodles that served primarily to sate the insatiable beer-crazed munchies that drove you to inhale all manner of things in your younger days that you would balk at now.  For the record: this is not the ramen of your youth.  And even if it were: would you really balk at it?  Don't most people occasionally enjoy the taste of nostalgia?  I'm not the man to ask, where ramen is concerned.  I spent all of my college calories on DP Dough.  I thoroughly enjoyed the kimchi ramen --- a steaming bowl of noodles with scallions, ground pork, and a fried egg thrown in for good measure.  Very good measure. Strong, spicy flavor and a nourishing meal, washed down with a cold Sapporo. There were some pretty good looking appetizers on the menu as well (steamed pork buns, spicy pickles, crispy sprouts) but we stuck with the ramen.  My friend ordered his go-to, the miso ramen, which was also delicious but, being a man that prefers his food with a little kick, it was kimchi or bust for me.This is a pretty tight spot but a long wait was made tolerable by the use of modern technology and alcohol.   They take down your cell phone number and encourage you to venture over to the bar across the street while you wait, Woodwork.  Great little bar with Empire IPA and Brooklyn Lager on draft.  A good one-two punch on a Thursday night.",4.0
BANGING bowl of ramen. Great chili sauce.,5.0
"First time trying mentaiko mazeman-style ramen, and I wanted to like it. The chef tops ramen noodles with bacon, cod roe, shiso, scallion, and yuzu. I decided to trust the chef and try it even though it sounded it like it would be salty. It was indeed too salty. The cod roe also gave it a sea-like flavor, which was strange. The dish was extremely heavy and the sauce was quite thick, even though the ingredients sounded sparse and light. I actually felt a bit nauseous two-thirds of the way through and couldn't finish it. The crispy brussels sprouts that everyone raves about were not bad, but not as crispy on the outside as I've had elsewhere. The name really raised my expectations, and unfortunately they weren't met. The kale salad was also good, but not the best I've ever had (try Darwin's Cafe in SF!)Cold noodles were a win, but quite Westernized with ham cubes, corn, tomato, and a dash of mustard on the side of the bowl.

The meal arrived at the right, nice and hot temperature, and noodles were perfectly al dente.  The charshu was nicely seared, as hot as the rest of the ingredients, and fell apart when tapped with a spoon (I've had plenty in NYC was a cold, solid mass).  Chuko has the best charshu I've had at a  Brooklyn ramenya.The bowl is accompanied by a small bowl of home made raayu (oil, hot spices and in this case huge chunks of garlic).  That's great - Ganso doesn't have raayu at the table at all  (though I've never asked for any - their soup is complex enough that it doesn't need it).  Having it readily available is fortunate, because I found the soup itself to be overwhelmingly buttery.  The soup stocks at Totto and Ippudo look and taste they've been simmering with bones and ingredients for weeks; the stock at Chuko is just not as deep.  Dumping most of the raayu in made me happier, but I prefer to have ramen as it comes from the kitchen unadulterated when I'm having it the first time.The miso ramen also came with spinach (I think - it was green and spinach-y!), cabbage, and corn, which were all excellent. The draft beer tasted off.  I had a Sapporo, which wasn't as clean as I expect from a draft beer.  I would stick with a coke or something bottled next time.Service was quick and friendly.  No wait for a mid-week lunch.  Space is small but very comfortable.Chuko is certainly worth a visit, especially if you like butter ramen (which is an actual thing).  I will keep an eye on these guys and try again in a few months.",4.0

"This is the kind of place that makes me laugh at people who wait hours to get a taste of Ramen at places like Momofuku. Granted, I'm an unemployed piece of garbage who went there for lunch and can make no comparison as to which is busier, but in the end it's all about the food. NOT ME!I had the pork bone ramen and enjoyed my first couple of bites. Then, I put the chili garlic sauce in...whole new ball game. The broth was already delicious and with the added spice, it was doing unholy things to my tastebuds. I knew then, that this was not going to be a meal I'd forget. The one slight problem with it, was that I was seated next to a family of foodie nerds who kept describing each bite of their food. So, maybe I should have thrown some Hall & Oats on my iPod and tuned them out. But, I didn't have an iPod. What I had was a bowl full of succulent pork, noodles, very flavorful broth and a hardboiled egg. I refocused my energy into this bowl of magic and soon the trolls to my left faded into that mid-afternoon spring day. All of that, came after my appetizer, which was the spicy pickle plate. I gotta say, it wasn't that spicy, but the cucumbers were of the freshest variety and the sesame sauce was the kinda thing one would dream of filling a swimming pool with. Overall, my experience was terrific. Love this place. Filled me up so much, I couldn't get my fat ass on my bike long enough to ride home and I had to find a coffee shop to rest at, around the corner. All told, it made for a great day.

"A ramen restaurant in downtown Broooklyn?! This restaurant is located in Prospect Heights a few blocks away from the Barclays Center and I have to say I was very impressed with the quality of the food and really liked the simple decor inside! Brick walls surround this small restaurant, but it's cozy and fits about 30+. I came here for dinner on a Thursday night at around 6:30pm and it was full, but seats were always becoming available every time a new party would step in. The menu is quite small. They only serve 4 ramen dishes and 2 specials along with appetizer dishes. I ordered the duck special noodle and it actually wasn't what I expected. When you hear ramen, you expect RAMEN, like from the bags found at Chinese supermarkets! But they actually used egg noodles for the ramen dishes. A tad misleading. Nonetheless, the noodle was very well made, soft. The broth was ginger flavored, thin, not too thick and very flavorful. I have to admit, I loved it! Even though I was expecting a real ramen noodle, I was pleasantly surprised at how well-made the egg noodle was. I typically eat at many Chinatown restaurants and KNOW when I encounter a well-made egg noodle.The only thing I was longing for was more duck as I found about 3-3.5 pieces of duck only. Also, the menu was a bit bare, so I'm hoping they will expand it at some point in the future. The noodle and mixture of the flavorful broth was very good. They served just the right amount so I didn't stuff myself and had enough room for some dessert somewhere else. Overall, the service was good and the food was excellent!",4.0
"3.5 stars. (I went there twice, First time, I didn't write review, but I would give them 4 starts. Second time I give them 3 stars.) They are not authentic Japanese ramen restaurant. This place is owned by American chefs who used to work at very famous Japanese American fusion restaurant. I like how they are blending Japanese ingredients with American ingredients. They make unique foods. First time, I tried Miso and Soy ramens. They were good. They are unique, but they still had Japanese flavor. Second time, I tried Mentai Mazemen (Cod roe mix noodle) which was written on the backboard on the wall. The sauce was sour (I think that was flavored by lemon juice) and this sourness was a little too strong and killing the flavor of cod roe.The sauce was creamy as carbonara and I wished I had this with spaghetti in Italian restaurant. Sauce was good, but I didn't feel like I was eating Japanese food. I liked that they used Shiso Leaves(Japanese Herb), but sourness was killing the Shiso flavor, too. However, when I think about the noodle separately from sauce, it was good. It was egg and curly noodle. My boyfirend had Pork Bone (Tonkotsu) Ramen. This ramen's soup is made from Pork Bone, and there is no bone when it is served. Since I used to eat real Japanese Tonkotsu ramen in Japan, and have beengone to real Tonkotsu ramen place like Hide-chan Ramen, I couldn't accept this unique soup. The soup was very light and I could taste they use penuts butter to taste. This was too unique to me. By the way, I ordered Salt & Pepper Chicken Wings. That was juicy and flavorful. I may want to go back for wings.Chuko is going to open Izakaya(Japanese Tapas Bar) on the same block as ramen restaurant in 1 - 2 months. Since their wings was very good, I look forward to their Izakaya opens.",4.0
"CASH ONLY with that said I could eat here allllllllll dayyyyyy.  It's a clean menu which is great. Who the hell needs 100 things on a menu?  Must try is their Kale salad.  Share it, and you will definitely order another.  It's just too damn good to share.  They have ramen specials they post on facebook go like the damn page, and let your mouth water for the bowl of goodness.  Duck Ramen needs to be a staple.Cons? Their ridiculous wait time.  Don't get suckered into believing the long wait time... No one takes a hour to eat a bowl of ramen.  Eat UP!",4.0
"The pork bone ramen is excellent. The broth is the stuff of my dreams. Ask for extra nori on the side. It comes shredded, and sprinkled on top gives just the right kick to the already superlative broth. The pork is succulent. No better. Ippudo and Totto can't compete. The only place I've had comparable meat is Jin ramen, but Jin is a definite second.The bads: beer is warm. The noodles in the broth don't appear to absorb the flavor. Appetizers are uninspired.Overall: fantastic, if you care about ramen. Worth the schlep from Manhattan.",5.0
"I got the veggie ramen. I never get the veggie at any other places because I'm a firm believer in getting your money's worth and meat is generally more costly. But, I'm really glad I got the veggie ramen. It was really rich in flavor and very filling. My boyfriend also came with me and he normally despises getting ramen. His philosophy is that he can make it at home from a bag, but this bowl of noodles converted him. I think that and the really great ice cream shop two blocks down won him over. My friend got a dry noodle dish that was a special that night. I don't remember the name, but it had bacon in it and it was also delicious. She asked for a special chili garlic sauce on the side that was also amazing.",4.0
"I had high expectations for this place, maybe because of the reviews so I'm sad that Chuko didn't live up to them.  Got there on Friday around 1:30 and there was a wait (guess everyone else decided to take the day off work too or nobody in the neighborhood works) but we were seated in 15 even though we were told 30 minutes. Ordered the pork gyoza which were good but a little on the oily side. My wife and I got one pork bun and one shrimp bun to share. The pork bun was okay, had way better elsewhere. Liked the shrimp bun better, reminded me a little of an Asian po'boy. Decided to get the soy ramen with pork and  my wife got the miso with pork. Miso had a nice soup base, noodles were nice and chewy. Soy soup base tasted good also but both broths were oily, like an inch of oil on top...didn't make that very appetizing. Also the pork belly was way too fatty. Yes, I know the irony considering it's pork belly and I'm not opposed to eating fat, especially pork belly because I love it deep fried, braised, you name it. But this was like all fat and no meat! Made me sad. Overall, as a neighborhood spot - yes this is pretty good ramen. But we live in NYC where we have quite a few places that have WAY awesome ramen (not like ramen at a train station in Kyoto awesome - best ramen I've had by the way) but darn close.  Would I travel for Chuko's ramen? Probably not.  I'll rather travel into manhattan and go to Ippudo if I wanted really good ramen or Toto if the wait wasn't so damn long. Would I be excited if I lived nearby? Yes. It's still good ramen. Also, I'm currently dying of thirst. Guess it was salty too.",3.0
"I used to live in the neighborhood so I went there once a week. The food is okay... very salty. I'm Japanese. I'd like some Japanese food every so often even if I know it's just ok.

Everything was well balanced and felt so damn good going down. This one is a must try when you come here. Veggie ramen gets an 8.5/10. Oh and get the garlic hot oil. You're welcome. Lol",4.0
"Coming from a meat-eater, the veggie ramen is the most delicious ramen I have ever had. I ordered the veggie ramen with the roast pork topping and the medium-boiled egg, with a side of the chili sauce and it was seriously a mind-blowing dining experience. I think Chuko is better than Ippudo, Minca, Hidechan, and Totto, hands down.The kale salad and pork buns were delicious as well, but the standout dish is definitely the veggie ramen. We grabbed a drink at the Vanderbilt while we waited and it was the perfect pre-dinner drinks spot.",5.0
"Completely writing this review for vegetarians only.It's probably the best vegetarian ramen that I've ever had. Simply because the broth isn't terrible as it is at so many other ramen places. It's a miso based broth is alot more flavor. The fried brussle sprouts were tasty along with the kale salad. Some piece of the kale salad were too big but I like the fried bits in mix, so it made up for it. It gets busy and it's definitely a place where you don't spend more time than necessary, as hungry customers give you the evil eye for not eating faster.",4.0
"This neighborhood joint has been on my list for a while- I finally made it there last weekend and despite really wanting to like it, Chuko was meh at best.  The good: the kale salad was definitely the highlight for me.  The kale was nicely done and accompanied by crispy sweet potato and a light but sufficiently tasty miso dressing.  The salt and pepper chicken wings were also tasty and perfectly cooked.  A small side of spicy pickles balanced the wings perfectly.  Service was attentive, though oddly, there wasn't a single Asian on staff or eating for that matter (not sure what that says).  Now onto the more disappointing elements: first of all, there was a long wait that turned into a very long wait (am I unreasonable for refusing to accept LES-length waits in Prospect Heights??).  I suppose should know better by now.  But what we were told was a 45 minute wait quickly morphed into a 1.5 hour long wait.  Which felt like an eternity when famished on a cold night.  Fortunately there's Weather Up across the street and Beast down the street.  Fine.  But the real kicker for me was what I was expecting to be the best ramen in this part of Brooklyn turned out to be WAY too salty.  I don't know if it was just a bad batch of broth or what- but the bone soup ramen tasted like someone had dumped a whole bag of salt in there.  My friend's kimchi ramen, on the other hand, was no where near as salty and tasted pretty decent.So in summary, come here if you don't feel like venturing west past Flatbush Ave, be prepared to wait, definitely order the kale salad, and probably stay away from the bone soup ramen.  Oh and cash only folks!",3.0
"I'm a bit baffled as to how this restaurant got four stars. Brooklynites should know better.

"I went on a ramen kick this past summer (you know, going two, three times a week to various spots) and I was not able to find a better ramen joint than here.  I got hooked on their miso w/chicken but have yet to try the veggie one which i heard is amazing (word of mouth and apparently here).  Their apps are really good and I housed a bowl of chicken wings the last time I went.  Salty with some lime juice on top and you're golden.  There are only four wings, but have you ever seen a chicken with six?  Of the two buns they serve, I would definitely take the pork belly over the shrimp any day.  This isn't because everyone and their mother is getting off on pork belly these days, but simply because the shrimp is fried and seemed to have too much batter (oh, but the pork belly here is something to get off on...wow that just sounds waaay dirtier than I expected, but I digress.)  Not to mention, the the cilantro, carrots, cucumbers, and whatever sauce they put on there compliment the pork belly so well.I didn't read many of these reviews, but i'm sure people pointed out how long it can take to get a seat.  Again, the last time i was there, I witnessed at least three groups of two or more people get turned around at the door simply because they were too busy.  They don't take reservations so sometimes you just need to luck out with timing.  If you go by yourself, you have a better chance of getting a seat sooner than later, though that can vary (i've been seated in under 10 minute or up to 45.)  I'll usually give this place a max of an hour wait without scoffing at it.  There are good bars in the area that you can booze at while you wait.They also have ""panda"" sake that comes in a glass cup that you can bring home afterwards and it also come with a lid.  I highly recommend this just for the practical aspect.  The sake is tasty, though =)I went to ippudo, but chuko takes top billing in my book.If I lived any closer (about a 30 minute walk) i would come pretty close to broke because I would eat here all the freaking time.",5.0
"We were in the area and freezing so I wanted some soup and saw this spot but wasn't sure if it would measure up to Totto, which I had a few days prior.  I got the pork bone ramen with roasted pork.  The broth was good but a tad bit salty, but the pork was succulent!  Flavorful, seasoned and melted in our mouths.  Service was good but didn't like how it seemed rushed, but that's how it is when there's a line of people waiting.  See again when I'm in town!",4.0
"I'm obsessed. Found this place on a whim and now I'm hooked. Everything I've eaten has been fantastic. I had a steamed pork bun, the pork bone ramen, the miso ramen, and the gyoza. The pork belly just falls apart and melts in your mouth. Overwhelmingly good. I hear the kale salad is the thing to eat here but haven't tried it yet! Next time. I do think for ramen, this place is a tad bit expensive, but I'll pay it over and over because damnit it tastes so good. Our waitress was really quirky and funny and walked us through the menu and guided our options at first. It was very helpful. Tips: Cash only but there's an ATM in the restaurant.

"Chuko is a small Japanese restaurant that serves up some pretty tasty ramen noodles.  It's pretty simple looking on the inside.  Exposed brick walls, one large chalk board, wooden tables and chairs, but it's not the décor that has the neighborhood locals coming, it's the simply delicious ramen.  The menu is very small, with only a few choices of ramen and bites and snacks.  What they lack in big menu, they make up for it in big taste.  One bowl of this goodness is enough to fill.For starters I tasted the salt and pepper wings for $7.00.  The price is totally steep for four little wings.  The wings are perfectly seasoned and fried.  There is a very light fried coating seasoned with a good amount of salt and pepper and it does the trick.  The seasoning is balance and not excessive of anything salt or pepper.  These wings are highly addictive, but basically 2 drumettes and 2 wings is such a meager portion.  If you can dig deep into your pocket give these a try because they are so perfectly good.I had the miso ramen for $12.00.  The broth is milky, opaque and comes with 3 pieces of pork belly.  A good portion of ramen noodles, super thinly sliced scallions, a soft poached egg.  This ramen was not as curly as sis' ramen.  She had the kimchi ramen, which has no meat in it and a spicy red sauce.  Both ramens were delicious and sis who is a harsher critic than me totally enjoyed her bowl of noodles.  The pork slices have that porky flavor and was rich.  The egg was wonderful, the runny golden goodness if you break it open, I poked a hole with my chopsticks to let it cook some and not to let it all run out.  I didn't want to lose any of the goodness.  The corn that was in my bowl was not can or frozen kernels, it was freshly sliced corn from the cob.  I could see the sharp cut and corn kernels were sweet.  They take care to use the freshest ingredients here.  The food here is delicious and refine, care goes into everything from the task of slicing scallions strips ultra fine and cutting corn kernels to poaching a soft egg beautifully. This place gets packed on the weekend for dinner after 7:30.  At 7:00 there is a wait for tables, as hungry families stay outside waiting, because space is limited.  There are small tables, counter bar stools, and also side counter space with a view of the outside.  We had a small table by the door.  We were lucky to secure the last little table, before there was a wait.  The waitress was sincere, friendly and terrific.  She brought over ice on my request and later she came back to refill the ice.  The AC was not cold enough, especially on a hot day and a hot bowl of noodles.  I was sweating enough but it was good, satisfying sweat.",4.0
"Wow, I am really surprised by the good reviews. I grew up in Hawaii, which has the best Japanese food in the U.S, bar none, and it's way cheaper than in NYC, too. Ramen is a cheap street food, not an art form... but it's become so fetishized in NYC, with high prices to boot. Ramen should be $10, tops (Ippudo in Japan is 50% cheaper than in NY). The prices in NYC are criminal, especially for what's usually mediocre product. The evening did not start well. The short Filipino hostess with bleached hair and tattoos is the rudest restaurant worker I've ever encountered in my life. Like whoa.. who are you? You're a hostess, your job is customer service. Thankfully our waitress was really sweet and kind.Ramen was not good. It was not *bad* (I've had worse), but it wasn't good, and definitely did not live up to the hype. Broth was overly salty and noodles were a touch too firm. It just seemed very sloppily put together, like there was no care put in. Considering that our bowls came out exactly one minute after we ordered, I'm not very surprised. I peeped into the kitchen after and saw that the cooks were older Hispanic men. I don't mean this in a discriminatory way, but what do old Hispanic men know about Japanese food? I didn't see one Asian person in the kitchen.I like the style of the noodles, not many places in NYC use this kind of noodle.. these are the noodles you'll find in Hawaii... but we call it saimin and the broth is made of fish, and much lighter. Anyway, to summarize: the ramen was really disappointing; we regretted making the trip from Manhattan. We were expecting something delicious because of all the good reviews, but I honestly think most people here don't know what's good. This ramen is meh for NY, bad by Hawaii & Japan standards, and totally not worth the price or commute. I think ramen at Ganso is much better, but I read recent reviews saying that the quality has gone down. I have not been to Ganso for about 8 months, so I don't know if this true, but based on my last trip there, Ganso is one of the best ramens I've had in New York. You make the call.",2.0

Thankfully our waitress was really sweet and kind.Ramen was not good. It was not *bad* (I've had worse), but it wasn't good, and definitely did not live up to the hype. Broth was overly salty and noodles were a touch too firm. It just seemed very sloppily put together, like there was no care put in. Considering that our bowls came out exactly one minute after we ordered, I'm not very surprised. I peeped into the kitchen after and saw that the cooks were older Hispanic men. I don't mean this in a discriminatory way, but what do old Hispanic men know about Japanese food? I didn't see one Asian person in the kitchen.I like the style of the noodles, not many places in NYC use this kind of noodle.. these are the noodles you'll find in Hawaii... but we call it saimin and the broth is made of fish, and much lighter. Anyway, to summarize: the ramen was really disappointing; we regretted making the trip from Manhattan. We were expecting something delicious because of all the good reviews, but I honestly think most people here don't know what's good. This ramen is meh for NY, bad by Hawaii & Japan standards, and totally not worth the price or commute. I think ramen at Ganso is much better, but I read recent reviews saying that the quality has gone down. I have not been to Ganso for about 8 months, so I don't know if this true, but based on my last trip there, Ganso is one of the best ramens I've had in New York. You make the call.",2.0

Overall, I would say this is was a fairly decent bowl of ramen, however definitely not a must-have as how others are rating it.

"Vegetarian ramen was divine. Savory broth, just the right amount of seasonal veggies and when you are 1/2 way done, if you have done more noodle munching than broth slurping for 2 bucks you can order extra noodles and they come in a jiffy. Our 4 and 9 year old kids were crazy about the chicken wings. The kids got a ""kid's ramen""which is the noodles and broth (we ordered theirs w/ miso). I didn't see it on the menu but when I asked if they had a kid size portion our super accommodating and friendly waiter mentioned this. It's $7. Mine was $13. They even offered kid chopsticks (that make shift rubber band contraption that Japanese restaurants sometimes put together). Listen up...KALE SALAD! I don't even like kale and it was sooo good.... miso dressing, raisins, sweet potato chips and bits of fried kale. I never thought I would crave kale. I'm thinkin' it now. Cash only. They have an ATM in the restaurant but I never trust those ATMs that aren't at a bank. Just sayin'. Bring cash from a bank and enjoy. You will probably have to wait for a table but you can do that, right? Your mama taught you that patience is a virtue...or was that the rabbit from the Chocolate Nesquik ads?",5.0
"I cannot believe the positive reviews. So I am writing my first review to completely disagree with them. 1) I love ramen. I have eaten some very good ramen in this city. This is not good ramen. 2) When I went there, they had an amazing Brussels sprouts appetizer, which we gobbled down. Had more orders made. It was amazing. If there weren't so many five star reviews, I would give three for that alone. Because, well, that means there are good cooks in there. They just don't have the smokiest idea about ramen. Also the service is very good for such an informal place. It is in fact a decent restaurant. It just shouldn't be serving ramen.3) My ramen was so bad, I couldn't finish the whole bowl. My companions almost finished theirs. We were all dissatisfied. 4) I did read another reviewer (Eleanore S.) that nails - the absence of dashi (or its under use to the point of non-existence) and the undercooked eggs are a clear sign of inferior ramen. However, I disagree with her on the saltyness of the brussel sprouts - its what the dish is, if you do not like that kind of salty, don't order it, but it was not ""too salty"" for the dish it is. To say it was salty is like ordering bacon and saying it was too porky and fatty.5) Either most of you haven't had good ramen, which indeed can be had in NYC, or you are lying to yourselves because you overpaid for crap and want to feel like you didn't do a mistake. 6)Ramen is not a noddle soup. You do not compare it to a noodle soup. This was a decent if overpriced noodle soup.  Ramen is a particular way of cooking. It was absent here - two of the most critical elements of ramen were done incorrectly - the absense of dashi and the undercooked eggs. These affect the explosion of umami that is the basis of good ramen, and leaves you with a relatively flavorless, tea-like, soup.UPDATE:I ate yesterday (beautiful spring day made for walking) at ZuZu Ramen in Park Slope. Writing I review there, but THAT was ramen. And the apps were amazing too. If you are in the Prospect Heights/Park Slope area there is no reason to go to Chuko over ZuZu Ramen. The weird thing is that the reviews are the inverse of here. Really, people do not know what ramen is :/.(I never thought my first reviews in yelp were going to be about ramen, but that is how the dashi crumbled)",1.0
"Despite the fact that they don't take reservations, and that you will probably have to wait for a table at dinner, this place is the bomb dot com.

Their Mazemen brothless ramen hits every flavor spot you would want it to. It's topped with cod roe, seaweed, scallions, bacon, yuzu, and sake butter. YUMMAH!

We didnt' have room for an appetizer, so I'll have to try the kale salad another day (rest assured I will go just to try that) but the ramen was really quite good. I was surprised and pleased that the noodles still had some bite to them--most places overcook the noodles or serve them very soft. This had texture that went well with everything else in the bowl. I requested a soft boiled egg and it was perfect all stirred up with the mushrooms and everything.

Just like the other trend-following Brooklyn restaurants, it looks good on paper (fried chicken, shishito peppers, brussels sprouts, berkshire pork chashu ---bleh), but the dishes lack originality and depth. Glad to have more ramen in Brooklyn, but with Yuji and Yebisu on the northside, I can't bring myself to go to places like Chuko anymore. The one dish I've had there that bucks the trend is their Mentaiko Mazemen. The rest of it I could do without.",2.0
"Worth. The. Wait. Plus, even if there is an hour or two wait, you can grab a drink at Woodwork or Branded Saloon and they will call you went your table is ready. The ambiance is cozy but not a spot for a first date. The place is more for people who want a delicious, well-executed meal. Since there is such a long wait, it's probably not the place you want to hang out after a meal either.I would recommend anything with pork. They have vegetarian ramen as well which is great too. The service is quick and efficient. Not overly friendly - it's a tight space and it's pretty busy, so it's completely excusable.Overall, you will love Chuko.",5.0
"Great place in Brooklyn when your craving Ramen! Pork bone Ramen broth is great and don't forget to ask for the garlic chili oil which gives it that extra kick, the Kale salad is great also.  I recommend this place!!",4.0
Always crowded but they take your number and text so you can grab a drink nearby. Ramen was delicious!  Had a variety of sake as well. Gyoza also good.,4.0
"Vegetarian ramen was divine. Savory broth, just the right amount of seasonal veggies and when you are 1/2 way done, if you have done more noodle munching than broth slurping for 2 bucks you can order extra noodles and they come in a jiffy. Our 4 and 9 year old kids were crazy about the chicken wings. The kids got a ""kid's ramen""which is the noodles and broth (we ordered theirs w/ miso). I didn't see it on the menu but when I asked if they had a kid size portion our super accommodating and friendly waiter mentioned this. It's $7. Mine was $13. They even offered kid chopsticks (that make shift rubber band contraption that Japanese restaurants sometimes put together). Listen up...KALE SALAD! I don't even like kale and it was sooo good.... miso dressing, raisins, sweet potato chips and bits of fried kale. I never thought I would crave kale. I'm thinkin' it now. Cash only. They have an ATM in the restaurant but I never trust those ATMs that aren't at a bank. Just sayin'. Bring cash from a bank and enjoy. You will probably have to wait for a table but you can do that, right? Your mama taught you that patience is a virtue...or was that the rabbit from the Chocolate Nesquik ads?",5.0
"I cannot believe the positive reviews. So I am writing my first review to completely disagree with them. 1) I love ramen. I have eaten some very good ramen in this city. This is not good ramen. 2) When I went there, they had an amazing Brussels sprouts appetizer, which we gobbled down. Had more orders made. It was amazing. If there weren't so many five star reviews, I would give three for that alone. Because, well, that means there are good cooks in there. They just don't have the smokiest idea about ramen. Also the service is very good for such an informal place. It is in fact a decent restaurant. It just shouldn't be serving ramen.3) My ramen was so bad, I couldn't finish the whole bowl. My companions almost finished theirs. We were all dissatisfied. 4) I did read another reviewer (Eleanore S.) that nails - the absence of dashi (or its under use to the point of non-existence) and the undercooked eggs are a clear sign of inferior ramen. However, I disagree with her on the saltyness of the brussel sprouts - its what the dish is, if you do not like that kind of salty, don't order it, but it was not ""too salty"" for the dish it is. To say it was salty is like ordering bacon and saying it was too porky and fatty.5) Either most of you haven't had good ramen, which indeed can be had in NYC, or you are lying to yourselves because you overpaid for crap and want to feel like you didn't do a mistake. 6)Ramen is not a noddle soup. You do not compare it to a noodle soup. This was a decent if overpriced noodle soup.  Ramen is a particular way of cooking. It was absent here - two of the most critical elements of ramen were done incorrectly - the absense of dashi and the undercooked eggs. These affect the explosion of umami that is the basis of good ramen, and leaves you with a relatively flavorless, tea-like, soup.UPDATE:I ate yesterday (beautiful spring day made for walking) at ZuZu Ramen in Park Slope. Writing I review there, but THAT was ramen. And the apps were amazing too. If you are in the Prospect Heights/Park Slope area there is no reason to go to Chuko over ZuZu Ramen. The weird thing is that the reviews are the inverse of here. Really, people do not know what ramen is :/.(I never thought my first reviews in yelp were going to be about ramen, but that is how the dashi crumbled)",1.0
"Despite the fact that they don't take reservations, and that you will probably have to wait for a table at dinner, this place is the bomb dot com. The first time I came here I was surprised to find a simplified menu, but it's not what you think. Despite the amount of options, you'll be more than satisfied with what you order. Their Mazemen brothless ramen hits every flavor spot you would want it to. It's topped with cod roe, seaweed, scallions, bacon, yuzu, and sake butter. YUMMAH! I hope they keep it on the menu forever because I crave it all the time now. I like this place for their simple layout and chill atmosphere. Friendly staff as well!",5.0
"I came here for the much vaunted pork bone ramen and it didn't disappoint. We didnt' have room for an appetizer, so I'll have to try the kale salad another day (rest assured I will go just to try that) but the ramen was really quite good. I was surprised and pleased that the noodles still had some bite to them--most places overcook the noodles or serve them very soft. This had texture that went well with everything else in the bowl. I requested a soft boiled egg and it was perfect all stirred up with the mushrooms and everything. My friend got the soy based soup and also loved hers. it was enoguh different that you could tell that each of their variations were based on a theme, but had distinct takes. Totally looking forward to coming back.",4.0
"Outstanding. Went based on a Chef's Feed recommendation, and so pleased we did. We tried all the appetisers - kale salad, fried brussels, chicken wings, shishito peppers, gyozas - all excellent. The kimchi ramen was sooo full of deep flavour, and my daughter fell in love with the vegetarian option - wonderfully deep broth. They don't take cards, but it was already full within 10 minutes of opening...",5.0

"I had the kale salad which was a bit overdressed but was still good--especially the fried pieces which were mixed in with the raw kale. I also had the miso ramen with pork. The broth was incredibly rich and creamy, the noodles perfectly cooked, and the pork so tender it fell apart with just a tug of the chopsticks. I recommend accepting the server's offer of chili garlic oil to add to the ramen.

"I was craving ramen so I decided to check out Chuko. I was surprised to find people waiting outside for a table on a Thursday night.  Since I was a party of one, I bypassed the wait and was seated at the bar. I ordered a saborro on tap, chicken wings and pork bone ramen with roast pork. (I later saw the kimchi pork ramen special and wished I tried that.). The wings were fried nicely with coarse salt sprinkled on top. I found them a tad too salty and under flavored. But they were crunchy on the outside and nice on the inside. I kept trying to dip them Into the hot sauce but to no avail. As for the ramen, the pork was nice, the noodles were as expected and the mustard greens were the best part. The egg was not memorable but what really disappointed me was be lack of flavor. I attempted to add the hot sauce to my broth but to no avail.  I asked if their was a spicier sauce, but there wasn't really.  I've never had ramen and wanted for spice. Not a good look.All in all I paid about $32 including tip. A bit pricey for the ramen but I guess there are few other options around so...I may be back, but I wouldn't go out of my way.",3.0

"I got the kimchi ramen with ground pork. The broth was fantastic (WARNING: more spicy than your average ramen spot!) and the fillings complemented each other really well.

"What can I say about Chuko that hasn't already been said before. The bone marrow is great, amazing and seriously comforting.

"I've eaten here previously and enjoyed the food. Unfortunately, this ""1"" rating is due to the poor and definitely racist service we received this time.

We watched as more and more people began to arrive and were happy that the wait eventually dwindled down to only a few people. We were next to be seated and instead watched as the host called on two other people who had only recently arrived. I politely mentioned that we were next and he said ""ok"". He STILL took the couple ahead of us and promptly seated them at the better table. He came back out and escorted us to the worst (and last) table for two, near the door. My daughter was extremely upset after witnessing his blatant effort to not seat us according to our arrival and to give us the worst two seats available. a minute after we were seated we both agreed this place did not deserve our business and we left.

Kimchee ramen is just too expensive for what you actually get it is just not worth it. The kimchee in the ramen was weak, very little scallions and the ground pork was hardly seeing. The only thing I enjoyed was the noodles they were nice and chewy, thanks to the company in charge of making them (sun noodles) and the guy boiling them.

While my soup was delicious in every single way, the spiciness of her kimchi soup had that wonderful ""something"" to it that remedied cold days and made you feel at home.

"After a night of drinking with friends I met up with my girlfriend after she got off work and went in search of dinner. She had always wanted to try Chuko so we decided to make the drive over. For a Friday night the wait wasn't too bad. We were seated within half an hour and were likely the last patrons for the night.We started with the Salt and Pepper Chicken Wings. They were tasty and nicely crispy. We both wished it came with a few more pieces. Next I ordered the Pork Bone Ramen and my girlfriend ordered the Soy Ramen. The clear winner of the two was definitely my pork bone broth. It was so delicious and reminded both of us of Asian mom's soups that boil away for an entire day. I have to say, it was pretty difficult to eat though since every few minutes my girlfriend would sneak her spoon into my bowl to steal some broth.

"After a night of drinking with friends I met up with my girlfriend after she got off work and went in search of dinner. She had always wanted to try Chuko so we decided to make the drive over. For a Friday night the wait wasn't too bad. We were seated within half an hour and were likely the last patrons for the night.We started with the Salt and Pepper Chicken Wings. They were tasty and nicely crispy. We both wished it came with a few more pieces. Next I ordered the Pork Bone Ramen and my girlfriend ordered the Soy Ramen. The clear winner of the two was definitely my pork bone broth. It was so delicious and reminded both of us of Asian mom's soups that boil away for an entire day. I have to say, it was pretty difficult to eat though since every few minutes my girlfriend would sneak her spoon into my bowl to steal some broth. I guess the soy broth just didn't match up.Chuko is a nice place for a satisfying ramen. I'd visit again, even if just for some pork bone broth.",5.0
"Oishii! First ramen stop after a trip to Japan and Chuko hit the spot. I had the kimchi ramen which I happily mixed in with the poached egg. Deelicious. Broths were not overly salty. The pork bone ramen (not on menu) came with thinner noodles and the broth was comforting for this chilly day. Came around 12 when it opened and snagged a good spot by the window. By 12:30, the place was packed. Definitely come early if you do not want to wait. Kale salad looked good but I did not get to try. Must come back for it. Docking a star for the buns. Cmon they are so TINY. More filling required. As others have mentioned already, cash-only!",4.0

"Yay for more ramen spots in Brooklyn! The required trip into the city to Ippudo, Jin or Totto Ramen for a belly-warming bowl of ramen is no longer needed now that I've had a slurp of Chuko's ramen!Chuko is simply decorated with table seating, bar seating and by the window to watch the world in this quiet part of Brooklyn pass by. The place is bigger than I though it would be and had a lovely spacious feeling to it. The servers are friendly and attentive. We were constantly checked on, even though it was busy during lunch time on a Friday. The menu is small consisting of Snacks, Bites and Ramen. My Yelp wife and I shared their Shrimp Steam Bun and a Pork Steam Bun. Both were delicious. The chili mayo in their Pork Steam Bun was subtle enough, not to overpower the other flavors and fatty goodness of the pork. For ramen, I went with their Kimchi and my friend went with their special of the day, which was Pork Bone. I instantly noticed that both had different types of noodles - mine were thicker than hers- and I like that they put that much thought into their ramen. My Kimchi ramen was not as spicy as I thought it would be and that's not a bad thing because it allowed me to taste everything else. I loved the texture in my bowl - from the crunch of the cabbage to the ground pork and the poached egg, it was all so good and I couldn't stop slurping away. My wife's broth had a rich, butteriness to it, which was heavenly on a a cold day. For 2 buns ($5/bun) , 2 bowls of ramen ($12/bowl), and a diet soda it cost $40 - quite the affordable date place!Although Chuko is not conveniently close to any subway station, it's not that far either and it's very much worth a trip! I can't wait to go back and try more of the menu. Now only if it would snow to make me want ramen...",4.0

"I think I'm up to having visited about 12 ramen/noodle joints in NYC and I can say, with no hyperbole, that Chuko is the best I've had here. The guys that started this place, Morimoto alums, clearly know their shit. The pork bone ramen I had was deliciously rich, the pork was incredibly tender, the egg was perfectly prepared and the noodles had just the right amount of bite. My friend had the kimchi ramen and it was spectacular as well. So much so that I'll be ordering it myself when I return. I can also recommend the crispy brussels sprouts, which were so good that I recreated them at home last night. (Pan fried sprouts, tossed in a mixture of fish sauce and soy sauce. It's wasn't quite as good as Chuko's preparation, but it was a good first attempt.)Oh yeah, making this place even better is the fact that you can put your name on the list and they'll call you when your table is ready. Perfect for grabbing a cocktail at Weather Up, just across the street, before dinner.",5.0
"This place was good.I had my usual soy ramen. I base my opinion of all ramen places on this first, then if I like it go back for the other, more unique dishes. If a place can't handle a decent soy ramen then why bother. This place was good. Also the waiter there was awesome. She took care of everything quickly and brought extras sauces and things that she thought I might like. The Ramen:The Broth: It was solid, I would give it a 6 or 7 out of 10. It had a nice flavor, it was salty, and you could taste a clear soy taste. That said I dont think there was anything there that would make it particularly unique. The Noodle: The choice was interesting. They were using noodles that I am accustom to seeing in Hong Kong noodle soups in Chinatown. I happen to love that. They are smaller and have a harder texture. I think this makes the ramen stand out a bit. 8.5 out of 10The Pork: The pork was fatty and relatively thick. It fell apart in the bowl and although it added some variety to the noodles I dont think it was anything special. I give it a 5 out of 10The Other Parts: The bowl also had an egg sliced in half which was nice. It was not hard boiled or soft boiled but that nice creamy middle area. It was simple, nice, filling and not overwhelming. They had some chopped scallions but I dont think they really were special in any way. The bamboo shoots were mild in flavor but not particularly unique. Lastly they had a spicy oil with bits of fried garlic mixed in. This was good enough that my mouth waters thinking about it. I give the total of these four things a 7.5 out of 10.I think that this bowl of ramen was filling and good. At $12 for a lunch time ramen I think they could have brought a little more creativity to it one more Item that packs a flavor unique to them. That said, I have seen places that put together a much cruder bowl trying to be unique. This was solid. I would be happy to have a place like this in my neighborhood. I will have to go back and try what else they have to offer.",4.0
"We continue to go to Chuko every few weeks. No problems getting a table. Everyone is nice. Chicken wings continue to rock my socks.ATM only dispenses $50 bills. Really?

"Delicious ramen noodles!  First stop thinking about the ramen in the pack you used to eat in college, that stuff tastes like cardboard when compared to this.  The menu is small, a total of 9 dishes including app's, but everything I tasted was delicious and soul warming.I ordered the kimchee bowl and couldn't get enough of a homemade garlic hot sauce to pour over everything.  It hit the spot for the walk over to the Barclay's center to watch the A10 semi's.  Packed with locals.",4.0
"Really tasty ramen! Might be the best I've had in the city... Although I'm in no way a ramen aficionado. Had the pork bone ramen. It was delicious. Most ramen is really salty, so I was pleased that this ramen was not. The chili garlic sauce that comes with the ramen is amazing.  My only complaint is I wish there was more roast pork in the ramen, but I guess it's standard to not add a ton of meat.We also tried the pork buns. They were good, but too mayo-y. I tried my friend's beer. Very tasty as well.  I'll be back the next time I need to carb-load.",4.0

"Yay for more ramen spots in Brooklyn! The required trip into the city to Ippudo, Jin or Totto Ramen for a belly-warming bowl of ramen is no longer needed now that I've had a slurp of Chuko's ramen!Chuko is simply decorated with table seating, bar seating and by the window to watch the world in this quiet part of Brooklyn pass by. The place is bigger than I though it would be and had a lovely spacious feeling to it. The servers are friendly and attentive. We were constantly checked on, even though it was busy during lunch time on a Friday. The menu is small consisting of Snacks, Bites and Ramen. My Yelp wife and I shared their Shrimp Steam Bun and a Pork Steam Bun. Both were delicious. The chili mayo in their Pork Steam Bun was subtle enough, not to overpower the other flavors and fatty goodness of the pork. For ramen, I went with their Kimchi and my friend went with their special of the day, which was Pork Bone. I instantly noticed that both had different types of noodles - mine were thicker than hers- and I like that they put that much thought into their ramen. My Kimchi ramen was not as spicy as I thought it would be and that's not a bad thing because it allowed me to taste everything else. I loved the texture in my bowl - from the crunch of the cabbage to the ground pork and the poached egg, it was all so good and I couldn't stop slurping away. My wife's broth had a rich, butteriness to it, which was heavenly on a a cold day. For 2 buns ($5/bun) , 2 bowls of ramen ($12/bowl), and a diet soda it cost $40 - quite the affordable date place!Although Chuko is not conveniently close to any subway station, it's not that far either and it's very much worth a trip!

"Yes, this place does have the best ramen in Brooklyn, with one caveat - they make it pretty difficult to eat here. I went here after it first opened and haven't been able to get in ever since. It's been an hour and a half wait every time I go by. If you show up when they open at 5 there is a line to get it. Which would be fine except they don't do take out, they don't do delivery, aren't open for lunch, don't take reservations and don't take credit cards. All I want to do is give this place my money but they're making it really difficult. The food is quite reasonably priced as well so it's not like they need to maintain an air of exclusivity. Anyway, despite all these annoyances, it's still an amazing place so 4 stars. I'll up it to 5 if they decide to make it a little easier to eat here.",4.0
"Took a crew of 5 girls here on a Tuesday. I was expecting a wait, but appreciated that the hostess took my number and said that she would call when our table was ready.

Beween the five of us we ordered almost everything on the menu. The stand outs were the famous kale salad, and for me, the veggie broth ramen. Definitely the best ramen I'd ever had. Bonus points that they will sell you extra noodles for $2 if you end up with too much broth. Genius.",5.0

Get it. Get it now.The ramen was..... meh. I have never had anything so bland but oddly spicy as the Kim Chi soup - it tasted like nothing, but a few minutes later my mouth was burning.They only have one option for vegetarians, but the veggie soup was nice and light. Still not a lot of flavor, but boyfriend drained his bowl none the less.Personally I don't think it's worth the hype, but SO MANY good things have been said that I might try again and get a different soup, but I'm in no rush.",2.0
"I came on a Tuesday night around 8 and the line was literally out the door (thank goodness it was not a cold day!). My friend and I were told it would be an hour wait, but luckily only 45 mins and we were quickly seated. A small, yet cozy spot with very dim lighting. Every time the door opened, I could feel my stomach jump for joy. It smells like heaven! Be prepared to wait if you're coming in during dinner. They take your name and number down to call you when your table is ready. FOOD WISE, I swear it's the best kimchi ramen I've ever had in New York. The texture of the noodles = perfection! Amongst two people, we started off with the buns. My friend had the pork bun and I chose to be a little daring with the shrimp bun ($5 each), and it was a nice change for me. I LOVED THE SHRIMP BUNS!! Nicely battered and oozing with their special tartar sauce. The ramen was superb. I tried my friends pork bone ramen soup and it was delicious, but not comparable to my kimchi ramen. The noodles in the pork bone ramen are thinner compared to the kimchi ramen. I preferred the thicker noodle. One thing about the kimchi ramen, DO A QUICK STIR! I had totally forgotten that it included ground pork (bottom of the bowl) and didn't realize it was in my bowl till I was 75% done with my ramen (haha!). For a person that does not normally drink the soup in my ramen (or any noodle soup), I couldn't help but take spoonfuls of the soup. It wasn't too heavy or too salty. My friend, one who isn't a huge ramen fanatic like myself said it was worth the wait, so a job well done on my part!

"After reading up all the hype and articles about this ramen opening owned by former Morimoto chefs, I was really excited to try this place out.  After a sudden drop in temperature, ramen was on my mind for dinner last Saturday.  Luckily we were able to get seated right away (although at the bar) despite the crowds, early on a Saturday night!  Our waitress was really nice and helpful, so that was a good sign.  She greeted us, mentioned the specials and asked if we've been at the restaurant before - then explaining how the menu worked. We had a great start to dinner with one of the appetizer specials - chicken liver / pork banh mi.  Liver is not my thing, but wow this was really delicious!  My hubbie who does eat liver, was really impressed. However, when we ordered the chicken miso ramen and traditional pork ramen - we were like, is this it?  Yes it still was good and not terrible, but we had high hopes after having the special appetizer.  I liked my miso ramen better, since it had a delicate touch and flavor, with the corn as an added touch.  Since they charge a whopping $12 for ramen, I had hoped the portions too would be doubled, but I left the place still feeling hungry!     P.S. this is a cash only joint.  (I know, it is surprising since this is an ""upscale"" ramen restaurant).  I don't mind, but if it's cash only then they should put up a sign so we could be prepared...of course there was no sign, so we had to go to the ATM across the street after ordering, which was such an inconvenience.",3.0
"Oh Chuko, I love you so hard. My husband and I each had excellent ramen after sharing the brussels sprout appetizer. The wait wasn't too long and we can easily walk there from our BedStuy apartment.

"As the night cooled down, it was the perfect weather for a ramen-filled evening. Being in Brooklyn, the list was short and Chuko was on top. The girlfriend approved.The wait was a bit on the longer side, 30-40 minutes (fully packed, people hanging outside) but all was well once our order started arriving. The pork bun was as soft as freshly-made dough with juicy slices of pork inside. The chicken wings well-fried with just the right amount of crunch (and seasoned adequately) and then, the miso ramen came. We basked in it's broth-appearance;  the pieces of tender roasted pork floating leisurely, a poached egg teasing us to poke it vigorously and the noodles wanting to perform acrobatics on our chopsticks (the fork could only watch this time). A spectacle for the mouth! But then the chilli sauce (?) made an appearance and with a droplet or two light up our tongues (in a good kind of way)  Chuko, my heart & stomach request another visit. But before that happens, keep all your other guests warm & happy. They've been looking for someone like you for quite some time.",5.0
"Move over Ippudo, you've got competition. This place is hip, sleek, intimate, and over all awesome. But what you really want me to talk about is how good the was ramen right? We started off with the fried green tomato bun. It was good, the batter and texture was great. The aioli they used for it was a little lack luster, and I felt like there could have been a little more seasoning. But was worth the try.. It was also the special that night so we decided to try it. I got the miso ramen with pork. HOLY SHIT, I wanted to slap someone's mama when I took my first bite. The miso broth was perfect, and the berkshire pork was salty and fatty and just gave me a flavor explosion..in my mouth. I've had shitty ramen before, shitty as in you need to squeeze half a bottle of hot sauce in it for flavor. Nope, not here. Miso broth was heavenly.He got the soy ramen with pork. HA, I liked mine better. As a ramen 'wannabe' enthusiast, I judge a ramen restaurant by it's miso. If you get the miso right, MOST of the time..the rest of your ramen is pretty good. The soy was good but I feel like the pork with miso just complimented each other better. Nonetheless, we both really liked our ramen. Another reason why I really loved Chuko was for the hot sauce, it was chilli oil with thinly sliced roasted garlic. The two together made my mouth very happy, this combination also didn't ruin the flavor of the ramen. It was the perfect punch to accompany the ramen. The staff was very friendly, almost a little too friendly at one point. We had 4 of the servers come up to us within a 5 minute span asking if we were done, and if they could clear our table. The time they took to pick up our check after we were done took longer than it did for them to ask to clear our table. I'd be a little more understanding if they were slammed and needed the table but they weren't. There a bunch of vacant tables, so I was kind of confused. I think we were a little bit turned-off by that bit. But it wouldn't deter us from us ever coming back.",5.0
"I've been to a lot of different ramen joints in NYC and in LA(waited in line an hour at a few - that's how good they supposedly are) and Chuko is by far one of the best.  Definitely my favorite.  Every time I go to another ramen place I am always disappointedThe broth is rich and flavorful.  The homemade, garlic hot sauce is killer - they should bottle that up and sell it on the side.  My favorite is the miso-pork with the poached egg - melt in your mouth goodness!The brussel sprouts are the bomb!   And we are so thrilled that they finally got their beer license so we can have a drink with our tasty ramen.",5.0
"They got me! I pride myself in either avoiding, shorting or eluding long restaurants waits, but last night I made an exception. A 1.5 hour wait, yup for Ramen. They were very friendly, even said we could get a discount at the bar across the street if we told them we were waiting. God cross neighborhood promotion.Was it worth it? Yeah it was. the food was excellent. The Ramen was the best I have had. All the sides were great. I will go back but maybe for lunch when hopefully I don't have to wait as long.",4.0
I'm not a huge fan of Ramen and comparing it to other ramen I've had its definitely not any better so I can't give it more then 3 stars.  The staff was very friendly and informative so they all get 5 stars.  We eecieved are appetizers within 10 minutes of ordering them and our ramen came within 20 min which isn't bad considering that the place was full to capacity.  Overall its a good place to go to if your in the mood for ramen and your not traveling a far distance.,3.0
"We'd been meaning to try Chuko for some time, but we don't like standing on line and and waiting.  Early on a Friday evening in August seemed perfect. And perfect Chuko was.First, we had a small bite, the Bun. Sweet, juicy pork lodged in a soft bun with a sweet and slightly spicy mayo? sauce. Delicious! Second, crispy Brussels Sprouts with fish sauce and Bacon. Delicious Again!Third, the ramen. And I've gotta say, maybe the best ramen I've ever had. Miso and pork (again sweet and juicy), with noodles that were toothsome. Again, delicious.Attentive and polite service. Chuko is five stars!",5.0

The pork bun was as soft as freshly-made dough with juicy slices of pork inside. The chicken wings well-fried with just the right amount of crunch (and seasoned adequately) and then, the miso ramen came. We basked in it's broth-appearance;  the pieces of tender roasted pork floating leisurely, a poached egg teasing us to poke it vigorously and the noodles wanting to perform acrobatics on our chopsticks (the fork could only watch this time). A spectacle for the mouth! But then the chilli sauce (?) made an appearance and with a droplet or two light up our tongues (in a good kind of way)  Chuko, my heart & stomach request another visit. But before that happens, keep all your other guests warm & happy. They've been looking for someone like you for quite some time.",5.0
"Move over Ippudo, you've got competition. This place is hip, sleek, intimate, and over all awesome. But what you really want me to talk about is how good the was ramen right? We started off with the fried green tomato bun. It was good, the batter and texture was great. The aioli they used for it was a little lack luster, and I felt like there could have been a little more seasoning. But was worth the try.. It was also the special that night so we decided to try it. I got the miso ramen with pork. HOLY SHIT, I wanted to slap someone's mama when I took my first bite. The miso broth was perfect, and the berkshire pork was salty and fatty and just gave me a flavor explosion..in my mouth. I've had shitty ramen before, shitty as in you need to squeeze half a bottle of hot sauce in it for flavor. Nope, not here. Miso broth was heavenly.He got the soy ramen with pork. HA, I liked mine better. As a ramen 'wannabe' enthusiast, I judge a ramen restaurant by it's miso. If you get the miso right, MOST of the time..the rest of your ramen is pretty good. The soy was good but I feel like the pork with miso just complimented each other better. Nonetheless, we both really liked our ramen. Another reason why I really loved Chuko was for the hot sauce, it was chilli oil with thinly sliced roasted garlic. The two together made my mouth very happy, this combination also didn't ruin the flavor of the ramen. It was the perfect punch to accompany the ramen. The staff was very friendly, almost a little too friendly at one point. We had 4 of the servers come up to us within a 5 minute span asking if we were done, and if they could clear our table. The time they took to pick up our check after we were done took longer than it did for them to ask to clear our table. I'd be a little more understanding if they were slammed and needed the table but they weren't. There a bunch of vacant tables, so I was kind of confused. I think we were a little bit turned-off by that bit. But it wouldn't deter us from us ever coming back.",5.0
"I've been to a lot of different ramen joints in NYC and in LA(waited in line an hour at a few - that's how good they supposedly are) and Chuko is by far one of the best.  Definitely my favorite.  Every time I go to another ramen place I am always disappointedThe broth is rich and flavorful.  The homemade, garlic hot sauce is killer - they should bottle that up and sell it on the side.  My favorite is the miso-pork with the poached egg - melt in your mouth goodness!The brussel sprouts are the bomb!   And we are so thrilled that they finally got their beer license so we can have a drink with our tasty ramen.",5.0
"They got me! I pride myself in either avoiding, shorting or eluding long restaurants waits, but last night I made an exception. A 1.5 hour wait, yup for Ramen. They were very friendly, even said we could get a discount at the bar across the street if we told them we were waiting. God cross neighborhood promotion.Was it worth it? Yeah it was. the food was excellent. The Ramen was the best I have had. All the sides were great. I will go back but maybe for lunch when hopefully I don't have to wait as long.",4.0
I'm not a huge fan of Ramen and comparing it to other ramen I've had its definitely not any better so I can't give it more then 3 stars.  The staff was very friendly and informative so they all get 5 stars.  We eecieved are appetizers within 10 minutes of ordering them and our ramen came within 20 min which isn't bad considering that the place was full to capacity.  Overall its a good place to go to if your in the mood for ramen and your not traveling a far distance.,3.0
"We'd been meaning to try Chuko for some time, but we don't like standing on line and and waiting.  Early on a Friday evening in August seemed perfect. And perfect Chuko was.First, we had a small bite, the Bun. Sweet, juicy pork lodged in a soft bun with a sweet and slightly spicy mayo? sauce. Delicious! Second, crispy Brussels Sprouts with fish sauce and Bacon. Delicious Again!Third, the ramen. And I've gotta say, maybe the best ramen I've ever had. Miso and pork (again sweet and juicy), with noodles that were toothsome. Again, delicious.Attentive and polite service. Chuko is five stars!",5.0
Best. Ramen. Ever.,5.0
"Luckily when I came to Chuko I was able to avoid the long lines everybody has been talking about (albeit it was 7PM on a Tuesday). I ordered the Miso ramen and and pork buns. The bun was steamed perfectly and I really liked the pork (great meat to fat ratio) but I wasn't crazy about the relish it was adorned with. As far as my ramen itself, the broth was delicious but the noodles were a little tougher than I usually like them. Overall good food for a decent price, but nothing I was blown away by.",3.0
"Finally a ramen place that knows how to cook an egg! I was pleasantly surprised to find a gleaming orange ""hanjuku"" egg in my bowl of shoyu ramen. And on top of that, the broth was bursting with flavors that was not just sodium; my dinner partner had the miso and I would say the miso broth has even more complex and rich flavors. The shoyu ramen's noodles are very thin, but the miso ramen comes with fatter noodles. The crispy kale salad is a must have-- the kale is topped with a few pieces of fried kale and golden raisins and tossed with a creamy miso dressing. I could have this everyday :)Summary: Best ramen in Brooklyn!Other things to note: Cash only.",4.0
"To say Chuko makes a good bowl of ramen would be a vast understatement. They make the perfect bowl of ramen. Delicious broth, perfectly tender noodles, flavorful meat. There really is a lot of skill in that kitchen. The spot itself is somewhat small so it can get packed, but it doesn't feel cramped with lots of room between tables and a nice bar space. They offer a fairly limited drink menu, with I think just Sapporo and maybe one other brew on tap, but that's ok because you came here for the ramen. They'll usually have a special ramen of the day. This is generally a great option. You should get it, no matter what it is. But, if it's the ""pho"" ramen, you really need to get yourself a bowl  because that stuff is sooooo good. I haven't explored the appetizer options too thoroughly because I go for the ramen, but the wife and I did enjoy the pork bun once and were blown away. If that's any indication, you could probably get real full on everything besides ramen and be quite happy - but why would you do that when the perfect bowl of ramen is just a few dollars away? My only complaint - cash only. That's the one thing stopping me from coming here more often.",4.0
"my go to bowl of miso pork ramen never disappoints. the broth is creamy and flavorful, and the portion itself is large enough that i never finish (as hard as i try!) the noodles have that great soft texture - very sip-able. this is an outstanding place to come and have a hot bowl of soup on a cold or rainy day.  i always grab some pork buns as well because when it comes to choosing the appetizer, my final decision always comes down to the kale salad and the pork buns.

"Crowded on the weekend so go early, like, as soon as they open... or you might be standing in the cold for an hour. The ramen was warm and comforting, and with every slurp my body started to defrost from the cold snowy outdoors. The BAO on the menu was also melt-in-your-mouth-good but overpriced.

"Alright, this place is seriously awesome! I've been on a ramen binge this summer and I've tried many great places but this place stacks up against any of them, including Momo Fuku.

That means a lot from a guy who doesn't really like salad.Also, as far as ramen is concerned, this place has some pretty solid food. The broth is great, the noodles are firm and chewy. The spicy garlic chips sauce is AMAZING! I love this stuff!! Put tons of it on everything you get there! The pork buns are good, though different from the Momo Fuku buns. The head cheese special I had once was good. There's nothing that I've had here that isn't great. That's not to say that I don't have a few things that would make me an even happier guy.  The meat garnish on the meat ramens is not completely satisfying me quantity wise. A little more of the pork belly would be nice and if it could be a little more tender that'd be an improvement. Also, your sake price is too high. Drop that by 2 bucks and I'll gladly drink twice as much with I'm pretty sure will net you more, make me eat more appetizers, and make us all happier.All that being said, this is one of my favorite places to eat in the world!

"The pork bone soup is legit and amazing. But the noodles that come with this ramen are SERIOUSLY LACKING. the noodles that come w the miso ramen are like 100x better. Unfortunately, since I ordered the pork bone, I have to be a bitch and give this place 3 stars for now",3.0

"This. Place. Is. Fantastic.Went there for the first time with friends a few weeks ago and was not disappointed--it was even better than I'd heard it was.I had the veggie ramen, which was probably the best soup-based meal I've had in my life. No idea what they put in this broth to make it so delicious, but it's basically life-affirming. (Upon tasting it, one of my dining companions' response was ""I want to take a bath in this."") Ordered it with a soft-cooked egg, which made it even better, and piled on plenty of the garlic-and-chili-oil condiment they serve alongside the ramen.Basically, it's all I can do not to go back here every day.

"Before the summer of 2012, Chuko could do no wrong, but things have changed.  The noodles became less hearty and tasty.  The broth seemed to become saltier.  The eggs, once perfectly boiled with a semi-soft yolk that added a nice warm surprise to every bowl... Now they are pre-cooked and cold... COLD!!! And most tragic. the garlic hot sauce has become more garlic that hot sauce.  Not sure about the reason for all these changes, but the restaurant started out strong and has since taken a sharp detour. If you're craving ramen and can't ,make it to a better spot, it's still a decent choice, but a far cry from it's origins.",2.0

"I was super excited to try this place based on all the reviews on Yelp. We came around 1:30 on a sunday and was seated almost immediately. It wasn't as packed as I had expected which was good for us. We ordered the pork buns, brussel sprouts, pork bone ramen and the veggie ramen. The pork buns were good and perhaps one of the better ones I have had. The chili mayo was not as heavy as I had expected it to be and the pork was nice and juicy. My only complaint is that it was way overpriced. I did not expect it to be $5 a pop and was taken aback when the waiter asked me if I wanted two which was what I had originally assumed was for $5. The brussel sprouts were really good. The incorporation of fish sauce was a great idea and I was pleasantly surprised. I would have liked it if they did not put as much fish sauce. Fish sauce has a lot of flavor to it so just a little would have done the job. My veggie ramen was a bit disappointing. There were only a few pieces of veggie and the broth was very heavy. It would have been better if a lighter broth was used. Also, a thinner noodle would have paired better with the veggies. Considering it was highly recommended by other Yelpers and the waiter, I expected it to have more of a wow factor. The pork bone ramen was OK. I had a taste of the broth and noodles from my friend's ramen and it didn't wow me at all. The broth did not have as much flavor as other prok bone broths I have had before. I would come back again if I was in the mood for ramen and if I was too lazy to go into the city. What stood out for me were definitely the appetizers, the ramen was just OK.",3.0
"I'm a huge fan of ramen and always had to run into the city to satisfy my urge. Not anymore!! Absolutely delicious, priced fairly and on par if not better than all the other ramen spots in NYC.

"Mmmmmmm.  Crunch, crunch.  Chew.  Mmmmmmm...slurp, slurp.  (puppy eyes)...Mmmmmmm.  That should be my review, but not all of you speak gastro-phonetics, so let me explain in words.  This place is aweso-mmmmm.  I was dating a girl that lived in the neighborhood but she said she didn't really go out to eat in the area.  I did a quick Yelp search, found this interesting gemmmmmm, and told her to put on her shoes - we're going for ramen.  We walk into a jam packed, spacious, yet cozy, red backdropped, bustling dining room.  On a huge chalkboard I see two things near and dear to me - soft shell crabs and ramen (This was a few months ago when soft shell crabs were more in season)!  So excited, and they did not disappoint...We get the soft shell crab steam buns and they were delicious.  Home made steam buns, of the perfect consistency, and an extremely well done, crispy soft shell crab.  I could've done a Man vs Food on them and eaten three dozen, with hot sauce and without leaving the table.  We also got an order of Pork Steam Buns, because, well, I'm a pig and like to try an array of food when I go to an exciting new place.  Delicious! Now, you'll have to forgive me, but as I said, I went a few months ago and I forget what 2 types of ramen we exactly got (one was a special, the other I'm pretty sure was miso-pork) but there was not a single drop left.  I remember when we both took our first slurp of ramen, we both looked each other in the eye as if to say, ""OMG, this is sooo delicious,"" ""Wow, you can take my clothes off right here, right now,"" ""You are going to get soo lucky tonight...mmmmmm"".  My date was Japanese (a good qualifier of ramen), and she totally gave out a little sigh, as she  dropped her shoulder slightly, pouted her lips, and gave me puppy eyes.  I'm tempted to give this place 5 stars, but I feel I need to go again, verify the quality once more, eat another 3-5 things on their menu, and then...bump them up to a well deserved 5-star.   But since my experience is limited to one visit, I'll give them a whooping, resounding 4+ star rating. The service was excellent and if I didn't know better, I thought the waitress was kind of flirting with me.  I am very flirtable, and she was real cute, so I guess there's no harm.  Very attentive, friendly and helpful.  That's my story, and I'm sticking to it.  Just go already, and remember to look your date in the eye after your first sip of ramen.  You can thank me for it later.  Boom-Boom.",4.0
"Last Friday when I ate ramen out of a Styrofoam bowl, I was about fed up with the curly noodles.  But somehow today when I was craving some comfort food, Chuko hit the spot.  This ramen bar is a cute joint.  It has a hipster, minimalist (kinda romantic) atmosphere.   A great backdrop to a rainy fall evening.Service was quick and easy.  No fuss at the wooden bar counter.The kale salad was to die for.  Very memorable and the kale was not too tough to go down.  I am looking forward to a good number 2 tomorrow morning.  The dressing was the best, in addition to the fried kale? fried broccoli?  I couldn't tell.  The raisins were a nice sweet hint.My kimchi ramen was tasty, but a bit on the salty side.  It was a thick broth and more salt heavy than spicy.  If you don't mind lime's sour tartness, ask for one to break the one sided flavor.  The noodles were a thicker variation, which reminded me of the Chinese egg noodle.  I was searching for my pork, but they all sank to the bottom of the bowl  I had to scoop it all up at the end of my meal.  I am intrigued to come back to try the 4 other types of ramen soups.The fried chicken was great from the one bite I took.  Not a heavy or greasy rendition of the crispy bird, but a crunchy salty peppery take on the classic.  Way pricey though, four pieces for $7.  My best bud was complaining while he licked his fingers dry.Loved the food.  I left happy, but the food will burn a slight hole in your wallet.  It's ramen for the classy.  It's not your $.99 package of ramen you get from the corner store.",4.0
"The pork bone ramen was a good life decision.I am reminded of this as I eat my leftovers: the bowls are huge, so go hungry. A friend recommended Chuko for the kale salad (meta-review?), but I was more in the mood for piggy goodness. It arrived piping hot with a perfectly soft-boiled egg, fatty (in the best possible way) pork slices and a little pile of greens on top. Definitely get the hot sauce. It was delicious, though I did feel that the noodles themselves could be improved - they were a bit limp (overcooked, maybe?) for my taste.At 12:30 PM on a Wednesday I expected Chuko to be packed but was pleasantly surprised to find only a few people there; it filled up over the course of my meal but at no point got overly loud or crowded. I sat at the wrap-around window counter and people-watched; it's a good corner for that. The waitress was super friendly, and I briefly considered asking her if she wanted to be my friend. I chickened out. Maybe next time. Oh and cash only!",4.0
"This. Place. Is. Fantastic.Went there for the first time with friends a few weeks ago and was not disappointed--it was even better than I'd heard it was.I had the veggie ramen, which was probably the best soup-based meal I've had in my life. No idea what they put in this broth to make it so delicious, but it's basically life-affirming. (Upon tasting it, one of my dining companions' response was ""I want to take a bath in this."") Ordered it with a soft-cooked egg, which made it even better, and piled on plenty of the garlic-and-chili-oil condiment they serve alongside the ramen.Basically, it's all I can do not to go back here every day. I've heard the kale salad is great, but I'm not sure I could bring myself to order anything but ramen.",5.0
"Really delicious ramen noodle soup restaurant in Brooklyn. I went there after snow storm. It was just perfect. Enjoyed the service and the quality of food. Also if you go there for rush hour,  need to wait for spots to open. I highly recommend.",4.0
"Before the summer of 2012, Chuko could do no wrong, but things have changed.  The noodles became less hearty and tasty.  The broth seemed to become saltier.  The eggs, once perfectly boiled with a semi-soft yolk that added a nice warm surprise to every bowl... Now they are pre-cooked and cold... COLD!!! And most tragic. the garlic hot sauce has become more garlic that hot sauce.  Not sure about the reason for all these changes, but the restaurant started out strong and has since taken a sharp detour. If you're craving ramen and can't ,make it to a better spot, it's still a decent choice, but a far cry from it's origins.",2.0
"This place was packed on a Monday night! We had to wait thirty minutes, but well worth the wait. Pork bone ramen was delicious.  They also give you this little dish of what I call ""brown bits."" It tastes like the brown bits that you deglaze when cooking.  SO good.  And the soft boiled egg was perfectly cooked, along with my noodles which were perfectly al dente. Cannot wait to come back for the kim chi ramen and try the pork buns. Worth the wait and the hike out to Brooklyn.",4.0
"I was super excited to try this place based on all the reviews on Yelp. We came around 1:30 on a sunday and was seated almost immediately. It wasn't as packed as I had expected which was good for us. We ordered the pork buns, brussel sprouts, pork bone ramen and the veggie ramen. The pork buns were good and perhaps one of the better ones I have had. The chili mayo was not as heavy as I had expected it to be and the pork was nice and juicy. My only complaint is that it was way overpriced. I did not expect it to be $5 a pop and was taken aback when the waiter asked me if I wanted two which was what I had originally assumed was for $5. The brussel sprouts were really good. The incorporation of fish sauce was a great idea and I was pleasantly surprised. I would have liked it if they did not put as much fish sauce. Fish sauce has a lot of flavor to it so just a little would have done the job. My veggie ramen was a bit disappointing. There were only a few pieces of veggie and the broth was very heavy. It would have been better if a lighter broth was used. Also, a thinner noodle would have paired better with the veggies. Considering it was highly recommended by other Yelpers and the waiter, I expected it to have more of a wow factor. The pork bone ramen was OK. I had a taste of the broth and noodles from my friend's ramen and it didn't wow me at all. The broth did not have as much flavor as other prok bone broths I have had before. I would come back again if I was in the mood for ramen and if I was too lazy to go into the city. What stood out for me were definitely the appetizers, the ramen was just OK.",3.0
"I'm a huge fan of ramen and always had to run into the city to satisfy my urge. Not anymore!! Absolutely delicious, priced fairly and on par if not better than all the other ramen spots in NYC.

"Had to log in and write a review after reading some of the bad reviews of Chuko, the new little Ramen celebrity in Prospect Heights.Waitstaff was attentive, and knowledgeable about every item. When a brand new restaurant tells you they've ""run out of food"" or are ""filled to capacity,"" and you don't know what that means, you've never worked in the service industry. True pork bone ramen takes at least 3-5 hours to make, even in a pressure cooker. Running out of soup is not unheard of even at established popular Ramen restaurants.Chuko gets their Tonkotsu ramen spot on. If your pork bone ramen is not rich, creamy, and milky, walk out. When you order a pork bone ramen and complain that the consistency is thick or milky, you don't know what you're talking about. Go back to the ramen places that cater to non-cooks and white-people food. This ramen broth is called Tonkotsu, and is literally the first thing you should look for at a Ramen place. An egg in your ramen should never be ANYTHING but poached or soft boiled. A hard boiled egg in ramen is a travesty and Chuko get's it right.$12 is not an overprice bowl here. The quality is evident in every single ingredient. This is not a ramen factory that can give you a $9 bowl the size of your entire expanded stomach.My complaints: $7 for a single pork bun. It was good, but there should honestly be 2 in a serving.If you come in and order drinks, it will be an expensive tab. Expect this. Or walk in, get a bowl, and walk out having spent $15 for real quality food.It's best to come when it's really busy, so the chefs are feeling the rush and getting their groove on.

For snacks, always the brussels. Consistently good and the same every time. The only bad thing is the wait time during NYC dinnertime and weekends, but to avoid that I advise going for an early dinner right after work or for a late lunch right before they close to prep for the dinner shift. If you go during these times (especially early in the week) you can always avoid a wait. It's also faster to be seated if you are just two people (since you can sit at the bar or a table).

I always get the same thing: Miso broth with a hard egg and veggies instead of meat. It's much richer than the 100% veggie option if you aren't a strict vegetarian. I highly advise it! For snacks, always the brussels. Consistently good and the same every time. The only bad thing is the wait time during NYC dinnertime and weekends, but to avoid that I advise going for an early dinner right after work or for a late lunch right before they close to prep for the dinner shift. If you go during these times (especially early in the week) you can always avoid a wait. It's also faster to be seated if you are just two people (since you can sit at the bar or a table). Once you are more than three, it's always a longer wait.",5.0
"If you dont want to travel to the City, Chuko is the place to go.  This ramen place makes excellent soup base and noodle is cooked just right.  The place is much better than Naruto or other Ramen places in Brooklyn.  $13 a bowl of ramen ...... but I think it's worth it.",4.0
"It's good but it didn't fully hit the spot.  If you miss the lunch or dinner openings, expect a wait.  Extra noodles are a good bargain, especially since I find the ramen prices higher than other houses.  If you're in the area, definitely try. Otherwise, not sure if I would cross a borough.",3.0
"Great little spot and very happy to have it in the neighborhood. Enjoyed the crispy brussels, kale salad (WOW!), and the pork ramen. All very delicious. My companion really enjoyed the kimchi pork ramen. The service was quick and fantastic. Only demerit would be the odd layout, which doesn't leave any room if you have to wait for a table. The impression we had was that we were supposed to leave until they called us (they took my cell #) or wait outside. No big deal, but it was just ice cold the night we were there. Would have been nice to order a drink and wait inside...",4.0

"I have to say, the ramen is still amazing, but the service is much more spotty.  The waits are as long as ever, and the place gets crowded.  The last 4 times I tried to go the waits exceeded the estimate and we gave up.  After finally going on the 5th try we go and order some vegetarian ramen.  The waiter who was repeatedly bumping my chair, without asking us, adds pork belly to it.  When he delivered it, he asked if it would be a problem. Yes, no problem at all - not like the person eating it is vegetarian or anything..",3.0
"It's a surprise to me that this place gets such stellar reviews... Perhaps that's merely a testament to the general state of ramen depravity in Prospect Heights.The pork bun appetizers are five bucks a pop.  Originally I was thinking/hoping that a serving would come with 2 buns.  The pork bun was solid but nowhere near the fatty melt-in-your-mouthiness that other ramen restaurants (ahem, Ippudo) deliver.  The kale salad was a potent combination of crunchiness and saltiness and by far my favorite part of the meal.As for the ramen... the portions are definitely on the smaller side, so for twelve bucks you may feel a bit cheated.  The quality of the pork and other toppings was average at best.  You only get two thin slices of pork with the default settings.  The broth, in my humble opinion, was the most notable misstep; it didn't have a lot of flavor or garlic or pork globules or depth.  It also contained one ingredient that seemed out of place in ramen, but I just couldn't put my finger on what it was.  For once in a long, long time I left a ramen bowl half-uneaten.Definitely don't trouble yourself to travel to Brooklyn just for this ramen, but if you happen to be in the neighborhood and you're dying for a hot soupy noodle infusion, this place may do the trick.",2.0

This place rules. There are a bunch of ramen joints in this general area now but Chuko is the best of all of them both in quality of food and ambiance. I would give them a 5 except for the fact that they don't serve tea. Kind of weird for a Japanese restaurant to not serve tea. There are barely any drinks served here that aren't boozy.

Ramen is my new favorite comfort food and there is something insanely comforting about the broth at Chuko.

There is always a wait but I love that you can leave your phone number and go to the great bar Woodwork across the street.,4.0
I was excited to hear yet another ramen shop pop up in NYC. This time in Prospect Heights Brooklyn opened by former Morimoto cooks. So I thought I'd check it out. I came some friends on a Saturday afternoon. We didn't have to wait long for our table. Most of the patrons here were yuppies who lived in the neighborhood. The menu was small with only a few options for ramen and some appetizers. The prices were ippudo prices for a bowl of ramen starting around 12 bucks while appetizers started from five bucks and up. We started with some shoshito peppers and fried green tomato slider. I was disappointed at the portions for the appetizers. The shoshito peppers were tiny and shriveled up plus they didn't give you the special salt they give you at ippudo. The fried green tomato sliders were nothing special. As for ramen I ordered the miso ramen with pork. When they finally brought it out I smirked at the tiny bowl it came in. This wasn't a good sign. Good ramen places give you a nice size bowl of ramen. Since I was hungry I slurped down the small bowl of noodles. The noodles were overcooked and the broth tasted like Campbell's chicken noodle soup. I was sad that the pork slices weren't chasu pork slices at all but tiny pieces of charged pork (tasted almost like bacon) that were sadder than the pork slices you get at Totto. There wasn't much in terms of toppings. They give you an egg but it's soft boiled like they dropped it in as was cooking. I had high hopes for this place but came away totally underwhelmed. Chuko like Totto will be a big hit in the neighborhood nonetheless since they don't really have any competition and I really doubt a lot of people who live in the area know what good ramen is.,1.0
"Unreal. I can't really add much that hasn't been said. Get pork bone ramen with chicken. The marrow is the open secret and it makes the dish heaven with every sip and bite; rich and juicy. The service was friendly and the place was practically standing-room only. Go on an off hour, if a place this amazing even HAS an off hour, and lose yourself with abandon. I live in Astoria and was here on a date, but I'd go out of my way to come back.",5.0
"I have biked by Chuko for the past 6 months. It took me a while to figure out what it was: a noodle bar. Once I found out it took me countless attempts to actually reach a table or bar. When I finally did make it, I realized that it was so worth the wait!I showed up on a friday night hoping that all the people in front of the place, on the sidewalk were leaving, not waiting for a table. I was sadly mistaken. It was 10:10pm and I was sure my friend (en route) and I would get a seat. I was put on a wait list. I ended up going to nearby bar for a drink while I waited for a table and my companion...kind of disappointing as I would have rather sat at their bar.While I had to endure a drink at a lack-luster, generic bar, alone, taking in a few strange, one liners, even THAT was worth the wait...my very late companion showed up at 10:45 and we were called for our table at 10:48! I was cool with it...and almost opted to skip dinner all together, but my tardy companion insisted. We showed up and the waitstaff was super pleasant. One table was being cleared for us. They were out of a few things but our waiter gave us the run down on how to order - just in case we hadn't been to a noodle bar before. We both ordered the Miso, I with pork and my companion with chicken, etc. He ordered the Gyoza. We drank water.The Gyoza came, and it was fine. I know better than to order that. i tried one, it was fine. I rather go to a dumpling house if I am getting gyoza. these were ordinary, nothing special. Again, this is a noodle house. My companion lamented over his appetizer order...Our bowls of ramen came soon enough. Wow, they looked gorgeous. the broth was thick, the egg was perfectly cooking; poaching slowly in the soupy murkiness. my pork slices were the proper thickness and still cooking in the broth and so tender, moist and fresh. the noodles - graspable yet not too soft or overcooked (perfectly workable with the japanese style chopsticks...even tho my companion seemed to have a hard time with them - I watched his less experienced maneuvers as he slathered himself in soup splash...) the sweet corn and scallions perfectly complimented the saltiness of the miso. The taste of the broth - heaven! By the end of the bowl I was a little salted out. I left a lot of the broth, but little if nothing else.The waiter was so amicable. He didn't smother nor was he aloof. He was spot on. The bartender and all the waitstaff did NOT make us feel rushed or anything, even tho we were the last table in the joint. (So many places do that after seating you moments before 'last call'.) These guys were great. Made me feel super comfortable.I found out one of the owners was Australian, explains a ramen bar in Brkln. I lived in Oz for a while and the authentic mix of Asian variety is known well there. The place was decorated with the simplicity of Japanese design and I appreciated  that. Menu is simple and straight forward. and the experience-Perfect. Apparently they are waiting on liquor or BYOB status, so have your drinks before hand and they will call you when your table is ready. OH, they are also open for lunch on the weekend. Thanks Chuko, i will definitely see you again soon!!!",5.0
"My friend had the miso ramen and i had the soy ramen, we both added chicken.

I'd recommend you get it, with dressing on the side.Their sake spritzers were really tasty and went well with our apps.My favorite, surprisingly, was their pork bun -- i swear they rival momofuku's & ippudo's.

I had the widely praised pork bone ramen, along with an order of gyoza. The gyoza came out first, and looked beautiful. Biting into them was a major letdown. Unlike the delicate, thin-skinned gyoza you get at Japanese places like Totto, this version is very thick-skinned and chewy, like a dumpling from your local Chinese take out joint. The filling itself is fine, if bland, but eating these gyoza is so unpleasant that I left some behind - and I'm a gyoza freak. OK on to the ramen. Again, appearance was very nice. I added pork for $2 extra, making it a rather expensive bowl at $15. For that, I got a nicely cooked egg. Everything else was inedible, since it was swimming in the most intensely over-salted broth I've ever tasted. The pork slices were 90% fat, with hardly any meat on them. The noodles were springy, but I couldn't really eat more than a bite, since the one note to the clingy broth was SALT. No pork flavor at all. When I asked for the check I expected the waiter to ask if something was wrong, given that I didn't eat 80% of what I ordered, but he expressed no concern whatsoever. Had I more time I would've complained, but I was in a rush and annoyed that I had made a detour to try this place.Granted, most hipster ramen places are somewhat over-rated, and their reviews rife with hyperbole. But places like Ippudo, Totto, Ganso, Yuji and even old-school favorite Sapporo manage to deliver very solid bowls consistently. Chuko delivered all around incompetence, at a rather high price.",2.0
"i have been looking forward to this opening of morimoto vets jamison blakenship and david koon.  when i was told wednesday would be the night, i was there.  there was a group standing outside opening night.  it would be a 30-45 minute for a table for two.  the waitress did ask if we lived in the hood and would call us when our table was ready.  that's a nice touch.  called me in 30 and were seated.  we started with the pork gyoza ($7), which were good but not mind blowing and i thought my pork was like underdone in one of them. as the waitress explained, the thicker the broth the thicker the noodle.  i went with the middle road and  had the soy ramen with berkshire pork ($12).  the broth was tasty and i would have to say the best thing about the dish. my noodles were chewy, but unfortunately all clumped and stuck together.  :(  the pork wasn't tender as i was expecting.  the egg was nicely cooked though with a golden soft yolk.  i'm not a fan of yolks and i devoured it.  maybe i set my expectations too high, but i was disappointed.  i did have my roomie's lighter pork broth and thinner noodle ramen.  she had chicken which i liked better, but still my soy broth was better. the service was good on a opening night and i felt like there were more servers than necessary for a tiny 35-seater.  turn around on table is quick. i don't foresee ippudo waits.  i look forward to more stars for chuko.  i'll be back as the menu expands.

My boyfriend's pork bone ramen on the other hand was too rich to enjoy the whole bowl - but deliciously porky & salty. As usual, there was way too much to finish. I really liked the space, but the atmosphere for some reason made me feel like I was in Manhattan. There was sort of a too-cool-for-you vibe, which started right from when we showed up & were told it would be 20-25 minutes for a table, although there were open tables.

On one hand, great, I was hungry, but the hostest told me that they tell everyone 20-25 minutes standard. Don't be fooled! But seriously - if Woodwork hadn't been calling my name, I would have gone next door to Cataldo and gotten a different flavor of noodle.My other issue with the service is that I saw them turning people away before 11pm on a Friday night. With all the bars on Vanderbilt, they could do a really good late night business. Plus, for somewhere so new, it's kind of ballsy to be telling people no at this point.

While the kimchi pickles were good, the brussel sprouts are life changing. I love and have had many preparations of sprouts in my day, but these are right up there at the top. They are so simple too, fried and crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Slathered in fish sauce, peanuts and lime. So simple and soooo good.The ramen was also fantastic. I had the market vegetable ramen in a thick miso broth.

Service was spotty  - there were two waitstaff and one barman.

"It's been almost 2 years since I first went to Chuko. The first time I wasn't impressed with the broth, it tasted significantly like soy milk.

The soft boiled egg was spectacular. One nice thing that Chuko does is bring a small dish of homemade chili garlic oil to add to your bowl.",4.0

"This is my favorite ramen spot in NYC, hands down.  And, to counteract what one of the reviewers said in regards to there being no Asians there, I'm 100% Asian and go there more often than I'd like to admit.  In fact, I'm Korean, and I love their Kimchi Ramen.  It's not like I'm really starved for Kimchi, either (I hit up Flushing at least a few times a month)...it's just really good.  I mean, it's spicy as all hell (to non-spicy eaters), but it's delicious.  Everytime I go there, I really WANT to order the other ramen...but it's kimchi ramen...and I'm Korean.  I can never bring myself to order anything else.I will say that my fiance (who's possibly the most picky eater I've ever met) loves the veggie ramen, and never finishes it.  Therefore, I end up with the best of both worlds (and the worst of one):  I get to each both the kimchi ramen, and her remaining veggie ramen, then pay for it for a few hours as I end up being way too full.Favorites:Kimchi RamenVeggie RamenBrussel SproutsKale SaladChicken WingsPork BunsWhenever we go there, the brussels and the kale salad are a must, which further explains why I feel sickly full after every visit.  I'm always tempted to order the wings and the pork buns, too, but I really can't justify two bowls of ramen and 4 appetizers between the two of us.  Plus, I just might end up killing myself by eating so much.The wait is LONG...it's true.  The great part (as some have said) is that they will take your phone number and call you when your table is ready.  Additionally, if you go across Vanderbilt to Woodworks, they will give you $1 off well drinks and draft beer, but you have to tell them you're waiting for Chuko.To those of you who have complained about there being a wait at a restaurant in Brooklyn:  keep in mind that it's not the restaurant causing the wait.  The staff moves very quickly to get people in and out of the door as fast as possible.  It's all about the laws of supply and demand.  If nobody went there, there would be no wait.  Therefore, if you don't want to eat there, don't...you'll be just making it easier for others to get seated faster.  In other words, there's a pretty clear reason why people are forced to wait.",5.0
"This place is great. $12 for a large bowl of raman and about $7 for apps. Not a huge menu, about 4 different types of raman but you can't really go wrong. We live around the corner and have been here a few times. Wings are tasty and so is the soft shell crab  and pork bun. The double pork ramen is their signature. I thought it was a bit salty but was still tasty. My favorite is the kimchi raman - a bit spicy with just the right amount of pork running through it.I like it but the raman restaurant, zuzu raman still gets my top vote!",4.0

"I wish I could give this place 3.5 stars, because it doesn't quite deserve 4, but it's not bad enough to be 3 either. There's really only one mark against the place, but it is kind of significant.I see from previous reviews that other diners have found the waitstaff friendly, helpful, and prompt. The waiter that served my friends and me this weekend was none of those things. (Maybe prompt.) He seemed to find our questions beyond idiotic, and was insulting to my friend who attempted to defuse the tension with a self-deprecating joke. It really doesn't sell the experience if one of the waiters is rude and makes everyone at the table stop talking when he approaches to fill the water glasses.That said, the ramen is very delicious. I would absolutely go again for the food, but would give the place a good eyeball before choosing a seat in Dreadlocks McGee's section, lest he impart more trenchant repartees.",3.0
"Probably the best choice for ramen in Brooklyn albeit a tad on the pricey side. I think it's cash only too. Does it quite reach the lofty heights of THE place in Manhattan? No, but it's very close and doesn't have the mult-hour wait associated with the visit.",4.0

Something that tasted like corn and something else that had the consistency of beans.  I asked the barkeep if either of those ingredients were in the broth, and he said no.I guess I'm just going to have to come back to solve the mystery!",4.0

"Excellent ramen and as others have noted, the kale salad is amazing. Who knew a bunch of leaves could be so tasty? Ordered the soy ramen with chicken. Noodles were perfectly cooked. The hardboiled egg was perfectly cooked - golden yellow and a little soft on the inside.I went on Sunday afternoon, there was no wait although the dining room was mostly filled. Service was spotty  - there were two waitstaff and one barman. I had to chase down the waitstaff to order, to get more garlic sauce, get the bill, etc. Pricing is pretty standard for a big bowl of noodles - $13 for the ramen and $8 for the salad. Cash only and there is an atm on site.",4.0
"It's been almost 2 years since I first went to Chuko. The first time I wasn't impressed with the broth, it tasted significantly like soy milk. This time it was MUCH better, on par with the big names in Manhattan. The pork was better, melt in your mouth tender and flavorful. The broth a good blend of pork and chicken flavor. The soft boiled egg was spectacular. One nice thing that Chuko does is bring a small dish of homemade chili garlic oil to add to your bowl.",4.0

"This is my favorite ramen spot in NYC, hands down.  And, to counteract what one of the reviewers said in regards to there being no Asians there, I'm 100% Asian and go there more often than I'd like to admit.  In fact, I'm Korean, and I love their Kimchi Ramen.  It's not like I'm really starved for Kimchi, either (I hit up Flushing at least a few times a month)...it's just really good.  I mean, it's spicy as all hell (to non-spicy eaters), but it's delicious.  Everytime I go there, I really WANT to order the other ramen...but it's kimchi ramen...and I'm Korean.  I can never bring myself to order anything else.I will say that my fiance (who's possibly the most picky eater I've ever met) loves the veggie ramen, and never finishes it.  Therefore, I end up with the best of both worlds (and the worst of one):  I get to each both the kimchi ramen, and her remaining veggie ramen, then pay for it for a few hours as I end up being way too full.Favorites:Kimchi RamenVeggie RamenBrussel SproutsKale SaladChicken WingsPork BunsWhenever we go there, the brussels and the kale salad are a must, which further explains why I feel sickly full after every visit.  I'm always tempted to order the wings and the pork buns, too, but I really can't justify two bowls of ramen and 4 appetizers between the two of us.  Plus, I just might end up killing myself by eating so much.The wait is LONG...it's true.  The great part (as some have said) is that they will take your phone number and call you when your table is ready.  Additionally, if you go across Vanderbilt to Woodworks, they will give you $1 off well drinks and draft beer, but you have to tell them you're waiting for Chuko.To those of you who have complained about there being a wait at a restaurant in Brooklyn:  keep in mind that it's not the restaurant causing the wait.  The staff moves very quickly to get people in and out of the door as fast as possible.  It's all about the laws of supply and demand.  If nobody went there, there would be no wait.  Therefore, if you don't want to eat there, don't...you'll be just making it easier for others to get seated faster.  In other words, there's a pretty clear reason why people are forced to wait.",5.0
"This place is great. $12 for a large bowl of raman and about $7 for apps. Not a huge menu, about 4 different types of raman but you can't really go wrong. We live around the corner and have been here a few times. Wings are tasty and so is the soft shell crab  and pork bun. The double pork ramen is their signature. I thought it was a bit salty but was still tasty. My favorite is the kimchi raman - a bit spicy with just the right amount of pork running through it.I like it but the raman restaurant, zuzu raman still gets my top vote!",4.0

"I wish I could give this place 3.5 stars, because it doesn't quite deserve 4, but it's not bad enough to be 3 either. There's really only one mark against the place, but it is kind of significant.I see from previous reviews that other diners have found the waitstaff friendly, helpful, and prompt. The waiter that served my friends and me this weekend was none of those things. (Maybe prompt.) He seemed to find our questions beyond idiotic, and was insulting to my friend who attempted to defuse the tension with a self-deprecating joke. It really doesn't sell the experience if one of the waiters is rude and makes everyone at the table stop talking when he approaches to fill the water glasses.That said, the ramen is very delicious. I would absolutely go again for the food, but would give the place a good eyeball before choosing a seat in Dreadlocks McGee's section, lest he impart more trenchant repartees.",3.0
"Probably the best choice for ramen in Brooklyn albeit a tad on the pricey side. I think it's cash only too. Does it quite reach the lofty heights of THE place in Manhattan? No, but it's very close and doesn't have the mult-hour wait associated with the visit.",4.0

"Eff chicken noodle soup--ramen is where it's at, especially on a cold, dreary day. There's nothing like climbing a barstool, shoving your face into your food, fogging up your glasses, and slurping your woes away. Nowadays it seems like everyone has their own take on ramen. Well, there's nothing traditional about Chuko, so adjust your expectations. From the minimalist bar set-up, to the pretty bunch of tattooed waiters (excellent service btw), to the Black Keys and Johnny Cash playing in the background...whether that's your thing or not, who cares? When it comes to ramen, I judge the party inside the bowl. The broth is rich, layered in flavor, and slightly creamy (translation = it's filling). The noodles have near perfect texture. Most of their ramens are garnished with shaved scallions and garlic slices. Finally, amp it up with their homemade chili oil (optional, on the side) and BAM! All the flavors hit home.

Most of the appetizers I've tried pale in comparison to the ramen, so I typically just cut to the chase when I sit down to eat. However, the kale salad is not to be missed: raw and tempura-fried kale in a miso dressing with pickled raisins blow my mind every time.

At around 8pm the hostess called to say that our table was ready - perfect timing! I ordered the miso ramen and it was perfectly delightful, with just the right miso-y flavor and flawless noodles.

"So happy this place opened in the neighborhood! My comparison in ramen is always Momofuku - I haven't been to Japan to try ramen (one day!) but think Momofuku ramens are amazing. So, in comparison to that, I think Chuko is awesome. Kale salad - wow. Both the crispy and the fresh are a perfect marriage in a bowl. The dressing is outrageous, light and bright but with a nice bit of savory burst to add that umami. The raisins sounds like it would be an odd combo but they give it another subtle element of sweetness. Unexpected but it works perfectly.Brussel sprouts - carmelized and hits all the right notes. De-lish! Just get them.2 Ramens - pork bone broth with chicken. I loved this. The broth was very rich, but with the velvety chicken,  it was a nice balance. There are also some greens in there and oh! a soft boiled egg perfectly cooked. Second soup was Kimchi pork. I was not as much a fan of this, but my husband loved it. This is only my personal preference as I don't really like kimchi all that much but if you like or love it - you will be super happy with this soup. Also, everything is very reasonably priced - I was amazed at how inexpensive it was for such high quality food.I would give a 5 but we only tried 2 ramens and 2 apps so there are a few more things on the menu. Also, it would be great if there were a few more options like sides of veggies and maybe another appetizer or two as the menu is very small.The guy behind the bar was really nice, attentive and helpful. I don't know why there are so many complaints about the service because ours was perfect and it looked like the other customers were happy and content. In any event, the food is so good and reasonably priced that if you are complaining about the service - get over it!",4.0

"Since my visit to Tokyo 2 years ago, I've been searching for ramen places here in NYC that could match up.  I'd have to say that the miso and tonkotsu (pork bone) ramen here are a close match.  We ordered the salt & pepper wings, miso ramen and pork bone ramen.  All of the dishes were good.  Salt & Pepper Wings was crispy and well seasoned but may not be worth your $7.Miso ramen had the best broth amongst the two.  It had just the right amount of miso to thicken up the soup and enough flavor.  This dish is served with thick noodles, so get this if that's what you prefer.Pork bone ramen (tonkostsu) was milky and was a tad saltly at first sip.  This one's served with thin ramen noodles which is not my favorite but it does pair up nicely with the broth.Both ramen dishes are served with perfectly cooked eggs!  Kudos to Chuko on this.  I think it's the only ramen place in NYC that gets it right!  with the yolks runny enough for you to mix into the soup.What's holding me back on giving it 5 stars?  The mini slivers of pork topping kills it for me.  It ain't the perfect ramen for me if it's missing the fatty charsu pork.Chuko has definitely made it to my top 5 go to places for ramen.1.

"I've recently been sampling local ramen joints and Chuko is now on the top of my list! We got there at 6:30pm on a Saturday night, expecting a long wait. The hostess took our number and said it would be around 90 minutes. So we went across the street to Weather Up and enjoyed some lovely fancy cocktails. At around 8pm the hostess called to say that our table was ready - perfect timing! I ordered the miso ramen and it was perfectly delightful, with just the right miso-y flavor and flawless noodles. My friend ordered the veggie ramen after confirming that the broth was indeed vegetarian, and she loved hers too. Highly recommend.",5.0
"At first, I really happy there was a neighborhood ramen joint with a vegetarian ramen option. Then I wasn't impressed at all with the vegetarian ramen because it didn't have anything in it but noodles, corn and sliced scallions for $12. BUT THEN, I gave it another chance several weeks later and they must have learned something because they added more toppings into the bowl and they were all delicious additions! Now the appetizers and sides... always great combinations of ingredients however I do think they are always a bit too salty and greasy, not just for my taste, but for Japanese food period. All in all... not bad, will do on a cold winter night but not amaaazing.",3.0
"Came in for a quick late dinner and was very satisfied.  Delicious ramen and gyoza. I didn't think the egg was seasoned well, but maybe it's a NYC ramen thing since other places had the same bland tasting egg. I ordered the tonkatsu ramen which wasn't overly fatty or rich - just right for a cold day. Highly recommend.",4.0
"So happy this place opened in the neighborhood! My comparison in ramen is always Momofuku - I haven't been to Japan to try ramen (one day!) but think Momofuku ramens are amazing. So, in comparison to that, I think Chuko is awesome. Kale salad - wow. Both the crispy and the fresh are a perfect marriage in a bowl. The dressing is outrageous, light and bright but with a nice bit of savory burst to add that umami. The raisins sounds like it would be an odd combo but they give it another subtle element of sweetness. Unexpected but it works perfectly.Brussel sprouts - carmelized and hits all the right notes. De-lish! Just get them.2 Ramens - pork bone broth with chicken. I loved this. The broth was very rich, but with the velvety chicken,  it was a nice balance. There are also some greens in there and oh! a soft boiled egg perfectly cooked. Second soup was Kimchi pork. I was not as much a fan of this, but my husband loved it. This is only my personal preference as I don't really like kimchi all that much but if you like or love it - you will be super happy with this soup. Also, everything is very reasonably priced - I was amazed at how inexpensive it was for such high quality food.I would give a 5 but we only tried 2 ramens and 2 apps so there are a few more things on the menu. Also, it would be great if there were a few more options like sides of veggies and maybe another appetizer or two as the menu is very small.The guy behind the bar was really nice, attentive and helpful. I don't know why there are so many complaints about the service because ours was perfect and it looked like the other customers were happy and content. In any event, the food is so good and reasonably priced that if you are complaining about the service - get over it!",4.0

"I was very excited to see a ramen shop open in the neighborhood, and leapt at the first chance to check it out. As a point of reference, I like to use Kambi (at 14th and 1st) as the bar for good ramen at a reasonable price in New York. Chuko is fairly tasty, but lacks in a handful of areas. The first, and perhaps most important, being the amount and quality of the noodles. They're good, but you're probably not going to leave ""full"" or thinking ""man, those were good noodles."" Instead, you'll have enjoyed the broth but not been blown away by anything else.While probably not on the top of the requirements of many ramen eaters, is presentation. If you care, Chuko was definitely lacking in this department. All the elements were there, but when it arrived at my table, my ramen looked like a bowl of soup with some scallion piled in the center. This may have been due to the low quantity of noodles (see above). But, as I've said before, the broth was tasty.Finally, with the above thoughts in mind, I was disappointed with the higher price point than I expected from passable to decent ramen. At $12 a bowl, the ramen wasn't worth it.

"Anyone who lives in Prospect Heights knows that there isn't a decent bowl of ramen to be found anywhere near our neighborhood, so I was ecstatic to hear about a ramen shop opening up on Vanderbilt. No longer would I have to trek it into the city for good ramen from Totto Ramen and Minca. I could just take a nice 10-minute walk and have a hot bowl of ramen whenever I wanted.I got totally ahead of myself.The restaurant itself is cute; small but airy with bare-brick walls and an attentive staff. My girlfriend and I started with the shishito pepper appetizer, which was delightful, except for the fact that it was sea-salted to death. It was good (this is very similar to a roasted pepper appetizer you see in a lot of Spanish tapas joints), but so salty that my girlfriend and I had to scrape/shake off the salt while taking mouthfuls of water in between each savory pepper.We resisted the urge to finish the peppers (""We should wait until our ramen comes so we can wash off the salt in our broth."") and waited for our ramen. I got the miso ramen with berkshire pork, and she chose the pork broth ramen with berkshire pork. We hungrily dug in. If you are looking for any sort of good authentic ramen, look elsewhere. My miso ramen broth was fatty and lacked the powerful oomph of a good ramen broth. I suspect they use bacon meat for their pork, because a strange smoked bacon odor emanated from the broth, which made me feel slightly nauseous. Don't get me wrong. I LOVE bacon. It was just the combination of the bacon smell and the ridiculously fatty but tasteless broth that made me feel like I was literally drinking blended fat. Gross. Speaking of blended fat, my girlfriend's ramen lacked flavor and was strangely milky. At first I thought it might be that they added dairy to the broth, but then we realized it must be pureed pork fat. The noodles themselves were good enough but nothing to write home about. $12 for this? You must be kidding. I could get better ramen in Tokyo for $6. All in all, the only saving grace was the homemade garlic ra-yu (spicy oil), of which we added copious amounts to the broth.Now I have to go get some good ramen to make up for this disappointment!

"ippudo is still the gold standard of ramen for me, but sometimes, a girl just can't trek to manhattan and wait 2 hours for a $15 bowl.chuko is not the same, but just as good.efficient and friendly service, quality food.  and they finally got their liquor license!  only beer and sake for now i think, but you really shouldn't be throwing down shots of tequila with your ramen anyway.friday night at 8, there was about a 20 minute wait but they take your number and there are plenty of bars around there.the kale salad is amazing, it's seemingly simple but once again, my life motto of ""if you deep fry a shoe, it'll taste good"" is corroborated.the pork bone ramen is delicious, rich creamy broth, but not overwhelmingly so.  pretty light in flavor but that helps you tell yourself you didn't just consume 1000 calories in liquids.my only complaint is that for $7, i would've expected more than one solitary pork bun.  good, but i think they're only $5 for 2 at ippudo and you can just get those at the bar without the wait.",4.0
"This place exceeded my expectations.  I had their miso ramen w/ pork ($12) and an order of the brussel sprouts ($7).  Both were amazing.  The ramen had just the right amount of firmness and the soup base wasn't too salty.  The ingredients mixed well together.  The brussel sprouts were cooked to perfection.  It has a little spicey kick to it but for some reason it was so addictive.  I wanted to order more but found it pricey for a small order.  I went on a Monday night and by 7ish, the place started piling up.  Go early!  They dont accept reservations.  This place is tiny so not suggested for large groups of over 4.",5.0

"Anyone who lives in Prospect Heights knows that there isn't a decent bowl of ramen to be found anywhere near our neighborhood, so I was ecstatic to hear about a ramen shop opening up on Vanderbilt. No longer would I have to trek it into the city for good ramen from Totto Ramen and Minca. I could just take a nice 10-minute walk and have a hot bowl of ramen whenever I wanted.I got totally ahead of myself.The restaurant itself is cute; small but airy with bare-brick walls and an attentive staff. My girlfriend and I started with the shishito pepper appetizer, which was delightful, except for the fact that it was sea-salted to death. It was good (this is very similar to a roasted pepper appetizer you see in a lot of Spanish tapas joints), but so salty that my girlfriend and I had to scrape/shake off the salt while taking mouthfuls of water in between each savory pepper.We resisted the urge to finish the peppers (""We should wait until our ramen comes so we can wash off the salt in our broth."") and waited for our ramen. I got the miso ramen with berkshire pork, and she chose the pork broth ramen with berkshire pork. We hungrily dug in. If you are looking for any sort of good authentic ramen, look elsewhere.

We had 2 stool at the bar and were waited on by a very nice young man who was extremely attentive. Our water glasses never got half full (half empty) and the spicy pickles we noshed on were tasty. We both ordered the veggie ramen with the runny egg. Neither of us were paying much attention to the wait but I guess it took a while because the waiter started to apologize for it. ""No big deal!"" we replied and returned to our conversation. Then he apologized again saying he wanted to insure we didn't get ""shitty noodles"" (well appreciated). Still, we didn't think much of it. He was very polite and really, what could we do! A few minutes pasted and we were talking about our lunch that day and the waiter interrupted to say the ramen would be right out but that the chef felt so bad about the wait that he was buying us our dinner. WHAT?! That never happens. I could tell I wasn't the only one that felt this was unnecessary. Still, can't argue with free dinner. Soooo we started eating wondering about all of this.

"Yay, ramen in Brooklyn! And a damn fine experience at that.  The gods of cheap airfares and reasonable lodging hath deposited me in Brooklyn this visit.  Normally the borough I pass through between Jamaica and Penn Station on my way in from JFK, on my way to some corporate hotel on Manhattan.  Routine is comfortable and familiar.  Usually my ramen routine is spelled I-p-p-u-d-o or T-o-t-t-o and involves running all over Manhattan.  It's usually the most convenient when you are actually staying somewhere that's on Manhattan.  But I'm in Brooklyn this trip at the Sheraton Brooklyn NY.  The hotel is close enough to two subway stations but the question is, where to eat?  There's nothing around the hotel.  And it's bloody cold (4C) outside on top of it.  I google ""Brooklyn Ramen"" and an article praising Chuko pops up as ""good ramen"".  Must try!  And so it's on the train and a 10 minute walk to the corner of Dean and Vanderbilt in Prospect Heights.  Despite being a frigid Friday night, the hostess (Hi Susan!) explains the brief menu and seats me immediately at a window seat.  Much has been written about the decor.  It still is modern Japanese minimalist.  Nice! It could use some hooks under the counter to hang your coat/hat/purse.  The special for the evening was the kimchi pork ramen in red miso broth which I promptly ordered.  Since it was cold out (did I mention?), I decided that kimchi would be great for some heat.  The menu is basic; only 4 versions of ramen (including vegetarian!), a handful of appetizers and fizzy beverages.  No liquor but strangely, it wasn't missed.  You need your tastebuds to enjoy the subtle-ness of the red miso broth.  The kimchi in the broth was mildly spicy with out the vinegar taste.  That was good because nothing should overwhelm the broth, which is there, of course to keep the noodles warm.  And the noodles themselves, were cooked just slightly past al dente; springy but still firm and a touch curly.  That means ""not soggy"".  Yay!   And if you want more, they do offer kae-dama according to their FB page.  About a third of the way into the bowl, the hostess brought out a saucer of a homemade hot oil/sauce concoction.  I forgot what the name of it was but it was the perfect compliment to the broth.  First I poured in the oil to sample the heat.  After realizing that the heat released was the sneaky kind (I like!)  then the chunks of garlic and spice were poured in and stirred.  That's how I finished the noodles.  The bits of ground pork that sank to the bottom of the bowl while I was devouring the noodles and raving about the broth thickened what was left and was almost like another course.  The egg would be the only thing I would nitpick.  In the States (OK, California), it's hard to get an egg with ramen that's anything but hard boiled.  In Japan I usually get tamago that's soft boiled (hard egg white, soft liquid yolk).  The egg here should be eaten quickly because it was both soft egg white and yolk and I wound up having to shoot it from my soup spoon.  Much has been written about the service here.  Unless you're a diva that needs to be tended to hand and foot, the service here was excellent.  The staff knew their food and why it was good.  That's a rarity for a lot of ramen shops here.  They were also friendly and without the hipster attitude that dooms many places out here, despite how the food may be.  So, do I like? Yes.  Let's put it this way.  I finished the broth.  I'll give it 4 stars for now because it was my first visit and I've only had one item on the menu.  If the next bowl (tonkotsu!) is like this first time, that extra star will show up magically!  As long as the gods of cheap airfares and reasonable lodging are willing.",4.0

"Hey this place is pretty good.  Yes, a bit overpriced, but nice atmosphere.  We had the brussels sprouts app w fish sauce, which was delicious.

"UPDATE AS OF 4/18/13 - ONE OF MY FAVORITE PLACES.  5 stars to the max.  Service is good, food is good, it's consistent.  Go.  Go now.Below is original review:This was a good meal.  I'm not giving it 5 stars yet, as I've only been once, but my first trip left me satisfied.  Also, I've never had gourmet ramen, either, so I have little to compare it to except the 99 cent stuff...but I eat a lot of different food, so, I trust my palate to tell me what's good.I got the vegetarian ramen option, and it was hearty, tasty, and filling.  I like that it's not too salty.  And their chunky HOMEMADE CHILI GARLIC stuff in oil was AMAZING.  It was the only extra seasoning they put on your table.  Roasted sweet slivers of garlic, with chili and oil.  My only complaint, actually, was that I wanted a HOTTER option, too.  I wanted what they gave me(which I ate two servings of, some not even in the soup, just bites of it it was that good), and then I also wanted an option that would make my lips burn and nose run, at least a little bit.  Sometimes you can't taste food as well that way, but sometimes a bit or two of that hottness in between normal bites would have been a good balance.  That would have made it pretty perfect.Also, go for the hard-boiled egg, NOT the soft-poached.  With the soft-poached, there's no texture or actual experience of the egg once it mingles with the liquid, it just kind of falls apart.Anyway, I will be back.  In fact...I kind of want it again right now...and I only went last night...",5.0

"Blending in with the vintage stores and hole in the wall eateries, Chuko's interior resembles that of a sauna; wood paneled walls and minimal furniture, including a long wood bar. The wooden interior is juxtaposed against steel chairs, both at the bar and the small cafe size tables. After an average wait for a much buzzed about restaurant, 45 minutes to an hour, my girlfriend and I enjoyed a brussel sprouts appetizer. The sprouts charred salty flavor were complemented superbly with sweet roasted peanuts. For a main course, we both enjoyed the pork bone marrow ramen special. Our server described this dish perfectly. The pork bone marrow gave a rich flavor to the broth which was laden with tangy mustard greens, egg, and sweet succulent pork belly. The homemade chili oil they serve gives the mellow broth the extra kick, without being overpowering. Most importantly, the ramen earns high marks for its lack of sodium. Many ramen broths can taste like a salt-lick, but this one was flavorful without being flagged on Bloomberg's sodium restaurant watch-list. As every good ramen dish deserves a good beverage, I opted for a micro-brew, Coedo Shiro, which non-filtered wheat flavor brought out the complexities in the food I ate. Sapporo as well as sake are available as well. The service was paced well and friendly without being ignored. I would have appreciated a check-in after our food was delivered to see if we liked everything, but I assume the busy atmosphere kept the servers under the right assumption.",4.0

"UPDATE AS OF 4/18/13 - ONE OF MY FAVORITE PLACES.  5 stars to the max.  Service is good, food is good, it's consistent.  Go.  Go now.Below is original review:This was a good meal.  I'm not giving it 5 stars yet, as I've only been once, but my first trip left me satisfied.  Also, I've never had gourmet ramen, either, so I have little to compare it to except the 99 cent stuff...but I eat a lot of different food, so, I trust my palate to tell me what's good.I got the vegetarian ramen option, and it was hearty, tasty, and filling.  I like that it's not too salty.  And their chunky HOMEMADE CHILI GARLIC stuff in oil was AMAZING.  It was the only extra seasoning they put on your table.  Roasted sweet slivers of garlic, with chili and oil.  My only complaint, actually, was that I wanted a HOTTER option, too.  I wanted what they gave me(which I ate two servings of, some not even in the soup, just bites of it it was that good), and then I also wanted an option that would make my lips burn and nose run, at least a little bit.  Sometimes you can't taste food as well that way, but sometimes a bit or two of that hottness in between normal bites would have been a good balance.  That would have made it pretty perfect.Also, go for the hard-boiled egg, NOT the soft-poached.  With the soft-poached, there's no texture or actual experience of the egg once it mingles with the liquid, it just kind of falls apart.Anyway, I will be back.  In fact...I kind of want it again right now...and I only went last night...",5.0

"Blending in with the vintage stores and hole in the wall eateries, Chuko's interior resembles that of a sauna; wood paneled walls and minimal furniture, including a long wood bar. The wooden interior is juxtaposed against steel chairs, both at the bar and the small cafe size tables. After an average wait for a much buzzed about restaurant, 45 minutes to an hour, my girlfriend and I enjoyed a brussel sprouts appetizer. The sprouts charred salty flavor were complemented superbly with sweet roasted peanuts. For a main course, we both enjoyed the pork bone marrow ramen special. Our server described this dish perfectly. The pork bone marrow gave a rich flavor to the broth which was laden with tangy mustard greens, egg, and sweet succulent pork belly. The homemade chili oil they serve gives the mellow broth the extra kick, without being overpowering. Most importantly, the ramen earns high marks for its lack of sodium. Many ramen broths can taste like a salt-lick, but this one was flavorful without being flagged on Bloomberg's sodium restaurant watch-list. As every good ramen dish deserves a good beverage, I opted for a micro-brew, Coedo Shiro, which non-filtered wheat flavor brought out the complexities in the food I ate. Sapporo as well as sake are available as well. The service was paced well and friendly without being ignored. I would have appreciated a check-in after our food was delivered to see if we liked everything, but I assume the busy atmosphere kept the servers under the right assumption.",4.0

"The food here is amazing. I would give it 5 stars but, they don't do lunch, they don't have high chairs (fine you don't want kids here, I'll live with that), and most annoyingly they don't do take out. This last point is really a big problem for me because if you sit down and order then immediately decide you are finished as soon as they bring you your food they will wrap it up for you. This is an example of a stupid rule. I'll kill for their ramen but please adjust your restaurant policies.",4.0
"this is one of my favorite restaurants of all time. the pork bone ramen makes me melt.  the soft shell crab buns and pork belly buns are AMAZING. delicate, full flavored, (a little smaller than i would like, but what can you do), and just incredible.  the fried garlic slices in spicy oil is the best condiment.  they sell little containers of the garlic hot oil to take home, and i strongly recommend you take advantage of that fact. i love you chuko. i bring everyone i care about here, cause they need to know",5.0

Delicious and different. A twist on the traditional but done elegantly. All dishes were very thoughtful.,4.0
"The ramen is delicious and authentic. Fresh noodles, soft boiled egg done expertly and perfectly. Smooth and silky. Can be ordered hard boiled, too. Pickles and kim chi sides add a spicy touch. Chicken wings need more flavor. Service was excellent, too. By 7:30pm the place was packed and so noisy that we had to shout to hear. Some acoustical additions would soften the echo. One less star due to the noise level. Definitely, a wonderful addition ot our neighborhood.",3.0

"The pork belly with grits is so good!!! The pork falls apart in your mouth and the grits is extra creamy. The noodles itself is a little over cooked, but the broth is very tasty. The peppers were very good too, with a little hint of spice.",4.0
"Early review, so offered with a grain of salt:We were pleasantly surprised with the ramen, which I'd happily return for, but we were super disappointed with the apps, which I hope improve dramatically.Pork Bun special was okay.  All pretty good flavors, but the bun totally overpowered everything.  It was kind of like a brioche, and it's size and sweetness made it hard to even tell what was inside.  Double the meat and cucumber portion inside and it might be really good.Fried Green Tomato Bun was exactly the same as above.  (And a little weird as a concept, in my opinion.)Gyoza were terrible, sad to say.  It was the most offensive, price-wise, too (five little gyoza for $7!!!).  The filling was too plain (good porky flavor, I guess, but scarcely a scallion in sight--it was basically a course ground pork meatball), but worst of all, the skin wasn't cooked.  It had that distinctly raw noodle flavor (which can be seen, tasted, and felt).  The obvious problem was that they tried to do the pan-fried/steamed technique, but they forgot about the steaming part.  Brown them for a minute, then add some water to the pan and throw a lid on top for a few minutes, problem solved.  Or, steam them first (even ahead of time), then quickly pan fry them to order.  The blistered shisito peppers were good.As for the ramens: They aren't traditional, but they are tasty and have traditional flavors.  You choose a broth (pork, miso, soy, or veg) and a topping if you choose (chicken or port).  We tried all but the veg. The portion size was good--not huge, but not too small.  Hungry, I'd definitely need an app to make it a meal.  Starving, I could eat two bowls!  The soft boiled eggs in them were perfect -- perfectly cooked and totally delicious.  The chicken seemed to be sous-vide--or somehow otherwise perfectly gently cooked; I wouldn't normally want chicken in my ramen, but we thought we'd try it and it was actually quite delicious.  Super juicy and tender.  The pork was fried pork belly (like thick sliced, fresh bacon); in one bowl, the pieces happened to be a little dry (lower fat pieces, maybe), though in another bowl they were perfect.  Seemed odd at first (us being huge fans of perfectly briased/boiled/roasted fatty, tender pork found in more traditional ramens), but it was pretty good. I don't like a ton of other stuff in ramen (aka, Sapporo style), but I like a little more... The different bowls had a tiny bit of scallion and/or a tiny bit of greens and/or a tiny bit of corn--all of which were good, but I would have preferred a little more for texture and flavor.  The hot pepper oil they brought out to add optionally was DELICIOUS.  It has toasted garlic in it, which adds a great crunch, too.  Don't miss it.  All of the soups were on the extra salty side, which of course is pretty standard for ramen, even to my heavy-salt taste. The pork broth was pretty good.  Rich and very creamy.  It had the noodles that were a bit straighter and softer (though not as soft as Ippudo's). And the soy broth was delicious.  That was our clear favorite, especially with the addition of the hot pepper oil.  It was rich and not overpoweringly soy-ish; just right.  And the noodles were great--the traditional slightly curly ones, with lots of good tooth to them.  The miso broth was okay.  A little bland with more of a salty taste than miso-y.  Very mild miso, maybe.  The noodles were good--maybe the same as the soy broth noodles, but they were a little softer, maybe just cooked a hair more.Service was extra friendly, the place is casual and nice.   I'll look forward to returning, and will hope that it gets even better (especially those apps!).",3.0
"i go to chuko at least once a week because i'm completely hooked on their kimchi ramen. it's off the chain amazing, and i typically find ramen overrated. tonight, i decided to branch out and try the pork bone ramen. it wasn't a love connection, totally fine, it happens. our waiter came over and asked if i wanted it to go, when i declined i explained that i wasn't a big fan. as a result, he insisted on bringing me a different one the house - so unbelievably unnecessary and nice. at first i declined because again, it was my fault i ordered it. but he was so insistent that i leave with a good meal in my belly so i thankfully accepted and went back to my standard kimchi.great job chuko -  what a way to establish yourself in the neighborhood.",5.0
