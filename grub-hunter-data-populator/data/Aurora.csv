"We found Aurora by chance, drawn in by the lovely garden, and didn't regret it for a second. We had fried shrimps and calamari- one of the best versions of this dish I have ever had (and since I love calamari, I have tried quite a few). Thin crispy batter, the right amounts of salt and super dense calamari. We also had the octopus, which was great in both flavour and consistency too. We followed with pasta. I had a home made saffron pasta with shrimp ragu. It had a distinct flavour of sea, in a good way, and the pasta was cooked al dente. A great pasta dish. My husband had spaghetti vongole- also good but it as memorable. The service was superb throughout. We got a wine recommended that was great with our food. The proof of how happy we where must have been that we returned for a second dinner during our five night stay in Williamsburg (which was just as good). Don't miss this gem!",5.0
The inside of the restaurant is gorgeous. It is a beautiful space. The food and service was not that gorgeous or beautiful. -Pasta wasn't al dente it was plain undercooked...when it crumbles in your mouth it is not cooked. -Everything was over salted...it was like licking a block of salt...-Everyone who worked there including the hostess was too good to work there...dirty looks and rolling eyes a plenty. -I didn't want to complain because everyone was so plain rude...we ate quickly (well what we could eat) and left immediately and went to a bar across the street and had bar food. Don't come here unless you want some snotty arrogant....too cool for anyone service by a bunch of immature people who really don't have any reason to be. Laughable.,1.0
"Nice Italian brunch spot located in the wonderful Williamsburg!Interesting selection on the menu -- this is definitely a brunch spot if you want to try something a little bit different than your typical brunch without being too wild. I went with the Parma Eggs Benedict which entailed your usual poached eggs paired with prosciutto, ricotta, truffle on a yummy little English muffin and came with three giant potatoes and a tasty salad! Food was well prepared and came out timely.Did not indulge in the cocktail selection here, but went with my usual brunch iced coffee and found it to hit the spot. Service was nice and attentive and always around.We sat in an enclosed outdoor patio area that was really nice and warm and offered tons of sunlight while still shielding us from the bit of chilliness that was lingering about on the day that we went.Prices weren't too bad - for a party of two (no cocktails), the bill was under $40.",4.0
"Food was unreal! I had the Parma Eggs Benedict, with the black truffle, just amazing. I have never thought to add ricotta cheese to eggs bennie, but I'm going to give that a try at home. My friends and I came a on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. We had a 30 minute wait, but it was lovely outside so I didn't mind one bit. All and all the experience was pretty good, we sat outside and enjoyed those warm rays on sun on an exceptionally warm February afternoon. All and all the food was on point and I would definitely return to check out the dinner offerings. Our service was a little spotty, it seemed like we had 2 or 3 waiters, and once we finished we were asked to move to the bar if we wanted to continue our conversation, as there were other tables waiting. I get it - it's Sunday brunch and they want to turn and burn. There was also a HUGE party taking up most of the outdoor area. That being said kind of left a great brunch on a sour note. I'll definitely come back again, as I'd like to dive into the menu more, but will try and hit them up on the earlier side.",3.0
"Grabbed a late (2pm) brunch w friends at this spot and found the crowds to be still in full swing. Despite that, we were seated immediately in the covered back garden. Unfortunately the day was warm so the greenhouse effect was ON, but we resolved with downing multiple pitchers of water. Our server was in full hipster regalia and yet his service was remarkably attentive and gentle. We ordered the strapazzate, frittata, l'inglese, and eggs norwegian - rounding out a bit of the brunch fare with Italian notes. The plates came within a reasonable duration, and were hot and flavorful - no complaints, and no leftovers. Price is right and space is lovely - worth a try if you're in the area.",4.0
"Aurora deserves four stars for their beautifully decorated indoor and outdoor space and the romantic Italian ambiance it provides. The place features dark furniture, exposed brick walls, among other fixtures that you imagine would line a restaurant in a Tuscan village. Outside, they feature a ""secret gardenesque"" seating area, lined with ivy and string lights. This is definitely the perfect setting for staring deep into your lovers eyes as you slurp up some savory Italian fair.I visited for Brunch on a Saturday and ordered the Cavolo Nero salad which featured Tuscan Kale, Brussels Sprouts, and was topped with sharp-white cheese.My friends ordered a variety of Eggs Benedicts (Parma, Norwegian, and Florentine). Every Eggs Benedict plate was accompanied by Rosemary potatoes, a small salad and a coffee.We also ordered the Pompelo drink (a bit bitter for my taste) and the Mimosa ($9 each). I would say that the food at Aurora is very nicely presented. They offer a variety of reasonably priced Italian dishes (including brunch). We felt the drinks are a bit small and overpriced, however. Both the food and service are really good, but nothing out of the ordinary. I will bring my hubby here next time to try out the dinner menu and take in the cozy and amorous environment.",4.0
"What a utter disappointment. I've had this location bookmarked for quite some time now. I was in the area and decided to finally give it a shot with high hopes in mind... But boy, was I in for a treat! Not only did Aurora fail every expectation as a two $$ budget restaurant, but the food was absolutely sub par and portion wise NOTHING for the price. However, the service was prompt and fair. The waiter was friendly and cared about us as customers. He was attentive and doing his job. Me and my boyfriend ordered the mushroom ravioli and the beet salad. We now waited for our food, expecting a normal wait time of about 15-20 minutes. Within 6 minutes, the food came out... This really made me feel uncomfortable because this isn't a McDonald's, it's a upscale and trendy pretentious restaurant in Brooklyn. It really does make me second guess the quality of the food and ingredients they use. For all we know, it could of been microwaved food from the previous night.The portions were extremely small for the extremely high price. For a salad and ravioli, we ended up paying almost $50. This is absolutely absurd. On Yelp, it states how it is average pricing! Not at all! On top of this, we left starving and ended up having to drive to find a open restaurant (M Noodle Shop), which could actually give us a lot of food for a reasonable price. Ambience was rustic and dimly lit. They had cheap paper bags over fake plastic candles. However, this place is LOUD, but not louder than the girl next to us... We really became aquatinted with her and her newest personal problem of a video shoot that has no concept! (BTW, If you're reading this 'director' girl, you're no-concept video sounds awful and cringe worthy. Nobody likes flashbacks... Or acknowledgment that you ordered the same exact meal to the person next to you...) All in all, I will not be back or recommend this to anyone I know.",1.0
"Came here for an early brunch over LDW. Brunch options were of the norm, but missing steak & eggs! We were able to sit in the outdoor space which was lovely since it was a beautiful day.I had the lobster scramble on top of thick brioche bread. It came with a side of summer squash, mint, and parsley salad which was refreshing but weird at the same time. The lobster scramble had a good amount of meat in it, and was delicious!I can imagine dinner being really good by the looks of the photos on Yelp. Will definitely have to come here at night!",3.0
"This cozy Italian restaurant is worth a trip from the city! One of my favorite spots in Williamsburg! The food is delicious, always very fresh and prepared perfectly. We had a beets salad and octopus for an appetizer, both were really good! And the size of portions is very decent! The Branzino main dish was also good, a bit hard to eat because it's not a fillet but the whole fish, but maybe it's more fun this way. The Brussels sprouts were a bit too greasy but still tasted good with the lemon-herb dressing. Almost forgot about the Tiramisy, it's one of the best I've ever had! Highly recommend! Even through we ate a lot I didn't feel over stuffed and heavy at all. Good quality ingredients and healthy cooking methods! Always want to come back to Aurora!",5.0

"This is a cute restaurant in Williamsburg that did not disappoint. I came here for brunch and ordered the prosciutto eggs Benedict. I couldn't believe how delicious it was. It made me question why I had never come here before. The flavor of the prosciutto, eggs and truffles balanced each other perfectly. The home fries that came with the meal were also good. Next time, I want to sit outside. It was too hot and humid on the day I came here. I see myself coming back here for more brunches and dinners in the future!",5.0

"Typical hipster place in Williamsburg. It's cute and rustic but like a typical hipster DB place, they wouldn't seat the entire party without everyone being present. It was Easter Sunday morning at 11AM and quiet. I told my party to go ahead and just start ordering and eating. They did. It was filling up by the time I got there but I ordered and the rest of the party ordered coffee/tea. I got a green fave bean salad which I finished rather quickly. It looked promising and fresh, but I'm not sure what ingredients they used. I started coughing a bit (I'm allergic to preservatives) so I'm convinced something in there - maybe their dressing - was NOT fresh. Waitstaff was pleasant but they wanted us out.

"This was the third time we visited this place and it just got worse with each time (there won't be a fourth time). I can tell you that the ambience is great--the garden adorable. However the food and the service is a whole different story.We (my friend and I) were walking around the neighborhood, with some coffee but figured that we were hungry and went into the restaurant to grab some lunch. As soon as we went in, we were greeted in a very awkward manner..as if the waitress was forced to greet us? Anyway, we were ""seated"" aka the waitress stood with a pissed off expression as we picked our seats. But it turned out the ceiling was dripping with unidentified water droplets??? So we just moved ourselves to a different seat close to the window.Now the food came--a spaghetti dish and a fish dish with spinach. The spaghetti was so overly salty so we had to dilute the saltiness with the spinach from the other dish.However, the saltiest being within this restaurant was the waitress. Now, remember how we went in with our coffee from a different shop? She kept on asking if she could take it or if we were finished with it when she could clearly see that there was coffee left in the cup. I can see how bringing an outside beverage can be annoying. But the lunch was spontaneous and we couldn't just throw away the drinks just to please the waitress and make her (assumably) already bad day less bad. Plus..we ordered 2 significant dishes--it's not like we ordered one salad to share. Anyway..I could feel her bitter aura throughout the meal (so could my friend) and it was so unnecessarily uncomfortable. On top of the abstract attitude, every time we asked for something, a spoon or the check, she kind of threw it on the table..which is never pleasant. I kept on returning because of the atmosphere and the hopes of less salty food and (less salty) waitress but I hit my limit and will not be returning..not that they'll notice anyway.",1.0

It's an extremely popular dish. I know this because every time I see a server, 8/10 he or she is delivering this particular item to a table.If you're here for brunch, you can't go wrong with the Eggs Benedict. I only had eggs benedict once in my entire life, and that was at Aurora. It's quite unfortunate, because now I am honestly afraid of trying it anywhere else. I don't like being disappointed. Obviously. The Ravioli offered in the dinner menu is my favorite. It's light, simple, and it tastes really good. Service is excellent. Everyone is kind and welcoming. Until next time, Aurora.",5.0

"It's been almost a year, but I came back to this place and what do you know, it's still freaking fabulous. Pretty much perfection in all the ways. In fact, this might be my fave Italian place in the city right now. The cool thing about this place is that the menu was TOTALLY different from when I was last here. And that's great. As usual, service and atmosphere are bomb dot com. Sitting outside in the garden is beautiful and our waitress was this lovely Italian chick who was super cool and very nice.We started with the burrata, which came with some tomato toast and prosciutto. And DAMN, it was good. I'd say it's just enough for three people, but not SUPER filling. For two, it's perfect, for four, no way! The mutz was very fresh and the tomato toast had an excellent flavor.Then we all got the Taglierini con Granchio, with crab meat, peppers, and squash and every bite was perfect. Really, I have no complaints. It was so delicious and finally an Italian place that gives you enough good for your $25 bucks. Finally, we got a complimentary dessert, the Bonet di Cioccolato, and it was freaking amazing. Very chocolatey cake with ice cream on top.Really, a very perfect meal. Amounted to about $75 a person with two bottles of wine (for three of us), app and entree. Not bad at all!As soon as they change their menu again, I'll be back!!",5.0

"If you're considering hosting your wedding here, please look elsewhere! While the location is gorgeous and the food is delicious, the event staff and their protocols are completely unacceptable. You aren't even allowed to speak to the event manager on the phone until you've signed a contract (?!?!?) AND she doesn't respond to your emails for at least a week. They will nickel and dime you for everything, and are not willing to budge on any costs whatsoever. When I planned my wedding, I wanted to work with vendors that were excited to share my special day with me. Aurora made me feel like they hated hosting weddings, and I was not going to pay them $30,000 if they weren't going to at least pretend to be nice. Also, the base cost for this place is outrageous. You can have a wonderful wedding elsewhere for much cheaper! When I kindly told their event manager, Irene, that we would move forward with another venue that was more accommodating, she didn't even respond. That is bad business.",2.0
"Hands down the best brunch experience in Williamsburg. Let me preface this by saying we came here on a beautiful day and got a seat on the patio which looks like it's out of a movie set. Ivy covered on the wall, shaded as to avoid the direct sun. The food was incredible, we all got something different. I got the l'englaise breakfast which was great, someone else got the mushroom pasta and another a different mushroom dish (they seem to like their mushrooms... which I dig). The service was split - waiter was great. Bartender had a little of the classic Brooklyn attitude which gave the subtle reminder of ""oh that's right, we're still in Williamsburg...""

"Came for lunch and it was somewhat busy.  It has a nice atmosphere with lots of brick walls and vines coming down some of the walls of the restaurant. I also had a cheese platter and the variety and different textures and flavors rocked my world. The pasta, of course, was excellent.",5.0
"I've eaten here more than five times and I've never been disappointed. Aurora presents the option to sit outdoors. It's even available in colder seasons, thanks to the clear tent that surrounds the dining area. I personally prefer the outdoor seating.The prosciutto and cheese appetizer platter is to die for. It's an extremely popular dish. I know this because every time I see a server, 8/10 he or she is delivering this particular item to a table.If you're here for brunch, you can't go wrong with the Eggs Benedict. I only had eggs benedict once in my entire life, and that was at Aurora. It's quite unfortunate, because now I am honestly afraid of trying it anywhere else. I don't like being disappointed. Obviously. The Ravioli offered in the dinner menu is my favorite. It's light, simple, and it tastes really good. Service is excellent. Everyone is kind and welcoming. Until next time, Aurora.",5.0
"This is def my favorite restaurant in wburg! Although I've never been, but I'm sure their table bread is the most authentic and their tap water tastes better than gin.  Also the first half and the other hand the same time as a result of the day before I get to see you soon enough for you and your friends and family members of his career as a whole bunch of people who don't know what to wear.这么一来学校看着自己喜欢的东西也好的C'è una ragazza di fuoco a me è una cosa del tutto la mia migliore amico",5.0
"It's been almost a year, but I came back to this place and what do you know, it's still freaking fabulous. Pretty much perfection in all the ways. In fact, this might be my fave Italian place in the city right now. The cool thing about this place is that the menu was TOTALLY different from when I was last here. And that's great. As usual, service and atmosphere are bomb dot com. Sitting outside in the garden is beautiful and our waitress was this lovely Italian chick who was super cool and very nice.We started with the burrata, which came with some tomato toast and prosciutto. And DAMN, it was good. I'd say it's just enough for three people, but not SUPER filling. For two, it's perfect, for four, no way! The mutz was very fresh and the tomato toast had an excellent flavor.Then we all got the Taglierini con Granchio, with crab meat, peppers, and squash and every bite was perfect. Really, I have no complaints. It was so delicious and finally an Italian place that gives you enough good for your $25 bucks. Finally, we got a complimentary dessert, the Bonet di Cioccolato, and it was freaking amazing. Very chocolatey cake with ice cream on top.Really, a very perfect meal. Amounted to about $75 a person with two bottles of wine (for three of us), app and entree. Not bad at all!As soon as they change their menu again, I'll be back!!",5.0
"Had brunch here this afternoon - the dish was incredible, portion size was gigantic and flavor was intense. A little heavy on the grease/salt but that's also part of what made it so tasty so I can't complain, but I couldn't eat like that every day. We were given space to drink coffee and keep talking after finishing our food too which was nice. I'll definitely be back!",5.0
"Came here for a late Saturday brunch and was pleasantly surprised at the beautiful decor and sizable, green garden. The bread, olive oil and salt are some of the best I've had and for me that's a huge plus! I also highly recommend the kale and Brussel sprouts salad, totally yummy! The steak and crab meat pasta were also great.",5.0
"Brunch is always top notch here. Eggs Benedict will ruin your ability to have it anywhere else. But let's talk dinner. The mushroom ravioli with truffle...all I can say is holy shit. The best pasta I've ever had, and I lived in Boston for three years where I was sure the North End had everyone but Italy beat. I've never had a bad meal here. I hope it stays this good forever.-Went back a week later. Still the best!",5.0
"Aurora is one of those places that you can sure you'll enjoy your food no matter what you choose.We ordered two mains to split: the scallops w/ crushed corn and the duck ragu pasta (which melts in your mouth). Both were flavored to perfection. And, reasonably priced for the local, organic fare and pasta being home-made.Lastly, they have organic/sustainable wines and a romantic garden if you don't mind waiting. Overall, Aurora aims to please and raises the bar on sustainable fare in Williamsburg.",5.0
"If you're considering hosting your wedding here, please look elsewhere! While the location is gorgeous and the food is delicious, the event staff and their protocols are completely unacceptable. You aren't even allowed to speak to the event manager on the phone until you've signed a contract (?!?!?) AND she doesn't respond to your emails for at least a week. They will nickel and dime you for everything, and are not willing to budge on any costs whatsoever. When I planned my wedding, I wanted to work with vendors that were excited to share my special day with me. Aurora made me feel like they hated hosting weddings, and I was not going to pay them $30,000 if they weren't going to at least pretend to be nice. Also, the base cost for this place is outrageous. You can have a wonderful wedding elsewhere for much cheaper! When I kindly told their event manager, Irene, that we would move forward with another venue that was more accommodating, she didn't even respond. That is bad business.",2.0
"Hands down the best brunch experience in Williamsburg. Let me preface this by saying we came here on a beautiful day and got a seat on the patio which looks like it's out of a movie set. Ivy covered on the wall, shaded as to avoid the direct sun. The food was incredible, we all got something different. I got the l'englaise breakfast which was great, someone else got the mushroom pasta and another a different mushroom dish (they seem to like their mushrooms... which I dig). The service was split - waiter was great. Bartender had a little of the classic Brooklyn attitude which gave the subtle reminder of ""oh that's right, we're still in Williamsburg..."" Which I didn't care for and neither did the others who were with us waiting 10 minutes for our check so we could be seated for brunch.Oh well, I guess perfection is something you always seek and never achieve. Well then they nailed it. Congrats, Aurora",5.0
"We've been going to this restaurant before there was an ""us."" The hubs had lived in Williamsburg for years before we met and it was his go to spot. This was our final stop in our first day date that later lead to our marriage and kid 1 & kid 2 (almost born). We've gone here for the hubs birthday every year, even after we outgrew our 5th floor walk up on South 1st and hopped over to the cheaper borough for more space, we continued frequenting because it was one of those places you can always count on for good Italian food. So it was so disappointing to find that the quality of service and food had gone down so drastically since we were there last (about 3 months I imagine). Maybe our experience is indicative of the lunch service only but really for a restaurant that has been a neighborhood institution, it's awful to see the changes that's happened here. First off - wheat pasta?!? Really?!? That must have been a recent change. There must have been at least three other tables when we sat down and more came in as the lunch hour progressed but service was lax and seemed severely under staffed. We both worked in the restaurant industry for quite a bit of time so maybe we're too picky? But I would think the manager would know a thing or two about points of service- hi, that fresh cracked pepper you offered the other table? We want some of that also. When we returned the octopus salad because it was over cooked, the manager came over and said ""that's the way it's cooked here"" - no sir, it is not. We've had it every time we've come to this restaurant and it's the first time we returned food in the 10+ years we've been here. They were gracious enough to take it off the check and even comp us a free scoop of ice cream for our 3 year old but I would have rather them just say ""yes, you're right, it is over cooked. Can we get you something else instead?"" Highlight was the burrata and prociutto dish but everything else was meh.",2.0

"I want to give 4 stars Bc of how amazingly yummy the pasta w fennel sausage and truffle is but simply can not. I've been here 2 times, ordered the same pasta and was very pleased. Unfortunately the balsamic green fig and Gorgonzola app I can't say the same. Besides there being too much balsamic reduction where it overpowered the sweetness of the fig. The ""Gorgonzola which is a cheese I like even though it's part of the blue family. Tasted like typical blue cheese. My BF and I DO NOT like blue cheese. We almost spit our bite out! That's how blue it was. The waitress came and asked if it was ok and we said no sorry, the menu states gorg but it tastes like straight blue and she apologized. Asked if we wanted something else. We said no. With all of that being said. When we got the bill the app was still on it. We did not ask for it to be taken off the bill but once she asked if we would like something else does that be she would have charged for the second app???  Also a restaurant that states Gorgonzola should use Gorgonzola or simply state they ran out and are using blue for the night. I've had a restaurant try to tell me that blue and gorg was the same. It is clearly not for those who know food/cheese. That's like someone saying white Tuna is albacore and that the milky white tuna is called super white. Let's be real here. I also ordered an extra dirty martini that was terrible. It tasted like vodka with a drop of olive juice and it wasn't even ice cold. So disappointed.

"Had a long wait, but it was a Sunday at brunch time, so that was ok. Seated outside which was not great because the sun hits their glass enclosure and created a hot-house effect outside which wasn't pleasant. They could use some fans outside. In fact while we were there a woman passed out in the garden because it was too hot. They called an ambulance. I ordered a basic fried egg breakfast and while I did ask for my eggs over well, all the rest of my meal was way over cooked, to the point of just being burned. I didn't send it back because it took so long to get in the first place (again it was busy). At the end of the meal, they gave us our bill with a feedback card in it. I filled it out saying the service was good and the people were nice, but I mentioned the problem with the over cooked food. When the waitress took the bill away, I saw her reading the card. She then showed it to the other staff and pointed at me, where at that point the rest of the staff looked and pointed at me and laughed. So because of that, my star rating is low. They should not have read the card until after I left and certainly pointing and laughing at me after I wrote on the feedback card they provided. I'm surprised the management was ok with that behavior because they were there too.",2.0

THE FOOD. Everything - the bread, the olive oil, the burrata, the octopus, the pasta - is awesome! Their pasta is also homemade and so fresh! The menu is seasonal so sometimes that sucks because you crave a dish and they don't have it but you can't blame them! I tried burrata for the first time at Aurora and I can't have it anywhere else - it does not compare!! The menu isn't too large but if are having trouble making a decision - I'd choose a pasta dish over an entree!!I am convinced their lunch and dinner chef is not the same person - dinner def tastes better! Also, they take reservations so definitely make one because sometimes they are ridiculously busy and it stanks when you are craving Aurora but can't go there because they have no tables available! :(ALDKFJAKLSFJDSALKJ BON APPETIT! :)",5.0
"This is a great, solid local Italian restaurant. We went on a Friday night at 8 and only waited about 20 minutes, which we spent at the bar. The ambiance in the garden area is great and felt very romantic with the lighting. We loved sitting out there. To start, we had the croquettes. They were very good...but the order included just two, so it ends up being $4.50 per croquette -- a little pricy. I was eyeing the calamari at the table next to us with envy. For our mains, I ordered the garganelli al sugo calabrese and my boyfriend had the pollo al mattone. Both dishes were fabulous, though I preferred mine. The sauce was super flavorful with just the right amount of spice and the noodles were perfect. The peppers with the chicken dish were also excellent. Those portion sizes were perfect. Finally, we finished with the tiramisu and it was some of the best I've had. Overall, dinner was excellent and we will be returning.",5.0
"As long as Aurora keeps serving the Amarena panacota, I'll never get tired of eating there. Great drinks, awesome food and upbeat atmosphere (music can be a bit loud), Aurora is a great option if you're looking for traditional Italian with a twist. Service is great - kudos to the servers with an Italian accent :)",5.0
"DinnerI have driven past Auora a few times and decided to take my friend for her birthday. Boy was that the best thing I've done. I loved the food, service and ambiance. By far the best Garganelli al Sugo Calabrese I have ever tasted! A must try.",5.0

"We recently had my son and daughter-in-law's rehearsal dinner here. It was amazing! I know it might be hard to believe but every piece of the puzzle was perfect. First, the seating was beautifully done. The waiter was attentive and patient, the drinks and food some of the best I have ever had. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!",5.0
"Came here for an anniversary dinner.  The atmosphere in the covered outdoor seating area is chill yet romantic.  The service was on point.  The octopus here was like none I've tasted before.  It was grilled and spicy which was one of the best combos ever.  My fiance had the cavatelli all isolana.  She did like it however after a while, she got tired of the taste.  I had the garganelli al sugo calabrese.  It was good especially with the spicy pork and the slices of pasta.  The only downside is I wish there was more pasta.  For dessert, we had the tiramisu and the ciabattino di frutta.  The fruit cobbler was apple and it was one of the best desserts I've had.  Pricing here was a little pricier than the typical italian restaurant but the atmosphere makes up for it.",4.0
"Had a long wait, but it was a Sunday at brunch time, so that was ok. Seated outside which was not great because the sun hits their glass enclosure and created a hot-house effect outside which wasn't pleasant. They could use some fans outside. In fact while we were there a woman passed out in the garden because it was too hot. They called an ambulance. I ordered a basic fried egg breakfast and while I did ask for my eggs over well, all the rest of my meal was way over cooked, to the point of just being burned. I didn't send it back because it took so long to get in the first place (again it was busy). At the end of the meal, they gave us our bill with a feedback card in it. I filled it out saying the service was good and the people were nice, but I mentioned the problem with the over cooked food. When the waitress took the bill away, I saw her reading the card. She then showed it to the other staff and pointed at me, where at that point the rest of the staff looked and pointed at me and laughed. So because of that, my star rating is low. They should not have read the card until after I left and certainly pointing and laughing at me after I wrote on the feedback card they provided. I'm surprised the management was ok with that behavior because they were there too.",2.0

"My search for a new wedding venue after my original one fell through led me to aurora. The gorgeous Italian garden feel of this restaurant pulled me in and the delicious meal my fiancé and I shared kept us there. Sadly, we didn't choose this place for our venue because it didn't meet our needs but this stunning garden that can be used in all seasons is perfect for large parties (up to 50 ppl) and has a great menu to boot. We started with piazetta on the menu. It was a medley of wild foraged mushrooms, grilled radicchio, goat cheese, a touch of truffle oil and paper thin sheets of prosciutto on a buttery focaccia. Absolutely delicious. My fiancé LOVES pizza and he really loved this despite ""all the vegetables"" (his words, not mine). For our entrees, I had the halibut filet over a sweet corn puree and a sautéed kale. My fiancé had the roasted chicken with sautéed chickory and roasted sunchokes. Both were well executed and very tasty. As full as we were, I decided we HAD to have dessert. I decided to try the salted caramel budino. Hands down one of my newest favorite desserts! A velvety smooth salted caramel pudding atop a rich chocolaty cookie and garnished with chocolate cookie crumbles; complete with a healthy dollop of crème fraiche. At first bite, it was just okay but as I continued to dig in with rich, almost coffee flavored chocolate cookie with the buttery caramel pudding and tart crème fraiche, I became addicted.A little off the beaten path but well worth the travel.",5.0

"This is one of the best restaurants in the United States.  Of course, this authoritative statement comes from someone who has dined out at least 10 times in the past 6 months.  In various places.  Well, okay, it's one of the best restaurants I've ever eaten at, I can say that without a problem.In a nondescript building on a quiet street in Williamsburg, this place has it all; taste, atmosphere, quality, friendliness, the stark charm of a dilapitated past, gastronomic industry and creativity, thoughtful touches of romance and vibe, groovy clientele, and above all, a menu full of mouth-watering entrees.  Even the wine list was pretty sophisticated.  I live in Los Angeles, and even though there are 800 places here and another 1500 in NYC that I could try first, I would definitely want to go back there for a meal.  It was late October, so the details are getting hazy, but I have photographic evidence which I will share soon.  Just wanted to give Aurora some Yelpy love today.",5.0
"Came on a saturday, early afternoon for brunch. First of all, I almost don't want to review this place because I don't want people to know about this hidden brunch gem. They don't need all the bottomless brunch gimmicks to keep me coming back! Totally worth the trip to BK (and for me thats saying a lot). The outdoor dining room is a beautiful green house (heated in the winter) and the inside is cozy and dark with wood tables. I had L'Englese which was simple and delicious. Amazing thick cut bacon. Delicious local sausage. 2 of the most gorgeous eggs I've ever seen. Perfectly grilled mushrooms and tomatoes. $16 but you also get coffee and fresh squeeze orange or grapefruit juice. A friend of mine had the Eggs Benedict with ham and truffles...O.M.G. I only had a bite but it was heavenly. The waiter was sweet and attentive and the atmosphere was perfect.

"This is one of the best restaurants in the United States.  Of course, this authoritative statement comes from someone who has dined out at least 10 times in the past 6 months.  In various places.  Well, okay, it's one of the best restaurants I've ever eaten at, I can say that without a problem.In a nondescript building on a quiet street in Williamsburg, this place has it all; taste, atmosphere, quality, friendliness, the stark charm of a dilapitated past, gastronomic industry and creativity, thoughtful touches of romance and vibe, groovy clientele, and above all, a menu full of mouth-watering entrees.  Even the wine list was pretty sophisticated.  I live in Los Angeles, and even though there are 800 places here and another 1500 in NYC that I could try first, I would definitely want to go back there for a meal.  It was late October, so the details are getting hazy, but I have photographic evidence which I will share soon.  Just wanted to give Aurora some Yelpy love today.",5.0
"Came on a saturday, early afternoon for brunch. First of all, I almost don't want to review this place because I don't want people to know about this hidden brunch gem. They don't need all the bottomless brunch gimmicks to keep me coming back! Totally worth the trip to BK (and for me thats saying a lot). The outdoor dining room is a beautiful green house (heated in the winter) and the inside is cozy and dark with wood tables. I had L'Englese which was simple and delicious. Amazing thick cut bacon. Delicious local sausage. 2 of the most gorgeous eggs I've ever seen. Perfectly grilled mushrooms and tomatoes. $16 but you also get coffee and fresh squeeze orange or grapefruit juice. A friend of mine had the Eggs Benedict with ham and truffles...O.M.G. I only had a bite but it was heavenly. The waiter was sweet and attentive and the atmosphere was perfect. No wait, no loud crowds, just a perfect Saturday brunch.",5.0
"Great for brunch.Really nice atmosphere, and a very inexpensive and a totally worthwhile brunch! Totally worth the value. That french toast was absolutely incredible. Will definitely be back!!!! The food was really good, and it was just a pleasant eating experience! I loved the outside patio, the complementary coffee and juice were great. It was such a nice place for families and groups (I didn't come as a part of the group though).  Service was decent!",4.0
"One of the best meals I've had in a very long time. The food was excellent. The menu wasn't boring but wasn't overly unusual, either. Every dish ordered was great. For apps, we had a few specials - a gazpacho and a fig/prosciutto/ricotta dish - as well as a radicchio salad with grilled mushrooms. All were perfect. For main course, I had a branzino that was well prepared and served with delicious heirloom tomatoes and other greens. We also had an order of chicory - which was quite good, too. The setting was great - we were seated in the garden area - and the service was professional / pleasant. I will definitely be back for dinner again soon.",5.0

"After many years of beautiful meals at Aurora, my partner and I rented the restaurant for our 70-person wedding this last July. Our wedding was a total dream and we have nothing but glowing praise for this wonderful gem of a restaurant and it's amazingly generous and accommodating staff! After a gorgeous ceremony in the (very photogenic) garden, we had an elegant and beyond delicious feast accompanied by excellent wine and customized cocktails. Many of our guests said it was the best food they have ever had at a wedding and we couldn't agree more -- from the burrata to the grilled lamb to the panna cotta it was all food perfection. The evening ended with a very fun little dance party inside the restaurant. We wish we could have a party there every year! The staff at Aurora is chill, graceful and professional and they went above and beyond to make sure our wedding totally wonderful. As a venue, Aurora is an incredible value (especially given the insane costs charged by other venues in Brooklyn). We really got the most for our limited budget. Simply,  Aurora is fantastic for dinner and even more wonderful for celebrations! If you are planning an ""intimate-ish"" wedding in Williamsburg look no further!",5.0

"For lunch, we decided to sit inside because we didn't feel like opening up our pores before going back to work. Appetizers came out in under 5 minutes, three of us shared the Tuna Tar Tar which was soft and fresh, not overwhelmingly fishy - sauce was interesting. We waited a FULL hour for our entrees. The Beets and watermelon salad was refreshing. Whole wheat pasta w.shrimp - pretty good. Grilled Octopus was grilled to perfection, my chewing teeth decided that the ratio of soft to hard tentacles was precise. We were especially aggravated because when they served us the dishes an hour late, I asked how long would it take to make a dish like this, the manager said 5-6 minutes. Excuse me? We are blue collar workers, limited to one hour lunch breaks. How rude and inconsiderate. So we decided to order a dish to go for a coworker. It literally came out in 5 minutes. I let this slide since it was a Monday. Sometimes, Mondays too, need to be forgiven. Go there, enjoy.",3.0
Came for brunch on a mission to gather information - possibly use as my wedding venue.We told the first waiter who approached us that we were interested in possibly booking our wedding here. He talked about how they rented it out and said he would send the manager over to talk to us. Cute space. The menu looked yummy. So far so good.Five minutes later some guy comes over and just hands me a piece of paper with an email address and walks away. No introduction no information - kind of rude in my opinion and not how you solicit  business.Waitress was more less prompt in taking our order - runners brought juice and coffee right after. But then we waited almost 30 minutes for French toast and scrambled eggs. The restaurant wasn't even full.The food was good but left me a little underwhelmed.And then we had to wait another 10 minutes just to get our check.,3.0

"Definitely the best Italian in the area and some of the best we've had in NYC. The authentic food is consistently amazing and the impressive wine list leaves many options for perfect pairing. The brunch is particularly good for the very reasonable price. Several egg dishes come with the more subtle black truffle for a dynamite combination. The coffee is excellent. We've been back for dinner a few times recently and everything was equally as good. All enjoyed in their beautiful garden, summer and winter. The staff are always pleasant and knowledgeable.

"The absolute BEST place for outdoor williamsburg brunch !!!You are neither crammed into a tiny 3 square foot plot of bedford ave sidewalk, nor are you forced to wait 1.5 hours for a table, but rather, put in a spacious indoor garden with light streaming in from all angles and fresh air flowing in from the open doors. There is a smaller outdoor patio as well with small canopied tables if you are lucky enough to snag one. In addition to a happily sunlit setting, you get a wide array of menu items to choose from, all of which looked so good that my indecision left me debating between 5 different entrees. I finally decided on the fish special - a fluke dish with beets, orange, and pesto, which was SO GOOD. The fish was well-seasoned and paired very nicely with the beets and orange. We tried the eggs benedict, which was pretty good despite the fact that they for some reason subbed the prosciutto with regular ham...sad, but the delicious and fluffy focaccia made up for it a bit. I ordered a orange thyme blossom cocktail made with gin, which I would recommend. Tried the bloody mary which was good, but nothing to write home about. The only negative is that it's a wee bit of a trek from the Bedford stop, but it is completely worth it on a fine spring/summer day.",4.0

"I went to Aurora this past Friday night, and there were some hiccups (plus it's CASH ONLY??), but the food and ambiance pushed it into 4 star territory.I arrived about 15 minutes early for the reservation, so I decided to have a drink at the bar. There were a total of 6 people at the bar, and one bartender, and he seriously ignored me for 10 minutes. He was well-mannered, but it's not acceptable to let 10 minutes go by before giving a patron a drink menu. They had specialty cocktails, but I chose a glass of the Suave white wine. Their drink menu is small and only Italian, with 4 whites, 4 reds, 1 prosecco, and 1 rosé. The hostess was very sweet, and allowed us to sit 3 people out of our party when 2 were running late.The ambiance is really fantastic here. It's cozy and elegant, with exposed brick, interior arched windows, greenery, and twinkling lights. There is the main room, and also a greenhouse room on the side. Finally, there is outdoor seating for nice weather.On to the food! We started with some olives, which were dusted with herbs. For an appetizer, I had the Pizzetta, which was a flatbread with fontina, potatoes, and speck. This. Was. Amazing. The flavors were so delicious and the flatbread was thin and crispy. For my main course, I had the agnolotti, which was filled with cheese and porcini mushrooms. It was served in a lemon butter sauce with sliced asparagus. Again, this was absolutely delicious. The addition of lemon really brightened up the dish and made it interesting. So I really loved my dining experience here and hopefully I'll come back here or to their SoHo location soon.",4.0

"Pros: Cute Spot. The decor is nice and love the garden. Had the brunch pre-fixe with the juice and coffee. Very good deal for $15-$18. Nice food. Nice service. EXCELLENT bread. Usually I don't care about the free bread, but this is actually some damn good bread. Cons: A little out of the way on Grand St., which is fine cause less people as Williamsburg is super crowded nowadays.  Portions are a little on the small side, especially the L'inglese which has every side option available but only in small portions (like one strip of bacon). For the price, I thought it would be more, if only in potatoes. I was still a little hungry and had to venture into Brooklyn Flea for more food. Overall: Its a good choice for brunch when in the area, can't complain much other than the portions.",4.0
"This is the best restaurant that I've been to in Williamsburg.  They clearly take great care in sourcing fresh ingredients.  Everything we had (pasta, octopus, stuffed zucchini flowers, mushroom salad, etc) was fantastic but the desserts were exceptional.  Some of the best desserts we've ever had anywhere.The woman who took our order and helped us out with the wine was fantastic too.  She helped us pick a delicious white wine AND it was one of the cheaper ones on the menu.  Pretty rare that service actually steers you towards a better yet cheaper bottle but thats what she did. They have beautiful outdoor seating but it was a bit too hot so we ate in the simple and rustic interior.  Think exposed brick and dark wood.We'll definitely be back - a lot.",5.0
"We had our wedding reception here in June on a Saturday noon to 4. We had a party  of 45 with the space to ourselves.I cannot compliment the staff enough. As a restaurant they have been around long enough to support a private event, like our reception masterfully. We were pretty no frills, but they were great accommodating our set up and decor prior to our big day just as we wanted. We used Sprout floral as our florist, just a few doors down, and drew a map of the set up for tables, favors, ect.They offered a wine tasting for selection prior to our party, man that was fun and tasty,  they really know their vino.We did hors d'oeuvres  + a family style menu + dessert (also our own cake) + open bar + some preselected table wines. The food was amazing and fresh and plentiful. We had a great/reasonable price and even had to push the drinks to fulfill our minimum. Needless to say, no one left early and all of our guests were really impressed with the staff, food, and the great day.This spot is the real deal when it comes to food, and hospitality, and the space is really nice urban, and rustic, with and a huge outdoor dining space.",5.0
"I wouldn't call this place 'Italian' but it is pretty damn near perfect. Have been here for brunch many times and have never been dissapointed. There is always something on the brunch menu that is unique and delicious. Which is great if you are sick of the same old Eggs Benedict for the 1000th time. Dinner has always been solid and they really do the bruschetta right. And wow, wild boar for under $30. Awesome.Last time I was here one of the girls I was with passed out and had to be taken away in an ambulance (not the foods fault but her lifestyle choices) and the waitstaff was nice enough to pack our brunches and not charge for any drinks.",5.0
"What started out as one of the best Italian restaurants in Brooklyn has now gotten too comfortable with their success and slipped significantly in both food and service.On my most recent visit, the starters were good, especially the octopus.  The ambience was fine as well.  We tried two pastas and both were saturated with oil and butter.  It was really an unpleasant dining experience and we were only able to eat about half of each pasta dish. At around $20 a plate, this is unacceptable.The service was bad, only because they are understaffed.  The server was perfectly nice and attentive when present, but she was very rarely present.  To begin with, they have a policy that they will only take your entire order at once, meaning that you can't order your starters and then decide on main dishes.  Once she finally took our orders, she circled around our area and took orders from 4 other tables (which took about 20 minutes) before she made it back inside to put the orders in.  I'll skip the details about food coming out, etc.  It turned into one of those dining experiences where you feel like you are stuck there and can't leave because you can't get the check, and once you get the check, prepare to wait another 15 minute before someone takes your card and then... you get the point.This is the classic downfall of great restaurants.  They think they have a great product, they are packed every night, so they start cutting corners to increase their profit.  Then they become a mediocre restaurant full of people who have heard about them in some tourist guide to Brooklyn which was written five years ago.",2.0
"One of my favorite restaurants in the neighborhood. Both brunch and dinner get five stars. The food is delicious. Service is always prompt and friendly, and the ambiance is great. I love the cozy inside and outdoor garden. It also never seems to get extremely crowded and it's actually a pretty good sized restaurant which I like. I hate sitting on top of people next to me.

We used Sprout floral as our florist, just a few doors down, and drew a map of the set up for tables, favors, ect.They offered a wine tasting for selection prior to our party, man that was fun and tasty,  they really know their vino.We did hors d'oeuvres  + a family style menu + dessert (also our own cake) + open bar + some preselected table wines. The food was amazing and fresh and plentiful. We had a great/reasonable price and even had to push the drinks to fulfill our minimum. Needless to say, no one left early and all of our guests were really impressed with the staff, food, and the great day.This spot is the real deal when it comes to food, and hospitality, and the space is really nice urban, and rustic, with and a huge outdoor dining space.",5.0
"I wouldn't call this place 'Italian' but it is pretty damn near perfect. Have been here for brunch many times and have never been dissapointed. There is always something on the brunch menu that is unique and delicious. Which is great if you are sick of the same old Eggs Benedict for the 1000th time. Dinner has always been solid and they really do the bruschetta right. And wow, wild boar for under $30. Awesome.Last time I was here one of the girls I was with passed out and had to be taken away in an ambulance (not the foods fault but her lifestyle choices) and the waitstaff was nice enough to pack our brunches and not charge for any drinks.",5.0
"What started out as one of the best Italian restaurants in Brooklyn has now gotten too comfortable with their success and slipped significantly in both food and service.On my most recent visit, the starters were good, especially the octopus.  The ambience was fine as well.  We tried two pastas and both were saturated with oil and butter.  It was really an unpleasant dining experience and we were only able to eat about half of each pasta dish. At around $20 a plate, this is unacceptable.The service was bad, only because they are understaffed.  The server was perfectly nice and attentive when present, but she was very rarely present.  To begin with, they have a policy that they will only take your entire order at once, meaning that you can't order your starters and then decide on main dishes.  Once she finally took our orders, she circled around our area and took orders from 4 other tables (which took about 20 minutes) before she made it back inside to put the orders in.  I'll skip the details about food coming out, etc.  It turned into one of those dining experiences where you feel like you are stuck there and can't leave because you can't get the check, and once you get the check, prepare to wait another 15 minute before someone takes your card and then... you get the point.This is the classic downfall of great restaurants.  They think they have a great product, they are packed every night, so they start cutting corners to increase their profit.  Then they become a mediocre restaurant full of people who have heard about them in some tourist guide to Brooklyn which was written five years ago.",2.0
"One of my favorite restaurants in the neighborhood. Both brunch and dinner get five stars. The food is delicious. Service is always prompt and friendly, and the ambiance is great. I love the cozy inside and outdoor garden. It also never seems to get extremely crowded and it's actually a pretty good sized restaurant which I like. I hate sitting on top of people next to me. I hope they continue to impress me with their service and food because that's the key to having loyal customers.",5.0

"Aurora could be so much better than it is. The location is great and the restaurant as a whole is charming. The glassed-in room is a godsend in the the winter. Unfortunately, beyond the space the restaurant has serious problems. First the food, the food is on the whole, tasty and hearty Italian fare. The problem is the food is over loaded with salt.... insane amounts of salt... I had a salad here once and the dominant taste was salt.  It is so bad that if you eat here, prepare to be bloated for the next 24 hours. The second problem is the service. It isn't that the staff is rude, in fact the servers are generally nice. Rather, the service is best described as stilted, in that the servers always seem uncomfortable and unsure of what they are doing.

"Aurora was wonderful.  The experience was great start to finish.  I went for a friend's birthday in a large party (I think 14 people) which is normally my nightmare.  But somehow it ended up working out great at Aurora.  We sat in the back outdoor area but it had been raining so there was plastic up.  The way they had the lights set up it wasn't tacky at all.  It was actually really cute and romantic.  I think it would be a great place to have a date.Since there were so many of us we ordered a lot of food To start -Cheese plate - the amount of each type of cheese was a bit lacking (we did 3 kinds at $13/plate) , but the cheese themselves were delicious and it is served with honey, almonds and fig marmeladeBruschetta ($12)-  so good.  the topping wasn't your typical chopped tomato mixture, but rather marinated buffalo mozzarella.  It was seriously great.Croquettes ($6) - very yummy filled with blue cheese and I think cauliflower (but it escapes me) Calamari ($13) - really good.  It was unique because it was prepared seared vs friend, which is my preference in general.  The capers on the plate were really big and delicious.Beet salad - I just had one beet, but it was perfect.Main dishes-I ordered a special risotto with lobster, scallop and pea greens.  The scallop was literally the best I've ever had in my life.  I don't even know what it was that made it so amazing, but it was fantastic.I also tried a bite of the chick pea and ricotta gnocchi (my 2nd choice of dishes) and it was really great also.  Definitely go here.",4.0

"Patio dining, perfectly prepared Risotto and Panna Cotta that will bring me back this week! What's not to love! Oh, and now accepts credit cards...heaven.",5.0
"I've been here now at least a 1/2 dozen times and every meal has been highly anticipated and enjoyed. Last night was my favorite combination of food, wine, and service at Aurora yet. I've had the same waiter, Zach (hope I'm spelling that right) for the last 3 visits and he's my perfect waiter, extremely informal but absolutely attentive and thoroughly knowledgeable about both the food AND wine. Apparently he's relatively new to the restaurant which makes this all the more amazing. I've started going through the 1/2 bottles of wine they stock (sadly only 4) and the Barbaresco we had the previous visit and the Amarone we had last night were both sublime, especially the Amarone which was so open and approachable despite its intense flavors (2003, Zach and Damien explained, the best vintage for Amarone in the last 15 years because it was so hot in Italy).We paired the Amarone with their wild boar and veal steaks (barely cooked au jus with prosciutto on top and served with mashed potatoes and (awesomely) fiddleheads. We started with the fascinating carrots, almost Asian-fusion with (I believe) wasabi, ginger dressing, almonds, brussel sprout leaves, goat cheese, and herbs which challenge my notion that this is standard Italian. And before that the soup (minestrone, again meeting the high expectation built up over previous soups like the fantastic cold corn ""chowder"" with goat cheese and pea leaves which we loved last time). The food was uniformly satisfying and excellent.Another thing I didn't really mention in my original review was the desserts. The desserts are amazing! Every single dessert I've tried, and I think I'm up to 4 now, has been one of, if not the best dish of the evening. And that's saying a lot considering how full I am by that point in the meal. And then there's the dessert wines. I ask for a recommendation and Damien or Zach brings something out and I love it every time. Last night we had red dessert wine that Zach described as a ""not really"" Passimento from the heel of the boot made of Primitivo grapes (if I remember correctly, ""not really"" because the grapes were allowed to dry on the vine rather than being picked and then dried). And the wine was so dope! Somehow it was neither too sweet nor too alcoholic and was absolutely delicious. And it paired wonderfully with the lemon tart with strawberries and whipped cream that was possibly the 2nd best thing I've eaten this year (after the kasane black ramen with an egg and 1/2 the spicy ball added at Ippudo- I've thought about that ramen every single day since). I really can't put into words how good this dessert and wine were. Seriously. I just zone out every time I start thinking about it. It was completely blissful and that was at the end of nearly 3 hour meal where we stuffing bread and olives into our mouths between every course and basically licking every plate clean.The last thing I want to mention is the outdoor room. It's essentially a greenhouse that is entirely transparent and since we went early yesterday at 6 instead of our normal 7:45 and because it's staying light out longer with Spring and all, we really got a chance to enjoy the space. The room is surrounded by a wall of ivy and small trees on either side with small actual outdoor patios on either end. It looks like they basically kept all of the plants that were outside alive when they built the room so between the main restaurant and this room there is an exterior brick wall complete with open window with various rose bushes and other shrubbery and plants growing towards the ceiling. And they are already starting to respond to the extra and more intense light so by Summer they'll have to prune stuff back and the room with be thick with leaves (I can't wait)!Again, nothing is perfect. A few new (and some old) small complaints. On a previous visit, we had a waitress for a few minutes (luckily they had to move our table and we got a different waitress for the rest of our meal) that actually rolled her eyes at us when we asked her to bring the dishes out individually and if she wouldn't mind asking Damien to come over to make a wine recommendation. Now maybe I was just overly sensitive (hungry) at that moment but I just got a different vibe from her than from the rest of the staff- the unpleasant hipster restaurant vibe that says, ""I'm doing you a favor bub."" I haven't seen her since so maybe she's gone? Also, there have been a few more misses for me with the food here and there. We got a seafood risotto on a previous visit that I thought was both under-cooked and under-sauced. My wife loved it so that may be personal preference. But both of us have fallen out of love with the beet salad (and I looove beets). It's just too difficult to construct the proper bite with bits of cheese, citrus, herbs, and beet to get the proper balance. The beet chunks are maybe too large. And the citrus pieces often have fiber-y sections. And those rocky tables and uncomfy chairs!",5.0

We talked to two men who had also been waiting and they recommended we try Aurora. We walked there and were told that we could wait an hour for a table for two or eat in the outdoor garden. Although it was chilly, we opted to sit. We were the only two customers sitting outside when Rebekah, our server and guardian angel, appeared! Realizing it was pretty cold to eat outside, she had the restaurant move our table to an open area inside the restaurant. We could not have asked for better service or a nicer server. The restaurant itself is nicely decorated and romantic.  The food, however, while well made, did not blow us away. I had the chicken and my  girlfriend had the pasta with eggplant which she found a bit too spicy. Because it was still Passover, I could not try the pasta and bread but my friend gave high marks to both. So thank you Aurora for being there when we needed you!* Do be advised that this restaurant does not accept credit cards",4.0

Thanks again for the greatest Williamsburg brunch experience.",5.0
"Aurora was wonderful.  The experience was great start to finish.  I went for a friend's birthday in a large party (I think 14 people) which is normally my nightmare.  But somehow it ended up working out great at Aurora.  We sat in the back outdoor area but it had been raining so there was plastic up.  The way they had the lights set up it wasn't tacky at all.  It was actually really cute and romantic.  I think it would be a great place to have a date.Since there were so many of us we ordered a lot of food To start -Cheese plate - the amount of each type of cheese was a bit lacking (we did 3 kinds at $13/plate) , but the cheese themselves were delicious and it is served with honey, almonds and fig marmeladeBruschetta ($12)-  so good.  the topping wasn't your typical chopped tomato mixture, but rather marinated buffalo mozzarella.  It was seriously great.Croquettes ($6) - very yummy filled with blue cheese and I think cauliflower (but it escapes me) Calamari ($13) - really good.  It was unique because it was prepared seared vs friend, which is my preference in general.  The capers on the plate were really big and delicious.Beet salad - I just had one beet, but it was perfect.Main dishes-I ordered a special risotto with lobster, scallop and pea greens.  The scallop was literally the best I've ever had in my life.  I don't even know what it was that made it so amazing, but it was fantastic.I also tried a bite of the chick pea and ricotta gnocchi (my 2nd choice of dishes) and it was really great also.  Definitely go here.",4.0
"Went for Brooklyn Restaurant Week and the food was amazing. Appetizer was a huge portion of sausage and the bore main entre was a bit small but absolutely delicious. And dessert was also splendid. My only comments, slightly more comfortable seating outside (cushions wouldn'd hurt) and if the customer asks for tap water, maybe include some ice as well (bottle of water was still cloudy from the tap when we got it...would some ice and a slice of fruit have killed you).Overall a great restaurant and one I would return to again.",4.0
"Patio dining, perfectly prepared Risotto and Panna Cotta that will bring me back this week! What's not to love! Oh, and now accepts credit cards...heaven.",5.0
"I've been here now at least a 1/2 dozen times and every meal has been highly anticipated and enjoyed. Last night was my favorite combination of food, wine, and service at Aurora yet. I've had the same waiter, Zach (hope I'm spelling that right) for the last 3 visits and he's my perfect waiter, extremely informal but absolutely attentive and thoroughly knowledgeable about both the food AND wine. Apparently he's relatively new to the restaurant which makes this all the more amazing. I've started going through the 1/2 bottles of wine they stock (sadly only 4) and the Barbaresco we had the previous visit and the Amarone we had last night were both sublime, especially the Amarone which was so open and approachable despite its intense flavors (2003, Zach and Damien explained, the best vintage for Amarone in the last 15 years because it was so hot in Italy).We paired the Amarone with their wild boar and veal steaks (barely cooked au jus with prosciutto on top and served with mashed potatoes and (awesomely) fiddleheads. We started with the fascinating carrots, almost Asian-fusion with (I believe) wasabi, ginger dressing, almonds, brussel sprout leaves, goat cheese, and herbs which challenge my notion that this is standard Italian. And before that the soup (minestrone, again meeting the high expectation built up over previous soups like the fantastic cold corn ""chowder"" with goat cheese and pea leaves which we loved last time). The food was uniformly satisfying and excellent.Another thing I didn't really mention in my original review was the desserts. The desserts are amazing! Every single dessert I've tried, and I think I'm up to 4 now, has been one of, if not the best dish of the evening. And that's saying a lot considering how full I am by that point in the meal. And then there's the dessert wines. I ask for a recommendation and Damien or Zach brings something out and I love it every time. Last night we had red dessert wine that Zach described as a ""not really"" Passimento from the heel of the boot made of Primitivo grapes (if I remember correctly, ""not really"" because the grapes were allowed to dry on the vine rather than being picked and then dried). And the wine was so dope! Somehow it was neither too sweet nor too alcoholic and was absolutely delicious. And it paired wonderfully with the lemon tart with strawberries and whipped cream that was possibly the 2nd best thing I've eaten this year (after the kasane black ramen with an egg and 1/2 the spicy ball added at Ippudo- I've thought about that ramen every single day since). I really can't put into words how good this dessert and wine were. Seriously. I just zone out every time I start thinking about it. It was completely blissful and that was at the end of nearly 3 hour meal where we stuffing bread and olives into our mouths between every course and basically licking every plate clean.The last thing I want to mention is the outdoor room. It's essentially a greenhouse that is entirely transparent and since we went early yesterday at 6 instead of our normal 7:45 and because it's staying light out longer with Spring and all, we really got a chance to enjoy the space. The room is surrounded by a wall of ivy and small trees on either side with small actual outdoor patios on either end. It looks like they basically kept all of the plants that were outside alive when they built the room so between the main restaurant and this room there is an exterior brick wall complete with open window with various rose bushes and other shrubbery and plants growing towards the ceiling. And they are already starting to respond to the extra and more intense light so by Summer they'll have to prune stuff back and the room with be thick with leaves (I can't wait)!Again, nothing is perfect. A few new (and some old) small complaints. On a previous visit, we had a waitress for a few minutes (luckily they had to move our table and we got a different waitress for the rest of our meal) that actually rolled her eyes at us when we asked her to bring the dishes out individually and if she wouldn't mind asking Damien to come over to make a wine recommendation. Now maybe I was just overly sensitive (hungry) at that moment but I just got a different vibe from her than from the rest of the staff- the unpleasant hipster restaurant vibe that says, ""I'm doing you a favor bub."" I haven't seen her since so maybe she's gone? Also, there have been a few more misses for me with the food here and there. We got a seafood risotto on a previous visit that I thought was both under-cooked and under-sauced. My wife loved it so that may be personal preference. But both of us have fallen out of love with the beet salad (and I looove beets). It's just too difficult to construct the proper bite with bits of cheese, citrus, herbs, and beet to get the proper balance. The beet chunks are maybe too large. And the citrus pieces often have fiber-y sections. And those rocky tables and uncomfy chairs!",5.0

"I did not enjoy my experience to this place at all.  Decided to check it out for a friends birthday.  Can you get less bang for your buck than at this place?  Talk about overpriced.  You will pay $30 for about 4 square inches of food.  Also add on top of that, the food isn't all that good.  The best part of the meal was the onion bread they served before dinner.  We got there and tried to order two different appetizers (the flatbread and some cheese dish) and they were out of both of them.  It was a Saturday night at 7 p.m.  How could you be out of them?  I tried a bunch of different dishes the pork sausage ($12 for 2 inches of food), the ravioli which was not cooked to be tender, and the pasta with bolognese sauce which was also not tender.  I don't think I will be going back here.",2.0
"How does this place only have three and a half stars? I just got back and loved it!I had a Blackboard Eats coupon which I thankfully got to use two days before it expired, because I probably never would have thought to come here without it.

Awesome.The inside was really nice and cozy, but we sat out on the enclosed patio which was pleasantly warm even though it's, like, 15 degrees outside. It's probably really nice in the spring and summer when it opens to the outside.The service was great, with bus boys bringing us bread and refilling our water, and the waitress didn't rush us with our order at all.

I got the lemon fettucini plate with almonds which was really, really good for $14, and the mini carafes of house wine which fill two glasses were only $8.

"I really like Aurora; the food is amazing, the menu is creative, the service is friendly, and the atmosphere--especially outside--is beautiful. It's located right on Grand Street, towards the water, which is a beautiful area to eat and to wander around. I would love to live down there. The food is a little pricey, however, but they do have really rich and decadent dishes. I suppose for a special occasion, especially during the day, it would certainly be worth it. However, I just can't justify spending a lot of money on an Italian dinner. Italian food is peasant food, it's supposed to be hearty and cheap! That being said, a usual dinner may set you back $35-$55 per person. It's a lot, but once in a while I guess it's okay. The wine selection is amazing and the food really is delicious. The yummy marinated olives in cumin and bay leaf are a sure choice, but there are also a bunch of yummy appetizers (antipasti) as well: The polipo alla griglia (grilled octopus) is served with potatoes, roasted onions and Calabrian chili. The tartare de agnello is tamb tenderloin with quail egg, mint jam, and pecorino. Their pastas and secondi include a yummy venison and pomegranite fazzoletti, a traditional tagliatelle with Bolognese, and a orecchiette gamberi e cavolfiori (fresh pasta with cauliflower, wild shrimp, breadcrumbs and hot pepper). The secondi are everything from scallops with mushrooms, strip steak with balsamic and onions, and also a pesce del giorno. All of this typing in Italian is making my spell-check go crazy! Anyway, I suppose a trip over to Max would be much much cheaper and equally as awesome, but Aurora does have it's niche for certain, and so given the right situation I would in fact recommend it.

"Living in New York City, there's a lot of Italian, just lots of it, big portions, big flavor, large menus, great wine selections, etc. Service is always iffy, but occasionally you get someone with the patience to explain what a burrata is, or who has the patience to show your dieting friend the calorie breakdown of a chicken parmesan (just don't order it if you're like that). But also, keep in mind, what is sometimes lacking is REAL italian. Like real pizza (regional specific), handmade pasta, sauces not from a can, hand crushed tomatoes, etc.... Aurora has a lot going for it, it has an excellent staff, patient, kind, fast, and knowledgable. They have a great menu with excellent selections and the willingness to adjust it for dietary reasons such as being vegan. And their atmosphere is great as well. While it's not all handmade as a foodie romanticizes Italian food should be, it is fresh, and flavorful, and seasoned well. I went with a party of 12, we started with bottles of 2 different red wines, which included a malbec of the servers choosing. I ordered the paccheri al norma with spinach, eggplant, buffalo mozzarella, and tomato sauce, it was great, full of good flavors, the eggplant was a perfect meaty texture and the spinach was cooked perfectly in with the pasta. Everyone dug in to their food and really loved it, I heard the truffled ravioli is phenomenal as is the lamb for you carnivores. For dessert I wanted to get espresso or some coffee drink but they actually don't have any, it threw me off since this is an italian restaurant but I wasn't going to make a big to do about it.

"I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a truly charming dining experience. I have been here multiple times.  The food and service has been fantastic every single time.  I was a little wary at first.  A menu filled with olives and capers and pine nuts isn't exactly appetizing to me.  And the wine list - psh- I recognized maybe one or two of them. (not that I'm particularly well versed in wine lists)Aurora blew all of my preconceived notions out of the water.  Don't like olives? Here you will.  Don't like capers? That's because you haven't eaten them here.   Not sure what wine to get?  The servers are so knowledgeable!Can't miss dishes?The first time I was here I had the suppli and it is by far my favorite menu item.   But the tomato and the onion foccacia come in a really close second. Also try the calamari if they have it on special!!! It's out of this world.  If they don't have the calamari try the octopus - seriously. do it!I like to sit out in the garden patio and I love the fact that the patronage is a very even mix of dates, a big group of friends, or families.  It makes for a really comfortable cozy homey vibe.  If you haven't ventured into Williamsburg to try Aurora, put it on your foodie bucket list and go!  You will not be disappointed.",4.0

There was only one bowl left of the soup we wanted, and none of the dessert we wanted. Considering these aren't specials and regular menu items, they should have been there.

"I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a truly charming dining experience. I have been here multiple times.  The food and service has been fantastic every single time.  I was a little wary at first.  A menu filled with olives and capers and pine nuts isn't exactly appetizing to me.  And the wine list - psh- I recognized maybe one or two of them. (not that I'm particularly well versed in wine lists)Aurora blew all of my preconceived notions out of the water.  Don't like olives? Here you will.  Don't like capers? That's because you haven't eaten them here.   Not sure what wine to get?  The servers are so knowledgeable!Can't miss dishes?The first time I was here I had the suppli and it is by far my favorite menu item.   But the tomato and the onion foccacia come in a really close second. Also try the calamari if they have it on special!!! It's out of this world.  If they don't have the calamari try the octopus - seriously. do it!I like to sit out in the garden patio and I love the fact that the patronage is a very even mix of dates, a big group of friends, or families.  It makes for a really comfortable cozy homey vibe.  If you haven't ventured into Williamsburg to try Aurora, put it on your foodie bucket list and go!  You will not be disappointed.",4.0

"A friend and I were exploring Brooklyn, Williamsburg section one Sunday afternoon. The previous evening we each did sone due diligence searching for the perfect Brunch place.Being relatively new to Brooklyn (way more familiar with all things  in da city) we found it easy to get to the area and to find a paring space, after all it was Sunday ala free parking.We had some trouble finding the restaurant as we were looking for #53 Grand, but that was a vacant building. We were starving so we gazed across the pretty desolate street (light industrial chic) to the only eatery, actually the only place open.We sucked it up, and said let's go in it can't be too bad, we would search for our original destination restaurant on another day, but for now we would eat.Once in we had to decide to sit inside or out, out was in an adjacent room with a ceiling open to the sky. The outside was beautiful, with what I think is wisteria growing along the walls and along the rafters above, just enough to make you feel, hummm, this is nice ;)My friend and I both felt the place oozed with that very Italian countryside ambiance. So we ordered food and cocktails. Well suffice it to say that the food was excellent and cocktails superb. The surroundings make you feel like you've  just traveled by air to dine in Italy.Wait staff and management are attentive, prices fare, food and drink superb.We liked the feel of the places much that once our brunch was done, we Ed to the bar, which has about 8 stools, with a friendly batpr tender for Prosecco w/Aperol and spritz, stayed for another 1 at least because this place just feels good, the place was full to capacity in both rooms, with people now eating their meal at the bar. Which in thought was interesting since the light industry street that this sole restaurant is on would not lead you to believe anything as good as This restaurant could be found there, but good it was and I will return.By the way, after attending the Willamsburg Flea, and strolling the shops and galleries of the area, we did find our original dining for bruncjph destination which was not 53 Grand but 533 Bar Barricu, which we stopped in to explore because they have what they call Late Brunch from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM, but that's bother story.Bon appetite!",4.0

"Went for a lovely evening's dinner with an out of town visitor.  Not needing an outside table we were graciously seated indoors.  The place was hopping.  After placing drink orders we waited around 20 minutes and finally asked if we might be served some bread as we perused the menu.  Selections were made from a very ambitious menu.  A shared order of pan fried seafood was delicious.  Salads likewise.  All pasta orders were off.  A special had vegetables, notably zucchini which was so bitter and off tasting that it had to be pushed to the side of plate.  The other dishes - so salty - and would've been sent back, had anyone bothered to ask how the food was.  We did not have dessert and departed.  Later that evening two out our party of three were sick all night.  Will not be returning no matter how charming the decor, garden and the staff.  The kitchen needs to tweak up it's efforts both in it's preparation and quality of the food - which was way overpriced for what was served.  Having gotten sick on cooked food I am happy that we didn't eat anything raw there.  Also noticed a staff member use an ice cream scoop that was in the wash up sick to scoop some ice cream onto a pie just before serving.

"Loved this place. Cute, cozy, rustic. We had reservations, seated immediately. Ordered drinks. Oddly, this little Italian place doesnt sell Sambuca.

Burratta was fresh and creamy. We also orderd Lobster Mushroom Salad. Yes, I thought the lobster was missing and nitifed my waiter to find out its the type of mushroom and I shall NOT be getting lobster. Deliscous tho, with Grilled Radicchio and Shaved PArmesan drizzled with Truffle oil. We ordered the Special of Pan-seared Halibut on top of some puree, dont know what, which was on top of SOinach, finished with Rosemary olive oil drizzle and roasted garlic. Su-fucking-perb!! I never order fish out, but I will again. Dessert was so-so, no biggy. But, I dont go out to dinner for dessert. Staff attentive and friendly. Will go again!",5.0

"The lady and I went here for dinner just last night, with high expectations and looking forward to sitting outside on their gorgeous, and romantic, garden patio. Even though I had mistakenly made reservations for the wrong night, the hostess was wonderful in accommodating us despite my ineptitude. We had a drink at the bar while we waited, and again the bartender was super friendly and helpful when we asked about the drink menu.We were seated only 10-15 minutes later, which was great considering we didn't really have a reservation anymore and the place was pretty busy.I'll start with the good and end with 'needs work'.The tuna tartar with tomato emulsion was amazing, and I will definitely try making this one at home. We had a mushroom pasta primeri (a bit salty and heavy on what tasted like truffle oil) that was good, and then had the scallops (again, over-salted) and lamb. The scallops were perfectly cooked, and tasted great despite being over-seasoned, and the lamb was fine although some of it was overcooked and too tough to eat. Overall, a very average dinner. The ricotta tart for dessert was really tasty though, I definitely recommend getting that.What really detracted from the evening was the terrible service. Our waitress spent under 2 minutes total at our table, didn't describe or care to elaborate on any specials (when I asked about daily specials, she said ""yeah, they're good""), didn't bring over any food, didn't stop by to ask how the food tasted, and when I asked if she could recommend a glass of red wine to go with the lamb she responded ""yeah"" and plunked down a glass of red a few minutes later- no explanation of what it was much less what kind of wine I prefer to drink. Upon reading other reviews, it seems like this is becoming more the norm with Aurora, which is a real shame because it's got such neighborhood potential to be a 'go-to' spot, and such charm- but I'll never return just based on there being so many other great places to go to where they have at least average service that doesn't make the table feel like an inconvenience.Bravo though for both the hostess and bartender, I would come back for a cocktail and dessert at the bar.",2.0
Such a cute little place. Reminds me of a restaurant Flour + Water in SF. I had the Tagliatelle al Limone & it was sooo tasty!! We also had an artichoek salad which was alright.

"I highly recommended this place but after yesterday's experience, I have my reservations. It was a New Year's Eve meal. They failed to mention, when I was making reservations, that they will ONLY be serving the $80 prix-fixe menu. Since it was NYE, we didn't mind a nice dinner. It quickly went downhill from there. The food options for the NYE's menu weren't spectacular. The risotto was watery, tangy and pretty bland. They completely messed up our order and brought the wrong dishes. So two of us had the correct entrees and the other two had to wait. We waited about 15 minutes for the correct dishes. On top of that, the timing between each meal was horrendous- we basically waited so long between each dish that we lost our appetite. The food was either salty or just uninspired! We forgot it was cash only and they mentioned it right at the end...who realistically carries over $100? It would have been decent of them to tell us beforehand. Terribly disappointed and will have to reconsider recommending this place to other people.I was mortified in front of my friends who had to endure that terrible meal and am glad to be able to leave the meal in the past. Looking on to a New Year!",1.0
"Let me preface this by saying that I had been a fan of this establishment for years.  My husband and I have been for our anniversaries- even our most recently this last September!Last night we went with our aunt and uncle visiting us from Buenos Aires and wanted to take them to a great meal.  We discussed a few places (Dressler, Dumont) but picked this place as my husband really likes it.It was an embarrassing (as hosts) and disappointing (as diners) night.It started off with the drinks.  I ordered a cucumber martini and it was a bitter green mess of pureed cucumber skin and vodka,  I didn't send it back or complain because I don't like to be a whiner and I didn't want to make our guests feel uncomfortable or have a negative impression.When our entrees arrived, I had ordered the special pasta with clams.  I took a bite and got a MOUTHFUL of grit and sand.  Again, I didn't want to make a scene, but there was no way I could eat it, so I did send it back.  I got mushroom pasta instead.  It was okay, in fact, all the other people I was with thought the food was ""okay,"" but it was not the usual amazing, delicious food I expect at Aurora!  No one had anything bad to say about their dishes, but they seemed bland and sort of uninspired.  For dessert, it was the same thing. Not bad, but not great.To top it off, the service was so inattentive that I went and brought our check to the waitress and we waited a bit too long for change to the point my uncle started to worry if they had forgotten.  This experience was so out the ordinary for Aurora that I have to imagine that something else was going on that night.Needless to say, don't take out of town guests you want to impress with gourmet fare, I guess this place has gone downhill.  We won't be going back- there are too many other great places in the area.",1.0

"I highly recommended this place but after yesterday's experience, I have my reservations. It was a New Year's Eve meal. They failed to mention, when I was making reservations, that they will ONLY be serving the $80 prix-fixe menu. Since it was NYE, we didn't mind a nice dinner. It quickly went downhill from there. The food options for the NYE's menu weren't spectacular. The risotto was watery, tangy and pretty bland. They completely messed up our order and brought the wrong dishes. So two of us had the correct entrees and the other two had to wait. We waited about 15 minutes for the correct dishes. On top of that, the timing between each meal was horrendous- we basically waited so long between each dish that we lost our appetite. The food was either salty or just uninspired! We forgot it was cash only and they mentioned it right at the end...who realistically carries over $100? It would have been decent of them to tell us beforehand. Terribly disappointed and will have to reconsider recommending this place to other people.I was mortified in front of my friends who had to endure that terrible meal and am glad to be able to leave the meal in the past. Looking on to a New Year!",1.0
"Let me preface this by saying that I had been a fan of this establishment for years.  My husband and I have been for our anniversaries- even our most recently this last September!Last night we went with our aunt and uncle visiting us from Buenos Aires and wanted to take them to a great meal.  We discussed a few places (Dressler, Dumont) but picked this place as my husband really likes it.It was an embarrassing (as hosts) and disappointing (as diners) night.It started off with the drinks.  I ordered a cucumber martini and it was a bitter green mess of pureed cucumber skin and vodka,  I didn't send it back or complain because I don't like to be a whiner and I didn't want to make our guests feel uncomfortable or have a negative impression.When our entrees arrived, I had ordered the special pasta with clams.  I took a bite and got a MOUTHFUL of grit and sand.  Again, I didn't want to make a scene, but there was no way I could eat it, so I did send it back.  I got mushroom pasta instead.  It was okay, in fact, all the other people I was with thought the food was ""okay,"" but it was not the usual amazing, delicious food I expect at Aurora!  No one had anything bad to say about their dishes, but they seemed bland and sort of uninspired.  For dessert, it was the same thing. Not bad, but not great.To top it off, the service was so inattentive that I went and brought our check to the waitress and we waited a bit too long for change to the point my uncle started to worry if they had forgotten.  This experience was so out the ordinary for Aurora that I have to imagine that something else was going on that night.Needless to say, don't take out of town guests you want to impress with gourmet fare, I guess this place has gone downhill.  We won't be going back- there are too many other great places in the area.",1.0

"Man, is this place ever dark. And expensive. I had a very sad meal here at the end of a withering relationship, but it wasn't the restaurant's fault (although it was so dark in the outdoor corner where we were seated that the waiter approached with arms outstretched the way you might when fumbling down the hall to the bathroom at night, and I had to strain to see my entree).Since that dark (har) night, I've been back a few times, usually in big groups, and I've been impressed with the food, atmosphere, and wine at Aurora.

It's in probably one of the best corners of Williamsburg, and with its lovely and vast outdoor seating, it uses the location to its advantage.

"We waited half an hour despite having a reservation. Thankfully it was a beautiful night. We sat ""outside"" in the dark with one measly candle for the table. Ambiance is one thing but we literally could not read our menus. For a party of 6, we ordered 3 appetizers, 3 pastas and 4 entrees to share. The combination of the dark and the high noise level apparently caused our waiter to hear us order 5 entrees instead. No worries - if the food had been good... The sausage appetizer came out raw and had to be sent back. No apologies from anyone. Even when properly cooked, it was lackluster. The flat bread was ok but meager. The pork belly was a minuscule portion. There was literally a 15-20 min wait BETWEEN each appetizer. The cheese pasta filling was great but the knotted ends were too tough. The bucatini was very basic. The linguine with clams were AWFUL- terribly salty and gritty. It literally tasted like it was dragged out of the beach and cooked ON the sand. When I commented to the waiter about how sandy and salty it was - to the point where it was inedible - he merely said - it's probably from the clams. Thanks Sherlock. For the five entrees, we ordered the pork chop (dry and bland), arctic char (messy and strong fish smell), short rib (very tender), hanger steak (ok) and chicken (tender but the side vegetables were near raw). Everything came out at a snails pace and half our party started falling asleep in the dark. With the amount of people staffed at this restaurant, you'd think they'd be attentive or even nice.

"This is a great restaurant. The shame is that it's in a random location. Two weeks ago I was here with a friend for an uncharacteristically nice Monday dinner, and we were both impressed. The ""sommalier"" Damien was very helpful when it came to choosing a bottle of wine and made food suggestions that would pair well. The $40 bottle of wine was a fantastic value as it was robust, complex and exactly what we wanted. The wine list was pretty large and fairly eclectic as far as Italian wines go, so we needed the help.As far as food goes, everything was delicious. Appetizers were sweetbreads and polenta, both prepared delicately and you could tell there was thought put into all the flavors and textures. I had a pork chop with kale and my friend had steak, which was seared perfectly (he asked for it to be cooked however the chef recommends, which turned out to be an excellent black & blue). In general the menu was really appealing -- we could have been satisfied ordering 2/3 of the appetizers and half the main dishes. We were convinced to buy dessert, which was good but a great dessert wine was served gratis also and that was a nice touch to end the night.The service was great overall. Considering that Aurora is pretty low key, we were impressed. We both decided we would come back at some point with some girls on a date. It's dimly lit, trendy but not too upscale and the space is very nice. There's also a large outdoor area. The music was a bit interesting, going back and forth between light, airy French-sounding music and some other stuff. But it worked and I would definitely come back here, right after I try the SoHo location.",5.0
"I chose Aurora for my birthday dinner (my second of three, in between Moto and Fette Sau; it was a good year). I'm not super critical when it comes to judging restaurants; I like good service, good food, good atmosphere, but will forgive a lot. After all, restaurants are only human. Aurora, however, needed no pardoning. Armed with a reservation for four, we walked into Aurora to find it completely, blessedly empty. The host greeted us warmly and made a good-natured joke about how glad he was we'd been sure to reserve a table. Our waitress was exceptional. The space itself is beautiful, cozy, and romantic (but not cloyingly so). Wine list is well-edited and decently priced. Overall, very well-executed, no glaring omissions or superfluities. But seriously, the food. I ordered a braised artichoke as an appetizer. Maybe I was distracted by my all-consuming love of artichokes and didn't think about what that meant, but when it was set in front of me, I was puzzled. It was a delicately roasted artichoke, languishing next to two pear halves in a wan-looking broth and garnished with mint. Skeptical, I dug in. I did not speak, hear, look up, or breathe until I'd scooped every last bit of that beguiling broth into my mouth. The dish is mystical. It actually crosses my mind sometimes, and I find myself getting all wistful and shit. It being my birthday and all, I decided to take advantage of my companions' generosity (thanks, ma) and order the black truffle pappardelle as my entree. Good god in heaven. Thick, perfectly textured ribbons, dressed in nothing but salt, butter, and a very generous helping of shaved black truffles. Good God Almighty in Heaven. I took so long to eat it that it got cold toward the end, and though it might've been an annoying request on my part, they graciously re-heated it for me (and added more truffles-- eff yeah!). This was easily the most indulgent, intensely satisfying food experience I've had in a while. Should I ever again find myself with 35 spare dollars (doubtful), I am showing up at their door, bills crumpled in hand, and begging them to feed me. Worth every penny.Dessert was pleasant but paled in comparison to the rest of the meal. In fact, almost everything I've eaten since then pales in comparison to that meal. Highly recommended.",5.0

I loved it, and then the food was phenominal, and totally reasonably priced. 100% worth going to Brooklyn for (we live in manhattan) as its better than all of the italian restaurants near me.",5.0

I had the pasta with the pork ragu which was very good but very spicy.My mom had the pasta with osso bucco which is more of a meat sauce than normal osso bucco. Service was very good & friendly.

"Have been wanting to come to Aurora for quite some time, and finally stopped by this morning (6/15) for brunch.  It was a beautiful day and while their patio was pretty packed, there were still open tables outside and many more inside.  We asked to sit on the patio and the hostess said it would be 5 minutes.  After a few minutes we said that we would just sit inside, near the open windows if possible.  The hostess looked at us blankly and in a dead monotone replied, ""well we don't have any menus for you, so there is no point in sitting inside if you can't have menus.""  We then asked if we could be seated, regardless, and she again blankly stared at us and coldly said, ""what is the point of sitting if you have no menus.""  My boyfriend asked her why, when there were about 15 tables open inside, the restaurant had already run out of menus.  She responded ""because the outside is crowded"" and subsequently turned her back.  I am not one to create scenes or walk out of restaurants, but that was enough for us to walk out.  Aurora seems like a good spot (great menu, nice bar area, nicely decorated outdoor seating area), but I have no interest in supporting such poor customer service (or really, people skills).",1.0
"Aurora kept me warm & cozy on a cold and rainy night....This review is only of the bar & restaurant feel in itself and not on the food for I only went here for after dinner drinks on a date.You walk in this lonely little restaurant on the corner of a dark Williamsburg block and BAM (as Emeril says)... the warmness hits you like a crackling fire place. My date (being the gentleman he was) removed my heavy winter jacket and we grabbed two stools at the small bar by the front windows and next to the Christmas tree. Exposed brick surrounds us, the bartender suggests a wine and we slowly sip and enjoy as we groove to the old school funk slow jams that are playing  in the dimmed lit restaurant.I highly suggest this for a date spot for after dinner drinks. We looked around and got a little wet in the mouth after catching a sniff and peak at peoples dinner arriving. It looked amazing and I plan on coming back here for dinner sometime soon.I also checked out their outdoor garden seating area, it was lit with candles and was open in the winter! I'm assuming they had some type of heating system going on in the outdoor tent.You want to impress or romance a lady in Williamsburg fellas? You want to take your date somewhere actually interesting and romantic other than that GOD AWFUL TECHNO MUSIC POUDING THAI RESTAURANT ""SEA""?!

"I have frequented Aurora for at least 5 years, and have never once been disappointed.  The menu is always well-balanced, (it changes every season), and the food is always thoughtfully prepared.  The wait staff is truly warm and knowledgeable (the presence of both is an extreme rarity in the 11211), and the atmosphere can stand up to any occasion, be it a romantic date or a causal drink, dinner with friends, or a really solid brunch on the weekends.  Great place for a wedding reception too.  Inside is rustic and cozy, outside is well-kept and spacious. It's really obvious that the staff is happy and well-managed, also a rarity in my neighborhood.  I think they do lots of wine tastings, ect, so they are all really knowledgeable about the food and the incredible wine list.  I have had some marathon meals there, and I have never felt rushed in any way.The menu does change, but they always seem to really nail the grilled octopus, peach salad, homemade tagliatelle, ravioli, and pork loin.  This place is bulletproof, every time.",5.0

"Addendum:  I went there for a Dine in Brooklyn lunch there, only to learn that they were only offering the $20.12 lunch on weekdays.  No problem -- I had the $15 brunch.  What can I say?*Great bread with delicious olive oil to dip into.*A bottomless cup of GREAT coffee -- not the current trend of ""it''s too bitter but I have to like it to show I'm cool,"" but genuinely delicious.*Delicious Bloody Mary, nice and peppery with a great garnish of pickled things.*The most amazing egg yolks I've ever tasted.  The only thing that comes close are the eggs I had in Chincoteague VA that were 6 hours old.*The egg preparation was also delicious -- perfectly cooked ""Benedict"" style eggs , GREAT hollandaise sauce, light but still with body and in no way reminiscent of runny eggs.  Nicely cooked spinach, and all on top of really tasty focaccia.WOW!  My entire family is going to go next week.Oh, and the owner (or someone with an Italian accent in the management) couldn't have been nicer about explaining their Dine in Broolkyn participation.Oh, oh -- and the waitress couldn't have been nicer or more agreeable.",5.0

But seriously, the food. I ordered a braised artichoke as an appetizer. Maybe I was distracted by my all-consuming love of artichokes and didn't think about what that meant, but when it was set in front of me, I was puzzled. It was a delicately roasted artichoke, languishing next to two pear halves in a wan-looking broth and garnished with mint. Skeptical, I dug in. I did not speak, hear, look up, or breathe until I'd scooped every last bit of that beguiling broth into my mouth. The dish is mystical. It actually crosses my mind sometimes, and I find myself getting all wistful and shit. It being my birthday and all, I decided to take advantage of my companions' generosity (thanks, ma) and order the black truffle pappardelle as my entree. Good god in heaven. Thick, perfectly textured ribbons, dressed in nothing but salt, butter, and a very generous helping of shaved black truffles. Good God Almighty in Heaven. I took so long to eat it that it got cold toward the end, and though it might've been an annoying request on my part, they graciously re-heated it for me (and added more truffles-- eff yeah!). This was easily the most indulgent, intensely satisfying food experience I've had in a while. Should I ever again find myself with 35 spare dollars (doubtful), I am showing up at their door, bills crumpled in hand, and begging them to feed me. Worth every penny.Dessert was pleasant but paled in comparison to the rest of the meal. In fact, almost everything I've eaten since then pales in comparison to that meal. Highly recommended.",5.0

"We stumbled upon Aurora on a Friday night, it was totally packed at 9:30, so we figured we would wait it out to see what it was. So happy we did. First of all the ambiance is so nice, its so pretty inside with a greenhouse garden type of thing going on. I loved it, and then the food was phenominal, and totally reasonably priced. 100% worth going to Brooklyn for (we live in manhattan) as its better than all of the italian restaurants near me.",5.0
"I'm Italian, a life-long Williamsburg resident and definitely not a hipster. My mom and I have eaten here twice and enjoyed it both times. The burrata & prosciutto app was fabulous if pricey. We ordered the white wine from Ischia since my dad's family hails from that gorgeous Italian island. It was decent. I had the pasta with the pork ragu which was very good but very spicy.My mom had the pasta with osso bucco which is more of a meat sauce than normal osso bucco. Service was very good & friendly. An excellent choice for modern quality Italian in the neighborhood alibet expensive.",4.0
"Have been wanting to come to Aurora for quite some time, and finally stopped by this morning (6/15) for brunch.  It was a beautiful day and while their patio was pretty packed, there were still open tables outside and many more inside.  We asked to sit on the patio and the hostess said it would be 5 minutes.  After a few minutes we said that we would just sit inside, near the open windows if possible.  The hostess looked at us blankly and in a dead monotone replied, ""well we don't have any menus for you, so there is no point in sitting inside if you can't have menus.""  We then asked if we could be seated, regardless, and she again blankly stared at us and coldly said, ""what is the point of sitting if you have no menus.""  My boyfriend asked her why, when there were about 15 tables open inside, the restaurant had already run out of menus.  She responded ""because the outside is crowded"" and subsequently turned her back.  I am not one to create scenes or walk out of restaurants, but that was enough for us to walk out.  Aurora seems like a good spot (great menu, nice bar area, nicely decorated outdoor seating area), but I have no interest in supporting such poor customer service (or really, people skills).",1.0
"Aurora kept me warm & cozy on a cold and rainy night....This review is only of the bar & restaurant feel in itself and not on the food for I only went here for after dinner drinks on a date.You walk in this lonely little restaurant on the corner of a dark Williamsburg block and BAM (as Emeril says)... the warmness hits you like a crackling fire place. My date (being the gentleman he was) removed my heavy winter jacket and we grabbed two stools at the small bar by the front windows and next to the Christmas tree. Exposed brick surrounds us, the bartender suggests a wine and we slowly sip and enjoy as we groove to the old school funk slow jams that are playing  in the dimmed lit restaurant.I highly suggest this for a date spot for after dinner drinks. We looked around and got a little wet in the mouth after catching a sniff and peak at peoples dinner arriving. It looked amazing and I plan on coming back here for dinner sometime soon.I also checked out their outdoor garden seating area, it was lit with candles and was open in the winter! I'm assuming they had some type of heating system going on in the outdoor tent.You want to impress or romance a lady in Williamsburg fellas? You want to take your date somewhere actually interesting and romantic other than that GOD AWFUL TECHNO MUSIC POUDING THAI RESTAURANT ""SEA""?! (So played now) I suggest you take my advice and bring her to Aurora. It might end up being a lonnng night. (lol)Btw, I did go home after. I am what you call "" a good girl"". ;o)",4.0
"I have frequented Aurora for at least 5 years, and have never once been disappointed.  The menu is always well-balanced, (it changes every season), and the food is always thoughtfully prepared.  The wait staff is truly warm and knowledgeable (the presence of both is an extreme rarity in the 11211), and the atmosphere can stand up to any occasion, be it a romantic date or a causal drink, dinner with friends, or a really solid brunch on the weekends.  Great place for a wedding reception too.  Inside is rustic and cozy, outside is well-kept and spacious. It's really obvious that the staff is happy and well-managed, also a rarity in my neighborhood.  I think they do lots of wine tastings, ect, so they are all really knowledgeable about the food and the incredible wine list.  I have had some marathon meals there, and I have never felt rushed in any way.The menu does change, but they always seem to really nail the grilled octopus, peach salad, homemade tagliatelle, ravioli, and pork loin.  This place is bulletproof, every time.",5.0
"Appetizers better than main courses. Excellent: Watermelon salad, fried squash blossoms. Good: Panacotta, banana parfait...even though they looked pretty alike.  Gnocchi in pesto. Not good: Pork tenderloin in pancetta was dry. Spinach was way too salty. Servers were nice but a little lethargic.",3.0
"Addendum:  I went there for a Dine in Brooklyn lunch there, only to learn that they were only offering the $20.12 lunch on weekdays.  No problem -- I had the $15 brunch.  What can I say?*Great bread with delicious olive oil to dip into.*A bottomless cup of GREAT coffee -- not the current trend of ""it''s too bitter but I have to like it to show I'm cool,"" but genuinely delicious.*Delicious Bloody Mary, nice and peppery with a great garnish of pickled things.*The most amazing egg yolks I've ever tasted.  The only thing that comes close are the eggs I had in Chincoteague VA that were 6 hours old.*The egg preparation was also delicious -- perfectly cooked ""Benedict"" style eggs , GREAT hollandaise sauce, light but still with body and in no way reminiscent of runny eggs.  Nicely cooked spinach, and all on top of really tasty focaccia.WOW!  My entire family is going to go next week.Oh, and the owner (or someone with an Italian accent in the management) couldn't have been nicer about explaining their Dine in Broolkyn participation.Oh, oh -- and the waitress couldn't have been nicer or more agreeable.",5.0

The 3rd diner had the special chestnut pasta with pork and veal.-very rustic and again very good. The chestut pasta had a real nice bite to it. I had the agnolotti ai piselli w mushrooms, & pea sprouts. This dish was fresh & spring-like. Perfect for an cool early summer evening.

Now all they can talk about this restaurant is that you did not clean the clam enough, and according to my mother, she could clean them better than you can. Yes, a bit ridiculous, but you were so close to perfection. I just thought I'd let you know. Everything else was delicious. The beef carpaccio, the rabbit ragu, all really exceptional.

"This might have been an off night - except that my boyfriend has eaten here 3 other times.  Each time, his opinion of Aurora has gone from good to terrible.I read good reviews for this restaurant so I thought I'd have a great experience.  From the moment we walked in with an early dinner reservation, we got a weird reception at the check-in.  We were met with a black hair Donatella Versace type.  Seriously, she was weird and seemed to act as though we didn't have reservations.  They found them and we were seat.They sat us in the garden area.  They had the heat on to keep it warm.  Seemed to make sense, except that the heat wasn't from heat lamps.  The air came in through air ducts at the top of the garden.  In other words, it blew directly into my face.  Ultimately, making my contacts stick to my eyes.Our waitress was a fairly absent and spacey girl.  She explained the specials, sort of.  My bf was about to order a drink but she disappeared.  Finally he ordered a drink and, again, we sat there.  The wait was just too long for a simple drink order.  I tried to ignore the heat but had to ask a bus boy to ask if it could be turned down.  What appeared to be a senior waiter/server, came over and nicely stated that there was nothing that can be done.  He kindly brought us into the main room.  I like this area much betterAmbiance is great in the main room.  Cozy with wood tables and brick wall.  Much more intimate.  More of an adult dinner group.  The new waitress saved the night.  She knew about the specials, explained them and helped suggest wine.Menu is fairly standard Italian fare.  I had the Halibut special and it was bad.  It did have crunchy skin on the outside but it slid off immediately.  The fish was way too ""fishy"" (I don't know how else to describe it).  Too salty, tomatoes were tasteless.  It looked great bit really tasted bland.  I don't know how you can accomplish a bland dish with too much salt.  I had about 4 bites and left it.Slowly, Aurora managed to go from a 3-star to a 2-star to a 1-star in a matter of an hour.

"I don't know why the hell it took me so long to come here as I've lived in the area for a couple years now. I finally brought my boyfriend here for his birthday dinner and neither of us were disappointed. In fact, we both loved it.  We were able to get a seat in the enclosed garden area. I kind of wished it had been open because it was a really nice night out, but enclosed garden is better than no garden. We were excited to see a lambrusco on the wine list - sparkling red isn't something you see often. We ordered a bottle of that and it was nice and refreshing, not too sweet. The bread tin they brought contained foccaccia and some sort of whole grain bread, both of which were well accented by the nice olive oil they gave us. To start, I ordered the soup special - a gazpacho - and my boyfriend got the fava bean salad special. Both were excellent. My soup came topped with really thin breadsticks and avocado chunks. It was so fresh tasting and came in a much bigger portion than I expected. I tried the fava bean salad which was also really tasty, the beans were so nice and buttery.As entrees we each ordered a pasta. I wasn't sure how big the portion would be since the pastas are technically a first course, but each was definitely enough for a meal for us. There was a ravioli special for $30 that was calling my name, and it sounded so good I could almost justify spending that much on a pasta, but changed my mind and went with the $16 gnocchi instead. I was extremely pleased with my decision. The gnocchi were light and practically melted in my mouth. They came in a really nice tomato sauce with eggplant, fresh mozzarella, tomato, and pesto. My boyfriend got the wild boar ragu papardelle and he too really enjoyed it. After the gnocchi I was too stuffed to get dessert. My boyfriend got la crostata - a fruit tart topped with gelato. I tried and bite and it reminded me of the plum tart my German grandmother used to make when I was a kid. So yummy.The service was alright - nothing outstanding. I kind of felt like we got ignored after the dessert plate was cleared for the table and I had to flag the waiter down to ask for the check. The service was just fine up until then, though, so I can't really complain too much.Awesome, awesome place. My boyfriend is really picky and he totally enjoyed it. We would absolutely go back.",5.0

"A bunch of us went here on a Saturday night. Its a small place on a dark street in Brooklyn...but nonetheless, still packed by 8pm. Reservations are a must it seems. Service was really good, and we ordered a bunch of things off the menu. The bread they serve you is nice and warm and delicious dipped in olive oil. The lemonade special with mint, is quite delicious. Tastes like a non alcoholic mojito. The bison carpaccio was a large portion and though I dont eat bison, most of my friends devoured it pretty quickly. We also got the arborio rice balls ($4 only for one small portion, the size of an egg!), quite expensive I say, but tasty. The cheese inside was nice and melty and the exterior had a good crunch. The parmigiano cheese drizzled with balsamic, was some good sharp hard cheese. The le olive was not worth ordering again. The hit was the la pizzetta flatbread special with cheese and potatoes. soooo good! For entrees, the gnocchi was nice and light. Pasta al ragu was a combination of ground beef and pork. Nice flavors but too salty that night. The Spaghettini alla Carbonara had a ton of pancetta in it, but the dish was way too salty for me to enjoy any of the pancetta. (And i like my food salty normally!) And the spaghettini didnt taste like fresh made. There was a cheese ravioli special with mushrooms that was quite tasty. There was also another fresh pasta special with ossobucco and mushrooms which was just ok. The la Bistecca, though double the price of everything else on the menu, came in a hearty portion nicely presented. Good meal for someone who didnt want carbs. As for dessert, the chocolate bread pudding with hazelnut gelato was a hit! The panna cotta and tiramisu wasnt bad either. The only fail was their special lavender cheesecake.

"Aurora is a very special place for my husband and me. We have always loved the incredibly delicious food, beautiful, rustic decor and great service. This past July we celebrated my parents' 42nd wedding anniversary at Aurora and 2 weeks ago my husband and I got married in Aurora's picturesque outside space. Jessica coordinated the entire event and was able to create the most beautiful, intimate, chill wedding. We wanted to have a small, laid back, beautiful wedding with good food, good wine and celebrate with our dearest friends and family and that's exactly what Jessica created for us. She surpassed all our hopes for our special day. Everything was so easy and lovely. Perhaps I'm a bit biased, but it was the most perfect, beautiful wedding I've ever been to. Jessica worked with my lovely friend who did the flowers to make sure that the tables and lighting and garlands looked perfect. Emanuele oversaw the food and wine and made sure that everything came out smoothly. Everyone who attended raved about the food, wine and ambiance. Thank you, Aurora for giving us our dream wedding! We feel very lucky to have started our married life together with the loveliest, most memorable evening of our lives.",5.0
"I have been here for dinner before, very delish, love the wine selection, but finally went here for brunch yesterday.  It definitely hit the spot.  The garden patio was filled with warm sunlight and I got the eggs benedict which comes with coffee and brunch cocktail for $15, can't beat it!  Coffee was really good, eggs benedict with an Italian twist was totally satisfying and the bloody mary was spicy but not too overwhelming.  I will definitely be adding this to my regular rotation of brunch spots. Thank you Aurora for consistently serving up deliciousness!",4.0
"Top notch Italian.  This isn't your red sauce Italian restaurant that plagues Little Italy and most of America.  this is legit,  home cooked Italian cooking.  Rotating menu depending on time of year keeps the food fresh.  Tagliatelle with the special ragu of the day is a winner as is the meat/olive/cheese combo to start.  Also a very nice wine list with helpful sommeliers.  Definitely hit this up, so much better than Al Di La.",5.0
"2 stars for interior design and ambiance alone...I will never go backI have been to Aurora once before for dinner, I do recall the wait-staff being kind of flaky, but I left w/o any real complaints, until this past Sunday afternoon...We decided on a whim to check out Aurora for brunch, we were in the neighborhood so we went, unlucky for us!To put in simply, the service here is needs improvement. Not only are they unorganized, but also lack the simple ethics of being good servers...no social skills, no friendly greetings and especially no feelings of remorse when they know they messed up. They were NOT busy (one of 3 parties outside), and it seemed like the servers (not the bust staff) were all standing around 'looking busy.' I mean how do you not acknowledge a table of 3  has been sitting waiting for service for 25mins unattended (not even a drink order)?! We finally had to flag down the hostess who took our order. We then proceeded to watch 2 couples who were seated after us (after we had already ordered) being served their meals while we left grumbling over our small plate of fries (which is all they served us before I final got up and expressed my disdain). The hostess apologized and told me they were down a server, and that she didn't know about our orders since she wasn't a sever...lets recap, A-we were never given a server, B-we gave our order to you (hostess) C-It honestly seemed like they had too many servers running around and the place, like I said was empty.Food was eh, nothing memorable. DO NOT get the side order of fries you will be greatly displeased with what you get for $4.50. Just to clarify, I'm  by no means a food snob. Im just looking for a nice relaxing, hearty brunch to begin my Sunday,  but this bad experience almost seemed so unreal that I had to share it. They had to of known they really screwed up, all they did to make amends was comp our drinks (2 ojs & a bloody mary)...jeez thanks!This has been my worst restaurant experience in my 2yrs in Brooklyn. It is a shame, because at the onset, Aurora has a great atmosphere and a welcoming intimate interior (remembered that from my dinner date there). But alas, you can never judge a book by its cover.Needless to say, I will not visit Aurora again, they are plenty of better places in Wburg/Greenpoint to hit up, especially for brunch.",2.0

"Wow, what a disappointment.My party of five arrived at 7:30 on Friday night when only a few tables were filled, so we were surprised to have so many problems with our order.My boyfriend's pasta special was to have had pancetta in it. None was visible when the plate came out. It's kind of hard to miss pancetta.  When he asked our server, she said ""Oh, it's hidden in there."" Nope. No pancetta, no evidence of pancetta, no sign that pancetta had been cooked into the sauce, either from taste or consistency.I ordered rouget fillets and was brought scallops. Apparently the kitchen didn't inform the server that they were out and just made the substitution on my behalf. I didn't want scallops or I would have ordered them in the first place.  My friends waited ten minutes while their dishes got cold until I was brought the farfalle with lamb sausage and olives. Olives! They were right there on the menu. My dish had them, my friend's didn't.That's three out of five mains that made it off the pass missing ingredients that were listed on the menu. Pretty glaring errors. Nothing was comped, no apologies were made, we spent just over $300 and we won't be going back.",2.0
"Had wanted to try Aurora for a while. Too bad I went with someone I now cannot stand. Thanks a lot you psycho. Now my memory of this place will forever be tainted. Well at least I didn't have to get a restraining order. The decor is nice. The food is good, but nothing mindblowing. What I had I felt was clean and nicely done. If you live around the neighborhood, why not. I can't really say it is worth making a major trek for. But still it's a nice place. (I'd probably give it a 3.75 if I could)",4.0
"Given the reviews I figured Aurora could be a home run to celebrate my aunt and uncle's anniversary (staunch italians)... eh, not so much. Here's the rundown:Bread basket & oil dip: yummyAppetizer #1: Il Fritto (fried calamari, shrimp & baccala w/ smoked paprika mayonnaise) Calamari: perfect, Shrimp: 1 pc, Baccala: none, Mayo: very smokey, not for us.. Salt: 0Appetizer #2: La Pizzetta (flatbread gorgonzola, pear, radicchio) YumPrimo: Gli Agnolotti (cheese filled pasta w/ mushrooms & tomatoes) I don't expect a tomato sauce with mushrooms... imagined those 2 sauteed, I guess. My aunt thought so too, and said it was ok, but pushed all the tomatoes aside.Secondi #1: La Razza (Skate wing w/ chorizo, octopus & fregola). I tasted the fish which was very fishy. My friend enjoyed it very much but said she couldn't make out the chorizo.Secondi #2: La Braciola (Pork chop w/ black kale & white bean puree). Pork (my dish): perfectly cooked, puree excellent w/ pan sauce, black kale: yech! texture was just awful.. maybe it's just not for me.Secondi #3: La Bistecca (Steak w/ broccoli rabe & bone marrow). Steak: my uncle ordered this medium, was recommended medium rare... came out blue w/ a pulse... sent it back, came back medium rare. Steak: excellent taste. Broccoli rabe: should read puree, there were 2 tiny florets and an electric green puree pool, Bone marrow: ok, I don't understand how it fits with the dish, other than adding a vertical element.Dessert #1: Pannacotta. Rich... candied kumquat peels a nice touch.Dessert #2: Cioccolato (mine) Did not come with poached pears... small red berries, and the ganache wasn't really a ganache. Tasty but did not fit the description. The dark and stormy artisanal gelato was a lemon-ginger sorbet?!? Spicy & interesting but weird w/ the chocolate cake.Dessert #3: Affogato. Nice sized truffle ice cream. Mostly hazelnut tasting.Overall: A little pricey, I thought. I want to go back to taste their gnocchi. Service was excellent until dessert when the only waitress in the joint started to hit the weeds with 5 new tables... the check took awhile even with glances, nods & waves.",3.0
"Aurora is a very special place for my husband and me. We have always loved the incredibly delicious food, beautiful, rustic decor and great service. This past July we celebrated my parents' 42nd wedding anniversary at Aurora and 2 weeks ago my husband and I got married in Aurora's picturesque outside space. Jessica coordinated the entire event and was able to create the most beautiful, intimate, chill wedding. We wanted to have a small, laid back, beautiful wedding with good food, good wine and celebrate with our dearest friends and family and that's exactly what Jessica created for us. She surpassed all our hopes for our special day. Everything was so easy and lovely. Perhaps I'm a bit biased, but it was the most perfect, beautiful wedding I've ever been to. Jessica worked with my lovely friend who did the flowers to make sure that the tables and lighting and garlands looked perfect. Emanuele oversaw the food and wine and made sure that everything came out smoothly. Everyone who attended raved about the food, wine and ambiance. Thank you, Aurora for giving us our dream wedding! We feel very lucky to have started our married life together with the loveliest, most memorable evening of our lives.",5.0
"I have been here for dinner before, very delish, love the wine selection, but finally went here for brunch yesterday.  It definitely hit the spot.  The garden patio was filled with warm sunlight and I got the eggs benedict which comes with coffee and brunch cocktail for $15, can't beat it!  Coffee was really good, eggs benedict with an Italian twist was totally satisfying and the bloody mary was spicy but not too overwhelming.  I will definitely be adding this to my regular rotation of brunch spots. Thank you Aurora for consistently serving up deliciousness!",4.0
"Top notch Italian.  This isn't your red sauce Italian restaurant that plagues Little Italy and most of America.  this is legit,  home cooked Italian cooking.  Rotating menu depending on time of year keeps the food fresh.  Tagliatelle with the special ragu of the day is a winner as is the meat/olive/cheese combo to start.  Also a very nice wine list with helpful sommeliers.  Definitely hit this up, so much better than Al Di La.",5.0
"2 stars for interior design and ambiance alone...I will never go backI have been to Aurora once before for dinner, I do recall the wait-staff being kind of flaky, but I left w/o any real complaints, until this past Sunday afternoon...We decided on a whim to check out Aurora for brunch, we were in the neighborhood so we went, unlucky for us!To put in simply, the service here is needs improvement. Not only are they unorganized, but also lack the simple ethics of being good servers...no social skills, no friendly greetings and especially no feelings of remorse when they know they messed up. They were NOT busy (one of 3 parties outside), and it seemed like the servers (not the bust staff) were all standing around 'looking busy.' I mean how do you not acknowledge a table of 3  has been sitting waiting for service for 25mins unattended (not even a drink order)?! We finally had to flag down the hostess who took our order. We then proceeded to watch 2 couples who were seated after us (after we had already ordered) being served their meals while we left grumbling over our small plate of fries (which is all they served us before I final got up and expressed my disdain). The hostess apologized and told me they were down a server, and that she didn't know about our orders since she wasn't a sever...lets recap, A-we were never given a server, B-we gave our order to you (hostess) C-It honestly seemed like they had too many servers running around and the place, like I said was empty.Food was eh, nothing memorable. DO NOT get the side order of fries you will be greatly displeased with what you get for $4.50. Just to clarify, I'm  by no means a food snob. Im just looking for a nice relaxing, hearty brunch to begin my Sunday,  but this bad experience almost seemed so unreal that I had to share it. They had to of known they really screwed up, all they did to make amends was comp our drinks (2 ojs & a bloody mary)...jeez thanks!This has been my worst restaurant experience in my 2yrs in Brooklyn. It is a shame, because at the onset, Aurora has a great atmosphere and a welcoming intimate interior (remembered that from my dinner date there). But alas, you can never judge a book by its cover.Needless to say, I will not visit Aurora again, they are plenty of better places in Wburg/Greenpoint to hit up, especially for brunch.",2.0

My boyfriend and I make it a ritual to hit up Aurora's for brunch every weekend (we try our best) during the summer time. He always get the Eggs Benedict (it's supposedly the best Eggs Benedict ever). And I always try different things on the menu. The outdoor garden is really nice.

"In honor of Tara's recent engagement, I invited the bride-to-be to dinner on Saturday at Aurora in Williamsburg (Brooklyn).  If it's charm and romance that you're seeking, look no further than this  authentic Southern-Italian oasis in the middle of Brooklyn's concrete jungle.  Enclosed by exposed-brick walls and rustic wood paneling, the dimly-lit space is minimally decorated with old fashioned cooking ware and utensils, twinkling votive candles, and a bounteous vase filled with sprawling cherry blossom branches.  Make sure to grab a seat either inside of, or looking out at, Aurora's gorgeous garden space.Moments after we were seated, Tara and I were presented with dinner menus and a bountiful basket filled with homemade olive bread, caramelized-onion focaccia, and a small bowl of fragrant olive oil.After perusing Aurora's dinner menu, and Tara's ginormous engagement ring, we came to the mutual decision to split various plates-under the volition of our painfully-attractive Italian server.  We were so mesmerized by his accent, wavy brown hair, barely-there 5 o'clock shadow, perfectly chiseled nose, etc., that his offer to hand-select each and every aspect of our meal seemed like a brilliant idea...at the time.The first item we received was ""le olive,"" which was chosen from the portion of the dinner menu referencing, ""suggestions for the table.""  A small dish was filled with a colorful assortment of voluptuous, marinated olives that had flavor notes of cumin, citrus zest, and bay leaf.  Shortly thereafter came a thick, oval-shaped slice of toasted artisan bread that was liberally topped with: olive oil, freshly-ground black pepper and sea salt, creamy homemade mozzarella cheese, Meyer-lemon rind, Italian parsley, a dash of paprika, and bottarga di tonno.  Aside from the overly-salty/offensive/fishy tuna (bottarga), Tara and I loved the bruschetta.  The third appetizer to arrive was ""Lo Sformato Di Carciofi,"" or a savory artichoke flan with gorgonzola cheese.  This saliferous dish was reminiscent, both flavor and texture, to the creamy interior of a quiche and/or warm artichoke dip on crack; yet identical in shape and appearance to a dessert flan/panna cotta.  That being said, I've never had a quiche laced with chunks of fresh artichoke hearts and gorgonzola cheese-topped with freshly-ground black pepper and a drizzle of olive oil.  Tara and I found ourselves fork-fighting for the last bite.   The next two dishes to arrive were our entrees: a creamy pasta dish, and the L'Agnello Brodettato (lamb stew).  Tara and I were told that, with the exception of the spaghetti noodles, all of the pasta at Aurora was made in-house.  Since Miss T doesn't eat beef, our options were slightly limited.  I, for one, was craving ""La Pasta Al Ragu,"" which is comprised of a pasta base of your choice, and topped with a slow-cooked meat gravy (Oh well, that gives me a very good excuse to return now, doesn't it?).  The pasta was composed of homemade, perfectly al-dente ditaloni noodles (short ""tubes"") tossed with green peas, chopped ham, pecorino cheese, olive oil, and a dash of salt and pepper.  While both the texture and flavor were spot-on (the peas were earthy and as full as blueberries - the pasta had a nice ""bite"" - the ham lent a rich smokiness - the pungency of the pecorino cheese was cut by the delicate fragrance of the olive oil), I wasn't able to enjoy this dish to the fullest, as I simply could not get my mind off of something heartier, something...meatier.When our server explained the ""L'Agnello Brodettato (lamb stew),"" I couldn't get past the fact that it was thickened with egg yolk.  Those four words kept repeating themselves in my head and, to be quite honest, I was beginning to question my logic in letting this man choose every aspect of our meal.  A shallow pool of egg-yolk ""roux,"" which was actually a deep caramel in color, were 1x1/2""-thick chunks of lamb and roasted cubed potatoes.  I must have looked like a deer in headlights as I watched Tara take her first bite.  As our eyes met, she smiled and moaned, ""this is amazing!""  She was right-our server was right-this lamb stew was amazing!  The gamey meat fell apart from the slightest prick of my fork-the potatoes were crisp and buttery on the outside and tender on the inside-and that gravy!  If you had left out the ""egg yolk"" portion of the description, I would have never known/guessed that it was in there.  I found no awkward egg-y aftertaste, or the slightest hint of a scramble.  The stew had these lovely notes of rosemary that lingered on my tongue after every bite.  Never have I had a preparation of lamb that I can actually say that I truly liked, much less loved; this entree changed everything for me.",4.0
"This is one of my favorite places in Williamsburg. It is a rustic restaurant with a lovely rosegarden/atrium off to the side. The crowd tends to be a bit older than the typical Billyburg crew and the food is fantastic. Have eaten here twice, and both times enjoyed the food greatly. Just be prepared to wait 20-30 min beyond your reservation on a weekend. Last time I was there, I was pleasantly surprised by the tagliatelle a limone, which was a fantastic pasta dish.

"Figs. Just focus on that for a bit.  Imagine every fig you've ever had: the great one your grandmother gave you, the one you put in your mouth at the age of 4 when you thought it was a squirrel, the one you ate at that restaurant that everyone else loved but you hated.  Focus. Aurora does perfect things with Figs.Aurora is a wonderful little restaurant located in Hiptown USA.  An all italian, Aurora has an expansive wine list and menu, focusing on seasonal tastes and pairings.  The pasta menu is small but lovely with raviolis being the dish that I had (and loved).  The antipasta menu is covered in salads (I devoured a fig salad) and meat products.  All the portions are perfectly designed and you won't be left hungry.  The wine flows freely and is delicious.  The sauces are standard but perfectly well done - the boar ragu is the way boar ragu should be.  The noodles are supple and perfect in texture.  The desserts are light, cheery, and palate cleansing.  Nothing about the meals are heavy - lightness is the primary dish served here. The service is a little slow but if you're with someone perfect, you won't mind.  The outdoor eating area is wonderfully designed and laid out with a lovely Ivy covered wall serving as the backdrop for all the delicious dishes.  The prices are perfect and you get exactly what you pay for.  This is the kind of restaurant that every neighborhood should have.",5.0
"A painful wait, even late at night.  A spotty liquor shelf.  A broken patio table that we had to fix ourselves because the waiter couldn't hear us over the too loud music.  Hipsters photographing and crowding our table because we happened to be sitting next to Jonas Mikas, the experimental film artist (oh so Williamsburg).  Much spendier than I expect from a neighborhood joint ($70 per).  A bumbling, inattentive waiter.  But what would normally make for Very Grumpy Ben was made up for by excellent food.  The pasta alone is (almost) worth the price of admission -- the papardelle with black truffles was especially good.  And once the hipsters got their artsy fartsy fill and dissipated, being out on the brick patio was down right nice.The wifey thinks thought this was one of the best meals we had in NY all week, over places like Babbo.  While I disagree with that, I will definitely make a point to come back.",3.0

I have been repeatedly and look forward to going back.",5.0
"They make their own bread and their own biscottis, which get replenished with each new cup of coffee.  Since I only eat sugar once a week I saved all the biscottis until my sugar day (which fortunately was the following day) and omg they are AMAZING.  with the diet that i'm on i was able to eat only certain things from the menu.  I chose the seared tuna with sunflower seed and cumin crust in tomato broth.  Seriously amazing.  It was the first time I've had seared ahi that didn't use the customary wasabi,  sesame, soy sauce, ginger elements.  It was brilliant.Charming place with beautiful outdoor garden, slightly more expensive and cash only.  But the most amazing thing is I took my entire family there, and they are a very tough crowd, having travelled all over the world and especially all over italy NUMEROUS times.  There was not a single complaint from any of them...4 foodies.  That's big. Go there.  BRING CASH.  And say hi to the chef.  He's from Wales, he's awesome and he knows his shit.",4.0
"The food here was fantastic, the vibe was great (we sat outside), and the staff were super accomodating.  I had the ravioli of the day, and it was totally tasty.  The wine list is great, and as I said: the vibe is really great.My only complaint would be closing time:  we were seated for a 10 o'clock seating, and as it edged towards midnight, we were definitely encouraged to finish up asap.  I understand they have to close, but at the same time, it seems like you should only allow for seatings where customers can at least have a two hour meal, especially with a menu as extensive as this.Also, cash only, which for a meal in this price range is pretty inconvenient.  I felt dangerously close to a mafioso carrying that much cash.",4.0

I have been repeatedly and look forward to going back.",5.0
"They make their own bread and their own biscottis, which get replenished with each new cup of coffee.  Since I only eat sugar once a week I saved all the biscottis until my sugar day (which fortunately was the following day) and omg they are AMAZING.  with the diet that i'm on i was able to eat only certain things from the menu.  I chose the seared tuna with sunflower seed and cumin crust in tomato broth.  Seriously amazing.  It was the first time I've had seared ahi that didn't use the customary wasabi,  sesame, soy sauce, ginger elements.  It was brilliant.Charming place with beautiful outdoor garden, slightly more expensive and cash only.  But the most amazing thing is I took my entire family there, and they are a very tough crowd, having travelled all over the world and especially all over italy NUMEROUS times.  There was not a single complaint from any of them...4 foodies.  That's big. Go there.  BRING CASH.  And say hi to the chef.  He's from Wales, he's awesome and he knows his shit.",4.0
"The food here was fantastic, the vibe was great (we sat outside), and the staff were super accomodating.  I had the ravioli of the day, and it was totally tasty.  The wine list is great, and as I said: the vibe is really great.My only complaint would be closing time:  we were seated for a 10 o'clock seating, and as it edged towards midnight, we were definitely encouraged to finish up asap.  I understand they have to close, but at the same time, it seems like you should only allow for seatings where customers can at least have a two hour meal, especially with a menu as extensive as this.Also, cash only, which for a meal in this price range is pretty inconvenient.  I felt dangerously close to a mafioso carrying that much cash.",4.0
"I was hoping it would be great since I went there for thanks giving.But the course menue was kind of dissapointing. I think I will go on regular nights to see if it is better without all the pumpkin and turkey stuff for thanks givingThe atmosphere made up for the sort of tasteless meal, but I would recommend checking the place for lunch before you spend alot on dinner.But definitely a great place for a date.",3.0
Had the lychee martini...I have had better but not bad. Decided to bring parents here. Think that was a bit of mistake...the music I think is a little to loud making everyone speak over the music. Parking was a little hard to find on a Friday night. I liked the old rustic feel of the place. But I have a question for the owner if you spent money for a toto toilet can't you spend a few extra dollars on a lock for the bathroom?I had the steak it was excellent! highly recommendedordered the salad with the squash it was also very good i would love to go back again service is great as well,4.0
"the experience, the garden and the delicious heart-warming pasta dishes make aurora one of my favorite restaurants in the neighborhood.  whether you're visiting for brunch, lunch or dinner, you can bet you'll leave with a full belly and a smile on your face.  our most recent visit was with friends who had traveled from the far west: the upper west side that is...  it's always a treat when they make their way out to williamsburg so we had to pick a special spot to take them to.  with a last name of del bene, you'd think they'd be psyched to check out our favorite italian restaurant.  until they told us they'd recently decided to go gluten-free...  hmm, what to do?  we went to aurora anyway.  i, of course, dug into the pasta special; pappardelle with gorgeous mushrooms and black truffle. i really tried to be a lady and leave a little leftover on the plate but you just can't do that here.  the food is so luscious and flavor-filled, you can count on me to be a member of the clean plate club. our gluten-free friends fared quite well also.  i'm told the chicken was perfectly crispy on the outside and tender on the inside and the scallops had been seared to perfection. we finished our meal with an affogato, i'm sorry i don't have a picture of this one to share.  our icecream drowned in espresso obviously didn't last too long.  it was rich, had that slight bitterness and that hot/cold combination that always makes the flavors and textures of dishes more dynamic.  if you're lucky enough to snag a table in the garden, be sure to soak up the scenery.  whether it's a frosty evening in december or a cool summer night, their garden is comfortable in any season.  treat yourself and enjoy every bite of it.  the well rounded menu and tasty wine list have made me a repeat offender : )",4.0
"First thing's first: They serve foie gras, which I only noticed after we were seated and ordered drinks. Normally, I would boycott any place that serves foie gras, but especially in animal-friendly Williamsburg. Unfortunately, since we were starving, we decided to stay. Second: They ONLY take cash. For a restaurant that averages a $100-bill for 2 people, that is really crazy. It's such a ridiculous inconvenience and a real doozie at the end of an expensive meal. Who wants to go through the trouble of producing $100 plus in cash?Third: the food. It was, simply, just average. Nothing, absolutely nothing, to rave about. Our waiter messed up our entrees, and brought us two wrong plates, after which we had to wait another 10 minutes for the correct plates to arrive.The cocktails are $11 each. Again, really up there for Williamsburg. If this was the West Village, sure, I'd understand. But come on. A little ridiculous. The garden is divided into 2 areas: one that is more enclosed and the other that is right under the sky. The latter is extremely dark. People were struggling to read their menus and see their food. I'm all for dim, sexy atmosphere, but beware that you will be straining your eyes like crazy sitting there. Some artificial light would have been appreciated. The service is gracious, but slow. There seemed to be dozens of waiters, busboys running around, but when you really needed something, it was hard to get attention. Until they take foie gras off the menu, will not be dining here again.** Addendum: I just checked the inspection report for this place (something I do from time to time and recommend everyone should as well) and found this interesting, scary piece of info about Aurora: ""Evidence of mice or live mice present in facility's food and/or non-food areas.""EEK!",2.0

"The wife and I ate here on a gorgeous night and had a fantastic meal. I started with an octopus appetizer that really worked for me. The octopus had just a touch of char on it that I really enjoyed. It went well with the mixed herbs, roasted tomatoes, and olives that accompanied it. It wasn't amazing, but it was definitely very good. For my main I went with the mint, English pea, ricotta filled pasta. I found this dish to be outstanding. Each little ravioli was a packet of yum. I worried it might be a bit heavy, but I was way off. The mint gave the filling a very light taste and the sauce was just perfect for a summer night. Plump warm cherry tomatoes and thinly sliced squash helped lighten things further and added to the overall fresh feel of the dish. I loved this! My wife ordered a three milk cheese for an appetizer (which our friendly waitress suggested after my wife showed an interest in the cheese specials) and it was knock your socks off good. Her main was a pasta dish with pesto and mozzarella. She enjoyed it. I tried it, but liked mine a lot more. Besides our food, the waitress was a sweetheart and the timing was superb. We never felt rushed or pestered. Overall, pretty darn impressive.",4.0

I tried 2 wonderful appetizers and both of them are made with very fresh, simple ingredients, and chesse revioli as main dish, it was too oily and solitary, I would prefer to have 2-3 pieces of olives or cherry tomatos, or paresly. Overall it is a great place, nice staffs, not too interruptive but helpful and serve with courtesy.",3.0
"This is by far the best Italian restaurant in Williamsburg. Very inventive entrees, home made pastas, always a hint of truffle wafting in the air. Laid back atmosphere with a very romantic ambiance. The service is quick, considerate, and knowledgeable. Their wine list is fantastic, reflecting the inventiveness, quality, and taste of the cuisine.",5.0
"The wife and I ate here on a gorgeous night and had a fantastic meal. I started with an octopus appetizer that really worked for me. The octopus had just a touch of char on it that I really enjoyed. It went well with the mixed herbs, roasted tomatoes, and olives that accompanied it. It wasn't amazing, but it was definitely very good. For my main I went with the mint, English pea, ricotta filled pasta. I found this dish to be outstanding. Each little ravioli was a packet of yum. I worried it might be a bit heavy, but I was way off. The mint gave the filling a very light taste and the sauce was just perfect for a summer night. Plump warm cherry tomatoes and thinly sliced squash helped lighten things further and added to the overall fresh feel of the dish. I loved this! My wife ordered a three milk cheese for an appetizer (which our friendly waitress suggested after my wife showed an interest in the cheese specials) and it was knock your socks off good. Her main was a pasta dish with pesto and mozzarella. She enjoyed it. I tried it, but liked mine a lot more. Besides our food, the waitress was a sweetheart and the timing was superb. We never felt rushed or pestered. Overall, pretty darn impressive.",4.0
"I have walked by this place so many times and had never bothered to go in until last weekend. Aurora has a very comfortable atmosphere with a hearty menu. I went for brunch and was impressed with the selections. I almost got the spinach fondue but decided that was too crazy for the morning, so I got the egg breakfast. The fried eggs I ordered came with white beans in tomato sauce, a potato croquette and some good crusty bread.There is an outdoor seating area, which was completely full when I went last Sunday, because they have heat lamps, so even in winter you can sit out there!I hear dinner is also worth having.",4.0
"Every place has it's one dish that you order and mine is the shrimp and pasta entree. Tangy and spicy, it is best eaten on the patio. That said the staff could be nicer and the cash only policy (yes, yes I know there is an ATM) makes me think of the mob.",4.0

"Went here tonight with my Mom who was visiting me for the night. I asked my boss for suggestions on where to take my Mom out to dinner in Brooklyn, and the first place she mentioned was Aurora.I made reservations for 8pm for outside in the garden, no problem. The food is Italian, and it's pricey. For the two of us we paid $78 not including tip and that included one salad that we split, 2 entrees, a martini for Mom, and a dessert that we split as well. It's not too expensive, but expensive enough that I can't make a trip to Aurora every week on my Film PA budget. The food was good but it wasn't amazingly eventful for me. There are much cheaper places in the area that I'd rather eat at for the food. But the atmosphere at Aurora is just lovely. So old world and European-feeling. I love the exposed brick and paint that looks so old. I can imagine that Aurora would be stunning in the winter with lots of candlelight and beautiful people in boots and sweaters. It's kind of off-the-beaten-path so you don't get a lot of traffic noise (the automobile, bike, or person kind). Very romantic date spot indeed.",4.0
"I had no idea this place was so popular, the gift certificate my mom got me for xmas last december sat in my room for 9 mos.  When my brother came to town I thought I'd take him and his lady friend out for a nice meal.  Wow was I surprised, this place was really good. especially the burratta.  duck 2 ways was really nice and my brother really liked the uni and red mullet linguine.  only thing i wasnt impressed with was the orrechiette with brocolli rabe and sausage.  where were the hot peppers in this rather soupy dish i mean way too watery.",4.0

"A solid restaurant... very cool and hip scene.. but hey, it's in Williamsburg, so you have to be cool and hip.  But the food is very good... not the best Italian I have ever had, but definitely above average, with plenty of scene to look at.  A great place to take a date and to feel like you da man.  Also, not too hard to get a last minute reservation.  Great wine list and plenty to choose from on the menu with good value to money ratio.  I go back... not too often, but I do go back.",4.0

"This has been one of my favorite restaurants since moving to the city, which is saying a lot because it has consistently impressed, rather than just being a flash in the pan. The ambiance is one of the main draws -- it reminds me of an old English inn with its wooden benches and floors and quaint garden with the vine-covered brick walls. Summer dinners are obviously a draw, but the brunch is superb, too. It's my favorite place on Sunday mornings with the paper.. you can while away a good hour with just coffee and the pain au chocolat!I went last week for dinner and had a beautiful, light, seared tuna over a bed of white beans and a nice summery salad; the wait staff I thought was impeccable if not a little overbearing in their attention.
