"Came here with 3 other friends a bit before noon because I wanted to try poutine. I was so excited that they had vegetarian and even a vegan option??! I ordered the classic poutine (fries, gravy, & cheese curds) with mushroom gravy for $6.95 including tax. I was in heaven! The cheese becomes a melted gooey delicious mess after a while due to the hot gravy. Even with a regular size, I was so stuffed. (I had skipped breakfast too.) My other friends ordered a classic poutine with bbq beef gravy, a mushroom special poutine, and the pulled pork poutine. There were plenty of other options. You can even get just belgian fries, if poutine is a bit too heavy. When in doubt, just stick to the good ol' classic poutine. There are shakes and baked goods too!! I tried the mango lassi drink my friend ordered. Tasted like mango ice cream! So delicious. They make everything in house so its super fresh and tasty! I'll have to come back and order the desserts and drinks next time.They workers were very friendly and helpful. The girl in the front allowed customers to taste the sauces before choosing whay to buy. Don't be afraid to ask for sauce samples! She also asked how our meal was and said bye to us as we left. (Thank you lady in the grey beanie!) In the time I sat there eating my food, I saw many mothers wheeling their strollers. There is a step up to get into the shop. I also saw a dog inside so I think they're pet friendly? (Maybe only if you order take out.) But beware because there is a yapping doggy right next door. Inside there are around 7 chairs with a ledge to put your food along the wall. It's only spring but it was pretty hot inside the shop, probably from frying all the yummy food. There is a bench area right in front of the store surrounding a small tree though! Definitely check this place out with your friends!Overall:Service 5/5Food 5/5Environment 4.5/5Potatoes 10/5",5.0
"Eating fries for dinner sounds as calorically naughty a proposition as having candy for breakfast, which is precisely why my carb-loving girlfriend and I did it. At first glance, Perfect Potato may seem like a small, unimpressive eatery with a tiny open kitchen but don't let looks fool you. Behind the counter are some of the friendliest servers I've ever met, who will answer questions about the menu and dole out samples with rare amicability. The fryers beside them churn out some of the most serious fries that I've ever had. While I confess I have no idea what makes them Belgian, these thick cut babies are hot, perfectly seasoned, and fried fresh with each order. They would be fantastic on their own (and clearly, Perfect Potato thinks so too, because they have several enticing options for dipping sauces available) but what drew my eyes were the poutines. We can thank our Canadian friends up north for cleverly discovering the beautiful friendship that can be struck up between fries, gravy, and cheese curds but if you can't readily cross the border to get the real deal, I would say Perfect Potato serves up a compelling copy. I ordered the 'classic', which dishes up a healthy portion of spuds, your choice of gravy (beef, mushroom, vegan, and BBQ beef), and cheese. A simple three-ingredient dinner like this can arguably fly or fail spectacularly, depending on the taste and quality of each. I would say that Perfect Potato does all three almost perfectly. I chose the mushroom gravy and discovered halfway into the meal that they accidentally gave me the regular gravy, but after the first few bites, I found it so deep, rich, and savory that I couldn't bring myself to tear away from it long enough to hand it back to the counter. I've already sung my praises of the fries but I should also add that using a thicker variety was an excellent choice because there's nothing worse than a flaccid fry. These stood up well to the enormous ladle of gravy, even as I worked pretty slowly through my bowl. The cheese was probably the least enamoring portion of the meal, looking more like cubed mozzarella than true curds, but it's hard to hate something that gets all melty, gooey, and stretchy before your eyes. Should you be one of the bizarre and monstrous creatures who hates fries, you can get a poutine on a bed of mashed potato instead (why? WHY?!) and while the short menu remains beautifully within the bounds of what they do so well, they do offer milkshakes and baked goods that might just be the cherry to top this lovely potato pie. The downsides are few - no bathrooms and a sore lack of seating space (and that what's available is far from comfortable). Also, slow eaters will find that the remaining cheese and gravy congeal to form an unappealing conglomeration but the first hot, delicious bites make it easy to forgive the cool mess that forms afterwards.",4.0
"We walked by a couple of months ago and immediately added it to our must-try list. When we returned yesterday, free samples were being distributed outside, and based on the many choices of fry dips, each more delicious than the last, we knew we'd made the right decision.The staff here is so nice, always asking if they can give you a taste test or recommend something tailored to what you're looking for. We tried the ""Hangover Cure"" poutine--Belgian fries, cheese curds, gravy, lardons, veggies, a fried egg, and blueberries. (You wouldn't think the blueberries would work, but they totally do.) We also got some fries with the asiago pesto sauce, which was excellent.Unfortunately they were out of sweet potato donuts when we were there, so we'll have to come back to try those (and some of the other poutines!). We did, however, get a chance to sample two of the more adventurous milkshake flavors, and both blew us away. Banana cream pie comes with little pieces of crust blended in, which gets tons of points in my book. The brownie bite flavor is vanilla with chunks of brownies, plus a hint of ginger, a combination I found exquisite--and this is coming from someone who's not a huge fan of ginger.In short: amazing and unique food, friendly and helpful staff, and totally worth a visit all around. Only thing I could think of to improve would be to have more/more comfortable seating, which I'm sure will come in time.",5.0
"So we have joked about wanting to go here everytime we passed, and finally on Saturday it was a good break for a snack. The staff was surprisingly SO nice and friendly for a small french fry joint, all the food looked and sounded good, it was cheap and you got a huge portion.  We just had a classic poutine for the first time, and it was delicious. I am very curious about the hangover, the only sad thing about that is the shop is a good walk from our apartment, and when you're hungover, that can be hard.  Never the less, a good pit-stop if you are walking and shopping in the hood.",5.0
"I was giddy with anticipation last year when I saw a French fry restaurant was opening on 5th Ave. Fast forward over the past 12 months and I couldn't be happier. Besides the fact that the fries are simply perfect (and generously portioned), the customer service can't be beat. The staff is incredibly cheerful, helpful and create a happy and upbeat ambiance! I can't say much about the other dishes, as I haven't tried them, but I do love the fountain ""cokes."" I think they're natural or have less sugar, but whatever it is, I'm a sucker for a fountain coke and these do not leave me dissatisfied. For the record, I'm a ketchup kind of girl, but I've tried their jerk sauce and it was spicy & delicious. If you're in the neighborhood, you MUST stop by for some fries!",5.0
"The Peanut Butter & Jelly Milkshake I had here was far closer to perfection than the strange poutine and the too thick Belgian Fries.The simple menu at this small new place, which is now at least the 4th or 5th all potato eatery in NY, is a little different than the others in that they also offer several varieties of poutine.There were a couple specials available, including a vegan one, but I went with what is usually a safe option and ordered the one called ""The Hangover Cure"" (by safe, I mean the one usually covered in tons of good junk and really delicious artery-clogging stuff) ($10 for the regular size).The cool thing is that they are dropping the fries into the fryer on the spot, so it's all very fresh. The bad thing is that this poutine did not taste very good. Instead of some chopped up bacon and a beautiful, runny fried egg like I expected, the bowl of fries was topped with a hard-cooked egg with a solid yolk, a few pieces of strip bacon scattered around, and even stranger, a bunch of random vegetables like peppers, tomatoes, onions and peas (trust me: don't put peas in your poutine).After a minute or so, the gravy congealed in a really lumpy, unappetizing way, so we didn't bother eating much more. We also got a medium order of the Belgian Fries ($7), which tasted much better, but were not nearly as good as say Pommes Frites or several other fry joints. They were too thick and not nearly crispy enough.Lastly, as mentioned above, they also have shakes to go with the fries, and these seem to be the bright spot of the menu. I went with a small PB&J ($8), which was actually incredible. As the very helpful and polite employee and her manager informed me, they grind the peanuts fresh in house rather than using jarred peanut butter. You could definitely taste this, as you got chunks of peanuts with every sip. This one is the must order if you are a fan of peanut butter.The owner was very energetic and super friendly, but I just didn't particularly enjoy the fries. If I was in the neighborhood though, I would definitely stop in to try another one of the great shakes.",3.0
"What a heavenly bowl of deliciousness. I had the Pork Poutine and it really hit the spot, the pork was a tad sweet but that's just a preference. The gravy, curds, fries, and veggies were all in great proportions and I will definitely be back for more. There is a small arc of counter style seating around half the inside but I opted for take out and the container was sufficiently sturdy to hold the creation inside. Stephanie? was super nice and up-sold me on a banana cream pie milkshake that I don't regret for one second. A+ kind of employee. I will certainly be back for more, and am curious to try out their ""hangover cure""  and see if it works.",4.0
Food was great. Ordered the roast pork poutine. The food took maybe 5 minutes longer than it should which is not a big deal but they were nice enough to offer a free milkshake!,5.0
"Best belgian fries I have ever tasted in my life. The sauces are amazing! Very good variety of flavors. The owner Stephanie was extremely personable.

"LOVE this place. All of the staff is very friendly, and I've never walked away unsatisfied. Every milkshake I've tried has been delicious, and the fries and sauces are also spectacular (I especially liked the coconut curry). I've never tried the poutine, but it's next on my list. Although maybe not the ""healthiest"" meal, definitely come here if you want some of the best fries and shakes in Park Slope! Most definitely worth a try (or two or three or four...)",4.0
"TLDR; Small shop. No bathroom. Come here for fries and good sauces as a snack. Very friendly staff.The Perfect Potato is a very small shop with seating only along one wall and the window. There is also no bathroom. BUT this place has killer service! The staff was extremely patient and friendly. They enthusiastically told us about ingredients in case of allergies and introduced us to their homemade sodas while not being pushy or overwhelming (Trust me, I'm so socially awkward. I really hate when people try to sell me anything uncalled for.)I wish this place had more options for potatoes because I only saw fries, poutine, and mashed potato poutine. I never had poutine before this but for those who are wondering, it is basically fries covered in gravy and cheese curd. I tried the following:- Mashed Potato Poutine w/ Roast Pork: I split the regular size with my boyfriend when we were hungry and it was enough along with everything else we got. It's a pretty filling dish topped with onions, bacon, edamame, cucumber, and cherry tomatoes. I like the taste but I did get tired of it halfway through because I don't really like cheese curd. It was warm but the toppings made some of the bites pretty cold and I didn't like how that mixed.- Small Fries with 2 sauces (1st one is free): Fries are delicious, especially with sauces!! We got ""Sun Dried Tomato Pesto with Roasted Garlic and Oregano"" which was my personal favorite. My boyfriend got the ""Jamaican Jerk"" and he said it was the best funky ketchup he's ever had in his life. To me, it had a nice tint of spice like a light BBQ ketchup. I prefer the ""Sun Dried"" though. Overall, the fries were thick, crispy and not too salty on its own. GET THE FRIES.",4.0
"Took my date to this beloved gem and it was absolutely DELISH! We both ordered the hangover poutine, which you can choose either in a regular or large size, and it filled us up.

The pork was tender, gravy was great and the peppers and curds were perfectly placed. However, a couple of the fries were little raw. I also tried the jerk ketchup one of my friends ordered. It was great, but the jerk seasoning tasted very similar to a store-bought seasoning I use. I guess they can't make everything from scratch.Great little place with good food and staff.

"Hold on to your housecoats Canadians.  I just discovered a place that serves up farm fresh poutine that people from all of North America (and beyond) will enjoy!  Using nearly 100% locally sourced ingredients, Perfect Potato assembles gargantuan bowls of spudtastic deliciousness.  I tried the roast pork poutine on my first visit to PP and was blown away by the symphony of flavors, texture and quality of ingredients.  (Big fan of the heirloom tomatoes and cheese curds in particular.)  The small was enough food for a dinner and the large could easily feed 2-3, dare I say 4, people.  Like most poutine dishes I've tried, both in Canada and elsewhere, the fries tend to pile up on the bottom so be sure to mix it up a little as you chow through the succulent pork and bacon bits.  The team behind the counter is friendly and the restaurant space is modern and clean.  The only seating available is a shallow countertop along the wall and storefront featuring basic bar stools (think a tall chair from Ikea).  It's not the most comfortable and certainly not a lot of seating.  They also offer shakes (no vegan option yet but they said one might be introduced soon), Belgian fries and cola.  All of their bowls, utensils and cups are made of high quality biodegradable materials.  What's more to say other than don't be a couch potato, go out and try this place.  It's totally worth a trip from a neighboring borough.",5.0

Do you know when you have food that tastes like love? Well that's their Roast Pork Poutine. Flavor profile was impeccable. Ingredients were super fresh and trust me this is a whole meal.  I'm excited  they are in my neighborhood and I can't wait to go back and try the plain fries with their special dipping sauces.,5.0
"I would love to give this place a positive review but I truly can't. No fault in service but they are trying to hard with something so simple. Described as ""gourmet fries"" they lacked seasoning. $6-8 not worth it.",2.0
"Had take away Poutine (The Hangover with a fried egg, vidalia onions and slab bacon). The owner, working the register was amazing to talk to and added some heirloom tomatoes on top. I'm sitting at work eating, and had to write a review. Legit delicious.Love finding new favorites in old neighborhoods.",5.0

Last Meal in Brooklyn.I had a delicious roast pork poutine here as my final meal in Brooklyn before moving the next day to Manhattan.  It was just the comfort I needed as an ominous thunderstorm rolled in with pelting rain.  The cheerful service and friendly and supportive conversation were greatly appreciated.  Thanks guys!  If I am ever back in the neighborhood I'll be sure to come by again.  The banana creme pie shake is also outstanding!  Everything is freshly made in-house.,5.0
"When you have a name as strong as ""The Perfect Potato. You would think that the fries would be great. Sadly it was the exact  opposite reaction. Didn't like it at all. Had the fries and they were strange, burnt and had a weird flavor. I could of made better fries then that. Sorry was looking forward to that. To us? they tasted old, had a weird flavor and I think they were reheated or re fried. Something was way way off with them.",1.0
"Hold on to your housecoats Canadians.  I just discovered a place that serves up farm fresh poutine that people from all of North America (and beyond) will enjoy!  Using nearly 100% locally sourced ingredients, Perfect Potato assembles gargantuan bowls of spudtastic deliciousness.  I tried the roast pork poutine on my first visit to PP and was blown away by the symphony of flavors, texture and quality of ingredients.  (Big fan of the heirloom tomatoes and cheese curds in particular.)  The small was enough food for a dinner and the large could easily feed 2-3, dare I say 4, people.  Like most poutine dishes I've tried, both in Canada and elsewhere, the fries tend to pile up on the bottom so be sure to mix it up a little as you chow through the succulent pork and bacon bits.  The team behind the counter is friendly and the restaurant space is modern and clean.  The only seating available is a shallow countertop along the wall and storefront featuring basic bar stools (think a tall chair from Ikea).  It's not the most comfortable and certainly not a lot of seating.  They also offer shakes (no vegan option yet but they said one might be introduced soon), Belgian fries and cola.  All of their bowls, utensils and cups are made of high quality biodegradable materials.  What's more to say other than don't be a couch potato, go out and try this place.  It's totally worth a trip from a neighboring borough.",5.0

"1. it finally fills a french fry niche that was conspicuously missing from the neighborhood restaurant market2. if you're very hungry you can get the poutine which might be more food than you can really eat. they are priced at just under ten dollars for the regular size, it is a very large portion of food. i couldn't finish it all. if you get the large i recommend storing it in your cheeks like a chipmunk, or why not recruit a Poutine Helper off the street to help you finish your poutine. the price of the poutine does not include the cost of hiring a Poutine Helper so keep that in mind3. they have banana cream pie milkshakes. the previous sentence is not missing punctuation, they literally have milk shakes made with banana cream pie. 4. they have french fries and i want french fries. they have smaller normal servings to feed people who just want the fries.5. they are nice to me. i think they saw the irish guy pawing at the door to the potato restaurant and opened a couple of minutes early for mei got the hangover poutine, even though i wasn't hung over (despite being irish). poutine is a very savory dish no matter which style you get, and here they serve it with plenty of cheese and sauce and the fries are fresh. the hangover poutine has a candied bacon, and is topped with two fried eggs (the kind with orange-yellow yolks) and you break the yolks and it helps tie the rest of the dish together nicely. some of the poutines also have fresh veggies in them which was a nice touch. mine had fresh peas and onions. the onions did not overpower this dish so don't be afraid of them. I don't eat a ton of salt so I was worried this would be too salty but it was just right. i saw other people getting the regular fries & milkshakes for their kids and the kids really liked them because why the hell would a kid not want milkshakes and fries all the time that's what children are paid to do",5.0
