"This place is legit. In an area stripped of any culture (sorry) this is one of the only ethnic restaurants around. Everything is very authentic! From the atmosphere, toThe menu, to the taste of the food it's allSpot on! Too bad it's not in my area or I would go more often. However now whenever I am in the area and not looking for the typical ""sushi, pizza, Italian"" food I'll hit up this place for the best Latin food in Brooklyn. Tucked away you'd never know it but this place is a treasure!",5.0
Food was very good. Although a bit pricey as other patrons have stated. That green sauce is everything and I enjoyed the chicken.  Didn't enjoy having to buy a  side with it though. Sangria was delicious. Had the red and white. Both were good.  Service was attentive. We got there early afternoon so there are only a few patrons inside. Music was horrible and became annoying after awhile. There was no variety and after a while it just droned on,4.0
"After passing this place a few times, always wanting to try it , plus hearing other people rave about Lima & finally stopping in to say hello, I wish I didn't take it TO-GO. This place has such a nice , cool vibe inside. Kinda small yet vibrant. We were greeted at the host stand with menus in hand. I had the skirt steak which was pretty flavorful with some special marinade , yellow rice which was just rice nothing more , yet still delicious & I ordered a side of Tostonas- which were absolutely delicious. It was a pretty generous portion for being a ""side"". Don't know the names of the accompanied sauces/dips but they were delicious. I didn't try a desert but I will be in the future.  The bar seemed to be fully stocked , service was great (from what I witnessed). The people that were dining in seemed to be enjoying everything & people kept coming in.",5.0
"The waiter was great. I was surprised he was the only one doing the greeting, the food ordering, the serving and everything! As impressive as he was as a waiter, the food was ok. We ordered the empanadas, the fried calamari, the lomo saltado, and the skirt steak. The empanadas had a peculiar taste. The fried calamari was ok but I barely tasted the calamari. The lomo saltado was good as well as the skirt steak. The price was decent, the portion was enough for 3 people. Definitely worth trying.",3.0
"Stumbled upon it during a random search on Yelp for area restaurants. Beautiful, intimate place. Slow on a Saturday. Great, friendly staff. I ordered the Pollo saltado ($18) sautéed chicken chunks with soy sauce, red onion, tomato in a Wok, oriental style served with rice and fries. Food was light and delicious. Couldn't quite understand the dish with the fries, but my tummy did not complain. Nice and spacious, single stall restroom with similar interior design of restaurant.",5.0
"The food is good, the ambiance is great and the owner and his family are warm people. Both the red and white sangrias are delicious. Will be back",4.0
If you're looking for great Peruvian food you need to stop in LimaWe like to get the whole chicken it's always fresh and delicious and try the green sauce  it's fantasticSides of rice and beans and the sangria(white or red) is always a must,5.0
I came here twice while I was pregnant and the food was pretty good. Reminded me a lot of Pio Pio. I had the rice chicken beans and tostones and they were all pretty good I took some food to go and unfortunately it didn't taste as good the next day. A bit expensive for Spanish food but than again it's mill basin not sunset.,4.0
"""Sometimes you wanna go, where everybody knows your naaaaame..."", except the owner who greeted us didn't know our names, but still welcomed us like we were his long lost cousins! Heyyyy primo!!!Thus charmed, speedily seated, and armed with Yelp knowledge, we went ahead and ordered the sangria, Jalea seafood platter and the fried rice with shrimp. Of course it all came with that delightful greenish sauce, which was the perfect relish for the food.  But Listen Up: I don't know what they're putting in that sangria, but I was giggling after the 3rd sip. I'm no lightweight, but hey - strong drinks @ weak prices are A-ok with me!Regarding the food: even though we ordered the half-Jalea, we couldn't finish it all between the two of us. It consisted of a ton of calamari, a good amount of shrimp, some fish, a few baby octopi, and a soft-shell crab. The taste was great, but it would have been nice to have less calamari and more fish or crab; but it was still a solid meal overflowing with deliciousness. We found the fried rice to be a bit too salty, but still flavorful. Overall, we had a great experience - good food, charming and clean surroundings, and a robust sangria. Looking forward to the next time!",4.0
"The crowd and staff here are super friendly; during my first time, I felt like a regular. I suspect part of the reason everyone is so friendly is the sangria - the mix is strong. We split the empanadas and the chaufa. The empanadas were good. I thought the aji verde was outstanding! Way better than mine. I smothered every bite of my empanada with it. The chaufa is a chicken fried rice - simple and delicious.All in all, the food, the staff, and the atmosphere was great. It was just very pricy for the cuisine.",4.0
"Came for lunch while visiting my brother in Brooklyn. Everything was absolutely delicious. Shared appetizers tapas style. We had manchehgo croquettes, empanadas, Peruvian chicken ""lettuce"" wraps which are actually endive, empanadas, fries with sausage and ceviche mixto.  Perhaps the most delicious red sangria I have ever had. Service was sweet and friendly, the place is very attractive and clean. Really enjoyed everything. Highly recommended.",5.0
"Delicious!  Some of the best Peruvian food I've ever had. Everything is fresh and very tasty. My family and I love this place. And if you're in the mood for a sweet treat after dinner, the desserts are amazing!  You must try the Lima Signature Dessert. My all time favorite!",5.0
Food is amazing! Staff are nice and funny! Sangria out if this world!! One thing I think the rice portions are a little small compared to like Pio pio! However the food is really great! Restaurant is always clean and it's a great atmosphere! I wish they delivered more!,5.0
"First review ever as a yelper but I felt I needed to do these guys justice.  Craved Peruvian late at night, found on yelp, traveled 30 minutes.  Arrived a little late in the night at 1030pm and welcomed immediately by the owner and son at the door.Ordered the white sangria, fried calamari app, and the combo #1.  Sangria comes in a large round glass serving and deceptively strong.  Sangria comes mixed with pineapples, oranges, and apples.  Just chatting with the owner he offered to let us try a smaller glass of red sangria.  Both are awesome, can't go wrong with either one.Fried calamari is a plate of heavenly fried goodness. Good sized portion.  Fried just crispy enough, reminds me a little of an onion ring crunch.  Not dry, or mushy like some others I've had.Whole rotisserie chicken cut into quarters for us.  Juicy, moist and succulent.  Doesn't taste like it was mass ordered from Costco;  don't get me wrong Costco chicken is delicious, but you don't want to come to eat at a Peruvian restaurant seasoned with Peruvian spices to have it taste like something you'd get from costco.  Sides comes with salad (freshly sliced tomatoes, cucumber, sliced avocado, carrots, celery, red cabbage, few other things with a homemade salad dressing almost like a light Italian), rice and beans, fried plantains, roasted corn kernels, fries&sausage, and that bomb green sauce (flavorful & packs a decent kick; apparently there was something spicier but we dared not to try it).Overall, great place to find.  Will definitely come back again.  The owner is very accommodating, very welcoming, food is great, drinks are worth every dollar.  Only complaint I would have is the music is very loud.  I left shouting still, but that could be the sangria working ;).",5.0
"Was here only once while was in the area. I'd say it's about 4 experience but I am rounding it up sort of thing. We ordered fried rice with chicken, empanadas and croquettes. Fried rice was good as well as croquettes. Empanadas were not hot just warm and I was not impressed with the taste. I think drizzled on top with ? balsamic vinegar. A little strange. Service was efficient. Place is casual , ambience is ok. Full bar. I'll visit again to get to try something else.",4.0

"My boyfriend and I came back to this lovely establishment a few days ago and we have had yet another excellent experience. The specials going on were Lomo or Pollo Saltado which is sautéed steak or chicken with rice and yuca fritas. It was amazing! We also had the empanadas, which are really different because they don't have meat; Instead, they have fig, cheese and I believe spinach inside-- absolutely delicious! Although we were stuffed, I purposely took him to get dessert here so we had to get it. We ordered the chocolate soufflé and it was INCREDIBLE! Amazing food yet again and Pedro is an excellent waiter.Very hospitable staff and excellent food.",5.0
"Came here to enjoy a classic Peruvian dinner and the establishment did not disappoint.  I enjoyed their steak, Peruvian salad, and got ripped from their awesome San Gria.  The owners are super cool as they hooked me up with multiple drinks through out the night.  The ambiance was just perfect as I felt as if I wasn't in Brooklyn anymore.I had to take one star off for the price as its a bit pricey but what do you expect from great food.  If in a mood for something different, definitely come check out this Peruvian oasis.",4.0
Great food but service is subpar at best.  I've ate here many times and have taken out.  All the menu items ate tasty and enjoy all the food at lima but everytime I think of the service I cringe.  For starters the times we ordered they have left out dishes which made me return to get it.  I mean when you order their combination it would be nice if they include the chicken that is the main part of the order.  Dine in or take out always takes forever.  Many times there are very few diners at the restaurant and it still take a while to get served.  The price is on the pricey side for the food and service provided.,3.0

"It's so refreshing to have a new restaurant like this in the area. The food here is EXCELLENT and there's absolutely nothing like it by Mill Basin/Marine Park.We had manchego croquettes (which were just fried cheese balls), empanadas, perfectly cooked tostones, salchipapas, and the delicious ceviche mixto. The ceviche was citrusy and light and not too spicy like we asked. We also shared the chaufa with chicken and shrimp which was a nice simple fried rice dish. The dishes came with a few different sauces that were also great: a spicy cilantro sauce, chipotle mayo, and a garlic sauce.The food alone would give it 5 stars, but I have to knock off a star because the service was very slow. We shared multiple appetizers instead of having individual entrees and would've been happy to receive a few at a time like we normally do at other places. Instead, we waited a long time to get it all at once. There were only 2 or 3 other tables when we went but we sat there with dessert menus for about 10 minutes before our server came back.I also could not bring myself to order a $12 dessert. This place is great, but to last in this neighborhood, they're really going to have to consider lowering prices.

"So i decided to try this place out, we placed the order on seamless about 5:45 pm got an email saying it will be ready by 6:15-6:20 my husband went to pick up food after apoligizing he did not get the food which was the chicken combo, they gave it to him at 7pm. I am a native peruvian and the chicken did not have the peruvian rotisserie taste to it  all it tasted more like a rotisserie chicken from a supermarket. Everything  else the salchipapa, maduros, rice and beans and salad were very generic. Overall, was not happy, they didnt do enough to justify the time they had us waiting and also owner was more concerned about chit chatting with customers there than actually coming up to my husband and trying to accommodate  him.",2.0

I would definitely go back to Lima!",4.0
"Guacamole is out of this world. Rotisserie chicken beats Manhattan's Pio Pio hands down (the one in Brooklyn is not so great). Sangria is very delicious (both white and red). Great food and service all around. Pedro the maitre d' is a great conversationalist, very passionate and knowledgeable about food. Highly recommended!",5.0
Went here for my moms 50th birthday and we had a great time ! The chicken lettuce wraps and sangria are to die for. We also had the skirt steak which was a little pricey. The atmosphere is nice just a little to tight for me. There was also someone who seemed to be the owner who was drinking with the customers which seemed a little off. Otherwise we will 100% be back for our next occasion.,4.0
"I want to start by saying that I am Peruvian, and I know how Peruvian food should taste like.This is what we ordered: Pisco sours were ok, nothing great. The chicha morada wasn't homemade. The ceviche was horrible. It didn't taste like Peruvian ceviche. There was something weird about the fish. The jalea was alright. It was 80% fried calamari though. Traditional Peruvian jalea is supposed to have everything. For the taste of the food, this place was overly priced!! I will not go back.",3.0
"Awesome little place tucked away in Mill Basin. My boyfriend and I hadn't meant to come here - we were going to hit up the sushi spot a few doors down when we decided on a whim to try this place instead. Glad we did! Everyone was so friendly and enthusiastic that we immediately felt welcome. We unfortunately couldn't stay and had to take our meal to go, but the ceviche mixto and the rotisserie chicken we ordered were PERFECT. My boyfriend and I were 'oohing' and 'aahing' all the way through the meal, and decided we definitely would be back. Fast forward a few weeks and we returned to have a sit-down meal there. Food was amazing again. Bit of a snafu with an ingredient I'd asked not to have in the dish, but the waiter realized without me even telling him when the dish was brought out. He apologized profusely and had them to do a quick remake, and all was well! Food was every bit as good as the first time we visited, and the service was warm, friendly, and prompt. Portions are good too - thought I'd explode! =)I'm a little cheap, so to me to food's a little pricier than I'd normally do, but still relatively inexpensive, and you're getting really great food. Will definitely be back!",4.0

"The other reviews are true, the chicken tastes much better than pio pio! The chicken peels right off the bone. Its well marinated through every fiber of that chicken and the skin isnt salty like other peruvian places. The sides were just ok, nothing to be crazy about.",5.0
"So i decided to try this place out, we placed the order on seamless about 5:45 pm got an email saying it will be ready by 6:15-6:20 my husband went to pick up food after apoligizing he did not get the food which was the chicken combo, they gave it to him at 7pm. I am a native peruvian and the chicken did not have the peruvian rotisserie taste to it  all it tasted more like a rotisserie chicken from a supermarket. Everything  else the salchipapa, maduros, rice and beans and salad were very generic. Overall, was not happy, they didnt do enough to justify the time they had us waiting and also owner was more concerned about chit chatting with customers there than actually coming up to my husband and trying to accommodate  him.",2.0
"What a wonderful experience for a last minute date! Went out with some friends and loved this restaurant, ambiance, food, drinks and waiter Pedro were all awesome! What made the night special was taking a shot with the wonderful owner!! You will not regret and well worth every penny",5.0
"We've been here 3 times.  One dinner, one lunch and takeout once.  It was all terrific. Yes it isn't cheap. But it is also a bit more more upscale Peruvian than some spots I've gone to in Bushwick.  And this isn't the heart of Bushwick.  It is Mill Basin.  Maybe this is Americanized Peruvian as one reviewer hinted at.  I don't care.  We loved it.  Food ignorance is bliss.  Everything is spiced well and we think the servings are generous.  Their verde sauce is creamy and just hot enough to make me sweat.  I also liked their habanero sauce.  We also suggest trying the white sangria.  Bonus, the staff is very attentive and welcoming.",4.0

"Good restaurants in this remote corner of Brooklyn are rare. But Lima is an outstanding find. The completely remodeled restaurant and kitchen is beautiful and unusual. The kitchen is surgery center immaculate and organized. Food is unique and delicious. Jalea (fried calamari and other seafood) seems to be the specialty. I've never had better tasting calamari, including some high end Italian and seafood places. It's covered with something like Mexican salsa and sliced onions. I recommend requesting some extra salsa or other ""juice"" because it's a bit dry. Sangria is the specialty and while I don't normally like it, I must admit that the taste was very nice and fresh. Fried Yucca root replaces and is better than french fried potato. Beans are excellent. Carlos, the owner and his staff are very friendly and helpful. They're eager to greet and know customers who like the schmoozing. Prices are reasonable. Very good experience.",4.0
"Disappointed. The menu didn't have many options. The food was okay but it took over an hour to get the main course, we ended up taking it to go instead.  The fries looked good but didn't really have flavor.  Sangria was very good and the half chicken was okay as well. The waiter, even though over confident, tried to be nice but was obviously overwhelmed with trying to serve about eight tables, 20 people with just a helper. The plates were never changed or the garbage taken away and the drinks were not re-filled or asked to be re-filled.  I heard good things about the place but my experience wasn't that positive overall, looking holistically:  food to service.",2.0

The service was slow but very pleasant.  I have to tell you, though, that it was a real turn-off when they told me they were giving me nothing and had no idea who I could have spoken to. So...we were already there and were seated, but we won't be back.  I don't appreciate them telling me one thing on the phone and another thing in person.  Really, some people aren't business-smart.",2.0
"Where do I start ... The place looks great ! But that's where it stops ! First off they have one guy running the front and waiting on tables ! For the prices the one guy running around should at least be dressed nice . Wearing a north face jacket answering phones, bartender, waiter, bus boy , etc... The place was freezing and when I told the guy he was like u should of told me , well let's see your  running around like a chicken without a head with a jacket on ... Hello ..... Then he is cleaning the booth hitting it with a towel likes he is dusting it hello people are eating ... Then he pushes the tray stand every time he delivers food really be a man and lift it up looks and sounds so unprofessional .... The menu is horrible ! It's whole chickens if u want a meal u basically order separately .... If it's a family style type of restaurant then the seating set up should not be mostly 2 chairs per table ...  The food was honestly more like a take out restaurant , nothing was great just average ..when your charging prices like they are plastic dishes and take out food style is just not my cup of tea ... I guess bc of the neighborhood being they hardly have restaurants  they  got these great reviews ... My overall impression way over priced , owner seems cheap turn on the heat, get a few workers , not one inexperienced guy running around ... I would not return or recommend unless you like freezing while eating over priced take out food ...",2.0

"Lima offers a tasteful cozy dining atmosphere. I dined once and was possibly the only non-related or non-Peruvian patron (which intimidated me). Had roasted chicken, rice and beans, avocado salad--all really nicely done (but then again, those are simple dishes). White Sangria was delicious, but service was spotty. Bill came to $50-$60 for two (entree shared, plus drinks). Will give it another go sometime in the future.",3.0
"The food at Lima is excellent. The menu isn't as large as the typical Peruvian restaurant you might find in Queens, but the quality is superior. Standards like papa a la huancaina, jalea, and chaufa were all fresh, well prepared, and appropriately portioned. The churrasco was also very tasty with a nice grilled flavor. The complementary sangria was delicious and the yuca frita had the right amount of crispiness. The aji verde (Peruvian green sauce) was outstanding...easily the best I have ever tasted in various Peruvian restaurants in New York and Lima. Also, if you like very spicy food, the rocoto puree packs both heat and flavor (ask for it!). In addition to delicious food, the service at Lima was very friendly and prompt, and the ambiance was tasteful and comfortable. The only word of caution is the price, which is a tad on the expensive side, especially for Peruvian food, which can often be very cheap. However, the quality of the food justifies the cost, although it could limit the frequency with which one dines at Lima. Nonetheless, if you want an excellent meal, Lima is recommended highly, especially if you have never had Peruvian food and want to try something new. Four stars for the overall experience, but if judged on the food alone, it might round up to five.",4.0

Since then, I've been here about 10 times and every time I order something new from the menu and am absolutely blown away at the creativeness of the dishes and flavors.
