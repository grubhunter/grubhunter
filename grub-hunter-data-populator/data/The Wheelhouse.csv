"My friend and I ended up eating at The Wheelhouse because the place we intended to go was packed, and we didn't feel like waiting. We're both vegetarians, and we figured a grilled cheese spot would be a chill place to accommodate our dietary restrictions. I'll start with the pros:- Our waitress was super friendly and helpful, guiding my friend in her build-your-own choices.- My friend enjoyed her sandwich of smoked Gouda, caramelized onions and arugula. They seemed to load up on the onions. - Chill ambience. Now the cons:- Neither of us were into their beer selection. I can't fault them for that since taste is subjective, but the two different beers we ordered tasted almost exactly the same and...off, somehow. - Two grilled cheese sandwiches and an order of tater tots took about 30 minutes to come out, which seems like an awfully long time but I'm sure they were busy so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ - My sandwich was honestly pathetic. I took a big risk because I wanted something not too greasy; I got goat cheese, arugula, red onion and added avocado for $2. They loaded up on the goat cheese--which was a little intense--but I counted maybe three leaves of arugula, four or five tiny slivers of red onion, and maybe two minuscule chunks of avocado on one side of the sandwich--the other didn't have any at all. I felt super ripped off paying $10 for what I ended up with. I would have complained but our waitress was busy juggling a bunch of other tables, so she didn't come back to check on us until we were finished eating and wanted the check. Also, I don't understand the tater tot hype from everyone else...they were just regular, fried from frozen tater tots with a tiny bit of Parmesan on top? Nothing special, probs not worth the $6 price tag. Wish we had tried the buffalo tots instead. Overall I wasn't happy with my meal, but I probably would have had a better experience ordering a more conventional grilled cheese.

For the price of the sandwich it was a real clusterf*** of meh. Mac n Cheese, was alright i guess but not worth the $8 dollar price tag. extra star becuase i did like the tots, and $5 happy hour glass of rose is a-ok. Sorry Wheelhouse but you were a real bummout.",2.0
"Just went for lunch. Food was good. Service was good.Morning Wood sandwich was spectacular. My friend didn't love the bread on his Buffalo Chicken sandwich but said overall the sandwich was tasty!

"I live around the corner from Wheelhouse and nothing makes me happier than fantastic grilled cheese whenever I want.  They are the ideal neighborhood spot.  However, I probably would not have taken time to write a review if it hadn't been for the issues they have had with Yelp.  I'm sure this review will get filtered out but I'd like to help replace any real 5 star reviews they lost.  I have worked in the industry and this is not the first nor sadly the last restaurant I have heard of that have had mysterious issues after telling Yelp they couldn't afford to advertise with them.  Restaurants can't ignore or leave Yelp when they're young because so many of us (and yes, I use it even though I think the system is rigged, I'm a hypocrite) use it as a directory these days.",5.0
$16 dollars for a braised short rib sandwich sounds crazy but it's worth the try. The meat is well seasoned and on top of that the ciabatta bread was amazing!Brussels sprouts on the appetizer was good as well.I didn't get to try the Nutella shake but my friend said it was amazing.,5.0
"My friend and I ended up eating at The Wheelhouse because the place we intended to go was packed, and we didn't feel like waiting. We're both vegetarians, and we figured a grilled cheese spot would be a chill place to accommodate our dietary restrictions. I'll start with the pros:- Our waitress was super friendly and helpful, guiding my friend in her build-your-own choices.- My friend enjoyed her sandwich of smoked Gouda, caramelized onions and arugula. They seemed to load up on the onions. - Chill ambience. Now the cons:- Neither of us were into their beer selection. I can't fault them for that since taste is subjective, but the two different beers we ordered tasted almost exactly the same and...off, somehow. - Two grilled cheese sandwiches and an order of tater tots took about 30 minutes to come out, which seems like an awfully long time but I'm sure they were busy so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ - My sandwich was honestly pathetic. I took a big risk because I wanted something not too greasy; I got goat cheese, arugula, red onion and added avocado for $2. They loaded up on the goat cheese--which was a little intense--but I counted maybe three leaves of arugula, four or five tiny slivers of red onion, and maybe two minuscule chunks of avocado on one side of the sandwich--the other didn't have any at all. I felt super ripped off paying $10 for what I ended up with. I would have complained but our waitress was busy juggling a bunch of other tables, so she didn't come back to check on us until we were finished eating and wanted the check. Also, I don't understand the tater tot hype from everyone else...they were just regular, fried from frozen tater tots with a tiny bit of Parmesan on top? Nothing special, probs not worth the $6 price tag. Wish we had tried the buffalo tots instead. Overall I wasn't happy with my meal, but I probably would have had a better experience ordering a more conventional grilled cheese. Still, it would be nice if they offered a vegetarian protein other than egg--veggie bacon would be a great addition to the menu to help the veg sandwiches feel more substantial.",3.0
"There is a lot to love about The Wheelhouse.  They're serving up some fierce food, in a warm and homey environment.  Wheelhouse is charming with it's wooden bar, brick walls, Americana art, and open kitchen.  It's worth noting that they only serve beer and wine, which pairs perfectly with the food they're serving.  I've had quite a few items off the menu...-Morning Wood - High quality bacon, egg, cheddar on crusty wholewheat bread. DELICIOUS!!-Braised Short-Rib - caramelized onions, gruyere, and blackberry jam combo is AMAZING!!-Bacon-Cheddar Burger Melt - This sandwich was extremely salty and greasy.  Not my thing.-Pepperoni Pizza Melt -  It tastes just like pizza.  My roommate who loves pizza swears by it. -Outcast - The cod is A+. If you want a wildcard choice...this is it!!  LOVE this sandwich!  -Tomato Soup - Thick, hearty, and great to dip your grilled cheese sandwich in!!-Tater Tots - Exactly what you'd expect tater tots to taste like.  -Crispy Fried Brussel Sprouts - GET THESE!!!  You won't regret it!  -Bananas Foster Milkshake - It's really really good!  This place is ALMOST 5 stars, but it lost a star because they're sandwich size isn't always consistent, and because one time I received a sandwich that wasn't fully cooked; meaning the cheese wasn't melted and the bread wasn't toasted, and I had a similar experience once with the brussel sprouts; not crispy.  I would have sent them back, but they were both on occasions when I got delivery.  For such a good restaurant I'd hope that they start taking more concern over what leaves their kitchen.  I'm ok with waiting a few minutes longer for a well-done order.  :)Wheelhouse - I love you, my friends love you, and I hope you continue to prosper and turn out that amazing comfort food you got there!",4.0

Og kush.  I was pretty high when we decided to eat at a grilled cheese restaurant.   This makes total sense.   Did you know hippies love grilled cheese sandwiches?   It is the perfect bait for a hippie trap.  In fact it trapped Meg's high ass fine self.,5.0
I was visiting friends in Brooklyn and ordered wheelhouse to be delivered after a night of heavy drinking and it was just what I needed. The spicy chicken sandwich was heavenly and the tomato soup was some of the best I ever had! But the real kicker was the tater tots. I'm a sucker for potatoes of any kind but the Rosemary on these really stole the show. Big fan of these tots. May have had a dream about them if I'm honest. Also - they have Boylan ginger ale and it was my first time experience this local New York ginger ale and it was deeeeelicious. Big fan!,4.0
"Me and big kev liked it here. Grilled cheese and tomato soup can hardly go wrong. I had the classic and his had bacon tomato and two cheeses...very good. I really liked the female bartender and she made a great Bloody Mary (could have used a pickle and less ice... She brought less ice next time) but the mix was good. Tomato soup was good too, but could be a littttttle thicker. Overall I enjoyed the vibe of this place and liked the interior, has a cozy cabin feel.",4.0
"I was skeptical about coming here due to the yelp consumer alert about the possibly fake reviews. I read a few good reviews from some elite members and decided to give it a try. How bad could they mess up a sandwich?We went on a Saturday afternoon for a quick lunch. It was a snowy, ugly day so it was pretty quiet. We were immediately greeted from a guy behind the bar who told us to ""make ourselves at home"". Nice touch.The menu is cool and unique. You check off your meal of choice with an erasable marker directly on the laminated menu.I got the Cuban sandwich with a side salad and a glass of rose. Both were delicious and the rose was chilled and tasty.Our waiter was friendly and the food came out quickly. I'll definitely be returning to try their brunch.",5.0
Best Tomato Soup I've ever had.  This place is delicious.  Get that liquor license so you can have a fantastic brunch!,4.0
"Wow, this place totally does not look like it belongs in this neighborhood at all! My sister and I planned to come here for lunch one weekday that I was off from work and she was visiting. I am SO glad we made the trek - it was really worth it! The interior is welcoming, rustic, and charming. The one man show, with a cook right in view was probably the only downside. It took awhile to get our food, and the server/bartender all in one definitely didn't want to be at work that afternoon because he didnt really have any patience with our questions about the menu. The ordering style is marking up a menu with an erasable marker and giving it to the server. You can make your own creation or order off their pre-made sandwich menu, which is full of amazing things besides just grilled cheeses. We got the Brussels Sprout and Tater Tots, both out of this world, the Iavarone, and a self- designed grilled cheese. The grilled cheeses were toasted and heated perfectly through with amazing flavor, even the crazy one we created. We enjoyed our meal a lot and the prices are decently affordable. It is definitely on our re-visit list!",4.0
"This is food that is made with serious love. Pat (one of the owners) and Joey (one of the bartenders) are the very definition of hospitality. I had the Turkinator, which was made with love. I should mention I went there on my 42nd birthday when all my plans were completely ruined. I was having the worst birthday of my life, these guys made it OK and I walked out of there with a big smile on my face. These guys take great pride in their work and are an asset to the neighborhood!!",5.0

I've tried 3 sandwiches: Cuban - not traditional but not bad - 3.5 stars. Turkey club - way better in a diner - 2 stars. Fried fish and cheddar - very greasy but surprisingly good - 4 stars. Place is ok. Rounding up to4 stars.,4.0

"A grilled cheese sandwich restaurant! What a brilliant idea... if you're targeting elementary school students. I'm a full grown man who has little time for nonsense, so when my wife suggested we eat at a grilled cheese place I spit out my gin & cod liver oil.  Reluctantly, I went to this dump and hated it. Hated the mustache wimp working the bar with his chest hair blowing in the fan breeze. Hated the beer selection. Hated the Mac and cheese and gross grilled cheese sandwich. Cool meal for a 6 year old. Were you out of lunchables and teddy grahams? Most of all I hated my wife for making me go there. We almost got a divorce.Mac and cheese and a grilled cheese with 2 beers and 2 glasses of wine should cost $20 for the drinks and 2 school lunch tickets... not $66 with tip.",1.0
"When I order a ""portobello"" sandwich I expect portobello in it. Nice big earthy, hearty portobello slices or caps as the ""meat"" of the sandwich.
