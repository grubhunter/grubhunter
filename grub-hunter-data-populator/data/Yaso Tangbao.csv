"I ordered delivery through Caviar from this place totally on a whim last weekend and I must say, this place completely hit the spot especially when hungover.  I ordered the meatball noodle soup, tomato soup and hot and sour soup (I was having a major soup craving).  The meatball noodle soup was amazing - broth was super tasty and not too salty and the meatballs were super tender and delicious; both also came in separate compartments to prevent sogginess.  The hot and sour soup was decent although I wouldn't way it was mind blowing. The tomato was delicious too, not your average tomato soup as it had potatoes and carrots in there which gave it a slight sweet taste to it.  The delivery took about an hour or so as promised on the app which wasn't bad, and the delivery man was super nice and handled the package with care.  Highly recommended, in fact I just ordered it again 20 mins ago and can't wait to indulge again.",5.0
"Stopped by when the restaurant first opened. On the positive side, dining area was clean, staff was courteous and there is a soda refill machine. On the negative side (and this is a big one for me), everything is expensive and overpriced. In addition portions are small. I did NOT get any of the dumplings which is what the place is known for.  I got the braised beef noodle soup. It was $11.50 before tax.  I got the order to stay. The noodle soup was generally OK - not the worst I ever had and definitely not the best. For 11.50 plus tax it was completely underwhelming. In addition, portion size was very small and was still hungry after. I would come back again to try the dumplings (which look expensive as well) but my first impression - expensive food (for what it is), average quality, clean space. Good luck to them.",2.0
"Nice place for lunch in MetroTech/downtown area. The décor and atmosphere is totally unexpected for a Chinese restaurant. The communal tables give you the feel of the cafeteria. The place was packed for lunch!I think I ordered somewhat expensive noodle on their menu which is Beef Noodle Soup (N1) for $11.50. We also ordered Yaso Pork Soup Dumplings and Sweet & Sour Pork Ribs. They all look appetizing. The presentation was spot on!I think the noodle soup needs a little more seasoning. Braised beef was a little dry. But overall, we were happy with our lunch. Will stop by to try other stuff in the menu.",3.0
"I had been to Yaso Tangbao on a few different occasions and came away vacillating between love and disappointment. Both times, I came for soup dumplings and ordered a few other things. On my first visit, I LOVED the soup dumplings but disliked the rubbery peanut noodles. On my second visit, I came just for the soup dumplings and was sorely disappointed. They were a bit dried out and the portions seemed to have shrunk.It was on a night that I missed my subway stop and decided to make the most of it by picking up some takeout that Yaso Tangbao finally blew me away. I got the braised beef noodle soup, schlepped on home and didn't expect much from my bag of goodies, but when I finally dug in - WOW. The pickled vegetables, star anise-tinged broth, flavorful braised beef, perfectly chewy noodles and fresh bok choy came together for a complex, multilayered and absolutely delicious dish. Away from the allure of those soup dumplings, it seems I am finally starting to understand Yaso Tangbao's genius. Can't wait to try everything else on the menu!",4.0
"Soup dumpling was one of my favorite dishes back in China and I always struggle to find a decent one that could bring back my memory back at home. Joe's Shanghai is close, but the soup base was a bit too greasy. Therefore when my friend recommended Yaso Tangbao to me, I knew instantaneously I need to try it out. I'm so glad I did!Even Though Yaso does not carry a long menu, each single dish I tried was hearty. Besides my personal favorite blue crab with pork soup dumplings, which were flavorful yet not too greasy; the garden veggie dumpling was a sweet surprise, as the chopped carrot was able to absorb the meat juice completely. Without hesitation, we ordered the sweet pumpkin cake - I could literally feel the coconut sprinkle falling out of my mouth! I simply wish I could eat more!Physically located in Brooklyn, Yaso can be reached by taking the subway conveniently. If you are a big fan of soup dumpling, Yaso hands down!",5.0
"I first heard of Yaso Tangbao from the New York City Dumpling Festival back in September 2015 and when I heard they were opening up just 1/2 block from where I used to work, I was excited! Yaso Tangbao isn't like other Shanghainese restaurants, but rather it is a counter-serve , fast-casual restaurant. An old colleague of mine tried it before I did because I decided to wait a week or so when it wasn't so crowded. I ended up coming here on a Friday afternoon for lunch with my boyfriend and boy was it crowded! There's a few communal tables along with beneches for you to sit and eat as well as smaller tables that are ideal for one person or two people and counters with seats. The service is pretty quick and the staff here are very friendly!We tried the following -Pork Xiao Long Bao ($8.50) - $8.50? That's quite expensive for the six golf ball sized dumplings we had, but at least the taste and quality was good. They were freshly made, each one squirting out a rich and savory broth with a chunky pork filling. It was absolutely delicious and went well with the soy and vinegar sauce. Chicken Curry Pan-Fried Noodles - This wasn't what we really expected it to be. The noodles were on point and very crunchy! The sauce and chicken on the other hand wasn't on point. There wasn't much taste to it and the sauce was so watered down. I don't think I would order this again.All in all, I am glad we tried Yaso Tangbao. The xiao long bao were phenomenal, but the chances of me returning here would be 50/50 only because the prices here are ridiculous and you don't really get a big portion out of the food you order. However, if your in the area this definitely a place worth checking out at least once or twice.",3.0
"The soup buns here are legit good. Pricey, but good. I guess that's the way this neighborhood is going but if you're itching for soup buns then Yaso Tangbao is probably as good as any place you can find in NYC.There's literally a small army of people visible when you walk into this place, working around the clock to make soup buns (I'm guessing). It's a pretty impressive operation and I'll have to come back and try the noodles and rice dishes. Check this place out!",4.0
"I absolutely LOVE this place!I finally tried this place after several colleagues have tried to get me to come here but I was almost positive I would hate it; I was wrong.I got the beef noodle bowl and I fell in love with their style of food. It's so fresh and tastes amazing! It is genuine Chinese food (""street shanghai"") and thats hard to find especially in this area. I want to come here again because I had a taste of their pork meatballs- MY FAVORITE. It didn't really taste like pork, which I rarely eat, and I look forward to having their meatball/rice/egg bowl. The quantity of food you get is worth the price. You will pay an average of about $13 for a bowl and will be full. I recommend this place to people in this area, the line always moves quickly!",5.0
"Yaso Tangbao serves authentic Shanghainese and has completely changed the Chinese food options in Downtown Brooklyn. You no longer need to hike to Chinatown to get your soup dumpling fix - just head to Lawrence St and the new shiny storefront on an otherwise not notable block.The crab and pork soup dumplings are perfect, with super super thin dough wraps, delectable soup on the inside, and hearty flavor. They are really good, since the chef is from Joe's Shanghai, you know they are better than legit. I've also had their pig ear salad (yummy chili oil), the crispy noodles with chicken curry (coconut curry tastiness), the Napa cabbage salad (sweet and sour and refreshing), and the pan fried pork buns, which are tasty, but not as good as the soup dumplings. The prices however are high relative to Chinatown - $7 for four crab dumplings, $9 for a plate of noodles.  Considering the really welcoming and nice fit out I think it's worth it to not go to Chinatown and deal with grimy restrooms and loud Cantonese shouting. Also, I think prices are fair relative to similar restaurants of other cuisines. I actually want to sit here and eat my noodle soup instead of take out!Hipster count here is very high, however, and I will be monitoring Yaso Tangbao for continued authenticity going forward!",4.0
"Great spot right off Fulton street. This place stands out amongst the dumpy other retail tenants on the street which makes me wonder why they chose this location, but regardless it's very good.The soup dumplings came out piping hot delivered with a special soup dumpling spoon.

I am so happy there is a decent noodle and dumpling place. I could just order 1000 dumplings and eat it all day. I love the Meatball noodle soup as well. The service is good and fast. I sometimes go after gym and probably it's like once a week.,5.0
"It's a great day when soup dumplings are that much closer to me, thanks to the addition of this Downtown Brooklyn dumpling spot. It's also worth noting that they sell a pretty good variety of other dishes, in case you hate dumplings, although what kind of person hates dumplings? Psycho.Went here for a late lunch after a long morning of jury duty. Even at 2pm this place was pretty busy, but cleared out shortly after I was seated. I ordered 4 crab and pork dumplings, 4 pork dumplings, and a hot and sour soup. The dumplings are definitely legit. They have that delicate, thin skin and the distinct shape (with that little twist at the top). Both types of dumplings were delicious, perfectly fragrant soup broth and just the right amount of tender, meaty filling. I found the crab and pork ones to be superior to the pork ones and would probably just go with those next time. The hot and sour soup had good ingredients, but the soup itself was too vinegary. Cut back on the vinegar and it's a perfectly decent soup.It's definitely quite pricey, especially compared to any of the joints in Chinatown, but you pay a premium for a nicer, cleaner, more sanitary atmosphere, better service, and more white people eating in this one dumpling place than all Chinatown places combined on any given night.",4.0
"Mmm soup dumplings. The dumplings were delicious and I liked that they gave you the appropriate utensils to eat them. They are a fun treat!Otherwise, I got the breaded chicken soup.

Great place to try in an area that is hotel/conference heavy and doesn't have the most exciting options. Solid 4 stars!",4.0
"Soup dumplings have come to Downtown Brooklyn, and seeing as how I live a very short walk away, this is dangerous to my health.

The xiao long bao (soup dumplings to you whiteys*) are on point, the mapo doufu (tofu to you whiteys) is delicious, if a bit salty, and the counter service is pretty friendly.I have a few minor complaints, but they are nothing that can't be fixed or overlooked in the face of delicious soup dumplings:1. The soup spoons provided are disposable, flimsy things. If we're eating here, why not provide some real spoons, and reduce some of the waste?**2. The soup spoons are also too small. They can't properly hold an entire dumpling, which led to my dominant female overlord (wife to you whiteys) clumsily losing some deliciousness onto the nice wooden tables. This is unforgivable, and I have since begun divorce proceedings. 3. The eggs on top of the mapo doufu were seriously overcooked. Keep the eggs runny, people. A runny egg makes everything better.4. There's no alcohol. There should always be alcohol. This includes the bar mitzvah I was forced to attend over the weekend.

Eveything is overpriced a bit.  I assume this is also due to the compostable bowl they use specifically, more expensive than the typical recyclable containers.

"I had such hopes for this place.  It took several weeks for us to get here as it opens at noon and is not open on Sundays.  Many times we're looking for a brunch/breakfast on Sunday so right off the bat, Yaso's hours are inconvenient.  We finally had cravings the same time they were open and found the place to be well designed with communal and smaller tables.  Its menu is appetizing and inviting touting Shanghainese street food.  We came for the soup dumplings, or as its name says ""tang bao"".  We got the crab and pork dumplings, braised beef noodles and cold noodles.  They were tasty but not extraordinary.  I didn't realize one order of dumplings was only 4 dumplings.  Most places have 6 or 8.  The prices are reasonable but the portions are small.  The cold noodles were hard and were obviously refrigerated.  The proper texture should be al dente but not hard from being in the fridge.  There was not much to the noodles, a few shreds of carrots, cucumber and a thin sesame sauce.  It hit the spot but nothing to write home about.  The beef noodle also lacked body.  The beef chunks were tasty and tender but the broth needed more substance and was more a consommé than a broth.  The dumplings were very good and without trying all the items, the tastiest and main attraction.  Not sure if it's worth all the trouble to find a parking space in the downtownBrooklyn area but it's a little pricey for only 4 pieces ($6.95). To be fair, we should try some other items before passing judgment.  If you're  expecting lunch or even dinner portions you'll be mildly disappointed. Think hip snack bar which are popular in Chinatown and a hangout for the after school crowd.  We went on a Saturday afternoon and the place was not busy at all.  It probably is a different scene on a weekday when the nearby schools, court and offices are abuzz.  Glad we got there to see what all the hype was after the NY Times article sang its praises but it's not that remarkable if you know the similar spots in Chinatown, Flushing or Sunset Park to get comparable quality and the portions would be larger and prices would be cheaper.",3.0
"Being on a poor student's budget in Manhattan, I'm not exactly surprised I had to come to Brooklyn to find affordable, but more importantly, delicious AUTHENTIC Shanghainese food. I decided to give the relatively new restaurant a go since I really wanted that home cooked feeling that I just don't have time for myself. Their xlb are excellent, with the soup just oozing out after you take the first bite. Not the best I've ever had since the skin could be a little thinner, but sooo good. The black vinegar and ginger came on the side, which was great for me since they were willing to give me extra, while the tourists next to me didn't even brave tasting it!I also tried the Braised Pork Meatballs w/ Egg over Rice. It sounds so weird to translate to English... (There's certain dishes in every culture that have nicknames that just don't make sense in any other language) My biggest gripe was that there was too much rice and lacked a yellow pickle, but the flavor of the Meatballs were so spot on! It was also quite large. Since everything in the bowl came in twos, I really feel like this could be a shared dish.Even though I ate in, there were only cardboard spoons and takeaway chopsticks, which I felt added to the authenticity of the meal.

"Being on a poor student's budget in Manhattan, I'm not exactly surprised I had to come to Brooklyn to find affordable, but more importantly, delicious AUTHENTIC Shanghainese food. I decided to give the relatively new restaurant a go since I really wanted that home cooked feeling that I just don't have time for myself. Their xlb are excellent, with the soup just oozing out after you take the first bite. Not the best I've ever had since the skin could be a little thinner, but sooo good. The black vinegar and ginger came on the side, which was great for me since they were willing to give me extra, while the tourists next to me didn't even brave tasting it!I also tried the Braised Pork Meatballs w/ Egg over Rice. It sounds so weird to translate to English... (There's certain dishes in every culture that have nicknames that just don't make sense in any other language) My biggest gripe was that there was too much rice and lacked a yellow pickle, but the flavor of the Meatballs were so spot on! It was also quite large. Since everything in the bowl came in twos, I really feel like this could be a shared dish.Even though I ate in, there were only cardboard spoons and takeaway chopsticks, which I felt added to the authenticity of the meal. I can understand how other people don't like it, but it feels like home.",4.0
"Not the most authentic, but definitely one of the best around the neighbor hood.The beat noodle was ok, but the volume did not reflect the price.The pork dumplings were really juicy, but was not hot enough and not as tasteful as I expected.Overall, super quick and convenient, and definitely gonna be on my dinner or lunch menu more often.But it is definitely overpriced compare to the places around.",4.0
"Soup dumplings fall into two camps for me - sweet or salty. These unfortunately were sweet and not what i'm used to / like. we had two of the bowl - mapo tofu & the meatball. The egg was solid, as in cardboard. Felt like it was cooked very early into the day and left to warm up when a customer ordered a bowl. For the price, would've expected them to cook the egg to order. with no other chinese spot around the area, this place is a needed refreshing meal. but, travel a bit further and you get much better food for better pricing.",3.0

"Waw. My mind was blown away... I can't believe I've been searching for some good old Shanghaiese pan-fried pork dumplings (Shen Jian Bao) in the US and I found them in Brooklyn/NY!!! I wish they could open one in San Francisco!!! It's $5-6 per portion with 4 buns. The bun's size and texture was just right, once u take the first bite, there is no super hot soup running out and burn your tongue, but a nice juicy pork filling with the right temperature. I love how they fried the bottom - it's not over cooked or burnt. It's crispy but not flaky. I enjoyed every single bite of it! Hao chi!!!",5.0
"My boyfriend and I stopped in here today craving late lunch on Christmas and in true tradition the one Asian spot in our walk, this Shanghai food restaurant was open. I had the N5 spicy pork noodle soup and my boyfriend had the N4 chicken noodle. Both came out piping hot in minutes. We loved them both with preference going to the pork noodle. A word to the wise the spicy pork soup is delicious but very much Asian spicy not American ""spicy"". I could see this spot becoming a cold weather favorite for my boyfriend and I. The clientele today I think really was primarily Jewish so I can't really speak to what the crowd normally is but we really enjoyed the casual vibe and delicious food here.We will be back.",5.0
The neighborhood is changing for the better.  This newly opened little gem just opened up and it's definitely a breath of fresh air.  This is a definite Chinatown style restaurant with more authentic food than you would get at the majority of places around town.  An added bonus for it being in downtown Brooklyn which has a bunch of Americanized places.You can get real soup dumplings here.  And I especially liked that they weren't completely loaded (i.e. no burning hot soup all over the place after biting)I also tried their veggies over pan fried noodles.  Also amazing.  This will be my go to place during the cold winter months since it's close to where I work.,5.0
"Yaso Tangbao offers authentic Shanghainese dishes at very reasonable prices.

Usually, i have to be super careful not to burn my tongue from eating soup dumplings too quickly, but this time it was just warm... ugh.  it let me eat it quicker/easier but took away flavor and experience. moreover, we were there at opening time, so they should have their freshest products!-sweet and sour ribs: this wwas really good. sauce was great. .meat on the ribs was tender and juicy. realllly good. -mapo tofu over rice: flavor-wise this was really good. but once again the tofu was mildly warm (but the rice was very hot)I don't know why their foods were so lukewarm. My guess is that the food isn't fresh and they just heated up something premade from last night which would be terrible... i'm hoping this isn't the issue. their prices are also pretty high for shanghainese food.

"After walking by this multiple times hoping for it to open (there's a severe lack of good Asian food in our immediate area, and definitely no xiao long bao within a 3 mile radius), we finally got to try it!We arrived a little after 7pm on a Monday night, and all the tables were full. We ordered the xiao long bao (soup dumplings), pork potstickers, the fried chicken fillet noodle soup and the pork mapo doufu. The cashiers were very friendly, and were taking orders on iPads - I really appreciate when establishments use modern technology. Service was quick, we barely had time to check out the very visible soup dumpling prep station of the kitchen and sit down, and they were calling our order number.Now for the food - being huge xiao long bao aficionados, we were impressed with Yaso Tangbao's version - very savory, fresh, and the wrapper wasn't too thick. We polished that off really quickly, and are thrilled that we don't need to make the trek to Chinatown anymore to get our fix! The pork mapo doufu with the two fried eggs on top was delicious and our next favorite. The fried chicken fillet noodle soup was a little weird but good. Unfortunately, we greatly disliked the pork potstickers - we could barely taste the pork, it tasted just like sticky rice. The xiao long bao and mapo doufu more than made up for it though!Overall, we are very impressed with the service, food, cleanliness, and will definitely be back. So happy to have this in our neighborhood!",4.0

"Finally! A place to get legit Chinese food without getting on a train. Not to mention the fact that soup dumplings are involved!My husband and I ordered 2 trays of crab/pork soup dumplings, fried pork buns, and the mapo tofu with egg over rice. All of them taste exactly how they should and comparable to what you could get in Chinatown! Soup dumplings are juicy and the skin is perfect. Mapo tofu is great but could benefit from having a runny egg vs. a fried egg wth hard yolk. The place itself is super clean and modern, can accommodate big groups, and the staff is young and friendly. There's even an all you can drink soda dispenser, which is sort of my weakness in life.The only drawback is that all dishes are 1.5 times the price of what they really should be (or I am accustom to paying for this type of food). Regardless, I'll be back!",5.0
"Comparable prices to Chinatown, definitely fills the hole of authentic chinese food in the area! Xiaolong bao are great, juicy, though just a little bit more skin at the top than I'm used to.

"After walking by this multiple times hoping for it to open (there's a severe lack of good Asian food in our immediate area, and definitely no xiao long bao within a 3 mile radius), we finally got to try it!We arrived a little after 7pm on a Monday night, and all the tables were full. We ordered the xiao long bao (soup dumplings), pork potstickers, the fried chicken fillet noodle soup and the pork mapo doufu. The cashiers were very friendly, and were taking orders on iPads - I really appreciate when establishments use modern technology. Service was quick, we barely had time to check out the very visible soup dumpling prep station of the kitchen and sit down, and they were calling our order number.Now for the food - being huge xiao long bao aficionados, we were impressed with Yaso Tangbao's version - very savory, fresh, and the wrapper wasn't too thick. We polished that off really quickly, and are thrilled that we don't need to make the trek to Chinatown anymore to get our fix! The pork mapo doufu with the two fried eggs on top was delicious and our next favorite. The fried chicken fillet noodle soup was a little weird but good. Unfortunately, we greatly disliked the pork potstickers - we could barely taste the pork, it tasted just like sticky rice. The xiao long bao and mapo doufu more than made up for it though!Overall, we are very impressed with the service, food, cleanliness, and will definitely be back. So happy to have this in our neighborhood!",4.0
"It does bring back some memory, but still not close to it. The diced pork noodle is not bad. The ribs were a little bit dry, disappoint on that.  Overall the place is nice, food is okay, will go back to try again. Hopefully will change my mind on the food.",3.0
"Finally! A place to get legit Chinese food without getting on a train. Not to mention the fact that soup dumplings are involved!My husband and I ordered 2 trays of crab/pork soup dumplings, fried pork buns, and the mapo tofu with egg over rice. All of them taste exactly how they should and comparable to what you could get in Chinatown! Soup dumplings are juicy and the skin is perfect. Mapo tofu is great but could benefit from having a runny egg vs. a fried egg wth hard yolk. The place itself is super clean and modern, can accommodate big groups, and the staff is young and friendly. There's even an all you can drink soda dispenser, which is sort of my weakness in life.The only drawback is that all dishes are 1.5 times the price of what they really should be (or I am accustom to paying for this type of food). Regardless, I'll be back!",5.0
"Comparable prices to Chinatown, definitely fills the hole of authentic chinese food in the area! Xiaolong bao are great, juicy, though just a little bit more skin at the top than I'm used to. Garlic cucumbers are nice, salty, and vinegary, (almost) just as good as the ones my shanghainese dad made at home!Update: just added the sweet and sour pork ribs and a bowl of rice to my lunch, ribs are great! Rice is, well, good ol' rice.",4.0

"So happy to be able to get soup dumplings in downtown Brooklyn. This place was solid and the prices are reasonable. There is a bit of a wait for food though, so be warned. I would say it's about 10-15 minutes. I had the crab and pork soup dumplings and the spicy pork noodle soup. Delicious and authentic!",4.0
"The place was bright, lots of room, clean, and a short walk from where I live. A good option for the neighborhood but a bit pricey for what it is. Here's what I had: Mapo tofu - lots of rice, lots of tofu and ground pork. The first few bites were fine. I asked for the egg fully cooked since I'm prego...the whites were foamy/crunchy, you know how it gets when the heat is too high? I also wish the flakes of red pepper were a bit smaller rather than the size of paper shreds, or that you could actually taste the spice (I added a bunch of sriracha to it). Pork soup dumplings - yummy. They come with the black vinegar and ginger which I put plenty of. The paper spoon it came with fit it just fine. But only 4 dumplings for like $5.95???? That's near highway robbery! There should be 6 at that price, sheesh!Pork buns - also good, but a little too much bun and not enough meat for my taste. Again - I piled on the sriracha (maybe my taste-buds are shot?)Chicken sauerkraut and rice - meh. It wasn't my favorite. I would go back to try other things. But I would DEFINITELY go back if their prices were a tad lower - at least for the dumplings!",3.0
"It's okay. Tastes like typical Chinese food you can get anywhere. The soup dumplings were really good though! Best if you eat inside and not to-go, since it will be cold really fast.

They were pretty yummy!!",3.0
"Haven't had the XLBs (but the chef is from Joe Shanghai's in Chinatown), but the braised meatballs are the best thing here. I'd eat these things all the time.

We tried nearly everything on the menu, it felt like! All of the dumplings are the perfect texture, the flavor is fresh and refined, the soup rich in flavor but light in overall consistency. I preferred the vegetarian and crab dumplings most. The lion's head was totally a surprise. I don't eat a ton of meat so I was apprehensive about trying this giant meatball but I could have lived on these, they are super flavorful and the consistency is smooth and transcendent.

"Compared to Flushing, this place is NOT it. But we are not in Flushing, this is Downtown Brooklyn so I can't get picky!XLB (Soup Dumplings)  - Quite tasty. Solid skin. Lots of soup. I would say better than Joe's. But they are no Nan Xiang or Din Tai Fung. I appreciate that they have the vinegar with ginger slices as dipping sauce and they have soup spoons big enough to hold the dumplings now!Pan Fried Pork Bao - Tasty bao. Crispy bottoms. VERY LITTLE meat.Sweet Pumpkin Pancakes - These were chewy - kinda like sweet potato flavored mochi? And I guess I liked them because I ate the whole thing before I realized it. Beef Braised Noodle Soup - Noodles were soggy. Beef and pickled mustard greens on top were tasty. Soup has NO depth. It really needs chili oil but they don't have any! For $11.50, I would rather pay $3.50 more and go to Ganso Ramen down the street and get a super delicious bowl of noodles.Crispy Curry Noodle - Noodles are crispy like their title says... but it's very meh. I feel like they added this dish for the wai guo ren.MaPo Tofu with Rice and Fried Egg - Egg is not runny. The ma po flavor is not there at all. A LOT of rice. Don't let that menu photo fool you! Spicy Cabbage Salad - Not spicy at all, but quite tasty! Nice to have a little pickled veggies and only $3.50.Garlic Cucumber Salad - This dish is ok. Def NOT worth $5. Would rather make my own at home.Hot Sauce - This place does not have chili oil.... only Sriracha which obvs is not Shanghainese. Sriracha goes surprisingly well with the pan fried pork baos tho!My recommendation for first time people - order off the ""Signatures"" or ""Bites"" section. Avoid the noodles and rice dishes if you are used to real Chinese food - those sections are for the wai guo ren.

The tomato soup has just enough sourness and sweetness and the meatballs were just over the top, so soft and juicy. Having tried couple other soup dumpling places in ny and Boston, i'd say Oh YEAH, this is prob one of my best experiences so far. If you'r ever craving for some yum Chinese quick bites, THIS is the place to go.",5.0

"Exactly what I wanted. The pan-fried pork baos were greasy and delicious. The mapo tofu was  good cold (except for the egg, but cold egg is my own fault) when I ate it a couple hours later. I would have gotten soup dumplings, but I couldn't eat there, and I did not trust myself to get them home in one piece. Great street food. Crossing my fingers that they someday deliver to Park Slope, but I seriously doubt it.",5.0

"I wanted to like this place I really did, I just had a horrific disagreement with the staff. My chicken was completely undercooked and the staff decided to fight me on the issue.

A Vegetarian ReviewVegetable Dumplings - Too much dough. Filling is tasteless. Why is there green food dye in the dumpling? It is a dark ugly green. You never seen a vegetable this color. Not appetizing. Cabbage - Well balanced flavor. TastyCucumber - Very garlicky. That I like. The problem it has no sweetness. U need sugar to bring out the flavor. That's what Shanghainese food is known for. Sugar bringing out the flavors.  Kao Fu (Wheat gluten) - Very enjoyable. A do-over. Lots of flavor.Garden Vegetable Crispy Noodle - I like it. Not the best I've had. Many better memories of this dish in some Cantonese restaurants.  but it is good enough to come back to Yaso  and order it again.Just want to mention that I believe these guys will improve there cooking. They listen to there customers tastes and keep trying to improve. It's a new restaurant and I got to give them a chance to get the kinks out. I'm glad to see the menu is vegetarian friendly.

"Delicious and authentic food. Slightly on the pricey side for the amount that you get, but a great addition to this neighborhood. I went there with my husband for dinner on a weeknight a couple of weeks ago and we tried an assortment of dishes including the crab soup dumplings, the ma pao dofu, garlic cucumber salad, and the room temperature chicken dish (forgot the name) - all was delicious. The atmosphere is modern and warm, and the community tables make for easy and comfortable seating even at crowded times. I would give it 5 stars if it weren't quite as pricey ($45 to feed the 2 of us with no alcohol) but it is definitely great to have a place like this in the neighborhood when you don't feel like taking the F train to Manhattan Chinatown.",4.0
Second time here. The place is in good decorations. I really like the soy milk and xiaolongbao here. Some traditional cold dishes are also delicious. The noodles and shengjianbao is just so so.

"Very impressive. The service was fast, the food delicious. I had a vegetarian crispy noodles dish. It took me a while to figure out what to order because this is not a regular Chinese food.

"We loved this spot!  Super fast service and addictive food!

"I've eaten most of the items on the menu.  Unfortunately there are no other real Chinese food options in this neighborhood which is why they can charge highway robbery prices.  The food is okay compared to the Chinese-American places in the area.  However, they are overcharging for tiny portions.  The good soup dumplings in Chinatown charge about $4.95 for 8 pieces.  Here they charge $5.35 for 4 pieces, more than double what you should pay!  I get that there are no other options but at least give 6 pieces just to be fair.Cucumber salad @ $5, complete rip off! They give only a few pieces, less than half of a small cucumber cut up and it was very over salted.  Wine chicken - again, the portion was tiny and over salted - steer clear from this.  Sweet & sour pork ribs - came in a tiny order of 4-5 small pieces, basically 2 normal ribs cut into half.  Noodles - I've had the beef and braised meat ball for $12.  Again, in a normal Chinese noodle shop, this bowl of noodles would have been much larger and about half the price.  The noodles tasted okay but one bowl isn't enough for an adult.  If you are going to charge $12, at least let the customer walk out feeling slightly full!  Noodles don't cost that much so adding 15-20% would make a big impact on whether someone is going to return to the place. Curry Crispy Noodle - the taste was very average, would not recommend, and portion is too small for one adult.  Mapo Tofu rice - the taste was okay, but again, for $10.00 I expected more food especially since it's mostly inexpensive tofu!  Definitely not enough to fill a person.  Basically between 3 adults, we had to spend $75 to feel full.  This seems like a rip off for a chipotle style chinese fast food place.  The food tastes okay and is pretty authentic but be prepared to spend about $20 pp in order to feel satisfied.  I am very disappointed since this is one of the few more authentic offerings in this neighborhood but they are too cheap to give a little more in order for their customers to walk out satisfied.  A few extra noodles, tofu, cucumber, or rice would not even affect their bottom line much but they are overcharging purely because they feel they can get away with it!  I like the food here but will not be returning until they tweak the portions to match the price or unless they drop the price to match their portion size.",2.0

Recyclable paper containers for takeout, very nice interior and everything is fresh. You can watch them making dumplings in the kitchen while you wait for your food. And the food... wow!

"I had the soup dumplings a couple weeks ago and then today I tried the braised pork meatballs over rice with eggs. The soup dumplings were very good, although I do feel like an order is pretty expensive compared to other places I've been in Flushing and Manhattan. The meatballs over rice with eggs were very good, and I splurged and got some of the chili oil (which I don't actually think should be an upcharge item) and it was delicious, although it brought my lunch cost to $14. The pork meatballs were perfectly cooked and flavorful. The eggs were a little overdone, but nothing to freak out about. Overall, I will visit again, as everything on the menu looks amazing, but this spot is too expensive for more than once a week. Check it out, it has great food and is very approachable for anyone not familiar with Chinese food (not me, but most of my coworkers).",5.0

"While I am normally wary of Chinese restaurants due to their use of MSG - and its consequential migraines - Yaso was a good surprise. The portions are very big and filling. Good quality meat. The chicken is clean cut chicken with no nerves. On different occasions, I've tried the chicken curry on rice and eggs, the pan fried buns, and the braised pork meat balls soup. All three were very good and filling. I also tried the soup dumplings for the first time; the eyes of the staff were on me, curious to see how I would handle the mission of eating these juicy treats. I ended up eating them with my bare hands. The soup dumplings were delicious and I provided free entertainment to the staff. They are tricky to eat with chopsticks, so I picked them up, bit the top off, and drank the broth off them. Then I popped the rest of the dumpling in my mouth. I'm pretty sure that's not how you eat them. They were amazing. You could split in half one order and feel just fine. The appetizers are conspicuous too, and they may make up a meal. It is reasonable priced. They do not serve tea or coffee...just soda and water. I like to take out because my house is very close and I do not feel like always drinking soda.Service is very nice and the menu is easy to navigate. They offer few items, but they are cooked great.",5.0

I hope the manager reads this and tells his staff to not leave the job early. Was so turned off will not go back to try it. Cutting corners isn't the way to do business in NYC. There's a million other places to try. Take note!",1.0
"I had the soup dumplings a couple weeks ago and then today I tried the braised pork meatballs over rice with eggs. The soup dumplings were very good, although I do feel like an order is pretty expensive compared to other places I've been in Flushing and Manhattan. The meatballs over rice with eggs were very good, and I splurged and got some of the chili oil (which I don't actually think should be an upcharge item) and it was delicious, although it brought my lunch cost to $14. The pork meatballs were perfectly cooked and flavorful. The eggs were a little overdone, but nothing to freak out about. Overall, I will visit again, as everything on the menu looks amazing, but this spot is too expensive for more than once a week. Check it out, it has great food and is very approachable for anyone not familiar with Chinese food (not me, but most of my coworkers).",5.0
Really great place. A change from the other restaurants around here. They should add restaurants like this around here. Up the place even more. Great service,5.0
The food here was very good and the staff very friendly! I really recommend this place!,5.0
"While I am normally wary of Chinese restaurants due to their use of MSG - and its consequential migraines - Yaso was a good surprise. The portions are very big and filling. Good quality meat. The chicken is clean cut chicken with no nerves. On different occasions, I've tried the chicken curry on rice and eggs, the pan fried buns, and the braised pork meat balls soup. All three were very good and filling. I also tried the soup dumplings for the first time; the eyes of the staff were on me, curious to see how I would handle the mission of eating these juicy treats. I ended up eating them with my bare hands. The soup dumplings were delicious and I provided free entertainment to the staff. They are tricky to eat with chopsticks, so I picked them up, bit the top off, and drank the broth off them. Then I popped the rest of the dumpling in my mouth. I'm pretty sure that's not how you eat them. They were amazing. You could split in half one order and feel just fine. The appetizers are conspicuous too, and they may make up a meal. It is reasonable priced. They do not serve tea or coffee...just soda and water. I like to take out because my house is very close and I do not feel like always drinking soda.Service is very nice and the menu is easy to navigate. They offer few items, but they are cooked great.",5.0
"Pretty good considering the neighborhood has very limited options for good Chinese food.  Shao Mai was weird, don't get it",4.0
"Truly an offbeat location, but the food is wonderful and apparently authentic. Soup dumplings the meatballs even the cucumber salad are all recommended.",5.0
The soup dumplings were amazing... which is why I tore through two orders just for me! The only item I didn't like was the soy milk soup... which was suggested to me as an alternative to tea.  Perhaps if I'd been expecting a chunky soup I would have enjoyed it?,5.0
"Very tasty and quick.  I ordered the spareribs, which were excellent--marbled with fat (but rendered down) and they had a sweet and tangy sauce.  I also ordered the cucumbers which were nice and briney.  Finaly I had the crispy noodles and vegetables--fresh bok choy, mushrooms, etc.  No hassling with Chinatown and the food here tasted very authentic having been to Shanghai a few times for work.",4.0
"I am a big fan of shanghainese food and really want to love this place but disappointed after my first try today. I waited about 5 minutes on line not knowing what they have until I got to the cashier and quickly read through a one page menu printed on a plain A4 paper. Their hot and sour soup is $4 served cold in a tiny paper bowl next to the cashier and it's $8 for 6 cold, non-juicy and easily break dumplings...I would rather take a one stop train ride to Chinatown.",2.0
nice solid shanghainese restaurant in an interesting location in downtown brooklyn. the soup dumplings are probably the best item on their menu and their noodles are pretty decent too. minor ding - the plastic chinese spoons detract from the experience of the dumplings a bit.,3.0
My friend sent me here she was raving about it I value her opinion so I turned up for lunch. I had 4 dumplings - and a small soup. Both dishes were okay nothing to rave about and expensive for what I got. My main problem was with the staff: snooty- I asked how big the various dishes were and what they were and neither of the two women I asked were helpful - it's as if I should know even though this restaurant has only been open for a few weeks - I felt like I was bothering them. I work on Willoughby and my co workers were excited when I came into the office with the bag but they were all unimpressed by what I revealed. Shame because Downtown Brooklyn's lunch choices are so boring this place could have been the light I was looking for. I was put off by the people behind the counter making the dumplings were not wearing gloves. I won't be back.,2.0
Staff very friendly once you place your order .. You do have to wait a few mins ..Great place to sit down and eat ... Had the blue crab and pork soup dumplings ( four which is a good size for me cost 6.95 ) the dumplings very tasty moist and juicy ..,5.0
This place is excellent. Fresh and delicious food with standard favorites and Shanghai specials. It's the real deal.,5.0
"The ribs were sweet and feel apart in my mouth.   A surprise find in the neighborhood, it's part of the creeping gentrification.",5.0
Great soup dumpling. I had mapo tofu- it came with a fried egg which was fried to death! So tough that I had hard time biting off. The hot and sour soup was too small in portion for $3.50 price tag. Loved the paper container. Will definitely eat again for lunch!!,4.0
"I work in the area, so how excited was I for these place to open.  Waited for a while for the crowds to die down. (I'm pretty sure it won't)( This place was a hole in the hole, I think Asian City.  I was jumping up and down when I saw the sign go up.  Shanghai Street Food.  Trumpets playing, Confetti in the air, hooray.  Finally got a taste,  didn't even bother to take pics, so excited.  One of my pet peeves, paying for bad food.  This was a huge disappointment.  I work a block away, dumplings was not even warm.  I was suspicious when they said food would be ready in 5 minutes.  But what do I know, I don't run a restaurant.  Crab/Pork dumplings - Costco frozen dumplings taste better than this.  How do you have dried dumplings, with no juice.  Isn't that why it's call soup dumplings.  Yes, I stand behind that statement.  Look at other Yelpers' pic, so small.  Don't get me wrong, it's edible, but 4 for $6.75, ever time after this, I'll walk down 2 short blocks and have Golden Fried Dumpling at 192 Duffield St.  Four dumplings for a dollar, 10 for 3.00 for boiled. They have so much more flavor.   Also got the Braised Beef noodle soup,  We were tasting the noodles, tasted like Ronzonni spaghetti,  Hey, Hey, that's what everyone at the office concluded.  So I'm not making this up to be a jerk.  Most of the pieces of beef that everyone had was extremely chewy, not in the good way.  The broth was missing everything, what you might asks? FLAVOR.   Another yelper wrote that the E. chef is from Joe Shanghai.  I find that extremely hard to believe, and if this is true, that's very unfortunate.  (Boss Man, no need to reply here, Y.T. will be successful regardless of my opinion.)",2.0
