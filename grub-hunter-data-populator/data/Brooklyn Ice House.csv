"Great spot to enjoy a beer and burger and hang out for a bit.  I came with a friend on a weekday evening in the summer, not too busy in the early evening, we had the outdoor area to ourselves.Good beer selection.  The food was very tasty and very reasonably priced.  The service was excellent, very friendly and prompt.  Great find.",5.0
"Nice place to get lunch with their $3PBR. Out door area could use a little organization but looks like it could be cozy at nite. The manager/chef notreally sure, was  quite pleasant and seems to enjoy what he does.Place only takes cash.",4.0
"Came to this local dive bar in red hook for a birthday party. The drinks are cheap ($5 for a pbr and shot), the vibe is friendly, and they have a free jar of candy! I ate way too many starburst and nerds. The seats are really springy and lumpy though - like an old unattended car seat that your dad took out of your childhood family minivan and forgot about in the garage. It's not often that I go to a bar and prefer to stand.",4.0
"Well-Being is a pulled pork sanwich. And tell me, folks what's much better than a menu with a pulled pork sandwich as well as features corn dogs and chips?!! Both were dee-lish. Not to mention the onion rings. Oh, I am going back all right! Next time instead of one sandwich, I am going with the waiter's recommendation of two. Take that, skeletal biatches! A complimentary picture of Jameson rounded out the meal perfectly.",4.0

"Even if Brooklyn Ice House didn't have such a big, beautiful back patio, I would still love it here. Because it is the best kind of dive bar. I hate dive bars where the bartenders try to be rabble-rousers and cheerleaders, cussing and cursing for no reason, posing, causing silly spectacles. This isn't that kind of place. They don't bother you, or speak down to you, yet they also do not ignore you. If you want something, just go to the bar and ask, easy simple uncomplicated, perfect. You can choose your own music at the juke box, and they never skip your track because it doesn't fit their mood, they let everyone's choices play, at a volume that is fun but doesn't drown conversation. And then there are the amazingly affordable beer & shot combinations! A few rounds of FIESTA (can of Tecate, shot of Tequila) is basically a dream come true when paired with their Pulled Pork Sliders ($6 for two) and their Chili Cheese Fries ($6 for a portion big enough to share).",5.0

"I really wanted to review this place!!! I just bought a bike and decided to ride it from Williamsburg to Red Hook !! Once arrive in Red Hook I was very thirsty. I checked on Yelp and find this place with only 1 $ sign. I was like "" perfect a cheap place, I just want a fresh beer"" I was very surprise with the very cool backyard. Staff is cool and finally I order some food! I was just impressed with the price of everything and then you realize that you are paying way too much in other places. Before I left I was happy to leave a good tip! WILL DEFINITELY COME BACK",5.0
"I mean I'm not sure why they have a high rating. I went there after being around the redhook area. The staff is really sweet, funny, and helpful. Just great.Things to know:1. Its a bar, not a restaurant. The inside is very dark and cozy.2. Don't go there to eat. I had there burger and fries and it was just way to oily and not a good quality burger. Definitely not worth it. 3. Its a nice place to hang out if you want to sit in there outdoor seating area and have a beer or a drink and some conversation. 4. Its a very ""chill"" spot and secluded. The inside gives you this ""divey bar"" feel while the outside has wooden benches and tables and a large canopy covering the center table.Wouldn't return for food. Would return just for a beer maybe not even that but definitely a good place to know.",2.0
"First off - we kinda jus dropped in on a Saturday night. We were in the area because we just came from a tour of Van Brunt Stillhouse Whiskey Distillery.They weren't packed, but we were a group of 16, and they don't take reservations - but without hesitation they met the challenge and did extremely well.The waiter built us a fire out back (April night - 40 degrees!), and he proceeded to take our orders. Everything was delicious (It's bar food, but you can tell they put love and care into it)...and it came out in record time. The bartender was amazing as well (Highly recommend the Moscow Mule), she even came out to tell us ghost stories around the fire!...and what really melted my heart was the Chef. After busting out orders for 16 people, he came out to say hi, see how everything was, and after over hearing me say I wish we had marshmallows...HE BROUGHT OUT A BOWL OF MARSHMALLOWS FOR US TO SHARE.I mean, I am not use to this is level of service and hospitality growing up in NYC. I am not use to even having a fire anywhere in NYC lol Even before we left, we all agreed how awesome it was, and that we would be back. All this, and the prices were very affordable. They deserve much praise for helping me pull off a memorable night for everyone. We will be back (possibly with more people, but I will call first haha)",5.0
Great bar and bar food. I loved the simple pulled pork sandwich. There was so much meat. I got a special - corn dog! So good. The Pilsner on tap was refreshing on a hot summer day. We also tried the frito pie which was like nachos but better. The wings were also great. It was super cheap too!Our waitress was really nice to us. She forgot our frito pie so she gave it to us for free. Very good service.I'm definitely going back here.,4.0
"We went here yesterday for 4th of July! And we were bot disappointed! We basically had 1 of everything because the menu is just too good!

Not to mention the Cheesy Pete's with bacon, though I swear I've had a hamburger patty in between both grilled cheeses once.. but I was extremely drunk so I can't say for certain.Or maybe it's just because it's that damn good.",5.0
"Absolutely adored this place. You see, I'm a pessimist. I like to think of myself as a pragmatist, but at this point I've seen too much, so let's just go with pessimist for the sake of brevity. I'll see something good, and immediately I'll think ""...alright, I'm ready for the letdown...""So I walked into this place and my expectations were low, even though I consulted my trusty Yelp and knew that others had really liked it. We weren't greeted by anyone, and just kinda sat in a nook. Some friendly patrons and the barkeep eventually told us that we had to order at the bar, and that it was CASH ONLY policy. They have an ATM on premises but the folks I was with were already annoyed (they're from California...)So we waited and played Jenga--they have a ton of games tucked away at a nice corner of the bar. Our food came out very quickly and we were all famished so we dug in...I had the grilled cheese with red pepper soup. Alex had a cheeseburger with fries and so did like two other people. Someone had onion rings. Someone else had the pulled pork.The grilled cheese was BOMB. And everyone else was mesmerized by their food--we went from a table of hooligans to a table of well mannered, hungry people in a matter of seconds. I was really pleasantly surprised. This place is bang for your buck, charming, and delicious. It appeals to everything I look for in a boyfriend....err, I mean bar. That was a bad joke. Okay, but you should still go here.",5.0
"This place is a little hidden gem that I came upon, from the outside its not someplace you would think had the best damn hot dog I've ever had! It looks like a old regular biker bar, small menu, in which you order from the counter. We took a seat in the huge backyard and waiting for what so many raved about...the piled pork and sweet potato fries. When the food came out and it first hit me mouth...oh my god delicious! The pulled pork you have to add your own BBQ sauce, which is fine with me, I'm a dipper. It was very flavorful! One of the best I've had. The sweet potato fries came with a sauce, mayo based which was awesome. But...the BEST PART of my entire lunch was the HOTDOG! Yeah a hotdog, who would have ever thought a dog can taste so good. It's wrapped in a perfect crispy back with melted cheese, and oh so juicy inside! The staff was also very friendly and I will be coming back! Especially for the DIRTY DOG!",5.0
"5 stars because:1. Super quick, prompt service. Our waitress was a bit surly at times, but considering how often she came out to check on us and bring us our drinks and food, I cannot complain at all. I was impressed at how efficient she was.2. Good selection of beers. If you like beer, you will have no problem finding one that you like.3. Decent food. I wouldn't say it was great, but it was edible and what you'd expect for the price. The pulled pork sandwich was a good value.4. Big patio area, ideal when the weather is good.Overall a solid place. Definitely would be happy to return, and glad my friend suggested we go here.",5.0

"This place is the perfect bar!Cheap deep fried food, cheap beer and with a hint of hipster to the side! My boyfriend and I did a day of just exploring red hook (Ikea isn't all what Red Hook has to offer). He wanted beer and I wanted a strip pork sandwich...then we stumbled upon this place. And could not have been more satisfied!",5.0

"This weekend we got a bunch of friends together to ""trek"" to Red Hook (and by trek, I mean we had varying routes of subways/buses/fine-I'll-just-take-a-car to get there). After going to a few other places, we ended up staying at Ice House for longer than we planned. For good reason!Although it had rained earlier in the day, the backyard was pleasant and we were able to grab some paper towels to dry off the seats. The servers were on. the. ball. We weren't the only large party there, but they were constantly circulating making sure everyone had drinks, food, and were generally satisfied. Seriously, everyone on staff this past Saturday was super helpful and incredibly efficient. Because I'd never been there before, I hadn't had the pleasure of partaking in $5 Tecate-and-tequila deals. Wait for it: that isn't even a happy hour special, you can get it all the darn time. The cluster of Tecate cans and shot glasses left in our wake was a good indication of how quickly we took advantage of it. On top of that, the onion rings were superb. Friends got french fries, wings, burgers and sandwiches, and everything was tasty (and delivered fairly quickly, considering the limited kitchen space).Great for a group, great for a few hours in the fresh Red Hook air, I'd recommend this ten times over if I could. Go there.",5.0
"Came here on Saturday with a few friends who live in the area and explained this was the best place for cheap, good beer and cheap, delicious food.  They were so right and I can't wait to come back.We hung out for a few hours in their spacious backyard.  Lots of tables for groups of friends to relax, enjoy one of their good draft beers and pig out on extremely affordable bbq.  The hotwings were delicious, with a spicy chili sauce.  I had a pulled pork slider, which was a lot larger than I anticipated.  Don't think I could have eaten 2 of them, unless I was super hungry.  Also ordered the frito pie (delicious) and chili fries (super delicious).  Everything was so cheap and the beer selection was solid.  Everything about Ice House is awesome.  The only thing I would change is probably the lightbulb in the bathroom, which is so dark I had trouble navigating.",5.0
"Brooklyn Ice House is as good as it gets. Awesome backyard outdoor area with tons of benches to hang out with friends. I honestly can't think of a better place to go on a Saturday afternoon with friends.Since you're in Red Hook, things are definitely going to be much cheaper than in other parts of the city. But the one thing that will keep me coming back is their Frito Pie, which is basically nachos made with fritos - topped with chili cheese and jalepenos. Seriously, my friends and I must have devoured 5 order of these.Their pulled pork sandwich, bacon wrapped hot dog, and burgers aren't half bad either. I can't wait to come back again the next time I'm in the hood.",5.0
"A very unassuming dive bar. Great place to hang out with friends. Cash only.We ended here after having done a birthday pub crawl around Red Hook. It's got good cheap eats, a decent beer list, and a laid-back vibe. I rather enjoy how their menu is pretty much your basic yummy-tasting junk food. Corn dogs, sweet potato fries, pulled pork sandwiches, and Frito pie! Where else can you get Frito pie? We enjoyed all of it, and I was pleasantly surprised by the fries. They are seriously good.The outside area is great now that it's finally started warming up. We've also come once in early afternoon and played Jenga. Ideal for a large group of friends, they have plenty of space and the bartenders don't seem to mind the crowd.",4.0

"4.5 stars...One of my all time favorite Brooklyn bars! The place has an AWESOME but small menu with items like: sweet potato fries, pulled pork sandwiches, burgers, hot dogs, and the like. Everything is very well priced except the wings which are oddly 2x what they should be ($6 for 6, should be $6 for 12), hopefully the owner (which is a really awesome guy) fixes this. The only menu item I've had that didn't meet or exceed expectations was the chili which was just like tomato sauce and ground beef. But they have the best sweet potato fries I've ever had and all of their food is incredibly fresh and homemade. I wouldn't call this place a ""BBQ"" place by any means so don't judge it by that standard. If the owner could also bring in desserts from nearby Baked, or Steves Key Lime Pies (or make his own) that would definitely be a plus. The beer selection is awesome and categorized by country.

"This is a 3.5 star place at best.  It's a cozy, well-weathered dive, but ultimately pretty basic.  Y'all waxing poetic about the beer list need to get out more - it's pretty standard ""good"" beer, with maybe one or two novel selections, but nothing exciting.  Prices are a notch more than they should be for some place slightly off the beaten path.I do appreciate the candy on the bar and all the tables though - a tiny Snickers is a sweet accompaniment to a glass of Duvel.",3.0

"Ice House has been my go-to spot since moving to Red Hook a few years ago. When all I want is some cold beer and delicious pulled pork sandwiches (2 for $5), this is where you'll find me. Their sweet potato fries come with a delicious spicy chipotle sauce, and are good enough to make me realize my hatred of sweet potato fries was totally unfounded. My boyfriend gets the veggie burger, which he says is decent, and I've recently become addicted to the Frito pie; Frito chips covered in cheese, chili and jalapenos. I was  surprised to see it on the menu at first, because it's more of a Southern/Southwestern dish, but it really took me back to visiting family in New Mexico. The beer selection is fairly big, random and decently priced. This summer I think I'm going to dive into the shot combo menu. The staff is usually pretty nice, but there is one guy who loves making smartass comments. One time I asked for a water (OMG) and he said ""We're all out, how about some water with hops."" Please. Better was the woman who let my friends and I smoke inside cause it was 3 AM on a Tuesday and we were pretty drunk. In the spring and summer they open their enormous backyard and let you drink, eat and smoke (only on one side) as long as you like. This is definitely NOT like a lot of Brooklyn bars you probably read about, where kids roam around like wild dogs. I'm lucky enough to have my own outdoor space but if I didn't I'd set up camp here and never leave.",5.0
"4.5 stars...One of my all time favorite Brooklyn bars! The place has an AWESOME but small menu with items like: sweet potato fries, pulled pork sandwiches, burgers, hot dogs, and the like. Everything is very well priced except the wings which are oddly 2x what they should be ($6 for 6, should be $6 for 12), hopefully the owner (which is a really awesome guy) fixes this. The only menu item I've had that didn't meet or exceed expectations was the chili which was just like tomato sauce and ground beef. But they have the best sweet potato fries I've ever had and all of their food is incredibly fresh and homemade. I wouldn't call this place a ""BBQ"" place by any means so don't judge it by that standard. If the owner could also bring in desserts from nearby Baked, or Steves Key Lime Pies (or make his own) that would definitely be a plus. The beer selection is awesome and categorized by country. The prices are the lowest you'll find anywhere! The best buy I think is the $3 Yuengling ($2 if you go to happy hour 12-8pm M-F). They have at least a dozen or so beers that are $3-4.

"I've only been here in the afternoon, but every time I've been it's been a relaxed affair where you could enjoy a decent, moderately-priced pint and sit outside in the backyard. This is a nice experience, and as someone else suggested, ""it's a 3.5 star place"". Yes to this.",4.0
"It's my local stop.  It's a blessing to live three stumble-able blocks from here.  Food is honest and genuinely good, everything is priced really fairly.  Great cast of real characters at any given moment.  Shot-and-a-beer caters to my inner stevedore.  Sometimes I almost use the phrase ""boilermaker"" when I'm here.Go here.  Support good people making an honest living doing something terrific.  But don't ruin it for the rest of us, ok?  If you're the type who takes your democratic freedom to yelp or tweet or ""like"" a little too seriously - and most of you know who you are - prepare for a chill spot with minimal amenities.  If you're already wondering what the bathrooms look like or whether your forks are metal or plastic...go somewhere else.",5.0
Went here after we left the Red Hook Winery and had lunch and a couple of beers. The pulled pork sandwich and chili cheese fries were very good. The beer selection is awesome and the prices are great too. A neighborhood fixture that everybody can have a good time in.,4.0
"Let me see if I can make this make sense to you:TWO excellent pulled pork sandwiches for FIVE dollars. This is cheap by midwestern standards. And good. And... why are you reading this? You should be on the B61, getting ready to buy some pulled pork sandwiches.If you're not ambitious, I guess I can keep telling you about how good this place is. It's small and dive-y, but it is Red Hook. That's a mark of distinction. The beer list is quite good, the bartenders are something like a combination of your parole officer and your dealer at the same time. There are games around, and literal BUCKETS of candy scattered throughout the place.Anywhere that has buckets of candy is a good spot.The sweet potato fries are pretty good, too. Not worth writing home about, but certainly worth a phone call. Last thing: there's a patio out back. Eat your pork sandwiches in peace.",5.0
"The Ice House is my go to bar when I am looking to spend a relaxing weekend day in Red Hook. The outdoor patio is perfect for enjoying a cold beer on a nice day. The staff here is always welcoming and the beer selection is top notch. I haven't eaten here yet, but the food always smells amazing (we usually stop here after brunch so I am full!) It's cash only, but the prices are super reasonable. Enjoy!",4.0

"Love love love this place. Stumbled across the Ice House one day when I took the free Ikea ferry from South Street Seaport to Redhook. The shot/beer combos are cheap and get the job done. Plus, suprisingly, the food selection is delicious.  The ""Cheesey Petes"" - aka grilled cheese sandwiches over fries -- are amazing. Also, they serve their beers in beer cozies, which is a nice touch. Great outdoor space, and really cool laid back non-Williamsburg-Brooklyn vibe.

We drank reasonably priced good beer!We ate sweet potata fries!We played Connect 4!And the music was good!So were the other people!Except for that creepy couple that tried to guess how many at our table were Jews!They were wrong anyway!Great night!,5.0
LOVE this place. My office is in Red Hook so we frequently stop in for lunch or a drink after work. The food is awesome (you have to try the pulled pork!) and the beers are pretty good too although I often opt for the Stevedore (PBR and a shot of whiskey). The bartenders are friendly and serve a mostly Red Hook crowd. Definitely looking forward to drinking a few in their backyard this summer!,5.0
"Not usually a destination spot but my boyfriend and I find ourselves coming here often.  You can't beat a cool dive bar with laid back people and generally a really good selection of music playing, although I've never put money in the jukebox.  The bloody marys are perfect (something Brooklyn can never seem to get right) and the beer selections are always great and inexpensive.  The sliders are like something out of a crock pot and onto the bun but they put something addicting in them and as much as I try not to eat pork I love them.  Glad to see the last time I was there they had chicken sliders but I wasn't hungry enough to try.  Hopefully they will have them next time!  And SO cheap. I saw a mesclun salad on the chalk board but when I'm here I want the grub! They also have complimentary pretzels and Hershey's kisses at the bar if you like.  Why doesn't EVERY bar do this?!The tv is never too loud.  And in the back you can play Buck Hunter even though you might be in the way of someone that works there trying to get in the area behind it for supplies it's still so laid back and chill.  My only complaint is that the cool vintage red vinyl booths need the seats refinished badly.  They could do this and still maintain the original backs I would think.  Preserve this place!",4.0

Yum!The mesclun salad was impressively fresh and the lentil soup with kielbasa was passable (not bad, not great).  Veggie burgers are available.4 amazing sliders, the salad, the soup, a draught beer and a generously strong hot toddy ran us a mere $33 + tip.

"if you type in ""pulled pork sandwiches in NYC"" in the yelp search box, Brooklyn Ice House is the first thing that pops up.  So naturally, a fan of pulled pork sandwiches as I am,  i IMMEDIATELY gravitated towards this quaint bar.  Yelp, you did not dissappoint me in any sense of the word!  On my food pilgrimage to the Big Apple, I found myself taking a shady route to the nerdiest bar I've ever been to--let me tell you: it was worth risking my safety!  You come here for the food and the amazingly priced adult beverages but what you don't expect is to meet a boy with a waffle-iron and a tip to find the best waffles on the United States.  It's probably a good thing i live in Los Angeles, otherwise i'd be fat(ter) from eating the pulled pork sandwiches and drinking beer every day.  p.s. if you were that boy with the waffle iron, you were pretty cool but your friend was really hot.  so, email me?  haha.",5.0
"What a gem!  Offers a ""familiar"" vibe indoors along with a mellow beer garden in the back courtyard.  Fair prices, cold beer, friendly staff, affable fellow patrons - try the simple yet savory pulled pork sammiches.",5.0
"along with bait & tackle you have two real solid bars right next to each other.  this place is cheap looking but the atmosphere is solid.  its kind of like a black hole. i've been three times and every time i went in with the intention of one beer and maybe some wings, then stayed for hours.  just wished they'd mix up their drink specials, b/c i'm getting soooo sick of drinking PBRs everywhere haha",4.0
"Great food, beer/liquor selection, a backyard and friendly staff. This place is definitely everything I need and more! Pulled pork sandwiches + sweet potato fries = Heaven. And I also love the Stevedore special for $4.",5.0

"The place is fucking perfect.  It's got character, it's just the right size, Big Buck Hunter, the perfect menu, and you can drink for pretty damn cheap.  And it's right next to Bait and Tackle, in case you want to go play pinball for a while (which I do).",5.0
"the first time i came here, it was the day before my birthday. and if memory serves me correctly, i had a good time.the next time i came here was last week on a coolish labor day weekend sunday. my friend and i had a couple beers, split the 2 for $5 pulled pork sandwich and had a nice little time.i really really like red hook, and seem to always NEED a reason to go down there. i think brooklyn ice house is a good reason.",4.0

"Waiting for you to open the back patio...........buuuueller..............buuuuuelle­r.......FINALLY, SOMETHING HAS OPENED TO REPLACE my favorite place, the PIONEER. This is a much cleaner, less smelly pioneer, but with new owners and a dumb name.they have yum 2 for $5 pulled pork sandwiches served LATE and a good beer selection served in nice glasses served by nice bartenders. Imagine that?. :: i'm fancy now. :: i do worry about their destiny due to the fact that i haven't seen any locals working the bar but i think if they treat the old regulars right, are friendly to their neighbors - wink- and stay strong, they'll do alright.please hurry with the backyard thing.",5.0

"I am mostly unfamiliar with Red Hook Fun Time, so when my friends and I wandered on in to the nabe from the IKEA water taxi, needless to say we were a little (coughlostcough) disoriented. So we stopped at the fire station and asked a (very handsome, I might add*) firefighter where we could get a drink and he pointed us up Van Brunt Street. In short: score one for Brooklyn Ice House. We walked in and were immediately greeted. I see here that it must have been Trevor who served us -- and it's not hyperbole to say he was one of the nicest bartenders (and, as I see now, owners) I've ever encountered EVER. So totally accommodating despite our indecision. (I would give the place five stars, but there were some REALLY loud kids running around.) And on the music tip? T. Rex to the Statler Brothers. Beat that.* what?",4.0
"We stopped by here after going to Ikea in Brooklyn because we think Anthony Bourdain did a show at this bar.   Its looks like any old bar in Brooklyn.  After we sat down, I started to question if the food was going to be any good because it was a bar and it was really small.  I asked the bar tender for a menu which was a sheet of paper with a very limited menu. I had the pull pork sandwiches and the chili cheese fries.  The pulled pork sandwiches were good, but the chili cheese fries were amazing.  I think it was the best chili cheese fries I ever had and it was like only $5.  The chili was not a typical chili.  It was a meat chili with no sauce and beans.  I liked it.If you are ever around the red hook area and looking for a beer and snack, you should definitely stop by.",4.0
"It doesn't get any better on Van Brunt. The staff is very friendly, the drinks are cheap, and they have a seriously awesome BBQ menu. The pulled pork will always have a place in my heart, but the real stars are the sweet potato fries and the chili-cheese fries, which should come with a defibrillator and life insurance. Add to the mix free pretzels and candy, great board games (go Boggle!), pinball, and a backyard that's easily one of the top three in the city. It's a better version of the Levee.",5.0

"The Pioneer will always be near and dear to my heart, but the Brooklyn Ice House has definitely been successful and filling the shoes. We can start with the owners - awesome people. Very involved with the bar, and really friendly and inviting to anyone who comes in. The staff - also great folks. Red Hook locals (don't let that scare you - these are the nice locals!) who are good with pours and the by backs. Food - awesome bar fare. Especially the specials, and especially when it's Rachel in the kitchen. (She makes an amazing Cuban sammich.) The pulled pork is the aroma (and how you're probably smell after you leave), and is mighty tasty. Great sweet tater fries and onion rings. Burgers are pretty damn good, too. The bar - fully stocked, with all the usual plus some extra really great whiskeys. Dozens of beers to choose from. All of it with really good prices, especially during happy hour. Atmosphere - it can go from quiet and relaxing to loud and crazy, depending on the time, the people and if there's an event on the tele. Indoors it's quaint, just a few tables lining a wall, and a bar stretching across the room. They have pin ball and electric critter killer machines in the back, board games in the front, and usually have some sort of lil pretzels and chocolates treats on the bar... you know, the little touches. All the Ice House is really missing is a ping pong table - which we haven't been able to talk em into... yet.",5.0
