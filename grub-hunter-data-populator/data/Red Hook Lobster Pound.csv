Mmmmm I love this place for lobster rolls. I had my first one from their stand near the Macy's flagship store. Then I had another at their stand at Smorgasburg. So I had to visit the restaurant when I was craving a lobster roll. Maine Lobster Roll is awesome if you like the classic mayo version. Connecticut Lobster Roll is awesome if you like the warm butter. The staff here is very friendly. The food is to die for. It's definitely one of my favs. So happy they opened another location in the city.,5.0
Been here for take out a couple times and have visited their Brooklyn flea locations. This was my first time eating in and it was as good as I hoped. Good chowderSame quality NE lobster rolls to their food stands . Which is a positive Good cocktails at reasonable pricesYummy $1 oysters 4-7pm,4.0
"The was a very nice find after my MOH and I went to another location. We were in search of someplace to eat after a failed attempt at another restaurant. I am happy that I had this place bookmarked. Once we stepped inside, it was nicely decorated. The hostess was very friendly. We were seated at our table ( which for me was a little too close to each other but I managed ). On the table there are placemat menus (cute) a tin pail with a drink menu and napkins. Our waitress brought us over a carafe of water we could pour ourselves. All the food all looks so delicious which made it difficult to choose. I ended up ordering a lobster cob salad and she ordered the lobster cheese fries. We decided to split a Connecticut lobster roll no sides.I enjoyed my salad with the exception of the Bleu cheese crumbles. Not a big fan and it quickly can overpower the taste of any dish. She enjoyed her fries but it was in need of a little black pepper. We were full at that point so took the roll to go. I also ordered a lemonade which was quite refreshing.",4.0
I'll start off this review by saying another point for Brooklyn this place has some of the best customer service i've ever came across A+. As for the food The lobster was fresh wasn't over season or drowned by any unwanted mayonnaises or oils The bread was lightly toasted on one side soft on the other as for the portion of the lobster as you can see in the pictures you'll definitely get your moneys worth. So from me to you I definitely would go check them out the Best lobster in the five boroughs. Side bar the bartender with the Greyeyes WOW she is gorgeous,5.0
"Juicy lobster with cute sea decor from a ship.  Red Hook Lobster Pound was a pit stop for my friends and I when we finished the Raaka chocolate tour.  We were going to have a heavy dinner later so we decided to only have a light lunch as almost a snack.  My friend ordered their Connecticut lobster roll that has a quarter pound of lobster meat with warm butter.  This was the one roll that is served warm.  The other rolls are cold.  I also really wanted some shrimp so o decided to get the peel and eat shrimp which was shrimps on the shell that has been sautéed with old bay seasoning, a salt with paprika I believe.  The lobster roll was full of meat and so buttery and well seasoned.  Bread for the roll was hefty, but not dense and it was grilled so it had a nice crunch.  Peel and eat shrimp was grilled perfectly, not rubbery or burnt.  But it was a little salty though.Service was adequate-- we were seated right when we entered the restaurant but the waitress did at one point forget to give my friend her cocktail.  However, other than that, service went efficiently.I definitely think their lobster rolls are pretty delicious and while they are a bit pricey, it's very worth it.  If you find yourself in the industrial part of Brooklyn, go check out this cool little lobster restaurant.",4.0
I hate that they made this place a restaurant. Before I would walk in and within 10 min walk out with a lobster roll. The other day I came in and they told me that I had to order at the bar which I did but then I waited about 30 min for 2 lobster rolls which is not ok. I'm paying $40 for 2 lobster rolls and I have to wait 30 min? Not cool. They get 3 stars just because the rolls are delicious.,3.0
"Was here this past weekend for lunch. Got the classic Maine lobster roll, cobbster salad, clam chowder, and a side of sweet potato fries. This was for two people. Did not realize portion sizes here are ridiculous! So much food! Clam chowder has a lemony tang to it which I wasn't expecting and it was not as warm as I usually prefer soup, but still very tasty. Service was a bit slow though even though there weren't too many diners.. Otherwise overall positive experienc. All other food was delicious!",4.0
"I love Red Hook Lobster Pound. Lobster is my favorite food - and there is very little I wouldn't do for a delicious lobster roll. While this location is slightly off the beaten path, the B61 bus will drop you off literally across the street. And in the spring/summer, the walk helps me substantiate ordering more lobster. I love the Connecticut roll - luscious warm lobster draped in butter on a roll. When I'm at the restaurant though, I'll order the steamed lobster dinner. Deliciously steamed to perfection, the sweet meat is accompanied by fresh corn, some potatoes (kind of dry but I guess they are potatoes...) and coleslaw. The service is excellent - and so happy to see this local business thrive. Highly recommend for a casual but special dinner treat, or for gorging on lobster rolls at any given time.",5.0
It was a cool spot for lunch. Me & my good friend enjoyed the Connecticut Lobster Roll which was recommended by our waitress. The rolls were good. No complaints! More then enough lobster on there. The fries were delicious. Well seasoned. No salt needed. For drinks we ordered the sea breeze margarita & drunken cherry lemonade which was good. Our bartender made sure we tasted our liquor for sure! For dessert we ordered the funnel cake without the blueberry compote & vanilla ice cream on the side. It was quite oily & over cooked. Was not impressed with it what so ever. Definitely not worth it. The staff was pleasant. Very well mannered & friendly. Shout out to their new waitress in training Emily who was just sweet & quite attentive,3.0
"My boyfriend and I stopped here on our way to the horror that is Ikea since we had a car and wanted to make the most out of the schlep to Red Hook. We sat at the bar and were greeted by a very friendly bartender. I splurged on the Lobster Claw Bloody Mary, it is pricey but that is to be expected for a drink with crustacean parts hanging out of it. It was really good. Treat yo' self and get one. I had the chowder and the amount of clams in it was impressive. My chowder snob Maine squeeze (patting myself on the back for my clever New England pun) approved, which should be taken as the highest compliment since he is from ... Maine. We split the lobster mac and cheese. I never order it in restaurants because it is always disappointing, but I had a feeling it would be great. I was right. It is perfect and there is a lot of lobster in it. It's a seafood restaurant so it isn't cheap, but it is really good.",4.0

"""This is the lobster roll of my dreams"" I proclaimed with meat hanging from my mouth. I really loathe mayonnaise. It is rarely good. Here you can order a Connecticut style lobster roll without mayo!!! Just a lil lemon and butter and you *actually* taste the meat. Better than any roll I've had in New England for sure (I was subjected to those parts due to grad school). What I LOVED:1) Connecticut style lobster roll: Just. Do. It. This show stopper led her team and singlehandedly won the 5 star approval rating. What I LIKED:1) Sweet potato fries: Good and fresh. 2) Coleslaw (jaw drop, I know): How was this possible?? It had cumin, rye, herbs and did not seem to have mayo.  Slaw usually goes straight to the trash or spouses plate. Not today. What was OK, and would not get again:1) lobster claw Bloody Mary: the lobster was the best part. Besides that it wasn't spicy enough (even though I asked for EXTRA spicy), lacked a nuanced flavor and tasted like tomato juice w a dash of Worcestershire. Didn't hold a candle to The Mermaid Inn or Joseph Leonard. 2) lobster mac & cheese: Spouse enjoyed this more than I. But this is MY review. It was fine. I picked out the lobster chunks. The cheese was a bit bland - nothing spectacular. 3) the lobster roll meal vs the lobster roll alone: I did not like their pickles (they are sweet). The slaw and fries were good but I didn't need them. Next time I'll just order the lobster roll solo.I believe this is the first time ever that I am highly recommending something with ""Connecticut"" in the title...",5.0
"Red Hook Lobster Pound serves up a mighty tasty Connecticut style lobster roll. They provide big chunks of meat. The meat is super tasty but could use a little more seasoning. May be some old bay or at least a little more salt. Although there was supposed to be lemon I didn't get an actual lemon wedge nor did I detect any lemon splashed on the meat. It's kind of annoying that all the tables don't already have all the necessary condiments on them and you have to ask for them every time. It definitely slows down your eating process. First I had to ask for salt, and then I realized I need ketchup for my fries too as they sat there and got cold. The coleslaw is a little bland but the pickle was good. Our waitress was nice but it seemed like we got ""the new girl"" when explaining the drinks to us she got confused and asked us if we just wanted to see the drink list. Which mind you was also not provided on the table and she had to go get one. They would be doing a lot less works and walking around in circles if the tables were well prepared from the get go. When we asked a question about one of the drinks she did her best to answer but ended her response with ""or something like that"" um what is that supposed to mean? She was just overall unsure and not very knowledgeable. Another waiter tripped over one of the legs of my chair and almost dropped someone else's food. The tables are a bit too close together and feel cramped. The water they provide to the tables is warm and the glasses they bring don't have any ice. On a hot sunny day this did very little to cool us down when we arrived. The restaurant itself also isn't very cool either. I ordered a cobbler which is vodka, cranberry, and a concoction of a few other things. I found it very sweet and could not detect much liquor. Check out the circular bathroom that is gigantic for no reason at all. The décor is really funky and is surrounded by fun house mirrors. You could literally have a little party in there.

"Fresh delicious lobster rolls. Their Maine was well prepared with a good blend of mayo and not too cream heavy or too tangy. The Connecticut was warm and buttery but not too oily. A well balanced toasted bun makes a lobster roll from just good to being great. Large chunk of lobster meat and not too messy when handling the roll. The clam chowder was a tad bit saltier than I normally have it but my family seems to like it just fine. The area isn't bad but it's hard to travel here by means of public transportation.  The seating inside was larger than expected. I like their buckets of utensils and wet naps already set for your use. The bench seating isn't bad but I was sitting on a loose bench which kept rocking back and forth. It's not an issue if I sat alone, but when there are two or more people on one bench, expect for a wobbly ride.",4.0

"I was in Brooklyn for a work event  and was looking for a great place with seafood on the menu. Red hook lobster was recommended, and I am glad it was! This is not your typical fancy seafood restaurant. You enter in to a small building where you place your order with a cashier and then exit this building to re enter the building next door to wait for your order.I ordered a full lobster, and you get the opportunity to pick out the lobster you want straight from their saltwater lobster tanks. Great size ( 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 pounders from Maine) Also got a few side dishes to share. lobster mac and cheese and coleslaw.Surprised they didn't offer alcohol beverages, but the friendly cashier gave us directions where we could go purchase alcoholic drinks and bring them back to enjoy with our meals.By the time we came back and enter the second building that is a picnic table set up, our food was delivered.Lobster was so fresh and  melted in your mouth. The lobster mac and cheese was so creamy and blended perfectly with the lobster.HoursMonday: ClosedTuesday-Thursday: 11:30am-9pmFriday-Saturday: 11:30am-10pmSunday: 11:30am-9pmI have heard this location has been renovated/remolded and now serves alcohol. I look forward to returning to see the changes.",4.0
"Came here around noon over the weekend with a group of 3. Had no issues getting a seat. Hostess was friendly and we sat at one of the picnic tables setup. We shared the table with another party of 3. One of the waiters was kind enough to bring my friend a chair so he didn't have to sit at the edge of the bench. I decided to come here because NY Eater highly recommended their burger in addition to their lobster roll. I am a big fan of Luke's lobster so I felt obligated to try one of their competitors.For starters, we ordered the lobster mac and cheese.Nothing to write home about the mac and cheese. Nothing special with the cheese used. The top layer of the cheese wasn't a little crispy. The dish was basically just lobster thrown into the bottom and mac and cheese on top. I thought it would have been something different. Some parts of the dish still felt a little ""grainy"" (not from the lobster, but from the cheese). There bits and pieces of lobster in it but a dish as a whole, it wasn't impressive and I would not recommend it.For main course, we ordered the Hook Burger, Connecticut Lobster Roll, and Maine Lobster Roll. I actually liked the hook burger. It was seasoned well and used nice small pieces of pepper. You can actually taste a difference. Parts of the burger did come medium rare but about a 1/3 of the burger was medium. I may be wrong about this, the burger was juicy but it seemed there was some water content in it. It didn't taste like fat, but maybe I wasn't paying close enough attention. The buns were toasted but the side that was in contact with the tomato and lettuce, it was soggy. I would recommend them just putting it on the side and the customers can add it in. The fries were good. The pickle seemed a little strange to me. It was a little ""soggy"". It didn't have that nice crunch to it. Not sure if it's the style of this particular manufacturing company but it wasn't as appetizing.Both lobsters roll were excellent. I will just discuss the connecticut one because it is similar to Luke's lobster roll. In terms of freshness of the lobster meat, I would have to give it to Red Hook. In terms of correct ratio of amount of butter on it, I would give it to Luke's lobster. In my opinion, the Red Hook roll had too much butter on it and it detracted your taste buds from the meat itself. Both places gave similar amount of meat. Both places make great rolls, I just prefer Luke's. Actually, I prefer Red Eats in Maine, but that's too far away =DFor drinks, we ordered the maine root beer. I did not get a chance to ask which company root beer they use but I liked it a lot. It isn't as sweet as Bargs. I'm not sure what ingredients to use but I'm assuming they used some wintergreen and anise, amongst other ingredients. Nice balance to it and had a nice strong ""root"" taste.Overall, I would rate this place a solid 3.5 stars. Giving it 4 because you can't do 0.5 on yelp. Service was excellent. Our waiter was friendly and helpful. There was a mistake with how much each credit card was supposed to get charged but the issue was quickly resolved and our waiter was extremely polite and professional about it. I would recommend coming here.The motivation to come to this place was because I read an article about their burger on a reputable food website. I think their burger was good, but not excellent. When I come here again, I will stick with the lobster rolls.",4.0
"If you're looking for super delicious inexpensive lobster roll, this is certainly the place! The lobster roll is packed with chunks of lobster meat  mixed with mayo and topped with some paprika and scallions. The price was only $17, but 2 dollars extra for the BLT one. Besides for the tasty lobster roll, the appetizers were decent. The fried pickles were a little different than what I expected. It was actually bigger chunks of pickles fried. I expected the thin sliced one and I do prefer them more. The lobster bisque was a tad bit too salty and the lobster cheese fries were a little burnt. Overall, I gave this place 4 stars because the waitress was very friendly and the lobster rolls were awesome.",4.0

The waitress recommended us to try the clam stripes for appetizer, then we ordered 1 Maine lobster roll, 1 Connecticut lobster roll, 1 BLT lobster roll, and 1 lobster cheese fries. They were delicious. I love their bread, and the rolls were full of lobster meats. It would say it's enough for 1 person per roll with the side, otherwise, you need to eat 1.5 rolls in order for you to be stuffed. On the menu, they have a lobster dinner night on every Wednesdays, $25 with 1.5lbs lobster with 2 sides, I think it is a good deal. Our family would love to go back to try. Overall, the experience there was pleasant. Highly recommended. =)",4.0
This restaurant is definitely not convenient to get to but based on the yelp reviews I had to try this place at least once. I tried their Maine lobster roll which came with a pickle and fries for twenty dollars. My meal was excellent but the portion was a lot less then what I expected (Im used to the lobster roll from Panera which h is definitely larger but not as good). The service was prompt and the staff was very friendly. The restaurant was larger than what I expected but the seating could be better. The chairs were not that comfortable to me but I'd definitely return.,4.0
"Came here for a quick bite with the bf & was very pleased! I think they underwent some sort of renovation because when I came last year (they were closed) they didn't have the sit down restaurant next door. Vibe is kitchy seafood in a boat, wood covered everything. Very cute. We sat at the bar because we were in a rush. Bartender was super nice & engaging. Got our food out really quick. Food breakdown:New England clam chowder: amazing, on par with my favorite clam chowder in cape cod & I do not say that lightlyLobster mac n cheese: so cheesy! With ginormous chunks of lobsters. Usually places skimp on the lobster but they're not cheap with it here. The 5 cheese mix is great & not too salty like is can get sometimesFries: unreal! So crispy and thin and deliciousColeslaw: really good. Not too much mayo but they had coriander seeds which I personally am not a fan ofLobster roll: the roll is nicely toasted & they pile it sky high with lobster. I got the Connecticut bc in not a huge mayo fan but it was a little dry. The bf got the BLT. They give you a huge thick cut piece of bacon. Surprisingly there was not too much mayo on the roll, just enough to make it moist. I would def go with the Maine roll next time given that I know now that they don't douse it in mayo. Wednesday's are $25 lobster dinner night. I think we're gonna come back next week and check it out.",4.0
"Not bad, not bad at all - the lobster most certainly lived up to its expectations; delicious and not at all chewy. I'm also a fan of the New England Clam Chowder. The burger on the other hand - while prepared properly (as ordered - medium rare), had a taste of a frozen patty ... I guess they've got their priorities straight, judging by how well the seafood part of dinner was prepared. I would also say that three pieces of lobster do not necessarily make ""lobster cheese fries"" - more like: ""oops, some lobster just fell into the fries and it's too late to take it out because the cheese has melted"" but I'm not a chef Overall I'd say that dinner was a success and that I would come back (and recommend to others).",4.0

The lobster mac and cheese was so creamy and blended perfectly with the lobster.HoursMonday: ClosedTuesday-Thursday: 11:30am-9pmFriday-Saturday: 11:30am-10pmSunday: 11:30am-9pmI have heard this location has been renovated/remolded and now serves alcohol. I look forward to returning to see the changes.",4.0
"Came here around noon over the weekend with a group of 3. Had no issues getting a seat. Hostess was friendly and we sat at one of the picnic tables setup. We shared the table with another party of 3. One of the waiters was kind enough to bring my friend a chair so he didn't have to sit at the edge of the bench. I decided to come here because NY Eater highly recommended their burger in addition to their lobster roll. I am a big fan of Luke's lobster so I felt obligated to try one of their competitors.For starters, we ordered the lobster mac and cheese.Nothing to write home about the mac and cheese. Nothing special with the cheese used. The top layer of the cheese wasn't a little crispy. The dish was basically just lobster thrown into the bottom and mac and cheese on top. I thought it would have been something different. Some parts of the dish still felt a little ""grainy"" (not from the lobster, but from the cheese). There bits and pieces of lobster in it but a dish as a whole, it wasn't impressive and I would not recommend it.For main course, we ordered the Hook Burger, Connecticut Lobster Roll, and Maine Lobster Roll. I actually liked the hook burger. It was seasoned well and used nice small pieces of pepper. You can actually taste a difference. Parts of the burger did come medium rare but about a 1/3 of the burger was medium. I may be wrong about this, the burger was juicy but it seemed there was some water content in it. It didn't taste like fat, but maybe I wasn't paying close enough attention. The buns were toasted but the side that was in contact with the tomato and lettuce, it was soggy. I would recommend them just putting it on the side and the customers can add it in. The fries were good. The pickle seemed a little strange to me. It was a little ""soggy"". It didn't have that nice crunch to it. Not sure if it's the style of this particular manufacturing company but it wasn't as appetizing.Both lobsters roll were excellent. I will just discuss the connecticut one because it is similar to Luke's lobster roll. In terms of freshness of the lobster meat, I would have to give it to Red Hook. In terms of correct ratio of amount of butter on it, I would give it to Luke's lobster. In my opinion, the Red Hook roll had too much butter on it and it detracted your taste buds from the meat itself. Both places gave similar amount of meat. Both places make great rolls, I just prefer Luke's. Actually, I prefer Red Eats in Maine, but that's too far away =DFor drinks, we ordered the maine root beer. I did not get a chance to ask which company root beer they use but I liked it a lot. It isn't as sweet as Bargs. I'm not sure what ingredients to use but I'm assuming they used some wintergreen and anise, amongst other ingredients. Nice balance to it and had a nice strong ""root"" taste.Overall, I would rate this place a solid 3.5 stars. Giving it 4 because you can't do 0.5 on yelp. Service was excellent. Our waiter was friendly and helpful. There was a mistake with how much each credit card was supposed to get charged but the issue was quickly resolved and our waiter was extremely polite and professional about it. I would recommend coming here.The motivation to come to this place was because I read an article about their burger on a reputable food website. I think their burger was good, but not excellent. When I come here again, I will stick with the lobster rolls.",4.0
"If you're looking for super delicious inexpensive lobster roll, this is certainly the place! The lobster roll is packed with chunks of lobster meat  mixed with mayo and topped with some paprika and scallions. The price was only $17, but 2 dollars extra for the BLT one. Besides for the tasty lobster roll, the appetizers were decent. The fried pickles were a little different than what I expected. It was actually bigger chunks of pickles fried. I expected the thin sliced one and I do prefer them more. The lobster bisque was a tad bit too salty and the lobster cheese fries were a little burnt. Overall, I gave this place 4 stars because the waitress was very friendly and the lobster rolls were awesome.",4.0
"This place looks like its straight out of Maine with a lighthouse bathroom to boot, instead you're in Red Hook! Service was great, drinks even better, food was fabulous. We started with fried pickles (don't knock them until u've tried them) fried oysters Rockefeller and lobster mac n cheese and peel n eat shrimp. For dinner we had the lobster special which is 1 1/2 lb lobster steamed with corn, slaw & of course butter, a Friday fish fry which came with fried Shrimp, Oysters and Cod served with Fries, Coleslaw and lobster roll. Everything was perfection.",5.0
"I booked a table here for 3 on a Friday night. It was not packed when I arrived and quickly seated. It was our first time to this place. We arrived at 6:45pm and they have happy hour from 4pm-7pm for $5 a draft beer, and $1 per oyster. We ordered a dozen, they were small but fresh and clean. Worth to try. The waitress recommended us to try the clam stripes for appetizer, then we ordered 1 Maine lobster roll, 1 Connecticut lobster roll, 1 BLT lobster roll, and 1 lobster cheese fries. They were delicious. I love their bread, and the rolls were full of lobster meats. It would say it's enough for 1 person per roll with the side, otherwise, you need to eat 1.5 rolls in order for you to be stuffed. On the menu, they have a lobster dinner night on every Wednesdays, $25 with 1.5lbs lobster with 2 sides, I think it is a good deal. Our family would love to go back to try. Overall, the experience there was pleasant. Highly recommended. =)",4.0
This restaurant is definitely not convenient to get to but based on the yelp reviews I had to try this place at least once. I tried their Maine lobster roll which came with a pickle and fries for twenty dollars. My meal was excellent but the portion was a lot less then what I expected (Im used to the lobster roll from Panera which h is definitely larger but not as good). The service was prompt and the staff was very friendly. The restaurant was larger than what I expected but the seating could be better. The chairs were not that comfortable to me but I'd definitely return.,4.0
"Came here for a quick bite with the bf & was very pleased! I think they underwent some sort of renovation because when I came last year (they were closed) they didn't have the sit down restaurant next door. Vibe is kitchy seafood in a boat, wood covered everything. Very cute. We sat at the bar because we were in a rush. Bartender was super nice & engaging. Got our food out really quick. Food breakdown:New England clam chowder: amazing, on par with my favorite clam chowder in cape cod & I do not say that lightlyLobster mac n cheese: so cheesy! With ginormous chunks of lobsters. Usually places skimp on the lobster but they're not cheap with it here. The 5 cheese mix is great & not too salty like is can get sometimesFries: unreal! So crispy and thin and deliciousColeslaw: really good. Not too much mayo but they had coriander seeds which I personally am not a fan ofLobster roll: the roll is nicely toasted & they pile it sky high with lobster. I got the Connecticut bc in not a huge mayo fan but it was a little dry. The bf got the BLT. They give you a huge thick cut piece of bacon. Surprisingly there was not too much mayo on the roll, just enough to make it moist. I would def go with the Maine roll next time given that I know now that they don't douse it in mayo. Wednesday's are $25 lobster dinner night. I think we're gonna come back next week and check it out.",4.0
"Not bad, not bad at all - the lobster most certainly lived up to its expectations; delicious and not at all chewy. I'm also a fan of the New England Clam Chowder. The burger on the other hand - while prepared properly (as ordered - medium rare), had a taste of a frozen patty ... I guess they've got their priorities straight, judging by how well the seafood part of dinner was prepared. I would also say that three pieces of lobster do not necessarily make ""lobster cheese fries"" - more like: ""oops, some lobster just fell into the fries and it's too late to take it out because the cheese has melted"" but I'm not a chef Overall I'd say that dinner was a success and that I would come back (and recommend to others).",4.0
"This place was a life saver we came here on valentines day after leaving a restaurant where the food was so nasty and the service was bad, the atmosphere here in lobster pound  was great and cozy food was nice and fresh and the music they was playing was my kind of music old skool r&b I was shock, the bathroom mirrors had me tripping they had the fun house mirrors,all around the bathroom made my eyes go Cockeyed I would definitely go here a again, they put hershey kiss candies on the table which is my favorite, my Seabreeze magarita was nice and strong just the way I like it ....I would definitely recommend this place",5.0
"Came here after a game and bit out of the way, but the decor instead is very nice, wasnt what I was thinking it would be.  Thought it was more of a food court or a small shop kind of place but it was definitely more of a sit down.  The kitchen closes early though so dont plan to come here late.We got the following- Downeast Bisque - We got a bowl, I dont usually like creamy based soups, but this was a good exception.  The soup isnt spicy at all though, was hoping for more of a kick.  Also the soup isnt very hearty (meaning not much meat inside), but the taste was very good though.- Connecticut Style Lobster Roll - I dont enjoy the mayo style, so decided to get this one.  It was very good, but most of the buttery lemon sauce fell to the bottom of the roll and it was only heavenly near the bottom of the roll.  Also wish the bread was bigger because the lobster kept falling out of the roll.  Overall enjoyed it, but the lobster was a bit on the tough side, seemed slightly overcooked.- The Fish Hook - friend got this and it came with Cheese, so I didnt eat too much of it.  The Fish was very moist, and had good flavor considering it is a cod fish.  - Also got a South Side drink - Had a good kick and was pretty strong!  Enjoyed that as wellOverall enjoyed the food, and would come back.  Pricing is a bit steep especially for the area, but the food didnt disappoint!",4.0

"Re-opened and even better than ever!!!! Sit down seating with waiter service along with a full menu of tasty lobster choices for your picking.

"Def one of the most tastiest Lobster Rolls I have ever had. Making the trip all the way to Red Hook is also half the fun as the journey can be a little difficult due to the limited transportation to the Red Hook area. Almost feels as if finally eating the Lobster Roll its a reward for making it all the way down to their restaurant !For $15 you get one lobster roll, a bag of Cape Cod chips & a pickle. A little pricey but hey its a lobster roll and in my experience all are just about the same price. I suggest getting it Connecticut style because your order is served and drenched with a ladle of hot melted butter on top The inside smells like a fish market which is cool because you know the seafood you are about to devour is fresh. Our wait time was about 15 minutes but they have a nice dining area that almost feels picnic style due to the benches.

"Red Hook Lobster Pound is just swell. They were badly affected by Hurricane Sandy, but the owners used it as an opportunity to renovate their space and offer a more full dining experience. To that end, it looks like they've definitely succeeded.We were able to just walk in on a Sunday night and grab a table. Our waitress apologized for the wait, even though it was literally 20 seconds.Started out with some beers and a cup of the New England chowder, which was possibly the best I've had since I was in Boston years ago. Their beer selection is also pretty good. Lots of crafts.We wanted to do the oysters Rockafella, but sadly, they were sold out for the day. Also sold out of the peel and eat shrimp. Sad face.Oh well, that just meant we had to get more lobster! We split the lobster mac and cheese. The lobster chunks were oh so plentiful. With some fresh pepper from the grinder, it was perfect.For my lobster roll, I went with Connecticut style. So buttery, with giant chunks of fresh, meaty lobster. About as good as it gets. The slaw on the side was decent, and I opted for potato salad, which was pretty good.Of course, no review of the newly renovated Lobster Pound would be complete without reviewing the bathroom in the back. It's big and round, with a beach umbrella mounted to the ceiling, three beach cots on the ground, and mirrors all around (kind of like the funhouse sort). Definitely the coolest bathroom I've been to in recent memory (and I like bathrooms).Stop by and show these guys some love!",5.0

"The-Newly-Improved-Red Hook Lobster Pound was packed my friends!!!But no worries here! We came to Brooklyn to do a few errands and as always, we ALWAYS make a detour to Red Hook LP.

Cool guy I gotta say!! And the fact that he's originally from the Boogie Down- I'm all for that- Hands Down!!!

They have 3 types and we each tried a different one. They all looked pretty similar (see all the lovely yelp pictures) and they tasted better than imaginable. The prices seemed to go up based on yelp pictures of the old menu and were closer to $20 each, and they are small so I recommend getting a side or appetizer. The mussels as an appetizer were awesome, perfectly baked and flavored. The desserts were also phenomenal and we fought over the last shared bits.

"I was on a business trip and hurting for some lobster.  After asking around, several locals recommended this place.  Now, I have to tell you, as my co-worker and I drove there, we began to get worried....  we were expecting this place to be a fancy restaurant.  Honestly, it is neither.  But, please note the 4 stars above.Parking is terrible as you have to park on the street.  When you enter through the door you are greater by a counter and 2 large circular lobster tanks.  You can literally pick out your lobster from a vat of sorts, which we did!  We also ordered the lobster mac and cheese.  Oh, I forgot to mention the ""artwork"" on the walls... lots of painted images/murals.Then we were told to go next door and wait.  So, feeling weirdly uncomfortable about it, we left to wait.  They DO NOT sell alcohol, so we headed to a corner store/bodega and bought some deuce deuces!!!!  Headed back and took a seat at the pick-nick tables on an indoor concrete floor.  Low and behold our food arrived on plastic trays several minutes later.  It was hot and plentiful and all the usual lobster tools were provided.  Bibs, Crackers, and Picks!I did not care for the pick-nick tables you sit at or the fact that this places has 2 separate entrances making it confusing.Lastly, bathrooms we clean and looked recently renovated. Overall.... yummy! But not a sit down restaurant as you might expect.",4.0

"Wanted to branch out, so I tried the Lobster Mac and Cheese recently, but it was pretty disappointing. The cheese aspect of it falls very flat, and they don't give you too many pieces of lobster for your value. (I *did* get this at the Madison Square Eats vendor instead of the brick and mortar store, and it was annoying because the chef had burned the pan 5 times in a row, and I had watched him. Then the cashier comes up to me and tries to tell me that the ""mac and cheese takes longer"", when it had just been the chef's mistake.  I mean, I understand complications occur, but don't lie to my face.)I watched 7 people get their lobster rolls while waiting for my mac and cheese. That's insta-regret for you.Stick to their lobster rolls.",4.0

"Ambiance/decor-5 starsService- 4 starsFood - 5 starsStrikeouts-0/3I had three location choices, Atlantic street fair booth, smorgasburg booth, or the original location. I chose the original. The area around is very ghetto, but on arrival, the inside is totally different from how it is outside. Nothing crazy, but decent. Got seated In a timely manner, got menus and based on the recommendations. My cousin and I got two lobsters rolls. One classic and I got Connecticut. Waiter told us exactly what parts of the lobster was being used. Mainly the claw. Personally my favourite, some people prefer the tail/body over the claw. Food came at a timely manner, literally in less than 5 minutes.This is the most stuffed roll I've seen, and it was so warm and buttered up, the lobster was going through the roll since the base of the bread was caving from the butter of the lobster. It was fresh, and delicious as expected, that I wanted another. I would have gone for seconds, but smorgasburg was the next stop. Highly recommend the original. The coleslaw also complimented the meal very well. 0 complaints on foods.Service wasn't bad except I was seated in front of a poll, that had the waitress go back and forth knocking my chair by accident due to the lack of space.",5.0

The prices seemed to go up based on yelp pictures of the old menu and were closer to $20 each, and they are small so I recommend getting a side or appetizer. The mussels as an appetizer were awesome, perfectly baked and flavored. The desserts were also phenomenal and we fought over the last shared bits. I can't wait to go back here with friends or the hubby! If you want a lobster roll, this is where to get it!",5.0
Best lobster roll in New York! Hands down! And best clam chowder. I crave this roll! No joke.,5.0
"I was on a business trip and hurting for some lobster.  After asking around, several locals recommended this place.  Now, I have to tell you, as my co-worker and I drove there, we began to get worried....  we were expecting this place to be a fancy restaurant.  Honestly, it is neither.  But, please note the 4 stars above.Parking is terrible as you have to park on the street.  When you enter through the door you are greater by a counter and 2 large circular lobster tanks.  You can literally pick out your lobster from a vat of sorts, which we did!  We also ordered the lobster mac and cheese.  Oh, I forgot to mention the ""artwork"" on the walls... lots of painted images/murals.Then we were told to go next door and wait.  So, feeling weirdly uncomfortable about it, we left to wait.  They DO NOT sell alcohol, so we headed to a corner store/bodega and bought some deuce deuces!!!!  Headed back and took a seat at the pick-nick tables on an indoor concrete floor.  Low and behold our food arrived on plastic trays several minutes later.  It was hot and plentiful and all the usual lobster tools were provided.  Bibs, Crackers, and Picks!I did not care for the pick-nick tables you sit at or the fact that this places has 2 separate entrances making it confusing.Lastly, bathrooms we clean and looked recently renovated. Overall.... yummy! But not a sit down restaurant as you might expect.",4.0
Food was very good however the portion of the lobster roll was less than I expected. Service was great however. Would go back.,4.0
"Wanted to branch out, so I tried the Lobster Mac and Cheese recently, but it was pretty disappointing. The cheese aspect of it falls very flat, and they don't give you too many pieces of lobster for your value. (I *did* get this at the Madison Square Eats vendor instead of the brick and mortar store, and it was annoying because the chef had burned the pan 5 times in a row, and I had watched him. Then the cashier comes up to me and tries to tell me that the ""mac and cheese takes longer"", when it had just been the chef's mistake.  I mean, I understand complications occur, but don't lie to my face.)I watched 7 people get their lobster rolls while waiting for my mac and cheese. That's insta-regret for you.Stick to their lobster rolls.",4.0
"oh my word. came here for dinner #2 and wow i was blown away how amazing the MAINE Lobster was hehe. we had the $25 lobster dinner which came with cole slaw, potatoes and omg fresh corn. i was noshing on that lobster like no tomorrow haha.we also had the key lime pie for dessert and it was very good. i think i liked the home made whipped cream more hehe.great price/value (this is Wednesday night only) and service was perfect as well. definitely check it out!",5.0
"Ambiance/decor-5 starsService- 4 starsFood - 5 starsStrikeouts-0/3I had three location choices, Atlantic street fair booth, smorgasburg booth, or the original location. I chose the original. The area around is very ghetto, but on arrival, the inside is totally different from how it is outside. Nothing crazy, but decent. Got seated In a timely manner, got menus and based on the recommendations. My cousin and I got two lobsters rolls. One classic and I got Connecticut. Waiter told us exactly what parts of the lobster was being used. Mainly the claw. Personally my favourite, some people prefer the tail/body over the claw. Food came at a timely manner, literally in less than 5 minutes.This is the most stuffed roll I've seen, and it was so warm and buttered up, the lobster was going through the roll since the base of the bread was caving from the butter of the lobster. It was fresh, and delicious as expected, that I wanted another. I would have gone for seconds, but smorgasburg was the next stop. Highly recommend the original. The coleslaw also complimented the meal very well. 0 complaints on foods.Service wasn't bad except I was seated in front of a poll, that had the waitress go back and forth knocking my chair by accident due to the lack of space.",5.0
"Wanted to say ""It was amazing"", but the Connecticut lobster roll let me down. Not enough butter and the lobster was on the dry, chewy side. My husband was here about two weeks ago and said it was so much better. One outstanding dish was the warm crabmeat dip with house-made chips...nice kick to it and it really hit the spot. Clam chowder was runnier than I'm used to but the flavor was there. I'll give this place one more try to make my lobster roll dream come true.",4.0
"Came here on a  Tuesday and realized they changed the dine in part of the restaurant completely there is now a full menu and alcoholic beverages as well, it is literally a dine in area now with waiters servicing to us.  I am happy that their menu has expanded but I am pissed off hungry right now and it takes them over 35 to bring us two lobster rolls(still not here yet, I'm typing this review hungry) as compared to back then when we got our food in less than 10 minutes. It's a lot bigger now but they only have two waiters servicing the whole restaurant.

I got the set so it came with pickle Coles slaw and potato salad I liked the potato salad  we also ordered Mac and cheese and they claimed that was the reason our food took 40 minute to come.. We didn't even order the entree it was a small SIDE of Mac and cheese I love that they expanded the menu and there's so much stuff that I want to come back and try but after today I don't know... I'm just upset that my food took 40 minute for 2 rolls and a SIDE of Mac and cheese and maybe the fact that they offered dessert but didn't really serve it to us ..(what's the point of offering?)Overall the food was okay, the waiters were really nice but I do not suggest coming hungry since this is no longer a quick bite",3.0

"Da Pound has been representing at Smorgasburg for several years, so I wasn't even aware they had a physical location, but when our friends invited us to a shindig in Red Hook this past weekend, this looked like an easy choice for an affordable dinner. In the early evening hours, it was not quite buzzing but definitely busy with several families and a strong child presence.Going in with zero expectations (except for munching on decent lobstah), we were greeted by a very eager staff who seated us off the bat (no reservation, Saturday night ~7 pm). We arrived early, ahead of the other couple, but RHLP, to their credit, didn't see any reason to put us through the now familiar NYC ritual of waiting for the full party to arrive. This worked out well for everyone, as we were soon on our way with drinks. The cocktail they have on tap, with vodka, cranberry puree, cucumber, and bitters, was really nice and semi-dry (perfect for my latest calorie-counting diet). There are several others on the menu, and all are reasonably priced under $10. Of course there are also wines and a very nice NY-friendly beer selection (Flagship from Staten Island, even!) including the must-pair-with-Maine-lobstah Allagash White.Normally I'd go for white chowder over red, but I decided to try the ""Down East"". It was not a typical red-sauce Manhattan chowder. Rather, it was more of a mushroom soup color and texture but with a medley of fresh scallops, shrimp, and other tasty sea creatures. I wish this chowder were more widely available at other places because I liked switching up from the always delicious but overly cloying New England style soup. As far as entrees go, I think you pretty much have to get the lobstah roll if it's your first time. Theirs come in original, Connecticut (spiced up and buttered), and Tuscan (think Oregano), and you can't go wrong with any of these. The lobster meat was fresh and succulent, and the proper roll lightly toasted, all you can really ask for. It measured up nicely to many places in Maine (where I'll soon be returning for more ambitious crustacean hopping). For my side, I went with potato salad, which was just fine, so potato salad enthusiasts may want to stick with the fries (or sweet potato fries, also available).There was no room left for desserts, but they do have funnel cake if you're so inclined...and don't mind wearing sweat pants the next day. I have it on good authority that you should check out the bathroom and its fun-house mirrors. I gave it a go but was thwarted by a couple of little boys and gave up immediately. Something to return for, I suppose.",5.0
"Before the recent renovations and menu expansion, before the numerous locations, trucks, and festival stands, I remember this place opening up in this spot in Red Hook selling not much more than just whole lobsters and lobster rolls. That was back in 2009 and it wasn't until this past weekend did I finally have my first RHLP experience. The new space is gorgous and features plenty of tables (normal and picnic tables), and a small yet fully stocked bar. The only unfortunate thing is that this type of food would be amazing to eat outside with the view of the bay but there is no outdoor seating and you're a couple blocks from the water. As for their new menu in addition to their lobster rolls there are a number of apps, ""maines"", sandwiches, sides, and even a couple desserts. They have 4 different types of lobster rolls ($20 with fries/potato salad, pickle, and slaw), the classic Maine lobster roll (cold with a bit of mayo), a Connecticut (warm with butter), Tuscan (cold with a basil vinagrette), or BLT (cold with chipotle mayo and the BLT). If lobster isn't your thing they do have fish (broiled, fried, or fried in a sandwich), or a hamburger or hotdog option. A came here with a group of 5 people and we split the lobster cheese fries ($15) to start. They did the smart thing by layering the cheese in the fries before melting it. This was great and the portion was great for a group but there wasn't too much lobster to the dish so the price was a bit high for what you get. I ordered a clam chowder ($8 for the bowl) and this was a proper bowl of chowder, it wasn't thick and goopy but it wasn't watery either. I could have used some more pepper and maybe bacon in there for a little extra flavor and the clams could have been a bit more tender but overall it was a very good bowl of clam chowder. For a meal I got the Ct lobster roll. This was a good size, probably about 6 bites worth (a standard 4.5"" hotdog bun piled up with lobster meat). This was good but I have a hard time justifying paying for such a simple dish I could easily do at home for less than half the cost. We also ordered a number of their special cocktails. My favorite was their Cape Codder ($8) which they actually have on tap. This includes vodka, unsweetened pure cranberry, fresh lime, cucumber, simple syrup, and bitters. Next time I'm here I'll definitely have to try the Navy Grog ($11) which has three types of rum, fresh grapefruit and lime, and soda. Service was great and they do take cards. I would have liked prices being a bit lower but other than that there really wasn't anything to complain about.",4.0
Connecticut lobster roll was GREATTTTT! Took some friends from out of town and they loved it. Lobster was nice and soft.  The butter and roll complimented it well.  No complaints!

Got the $20 Special which comes with a Lobster roll of your choice (traditional Maine, Connecticut, and Tuscan), coleslaw, a pickle (that has a great unique flavor) and a side.  I opted for french fries.  I'm usually pretty unsure about ordering a lobster roll outside of New England because I find them 1. to be not as good, and 2.

Then we were still hungry so we had the lobster dip. Alert: this dish  is big and it s def. A dish to share with the table. We ordered it as an entree and it was difficult to finish it.

"In New York, there is pretty much only 3 SOLID choices when it comes to lobster rolls.  You have Luke's Lobster which is pretty much a franchise at this point which multiple locations.  You have Lobster Joint which is trying to do what Luke's already done.And then you have Red Hook Lobster Pound.To be quite frank, I think that Red Hook Lobster Pound is the best out of the 3.The lobster roll, MAINE styled of course because that is how really n*ggas do it is served with butter seared squared toasted bread.  They fill that shyt up with lobster.  Add mayo.  Voila.  Lobster Roll.I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The lobster was fresh and tender.  The bread was just mouth watering good.  I'm not a butter fan except on popcorn but now I'd definitely do it butter style on toast.  They had fresh squeezed lemon juice at the communal eating tables that gave it just an extra sour zing which was DELICIOUS.So why not 5 stars right?For one, the price.  Lobster is NEVER cheap and even when it is in season you still pretty much overpay for the amount of lobster that you get.  Now, granted this lobster roll and I'm sure all lobster roll that Red Hook Lobster Pound makes really packs it in as they should, I still feel like it was more of an appetizer instead of a roll.If I ordered a roll at the deli, it is a footlong of meat in my mouth.  And believe you and me, I'd be full.Secondly, the lobster tank is actually in the store by the door but in wooden tanks.  It would help to see the lobsters in a glass tank which not only entices people to make oogly eyes at, stop that shyt, that's cruel.  But people do enjoy seeing the lobsters, the live ones at least.Third, the communal tables where you sit and eat is directly next door but technically NOT connected to the store.  If I wanted to ordered more lobster rolls or blueberry soda or whatever for whatever reason, I'd have to exit the communal holding and go back and forth.  It may seem like a minor point out but if you are coming with a group of people and there is a line to order, you'd have to leave your friends for quite sometime not being able to make funny faces at them while on the line to kill the time for the wait.  I know I would be the first person to do JUST that.Fourth, Red Hook is DUMB FAR.  I know they have food trucks that roam in Montauk Long Island and in the city including the L.E.S. but I'm a sucker when it comes to originality and I'd rather trek to the ORIGINAL always.  Which is what I did for the Steve's Authentic Key Lime Pies.  They sell it here but I trekked to the actual store for it.Overall, I like this place.  And if I am ever in the mood for more lobster rolls you know I'd trek right back here.Well maybe I'd just trek to the L.E.S. location from now since I did the original thing already.Coming here is still worth a trip once.",4.0
"The new and improved location in Red Hook was fantastic. I hadn't been here since they threw a couple of picnic tables in the room next to the tanks. Now they have table service and a full bar. Plus an expanded menu which was really good. We shared the lobster cheese fries and they were amazing! Yummy cheese sauce and lots of lobstery chunks. My husband ate the burger which was off the hook - perfect meat to bun ratio, juicy tasty meat, buttered roll, cooked to perfection. I had the lobster roll which I've had many times from the truck, I just wish they would remove the shredded lettuce below the meat and I would love it even more. We finished the meal with key lime pie. Looking forward to going back.",4.0

Got the $20 Special which comes with a Lobster roll of your choice (traditional Maine, Connecticut, and Tuscan), coleslaw, a pickle (that has a great unique flavor) and a side.  I opted for french fries.  I'm usually pretty unsure about ordering a lobster roll outside of New England because I find them 1. to be not as good, and 2. Extremely expensive.  But this place does it well.  Love the atmosphere, feels like a really casual spot that looks like it could be located somewhere in New England.  Great appetizer, other main courses and beer selection, also!",5.0
Lobster happiness. Hot over cold always wins. Portions are great here. I always have to split food here with another foodie.,4.0
"Oh yeah baby. This is the place to eat lobster!!! I like seafood. Any kind of seafood. Didn't plan to come to red hook but my brother was in town with a car and coming back from rockaway beach we decided to stay with the ""ocean theme"". We order the Maine lobster sandwich and the Connecticut lobster sandwich.  I was surprise that I prefered the Connecticut one. But both were yummy. Then we were still hungry so we had the lobster dip. Alert: this dish  is big and it s def. A dish to share with the table. We ordered it as an entree and it was difficult to finish it. But it was really good. Heavy but good! This  was my 1st time in red hook and if I come back I will eat to this place again and order the entier lobster :)",5.0
"great food and great service (although tough to get to location from manhattan)We had the clam chowder, peel & eat shrimp and the lobster dinner. lobster was huge and meaty, shrimp portion was very generous.",5.0
"In New York, there is pretty much only 3 SOLID choices when it comes to lobster rolls.  You have Luke's Lobster which is pretty much a franchise at this point which multiple locations.  You have Lobster Joint which is trying to do what Luke's already done.And then you have Red Hook Lobster Pound.To be quite frank, I think that Red Hook Lobster Pound is the best out of the 3.The lobster roll, MAINE styled of course because that is how really n*ggas do it is served with butter seared squared toasted bread.  They fill that shyt up with lobster.  Add mayo.  Voila.  Lobster Roll.I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The lobster was fresh and tender.  The bread was just mouth watering good.  I'm not a butter fan except on popcorn but now I'd definitely do it butter style on toast.  They had fresh squeezed lemon juice at the communal eating tables that gave it just an extra sour zing which was DELICIOUS.So why not 5 stars right?For one, the price.  Lobster is NEVER cheap and even when it is in season you still pretty much overpay for the amount of lobster that you get.  Now, granted this lobster roll and I'm sure all lobster roll that Red Hook Lobster Pound makes really packs it in as they should, I still feel like it was more of an appetizer instead of a roll.If I ordered a roll at the deli, it is a footlong of meat in my mouth.  And believe you and me, I'd be full.Secondly, the lobster tank is actually in the store by the door but in wooden tanks.  It would help to see the lobsters in a glass tank which not only entices people to make oogly eyes at, stop that shyt, that's cruel.  But people do enjoy seeing the lobsters, the live ones at least.Third, the communal tables where you sit and eat is directly next door but technically NOT connected to the store.  If I wanted to ordered more lobster rolls or blueberry soda or whatever for whatever reason, I'd have to exit the communal holding and go back and forth.  It may seem like a minor point out but if you are coming with a group of people and there is a line to order, you'd have to leave your friends for quite sometime not being able to make funny faces at them while on the line to kill the time for the wait.  I know I would be the first person to do JUST that.Fourth, Red Hook is DUMB FAR.  I know they have food trucks that roam in Montauk Long Island and in the city including the L.E.S. but I'm a sucker when it comes to originality and I'd rather trek to the ORIGINAL always.  Which is what I did for the Steve's Authentic Key Lime Pies.  They sell it here but I trekked to the actual store for it.Overall, I like this place.  And if I am ever in the mood for more lobster rolls you know I'd trek right back here.Well maybe I'd just trek to the L.E.S. location from now since I did the original thing already.Coming here is still worth a trip once.",4.0
"The new and improved location in Red Hook was fantastic. I hadn't been here since they threw a couple of picnic tables in the room next to the tanks. Now they have table service and a full bar. Plus an expanded menu which was really good. We shared the lobster cheese fries and they were amazing! Yummy cheese sauce and lots of lobstery chunks. My husband ate the burger which was off the hook - perfect meat to bun ratio, juicy tasty meat, buttered roll, cooked to perfection. I had the lobster roll which I've had many times from the truck, I just wish they would remove the shredded lettuce below the meat and I would love it even more. We finished the meal with key lime pie. Looking forward to going back.",4.0
"We got some rolls at at Saturday flea market and they were delicious. My chipotle mayo BLT lobster roll was served with warm, soft, buttery bread. The bacon was a thick slice and the saltiness gave flavor to the tomato slices and iceberg lettuce. The mayo had a touch of spice that added a little zing. Oh, but the large hunks of succulent lobster claws were the stars of the show. Portion size wasn't very large, but this was only $10.DH got the Connecticut style roll ($16) with melted butter. He says, ""It was very fresh. The buttered bread and buttered lobster were a delicious combo."" However, he wished they put some chopped celery in it instead of the chives.",5.0
"If you're craving lobster and don't want to trek to lower east side, then trek over to Red Hook!  Is it cheap?   No.  Is it worth it?   Depends who you ask.  Is it good?    Absolutely!We ordered the Connecticut roll and the BLT roll with the extra lobster.  Both comes with heaping portions of lobster.  I ordered the larger version of the BLT and it was massive, totally worth the extra money.  The CT roll has a creamy flavor while the BLT starts off with crunchy strips of bacon and piled on with lobster pieces.  The BLT roll required me to break it apart before I could bit into it.The location has a separate dining area that's easily large enough for groups.  It's definitely a nice place to hang out and enjoy some fresh lobster. Totally worth the trip from Queens.",5.0
"Had a good meal here for late lunch on a Saturday.  Enjoyed the fact that they specifically list their different styles of lobster rolls on their menu (both Maine and Connecticut), rather than offering only one style.  Tried one of both, and split the Lobster Mac and Cheese with a friend.Lobster rolls were tasty and, for the first time, I actually preferred the CT style (hot, with melted butter) to the Maine (cold, with mayo).  Full of lobster, certainly worth it for the price of $17 each.Lobster mac and cheese was rife with lobster (at least compared to the handful of other lobster mac and cheese dishes I've tried), but less creamy than expected or preferred.  Not sure the shape/type of pasta was the best choice either, but still, not bad.Probably the best aspect of our lunch was that they have prosecco on tap, as I'm a bit of a fanatic about readily available bubbly.  Would like to return for football some Sunday and just slot up to the bar for drinks and snacks.Ambiance is cute, warm, and casual with lots of lobster/harbor/nautical elements (almost too much to the point of cheesy), and service was a little weird/slow, but we did have a lovely, relaxing lunch, so no complaints here!  I expect service picks up when it's more busy - indeed, there were only four parties or so when we arrived.We'll return for drinks and snacks!",4.0
"I rarely get to this area, but was there for business and drove past Red Hook Lobster Pound. Wait, did I just see that? A quick around the block and I'm parked around the corner.  I walk in dreaming about the lobster roll I've only read about. Heaven awaits. But what's this? Is Lucifer blocking the pearly gates? They're closed for renovations!?! Drats! I venture in to take a look anyway. The woman inside is very nice as I explain my disappointment. I'm in luck! They can scrape together a lobster roll. I wait as my little bit of heaven is prepared.I take my Maine roll to the car and ogle the beautifully buttered and toasted roll filled with rosy pink lobster meat. As I bite in I realize that this is the real deal. The meat was perfectly cooked. Not the least bit chewy or rubbery.  The sauce was a lite mayonnaise sauce that complimented, not overshadowed the star of the show. A perfect light scattering of some scallion to give some crunch and light flavor contrast.  This is the best lobster roll I've had (I've never been to Maine - before now).I'm going to make a point to revisit once thier renovations are done this spring.",5.0

Wait staff was friendly and enthusiastic.Place is decorated in a fun style.As for food...my blt lobster roll was tasty and fresh and the sweet potato fries were good. The clam chowder was slightly above average. The drink was ok. The deserts seemed overpriced.  Overall my complaint is primarily about price and value.  Two dined on lobster rolls, soup, desert and one drink and the bill with tip was $108.  Nothing was extraordinary, nothing was bad but I can think of a lot of other meals for less than this price that left me much happier.",3.0

"""There be dragons"" seemed to be the crux of what our hosts had to say of Red Hook, ""but there be creative types too."" There also be no public transport to this fabled land, so my girlfriend and I proceeded on foot from nearby Cobble Hill. With light fading, a thin rain falling and very few people on Van Brunt Street as we walked west past huge lorries edging into the docking areas, Red Hook's air of mystery and intrigue seemed fully deserved.Red Hook Lobster Pound was the first stop on our odyssey. Like the street outside, it was deserted save for a friendly chap behind the counter. He encouraged us to look at the lobsters milling around in the tanks at the front of the shop. Then he introduced us to the menu, before languidly regaling us with the story of how lobster came to be fished off the east coast by European settlers. We duly bought a lobster roll and key lime pie before retiring to the space next door (slightly confusingly, via the street outside).The lobster was probably the best I've ever had. Like all sea food, it's best when fresh, and as the congregating lobsters in the water tanks show, it's not going to be much fresher than it is here. The key lime pie was good, but the lobster was the real star. The nautical theme to the interior of both spaces was pleasingly evocative too, heightened by the sound of the wind and rain outside. I will always be grateful to Red Hook Lobster Pound for reassuring me that we had definitely made it past the dragons an into the land of wonder. But most of all I'll be grateful to Red Hook Lobster Pound for showing me what real lobster tastes like, and as such, what to compare my future encounters with this red-shelled crustacean to.",5.0
"My experience was great. The waitress was well versed on the menu. We ordered the ceviche which turned ouft to be a salad rather than really ceviche with fresh seafood but more organic lettuce and onions and tomatoes than fish so I would skip it for the 17$ price tag. I ordered the BLT lobster roll which was cold and delicious. My friend ordered the Connecticut roll which is warm with butter. Both were absolutely amazing. We ordered sweet potato fries which come as a side with the meal for 21$. Sadly, for the patrons getting there an hour after we got there (3pm), the kitchen had a small fire and stopped serving food.  The British pale ale was pretty good as well. So 5 stars for the lobster rolls, those are the star. 3-4 stars for the waitress who didn't make sure we ordered drinks and the ceviche that I've had better at other places.",5.0

The service was friendly and unpretentious. Food was awesome and the pricing was much appreciated by a manhattanite. The lobster was soooooooo juicy ! If tasted like the lobster volunteered to be served up as a culinary delight. Living its entire life to be a delectable dining experience. WOW. Definitely coming back.,5.0
"The Maine style lobster roll was delicious; lightly tossed in mayo and a buttered bun. However the lobster roll itself is very small for how much you pay. I just wish it was a little bit bigger. Other than that, one of the better lobster roll places around!",4.0

"Attended the Urban Space ""Broadway Bites"" event and visited a few different carts, one of which was for Red Hook Lobster. I got the Maine Lobster roll for $17. It was good, but I honestly think that Luke's Lobster has much more flavor all around - both in the lobster and the roll. It certainly wasn't bad and the price, while expensive, is about average for a lobster roll in NYC.",3.0
"Definitely had one of the best Lobster rolls I have ever had before at Red Hook Lobster Pound.  The lobster is deliciously fresh and the sandwich,albeit small, left me quite full.  Order at the counter and then your lobster is served to your indoor picnic table next door.  They have several sides including mac-n-cheese, potato salad, and cole slaw.  The sides were all tasty but did not compare to the delicious lobster.  This place is not cheap so you will be paying a hefty price tag for lobster, but every once in a while this is definitely worth it.",5.0
We ate here prior to docking the Zephyr boat tour! It was the best lobster roll I've ever eaten! I've spent $24 on a lobster roll & bag of chips at a mediocre place in Chicago called Fish Bar in Lakeview and I never went back cause it lacked flavor and was so small I couldn't believe it cost that much. Anyways this place is located by some cute shops & offers cold or hot lobster rolls. We had 1 Connecticut & 1 Tuscan lobster roll sandwich both well seasoned w/generous amounts of lobster meat. I'll definitely be back for more whenever I'm in town. For $16 and some change its worth every penny.,5.0
"Had the Tuscan style lobster roll for lunch in Smorgasburg. It was delish. Lobster was fresh, well-seasoned, and so tender. The dish was portioned perfectly for me - not too huge, but enough to satiate my appetite. Worth the $17. Location was also awesome; Smorgasburg is a foodie's version of heaven.",4.0
"Checked out the new digs today.  Love the decor- but WTF with the jumbo screen playing football?  Is it a seafood joint or a sports bar?The food was delish as always - however, I think the fish sandwich was by far the winner over the lobster roll.   The lobster roll was lacking a little in flavor and parts were mushy.Service was friendly but slow- and the place was only 70% full.  I would hate to see it when it is at capacity.I love the pound but I am not sure about their ability to run a restaurant.  Hopefully, with time, they will work out the kinks.",3.0

"Initially, I had found out about this place on TV when they were doing a special program. My parents though, why not try? Lobster rolls are not that common in the subrubs of New Jersey, so curiously, we went to go try. Of course, I had my doubts of just how good a lobster rolll could be. Would it be greasy? Too fast-food? Not enough lobster? Too much bread? Wrong!My parents and I all ordered a lobster roll, with the exception of me ordering a bikini (which is escentially the same thing but replaced lettuce wrap instead bread on the lobster roll). With all the meat on the roll, I swear it was as much as one whole lobster! It looks smaller that seen in photos, but looks can be deceiving because after eating just one, my stomach was about to burst. Very filling indeed! I thought the seasoning was great! Not too salty, not too much of anything. Salty seafood is never good +_+ As for appearances, aside from the food, interestnig decor I will say. A bit cramped seeing how the place isn't all that big. Service can be a little slow depending on how many people are there. Once, we waited thiry minutes to get a table from how many people were there at the peak of lunch time. There's a sports bar, a pretty big one at that, on the side. Sometimes I wonder if this is a bar or a resturant... The TV is sometimes seriously loud that I can't even hear myself talk. But, I guess the food quality makes up for that, seeing how they get their lobster fresh and alive from all the way from Maine!It's not perfect, but then again, is anything ever perfect? ;) My family comes here often. It's a place we like to go even if it's a bit far away. What I will say is that the food is always on point!",4.0
"Good fresh lobster if you are craving.  My favorite  is the blt lobster roll, bacon makes everything  better.  Sweet potatoes fries very good and fried pickles.  Drinks just ok.  The 4 stars because  I am  into paying for good food but this place is definitely over price.",4.0
"The place recently opened a full restaurant and it is beautiful!

"I'm more of a fan of the girls who work behind the counter than the lobster roll.Don't get me wrong, the lobster roll was pretty good, but I don't know how often I would make this trip to red hook for it.The lobster mac and cheese was good and filling, but for $12 you don't get much lobster - looks like 2 chunks/claws. The lobster roll itself had lettuce and other things in it that were not just the lobster, bread and butter (I got the Maine style), but it was pretty. good.The girls behind the counter are nice and pretty efficient, as well as they can be waiting for the other foods to come out from the back. There was an error in our order which was fixed and I got to sample the error anyway, yay! The root beer they sell here is also good. There was a decent line on a regular day and they also sell the small Steve's Authentic Key Lime pies for $5 - get them here.

"Waited 20 minutes for 2 lobster rolls, 30 minutes after they opened...really? That was already a turn off as is.

I wish I had a scale to measure out the quarter pound of lobster meat that was promised. The ""roll"" was the size of a hot dog bun! I finished mine in maybe 5 long bites.

Just found out they have a mini version at smorgasburg a few blocks from my place at the seaport...what a gem. Not a mayo fan so we tried the Italian style which is a red wine vinaigrette and scallion which was perfect because the lobster is really all the matters and it's amazing. The bun is lightly toasted and adds a small amount of crunch which is perfect. Best $17 I've ever spent,5.0

There's a separate dining room next door you can chow down at.If it's your first time, try one of each. The lobster mac and cheese here is pretty darn good. Pasta shells with lots of melted cheese (they use 4 types) and tender chunks of robster.The bisques and chowder are pretty good too.

"THIS REVIEW IS NOT FOR THE FOOD!Red Hook lobster pound has the potential to be a great 5+ food establishment. The food is great (when the servers get it right), they don't skimp on the lobster meat, and they have a pretty big menu to choose from. However, the service is just plain horrible. I have been to Red Hook lobster twice and both times i had issues with the service.The first time, our orders were not placed to the kitchen and we ended up waiting 45+ minutes to find out our food hasn't even been placed. After we complained to the server, she told us that they made a mistake and didn't place our order. The manager came over to us, apologized, and even threw in a free key lime pie. Everyone makes mistakes and we were pleased with how this situation was handled. The owner of the restaurant even came over to us to apologize and make small talk. We decided to give this place another try yesterday and once again we had issues with getting our food. We ordered six lobster rolls, 2 with fries and 4 a la carte. We once again waited about 30-45 minutes to get our food and when it came they forgot one lobster roll, and my girlfriends CT style lobster roll (which is supposed to be warm) came out dead cold along with the fries. We told the waitress, she took it back and brought out a warm lobster roll and once again cold fries. At this point this is pretty ridiculous. We complained to the manager and she apologized and brought back some warm fries. When the bill came they added an extra order of fries to our bill; yet another mistake.

"Beware of take out orders.Whenever I have a craving for some lobster rolls, this is the place to go.  It's convenient located just off the Gowans.

I've only had a couple lobster rolls in my life so I am probably not the best judge for these things. However I can say the lobster is fresh and plentiful in the rolls at Lobster Pound. We had the Maine and CT styles. I preferred the CT style as it was warm and lighter tasting being it had no mayo. The sides of slaw and potato salad were fine. Service is friendly but just OK. Will be back when in the mood for sea bug.,4.0
Came here after a great day at Brighton beach and could not imagine having anything else but some fresh lobster! I had the lobster roll with butter and lemon and it was delicious. The bun was great and nice and crispy. I subbed in the sweet potato fries which were great but could have used a little more salt. The biggest complaint about the roll was that it was a little bit small and I wish there was more lobster! I would come back and try the lobster dinner next time because I think it would better satisfy my lobster craving.,4.0

"Things I love about Red Hook Lobster-There was parking right in front of the place, thank you for being red hook and not...cobble hill-The staff was really good with giving us recommendations, there needed to be a strategy on how we can fit as much good food in our stomachs as possible.-My Maine Lobster roll $16 - so fresh. Lobster was cooked perfectly.-Lobster mac and cheese was sooo rich, I couldn't eat more than 5 bites. For those 5 bites, it was heavenly. But one more I would have had cardiac arrest. Not worth the $12 unless you're splitting it with a bunch of people.-Did those fries come with our order? Things that could have been done better:-I thought I would like the Connecticut roll more (butter always wins, no?). The flavor was better but many of the lobster claw meat was very tough.-Corn could have used more butter",4.0

Great lobster rolls- the best in NY. Unfortunately their expansion was made st the cost of efficiency. It took us more than 40  min to get a drink.,3.0
"My star rating would have been better but two words: SLOW SERVICE! Our waiter Adrian was so inattentive. My drink (a simple beer) took forever. Chowder was an appetizer and was at least 10 minutes after the beer. I also watched Adrian clear tables, serve drinks and then after all that gave us our check.",3.0
"Awesome place.  They have a house SixPoint beer on draft, the menu has enough choices for even those that aren't lobster obsessed, and the lobster rolls themselves are awesome.  I liked all the different options of lobster rolls as well.  I had the BLT lobster roll with bacon and chipotle mayo - it sounds ridiculous and purist will likely scoff at it, but it was incredible.Great vibe and great food.  Definitely going back soon.",4.0
I've only had a couple lobster rolls in my life so I am probably not the best judge for these things. However I can say the lobster is fresh and plentiful in the rolls at Lobster Pound. We had the Maine and CT styles. I preferred the CT style as it was warm and lighter tasting being it had no mayo. The sides of slaw and potato salad were fine. Service is friendly but just OK. Will be back when in the mood for sea bug.,4.0
Came here after a great day at Brighton beach and could not imagine having anything else but some fresh lobster! I had the lobster roll with butter and lemon and it was delicious. The bun was great and nice and crispy. I subbed in the sweet potato fries which were great but could have used a little more salt. The biggest complaint about the roll was that it was a little bit small and I wish there was more lobster! I would come back and try the lobster dinner next time because I think it would better satisfy my lobster craving.,4.0

"Things I love about Red Hook Lobster-There was parking right in front of the place, thank you for being red hook and not...cobble hill-The staff was really good with giving us recommendations, there needed to be a strategy on how we can fit as much good food in our stomachs as possible.-My Maine Lobster roll $16 - so fresh. Lobster was cooked perfectly.-Lobster mac and cheese was sooo rich, I couldn't eat more than 5 bites. For those 5 bites, it was heavenly. But one more I would have had cardiac arrest. Not worth the $12 unless you're splitting it with a bunch of people.-Did those fries come with our order? Things that could have been done better:-I thought I would like the Connecticut roll more (butter always wins, no?). The flavor was better but many of the lobster claw meat was very tough.-Corn could have used more butter",4.0

"Lobster rolls have somewhat become a delicacy for me, the main reason is because of their high price tag. But it's summer time, and a cold lobster roll is both refreshing and seems to hit the spot. So down came Red Hook Lobster Pound, fairly reputable in the metropolitan New York area.Red Hook offers two types of lobster rolls ($16.00 each): the Maine style served cold with celery, spices, and a touch of homemade may; or the Connecticut style roll for warm lobster smothered in melted butter. Both are served on a J.J. Nissen split-top bun.I opted for the Maine style. When I received it, I was amazed at how many chunks of lobster meat were stuffed in the bun. But soon after biting into it, I noticed the bottom half of the bun contained all slaw and celery. It was somewhat disappointed for getting my initial hypes up and then feeling somewhat deceived. As for the lobster roll, I wasn't at all amazed. Yes, the lobster was fresh, but all it tasted like was cold lobster, mayo, some slaw in a roll. It tasted like the simple components that they were, integrating together nicely, however it didn't really get me as excited as I was hoping. It was at best average, and I would have figured I could have made a lobster roll at home, with the exception of some homemade slaw, for a fraction of the price.With lobsters selling at one of the all-time lowest price of about $4.00 per pound (and if you travel to the Northeast, you can get lucky enough to score lobster for $2.50 pound), I wonder why local places like these don't adjust their prices accordingly. $16.00 for a lobster roll is somewhat overprice and not worth it at all. It's sort of insulting considering that hamburger meat and other meats sell for more than lobster at the marketplace. Red Hook Lobster Pound, I really tried to like you, but you just didn't cut it for me. Moving on...",2.0

"Red Hook Lobster Pound is one of my favorites!  The store front in Red Hook is small, but they have a nice sized room right next door where you can take your food to sit and enjoy comfortably.  Service is friendly, efficient, and fast.  And the lobster never disappoints!  Always fresh and delicious on the perfectly buttered & toasted roll.  I've had the Maine roll and the Tuscan roll.  Both are delicious in their own ways.  I'm not a huge fan of mayo, so I typically opt for Tuscan style, which is dairy free and tossed in a basil vinaigrette.  Just talking about it, I'm ready to head out to Red Hook to get another roll.  My husband usually gets the lobster BLT and always enjoys it.  The Red Hook location also serves full lobster dinners, which I look forward to trying soon.",5.0

"Friendly, helpful service and fresh fresh lobster! Make sure to look in the tanks in front. We ordered our food and headed next door to wait for our rolls. It's byob, which would've been good to know ahead of time :) We really enjoyed the clam chowder and the sicilian roll.",4.0

"Seriously awesome roll. Got to try their Maine Style Lobster roll ($16) and I was in love..Compared to luke's, this is definitely made with more mayo. With that said, the heaviness was lifted brilliantly with lemon, fresh scallions, shredded lettuce, and some paprika on top. Even though the size of the roll was petite, there were HUGE chunks of lobster. The flavor profiles all worked incredibly well, and I can't recommend it enough. awesome.",5.0
"Lobster rolls have somewhat become a delicacy for me, the main reason is because of their high price tag. But it's summer time, and a cold lobster roll is both refreshing and seems to hit the spot. So down came Red Hook Lobster Pound, fairly reputable in the metropolitan New York area.Red Hook offers two types of lobster rolls ($16.00 each): the Maine style served cold with celery, spices, and a touch of homemade may; or the Connecticut style roll for warm lobster smothered in melted butter. Both are served on a J.J. Nissen split-top bun.I opted for the Maine style. When I received it, I was amazed at how many chunks of lobster meat were stuffed in the bun. But soon after biting into it, I noticed the bottom half of the bun contained all slaw and celery. It was somewhat disappointed for getting my initial hypes up and then feeling somewhat deceived. As for the lobster roll, I wasn't at all amazed. Yes, the lobster was fresh, but all it tasted like was cold lobster, mayo, some slaw in a roll. It tasted like the simple components that they were, integrating together nicely, however it didn't really get me as excited as I was hoping. It was at best average, and I would have figured I could have made a lobster roll at home, with the exception of some homemade slaw, for a fraction of the price.With lobsters selling at one of the all-time lowest price of about $4.00 per pound (and if you travel to the Northeast, you can get lucky enough to score lobster for $2.50 pound), I wonder why local places like these don't adjust their prices accordingly. $16.00 for a lobster roll is somewhat overprice and not worth it at all. It's sort of insulting considering that hamburger meat and other meats sell for more than lobster at the marketplace. Red Hook Lobster Pound, I really tried to like you, but you just didn't cut it for me. Moving on...",2.0
Solid. Excellent menu options. Great service. Blown away by the lobster roll and key lime pie. They have my favorite blueberry soda. I will be back.,5.0
"Red Hook Lobster Pound is one of my favorites!  The store front in Red Hook is small, but they have a nice sized room right next door where you can take your food to sit and enjoy comfortably.  Service is friendly, efficient, and fast.  And the lobster never disappoints!  Always fresh and delicious on the perfectly buttered & toasted roll.  I've had the Maine roll and the Tuscan roll.  Both are delicious in their own ways.  I'm not a huge fan of mayo, so I typically opt for Tuscan style, which is dairy free and tossed in a basil vinaigrette.  Just talking about it, I'm ready to head out to Red Hook to get another roll.  My husband usually gets the lobster BLT and always enjoys it.  The Red Hook location also serves full lobster dinners, which I look forward to trying soon.",5.0
"The Maine lobster roll is pretty delicious. Also pretty tiny for $16, but you get a decent amount of lobster.

The service was great with a great sense of humor. The french fries were as tasty as the lobster roll.

"I love lobster rolls and purely came here from the good reviews. There was a small line but everything was quick. This place gives more lobster than smorgsaborg, same prices 16-18 per roll.

My boyfriend has never been a fan of lobster because he's more of a crab type of a guy but he absolutely loves the buttered roll that goes with the lobster they put together here.

"This review is for their vendor location at Coney Island. I have never had a lobster roll and was very excited to try it. And for $18 bucks for just a roll I was expecting heaven and I was very disappointed. Most reviewers said you just had to go with the Maine Roll so that's what I did. Its supposed to have a bit of mayo, but I detected none.  It was pretty much just lobster with no other flavor. The lobster itself was very tender but a bit fishy flavor wise so perhaps a bit more mayo and seasoning would have covered the fishy taste. The bun was great but for the price I was expecting to really have something noms. Perhaps I should have tried the other roll as it had more things added to the lobster. But I won't be going back to spend that much money on such a mediocre sandwich.",2.0
"Huge fan of Luke's. Was this better? I think it's hard to compare because they serve it differently. Here you get to choose Maine - chilled w mayo / CT - warm w butter / Tuscany style - chilled w basil vinaigrette. In Luke's you get it chilled w mayo (but I usually get it without) Luke's you get to try the crab roll, which I argue is better than their lobster. Here at red hook you get to try the lobster roll in one of the 3 styles. Both Luke's and Red hook are GOOD. Can't say which is better, lobster roll wise. I would say be open to trying both. Rolls - My S.O. got the CT style and I got the Tuscany. Mine was twice the size of his - I think I just got lucky. Plus the meat on his might have shrunk due to the heat. I do feel eating it chilled is better  - the meat is softer and less ""chewy"".Lemonade - meh.On the side note, they serve Steve's key lime pie too. YUM!!!

"Just popped in after getting a yelp invite about the place. We ordered 3x Lobster rolls Connecticut style , one shrimp roll and one steamed lobster.

Not to crazy about the scallions but they were pleasant enough that i  wasn't searching them out to remove them. Size is on the small side but I personally believe in quality over quantity . Mostly claw meat and lobster in every bite.My mom had a bite of the shrimp roll and was not impressed. She couldn't find a shrimp which is odd for a SHRIMP roll but she also didn't like the dusting of paprika and cinnamon. The steamed whole Lobster was perfect. Not over done and well with the free butter and lemon. Actually a better buy then the rolls if you ask me (1.5 lbs for $14 vs. the $16 for  the sandwich)The cashier did mention the seating next door. Offering it to us while we waited . Though we didn't stay the gentleman that did had his food brought to him. The only down side was that I spent about $67 and they didn't even give me the chips that come with the sandwiches.

"Finally visited the Lobster Pound's store, on a relatively quiet stretch of Van Brunt.  Easily accessible by car but not so much by public transportation.  They're regulars at Brooklyn street fairs, where I've had their lobster rolls multiple times.  They're also at the Bklyn Flea, which I've yet to experience, and I hear there's a stand near the Bklyn Ice Cream Factory.At the Red Hook store, orders are placed at the left storefront, which houses, right by the entrance, a large pool covered by two round, wooden lids.  Clustered inside are lots of lobsters for sale, two large scales nearby for weighing.  Other than that, its just the counter and the small stove and soup area where they prepare the lobster rolls and scoop up the soup.  They have a nice dining room at their adjacent storefront but need to access via the street.  Its a decent sized space with 6 or 7 cafeteria style tables with benches in solid, polished wood, bright and very comfortable.They serve two types of lobster rolls, the classic Maine style with just a bit of mayo, diced celery, shredded lettuce, and sliced scallions, and the Connecticut style, where the lobster is warm and buttered.  Both are served on a top-split hot dog bun that's buttered and toasted.  A nice line of Maine Root root beers are offered, one of the only root beers that I like.  They also have soups available, not sure how consistent these are but I've tried New England clam chowder and corn and shrimp chowder.I like both the Maine and Connecticut styles; neither adds much adornment, letting the lobster really be the star.  It is a relatively small sized roll, with the lobster meat comfortably fitting inside the roll rather than deliberately spilling out; whether this is good or bad depends on your mileage.  You definitely don't get meat from a whole lobster in one roll.  Just about all the times I've had it, the lobster meat was very fresh, sweet, cooked just right, and tasty.  Once it was a bit overdone.  Its relatively cheap on the NYC scale of lobster roll pricing but it, like Luke's, is a small sized roll compared, say, to the huge portion at Ed's.  Costs $15 and comes with a pickle chip and a bag of Cape Cod chips.  Honestly, I can and do eat two rolls for a meal, one of each style.  The two chowders I tried were excellent, with deep and layered flavors, lots of fillings and seafood.I think its fair to mention that while I love lobster and lobster rolls, I've NEVER had one in New England.  Hence, I assume that like other foods that can be found in exceptional quality in their native place, the non-native NYC version won't meet the original's standards (or low prices).  Therefore, I can't wait to visit New England and have some lobster rolls, including the famous Reds.  Until then, Red Hook Lobster Pound is one of the best lobster rolls I've had in NYC and I'll continue to go back to get a fix now and then.",4.0

"Look, it's a great lobster roll ... for New York. Admittedly I'm a snob seeing as I end up in Maine at least twice a year but what can I say, gotta call it like it is: Solid restaurant, nice choices (bisque, roll, mac & cheese, whole dinner, blt), fresh and good tasting lobster. I find lobster is hard to work with because it's a flavor that's so easy to smother... their lobster rolls have great subtle seasoning (whether it's straight up butter or their homemade mayo) that really enhances the dish.Biggest problem is getting all the way to Red Hook to have it... Holla to the technicolor lobster on the wall in the dining room and the bizarre pin up with a lobster molesting a chick by the counter.",4.0
"So here's the thing...we don't have lobster rolls in LA.  So when Felicia C told me that Day 2 of my trip was going to consist of the two of us going on a Lobster Roll crawl, and that the first stop was all the way in Red Hook Brooklyn, I was excited but had no idea what the hell a lobster roll even was.So after taking a train, a bus and walking for a spell, we came upon Red Hook Lobster Pound.  Inside was pretty freaking cool.  Huge tubs of lobsters just sorta hanging out waiting to be, well, turned into rolls.  We ordered one of each to share.  The conneticut which was lobster with butter, and the maine with a light mayo.We strolled next door to the cute ""dining"" area and got to work.Holy crustaceans, they were freakin' fantastic!  How the hell have I not ever tasted this before?  The lobster meat was sweet, fresh and had HUGE chucks of claw meat there for the taking.  The rolls were soft, toasted and delicious.  I swear to God, when I took my first bites of each I started trying to figure out how I could find a job in Brooklyn so that I could have these rolls all day, every day, for the rest of my life.  Red Hook definitely has me hooked.  And on my next trip to NYC, I'll be sure to take the train and the 61 bus again for round two.  Big ups to Brooklyn indeed.",5.0
"Thanks to a coupon from Black Board Eats for 30% off, my boyfriend and I made it here on a rainy day. If not for the lobster, I would never even come this far for anything! Good thing is it is absolutely worth it! We tried both the butter lobster roll and the mayo lobster roll. I personally think butter roll is much better with the toasted buns and jumbo chunk of lobster. Nevertheless, the mayo one is the lighter version if you don't want to go crazy on the butter. The lobster roll comes with a bag of chips and pickle. There is a seating area right next to the restaurant.

"My friend and I made the journey all the way to Red Hook one rainy day. We wandered the streets with zero idea of where we were because Google Maps decided to be unhelpful that day. After finally finding the store, we started to get really hungry. The store where you buy is this tiny place and the building next to it is set up cafeteria style where you can eat. Anways, we each got a lobster roll, fries, and shared a key lime pie. Everything was DELICIOUS. One of the best lobster rolls. Only downside is the place took me almost 2 hours to get there... I'll have to make do with going to Smorgasborg and eating it there. (which I did a few weeks later) DELICIOUS. My favorite lobster roll in New York.",5.0
"Maybe it's my fault. I had outsize expectations for a lobster roll from Red Hook, Brooklyn thinking it would be comparable to something I've eaten in Maine or Connecticut ( I mean the roll I got was called the Connecticut), but it just wasn't.The bun had way too much butter on it turning the bread into goop, the lobster was limp and flavorless. The best part of my meal was the chips and soda. I won't be back.",2.0
"Definitely four stars for the service.  After my previous review, the owner/manager contacted me and did a really good job of correcting the situation.  She gave me a certificate to try the Connecticut roll again and this time the lobster meat was measured and prepared properly with ample lobster meat throughout the bun. The employees were also very friendly and attentive.  Still no tail meat but a lot of claw and leg meat none the less.  It tasted good but compared to Maine and other lobster roll spots up and down the east coast, it would be considered middle of the pack but probably the best quality in NYC.",4.0
"The food is good, don't get me wrong - but their lobsters are from Canada.  I recently purchased 5 of the yummy crawlers and found ""Wild Lobster Product of Canada"" rubber bands on their claws.  I wrote the folks on their facebook page and they told me to follow up on their store email. No response.I don't mind paying more to support a local business, but don't go and tell everyone that you drive every day to Maine to get the freshest products, that you are directly supporting local Maine fishemen and then sell me overpriced lobster from Canada - just like everyone else.  Not cool, Lobster Pound.  Not cool.",2.0

"The line at Red Hook Lobster Pound in Red Hook is virtually non-existent compared to the line at the Brooklyn Flea. The line at RHLP is considerably shorter and faster than Luke's Lobster in the East Village, but Luke's Lobster is way better, IMO. Not to say RHLP wasn't good, it was just slightly less better than Luke's, like 1% less. Hence the 4 stars.Upon entering, you will notice the two big ""hot tubs"" filled with cold water.  I like to refer to these as the luxury pools for the lobsters. The lobsters here are alive and well... as fresh from Maine as you can get considering NY is a few states away on the map. They treat the lobsters as if they were Wagyu lobsters. In lieu of beer and massages, the lobsters get to roam freely in a non aquarium like setting. And then they are hacked.Hacked, warm, and with a touch of butter, the Connecticut style lobster roll is very good. The meat is plenty, sweet and tender and the bread is almost like the toast on a grilled cheese sandwich.

"Look, it's a great lobster roll ... for New York. Admittedly I'm a snob seeing as I end up in Maine at least twice a year but what can I say, gotta call it like it is: Solid restaurant, nice choices (bisque, roll, mac & cheese, whole dinner, blt), fresh and good tasting lobster. I find lobster is hard to work with because it's a flavor that's so easy to smother... their lobster rolls have great subtle seasoning (whether it's straight up butter or their homemade mayo) that really enhances the dish.Biggest problem is getting all the way to Red Hook to have it... Holla to the technicolor lobster on the wall in the dining room and the bizarre pin up with a lobster molesting a chick by the counter.",4.0
"So here's the thing...we don't have lobster rolls in LA.  So when Felicia C told me that Day 2 of my trip was going to consist of the two of us going on a Lobster Roll crawl, and that the first stop was all the way in Red Hook Brooklyn, I was excited but had no idea what the hell a lobster roll even was.So after taking a train, a bus and walking for a spell, we came upon Red Hook Lobster Pound.  Inside was pretty freaking cool.  Huge tubs of lobsters just sorta hanging out waiting to be, well, turned into rolls.  We ordered one of each to share.  The conneticut which was lobster with butter, and the maine with a light mayo.We strolled next door to the cute ""dining"" area and got to work.Holy crustaceans, they were freakin' fantastic!  How the hell have I not ever tasted this before?  The lobster meat was sweet, fresh and had HUGE chucks of claw meat there for the taking.  The rolls were soft, toasted and delicious.  I swear to God, when I took my first bites of each I started trying to figure out how I could find a job in Brooklyn so that I could have these rolls all day, every day, for the rest of my life.  Red Hook definitely has me hooked.  And on my next trip to NYC, I'll be sure to take the train and the 61 bus again for round two.  Big ups to Brooklyn indeed.",5.0
"Thanks to a coupon from Black Board Eats for 30% off, my boyfriend and I made it here on a rainy day. If not for the lobster, I would never even come this far for anything! Good thing is it is absolutely worth it! We tried both the butter lobster roll and the mayo lobster roll. I personally think butter roll is much better with the toasted buns and jumbo chunk of lobster. Nevertheless, the mayo one is the lighter version if you don't want to go crazy on the butter. The lobster roll comes with a bag of chips and pickle. There is a seating area right next to the restaurant. Luckily we came here early on a rainy and cold Sunday morning so there was no line or crowd. I can't wait to return soon for more!",4.0
"My friend and I made the journey all the way to Red Hook one rainy day. We wandered the streets with zero idea of where we were because Google Maps decided to be unhelpful that day. After finally finding the store, we started to get really hungry. The store where you buy is this tiny place and the building next to it is set up cafeteria style where you can eat. Anways, we each got a lobster roll, fries, and shared a key lime pie. Everything was DELICIOUS. One of the best lobster rolls. Only downside is the place took me almost 2 hours to get there... I'll have to make do with going to Smorgasborg and eating it there. (which I did a few weeks later) DELICIOUS. My favorite lobster roll in New York.",5.0
"Maybe it's my fault. I had outsize expectations for a lobster roll from Red Hook, Brooklyn thinking it would be comparable to something I've eaten in Maine or Connecticut ( I mean the roll I got was called the Connecticut), but it just wasn't.The bun had way too much butter on it turning the bread into goop, the lobster was limp and flavorless. The best part of my meal was the chips and soda. I won't be back.",2.0
"Definitely four stars for the service.  After my previous review, the owner/manager contacted me and did a really good job of correcting the situation.  She gave me a certificate to try the Connecticut roll again and this time the lobster meat was measured and prepared properly with ample lobster meat throughout the bun. The employees were also very friendly and attentive.  Still no tail meat but a lot of claw and leg meat none the less.  It tasted good but compared to Maine and other lobster roll spots up and down the east coast, it would be considered middle of the pack but probably the best quality in NYC.",4.0
"The food is good, don't get me wrong - but their lobsters are from Canada.  I recently purchased 5 of the yummy crawlers and found ""Wild Lobster Product of Canada"" rubber bands on their claws.  I wrote the folks on their facebook page and they told me to follow up on their store email. No response.I don't mind paying more to support a local business, but don't go and tell everyone that you drive every day to Maine to get the freshest products, that you are directly supporting local Maine fishemen and then sell me overpriced lobster from Canada - just like everyone else.  Not cool, Lobster Pound.  Not cool.",2.0
This place is unique and Awsome one of the best lobster rolls in the city I'm a lobster roll junkie and I'm going around the city trying them all out. Red Hook You order on one side then go next door to sit and enjoy your food.

"Honestly, who needs to go to New England to experience fresh, amazing lobster when you've got Red Hook Lobster Pound in Brooklyn?!?  Not I.  That first bite of the Maine Style Lobster sandwich, made me feel in my bones, that I was somewhere on the tip of the oceans in Rockland, enjoying the best catch of the day.  Granted these were Maine lobsters, I was still transfixed.  The white bread is slightly toasted with some charring on the outside, but soft like marshmellow when you bite into it.  Along with that soft texture of the bread is the buttery and cool snap of the steamed lobster flesh, tenderly dressed in mayo and other magical seasonings happening in these vats at RHLP.  Paired with a crisp pickle, a bag of cape cod chips and a bottle of lemon lime soda, this was by far the highlight of my Red Hook Food Tour.The CT-style roll is served warm with butter and no mayo.  I tried a bite of it, but quickly realized that a cold lobster sandwich befits my palate a bit more.  Another popular item here is their whoopie pie.  This chocolately-goodness was the main draw for a couple friend of mine who decided to pass on the lobster, but shared (and dominated) a whoopie pie.  I didn't try any as I was way too stuffed (and needed room for the ""swingle"" experience that was to occur shortly after), but it sure looked pretty (damn) good.The lobster roll will set you back about $18 with the drink, but look at all the money you'd be saving if you nixed that lobster trip to Maine and just stick to good ol' BK.  You'd be having lobster sandwiches all summer long.",5.0

I've also been to the truck when it's in Park Slope on Saturdays but the portions seem a bit smaller there.

So all these restaurants had a booth with their logo and menu. So when I saw that Red Hook was there and saw their prices I was HIGHLY hesitant so I shared a $16 Lobster Roll Connecticut Style with my friend. That was literally the only way I was going to afford that. hahaha However it was so delicious and warm but I wish they did something with the bun, maybe toasted it or added a little butter too. I don't know but the lobster was definetly the hero and made that roll work.Conclusion:I wouldn't mind tasting that lobster roll again! I wish I got to try that organic limeade they had as well.

"I finally went to the lobster pound in Red Hook. I'm sorry but nothing special there. Way to far to go for a Lobster roll that's O.K. The reason why I say it's just O.K. is because they skimp on the amount of lobster you get. They put the lobster on a bed of lettuce in the roll. Really..... Why? You say I should ask? To save on the amount of lobster you get. It's like an Illusion, that works. It looks and feels like your getting a nice size lobster roll. The lettuce is nothing more than a filler. That's why I gave it two stars.  I felt cheated out of my money. If you have to have a lobster roll fix, Luke's is way better. You get a generous portion of lobster. No lettuce there. IF YOU WANT THE BEST AND TASTIEST LOBSTER ROLL  IN NYC  go to Lobster House in City Island.  NOW THAT'S WORTH THE TRIP! It cost a little more but you get fresh fried potato chips with the roll. So good. Oh did I mentioned the view? I don't mind sharing my secrets with the world when I have a great experience. Red Hook is off the beaten path, but certainly worth a visit for a day. They have good restaurants and bars. I suggest to do some research and plan ahead of time. I will return to red hook but it won't be to the lobster pound.  I happen to stumble across a wonderful art gallery called Brooklyn WaterFront Artist Coalition.

"Lobster roll lovers--this is the place.  I love that they have Connecticut style (warm meat, melted butter, grilled roll) lobster rolls as an alternative to mayo.  They also have a Tuscan with vinaigrette.  I grew up in Boston and I know lobster.  The ONLY kind of roll to use is a grilled New England Style roll.  Check.  The only filling acceptable is large chunks including some claws.  Check.  Minimal sauce.  Check.  It's 16 bucks and worth it.  It's out of the way, sure, but worth the drive.  It's a little odd that the dining room has a separate exterior entrance from the place where you order, but it adds to the funkiness.  To give them five stars I would need a water view.",4.0
"The Maine style lobster roll was great, and at $16 is a real value considering how much lobster they pile in. The roll was buttery, crispy and delicious. The fries were also really good.

"I've been here several times and the lobsters are meaty, cooked perfectly, and worth the 30 minute walk from the train station... until today we though. I showed up with a friend today and we were pissed to see the place closed. I called and snapped at them for not updating their Yelp post. A minute later while my friend and I were still standing outside, searching for another place to have lunch, lady walked out and asked if we had just called and that she wanted to give us gift certificates for a lobster roll for the inconvenience. Already, my friend and I felt a bit sheepish but were thankful for the gesture. And then the owners appeared and told us that it was impossible for them to close the hours on their Yelp post without appearing to be permanently closed and that they were closed because of the damages done by hurricane Sandy. :XThe gift certificates were not necessary and Michelle and I felt like ignoramus idiots for only remembering then that Red Hook was submerged in water during the devastation.

The lobster Mac and cheese was disgusting; I was digging to find lobster, the Mac and cheese had a very peppery taste compared to a savory and cheesy taste which comes with a proper Mac and cheese.Corn was nothing special regular corn.Ill stick with Luke's.",2.0
Put a Maine roll in your face immediately.Avoid the lemonade. Too sweet.,5.0
"Make sure you eat it immediately before the bread gets soaked from the water? from the lobster roll. Bread is nicely toasted, but it is not a hot dog roll, just plain toasted bread. Yes, they actually do give a lot of lobster meat but it lacked a lot of flavor. It was nice that my roll was stuffed with lobster meat but without the seasoning and such it doesn't taste as good.

The lobster roll is pretty amazing. The lobster is so tender and sweet. My only gripe is that it is too small. I could easily down 3-4 of these but it is too pricey to actually do that. I'm definitely glad I tried it. My daughter liked the fries and corn. Yum.,4.0
"I was biking past Madison Square Park today and I noticed the ""Eat at Madison Sq. Park"" booths, so I stopped by. I decided to make my way to the Red Hook Lobster Pound booth and ordered a Maine style lobster roll. Granted, I'm still new to lobster rolls (only had about 3 before this), but this is the best lobster roll I've ever eaten.First, the lobster was outstanding - nice big chunks of lobster, cooked perfectly - not chewy or rubbery at all. The lemon mayo it was dressed in was just enough to compliment the lobster without overpowering it.

"Blackboard eats recently had a 30% off deal for up to six people at Red Hook Lobster Pound.  It was the perfect excuse for me to finally get my hands on one of the more famous lobster rolls in NYC.   The crazy out of the way trek to the hard to reach Red Hook neighborhood in Brooklyn won't be enough of a deterrent to keep me away this time. I love deals.  Woot woot. Walking into the place, it was interesting to find that the ordering area and the dining area is in a separate part of the building with it's own door.  You order, walk out with the food and walk into the building next door to eat in.  This should make it fun in the rain and/or winter.They have giant containers in the ordering area filled with live lobsters.  Besides plucking the lobsters strait from the ocean, I don't think you could get fresher lobsters than that.  I could taste the freshness in the generous helping of buttery soft lobster meat in the Connecticut styled roll that I ordered.  What is the Connecticut style? Their version is a simple warm lobster roll with only lobster meat, butter, bits of celery and lettuce greens, all inside a  sandwich bun that have been grilled with another generous helping of butter.  It was delicious. As with most lobster rolls, if you are hungry, you might find the lobster roll a bit small and it might not be enough to fill you up without ordering more food.  I rank this lobster roll right behind Luke's Lobster (which also makes them Connecticut style) for Lobster Rolls in NYC.  It's a very close second place. Red Hook Lobster Pound also serve the rolls Maine style with mayo and served cold.  Can't say anything about that version since our whole group ordered the Connecticut style.  I'll be back to try the Maine one some day. The lobster roll order was accompanied by some plain flavored Cape Cod kettle cooked chips that were OK.  I wish that they had a choice of flavors besides the plain one and salt and vinegar to choose from.  Plain is just so.... plain. What I wouldn't do for some jalapeño flavored or BBQ flavored chips.If the place is too out of the way (as is the case for most NYers including me), they sell these lobster rolls at the Brooklyn Flea, and during the warmer months they have a stand set up right next to the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory by Pier 1. They also seem to participate in a lot of the food events around NYC.  But if you could somehow make the long trek to the Red Hook restaurant, I suggest that you do that instead of going to their satellite locations.  After all, this is where they make the lobster meat before sending it out to the other locations.  If you want the freshest food.  Go to the source.",4.0
"Delicious! My girlfriend and I swung by here after seeing them at Smorgasburg the day before (we were too full from brunch to take down a whole lobster roll)...it's reasonably close to the Ikea, so it makes for a useful excuse to trek over and grab a roll. It was quick to get our order (took about 5 minutes), and you have a bunch of seating, picnic-table style, if you walk over next door. The only downside about the whole place was that the people working there seemed to be a bit unhappy/quiet, which is quite a contrast to the people I encountered at Luke's.As for the food itself - I can't complain. I'd have to have Luke's again to properly judge, but the roll here (which I got Connecticut-style, warm with butter) was absolutely delicious. I'm a huge fan of the lobster-style rolls, which are soft and warm and chewy...they should make French toast out of the same kind of bread. The lobster meat itself was fresh and juicy, just like lobster shipped down the same day from Maine should be. The clam chowder was alright - not the best I've had, but definitely in the upper echelon of the kind you can usually score in New York.All in all, an absolutely delicious experience that I'd be happy to repeat. The atmosphere was the only thing that was a bit of a downer - quiet with employees who looked like they would rather be elsewhere - but the food was top-notch.",5.0
"Their lobster rolls are delicious and worth venturing out to Brooklyn for. The price may be expensive, but if you are not planning to eat this every single day I think a little splurge is ok.

"Lobster rolls are a popular sandwich in NYC as of late by way of the New England states.  I enjoy lobster.  So a few weeks ago I decided to give Red Hook a try with SL and SC to see what all the hype was about...The location is in the middle of nowhere in Brooklyn.  Once you get off the BQE, it's pretty straight forward to get there.  However you drive through a very industrial area to get the the pound....When we arrived, we ordered in the main room to the left and then had to transport our food to the dining room to the right.  We had SL guarding our food as we made the trips back and forth: yelp.com/biz_photos/nOjG…They have a spacious and clean dining room with about 6 tables.  Here's what we ordered...1.  Connecticut Rolls with lobster, butter, and scallions for $16:yelp.com/biz_photos/nOjG…The meat used was pretty much all fatty claw meat which was very sweet.  Coupled with the nicely buttered roll, it was a a very TASTY sandwich.  However i found it small for the price.  As for the pickle, it was very good while the chips were just chips to me.   2.  Maine lobster roll + pickle + cape cod chips for $16:yelp.com/biz_photos/nOjG…SJ ordered this sandwich and she found it to be too dry and chewy.  From the looks of it, Connecticut looks like the way to go.  She also enjoyed the accompanying pickle.  3.  Downeast Bisque with Lobster, Clams, Shrimp and Haddock with a kick for $7:yelp.com/biz_photos/nOjG…I found the soup to be nice with a fair amount of seafood.  It was a bit salty, but I personally didn't mind as I enjoy salty food.4.  shrimp and corn chowder (i think) for $6yelp.com/biz_photos/nOjG…Same 5.  new england clam chowder for $7yelp.com/biz_photos/nOjG…SameSummary:  Red Hook Lobster pound serves good food, but it's not filling and is very expensive.  The hype is somewhat warranted, but I don't really see it...",3.0

You can order the rolls 1 of 2 ways: 1) Maine Style (cold w/light mayo) 2) Connecticut Style (warm w/drizzled butter). The Maine Style is very refreshing and light...a good unexpected surprise. The Connecticut Style is a bit heavier most likely because of the butter and for some reason made me feel very lethargic after consuming the roll. I would recommend the OG style - Maine.Each roll goes for a solid $15 and in my opinion is worth every penny.Also, right when you walk in there are 2 HUGE tubs filled with lobster that you can taunt. Open, close, open, close...open, close.If you haven't had a heart attack after finishing the roll, walk down the street to Baked and try their infamous vanilla cupcake with a cup o' joe.",4.0
"Like so many others, my bf and I finally made the trek here thanks to Blackboard Eats.  It was a great excuse to visit some friends in Red Hook, and the lobster rolls definitely make the list of Reasons I Understand Why People Would Live So Far From Public Transportation.  Yum!!  I am disgusted by mayo and at most places (yes, I've even done it in Maine), I have to ask them to use butter instead.  I usually feel like I'm breaking some sort of lobster roll code, so I was very happy to see the mayo-free Connecticut style roll (warm lobster slathered in butter) on the menu here.  The lobster bisque was delicious too, and even the Maine root beer was a treat.  The 30% BBE coupon was awesome, but I would have paid full price for the meal - it was that good.  Everyone seemed very happy with their Maine-style rolls too, and crab corn chowder.  The setup is definitely quirky, as you have to order on one side and then go outside to get to the picnic table room next door, but it was cuter than I imagined and reminded our group of six of a family backyard or basement.   The one girl working was super nice and helpful, and if she picked the music that was playing in the picnic room, she did an awesome job: a great mix of rock like Velvet Underground, The Dead, Wilco and Cream.  Even though they closed at 9, we sat happily drinking until almost 10 before anyone came in to start cleaning - and even then nobody actually told us to leave.  It was a perfect casual, delicious dinner.  Note: They don't serve alcohol, and nowhere on their website or anywhere does it say BYOB, but we definitely had no problem bringing our own beer.They were out of clam chowder but from what I hear, it is insanely epic.  I can't wait to go back and try it.",4.0
"Light as a feather. Light as a feather. That's surprisingly how I felt after having the Main Style Lobster roll for $16. Yes, a dent in my pocket book, but well worth it. You can either go for a:- Maine Style Lobster : A butter-inflused roll with lobster w/ a touch of mayo and celery. The may was not particularly heavy or overpowering. Overall, this was very good and the lobster was fresh!- Connecticut Roll: I did not have this but the description says its a  roll with lobster and butter. Also there is also plenty of seating next door with picnic style benches.",4.0

"Blackboard eats recently had a 30% off deal for up to six people at Red Hook Lobster Pound.  It was the perfect excuse for me to finally get my hands on one of the more famous lobster rolls in NYC.   The crazy out of the way trek to the hard to reach Red Hook neighborhood in Brooklyn won't be enough of a deterrent to keep me away this time. I love deals.  Woot woot. Walking into the place, it was interesting to find that the ordering area and the dining area is in a separate part of the building with it's own door.  You order, walk out with the food and walk into the building next door to eat in.  This should make it fun in the rain and/or winter.They have giant containers in the ordering area filled with live lobsters.  Besides plucking the lobsters strait from the ocean, I don't think you could get fresher lobsters than that.  I could taste the freshness in the generous helping of buttery soft lobster meat in the Connecticut styled roll that I ordered.  What is the Connecticut style? Their version is a simple warm lobster roll with only lobster meat, butter, bits of celery and lettuce greens, all inside a  sandwich bun that have been grilled with another generous helping of butter.  It was delicious. As with most lobster rolls, if you are hungry, you might find the lobster roll a bit small and it might not be enough to fill you up without ordering more food.  I rank this lobster roll right behind Luke's Lobster (which also makes them Connecticut style) for Lobster Rolls in NYC.  It's a very close second place. Red Hook Lobster Pound also serve the rolls Maine style with mayo and served cold.  Can't say anything about that version since our whole group ordered the Connecticut style.  I'll be back to try the Maine one some day. The lobster roll order was accompanied by some plain flavored Cape Cod kettle cooked chips that were OK.  I wish that they had a choice of flavors besides the plain one and salt and vinegar to choose from.  Plain is just so.... plain. What I wouldn't do for some jalapeño flavored or BBQ flavored chips.If the place is too out of the way (as is the case for most NYers including me), they sell these lobster rolls at the Brooklyn Flea, and during the warmer months they have a stand set up right next to the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory by Pier 1. They also seem to participate in a lot of the food events around NYC.  But if you could somehow make the long trek to the Red Hook restaurant, I suggest that you do that instead of going to their satellite locations.  After all, this is where they make the lobster meat before sending it out to the other locations.  If you want the freshest food.  Go to the source.",4.0
"Delicious! My girlfriend and I swung by here after seeing them at Smorgasburg the day before (we were too full from brunch to take down a whole lobster roll)...it's reasonably close to the Ikea, so it makes for a useful excuse to trek over and grab a roll. It was quick to get our order (took about 5 minutes), and you have a bunch of seating, picnic-table style, if you walk over next door. The only downside about the whole place was that the people working there seemed to be a bit unhappy/quiet, which is quite a contrast to the people I encountered at Luke's.As for the food itself - I can't complain. I'd have to have Luke's again to properly judge, but the roll here (which I got Connecticut-style, warm with butter) was absolutely delicious. I'm a huge fan of the lobster-style rolls, which are soft and warm and chewy...they should make French toast out of the same kind of bread. The lobster meat itself was fresh and juicy, just like lobster shipped down the same day from Maine should be. The clam chowder was alright - not the best I've had, but definitely in the upper echelon of the kind you can usually score in New York.All in all, an absolutely delicious experience that I'd be happy to repeat. The atmosphere was the only thing that was a bit of a downer - quiet with employees who looked like they would rather be elsewhere - but the food was top-notch.",5.0
"Their lobster rolls are delicious and worth venturing out to Brooklyn for. The price may be expensive, but if you are not planning to eat this every single day I think a little splurge is ok.

"5 star rating because this is the best lobster roll in NYC. The Red Hook Lobster Pound is awesome! They offer 3 styles of rolls. First is the Maine style ($16), which is the cold mayo filled lobster roll, second is CT style($16), warm and buttery and third is the lobster BLT($10), good but served with a smaller amount of lobster. All lobster rolls are stuffed with a lot of lobster meat! The New England Chowder is pretty good as well. Rich and full of meaty pieces of seafood.

"They serve up a delicious lobster well worth the trip to Red Hook to seek out.  A mere $15 will land you an authentic roll, a bag of Cape Cod potato chips, and a delicious pickle.  The roll itself is a hot dog bun fully toasted on the outside (presumably with the addition of butter) and sliced deeply along the top.  The slit holds tasty, massive chunks of lobster meat largely intact.  The meat is minimally dressed with a scant use of mayonnaise and, I think, a hit of paprika.  Celery shavings top this wonderful creation so as to provide a nice contrast of texture.  For a little extra, you can wash everything down with Maine Root Soda -- a must.  The place itself is separated into two distinct parts.  In the main section, you place your order.  The space is cramped and it is clearly set up for takeout orders.  Fortunately, you can have your meal next door in the other section.  There you will find several picnic tables in a nautical themed room.  It's very kickback, relaxed, with no hint of pretense.  Just a simple place to enjoy your summer food on a nice summer day.  Overall, their lobster roll is the real thing, just like you would find in the lobster shacks along the Maine coast.  The only place in the city with a roll of comparable quality is Luke's.  I really rate them equally.  They are both fantastic.4.5 stars",4.0

"My review is based solely on the lobster roll that i got from the mobile Red Hook Lobster Pound food truck.I ordered the ME style lobster roll for $16. The lobster roll looked a bit smaller than the ones i get from the UES Luke's Lobster restaurant. The buttered roll was toasted to perfect and it was buttery goodness. I felt my arteries clogging right away. The lobster claw piece was big and it was dusted with some red powder which im assuming is old bay seasoning. However, the rest of my roll was a disappointment. The rest of the lobster meat was shredded. I do not like my lobster meat to be shredded so that was a huge disappointment. The scallions added a nice texture contrast. I didn't really taste the celery. The mayo wasn't overpowering. Overall, the lobster roll was okay. It wasn't great. It's better than the urban lobster shack, but i still prefer Luke's Lobster. I will update my review once I try the CT version of the lobster roll.",3.0
"It's not that it's not good- it's that it's not ""that"" good.  Another locale benefitting from the Brooklyn hype-machine conglomerate.The lobster roll is packed with fresh lobster, but it lacks any ingredients that might make it come to life- not that you literally want your lobster roll to come to life (Zombie roll?) but you know what I mean.The setting feels New England-ish, but there's nothing particularly fun about it.  There's no alcohol or anything- people seem to ride the lightning of this root beer they serve.  Seriously?  Root beer?  This excited you?The chips are a brand you can get in the store.The lobster macaroni and cheese is good- but I didn't write sonnets about it on my iPhone as I ignored the person I was there with.I don't know- I'd say it's worth the 2 hour drive to Montauk to get a Lobster Roll more than saddling up to this place to get your fix.",2.0

Each came with a pickle and potato chips.  They were prepared with care.  Making sure gloves were used during preparation and gloves off when handling payments.  Whew!We all sat outside to enjoy our rolls. Mine was the Maine style roll which was a perfectly dressed (not too heavy on mayo) and bread grilled with butter.  The first bite and each bite after was sublime.  We were all smiling and nodding head in approval. One of my friends even teared up and laughed at the same time (true story)! It was pure bliss! I've had a fair amount of lobster roll and this is one of the best based on price, quality and taste.I would definitely come back here to have the Maine lobster roll AND order me one of those Connecticut badboys.P.S.

Good lobster roll but still quite pricey.  I like that they had a seating area.  I like both the Maine style lobster roll (cold w/ Mayo) and Connecticut (Lobster & butter).  The Connecticut style was more filling because you can really smell the butter which goes great with lobster.  The Maine style was more like a salad.I would highly recommend the ginger soft drink.  It really packs a punch.  I tried buying my own lobster and making it and it came quite close (at least I thought it did).,4.0

"I only have one other lobster roll to compare this one to (Jordan Lobster Farm's in Island Park), but this one was significantly smaller and blander.  I was really surprised by the small size and lack of mayo.  For the same price i paid at jordan's which includes chips and cole slaw, i got less than half the amount of meat..  i really hope this isn't what the rest of the lobster rolls in nyc look like.",2.0
"Absolutely worth the trek!  Okay, just take the B61 over to Red Hook.  It is a memorable sandwich.  Sprinkled with sliced scallions, cold fleshy lobster meat squished into a hot dog bun lathered in butter.  There are condiments offered to go with your roll such as lemon-line sauce, mustard, and salt & pepper.  Now, just in case you are confused and visiting for the first time.  Your purchase is conducted in the left side and then eating ensues on the right side.  I did not realize this and actually had a moment of confusion, but never to fear, the lobster is here!  I got the Blueberry Maine soda which tasted like real blueberries.  So happy was I!  That is right!  It is just heavenly.  Go and try it!",5.0
"My review is based solely on the lobster roll that i got from the mobile Red Hook Lobster Pound food truck.I ordered the ME style lobster roll for $16. The lobster roll looked a bit smaller than the ones i get from the UES Luke's Lobster restaurant. The buttered roll was toasted to perfect and it was buttery goodness. I felt my arteries clogging right away. The lobster claw piece was big and it was dusted with some red powder which im assuming is old bay seasoning. However, the rest of my roll was a disappointment. The rest of the lobster meat was shredded. I do not like my lobster meat to be shredded so that was a huge disappointment. The scallions added a nice texture contrast. I didn't really taste the celery. The mayo wasn't overpowering. Overall, the lobster roll was okay. It wasn't great. It's better than the urban lobster shack, but i still prefer Luke's Lobster. I will update my review once I try the CT version of the lobster roll.",3.0
"It's not that it's not good- it's that it's not ""that"" good.  Another locale benefitting from the Brooklyn hype-machine conglomerate.The lobster roll is packed with fresh lobster, but it lacks any ingredients that might make it come to life- not that you literally want your lobster roll to come to life (Zombie roll?) but you know what I mean.The setting feels New England-ish, but there's nothing particularly fun about it.  There's no alcohol or anything- people seem to ride the lightning of this root beer they serve.  Seriously?  Root beer?  This excited you?The chips are a brand you can get in the store.The lobster macaroni and cheese is good- but I didn't write sonnets about it on my iPhone as I ignored the person I was there with.I don't know- I'd say it's worth the 2 hour drive to Montauk to get a Lobster Roll more than saddling up to this place to get your fix.",2.0

Each came with a pickle and potato chips.  They were prepared with care.  Making sure gloves were used during preparation and gloves off when handling payments.  Whew!We all sat outside to enjoy our rolls. Mine was the Maine style roll which was a perfectly dressed (not too heavy on mayo) and bread grilled with butter.  The first bite and each bite after was sublime.  We were all smiling and nodding head in approval. One of my friends even teared up and laughed at the same time (true story)! It was pure bliss! I've had a fair amount of lobster roll and this is one of the best based on price, quality and taste.I would definitely come back here to have the Maine lobster roll AND order me one of those Connecticut badboys.P.S.

my first lobster roll EVARRR! (@ madison square eats) $16 for a tiny tiny roll.

"First things First:  If not for the lobster roll, pay the $15 for the experience and food.   If you don't want soggy bread, ask them to separate the meat and the roll. They will. Pros:  LOTS of Lobster Meat. I think it's called Lobster Pound because they pile a POUND of meat onto that itty bitty bun.  While standing in that MASSIVE line, make sure you talk/network with people.  People walk blocks to get to the lobster truck, it makes the time go by fast and you never know who you'll meet.  I met a guy who just has an affinity for food.  We talked about the different types of food we like and suggested the best places to each other for that particular type of food.  It seemed the line moved too fast for us to finish our conversation. For $15-$18 (meal), it's a pretty good deal.  Especially considering there are a number of places around that you can visit for lunch--and they charge almost the same amount, for the same amount of food, but with lesser quality.  You can spend $10 easy on a lunch that's decent and made to order.  An extra $5 for a pound of lobster piled onto a buttered bun is not unreasonable.  And an extra $3 for the meal ($1.50 Cape Cod Chips/$1.50 AMAZING soda with Really Cool Options) isn't bad either.I bought the meal ($18) and I'm full.  I can't even think about dinner right now.  I may just skip out on dinner altogether or eat something light. (Something to think about--it definitely fills you up!)The Maine Root Beer soda is what I chose and I finished it before I got back to my building.  It was THAT good. CONS: The line and the wait.   Either you get my money or you get my time, not both.  As someone waiting ahead of me said, ""This is a perfectly stupid-fun thing to do."" Couldn't have said it better myself. I ordered a Connecticut style roll but got Maine style.  For $15, someone should listen enough to know exactly what I ordered.  That's a draw back because points are deducted from service.  I was given regular chips.  I thought they had a choice, it wasn't until I got to my desk did I realize I was given regular chips.  I hope they were out of the salt and vinegar chips, because I would have never requested regular chips.  Any regular flavored potato chip has never been seen in my presence until this day. :-/The roll has SO MUCH lobster in it, I decided I've had enough of it and that it's not my favorite.  I now prefer crab.  The Crabby Truck has great Crab Sandwiches by the way.  :) ____________________________________All in all, I would not eat here again but if I had to do it over I would still go.  It's unwise to spend a lot of time and money in once place, you will do both at the lobster truck.  Great experience, had random conversation about good food around the city. Try it and if you find lobster isn't your thing, the Crabby Truck is AWESOME!",4.0
"Lobster ain't my thing, but I would say that I did enjoy the lobster roll from Red Hook Lobster Pound.For about $17, I got it Maine style, which meant it was served cold. You get a ton of lobster meat. However, I was a bit disappointed that my roll came out very sloppy. I think they might have put too much sauce or gotten too much of the lobster juices, so my bun was falling apart, and I had to eat the bun and lobster meat separately, while my friends enjoyed theirs whole.I definitely prefer Red Hook's lobster rolls over Luke's because I find Luke's to be too rich. Red Hook has the perfect amount of richness to it, which made eating it refreshing (although you may still find your cholesterol through the roof after downing one). I liked how they garnish it with the green onions. It gave it the extra oomph that a lobster roll needs.I probably won't eat another lobster roll again. For $17, I think I would rather get something else, and lobster rolls are something I do not crave. But if you're a lobster fan, Red Hook is the perfect place to get your fix.",4.0
Waited 1 hour after placing an order for 2 lobster rolls.. Lobster rolls were fresh but lacked flavor.. This place is simply overrated. Anyone can put large amounts of lobster pieces on a bun and get a 4 star rating. Want a perfect lobster roll? Just go to Luke's lobster,1.0

"I went with two friends last week and because we had a special 30% discount coupon through Blackboard Eats, we decided to order ten different items (yes, you read that right, we were pigging out big time!).  We had three different types of lobster rolls, including one they called a lobster BLT that was phenomenal with a slightly smoky chipotle mayo sauce and excellent slabs of bacon.  We also had the lobster mac 'n cheese (another real hit) and the most delicious sweet potato fries I have ever had.  Then we had homemade whoopie pies and key lime tartlets for dessert.  The lady who helped us said that they offer a special  lobster dinner for $20 on Wednesday that comes with 2 or 3 sides.  I love lobster,but because I live in Manhattan, I usually end up at Luke's Lobster, but I think this place is better.",5.0
"Thanks to a tip from Matteo, I knew I had to go here.  In fact I made a trip here (from Queens) merely one week after hearing about it.  We ordered both versions, quickly took our photos and scarfed it down!  Yes, it was everything I had hoped it would be - chunky fresh lobsters, toasty bread and just the slightest touch of butter/mayo.  I wish I could have eaten it slower to truly taste the flavor but I couldn't help it.  No worries, I'm sure I'll be back very soon.  I loved the pickle but could have done without the chips.  Oh my friend preferred the Connecticut version while I stayed true to the Maine; but honestly both tasted wonderful.Seriously, who needs to travel all the way up to Maine?",5.0

my first lobster roll EVARRR! (@ madison square eats) $16 for a tiny tiny roll. Squeezed about 8 bites out of the roll...making each bite cost $2 -__- but the first words to come out of my mouth after my first bite: WORTH IT. yup. no regrets! found a nice little slice of pickle under the roll. scoooooore.,4.0
"First things First:  If not for the lobster roll, pay the $15 for the experience and food.   If you don't want soggy bread, ask them to separate the meat and the roll. They will. Pros:  LOTS of Lobster Meat. I think it's called Lobster Pound because they pile a POUND of meat onto that itty bitty bun.  While standing in that MASSIVE line, make sure you talk/network with people.  People walk blocks to get to the lobster truck, it makes the time go by fast and you never know who you'll meet.  I met a guy who just has an affinity for food.  We talked about the different types of food we like and suggested the best places to each other for that particular type of food.  It seemed the line moved too fast for us to finish our conversation. For $15-$18 (meal), it's a pretty good deal.  Especially considering there are a number of places around that you can visit for lunch--and they charge almost the same amount, for the same amount of food, but with lesser quality.  You can spend $10 easy on a lunch that's decent and made to order.  An extra $5 for a pound of lobster piled onto a buttered bun is not unreasonable.  And an extra $3 for the meal ($1.50 Cape Cod Chips/$1.50 AMAZING soda with Really Cool Options) isn't bad either.I bought the meal ($18) and I'm full.  I can't even think about dinner right now.  I may just skip out on dinner altogether or eat something light. (Something to think about--it definitely fills you up!)The Maine Root Beer soda is what I chose and I finished it before I got back to my building.  It was THAT good. CONS: The line and the wait.   Either you get my money or you get my time, not both.  As someone waiting ahead of me said, ""This is a perfectly stupid-fun thing to do."" Couldn't have said it better myself. I ordered a Connecticut style roll but got Maine style.  For $15, someone should listen enough to know exactly what I ordered.  That's a draw back because points are deducted from service.  I was given regular chips.  I thought they had a choice, it wasn't until I got to my desk did I realize I was given regular chips.  I hope they were out of the salt and vinegar chips, because I would have never requested regular chips.  Any regular flavored potato chip has never been seen in my presence until this day. :-/The roll has SO MUCH lobster in it, I decided I've had enough of it and that it's not my favorite.  I now prefer crab.  The Crabby Truck has great Crab Sandwiches by the way.  :) ____________________________________All in all, I would not eat here again but if I had to do it over I would still go.  It's unwise to spend a lot of time and money in once place, you will do both at the lobster truck.  Great experience, had random conversation about good food around the city. Try it and if you find lobster isn't your thing, the Crabby Truck is AWESOME!",4.0
"Lobster ain't my thing, but I would say that I did enjoy the lobster roll from Red Hook Lobster Pound.For about $17, I got it Maine style, which meant it was served cold. You get a ton of lobster meat. However, I was a bit disappointed that my roll came out very sloppy. I think they might have put too much sauce or gotten too much of the lobster juices, so my bun was falling apart, and I had to eat the bun and lobster meat separately, while my friends enjoyed theirs whole.I definitely prefer Red Hook's lobster rolls over Luke's because I find Luke's to be too rich. Red Hook has the perfect amount of richness to it, which made eating it refreshing (although you may still find your cholesterol through the roof after downing one). I liked how they garnish it with the green onions. It gave it the extra oomph that a lobster roll needs.I probably won't eat another lobster roll again. For $17, I think I would rather get something else, and lobster rolls are something I do not crave. But if you're a lobster fan, Red Hook is the perfect place to get your fix.",4.0
Waited 1 hour after placing an order for 2 lobster rolls.. Lobster rolls were fresh but lacked flavor.. This place is simply overrated. Anyone can put large amounts of lobster pieces on a bun and get a 4 star rating. Want a perfect lobster roll? Just go to Luke's lobster,1.0

"It's a toss up between Red Hook Lobster Pound and Luke's Lobster for best lobster roll.This place is definitely out of the way though, so it's not as easy for the mass NYC crowds to get to, but if you can make it over, it's worth the trek.  Definitely fresh and delicious, and what's great is that there is a picnic style seating area next door where you can enjoy your meal.  At Luke's, unless you're one of the lucky 6 people who get a seat, you're still eating over a counter, and not at a table.  For a big groups, try to make it here.The lobster roll comes in 2 ways: Maine and Connecticut.  The Maine style is your typical lobster roll, served cold in a bun.  I opted for the Connecticut style, which is served hot w/o mayo.  I loved it, but unless you eat it fast, the bread can get kinda soggy.  I didn't have really have a problem with that, as I scarfed mine up in like 2 minutes.And the people working here are so friendly!  No matter how great food tastes, if I get bad service, the most I'll give is 4 stars, but the extra friendly service is worth .5 in my book :)",5.0

But she was cool and even talked about the upcoming plans.  They plan on serving lobster rolls soon as they settle in.  For now it's sold @ Brooklyn Flea and Lobster Dinner night at a local Red Hook restaurant.Her husband travels to Maine weekly and fills the huge tanks of ""Lively Beauties"" which you can see by the store front window.  BFF & I asked for 1-1/2 lbs lobster each.  Followed by 1/2 lbs crab claws.  Since the long journey back to Manhattan she carefully packed/insulated full of ice and even asked if I knew how to eat them?!  Well, she must not have heard... I am an Expert on eating ALL things Seafood?  Especially, crustaceans!!  I can sit for hours and usually the last person to finish.  I don't need silly gadgets just give me a cleaver and I'll be fine :-)Cooking time:I asked her way on cooking:  She said about yay high (4"") use sea salt, rapid boil and then tail first, until red.  Once home, I immediately put the live lobsters into a ""sleeping mode""  by refrigerating them before cooking time.  *This is a humane way/opposed to throwing the live ones in boiling water*  Another humane way is to stab between the eye or place them on a baking pan with little water in the oven --Yes, I know this is not fun to hear but you want the meat to be tender -right? I followed her method and OMG  Perfect sweet, succulant --sinfully decadent!!!!On my table:  newspapers, ears of corn from the farmer's market, loads of cold brewskies, lime wedges, special Viet dipping sauce and paper towels.

At first I was a little hesitant about the price per roll ($16) but eventually my craving for lobster overpowered my financial sensibility (no news there). I chose the Connecticut style lobster roll since I've tried Maine style lobster rolls before, and my GOD was it delicious. The lobster was fresh and succulent, while the butter and lemon made it a perfect combination. I think it took more time for me to decide to buy the lobster roll than it did for me to finish eating it. Will definitely have to make the trip out to the Brooklyn location so I can try their lobster mac n cheese.",4.0

"Delicious - yes. Cheap - no.Per wikipedia, lobster used to be the offal of the regular catch, often used as fertilizer in New England. Indentured servants used to have clauses that restricted the number of times they could be fed this cockroach of the sea.Fast forward to today, where lobster can be bought for $11/lb at Freeway, then marked up to be served as a $25 dinner for 1.5 lbs. If that doesn't appeal to your taste, you can opt for the $16 lobster roll, which comes in warm & cold options so you feel like you're making a real choice above and beyond paying far too much for something that is far too little. Of course, they throw in a bag of crisps. For free.Note: Do make your way over to the promenade (by Fairway) to catch the sunset.",3.0
Yummy lobster rolls. I only tried the Maine but nxt time I will try the Connecticut one. My SIS liked the lobster mac and cheese but it wasn't seasoned and only relied on the strenght of the lobster 4 taste. Today alone I had this and Luke's and I think both are good but this one packed more flavor! But the buns at both places are Yumma!,5.0

"It's a toss up between Red Hook Lobster Pound and Luke's Lobster for best lobster roll.This place is definitely out of the way though, so it's not as easy for the mass NYC crowds to get to, but if you can make it over, it's worth the trek.  Definitely fresh and delicious, and what's great is that there is a picnic style seating area next door where you can enjoy your meal.  At Luke's, unless you're one of the lucky 6 people who get a seat, you're still eating over a counter, and not at a table.  For a big groups, try to make it here.The lobster roll comes in 2 ways: Maine and Connecticut.  The Maine style is your typical lobster roll, served cold in a bun.  I opted for the Connecticut style, which is served hot w/o mayo.  I loved it, but unless you eat it fast, the bread can get kinda soggy.  I didn't have really have a problem with that, as I scarfed mine up in like 2 minutes.And the people working here are so friendly!  No matter how great food tastes, if I get bad service, the most I'll give is 4 stars, but the extra friendly service is worth .5 in my book :)",5.0
"Just made it in the door before closing time... on a Sunday!The owner was in a great mood :-) She didn't seem to mind us at all (sneaking in minutes before closing) I felt bad seeing that they where at the flea market early on, on the hottest day :(  Her workers where unloading the van in lightening speed eager get home... But she was cool and even talked about the upcoming plans.  They plan on serving lobster rolls soon as they settle in.  For now it's sold @ Brooklyn Flea and Lobster Dinner night at a local Red Hook restaurant.Her husband travels to Maine weekly and fills the huge tanks of ""Lively Beauties"" which you can see by the store front window.  BFF & I asked for 1-1/2 lbs lobster each.  Followed by 1/2 lbs crab claws.  Since the long journey back to Manhattan she carefully packed/insulated full of ice and even asked if I knew how to eat them?!  Well, she must not have heard... I am an Expert on eating ALL things Seafood?  Especially, crustaceans!!  I can sit for hours and usually the last person to finish.  I don't need silly gadgets just give me a cleaver and I'll be fine :-)Cooking time:I asked her way on cooking:  She said about yay high (4"") use sea salt, rapid boil and then tail first, until red.  Once home, I immediately put the live lobsters into a ""sleeping mode""  by refrigerating them before cooking time.  *This is a humane way/opposed to throwing the live ones in boiling water*  Another humane way is to stab between the eye or place them on a baking pan with little water in the oven --Yes, I know this is not fun to hear but you want the meat to be tender -right? I followed her method and OMG  Perfect sweet, succulant --sinfully decadent!!!!On my table:  newspapers, ears of corn from the farmer's market, loads of cold brewskies, lime wedges, special Viet dipping sauce and paper towels. This was the Best Feast EVER!!! Tip:  The season goes all the way into November... so hurry up and go get some beauties.",5.0

Pearl oyster bar has flavorful rolls but they're too rich and have too much mayo. Luke's on the other hand, wasn't rich enough and didn't have enough mayo. Their rolls are too simple IMO and the bread did nothing for the lobster. Red Hook Lobster Pound is just right.",4.0
"The lobster rolls were good.  We tried one of each.  I am not a fan of mayo so I was happy to have the buttery CT option.  The corn on the cob was okay but definitely not the best.  But I LOVED the blueberry soda.  If you are a fan of blueberries, you will enjoy the blueberry soda.",3.0
"So good! Had a maine-style lobster roll at the brooklyn flea market for lunch. I thought $16 was a little steep but the portion of lobster was generous and they were top quality cuts (none of that rubbery claw ish).  The maine style was delicious-- I would've liked a touch more mayo but that's a personal gripe.  The bread was crunchy and soft at the same time, spread with just the right amount of butter.   The pieces of lobster were big and very flavorful. Yum!",4.0
"Heard they just re-opened after being wiped out by hurricane Sandy so I headed over there as soon as I could, anxious to sink my teeth in. Ordered a lobster roll and fries. No go on the fries as they had just gotten the approval permit and the frier wasn't up and running. Bummer for my palette. Excellent for my heath. Anyway the lobster roll was fantastic, heaping chunks of lobster meat, perfect amount of mayo and a soft bun, slightly toasted. Crunched on some salt n vinegar chips and washed it all down with ginger ale. Heck yeah, I'll be back. I need my fries!",5.0
"Came back to use the other GC deal I had (lobsters for 4).  Those were some large lobsters.  Seriously.  Very meaty.  Almost too much!  They definitely don't skimp here.  Make your way here if you like lobster!Also got the lobster mac & cheese.  You would think they'd skimp on the lobster, but no, not at all here at RHLP.  They HOOK IT UP.  I'm not even that big of a lobster fan (my gf loves it), and I even ate some lobster because there was so much.  Lobster rolls...legit.  That connecticut roll is divine.",4.0
"Got the CT roll as well as the Maine roll. The BF and I both liked the maine roll more. It was perfection! At first i was skeptical bc i knew it was gonna  be made from only the claw, which is the part i normally dont like when eating whole lobsters, but it was sweet & juicy and perfect. & Normally i don't even get excited about lobster...  The clam chowder was delicious as well. The lobster mac & cheese was ehh. We both didnt really like it. Perhaps it was the blend of cheese they used for it and we both thought it was too salty. But it did had big chunks of lobster in it. The order took a long time to be ready so they gave us a  free whoopie pie. Whoopie! & it was good too! Would come back once in a while (but not TOO often since $16 for a small roll isn't budget friendly)",4.0
"I would like to thank the event known as the Prospect Park Food Truck Rally for presenting the Red Hook Lobster Pound Truck to my list of culinary delights.  That Maine Style lobster roll was the truth!The bun, the lobster, the pickle, the mayo, the texture, the crunch factor, the presentation, the taste.....OMG!!  I wanted to make a u-turn in one way traffic just to get another one!  Next on the list....Connecticut Style!  As a matter of fact, damn the truck, I'm heading to the spot....uh, huh that's right!!!",5.0

And the chowder was very good too, big chunky pieces of clam, potatoes, bits of celery and herbs, a nice combination of taste and texture.I am also using this as an opportunity to implore all Yelpers to devote a certain amount of our reviews to service, after eating out for about 10 years in NY I'm finding good restaurant service lacking, especially in the last 2 years or so.

"yeah yeah, they have lobster rolls and lobster mac-and-cheese -- you know this already.  but what people seem to overlook is the lobster *dinner*: for $25 you get a whole 1.5 lb lobster, plucked from the tanks moments after you've ordered, plus corn-on-the-cob, cole slaw, and some of the tastiest potato salad i've ever had.  and sure, they don't serve booze, but they don't mind if you BYOB, so just bring some from home or go to the liquor store on the corner while they prepare your meal.  then grab one of the picnic tables (indoors, no need to fret about the cold weather), and about 10 minutes later, they'll bring your lobster feast to you.and then devour that lobster.they provide the proper equipment for cracking the shell, and bibs if you want them, and wetnaps.  i only wish there was a bathroom because i always really need to wash my hands when we're done.but really, there aren't many things that make me as happy as the lobster dinner does.  it's the deliciousness of fresh lobster combined with a casual dining environment so i don't have to feel bad about making a mess, and the BYOB-ness helps keep it a pretty reasonable dinner, all things considered.  i do love both varieties of their lobster rolls, but why spend $16 on something you'll finish in 5 minutes when you can spend $25 on a lobster dining extravaganza?i think i've made my case.",5.0
"Went with a friend whose wife recommended the place. Interestingly he thought that $15 for a lobster roll was too much, on the other hand I thought it was a bargain comparing to what people are paying at places like Ed's in Manhattan. The roll was toasted, drizzled with butter, and sprinkled with paprika. A perfect combination. And the chowder was very good too, big chunky pieces of clam, potatoes, bits of celery and herbs, a nice combination of taste and texture.I am also using this as an opportunity to implore all Yelpers to devote a certain amount of our reviews to service, after eating out for about 10 years in NY I'm finding good restaurant service lacking, especially in the last 2 years or so. But not at the Lobster Pound - the man behind the counter was as nice a guy as it gets.",4.0
"I am on a quest to find the best lobster roll in NYC and this rated highly. I had the Maine - cold with a bit of mayo. What I liked was that they did not overdo the mayo. My current favs are Mary's Fish Camp (though I feel like they could cut back the mayo a bit - roll is to die for), Pearl Oyster and Ditch Plains. And the Red Hook Lobster Pound.The service was down-home & friendy at the Lobster Pound, and since they don't have seating we walked to a nearby park overlooking the Statue of Liberty and ate picnic-style.",4.0

"While I live only twenty minutes away from Red Hook, it has taken me a year to finally drive over and give The Lobster Pound a try.  At around 4pm I was the only person there, I almost wanted to turn around, but then realized it's on a Friday, mid day, people are at work.  I place my order for a Main lobster roll with the friendly cashier and had my food ready in just less than five minutes.Actual sitting area to eat is next door which isn't very convenient, especially on a rainy day.Finally I set down, looked at my plate and was very pleased with what I saw.  Huge chunks of lobster meat, light mayo, chives and paprika.  Now my mouth started to salivate and biting in was the only thing left to do.  Mmmmm...delicious!!!  Fresh lobster meat, good flavor, light and the bread was almost better than the lobster itself. Bread was buttery, had right amount of softness and crunch to it.  Think of buttered toast bread on a grilled cheese sandwich.I do have couple of not so great points I'd like to state, but it's just a personal opinion.  While the roll is delicious, there isn't enough of it.  Lots of meat, too little bread, I was left hungry.  Bag of chips with only two options Regular or Salt & Vinegar was a little weak.  I wish they had more variety and especially BBQ flavored chips. At $16 dollars a roll, it's hard to justify buying two for one person, and one just isn't enough.  No doubt that someday I'll return when my lobster craving starts to haunt me.",4.0

"If there is anything in this world that I am qualified to comment on, it is without question cocktails, but if there's anything besides cocktails, it's lobster.  My grandma lives in Maine, and I've been going there every year for as long as I've been alive.  In those [redacted] years, I've eaten a lot of lobster.  I know lobster, I know lobster rolls, and I'm thrilled to report that the RHLP is the real deal.  The rolls are easily as good as anything I've had in Maine, probably because they're made with fresh Maine lobster--a generous helping of plump claw chunks tossed in the lightest imaginable mayo sauce, so really all you taste is that juicy fresh crustacean.  Oh, and then there's the matter of the beautifully buttered and grilled top-split buns.  And the fact that at $13, they're cheaper than some places in the state of Maine, and certainly cheaper than any other lobster roll in the metro-NY area!  Yes, the line is intimidating, but of all the things I've waited over an hour for in this fine city of line-waiting (DiFara's, Shake Shack, Clinton St Baking Co), this is by far the most worthwhile.  You just can't get a lobster roll this good for this price anywhere else in the city, whereas you CAN get tasty pizza, burgers, and brunch elsewhere.  And as if my life weren't awesome enough already, the RHLP stand at the DUMBO BK Flea is approximately 75 steps from my front door.  Pretty soon, I expect I'll be getting my frequent customer line-cutting SpeedPass (no, this does not actually exist.

"I'm not really a lobster kind of person...I usually go for crab...but, we trekked all the way to brooklyn flea to sample what had been touted as the #1 lobster roll in nyc.In all honesty?  I was pretty excited.  Luckily we arrived before the lunch rush.  For $15 you get your lobster roll (maine or connecticut style), a bag of chips and a pickle wedge.  Lobster roll is packed full of tender, juicy claw meat with a super light coating of mayo it's barely even there.  All is on a crispy buttery toasted bun (OMG soo yummy) and the chips compliment this roll perfectly.Once you have your food, head over to a nice shaded spot on the steps and dig in...It's a lot more filling than you'd think, so start off with one and then get another if you really have the room for it.  We tried maine style but maybe we'll go for connecticut style next time.",4.0
I have no qualms with this place whatsoever...one of the best lobster rolls I've had. They have two styles: Maine (lobster in mayo topped with scallions) and Connecticut (lobster dipped in butter topped with scallions and paprika)...big time prefer CT Style! You gotta try it. So delicious and fresh chunks of lobster meat including many claws.,5.0
Sweet mother of mary a m a z i n g . Pricey but worth it if you want to splurge. My bf and I shared a Maine Style lobster roll and root beer for $20. We weren't full but we weren't hungry either and can't wait to go back for more.  Well done!,5.0
"If there is anything in this world that I am qualified to comment on, it is without question cocktails, but if there's anything besides cocktails, it's lobster.  My grandma lives in Maine, and I've been going there every year for as long as I've been alive.  In those [redacted] years, I've eaten a lot of lobster.  I know lobster, I know lobster rolls, and I'm thrilled to report that the RHLP is the real deal.  The rolls are easily as good as anything I've had in Maine, probably because they're made with fresh Maine lobster--a generous helping of plump claw chunks tossed in the lightest imaginable mayo sauce, so really all you taste is that juicy fresh crustacean.  Oh, and then there's the matter of the beautifully buttered and grilled top-split buns.  And the fact that at $13, they're cheaper than some places in the state of Maine, and certainly cheaper than any other lobster roll in the metro-NY area!  Yes, the line is intimidating, but of all the things I've waited over an hour for in this fine city of line-waiting (DiFara's, Shake Shack, Clinton St Baking Co), this is by far the most worthwhile.  You just can't get a lobster roll this good for this price anywhere else in the city, whereas you CAN get tasty pizza, burgers, and brunch elsewhere.  And as if my life weren't awesome enough already, the RHLP stand at the DUMBO BK Flea is approximately 75 steps from my front door.  Pretty soon, I expect I'll be getting my frequent customer line-cutting SpeedPass (no, this does not actually exist. YET).",5.0
"Yummy LOBstah!!! Warm (Ct.) is my pref., warm butter versus cold mayo... Lobster Mac&Cheese is excellent. If you cycle into RedHook, order to go and pedal to the water (Valentino Pier, IKEA park, or Fairway picnic tables)... Skip RedHook Crabhouse, note RHLP supplies them their lobsters... And if you want a 1.5lb lobster dinner, there is a Wed. Special... Update : I now ask for light butter for the Ct. Roll as it can be way too soggy and overwhelming. Also, sadly there seems to be some taste inconsistency with the lobster since reopening. I also would like to see more tail and less claw in the rolls... at $17",4.0
"Loved everything about it--the focused concept, the plentiful chunks of outstanding lobster, and the no nonsense atmosphere. Tried the Conneticut roll and the Maine roll--found them equally delicious!! Just depends on if you want a warm (CT) or cool (Maine) sandwich.

"Noticed the RHLP storefront on Van Brunt Street in Red Hook several weeks ago (you can't miss the awning) and walked in one afternoon to check it out.  They have two big tanks filled with freshly caught lobsters - the owners drive up to Maine every Thursday and pick them up directly from the docks, so these babies are very alive and kicking.  They were sold out that afternoon, but I was able to reserve four 1.5-pounders from the following week's catch.    Picking them up was pretty neat - they pull the lobsters out of the water with a long rake, weigh them on a scale, and then load them into a specially lined bag that is easily carried out of the store under one's arm.  I also got some good advice on grilling vs. boiling.  Grilling is a little risky given that it's possible to overcook the meat if you don't know what you are doing, but the potential reward is pretty significant.  Boiling lobsters basically foolproof, you just need a big enough pot.I decided to give grilling a try, slicing the lobsters down the middle, cleaning them out, and painting the meat with butter, olive oil, salt and pepper before throwing them on the grill with a foil covering on top (I used a recipe and instructions from The Joy of Cooking).  The result was rather amazing - I love boiled lobster but there is something about marinated and grilled meat that cannot be matched.  After I took the lobsters off the grill, four of us went to work atop a table covered with newspaper, barely saying a word to one another as we devoured every ounce of meat we could pry free.  Easily one of the best lobster experiences I've ever had.Excited to try the lobster rolls in Dumbo, and will definitely get back to the pound in Red Hook for another go at grilling.  Also looking forward to trying their crab claws.  So cool that this place exists in Brooklyn - I highly recommend checking it out if you like lobster and are looking for the highest degree of freshness and quality.",5.0

"mmm. lobster roll!rachel a. and i went to this palace of goodness armed with a 30% off from blackboard eats. we like lobster rolls and we like coupons, so hey - WHY NOT?as it is our regular tactic, we ordered the maine lobster roll and the connecticut kind. as much as i hate to admit it, (and im not saying its really bad, but i do have my comparison) their maine-style lobster roll is not as good as Luke's Lobster roll. but its only a wee bit less. it might have fans of its own when it does a throwdown with Luke's.the Connecticut style? Aaaaah yes. a world of wonderful buttery goodness of love. words cannot express how much love i feel for this sandwich. really. so here's my verdict:GO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",5.0
It really as good as people say it is. Get the hot or Connecticut version. SO GOOD. Such a small sandwich for 16 dollars though! :(,5.0
Best lobster roll I've had in NYC. Lobster was fresh. Seasoning was flavorful and complex but did not overpower the meat. The roll was toasted and buttered to perfection. Portion size was generous and quite simply just delicious.,5.0
"I really enjoyed the Connecticut lobster roll here. The top split bun from Bidderform Maine is toasted with butter to just perfect, crisp on the surface and soft on the inside. The lobster meats are served warm with spices. There isn't mayo in this roll. Lobster roll is $15 each.",4.0
over-rated and over-priced. the place was really small and dingy. really hard to get to if you don't have a car. had a connecticut lobster roll and it was extremely small!!! $16.25 for 4 bites! it was good but could have been bigger and juicer for the price.,3.0
"The lobster roll(Maine) style is DELICIOUS. However, $16 is a bit steep in my opinion. But definitely will go back again.",4.0
"Look I can only answer this in question format... Would I drive to Brooklyn just to come here? No I would not. Would I voluntarily walk around this neighborhood to get here? Again, a big fat no. Is there a train nearby? Sorta but have a high tolerance of walking through some serious ghetto housing. Would I drive here and easily be able to find parking? Absolutely. Would I order the Maine Style Lobster Roll or the Connecticut Style Roll (hot and drizzled with butter)? Definitely CT Style, the butter is the very essence of a roll and the smell that draws you into the pound. Do I love lobster bisque? An understatement. Do I love this lobster bisque? NOO, don't get me wrong they didn't so much as skimp on meat but the bisque part itself was watery and more soupy. (Spoiled by Luke's Lobster's Bisque) Who has more lobster in their roll Red Hook's or Luke's? Definitely this place, sorry Luke but at least you still have location. Is $15 appropriate pricing for this lobster roll? YESS!! Are desserts available? Yes, heavy duty whoppie pies but no I didn't try it.. I was too busy thinking about ordering a second lobster roll. Is seating available? Yes, however I prefer to scarf down lobster in my car, the classy way. Will I be back? Sure, the staff was friendly and anywhere that smells like butter is okay in my book.",4.0
"Over the summer, I went to Cape Cod for the first time and ate 2 different delicious lobster rolls. They were good.I went to the Brooklyn Flea last week in DUMBO and had been dying to try this Red Hook Lobster Pound roll. So BF and I split a Maine-style with mayo one (they were all out of the Connecticut butter style). At first glance, huge meaty chunks of LOBSTER gleamed with the very slight slickness of mayo beneath a scattering of scallions and fiery red dash of paprika. It was GO-GEOUS. The bread was grilled with butter and delightfully crispy. As we chewed our bites of lobster roll, the BF and I looked at each other in complete awe. This lobster roll reigns supreme!For $14, a dollar less than a chicken bus ticket to Boston,...you can't go wrong.",5.0

"Wow. If you missed out on the lobster rolls from Red Hook Lobster Pound at the Dumbo Flea Market  today-- be thankful you can go back every Sunday starting today, 11 am-5pm. Fresh from Maine with New England baking!Yes, we waited at least AN HOUR in line, under the hot sun, but so well worth it!! You've waited longer at Mary's Fish Camp and Pearl havent you-- I have! But get this-- I honestly think LP's is so much better than any of those city lobster rolls. Why? 1. They stack on that lobster meat!  As we were paying the cashier noticed that one of our orders could use a little more lobster, so she threw on some more without us even asking! Great customer service. Not too mayo-y either. 2. The buttered bread! Neither Marys or Pearls use the toasted JJ Nissen Roll. It's a top split roll that just soaks up that butter and is still warm as you bite into it. 3. New condiments like lettuce, celery and green onions were really refreshing. 4. Only $13 for one roll fills you up. My brother had 2 and that was over the top. Marys, Eds and Pearls charge at least a good $32 right? Who needs the damn fries? You come for the lobster meat!",5.0

The roll is half the price of many of the offerings in Manhattan.  That said, at $15, it is quite the pricey ""snack"".  The roll is the size of a hot dog bun, and it is quite small, definitely not filling at all.  For $13, I had a lobster roll at Lobster Box in City Island that was so filling I could not finish most of the fries.  Even being cheaper than the other places, since it is not filling, it is still too expensive.  The lobster roll is tasty.  Sweet lobster meat in a buttered roll...how can you go wrong?  However, the chives they load on top, completely overpowers the entire taste.  It is similar to Luke's Lobster in the Village, yet Luke's is tastier since it does not overpower the delicate and tasty taste of the lobster with chives.  Similar to Luke's, it is not overwhelmed with mayo, as most places (including Lobster Box) all seem to do.  Depends on your preference I suppose.  Both ways are good, just good in their own ways.  But the chives..the chives!  Ruined it for me.  I would say this roll is not worth a special trip to Brooklyn.  Just go to Luke's.  It is the same price and tastier.  If you live in Red Hook, or want a daytrip...then it is worth a visit.  It is too expensive to be a regular habit, though!",3.0

"I'm a huge fan of lobster rolls.  I saw this place while exploring my new neighborhood, but I had my heart set on having lunch by the water at Fairway.  When I got to fairway I saw that they had lobster rolls on the menu, but the one I saw didn't look anything special, and the ordering line was HUGE.  So I turned back and headed over to Lobster Pound.  Right away I noticed that the rolls here cost about twice as the ones at fairway.  I was a little worried that maybe I had made a mistake.  But the rolls were great.  The lobster was definitely fresh.  Anything less than fresh really doesn't taste anything like fresh lobster.  And there were big juicy chunks of it, not the lobster-salad-like substance one finds at some lesser places.  The only time I remember having lobster rolls better than these were at the Menemsha Fish Market in Martha's Vineyard, but the location might have helped influence the taste in that case.  The only reason why I'm giving 4 instead of 5 stars is the price.  A full meal worth of lobster rolls does cost a lot.",4.0

Although it didn't look as though they were open at first, the owner happily made a killer (Maine style) lobster roll & even let me peek at the lobsters swimming in their tanks. It was a nice way to feel far away from the normal Williamsburg/Greenpoint hustle of people & things, while only being a short G train ride away. I do agree with the other reviewers that it was a little pricey, but I was completely into it. I'll be stay-cationing there again very soon...",4.0
"I got a bit of sticker shock. A lobster roll - $14? Nevertheless, we tried it anyway. The lobster (mostly claw meat) was lightly basked in mayo and stuffed in a buttery hot dog type bun. While it WAS fresh and delicious, the portion size was small. I could have eaten 3 of these puppies!",4.0

"I'm a huge fan of lobster rolls.  I saw this place while exploring my new neighborhood, but I had my heart set on having lunch by the water at Fairway.  When I got to fairway I saw that they had lobster rolls on the menu, but the one I saw didn't look anything special, and the ordering line was HUGE.  So I turned back and headed over to Lobster Pound.  Right away I noticed that the rolls here cost about twice as the ones at fairway.  I was a little worried that maybe I had made a mistake.  But the rolls were great.  The lobster was definitely fresh.  Anything less than fresh really doesn't taste anything like fresh lobster.  And there were big juicy chunks of it, not the lobster-salad-like substance one finds at some lesser places.  The only time I remember having lobster rolls better than these were at the Menemsha Fish Market in Martha's Vineyard, but the location might have helped influence the taste in that case.  The only reason why I'm giving 4 instead of 5 stars is the price.  A full meal worth of lobster rolls does cost a lot.",4.0
"I spent my day off this week stay-cationing in Red Hook - one of my new favorite places in Brooklyn. The Lobster Pound was my first stop, and it was a really great experience. Although it didn't look as though they were open at first, the owner happily made a killer (Maine style) lobster roll & even let me peek at the lobsters swimming in their tanks. It was a nice way to feel far away from the normal Williamsburg/Greenpoint hustle of people & things, while only being a short G train ride away. I do agree with the other reviewers that it was a little pricey, but I was completely into it. I'll be stay-cationing there again very soon...",4.0
"I got a bit of sticker shock. A lobster roll - $14? Nevertheless, we tried it anyway. The lobster (mostly claw meat) was lightly basked in mayo and stuffed in a buttery hot dog type bun. While it WAS fresh and delicious, the portion size was small. I could have eaten 3 of these puppies!",4.0
Hands down the most delicious lobster product I've ever tried. Go for the CT roll- buttery goodness not overwhelmed with mayo.It's worth your $15.,5.0

"YUM! Not a fancy place  but very clean and the lobster roll was so good, I didn't want to take the last bite! You buy the food in one store and walk down two doors to a place where you can sit and eat. The whoopee pie was perfection too. Go!",5.0
"A lobster joint in red hook? What? Yep you know it! Delicious, sweet, meaty lobsters in a roll in Podunk Brooklyn! You can't beat it. I just love going here, they have two styles of lobster rolls which are both delicious. I keep telling myself I'd try the other stuff that they have but without fail I always order the lobster rolls anyway. It's like I get brainwashed and hypnotized every time I get to the counter to order my food. I'd give this place 5 stars but I do have to take into account the restaurant decor, which is spartan at best. The room contains large picnic style tables which is not connected to the place where the food is served. You have to physically leave the store with your food in a tray to the sidewalk and go next door to eat. Trust me, balancing a tray of meaty delicious lobster rolls and drinks to go through a heavy door, out the sidewalk and through another heavy door is not easy but definitely worth the exercise.",4.0
"i heard about this place through a friend and decided to stop in when i was in brooklyn with the bf. we placed our order at the counter and took it into the indoor dining area. we ended up ordering 2 connecticut style lobster rolls and 2 sodas; which costs us about $35-which i think is a little steep but you get heaping mounds of lobster on a toasty buttery roll which was very satisfying! i didn't leave hungry, which is a great sign! this was great on a sunny summer day! i would definitely recommend it!",4.0
"well, i didn't dislike this. and i liked talking to the owner. and they put a lot of lobster meat on the sandwich (i had maine style). but there wasn't any depth of flavor. :(",3.0
"it was an ok lobster roll...it doesn't compare to the ones that ben sargent made in williamsburg nor are they as good as the ones you get in cape cod.  it had  very little mayonnaise, very little flavor , and  lobster meat that just didn't taste particularly fresh. it's kind of like a lean cuisines lobster roll and for the price it should taste much,much better!  perhaps we got two bad ones. my hubby and i purchased them at the outdoor flea market  in williamsburg on north 6th street on may 22, 2011.",2.0
"I have loved lobster rolls since my parents and I would sail up to Marthas Vineyard. Eating a Red hook lobster pound lobster roll, transported me back in time, it was great. I would have loved it so much more if it was not for the wait time, which could have been less, but the lady in-charge kept yapping with every person at the flea market. I browsed the website and was unimpressed, maybe she should take more time developing her site, instead of trying so hard to sell herself in person. All in all, I had a great meal and learned a few tricks of the trade from two very professional and knowledgeable chefs who were working with the lady in charge. She should also except credit cards",4.0

"After seeing all the stellar reviews I had to go and find out what was so spectacular about this lobster joint.  I am a big lobster fan and have been to Maine, just for that reason so I didn't think it was possible to really impress me with a lobster roll.  Boy, was I wrong.  First let me say the owner is really nice and while we were waiting gave us some lobster grits to try.  I was hoping to try the Connecticut (butter style) but turns out they don't make those every day.  He assured me that I won't be disappointed because his mayo style is different from what I would expect.  He was right!  I was in LOVE!  The roll itself was buttered before it was grilled to perfection and stuffed with nothing but the very best lobster meat you can imagine.  The mayo was nonexistent (which I loved) and it was just enough to bring the meat together and not make it feel heavy but perfectly combined.  It was then seasoned with paprika and scallions and you're good to go.  The taste?  Out of this world!!  I stole a bite from my husband because I just couldn't get enough.  I can't wait to go back!!",5.0
"The Connecticut style lobster roll is dee-licious.  Of course, I'd eat an old gymshoe if it were slathered in butter.  If you make it out to their brick and morter operation, there isn't any seating, so be prepared to take out or eat on the benches outside.",4.0
"Got to the Brooklyn Flea in Sunday bright and early to grab a lobster roll, and I have to say I'm disappointed. Nice people, and they load up the bun with big chunks of lobster, but it has very little flavor. Kind of tough, too. I just got back from a week of eating lobster in Belize, and this didn't even taste like the same animal.",2.0
"I am writing this since every review but 1 discusses the flea market or rocky sullivans. I went directly to the pound on a Friday. Hippie Maine folk, like you would expect, unpretentious, simple, and very helpful. Got two lobsters for my wife and me, 2 1/2 pounds each for around $50 total. when she opens the pound - basically the big holding tank - those suckers are swimming around like they never left the ocean. The nice woman bagged them up and sent me on my way. Hopped back in my car (lots of street parking right in front) and for those scared of Red Hook, it is literally 3 minutes from the battery tunnel for us coming from Manhattan in a car. Guess you need a car though. Next stop Steve's Key Lime Pie, lobster's in tow. After picking up two 10 inch pies, I head back to my apt on UWS and put the stuff in the fridge - about 5pm i would say. We do not take them out until after 9 to cook and those bad boys almost ran off the counter they were still so fresh. Some of the best, no, probably the best lobster I have ever eaten outside being on the docks in Maine. Right off the boat, paper plate and butter in the little plastic tub will always be #1, but for those of us in and around Manhattan, please tell me whats better. Yeah the Lobster Place is good, but not like these. Need to go back soon. Wish they delivered.",5.0
