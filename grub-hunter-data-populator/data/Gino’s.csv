"Gino's is an old favorite of mine and I am finally reviewing it.My kids beg me to take them to Gino's all the time.  The food and service are constantly top notch.Grilled marinated chicken, mussels in white whine sauce and the chicken parmigiana are our family favorites.",5.0
"I eat here way too often. Sometimes I would just order pickup because the place itself can be too crowded.My favorite dishes are fried calamari ( really really good here), baked clams, eggplant parm and lasagna. I also enjoy their slices now and then. Their penne with chicken is pretty good. Not a fan of their linguine with white clam sauce or bow tie pasta dish because they taste quite bland. The place itself is nothing to brag about but it's quite homey and nice. It can be pretty loud during dinner since it is usually big groups/ families dining.",4.0
"Came here during the holiday season after checking out Dyker Heights and we were not disappointed. Ate so much good food and had a very pleasant experience. There was a big crowd by the door, and we though the wait was going to be 2 hours and we were starving. But fortunately, it only took us 20 minutes to get a table! The host and our server were very attentive. We started off with the house salad and warm bread and butter, YAAAAS. I had half portion of  the rigatoni with grilled chicken and peas in vodka sauce and I was so happy I got the half because it was still so much food! The pasta was delicious. My bf got a seafood dish and was very happy with it as well. And of course we had to have the tiramisu which was SOOOO creamy, light, delicious, and huge! Really enjoyed Gino's and it's authentic Italian food!",4.0
"We ordered a Margherita pie. The crusts were bland and as tasteless as the crust at Saraghina. The sauce/fresh mozzarella ratio was off. It looked like it was a regular cheese pie - drowning in the fresh mozzarella. The pizza was soggy - I realize this could be because we had it delivered. But come on - isn't pizza *meant* to be delivered for parties, events...?Go for the entrees - though I can't vouch for them since I haven't tried them. Just skip the pizza.",2.0
"Came here on a week night, place is huge with a combination of small and big tables. The bar is placed in the center of the restaurant with a brick oven along the side. This is one of the most authentic Italian eateries in Brooklyn as the menu selection based majority on fresh ingredients. My friend and I decided to share the dishes as we wanted to try different things. The gnocchi with tomato and basil was seasoned just right, I wanted extra parmesan cheese as I wanted creamy sauce, my friend opted out. We also tried the main entree lamb chop with mashed potatoes, which was grilled just right. Overall, dining experience was nice, food was good, but on the pricey side. Hard to find parking, there is valet though.",4.0
"This restaurant's reputation precedes itself and I couldn't wait to try it after hearing so much about it from people I know and online.The fried calamari and mussels in white sauce were both excellent. Mussels were fresh and the sauce was perfect. No option for grilled or sauteed calamari, just fried. That's OK though because the calamari wasn't overly breaded or greasy.Penne vodka was ham! Probably the best iteration I've had of this dish anywhere. Cooked perfectly ie) al dente and not too soggy, which is the downfall at most restaurants. The sauce was simply delicious and not too cheesy and the fresh parsley enhanced the flavor. Good portion size. We also ordered a cheese pizza with sausage. Good flavor but a bit too salty. Ditto for the mixed green salad - good flavor but too salty.Linguini with white clam sauce was OK, a bit disappointing considering the restaurant's rep. Rich broth, pasta was a bit too overcooked, and OK flavor. No clams in shell. Atmosphere was nice and service by the waiter was very good. He had a sort of New Yorker immigrant charm and he was thoughtful - ie telling me not to let my son touch the menu then put his fingers in his mouth cuz its dirty. Thanks bro! I didn't pay this time but I hope my friend gave him a good tip.Price point is great for the quality of food and the nice atmosphere.",4.0
RIPPED ME OFF with the kids meal! They asked us if we wanted chicken nuggets and fries for the kids and we ordered it.  To our surprise they charged is $16.50 per kids plate! Unbelievable for pieces a nuggets and fries???!!!!  Gino's... Be more considerate with your clients that have kids otherwise we will STOP going there!,3.0
"We've been coming to Gino's for many years.  It's a staple in this neighborhood and they have their regulars. The food is good. But, if they are busy & often they are - the food is of low quality with regard to preparation and it is ""thrown at you.""  If you eat here when they are not busy, the food is very good.  My mom loves the linguini with white clam sauce. The chicken rollatini is good (better when they are not busy) & is one of my favorite dishes here.  The last time I was there (a few months ago) the baked clams were terrible- rubbery and mostly bread crumbs. Very disappointing, but they were busy so I should have known better!  Note: Their pizza is excellent!",3.0
Everything from the garlic oil bread to the penne vodka to the gnocchi was delicious and perfect. The desserts in particular were great. The service can be better but otherwise a great Italian restaurant. Amazing!,4.0
"I've been to Gino's twice, and left full and happy both times :)On my first visit I ordered the Chicken Francese, which was awesome! The chicken was cooked perfectly and was super tender. The sauce was just the perfect consistency, not too thick or thin.On my second visit I ordered the Penne Vodka, which was also very good and free of peas and pancetta.Also, the portions are huge! I had to deduct 1 star because it does get really crowded- and wait time can be pretty long.I will be back, maybe I'll even try out the pizza next time :)",4.0
"I had lunch here, yesterday, and was not disappointed!   The staff were very attentive and warm, the restaurant was clean and the background music was soothing.  I ordered the mixed greens salad with cranberries for my appetizer,  and linguini with grilled calamari and tomatoes,  in black olive spread for my entree. Both were delicious and freshly made. If you're in Bay Ridge, and are in need of a pasta fix,  then let Gino's indulge your appetite!  Happy dining!",4.0
"Went there awhile back and didn't have such a memorable experience. From small dishes to short tempered staff. Wasn't fun. However- years later I came again with family, and not only was the food good but the service was happy, and friendly. They were also very kid friendly. Portions were normal size not huge but prices seemed fair. I'd go back again for sure and give it a 3rd try.",3.0

"What happened to Gino's? New owners? Had a meal there this past Sunday and it was terrible. My personal pizza was brought out all soggy. Everything fell off the slice when I picked it up which I expected since it was brought out with what looked like a puddle of marinara in the middle of the pie. I didnt even want to take a bite but I did which only annoyed me more. The pizza was terrible. My mother ordered pasta fagioli which she liked and a salad. The salad was literally drowned in olive oil and full of wilted greens. We asked for the manager and I asked him if the salad looked fresh. ""Yes it looks fresh to me"" I wanted to my best impersonation of Gordon Ramsey right there but I held back the profanity laced insults and just asked to have it removed from the bill along with the pie.

"If I could give zero stars I would. We were hoping to find a new restaurant to frequent since we like to go out to dinner regularly. We had a reservation for last night.

I've been to Gino's more than 30 times; it's my favorite Italian places and one of the few real family oriented Italian places in Brooklyn. Two things you must try at Gino's; their rigatoni Alla vodka and the chicken rollatine. I feel at home every time I visit Gino's; everyone is so nice; the price is unbeatable for NY and the food is plain awesome. This is the place to try if you're in Brooklyn,5.0

Also the crust is great- crispy and soft enough to be yummy.

"One of Bay Ridge's finest eateries! Informal, friendly and food always consistently delicious! In over 20 years of dining at Gino's I have never had a bad meal.

Gino's is my everyday Italian spot. I highly recommend the grilled chicken and broccoli rabe for lunch. I stick to traditional dishes for dinner. Chicken Marsala and penne a la vodka are always a good choice. I loved the bake clams and fried calamari for starters. Definitely enough to share with the table. Stay away from the pizza there are other spots in the neighborhood that are much better.,4.0
"This is the last time I will ever go to this restaurant, even in off-hours.  It is unfortunate because the food is good and the wait staff is friendly.  The menu is limited, but my main complaint is trying to be seated, at your reservation time.  On 3 separate occasions, I was told I would have to wait ""just a few minutes"" past my reservation time.  The first time I waited over 45 minutes to be seated.  The next 2 times, I left after having waited a half-hour, each time with reservations, and always having arrived on time.  They give out reservations times, regardless of their expected crowds.  In the event, you do stick around to be seated, the chances are that they will seat you next to the bar, with the bar patrons hanging over your table.  There are too many other excellent restaurants in this area to waste my time, ever again, making a reservation and then having to wait over 45 minutes to be seated.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this restaurant.",1.0
"I brought a group of lively teens to Gino's for pizza and left with a great memory. Not only was the pizza wonderful, but the management and staff treated us like we were family. The pizza was surprisingly affordable for my large group, and I felt like our kids got a genuine slice of New York life. Delicious. It was raining hard when we went to leave, and we had to walk to the subway station. The manager generously offered to have one of his delivery drivers take 2 of our ladies in his van... they were ""walked out"" so this gesture was greatly appreciated. I bet these good people will treat you like family, too.",5.0

"My husband says I am too picky, and perhaps I am BUT the Chicken Parmigiano I had this evening left a whole lot to be desired. Their sauce is on the set side, but flavorful and the bread is warm and crispy and fresh. Waited a while for dinner, but it was a Sunday, crowded and noisy (fine) and we expected the wait. Waiters were pleasant and courteous.......'Nough said. The chicken cutlet was about 1/4 inch thick, tough, dry and I swear it came pre-packaged. Chicken should be able to obe cut with a fork. This one needed a steak knife!! I was really looking forward to the meal since I had heard such great things. My disappointment was palpable!! So sad..........Took most of it home.Cannot reheat or will have sawdust.The linguine that accompanied it was wonderfully al dente and not drowning is sauce.But the chicken truly spoiled the evening. We had no desert, but did order coffees.Espresso was hot, strong and it came with the lemon zest that is frequently missing in many places now. Husband and son had regular coffee and they said it was just fine. I am going to go back again and try another selection,BUT NO MORE chicken Parmigiano.",2.0

"Gino's is worth the longest ride in life on the R train local to Bay Ridge. They've done some remodeling since the last time I was here. Now when you enter the older darker decorated room is to the left and the modern brighter side is to your right. We were set on the right in a nice corner table. Service was very prompt, everyone that came by the table was polite and quick. Being that we were chatting away we did not get straight to ordering but the server was most patient with us. What we ordered:Bottle of white wine - very reasonably pricedPasta & Figioli (white sauce) Mussels - simple but very yummy, very full orderBowtie, peas, mushroom, grilled shrimp - she said it was amazing, I can't have mushrooms so I did not taste it, but she is Italian and she gave it very high praise. And took the rest home to the hubby.Rigatoni w/ Chicken and peas in vodka sauce - It was good but I think it could have used some more salt. If you have had breakfast and lunch you only need an half order of the pasta. A full one is at least two servingsFor the final act we saved the best for last: TIRAMISU.

I have been a long time customer of Ginos. I just recently celebrated my birthday dinner here with the family. We went on a Friday night and fortunately for us the wait was no more then 10-15mins. We went with the out door table which in my opinion was perfect.. the weather was amazing and my family and I were able to enjoy a conversation without the overbearing noise of indoor dining. If you've been here before you know that the restaurant can get pretty packed so I would strongly recommend making reservations if possible. Ginos is one of my favorite Italian restaurants in Brooklyn. It has that old time family restaurant feel. Our waiter was amazing. He was very personable and attentive.

We ordered a large pizza pie, half mushrooms and half sausage and because it was straight out of the oven it was delicious. But, I mean, it's really hard to make pizza taste bad especially if it's fresh out of the oven. Then we also had the fried calamari. It was your average, fried calamari, crispy seafood with marinara sauce. Then we also ordered the linguini with clam sauce, gnocchi with mozzarella and basil, and something with eggplants and sausage. The pasta were cooked perfectly but taste wise, it was a bit too salty.

The bread and insanely good garlic/herb/olive oil dip got things off to a good start.

I had the famed mezze rigatoni alla vodka with chicken, and it was everything people said it was. Perfectly cooked pasta, tender grilled chicken, peas and a perfectly balanced and tasty sauce. My friends had rigatoni with sausage and eggplant (I didn't try, but he liked) and the chicken rollatini, which wasn't so great...the only negative of the evening. It had a very gummy, overly thick breading. We had tiramisu and cheesecake for dessert. The tiramisu was fine...(ok...mine's better).

My friends had rigatoni with sausage and eggplant (I didn't try, but he liked) and the chicken rollatini, which wasn't so great...the only negative of the evening. It had a very gummy, overly thick breading. We had tiramisu and cheesecake for dessert. The tiramisu was fine...(ok...mine's better). My friends loved the cheesecake, but I like a creamier texture and have had better. The atmosphere is so nice in the garden and the service was great, so, all in all, it was a really lovely evening and I'll be back to try more things!",4.0
"I come here for lunch almost each time I'm working around the neighborhood. The staff is super friendly and the pizza is so good. My favorites the mushroom slice and it's worth having garlic breath afterwards. The pasta is also pretty good, I've had their penne vodka with chicken fillet, it was super creamy and the pasta wasn't over cooked.",5.0

"I really like Ginos, it is a great Bay Ridge italian restaurant, ive never had anything bad there but the entrees tend to be on the smaller side.

"The food at Gino's is pretty decent. Even though Bay Ridge has alot of Italians, I don't feel like there are too many Italian restaurants that are good in the area. I didn't feel like going out one night so I ordered from seamless. The delivery time said 45-60 minutes and they were true to the time. The food I ordered was still nice and warm when delivered. The linguine with white clam sauce is okay - I've had way better; the chicken francaise was good and given that it's chicken breast, it was not dry at all; the ""mini"" meatballs pretty decent for the price of $7.50 for 12 meatballs; the rigatoni with eggplant and sausage was delicious. With tax and tip, everything came out to $65. This order fed four people with some leftovers.",4.0

My only recent experience was delivered food. Except one time when the veal was chewy the food is usually very good. My only issue is the $2 delivery charge.

"This is a bit of a self-defeating review, as Gino's is never short on customers. But if you want some good, traditional Italian food, you can't go wrong here.

The space to the left of the pizzeria is a bit nicer, but there's a relatively loud, conversational atmosphere in the entire place.Hot antipasto platter is a nice starter. Seafood dishes are fresh, pasta is cooked to perfection. Gino's often attracts an interesting crowd. One time, it seemed like an episode of the Sopranos broke out in the restaurant when James Gandolfini (shortly before his death), and half a dozen actors from the show sat a few tables away from us.

"Dam good pasta. I really enjoyed the family atmosphere. While we waited for our table (very reasonable 20 minutes for a walk-in at 7pm on a Sunday, Holiday weekend), I noticed the restaurant staff new many customers by name. Not to stereotype, but it felt old world Italian, which provided authenticity. The only area of improvement is table service. There were large gaps between courses, our waiter disappeared at one point, and our dishes went to the wrong table, which delayed the meal. Overall, we were there for a couple hours. For two people that felt long when we only ordered one app and two main dishes. Bottom line. Good food. Nice atmosphere. Slow service.",4.0

"Hands down one of my favorite spots in Bay Ridge. Still has a very local, old school Italian feel to it. Nothing too crazy, just the basics. Baked clams, antipasto, all the good stuff. I was here about 10 years ago for a birthday party and its still as good since I was there last week.My favorite is always the veal with mozzarella and eggplant. It's a bit of a heavy dish but very satisfying. This last time I went with the scallops, perfectly seared. They had a black and white mouse which was smooth and satisfying.The salad special was good too, mesclun with strawberries, asparus and beets, but a little lacking on the beets.My only qualm here has ever been getting rushed out.

Most of the waitstaff is nice although some of the guys are a little cocky and can get short with you, but if you are a regular it looks like they treat you really well. Great pastas, great francaise dishes, decent heroes (could use a little more cheese) but overall a great place to visit.",4.0
"Well Gino's we had a good run. I have been eating your food for more than 20 years. Either my palate has matured or your food has really begun to suck! I remember the good old days where my friends and I would sit in your booths and eat some great food. Now I get watery sauce on pasta, fish that tastes like it is weeks old, stale bread, salad that has mass quantities of yellow lettuce and a huge flipping bill. What has happened? Has your popularity gone to your head? I can get a better dinner in the frozen section of the supermarket. Well this is the last time I spend $66. on takeout. Shame on you for not caring anymore.

"Live in Bay Ridge and Gino's is my go to restaurant.  I LOVE it.  Ordered a good size take out order, but there was no Italian bread.  Disappointed only because the dishes we ordered could have used a little bread to sop up delicious sauce.  Please include bread on take out orders.  Food was delicious.",4.0
"Come gather 'round people and listen to the ole goat tell you bout, ""I remember when this place was a little pizzeria with only a few tables in the back..."" Oh yeah, love the Gino's since forever. When I was a kid and we'd be visiting my grandma who lived around the corner, a pizza and some veal and eggplant parmigianas were regularly in order. The million year subway ride to Bay Ridge from The Bronx was rarely a treat, but knowing that we'd likely be feasting on foods from Gino's was a thrillin' proposition: something wonderful for which to hungrily look forward.I know. I know. What in the hell does any of this have to do with modern day gigante Gino's? Well, some people can't let a chance to muse nostalgically pass em by at every given opportunity. Points to self. The majority of my report back to my Pops on the state of the old neighborhood was me enthusing, ""Holy sh*t, it's like quadruple the size! Valet parking?!"" So, this was my first time at contemporary Gino's. Service was excellent. Baked clams to start were delicious. Our pastas were perfectly al dente and delectable. My husband's red snapper was super fresh and fantastic and we loved the salty spikes of olives and capers with the squashed tomato. Myself, I couldn't stop myself from ordering the eggplant parmigiana, like I always would in days of old. My favorite revisited was just lovely. Just exactly what I was hoping it would be. Eggplant was cooked just right, saucy, cheesy, mmm hmm.So I tell you, from those days years and years ago of excellent take out in aluminum tins from the formerly tiny spot, to these times big bustling business and beautiful white table cloth-ed large dining rooms; the cooking remains right on.

"Arrived on time for a 6:30 birthday dinner with the family and was seated no more than a half hour later. The atmosphere was very nice and noise level was not loud at all. The dinner was an enjoyable experience. We had the shrimp oreganato, fried shrimp and chicken parm with fried calamari and baked clams as appetizers. The fried calamari was the best I've had. I will definitely recommend Gino's.",5.0

"Great neighborhood staple. 50 years,  need I say more. Best time to go is around 5pm on weekends as this place gets very crowded. Red sauce, cream sauce, pesto, it's all very tasty; not your typical Italian restaurant. Pasta dishes are plentiful and not too pricy. Wait staff is very attentive and polite. At the start of sitting at your table,  bread and a simple dip is placed in front if you. It is freakin incredible! You could do shots of this stuff. We asked the waiter how it was made; he came back to our table with a list of ingredients on how to make it. Now that's service!",4.0
First time here and it was a phenomenal experience. Food was well made and delicious!,5.0
"This place is always packed for a reason. The reason being is that it has great food! I really enjoy the appetizers such as fried zucchini, the baked clams, etc. Pasta is always good, whatever you choose. I really can't complain.",5.0
"Very 'local' vibe to this place. My favorite take out pizzeria in the area. Plain cheese pie is all you need. The pizzeria area is small and the guys making the pizza are really chill. The restaurant itself is rather large and more formal than you would expect. Prices are average and the service is ok. Most of the waitstaff is nice although some of the guys are a little cocky and can get short with you, but if you are a regular it looks like they treat you really well. Great pastas, great francaise dishes, decent heroes (could use a little more cheese) but overall a great place to visit.",4.0
"Well Gino's we had a good run. I have been eating your food for more than 20 years. Either my palate has matured or your food has really begun to suck! I remember the good old days where my friends and I would sit in your booths and eat some great food. Now I get watery sauce on pasta, fish that tastes like it is weeks old, stale bread, salad that has mass quantities of yellow lettuce and a huge flipping bill. What has happened? Has your popularity gone to your head? I can get a better dinner in the frozen section of the supermarket. Well this is the last time I spend $66. on takeout. Shame on you for not caring anymore. I guess we will have to drive to Park Slope to get good Italian food. What's even worse is that you won't even care about this review.",1.0

"Gino's has the most amazing Italian food in Brooklyn.  I was first introduced to this place 8 years ago and go when ever I have the itch for some Veal Scallopini, Chicken Cutlet Parm, or Shrimps with white beans.  They have a fully stacked bar with a T.V. that plays sports.  Their prices are super low for the amount and quality of food you're getting.The service is amazing and the owner is always walking around to ask how you're enjoying your meal.  They have special rooms that can fit large parties for special events.Be on a look out for a line outside the door during busy dinner hours.

"Excellent food. The wait is worth it. Be nice to the girls taking names at the desk; it's ridiculously busy and when people leave is out of their control. I saw people being rude about their waiting time, but honestly they're sweet girls who felt so bad about us waiting so long. I had the chicken francese with potatoes and my partner the calzone. Both were excellent. Such good value. Service was good -- but slow again they're super crazy busy so we understood.",4.0
"Gino's food is absolutely delicious. I am an Italian-American living in Brooklyn, so I'm very snobby when it comes to good Italian food. And this place hit the nail on the head. My family and I go for every occasion, and usually order the same thing every time. We start out with fried zucchini & fried calamari, both of which are crisp and fresh. Then my mom usually gets the Chicken Francaise sauteed with lemon, white wine and garlic, served with roasted potatoes. I order the Penne with Asparagus And Roasted Peppers. Both are very different, but equally delicious. My boyfriend always orders the Chicken Parmigiana, and my dad always gets the Shrimp Fra Diavolo. I can name the rest of my family's orders, but honestly, every single single there (including the salads) is phenomenal, so what's the point?

"Went here for lunch with a girlfriend. We ordered white clam sauce with linguini and a personal pie.The pasta come out al dente, as requested. I am usually picky with pasta but it came out spot on. The sauce was a little bit thin for me. I felt like I was eating noodles in soup most of the time with a few sad pieces of clams on top. I split this pasta with my friend and the portions were just right. The waiter offered to put it on separate plates for us, which was nice. I would probably come back and order a different type of pasta.The personal pie was really gross tasting. For an italian restaurant, I think they should be embarrassed to served such gross tasting pizza. The sauce was too sweet and the cheese added too much grease. The pizza tasted like bread slathered with sweet sauce and grease, two bro's dollar pizza tastes better than that. Please spare yourself and do not order any pizza here.Bottom line: The food and decor is worth it for the price. A nice place to bring a date for dinner/lunch. I would come back to this place.",4.0

I don't care for fried calamari, (it feels as tough I am chewing on rubber) but their fried calamari melted in my mouth! Wait staff was friendly and attentive.

"I must have lucked out since everyone is complaining about the wait at Gino's because we were seated right away even though we were 30 minutes late for our reservation. Even though it seemed packed, they have an abundance of tables prepared for the turnout so it's not stuffy at all. I ordered the penne vodka and it was standard, with a hearty sauce, but it's no Il Coloseo penne vodka (that place ruined me for all italian spots!!)Nothing particular to note about the staff, except our waiter in particular was pretty obnoxious and then gave us the check before our dessert even got there.",3.0
Very delicious food and great service. Our party of four all enjoyed the food and desserts.  The staff was on top of things at all times too and were very friendly.  Veal parm is succulent and the calamari was perfect. I'd definitely recommend the place.,5.0
"It's true that the quality of Gino's has seemed to drop a bit, and with so many Italian restaurants in the area, it's hard to find a good place. Gino's is almost always busy, and the food rarely ever comes back bad. With that said, I DO feel like their quality control has gotten a touch lax.Overall though, it's not a terrible place to have dinner. The price is a bit higher than say Bay ridge pizza or Rocco's but it IS a regular restaurant. With the price point the quality of the food is a bit better than your average pizzeria. I wouldn't necessarily frequent it here, but if I wanted above average Italian and didn't mind paying a bit more for it, I wouldn't mind coming here. The pastas, sauces, etc are all above average; just not anything to really rave about.",3.0
"The chicken parm here will make any other kind you eat a disappointment in comparison. The chicken is crispy but covered in the sauce (which is easily the best part, tangy and full of flavor), with just enough cheese. The pasta is also great and their marinara is delicious. It's not a perfect restaurant but it's a great italian place that, when it gets it right, it gets it REALLY right.",4.0
"My colleague hosted her Baby Shower at Gino's. I am not a fan of Italian cuisine, but I must say my meal (Appetizer: Hot Antipasto, Pasta: Penne Vodka and Entrée: Broiled Salmon) at Gino's was excellent! My meal was prepared to perfection! I don't care for fried calamari, (it feels as tough I am chewing on rubber) but their fried calamari melted in my mouth! Wait staff was friendly and attentive. I have been raving about this restaurant ever since my last visit! I highly recommend Gino's and I definitely will return to dine there again real soon!",5.0

"Went to Gino's on a busy night, but we were seated pretty quickly.  The place was warm, and everyone seemed to know each other, which added to the friendly atmosphere.We had the minestrone soup, chicken parm with a side of pasta, and a few drinks.  The chicken was still nice and crispy underneath the sauce, just the way I like it.  Overall, a nice find in Bay Ridge.",4.0

"My parents first brought me to Gino's at the tender age of 5. It was just a hole in the wall at the time but,  enjoyed it as I was a ""healthy"" eater.I'm currently 24 and still eating here! I've introduced many people to it who have come to enjoy it as well. My go to dish is the chicken cutlet parmigiana with linguini. It is amazing to say the least, the breading is never overdone and the portions are huge (always plenty of left over for lunch the next day)! What really seals the deal is the sauce, sometimes more amazing than other times, but always delicious. The other dish I've really enjoyed to this date is Chicken Rollitini. I really enjoy this dish (especially because they do not add ham as I know others do, I do not like that!) the roasted potatoes are good and are nicely dipped in that thick sauce.Now onto desert! My favorite is the black an white chocolate moussé! The tirimasu is my favorite I've had compared to other places, The others are from decent-good as well.Service is great here as well. 99% of time they are attentive and pleasant. The manager/owner is usually at the reservation book greeting and always saying hi.The decor is beautiful with warm browns and cream colors to take you into Italy. The music never to loud to take away from the conversations you are having with your loved ones! I understand everyone has different taste buds, but Gino's tingles mine to new heights and never lets me down! Tips: Even if you're coming in for a slice you won't be dissappointed!Most times I will suggest making a reservation because it can get packed in a hurry!

"I noticed red flags the second i passed by this place. There was a lot of people waiting to be seated and not all of them looked happy. I had made a reservation for 7:15pm. Its was 7pm, the maître d' looked like she wanted to cry, red flag! Some customers were complaining to her about waiting too long, red flag!I took a seat by the front and ordered a small coke, $2.50, red flag! I noticed three people complaining at the bar about their food and saw three full dishes going back to the kitchen, red flag!7:45 we were finally seated, right in the front behind the maître d', very noisy busy area. The air conditioner was pumping out cold air that right away upset my parents. Red flag! The tables are cover in a table cloth with paper on top of it, red flag! Half of our setting were missing and we had no napkins.Our server finally came took our drink order and ran away before we could order appetizers. Red flag! We waited an hour for our food to come out, by that time my kid was crying, he was ice cold, my parents looked miserable and i lost my appetite. I asked my wife to have my food wraped up, and took my kid for a walk to warm up. The food was ok, nothing special, would not eat there ever again.

Best Italian in Bay Ridge but not Brooklyn. Although this place wont blow you away with outstanding eats it does offer solid plates at a reasonable price.

"We used to go to Gino's back when it was a tiny restaurant behind a pizzeria. It's never been the same but we recently decided to give it another try. Our hot antipasto dish was a good portion but unfortunately the eggplant rollatini was still cold in the middle. We had to send it back to be reheated because it was inedible (and I'm that picky eater).  Soon after, the bus boy accidentally knocked over my friend's soda. The reason why we give this 2 stars is because the quality of the dishes isn't as it used to be (it doesn't stand out from the other Italian restaurants on 3rd), the waiter never offered to give us anything complimentary to make up for the cold appetizers (even something small would have been a nice gesture) AND they never offered to refill my friend's soda after THEY spilled it.",2.0
"Pizza review only. The brick oven pizza here rocks. While the Sicilian is just good Brooklyn pizza, the Margherita is noteworthy..thick dough with a nice crunch, lots of sweet sauce and lots of goey fresh mozzarella.

"I guess I'm the bad guy here. But anyways, I have made a reservation a day ahead and on the day of our reservation we came on time and still we have to wait for almost an hour to get our table. The hostess was not very friendly, she didn't even give us an explanation on why we have to wait that long.  I guess cuz we're not their regulars.  But after we sat the service was good but the food was not what I've expected from these reviews.  I ordered a filet mignon medium but it came out too rare that I have to past.  All the other foods we ordered wasn't that great either. So a bit disappointed.  And btw I've never waited more than 10mins for a table at any restaurants with reservation and this is the first time. If you can't guarantee tables  then don't take any reservations.  Never again and with the hostess's attitude, will never return.

"My family came here for my dad's 60th birthday, there were about 17 or 18 of us, and of course loud, demanding of everything under the sun, from chair to chair coat service to extra bread, soda, and anything else we could think of to keep the wait staff running around. They were on top of it the whole time and did an excellent job bringing out everyone's dinner at once. The food was excellent, the hot anti pasta we all shared was large, plentiful and fresh. Calamari, clams, shrimp, eggplant, mozzarella, tomatoes, and fried zucchini, all delicious. My main course was the rigatoni with grilled chicken and vodka sauce. It was large and in charge. I guess I always order the heaviest thing on the menu, and this one did not disappoint. I almost finished my dinner, but in this challenge, food won.

"It is actually a 3.5 at most, so I decided to be generous and gave it four stars. I thought about it for a really long time before I gave the rating.

It was fresh and light, but like all their other dishes, it's missing a ...taste? I accord the problem to a lack of a specific spice or too little spice. I am impressed by their pasta though. Al dente! It was jusssssssst chewy enough to make me forget about the lack of seasoning, and the bread was just out of this world good. Goodness knows I'll go back for the bread alone! Although I have to admit, out of all the Italian restaurants I tried in Brooklyn, this was the best. Everything was fresh and the decoration was comforting, but don't sit close to the entrance! That spot was so dark I could hardly read my menu! All in all, it was a good experience. It would have been better if there were more space for my party and some dishes, glass and napkins from the beginning would be nice too, especially when we ask it for a few times.

"Gino's pretty much describes my high school career in Bay Ridge. If we weren't there every week, it was at least every other week. Takeout or eat in, Gino's delivered every single time. To this day, Gino's is still on the top of my list for Italian. For me, they make the best penne vodka ever. Everywhere I go in Manhattan and Staten Island, I keep comparing the penne vodka to Gino's. The Boyfriend argues that Carmine's makes better penne vodka but I think he's crazy. Gino's all the way! There is nothing better that describes Bay Ridge more than Gino's It's been a while since I've been here but I always crave their penne vodka. So good!",5.0
"My husband Charlie and I  have been regulars at Gino's for many years.   We are NEVER disappointed, food is great, staff excellent and patrons great.  We have made many friends sitting at the bar.   Bartender Dino is great.  We have eaten at many Italian restaurants and  Gino's is the best.  Italian food  the way mama made.",5.0

"My friends and I decided to treat one of our friends to dinner as an early birthday dinner. It was a Sunday night and there was about a half an hour wait and a line that was almost to the door. Was it worth the half hour wait? Eh, not necessarily. The food didn't blow me away, but it is certainly better than some of the other Italian restaurants in the area in the same price range. The ambiance is great here, intimate for family and friends, loved it! My friends and I were chatting while we waited for our food and the staff was attentive...They don't have a large selection on the menu, but if you want to go for a simple pasta or entree, they'll probably have it. We started with the hot antipasto, which was fresh and not smothered in unnecessary flavor! You know what I mean if you've ever tried baked clams and all you taste is too much salt and garlic! I ordered rigatoni with eggplant and sausage, it was good. Two of my friends ordered the special, linguini with clams and mussels. Considering they almost finished all of it, I think they liked it. My other friend ordered the bowtie pasta with peas, mushrooms and shrimp, she said it was good as well.Then, when it came time to pay the bill, as my friends and I were putting down our money, we had money that ""disappeared."" The staff that was clearing our table was noticeably impatient and maybe somewhere in that process, something happened. We had counted several times before paying and our total was over the total we were supposed to have...After much confusion as well as counting and recounting, it was still a mystery!This place is pretty good for Bay Ridge, so it's an option if you're in the area! I don't mind going back, but maybe next time we'll just card it! =)",3.0

I will never eat there again!  It was packed today so they sat us in a party room across from a table of about 15 loud people.

When we left the area I was told there were no waiters for was all seated so I asked the manager what happened and he gave me the deer in headlights look.

"We went to Gino's tonight and we both really liked it. The positives* very friendly from the moment you walk in until you are on your way out* accurate prediction of wait time. We were told the wait without reservations would be 45 minutes to an hour and it was* our waiter Joe was quite professional and knew how to talk to customers* warm real Italian bread with soft butter* the food, let me repeat that...the food...I had chicken Francese which I would have liked a bit more lemony, but it was a hearty portion of moist chicken and my much better half had eggplant Parmigiana that she really liked. We both enjoyed our pasta and the fact that there was no surcharge for substituting pasta for the potato or vegetable that came with our entrees* the pricesWhat might have been better (and was minor considering it was a busy Saturday night)* we had to ask a couple of times to have our water glasses refilled * my GF said the women's restroom was not clean* asking if I wanted a refill of my coffee would have been nice* the noise level was quite loud. I'm not sure if it was the room's acoustics or just the people who sat near us!Bottom line...an excellent Italian restaurant!",4.0

"We are longtime customers of Gino's - we have not only visited the restaurant and ordered take out but have ordered many, many trays of catering. We just had the most atrocious experience with the manager, Nick. We ordered a few items we typically order - including the cold seafood salad and the rigatoni with fresh mozz, basil and tomato. Again, these are items we have also ordered large trays of for family gatherings, so we have a firm grasp of what they typically taste like. Tonight we ordered both and they were sub-par at best. The seafood salad was drastically underseasoned and was lacking its usual kick. The rigatoni was mushy and very, very overcooked. When we called Gino's to let them know about the poor quality items that we typically enjoy so much, there was no reasonable accommodation offered. Even though we were about to leave for a pre-Thanksgiving festivities with our family, Nick insisted that either we: A) Wait for Gino's to come pick up the food we had an issue with, inspect it to ""make sure"" it wasn't high quality, and bring us replacement food (typically this would be fine, but again, as we explained to Nick, we were on our way out of the door)or B) Bring them the food as we were on our way out of the door, again, so they could inspect it since ""he needs to make sure that we weren't just one of those customers calling to complain"" and then take another order of the food to go (?? and what, eat it in our car ??!)All we asked for was for the next time we ordered if they could take care of at least the pasta. Nick was arrogant and very decisive in his stance. He insisted that the only way we, as the customer would be accommodated, would be if we went out of our way for their company on the night before Thanksgiving.Nick's comments about ""what if every customer called and complained"" were ludicrous at best.  It is a shame that an establishment that typically produces high quality food has an off night and then won't even trust the word of a customer who calls up with a small request to correct the situation for the next time we order (and the next time we planned to spend more money with the restaurant!!) We certainly will not be doing business with Gino's anymore - and for those who have an issue with the food, ever, be warned. Management cares more about themselves than long-time customers.",1.0
"My family and I used to go to Gino's in Bay Ridge after my orthodontist appointments in 1995 for pizza. Back then, you would just stop in for slice and a soda and it was always a sure bet. Many years later (as in, last week) my parents invited me to dine with them at Gino's where I hadn't been in eons. I knew Gino's had a trattoria component which I had probably also dined at as a youth, but I figured it would be fun to go back and try it again. Gino's now owns half the block they occupy comprising four storefronts with a small pizza place anchoring the whole establishment, flanked by repeat dining rooms on either side for people interested in a sit-down experience. I met my parents on a Thursday evening and was struck with how packed the place was. Gino's truly is a Bay Ridge institution. We started with cocktails (the usual Ketel One martini for me) which were good and a basket of Italian bread was dropped on the table. The menu presents a mixed bag of Italian cuisine including a large and very enticing pasta section followed by all the meats and fish. We started with the mixed hot antipasto for the table which included eggplant rollatini, stuffed clams and fried calamari (the winner, so much so that we ordered more). I went with the veal medallions and eggplant for my main which came served with a generous helping of broccoli rabe (my favorite veg!). My parents both had seafood dishes and my dad's scallops looked great. Tiramisu for dessert was a lovely finish. Their wine list is balanced with a nice selection of affordable bottles and few higher end ones. We went with a bottle of Stag's Leap Cabernet Sauvignon which was terrific. Service was surprisingly attentive given how crowded it was and I was really happy with all of my food choices. Factoring in the astonishingly affordable price point at Gino's, I can definitely see why this place is such a big hit. I've said it before and I'll say it again - Bay Ridge is no stranger to Italian restaurants but Gino's is definitely a good choice if you're in the 'hood and looking for some casual, comfortable Italian fare (and at great prices to boot).",4.0
"Excellent regular slice as well as an excellent eggplant and garlic slice. That's where I draw the line with Gino's. There is no need to venture further into the menu since every time proved to be a let down. Let's get real Bay Ridge the best square slice is the Elegante slice prepared by Tony down the block. I know the last sentence reads cliched but that's just the law of the land. If you don't agree that an Elegante square slice is better you may have different taste buds. Still, a Gino's regular slice is the best in a 10mile radius.",4.0

"We went to Gino's tonight and we both really liked it. The positives* very friendly from the moment you walk in until you are on your way out* accurate prediction of wait time. We were told the wait without reservations would be 45 minutes to an hour and it was* our waiter Joe was quite professional and knew how to talk to customers* warm real Italian bread with soft butter* the food, let me repeat that...the food...I had chicken Francese which I would have liked a bit more lemony, but it was a hearty portion of moist chicken and my much better half had eggplant Parmigiana that she really liked. We both enjoyed our pasta and the fact that there was no surcharge for substituting pasta for the potato or vegetable that came with our entrees* the pricesWhat might have been better (and was minor considering it was a busy Saturday night)* we had to ask a couple of times to have our water glasses refilled * my GF said the women's restroom was not clean* asking if I wanted a refill of my coffee would have been nice* the noise level was quite loud. I'm not sure if it was the room's acoustics or just the people who sat near us!Bottom line...an excellent Italian restaurant!",4.0

"We are longtime customers of Gino's - we have not only visited the restaurant and ordered take out but have ordered many, many trays of catering.

"And I thought all the good Italian restaurants were gone... I was wrong. Some clients of mine flew in from California for a closing; the least I could do is take them out to dinner.  As soon as you walk in Gino's the different aromas hit you... You know you're in the right place to eat. We were quickly seated. It was simple, basic, classy Italian restaurant décor; white table cloths and waiters dressed in black. I ordered a bottle of Australian Shiraz to drink for the table while waiting for our appetizers to come.  We started out with the hot antipasto which consisted of baked clams, shrimp oreganato, fried calamari and eggplant rollatini. My guests were very pleased. For the main course they ordered the lobster ravioli, rigatoni with grilled chicken, peas and vodka, and I had the Chilean sea bass. We all tried each other's dishes, each person likening each dish with a passion. It really set the mood for a very happy evening dinner. We laughed;  got another bottle of wine and enjoyed the food like there was no tomorrow... My compliments to the chef!For dessert we had tartufo with this amazing tiramisu which is freshly made on the premises daily. My guests said they have never tasted tiramisu that good, ever. I have to admit, it was pretty damn good.  All the waiters and the staff were very warm and friendly. The warm ambiance of Gino's made us feel like it was our Italian restaurant. They will be seeing me a lot more in the near future.",5.0
"My husband took me here on our second date and it has been a favorite of ours ever since! Amazing food, serive is spectacular and the portions are massive!

Some clients of mine flew in from California for a closing; the least I could do is take them out to dinner.  As soon as you walk in Gino's the different aromas hit you... You know you're in the right place to eat. We were quickly seated. It was simple, basic, classy Italian restaurant décor; white table cloths and waiters dressed in black. I ordered a bottle of Australian Shiraz to drink for the table while waiting for our appetizers to come.  We started out with the hot antipasto which consisted of baked clams, shrimp oreganato, fried calamari and eggplant rollatini. My guests were very pleased. For the main course they ordered the lobster ravioli, rigatoni with grilled chicken, peas and vodka, and I had the Chilean sea bass. We all tried each other's dishes, each person likening each dish with a passion. It really set the mood for a very happy evening dinner. We laughed;  got another bottle of wine and enjoyed the food like there was no tomorrow... My compliments to the chef!For dessert we had tartufo with this amazing tiramisu which is freshly made on the premises daily. My guests said they have never tasted tiramisu that good, ever. I have to admit, it was pretty damn good.  All the waiters and the staff were very warm and friendly. The warm ambiance of Gino's made us feel like it was our Italian restaurant. They will be seeing me a lot more in the near future.",5.0
"My husband took me here on our second date and it has been a favorite of ours ever since! Amazing food, serive is spectacular and the portions are massive! The prices are inexpesnive and you can feed a whole family for way under $100.We loved it so much that we even held our rehearsal dinner there before our wedding and the service and attention we received that day was beyond compare!Highly reccomend them for both a caual night out or for bigger groups and parties.This place is always packed so go in earlier than you would go if you know you will be hungry at a specific time. So if you generally eat at 7pm, you might want to head in around 6:30pm so you know you will be seated around this time. Expect to wait longer on weekends.They are closed on Mondays.",5.0
"Good service, long wait. I come to this restaurant often and even order delivery from here.Staple Italian dishes, pizza, chicken parm, franchise etc.Some favorites from here are the penne ala vodka, the chicken franchise and the steak",5.0
"About the only decent Italian place in Bay Ridge left.  These guys know how to make good food, from the basics like chicken or veal parm down to some of the more ambitious menu options (the red snapper when available is always fresh and tasty).The food is good either eaten in or taken out.  Don't expect a quick seating or a quiet meal, but that's what comes with a huge crowd that comes for good food.  The fully stocked bar helps make it worth the wait.There's Gino's and everyone else, and it's not close.",4.0
I have been here a few times now and I can say I never had a bad meal!!  I usually come around lunch time or before the dinner rush because if you go at prime time....you can plan on waiting!!  Service is courteous but slow. This time around I had the veal medallions. Tender and delicious!! Fried calamari appetizer was only ok. A little on the tough side but the sauce was good.,4.0
"One of the best Italian ( family restaurant) around Bay Ridge! This is my 2nd time here and I love the food. Everything is fresh and at reasonable price and very nice portions. They make Tiramisu to die for!  *Definitely* call in for reservations, this place  is always packed, unless you want to wait for a table...Go Gino's!",5.0
"Came with a large group for an early dinner. They were very nice and allowed us to seat even though our entire group was not there yet. The portion sizes are gigantic. I came here a few months ago, but I remember all the dishes being great! I have a bad habit of eating other's food since I enjoy trying new foods and I haven't found a better way to do so besides snatching a piece from every plate. =) Don't worry, I do ask permission before attacking the plates. It's your typically italian cuisine with spot on taste and large enough portions to feed two per main dish!",4.0

"Went for dinner with some friends, this place was GREAT. We had reservations and were sat in less than 10 minutes. The staff was friendly and on top of everything. Our food tasted fresh and best of all delicious!!  the Gnocchi with fresh mozz and basil was really good, I would recommend this place to anyone craving Italian cuisine.",5.0
"Best italian in Bay ridge. I have tried it all- all the ravioili specials, spaghetti with meat sauce, lasagna, gnocchi, chicken parmesan...their tomato sauce is simply classic!",5.0
"I feel like I get some kind of street cred since I have been going to Gino's since it was a one-storefront pizza joint in what is now the 99 cent store next door. I remember the big red booths in the back, and the friendly family that owned it and was always asking about how your parents were doing. Their food has always been great, so it made sense that over the years they'd grow into the Bay Ridge behemoth they are now-- though you can still get your pizza and sit at a window by the front. Gino's is just as well suited for a casual meal as it is for a really special one. There's ALWAYS A LINE TO GET IN. It generally moves faster than they tell you it will. I always get  the seafood salad, it's my favorite at Italian restaurants-- and they make theirs really well. Back in the glorious days before Weight Watchers Points ruled my life I used to CRUSH the chicken parm hero.The prices are reasonable, I think-- you won't break the bank but it will run you more than a cafe or diner will. I'd estimate $25 per person without booze, with sodas.  OH and my last word of advice-- always try one of their specials. They are always amazing. Gino's is a great place, you won't ever be disappointed, but you will always have to wait.",4.0
"Apparently this place has been here for years and has quite a history and great reputation with the locals.  Always packed, but luckily the restaurant is pretty large.I've been here twice and had the vodka penne with grilled chicken and peas both times.  Pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was delicious.  The second time I was tempted to try something different, but couldn't bring myself to do it because it was so good!I hear the pizza is fantastic as well, didn't have a chance to try it yet but I will definitely be back here.4.5 stars",4.0
"Until about three years ago i hadn't been to GINO'S  in quite some time. There are so many other places and i also cook Italian  all the time. So when we were invited to a party i was looking forward to returning and trying it again. I was never disappointed in the past and I wasn't let down that time. Everything that was put on the table ,whether ordered by me or by our hosts was great.I've been going there whenever I'm in town. The food is always consistently great.My faves are the pasta fazool,hot anti pasta and the fish dishes. Also everyone we bring there loves the place.One more thing,it is a loud restaurant.",5.0

"Gino's used to be one of the best spots for good pizza and Italian cuisine. Lately it's been hit or miss. Last time we went there (about a year ago) it wasn't that great. But last week was amazing. Everything from the salad to the delicious pasta entrees was just perfect. We only went because one of our fans is a huge fan of Gino's and is practically addicted to this place. I bet if he could move in there so that he can have his meals every day, he would!The wait staff was very friendly, and the service was quicker than usual. Improvements all around. Keep up the great work.  Still one of the best in the neighborhood. Check it out!",4.0
"My boyfriend is a nice Italian boy from Bay Ridge. When he took me to the restaurant he grew up eating at, I hoped I was in for a treat. However, both he and I were sorely disappointed. Service was lacking, and nearly non-existant. My eggplant parm was charred under all the cheese (yo! kitchen!  putting mozzarella on burnt food wont hide the taste!). Boyfriends shrimp pasta had, seriously, 4 mini shrimp on it. Fried calamari tasted fishy.I was hoping for a secret gem, and by the looks of it, Ginos was it. Maybe 15 years ago, though. Bummer.",2.0

"Along with Pizza Wagon and Bagel Boy, Gino's is one of the all-time great Bay Ridge food institutions. I've been going to Gino's for over 25 years (ok, shoot me now, I'm old) and it's as great as I can remember - something I can't say for other Italian restaurants in the neighborhood.The food is awesome and very reasonably-priced for what you get. Everything is very fresh and the portions are pretty big.The veal parmigiania I had a few weeks ago came with enough meat to feed an Army battalion. And it wasn't just big - it was nice and fresh and tasty, with none of the rubberiness you'll find at lesser joints.The same goes for the rest of the menu - everything at Gino's is top-shelf, and I know because I've had just about everything on the menu from the shrimp parmigiana to the penne with vodka sauce to the pizza to plain-old spaghetti and meatballs.Just be aware that Gino's gets seriously busy. At normal dinner hours (6-8), it's simply too crowded to get a table without waiting for 20-30 minutes at a minimum. Keep in mind though, that it's busy for a reason. The food really is that good. I recommend that you do what I do - arrive at 5:00 pm and eat with the old people.And oh yeah, the waiters don't act like @$$holes if you ask for more bread.That goes a long way with me.",5.0
Had a great lunch there today. Rigatoni with Sausage and Eggplant was excellent. Asked to charge my cell and they sat me at a table within reach of an outlet. Very authentic feel to the place and the service was fine.,4.0
"This pizza place used to be my #1 stop walking home from McKinley Junior High School in the mid/late 90s. This used to be a small pizza place with a few tables in the back and over time has expanded to a beautiful Italian restaurant. The food here is outstanding - one of the best pizza places in Bay Ridge. The waiters are always friendly and attentive and the service is usually quick. The restaurant can get loud, so stay away or go early if you don't like crowds. The fresh bread is addicting and it'll fill you up before they even bring you a massive plate of food if you're not careful. It takes forever to get seated on a weekend night, so make a reservation if you have a big group or get there early to beat the crowd. The wait is totally worth it!The last time I was there I ordered the penne with vodka sauce and my brother stuck with his standard chicken parmagiana with spaghetti. The prices are extremely reasonable and the portions are enormous. I've never left there without leftovers and haven't had a bad experience there. I just wish it wasn't so loud there when it gets really crowded but that's a small price to pay for the awesome food.",5.0

I will definitely return to Gino's.",5.0
"My favorite Italian place in Bay Ridge for about 12 years now. Food and service (both dine-in and delivery) are great. I've had nearly everything on the menu over the years and have never been disappointed. I particularly like their eggplant parm, hot antipasto, rigatoni w/chicken & peas in vodka sauce, veal parm, veal medallions, broccoli rabe, zuppa di mussels red, minestrone, etc etc etc...

"Delicious italian American food. Fresh, hearty servings, nice menu, good wine, loud restaurant, fun servers. I'm usually not a fan of over cheesed, over sauced 'italIan' food but I'll rock some rollatini at Gino's. I can't remember everything I've had here, its been a lot. All the pastas are good. I like the escarole and breadcrumb pasta, which reminds me of something I'd have in Tuscany. The simple tomato basil pasta is lovely. The apps are good. One day they had a special stuffed artichoke and I ate the whole thing and wouldn't charge it with my family. Whatever. I had the stuffed chicken entree which was enormous and yummy. My brother wont shut up about it. The sausage and broccoli rabbe does not disappoint. I have heard their desserts are fantastic but I have yet to try them. Wine selection is full of modest table wine options. Not bad at all. It is LOUD and full of families getting their eat on, this is not a romantic place. It's a restaurant you go to when the parents are in town and they are too uptight to try the amazing middle eastern food in bay ridge. It's a place you go to when you want to eat your weight in delicious pastas. It's a really good hang. Delivery is okay. Don't be lazy, just go there in person.",4.0
"Though I've never sat down here for a meal, this is my go-to pizza place. When I first moved to Bay Ridge, I was shocked- SHOCKED!- that finding good pizza in the area was no easy feat. After ordering from a few other places, I finally stumbled upon Gino's.The crust- in my opinion, the most important part of a good pizza- is both chewy and crisp. This is not a crust that you leave uneaten once all the cheese and sauce are gone. My favorite toppings are the eggplant- sliced and roasted, not breaded and fried- and the meatball- big, thick, flavorful slices of REAL meatballs.I totally recommend Gino's pizza to all in you're in the area.",4.0

My son and ordered takeout from  Gino's.  Delivery was well under an hour.  We ordered calamari knowing that it doesn't usually travel well but it was very good. I had the eggplant Parmesan and I am obsessed. Perfect texture and the sauce was fabulous. It came with a full size serving of ziti with sauce. Yum!. My son had the penne vodka.  Excellent. And the best part was that the servings were so large that I had leftovers for 2 nights! I will order from Gino's again.....and again.,4.0
"Twice we have been taken to Gino's by separate groups of friends who are Brooklyn Locals, each said it was one of the best Italian places around and they were both very right.Last trip I had the gnocchi with vodka and peas.  The pasta was perfect little pillows of goodness.  The vodka sauce was a perfect balance to tomatoey acid and rich cream.  I got the half order and it was larger than many restaurants full gnocchi plates.  My wife got the grilled chicken, which could have fed her for two days. The chicken was tender, juicy and well seasoned.Just a classic, quality Italian joint.  I highly recommend it.",4.0
Order here all the time. My boyfriend gets penne a la vodka with grill chicken and I get eggplant pram or chicken pram. Banging.,5.0
"I don't like these fancy italian restaurants.  I usually like the cheap, no frills, authentic family owned italian pizzerias for real italian food in Brooklyn.  I went here for a birthday dinner on a wednesday night.  We waited about 10 mins for our party of 11 to be seated even after making a reservation.  Everyone enjoyed their food.  They serve bread and butter and you can tell it was fresh of the day!  The calamari has got to be the best calamari I've had in my life! Easy to chew and cut up.  It was not gummy at all!!!  And the side Marinara sauce was very delicious!  They serve huge entrees, so many of us shared! My chicken francaise was good! Not the best, but pretty good!  The String beans were the best I've ever had! They were fresh and crisp! They didn't overcook them like at many other places and they were definitely not from a can!  Then we had a dessert sampler for the table!  Tiramisu was okay (I've had better), I didn't try the Tartuffo, but the cheesecake was the best!!!! Super fresh and soft!  Definitely not a Junior's cheesecake!  It was my first time and will definitely be coming back!  Although, I heard the lines are insane on weekends!",4.0
"YOU WILL LOVE THIS PLACE!  If you live in Brooklyn, you will know Gino's.  This is not just another Italian restaurant you may find in Little Italy.  Let's just say the food truly does speak for itself here.  Believe it or not, I've only had the food to-go the past years, due to the very busy lines on the weekends.  So I finally went with a friend this week, and boy, we both left with huge smiles on our face.  HUGE!   =DTUESDAY WINE SPECIAL:  We went on a Tuesday night, and thank goodness we did.  They have 1/2 off selected wine bottles.  The prices for the bottles ranged from $10 - 15 per bottle after the discount.  Can you believe this?  I was so overly excited to see the listing, and immediately asked our waiter to recommend a nice red.  We had the Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon ($10), and it was excellent.  Repeat...price is PER bottle.      FOOD:  So here goes the food review.  So I never really order stuffed artichokes much, b/c I guess I never really had it good elsewhere.  When we saw everyone getting it, we just had to try it.  It was part of their specials for the night.  OMG!  We ate that sucker down to the choke and were dipping away with our bread, down to the very last drop of the wine/garlic/lemon sauce it was bathing in.  I'm still in OMG mode.  My mouth will always water when I think about Gino's pasta.  I will never go wrong with my Rigatoni w/ eggplant & sausage.  Hands down, this is MY dish and it is consistent every time I order it.  Pasta is always al dente!  My friend ordered the special- homemade cavatelli w/ sausage & cabbage.  Honestly, I didn't want to say it, but his dish was definitely up their in the ranks of possibly being another favorite, but I couldn't let it outshine my rigatoni.  So i cordially complimented his dish and continued to rave about mine.  LOL.  I noticed at this point, we both were enjoying the food & wine so much, that we had the hugest smiles on our face (the bottle of wine was almost done).  MISC:  It was a full house on a Tuesday night.  The service is very good - the waiters are quick on their feet and definitely know what they're doing. Not to mention, most of them are pleasing to the eye and have a smile on their face - a definite plus in my book.  Perfect date spot, girls nite, family nite, whatever it is, you and your party will leave with a big smile.  =DPlease do yourself a favor and pay a visit to Gino's  You will not regret it!  Happy eating!  Did I say 1/2 off wine bottles on Tuesdays?  Woohoo!",5.0
"So my friends decided to treat me to an early birthday dinner, so that was a pleasant surprise! I used to go to Gino's when I was in junior high school (ten years ago), so this place bring back fond memories. The dinner was pretty good too - I ordered a pasta dish, bowtie with mushrooms and peas- nothing amazing, but not bad. My two friends ordered the linguini with clams and mussels, and they liked it.

"This place had the nerve to call my friend about the review I wrote about them and basically wanting her to call me to take it down. I didn't tell my friend I wrote a review so when they called she had no idea what they were talking about since they wouldnt tell her what I wrote. They asked them about the food, which as you can see above I said this review was NEVER about the food. Never once did they address the fact that the manager was a complete douche bag to her. So message to Gino's instead of calling my friend about a yelp review, worry about that shitty manager you have on staff.

"My favorite Italian restaurant...so far, by far.This place is immaculately clean, the service is above par and the food is consistently good.  When you factor in the very reasonable prices, you get an Italian joint worthy of 5 stars.Make sure to try their Vodka rigatoni with grilled chicken. The creamiest yet heartiest vodka sauce I've had in a while. Also, the fried zucchini is to die for, it doesn't taste like fryer oil like it does in some places.  The key here is attention to detail and great food without crossing the ""fancy"" line. Italian restaurants are sorta bipolar in NYC, some are the cheap restaurant row type, some just try too hard and you end up with a tiny portion of some Italian-fusion type mess...Gino's gets it just right.",5.0
My son and ordered takeout from  Gino's.  Delivery was well under an hour.  We ordered calamari knowing that it doesn't usually travel well but it was very good. I had the eggplant Parmesan and I am obsessed. Perfect texture and the sauce was fabulous. It came with a full size serving of ziti with sauce. Yum!. My son had the penne vodka.  Excellent. And the best part was that the servings were so large that I had leftovers for 2 nights! I will order from Gino's again.....and again.,4.0
"Twice we have been taken to Gino's by separate groups of friends who are Brooklyn Locals, each said it was one of the best Italian places around and they were both very right.Last trip I had the gnocchi with vodka and peas.  The pasta was perfect little pillows of goodness.  The vodka sauce was a perfect balance to tomatoey acid and rich cream.  I got the half order and it was larger than many restaurants full gnocchi plates.  My wife got the grilled chicken, which could have fed her for two days. The chicken was tender, juicy and well seasoned.Just a classic, quality Italian joint.  I highly recommend it.",4.0
Order here all the time. My boyfriend gets penne a la vodka with grill chicken and I get eggplant pram or chicken pram. Banging.,5.0
"I don't like these fancy italian restaurants.  I usually like the cheap, no frills, authentic family owned italian pizzerias for real italian food in Brooklyn.  I went here for a birthday dinner on a wednesday night.  We waited about 10 mins for our party of 11 to be seated even after making a reservation.  Everyone enjoyed their food.  They serve bread and butter and you can tell it was fresh of the day!  The calamari has got to be the best calamari I've had in my life! Easy to chew and cut up.  It was not gummy at all!!!  And the side Marinara sauce was very delicious!  They serve huge entrees, so many of us shared! My chicken francaise was good! Not the best, but pretty good!  The String beans were the best I've ever had! They were fresh and crisp! They didn't overcook them like at many other places and they were definitely not from a can!  Then we had a dessert sampler for the table!  Tiramisu was okay (I've had better), I didn't try the Tartuffo, but the cheesecake was the best!!!! Super fresh and soft!  Definitely not a Junior's cheesecake!  It was my first time and will definitely be coming back!  Although, I heard the lines are insane on weekends!",4.0
"YOU WILL LOVE THIS PLACE!  If you live in Brooklyn, you will know Gino's.  This is not just another Italian restaurant you may find in Little Italy.  Let's just say the food truly does speak for itself here.  Believe it or not, I've only had the food to-go the past years, due to the very busy lines on the weekends.  So I finally went with a friend this week, and boy, we both left with huge smiles on our face.  HUGE!   =DTUESDAY WINE SPECIAL:  We went on a Tuesday night, and thank goodness we did.  They have 1/2 off selected wine bottles.  The prices for the bottles ranged from $10 - 15 per bottle after the discount.  Can you believe this?  I was so overly excited to see the listing, and immediately asked our waiter to recommend a nice red.  We had the Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon ($10), and it was excellent.  Repeat...price is PER bottle.      FOOD:  So here goes the food review.  So I never really order stuffed artichokes much, b/c I guess I never really had it good elsewhere.  When we saw everyone getting it, we just had to try it.  It was part of their specials for the night.  OMG!  We ate that sucker down to the choke and were dipping away with our bread, down to the very last drop of the wine/garlic/lemon sauce it was bathing in.  I'm still in OMG mode.  My mouth will always water when I think about Gino's pasta.  I will never go wrong with my Rigatoni w/ eggplant & sausage.  Hands down, this is MY dish and it is consistent every time I order it.  Pasta is always al dente!  My friend ordered the special- homemade cavatelli w/ sausage & cabbage.  Honestly, I didn't want to say it, but his dish was definitely up their in the ranks of possibly being another favorite, but I couldn't let it outshine my rigatoni.  So i cordially complimented his dish and continued to rave about mine.  LOL.  I noticed at this point, we both were enjoying the food & wine so much, that we had the hugest smiles on our face (the bottle of wine was almost done).  MISC:  It was a full house on a Tuesday night.  The service is very good - the waiters are quick on their feet and definitely know what they're doing. Not to mention, most of them are pleasing to the eye and have a smile on their face - a definite plus in my book.  Perfect date spot, girls nite, family nite, whatever it is, you and your party will leave with a big smile.  =DPlease do yourself a favor and pay a visit to Gino's  You will not regret it!  Happy eating!  Did I say 1/2 off wine bottles on Tuesdays?  Woohoo!",5.0
"So my friends decided to treat me to an early birthday dinner, so that was a pleasant surprise! I used to go to Gino's when I was in junior high school (ten years ago), so this place bring back fond memories. The dinner was pretty good too - I ordered a pasta dish, bowtie with mushrooms and peas- nothing amazing, but not bad. My two friends ordered the linguini with clams and mussels, and they liked it. And my other friend ordered the rigatoni and italian sausage, and she liked it too. But I think my favorite dish was the appetizer--The baked clams, eggplant rollatine, and fried calamari in one dish were just too good!  However, one event that marred the evening is that we suddenly had missing cash while we were paying the bill!

"I am not sure how it is that I never got around to having a meal at Gino's before last week; I certainly always meant to, but I guess it just kept slipping my mind.Although I confess, there might have been some reluctance hiding really deep inside due to the place striking me as very, very old school...like one of the old-fashioned Italian restaurants I'd frequent with my family as a kid.Which means that before last week, I was pretty much an idiot.Yes, it is EXTREMELY old school; the interior is dark, the decor is almost depressingly 1970s...or even 1950s. Which doesn't matter AT ALL.  The FOOD is pretty damn terrific.Nothing particularly innovative on the menu, mind you...which is a GOOD THING, in my book. For example, when a dish comes with a sauce, I want A SAUCE, not this fussy frou-frou dot-dot-dot-on-the-plate-and-that-they-CALL-sauce nonsense.  Nope: as befits a no-B.S. old-school Italian joint, we each got an honest portion of authentic, no-B.S. SAUCE with our entrees.  My wife's shrimp oreganata was buttery, herby, delicious, and served in a very generous heap - and they even peeled off the tails, a nice touch.  My chicken francese was excellent, lemony and rich but light, served as two BIG scallopini - and they took the time to pound the cutlets, which made them incredibly tender.  Not every place bothers to do that.  The chicken was served with my choice of roasted potatoes, done perfectly, with the requisite but elsewhere-often-missing crispy exterior and with an ample but not overpowering garnish of rosemary baked in - absolutely delicious.  We split a side order of perfectly-prepared broccoli (I love broccoli in a good Italian restaurant; you order just ""broccoli"" and know you'll be getting it sauteed in olive oil with garlic.  That says ""home"" to me.)Uncharacteristically - because our meals had been so good, we really just NEEDED to try more stuff  - we each had dessert.  Mine was an incredibly light but creamy creme brulee, glazed with the perfect thin/crunchy caramelized sugar topping.  Heaven.  My wife's was Italian cheesecake, which was pretty miraculous: made with ricotta, yes, but not dry like too many Italian cheesecakes.All this and two soft drinks, only about $64 before the tip.  More than reasonable for such fine fare.  Of course, we were stuffed, but how could we help it?A few more plusses I don't want to forget: excellent bread for the table, with whipped butter so you can actually spread it on your bread (another nice touch; this place is GREAT at nice touches).  A pitcher of cold water for the table right away - always appreciated.  And immaculately clean restrooms - no small thing, not always encountered, very welcome when they are.The place was PACKED on an undistinguished mid-week night: I'm not surprised.You wanna know Brooklyn as it's been forever, before hip chic came to dominate the Northern half of the boro?  Come to Gino's in the Southern part: this is as Brooklyn as it gets.  Fine food on your plate; Sinatra and Pavarotti on the sound system - what more can you ask for?  We'll be back, for sure.  And we'll sample the pizza soon, too.",5.0

"This place is HANDS DOWN the awesomest Italian place I have ever yet experienced.This place is busy basically every single day of the week, except for Monday because that's their closing day. Valet parking, friendly waiter service ..upscale ambiance.Their food is absolutely delicious. I've been a customer at Gino's for over 10 years and everytime I go there I have yet not ever been dissapointed with a dish. Their menu is a bit pricy but you definetely get your  money's worth at this place. My all time favorite dish is the Grilled chicken breast with roasted potatoes and broccoli rabe  ..amaziiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing ! Penne a la vodka, yummy calamari ! I have no words to describe my LOVE for this place :D hahaa The staff is pretty cool, you have a full bar with imported Italian wine ..this restaurant is absolutely amazing in and out ..beautiful location and a great atmosphere. It's HUGE ! It's busy 24/7 with loaded people coming in and out but somehow you always manage to find a great seating place. It's not one of those restaurants where you have to wait for hours because it's a top notch restaurant, this place is absolutely amazing and the service is incredibly good.Top notch Italian food !",4.0
"We came to visit my mother-in-law who lives in Brooklyn and was told by a good friend who lived in the Brooklyn area that Gino's was spectacular. We decided to check it out for ourselves. We were very impressed by the real Italian feel in the restaurant. Everything was nicely put together in the restaurant and most of all it looked VERY clean. It looked like a very ""adult"" type of atmosphere, BUT we have a toddler who runs around and no one seemed to mind when she started circling around our table over and over again. There was also a nice changing area in their restroom. The food was great! We ordered the Fried Calamari and Fried Zucchini for appetizers, Veal Medallions, Lobster Ravioli, the Chicken Rollatine with Mushrooms and 2 personal pepperoni pizzas. The calamari and zucchini were phenomenal, so light and tasty with the marinara sacue. My husband really enjoyed his veal medallions, we all tried a piece of the lobster ravioli and found it VERY GOOD(highly recommend) and if you are a chicken-lover the chicken rotalline is perfect and has a slight tang from the wine, the best part is it has oozing mozzarella cheese coming out of it as you slice into it. The pizza would have been perfect, but I found the pepperoni a little too salty. Maybe we should have ordered the cheese pizza alone instead? The service was very friendly and professional as well. I would definitely come back. Thank you Gino's!",4.0
"Wow, I thought, it's quite busy for a Tuesday night. Aside from 1 or 2 empty tables, it was a full house. Lucky for us, a table for 2 did not require any wait time. We were given warm ciabatta and italian bread after we were seated.  The olive oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic and oil dip was excellent for the warm bread.We ordered the Zuppa di Mussels (white sauce) and Whole Wheat Penne w/ fresh mozzerella, tomato and basil. The mussels came with 4 pcs of garlic toast. Very yummy dipped into the mussel broth. The mussels were tasty. As for our pasta, it was good. But the vodka sauce I had last time was much more memorable. And my friend agreed. Service was friendly but we did have to flag a busboy once or twice b/c they weren't around. Prices are reaonable for portions that can be shared by 2 people (as my friend and I did). Nice local Italian restaurant.",4.0
"Quite place in Bay Ridge, classy feel with good food and service.Atmosphere is very cozy and warm (and cramped if you have a number of people like I did). Upon entrance, the pizza scents already greet you by the time you ask about your reservation.Got seated quickly with water in our cups. Ordered the fried calamari, fried zucchini for appetizers and numerous entrees. The calamari was pretty tasty and in abundance, we requested and quickly got more sauce from the attentive service. Zucchini?, it was okay, nothing that stuck out.For entrees, I got the salmon dish - delicious selection. Nicely cooked without an attack of sauces and a right amount of spinach in a great portion size - very enjoyable.I must note, the other dishes, the filet mignon and steak were fantastic (sampled a cube of these - medium is perfect!). Also, gnocchi, penne with veggies, and ravioli were so beautiful to look at and great to taste. I really liked the bites of the gnocchi, chewy and flavorful with the complementing sauce.Of course, there must be some wine for such a lovely meal. Got a bottle of montepulciano, dry but went well with the meal for everyone so much that we ordered another (c'mon, a bunch of friends with rarely a time to spend together? - more vino!)To end the night, a few ordered the cheesecake, tiramisu, and mousse. They all looked great (wish my full stomach didn't block my from getting my camera and getting a taste).Overall, very fun and enjoyable experience - great service, good food, easy to get to from the subway and bus stops.Note: get a reservation for a large group, the place was packed when I arrived - can't imagine our wait time if we just waltzed in.",4.0

"What makes Gino's special is not the incredible service one gets every time they come here, nor its prime location in Bay Ridge, but instead the consistency of high quality food that comes out of the kitchen here. In my ten years plus of coming to Gino's, not once have I left disappointed. Whether it's the delicious shrimp marinara or grilled chicken breast, or even the penne a la vodka, every dish at Gino's is top notch. Gino's is packed with loyal patrons from all over Brooklyn every single night of the week, sans Mondays (it's closed), showing that plenty of Brooklynites agree that Gino's is one of the best restaurants Bay Ridge has to offer. The appetizers and desserts here also never fail to disappoint, as Gino's is one of the rare places that gets Italian appetizers right.Gino's uses the best ingredients, and is always at the top of its game. Highly recommended for anyone in Bay Ridge, even if your looking for a quick takeout slice.",5.0

However they seem to have issues with pasta dishes. The baked ziti is overcooked and bland. And 2 weeks ago a member of our group had the ravioli and found it to be very bland. So Gino's is great for everything except pasta.",3.0
"This place is HANDS DOWN the awesomest Italian place I have ever yet experienced.This place is busy basically every single day of the week, except for Monday because that's their closing day. Valet parking, friendly waiter service ..upscale ambiance.Their food is absolutely delicious. I've been a customer at Gino's for over 10 years and everytime I go there I have yet not ever been dissapointed with a dish. Their menu is a bit pricy but you definetely get your  money's worth at this place. My all time favorite dish is the Grilled chicken breast with roasted potatoes and broccoli rabe  ..amaziiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing ! Penne a la vodka, yummy calamari ! I have no words to describe my LOVE for this place :D hahaa The staff is pretty cool, you have a full bar with imported Italian wine ..this restaurant is absolutely amazing in and out ..beautiful location and a great atmosphere. It's HUGE ! It's busy 24/7 with loaded people coming in and out but somehow you always manage to find a great seating place. It's not one of those restaurants where you have to wait for hours because it's a top notch restaurant, this place is absolutely amazing and the service is incredibly good.Top notch Italian food !",4.0
"We came to visit my mother-in-law who lives in Brooklyn and was told by a good friend who lived in the Brooklyn area that Gino's was spectacular. We decided to check it out for ourselves. We were very impressed by the real Italian feel in the restaurant. Everything was nicely put together in the restaurant and most of all it looked VERY clean. It looked like a very ""adult"" type of atmosphere, BUT we have a toddler who runs around and no one seemed to mind when she started circling around our table over and over again. There was also a nice changing area in their restroom. The food was great! We ordered the Fried Calamari and Fried Zucchini for appetizers, Veal Medallions, Lobster Ravioli, the Chicken Rollatine with Mushrooms and 2 personal pepperoni pizzas. The calamari and zucchini were phenomenal, so light and tasty with the marinara sacue. My husband really enjoyed his veal medallions, we all tried a piece of the lobster ravioli and found it VERY GOOD(highly recommend) and if you are a chicken-lover the chicken rotalline is perfect and has a slight tang from the wine, the best part is it has oozing mozzarella cheese coming out of it as you slice into it. The pizza would have been perfect, but I found the pepperoni a little too salty. Maybe we should have ordered the cheese pizza alone instead? The service was very friendly and professional as well. I would definitely come back. Thank you Gino's!",4.0
"Wow, I thought, it's quite busy for a Tuesday night. Aside from 1 or 2 empty tables, it was a full house. Lucky for us, a table for 2 did not require any wait time. We were given warm ciabatta and italian bread after we were seated.  The olive oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic and oil dip was excellent for the warm bread.We ordered the Zuppa di Mussels (white sauce) and Whole Wheat Penne w/ fresh mozzerella, tomato and basil. The mussels came with 4 pcs of garlic toast. Very yummy dipped into the mussel broth. The mussels were tasty. As for our pasta, it was good. But the vodka sauce I had last time was much more memorable. And my friend agreed. Service was friendly but we did have to flag a busboy once or twice b/c they weren't around. Prices are reaonable for portions that can be shared by 2 people (as my friend and I did). Nice local Italian restaurant.",4.0
"Quite place in Bay Ridge, classy feel with good food and service.Atmosphere is very cozy and warm (and cramped if you have a number of people like I did). Upon entrance, the pizza scents already greet you by the time you ask about your reservation.Got seated quickly with water in our cups. Ordered the fried calamari, fried zucchini for appetizers and numerous entrees. The calamari was pretty tasty and in abundance, we requested and quickly got more sauce from the attentive service. Zucchini?, it was okay, nothing that stuck out.For entrees, I got the salmon dish - delicious selection. Nicely cooked without an attack of sauces and a right amount of spinach in a great portion size - very enjoyable.I must note, the other dishes, the filet mignon and steak were fantastic (sampled a cube of these - medium is perfect!). Also, gnocchi, penne with veggies, and ravioli were so beautiful to look at and great to taste. I really liked the bites of the gnocchi, chewy and flavorful with the complementing sauce.Of course, there must be some wine for such a lovely meal. Got a bottle of montepulciano, dry but went well with the meal for everyone so much that we ordered another (c'mon, a bunch of friends with rarely a time to spend together? - more vino!)To end the night, a few ordered the cheesecake, tiramisu, and mousse. They all looked great (wish my full stomach didn't block my from getting my camera and getting a taste).Overall, very fun and enjoyable experience - great service, good food, easy to get to from the subway and bus stops.Note: get a reservation for a large group, the place was packed when I arrived - can't imagine our wait time if we just waltzed in.",4.0
"Gino's was recommended to us by the owner of the brownstone we rented in Bay Ridge. From the hot antipasto appetizer to the creme brulee, the food is DELECTABLE.  The linguine in white clam sauce is delicious.  My mouth is watering now just thinking about it.  The staff is super friendly.  I would highly recommend a trip to Gino's.  The portions are large, so go hungry.  I loved it.  Best Italian meal I've ever had.",5.0
"Waiting line is never enjoyable! But for the pizza they make I would wait for an hour. The waiter was a little bit snob to us, but this is what you get form an Italian place. We had to chase him down to re-order drinks. The menu has a lot of selections, but we ordered the well famous Gino's pizza and it was amazing! Not to greasy, just perfect.... I still have the taste in my mouth!",4.0

"What makes Gino's special is not the incredible service one gets every time they come here, nor its prime location in Bay Ridge, but instead the consistency of high quality food that comes out of the kitchen here. In my ten years plus of coming to Gino's, not once have I left disappointed. Whether it's the delicious shrimp marinara or grilled chicken breast, or even the penne a la vodka, every dish at Gino's is top notch. Gino's is packed with loyal patrons from all over Brooklyn every single night of the week, sans Mondays (it's closed), showing that plenty of Brooklynites agree that Gino's is one of the best restaurants Bay Ridge has to offer. The appetizers and desserts here also never fail to disappoint, as Gino's is one of the rare places that gets Italian appetizers right.Gino's uses the best ingredients, and is always at the top of its game. Highly recommended for anyone in Bay Ridge, even if your looking for a quick takeout slice.",5.0
"The food is delicious and if you just want a slice of Pizza that is delicious to.  No need to look any place else the food is always fresh and taste good.The men making the pizza are very cordial, polite and friendly.   The restaurant part the waitors are great and the food is excellent.  I couldn't make better Italian food myself.  If your looking for a good Italian resturant this is where to go.   If you are going on a weekend make sure you have a reservation.  It is always crowded.  They also have valet parking which is great esp. for 5th Avenue.",5.0
"Gino's brought back very fond memories of my residence in Italy back when I was 14. The taste was very authentic and the atmosphere was quite loud but made me feel quite at home. I had a delicious special salad of house greens, pine nuts, goat cheese, and portobello mushroom, followed with a grilled chicken breast, with broccoli rabe in a white wine lemon sauce. Both dishes were outstanding and flavorful but not overpowering with sauce or dressing. A friend of my mine had the lasagna which i so generously offered a taste, which was simply perfect. I foresee many visits to Gino's in the future as there are so many other dishes to choose from. The wait service was quite attentive so overall I rate Gino a must visit if you visit the Big Apple.",5.0
"Great food, great atmosphere, friendly service. It's not perfect though. Nothing ever is. Over the past couple of years I've noticed that the portions have gotten smaller (e.g. I now get 5 shrimp instead of 8 when i order whatever that shrimp dish is that i usually get).Also they don't take reservations unless you have a large party. This can be quite annoying, especially when you take a date here and there is a mob of families and couples waiting to be seated in front of you. So then you're forced to stand outside because there's no waiting room inside (usually a 15-30 minute wait around primetime [5-7 pm]) which isn't that bad, unless it's -1000 degrees out like it has been lately.But aside from these 2 minuscule complaints, I have nothing but praise for this fine Italian eatery.",4.0

"I just had dinner here with a friend tonight.  My friend has been here before, but I haven't. So, i want to give it a try.  We had Mussels with white sauce for appetizer, my friend had spinach salad, i had Rigatoni with Grilled Chicken and Peas in Vodka Sauce. we shared the food, so we get to taste everything. Then we shared a Tartufo for dessert since we were full already. Overall, the food were great, i enjoyed her company for the night since I just called her at a last minute after work.  We sat outdoor with heat. So it was actually very comfortable, except i felt cold after eating ice-cream.  We were lucky that we were there like before 7pm, when we finish eating & came out( about 8:45p), i think it was like 8-10 people wait. So, yes, better call ahead for Fridays & weekends. Thanks to my friend's suggestion. I had a nice dinner & evening.",3.0

"There are no salt or pepper shakers at this place. That should tell you something about the quality and consistency of the food. The food is exemplary. I had the pene vodka pasta, which was PERFECTLY aldente, and the chicken fricassee. The chicken was perfectly infused with lemon and cooked to a standard most places don't do. My girlfriend had the gnocci, which was amazing, and the sauce was more than marinara - it was heaven. For appetizer we had a simple plate of mozzarella, tomatoes and roasted peppers with basil - hard to mess up, but we enjoyed it very much. The service was immaculate. Aside from the flawlessly timed ""cheese or fresh pepper"" guys. the waiter was there pouring wine and taking orders, suggesting sides to go with wine and even considering our dietary habits - always there when we wanted him, but never when we didn't. Extremely good service. With all of this we had two bottles of wine. The cost? $86 + tip.  Highly recommended for a romantic dinner out, especially if you can get outdoor seating, as they have a quiet outdoor backyard area. Exceptional Italian restaurant! 10/10, will eat at again.",5.0

"I have been here before and had a great experience but this time it was completely different. We ordered delivery and waited for an hour. When the food did not show up we called them to find out.

After no call for another 15 min I called them and got mixed answer saying they ""called"" us many times. Instead of apologizing and making amends for having us wait almost 2 hours the response I got from the manager was that they can restart our order. There was no accountability and no attempts to help us. Instead I was given the run around by 3 different people. And while on the phone with them I was getting another call from an unknown number.

I went with the ravioli and was disappointed to see more sauce on the plate than ravioli. I mean, these little pasta pouches were drowning! I also tasted the gnocchi, which were delicious.

"My hubby and I went here one night with my in-laws, it was my first time and just walking by the pizza out front I knew I was going to like this place. (I love NY pizza but its rare just looking at some makes me want it)Our waiter was friendly and took our orders quickly, it took a while to get the food though. I had the best Chicken Francaise I ever had in my life at this place, seriously, THE BEST!  The chicken was tender and the sauce was perfect-not too lemony or garlicy like I usually have had. They give 2 decent size portions of meat and a regular average size portion of roasted potatoes with it, I wasn't crazy about the potatoes but they were good the only other option for my side was string beans so that would be my only complaint-offer more side dishes.My MIL ordered a special which is three courses for $25 and she loved it, and even got dessert with her meal which was three mini cannolis everyone else loved them, I loved the filling but the shells were really crispy and I like them a bit softer but that is personal preference.Hubby got the veal and he loved it, said it was very tender and the sauce was delicious.FIL got two appetizers for dinner, I don't eat seafood, but I can tell when it's properly cooked, and just by looking at the calamari you can tell its perfect, nice and tender without being rubbery or fishy. Food takes a while to come out from the kitchen and looking at the delicious stuff others were eating didn't help either, but it was worth the wait!!! Can't wait to go back and try the pizza!If you don't believe the great reviews, try going at night and see how long you have to wait for a table!",5.0
"While visiting my sister in brooklyn yesterday we had a much needed italian family dinner. let me tell you about it.Gino's is a nice looking place, gets very busy its pretty big and it reminds me of my childhood working around italian places, now on to the food.As an Italian American chef raised on this food i have alot to say:I had the filet with roasted potato and spinach, it was a great size for $30 the spinach was alittle bitter for my taste and lacked garlic (the garlic i had was burnt so it didnt help the flavor) and needed salt. What made me sad was the gnocchi, i love that pasta and although theres isnt made fresh wat bothered me was the gravy (tomato sauce) was very acidic, now if u dont know what that taste like u get the flavor of a tin can after the food goes down, this is something easily fixed by adding alittle salt to the sauce or cooking it with whole carrots and discarding  them after the cooking process. The Monti red we had was decent but again nothing special, and for me, i can only speak for me when u give bread at the table 2 things should be there 1. Olive oil and salt or 2.

I love this place so much. The food is delicious and the portions are HUGE. Seriously I don't think I've ever left without taking something to go. Have the tiramisu for dessert. Its amazing and also huge..good for sharing.,5.0
"I had high hopes before going and was still pleased upon walking in; Gino's is very inviting. The beginning: The bread was alright -- nothing special. We ordered fried zucchini and fresh mozzarella for appetizers, and I was pleased with both. The middle: Most of the entrees looked really good. I went with the ravioli and was disappointed to see more sauce on the plate than ravioli. I mean, these little pasta pouches were drowning! I also tasted the gnocchi, which were delicious. The end: For dessert, I had the tartufo, which I highly recommend; the chocolate coating was out of this world. Overall, it was good. I am not rushing to go again, but I wouldn't reject the invitation.",3.0
"Im here at least once a month for the past 5 years. Best italian food in Brooklyn. I just dont see how they turn a profit, its like they are giving the food away. The water is even outstanding. The ONLY problem i have here is waiting forever for my food but, i mean it took god seven days to make the earth. perfection takes time.",5.0
"Came here for dinner with a friend, unfortunately I came on the day I was sick with a cold, so everything was tasteless for me I tried sniffing the food but still the scent didn't quite pick up due to my stuffy nose. I had pasta and soup I believe. Although I couldn't taste it entirely I did get a bit flavor and it was alright. Place is a bit pricey I'd say for such small entrees. But I'll definitely come back again when I'm feeling better. Heard the pizza was good so maybe that's worth checking out over the pasta and such.",3.0

"My hubby and I went here one night with my in-laws, it was my first time and just walking by the pizza out front I knew I was going to like this place. (I love NY pizza but its rare just looking at some makes me want it)Our waiter was friendly and took our orders quickly, it took a while to get the food though. I had the best Chicken Francaise I ever had in my life at this place, seriously, THE BEST!  The chicken was tender and the sauce was perfect-not too lemony or garlicy like I usually have had. They give 2 decent size portions of meat and a regular average size portion of roasted potatoes with it, I wasn't crazy about the potatoes but they were good the only other option for my side was string beans so that would be my only complaint-offer more side dishes.My MIL ordered a special which is three courses for $25 and she loved it, and even got dessert with her meal which was three mini cannolis everyone else loved them, I loved the filling but the shells were really crispy and I like them a bit softer but that is personal preference.Hubby got the veal and he loved it, said it was very tender and the sauce was delicious.FIL got two appetizers for dinner, I don't eat seafood, but I can tell when it's properly cooked, and just by looking at the calamari you can tell its perfect, nice and tender without being rubbery or fishy. Food takes a while to come out from the kitchen and looking at the delicious stuff others were eating didn't help either, but it was worth the wait!!! Can't wait to go back and try the pizza!If you don't believe the great reviews, try going at night and see how long you have to wait for a table!",5.0
"While visiting my sister in brooklyn yesterday we had a much needed italian family dinner. let me tell you about it.Gino's is a nice looking place, gets very busy its pretty big and it reminds me of my childhood working around italian places, now on to the food.As an Italian American chef raised on this food i have alot to say:I had the filet with roasted potato and spinach, it was a great size for $30 the spinach was alittle bitter for my taste and lacked garlic (the garlic i had was burnt so it didnt help the flavor) and needed salt. What made me sad was the gnocchi, i love that pasta and although theres isnt made fresh wat bothered me was the gravy (tomato sauce) was very acidic, now if u dont know what that taste like u get the flavor of a tin can after the food goes down, this is something easily fixed by adding alittle salt to the sauce or cooking it with whole carrots and discarding  them after the cooking process. The Monti red we had was decent but again nothing special, and for me, i can only speak for me when u give bread at the table 2 things should be there 1. Olive oil and salt or 2. Olive oil with fresh chopped garlic and crushed red pepper flakes.  Not shitting on Gino's but again this is only my opinion, but im sure they have the volume of customers to worry about and not one chef's opinion.  I would go again but i wouldnt order anything with tomato sauce, i fear the acid would cause heart burn and ruin my meal.  Should you try it sure why not Gino's by all means isnt bad but for someone hard to please as i am becareful on what u order.  Gratzi ciao ciao e Forza Italia, chef Fuoco",3.0

"Went at 3:30 on a Saturday afternoon and there was a line of people waiting.  Very good sign.  Our fellow diners were very friendly, making small talk and smiling, which added to the great vibe of the place.  Now for the food.  To start we had the house salad which had slices of red peppers, olives and a very tasty yet light dressing  - not your ordinary run of the mill salad. For the entree I had pistaccio crusted red snapper in a pink sauce.  It was seasoned perfectly and was just delicious.  We couldn't decide between the creme brulee or Italian cheesecake for dessert.  Went with the creme brulee.  The cream was a bit heavier than the traditional creme brulee, but nonetheless was amazing as well.  I will definitely be back.",5.0

"I just read a bunch of reviews for this place and I wonder if I went to a different place?? I  just came home from a party at Gino's and I must say that I was severely disappointed and shocked to see people waiting for an hour when I left. Is there something that me and my family are missing? I started my meal with the hot antipasta which consisted of baked clams, a big shrimp, fried calamari and eggplant rollatini. I don't eat eggplant or calamari but my daughter said they were good. Our clams were chewy and one of mine were gritty. My shrimp was very tough but hers was ok. The mozzarella sticks were solid chunks of cheese - not at all melty or gooey. Our next course was the pasta. We had the penne w/ asparagus and red peppers. The pasta was so al dente that it was borderline raw. My husband had penne with marinara sauce which tasted overly  salty. Onto the main course - we got the grilled chicken with potatoes and broccoli rabe. The broccoli rabe was prepared very well and tasty. The chicken however was overly charred/grilled and not to our liking. From the kid's menu, our daughter got the generously sized pizza which was quite tasty.The desserts were another let down. My spumoni tasted freezer burned and the cake they served was ok. The ice cold beers were really good!",2.0
"Great food, great service, great food, great prices, great food, great atmosphere.  Did I mention great food?  In case you missed it, the food @ Gino's is the best in Italian culinary delights.  Absolutely one of my all time favorite restaurants.  You can bring your whole family & not break the bank. Great for dates, girls/guys night out, celebrations, or just a nice dinner with your partner.  Gino's is often pack (duh!), but the wait is not that long & well worth it.  Parking is rough, but they do offer valet parking.  So go to Gino's & bring the family.  Eat to your hearts content.  Mangiare al vostro contenuto di cuori",5.0

Whatever, it's good eating here. Enjoy.",4.0
"Went to this place a few times, mostly for pizza.  The pizza is decent, though I've had better (try the corner of Bay Ridge Ave and 4th Ave).  The dinner menu was decent, though not memorable.  The wine was ok, the pasta cooked right but the sauce lacking a little in flavor.  The chicken was a little dry but not terrible.  Maybe next time I'll try something else.",3.0
"Gino's the place we go for good solid Italian in Bay Ridge. Everything we have ordered other than a so-so lasagna has been fantastic. My favorite dish is grilled chicken over broccoli rabe and potatoes. AWESOME. Their pasta dishes are also great with the pasta always being al dente and not being completely drowned in sauce. The pizza is also about as good as you can get. We usually get delivery but have also eaten in and everything was nice. There is a reason why there is often a wait outside.

"Before I even moved to Bay Ridge, I was told that I must go to Gino's, as it was the best pizza and Italian food in all of Brooklyn.  I had ordered pizza once and it was good, although not mind-blowing.  Last night, my mom was in town and I was in the mood for Italian, so we headed to Gino's.This place was packed and it was only Tuesday - I took that as a good sign.  We were first seated near a large and loud party - a big family who brought grandma and grandpa, who were obviously deaf.  I didn't think I could take an evening of ""Ma, do you want pasta?  MA!"" so I asked the waiter if we could switch tables, and they put us by the window.  It was still loud but in a much better way.  This is definitely not the place to go on an intimate date, but perfect if you have loud friends or family and want them to blend in.I couldn't decide between pasta or an entree, so I opted for a half-plate of the gnocchi in a fresh tomato basil and mozzarella sauce.  It was yumtastic - the sauce was so fresh and had great flavor.  So many sauces in restaurants are just ""blah"" but this was great.  I chose veal parmigiana for my entree and again, it was great.  A perfect amount of cheese and fantastic sauce.  I wish I could have finished the entire thing but I was pleasantly full.I look forward to future trips to Gino's to check out their other menu offerings.  I would definitely go back on a Tuesday, as they have a selection of wines by the bottle for half-price.  Nothing fancy, bottles like Kendall Jackson and Santa Margherita, but still a good deal in this economy.",4.0
