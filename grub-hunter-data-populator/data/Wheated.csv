"Ok I was kinda on the edge between both Roberta's and Wheated. I love pizza and can eat it everyday for the rest of my life if possible (maybe a little exaggerated). So what did Wheated offer?Let me give you a hint, a bathroom exists. You'll be mind blown when you see it. This restaurant isn't large, but good for a small group of friends or dates. They have a bar in the front and an open kitchen in the back. My friends and I browsed the menu for drinks and saw how many delicious cocktails they have and also a decent wine list. They have a small list of beers and a unique list of housemate sodas. I had the Lionshead Pilsner ($5) and my friends had two sodas which I forgot what they were ($3; one was hibiscus and the other had lime). I like the lime one more because it was really refreshing and citrusy. The prices for drinks were not too shabby. Okay into the pizzas! Wowzerrrs, I learned so much about my borough in one sitting. Hahaha. It gets confusing after you look over the menu a bunch of times and it makes deciding really difficult. We opted for the Greenpoint and Bay Ridge (recommended by staff). We started with the octopus. They were seasoned with plenty paprika and has an awesome blend of flavor mixed with potatoes. The pizzas were made right next to our table, and each time I saw they bring a pie out of the oven, I was hoping it was ours. It took about 20 mins I would say. No problem though because the restaurant is full during dinner time (8pm). Finally when the pizza came out eyes were widened. So the verdict is that it's an awesome pizzeria with really good slices and ingredients. The Greenpoint tastes best when it's eaten hot! Since there's no sauce, the cheese hardens after a while. I thought it needed some salt though. The Bay Ridge had some bomb vodka sauce. And you know what's better? Topped with chili powder and their spicy honey!! Oh my... Never would've thought honey belonged on pizza but now I'm so mind blown by this creation. Lastly, we didn't really want dessert but like you see, the whole time I was eating and talking to my friend, the chocolate cake was like in my face. Literally. So we 3 shared a slice of almond cake with ganache and a brownie sundae. Wasn't interested in the sundae till she described this awesome peanut butter almond flavored ice cream. It all went good together and was balanced. The almond cake tasted familiar (chocolate room perhaps?) and we killed it instantly. That's how good it was. They've set the bar high for artisanal pizzas! **They don't accept Amex",5.0
"A quaint place near Prospect park in Brooklyn. Their menu had promising pizzas and so decided to check them out on a weekday for dinner. Pros :Easy to find parking in the area (+ 1 star)Non expensive and good whisky flight and cocktail menu (+ 1 star)Huge selection of vegetarian and white pizzas (+ 1 star)Contemporary and creatively named pizza list (+ 1 star)Awesome assortment of spice rack (thai chili powder, hot honey, sriracha ketchup)Cons -Pizzas not brick oven despite a great crust ( (- 1 star)Hidden washroom (cool !)Come on guys get a brick oven, and make the joint a true Brooklyn gem....",4.0
"Combine artisan pizza + cocktails = you got me hooked, babe. When I discovered Wheated, I couldn't have been more excited to try their pizzas and so we set out to order some (many) pies. Reading over the menu, I fell in love with the way they named them by Brooklyn areas. They really do suit the names. I am a fan of the Kensington and Bensonhurst pies. Perfect, tasty crust with the right ratio of sauce to cheese. Toppings are just as fabulous and they are lenient with allowing you to make switches to your pies. They are also a perfect location for meat lovers and vegetarians alike, giving both great options to work with. We also tried their delicious chocolate dessert. Absolute heaven in a bowl. A huge selection of whisky, cocktails and wines will greet you at the front bar like setting. Overall a magnificent experience with waiters being friendly, attentive and willing to help. My only reservation with giving 5 stars, they do not take reservations and they only open at 6PM. Parking in the neighborhood is a breeze.",4.0
"There are two trains of thought when it comes to New York pizza - either go super traditional or super experimental. My stomach has room for both trains.Wheated is definitely on the experimental side. They use sourdough for their crust, and that's just the beginning.Their pizzas are all named after neighborhoods in Brooklyn, and have potential to be one-of-a-kind experiences if you're adventurous enough with toppings. We split two appetizers and three pizzas between three people:The apps:1) Baked cauliflower with anchovy butter and fried garlic2) Octopus with baked lemon potatoes and paprikaThe octopus itself has a great char to it, but it was a little too lemony for me. Didn't realize the citrus would extend to the octopus. The baked cauliflower was excellent, especially with the anchovy butter that didn't overwhelm.The 'zas:1) Flatbush (red pie with oven roasted eggplant, mozz and pecorino)2) Gowanus (white pie with pickled broccoli rabe, ricotta, mozz and fennel sausage)3) Gravesend (red with mozz, pecorino, onions and basil)My favorite was the Flatbush. The eggplant wasn't slices, but more like cubes, so set expectations accordingly. The Gowanus was interesting, but if you're not into fennel, I'd avoid. And of course the Gravesend was a solid typical pie with a TON of onions on top. Great crust on everything. The sourdough really allows it to be airy and rise into big bubbles.And to put additional emphasis on ""experimental"", Wheated also has a great selection of optional condiments. There's homemade Sriracha, Thai chili powder, and spicy honey. Honestly, you can't go wrong with any (or all) of them. Doesn't really matter what slice you've got.Lastly, I would be remiss if I didn't mention their killer whiskey selection. I'm told the owner is obsessed with whiskey (who can blame him?) so he's stocked the bar with all of the best. The menu itself was double sided and in small print. They have Japanese whiskey, private barrel stuff, and basically everything you could ever want. It's heaven on earth.The place gets busy in a Friday night, but the bar is cozy and where all the whiskey is!",5.0
"After coming back two times, the pizza has definitely gotten soggier. Depending on which pie you get, it might be impossible to eat a slice without a knife and fork.The meatball appetizer was ok. I feel like there was a bit too much filler and it was taking away from the actual meat. The mixed green salad was a big portion but not particularly great.The service is overall friendly but a bit awkward at times.",3.0
"Come for the pizza, stay for the spicy honey.Stopped in because we were in the neighborhood and wanted some dinner. Saw they had good reviews, and the more times I can make dinner = pizza, the happier I will be. The man and I had nibbled on some snacks earlier in the day so we split a pie, and it was the perfect size. If you're ravenous, half a pie is not enough but a full pie is too much, so dilemma. Thankfully, we were not in that situation and agreed on the Gravesend pizza with vegetarian sausage. Holy smokes, so good. The hot honey (and spicy thai chili) with the roasted onions? Bellissima.I know it's a cocktail bar but if I'm eating pizza, I want a beer. They've got about a half-dozen beers on tap, all great, so that was fine with me. I would potentially go out of my way to come back here just for pizza again, which is saying a lot, considering we live in the city with the most pizza places per square mile in the entire world*, but it was that good.*This is not a verified fact.",4.0
"After seeing yelp reviews went and was greatly disappointed.   Pizza was OK, our party of 4 ordered the brussel salad, grilled octopus, 3 pies, and later a warm Brownie Sunday and ice cream.  Salad was different but lacking.  Octopus meh.  As for the pizzas (3 different ones don't remember names), first one was soggy and burnt, other 2 were ok but no crispy crust.  Brownie Sunday was ok, tho we did get a small size of a peanut butter and sesame ice cream that we all agreed was the best part of the meal.  They have happy hour from 9pm and we were seated at 8:45.  They claimed our first round didn't qualify,  but second did.  Not worth the trip.",2.0

"If I lived in the neighborhood, I'd be here quite a bit.  Casual and friendly service, warm space, excellent salad, reasonable wine list and pretty good pie.  The pizzas veer toward Paulie Gee's territory, though maybe not as delicious.  A lot of topping choices and you should choose wisely, perhaps staying away from the most experimental.  We had one pie with pickled broccoli rabe that didn't succeed, but points for effort!  Both the Caesar salad and mixed green salads we had were so good and huge.  I appreciate when a pizza establishment offers good salad/vegetables, I need a bit of variety with my crusts.",4.0

"Gluten has gotten quite a bad rap in this day and age, at what may be the apex of ingredient scrutiny and hysteria, so I appreciate the bold gesture involved in naming a business located in this particular enclave of BoBo Brooklyn after a much-maligned but Great Grain. Since's the name's the grain, I'll start by reviewing the sourdough base of the gourmet pizza served at this spare neighborhood gem. While others have compared all elements of Wheated's 'za to Paulie Gee's, I would argue that the sourdough gives Wheated's equally fresh crust an extra kick:""It seems like we are always looking for something more flavorful in pizza crusts and breadsticks. One answer to this search is sourdough. Sourdough has been in use much longer than yeast as we know it today. We know that some type of sourdough was used by ancient Egyptians to produce a type of flat bread more than 3,000 years ago, when sours were the only known means to leaven breads before yeast was propagated. When we think of a sourdough, we normally think of the flavor of a San Francisco sourdough bread, but the truth is, all sourdoughs do not produce a sour or tangy flavor. Some sourdoughs are more bland; in fact, the Italian bread, pannetone, has been made from a type of sourdough."" --Lehman, Pizza Today pizzatoday.com/departmen…The ingredients that top this unique crust are fresh, as products of both the market and of the mind. Some, such as the Sunset Park, topped with a subtle tomato sauce, hot sopressata, fresh and aged mozzarella, Parmigiano-Reggiano and the accompaniment of Mike's Hot Honey™, bear resemblance to and find their equivalent in certain of Paulie Gee's pies (in this case Gee's Dellboy/Hellboy). Others, however, especially the Vinegar Hill, a sauceless white pie with fresh and aged mozzarella, pungent gorgonzola, white potato, thyme, and the unique topping of grape must syrup are ingenious. This particular pizza was both a revelation and a game-changer. The cocktails here are on par with some of the best in more popular Brooklyn neighborhoods as well as Manhattan, but at more affordable price points, especially with the late-running happy hour, and the bar is proving  to be a destination in itself. Also not to be overlooked are the homemade sodas, particularly the white cola and fresh ginger and lime soda. Service is very friendly and personalized, and the space is sleek. I hope that Wheated becomes part of a revival of this stretch of Church Avenue.",4.0
"I have been coming here since they opened and the food, cocktails and service have always been stellar. This review is about the heart of this place. I came in with my 9 yr old son who has autism.  I ordered an appetizer (risotto and date stuffed eggplant), a cocktail and a pizza pie. We were unable to eat the food because my son had sensory overload as a result of having a long day at school and had a meltdown, which caused us to leave the restaurant to calm him down. The staff immediately packed the food to go and the owner insisted that I can pay for the meal some other night. When I came back to pay two days later, he refused to take money, no matter how much I insisted. I am truly touched by the kindness, compassion and understanding that was shown by the owner and staff. Not only is the restaurant amazing, food-wise, but the people behind it are absolutely remarkable. Thank you!!",5.0

I like that there are different pizzas named after parts of Brooklyn, and that there are plenty of vegan options...but for the price, I am left wondering if it's worth it. After I finish an entire pie by myself, I am still hungry. I think that's because some pies don't have sauce, and with the moderate amount of toppings and the extremely thin crust, it amounts to nothing in your stomach. Everything else is excellent, including their customer service.",4.0

"I really liked Wheated. Christine is super nice and a great bartender. She crafted some delicious cocktails for us at the bar with a smile. Salads were fresh and crisp, I was worried that the brussel sprouts might have come out a bit sweet b/c of the cranberries but they were really well offset by the cheese and lemon dressing. I personally would like a bit more lemon but was a good balance.Can't recall the name but we liked the pizza, crust was perfection, just felt like we didn't order well on the toppings (our bad, not wheated). Can't really go wrong when they have that thai chili and hot honey to make everything super yummy. Finally, we added on a ceasar salad, i liked, wife felt the dressy had too much anchovy. Either way, it was perfectly seasoned which i found to be impressive.For a local place we found with the help of fellow yelpers, we're big fans and will surely be back. thanks Wheated!",4.0
"What a great spot.Look, everyone goes on and on about Paulie Gees in Greenpoint like their pies are cooked over coals made from pieces of the one true cross and slices by the lance of Longinus.  I get it.  They are good.  But they are hardly special, and that certainly aren't unique.  Presenting Wheated.Their pies taste great.  Have good variety.  You can get something simple, you can get something fancy, but no matter what you get, it will taste fresh.  Honestly my only complaint is how small the place is.  Table turnover is slow, and there was some confusion about whether we could or couldn't get food at the bar.  If food service at the bar is an option then that should be made clear and bar seating should be treated with the same level of care as the waiting list for table seating.  All said, what a great spot.",4.0

We finished our delicious meal with a slice of chocolate cake that was bigger than my head, and for seven bucks? In what alternate universe do they still serve quality...?!?! Yum and thank you.Don't feel guilty that you are tempted to steal the Mike's hot honey off of the table, but know that it is available for sale at some stores in the neighborhood and also online... Don't be greedy... Slowly pull it out of your purse, and put it back on the table.",5.0
Two of our favs...Whisky and Pizza. This whisky catalog is amazing. The staff is knowledgable and enthusiastic about their juice. But wait....the pizza is the best in the neighborhood and gives the rest of Brooklyn pizza places a run for their money. Hunker down! Eat! Drink! ....and get fat and drunk.,5.0
"My boyfriend and I have been here at least 3 times and Wheated always has us coming back for more! Nothing but delightful experiences. Church Avenue is becoming quite an awesome area to have dinner.The pizza at Wheated is EXCELLENT. It's not too heavy and the toppings are delicious - I've had everything from anchovies to gorgonzola to eggplant. My favorite seat is right next to the fresh cake. ;) I usually glance at the cake a few times throughout my meal. It gets packed on a Friday night so come early! It's a cozy little place. Great for a date or for families. Oh, and they have a cool bar. I always get a drink with my pizza. No doubt we will be back here again.",5.0
"Con: not enough staff than needed during dinner rush... I wish we had more attention and that they had 3 more people like the boss, he's great!Pros: pizzas are about 7 slices each and as big as my face :D SPLURGE ON THE GOWANUS PIE. The chocolate cake is moist and the almond cake is fun, but they have ZEN BUTTER ICE CREAM y'all!Best part was when I thought I had a contact in my beer and convulsed. Boss and staff were immediately responsive, made our dessert complimentary. And even when there were some mix ups in our order, staff was reasonable and we felt well taken care of. TL;DRCome at 9 pm, order the Gowanus pizza and drown it in spicy honey + the boss is a cool guy. My new payday dinner spot ^_^",4.0
"I really liked Wheated. Christine is super nice and a great bartender. She crafted some delicious cocktails for us at the bar with a smile. Salads were fresh and crisp, I was worried that the brussel sprouts might have come out a bit sweet b/c of the cranberries but they were really well offset by the cheese and lemon dressing. I personally would like a bit more lemon but was a good balance.Can't recall the name but we liked the pizza, crust was perfection, just felt like we didn't order well on the toppings (our bad, not wheated). Can't really go wrong when they have that thai chili and hot honey to make everything super yummy. Finally, we added on a ceasar salad, i liked, wife felt the dressy had too much anchovy. Either way, it was perfectly seasoned which i found to be impressive.For a local place we found with the help of fellow yelpers, we're big fans and will surely be back. thanks Wheated!",4.0
"What a great spot.Look, everyone goes on and on about Paulie Gees in Greenpoint like their pies are cooked over coals made from pieces of the one true cross and slices by the lance of Longinus.  I get it.  They are good.  But they are hardly special, and that certainly aren't unique.  Presenting Wheated.Their pies taste great.  Have good variety.  You can get something simple, you can get something fancy, but no matter what you get, it will taste fresh.  Honestly my only complaint is how small the place is.  Table turnover is slow, and there was some confusion about whether we could or couldn't get food at the bar.  If food service at the bar is an option then that should be made clear and bar seating should be treated with the same level of care as the waiting list for table seating.  All said, what a great spot.",4.0
This pizza was ridiculous. Get the Vinegar Hill pie and Eggplant Risotto app. It will blow your mind.,5.0
"This place is a little dangerous for me since it is so close to my home. Wheated plays double duty, first as a great creative Neapolitan pizza restaurant, and secondly as great cocktail bar and watering hole. This place satisfies my hipster urges without being overbearingly hipster. Never too crowded except on a Friday or Saturday night, and very reasonable priced (~$10 cocktails and ~$15 pies).The pies are very good, surprisingly good considering that they come out of an electric oven. They don't reach the superlative heights that a wood-fired oven establishment like Sottocasa can offer. However, Wheated's pies are good enough that I feel like I'm splitting hairs. Despite the menu length, many of the pizzas feature only subtle variations -  a bit of a missed opportunity, I think.The atmosphere is casual and friendly, and there are quite a few regulars at the bar, where you can also order food. Their cocktail menu features some twists on the classics and is very reliable. They have a great Bourbon selection. I usually go in with the intention of just having one drink with my meal, but I often end up geeking out about cocktails with the amiable and knowledgeable bar staff resulting in a few additional rounds. The beer selection is limited but passable. As a boorish beer snob, they usually have at least one thing on tap that I enjoy.They don't deliver, but you can call in for pickup. Just don't let that pizza get cold or you'll be missing out!",4.0

"This is a great spot for some food and drinks with friends. It's usually crowded in the front with people hovering over each other with drinks in hand, but there are a few tables in the back to enjoy your grub. The pizza is terrific. The crust is just right, not too thick or too thin. The portion may be perfect for those who aren't looking to eat a large pie, but for the price of a pie here, it's on the smaller end if you're sharing (more like personal pan size). I ordered the Bensonhurst and I have to say it's good, however, for my palate, it's a generic taste. I've had this exact taste elsewhere. I tried honey, sriracha and the chili powder on my pizza and wow, it's another level of flavor. Who would've thought honey or sriracha on pizza would taste amazing. I would definitely return to try another option that isn't very generic tasting. One negative I really did not appreciate is the strong alcohol odor in the restaurant. As soon as you walk in, you are overwhelmed with the alcohol smell, and it leads into the back seating area as well. Overall, bit pricey for the size, establishment is small with little wiggle room, strong odor for those sensitive to alcohol, but really good pizza in the area.",4.0

The Bay Ridge pizza with vodka sauce was the special that night. Also ordered the Vinegar Hill. Both pizzas were good, thin & crispy just like I like it. Didn't mind the lack of sauce that much.

A great mixture of toppings, cheese, and sauce complementing each other so well. I am also a fan of Mike's Spicy Honey Sauce. It goes hand-in-hand with the pizza.

"I wish there's a pizza place like this in my neighborhood.  Most pizza places you go to, you are either ordering a slice from what's available and premade behind the counter, or you are choosing your own generic toppings to put on a pie.  At Wheated, the pizza is made to order, and they've came up with some creative combinations with quality ingredients like bacon, hot sopressata, chorizo, as well as arugula, mushroom, and sweet fig.  There were about 15 choices on the menu (all named after various neighborhoods), and I wanted to try every one of them.Every pizza we ordered were delicious - the favorite of the group was the bacon pizza (the Brighton Beach).  The dough was thin and slightly crunchy and there was a nice balance of crust to the toppings.  The pizza wasn't too heavy or salty like the usual places.  Even our 3 year-old who doesn't usually like pizza had 4 slices.  The waitstaff and the bartender are knowledgeable and friendly, the food and drinks are promptly served.For adults, Wheated has a great selection of beer on tap (they had Abita pecan harvest ale) and cocktails.  They have your usual favorites and also specialty drinks with unique ingredients - try the Cuba Libre with homemade white coca-cola syrup.  After a day in the neighborhood or at the park, this is a solid option for dinner.  Have some freshly made gourmet pizza with the family or hang out at the intimate bar with a date and some friends.  The menu changes often so stop by soon and try the Brighton Beach.  Enjoy!  p.s. be careful with the pepper flakes - trust me, don't cover your pizza with it like you do at the other pizza places, this stuff is seriously spicy.",4.0

"I wish there's a pizza place like this in my neighborhood.  Most pizza places you go to, you are either ordering a slice from what's available and premade behind the counter, or you are choosing your own generic toppings to put on a pie.  At Wheated, the pizza is made to order, and they've came up with some creative combinations with quality ingredients like bacon, hot sopressata, chorizo, as well as arugula, mushroom, and sweet fig.  There were about 15 choices on the menu (all named after various neighborhoods), and I wanted to try every one of them.Every pizza we ordered were delicious - the favorite of the group was the bacon pizza (the Brighton Beach).  The dough was thin and slightly crunchy and there was a nice balance of crust to the toppings.  The pizza wasn't too heavy or salty like the usual places.  Even our 3 year-old who doesn't usually like pizza had 4 slices.  The waitstaff and the bartender are knowledgeable and friendly, the food and drinks are promptly served.For adults, Wheated has a great selection of beer on tap (they had Abita pecan harvest ale) and cocktails.  They have your usual favorites and also specialty drinks with unique ingredients - try the Cuba Libre with homemade white coca-cola syrup.  After a day in the neighborhood or at the park, this is a solid option for dinner.  Have some freshly made gourmet pizza with the family or hang out at the intimate bar with a date and some friends.  The menu changes often so stop by soon and try the Brighton Beach.  Enjoy!  p.s. be careful with the pepper flakes - trust me, don't cover your pizza with it like you do at the other pizza places, this stuff is seriously spicy.",4.0

"Ok...so I usually give places two tries before yelping but I can't wait! I've passed by here so many times and by accident stopped in the other night!Although the menu is on the window it was hard to see from the condensation from all of the people...which was a good enough sign to come in. We were quickly seated by our friendly server, Jonathan. (hi!) Who told us of the specials. Like everyone said, they have pizzas named after the different neighborhoods in Brooklyn. Mmmmm. I chose the Gravesend, a white pie with onions. I love onions on a pizza!!! When the pies came they didn't offer the usual red pepper flakes. Instead we were offered chili powder, hand ground by the owner David's mother in law. What? It was spicy but that heat brought the flavor of the white cheese out. It was so good. Oh wait, we also had the ceasar salad. It was yummy. I must say the croutons were the best I've had. David, the owner told us that they are made from leftover dough from the day before. Well, talk about resourceful! It was so buttery and nice!Hot toddies were in full effect and they were delicious. They were prepared with brandy and the mixture was right on.

"I've had Grimaldi's, Paulie Gees, Di Fara, and so on and this place definitely falls into top three. That's just after trying two of their sourdough pizzas creatively named after Brooklyn neighborhoods.I say this with great pride in the fact that its a local neighborhood gem. Wheated is discretely placed in the corner of Coney Island and Church with a plain white sign and only the bar is visible from the outside. I had no idea this place sold pizza until a friend told me!We had the Vinigar Hill and the Borough Park. At first sight, it's literally a Naan Roti with vegetables on top, like a Indian Pizza! (Why coundn't I think of that lol) But this taste amazing. It's definitely in a higher echelon. They give you thai chili powder and honey drizzle as condiments  which was delightfully different and spicy! I cannot say enough good things about this place. Overall, the ingredients are fresh, the pizza is appetizing, the service is appreciable, and it's so close to home! My only pet peeve with this place is that they don't deliver. Please start delivery! But do not turn into Grimaldi's, please stay a hidden gem, I don't want to wait 1 hour for a pizza, heck, I just might for The Borough Park...",5.0
"I'll definitely be back to Wheated for drinks. Interesting concoctions from all over the world!If it isn't obvious from other reviews: this is fancy pizza, not 2 Bros.-type stuff.

At Wheated you'll get a giant personal pie with very thin crust. ~Half the pies have no sauce at all so I ordered mine with sauce -- next time I'll have to order double sauce. But it's very obvious all the ingredients are good quality and a lot of thought was put into the menu.Mostly, I'm ecstatic that higher-end places like this are popping up in the area left and right.

"I'm just blown away at how amazing Wheated is! Just an overall amazing experience! My girlfriend and I walked in to Wheated on a rainy Sunday night, after having agreed that we'd try this new pizza place in the neighborhood that had gotten such rave reviews on Yelp. We entered the restaurant in a really cool cocktail bar section, then led back to a cozy area in the back with tables filled with all sorts of tasty and unique looking pizzas. Already I'm eyeing everyone's pizza to see which one I'll end up ordering.We're greeted by our waiter, Dave, who actually ended up being the owner of the place and just the nicest guy. We decided to share the Vinegar Hill and The Brooklyn Heights with tomato sauce added sausage, and I got a whiskey cocktail. The cocktail was very refreshing! Our pizzas were then brought out and we were so excited to dig in. We each take our first bite and we're both reacting the same: eyes lit up with amazement and surprise at how incredible this pizza is! The Vinegar Hill might be the most unique pizza I've ever had. The Gorgonzola, white potato, mozzarella, and grape must syrup were each individually subtle, but when combined together created one mind blowing experience of a pizza. The Brooklyn Heights is your classic margarita pizza but we added sweet fennel sausage and tomato sauce - the sausage was super tasty and the mozzarella, tomato sauce, and basil all tasted extremely fresh! The sourdough crust was also really great! The perfect amount of doughy and crispness. We're definitely coming back and we can't wait to try all the other pizzas on the menu! This place is definitely worth the trek out to if you live outside Brooklyn. Wheated is a hidden gem with the best pizza I've ever had - better than Di'Faras, Lucali, Grimaldis, and Roberta's.",5.0
"Overall, this is arguably in the top echelon of pizzas in Brooklyn, and the bar makes it even better.  The value and ambiance is heads and shoulders above the competition, like the over-priced and irritatingly popular Franny's in Prospect Heights.We went here to try it out on a Wednesday night at 8pm with a small group of friends and we were seated immediately.  The bar in front is beautiful, and I could see how this would be a great spot to have a drink and then a pizza when you get hungry.We ordered the salad special, arugula with shaved fennel, parmesan and oranges, and three pizzas.  The ""Ditmas Park"" was an outstanding pizza for not even having any cheese--it is quite garlicy and showcases the somewhat miraculous crust, which is a uniquely delicious crispy and thin sourdough.  The ""Sunset Park"" was also very good with a spicy soppressata, as was the ""East Williamsburg"" with mushrooms.  The naming of the pizzas as Brooklyn neighborhoods is very clever and makes choosing fun.  All pizzas are $10-$15.The list of specialty cocktails ensures something for everyone, and they are made to pack a punch.  The beer list is also very good, and offers a $4 draft (that night it was a Lionshead Pilsner).Service was good and very friendly (pizza makers came out of the kitchen to ask how the pizza was), although plates were not cleared efficiently.The decor is just slightly off (although the wood details and the bar are beautiful)--the dining room tables are oddly arranged and slightly askew, making the space feel like a coffee shop after a day of people moving chairs and tables to accommodate their work.Outstanding!  We will certainly make this a regular place on our list!",5.0
"I love this place.  I've been there dozens of times and I love the food.  We went last night (Sunday) to grab a pie.  I checked their website to make sure that they were still open since it was already in the evening.  They close at 11pm and we get there at 10:15pm.  We are told that we can not be served because the kitchen was closed.  Really at 10:15pm?  But, they're still open.  Bad business if you can't make one more pie at 10:15.  We probably would have been done and gone by 11pm.  The waiter was apologetic and all, but I told him that the website should be updated to reflect the closing of the kitchen to avoid any future confusion. That whole encounter left a sour taste in my mouth.  I'm giving them 2 stars because I have experienced better from them.",2.0
"My vegan BFF and I visited Wheated on a Saturday night. It's in her neighborhood and she was excited about a vegan pizza option. (Don't worry - only one of their many pizzas can be veganized! Cheeseheads, calm down!)The host was awesome; we were seated and waited on quickly. As mentioned, my BFF ordered whatever the first pizza on the menu is, sans cheese. I opted for the Bensonhurst. What amused me about their menu was, for the 15-20 pizzas offered, there were only subtle differences between them. For instance, truffle oil; add pancetta; cherry tomato vs. tomato sauce.Although it took a long while to get our pizzas - this might be in part due to the brisk carryout business they seem to be doing - it was worth the wait. The Bensonhurst had a delicious combination of regular (aged?) and fresh mozzarella. Nom. I washed it down with a beer from Blue Point, one of my favorite local breweries. Sadly, I could only finish half my pizza, but I had a delicious dinner at home two days later.All that, and reasonably priced.

"Yum! Wheated is a welcome addition to the neighborhood. Dairy is not my friend, but I make an exception for their pizza.My friend Caitlin can't get enough of their Sunset Park. She loves the spicy honey they provide so you can drizzle it on the pizza. I love the East Williamsburg because I can't get enough of mushrooms and truffle salt. Mmm, truffle salt. It's okay to share a pizza. We got one each, and had leftovers. We were stuffed by the second slice. Personally, I believe a good indicator of a pizza's quality is how good it tastes cold/the day after ... Wheated passed the test!Summer: try the watermelon salad. It's inexpensive and refreshing!The staff is very friendly, and they don't mind helping you select a fantastic cocktail to go with your pizza.Last but not least, I love the decor.

"Absolutely the best pizza currently going in New York. These guys are head and shoulders above DiFara, Lucali, etc. Perfect char, tasty but not overwhelming sauce, mild cheese, wonderfully bright and fresh ingredients. The space is small and crowded, but none of it matters. The pizza is so good that it is worth the wait, it is worth the crowding, and it is worth the single bathroom.

You know, this guy really cares about each pie he makes. He runs out, deal with it, come back another night. Have a drink and chill. To give a two star review for running out of dough not long before closing for the evening is BS. You can never determine EXACTLY how much you need each night, it happens. I would say the primarily awesome  reviews speak for themselves. Rock on Wheated, you're one of the best!",5.0

"Great pizzas,terrific staff, and a cool welcoming atmosphere - this is what Brooklyn is about. Or at least, I declare this is what Brooklyn is about. The Borough Park pizza is very yummy, and if you don't already know the value of pineapple on pizza, then this pizza is a good way to find out. What truly matters at any pizza spot is the crust, and Wheated nails it with a thin crispy crust that is just doughy enough to give you something to chew, savor, and absorb the flavors of each pizza. Really glad I stopped in tonight. My pizzas were great, and there were so many awesome pizzas happening at tables nearby, I can't wait to go back and work my way through the menu.",4.0
"Excellent vegan pizza options (Ditmas Park and Park Slope pizzas can be veganized - our fave is def the latter). Add crimini mushrooms and vegan sausage for a real treat.

"Very smart design that i like a lot. the photo of the chandelier made of electrical conduit and boxes doesn't do the creativity also in the similar sconces justice. Use of interior doors as elements in the bar and the stenciled wood wall with the inset, well-balanced bathroom door & angle-iron handle are very cool. I'm loving it . . . and then:I want to love them, but opening night wasn't great. The beers were fine, but the Bensonhurst w/mushrooms was undercooked and doughy though it was thin enough. The house made syrups for sodas were creative and tasty. What concerned me most is that the pie that came out 2-3 ahead of mine was obviously burned, the couple at the table next to us were brought an unsliced pizza and had to work hard to find someone to take it back for slicing--one member of the table took it back himself.

"Yum! Wheated is a welcome addition to the neighborhood. Dairy is not my friend, but I make an exception for their pizza.My friend Caitlin can't get enough of their Sunset Park. She loves the spicy honey they provide so you can drizzle it on the pizza. I love the East Williamsburg because I can't get enough of mushrooms and truffle salt. Mmm, truffle salt. It's okay to share a pizza. We got one each, and had leftovers. We were stuffed by the second slice. Personally, I believe a good indicator of a pizza's quality is how good it tastes cold/the day after ... Wheated passed the test!Summer: try the watermelon salad. It's inexpensive and refreshing!The staff is very friendly, and they don't mind helping you select a fantastic cocktail to go with your pizza.Last but not least, I love the decor. The overall aesthetic of the restaurant is highly appealing; simple, warm, romantic and chill.",4.0
"Went back in, greeted with a smile and had a great time. I appreciated the owner reaching out, it shows he really cares and  the staff made us a salad even after they had started clean up to close. We will find a way to rally the troops back sometime.",5.0
"Absolutely the best pizza currently going in New York. These guys are head and shoulders above DiFara, Lucali, etc. Perfect char, tasty but not overwhelming sauce, mild cheese, wonderfully bright and fresh ingredients. The space is small and crowded, but none of it matters. The pizza is so good that it is worth the wait, it is worth the crowding, and it is worth the single bathroom. There's a large selection of bourbon and some interesting cocktails, but, to be sure, the real star here is the pizza.",5.0
"Wheated does it right all the time! Excellent food, drinks and service. Everyone I introduce to this place loves it. Per the review about the lack of pizza at 1015. You know, this guy really cares about each pie he makes. He runs out, deal with it, come back another night. Have a drink and chill. To give a two star review for running out of dough not long before closing for the evening is BS. You can never determine EXACTLY how much you need each night, it happens. I would say the primarily awesome  reviews speak for themselves. Rock on Wheated, you're one of the best!",5.0

"Great pizzas,terrific staff, and a cool welcoming atmosphere - this is what Brooklyn is about. Or at least, I declare this is what Brooklyn is about. The Borough Park pizza is very yummy, and if you don't already know the value of pineapple on pizza, then this pizza is a good way to find out. What truly matters at any pizza spot is the crust, and Wheated nails it with a thin crispy crust that is just doughy enough to give you something to chew, savor, and absorb the flavors of each pizza. Really glad I stopped in tonight. My pizzas were great, and there were so many awesome pizzas happening at tables nearby, I can't wait to go back and work my way through the menu.",4.0
"Excellent vegan pizza options (Ditmas Park and Park Slope pizzas can be veganized - our fave is def the latter). Add crimini mushrooms and vegan sausage for a real treat. Pizza dough is so delicious (coming from someone who cares little for pizza crust). Service has been consistently  friendly. Great bar, always excellent music playlist.",5.0
"Very smart design that i like a lot. the photo of the chandelier made of electrical conduit and boxes doesn't do the creativity also in the similar sconces justice. Use of interior doors as elements in the bar and the stenciled wood wall with the inset, well-balanced bathroom door & angle-iron handle are very cool. I'm loving it . . . and then:I want to love them, but opening night wasn't great. The beers were fine, but the Bensonhurst w/mushrooms was undercooked and doughy though it was thin enough. The house made syrups for sodas were creative and tasty. What concerned me most is that the pie that came out 2-3 ahead of mine was obviously burned, the couple at the table next to us were brought an unsliced pizza and had to work hard to find someone to take it back for slicing--one member of the table took it back himself. Probably startup issues, but since my wife eats pizza once a decade it'll be just me the next time, whenever that is.",3.0

"Really excellent Neapolitan pizza. I had a white pizza and was very satisfied. The pizzas are very big and could be split with a salad, which also looked huge. Only complaint is slow service, but it's because their wait service is far understaffed - they're all working very hard.",4.0
"When we stopped by earlier this week, we were the first to come in, but the place got busy very quickly. In addition to people dining in, there were a lot of pick-ups and the handling of these orders seemed to be the priority for the place, unfortunately.We had to wait for about 4o minutes for our food, while a number of walk-in people got to pick up theirs. The trend continued throughout the night: diners were kept waiting forever (lots of well behaved kids -- I'm impressed with their patience), while boxes of pizzas were made ready for pick-ups. That just didn't make much sense and made us feel like we're the afterthought. Perhaps it's possible to rethink the process of filling orders to take care of in-house customers first?Then, there was only one waitress who was working the full room and handing the pickups. She was working hard and was very busy, but as a result the service was non-attentive. This arrangement is not fair to the hardworking staff -- overextended, their tips will reflect the guests' feeling of being forgotten (we waited for over 10 minutes for a slice of a cake).As for the food: the greens salad and chocolate cake were generously portioned and delicious, but the pizzas were unremarkable. My East Williamsburg was bland, skimpy on the mushrooms, and I couldn't taste the truffle oil at all. The Sunset Park was overly burnt, otherwise ok, but nothing to get excited about. I'm was underwhelmed after hearing others' enthusiasm -- and I'm not a picky eater.",3.0
"I really love Wheated. It's the closest place to my house that serves a great cocktail, has a late starting happy hour, and really good pizza. So why the poor review? I brought two of my friends here for the first time last night. The restaurant was surprisingly empty. In the past, Friday and Saturday nights usually have a long line of people waiting for a table but last night, we were seated quickly at 7:30. But then we waited over an hour to be served our pizza choices (we got the Brussels sprout salad rather quickly) while we watched 20-30 pizzas march out the door for pickups. One of my friends started itching to leave after 40 minutes but didn't want to make me look bad as I'm a regular. And there was four other tables seated after us in the same predicament. There is something fundamentally wrong with this formula where they don't deliver and hold their pickups in higher esteem to the seated customers in the restaurant. I will be back for an after 9 pm weekday visit but I expect they will never be considered again for a prime time weekend choice.",1.0

"Full disclosure: I am a friend of the owners and backed them on Kickstarter after Jerk Storm Sandy destroyed their oven shortly before their planned opening. I've been waiting for this place to open since I first met David and Kim and decided to wait a month or two before my first official visit. That visit happened yesterday and I was absolutely thrilled at what they put together! First of all, the place is beautiful. It's a welcome addition to the neighborhood, which already boasts some of my favorite restaurants in Brooklyn. The pizza is delicious. They make their dough by hand and use 100% natural fermentation, so no store bought yeast. The crust has a great texture -- somewhere between snappy and tender -- and a depth of flavor that far surpasses corner slice shops. We had six different pizzas (shared between seven of us) and it was a perfect order. I thought the pies with sauce were more tender than those without, so I'd go with something saucy. I regret not getting the pie with pistachio and mortadella, but I'll just have it next time. Beyond the pizza, this is a really cool place for a drink. They do a hand-mixed white cola that tastes not of chemicals and caramel syrup, but of citrus and herbs. It's really unique and super tasty. They're also really into bourbon, so check out the cocktail list. I'll definitely be back for more!",5.0
"If Wheated was ANYWHERE else in the country, it would get more stars for being decent pizza. However, for being in New York it's somewhat forgettable and definitely overpriced. The ambiance of the place is really nice, but the actual pizza wasn't that special. I came with 2 friends and we ordered the Kensington (with garlic) and the Bensonhurst (with onions.) Both tasted fine, but the onions on the Kensington were a weird texture; they weren't caramelized, but they weren't crisp still-- it was a little hard to eat given the texture and size of the pieces. I also couldn't taste the fresh mozzarella, but the flavor was overall good. The Besonhurst was the same with the cheese situation; the fresh mozzarella was indiscernible, and there was a strong garlic flavor but we were all expecting chunks or cloves (which wasn't the case.) Again, it tasted pretty good but wasn't very special (or worth the price for the size.) To be honest, the most memorable part of the pizza was the crust (which I definitely appreciate- having moved to TX three years ago, I can truly say that finding good pizza dough/crust isn't always easy!)Overall, I definitely didn't' leave disappointed, but I also don't think I'll be back.

The bartender (who I realized a short time after was the owner, in which also made my pizza)  made me something similar in flavor. The vegan pizza was awesome! The CRUST! OMG! I worked at a pizza shop for over 5 years and have hated crusts cause they get chewy, but Wheated had it going. I ate the ENTIRE pizza by myself.

They brought us chili powder and spicy honey which was really tasty. Overall, the place was cozy, relaxing and friendly. The food and drinks were great and it was all under $50 including a tip.",5.0
"I'm pleasantly surprised by this place. We came twice, not long after they opened. I know it's not easy getting things right with a wood-fired oven*, but they were putting out excellent pizzas and doing it consistently the first week.The crust has a pronounced sourdough tang. All ours were well charred without being overdone. They didn't quite meeet the Neapolitan ideal of lightness and tenderness. But maybe this isn't Wheated's goal. I'm personally ok with some crunch and chewiness. Purists of the style might find fault.The toppings we had were excellent. Not the best I've had in the city, but nothing at all to compalin about. Comparing to Robertas, my current benchmark, Wheated is as good in crust flavor, but is a couple of notches behind in crust texture and in topping quality (not everyone makes their own charcuterie and gets Alice Waters to help design the herb garden. And it took Robertas nearly three years to get their pizzas to the current level. A little perspective is in order).The beer list is excellent. The cocktail bar and staff look serious, and merit further investigation. Service is enthusiastic, if disorganized. I trust they'll work out the kinks.The decor is a bit bland. And the location is a funny juncture of nice old houses and auto parts stores and car washes. Sidewalk café tables are probably not in their future. The big caveat: don't come early. If you show up before 8, you might think you walked into Chuck-E-Cheez. I've never seen (or heard) so many todlers in one place in NYC. I don't know where they came from, and hope to never find out. We endured it the night we came at 7, but saw another couple leave with hands over ears.These negatives are minor. Wheated has done a great job with this place, and has given the neighborhood a much-welcome gift.*I believe their oven uses both wood and gas, but I'd still expect a learning curve.Edited to add: If they ever decide to do delivery, I'll upgrade to 6 stars.",4.0
"Welcome to the nabe David!! Top notch. The fit out is terrific, reclaimed wood and what not dominating, and a great looking bar. A delicious cocktail list, bourbon leaning but as balanced as it gets. Eager and friendly staff tending the floor and incredible pizza. The watermelon salad was perfect, cool, crisp melon and cucumber with a nice salty spike from the ricotta salata. Pies we ordered were the Fort Greene with sweet figs and salty gorgonzola, perfectly balanced. The Sunset Park was also killer, as were the cocktails. Great drinks, very nicely balanced cocktails. We had classics, Manhattan's and an Old Fashioned. Proper Old Fashioned, no muddled fruit or soda anywhere. Not sweet at all and garnished with an orange zest. Perfect.As for anyone that feels the need to comment on toddlers/kids, I'll say this. I have a toddler he's 18 months old. I work in a well known Manhattan restaurant. He, and most toddlers, behave better and make far less noise than a lot of patrons I've seen in the city. As for not knowing where said toddlers come from, welcome to the neighborhood Paul. You're clearly not from around here. To everyone else, enjoy. Come along anytime, you won't be sorry.The noise level, even with a few kids is no more than what you'd get in the city on any given evening. If you can deal with that, you'll love it!! If you can't, get your crochet rug out and warm up a cup of cocoa and stay in.",5.0
"This place makes me HAPPY.1. Someone from the bar always greets us when we walk in. It's always in a very friendly, glad you're here sort of way. Nothing really beats a nice greeting.2. They have pizza with mortadella. I don't know what happened in my childhood growing up in Italy that my favorite cold cut never made an appearance on my pizzas, but planets aligned in Brooklyn and I'm a very happy camper now.3. The Red Hook pizza is really quite good. Mortadella, mozzarella, thyme, potato, crushed pistachios. Oh yes.4. The Vinegar Hill is different and wonderful: mozzarella, gorgonzola, white potato, thyme, grape must syrup5. They made a great Manhattan. And the Penicillin (drink special) was amaze.6. Service was very friendly. Had to move tables because they had sat us where the pizza ticket machine was spitting out receipts loudly next to my ear. That's about it.Love that this place is in the neighborhood!",4.0
"Every time I have a bad meal somewhere else, I think about how I should have saved my money for another visit to Wheated. This place has consistently delivered a fantastic dining experience every time I've visited. In fact, I'm going to go so far as to say that Wheated is my favorite restaurant. The pizzas are all delicious, the drink specials are always good, and the service is killer. I'm thrilled this place exists. The only downside is the long wait for a table on weekends. I guess I'm not the only fan.",5.0
Went here last night had some drinks and a pie. Pie was on point had the Moscow drink as well tasty. Only think I didn't like was sitting at the bar a man was smokin outside the smell would come in everytime someone would open the door. Other then that great place.,4.0
Amazing cocktails (the New York Sour is one of my favorites) and pizzas are the best in the neighborhood. Their happy hour starts at 9pm,5.0
"Wheated sure is yummy. I wasn't even in the mood for pizza when my friends and I decided to take a trip here, and my oh my it was worth it. I ordered the Kensington and it was yummy, a traditional pizza with a twist if you ask me. One of my friends got the Vinegar Hill, it was so good, I wish I ordered that myself. For drinks I order the Paloma, it was refreshing, sweet without being too sweet. I wish I knew about this place while I was still in the neighborhood, but it was worth the trip regardless.",5.0
Amazing pizza and service!!!! Get the Windsor terrace !!! It won't disappoint. Owner is a sweetheart and will go out of his way to help you!! Will be back soon!,5.0
"Finally got around to trying Wheated, and was not disappointed! I like the space, and the staff was welcoming and attentive. Since we were going to share a meal, my friend and I had a salad to start, it was fresh, flavorful, and the portion was very generous. We shared the Sunset Park pizza with hot sopressata and it was delicious. Add some cocktails to the mix, and a very helpful server, and it made for a great evening. We'll be back!",4.0
"My wife and I drove to into Brooklyn from Boston on a Friday in October for the weekend. It took 5 1/2 hours. When we got in, we were beat hungry and disoriented. We walked to Wheated and got a seat almost immediately. It was almost 10pm. The servers were nice and attentive. They had happy hour past 9pm with a beer + shot deal for 7 bucks. I had a pilsner and a bourbon. My wife ordered a nice red wine. All drinks were great. We ordered a pizza with fennel sausage which was also great. They brought us chili powder and spicy honey which was really tasty. Overall, the place was cozy, relaxing and friendly. The food and drinks were great and it was all under $50 including a tip.",5.0
"I'm pleasantly surprised by this place. We came twice, not long after they opened. I know it's not easy getting things right with a wood-fired oven*, but they were putting out excellent pizzas and doing it consistently the first week.The crust has a pronounced sourdough tang. All ours were well charred without being overdone. They didn't quite meeet the Neapolitan ideal of lightness and tenderness. But maybe this isn't Wheated's goal. I'm personally ok with some crunch and chewiness. Purists of the style might find fault.The toppings we had were excellent. Not the best I've had in the city, but nothing at all to compalin about. Comparing to Robertas, my current benchmark, Wheated is as good in crust flavor, but is a couple of notches behind in crust texture and in topping quality (not everyone makes their own charcuterie and gets Alice Waters to help design the herb garden. And it took Robertas nearly three years to get their pizzas to the current level. A little perspective is in order).The beer list is excellent. The cocktail bar and staff look serious, and merit further investigation. Service is enthusiastic, if disorganized. I trust they'll work out the kinks.The decor is a bit bland. And the location is a funny juncture of nice old houses and auto parts stores and car washes. Sidewalk café tables are probably not in their future. The big caveat: don't come early. If you show up before 8, you might think you walked into Chuck-E-Cheez. I've never seen (or heard) so many todlers in one place in NYC. I don't know where they came from, and hope to never find out. We endured it the night we came at 7, but saw another couple leave with hands over ears.These negatives are minor. Wheated has done a great job with this place, and has given the neighborhood a much-welcome gift.*I believe their oven uses both wood and gas, but I'd still expect a learning curve.Edited to add: If they ever decide to do delivery, I'll upgrade to 6 stars.",4.0
"Welcome to the nabe David!! Top notch. The fit out is terrific, reclaimed wood and what not dominating, and a great looking bar. A delicious cocktail list, bourbon leaning but as balanced as it gets. Eager and friendly staff tending the floor and incredible pizza. The watermelon salad was perfect, cool, crisp melon and cucumber with a nice salty spike from the ricotta salata. Pies we ordered were the Fort Greene with sweet figs and salty gorgonzola, perfectly balanced. The Sunset Park was also killer, as were the cocktails. Great drinks, very nicely balanced cocktails. We had classics, Manhattan's and an Old Fashioned. Proper Old Fashioned, no muddled fruit or soda anywhere. Not sweet at all and garnished with an orange zest.

The pizza is simply delicious. The ingredients are fresh and there are many wonderful options to choose from. Definitely try the Thai chili powder and spicy honey. The bar is also amazing...the place is laid back and cozy.,5.0
"GAHH! DELICIOUS! Only been once, but its VERY GOOD. I had a pizza with prosciutto, arugula, and mozzarella. My roommate had something with tons of meat and it was also out of this world!

I was just there. I had to walk out. Hostess was not friendly and left us standing waiting for a table. There was many seats...instead she fumbled with a computer and bills. They need to change their customer service before I would ever return . Thumbs down.,2.0
"I give them 3 stars for trying. It's definitely not as good as all the big names but I can see that they are trying. The dough really needs work. It's way too thick and chewy. The toppings and the creative menu were on point. I see a lot of potential in this place and especially for the locals, they're lucky to have it in the area. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here however if you are far.",3.0
"Finally... the very first food establishment in the area that serves a cocktail EXACTLY the way it should be served: the Negroni. And draught beer as local, cold and foamy as it should be enjoyed. Seen the decor before, but it's very well executed...for the neighborhood, it's among the top 5 among The Costello Plan, Milk & Honey, The Farm, and newcomer The Dogwood, if you like industrial, raw and reclaimed. Now, as a native New Yorker, I tend to prefer traditional tomato pie over wood-fired-oven Napolitano pizza. Therefore, my eating partner and I decided to try a Hawaiian twist and order the ""Borough Park"" (go figure) and...WOW WOW WOW. Our tastebuds were overwhelmed in the best kind of way. Thinly sliced pineapple, generous gorgonzola, caramelized onion, and fresh arugula! We ate it fairly quickly while the cheese was gooey and the crust, hot. The house salad was a perfect size and offered a citrus dressing, candied walnuts and gorgonzola cheese (who wouldn't want more), though it was overdressed. The service was 5 stars, and they have a cool chandelier in the dining room that's worthy of note. Prepare for some noise...it's echoey when the place is packed on a Friday night, but be rest assured the 'bar crowd' starts to thin out after 9:30pm.Thanks, restaurateurs, for doing everything you did to make this vision come to life post-Sandy, and we're looking forward to the next visit and supporting you long into the future.",5.0
"My fiance and I live around the block and wanted to check out the new pizza spot that opened up on Church Ave.  Once we walked in, the server greeted us with a smile and seated us in the back area by the kitchen.  As we reviewed the menu, it took a while for the waiter to check on us and take our order.  I ordered the Bensonhurst pie and my fiance got the East Williamsburg pie.  When we first got our personal pies, the side plates were very cold which cooled down our hot slices.  The Bensonhurst was very good and the crust was perfectly thin and crispy.  The East Williamsburg was said to have truffle salt but we couldn't taste or smell the truffle at all.  This was very disappointing since these pies were the more expensive ones on the menu.  As we ate our pies, my fiance noticed the bartender making drinks.  As she tasted the drink she just made, the straw she used to taste the drink was then placed back in the drink, then served to the customer.  No matter where you're from, that is just plain gross.  Once we finished our slices and beers, our waiter took a long time to bring us our check.  There were only about 5 other people in the restaurant.  Although he was incredibly  nice, we felt forgotten quite a bit.  Not sure we'd come back any time soon...",3.0

"I have lived in Kensington for over a decade and have gotten excited time and time again when new restaurants opened, only to be let down and thus, forced to leave the 'hood for good eats.  Thank you Wheated for finally giving me hope! This is the first restaurant in my neighborhood that truly makes me want to stay vs. going elsewhere for pizza.  We have even taken friends from (gasp!) park slope and they were so taken, they now prefer to schlep to Church Ave. vs. pizza spots in their area. As for the pizza, I think the crust rivals the best in the city, using Roberta's as a standard.  We've eaten here several times and the crust has always been on point.  Most of the time, the toppings work and the ingredients are quality.  I am crazy about the Bee Sting pizza at Roberta's with spicy soppressata and honey--and am not sure if the toppings here quite match that brilliance imho, but overall, they're definitely good.  Cocktails are mixed well and beer is served ice cold, much to the deep appreciation of my picky, ""only IPA's on tap for me, husband.  In terms of improvement, I would really, really, really love a few more appetizers to choose from.  At this point, we have tried both the brussels sprouts salad and the caesar and I am not sure how much else there is to try.  Fwiw, we're fans of the brussels sprouts salad--which is shredded and raw--but the caesar needs more of everything.  I love lots of garlic and lemon in my caesar salad and nice, big crunchy croutons.  Though anchovies are offered and there is parmesan in the salad, it just lacks oomph.  And the croutons are miniscule which just doesn't work for me.Aside from this though, this is a lovely, welcoming place that I hope will remain in Kensington for many years to come.",4.0

"Happy to see such a hip looking place on this part if (well, less hip Church Ave) but the kitchen and staff may need a bit of time to consider some of the elements here that are less than stellar:Jazzy names for pizza of any sort is NOT enough: the pizza we had was cold ... We had it as take out but only around the corner! The issue seems to be confusion from kitchen to serving staff... Hipsters at a bar serving up drinks? It's cool and all, but a lot of us real neighborly folks LIVE here and actually don't want a show: just good food and good people is fine for us!Love the decor. That's an A+ Work on the 'delivery' (literally) that's a C+Cool the 'cool' down : that's a B-Try offering great PLAIN pie with just a piping hot marguerita style pie and with a family style size coupled with salad as a good solid offering!All round grade : B Thx",3.0
"Absolutely amazing pizza, very nicely balanced. Drinks are exceptionally good as well. I often do not get cocktails because proportions are always off and I feel like I have wasted my money on some flavored syrup. But that is totally not the case here. I have tried multiple drinks here with gin, tequila and bourbon, and I was really impressed with how good all of them tasted. I love that i have this place in my neighborhood, but it is does worth to travel to. I highly recommend  !!!",5.0
"Clueless waitress and it took too long to eat there. She was nice, but too much for her.Pizza and caesar were great. Wine, a red from Umbria, was great.  Nice atmosphere too.I felt bad for the people waiting by the door when I left, because there was a table next to me that was empty for like 10-15 minutes.So food 5 stars, service 3 stars. Maybe they could add a hostess or a waitress? Also people at door looked hungry. Be nice if they have one or two standard pizzas like the bensonhurst made on spec that they sell at the bar for like $8 half or maybe they could cram more ""ledges"" in the front (like for people in the bar area eating while standing or sitting on bar stools).",4.0

"Great pizza & great drinks/beers.  Apparently known for it's whisky selection?!It's some of the best pizza that I've had anywhere.  There's not much in my neck of the woods - this is about 3/4 a mile away and just about the first decent place you hit anywhere in that radius.Thin crusts, quality toppings, lots of variety - traditional and non-traditional toppings.Great for kids - I've taken my 3 year old a handful of time with no problems.The service is great, the owner is great.  Go here!",5.0
"this place is indeed vegan-friendly, thanks to the owners for explaining that. so far as I can tell, they still don't have it on the menu but they in fact have a vegan crust, vegan sausage, and vegan cheese. Your vegan friends won't go hungry here. I can't believe I said in the original review that their pizza is not to do for. It IS actually to die for -- I hadn't had their vodka sauce pizza yet when I wrote that review. (I'm not vegan, just have a lot of vegan friends). that pizza is INCREDIBLE. some of the best pizza i've had in the city anywhere. ever. at certain times, they get super crowded and their waitstaff seems a little overwhelmed. but i guess that's anywhere in ny. service is always friendly and helpful. i wish they had that chili-infused olive oil that some pizza places have. but they'll bring powdered chili if you ask for it.",5.0
"Best not to go with a group of friends on the weekend. If you do it should be as soon as they open or near closing since it is a small place. But there bartenders know what they are doing. They make some amazing cocktails. All the kitchen staff seem to of change, they don't seem to enjoy what they do. But the pizzas are still very tasteful. Top drink is a new york sour. Top pizza all. Can't go wrong with anything you order. Defiantly love coming here with friends but when its not rush because then I feel like they rush you out.",5.0

"I've been to this place four times and it's decent. Not very big and can get pretty loud, but the service is good. The menu offers several interesting selections. I've tried the Brighton Beach and Ditmas Park pies. I really do enjoy the Brighton Beach. The prices are a bit high for the size of the pies, but the food isn't greasy and does taste fresh. I don't mind paying for quality. The Mexican Cola is also much better than the high fructose corn syrup version that most places carry. One thing that does need improvement is the lack of a desert menu. They sometimes carry chocolate cake, but they often run out and they also don't offer any alternatives. Not sure why they haven't been able to be more consistent on this front. Overall, it's a decent place. Wish that they delivered and hand better hours. I will probably go to this place again since it's a very close walk, but I guess I will have to head home to get some desert since this place can't offer anything to their customers.",3.0

Great spot for date night or a night out with friends. All the pizza's on the menu are neighborhoods in Brooklyn which was a cute touch.

I'm really excited that this place is so close to my new apartment.  My boyfriend and I work late and not too many places are open.  We were really just looking for a decent meal late at night that wasn't too far.  Our meal and drinks turned out to be much better than we were even trying for.  We sat at the bar and found both bartenders to be attentive and friendly.  We shared the shaved brussels sprouts for an appetizer and shared the vinegar hill pizza for dinner.  He had the drink special of the night and I had a dirty martini.  Both were delicious and exactly what we needed.  We also met who I think is the owner.  He came over to see what we thought of everything.  He was nice and clearly cares about his restaurant and customers.,5.0
"WOW, My taste buds are on full alert after my first visit to Wheated. What an awesome little restaurant!Went with a small group of friends and we didn't have to wait too long for a table, the hostess was very friendly and noticed us the moment we walked in. Our waitress was equally pleasant, and got us all our drinks quickly. I'm usually not one to buy odd cocktails, but they were delicious, and worth every penny, Particularly the Scofflaw, which was not only delicious but packed a punch. We sampled four of their pizzas in total, a couple vegetarian and a couple with meat, and they were all fantastic, just really well made. And here's why:1. The dough was expertly crafted. Soft, crunchy, and beautifully colored with whites, tans, and browns. If this place is able to maintain that quality of dough, I'll be a long term customer.2. The cheeses used on each pie were superb. perfectly measured and melted, and well combined with each other unique ingredient.3. The sauce was the only area for improvement I can think of. Each pie had just enough so as to keep the pie from being too soggy (which is awesome, not ONE PIE was soggy at ALL!)  but at times I found myself wishing there was just a bit more sauce or olive oil to dip my crust into at the end....The owner stopped by our table during our meal as well, just to see how everything was. He was incredibly friendly and definitely made us feel at home. That kind of laid back personal touch is really great, you usually don't get that at other restaurants in this neighborhood.The bottom line: It was a bit more expensive than I would normally pay for pizza, but this is way more than just a slice on the way home. The flavors going on at Wheated are well worth the journey, and elevates pizza to a whole new level. Stop reading this and go check it out for yourself!",4.0
"I can't say enough good things about Wheated.  DiFara's aside, the stretch of Ditmas Park/Kensington/Midwood between Park Circle and Ave J has been long known for a lack of truly magnificent pizza.  DiFara's, while fantastic, doesn't make for an easy, relaxed meal, and San Remo on Cortelyou is good, but not good enough to truly elevate it to the level of NY pizza greats.  This place definitely is.  My partner and I headed over on Saturday, which was the second day of their soft opening.  We got there at 6pm, right when they opened to the public.  The decor is kind of contemporary farm/rustic, with exposed beams, wooden benches and tables, etc but still a little bit hipster.  Jazz was playing in the dining room, which was nice.  We were given the choice to sit in the dining room in the back, or at the bar.  If you're into it, they had a cocktail menu and full bar, we had red wine with our pizza.  Also, we had water at the table and I was really pleased that we were given a large crueset of water along with our two glasses.  I am a huge water drinker, and I always have to flat the waitstaff over and over to come and refill, so that was a nice touch not having to do that.We chose the dining room, and were seated in full view of the pizzas being made.  The menu had five choices for pizza, each named after a Brooklyn neighborhood.  We had the Bensonhurst, which was their take on the classic Italian pie - fresh and aged mozz, tomato sauce, romano cheese, basil, olive oil... and also the Caton Park, which was a white pizza (fresh and aged mozz, olive oil, parmesan) topped with arugula.  Within about 10 minutes of being seated, this place was packed, and all of the tables in the dining room were filled and about half of the front bar area.  We had the opportunity to watch the pizzas being made in the kitchen area, and these guys were super efficient, and appeared to have really worked at finding the right rhythm to crank out delicious artisan pies at a great pace.  I was initially concerned that we would wait a long time with such a crowded space (having been conditioned by DiFara's) but we got both of our pizzas together in about 10 minutes.  As an aside, I'm a vegetarian, and I noticed that at the station where the pizzas were sliced, there were separate pizza cutters labeled ""meat"" and ""veggie,"" which I appreciated a lot and not every pizza place has.  It's these nice little touches that really sold this place for me. Our pies were delicious.  They were personal-pizza sized, each one had about six smallish slices, so definitely an order of two or more is appropriate for two people.  Some of the other tables with three and four people ordered three and four pizzas, and they were so light they were all devoured.  For us, two was just right.  The crust was really thin and light, and had a just-right balance of flaky, charred texture without being burnt and too tough or too heavy.  With our pizzas, the Caton Park crust was perfection, the Bensonhurst was a little underdone in the middle, but still delicious.  I imagine as the kitchen crew grows in confidence they will be able to deliver more consistent crust across the various toppings.   The sauce on the Bensonhurst was fantastic - it was a hint of tangy, not sweet like a lot of corner pizza places, and really flavorful without that overbearing thyme problem also common to a lot of corner pizza places looking for flavor without really thinking about balance.  The cheeses were perfectly melted and bubbly, and had a just-right congeal mixed with the olive oil.  Not at all rubbery or one big blob.  Really, this was easily the best pie I've had in this neighborhood, easily on par with DiFara's.  The Caton Park was delicious also, the cheeses under the arugula were really good, and the arugula itself was sprinkled very generously with grated parm.  All in all the service was great, the waitstaff was super friendly and attentive, and the pie was delicious.  I can't wait to see this place grow and try the expanded menu as they build it out.  I did inquire about delivery, they are take-out and dine-in only.  Definitely a pizza win, and this will probably be our go-to pizza place from now on, with DiFara's as a nice treat when we're in the mood for the long wait.",5.0

"It's really nice to have yet another foodie haven grace our nabe and add to the burgeoning hip street that is Church Ave. What's cooler than brick oven gourmet pizza? The rusty rustic storefront is a cozy and inviting view of the bar. Dining is mostly located in the back. The pizzas are named after surrounding neighborhoods and streets. Not very heavy on the meat which is nice but I hope they broaden their selection to more adventurous fair, maybe? And they don't offer dessert. My suggestion of a Nutella pizza was quickly shot down by the owner :.( apparently it has too many carbs? The pizza was finely cooked chewy and crisp. Expected a bit more truffle on one of them but it was truffle salt and not oil so its expected. The prices are more than what you would pay at the dollar a slice joint but its gor-met! I ordered the house special New Orleans Cocktail which was so strong I couldn't order another I was breathing fire! The bathroom is located behind a secret door that has been wallpapered over. And although the restaurant is warmly furnished I'm still wondering wether the buck head we sat under was paper mâché or another wallpapered over thing. The staff were very polite and attentive. It was nice to see so many young families enjoying a night out as well as couples and the noise wasn't loud at all, pleasant and ambient.

We went to Wheated for dinner and were completely blown away.  We decided to eat at the bar because you can alway gauge a place by the bartender and Chrissy was on point.  Very social and great mixologist.  We love her!  We had 2 pizzas - Clinton Hill and East Williamsburg.  They were both very delicious and that sourdough crust was just freaking amazing. So glad they opened up in our neighborhood.  Definitely gonna be a weekly thing :-),5.0
"Haven't tried the pizza yet, but came in for a drink on Saturday night at the bar, and ended up having far too many expertly made cocktails. Looking forward to trying the pizza, hopefully they're as good as the cocktails.",4.0
"Amazingly shagfully tasteful yet sexy pizza.  This place is truly one of the greatest,  most satisfying pizza joints in all of NY. The fresh ingredients,  cold brews and friendly service keeps wheated in my fave-fives. Move over Robertas, wheated has knocked you out.  Okay fine Robertas is still great but wheated is tied or a thin notch better and it's less of a hike for anyone trying to avoid the seedy part of Barwick Robertas is in. Wheated, always stay please!",5.0
"The beer was yummy and the pizza crust was certainly very good, but the price!  The selection of pies was not so great and a small pizza was $15.  The place is essentially a bar with a pizza oven - not a real restaurant.  It wasn't for me, but seems like a good option for locals.",3.0
"We have been to Wheated twice. The service is always pleasant and we get seated right away. Both times we started with the Mixed Greens salad that has McIntosh apples,gorgonzola, champagne vinaigrette, lightly candied walnuts. Very very good. Our pizzas during both visits, tasted fresh and yummy, but there is something missing. Although the pizza menu is diverse and has healthy options, they lack flavor. Small wine/ beer menu, but from what we have tried, all good. Nice atmosphere and quaint little place.",3.0
"Went here for pizza early Friday night with my son - it was wonderful!  The crust was perfectly crispy on the bottom, but chewy on the edges... delicious!  And the sauce was great too.  My kid is a total pizza snob, and he kept announcing this was among the best he's had.  We got a salad too, very generous portion.  And the decor is simple, but very tasteful.  I'm just sorry it's taken this long for us to get here!",5.0
"Wheated is fantastic. The staff is professional, accommodating and friendly. The pizza is fantastic (especially the Borough Park. I dream about this pizza. I want it right now.) The salads are great too. The drinks are delicious and generous. The space is warm and cozy. I have no complaints.",5.0

"Not the best pizza in Brooklyn, but very good. The service is always excellent, and the cocktails are great! One of my favorite places in the neighborhood.",5.0
"much more than pizza. great beer, calm atmosphere and exceptionally friendly service. the beer was recommended by the waiter and was exactly what I needed. The pizza was not the one I ordered - but it was very good so I didn't bother to correct them. the wine was excellent and very reasonably priced. this is a great neighborhood place.",5.0
"We ordered take-out pizza from here filled with great hope, based on the other reviews. The Brighton Beach, which features bacon, had perhaps one slice of  it spread over the small and stunningly bland pie-- indeed, a couple of slices had no bacon at all. At $15, it was an insult to us and to all the far better ""greasy spoon"" pizzerias in this neighborhood.  The cocktails may be great, but if you're a pizza restaurant, you have to do better than this.",1.0
"Had the Sunset Park. Nice crust. Pizza (i.e. the soppresata) was so salty that we couldn't taste the tomato sauce. $15 small pie, about $3 too much. It's just pizza.",3.0
Great Pizza!  A most welcome addition to the Church Avenue Renaissance!,5.0
So I went to wheated last night food was excellent. Pizza makers were amazing made some of the best pizzas I ever had ! Waitress was very attentive and very professional. The place look awesome they had very cool animal head decorations. I only wish they where playing better music. It's Friday night ! They need some lively music not sleeping music ! But over all great place !,5.0
