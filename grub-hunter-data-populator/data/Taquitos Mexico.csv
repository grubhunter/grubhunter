"I'm very picky when it comes to Mexican food, especially since I reside in a city where Mexican cuisine has been chopped, screwed, and tailored to suit whatever demographic the restaurant is serving. Living in Bensonhurst has a few perks. The restaurant industry is not one of them. The only half decent options Bensonhurst has is Italian food and Chinese food, so when I was browsing on grubhub one day, I saw this place. It wasn't far, the delivery minimum was low, and their menu and prices were just too good to be true. Was this REAL Mexican food? I had to give this place a try. Since then, I've been hooked. I've had quite a few things off the menu, and have yet to be disappointed. My favorite thing on the menu is their torta. I could never get tired of it. Their quesadillas, guacamole, nachos, rice and beans, and burritos are all perfect. I've also had a few dishes (lunch and dinner specials) with steak which were great as well. This place is pretty small, but I was able to sit down and order a dish they offer that serves two people that comes different cuts of beef, cactus pads, rice and beans, and tortillas for a great price. From the dining area, you can see the kitchen and the grill which is kind of a big deal to me. The food is fresh, and the prices are right. Moving out of Bensonhurst is going to suck, but I'm definitely gonna make it a point to return.",5.0
"Just visited this restaurant on Palm Sunday after church with my parents. They brought out complimentary chips and salsa. Being that it was my parents first trip to an authentic Mexican restaurant ( its no tex-mex) they were eager to try something new. We ordered the fish in garlic sauce, placita mexico, more chips w guac, and the gordito. The two entrees came w rice and beans so it was easy to share amongst ourselves. Ambiance: Tiny spot for takeout mostly. Service: These guys were serving food, cooking, and setting up delivery/takeout simultaneously. Yet still managed to be kind & attentive.Food: Delicious, flavorful,well-prepared, huge serving size and did I say delicious? Yeah, good things. Price: Cheap & that works for me. Would I come here again? Yes. & I will.",4.0
"I often have a taste for Mexican cuisine, but living in the city you know the taste and authenticity can be vastly different depending on where you go. Having been to Mexico, I have only furthered my understanding of this cuisine, but cursed myself with not being able to settle for less. Here in Brooklyn, is one of the few places, where everything is present in one, great food, great service, and real deal Mexican dishes.Going for what seemed like one of their known for dishes, i had ordered the Platillo Especial. My meal started with chips and a tangy spicy salsa, and before I knew it, salsa verde, hot tortillas, rice and beans, and a huge steaming plate of food. The steak was tender and flavorful, seasoned very well along with the peppers. There was a mild sauce on everything that I really caught with the shrimp that put everything together. Little by little, fajita there, steak and beans bite here, and by the time it was all gone, I was already contemplating the next time I can make it out here.Definitely returning again soon!",4.0
"Clean but really small place, mainly a takeout joint. Quick service. Good guacamole. Enchiladas Suizas were on point. -1 star because they don't have a liquor license & what good is Mexican food without margaritas?",4.0
"Currently sitting in jury duty with nothing to do thinking about pork tacos. I know they have other food which I'm sure is great, but if you're going to eat food, you might as well eat pork tacos.",5.0
"This is easily my next favorite Mexican joint in Brooklyn, Next to Rico's tacos on Sunset. Ricos always give me a little bit of upset stomach, possibly a little more fatty.We ordered the meat combo ($25) and it was a full plate of meats (perfectly cooked medium rare flank steak, chorizo sausage, cheese, and pork chop). Ordered also taco salad (huge) tostadas, taquitos, empanadas. My least favorite was the empanadas. Everything else was delicious and the people in this restaurant was very attentive. New taco joint!We gave the cooks in the back a thumbs up, and they were so happy. Remember to thank them!",5.0
"This place deserves more than 5 stars, hands down! I have family over in Midwood (Brooklyn) and there is NOTHING good to eat in that particular neighborhood. I came across this place on Yelp, and it was most definitely worth the 10-15 minute drive. The food is EXCELLENT and so flavorful! The staff is great, and they go above and beyond to make their customers happy. I highly recommend this place to go eat if you're in the area.",5.0

"The tacos and burritos here are excellent!  Full of flavor and gives you enough of portion.  This place is small, has 4 tables and the set up is like a pizza shop but with eat in service.  However, don't expect much from the eat in service, there's only one person answering the phone and he's also taking care of the eat in customers, so if you don't ask, you don't get.  No water or chips to start with, unless you ask.  Sometimes there's a lady that helps out, but the wait time for the food can take awhile because they get a lot of delivery orders and they usually take care of those first.",4.0
"I ordered the ""nachos con carne al gusto"" with steak and they did not disappoint. The meat was fresh and flavorful as well as the beans and cheese and creme mix together. It was better than crack lol! I ordered the taco salad with a complicated way of asking how it was done(basically everything except veggies on it). The only reason why I didn't give a fifth star is that when I came to pick up my order they messed up the taco salad but they was quick to correct the mistake. Plus I wanted platanos and they didn't have it. But overall food is great!",4.0
"Impeccable service. I liked the waiter and thought the food was well portioned and came out hot. The free chips and salsa were amazing. The chips were crunchy abdominal none of them were burnt. The salsa was on the thinner side but was full of flavor /slightly spicy. These were actually the highlight of the meal.We ordered the sweet plantains; they were cut into thinner slices than what I'm used to, and were dry on the outside.  Tasted fine, but nothing memorable.The gordita was $2.75 and I thought it was ok for the price. It's a bit hefty due to the bulk of the dough which makes it dense. There's minced chicharrons, lettuce, cheese and cream. Unfortunately it lacked flavor and the dough just takes over. The cheese lacks any yang, which is surprising because it's queso fresco.My tacos with everything were ok. The 'everything' tacos are  $3, but  goat meat and tongue are .50 extra. The queso they use isn't very good, so I suggest not getting the everything and sticking to a regular taco. The shredded goat meat was dry and tough but had some good flavor. The tongue came in cubes and were tender but lacked seasoning. Each tortilla came with two tortillas. Also comes  with a side of limes and radishes. The  bf ordered a taco salad, something I've never seen before. It was huge! The outside is crispy fried dough and inside is a bunch of romaine lettuce, cheese, guacamole, black beans, salsa and the meat you choose. You get probably two tacos equivalent of meat. Overall this thing is hefty.The coconut flan was more custard than silky textured, but the flavors were good!I think this place is worth checking out. It's not the most amazing taco place I've been to, but there's great service and some darn good tortilla chips. I'd like to try the mole and other entree style items.",3.0
Tacos were delicious. The meat was kind of dry but definitely recommend the carnitas taco; very juicy.The chips with salsa was good and the sauce was spicy. I would probably order from here again.,4.0
"Saw all the good reviews on Yelp so decided to have mexican for dinner! I noticed when i entered my address for online ordering, they did not deliver to my vicinity so i called just to ask. The guy who answered took my order after i gave him my address so i guess that was not an issue? I live about 7 avenues away. I also read here that the staff did not speak proper english but i did not have trouble understanding the guy over the phone.. He did have an accent but he spoke fluently in english.It did take abt 30-40 mins for the food to arrive. I greeted the delivery guy but he did not greet me back.. So i paid him and tipped him then thanked him and closed the door. However, before i walked away from the door, i noticed the delivery guy was starring at my door still and shook his head in a ""no"" motion. Im wondering what that was abt.. I gave him a tip of $4 and change.. Im not sure it that was too little in his eyes? He biked over..Anyways, onto the food, everything tasted great. My mom and sister both had the steak burritos which they said was pretty good and finished half. My bf had the steak ala mexicana.. But the steak was a little overcooked or cooked too well so it was chewy. I had the steak salad and it was served on a crunchy shell. I enjoyed my food. We also had the coconut flan for dessert and that was great too.This will probably be our go to place for mexican food now that we tried them.. Hopefully i misinterpreted the delivery guy and that he really didnt have an issue w me and my tip..",4.0

"I grew up in Texas eating delicious authentic Mexican food. I also lived in San Diego for 6yrs & ate seafood influenced Mexican food & authentic tacos in Tijuana. When I first moved to NYC 17yrs ago, authentic Mexican restaurants were non-existent. Maybe a Tex-Mex joint here & there. Slowly, Mexicans started moving to NYC & opening small cafes offering their delicious cuisine. Then the Chinese started selling their disgusting tasteless form of Tex-Mex alongside fast food Chinese dishes & I thought I'd have to fly home to Houston for a good Mexican dinner. I found 1 amazing authentic Mexican restaurant in my neighborhood, but they don't deliver. Then my husband found this place through Seamless. DELICIOSO!!! The food is fresh & so flavorful. The tacos are exactly like my Tijuana tacos. I recommend the soft tacos. I've had the shrimp burrito, shrimp in a garlic white sauce w/ avocado, avocado salad & tortas to name a few items on the menu. Everything is delicious! The employees are friendly & delivery is fast. I have no complaints. We've tried several Mexican delivery in our area. This is the best!",5.0

(Can pay with cash or credit.)-Everything is packaged well in their proper to-go containersWhat we ate:-Guacamole, must be freshly made to order and is a decent portion (no brown spots at all)-Tacos poblanos (soft taco) tried Bistec, Carnitas, Chorizo. All tasty. (Chorizo was the most greasy.)-Tostada (flat hard shell) tried regular and carnitas. I preferred it with no meat on it. Nice and crispy. As a to-go item it remains crispy and in it's own container! A++-Burritos: Shrimp and vegetarian, no complaints.I will have to try to dine-in next time to optimize on the free chips and salsa and try some other entrees.",5.0
The guacamole here is the best I ever had.  It has the right seasonings.  I ordered the taco salad and it was goooood.  The taco shell tasted homemade.  I would like to try the fully loaded tacos and flan next time I go.,5.0
"Small place mostly for take out. There's only 4 tables in the restaurant. Fajita was good. Spicy pork burrito was good too, not spicy. Tamarind juice is a bit watery.  The place is clean. Portion is more than enough. Will definitely go back.",4.0
My normal take out spot...excellent as always,5.0
"Let me start, I saw this place got good reviews so decided to try it out. The chips were hard and not good. one taco costs $2.5, which is almost double of what some of the places on 5th Ave in Brooklyn charge. First the server gave me chicken instead of beef tongue. I also asked for what when he took the order, I had to ask again, and the water finally came when we got our check! The meats are flavorless, like they forgot to put some salt on it. Also, they don't understand English very well. Overall, it's pretty crappy and I will not go back ever",1.0
"Another satisfied meal at my now most favorite Mexican joint. Got the spicy pork huaraches, perfectly seasoned, good amount of kick, lots of lettuce, tomatoes and quesco fresco. Derek ordered chicken mole, which were rich and smokey, served with rice and beans. Kaylen had fries and chicken wings, crispy on the outside, piping hot and juicy inside, fried in a tasty batter. Just like our last visit, gotta have their lip smacking good sauces! Red smokey chili sauce and a delectable green chili tomatillo sauce...mm mmm MMM! Wait! Before we leave, gotta get their flan to go! Last time we had the regular one(velvety), this time we got the coconut, cannot wait to taste it later as soon as I get home!",4.0

"Decent food. Delivery time is always over an hour, even for simple items. Mistakes are made with nearly every order. They make believe they don't speak English when you call to try to correct your order. I've ordered about 7 or 8 times and every single time there was an issue. It's not a place to waste your time on.",1.0
"Best Mexican food I've ever had.  Everything is just special.  Words can't describe.  Maybe it's the freshness or the authentic homemade flavors.  Highly recommended. We had the loaded tacos, steak fajita, homemade chips and salsa are complimentary Me and the gf enjoyed every bite",5.0
"Free chips and salsa (legit) and a pretty large menu. Had the aforementioned chips and salsa and an order of guacamole. My girlfriend would like to warn everyone to not fill up on chips and salsa/guac. She ordered the chorizo taco and tostada (her benchmark for any Mexican restaurant) and heartily approved. As she is Mexican we must defer to her on all things Mexican food related. I had the enchilada suizas and they were delicious. We will be back very soon. Waiter was nice and quick, checked in on us enough but not too much, and while there was only one other couple eating in the restaurant, it does look like they do a huge takeout business. The cooks were going non-stop. Love an open kitchen. This is a better option than many of the overrated places in Sunset Park who all seem to provide mediocre food and terrible service. Worth the trek!",5.0

"I can't believe that I hadn't been here, until now. I've gone three times since I discovered this place about a week ago. Stayed in twice and took it home once.

"Going to get takeout from them again, first time around was sooo yummy. Last time I ordered an enchilada with chorizo and mole, so flavorful. Also got a side of nopalitos, had a little bit that night and it went great into omelette the next morning. Hubby had the burrito, and he likes to stick to classics so he just ordered another one. Can't wait to have some of that guac the other Yelpers have been raving about. Wish they delivered to my neighborhood.",4.0
"Came here tonight and the place was empty when I walked in but,  you could tell they were busy with deliveries. The restaurant has 4 four top tables so it's small. We were greeted with chips and salsa. Guac was so good. We also ordered the gordita which needed a bit more salt but still good. you could tell the corn tortilla was homemade. We also ordered the mar y tierra which had shirmp,  chicken, steak,  grilled queso fresco, and sausage. This dish also came with rice, black beans and homeade tortillas. This was delicious and I meant to take a pic but by the time I realized it,  it was too late. I ordered the coconut flan to go. Haven't tried it yet due to being full.",5.0

This place has a bunch of idiots working there... I went one day to get a hard shell taco and one of the workers told me that there was no such thing as a hard shell taco and maybe I should go to Taco Bell... I couldn't believe he said something so dumb so I asked for the manager... When I asked the manager about their hard shell tacos he shows me a tostada I told him that's not what I meant and he also told me that they only make hard shell tacos at Taco Bell smh I couldn't believe what I was hearing! Clearly these guys are idiots and needs some more knowledge before working in a MEXICAN restaurant smh just for that I will not be returning here,1.0
"I saw the reviews and decided to check it out because it was only a few blocks from me. Boy, was I not disappointed! After you order, they serve you chips and salsa on the house. Great homemade corn tortilla chips and spicy salsa. The lady who served us was very nice and attentative. I ordered two chorizo tacos with everything on it, and it was spicy and delicious. The corn tortillas are great! My boyfriend ordered the enchiladas in red sauce and it was also delicious and both our orders were perfect portion sizes for a very affordable price. We walked out with our bellies stuffed!$2.50 for a taco with choice of meat and toppings, $3.00 for taco with everything (lettuce, queso fresco and more I can't remember right now). The enchilada dish had three soft tacos slathered in tasty slightly spicy sauce for just under $9. The food was very satisfying.  We also got two bottles of Jarritos soda. My favorite is the grapefruit flavor.Apparently on weekdays they have $7 lunch specials, too! I will definitely be going back, lunch special or not, and bringing my friends with me.  Great place that makes me excited to live in this neighborhood.

All I said on the phone was ""Hi, I placed an order for delivery over an hour ago."" I was immediately asked to hold. I was on hold for like 10mins then someone hung the phone up. I called back and was finally told ""The delivery guy is on his way now"" took 15 more mins after that (i only live a couple blocks from this place). Food arrived cold and one of the meal orders was wrong. Food was Ok but an hour and a half wait was ridiculous. Will never order from again.",1.0

"I came here with high expectations because of previous yelpers' reviews in hopes of a new favorite go-to Mexican restaurant. The place is a tier higher than a hole in the wall and has about 5 tables of 4 seats. The service was good. The waiter even turned on cartoons for my daughter after she broke out in tears. I knocked down a star because the food wasn't the blow your mind, I would eat this everyday. I knocked down another star because when I asked for tap water, they gave it in to-go coffee cups. Mine had an unidentified item in it. Not sure if it was food or a bug but I was turned off and decided to stick to bottled water. They started you off with some spicy salsa and chips (thumbs up to any restaurants who give complimentary chips and salsa!!) I ordered the nachos with chicken and it was enjoyable and filling. I also ordered 3 tacos ($2.50 each); 1 steak and 2 chorizo. They provided with green and red homemade hot sauce (I had to ask for it but I'm glad I did. It definitely spiced up the tacos.) After splitting the nachos with the table, I had one taco and I was full. I took the other two home and it just didn't taste the same. They had a lunch special which I didn't order from but my friend did. For $7 she got a very filling burrito and mini salad on the side. I will be coming back to try the guac and chips!",3.0

And then he says he left to deliver another order. Okay now I'm really pissed cause this asshole is leaving me hanging and wasting my time, so basically I have to fix this problem myself.
