"Really cool bar. Great outdoor patio, solid drinks and a really nice atmosphere inside as well. I always enjoy my time here!",5.0
"Cool bar a few blocks down from the main entrance of Greenwood Cemetery. After being trapped inside a closed cemetery at night (we thought it closed at 6, not 5, so we got locked in!), we thought we needed a drink or three, so stumbled upon this little treasure, and loved it the minute we saw it. I mean, the outside is shaped like the outside of a boat! What's not to love?There's a fish tank inside. Behind the bar. It's mesmerizing. I couldn't stop looking at it. And it's the only brightly lit thing in the whole place, which makes it even better. The ambiance is pretty interesting; it almost looks like it's Halloween 24/7 inside, with giant spiders and skull aplenty, but maybe they're just going for a scary pirate theme. Bartender was really great, and recommended for me the Left Hand Wake Up Dead on Nitro, which was probably one of the best beers I've ever had.We ordered the Cucumber tomato salad and the Crab Rangoon from the little kitchen window at the front. It's sort of an awkward setup, and you have to keep checking back to see if your food is ready since they don't deliver it to you, but it works well enough. Salad was fine, but the crab Rangoon was pretty disgusting. Girlfriend and I both felt like our insides were rotting for the next twelve hours, and we're pretty sure the Rangoon was to blame.",3.0
"Fun bar in South Slope with great beer options, a real aquarium behind the bar, a chill backyard, and fake grass on the walls of the bathroom. I dare you to try to find another place that has all that. Didn't have any of the food, as we were just here to meet up before dinner, but maybe next time.",4.0
"*Don't go sit down and expect someone to come and serve you. That's not how they do it here. When you walk in, you'll see 2 guys cooking. This is where you order your food. The menu is written along the wall (just look slightly up). 1. Order2. Pay3. Give them your cell # - They will text you when the food is ready4. Wait for text5. Go back and pick up your food6. Bring it to the back patioFood: mediocre & overpriced I ordered fried oysters with mango salsa - 5 pieces for $9.50 & Large fries $4Drinks: order @ the bar - $2 off drafts, well drinks, and wine during happy  hour (5 - 7 PM)-I really like their cider that they had on draft. It wasn't too sweet like other ciders. I forgot the name of it though...Water: there's a huge barrel by the bar with clean cups next to it. serve yourselfOutdoor back patio (4 stars): so pretty. mini pond in the corner with fish and a turtle.  It's also kid friendly. There were a lot of kids on a Friday evening running around and sitting by the pond talking to the turtle. Overall, it's a bar with a nice a outdoor patio in the back. Come for drinks and hang out. Food is just Meh OK.",3.0
"Since I have a new bike, this place is more practical for me to drop in.I'm glad I did on this sunny Sunday afternoon, because frozen margarita's and fish tacos were a wonderful respite.  The BLT is still amazing too.   The quality of the food is just wonderful at this price point. Good value. Reasonable portions.They used to have Shake-shack-like buzzers, but now leave your phone number with the small kitchen, and they will text you when your food is ready. Love that ingenuity.  Thank you.",5.0
"My kind of bar. Funky little place with some cool quirky design choices, a great courtyard, and a few different seating nook and crannies for you to settle into. Had a great night here with a large group of friends that were spread out all over the place. Burgers were ok, not top notch, but decent enough. Other Yelpers may be complaining of the lack of service, (pay at the bar as you go - no need to sort the bill at the end of the night), but as a traveler accustomed to a more laid-back style of service, this just felt like home to me.",4.0
"The $20 credits card minimum (which I'm pretty sure was $15 until recently) is bullshit and illegal, incidentally. Outdoor space is cute and the food is delicious but overpriced.",3.0
"I think this bar is the PERFECT place to bring a date on a Saturday night. It wasn't crowded at all around midnight, we stayed until 2am, and you can have a conversation without being bumped into or screaming. My girl friend and I quickly realized this, since there were at least 5 couples out in the back area.First, the bartender was wonderful. We asked if we could see a cocktail menu, and right away he said that he could whip us up something based on what we were in the mood for. He made us a STRONG rum based cocktail with watermelon and it was delicious. For $12 a piece, it was worth it! This is coming from 2 girls who drink too much and too often. The back patio was perfect and calming. Plenty of tables, lanterns, and it was just a cozy feeling. While I was there at night I couldn't see the pond, but I think there is a pond somewhere too. The inside has a beautiful aquarium and plenty of tables too (just look at the pictures). The bar was very clean and gave off a great vibe.*Ps. You can order food when you first walk in, had my friend and I known, we would have gone here for dinner! 5/5 I'll be back for food and drinks.",5.0
"Really chill bar in [very] South Slope that offered a nice pit stop after our recent tour of Greenwood Cemetery. Nice vibe with the type of sundry characters and misfits you expect to run into in Prospect Heights and other margins of hip Brooklyn.Bartender was nice, beers were good (with some nice options, whether you want a summer sipper or get wrecked on an 8 oz. extreme beer). They don't have a full integrated kitchen, but there is a literal hole in the wall when you walk in staffed by dudes who will make you a tasty kielbasa or burger.The most memorable part, easily, is the Christopher Walken sailor painting we sat under. Truly, I couldn't take my eyes off it.",4.0
"This place has a very hip pub feel. You order your food in the front directly to the kitchen, and they text you when it's ready. My friend and I got the al pastor tacos, the fish tacos, and a large order of fries. The al pastor was spicer than I anticipated but great pub food all the same. We also got a couple cocktails, which were made well and tasted great.The outdoor seating area is pretty, with an artificial stream running through rocks and plants going through the center of the area. There was plenty of space for us at 3:30pm on a Sunday.All in all a hip, well-done pub experience.",5.0
"It's ok. Ambience is nice, aquarium, pond outside, but the bartenders and waitstaff are a bunch of assholes, very rude.its such a nice neighborhood but the servers act like they're in Williamsburg circa 2005.

You get all the food for yourself and your own drinks from the bar. That whole open a tab at the bar so unnecessary like the bartender was saying.Don't get me wrong the outside is really cute and so is the little aquarium contraption behind the bar but the SERVICE IS SO BAD its not worth it.The burgers are way overdone and are not soft and tender. The fries are just gross and oily? I left the fries behind and I never leave food behind.  I mean if you are used to good quality burgers like two8two in downtown Brooklyn or the pour house in Manhattan you will not be pleased. The bartender is just plain rude. I asked him where the water was and his response was along the lines of you see that barrel over there and proceeded to continue his conversation with someone while on his phone. He was more concerned with smoking outside than the costumers at the bar. When my friend asked what kind of root beer he has his response bordered we don't specialize in soft drink I mean really??WILL NOT BE COMING BACK.,1.0

This place is a unique treasure hidden in Brooklyn. The Sea Witch is head to toe nautical themed and it is every bit amazing. The outside looks like an old wooden ship while inside the bar is half of a boat with live fish in a tank. Overall the vibe is perfectly placed for a place like this. Since this was my first time I was confused how to order food as no one was there to great and seat my group. After talking to the bartender she informed us that food is ordered upon entry with the cook himself. The food options are like the place nautical themed with a few exceptions. I ordered the burger and crab ragoon. The portions are definitely bar sized so if you come here looking to fill up you will need to order a lot of food. The crab ragoon was very tasty. It comes with two dipping sauces. The first is a soy based sauce and the second an apple chutney. Both taste amazing when mixed with the crab. The burger on the other hand is of standard fair. Overall I give the place a firm 4 stars. I'm a sucker for themed dining experiences.,4.0

First thing the service was horrible. When my friend and I came in we asked the bartender about do we just sit anywhere and how do we order. His response was you get drinks here order there and pointed across the room out the door and than you find your own seat. So we go order our food and we each got a burger and split a fries. I go to order our drinks and I asked if they have root beer his response was this is a bar we don't specialize in soda. Then we finally get our food and the burgers weren't good at all. The fries were terrible. They where like the fries you get from a bottom of a bag that's been banged around a lot.  The service was terrible and everyone was rude and the food was awful too.

"Hands down one of my favorite spots in Brooklyn. I'm actually in Philly, but I'm up there regularly as I have twins that are Brooklynites. South Slope or wherever this is, recognize your gem.First and foremost, the whole reason I came to this place is because of one dude that works there... Kyle. Long story short, was going to see Erykah Badu with the Philharmonic at BAMM and the line was long as shit so we went to the German place across the street. Kyle was behind the bar. I was with two other peeps that worked at Rum Bar in Philly and Kyle expressed that he was in to rum and seriously made some of the finest rum cocktails I've ever... so I follow this dude to Sea Witch.As far as he's concerned... this kid is a beast... he's in his early/mid 20's, but he's a grown ass man behind that bar. Seriously... the force is strong in this one... mad cocktail game.Ok, enough of that... I'm a fan of Sea Witch, one... because Philly prices... two, the shit would be right at home in South Philly. three... it's dark as fuck... lights are always on midnight. Solid fare at minimal prices, and a solid beer list. They even have a pretty adorable outdooor space... and what we call a ""citywide special""... PBR and a shot for $5. Also a strong iPod game up in this piece.Come here... beer... beer cocktails... or just straight up booze... they even have a decent growing/evolving Rum list.",5.0

"I was trying for a long time to figure out a suitable bar to waddle over to post Talde for birthday shenanigans for a good long while. Well, I think I deliberated over it at the last second for like a day. I didn't want to go to the double Windsor, I needed a bar large enough for 20 of my nearest and dearest drunkard friends to wash down some reasonably cheap-ish beverages and this popped up on Yelp. I had never been here but have been to Freddy's near by a number of times. Which eventually of course happened at the end of the night. I mean, it is the Addams Family bar of South Slope, after all. This caught my eye with the outdoor garden and the fish tanks. There's a Moorish Idol fish (Gil) from finding Nemo in the main tank behind the bar, say hello. The garden out back has a bunch of picnic tables, heated lamps, bridges, little pools with brightly colored fish. It's a nice touch.

"Really loving this backyard bar- if only it weren't so far. Beautiful lush backyard complete with two koi ponds, turtles, and a little stream. Nautical themed, wooden interior, fish tank with exotic fish (including one that may have been fed fish food crack... swimming frantically, non-stop, from end to end for a solid 30 minutes plus), chain linked bar seats, sketches of mythical sea witches. There's a nice line-up of beers and service is friendly. Thought it was smart having the bar food stand in a separate, cordoned off section- menu looked great, unfortunately was too full at the time to try anything. Watch out for the blackberries splattered all over the backyard- not much to be done when there's a giant sprawling blackberry tree in the backyard. Just don't wear anything you mind getting stained!",4.0
"This is my first review on Yelp and I'm glad it goes to Seawitch. This place is amazing. Please order the egg and cheese sandwich during brunch. Your life will change. That English muffin is toasted to heaven-like perfection. While you crunch down, look at the sights: a turtle that is constantly doing the Superman, a semi-creepy mermaid mural, and the gorgeous fish tank. Basically, just wait for the place to open at noon and order the sandwich.",5.0
"Great place for a drink but eat elsewhere. Perfect pit stop after visiting Greenwood cemetery. Decor: 5 stars - really great vibe both inside and the garden.Food: 2-3 starsThe fries were super greasy and over cooked. The fish sandwich smelled ""fishy"" (fresh fish shouldn't). Prices were high considering you had to serve yourself. E.g. $9 for a sandwich without fries.Drinks: 4 stars - good selection Service: 4 stars - the food guy was a little brisk but the female bartender was friendly.",3.0
"Chill place with seating indoors and outdoors, quirky murals, and a fish tank behind the bar!  My friends and I didn't try any of food or cocktails, just beer and wine, but we thoroughly enjoyed our time here.  Also, the young woman tending the bar when we stopped in was awesome.  Her attitude immediately made me feel like I was having a really great afternoon.",5.0

"Hands down one of my favorite spots in Brooklyn. I'm actually in Philly, but I'm up there regularly as I have twins that are Brooklynites. South Slope or wherever this is, recognize your gem.First and foremost, the whole reason I came to this place is because of one dude that works there... Kyle. Long story short, was going to see Erykah Badu with the Philharmonic at BAMM and the line was long as shit so we went to the German place across the street. Kyle was behind the bar. I was with two other peeps that worked at Rum Bar in Philly and Kyle expressed that he was in to rum and seriously made some of the finest rum cocktails I've ever... so I follow this dude to Sea Witch.As far as he's concerned... this kid is a beast... he's in his early/mid 20's, but he's a grown ass man behind that bar. Seriously... the force is strong in this one... mad cocktail game.Ok, enough of that... I'm a fan of Sea Witch, one... because Philly prices... two, the shit would be right at home in South Philly. three... it's dark as fuck... lights are always on midnight. Solid fare at minimal prices, and a solid beer list. They even have a pretty adorable outdooor space... and what we call a ""citywide special""... PBR and a shot for $5. Also a strong iPod game up in this piece.Come here... beer... beer cocktails... or just straight up booze... they even have a decent growing/evolving Rum list.",5.0

"The backyard garden is an natural OASIS from the city. I love the site of fishes in the pond. The sound of rolling water. The wood benches, wood trunk seats and long wood tables. So nice to be in nature, despite being in the Gowanus.If it's wet or cold outdoors, there's indoor seating. Bar stools and booth seating. Several beers on tap. The bartender was so hospitable. She allowed me to sample a few draft beers until I decided on one.They sell food, near the entrance. Tacos and such. It's billed separately from your bar tab.Lastly, tap water self-service located towards end of the bar. Luv it!",4.0
"I was trying for a long time to figure out a suitable bar to waddle over to post Talde for birthday shenanigans for a good long while. Well, I think I deliberated over it at the last second for like a day. I didn't want to go to the double Windsor, I needed a bar large enough for 20 of my nearest and dearest drunkard friends to wash down some reasonably cheap-ish beverages and this popped up on Yelp. I had never been here but have been to Freddy's near by a number of times. Which eventually of course happened at the end of the night. I mean, it is the Addams Family bar of South Slope, after all. This caught my eye with the outdoor garden and the fish tanks. There's a Moorish Idol fish (Gil) from finding Nemo in the main tank behind the bar, say hello. The garden out back has a bunch of picnic tables, heated lamps, bridges, little pools with brightly colored fish. It's a nice touch. A huge mermaid mural on the wall, which makes a certain Little Mermaid enthusiast named Steph P. insanely happy, though I think the older mermaids scared her. This bar is both divey and oddly charming and kind of beautiful. I'm completely surprised with it all.Great list of beers on tap and a shockingly delicious food menu.

We met up with some friends for a drink on a Thursday night. Although we live in walking distance I was never interested in checking out the place. Always seemed like it would be a dive.

"Super solid south slope watering hole. They have a beautiful backyard where you can usually find a table. If you get hungry (which I usually am) they have decent food. It's your basic bar food that you hate-love because you're hungry af but you're too drunk and lazy to go anywhere so you slam a greasy cheeseburger and fries and then drink some more and reflect on your poor life decisions. And I like that there's no table service and at the register they give you an Applebees-esque coaster thingy that buzzes and blinks red when your food's ready. I tell you what, there's an extra hop in my step when I'm heading over to that counter. Passing by the bar like ""Hey guys, yeah you see my buzzer thingy, yeah that's right, high five!"" Also there's astroturf on the bathroom walls. Brilliant way of combating the graffiti problem so rampant in bar bathrooms across the city. Giuliani would be proud.",4.0
"Overpriced, mediocre food. Maybe cheaper than nearby bars, but the quality is much lower. Fish tacos were pretty good, but not even those were super memorable.

"Okay so my review of this place is going to be insanely biased. Anyone that knows me knows that anything of a sea/tropical/ocean/nautical nature is something I'm going to more than likely be over the moon about and this bar is no different. So when Ingrid S. sent out a Facebook invite for a place to head over to after her birthday dinner at Talde she was in between a few bars - none of which I remember since the minute I saw ""The Seawitch"" all my insides went, ""SQUEEEEEEEEEE!!"". Obviously I thought of Ursula and despite her in the past she was a nasty and they weren't kidding when they called her, well, a witch...I said something (I fortunately know a little magic It's a talent that I always have possessed) on Ingrid's message thread and it was also a bar she wanted to check out and so it was chosen.The outside of The Seawitch is kind of unimpressive and unassuming (What more is you lookin' for?), but upon entering I immediately wanted to become a part of it's world. There's a pretty large aquarium at the bar with BEAUTIFUL tropical, freshwater fish that look like they came straight out of Disney's The Little Mermaid ""Under the Sea"" cast or Pixar's ""Finding Nemo"". The walls are covered in beautiful hand-painted artwork of sea monsters,  beautiful (strangely kind of dark/gothic mermaids, but I can dig it!) merwomen, a not so beautiful seawitch and other under the sea things that had me all like, ""Look at this stuff Isn't it neat?!"". There's even a big mermaid thing in between their two bathrooms...sigh...how many wonders can one bar [cavern] hold?!!!Beer selection here isn't bad, though I've seen better and wouldn't particularly run here for the beer alone, although they did have some great seasonals and local craft brews (shout out to Ommegang! YUM!). The food menu here strives to make carnivores, pescaterians (Les poisons, les poisons, How I LOVE les poisons!) and vegetarians happy. My boyfriend enjoyed their Pork Shnitzel Sandwich (hand breaded deep fried loin of pork with banana peppers, chopped onion, iceberg lettuce, mayo, and house mustard) and also slathered hot sauce on it...because that's what he does, lol. Had I not eaten dinner previously I would have gone for their hamburger which sounds really sexy since it's a combo of freshly ground brisket, chuck and short rib seared...mmmmm...this burger sounds like ze bubbles!Prices are pretty reasonable for alcohol and food here (Now it's happened once or twice, someone couldn't pay the price) and the bar staff is friendly and efficient. The outdoor patio area is also a plus as it's pretty spacious and must be really nice in the summertime (what I would give if we could stay all day in the sun...). Sea Witch also has comfortable beer garden-style seating and two pond areas with medium-sized round boulders and fat goldfish swimming around being all cute (those poor unfortunate souls when it starts to get chilly outside).Overall I would totally come back to this bar for brunch (which is really just deli type breakfast sandwiches) or to try their lunch/dinner offerings and check out their rotating beer list (plus with all their gadgets and gizmos aplenty!) just wish it didn't involve having to take our insanely unreliable R train...also this bar could use a hot crustacean band.

Now get a service industry job and realize that it's hard dealing with most people's bullshit.Nothing but love, Sea Witch.",5.0
"A+ location for me.  The food is kinda delicious, though the buns can be those ignorant potato rolls that you can see smashed in a 12 pack.  That kinda sucks when you're paying $9 for two fingers worth of cod and a leaf of iceburg underneath.  The shishito peppers are simply fried in oil and served, no batter or taste added.Bartenders tend to be urban woodsmen kinda blokes, Portland spilloff.  One guy kept changing the music every time it was anything remotely hip hop or good.  He turned some classic Nas to hear some really whack steel string blues that could be found on a cd sold at Starbucks.  Meh, it is fine.  Show up before happy hour is over and you will probably rate it higher than me.  7:01 and you will likely agree.",3.0

Decent-priced drinks, friendly bar staff who turned down the A/C when we asked (we'd been outside for hours, and we were cold!), cool weird murals, and an outside with picnic tables, gravel paths, and koi ponds that I'd love to check out sometime when we're actually allowed out there. (They let us go take a look, but the yard was closed so the neighbors could sleep.)The best part was the fake candles on every tables. They have alarms that flash red and beep when you tip them over!

"I love this bar in the summertime! It reminds me of being at the at the beach. When you first walk in, you're greeted with a food stand worthy of any boardwalk. Fried fish sandwiches, oyster rolls, and fish tacos are at the top of my list at this place. But you can't go wrong a BLT or grilled cheese either. After you place your food order -- which you will do because it smells so good -- you walk in to a huge bar area backlight by giant blue fish tanks of cool, but very bored-looking fish. They don't even have a sand castle or a sea plant to swim around. I feel bad for them. But that's neither here nor there. I'm sure they're actually very happy fish. I've never tried cocktails or wine because they have a great beer selection of all my favorites, and when you're at the ""beach,"" you want a beer.

"Now that I'm a Brooklynite, I've accepted that it may be a long time until I can once again enjoy the pleasure of my own personal backyard and BBQ. This is pretty okay by me, as I have trouble even keeping my fire escape garden alive, and do not enjoy falling asleep with the scent of charcoal in my hair. And luckily, I have the backyard at Sea Witch to enjoy in the meantime. This spot's pretty unassuming from the front -- it looks like a dive bar, and not even an ironic one at that. It's located pretty far south in the Slope, in our as-yet-ambigiously-named neighborhood (not quite Sunset Park, not quite Park Slope, and some folks still don't agree that South Slope is a real thing, including the realtors who sold us on our apartment here). But inside, Sea Witch is a sleek, fabulously air-conditioned restaurant with solid five-dollar burgers, a constantly-rotating and reasonably-priced beer list, and yes, now I'm finally getting back to my point: a BALLER BACKYARD. This is not just your typical bar-backyard, with a few picnic tables strewn across an uneven brick patio. This is a tiny, Zen oasis, complete with koi fish, a bubbling stream, and attractively constructed seating. There's a small spot for smoking, but the rest of the anterior air is fresh and clean--well, as clean as it's gonna get in a city of millions. So, between the fantastic burgers, the cheap beer, and the backyard, I'm confident that my dependence on Sea Witch easily trumps toiling away in a pile of manure or scrubbing burnt beef fat off the gas grill. And if you are a Brooklynite who is feeling similarly poor, hungry, lazy or land-less, you will also like this place.",4.0

When he was confronted with this information, he blatantly lied saying he was overwhelmed with an overcrowded bar. Listen, I'm a deploying soldier and my sister was the one complaining about the show service. The bar seats about 20 people. There were roughly 12 people at the bar at any given time. Give me a break. You are slow because you are slow.",2.0
"Came for lunch. It was super empty, and too cold for the patio. It's probably really nice in spring/summer.Had the clam roll and pork schnitzel with fries. A bit too much fried food, but it wasn't bad.I would come back for the patio and maybe to try the burger.",3.0

"extra stars for decor, wonderful back patio, koi pond, friendly and fast bartender. Food was good, the guy was in the worst mood ever when I ordered but maybe cheered up by pick up time at the window. the food was good but not nearly as cheap as advertised. I think the prices have gone up substantially from what I see on older reviews, but still good. 2 seafood sammies, 2 cocktails, 2 beers was about $70.",4.0
"Now that I'm a Brooklynite, I've accepted that it may be a long time until I can once again enjoy the pleasure of my own personal backyard and BBQ. This is pretty okay by me, as I have trouble even keeping my fire escape garden alive, and do not enjoy falling asleep with the scent of charcoal in my hair. And luckily, I have the backyard at Sea Witch to enjoy in the meantime. This spot's pretty unassuming from the front -- it looks like a dive bar, and not even an ironic one at that. It's located pretty far south in the Slope, in our as-yet-ambigiously-named neighborhood (not quite Sunset Park, not quite Park Slope, and some folks still don't agree that South Slope is a real thing, including the realtors who sold us on our apartment here). But inside, Sea Witch is a sleek, fabulously air-conditioned restaurant with solid five-dollar burgers, a constantly-rotating and reasonably-priced beer list, and yes, now I'm finally getting back to my point: a BALLER BACKYARD. This is not just your typical bar-backyard, with a few picnic tables strewn across an uneven brick patio. This is a tiny, Zen oasis, complete with koi fish, a bubbling stream, and attractively constructed seating. There's a small spot for smoking, but the rest of the anterior air is fresh and clean--well, as clean as it's gonna get in a city of millions. So, between the fantastic burgers, the cheap beer, and the backyard, I'm confident that my dependence on Sea Witch easily trumps toiling away in a pile of manure or scrubbing burnt beef fat off the gas grill. And if you are a Brooklynite who is feeling similarly poor, hungry, lazy or land-less, you will also like this place.",4.0

"I love most things about this place: food (and the guys who make it, who are hilarious and sweet), decor, outdoor space, atmosphere. Because I'm a fair reviewer I'm not going to let the bad bartender cause me to give this place one star, but I have to admit that I'm tempted. It was a not-so-busy Saturday night and the short female bartender with the nose piercing flat-out ignored several people in my group. One of them she saw and then asked to wait until she finished texting, and the other one had to wait nearly 15 minutes for her to approach despite not being busy. I was also ignored for a few minutes. These were all very blatant, purposeful moves on her part, as she made eye contact and chose to ignore these paying customers by turning her back.

"This place was a big disappointment.Here's some backstory for those who need backstories (otherwise just skip down). Three of my friends and I were shopping at the Brooklyn Ikea and were planning to get those hyped up meat balls that they serve. However, we spent too much time sleeping on their beds and buying lamps that it's already 9pm and their cafeteria is closed. Well damn. So we searched yelp and within a mile radius was this place. We were convinced by their pictures. It made it look nice and cozy... Now onto the real review:We were confused when we arrived about the ordering  and seating process but the cook in the front was friendly enough to tell us the procedure. He said because the menu is so limited, everything is good. Yeah okayyyyyyy! We ordered the fish filet, fish taco, oyster thing, and the clam roll. They gave us a device which buzzed when our food is ready so that was pretty cool. While we waited, we went inside to check out the place. Yelp reviews had said that they had a nice backyard... It was nice but there were so many fallen blueberries everywhere that we couldn't find a bench that wouldn't ruin our clothes so we headed back inside the bar. We found a nicely secluded and cozy, fake candlelit, table and waited a sufficiently long time for our food. We played games to surpass the time.When the thing buzzed, my friend went out to the front to get our tray... Wow, our food was small. Pretty much similar to sampler sizes. We waited a long time for so little food. We were so hungry!Worst part is, the food wasn't even good! None of us liked our respective orders. The food actually made two my friend's stomachs hurt. I'd rather eat fast food than pay for the overpriced food here. That way we could actually get full (true story we went to McDonald's after this place). TL;DR:  would not go back.

"The Sea Witch is a magical gem. Rode my bike out today because my friend said they had a great burger and it would be a good breaking point in the ride. It happens to be the first really nice day of the year, so I was absolutely delighted to see the super awesome, zen like  backyard area. Aesthetically, loved everything about the place - the yard, the cool mural inside, the mesmerizing aquarium, even their logo. order food at the little window up front and they give you one of those burger locator devices that shakes and buzzes when it's time to pick up food. Super friendly workers, very laid back. Best part is - not very crowded and the food was fresh, delicious, and very reasonably priced. I want to go back not only to try other items on the menu, but also for a nighttime drinking session. I wish it were in my neighborhood because I'd live there. And that's exactly why it wouldn't work in my hood - the place would be mobbed. Definitely on my top ten list of fave brooklyn bars now. Hell, it's #2 right behind Dynaco.

I will definitely make this a new regular place to come to with friends. Check it out.Update: I had to drop a star off the original 5 I gave them. I had the oyster fry thats on their brunch menu that the cashier recommended, and it was not good at all. Very fishy tasting. The fish taco I ordered was almost tasteless.

Throw a Sixpoint on it. * There's a zen-ish backyard with cool diagonal wodden long tables, large pebbles and a little foot bridge over a pond.* Bartenders seem to be devoid of pretension as real live fish swim around in an expensive aquarium behind them. * A large, monochromatic mural featured on the back wall depicts the sea witch herself--droopy bewbs and all.

Probably the best hamburger I've had in a very long time. This place is great! I love the outdoor space and a nice beer selection. Food and drinks are very reasonably priced. My hamburger and beer came to $11.50. Yes you $11.50!!!! At most places in the city and in certain parts of Brooklyn a freakin hamburger is $13.00 and up! Sea witch burger was $6.50 and no extra charge for cheese!!!!,4.0
"After reading the reviews and a stellar recommendation from a co-worker, the bf and I venture off to sea witch last rainy friday evening...we walked in and it was fairly crowded but eventually got 2 seats at the bar, the bartender took sometime to come to us to get our drink order, so I left to order food (fish sandwich, pretty decent and the pork schnitzel was told it had too much breading) ...eventually we got our drinks and food, but can't get over the vibe of the place...I think it might have been the group of young 20 year olds girls ordering shots of Jameson topped with water (WTF)...that I think it even took the bartender back as well...as a Jameson drinker...I was digusted!   I will come back to check out the outdoor space, maybe the vibe is different in the afternoon.",3.0

"I really love this place. Living on 23rd street, it's nice to have a bar close by that has a great combo of cheap (yummy!!) food, a great craft beer selection for incredibly reasonable prices ($6 for Brooklyn sorachi ace!) and a lovely outdoor seating area. I've always had great experiences with the bar tenders, and that cheese burger has me coming back with cravings at least once a week. Highly recommended.",5.0
Another South Slope spot with a great outside space and solid drink offerings. Haven't personally tried the food although the fish tacos come highly recommended. Go early (or during the week) to beat the rush for the seats outside in good weather.,4.0

"Ahoy! Recently had the pleasure of dining at Sea Witch, South Park Slope's new restaurant and bar. (It ain't Windsor Terrace by the way, Yelpers) They get an A+ for atmospherics: novel light fixtures, mottled copper tabletops, an ethereal deep-sea mural featuring the Sea Witch herself, and an ellipsoid salt water fish tank whose lack of reef structure simulates the Atlantic's Abyssal Plain. The food and drink will draw landlubbers and sea scalawags alike, for the price; but the reviews I've seen concerning the quality itself are not on par with the reality. My roommate and I had the burger and were neither impressed nor dissatisfied. Too, with such a great atmosphere I feel like Sea Witch could benefit from getting a few good DJs in, or at least a theme night here and there; even some themed menu items or drink specials like Pirate's Booty, Yo Ho Ho's (hushpuppies?) and a bottle of rum...the possibilities are truly endless. The place is still young, though, so I am 3-stars hopeful that the Sea Witch will find her way rather than getting lost on the open ocean. You'll definitely see this scaley sea dog there again! P.S.

Her grilled cheese was spot on and the clam roll was massive and well worth the $11. I'm not a huge fan of clam bellies, but I really enjoyed it all.

The outdoor patio is really chill and I like that the smoking and non smoking section are separated. The one thing I think this place could improve on is the music.

"Popped in here after a long stroll through Greenwood Cemetery last Saturday and found myself happily planted on the barstool for three beers + one order of clam roll with fries. Delish x 3.

"At first glance, the Sea Witch appears to be another nondescript Brooklyn bar, but I was pleasantly surprised when walking in.

The nautical theme plays out smoothly [read: ship's lanterns for lighting when it starts to get dark.] As everybody on Yelp has pointed out, the selling point here is the spacious back yard with big picnic tables and a little waterfall. The inside of the bar is well-appointed, too. I didn't order any food this go-round, but I liked the set up: a take-out window at the street front, so you can carry home or bring your goods inside with you.

"I am trying to love this place, really I am, but I just can't get past like.A lot of effort was put into creating the space, and it looks very cool, but its not very comfortable for patrons.  For example the chairs are custom-made but not very comfortable and all but impossible to move. The ambience overall is very dark and maybe a tad uninviting. I can't decide if the gigantic fish tank is mesmerizing or just distracting.  The tap beer selection is vast, and yet it is very esoteric and sometimes I have a hard time finding even one beer that I like.Maybe I'm coming here too often but the music is a bit repetitive, would like more variety there.The late night food option is great for the nabe and I give their food two thumbs ups.",3.0

I'm glad I gave this place a chance- it's remarkably chill. The nautical theme plays out smoothly [read: ship's lanterns for lighting when it starts to get dark.] As everybody on Yelp has pointed out, the selling point here is the spacious back yard with big picnic tables and a little waterfall. The inside of the bar is well-appointed, too. I didn't order any food this go-round, but I liked the set up: a take-out window at the street front, so you can carry home or bring your goods inside with you. There's even a vegetarian sandwich for those who aren't swayed by seafare.",4.0
"Cozy place with a gorgeous backyard, friendly staff (who have great taste in music, too!) and a great, well-priced draft list. I cant wait to try the food!  This place is far from my house, but i never regret making the trek.  All neighborhood bars should be like this.",4.0
"FYI...no strollers, which I'm sure many of you NonBreeders are jubilant about. But...on a Tuesday evening before 9, when no ones even in there, and I wanna take my mom for a burger with my sleeping baby...gimme a break! Good luck Sea Witches",1.0
"I am trying to love this place, really I am, but I just can't get past like.A lot of effort was put into creating the space, and it looks very cool, but its not very comfortable for patrons.  For example the chairs are custom-made but not very comfortable and all but impossible to move. The ambience overall is very dark and maybe a tad uninviting. I can't decide if the gigantic fish tank is mesmerizing or just distracting.  The tap beer selection is vast, and yet it is very esoteric and sometimes I have a hard time finding even one beer that I like.Maybe I'm coming here too often but the music is a bit repetitive, would like more variety there.The late night food option is great for the nabe and I give their food two thumbs ups.",3.0
"Good beer selection, Beautiful fish tanks behind the bar gives them distinctive atmosphere. They have really good bar food, fastfood style (you order at the window). Schnitzel burger  or fried cram burger are so good you must try--all under $10. Also note that they have the most awesome backyard in the neighborhood!",5.0
"great atmosphere good sandwich, kinda pricy on the food, good drink selection, nice outside spot in the back, when the food took to long the cook gave us extra fries, really nice cook, really nice order taker girl for the food... love the front windows, I hope this place lasts long long time :)",4.0
"You know? This place was pretty good! The food and the bar are two separate parts of the estabishment.  If you want to order food, you pay for it at the food counter, and then you get a pager, and can either go out back to their outside deck or sit at the bar, and when your food is ready it buzzes.  They have tandard bar fare, like burgers and fries, but they also had some other options which were a nice touch.  The beer selection was really nice too, and it's great to see new places like this opening in south slope.",4.0
"Great local bar with a good selection of beer on tap and food from the kitchen. This place is really great when it's warm outside so you can enjoy the outdoor area in the back. The giant fish tank behind the bar is super cool. They have a good happy hour special too, $2 of drinks until 7pm, perfect for drinks after work.",4.0
"Went there for the first time Saturday night. It wasn't that busy but the service at the bar was really slow and at times we were just ignored. I want to like this place as I live in the neighborhood and welcome new establishments to patronize. Mary's, across the street, was far busier but had much quicker service.  (Also, it's not in Windsor Terrace. It's in Greenwood Heights.)",2.0
"This place is a gem for sure. Great beer selection, delicious food, and low prices. The back patio makes it worth coming back for. So glad I found Sea Witch!",4.0
"Meet up with the husband here for a few drinks. Decor was nice with a sea theme, fish tank, lamps with stars in 'em. It was clean and I think seemed out of place for the neighborhood its in. I ordered gin and tonic a beer after, bartender was nice. The crowd were full of 20 and 30 somethings. Place to just chill. Next time I come I'd have to try the food.",3.0
"I can't believe a place so amazing has opened in my humble neighborhood. First of all, the front- facing wall is altered to look like the captain's quarters on a pirate ship.  The walls are covered in wooden slats filled with pitch, and the barstools are supported by what looks like an anchor chain.  If you entertain pirate fantasies, this the place to drink, matey.   I mean, if you're more of a gentleman pirate who likes the finer things in life.  This is a more upscale nautical concept.   Fish peer out from a large aquarium behind the bar. Creepy merpeople adorn the rear wall.  The best part of all is that unlike most of the local bars, you can also get a cheap sandwich and some fries here.   I have yet to sample anything but the fries, but the hubs recommends the pork schnitzel.  I do hope they expand the menu a bit, but it's just nice to see a place thinking about the food-to-grog ratio in one's stomach.  Speaking of, the Sea Witch has Allagash Curieux on tap, delicious and dangerous at 11% alcohol.  I was soon singing sea chanties.",5.0

"Totally loving this new addition to Greenwood Heights - it is right across the street from my apartment.

"Stopped in for brunch, no one greeted us, (not even a hello) We found a table in the back, it was beautiful, the coi pond with the turtles and the whole environment of the back yard was awesome.

The chef who was, taking orders, receiving money and expediting food was snarky and rude (which I get because he was weeded) and the bartender wasn't much help either. Why was the cook doing everything? When we got our food (after waiting for a really long time) my date's pancakes were cold and my hangtown oysterfry had multiple egg shells (yuck) in it and the oysters were slimy mush(vomit) also, I got toast... not buttered, no butter option or jam given... just plain dry toast. I also didn't get any silverware and when I asked he was again rude, why should I fear someone who is placed a position of customer service? Someone get this guy some help.  When we finished there was also no designated place to put the trays and trash, we looked. This place needs more staff, that was a terrible brunch experience minus my handsome date and the cool backyard.",2.0
We really like Sea Witch' take out window. They make great burgers and fries. We tried the bar once and felt no one was really interested in taking our order as we stood there for 5 minutes at a pretty empty bar. Maybe it was the time we went (5pm on a weeknight) or the bartender was kind of a jerk. Who knows? We will be back though to enjoy the great outdoor space they have in the summer.,4.0
"What kind of asshole takes a baby to a bar? Okay, us. But we were craving the pork schnitzel and the sitter fell through. Fortunately, folks were cool at the Sea Witch, as they always are. We found a spot in the corner, an IPA for me, a glass of white wine for the wife. The pork sandwich was as delicious as I remembered, crispy and juicy, with the richness balanced out by thin slices of sharp banana pepper. I love the fries on the side, which go in the direction of matchstick, but keep enough heft so that you still taste potato more than fryer. I've worked my way through most of the menu and have yet to be disappointed. The kielbasa is toothsome and full of flavor, with horseradish mustard that's totally tweaked (in a good way). The clam roll is a major winner, too. The music was great the other night, although at a couple of points there was some rougher stuff that caused the baby to stir. Apparently she's not a Clash fan. I'm tempted to deduct a star for not having an infant-friendly soundtrack, but what kind of asshole does that?",5.0
"This place is awesome!  The food is cheap and delicious, and the selection of beers on tap is good and also reasonably priced.  The garden has lots of seating room, so it doesn't feel crowded even though it looks like a lot of people are there.  Will definitely return for more clam rolls, fries, and the delicious dogfish head!",5.0
