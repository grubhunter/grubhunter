"i've been coming here for years, and i have yet to be disappointed. the staff is friendly, attentive, and professional, and has been since my first ever visit when i came in a group of six for brunch. they sat us in the backyard and helped us out of our sad hungover states with coffee, creole bloodys, and amazing service. they treated us like regulars and old friends since day one. it's impressive when a bar can make actual cocktails -- properly -- and still puts a lot of care into their food menu as well. if you're not a stuck up piece of human garbage, you'll have a great time. some tips: - the backyard closes early (9 or 10)- last call is at 1am- happy hour is all day on tuesdays- yes, you do want gravy on your biscuit, it's delicious- pull the stick out of your ass- tip your server",5.0
"The biscuits were good - really good. But it stops there. I ordered the fried steak. The steak had no flavor and the breading had no flavor. It seriously tasted like cardboard. It was the worse thing I've eaten in a long time. The collards were disappointing as well. The hurricane tasted like cough syrup. I was hoping the waiter would offer to take the meal off my bill when he saw that I didn't eat 90% of the meal. In terms of the drink, I had him put seltzer in it but nothing could help that god-awful taste. My girlfriend said she liked the catfish po boy, so I guess that's a plus. Needless to say, this is one neighborhood spot I will not be returning too.",1.0
"Amazingly mediocre. Just totally nothing extraordinary. Striving to be passingly acceptable.This is not a Louisiana/New Orleans-style restaurant. In fact, I heartily hope that no one associated with this restaurant is actually from Louisiana. Because if they are, then their association with this restaurant has surely caused immeasurable tension and strife around the family Thanksgiving table. Because the food is, um, let's just say, inauthentic to its supposed origins.My grandparents are from Louisiana. My dad is from Louisiana. I've spent significant time in Louisiana. If this restaurant were in Louisiana, and not in Brooklyn, it wouldn't have lasted a year.  But for Brooklyn, okay.",3.0
"Great food, good beer, and super friendly and nice staff. They also have a back patio. They have lots of seating. I like this place because it's a casual neighborhood spot. It's totally unpretentious and just a fun place to hang, especially for happy hour. Everyone is just hanging out and not there to prove anything. I wish they had a shrimp poboy, but the friend chicken poboy, mac and cheese, and cornbread are delicious.",4.0
"This is a cute little piece of down south in Brooklyn. I have been here about 5 times and I will say that I like it. I order the deconstructed po-boy, which is basically baked catfish over rice with some  coleslaw. Very Good. i also like the mac and cheese it's great. I will say that the smothered steak/Porkchop? some kind of meat was not that great. My giest ordered it and sent it back twice.Other then that the service is good and it's worth the stop.",4.0
I was searching for a place to eat. Found this restaurant. It was zagat rated and had a ton of reviews. All the photos on Yelp looked delicious. Got there at about 4:20 and was told that the kitchen is closed till 5. The decor and ambience is nice. There is a bunch of hot sauce bottles lined up against the wall. Pretty cool.  The bar tender was conversating with people at the bar really loud and kept dropping f bombs. I felt it was inappropriate in this setting. Any who at 5 we got to place our orders. I had the southern fried steak and my bf had the catfish. We also had boudin balls as an appetizer. We also had a side of collard greens and crawfish mac & cheese.The boudin balls were lackluster. Tasteless and contained too much rice. Also they were not heated properly. The outside was warm and the inside had cold spots. The fried steak was super oily.  Just couldn't understand how it was so saturated with oil. It was like they took it straight out the fryer and put it on the grits. Wasn't even edible. Not to mention it was bland. The crawfish Mac & cheese was extremely oily too. Also a little bland. Couldn't get past the oil though. But nothing was as offensive as that slab of catfish on my bf's plate. It was steamed I guess with nothing but old bay seasoning on top. I mean a ton of old bay seasoning. Also wasn't edible. I've had Cajun food before and this is not. It.Oh almost forgot I ordered lemonade and instead of being homemade it was instant. I mean seriously? Ever heard of a southern or Cajun restaurant that used instant powder to make lemonade? Lol. Comical.This is one place I will not revisit.,1.0
"Came here yesterday with a Freind. Ordered the Catfish PO Boy. First Bite and it was just too overseasoned. I could tell what seasonings were used but it was just too much. The salad that came with it was my saving grace.   When I told one of the folks who work here he basically just shook his head like yeah okay, but I knew he did t care for anything I said. My Freind also stated this was his second time coming here and it was the same complaint. Vibe is cool but I won't be coming back here. I don't need my blood pressure rising up after I eat the food!",3.0
"Popped in here at 11:30pm on a Saturday night. The place was pretty empty and we were able to grab a table rather easily.The vibe in the place was very cool and hip, although I felt the music was obnoxiously loud. The decor was fitting for a southern/creole restaurant. I ordered the vegan jambalaya and it came out fast and was delicious and hearty! The portion size was just enough to have you full but not too much, making you take leftovers. I love that they have a giant selection of hot sauces, as everyone does have their preference.As a vegan there is only the one option as a main course, however I will definitely recommend anyone who is not vegan to give the jambalaya a shot!",3.0
"They have great service with a laid back, authentic New Orleans feel. One day I came in and two other patrons and the bartender started talking about local businesses and classic rock. It was a great afternoon.I usually get the delta omelette with grits. It comes with crawfish and shrimp and it never disappoints. The drinks are potent. Order their famous hurricane for a solid buzz. And they carry a wide selection of beers (any Shiner Bock fans?) and spirits - an entire menu's worth, actually. They do have a happy hour from 4:30 to 7:30 and you can get oysters for $2. It gets loud with the awesome music selection, especially when the crowds start rolling in, making it a great place for drinks anytime - brunch or dinner.",4.0

That type of bullshit niceness is just not welcome in this neighborhood. Take your ""I'm a nice guy who gives a shit about my customers"" act and sign up to work on a cruise ship or something. Now onto our bartender who happened to be one of the owners. The next time I come in and ask for advice on what scotch I should try. Do us all a favor on don't be so fucking nice and helpful. Do not offer me free tastes of multiple scotches so I can make an informed decision. overall just stop giving a fuck about us. I really want to know what was going through your head when you poured our drinks so generously. And whats up with the free shots of top shelf Tequila? I mean really dude free drinks?  If you have made it this far into reading this review and are sitting there thinking I am a complete fucking asshole (you are correct) and wondering what the hell my issues is.

"Tried this place for Sunday brunch. It was a bit crowded when we got there at 1:00 which is expected since that's like brunch prime time. I had no idea who the host was or where he was at the time. One of the waiting customers was able to point him out and I got his attention.  I put my name down on the list for 2 and was told it was going to be 45 minute wait. I'm a brunch veteran so I knew not to come to brunch during peak time hungry so I had the energy to wait it out. There was a counter in the front that faces out to the street with some stools. We sat there to wait. Then the waitress comes over and asks if we will like to stay there to eat. We are like hell yeah! Let's get our brunch on. So 45 minutes turned into 5. We both ordered egg dishes which were pretty good. I got the two fried eggs and he got an omelette. We got the biscuits to start which were also good. I would have preferred them to be warm though but they were nice and thick. Ordered a mimosa, standard brunch cocktail. I would come back again.",4.0

"I was up early on a Saturday morning, excited to bask in one of our first warm weekends of the year. First stop was brunch at Catfish, which my bf had read rave reviews about, though we were mostly excited about the outdoor seating.We got there right as they opened the doors and were seated immediately. Inside is a big, dark space with a full bar and outside is a small, sunny patio with 3 wooden picnic tables. Our server was quick and attentive, constantly filling up our waters, which was appreciated in the hot sun. We also had a mimosa and voodoo bloody mary, which was mixed w/ crab meat and garnished with two shrimp, celery, and an olive. The rest of the tables filled up quick. While we waited for our food, a sweet, neighborhood cat came by jumping on the tables and looking for attention. As a cat-lover, I didn't mind at all, but the servers didn't seem so pleased.Our food came out pretty quick. I got the Cajun Pulled Pork (beer braised, slow cooked, served with remoulade on brioche and a side of greens). My bf got the Chicken Fried Steak 'N Eggs (w/ garlic cheese grits & country gravy, topped with 2 eggs up). All of it was delicious and incredibly filling.

"LOVE this place! I'd been there for dinner before and also went today for brunch. Everyone who works there is super chill and nice! The food is great.

"Hi, ex-po' boy-virgin here. Catfish is a NOLA style restaurant in the Crown Heights section of BK. Real laid back southern atmosphere. Friendly service, nice bar tender.

The sandwich lacked spiciness, since it was my first po boy sandwich, is it suppose to be spicy? Was it suppose to have Cajun spice, or Louisiana hot sauce. If it did, I was underwhelm, and no spices were found.  The lettuce,and specially the beef tomatoes were too much,but the catfish fillet was filling. It was ok non the less,not what I expected.Thank you Catfish.",3.0
"Meh. Food was OK. Service was super slow. Perhaps bc I went on a Friday night and it was busy, but trying to get your food served when you're super hungry, wasn't fun. Tip: go on an empty night perhaps or when you're not in starvation mode.",3.0

The food was so mediocre. Not what I expected. The crab cakes were more breadcrumbs and mush than crab (no lump crab meat present).

"Being the southern NOLA fan that I am, Catfish had some work to do to impress me. But I'll have to say: I'm impressed.Now let's deal with the down side first: The small kitchen.

But here's the good thing: the server Guillermo (also a delight) was honest about it from the beginning, and the food still came in a reasonable time so that we barely even noticed the wait.

They were a perfect beginning.Most of us had great brunch entrees. The shrimp and grits in particular was generous and delicious, and my friend loved the delta omelette with grits. The catfish po boys: I was disappointed. First, the French bread was fresh and on par with the best of NOLA bread, but the amount of bread overwhelmed the catfish. Two of us had the catfish po boy, and the catfish consisted of one thin filet that also came out room temperature and tough to eat (should have been flaky, and I could not even cut it with a fork). Perhaps we just chose po boys on the wrong day, given the reviews, but these could be greatly improved by using a thicker and larger filet of fish, making sure they are served hot, and don't allow the fish to sit before serving (go to Mother's in NOLA if you need help). I felt like I simply had some bread with tomato and lettuce on it. The dressing on the salad was a bit spicy and the most memorable thing about my meal.

The place was cute and I liked the theme. The brunch menu was just a couple items so there isn't really a reason for me to come back.",2.0
"The first time I came here, we waited 15 minutes to be seated and 35 minutes to get our food after ordering. They basically forgot to serve us. They checked on the table next to us about 5 times and us, none.I ordered bananas foster pancakes that delightfully looked like pig slop and a drink that resembled Windex. Both were delicious.",4.0
"I absolutely loved this place....came in on a Saturday night to a busy, upbeat environment...we sat at the bar for drinks and dinner...the bartenders were courteous, quick, engaging and knowledgeable...they customized a cocktail for me which was delicious!!!! For dinner we started with the delicious croquette balls...they were like mini jambalaya balls of deliciousness ! For the main, we shared a country fried steak with a side of rice which was absolutely amazing and filling....we also had the cornbread as a side which was to die for!!! I definitely am looking forward to returning and trying some of the other dishes.",5.0
"Cons:Having been born and raised in New Orleans, I was  excited to try this Cajun restaurant. Unfortunately, nothing that I have tried so far on the menu is close to what it tastes like back at home. The po'boy is generally an easy sandwich to prepare, however the key is having the authentic ingredients (i.e. Po'boys are only served on flaky French bread back home). I also tried the shrimp and grits which was very bland. The biscuits were mediocre at best.Pros:The bright side is that there is a crawfish boil on Sunday's in the summertime, which is the real deal since it is prepared by a friendly couple from Louisiana. Also, I found the staff to be very friendly. Hopefully, with some major recipe tweaks, this place will be around for a while.",2.0
"I had been wanting to go here for a while. So when I finally got here, I was really impressed with the service, which is a big issue for me. The server was very polite and kept checking in. I ordered the Delta Omelette which was delicious. And Pimm's Cup which was good as well. Overall my experience was positive and if definitely return again.",4.0
Since this is a restaurant with in my living area I have been here a couple of times. I enjoyed the biscuits with sausage and gravy and the macaroni and cheese. Most of the time I'm going touring happy hour because I think it's a dollar or two off of all liquors. I have tried the jambalaya to go but I wasn't too satisfied with it due to the fact that it was really mushy and soupy. My boyfriend has tried the shrimp and grits and I'm not a fan of shrimp but the grits were absolutely great. The bartender that's always there when I go is very outgoing and very friendly. I definitely bring people back to try the food as well as getting drinks. They're open late which is a great thing in the area in the kitchen does not close until I think 1 AM.,5.0
"Went to Catfish on Monday night with my husband for dinner and drinks and we had a great time. We started with the Mushrooms Veronique (essentially stuffed baby bella mushrooms with a little grape in the middle) for appetizer and they were amazing! I drank French 75s, my favorite cocktail, which was a little light but still tasty. My husband had the jambalaya, which was really good and I had baked oysters, which were a special. The best oysters I've ever had. These things were damn tasty. And a side of classic collard greens. For dessert we had the cake, which was also great, you will like it if you like Amaretto or almond extract. We were lucky to have accidentally come on Bingo night, which added some fun and energy to a Monday night, we won some shots and prizes and had a good time. Overall, I don't know what any of these people with 1 star reviews are talking about. The food we had was excellent, the staff were super friendly and attentive. The prices are a bit higher than I would like for a place where I want to go three times a week, but I can't wait to go back.",5.0
"Definitely my favorite Cajun restaurant in the city. But--it couldn't possibly be my favorite Cajun restaurant in the world, could it? I mean...I lived in Louisiana for six years.

"Loiking for somewhere that served brunch a little late this Sunday and happened across Catfish.

I would say in the top 5 I've had. I could've used a bit more spice however.  The brunch menu isn't huge which is fine for me as I m extremely indecisive. I went with the Delta Omelette (crawfish, shrimp and gruyère cheese) that came with grits and greens. I included a side of andouille sausage. My omelette was good, nothing to write home about. There wasn't enough grits literally two spoonfuls  (I ended up ordering a side of grits and got and additional 4 spoonfuls for $5) but it was all tasty. I enjoyed the ambiance And the service was great. all in all a bit overpriced for the portions but I left satiated. I won't be back but I'm definitely happy I experienced it.",3.0
"I don't get to go to Crown Heights often but being in the area today me and my husband knew we wanted some kind of flavorful food. Seeing Catfish's menu had me excited for some good old cajun food. Walking into Catfish you could tell it's a popular hot spot. There aren't any booth seats and tables are VERY close to each other. Conversations can be very awkward when you find yourself eavesdropping into the next table without even realizing it. It's dimly lit in there, very loud and the bar takes up a lot of space in the middle of the dining area. I ordered crab cakes, deviled eggs, and the hubby tried the pork fried ball thingy they had. My crab cakes were actually very tasty. Deviled eggs were a bit heavy on the relish, too tangy for my tastes. My husband said his pork balls were very bland and not even hot sauce could save them.I was leaning towards shrimp and grits for my main course but the waiter described the crusted sea bass special so well I jumped at the chance of ordering it. Hubby got the half chicken. We also ordered mac and cheese, andouille sausage and cornbread on the side. My fish was very bland, the crust pointless and the dish desperately needed salt and pepper. The rice and corn sides were just as bland and flavorless. The mac and cheese was decent - full of scallions and cheese- but it never gave me a WOW moment. My hubby complained his chicken was also devoid of flavor but the sauce that covered it was tasty. Cornbread was on point though! In the end I'm pissed I went here instead of the many many trini/carribean spots on nostrand that smelled so good as I passed them by on the way to this place. But in the end I'll trade in the glitz and glamour of wait staff for some flavorful food!",2.0

The waiters are awesome, drinks were great, and the food is pretty damn good.Catfish has a $1 oyster happy hours which I'm a fan of and they're shucked very well. The crab cakes were alright but not something I would order again. The crawfish mac and cheese was pretty good, the cheese didn't have a ton of flavor and I felt like it could have used a little salt and pepper but it still was a very enjoyable dish. The corn bread is delicious and a great side. The Boudin rice balls are very good but dry without the sauce. I'm sad they no longer have the bayou burger. It was chopped up pieces of alligator formed into a patty. It had a pretty decent kick. I didn't care for the pulled pork but my friend seemed to love. The chicken fried steak is tasty and a huge portion, it's literally 2 steaks, but they're not pounded too thin and a bit tough. At the Yelp event I had the bread pudding and it was delicious but that's the only dessert I've had. My favorite part about Catfish is the hurricanes. They're a good size and pack a mean punch. At $10 they're reasonably priced but you'll end up having several so watch out. I highly recommend Catfish to everyone, it's definitely in my top 10 list.",4.0

We finally sat down and ordered the gumbo, mac n cheese, catfish over rice, and the jambalaya. The gumbo and jambalaya was overly spicy and wayyyy too strong with the herbs. I couldn't eat it. The mac n cheese had a good parmesan crust, but the rest of it was unremarkable. The catfish had a nice sear and seasoning, but a little dry with the rice.

My omelet was nicely filled with lots of cheese and seafood. The thing that brought it down was that it seemed more cooked than I'd like. I like my omelets to be soft and fluffy. This one was firm and practically chewy. The grits were really good though, you cant go wrong with those.

Is that so hard to ask?!Don't get me wrong, this place is so close to being a wonderful spot for brunches, lunches, and dinners. I like the concept of this place and the ambiance. The staff is friendly and they have one of the best bars around in terms of their liquor and beer list.But the food... I'm not a NOLA food expert, but it's gotta be better than this, right? The dishes that i've tried:- jambalaya- pulled pork sandwich- catfish sandwich- crawfish etoufee- shrimp and grits- bread pudding- many drinks (beers and whiskey/bourbons)The Shrimp and Grits is the only dish I've had more than once, but with other restaurants in the neighborhood dishing out the same food but better, it's hard for me to choose Catfish over a Mayfield.",3.0

"Loved the dollar oysters and happy hour drinks.  I would go back for the oysters.  They were delicious.    I hated the mac and cheese. There was a strange flavor that I didn't recognize or want.  Just give me mac and cheese.  It seemed as though it was trying too hard to be unique and was not successful in executing it.     It was a nice atmosphere- very laid back and comfortable after a day's work.  Unfortunately, the service was VERY slow.  I understand there was one person on the floor but there were not that many people there.",3.0

"I have passed by this place for about two years and finally decided to stop in. It was only about half an hour before close so I only had a beer. I didn't want to be that person who orders food right before close and lingers keeping the staff there all night lol However, I will say that the bartender's service was impeccable. I loved his energy. He seemed really happy to work there and was helpful and willing to answer any questions I had. He suggested income for brunch. I'm intrigued by their cocktail menu, especially the Laveaux drink! I loved the New Orleans influenced atmosphere. I plan to return for brunch and who knows, I may have to add it to my list of neighborhood spots.",5.0
"When Catfish first arrived, I was really excited to have some traditional New Orleans food in my neighborhood. I've been a handful of times now, and I'm still not impressed. They have hit and miss dishes, but mostly just misses. I just want the food to be so much better! Is that so hard to ask?!Don't get me wrong, this place is so close to being a wonderful spot for brunches, lunches, and dinners. I like the concept of this place and the ambiance. The staff is friendly and they have one of the best bars around in terms of their liquor and beer list.But the food... I'm not a NOLA food expert, but it's gotta be better than this, right? The dishes that i've tried:- jambalaya- pulled pork sandwich- catfish sandwich- crawfish etoufee- shrimp and grits- bread pudding- many drinks (beers and whiskey/bourbons)The Shrimp and Grits is the only dish I've had more than once, but with other restaurants in the neighborhood dishing out the same food but better, it's hard for me to choose Catfish over a Mayfield.",3.0
"DOLLAR OYSTERS! YES.  AND 2 BUCKS OFF DRINKS during happy hour. This place serves southern food, similar to food in New Orleans.  The foood was really good and the best part were the drinks and service.  Our server gave my friend the wrong drink, but he already had a taste of it. So they were willing to repour the drink and gave us a free beer that they gave to the wrong person.  A big plus!",4.0
"This is a REALLY cool place man. I had it bookmarked via Yelp, and the day finally arrived that I was able to visit.We opted for seats at the bar, which is always cool chopping it up w/ the Bartenders and the Host (Hey Bryan!!!). He is easy breezy!We had some small bites - cornbread which tasted like CAKE! Moist, tasteful, and just overall REALLY good! Oh, that came with the cinnamon honey butter, which was nice too...a bit on the sweet side obviously lol, but you should def try it.Crab cakes, which were ok, and the mac n cheese w/ crawfish.That was my 1st time having crawfish, it was ok...didn't really float my boat, but overall I was satisfied and full.oh we also got surprised with the bread pudding and ice cream! hmmmmm mmmmm good...I love surprises and this was a good one, and it wasn't even my bday ;-)I will return...def intrigued about the other items on the menu, not to mention they do brunch doing the week as well. They have a nice backyard, that I'd like to check out as well.",4.0

"This place is a gem.  The food was excellent, no cheesy NOLA knockoff, just simple and tasty.  Had Boudain, crab cakes, oysters, po' boy, all were top shelf.  The staff covered a small party of 20 perfectly and the Abita selection is deep.  Go here.",5.0

"I grew up in Mississippi and have family in South Louisiana. One of my frustrations with New York is the lack of quality Cajun/Creole food here. I really wanted to like Catfish, because the staff was very attentive and helpful, but I didn't.The good: The drinks were on point. The Sazerac and Ramos Gin Fizz were both excellent. The bad: The boudin balls were cooked well and were creamy, but they didn't have a strong pork and herb flavor that I expect out of boudin. My wife enjoyed her vegan jambalaya, but it had too much of a tomato flavor for me. I could be biased, because I am used to traditional jambalaya with chicken and sausage, which really drive the flavor of the dish. Kudos to the restaurant for having a vegan jambalaya, because this is not common in Louisiana  (and it should be!).The mac and cheese had some spice, but the flavor didn't win me over.The ugly: The gumbo was terrible. The roux didn't have enough complexity of flavor (requiring several dashes of hot sauce), and the trinity were completely undercooked. The celery, green peppers and onions were still crunchy, which is unacceptable when making gumbo. I had to just eat the sausage, shrimp and rice and leave 2/3 of the dish there.The search for quality Cajun/Creole food will continue elsewhere...",2.0
"It was the beginning of March, still snow on the ground when I came here. The cozy rustic interior and colored Christmas lights within this place provided a great comfort from the freezing cold. It was a week or two after visiting New Orleans, and I was already craving Cajun/Creole food, enter Catfish.The place was positively packed out! Our host, a very charismatic almost Keanu Reeves type character kept us laughing while we waited and eventually squeezed us into a very tiny spot all the way in the back of the restaurant. It wasn't really a table, more like a narrow shelf. But, we were happy to be seated and the view of the snow falling onto their back deck area was nice. Due to the fact I never learn my lesson, I decided to order the hurricane as my starter drink. Halfway through the beverage, I realized, that I was heavily buzzed. Damn you, Hurricanes! After the hurricane, I thought it would be a good idea to order the Ramos Fizz. The strangest drink I've ever had, it wasn't bad, it was just weird. Literally tasted like fluffy air. The texture was very fluffy, and the drink did not have a taste, literally felt like I was drinking air. Weird, but not entirely bad, just such an awkward consistency. We were given cornbread with the most amazing honey butter, could not stop eating it! I ordered the shrimp and grits which were absolutely excellent. Fluffy and cheesy with a generous portion of shrimp on top...excellent. The andouille sausage was great and we ate it very quickly as it was so good, I definitely did not expect it to be so spicy! The baked mac and cheese was outstanding, but I was so full that I was barely able to finish it. It was definitely creamy and flavorful, a generous portion was given. My boyfriend and I were so full and beyond satisfied with this restaurant, a real gem of Crown Heights!",5.0

"Catfish ruined my life, HERES HOW.It was a beautiful Saturday afternoon. I was with my sister and her boyfriend and we decided to have a nice brunch before we went fishing that afternoon.We walk in, it's seat yourself, so we waited ten minutes for people to leave than plopped ourselves down at a high table.Put in our order 15 minutes later.AND THEN THE WAIT BEGAN.We got out drinks, thank god, but then we were waiting for over an hour for our food. OVER AN HOUR. I got the catfish po'boy. My sister got shrimp and grits and her bf had some sort of thing that came with toast. THE POINT IS that the food was not THAT good to have to wait OVER AN HOUR for it. It's TOO expensive for such crap service. It's an entire restaurant run by gloopy guys who just DO NOT CARE. 45 minutes in my sister asked for the check so we could leave after we ate, indicating that we were clearly agitated and in need of our FOOD so we could LEAVE. Then an hour in someone came over to check on us and we said we were still waiting for our food.he WALKED AWAY FROM US and mumbled something like ""Yup...it'll be out....."" And then we waited for twenty more minutes.The grits are bland and the bloody mary's are not strong enough to make me happy I was waiting OVER AN HOUR for my damn food.And then we were 45 minutes late the rest of the day. I didn't have the time in between brunch and when we were suppose to leave for fishing to call the doctor about pain in my knee and so I wasn't able to get an appointment and what if I have to get it amputated now you know? Like I blame Catfish for that. Not to mention my sister was agitated for the rest of the day and that was not great. The emotional damage done is IRREPARABLE.

"$20 for cafeteria food I rarely go to hipsters for soul food, So I didn't expect anything spectacular. But this was awful. The catfish was terrible. Clearly they drenched it with some store bought Cajun seasoning and threw it in the microwave for 3 minutes too long... Don't let me start on the greens, they were over cooked, over sweetened, over spiced & leather-like.... I knew something was wrong when my friend tasting them proceeded to spit them out.... Disgusting. The cole slaw & pickle was good tho. I would never suggest this place to anyone I liked.",1.0

"Easily the best all-around restaurant in the neighborhood. There are a few contenders, but Catfish consistently has excellent food, drinks, atmosphere/vibe, and usually good service. You can't really miss here, no matter what.Whether you go for the bar, or food - brunch & dinner are amazing - or all of the above, it'll be surprising if you're disappointed. They offer a great selection of draft & bottled  beer, Cajun-inspired cocktails, a full serious bar to start you off, and a laid back atmosphere (but not laissez faire) where groups get together to enjoy hanging out , but it's not awkward to be here solo either.My favorite thing is the FOOD:First 2 years they were open I couldn't make it past the catfish plate & I'm not even a fan of catfish... It comes with rice, a homemade slaw & a roumelade-mayo sauce on the side - but the seasoning & prep style of everything on that plate is just so RIGHT on every level that you will crave it in your sleep.I finally strayed from the catfish plate when I went here for brunch w/ people. Had the French 75 & shrimp & grits. Not sure about my combo choice, but damn were each of those good! Draft beer selection is really a good one - it's hard to say no to a few pints in an atmosphere like Catfish. Adam (waiter) is the homie - I love his personal & authentic touch, and it's rad that he's usually working when I happen to stop in from time to time.The last & best time I went here was on a date a few weeks ago. We were just grabbing a casual bite & we both ordered some of the best food we'd eaten in months! He had a baked chicken special & I the étouffée....man.....we both basically had food orgasms that day. Blown away. Sides are also good, like the Greens - a sweeter recipe but well prepared. I don't really recommend the Mac-n-cheese, but it's only because I don't love a bechamel-type saucy cheese over the Mac (style). If I've had dessert here, I don't remember it though because the mains stood out so much.Love Catfish!",5.0
My friends and I ended up here to celebrate a Birthday. I have never eaten grits before and I was curious. I had the Delta Omelette with grits. It was DELICIOUS!!!!! I enjoyed every single bite and we had the Hurricane as drinks which was amazing as well!!! Great service Great atmosphere.....,5.0
"I've only been to Catfish once so please keep that in mind. I found the decor charming, the ambiance quite comfortable, and the service fairly exceptional given what you usually find these days (our server Jamie was well-informed, gave suggestions that seemed heartfelt and were warranted in my opinion, and helped to guide the meal rather than just taking orders). The beer list was a real treat; and although I didn't find the food to be very authentic, it was pretty good - not great or magnificent, and perhaps just barely getting into ""very good"" category but still ""very good"" nonetheless, and certainly better than you find at most chain restaurants. Oysters, Cape Cod mussels, Boudin balls, Catfish Po'boy, and crab cakes - they all checked out, and I'd order them again. Price-wise I thought it was certainly worth it, and perhaps even a bargain!",4.0
"First timer here. A couple of friends & myself were looking for a last minute, spur of the moment place to have brunch since our original location was closed. Catfish was my sister's idea. We arrived and were seated right away. It had more of a New Orleans vibe to it, from the decor to the menu. Our waiter was Jack who was very pleasant the entire time. (We were the only ones dining at the time). When it came time to order, I wasn't impressed with the menu. We didn't have much of a selection. However, Jack made some great drinks.

"Hey!  First update, EVER!So much has changed about this place.1.  They are no longer a dungeon.  The lights are fully on (!) and no seeing-eye dog/braille menus necessary.  You can actually see your beautiful, delicious food!2.  The bartenders here are actually fabulous.  Fun, fast, make a mean cocktail, has awesome hairdos.  3.  Random saw has been replaced with a piano!  Haven't heard them actually use the piano yet but it looks nice.4.  Happy hour is GREAT! It runs late (7:30 pm) and includes $1 OYSTERS!  YES!",4.0

I just moved down the street, and look forward to spending a lot of nights and weekends here!",5.0
"$20 for cafeteria food I rarely go to hipsters for soul food, So I didn't expect anything spectacular. But this was awful. The catfish was terrible. Clearly they drenched it with some store bought Cajun seasoning and threw it in the microwave for 3 minutes too long... Don't let me start on the greens, they were over cooked, over sweetened, over spiced & leather-like.... I knew something was wrong when my friend tasting them proceeded to spit them out.... Disgusting. The cole slaw & pickle was good tho. I would never suggest this place to anyone I liked.",1.0

"Easily the best all-around restaurant in the neighborhood. There are a few contenders, but Catfish consistently has excellent food, drinks, atmosphere/vibe, and usually good service.

"This place is incredible, one of the best in the neighborhood. Everything I've had from here has been delicious from the shrimp and grits to the jambalaya to the pulled pork sandwich and all the sides and desserts in between. The cocktails are a bit pricey, but that's anywhere you go in this neighborhood. Plus, why go for a cocktail when you can get a $5 IPA not even during happy hour.Came here most recently for dinner this past weekend, and it was the only place in the neighborhood that didn't have a 30 to 40 minute wait. Don't get me wrong, I love my Mayfield, Barboncino, and Glady's, but Catfish is just as good with a bit more diversity as all of those places. And as a southerner transplanted to Brooklyn, I can see that they do most of their southern/creole dishes quite well.The ambiance is great, but what's really stood out to me is the staff. I organized a surprise party for my girlfriend here a couple months back, and the staff made everything so incredibly easy and seamless for an event with around 30 people  without having to turn away other customers as other restaurants in the neighborhood so often do for its private events (likely coming with a hefty charge for that space). The brunch is good, but not as good as the happy hour or dinner in terms of price or standout tastiness to be honest. When I went most recently though, they were out of collards which seems odd since even I can always find collards at Trader Joes just a few neighborhoods away. Seems like a rather essential side to run out of for a cajun/creole/southern place, but maybe we just caught them on a bad/busy night. Can't say enough good things about their cole slaw though, which is something that too many folks do poorly. Perfect liquid/sauce ratio with tons of flavor.",5.0
I give this place 3 stars for brunch. I enjoyed the layout of the restaurant. Very hipster. The outdoor seating area is rather small. They have a huge beer selection. Brunch selection was ok.

"I went to a Catfish for brunch. I had a rather good experience. The food portions were not huge but were not super small. I ordered blackened shrimp and grits. I would have liked the shrimp to have more flavor but nothing a little hot sauce can't fix! (There is plenty of that here) I was eating and I got more full than I expected by looking at the portion. My boyfriend got two eggs, it came with grits, toast and greens. We also ordered a side of pancakes and some bacon. The pancakes were standard with maple syrup, the bacon was very thick cut, my boyfriend requested it well done, which I enjoyed with... You guessed it, hot sauce! They didn't serve alcoholic beverages until 12pm. Before that we sipped on orange juice and water. So when 12pm came I ordered a French 75 which reminded me of sparkling water with a lemon flavor(which I do like, but not as a cocktail) My boyfriend had the Hurricane which was sweet and was reported as the strongest drink on the menu. I really enjoyed the customer service. Our waiter/server was very attentive. He explained things to me so that I could make a better choice and was just overall very polite. My boyfriend said the waiter didn't even acknowledge him but I kinda didn't notice lol.I had a great experience at Catfish, it is in a cool neighborhood. Great nice simple decor, bathroom with sliding doors, nothing fancy but I like those kind of simple settings. I would certainly visit Catfish again. This place seemed to be a real hit as they were full very soon after they opened for the day. I called the day before to make reservations which they do not accept.

"Absolutely fantastic service here - really impressed by how friendly and fun the staff is, and how attentive they are to making sure you're happy and tended to!

I am a New Orleans native and the food was atrocious. I ordered a catfish poboy. Catfish on a poboy is suppose to be fried. Not blackened and spiced to the point that myself and my fiancé could not finish it. I asked an attendant for a glass of just ice to balance the overly spiced foodthe The drink was made exceptionally well but the waiter was extremely offensive and sarcastic. Both of our stomachs are not feeling good. I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone that is looking for true New Orleans cuisine or southern hospitality service.,2.0

"Catfished at Catfish! The experience here is awfully TERRIBLE. From unseasoned food, to poor service and unusually long waits for a seat yourself environment, the list of pain points of this place are extensive.

I will come back for those options though.Had the catfish poboy & home fries.

The catfish Bo boy was good I wish there were more of that secret pink sauce that was used as that added the flavor as the catfish didn't have that much seasoning..My friend had the shrimp and grits and it was just ok. The texture was a bit grainy and not enough seasoning or sauce so it was a bit flavorless. We had to use the andouille gravy to help take down the grits.

I had such an awesome time at Catfish this morning. We had to wait for a table for like 5 min but the staff was super attentive and seated us quickly. Food was incredible.

Everything about this place is intriguing, from the random decorations they use to adorn the walls, to the interesting choice of chairs, your sense of sight will be almost as stimulated as your sense of taste. I strongly suggest going here to experience delicious food and eat to your heart's desire. Treat yourself to some quality comfort food, Catfish has the good stuff!",5.0
"The wait for oysters took 30 minutes. The entrees took another 30 minutes. Service itself wasn't any special. The chicken fried steak was dry, chewy, overcooked and flavorless. How do you eat a steak if you have to spit half of it out. The bingo night made it a good atmosphere to hang out, but also masked the fact that food-wise this place is not impressive.",2.0
I love low key spots. Its simple. Ambiance is errthang!! The decor will have you looking everywhere. If you love the New Orlean Saints. This is your spot. It's a bar & they serve some great New Orleanian Eats. It smelled Ohh Soo good in this place. I tried the Blackened Shrimp & Cheese Grits. Very well prepared. No complaints except that it wasn't hot. No Biggy. I still enjoyed. I couldn't leave without sampling their Hurricane. DELICIOUS. I have to go back & hope it's a night the Saints are winning. I'm sure it's very lively.,3.0

Having been to 'naw leans' the food was just ok,fell short of tickling my taste buds!   The hurricane drink we had was excellent.

The atmosphere here gives you a really good vibe.Go for a fabulous time hanging with friends and the great booze!",4.0
"The generous serving of catfish on the catfish po boy definitely justifies its $14 price, but I wish I knew the ""side salad"" that comes with it was a clump of soggy lettuce. Skip the salad option and go for the chips. You'll get your money's worth. The customer service wasn't anything notable--nothing necessarily positive about it, but nothing negative either. I did see bartenders take shots though, which is unprofessional. My friend who frequents Catfish said she's had waiters (on more than one occasion) actually ask for a sharing of her food... which I'm glad I didn't experience. 4 stars for the po boy and the chef who made it, but those are the only things that truly deserves the rating.",4.0

"This place is a hidden gem in crown heights. I went for dinner and had the shrimp n grits, and WOW. Flavorful is an understatement. It was DELICIOUS. I also had a side of Mac n cheese which was equally tasty. The drinks are normal priced ($10-12) and are def worth the price (felt tipsy after one). The service is awesome, everyone is friendly and very accommodating. 4 stars because the food took forever even though it ended up being worth the wait! Will definitely be coming back to this place.",4.0

"Leron's Lesson: Fantastic food, superb service and interesting decor contribute to an excellent dining experience.Full Review: Had a late lunch early dinner here a short while ago and loved every moment of the experience, Catfish serves up tasty Southern fare that is sure to please. Everything about this place is intriguing, from the random decorations they use to adorn the walls, to the interesting choice of chairs, your sense of sight will be almost as stimulated as your sense of taste. I strongly suggest going here to experience delicious food and eat to your heart's desire. Treat yourself to some quality comfort food, Catfish has the good stuff!",5.0
"The wait for oysters took 30 minutes. The entrees took another 30 minutes. Service itself wasn't any special. The chicken fried steak was dry, chewy, overcooked and flavorless. How do you eat a steak if you have to spit half of it out. The bingo night made it a good atmosphere to hang out, but also masked the fact that food-wise this place is not impressive.",2.0
I love low key spots. Its simple. Ambiance is errthang!! The decor will have you looking everywhere. If you love the New Orlean Saints. This is your spot. It's a bar & they serve some great New Orleanian Eats. It smelled Ohh Soo good in this place. I tried the Blackened Shrimp & Cheese Grits. Very well prepared. No complaints except that it wasn't hot. No Biggy. I still enjoyed. I couldn't leave without sampling their Hurricane. DELICIOUS. I have to go back & hope it's a night the Saints are winning. I'm sure it's very lively.,3.0

"Paid a visit to this place thats been on my to do list for some time now. Stepped in on a saturday evening and the space wasnt crowdy. The staff are super attentive and courteous,two people brought us H20 after being seated!.   We had the gumbo and catfish meal over rice. Having been to 'naw leans' the food was just ok,fell short of tickling my taste buds!   The hurricane drink we had was excellent. It creeps up on you a few minutes giving you a really good and happy high!.     It seems that brunch and bar is quite popular here. The atmosphere here gives you a really good vibe.Go for a fabulous time hanging with friends and the great booze!",4.0
"The generous serving of catfish on the catfish po boy definitely justifies its $14 price, but I wish I knew the ""side salad"" that comes with it was a clump of soggy lettuce. Skip the salad option and go for the chips. You'll get your money's worth. The customer service wasn't anything notable--nothing necessarily positive about it, but nothing negative either. I did see bartenders take shots though, which is unprofessional. My friend who frequents Catfish said she's had waiters (on more than one occasion) actually ask for a sharing of her food... which I'm glad I didn't experience. 4 stars for the po boy and the chef who made it, but those are the only things that truly deserves the rating.",4.0
Had the shrimp and grits and it was good however it was a small portion.. The bloody Mary's are spicy. Overall service was good,4.0
What a great spot! Can't wait to go back and try other things on the menu! The half chicken was mouth watering so was the mac and cheese. And you can't beat the $1 oyster during happy hour,5.0
"This place is a hidden gem in crown heights. I went for dinner and had the shrimp n grits, and WOW. Flavorful is an understatement. It was DELICIOUS.

"I typically am ok with waiting a little bit for good food, however I arrived to Catfish around noon on Saturday Oct. 3rd and waited perhaps 10 minutes for seats. It took another hour and a half for our food to come. While the food was ok, the service was not up to par. Too long of a wait!",1.0

"Another ""Hipster"" place to stay away from.  The two star rating is for the ambience and the well thought out drinks.  It's basically a bar that decided to serve food.  I had the seafood omelet and grits, no taste whatsoever, just bland.  My wife had shrimp and grits, 4 small shrimp with less than a soup bowl of grits, no flavor.  The kid had pancakes, taste like the frozen kind and the syrup was straight up cheap generic brand.  No soul or love was put into this food.  To all the hipsters that love this food, travel somewhere to Harlem or venture to some real spots and you'll be able to tell the difference.  Just another spot where they can charge 22 dollars a plate for location and to sit on recycled furniture.",2.0
"Outstanding food, service was excellent.  My family went there for dinner and everything we got tasted very very good.  Good beer selection.  There were several things I could have ordered and been happy with.  Only thing keeping it from getting 5 stars is they were a little skimpy with the crawfish and with the shrimp in my daughter's shrimp and grits.",4.0
"I went here for mother's day I didn't get around to writing the review. The service was good and pretty fast for Mother's day. We were seated within 15 minutes and our waiter was attentive. I got the savory biscuits  with sausage gravy as a appetizer. The biscuits were okay, nothing to rave about. For my entree I had the chicken fried steak over garlic grits. I personally like my grits on the sweet side but the garlic grits were pretty good but the chicken fried steak was DELICIOUS. The part of the meal, it was so tender.

"I really wanted to like this place. The menu looks great, outdoor seating, and cute decor.... And that's as good as it gets. We got in for happy hour which offers drink deals and $1 oysters. Awesome. We order French 75s and 12 oysters and then entrees to follow. The French 75s come and they were ok, not great, but we sip and wait for the oysters. After some waiting (over 15 minutes) our server comes over to apologize, says that the oysters are being shucked. We both cook for a living and understand. Still seems long and looking around no food seems to be coming out. Still we wait. Slowly starting to see oysters come out to other tables. Still we wait. Our drinks are done and we decide to try another cocktail since the 75 was disappointing, so we order the Fizz. It's gross, no flavor just fizz. I'm not one to complain and I continue to wait. Finally a runner drops the oysters and runs off before we can ask which oysters are which. Then our server comes over and we ask, she doesn't know, flags another server who doesn't know, flags the runner who doesn't know. They bring out the 'chef' who quickly runs thru what's what but quickly runs off. The oysters are dirty. DIRTY. Grit and grime everywhere, inside and out. One even has a live WORM swimming in the shell.That was it. I'm still polite. I tell them what happened and say that I'm done, I am leaving. They offer more oysters. Gross.Then give me a check for the French 75's and the untouched Fizzes on the table. Horrible customer service. I will never return.",1.0

"Can't say enough good things about Catfish.Over the past year or so, this place has become my neighborhood staple. The servers & bartenders are such great conversationalists, the atmosphere is chill while still feeling sophisticated & cool.Happy hour goes until 7:30 (even on the weekends!) & is $2 off drinks & with seasonal oyster deals. They have house wine on tap, a ton of rotating beer, an extensive whiskey & bourbon list. Great cocktails. (I like their Pimms Cup.)The food is incredible - so flavorful. I've tried almost everything but the catfish po boy (that you can request over rice instead of on bread, if you want) is my favorite. The coleslaw is light & tangy. Cornbread, mac n cheese (with crawfish!), & the cheese stuffed mushrooms are good for sharing. Servers usually give great oyster recs when they have a wide variety. Boyfriend swears by the pulled pork sandwich. Vegan ratatouille is great for vegetarians.

The food was flavorless and had to be doused in hot sauce in order to make it edible. There was a hair in my salad and im guessing it was from our waiter who had a really thick beard.

"Sometimes the best dining experiences are the spontaneous ones. There's nothing worse than looking forward to trying out a new restaurant then being let down after being served a subpar or below average meal. On the flip side nothing is better than walking into an establishment with no expectations then having a meal that's simply exceptional. The latter was exactly what happened when I went to Catfish for brunch a few Sundays ago with my friend Dash and his wife Cristal. It's rare for them to venture to this part of town understandably because they live in Jersey, so when an invite was extended our way we gladly accepted. Dash and I had spoken vaguely about the Bed-Stuy eatery some months ago as he asked for my opinion after hearing great things about it. I wasn't too familiar with the name and really couldn't give any feedback at the time, but since I'm always up for a new food experience, I was ready to give it a shot this day.  Catfish has a very subtle exterior; a small sign displaying its name in bright neon letters is attached to the all black façade welcoming you in. On the inside the décor stays to true to its New York style with hardwood floors, exposed brick and ceiling beams that are complimented by a comfy southern feel. The walls are adorned with vintage signs, various trinkets and have tiny bottles of hot sauce on top of the seats, which adds an interesting touch. The brunch menu is short, simple and pleasantly agonizing. As I sat there trying to make a decision on meal choices, I continuously went back and forth with the fantastic food options.  I battled between the Cajun Pulled Pork, Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs and Bananas Foster Cakes, choosing to go left field with the two-egg platter with buttermilk biscuits and a side of bacon. The egg platter was pretty good, but the biscuits and bacon were out of sight. Soft and buttery, the addition of warm Andouille sausage gravy made it so much better. The bacon was brought out in thick cut strips that were delicious in all of their salty goodness. The rest of our party selected the Catfish Po' Boy, Shrimp N' Grits and Pain Perdu as their respective choices and a few empty plates later pure satisfaction could be seen on every one of our faces. Catfish was a really awesome place for an impromptu Sunday brunch and I definitely plan on going back to try the other great brunch and dinner options available. It was very ironic that my Jersey friends were the ones to put the Brooklynites on to a nearby establishment, but Dash and Cristal get the big thumbs up for bringing us to this gem.View more photos and rating at theurbanaristocrat.com",4.0

"I love this place! But being from Texas and raised by Louisiana parents I know what Cajun/Creole food is.

You get my point? The food is still great. The drinks are great. The atmosphere is great. But substituting the food choices is hard. It's a limited menu so I understand but I just don't like my grits with the country fried steak.

"Really liked the layout and atmosphere, very conducive to lingering and hanging out. The servers are friendly but both times we went the attention wasn't there. We were also given the wrong dishes.For dinner we mostly enjoyed the Venison and Mac and cheese. The jambalaya was sort of a letdown for me...flavors not strong, too watery. For brunch, didn't really like the croque monsieur. The mixed greens were  sorta drenched in this acidic vinaigrette. Wasn't a fan of the tough bread either. I should have went with their shrimp and grits which in passing had a great presentation. My husband found his french toast pretty good. Being a hangout bar, they do have a great selection of cocktails: the hurricane, Pimm's cup, milk punch were all good. The food overall is hit or miss depending on the dish but I could see myself coming back for drinks.",3.0
"Sometimes, I am confused by Cajun and Creole, but I am never confused by great grub worth traveling for. Now as the cut deepens(Bed Stuy/Crown Heights)- I walked and walked from Nostrand Ave(A,C)  to the deepest of the cut. Better to walk straight down fun Franklin Ave. and one block over to Bedford, FYI. This spot was hoppin' late afternoon on Sunday after just opening on Friday.16 beers on tap...........cool woodsy interior, and the best big vintagey bathrooms with sliding door jimmyrigged to stay closed with a piece of iron.Ate:6 lemon pepper shrimp with cajun mayo and cocktail sauce- $8Cornbread $4Gumbo File- small- $81/2 Doc's pear cider- $3The cornbread warm, rustic with honey, vanilla butter was yum. Good, chilled shrimp was a nice start. Best was the GUMBO over rice- this RICH, DEEP, DARK GUMBO was megawatt in flavor with crab, shrimp and of course Andoulle sausage.

"My girlfriend has been here once before and although she didn't like it the first time, she agreed to go again with me. It was happy hour so we immediately ordered dollar oysters. After, our server was outside goofing off with a friend or coworker. 20 minutes later, our oysters arrived with all the ice melted because it had been sitting for so long, and it arrived at the same time as our entrees.I got the gumbo. Bland with a bitter finish. I am not picky and kept trying to swallow spoonfuls but I finally gave up. Left an entire bowl of their most expensive dish. I shared the chicken with my girlfriend, which was tasty, but too sour on the finish. The cornbread was amazing and the oysters are a good deal (thus the stars), but the food didn't impress and the service did not exist. I imagine happy hour is probably a good reason to come here, but that's it. I should've listened to my girlfriend after her first visit.",2.0
"Catfish is a delicious slice of New Orleans.  I came here on Saturday after learning they were having a Mardi Gras celebration, a nice treat after being stuck indoors after the snowstorm.I came here with a few friends at about 6pm and secured one of their long tables near the entrance.  The decor is awesome, with exposed brick, candles and lots of rustic touches that give it a really relaxed ambiance.  Their drink and food menu has something for everyone.  I tried a number of different cocktails and loved them all.  The French 75 was delicious, the Gimlet was outstanding (I had to have 2 of these) and the Voodoo Blood Mary was a meal in itself.  A nice spicy bloody complete with a large stalk of celery (not enough places do this, so horray for Catfish), 2 tasty shrimp and plenty of crab meat mixed in.  Like I said - this drink is a meal!We ordered a number of food items:Cornbread with cinnamon honey butter - holy crap this is delicious.  I literally cannot stop thinking about how good this is.  The cornbread was warm and perfectly baked.  The butter added a nice spiced sweetness.  It was just so freaking good!Gumbo (large size), which turned out to be huge.  I think the smaller size would have been plenty for me, but I got overzealous and had to order the large.  I couldn't finish it, but with the help of friends we were part of the clean plate club.  This dish rich and smokey with really interesting spices that made me think I wasn't in NYC anymore.  It came with lots of shrimp and sliced sausage, both of which were outstanding, served over perfectly cooked rice.  I never had good gumbo before, so this is what I've been missing.  It's the perfect dish to warm you up on a cold day.  Will definitely be back for more!  Beef Po' Boy, which my fiance actually go on rice instead of on bread as a sandwich. This was absolutely mind-blowing!  It was plated beautifully over fluffy rice, a healthy serving of delicious cole slaw and a lovely salad.  The beef was so tasty, the kind that has been cooking for hours until it just melts in your mouth. It went so well with the rice and the salads.  I kept stealing bites of this dish because it was so good.  Sausage platter, which my friends ordered because they weren't that hungry.  It was the same sausage that came in my gumbo, so I know how good it was.  This dish would make a great starter or perfect if you just want a small dish.  It came with plenty of sliced sausage and a nice salad.  My friends were moaning contently over how delicious the sausage was.  I don't know where they get the sausage, but its life changing.  So definitely try it!Ratatouille for my vegetarian friends - but honestly its so good that even meat lovers will like it.  It's really spicy and flavorful over perfectly cooked rice.  The small was a huge portion, enough to share as a side dish with multiple people.  Collard Greens were also shared as a side and they were awesome.  I've been trying collard greens at other places with mostly disappointing results.  They always come out mushy and gross, but these were perfect.  The greens were cooked but not overdone so they still had texture.  There was definitely some heat to this dish, which was a welcome change as well as caramelized onions to balance the heat with some sweetness.  We were fighting over this dish, so make sure you order enough for everyone.  We also learned from the chef that this is a vegetarian side - we were shocked to learn they didn't use meat to make this.  Amazing!!! So overall the food was spectacular and so affordable for what you get.  The portions are perfect and the food fresh and flavorful.  I'll definitely be coming back for more. Also want to try their brunch which sounds amazing.The staff here was awesome as well.  Never took too long to get our drinks, the food came out quickly after ordering and our server was so attentive.  Strangely enough we were huge fans of the bathrooms, which were so cool with these sliding doors that have weights to make sure the doors close.  Never saw that before - so inventive!!  Just be warned that they do close on the early side (midnight of weekdays, 1am on weekends), so get here early to make sure you have enough time to eat and party it up New Orleans style!!   Plus it helps that they have a killer happy hour!",5.0
"I would give them no stars if I could but unluckily I can't, worst place the macaroni and cheese was so thick I couldn't swallow and had not flavor, the bacon in the macaroni and cheese was over cooked, the chicken fried steak taste like rubber, the environment was good to drink and have a good time but the food SUCKS!

"My husband and I were craving homemade macaroni and cheese (but didn't want to make it ourselves) and wanted to try a new place. When we entered, we were carded by the bouncer and then stood waiting for someone to greet us as they did not have a hostess. We waited an additional 30- 45 minutes for a table as we did not want to sit at the bar. The food was tasty and but not worth the wait. We decided to try mema's chicken which came with succotash and biscuits with gravy then added plain Mac n cheese (for me), Mac and cheese with bacon (for him), biscuits with jelly & honey butter, and potato salad to complete the order. The 1/2 chicken was huge and absolutely delicious. The macaroni & cheese dishes were good but nothing to rave about. The succotash was bland and didn't pair well with the chicken. The biscuits were very dense, which was disappointing because I was really excited to try them. I preferred the accompanying jelly and my husband enjoyed the honey butter. Overall, we're still on the hunt for great southern cuisine.",3.0
"Sooooo after seeing several reviews (some good..some bad) decided to come to Catfish, and see for myself. At first glance, thought it was a cozy place, mixed crowd and cool cheers/retro bar and grill. Me being a vegan in, what would I be doing in a Cajun restaurant. But, they do have a meal called ""Vegan Rataouille"" and it was damn good. Good place overall.",4.0
"Came here for a friends birthday brunch and was super happy with their food and drink selection. They have a good bloody mary, as well as this milk drink that I completely forgot the name of but you would recognize once you saw it on the menu....very similar to coquito for those of you who knows what that is. There are no unlimited mimosas or bloody marys, so drinking can get a little expensive, but they are good drinks. We all tasted each others dish, so I had a good selection of the menu and I must say all of them were really good. Good food, good drinks. It gets really crowded and it is basically self seating, so I would recommend getting there at the earlier part of brunch times (noonish?), though I am a fan of later brunch.",4.0
You live in Brooklyn. You need brunch or breakfast. Go to catfish on Bedford. You will not be disappointed in service or food. Try the shrimp and grits. Better than good. I do not eat out everyday but if I did I would be a regular at this place.,4.0
"Really liked the layout and atmosphere, very conducive to lingering and hanging out. The servers are friendly but both times we went the attention wasn't there. We were also given the wrong dishes.For dinner we mostly enjoyed the Venison and Mac and cheese. The jambalaya was sort of a letdown for me...flavors not strong, too watery. For brunch, didn't really like the croque monsieur. The mixed greens were  sorta drenched in this acidic vinaigrette. Wasn't a fan of the tough bread either. I should have went with their shrimp and grits which in passing had a great presentation. My husband found his french toast pretty good. Being a hangout bar, they do have a great selection of cocktails: the hurricane, Pimm's cup, milk punch were all good. The food overall is hit or miss depending on the dish but I could see myself coming back for drinks.",3.0
"Sometimes, I am confused by Cajun and Creole, but I am never confused by great grub worth traveling for. Now as the cut deepens(Bed Stuy/Crown Heights)- I walked and walked from Nostrand Ave(A,C)  to the deepest of the cut. Better to walk straight down fun Franklin Ave. and one block over to Bedford, FYI. This spot was hoppin' late afternoon on Sunday after just opening on Friday.16 beers on tap...........cool woodsy interior, and the best big vintagey bathrooms with sliding door jimmyrigged to stay closed with a piece of iron.Ate:6 lemon pepper shrimp with cajun mayo and cocktail sauce- $8Cornbread $4Gumbo File- small- $81/2 Doc's pear cider- $3The cornbread warm, rustic with honey, vanilla butter was yum. Good, chilled shrimp was a nice start. Best was the GUMBO over rice- this RICH, DEEP, DARK GUMBO was megawatt in flavor with crab, shrimp and of course Andoulle sausage. Sweet cider was a nice offset to the slightly spicy gumbo. The Cherries Jubilee for dessert was tempting, but I was stuffed from the gumbo a meal in itself. Very down to earth, and friendly service.

"This place proves bushwick's management style has got nothing to show besides Roberta's.The food had so much perfect flavor, right up to the line and not over. I didn't even look at the hot sauce, I forgot hot sauce existed!We had the jambalaya, perfect, overloaded with shrimp and real Cajun sausage- the chicken and celery retained a perfect texture.Accompanied sides, the crawfish Mac and cheese was inspiring as the slaw made you lift out your seat- it's the simple dishes that remind you the kitchen's awake, that they're trying the food.The cornbread did not have a real otherness, but no one was complaining.A real cocktail is something there, but I unfortunately ordered a hurricane that tasted straight from Bourbon street (not lacking in authenticity it seems but going for the un dynamic sugar punch and rum).If you're in the hood, eat Catfish's Cajun fare; the prices are right and you'll be buying back a little piece of the soul your rent stole.",5.0

We ordered: Corn bread (best dish of the night), Mac & Cheese (pretty good), the rest were subpar - Gumbo was oily and too watered down, Jambalaya was soggy and too much tomato taste, crawfish ettouffee was bland.",2.0
Shrimp and grits ! Yummy! And unlimited coffee for brunch. Great and friendly atmosphere. Try the French toast creme brûlée... Creative and delicious. Beware they charge 3 a cup for just regular Tropicana orange juice... Smh ... That's kinda a rip off but overall good experience,4.0
"I'm a sucker for EXCEPTIONAL customer service, so naturally the staff here sucked me right in. The atmosphere is very light and friendly. My very sexy date ordered the shrimp and grits with a side of Mac and cheese. I tasted it and it was great! I had a little trouble deciding between the marinated half chicken and the alligator burger, but my server convinced me to go all in and keep it Creole! I was not disappointed with my choice of the alligator burger! That burger and my hurricane drink hit the spot!!!! Will def be back just to be in the midst of the great vibe. People dancing, good food, and great service what more could I ask for?!",4.0
"I met my close friend for brunch here and I was very disappointed. We love to try new places, and this promised southern comfort food. The biscuits were very dense and thick. Not light and fluffy. The shrimp and grits were over seasoned. I got the omelet and it was also over seasoned with a dry piece of bread. The drinks were flat and the service only so-so.",2.0

"A completely underwhelming experience. The food is a miss... if you equate burnt with Cajun Cusine,  then this is the place for you, but if you are a person that expects that a piece of meat especially beef will be cooked with care then this is not the place for you. I ordered a chicken fried steak and a piece of shoe leather showed up at my table. The only redeeming quality about this place is the drinks but that can only carry you so far. The biscuits where extremely hard and far to chewing as if the dough was over worked and the neglected to put any butter in the dough while kneading taking a supposed buttermilk biscut and turning it into a iron clad dough ball. The ""french toast"" is more like egg washed burnt bread... it was a complete  miss.. we sent this food back and got shrimp and grits which had so much balckend spice that it was grainy to the touch and must have been sautéd in a dirty pan becausre you could taste the charr, and the fosters pancakes which was the best of all the things we had but was still a miss. I honestly wonder have the chefs actually been to New Orleans or any restaurant that serves decent Cajun Cusine because  this place is completely of the mark...Dinner Beware",1.0
"I've got deep Louisiana roots and am wary of most co-opters.

"Cool, hidden gem but was nothing to scream about. I heard about this place before and we decided on this one since my friend been to SoCo a few times and was tired of that place, lol. ( But I have to make my way over there soon since I want to indulge in their Mac and cheese!) Any way, parking was easy, right off the corner of Bergen and Nostrand Ave, I just walked there. It was easy to find. When I got in, it was a 35 minute but by the time my friend got there (ten minutes later) we were seated. The brunch menu is definitely simple, not too many entrees to select from but they have a plethora of drinks (whiskey, rye, the whole nine yards) to choose from on the opposite side of the menu. For our cocktails, we had the Lady Leveau (a mimosa without OJ). When the waiter brought our drinks, we thought it was a single drink that he divided in two because the glasses weren't entirely filled. So we finished that and ordered the Hurricane, which got us twisted (bingo! That's what we needed). She ordered shrimp and grits while I got the mixed salad (Le Chalet) without the blackened shrimp and blue cheese. The experience was decent but left to be desired. But the drinks were on point. We were in there for a good two and half hours, shooting the breeze and didn't realize the time was going. Not sure if I would go back but its definitely easy to get to from Bedstuy.",3.0
"Oh my, as someone who has lived and  travelled extensively throughout the South, I have to say that Catfish was a huge disappointment. I should also add that I was raised on Southern cuisine. So when my partner suggested this ""New Orleans"" like hot spot in Brooklyn, I was admittedly a bit hesitant. By the time I paid for the check, I was wishing that I had stuck with my gut reaction. One of the joys of southern cuisine is that it came from a community that didn't have much, but worked wonders with what they had. Quite honestly, Catfish is trying to cash in on this ""trendy"" market, without the true connection to the culture and know how of what makes this food great. Cons: the collard greens were HORRIBLE!!!! In the future, keep it simple with salt, pepper, and a smoked meat for flavor. I believe the chef was trying to add a different spin to a southern classic by adding lord only knows what, but seriously, the wonderful thing about collards is that they are naturally delicious.The roasted chicken was fine, but nothing to write home about.Catfish has a great location for a neighborhood spot, but do not come here for the food.Pros: the drinks were good, hence the two stars.",2.0
"This place proves bushwick's management style has got nothing to show besides Roberta's.The food had so much perfect flavor, right up to the line and not over. I didn't even look at the hot sauce, I forgot hot sauce existed!We had the jambalaya, perfect, overloaded with shrimp and real Cajun sausage- the chicken and celery retained a perfect texture.Accompanied sides, the crawfish Mac and cheese was inspiring as the slaw made you lift out your seat- it's the simple dishes that remind you the kitchen's awake, that they're trying the food.The cornbread did not have a real otherness, but no one was complaining.A real cocktail is something there, but I unfortunately ordered a hurricane that tasted straight from Bourbon street (not lacking in authenticity it seems but going for the un dynamic sugar punch and rum).If you're in the hood, eat Catfish's Cajun fare; the prices are right and you'll be buying back a little piece of the soul your rent stole.",5.0

"I lived in New Orleans and thusly can descend from that lofty perch to cast judgement on this restaurant (much like New Yorkers with bagels and Angelenos with tacos).

I really appreciate not hating my move to NYC because my cost of drinking went insane. Three Stars: Catfish po boy = good. I was really worried this would be horrible. The bread was pretty stiff, which I do not mind. The catfish itself was incredibly flavorful and delicious.  Four Stars: great selection of alcohol. Minus One Star: The food was pricey.

"Let's keep this nice and short. The place is beautifully designed. Great vibe. And the food was good. Main issue was SERVICE. It might be just a brunch issue but it took them over half an hour to bring out 2 simple orders: an omelette and pancakes. They were both great but I do not understand why we had to wait as long for it. And even if they were super busy (which I believe they weren't, since there were several empty tables around us) they could have been better about letting us know what's up rather than just letting us get Hangry.

"This place, about 9 months ago had been a valued find for me as a new resident of NYC. I mean, who knew? NOLA-esque cuisine, as flavorful as any celebrated restaurant in Louisiana. The service is consistently warm and cordial. I like this place. I've had two experiences that negate my aforementioned thoughts:1. I was thoroughly put off one evening when I was served the baked crawfish Mac & Cheese...(wait for it)...with a secret unmentioned substitute, SHRIMP...bits of SHRIMPS. When I mentioned that my crawfish actually tasted like shrimp to the waiter, he fessed up. I did not cause a scene. I told him that I like the restaurant and what they do, but I think it's an irresponsible idea to forfeit any value of transparency with what you are serving a patron who has ordered something else. I left.2. The Po Boys are tasty! The Catfish Po Boy to be exact. They've switch up breads numerous times. Three of those times including last night it was not only the 'wrong' bread, but over toasted. Consumption is part of the experience when dining out. If that experience is met with cut gums, or sore teeth because the bread was just that tough, this is an indicator that the chef needs to stick to the heritage of what makes the Po Boy so delectable; soft New Orleans-style French submarine bread.",2.0

"Wanting to go out for dinner nearby my apartment on a recent Saturday night, Catfish was right up my alley--especially given that I hadn't had Cajun food in forever.  Now I'm not incredibly well versed in Cajun food, but I've had enough to recognize when something tastes good or not.  Thus, I cannot comment on authenticity and only on how everything tasted.  For some reason they had a bouncer, even though the place is style more to be a restaurant rather than a bar.  I wanted to eat at the bar itself, and apparently that isn't the norm here because the bartender looked at me like I was from Mars.  The backyard area would've been a better option but it was raining.  Bartender did a decent enough job of serving after being a bit slow at the start.  I got the Sazerac (rye whiskey, Peychoud's bitters, absinthe rinse, sugar twist) on the bartender's recommendation between the 2 whiskey based cocktails.  It was a very good, well balanced drink, much better than I was expecting.The crawfish mac and cheese I got to start was decent, but definitely could've used more crawfish.  Still it was enjoyable with the potato chips adding a nice textural/flavor contrast.  I got the jambalaya for my main and it was everything a good jambalaya should be.  They didn't skimp on any of the ingredients and it was packed with flavor and the right amount of spice.  Not a small portion either for $15; easily enough for two meals, actually.  I took my time with it and grabbed the rest for home.  After a very reasonably priced Macallan 12 as an after dinner drink, I was happy.Good to see that the Franklin Ave food scene is developing nicely with great restaurants like this.  Especially ones that cater to everyone in the neighborhood, not just exclusively hipsters and yuppies.  Between the quality of the food/drinks and the fair pricing I will definitely be back here at some point.",4.0

"""Are you ready to rock and roll?""This was the question that our server asked us when he brought our drinks over 25 minutes after we placed the order, and 5 minutes after our food had arrived.  The drinks (bloody mary, beer, and mimosa) had been sitting at the end of the bar for about ten minutes, undelivered.  By the time they got to us, they were warm.  So, sure.  By that time, we were very ready to rock and roll.Now for the food.  Full disclosure, we are from around the part of the world this food comes from, so we expect it to have some flavor.  Unfortunately, it's pretty bland.  To the chef: you need to use some salt .  I should also mention that the catfish po boy is not fried, which is such an unusual preparation that it should be mentioned on the menu.But you know what, in the company of good friends, in a place with great service, average food can be overlooked.  Unfortunately, although we were in the company of good friends, the service was not great. In fact, it was bad. LIke weirdly, inattentively bad.I will say that we had dinner here once before and, again, while the food was still mediocre, the atmosphere was good, and the service was okay.  We also had brunch here before a couple of months ago, and ordered the omelets, which were really good.  And the service was better, too.  So, I would say if you do come here for brunch, order the omelets to be safe.",2.0
"I'll be the first to admit that I'm not exactly familiar with Louisiana cuisine. I was there once-- as a child-- and barely remember it. But I've been told by friend after friend that I simply *had* to stop by, so when a few friends and I were searching for a place to eat, we decided to go in.I'm not really a cocktail person, so their liquor list was fairly impressive to me. We were ignored for about 10 minutes-- finally our waiter came over and gave us menus and took our drink orders soon after-- and I settled down with a nice bourbon and decided on the catfish po'boy. My other friends ordered the gumbo and jambalaya. After probably close to 40 minutes, our food finally came.My po'boy was excellent. I loved the seasoned mayo and maybe it wasn't ""authentic"" that it wasn't fried, I don't know, but it wasn't super heavy. The bread was crisp but not overly so. The pickle was huge! I tasted a bit of the jambalaya and the gumbo and they were all really delicious and flavorful.4 stars for the food, flavor, service, and decor- one star off because of the amount of time we had to wait for everything to happen.",4.0
"They need a cook from Louisiana to clean this Kitchen up...the food is good overall, but there are some quick fixes that could be done to make this closer to what similar food tastes in Louisiana.",3.0
"My friend warned me. She said the place has great food, but all the Yelp reviews for the gumbo and jambalaya are awful. Well I decided I couldn't truly judge a Cajun place without trying one of the two traditional Cajun dishes on the menu, right? So I ordered something I knew I'd like in addition to the gumbo, the mussels.The mussels were large and fresh. But the broth was pretty tame. It wasn't spicy, it wasn't very flavorful, and there was too much oil (you could see it floating in droplets on the surface of the broth). The broth is also red in color- don't expect to detect any white wine or garlic like the menu description promises, pretty sure they just dumped some mild hot sauce in there (they also bring out FIVE different hot sauces to your table when your order- if the flavor is done right you don't need that nonsense). The gumbo...this isn't Cajun. I'm sorry, I've had real Cajun, I know people who cook real Cajun- just no. First of all this was more of a soup, which some gumbos can be, but it didn't taste good. Pretty sure they burnt the roux because the whole thing tasted burnt. Which confused me because if you're making a roux you don't need the file- which is included in both the name and description of the dish- because both are thickeners. They're also flavor enhancers but I'm used to one or the other being used, seeing them both was unusual. There was this dusting of dry herbs resting on the top and I'm wondering if that was the file (in the description they mentioned the gumbo is ""finished with file powder"") , in which case it also wasn't used properly. The rice was sparse, the crab undetectable, and we're pretty sure they put cumin in there. Cumin! Outrageous. I left it pretty much untouched on the table. No one mentioned anything when I didn't ask for it to be wrapped and no one asked me how it was. *shrugs* I took a bite of my friends pulled venison burger. I did not want to swallow it. It was pretty tough, and the sauce they used on it didn't compliment it at all. The service was friendly and attentive though. Our waters were refilled constantly, the waiter was almost manic about it, and considering how hot it was that was an awesome thing. We sat outside on the picnic tables because the inside didn't seem to have the AC turned on yet. When we left as the sun was going down it seemed to be kicking on which didn't make much sense to me. Maybe it was just cooling down for the night in general. The scene there is very friendly, it seems like a nice place to have a drink, and the awesome, friendly vibe makes me feel pretty bad for giving them 1 star but I couldn't recommend this place to anyone.",1.0
"I loved Catfish, it was a great place to enjoy an affordable meal and some good drinks.  I went with 2 friends and we really did it up.  First, I really like the space and the staff.  The people who work there are nice, and they give an honest assessment of the menu's strengths and weaknesses.  The outdoor space is really cute, but like all brooklyn backyards, we were foiled by mosquitoes, so we went inside.  The drinks are great and pretty reasonably priced.  We tried the mint juelp (which was delicious, but I was sad that it was not served in a juelp cup), the pimm's cup, a sazarac, and a round of voodoo bloody marys, which were tasty though super filling. For food we had catfish po-boys (really tasty and huge), shrimp and grits (the grits were perfect), the jambalaya, and a bunch of the sides, including the crawfish mac and cheese.  We also had a half dozen delicious New Zealand oysters. We had enjoyed all of it, and only paid about 50 a head (including tip) for all that food and drink.  I think it is worth the trip to Crown Heights, and I plan to be back.",4.0

"A Cajun spot on a suddenly happening section of Bedford Avenue, this restaurant offers solid Louisiana food in a long, narrow space. Prices are moderate here, but so are the portions, so an appetizer or two for the table is a good idea if you come hungry. Of the half dozen or so starters, the shrimp 'n grits was my personal favorite, although you could make an argument for the oysters. Skip the lemon pepper shrimp, which are small and without the seasoning the name would imply. Get the cornbread but have it come with entrees so it can sop up the remaining stew or gumbo.The mains are mostly Cajun classics with a couple of French-French touches. I had the gumbo filé on my first visit and found the ground sassafras leaves to be quite unlike anything I've ever tasted before. The interplay between the half-dozen or so main ingredients, from the crab to the shrimp to the sausage and vegetables gave each bite its own flavor. I appreciated that both the catfish and andouille sausage could be served as a sub-like po'boy or over rice for dinner with no extra charge. I returned to Catfish last night for drinks and found the beer, liquor and cocktail selection to be excellent but the service wanting. We sat behind a bar that appeared to have two bartenders, two barbacks and three people hanging around. The bartenders were nearly impossible to get ahold of, leading to the awkward necessity of using a barback as an intermediary. Come to think of it, our waitress on my first visit also screwed up my order, causing it to arrive 20 minutes after the rest of the dishes. They did however, comp me a beer, so no real harm there. I'll be back on a weeknight, taking advantage of the great brews, small plates and wonderful backyard space during the warm weather.",4.0

"Catfish just recently opened its doors to their customers in the Crown Heights/Prospect Heights residential area and it really bugs me that I no longer live nearby! It joins the plethora of up-and-coming restaurants in the area and offers an authentic Cajun menu along with an extensive selection of fine spirits. It's got a really comfy vibe to it and a really cute little back yard that will serve as the highlight of the restaurant when summer comes along.I've always had a thing for southern comfort food so it was natural for me to be excited about eating here. It was Brunch when we stumbled in and everyone who knows me knows that I always like to get a Bloody Mary to go along with my eggs (and everyone who knows me knows I'm obsessed with poached eggs). But this was no ordinary Bloody Mary - it was a Voodoo Bloody Mary! What in the world is that you ask? It's a supersized, super-awesome drink that comes with 3 shrimps instead of olives and a celery stick for garnish! If you ask me, I think that makes for a pretty original Bloody Mary. And a really tasty one as well!I got the regular 2 eggs, side salad and side of home fries.  I was disappointed when they told me they weren't able to make my eggs poached and in my mind it was a huge turn-off. So for those of you that like your eggs poached, don't get your hopes up too high, because you won't be finding that here folks. However, I must say that the home fries really made up for it. They were very flavorful with a hint of spice. I noticed that there was celery added to the fries and I really enjoyed the crunch of it. I'm definitely thinking of stealing that idea and making something like it at home.The real spotlight stealer though was my boyfriend's Buckwheat Pancakes. They were topped with bananas - banana fosters is the right terminology for that I believe. These 'cakes were drenched in gooey, sweet, caramel sauce that was to die for! And I couldn't believe how incredibly fluffy they were too. I was in pancake heaven. In fact, I guiltily shoved the remaining bites of the pancakes into my cheeks because I just couldn't put my fork down.

Next I got the French 75: the gin and sparkling wine play off each other so well!  I got the salad for dinner which was a a great portion of greens (much appreciated!!), pecans and a generous sprinkling of goat cheese. The blackened shrimp on top had tasty seasoning and a good amount of shrimp: five medium pieces. My friends are in good with the bartenders and some drinks on the house didn't hurt! The only reason it's not five stars is my husband said the jambalaya was mediocre. We left around 11pm and the place was getting jammed with hipsters.",4.0

For dinner I had the gumbo...I felt it lacked flavor...it was spicy as hell but that was the only taste it had...also the sauce was soupy...the sauce should have been rich and creamy...it just wasn't good...I couldn't even finish it.The place is nice, its kool, the staff was great...but the food IMO just wasn't good.",2.0

"Comfortable, unpretentious in both ambiance and service.

Our waiter was fantastic - someone in the service industry who is actually a ""people"" person and who makes you feel comfortable and welcome - imagine that! We were there at 9 on a Friday evening and had to wait a few minutes for a seat, the crowd was lively but the restaurant is spacious and well set out, so we could hear each other and didn't feel crammed.Fantastic draft beer list, as well as respectable rye, bourbon, and scotch offerings. A well-made perfect manhattan and Peak Organic Maple beer were just the thing.They were out of the venison, but the substituted pulled pork sandwich did not disappoint. Yes the sandwich was a gooey mess, but the kind of gooey mess you don't want to stop eating. Accompanying pickles, cole slaw and potato chips (zapps) were all solid.

"My review only speaks of the brunch experience,  as I have enjoyed Catfish many times,  but always on Sunday before 5pm. I haven't had a thing off the menu that I haven't enjoyed. -Savory Crepe:  delicious, especially loaded up with the spicy mustard that comes with it, and the meat has a wonderful smokey flavor. Portion size is tiny though,  might need a second dish if you are hungry. -Biscuits with And. Sausage Gravy:  My favorite. I get cravings for the sausage gravy if that tells you anything. -Chicken Sandwich with mixed greens:   It's big. I had to dissect it with a fork and knife,  but even in random forkfulls it was good. -Shrimp and Grits:  Best if you add a fried egg on top. Grits are very buttery, decent amount of shrimp.  Good go to off the brunch menu. -Bloody Mary's:  A must try. The Voodoo is like a meal with all the crab meat and jumbo shrimp on the side. The make em spicy, just the way I like and priced great during happy hour!Service is always great and friendly,  As a fellow service industry girl,  I have more patience than the run of the mill entitled asshole that expects the restaurant to revolve around them so speed doesn't concern me.",4.0
"My hubs and I met up with friends here last night for drinks. Great ambiance earlier in the night and fantastic bartenders: the Ramos Fizz is to DIE for. Seriously it is mixed so well, it has the taste of a light lemony milkshake. Next I got the French 75: the gin and sparkling wine play off each other so well!  I got the salad for dinner which was a a great portion of greens (much appreciated!!), pecans and a generous sprinkling of goat cheese. The blackened shrimp on top had tasty seasoning and a good amount of shrimp: five medium pieces. My friends are in good with the bartenders and some drinks on the house didn't hurt! The only reason it's not five stars is my husband said the jambalaya was mediocre. We left around 11pm and the place was getting jammed with hipsters.",4.0
"They were fantastic. Brian and Cameron treated me and my friends greatly. Anyone should choose this restaurant for a special moment. Dinner made with love and the bread pudding dessert to die for!

"Went back today with my boyfriend! He got the shrimp and grits and I got the jambalaya with the biscuits with sausage gravy....my boyfriend loves the biscuits.

The decor is nice, staff are friendly, and they have an interesting draft selection, 90% of which is $6 (which I appreciate). They also have cheaper can/bottle options.

"The best time to come is for happy hour. Cheap drinks, $1 oysters, it's a really good deal. But come early and leave early because as soon as the tiniest amount of a crowd arrives the service goes from ok to really bad. I've waited for over an hour for our oysters while watching order after order roll out of the kitchen to tables that got there well after us. I would've chalked it up to a simple mistake had we not also asked several times for refills on drinks, also to be forgotten, while our bartender played cards with his friends right next to us.

He just stood kind of next to us awkwardly with a notepad until we realized he was waiting for our order. We didn't know he was even there! Just standing, silently, for a solid minute, waiting for us to notice him eventually. So awkward. When we finally did, he still just stood there like a lost puppy until we started with ""uhh...time to order?"" and even then he just stared at us. It turned out to be a good time because after that same thing happening 3 more times until the bill you can't help but laugh!! The French toast was pretty good, but oh boy did that coffee taste awful! The food is only ok. I like the alligator burger, but I agree with the other reviewers that the po boy should be fried. The shrimp n grits is a shame and the ratatouille doesn't even look like it wants to be there. Can you describe ratatouille as being limp?

The gumbo was supposed to have shrimp, sausage and crab meat. I was absolutely pumped, as cajun is one of my many favorite types of foods. When I got home to eat, (I live about 3 blocks away) I opened the container to find what seemed to be rice soup in black broth with a few curlies that must've been shrimp, and some fatties that must've been sausage.

"This place has everything you want your Crown Heights spot to have: a friendly bartender named Aaron, a Cajun remoulade you can eat straight with a fork, and soulful patrons that sing along to Prince's ""I Would Die 4 U"". Oh, is that not in your normal requiremens for a 5-star neighborhood place? Well times are a changin', my friend, and these are the new standards.I came into this place knowing that the cornbread is a must. So we scoured the menu for another splittable plate... A simple solution came to mind: we're at Catfish? let's get catfish! We got the this blackened tasty thing over rice, which comes with a side green salad and cole slaw with a kick. The cajun remoulade that comes along is some serious stuff. Like the kind of stuff you can literally slather on anything and it will up its Yum points by +3.86. On the catfish? Yes. Rice? Yes. Vanilla icecream?? Weird, but probably yes. The cornbread is served with a cinnamon honey butter that gives it that nice spiced sweet/savory action.Throughout the meal we threw back a couple $7 beer & shot deals... not a bad bargain. It looked like they had some fun cocktails worth trying, but I'll save that for another trip.Catch ya later Catfish.",5.0
"Nice space, friendly service.  If you're just going for a drink - 5 stars.  If you're going to eat....  I ordered the gumbo after being told it was 'extremely authentic'.  I haven't had much gumbo in my life, but if this is truly 'authentic' I won't find myself needing to eat it again.  Pardon my ignorance - I'm not sure how 'soupy' gumbo should be?  If its meant to be soupy as in - soup - then bingo!  They're on point.   It did have a generous amount of shrimp and sausage. (The rice was kind of clumpy/chewy, but I kind of liked that.  Maybe because I always undercook my rice at home? But I digress...)  I'd be hard pressed to say I saw a piece of crab.  However, it was difficult to distinguish anything - texture or flavor wise - because of the spicy, peppered 'soup' factor.  The whole thing just tasted like black pepper broth.  Even the cornbread side - and I thought cornbread could save any meal - couldn't hold up to the brown, murky muck.  I realize I might sound like a complete philistine, but ultimately you should enjoy eating what you order, right?  This wasn' t enjoyable.  My friend ordered the roastbeef po boy and had nothing but praise, so maybe there are redeemable menu items. But for myself, the gumbo was a fail.",2.0

"I went here with high expectations for the food but was disappointed.  The food wasn't very well spiced and flavored and the portions weren't very southern.  I recognize that this is a version of Creole/Cajun but what sets this cuisine apart are the bold and memorable flavors and the hearty portions and the meal I had fell flat on both points.The drinks however, fantastic.  The cocktails were expertly crafted and delicious.  They have a good tap selection and the happy hour specials make it even better.  My recommendation would be to have a drink, maybe an appetizer here but try someplace else for dinner.",3.0
I meant to come here for brunch but after getting started on a lazy Saturday I came around 7pm. The vibe here is really relaxed and the decor is vintage Brooklyn without trying too hard like a lot of places. I ordered the shrimp and grits while my friend ordered the catfish po boy and we split the crawfish Mac n cheese. The Mac was really good and had a nice crust on it. I really enjoyed my shrimp and grits. Very creamy consistency which I'm not not super used too but it was good. I find southern spots (not soul food) goes for creamy over gritty grits. I like both apparently.My friend's po boy was very rich. It could have been a smaller serving for such richness because it almost became like overkill in flavor AND amount all at the same time. We had root beers and hurricanes. The hurricane is a show stopper and could warrant its own trip. Mixed well and packed a punch. I had room for dessert because I'm a glutton and got this sweet potato cake with like pecan and cream topping. It was good. Not the greatest dessert but it was tasty and fine.Ill be coming back for brunch soon hopefully!,4.0

Well times are a changin', my friend, and these are the new standards.I came into this place knowing that the cornbread is a must. So we scoured the menu for another splittable plate... A simple solution came to mind: we're at Catfish? let's get catfish! We got the this blackened tasty thing over rice, which comes with a side green salad and cole slaw with a kick. The cajun remoulade that comes along is some serious stuff. Like the kind of stuff you can literally slather on anything and it will up its Yum points by +3.86. On the catfish? Yes. Rice? Yes. Vanilla icecream?? Weird, but probably yes. The cornbread is served with a cinnamon honey butter that gives it that nice spiced sweet/savory action.Throughout the meal we threw back a couple $7 beer & shot deals... not a bad bargain. It looked like they had some fun cocktails worth trying, but I'll save that for another trip.Catch ya later Catfish.",5.0
"Nice space, friendly service.  If you're just going for a drink - 5 stars.  If you're going to eat....  I ordered the gumbo after being told it was 'extremely authentic'.  I haven't had much gumbo in my life, but if this is truly 'authentic' I won't find myself needing to eat it again.  Pardon my ignorance - I'm not sure how 'soupy' gumbo should be?  If its meant to be soupy as in - soup - then bingo!  They're on point.   It did have a generous amount of shrimp and sausage. (The rice was kind of clumpy/chewy, but I kind of liked that.  Maybe because I always undercook my rice at home? But I digress...)  I'd be hard pressed to say I saw a piece of crab.  However, it was difficult to distinguish anything - texture or flavor wise - because of the spicy, peppered 'soup' factor.  The whole thing just tasted like black pepper broth.  Even the cornbread side - and I thought cornbread could save any meal - couldn't hold up to the brown, murky muck.  I realize I might sound like a complete philistine, but ultimately you should enjoy eating what you order, right?  This wasn' t enjoyable.  My friend ordered the roastbeef po boy and had nothing but praise, so maybe there are redeemable menu items. But for myself, the gumbo was a fail.",2.0
"went there on fri eve for happy hour - nice ambiance, cool little patio out back, waiters & bartenders all very helpful & attentive, etc. one thing that stood out was that the place was buzzing, but not overcrowded or excessively noisy like so many other establishments would be on a fri in bk. - good spot to unwind in and have a conversationanother thing that stood out were the rather measly happy hour oysters, which was a shame as everything else was pretty cool about catfish. $1 oysters, sure, but it was the reason i ventured out there in the first place. i felt a bit underwhelmed having just spent $35 on anorexic oysters & 1 bland beercool spot, but somewhat expendable",3.0
"I went to catfish with some friends visiting from out of town and while the food was decent, it wasn't worth the wait. They took an hour to make two orders of shrimp and grits and a catfish sandwich. The crazy long wait became a conversation starter with the other tables because we all waited a minimum of an hour to get our food. The food was okay, but I've had better and they definitely will not be getting repeat business from me.",1.0
"I went here with high expectations for the food but was disappointed.  The food wasn't very well spiced and flavored and the portions weren't very southern.  I recognize that this is a version of Creole/Cajun but what sets this cuisine apart are the bold and memorable flavors and the hearty portions and the meal I had fell flat on both points.The drinks however, fantastic.  The cocktails were expertly crafted and delicious.  They have a good tap selection and the happy hour specials make it even better.  My recommendation would be to have a drink, maybe an appetizer here but try someplace else for dinner.",3.0
I meant to come here for brunch but after getting started on a lazy Saturday I came around 7pm. The vibe here is really relaxed and the decor is vintage Brooklyn without trying too hard like a lot of places. I ordered the shrimp and grits while my friend ordered the catfish po boy and we split the crawfish Mac n cheese. The Mac was really good and had a nice crust on it. I really enjoyed my shrimp and grits. Very creamy consistency which I'm not not super used too but it was good. I find southern spots (not soul food) goes for creamy over gritty grits. I like both apparently.My friend's po boy was very rich. It could have been a smaller serving for such richness because it almost became like overkill in flavor AND amount all at the same time. We had root beers and hurricanes. The hurricane is a show stopper and could warrant its own trip. Mixed well and packed a punch. I had room for dessert because I'm a glutton and got this sweet potato cake with like pecan and cream topping. It was good. Not the greatest dessert but it was tasty and fine.Ill be coming back for brunch soon hopefully!,4.0
"A friend and I visited this unique venue around 11 am and felt like having brunch here. Venue:The leather seats where in a really bad condition. It seemed like they didn't really care but in the end it has got the bar feeling rather than a restaurant ambiance. However the service/waitress was uber nice and recommended me to have the Catfish sandwich. (12 $). It was a big crispy, delicious catfish sandwich with cajun slow which was super seasoned! Loved it and will definitely come here again!",4.0

"Fun place.  Got there at 7 on a Saturday and the place was mobbed.  A table wait would have been 45 minutes but we found a seat at the bar.  The bartender was nice and the whole atmosphere of light chaos, chatter and made a great backdrop for buck oysters and cheap beer.  Tried the Grapefruit IPA based on its name alone and found myself a new favorite!  The cornbread and Mac and Cheese were excellent as well.  Just as we were leaving our noses detected an etouffee being served and it was enchanting.  Given their unassuming, cute backyard, we'll be sure to give that a go in the nicer weather.  We'll get their earlier than 7 as well to get a seat.  FYI: Steer clear of the Hurricane unless you like a very sweet drink.",4.0

They also have hurricanes, which brings me back to the streets of New Orleans.The staff is friendly, accommodating, and on a busy Saturday night told us the wait would be 30 but we got a table in 10.

"Catfish is my new local.  I've been there several times since they opened a few weeks ago.  I can't tell you how happy I am to have them as a new addition to the neighborhood.  DECOR: Really well-done with great attention to detail.  From the hand-laid tin near the entrance, to the counter-lever controlled sliding doors to the bathrooms and the televisions that can be hidden by unobtrusive panels that swing up and all but disappear when the tvs are in use, it's clear to me that the place was well-thought out and expertly executed.  Kudos to whoever decided to go with the Mrs. Meyers hand soap.  FOOD: I have had brunch there -- the grits were outstanding as was the tasso ham and the andouille sausage.  I have had dinner there -- the rattatouille is packed with flavor and served over rice.  What could have just been a de-facto vegetarian option just sings on the plate.  The Slow Cooked Beef Po' Boy is decadent and messy from the overflow of ingredients amassed on the bread.  Order this before you have a few drinks or you're likely to wear it.  But when you taste that slow-cooked beef, you might not care.  DRINKS:  The Voodoo Bloody Mary with crab meat and shrimp and topped with a wee bit of Guiness might just be the best bloody mary I've had in my life.  I tossed it back so quickly it frightened me.  But, for me, the beer program is the finest in the neighborhood and what truly sets it apart from the other restaurants in the area.  16 revolving taps of craft brew featuring some of the finest examples of styles by breweries such as Weyerbacher, Left Hand, Abita (natch), and their newest addition of Jolly Pumpkin Brewery's Maracaibo as an expansion of their sour beer selections.  I mean, sour beer on draft (as well as the classic example Monk's Sour in bottles) two blocks from my apartment?  There is nothing wrong with that last sentence.SERVICE: Service is excellent.  The bar staff is friendly without being intrusive, and are experts in connecting neighbors in conversation.  I'm more an ""eat at the bar"" kind of guy and we've only taken seats at a table a handful of times.  Each time the waitress was attentive without being overbearing.  A real chill vibe that starts with the seat yourself policy.  Each of the 3 owners make it a point to make rounds and connect with anyone willing to chat with them.  Their friendliness and passion for what they have created is a joy to experience.  Well done, guys.  Welcome to the neighborhood!  I'll try to make it in before last call tonight!",5.0
"Went here, Saturday. Before you even get your food, the music just pulls you right on in. Great mix of late 80s and early 90s tunes. Order the cornbread! Slather with cinnamon butter and enjoy. I ordered shrimp and cheese grits. Could use a few more shrimp, but overall, a tasty dish. Everybody's shrimp and grits is different, so temper your expectations my friends. It's a very basic rendition of the dish. Not a lot of sauce. But, you will enjoy. My friend had the catfish over rice. It was very tasty. Nice, laid back atmosphere. I will definitely go again.",4.0

"This spot just opened right in my neighborhood (I've never really been within easy walking distance of a bar this is so exciting), so perhaps I'm not being objective. BUT I STILL HAVE THINGS TO SAY. -Service: attentive and earnest, if a little frantic. They were friendly, welcoming, and offered to wait on us at the table as the bar was crowded (at 11 on a Friday night).-Food: We ordered oysters and the cornbread. Oysters were Delaware Bay, which I'd never tried before. Really nice, meaty and perfectly briny. (IMO). They give you fresh horseradish and a killer mignonette. Cornbread was cray dry. Meh. The honey butter, however, was fantastic. We indulged as a group in buttering each others' breads so as to lessen the embarrassment of slathering it on so excessively, and shared loud outbursts of gastronomical delight. I have high hopes for their po boys; we shall see.-Drinks. We tried the house white: can't remember what it was, but it was too sweet for my taste and served in a wine tumbler (not to nit-pick, but isn't that Whites 101?) Well anyway, they probably go through less glasses that way. The Sazerac: v. v. good would sip again. And the French 75: I had two. And I NEVER do that... lies. -Ambience: Dark, sexy, and good-smelling. A bar at the window in front which is awesome for all the future solo/surly outings I will make to people-watch and sip one of their 16 beers on tap. Another bar with big HD TVs at which I will yell obscenities every damn time the Knicks and/or Nets are losing a game. Communal tables, and little tables for special times.Check it out if you're in the neighborhood, it's bound to blow up soon.",5.0
"I must write this review immediately after leaving while in route to my local white castles..  This was maybe THE worst dining experience to date.

Service: No major complaintsDrinks: AWESOME! Food: Sh!tty to the 10th Power!  I ordered the sausage Po boy. ALL of my cabbage was the hard center inedible part of a cabbage!  I pointed it out the waitress who said ""I'm so sorry about that,  I'll let the kitchen know"". I literally only ate the little slivers of sausage and she still charged me!   She made absolutely no effort to get a new one or offer me something else on the menu. I felt so hopeless. I will never ever ever ever set foot back in this place! My suggestion- is stick to the drinks stay far away from the food.",1.0
"God I wish I lived in Brooklyn!  Came in to watch the Ravens destroy the niners. This place is perfection. First off the location is great.  Right on Bedford Ave.  The iron hook and catfish with the red neon makes this place an easy find. Parking was super easy to find.  The design choices throughout the place are right on. If you've ever spent any real time in New Orleans then you'll feel right at home. The ceiling is made of reclaimed wood.  The tables and chairs are wonderfully unpretentious.  Simple.  The bathroom is super cool with self closing doors. Service is exceptional.  Staff if courteous and knowledgable.  The menu is the real star. Not only the design of the menu (mini clip boards with thick paper legal pad style menu) but the whiskey selection and Cajun inspired cuisine. We started with big fresh shrimp cocktail and a great assortment of raw oysters. Delish!  The corn bread and cinnamon butter was life altering.  For the main course I had the gumbo which was flavored just right with nice heat.  My girl had the catfish po boy which was tasty.  Get the coleslaw too. All in all this was a great find.   Luke, one of the owners/head chef, who was very warm and friendly deserves some serious accolades. Bravo.",5.0
"I guess I missed something. If you like everything about a place but didn't like one thing, you don't give it 1 or 2 stars. That's part of the problem here on yelp. Too loud? Ask them to turn the music down. Too dark? Can I have a candle please?  Not enough seasoning?? I bet they have something to fix that. Bad service?  Ask for a manager. This place is a month old. Do you think you had all the answers after 1 month? I don't think so. I see a Very comfortable and attractive restaurant/bar that is a great addition to the neighborhood.   Everyone I have interacted with has been amazingly nice, even the patrons. I will be back...

"Catfish is a very cute bar in an area of Bedford in dire need of restaurants and bars.  My friend and I arrived around 10:15 on Saturday. It was crowded, but not so crowded that we couldn't find seats. I ordered the gumbo and some cornbread. The gumbo was delish! Big pieces if andouille, shrimp, nice smokey flavor. The cornbread was moist and the cinnamon butter was almost frosting sweet, but good in moderation.I would give Catfish 5 stars, but the vibe was kind of weird. Given the location, I wasn't quite expecting it to be so...""gentrified"" or so young. Lots of very loud, very college-aged kids. I don't think there are many colleges in the area. Not sure where they were all coming from.Overall the menu was small, but tasty. I would go back for dinner or like happy hour time and see if the vibe is any different.",4.0
"Would've gotten 5 stars if your waitress actually gave us the attention we deserved. She was very cold and uninterested. If you hate your job just be sure not to show it. But besides that, the night i went the two meals and my dad and I wanted they didn't have. Which the waitress failed to mention until we ordered. Had to quickly find a plan b. I got the half chicken w a biscuit greens and baked Mac and cheese. Amazing impeccable flavor. Mesas ones very well the food was hot and delicious. Great food. Terrible service",4.0
"Definitely a nice addition to the neighborhood when it comes to a bar/restaurant combo! Covers both aspects totally successfully- amazing beer and whiskey section, plus tasty cocktails (including the classic mint julep) and great options for dinner or for sharing some plates.And it's decor is totally rustic and awesome. They have an outdoor area in the back, the wall is lined with hot sauce bottles, ceiling has window panes and doors, lots of exposed brick and old woodwork- totally my kind of classy. The Cornbread is a must try with the cinnamon honey butter, though wish the portion was a bigger for $5- or maybe it's just that good that I was wishing I had more?Also a must are the Oven Roasted Sweet Potatoes- cooked in spiced liqueur, orange flavoring, and brown butter. Order 2 servings for the table.Homemade Cajun Slaw is also pretty good, love the bigger cabbage pieces where it gives it some crisp.The Blackened Catfish Po' Boy and the Jambalaya were also hits at our table. The Po' Boy had lots of sauce so got a bit messy (so maybe don't order it on a first date), but is totally worth the extra napkins.Think the only thing we were all iffy on was the mussels- seemed to be cooked separately from the sauce, so they were a bit bland. We let them soak in the creole seasoned sauce and that helped somewhat. Also wished they served them with some bread so we could soak up the sauce (which was good!).Oh, and the drinks are all completely reasonably priced, cocktails being $7-12 and the beers we had were all $6.",4.0
"Catfish is my new local.  I've been there several times since they opened a few weeks ago.  I can't tell you how happy I am to have them as a new addition to the neighborhood.  DECOR: Really well-done with great attention to detail.  From the hand-laid tin near the entrance, to the counter-lever controlled sliding doors to the bathrooms and the televisions that can be hidden by unobtrusive panels that swing up and all but disappear when the tvs are in use, it's clear to me that the place was well-thought out and expertly executed.  Kudos to whoever decided to go with the Mrs. Meyers hand soap.  FOOD: I have had brunch there -- the grits were outstanding as was the tasso ham and the andouille sausage.  I have had dinner there -- the rattatouille is packed with flavor and served over rice.  What could have just been a de-facto vegetarian option just sings on the plate.  The Slow Cooked Beef Po' Boy is decadent and messy from the overflow of ingredients amassed on the bread.  Order this before you have a few drinks or you're likely to wear it.  But when you taste that slow-cooked beef, you might not care.  DRINKS:  The Voodoo Bloody Mary with crab meat and shrimp and topped with a wee bit of Guiness might just be the best bloody mary I've had in my life.  I tossed it back so quickly it frightened me.  But, for me, the beer program is the finest in the neighborhood and what truly sets it apart from the other restaurants in the area.  16 revolving taps of craft brew featuring some of the finest examples of styles by breweries such as Weyerbacher, Left Hand, Abita (natch), and their newest addition of Jolly Pumpkin Brewery's Maracaibo as an expansion of their sour beer selections.  I mean, sour beer on draft (as well as the classic example Monk's Sour in bottles) two blocks from my apartment?  There is nothing wrong with that last sentence.SERVICE: Service is excellent.  The bar staff is friendly without being intrusive, and are experts in connecting neighbors in conversation.  I'm more an ""eat at the bar"" kind of guy and we've only taken seats at a table a handful of times.  Each time the waitress was attentive without being overbearing.  A real chill vibe that starts with the seat yourself policy.  Each of the 3 owners make it a point to make rounds and connect with anyone willing to chat with them.  Their friendliness and passion for what they have created is a joy to experience.  Well done, guys.  Welcome to the neighborhood!  I'll try to make it in before last call tonight!",5.0
"Went here, Saturday. Before you even get your food, the music just pulls you right on in. Great mix of late 80s and early 90s tunes. Order the cornbread! Slather with cinnamon butter and enjoy. I ordered shrimp and cheese grits. Could use a few more shrimp, but overall, a tasty dish. Everybody's shrimp and grits is different, so temper your expectations my friends. It's a very basic rendition of the dish. Not a lot of sauce. But, you will enjoy. My friend had the catfish over rice. It was very tasty. Nice, laid back atmosphere. I will definitely go again.",4.0

"This spot just opened right in my neighborhood (I've never really been within easy walking distance of a bar this is so exciting), so perhaps I'm not being objective. BUT I STILL HAVE THINGS TO SAY. -Service: attentive and earnest, if a little frantic. They were friendly, welcoming, and offered to wait on us at the table as the bar was crowded (at 11 on a Friday night).-Food: We ordered oysters and the cornbread. Oysters were Delaware Bay, which I'd never tried before. Really nice, meaty and perfectly briny. (IMO). They give you fresh horseradish and a killer mignonette. Cornbread was cray dry. Meh. The honey butter, however, was fantastic. We indulged as a group in buttering each others' breads so as to lessen the embarrassment of slathering it on so excessively, and shared loud outbursts of gastronomical delight. I have high hopes for their po boys; we shall see.-Drinks. We tried the house white: can't remember what it was, but it was too sweet for my taste and served in a wine tumbler (not to nit-pick, but isn't that Whites 101?) Well anyway, they probably go through less glasses that way. The Sazerac: v. v. good would sip again. And the French 75: I had two. And I NEVER do that... lies. -Ambience: Dark, sexy, and good-smelling. A bar at the window in front which is awesome for all the future solo/surly outings I will make to people-watch and sip one of their 16 beers on tap. Another bar with big HD TVs at which I will yell obscenities every damn time the Knicks and/or Nets are losing a game. Communal tables, and little tables for special times.Check it out if you're in the neighborhood, it's bound to blow up soon.",5.0
"I must write this review immediately after leaving while in route to my local white castles..  This was maybe THE worst dining experience to date. First what is catfish?  A restaurant?  A bar?  I felt very conflicted walking in.Second: it's too damn dark in there!  I couldn't read one friggin thing on the menu. Service: No major complaintsDrinks: AWESOME! Food: Sh!tty to the 10th Power!  I ordered the sausage Po boy. ALL of my cabbage was the hard center inedible part of a cabbage!  I pointed it out the waitress who said ""I'm so sorry about that,  I'll let the kitchen know"". I literally only ate the little slivers of sausage and she still charged me!   She made absolutely no effort to get a new one or offer me something else on the menu. I felt so hopeless. I will never ever ever ever set foot back in this place! My suggestion- is stick to the drinks stay far away from the food.",1.0
"God I wish I lived in Brooklyn!  Came in to watch the Ravens destroy the niners. This place is perfection. First off the location is great.  Right on Bedford Ave.  The iron hook and catfish with the red neon makes this place an easy find. Parking was super easy to find.  The design choices throughout the place are right on. If you've ever spent any real time in New Orleans then you'll feel right at home. The ceiling is made of reclaimed wood.  The tables and chairs are wonderfully unpretentious.  Simple.  The bathroom is super cool with self closing doors. Service is exceptional.  Staff if courteous and knowledgable.  The menu is the real star. Not only the design of the menu (mini clip boards with thick paper legal pad style menu) but the whiskey selection and Cajun inspired cuisine. We started with big fresh shrimp cocktail and a great assortment of raw oysters. Delish!  The corn bread and cinnamon butter was life altering.  For the main course I had the gumbo which was flavored just right with nice heat.  My girl had the catfish po boy which was tasty.  Get the coleslaw too. All in all this was a great find.   Luke, one of the owners/head chef, who was very warm and friendly deserves some serious accolades. Bravo.",5.0
"I guess I missed something. If you like everything about a place but didn't like one thing, you don't give it 1 or 2 stars. That's part of the problem here on yelp. Too loud? Ask them to turn the music down. Too dark? Can I have a candle please?  Not enough seasoning?? I bet they have something to fix that. Bad service?  Ask for a manager. This place is a month old. Do you think you had all the answers after 1 month? I don't think so. I see a Very comfortable and attractive restaurant/bar that is a great addition to the neighborhood.   Everyone I have interacted with has been amazingly nice, even the patrons. I will be back...

"This place just opened January 4th. I will be a regular here, and I expect my neighbors will as well. The interior is gorgeous, exposed brick and wood beams.  I had the braised beef sandwich which  I highly recommend. They called it a roast beef po boy but it's a falling apart piece of braised beef.The staff was really nice and despite the fact that it was full to capacity did a great job and I did not wait long to get their service and my food came out very quickly. They were a friendly and awesome bunch. There are some booth like tables, more booth on one side, chairs on the other,  a bar, and some regular tables and a thin bar along the well. The backyard, when it opens, will be awesome. I'm sure they will be full to capacity all the time. There were 3 TVs at the bar but no volume. Thank you! it was football last night. I did not watch. They have 16 taps and I hope this will turn into an excellent beer bar. I  had a 21st Amendment IPA. I am a fan of 21A.  I also had a Smuttynose Robust Porter that was very good. They had Avery White Rascal, which is a tastey Belgian Wit style beer if you like that kind of beer. 3 taps from Abita. I do not think New Orleans is known as a great beer place, but I will try them before I make judgment on it.  Maybe they will focus on California brewers next, or Colorado.  I'm not really in to the N.O. theme for beer, can you tell?They had a cider on tap. Then a bunch of North East and NY brewers, Ommegong Rare Vos (apparently distributors in Crown Heights require  you to carry that one as everyone on Franklin Ave does). Sixpoint Resin, a good local choice, Kelso IPA, and Keegan Milk Stout. I would like to see one or two rich black beers on the menu, for the winter, maybe a black lager and something richer, like ""There will be Black"" from Brooklyn Brewery, or the Left Hand seasonal black beer.I hope their beer selection improves even more.

"The wife and I just got back from an early Saturday night dinner here (gotta have time to rest up before the partying starts).  I really want to give this place 3.5 starts but that's Yelp for ya.So, we had the lemon pepper poached shrimp which was just great.  The shrimp tasted super fresh and the sauces served were very tasty.  The cornbread, as many others have said, is good but not the best I've ever had.For our main, we got the blackened catfish po'boy over rice.  Sad to say I was a bit disappointed.  I've been to New Orleans and am from the south, and I have to say, this ain't it.  Didn't really taste the blackened seasoning that much, and so had to lather it with the sauce that came with it (which was yummy).  The fish was also dry and overcooked.  After having such fresh shrimp, it was just a huge letdown.  Atmosphere.  Great.  In true BK fashion, people are chill, crowd is diverse, and there's even a back yard, although it was full (sad face).  Our server was super friendly and attentive, so no complaints there.We'll be back, because it's a cool neighborhood spot, and we really want to try the bread pudding and the shrimp and grits.",3.0

"This could be a great place to come just for drinks, not too good for dining.The jambalaya was pretty bland. The andouille they used was actually really good, and the bites of that were the only thing worth eating. The shrimp was covered in seasoning but still flavourless. It tasted like they used fish stock, when chicken stock works much, much better in a jambalaya. My friend and I had to cover it with Crystal just to get some flavour out of it. I'll offer some advice: add a lot more seasoning, use bacon fat, go heavy on the Worcester sauce, and make sure it has some heat.The crab cakes were flavourless, dry hockey pucks. Just straight up not good.The server noticed the we didn't like the crab cakes so a dude came over -- I'm not sure if he is an owner or the chef -- and said he wanted to give us his bread pudding, he was very proud of, for free. That was the best part of the meal. The pudding was great, especially with a giant scoop of vanilla ice cream on it, drizzled with a bourbon caramel sauce. It was very cool of them to do that.The staff were great, the place is comfortable, we were able to sit right when walking in (even though it was busy and Friday night), and the drinks were good, so I would like to go back to try their other food, but I'm afraid that it would be just as boring as the jambalaya or possibly a full on disaster, like the crab cakes.",3.0

"My favorite spot in the neighborhood!I have been here about 5 or 6 times. The only other place I've been to that much is Franklin Park/Dutch Boy, and that is only because Franklin Park is a standard, low-cost option that is close to the train.Catfish is great for dates, a meal with friends, or birthdays. I just celebrated my birthday here last weekend and they were super accommodating. Everyone enjoyed their dish, probably more than I did! But that is because I finally decided to try the Bayou burger, which is alligator meat. Both my brother and I agreed that the burger was good quality, but alligator just isn't our thing. Too fishy/gamey, or whatever. My roommate said the oysters were good, too. I love their cocktails and their pulled venison. I don't like rum cocktails, but the Hurricane is PERFECT!I like the mood, the set-up, and the lighting. Although a note to regular folks, it's probably ""dark"" by your standards. I like dark lighting though.My *only* problem is that *sometimes* the wait staff isn't on the ball. My waiter once seemed as though he was high. Mixed up the orders, forgot what the specials were, etc. But he was very charming and fixed everything very quickly. The service is great, just that one time it was a bit off.I'll be back again and again! :)",5.0
"I came again during the evening for drinks.  I didn't order any food this time but the change in atmosphere, service, and attitude was very apparent.  They were telling the truth, brunch is a weird time for the place and staff.It was crowded, every available seat was taken.  My buddy and I were lucky since a group at the bar were leaving.  There's some open space in the back where they could have been additional seating but it seemed there was some live music or something as indicated by an unattended mic stand.  Not exactly the place to stand around although there were a few who stayed very briefly.The bartender, Brian, was the man as usual.  We didn't have anything fancy, just beer, whiskey, although we did manage to get a pickle back.  They use sweet pickle juice so I wasn't too big of a fan.  They don't do it often, apparently.  Saw a bartender go down in the kitchen to grab the juice.  Brian did concoct something special for a pair of guests after his seltzer spray at a regular missed.Overall, it was a very jovial evening.  What really struck me was the music choice.  It was a mix of blues and other stuff that was reminiscent of Southern/Cajun culture.  Brass, big band, slide guitar.Got a better look at the whiskeys in stock.  They have a decent selection.  Your basic higher end scotches but also what seemed to be a good bourbon collection.  Had a Widow Jane on the rocks, a nice pour too.  Don't know if they do the charge extra for ice (slightly larger pour) because the bill didn't come out to be much.",5.0

"Came out here last night for the first time, having heard a lot of good things. The space itself is expansive and thoughtfully decorated.

The grits were the stronger of the dishes: creamy, garlicky, and slightly cheesy. The shrimp were perfectly cooked, slightly blackened and juicy. The grits were bathed in a reddish spicy oil, which I wasn't exactly a fan of. I've preferred the simpler, creamier grits at Marietta and Scratchbread, where the texture and subtle flavors of the dish are able to come through, whereas these grits are changed by the spicy oil. The roasted chicken was a slight disappointment. The dish wasn't bad, but it came out lukewarm, which didn't pair well with the fact that the chicken had a really strong, almost gamey flavor. I wondered when it had been cooked, or perhaps how long the chicken had been sitting around before it had been cooked. The biscuits were nice and the green beans were excellent, although they were more of a garnish than a side dish. At a little under $40, including beers, the dinner wasn't bad. I just expected a little more in a neighborhood with a lot of rising stars.",3.0
"The pluses: Cool vibe, great draft beer selection. I loved the shrimp and grits appetizer, and the gumbo was super tasty as well. (Crab cakes so-so.)The place has definite potential, but they've got a few issues to work out. On the night I visited it was really hard to track down somebody to order from. I wanted to try a cocktail after finishing my beer, but it took too long to get a menu and we'd literally finished our entrees at that point.

Really nice staff. NO catfish unless you want it in a sandwich. Crabcakes - DELIIIICCIOOOUUSSS. They also had baked macaroni which had...bbq chips on top....and it was actually GOOD. VERY GOOD.,3.0
"Stopped in after a long day of apartment viewings and was pleasantly surprised by the friendly staff, and then the large portions. I ordered the catfish po boy and it was delicious! I had to take most of it home due to the healthy side salad that accompanied the meal. The drinks my friends and I ordered were good, and not to mention strong. Wouldn't advise large groups to come here as it is a pretty small venue.",4.0
"For all the hype, we expected more. Meh. Great service. Catfish sandwich was really good although needed more seasoning. The crabcake special was a sad gray looking pattie of scraps that had seasoning that seemed to clash with its sauce. Grits were unevenly cooked and favored. Nice vibe and music.",3.0
"My favorite spot in the neighborhood!I have been here about 5 or 6 times. The only other place I've been to that much is Franklin Park/Dutch Boy, and that is only because Franklin Park is a standard, low-cost option that is close to the train.Catfish is great for dates, a meal with friends, or birthdays. I just celebrated my birthday here last weekend and they were super accommodating. Everyone enjoyed their dish, probably more than I did! But that is because I finally decided to try the Bayou burger, which is alligator meat. Both my brother and I agreed that the burger was good quality, but alligator just isn't our thing. Too fishy/gamey, or whatever. My roommate said the oysters were good, too. I love their cocktails and their pulled venison. I don't like rum cocktails, but the Hurricane is PERFECT!I like the mood, the set-up, and the lighting. Although a note to regular folks, it's probably ""dark"" by your standards. I like dark lighting though.My *only* problem is that *sometimes* the wait staff isn't on the ball. My waiter once seemed as though he was high. Mixed up the orders, forgot what the specials were, etc. But he was very charming and fixed everything very quickly. The service is great, just that one time it was a bit off.I'll be back again and again! :)",5.0
"I came again during the evening for drinks.  I didn't order any food this time but the change in atmosphere, service, and attitude was very apparent.  They were telling the truth, brunch is a weird time for the place and staff.It was crowded, every available seat was taken.  My buddy and I were lucky since a group at the bar were leaving.  There's some open space in the back where they could have been additional seating but it seemed there was some live music or something as indicated by an unattended mic stand.  Not exactly the place to stand around although there were a few who stayed very briefly.The bartender, Brian, was the man as usual.  We didn't have anything fancy, just beer, whiskey, although we did manage to get a pickle back.  They use sweet pickle juice so I wasn't too big of a fan.  They don't do it often, apparently.  Saw a bartender go down in the kitchen to grab the juice.  Brian did concoct something special for a pair of guests after his seltzer spray at a regular missed.Overall, it was a very jovial evening.  What really struck me was the music choice.  It was a mix of blues and other stuff that was reminiscent of Southern/Cajun culture.  Brass, big band, slide guitar.Got a better look at the whiskeys in stock.  They have a decent selection.  Your basic higher end scotches but also what seemed to be a good bourbon collection.  Had a Widow Jane on the rocks, a nice pour too.  Don't know if they do the charge extra for ice (slightly larger pour) because the bill didn't come out to be much.",5.0

"Went there for weekday brunch. I had the savory crepe and DH had the catfish po boy. The food was tasty. My only gripe, fry that catfish up to make it a real po boy! And offer up oysters at brunch. I'm a hater because I saw another customer, probably a VIP with some at the bar.",4.0

I really, really want to give Catfish 4 stars: It's local, it has a cozy atmosphere, the concept is incredible, and they have a great beer list. I'm afraid, however, the table service and food is just shy of bumping it into the ""Yey, I'm a fan"" level. Let me explain...I typically sit at the bar, which is great. The bar staff are typically very attentive, friendly and even humorous. I've noticed that when it comes to sitting at a table, however, that Catfish seems to always be understaffed. Last time I went with my husband, we joined a table of friends and were pretty quickly offered drinks. The server then disappeared, and we were super delayed in receiving drinks and having the opportunity to put in our food order. All the while, the server was running around like a headless chicken because she was the only one working half of the restaurant. Poor thing. We had hoped to wine and dine for about an hour (that is a reasonable expectation, no?) so that we could be out before their evening event. We were told about 3 times that our food would be ""right out"", though after a full hour of having only one drink and still not being served our order (plus, the tables of everyone else in the restaurant had been cleared of plates), we had to request that our order be changed to take-away. I was so incredibly disappointed.I'd like to be clear that I do not base my reviews on only one experience. Even the best establishments have off-nights. Assuming that the difficulty with service is not an everyday event (I hope it isn't, for their sake), I would still give Catfish 3 stars based on the taste of their food. I've tried almost everything on the menu, and have even opted to go to Catfish whilst fantasizing about oh-so-deeply-comforting Southern cuisine. Although Catfish sometimes hits the spot, I'm consistently annoyed that their dishes are over-seasoned to the point of losing the unique flavors of the meats served. My favorite dish to get is shrimp and grits. It reminds me of my Mississippian friend's cooking. It used to be the best value on the menu, and may also be the most consistent. My husband tends to get either the gumbo or the jambalaya, and to this day, we can't tell a difference. One is on rice, and the other is not, but they are seasoned so similarly, you could order either and expect pretty much the same thing. I love the catfish po' boy, and the fact that you can order the catfish on rice rather than between bread (you can do this with any or most of the po' boys, depending on your cravings). Unfortunately, the catfish tends to be heavily seasoned, though there is luckily no other fish on the menu to confuse it with. The last dish on which I'll comment, for now, is the venison. Honestly, we couldn't tell if it is venison or pork, again, because it is seasoning was so strong. I would love for Catfish to make some changes around this issue -- to compliment the meat with their seasoning. If they could do that, it would be top-notch. For now, it's just A-OK.",3.0

"Late lunch/early dinner with my handsome date on a Sunday. Catfish was pretty full when we arrived but we were still able to seat ourselves as the sign at the entrance instructs. Menu is limited but we made great selections. Pigged out on sausage and shrimp jambalaya, gumbo and a catfish Po Boy. Shrimps in the jambalaya were definitely jumbo and the whole dish was altogether yummy! Rice was saucy, not soupy and full of sausage, diced onions, celery and tomatoes. The gumbo was really dark and full of shrimp and sausage but a little more loose than authentic Louisiana gumbo should be. Catfish Po Boy was close to perfect. Blackened catfish with romaine lettuce, tomato and remoulade sauce on WAAAAAY too tough, toasted Italian bread. Our Hurricane and Madame Laveau cocktails were both perfectly tart, tangy and boozy. Atmosphere is very down home and comfortable with a bit of a hipster twang. There was a cool BINGO game going on at the front of the restaurant. Music bounced back and forth from The Motown Sound to early 80's soft rock. There's outdoor seating in the back and a full bar. Catfish MUST add a shrimp Po Boy to their menu. That small change along with a pinch more salt in each dish would make this place 5 star. We didn't have any room for dessert. Next time.",4.0
"I love this place.  I also love that it's walking distance (stumbling?) from my apartment.  It gets crowded on the later side, so if you head over for HH or early dinner, no trouble w tables.  I'm obsessed w the le chalet salad w grilled shrimp, and I get it basically every time we go, along with one of the sides - cornbread with cinnamon butter = amazing.  Good selection of drafts, and good cocktails as well.  Haven't tried the desserts yet, but all the oysters, main dishes + sides we've had were delicious.",5.0
"I tried Catfish a month or so ago for the first (and last) time. I had walked by it several times and it looked intriguing. After suffering from a serious craving for jambalaya for a couple of days, I walked over with my husband for a very early 5:30 pm dinner as he had to catch an international flight later that Thursday evening.Let me reiterate: it was 5:30 pm. On a Thursday.After drinking some pretty good cocktails, I placed my order only to be informed by our indifferent waitress (who spent about 10 minutes texting on her phone before she sauntered over to our table -- I'll call her Roseanne) that ""we're out of jambalaya.""Wait. What? It's a cajun restaurant. It's a Thursday. It's 5:30 pm. How is that even possible?Shrug. ""It happens.""As I began sadly looking at the menu for something else my husband ordered shrimp creole.Yeah. No. ""We're out of shrimp creole."" Holy creoley are you serious Roseanne? I was ticked enough about the jambalaya but her attitude really kicked that annoyance up a notch or two. Her facial expression and body language said: ""Tough. I don't care. I'm not apologizing. Order something else.""It was too late to go anywhere else if my husband was to make his flight. Still dreaming of jambalaya, I decided to just have an appetizer of  'steamed mussels in a white wine and garlic broth'.  It came soon enough, along with my husband's appetizer plate of blackened shrimp and grits. The young guy who delivered it to the table had on a chef's apron so I asked him how a cajun restaurant kitchen could run out of jambalaya and shrimp creole, not mentioning the time of day or day of the week. With a big cheery grin, he said, ""It happens sometimes. We make it up in big batches and sometimes we run out."" Wait. What? If they make big batches and they run out before the dinner crowd arrives, does that mean they make it the day before? At the beginning of the week? I didn't even ask. I started on the mussels ""in white wine and garlic broth."" The menu writer should have written ""some kind of a broth with a big healthy dose of sriracha"" in the description. Sriracha. Or something akin to it. I like a good deal of hotness but the flavor profile was terrible. And I was wondering how long those mussels had been sitting in the kitchen waiting to be warmed up in that sad, sad broth.I couldn't even.My husband had a few mouthfuls of the seriously bland shrimp and grits. I pushed the plate of mussels to the side.After finally getting Roseanne's attention (texting, phone) I said that the menu described the mussels as being in a white wine and garlic broth. ""Yes that's right. And we add some cajun spices,"" said Roseanne with a sneer. I told her it wasn't what I wanted and she asked if I would like something else.""Yes I would like some jambalaya."" Roseanne opened her mouth to retort and thought better about it before spinning on her heel and marching off. Exactly.We paid our bill, left a very good tip (18%) for lousy service and left. I thought about calling the manager/owner the next day but then . . . I didn't.I give it two stars for location, drinks and decor, which is sparse but nice.I usually am willing to give a place a second chance -- not this one. First impressions are so important. Unfortunately for Catfish, they just don't care. And neither do I.",2.0

Ate here last night with a good friend. Trying to step out my comfort zone and try foods from different places. The food was pretty good. I had the cat fish po'boy which was tasty but my only complaint was the bread was a bit hard. But that Craw fish Mac and cheese is a must try! It's crispy on the outside..cheesy on the inside. I never even had crawfish before but after this dish I was a believer. I would definitely come back again. Cool vibe and nice ambiance. The wait staff were pretty attentive too and they allow you to choose your seating when you come in which is a nice little twist to your typical sit down restaurant.,4.0
"If you're a fan of Bloody Mary's then you have come to right place. The Voodoo Bloody Mary at Catfish is to die for!

"Met up with three girlfriends for Sunday brunch.  There was an hour wait for a table so we decided to just sit at the bar.  Three hours later we left a little tipsy and very full.  Two of us had the catfish po'boy and oh my!  That sandwich was EVERYTHING!  I am already craving another one. The catfish was perfectly seasoned, the baguette nicely toasted and the mayo sauce was a great accompaniment.  The portion size was enormous, a very hearty portion.  Another friend had the Fisherman's platter and said it was good, nothing great.  The drinks were strong but well balanced, the four of us had the Hurricane.  The atmosphere was very welcoming, the bartender and waiters were all friendly and never made us feel rushed.  Will be going there again. . . maybe next week.",4.0
"Late lunch/early dinner with my handsome date on a Sunday. Catfish was pretty full when we arrived but we were still able to seat ourselves as the sign at the entrance instructs. Menu is limited but we made great selections. Pigged out on sausage and shrimp jambalaya, gumbo and a catfish Po Boy. Shrimps in the jambalaya were definitely jumbo and the whole dish was altogether yummy! Rice was saucy, not soupy and full of sausage, diced onions, celery and tomatoes. The gumbo was really dark and full of shrimp and sausage but a little more loose than authentic Louisiana gumbo should be. Catfish Po Boy was close to perfect. Blackened catfish with romaine lettuce, tomato and remoulade sauce on WAAAAAY too tough, toasted Italian bread. Our Hurricane and Madame Laveau cocktails were both perfectly tart, tangy and boozy. Atmosphere is very down home and comfortable with a bit of a hipster twang. There was a cool BINGO game going on at the front of the restaurant. Music bounced back and forth from The Motown Sound to early 80's soft rock. There's outdoor seating in the back and a full bar. Catfish MUST add a shrimp Po Boy to their menu. That small change along with a pinch more salt in each dish would make this place 5 star. We didn't have any room for dessert. Next time.",4.0
"I love this place.  I also love that it's walking distance (stumbling?) from my apartment.  It gets crowded on the later side, so if you head over for HH or early dinner, no trouble w tables.  I'm obsessed w the le chalet salad w grilled shrimp, and I get it basically every time we go, along with one of the sides - cornbread with cinnamon butter = amazing.  Good selection of drafts, and good cocktails as well.  Haven't tried the desserts yet, but all the oysters, main dishes + sides we've had were delicious.",5.0
"I tried Catfish a month or so ago for the first (and last) time. I had walked by it several times and it looked intriguing. After suffering from a serious craving for jambalaya for a couple of days, I walked over with my husband for a very early 5:30 pm dinner as he had to catch an international flight later that Thursday evening.Let me reiterate: it was 5:30 pm. On a Thursday.After drinking some pretty good cocktails, I placed my order only to be informed by our indifferent waitress (who spent about 10 minutes texting on her phone before she sauntered over to our table -- I'll call her Roseanne) that ""we're out of jambalaya.""Wait. What? It's a cajun restaurant. It's a Thursday. It's 5:30 pm. How is that even possible?Shrug. ""It happens.""As I began sadly looking at the menu for something else my husband ordered shrimp creole.Yeah. No. ""We're out of shrimp creole."" Holy creoley are you serious Roseanne? I was ticked enough about the jambalaya but her attitude really kicked that annoyance up a notch or two. Her facial expression and body language said: ""Tough. I don't care. I'm not apologizing. Order something else.""It was too late to go anywhere else if my husband was to make his flight. Still dreaming of jambalaya, I decided to just have an appetizer of  'steamed mussels in a white wine and garlic broth'.  It came soon enough, along with my husband's appetizer plate of blackened shrimp and grits. The young guy who delivered it to the table had on a chef's apron so I asked him how a cajun restaurant kitchen could run out of jambalaya and shrimp creole, not mentioning the time of day or day of the week. With a big cheery grin, he said, ""It happens sometimes. We make it up in big batches and sometimes we run out."" Wait. What? If they make big batches and they run out before the dinner crowd arrives, does that mean they make it the day before? At the beginning of the week? I didn't even ask. I started on the mussels ""in white wine and garlic broth."" The menu writer should have written ""some kind of a broth with a big healthy dose of sriracha"" in the description. Sriracha. Or something akin to it. I like a good deal of hotness but the flavor profile was terrible. And I was wondering how long those mussels had been sitting in the kitchen waiting to be warmed up in that sad, sad broth.I couldn't even.My husband had a few mouthfuls of the seriously bland shrimp and grits. I pushed the plate of mussels to the side.After finally getting Roseanne's attention (texting, phone) I said that the menu described the mussels as being in a white wine and garlic broth. ""Yes that's right. And we add some cajun spices,"" said Roseanne with a sneer. I told her it wasn't what I wanted and she asked if I would like something else.""Yes I would like some jambalaya."" Roseanne opened her mouth to retort and thought better about it before spinning on her heel and marching off. Exactly.We paid our bill, left a very good tip (18%) for lousy service and left. I thought about calling the manager/owner the next day but then . . . I didn't.I give it two stars for location, drinks and decor, which is sparse but nice.I usually am willing to give a place a second chance -- not this one. First impressions are so important. Unfortunately for Catfish, they just don't care. And neither do I.",2.0
Ate here during my birthday celebrTion week during the summer and had the shrimp and grits and it was delicious! The cocktails are really good as well. The ambiance is cozy with soft lighting. Would love to go back and try more things on the menu. Worth the price!,5.0

"As a Cajun, I can tell you it isn't quite what my grandma cooked, but it is really good. It feels like most dishes are a twist on what I'm used to and I love it. Recommend the jambalaya (it was spicy and had a bit more tomato than most) and the shrimp grits were spicy and delectable. Bloody Mary was fantastic.",5.0
Ate here last night with a good friend. Trying to step out my comfort zone and try foods from different places. The food was pretty good. I had the cat fish po'boy which was tasty but my only complaint was the bread was a bit hard. But that Craw fish Mac and cheese is a must try! It's crispy on the outside..cheesy on the inside. I never even had crawfish before but after this dish I was a believer. I would definitely come back again. Cool vibe and nice ambiance. The wait staff were pretty attentive too and they allow you to choose your seating when you come in which is a nice little twist to your typical sit down restaurant.,4.0
"If you're a fan of Bloody Mary's then you have come to right place. The Voodoo Bloody Mary at Catfish is to die for! Real lumps of crab meat accompany this extra spicy extra large concoction sure to put you in a great mood!

The voodoo bloody mary at this place is the best bloody mary I have ever had. I only wish they gave you a bigger straw so that the lump crab meat would be easier to get. The first time I came here I came for brunch. I got the croque monsier and it was delicious. I typically put hot sauce on my eggs but the ham was pre spiced with house creole spice- delicious!,5.0

"I was in town for the weekend and heard this place was up and coming. A bit of hike from the city but a good recommendation goes a long way.Homey and cool, with a great atmosphere and cool music. I couldn't tell you what we listened to was but it didn't bug me and didn't interfere with our diner conversation. Dark and cozy with little mason jar votives, recycled doors and tin tiles. Floor plan works and it does get crowded. Full of hipsters but welcoming to me regardless.Drinks were incredible and just the right size. The Bourbon and Rye list was also eye-catching and gave me an idea of what kind of taste these guys have. (GOOD). Beer list was everything I would want but i can get that at home, so coctails it was, First the Sazerac, then the Sidecar (a bit sweet for me but done right) and finally a Rye Old Fashioned. After a round of drinks and checking the place out it seems safe enough to order dinner and we weren't disappointed. Started with oysters(clean good, with all the right sauces) and the cornbread with that amazing cinnamon butter spread stuff. The other reviewers are not wrong. Dinner was the Catfish Po'Boy over rice instead of the baguette for me and the slow cooked beef for my friend. (having the option to not get all messy was great) Catfish was cook right and well seasoned, i loved that it came with a salad and cole slaw so i didn't have to choose or feel like i was getting only white things on my plate. We skipped desert in favor of more drinks. A great place with even more potential as the menu grows. Honestly I was surprised and how well this place is running after only a month and a half.",5.0

"I enjoyed the cocktails here more than the food, but I'd definitely come back to drink and share their awesome mussel and clam combo with garlic bread among some friends. The backyard is great, too, but don't go on a hot summer day - it's very buggy.

My jambalaya was good, not great, but it had plenty of shrimp, sausage and chicken in it to make the price a steal.",4.0
"Having brunch here right now.  My neighbors said the service was terrible and the food was just okay.  That sucks because I'm currently having delicious food and awesome service.  Come for brunch.  In the back patio.  My shrimp and grits are so tasty with good cheesy flavor, shrimp is well seasoned and overall amazing.  Oysters and clams are perfect with good mignonette.  Awesome biscuits with honey butter and blackberry jam.  I'm picky about bloody Marys and this one is good, spicy and not too thick.  Also some of the best coffee I've had in awhile.  Server said its from New Orleans.  So happy right now and will come back again for dinner soon.  Ignore the bad reviews and come see for yourself.  Tommy was my waiter and he rocks.  New favorite neighborhood joint.",5.0

"Two stars because our server was really nice. Maybe it was a bad night, but WOW, what a bad night. For starters, it was nearly impossible to hear my date because the restaurant was blasting a mix of Jurassic 5 and Dubstep. Jurassic 5 and Dubstep are the last two things you want to hear when you are about to eat.Beer was skunk, my date's sazerac was pretty good.Both our meals were served within five minutes of being ordered. Both came out lukewarm/cold. I had the catfish po boy, which was served on bread that had been sitting out for too long. The date had vegan ratatouille, which was overcooked to the point of being chewy. We ordered collard greens, which never came. Weird things: the place is too dark to read the menu without a cell phone. The server brought us napkins with silverware. My dates napkin contained a teaspoon. Mine contained a tiny fork. so odd.The restaurant is mismanaged. Despite not being very busy, the staff seemed overwhelmed. It was possibly just a bad night, but we're not going back.",2.0
This spot is such a cozy homie feel...southern comfort at its finest.

"A friend of mine lives literally 2 minutes from Catfish, and since it opened has been wanting to try it out. I freely admit that I'm a little bit of a Manhattan snob, in that I don't like schlepping to the other boroughs very often without a very good reason. Well, Catfish is officially a very good reason for me! I'm originally from the South, and one of my best friends moved to New Orleans to do her doctorate at Tulane in 2007. I've visited every year for the last 5 years, staying a minimum of 4 days each time. I truly love the city, it's about the only one I care for south of the Mason-Dixon line. We went for brunch this past Sunday, 2/10/13, and I was incredibly impressed. In fact, this is my first Yelp review. I read them all the time but have never written one until now, and it was my experience at Catfish that prompted me to take the plunge and pop my review cherry! Which reminds me, I read about 30 reviews for Catfish BEFORE going, and after dining there myself I am ever MORE sure than I originally was that 85% of the negative reviews are from ridiculous, petty, pompous asses. Giving a restaurant 1 star because it wasn't your version of perfection is rather obnoxious. THE FOOD: Being a vegetarian, restaurants that specialize in Southern-style food can be pretty limiting for me. Luckily brunch food is more accommodating than dinner food, but I noticed that even their regular menu has a vegan ratatouille, which I did not try but heard from another table was delicious. I had an incredibly delicious omelet that I think was called the Trinity? Whichever one didn't have any meat and had celery as an ingredient. I usually think of omelets as pretty standard, it's hard to screw up eggs, you know? But hot damn was this one amazing-I didn't realize there could be such a quality difference in omelets! It also had vermont white cheddar cheese in it, which made it even more magical. The same vermont white cheddar is in the GRITS, which are hands down my favorite and most missed Southern dish. Wow were they good, I hadn't had real grits in 2 years-they gave me flashbacks! My friend was torn between ordering the sausage biscuits and gravy or the french toast, and I (perhaps selfishly) convinced her to do the french toast so that I could have a bit--something I do not have an ounce of regret for! I had never had or seen french toast quite like it, it was like individual little cinnamon rolls but instead of tasting like cinnabuns they tasted like top notch french toast. She tried my grits and agreed they were amazing, about an hour and half later back at her apartment she very seriously considered placing a pick-up order of nothing but 3 orders of grits before talking herself out of it by imagining how long she'd have to spend on an elliptical to balance them out. She said she's going to go back with a carnivorous friend this weekend to try the meat dishes-I'll implore her to write a review. THE DRINKS: Their signature brunch drink was the Voodoo Bloody Mary, which my friend ordered and really enjoyed. It is served with either crab or shrimp meat on top, maybe both, so was not an option for me. However, I confess that after she ate all of the seafood out of it, I did ask to taste it. I am not generally a big bloody mary fan, I've only ever had two in my life that I liked, but one was in NoLa and the other was in Antigua, so I thought if any establishment had a chance at being lucky #3 it would be a place with a bartender who knows how to make em good and spicy. Sure enough, lucky #3 it was! I only had a sip, though, because of my conscience surrounding its fish juice component. I was the boring one and just ordered a mimosa to be safe. It was nothing to write home about, but as good as a solid mimosa gets. I mean, it's just orange juice and champagne-hard to jazz it up without using a different juice or flavor. THE SERVICE: As some other reviewers noted, there was only one waitress on duty. However, brunch was shockingly not at all busy (this place would be packed with a line around the corner on a Sunday afternoon in Chelsea), we were one of only 4 tables, so the one waitress was fine. She was also friendly, attentive, and hell I'll just say it, easy on the eyes as well. Being pretty never hurts, does it? THE ATMOSPHERE: I've spent a lot of time in New Orleans, and more time than I'd like to admit in their dive bars, and I can say that the furniture, decoration, and lighting are all on point. The only thing that was off was the music. I'm not saying that just because it's a New Orleans bar it has to exclusively play blues and jazz nonstop or anything, but Z-100 is not going to cut it, either. You can't play crap pop music in a place like this!I hope this review helps to counteract some of the nonsense ones on here. Just go try the place, and don't go looking for things to complain about. I know I'll be schlepping to Brooklyn again real soon for those grits!",4.0
"I disregarded my friends advice of skipping out on going to Catfish because I wanted to experience it for myself. The space is beautiful and I wanted so badly to have a good meal because I could imagine myself spending time in there.  The home fries were cold and the omelette that was supposed to have onions, celery, and green peppers (I imagined some sort of crunch or substance) was a very sorry excuse for an omelette with minuscule shavings of green peppers.  I asked for hot home fries and my dish came back with warm potatoes but now also a wilting/warm salad.  Did they stick my entire plate in the microwave?  Maybe I ordered the wrong thing.  But if you're going to have something on your menu at least serve it warm and give me a little more than my 10 yr old cousin could manage.  I'm very disappointed to say how unimpressed I am with Catfish.  Maybe they can get it together.",2.0
"All i can say is that i am sorry i have not come through the doors sooner. Very cute spot, odd location but it works for me.

Food and service was great! Food taste good and menu is interesting. Not your typical southern food. Portions are descent and kitchen is open late. My only complaints were that they were out of a lot of things (about half the menu) when I went late (11pm) and too many IPA's on the beer menu. Would be better if they had a wider variety of beers.  Beer menu is only on a chalk board so it is a little hard to read. Maybe there are more beers but there is no paper menu to read from.,4.0
"Have been here twice and have thoroughly enjoyed the experience both times.  Went once with the boyfriend to watch a baseball game at the bar and have drinks and dinner, and another time had brunch outside.  The voody bloody mary is awesome, and the prices don't make me feel like I'm a moron.  (The high prices at some of the other new spots in Crown Heights are insulting.)  Cool, laid back vibe.  Will definitely keep coming back!",4.0
"I came to check it out because one of the owners is an old college buddy - wanted to love it but felt the many ways it could improve. The waitstaff was completely overwhelmed, and on a not-too-busy early Sunday evening. Took 30 minutes to get my order in with a waitress who had earlier claimed to be clocking out, but ended up becoming my nice-enough go-to when the other waiter blissfully ran by me 1,000 times. Finally got my drink 15 minutes later. The Jambalaya was not great - an ok flavor overall, but uneven temperatures throughout and way too many pieces of chicken and weird (cold) andouille sausage, and one tiny little shrimp. I would still be interested in trying some other dishes, but the flustered, though nice enough, service is enough to make me want to order take-out instead.",2.0
"Best spot in the neighborhood. Prices are super reasonable, service impeccable. Food amazing. Nothing bad to say about this joint. Ps: get the cole slaw. It's amazing. It's super fresh, crunchy but smooth with a little kick! Not like that slimy processed stuff you buy at the supermarket..

The only thing that was off was the music. I'm not saying that just because it's a New Orleans bar it has to exclusively play blues and jazz nonstop or anything, but Z-100 is not going to cut it, either. You can't play crap pop music in a place like this!I hope this review helps to counteract some of the nonsense ones on here. Just go try the place, and don't go looking for things to complain about. I know I'll be schlepping to Brooklyn again real soon for those grits!",4.0
"I disregarded my friends advice of skipping out on going to Catfish because I wanted to experience it for myself. The space is beautiful and I wanted so badly to have a good meal because I could imagine myself spending time in there.  The home fries were cold and the omelette that was supposed to have onions, celery, and green peppers (I imagined some sort of crunch or substance) was a very sorry excuse for an omelette with minuscule shavings of green peppers.  I asked for hot home fries and my dish came back with warm potatoes but now also a wilting/warm salad.  Did they stick my entire plate in the microwave?  Maybe I ordered the wrong thing.  But if you're going to have something on your menu at least serve it warm and give me a little more than my 10 yr old cousin could manage.  I'm very disappointed to say how unimpressed I am with Catfish.  Maybe they can get it together.",2.0
"All i can say is that i am sorry i have not come through the doors sooner. Very cute spot, odd location but it works for me. I had the crawfish mac n cheese (ooooo wee) delish; the gumbo was good, I do plan on going back for the alligator burger and more crawfish mac n cheese and i cannot forget the hot toddy (2 to be exact).. pleasant atmosphere and cool bartender Jess.. thank you so much i will see you soon :)",4.0
"Went to Catfish for the first time today and really enjoyed it. I ordered the catfish poboy. That sandwich was AWESOME! The seasoning was right, the bread was nice and crispy, the cole slaw was a bonus! Oh and lets not forget those sweet potatoes! By far the best.  The drinks were not only good but the prices couldn't have been better. The atmospher was just what I expected a neighborhood spot to be: chilled, relaxed, no one in a rush, great prices, and good food n drinks. The wait staff was attentive and friendly. Cant wait to go back!",4.0
"I would not trust their kitchen. Bar is often weak, unless they know you. Atmosphere makes for a good time feel though. Sometimes that's all you need .",1.0
Food and service was great! Food taste good and menu is interesting. Not your typical southern food. Portions are descent and kitchen is open late. My only complaints were that they were out of a lot of things (about half the menu) when I went late (11pm) and too many IPA's on the beer menu. Would be better if they had a wider variety of beers.  Beer menu is only on a chalk board so it is a little hard to read. Maybe there are more beers but there is no paper menu to read from.,4.0
"Have been here twice and have thoroughly enjoyed the experience both times.  Went once with the boyfriend to watch a baseball game at the bar and have drinks and dinner, and another time had brunch outside.  The voody bloody mary is awesome, and the prices don't make me feel like I'm a moron.  (The high prices at some of the other new spots in Crown Heights are insulting.)  Cool, laid back vibe.  Will definitely keep coming back!",4.0
"I came to check it out because one of the owners is an old college buddy - wanted to love it but felt the many ways it could improve. The waitstaff was completely overwhelmed, and on a not-too-busy early Sunday evening. Took 30 minutes to get my order in with a waitress who had earlier claimed to be clocking out, but ended up becoming my nice-enough go-to when the other waiter blissfully ran by me 1,000 times. Finally got my drink 15 minutes later. The Jambalaya was not great - an ok flavor overall, but uneven temperatures throughout and way too many pieces of chicken and weird (cold) andouille sausage, and one tiny little shrimp. I would still be interested in trying some other dishes, but the flustered, though nice enough, service is enough to make me want to order take-out instead.",2.0
"Best spot in the neighborhood. Prices are super reasonable, service impeccable. Food amazing. Nothing bad to say about this joint. Ps: get the cole slaw. It's amazing. It's super fresh, crunchy but smooth with a little kick! Not like that slimy processed stuff you buy at the supermarket.. I love how Catfish allows me to enjoy a bar experience or sit down for dinner. Also, one of the bartenders looks like Orlando Bloom. He's also super friendly. Don't miss out!!",5.0

"contrary to other reviews, i liked the vibe and the people but the food is absolutely disgusting.  We had the crab cakes (bready), gumbo (murky), catfish (soulless), collard greens (sweet?!?!), and black-eyed peas (edible, but bland):  All were relatively embarrassing.  If you want good creole/Southern, check out Delta Grill in Hell's Kitchen or Charles' Country Pan Fried Chicken in Harlem.  One star for the good beer selection on tap and one star for the spacious, laid-back vibeBrigette D gave this 5 stars....but 100% of her reviews are 5-star reviews!?!?!

"I am undecided about this place but I will err on the positive side. I would give this 2 stars (Meh  Ive experienced better) or if Im being charitable  3 (A-ok) at this point.

"I wanted to like this place more, given that it's officially the closest bar to my apartment. I had the catfish po boy and a beer. The po boy was just OK. I like the catfish, but the sandwich itself was difficult to eat and dripping with sauce/dressing. It felt like they'd piled an entire side salad on top of the fish. As for the beer, they have a good selection (10+ taps), but $7 for a standard like Guinness? In a residential area in Crown Heights? That seems fairly inexcusable. I've never seen beers like Six Point Sweet Action above $6 on the nearby and much-more-bustling Franklin Ave. I suggest coming for happy hour before 7pm, when the drinks are $2 cheaper.

"Service here is terrible if you're not a pretty girl that the bartender seems to be trying to hit on.  Sat at the bar for 10 minutes while watching the bartender talk to girls, people who seemed to be his friends, and a group of pretty girls.  I mean he told us twice he was was going to be right with us then went back to talking to everyone else.  He seemed super drunk, or it coulda just been how he acts.  Pretty sure he was drunk though, saw him taking shots with all the pretty girls.  Finally got our order placed.  Don't remember if there were any specials other then the shot of well whisky (or maybe a step above) and a Genny Cream Ale for $7.  Not a very good deal if you ask me seeing as how people in Rochester, where Genny is brewed, don't even drink that swill.  Ordered it anyway because I couldn't stand having to wait for the bartender any longer.Moving onto the end of the night.  You should know this bar closes at 1 for neighborhood reasons.  If you plan on getting a drink make sure you listen for last call.  They don't yell it so if you're not at the bar you probably won't hear.  If you don't hear it then you're S.O.L. unless, and you might have guessed it, you are a pretty girl or the bartenders friend.  Tried to see if we could place a quick order seeing as how he was still handing out drinks but we were not privileged enough to get any last booze.

"I've been here twice and unfortunately the place did not live up to my expectations. The first was time was during lunch on a Monday (not busy at all, just one other table). I got  the special, butternut squash soup, and a side of corn bread. Neither were spectacular. They weren't bad, but I felt like I could make better dishes at home. I also got their special brunch bloody mary which was AMAZING. One of the best I've ever had, it had crab and shrimp in it (although the quality of the seafood was only okay). The service was good though. And I love the decor.The second time was for late brunch on a Sunday. The place wasn't too packed, brunch was kind of ending. It was very awkward when we walked in because the staff either ignored us, or looked at us and kept going about what they were doing. So we decided to just seat ourselves. A waitress came over and gave us water, but no menus, so we took one from the table beside us and shared it. She never came to took our order so we had to flag down the other waiter and ask him if we could order. We got the catfish po' boy to split. Our original waitress brought it out, but she didn't bring share plates or silverware, we had to ask for them. There's nothing worse than staring at your food while you're starving, waiting for a waitress to bring over utensils and plates. The sandwich was good, not the best po' boy I've had, but good. It's not something I would tell all of my friends that HAVE to go there and try. And for $12, I was expecting something that I would be craving for days. I also wish they had cut it in half, even if we weren't sharing it, it would be a lot easier to manage if it were cut in half. We also split the shrimp cocktail, which again was good but not something I would recommend to friends. It's either the quality of the seafood, or they way they are preparing it that I just don't like. The shrimp is kind of mushy in this weird way. I like the fact that they're open for lunch, but their prices are way higher than any other place you can get lunch in the neighborhood. I would like to see a different, cheaper lunch menu.Overall, to compete with the other spots in the neighborhood which have amazing food, either the food needs to get better, or the prices need to come down.",2.0

"I usually don't travel far past Washington avenue for dinner but after the reviews I had to try this place.  I went on a Thursday night and it was unusually crowed but then again there was a Net's playoff game going on.  They allow you to pick your seats so we took a table by the bar with a good view of the TV.  The first thing we were told once seated was that they were out of cornbread, sweet potatos and the Jambalaya. Yikes! Everything I wanted to try.  SO we settled on Gumbo Filé, and the Shrimp Creole.  We also got an assortment of Blue point oysters as the appetizer.  They had a decent selection of draft beers and a decent cocktail menu.  The draft beers came in giant chalices.  The appetizer came very late, but it was worth it.  They came with horseradish, cocktail sauce and creole mignonette sauce.  They also served us 12 instead of 6, not sure if it was a mistake or if they were trying to undo the wait time but either way, it didn't stop us from eating them. Our meals came while we were still finishing up our appetizer.  Both large portions. The shrimp creole I found lighter and more refreshing, the gumbo filé was a little heavy and the sauce was bland.  The shrimp in both dishes however was cooked perfectly. We didn't have dessert but I was intrigued by the special dessert (not on the menu) of key lime cheesecake.  I would go back, but please have the Jambalaya!",4.0

"I should be angry.  A place this amazing, this close to my apartment is dangerous. I am probably there 4 times a week.  I've done dinner, brunch and just drinks.  In that order:Dinner.  I've had the Vegan Ratatouille, Gumbo, and Beef Po'Boy.  Crazy amazing, all the way around.  I will say, don't get the Po'Boy when you're already pretty buzzed.  Po'Boys, kinda by definition, are messy, and drunky hands don't help.  Not their fault and it was crazy delicious.  Oh, and I had the corn bread.  SO good.  I actually took a bunch of friends in just to have the corn bread one night...  Brunch.  I haven't had any entrees yet; just a table full of all the sides.  As a child of the South, I love grits.  These may be the best grits I've ever had...  I recommend the Tasso ham with the grits--great pairing.  Bloody Mary is one of the best I've ever had and I've bartended in Manhattan for over a decade.Drinks.  Great cocktail list.  Fun, tasty and feels authentic.  Sazerac is the real deal.  I like mine dry and it was perfect.  If you like yours a little sweeter, I'd order it that way.  But for me, the beer list is the highlight.  16 rotating taps featuring the best craft beers on the market.  I am a biiiiiig beer person and they've exposed me to a couple that I'd never had.  Weyerbacher Double Simcoe, anyone?!?!  And I love that they've always got something new on the list.My husband is reading over my shoulder and tells me I've used too many exclamation points but I refuse to go back and take any out because I feel that strongly:)",5.0

Ratatouille, oysters, po'boys all great!  Warning: Don't try to be cute while eating a po'boy.  It is a huge delicious two handed mayo-faced mess.  Drinks:  Wonderful.  I mostly drink straight bourbon, but I have been convinced to try cocktails (sazerac, bloody mary, hurricane) and loved every one.  They seem very experienced with mixing up those drinks expertly.  Great beer selection with a knowledgeable staff to help me out with my picks.  Can't wait for the backyard to be my new favorite summer spot!",5.0

"Good, but not great southern food. I had gumbo that had good depth of flavor, and was moderately spicy. The prices are definitely right. In a city full of mediocre $20 entrees, the menu seems to have a lot of good values in the $15 range. Mac and cheese and shrimp and grits were also solid if not spectacular. Good beer and cocktail list that sticks mostly to classics. A good neighborhood joint. I'll be back!",4.0
"The decor is detailed, cozy with faux fireplace, vintage-y doors on tin ceiling, wood finishing, and discreet TV's above the bar for sports fans (I am assuming since I am not one.)  I liked the beer selection and cocktails, the food was only okay - since the po' boy pork came in small-ish portions and not too warm. The #1 problem here was the music selection which was sort of top 40 random radio mix. This really detracted from this experience, so please change up the music and I will definitely consider going back.",2.0
"The food, ambiance and service is great all I wish is for them to have Shrimp Po Boy that will take it to the next level at least to me",4.0
"I should be angry.  A place this amazing, this close to my apartment is dangerous. I am probably there 4 times a week.  I've done dinner, brunch and just drinks.  In that order:Dinner.  I've had the Vegan Ratatouille, Gumbo, and Beef Po'Boy.  Crazy amazing, all the way around.  I will say, don't get the Po'Boy when you're already pretty buzzed.  Po'Boys, kinda by definition, are messy, and drunky hands don't help.  Not their fault and it was crazy delicious.  Oh, and I had the corn bread.  SO good.  I actually took a bunch of friends in just to have the corn bread one night...  Brunch.  I haven't had any entrees yet; just a table full of all the sides.  As a child of the South, I love grits.  These may be the best grits I've ever had...  I recommend the Tasso ham with the grits--great pairing.  Bloody Mary is one of the best I've ever had and I've bartended in Manhattan for over a decade.Drinks.  Great cocktail list.  Fun, tasty and feels authentic.  Sazerac is the real deal.  I like mine dry and it was perfect.  If you like yours a little sweeter, I'd order it that way.  But for me, the beer list is the highlight.  16 rotating taps featuring the best craft beers on the market.  I am a biiiiiig beer person and they've exposed me to a couple that I'd never had.  Weyerbacher Double Simcoe, anyone?!?!  And I love that they've always got something new on the list.My husband is reading over my shoulder and tells me I've used too many exclamation points but I refuse to go back and take any out because I feel that strongly:)",5.0
"Location is excellent - haven't tried any of the eats, but, service at the bar is top-notch an prices are reasonable. The ID guy at night is temporary to please the bitchy neighbors, so don't be offended by that- the place is brand new an well decorated. It just needs to be bigger to accommodate the local demand. Easier said than done though.",5.0
"I dont often go to Brooklyn but I will absolutely be back to Catfish!! Big beer selection GREAT atmosphere and the food was AWESOME! Spicy, fresh & great portions! Cant wait to go back and try everything on the menu! Well done Catfish, well done indeed!",5.0
"Having any bars or sit down food options within walking distance of my house is still so thrilling that I may get too enthusiastic, but I really don't think that's the case with Catfish.  Been here a few times already and I'm confident to say the followingDecor:  Nice!  I like all the different seating options.  It feels like a totally different place if I'm sitting up front, or at the tables, or at the bar.  Love the bathroom (which is an amazing thing to say in a bar/restaurant), good attention to details, cozy yet spacious.Service: Good!  Very attentive waitress.  Bartenders can get distracted when it's busy at night but HELLO it is a busy bar at night and that's that.Food:  Yums.  Haven't been since they just expanded the menu but I have loved everything I've eaten here. Ratatouille, oysters, po'boys all great!  Warning: Don't try to be cute while eating a po'boy.  It is a huge delicious two handed mayo-faced mess.  Drinks:  Wonderful.  I mostly drink straight bourbon, but I have been convinced to try cocktails (sazerac, bloody mary, hurricane) and loved every one.  They seem very experienced with mixing up those drinks expertly.  Great beer selection with a knowledgeable staff to help me out with my picks.  Can't wait for the backyard to be my new favorite summer spot!",5.0
"I'm giving 2stars b/c I'm happy to have a bar near my apt. and the atmosphere was nice. But the food needs some serious help. The lemon pepper poached shrimp was ok, the andouille sausage po boy was average but the blackened catfish po boy was inedible. I'm chalking this one up to first week jitters. At least I hope that's all it was.",2.0
great happy hour experience here.  they were very accommodating to my large group.  great atmosphere for meeting up with friends for a drink.  large group or small.  great drink selections that left everyone happy.,4.0
"This is my new Go-To spot in the Crown Heights area when I'm there, which is, sad to say, infrequent. But after discovering this place, I'm readjusting my weekend bike route.

"We came here for dinner and a drink and we thought the ambiance and decor were great - if it was just a bar they'd be getting a better review. The food was a little bit disappointing, and the way the dining is set up involved couples and groups sitting quite close together in a long line, so we heard more of our neighbors' conversation than our own at times, which makes it not that great for romance or conversation.",3.0
"Just discovered this very recently opened brunch place/bar/restaurant not far from where I live and was so so pleased. I'm a little worried this place will be packed within a few months! The staff was very friendly and funny and the food was great (with really nice portion sizes). Definitely try the gumbo and the grits. The bloody mary looked bomb, so will try next time. Loved the deep South vibe, especially as I'm originally from the South and miss the food. I'm excited to have a new neighborhood spot!",4.0

"I started with a Bloody Mary super hot (I didn't order a Voodo - just asked for a Bloody Mary) and tasted of Old Bay seasoning for some reason.  Good beer selection, switched after being fried by the Bloody Mary.  Good oysters, had a couple different types.  Will not order the  beef Poboy, sloppy and fairly tasteless, hard to eat as a sandwich, maybe it was tasteless after the super over the top ""taste"" of the Bloody Mary?   I'll try something else next time, I'll be back. Service was good.",2.0
"This place is a keeper (based on one visit for dinner with friends). The food, drinks, service and decor are all worthy of praise. When we were there, a jazz band played some sets of good music. Thumbs up! I will definitely go back.",5.0
"Catfish has hit its stride and is getting better and better. Dinner is delicious. My husband loves the oyster selection and the catfish po'boy. As a vegetarian, I like their vegan selection but I am thrilled by their brunch. They make a perfect omelette. French toast (pain perdu).... Amazing. Bananas foster pancakes? Just go eat them. Happy hour is great - if you like whiskey, good beer, and awesome bartenders you will leave happy. If you don't like any of these things....just ignore my review.",5.0
"this is my favorite place in nyc. it only opened recently, but every time i'm in brooklyn i make sure to spend serious time there. the food is delicious--they have pretty reasonably priced appetizers and amazing po boys. their beers on tap are always changing and are always great choices. the bartenders are all really nice and helpful and the atmosphere is wonderful. it's really laid-back, and it feels like you've left nyc and gone to new orleans. i would recommend it to pretty much anyone",5.0
