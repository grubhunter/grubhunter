"I think this place is really special. Delicious food, nice ambiance and above all else, incredibly reasonable prices.A friend of mine was visiting from out of town and craving Italian food, and we decided to check this place out as it is walking distance from my apartment. WOW! My expectations were far exceeded.Dishes ordered:Fritto di Calamari e Zucchine ($9.50) -- we absolutely loved this as a starter and I thought having pieces of zucchini mixed in with the calamari was a nice addition. We asked for extra lemon with ours, and the sauce that came with it was flavorful as well.Tortelli di Zucca e Olio Tartufato ($12) -- this was a butternut squash ravioli in a butter sauce with truffle oil. AMAZING! I can't wait to eat this dish again. The portion sizes were generous and I loved every bite of this. Ravioli di Funghi al Gorgonzola ($11) -- this is the dish my friend ordered, I didn't try it because I'm not a fan of blue cheese or any of its relatives. She absolutely loved it though!The place has a small, intimate setting which was nice because it allowed the waiter to be very attentive. I think this would be a really cute date spot.Extra points for having more than one remarkable vegetarian option. I will definitely be back!",5.0
"Really great time on Valentine's Day.Even better - it was a quality, affordable meal. Why is this so hard for other restaurants to replicate?The brussels sprouts salad appetizer ($7) was a mound of shredded greens. A crinkly/craggily mound with sprinkles of hard cheese. A light start to a great meal. The polenta with mushrooms was also enjoyable if you're looking for something a little heartier.Our entrees - ravioli and pasta with ragu were traditional meals, but done very well, and at an average cost of about $11 for an entree, made it especially enjoyable. Warm, filling, well seasoned. Yes.We split a bottle of red wine that came out to $30, and all told spent $90 (food + beverage + tax + tip) for a meal that got us 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, and a bottle of wine.The service was very friendly, and especially welcoming. This is an affordable place, with a romantic edge, and I will for sure be back.My only qualm is that it is SUPER cold by the windows, but, hey, that's life.I've already told two friends about this place, and suggest you come RIGHT NOW.",5.0
"ALMOST HAD WHAT COULD'VE BEEN A DEADLY ALLERGIC REACTIONSo, last night my husband and I went out for dinner with friends and we chose to go to Testo, a neighborhood restaurant that's been there for a about 3 years.  Testo is the younger sibling of another restaurant we like that's just up the block from where live, Il Passatore.  When we arrived, the four of us were seated at the bar; mats, utensils, glasses of water, bread, olive oil and menus were placed in front of us. The service was pretty on spot. But, I'd like to point out something, that had it been someone else... this meal could have been DEADLY.  We ordered some apps, a pasta dish and our dinner plates. Like most of people, we all like to sample what the others have ordered.  My husband is allergic to certain nuts; walnuts, pecans, pine nuts, and possibly a few others.  What he's not allergic to are peanuts, cashews and definitely not almonds. Our friend, ordered a kale salad that had almonds, and of course we sampled it thinking it was safe.  Soon after having a taste, my husband started having an allergic to something in the the kale salad.  I immediately ran out to get him some Benadryl, leaving him behind with our friends.  While I was gone, he questioned the owner(management) if anything else was in the salad that wasn't listed on the menu. He also asked if the kitchen cleaned their pots, pans, and utensils to avoid cross contamination, but the owner responded ""everything is separate"".  When I arrived with the Benadryl the rest of our order had been served, not feeling comfortable with the kitchens practices, my husband decided not to eat. Though we didn't eat the food, we were offered to pay for what we ordered, but the owner kept insisting that we didn't have to pay. Now, the problem lies within following statements the owner made, which were ""You should warn us if you have allergies"" and ""You shouldn't be eating off your friends plate"". If every ingredient is listed on the menu and pots and pans are separate, then why would he make such a statement. We tried to explained the severity of the situation but the owner(management) would cut both me and my husband in mid sentence.  All we wanted was for him to listen, but he didn't and then threaten to call the police because we were disturbing the diners. So we left, not having paid for rmy husband having had a reaction that could have been much worse.  Again, all he wanted was for him to please listen and investigate if the kitchen made could have made any errors.",1.0
"Came with my boyfriend late one night and had a really wonderful meal.We started with the Polpette di Melanzane which were balls of eggplant in a red sauce with arugula on the side. Tasty, but nothing too exciting. Tasted very similar to eggplant parmesan. I had one of the specials which was Lamb tagliatelle which was absolutely delicious! Good portion size as well.My boyfriend had the Ravioli ai Formaggi Misti and was very happy. He said it was cheesy without being too heavy.We shared a carafe of house wine which was very affordable, and pretty good wine for the price.For dessert, we had the tiramisu which was lovely. Rich without being too heavy. To finish, we were brought limoncello complements of the house. It was a wonderful way to end our meal.Cash only! There is an ATM right outside though.",4.0
"After reading the review I decided to place an order for pickup. My love and I decide to try the pappardelle salsiccia e spinaci which is flat noodle with sausage and spinach in light tomato sauce. The fresh homemade pasta sealed the deal as far as freshness the sauce and sausage with spinach was a perfect marriage in taste. It's been a long time I had a good Italian meal. Kudus to the chef, your meal took me back to my trip in Florence.",5.0
"I hate to give this 3-star review....I love Testo. The service is amazing. The owner is lovely. But lately the food has been slipping. I had one of the specials ""Bucatini all'Amatriciana."" It really had no flavor. Furthermore, the bread we were given was stale. There are plenty of good recipes for Italian food online. Maybe try to revamp some of your dishes, because lately things have been lacking flavor. As a tip, if you want a bucatini all'amatriciana recipe, try mario batali's. It is magnificent.",3.0

Can't believe I haven't reviewed this place after several years of going here. I'm a pasta snob so you can trust me when I say it never disappoints. Portions are the correct amount. Never leave hungry, but hardly leave with leftovers. What else... Cash only, ATM close by. Don't forget to have some wine with your authentic Italian meal. For dessert Affogato Al Caffe is amazing. Just go.",5.0
"Wow. This quaint, small place on a quiet corner of East Willamsburg is a hidden gem. Italian is their specialty, and they make it simple and cheap. My favorite things to get here are the shaved brussel sprouts salad, gnocchi with tomato sauce, and the tiramisu for dessert. I can't remember exact pricing, but I'm pretty sure all 3 of those items would be under $25. They are the exact amount of food I'm looking for in an appetizer, dish, and dessert, as most places provide too much of everything and I feel like a balloon after the first dish.  They've got outdoor seating as well, and I've never had to wait to be seated. This is a perfect date night spot as it's quiet and off the beaten path!Cash only.",5.0
"Best Italian place in the neighborhood. Food is from the Emilia-Romagna region, so it's rich but delicious. The sauteed chicken breast with spinach and fontina cheese, the Brussels sprouts salad, and the Strozzapreti al Ragu are all excellent. Grilled octopus is great as well.",5.0

It's a great spot to go for a date.   Heads up, it is cash only.",5.0
"My husband and I have been regulars in Testo not long after they had their grand opening. This place is a hidden gem, and my favorite place to have a romantic & delicious meal. The owners are very kind as well as the rest of the staff. Ultimate favorites would be their mussels in red sauce, mushroom ravioli with a creamy gorgonzola sauce & a new item on their menu, an octopus salad with a drizzle of olive oil and lemon! They always offer amazing specials & in season ingredients! Good job Testo you never disappoint! Keep it up! 5 stars is very well deserved!",5.0
"This review has nothing to do with the food. I'm angry with myself for being ""that person"", but hear me out. My boyfriend and I live, literally, 400ft away (according to Yelp). We can see Testo from the window,  have lived here for over a year and both love pasta! He's a chef in Manhattan for a prominent restaurant, and I work FOH in West Village, so all in all we have a full appreciation for good food and service. We had never eaten at Testo and wanted to try it out for it's  outrageously affordable menu. We went on what I think was a weekday around 9:15 (a few months back).  We were excited to potentially have a new go-to spot and have a quick bite on our day off. However, upon entering and requesting ""2 for dinner"" we heard ""ok, but just to let you know the kitchen will be closing in about 45 minutes.""  WHAT!? 45 minutes is more than enough time, it's not like we walked in at 9:50.... in pure annoyance we decided it wasn't worth our time or money to get the, no doubt, poor service this server would bestow upon us. So we walked up to grand to eat at our friends restaurant, which is always our go-to. It's unfortunate that we both refuse to eat here now, we even talk about it every time we walk past. Especially seeing the reviews of people who come in with 15min to spare and have a 5 star wonderful experience.  Sadly, that was not ours, and it's left a bitter taste in my mouth.",1.0

"Came here because we couldn't find a true, legit Italian pasta place around east Bushwick and it DID NOT disappoint. The waiter (poor guy) was manning the bar, floor and the outside patio, but handled it like a champ. It didn't seem like anyone waited more than like 5 minutes for anything they needed. They make their pasta in-house and it was delightful. I had the bolognese and the noodles were thick and kind of seemed like spahtzle... my boyfriend got the cheese ravioli in the butter sauce. They are butter lovers here, which I love. Everything had butter. So. GOOD.It's a small place, the plates aren't expensive at all and you get a good portion of fresh, true Italian pasta.

"Outdoor seating and gluten free options! It's also very cheap. We got there and had a different dish each. Of note is their ability to make almost anything on their menu gluten-free.  I was the only person who needed a gluten free dish, the Spaghetti a la Carbonara, and my company had gnocchi, Ragu, and another saucy pasta. I forgot what it was. They also ordered an appetizer-- octopus, and they loved it. The meal left much to be desired. My friends all tried a bit of my pasta, as well as each of their plates, and there was little to no difference. The food was very, very, very bland. My meal was heavy on the dairy, which I knew, but even I was surprised by how much they soaked my poor gluten free penne in dairy. I felt like I was a 1 year old having my morning bottle and not dinner at 8 PM on a Friday night.There appeared to be two servers when we were there, both of them doubling as bartenders throughout the night. The restaurant was not at all crowded, but they asked all people who entered if they had reservations. I found this comical because it implied that they were very busy (at 8 PM), when they were very obviously not. They had an extensive wine menu, but we had none of it. I think we might have enjoyed it more if we had considered either the wine or the desserts (five options, I think... tiramisu among them). In short, it's not a very extensive menu, but it's relatively inexpensive and there are options for the gluten-free world. It would definitely not be my first choice in the future.",3.0

"Mmm, fresh, homemade pasta at an affordable price. Entrees range from $9-13. Whoever said it was the Bianca of East Williamsburg is spot on. I came here twice in one week after a friend introduced me to this cute restaurant just blocks away from my apartment - once for dinner, once for brunch.

The brunch special, $12 for coffee/tea, mimosa/bellini, and an entree of your choice (ranging from spaghetti carbonara to a sweet crepe), is a solid deal.

"We went here on New Year's Eve for the first time, and we were very pleased all around.  The food was hot and fresh (I loved the gnocchi), they were accommodating with our special requests, and you just can't beat the value.  Everyone working was super friendly, as well, which is always a bonus.",5.0
"Testo is the quintessential delicious neighborhood Italian. Both the price and the yum factor are unparalleled! Stick with the homemade pasta. Pro tip: tagliatelle with lamb ragu, and give brunch a shot. I celebrated two birthdays in a row here and Testo does not disappoint.",5.0
"My favorite Italian restaurant in all of New York! I come here or get take out at least twice a month, and I have always had consistently delicious food and great service. They are so friendly and they make you feel right at home. The outdoor seating is great and their carafes of wine are a legit price as well as all of their amazing home made pastas. My favorites are the lamb ragu (seasonal), the seafood pasta, and actually all of the salads! My vegetarian friends also love coming here and are always happy with the meatless options. I don't want it to get too busy but I gotta give love to my favorite place!",5.0
"This restaurant is so good!! The food is absolutely delicious, service is perfect and they deliver!!!! Just ordered a special soup, which was fish stew (salmon, trout, mussels, something else, lots of love) and my favorite butternut squash tortili. Food arrived within 20 min, hot and delicious. I love that they wrap some bread for you, and cheese or lemon if it comes with the dish. So simple, but so attentive!Recommend this place!! The best!!",5.0

"This place is great and I want to go there every day until Dr. Atkins comes back from the grave and scolds me for all the carbs. The prices are way lower than expected considering the quality of the food and the fact that this place is in Williamsburg (well, kinda Williamsburg). You cant get a delicious plate of home made pasta for 10 to 15 buckaroos.

"Testo was always a favorite, go-to, neighborhood restaurant. The food is delicious, high quality, and affordable, and the service is friendly and efficient. Then one day, for some unknown reason, my favorite dish, the mushroom ravioli with gorgonzola cream sauce, was removed from the menu. Any time I try to inquire about it, the staff acts like they don't want to talk about it. I'm not sure what the big secret is, or why the dish was removed. Maybe I was the only one who ordered it? Maybe one of the ingredients became super expensive, or is no longer available? I have no idea, but for whatever reason, it's gone, and as a result, we hardly ever go to Testo anymore... I'm a vegetarian, and have tried the other meatless options, such as the beet ravioli, and veggie lasagna. They are both ""good"", but not really enticing enough to draw me in. Testo, PLEASE bring back the mushroom ravioli.

"Our Airbnb rental is in the same building as Testo, in fact they were our immediate neighbors, so it made sense that we would end up having dinner there (it also didn't hurt that there was a torrential downpour last night and we didn't want to venture far). Testo is a tiny, cash only Italian restaurant in East Williamsburg. There's probably only seating for 25-30 max, including the bar. We were crammed into a corner seating area right near the kitchen. For a party of 5, we ended up ordering all of the appetizers and two entrees and split everything. Olives, polenta, caprese, mussels, calamari, gnocchi and the butternut squash pasta. We also split a carafe of white wine. The food was good, and I had no complaints about the quality. I really enjoyed the creamy polenta and the butternut squash pasta. I would say that the timing of the dishes could have been better, because everything arrived within the space of one minute, with the exception of the mussels which showed up toward the end of our meal. Testo is so small actually, that when our dishes arrived, the owner would pop his head out of the kitchen and tap me on the shoulder to ask which type of sauce we would want, pass out a dish, then collect any empty plate on its return -- all from the kitchen door over my shoulder. At the end of our meal, we were given complementary shots of limoncello. Most of the dishes were in the $8-$10 range. The portions aren't large, but they were enough.

It's also a miracle, or perhaps a shame, that this place hasn't been vaulted to a cherished place on the Vulture-Eater-Village Voice food blog hype machine and turned into an hour weekday wait.

I recommend sharing the seafood soup as a starter if you're into market fresh seafood and the most perfect tomato broth. Their pasta dishes run about $8-$10 with entrees that are a tad more expensive. Rumor has it, they've started a weekend brunch and you can hear the prep staff pounding out tonight's pasta while you revel in your hangover remedy. Testo is...The perfect date spot.

"This is a hidden gem.  The only have beer and wine and the place is very tiny but the food is heavenly.  My g.f. and I got there at around 7pm and there was 2 tables already filled.  I left for 5 minutes to go to the ATM and grab cash because this place is cash only and the nearest ATM is at a bodega down the block.  When I came back there were 2 more tables filled and people at the bar.  With in a twenty minute period every seat in the house was filled.  The red wine on the menu was just perfect.  Not too dry and had a fruity taste to it and it was reasonably priced.  Then we ordered appetizers which were very filling.  For a moment I felt as if I was in Spain eating tapas.  We ordered Olive Miste which was this bowl filled with all sorts of olives that seemed home marinated.  We also ordered La Piadina which was flat bread baked with mozzarella, tomatoes & arugla (but I think they also had ones with prosciutto and pancetta).  The waiter was also the bartender and he just seemed like a super hero because he even took take out orders on the phone while still being very attentive to every customer.  The meals were incredible.  I am originally from Boston where we have North End (Italian part of the city) where everybody goes to and waits in long lines to taste the most amazing Italian food in the country.  I can vouch because I've been to pretty much every state in the country and god knows how many cities numerous times.  There was a mom and pop Italian restaurant that came pretty close in northern Italy but other than that almost every mom and pop restaurant in the North End triumphed.  Anyways....  The ravioli di fungi e ricotta with gorgonzola cream was one of the most flavorful dishes I have ever eaten in my whole entire life.  I've lived in Italy for 6 months and went back there again recently and even in Italy I never had anything as flavorful as the ravioli dish I had at Testo.  I made the decision that when the time comes for my last meal I will request for food to be brought to me from this restaurant.  That decision was made when my g.f. gave me a bite of her Tortelli di Zucca con Olio Tartufato.   In English: Butternut squash filled tortilla with butter sauce and truffle oil.  Imagine the perfect blend of garlic and truffle oil and the sweet taste of butternut squash which I typically shy away from eating.Dear Testo chef... if you are reading this, which is highly unlikely...

"The only downside to this place is that it is CASH ONLY. Truly amazing lamb tagliatelle, great calamari with delicious spicy marinara sauce, great house wines .... And everything is an amazing value --especially for NYC. The restaurant is very cute, has great lighting, and an outdoor dining option!",5.0
"Testo is uh mazing. It's one of those restaurants that you hope won't blow up solely for selfish reasons. Teeny little place (no more than a 20-top) on the corner of a residential street, this spot is warm and cozy  just like the food they serve: house made pasta made with sauces of which no corners have been cut and typical northern Italian apps & entrees. I recommend sharing the seafood soup as a starter if you're into market fresh seafood and the most perfect tomato broth. Their pasta dishes run about $8-$10 with entrees that are a tad more expensive. Rumor has it, they've started a weekend brunch and you can hear the prep staff pounding out tonight's pasta while you revel in your hangover remedy. Testo is...The perfect date spot. The perfect night out with friends. Don't forget to stop by the ATM as it's cash only. Mangia!",5.0
"The piadina were warm and comforting. The pasta, too, was proportionally perfect and the wine selection was ideal for a menu this size and price range. It's a wonderful neighborhood staple to enjoying a night out whether or not it is a special occasion.",5.0
"Meh.In 14 minutes you could walk from Testo to Il Passatore.  The menu & underwhelming food would be the same at both places.The Caprese con Mozzarella di Bufala ($10) was really disappointing.  The tomato wasn't ripe, the cheese was dry & the garnish was ONE basil leaf.  The plate needed a healthy drizzle of olive oil.  Where was the waiter to bring this?  Outside, smoking.  Rip off.The entrees were fine.  The handmade pasta in the ragu was great.  The sauce itself was thin & kinda like the sauce in Chef Boyardee.  Once upon a time, Chef Boyardee was a great champion of Italian cuisine.I wasn't surprised that my steak was overcooked.  The poor thing was dry & gristle-pocked, but the garnishes made it more enjoyable.  The caramelized onions atop the steak were the best part of my meal, really delicious.The small space & atmosphere are charming, i expect to see a lot of traffic here.  Though i walked away feeling ""meh"" about my meal, if you stick to the pasta selections you won't have completely wasted your time & money.Cash Only.  No alcohol, no BYOB. No AC.PS, AVOID the seafood pasta unless you like the taste of freezer burn",2.0
"Had a wonderful dinner there.  Surprisingly the place was empty on a Thursday night.  Maybe because there is no more BYOB.No matter.  The food was delicious and I had one of the top five fish dishes of my life there, the branzino.  The butternut squash pasta and the brussels sprout salad were delicious as well.Now that the weather is nice, I may have to go back for brunch and sit at one of the outside tables.",5.0
"This is a hidden gem.  The only have beer and wine and the place is very tiny but the food is heavenly.  My g.f. and I got there at around 7pm and there was 2 tables already filled.  I left for 5 minutes to go to the ATM and grab cash because this place is cash only and the nearest ATM is at a bodega down the block.  When I came back there were 2 more tables filled and people at the bar.  With in a twenty minute period every seat in the house was filled.  The red wine on the menu was just perfect.  Not too dry and had a fruity taste to it and it was reasonably priced.  Then we ordered appetizers which were very filling.  For a moment I felt as if I was in Spain eating tapas.  We ordered Olive Miste which was this bowl filled with all sorts of olives that seemed home marinated.  We also ordered La Piadina which was flat bread baked with mozzarella, tomatoes & arugla (but I think they also had ones with prosciutto and pancetta).  The waiter was also the bartender and he just seemed like a super hero because he even took take out orders on the phone while still being very attentive to every customer.  The meals were incredible.  I am originally from Boston where we have North End (Italian part of the city) where everybody goes to and waits in long lines to taste the most amazing Italian food in the country.  I can vouch because I've been to pretty much every state in the country and god knows how many cities numerous times.  There was a mom and pop Italian restaurant that came pretty close in northern Italy but other than that almost every mom and pop restaurant in the North End triumphed.  Anyways....  The ravioli di fungi e ricotta with gorgonzola cream was one of the most flavorful dishes I have ever eaten in my whole entire life.  I've lived in Italy for 6 months and went back there again recently and even in Italy I never had anything as flavorful as the ravioli dish I had at Testo.  I made the decision that when the time comes for my last meal I will request for food to be brought to me from this restaurant.  That decision was made when my g.f. gave me a bite of her Tortelli di Zucca con Olio Tartufato.   In English: Butternut squash filled tortilla with butter sauce and truffle oil.  Imagine the perfect blend of garlic and truffle oil and the sweet taste of butternut squash which I typically shy away from eating.Dear Testo chef... if you are reading this, which is highly unlikely... BRAVO!  p.s. with 2 Tiramisu's for desserts our bill was still was 3x lower than at any other place in Manhattan.",5.0

"Every time I come to NY my belly craves that Italian grub... I have a smart belly ;)Testo was recommended by some locals and thank goodness I listened. Not only was the food and wine perfection but so was the service and ambiance. Being a new mommy my taste for moscatos and sweet wines has taken over me. I asked if they had one and was recommended to drink this amazing Italian sweet chilled deliciousness called Sangue Di Giuda (BEST I'VE EVER HAD). I asked what their signature dishes were and of the two mentioned I ordered  Tortelli di Zucca Olio Tartufato... OMG it was FABULOUS!Originally when I ordered, I asked for takeout but I decided to stay because I had my 6 month old daughter strapped to my chest and knew that I may not have a chance to eat comfortably when I got home. No questions asked ( love that) the bartender/server immediately set me up at the bar and brought over the high chair. within a minute I was set up beautifully and given their homemade focaccia bread, water, and the list goes on. Lastly, the cleanliness of this restaurant was so wonderful. You can tell they take pride in their establishment.Thank you TESTO for an amazing experience and I will definitely be back!",5.0
"What a great little italian place. First let me start off with a warning. This place is cash only like every-other place in Brooklyn. That being said get yourself some cash and go there. You won't need much, it's very easy to find a tasty dish for under $15 unless you drink in which case god bless you.  The portions are just right not to much not to little and the food melts in your mouth. Boom eat there!",5.0

Amidst a thoroughly residential area will you find tiny Testo. It's pretty much a one man waiter for entire restaurant type of deal- crazy!  Anyhoo- don't expect a really accommodating/patient/efficient service. Food was superb and price was definitely easy on the wallet- spent like 8-11 bucks per pasta dish? That ain't half bad. It's bit of a walk from the subway but food is easily one of the better Italian dishes/great price I've had................ever.,4.0
"I'm a sucker for homey, simple and tasty Italian food. This place has it all. I hope it lasts.Last night was our second chance to go to Testo. The first trip came by chance as we refused to wait in line at Roberta's. I'm glad we found this place. On to the food! Since it's cash only, we didn't have a chance to try too much last time. We came prepared last night. We ordered the caprese salad and the pancetta and fontina piadina. Both were very good, but not entirely ground breaking. The piadina was tasty, but if we didn't have more food coming, I would have been disappointed. As it was, a good start to the meal.For mains, we ordered the Tortelli and pasta with ragu sauce. The tortelli was awesome. Pasta cooked perfectly, with great filling and a somewhat sweet sauce. The ragu is great too. I really like rustic pasta, and this hit the spot.For the price, you really can't beat Testo. We spent $56 total on the food with a beer and a glass of house red.I think we like this place because while the food is great, the service and ambiance are just what we're looking for sometimes. It's quiet and you can have a conversation without yelling. That is a rare thing in this part of the world.",5.0

The kitchen never takes long to get the simple, delicious Italian fare to the table. Out of any Italian restaurant, I've never been so blown away by the consistency of perfectly cooked pasta dishes. My favorites are the Bucatini All'amatriciana, Rigatoni Con Funghi E Caprino with the rich, creamy gorgonzola sauce, and the ever-changing pasta dishes on their specials board.

Hand made tagliatelle with a lamb ragu was clearly a fresh pasta, and cooked to perfection with just enough bite and that texture that you just KNOW didn't come from a dried pasta out of a box. And for only 10 bucks? Incredible, considering the sauce was not short on meat at all. It had a very rich taste to it. Also tried one of the $7 flatbread specialty appetizers, with meat (was it prosciutto? Can't remember) and fontina cheese, which was basically a quesadilla with an Italian kick, something I could make in my kitchen and nothing fantastic, but good quality ingredients were obvious and it's kind of the perfect munchie food.The ONLY reason this place gets 4 stars is because the service felt just a tad too slow and unattentive. And an offering of fresh parm for my pasta (never happened) would have taken the dish to amazing level.This is not enough to keep me away.They'll see more of me.

I had eaten at Il Passatore quite a few times and always loved everything about it - the food, the pace, the ambience, the service - and Testo maintains that same vibe.

We went pretty overboard, ordering about 5 or 6 dishes total - homemade pastas made with a lot of love, steak, a prosciutto flatbread dish, a delectable flan-like dessert, and a delicious bottle of red that came highly recommended by the owner.... Everything is very reasonably priced and the portions are just right. There are nice little perks like a glass of prosecco upon entering and a shot of homemade grapefruit vodka (moonshine?) after eating. We are happily full and agreed that it was a wonderful place for a long, intimate dinner.We will definitely be returning - they apparently will have outdoor seating in the summer so it will be a perfect spot for warm summer nights!PS - they deliver!",5.0

We got off at Lorimer, walked north towards Scholes st. , made a right and walked one block to Leonard. The restaurant is at the corner of Scholes and Leoanard. We were weary about going in at first because it was nearly empty with the exception of two women sitting at one of the tables. We were greeted very warmly by a male wait staff who gave us the option of sitting wherever we wanted. We were given 2 simple wooden menus. One with the food, the other was a wine list. We were given ample time to look through the menu and make our choices. The waiter was very patient in answering our questions. I  loved that he said the lasagna would take about 25 minutes to cook because it was made fresh to order. We got a soft complimentary bread, along with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. We ordered the mozzarella, arugula and tomato piadini. It was savory, without the salt. This was enough food to keep us busy till our entrees were ready.  The food came out wonderfully hot. My lasagna was heavenly. The correct ratio of sauce to cheese and veggies. I used the complimentary leftover bread to soak up the sauce. Yummy! My daughter ordered the ricotta and mushroom ravioli. It was cooked to perfection and the gorgonzola sauce was creamy, not pungent nor overpowering. I loved both dishes. I ordered red wine which was not served in a wine glass. I found it odd, but I figured it might be the Italian way. We ordered the Tiramisu, which came with some very deliciously fresh strawberries. Both the male and female waiters were attentive, but relaxed. Testo has a casual vibe, romantic enough for couples, but also welcoming to families. There are about twenty tables and it has outdoor seating.The space is small, but it doesn't feel crammed.The bathroom is very clean. Later that evening candles were lit.   At the end of our meal we received complimentary shots of limoncello. Wow! That surely cleansed my palate.This restaurant delivers high quality food and service at cheap prices. I highly recommend making the trip out to this hidden treasure. I did. I will probably be going back often. Another great find!",5.0
"We have been several times since they opened. I like that it is small and kind of plopped down in the middle of East Williamsburg. It's a little Italian oasis.  The servers and owner are friendly and accommodating and don't rush you at all. The decor is kind of rustic, not trying too hard but still classy.  We usually split the kale salad and then each get a vegetarian entree. We've enjoyed everything we've ordered here.  The prices are also quite reasonable.",4.0
"This is a great addition to the neighborhood.  The owner Max is a lovely guy, the salads are beautiful and original, the pasta is homemade, the fish is fresh and cooked perfectly, and a short but well chosen wine list (the Salento Primitivo is a great value at $26/bottle).  And to finish off the excellent meal, a lemoncello made in house that will send you home happy!",5.0
"This is my go-to place for take out pasta.  The strozzapreti is outstanding and always good.  I've also had lamb ragu and ox-tail ragu and both were outstanding.  Amazing, zesty olives are a great appretizer.  I've also eaten there for dinner and it's cute and cozy. Great atmosphere and friendly people.",5.0
The food here is very good. Great portions at a very reasonable price. Service is lacking but understandable in such a small dining space. Great addition to the neighborhood. A must.,4.0
"Awesome value - the chef is incredible, generous with portions, and even offer delivery.  I frequent as much as I can.",5.0
Have had dinner and brunch so far and both experiences exceeded my expectations at this small eatery in the restaurant needy area of East Williamsburg south of Grand street!  Service is friendly and attentive!  I believe this might be a spinoff of the highly successful Il Passatore at Bushwick and Metropolitan since the menus and preparations are quite similar!,4.0
"So happy to have such a cute, authentic new dining spot move into the hood. I had eaten at Il Passatore quite a few times and always loved everything about it - the food, the pace, the ambience, the service - and Testo maintains that same vibe. I went with the bf tonight for Valentine's Day. The service was friendly and warm - they tend to your needs but are not overbearing in the process. We went pretty overboard, ordering about 5 or 6 dishes total - homemade pastas made with a lot of love, steak, a prosciutto flatbread dish, a delectable flan-like dessert, and a delicious bottle of red that came highly recommended by the owner.... Everything is very reasonably priced and the portions are just right. There are nice little perks like a glass of prosecco upon entering and a shot of homemade grapefruit vodka (moonshine?) after eating. We are happily full and agreed that it was a wonderful place for a long, intimate dinner.We will definitely be returning - they apparently will have outdoor seating in the summer so it will be a perfect spot for warm summer nights!PS - they deliver!",5.0
"I adore this place and its sister restaurant, Il Passatore. The service is quick, the food is delicious, and best of all, it's cheap! My husband and I eat got 2 beers, bread and olive oil, a giant calamari appetizer, and two plates of pasta all for $50, plus a complimentary shot of lemoncello at the end of our meal. You really can't beat that. They have something for everyone, too - meaty sauces, vegetarian ravioli, creamy gnocchi, and healthier fare like steamed fish and Brussels sprouts salad. The food isn't necessarily transcendental, but it's really well done by people who obviously care about both the food and the customers, and I really appreciate that.",4.0

"This is why you live in a city.  This is why you live in New York.  And this is why you live here in Williamsburg.  Yes, this restaurant isn't prefect, and could probably be fine getting just 4 stars... But this is why I enjoy an experience like Testo and give it the 5 stars:- It's a neighborhood joint, nothing more nothing less... not a fancy location, not hyping itself, just a corner place- It offers exceptional food at remarkable prices.  Really good pasta in generous portions at prices you just can't find elsewhere- The ambiance is cozy, charming, and comfortable.  No pretense, but with thought put into it.  We had personal attention from the waiter/owner and the chef.  Our dishes came out fresh and promptly.  It lives up to its sibling Il Passatore as a casual, affordable, and authentic Italian experience.  For the time being it's BYO (but with a place like de Wine Spot just a few blocks away at Lorimer and Ten Eyck that's not a problem) and if Il Passatore is the guide, their eventual wine list will be very affordable.  A great addition- if you live anywhere near here, you'll want to visit, and make sure a neighborhood spot like this sticks around because it's what defines city living for me.",5.0
"I've been living in the East Williamsburg hood and have passed Testo several times. The menu is comprised of very affordable homemade Italian dishes and the location is perfect for a small cozy neighborhood restaurant and they finally have a beer/wine selection! My gf and I decided to try walk in service on NYE. They were all booked up w reservations but the owner was very accommodating and let us sit at the bar (main reason for the 4 stars). We started with the spinach salad special. It was a delicious simple salad w spinach & fruit ( pears & berries) with a light oil dressing. Very tasty, nothing too over the top. For entrees my gf ordered the Spicy pasta w half lobster for $15. The dish was delicious, steaming hot half lobster in the shell with homemade spaghetti and a spicy fra diavolo sauce, A fantastic dishl for the price.I ordered the butternut squash tortelli for 8$. Another extremely affordable and delicious dish prepared with homemade tortelli and a butter cream sauce that was to die for. Along with dinner we had a half caraff of house red for 14$ and for dessert the Panacotta, which left something to be desired but was still enjoyable. All in all we enjoyed our experience at Testo and was happy to find out they are the same owners of another of our favorite local eateries, Il Passatore. The owner was very accommodating and the environment felt right out of an Italian neighborhood bistro. We will be trying Testo again in the future.",4.0

"This was such an amazing find! My boyfriend and I lived in the neighborhood and it quickly became our favorite place.

"I had an awesome time at Testo! I met with my friends, who live in the area, and they have just recently discovered this neighborhood's gem. We stayed there for a long time, talking and enjoying our night out, and even long after our delicious meals were gone, we did not feel pressured to leave or to order more. The staff spoiled us rotten, being very friendly and attentive, but also giving us a lot of space.The decor of the place is simple yet charming and so soothing and cozy that we just did not want to leave! Now food...super yummy! I had squash raviolis that were so soft and fluffy, just melting in my mouth, hmm...I want more just writing about it. Too bad that I live in Queens but I will be back for sure. Summarizing: this place is a MUST! Outrageously good food, great atmosphere, super friendly staff and reasonable prices, should I say more? Highly recommended!",5.0
"Testo is a new Italian restaurant located in a quiet area in East Williamsburg where there aren't too many dining choices. Since they don't have a liquor license yet, you may BYOB -- always a wonderfully economical option. The food at Testo overall is excellent and the place is reasonable. I'm Italian American and I know Italian food -- and a great cook myself.  Because of that, I tend to be very picky and will not eat out in an Italian restaurant in the US unless I am confident the place will be good.  It was a pleasant summer evening, we ate at one of the tables outside, and had arugula salad, ravioli, and the chicken breast, followed by chocolate mousse and lemon sherbet.  Everything was good, especially the pasta. Considering the modest price and the off-the-beaten path locale, rest assured that you will eat well, it wasn't mobbed with annoying hipster jerks, and the service was pleasant.  Testo, buona fortuna!",5.0
