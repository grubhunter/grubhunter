"Was craving an acai bowl and heard they had good ones here. I kinda customized it. Coconut shreds, strawberries, granola and the almond butter on the side. It was delicious! I do think for the price it should be a larger size but whatever. I'm visiting and it was a nice treat. I walked around the cute neighborhood to check out the street art and shops....stopped in again  before heading home to get a latte.  If you can believe it....they use homemade almond milk! It really made it so special. Rich and creamy.  Perfect latte.",5.0
"We came here because of the high star rating on Yelp to have a chill breakfast and coffee and left unsure of why this place has a 4.5 star average rating.  Atmosphere is decent and quiet, but the prices are Manhattan-level for mediocre food with tiny portions.  Pao de Queijo, one of my faves, is not made fresh. It should be made fresh to order to maintain its chewy cheesy center - mine was pulled from a pastry window where it had been sitting who knows how long and then toasted. Not the same. AND it's $2.75 for a single (small) piece.My Brazilian breakfast was tiny and mostly black beans, and although it's not listed anywhere as vegetarian there's not a shard of bacon or beef on the menu. Coffee was nothing to write home about and also more expensive than higher quality coffee spots that roast their own. And even the juice I got, which I thought was their wheelhouse, was just ok.",2.0
"Acai Pitanga - don't look at price. It's worth it. It Made me happy, hope it does the same to you. Nice chill environment, comfy sofa to barstool to a working communal table. This is where you can be really productive and enjoy fresh food.",5.0
"Such a cute health-centered spot!  Felt like a light lunch today, so combined with my newfound desire to explore Brooklyn, I decided to make my way here to do some work and try it's popular acai bowls.  They're definitely better than most of the ones I've had in Manhattan, and even though they were smaller than I expected, I thought it was worth it.  Good wifi there for work, as well as a communal table.  On a sidenote, there's also a lot of street art on the way there, so that's worth checking out as well!",5.0
"Definetely a Brazilian theme happening there!!  I love pao de queijo and their homemade version is tremedous!  Acai bowl was also spot on to the best i have had in Rio.  They have a large selection of juices with very interesting ingredients.  The place has a real nice, laid back, vibe.  Good tunes, great people watching, and most important, my coffee was the best i have had in the hood.",5.0
"Really cute cafe in Bushwick. They seem to offer healthy options and had a variety of smoothies. Staff was very friendly. I came in right before closing but I was never rushed or told to leave which was very nice of them. I got the ginger iced tea, it was refreshing but a bit too strong. They have wifi and lots of outlets which is always a plus :)",4.0

"Absolutely love it. For the first time I had an Açai bowl ....man!! It's full with yumness! Wish I've explored all the other items in the menu. A bit on the pricy side, might not be your regular coffee place! It's a small set up, definitely a place for cozy hangout.",5.0
"Delicious coffee, beautiful space, friendly staff, and my absolute favorite granola on the face of the earth. I've been obsessed with the acai bowls topped with it for weeks. :)I also love the mosaic on the floor as you walk in. It's just like the sidewalks I saw in Curitiba, Brazil.",5.0
"I love to explore new coffee shops; and Pitanga was new in Bushwick neighborhood. Cozy atmosphere, friendly staff. The owner is consistent in applying her health beliefs into her food menu and juices. If you care to have fresh and organic food and juices, this is definitely your spot. For the same price or even less, instead a blueprint bottle or any other cold press juice from wholefoods, you can get a fresh made delicious smoothie or juice. *MUST TRIES: cheese bread (is to die for), Green monster smoothie (house special with avocado, dates etc) and if you are a coffee lover like me, give a try to the espresso smoothie they have on the regular menu, is superb!",5.0
"Delicious and high quality -- all of it  -- the coffee, flavorful juices, heavenly treats, and healthy hearty meals -- everything.   The owner seems like a pretty rad lady, and it's obvious she takes great pride in constantly changing/improving the food and decor, which is really inspiring to see.  Anyway, you should go!  But leave an electric outlet open for me, wouldjya?",5.0
"Went in for the first time the other day and am so glad to have this so close to the dog park! Great cappuccino and banana bread, which tasted vegan (in a good way). They layer sliced bananas on the top which sort of caramelizes as it bakes. Genius.I'm new to the neighborhood and have been looking for a regular coffee coffee spot--none have really stuck yet--and I think this is it.",5.0
Love this place and glad it's so close to home! An incredible fresh and healthy menu with lots of smoothie and juice options which I'm really excited about! They serve Kitten coffee and the barista was definitely skilled. I got my cortado with homemade coconut milk and it was well executed. The design of the place was incredible and made it warm and inviting. They only serve food until 4pm though but accommodated us when we arrived at 430 for our first visit. Great friendly customer service guys! Thanks for the amazing experience!,5.0
"This new little spot is adorable. The atmosphere is great and relaxing. The menu is pretty simple so far but solid. I'm enjoying a cold brew coffee, which is bold. They offer almond milk and sugar in the raw so I'm not feeling too guilty about indulging. The staff is very friendly and I've got a nice little spot by the window.",5.0
"Amazing juices, coffee, food and everything. These guys are pioneering the acai bowl game in bushwick too. Definitely get ready to drop some coin though, if you just want espresso and juice go to owl juice.",5.0

"Food and juices are good, but everything is overpriced by about $2-$3. Seriously, if you don't believe me-literally go one block over to Owl Juice Pub and the juices and sandwiches are just as tasty for an average of 2.50 cheaper per item. For that reason, I will not be going back.",3.0
