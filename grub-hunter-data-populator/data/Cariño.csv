"I live down the street from here, and I LOVE Mexican food, so I come here a lot, but mainly in the warmer months. For some reason I crave margaritas in the summer, but not so much in the winter. Also, I'm not a fan of sitting inside on busy nights, because it's always super loud. I think it's the acoustics or something. Speaking of margaritas, theirs are on point. I judge my margaritas by the color - the more yellow - the worse it is. Kind of like something else... I digress. Anyways, their margaritas are far from yellow, and really good. I always get it on the rocks, because that's how margaritas should be.As for the food, I've loved everything except for their gringo style/American tacos. I figured these would be like the taco kit style, but for some reason there were raisins mixed in with the meat. I hate raisins and never would have expected them to be in there. Also, it was a little bit greasy. I also wasn't a huge fan of the chicken burrito (steak burrito is better). It seems like they use rotisserie chicken type of meat and that included some of those chewy pieces. I've also had a couple of their salads, quesadillas, steak taco (love the nopales with it), shrimp tacos, and fish tacos and loved them all. We always get the guac which has pomegranate seeds. I thought that was weird at first, but now I love them. Their tortillas are also on point and they give you a couple with the guacamole. One thing I always forget is that they serve a brunch menu on the weekends until 4pm, and it's mainly breakfast type foods. If you want regular tacos, you need to come after that time.Service - always great! I usually see the same guys and they always have a smile on their faces, which makes me smile, because smiling is contagious.  :)",4.0
"I was craving Mexican and Carino was two doors down. Perfect!Despite being a fairly busy Friday night, we were able to be seated pretty quickly. My margarita was tasty and our service was great.We ordered the Elote (grilled corn) and guac & chips to start. The corn was fine, but it was missing something. Plus almost half of it was so burned that it was inedible. The chips and guac were great. I appreciated that they noticed we ran out of chips for our guac and brought more. What I'm not a fan of is that I even had to order chips. What Mexican restaurant doesn't give you chips? Some of the most elite restaurants give you bread and yet no chips here? Strange.Also strange was that our entrees did not come with rice or beans. We ordered a side of beans for $3. Tasty beans, but for the price of the entrees they should include this. Both of enchiladas were tasty and good portion.I'm glad that we tried it and had some great food, but if I lived in the area I would look for another place to become a regular.",3.0
"Ordered: Al PastorPros--The tacos were packed with flavor. Cons--The tacos were supposed to come with pineapple, but didn't. I was specifically told these tacos weren't spicy, and my mouth was on fire. I wish the tacos came with some kind of flavorful toppings instead of a few slices of radishes and thick leeks.",3.0
"I really enjoyed this place. The food was so fresh and tasty. The service was friendly and the place was casual and welcoming. We had the veggie Torta and the chicken Quesadillas. Both very, very good! I was actually surprised how delicious it was. Very simple, but so yummy. It sure did satisfied out Mexican food craving!",5.0
"Walked to this place after eating at freehold, was craving a michelada.   The staff were all very friendly and attentive.  We decided to try the jalapeños and the corn.I must have got a seed of something stuck in my teeth and tried to take it out with my tongue and all of sudden my mouth was absolutely on fire.  The pepper was totally edible for the first half but then I was in pain the rest of the time.   The corn was ok, not as good as El presidente in the city and I hate having to actually use my teeth to eat it. Michelada was decent.  Not the best but not the worst. I wish I could have enjoyed some of the tacos or other dishes but beware when eating jalapeños.   Ok!",3.0
"The food is really so good, have to say sensational. We stated with the he guacamole that had pomegranate seeds on top and chicken nachos both equally good and serving size big. My girls had chicken burritos whic they loved I had shrimp burrito ( amazing) and the hubster had  chicken enchiladas  omg so good  I had frozen margarita that was freaking good and the Flan... Ok it was so creamy and I wanted three of them haaaaa so go enjoy their food it is worth fighting for parking and the staff is great my only boo is that the lighting is to dark and you need a flash light to read the menu but yes goooooooooooolo",5.0
"First time here because my friend said they have to die for nachos.....so far so good. The drinks are great, I had the hibiscus margarita. They said they had a ""special"" cevice which came in a tall milkshake glass(super cute) but the taste didn't match the presentation. It consists of shrimp and tilapia that are topped with a couple pieces of avocado. The only thing is the juice they soaked it in took away whatever flavor once was. It lacks that garlicky flavoring that normally comes with a good ceviche. It was a great attempt but the juices were too overwhelming and I was disappointed. When I told one of the bartenders she asked if I wanted her to add more lime juice.......if I shook the glass I could drink the amount of excess juice that was present. When I told the male bartender he offered to exchange it or substitute. Maybe he should teach her customer service or maybe she shouldn't be too busy talking to friends that she doesn't care to entertain the other customers. I totally understand everywhere makes the dish different, as I order it all over the world all the time, however there is a standard. Besides this mishap, I would return and would just only want Andres as my server.  Gracias for muy bueno customer service.",4.0
"I've never been to this place before. I just happened to be riding my bike past here with my girlfriend who happens to have the last name Cariño.  Popped in, had a great mezcal pineapple drink and we ordered some tacos. Service was great we sat outside. It was a great day and a very happy popped in here randomly. I rarely ever write reviews however I thought this place was deserving",5.0
"Carino has the best enchiladas I've had in the city. They rival ones I've had in Colorado and New Mexico, so I was definitely impressed. I ordered the vegetable enchiladas suizas and the sauce was really incredible-- slightly hot and very rich. At $12, they are one of the cheaper entrees on the menu.A friend wanted to split a bottle of malbec (which was delicious) so I didn't get a margarita of my own but someone in my group did and he said it was very good. We were impressed by the selection of tequila and mezcal on the menu. The space was cute and they weren't too crowded while I was there. If you don't go for the veggie enchiladas like I did, it might be a pricier meal unless you go for the appetizers which looked delicious and were fairly priced. Still, I definitely recommend.",5.0
The quality of the meet is superb! The Shrimp Tacos are a must! I have never ever had shrimp tacos like these. Ive travelled to various cities in Texas and California and have yet to have shrimp tacos like these. Ok im done writing. Mas tacos por favor!!,5.0
"Came here for dinner with a friend while staying in Brooklyn. I had heard it mentioned and it was only 2 blocks from where we were staying so we decided to give it a try. It is a fairly small space inside which is uncomfortable when it comes to eating, you end up slightly cramped. I had the vegetable burrito which was a good portion and filled with beans, vegetables etc and it was pretty good. It had a decent amount of spice to it as well. My husband and our friend both did the taco combination with 3 tacos. They were really small portions, my husband was still hungry after eating his. We also ordered the guacamole and chips to start which were good but overly priced for what it is in my opinion. Overall it wasn't bad but I don't know that I would be excited to go back.",3.0

This place is great! I came here with E yesterday to celebrate the start of summer with frozen margaritas and it did not disappoint. Service was super friendly and the drinks were fairly priced.

"This place is completely charming. It's a small, beautifully decorated space with some great food. My date ordered one of the specialty margaritas and it was delicious - they put salt and chiles on the rim, and it was awesome. The food was reasonably priced, and I was definitely full a the end. Also the guacamole had just the right amount of spice, and came with pomegranate seeds in it. The staff was friendly and attentive. Great spot!",4.0
"Oh god, oh god what happened to this place. Maybe it's because it's winter. Food was not warm. Just not warm. Service was both attentive and shockingly ambivalent. I.e. Water glass was filled repeatedly but we were never asked to order a 2nd round of drinks (your money lost!) and had to beg for the bill. Please revert to your former glory. See you in spring, muchachos.",2.0
"Some of the greatest high end authentic Mexican in Williamsburg. Margaritas are off the wall good. The vibe is relaxed. Not sure about that one booth in the middle though. Kind of weird. Otherwise, this place is a Williamsburg staple that you must treat yourself to.",4.0
"I can't wait to return to Carino. First off, I love the name. Friends and I found this place early one Friday evening. Glad we got there early, because by the time we left, the place was packed! We had a few apps and entrees. We got the pork nachos, and the were amazing. Food is clean and authentic. I also ordered the cilantro margarita, which was close to perfection. Not too sweet, perfectly tart. Gotta say I was very pleased with this meal.",4.0

Definitely highly recommend this place.*update: came back a second time and are just as impressed. Tortillas made in house! If you like Mexican food, come here.

"We rarely go to Williamsburg, but were going to a party so we needed to grab a bite first. We went to Cariño on a friend's recommendation, and were blown away!  The service was fast and attentive, the ambience was warm and comfortable, and the food was out of this world!  The nachos are a must, as are the hanger steak enchiladas.  We are so glad we were able to experience Cariño, and we told our fellow party goers all about it!",5.0

"My friend and I came here because she had her dog with her so we could only sit outside - Carino is a cute little Mexican restaurant on the quiet side of Williamsburg and the waitress was really nice and attentive, but the food here was disappointing.  I thought it would be better because of the Yelp reviews, but I guess people on the East Coast don't know what truly good Mexican food tastes like compared to California where I grew up.  I ordered the Americano tacos (3 for $12), which was ground beef picadillo, cheddar, and a hard shell tortilla.  The beef was way too greasy - when I picked up the taco it just spilled all this orange grease all over.  The menu says cheddar cheese but they sprinkled a little bit of some white cheese.  They also had a soggy piece of lettuce on the bottom of the beef, which soaked up all the grease that didn't spill over.  There was some chipotle sauce, sliced radishes, lime wedges and two little grilled white globe onions (which were really good) on the side.  The plate itself was overpriced for what I got - I would've been happier with getting tacos from La Superior a few streets down for $1 cheaper each taco (and could've gotten a combination of different ones instead of 3 of the same).  I don't think I'll be back here, unless it was for happy hour drinks. Maybe. Actually....no I won't.",2.0
"The last thing I'd expect to eat on my trip to NY from CA is Mexican food. However, the place was near where we were staying, pretty empty for brunch on Sunday, and willing to reserve a large table for all of our friends. I'd be willing to eat pretty much any genre of food for that convenience considering what a headache weekend brunches can be. For brunch, they have plenty of egg/bean/cheese/tortilla combo options to please your hungover stomach. Think huevos rancheros and chilaquiles for days. I decided to go a different route and try a spicy beef stew. The soup wasn't as thick and hearty as you might expect from a traditional stew, but the flavors were wonderful and it was great option for those who weren't in the egg mood. Get a mechelada or a blood orange mimosa to wash it all down in style. Or if you're not in the mood for boozing, they make an amazingly creamy and rich cafe con leche with organic, fair trade coffee. While I'm still partial to California style Mexican food, I think Cariño does an amazing job and is a great choice for a no-fuss brunch. I recommend it!",4.0

Why waist space when it's so easy to make good Mexican and we need a GOOD Mexican spot here!?Chilaquiles were soggy soup vs slightly crunchy. Served JUST with eggs for $12 is way too steep. It's only tortilla chips and sauce people. Not even beans? I added chicken, which is how it's often served, and the bill was almost $20! I get this dish for wayyy less in Manhattan! And it tastes better. Staff was really nice though.Meh.",1.0
"Carino was AMAZING. The waitstaff was so friendly and knowledgeable, the veggie empanadas were one of my top three things I ate this year, the cafe con leche with Chiapas coffee was so creamy and delicious. The churros, chile rellenos special, elote, and sopa de lima were out of control great! Everyone should go here with no hesitation. Enjoy the sidewalk seating when you go!And to our waiter who was commuting home to Staten Island, thanks and we hope you beat the rain!We will be back!",5.0
"Food is good, not super but good, I like the tacos,nice atmosfere and the service is friendly and welcoming,  I would give 4 stars if they had a better decor, over all a good place to get good mexican food in a casual environment.",3.0
I came here a while back with a friend of mine and my girlfriend my friend was very close with the staff so out service was nothing short then perfect! The food was OMG delicious I ordered a Carne Asada type of plate and a Michelada. Everything was made to perfection never have I seen such attention to detail! We received complementary calamari from our server because I repeat he was close to one of us (I wonder if we would have gotten the same service had my friend not been there) I would sure like to think so because I hold this place very high up in my Authentic Mexican food places!,5.0

"I checked the reviews before choosing this place for lunch on a Friday afternoon, and I was a bit disappointed.We HAD to try the guac, since it was so raved about, and it really fell flat for me. It was a bit bland and I got a stale chip. I also tried the Chicken Soup, and it was literally a drumstick in a bland broth. Maybe I should've tried a taco, but it was chilly and I though at least some veggies in the soup would be nice.Also, happy hour starts right at four, despite us coming in at 3:30.Not impressed.",3.0

The variety of margs are a-okayyyy-- jalapeño, hibiscus, cilantro, etc etc. Tbh I find myself ordering more than one. The nachos are great, as are the tacos. Good variety of rotating specials keep the menu fresh. Fun spot and you also have the option of sitting outside when the weather is tight.",4.0
"Guacamole and chips...delish!  The guac was creamy, perfectly seasoned with fresh hot chips.  The hot chipotle salsa was a perfect accompaniment to the coolness.  The eggs and beans were cooked to perfection with 3 hot corn tortillas on the side.  Had the old fashioned Mexcal as a drink. Could have used more flavor.",4.0
"I had high hopes for this place, but am sorry to say I ended up kind of disappointed. It could be that I walked in with the wrong kinds of expectations, or maybe I'm just not used to the price/quality/quantity ratio in Williamsburg. I went with a friend last night, and when I got there I loved the fact that the French doors were wide open to the outdoor sidewalk seating, and other than the ceiling fans, very comfortable levels on the AC! I always freeze when I go out to eat. The host was super-friendly, and convinced me to try their drink special of the day, a mojito. I usually don't like mojitos but this one was pretty good; I was a little less enthusiastic to later learn that the ""special"" aspect didn't apply to the price too though. I liked the frozen margarita a lot, the drinks are good but not too strong which was nice.The big disappointment was with my entree though. I ordered a taco trio, of Rajas con Crema, and while they were tasty enough...they were so little! Maybe I made a mistake, and the tacos are supposed to be an appetizer to share or something. Each taco was the size of a silver dollar pancake, and the filling was so meager I could barely taste it within the soft corn tortillas. Just a couple of beet slices and baby onions as a garnish. I usually don't order appetizers at restaurants because it's too much food for me in combination with the entree, but after the three tiny tacos I definitely didn't feel anywhere close to satiated. I feel like I might try giving this place a try again in the future, but just for one drink (their drink menu is impressive and worth coming back for) and I'll be more wise to the portion sizes for the different options.",3.0
Love this place! Excellent friendly service! The guac is out of this world. Tacos are never a mistake. Margaritas are very tasty too! Stumbled upon this place for a bday dinner and loved every moment. They have outdoor seating as well - which is a plus! A must for Mexican!,5.0

"I am in love with this place. You'd never expect it, but there are a handful of cozy yet very cool restaurants in this less traveled corner of Billysburg. After a long day at work, my BF said, ""I want to take you out to dinner tonight,"" and that's how we ended up at Cariño, which is only a five minute walk from home. The restaurant definitely has a sexy date-night ambiance, with its soft music, wooden furniture, and candle lighting. It is very dark in there. You'll definitely be seeing stars after a few drinks. No, seriously - the decor includes a bunch of huge neon stars hanging over the bar.The Jalapeños con queso are amazing. It doesn't look like much, just two peppers stuffed with cheese. Lemme just say, your tastebuds will dance with delight if you like spice. The peppers were actually quite hot, and I don't know what kind of cheese it was, but again...uh-mazing.I was thirsty but not for alcohol, so I asked for a glass of horchatas (a sweet rice milk drink), which was not on the menu, but they made it for me anyway. Very refreshing and cinnamon-y. The pork and pineapple tacos I ordered were tasty, a good balance of savory and sweet. But I was secretly fuming that I didn't follow the BF's lead in ordering one of the specials of the night. The porkbelly carnitas dish stole the show. It wasn't greasy at all, and was perfectly seasoned, with just a light crisp to the edges of the meat. Even though you're chomping into huge cubes of pork fat, you aren't thinking about how your arteries are probably being clogged up with each bite. Instead, you're thinking, ""Damn, I wish this was a regular menu item so I could come back every week and eat it.""",4.0

It was cozier more romantic and lacked the host of shady faux hipster yuppie characters that sometimes line the tables of la Superior.  Im a hipster myself but I dont like annoying ones  There were a couple of tables for outdoor seating out front.  So you have to pay for your chips here, But i don't have a problem with that.  Guac was good , so were the salsas.  we ordered margarita of the day, grilled pinapple.  i ordered a aqua fresca mango.  So you know it is a great sign when the drinks taste and actually are made of fresh fruit !!!! I knew from there it was going to be a delicious night.  I ordered the chorizo quesadilla.  it was the best ive ever had !  the tortilla was hand made ! we also ordered seafood chile relleno, which was a special.  their specials seem to conceal higher prices but after you take a bite, you suddenly realize it is actually special ! the seafood was rich and the sauce the chile was sitting in was devine!  Rarely can i not make out ingredients but i was stumped.  Well its just an excuse to go eat there again then !  the out of towner had the enchiladas and they proclaimed that the dish was ""life-changing"".

"What a cute, cozy Mexican place in a neighborhood I love.  Carino sports a friendly staff, and good, homegrown Mexican fare. Ingredients are very fresh, high quality...the food is simple but somehow really refreshing.  Thanks Blackboard Eats for helping me discover this new favorite spot in the 'burg!I came on a Saturday night at 8:30 with 3 others; we shared the jalapenos with cheese (not fried- just fresh peppers cut open with melted cheese), good creamy, simple, purist guacamole (bits of pomegranate were in it) and house made tortilla chips.  We also had elote, my favorite Mexican grilled corn with mayo and paprika (thought I do prefer this to be a bit cheesier.. Pinche Taqueria anyone?)For dinner, we all had the enchiladas (well one of us..the chicken), and tacos: fish and chorizo. I had the fish; they were fried but not greasy at all because they were fried at the right temperatures.  All green tortillas, and supporting lettuce, etc were super fresh.As for drinks, I enjoyed my spicy michelada (choice of tecate- it was spicy!), and my friend seemed to like the margarita.   The one disappointment of the evening was our dessert- it was a chocolate tres leche cake which was way too dry. Service was warm, fast, and polite.  I see a lot of groups like to come here for celebrations, but, note the place is small and pretty tight. You can opt for bar seating if you must. Prices are also really reasonable; came to $20 per person.",4.0

"I was in Brooklyn trying to meet my friends at Miss Favelas for the Brazil vs Columbia game. Saw how crowded it was, said ""forget it"" and tried to find another place nearby. LUCKILY, less than 2 blocks away, we found this charming little bar/restaurant. The bartender was so friendly. During the game they had margaritas for $5. Tasty and strong. Two TV's by the bar which made it perfect viewing. It got crowded but never rowdy. My friend and I ordered the nachos and the fried plantains with cream. The nachos were absolutely delicious. The portion was a little small for the price ($8). I would say an order of nachos is only enough for one person. But the taste was amazing so we didn't mind. The plantains were also good. However, the menu description did say fried and these weren't that crispy. A little soggy. The crema was fantastic though.

"Seriously? Seems like things have gone way downhill. I paid 86 dollars (tip included) 2 drinks, 6 tiny tacos and guac. What was the most memorable part of my meal? Probably the drinks. Possibly the tortillas that came with the $10.00 guacamole. Ridiculous. The tacos had very little flavor. Shrimp tacos were in one of the most uninspired sauces I've ever tasted. I have absolutely no reason to return and would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. Two stars for the friendly service.",2.0
"The BEST flan in NYC area. My lord, delicious and not too sweet. Has an artisanal custard taste that took me back to Espana. No joke at all. I sometimes come back just for that alone.

"Came here for lunch on a Thursday. The ambiance was nice, pretty decor with, traditional Mexican accents and a few outdoor seating available.

I didn't even notice the place which is situated right by my local laundromat until I decided to check it out one day. Highly recommend the veggie tacos with squash and the shrimp tacos.

"I don't know why this place isn't ever more crowded, it's so fantastic!  I've been coming here for years and joined yelp today just to leave them a review.  Granted I do love that I never have to wait for a table... but I'd rather see them appreciated and successful-- come here!!They seriously know their tequila (& their jalapeño margarita is gorgeous).  The guacamole has never been anything less than amazing.  The chilliquilles on weekends are to die for (try 'em with pork on top).  I haven't tried every single thing on the menu, but what I've had has never disappointed.  The Cariño salad is amazing with it's fresh hint of jalapeño (and again, you can order topped with pork, which is obvs my favorite).There are other tasty enough places around but I'll add that the atmosphere is also a total win- and in atmosphere I wanna give specific props to the very friendly, inclusive and knowledgeable staff!  There's another resturant nearby where you wouldn't be treated so ""superiorly"".",5.0
"Seriously? Seems like things have gone way downhill. I paid 86 dollars (tip included) 2 drinks, 6 tiny tacos and guac. What was the most memorable part of my meal? Probably the drinks. Possibly the tortillas that came with the $10.00 guacamole. Ridiculous. The tacos had very little flavor. Shrimp tacos were in one of the most uninspired sauces I've ever tasted. I have absolutely no reason to return and would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. Two stars for the friendly service.",2.0
"The BEST flan in NYC area. My lord, delicious and not too sweet. Has an artisanal custard taste that took me back to Espana. No joke at all. I sometimes come back just for that alone. Also, my favorite over here are the vegetable enchiladas. A farm fresh feel with the comfort flavors from the cheese and the tortillas. Service is precise, courteous, and fast here as well. A well run spot in south Williamsburg that can compete with any Hispanic cuisine any place in the city.",5.0

"CALIFORNIAN REVIEW:  While visiting from Los Angeles, where great Mexican food abounds, I was invited here and fell in love with the wonderful food, the ambiance, and Carino's super nice staff.  I had the fish tacos (there are several varieties... try the one with black bean puree and carrot slaw), and the plantains.  Both were excellent.  The fresh salsa with the pom seeds was exceptional and pleasingly hot. The only drawback that keeps them from getting five stars from me was mediocre margaritas.  (Yes, I still had two.)  Yet, without a doubt, I'm definitely coming back the next time I'm in NYC.",4.0
"When I walked in and saw $4 tacos, I was sold, especially because this place is located on my street. I ordered one sauteed fish and one shrimp. I will say, you get what you pay for. The tacos were tiny, though very tasty. The shrimp had just the right amount of spice. The fish was flavored well, but I've had better fish tacos. I also ordered the plaintians w/crema. Being half central american, I have a huge affinity for crema. Used to put the stuff on everything growing up. I liked the style they had (regionally, they can taste different) and the plaintains were nothing to praise, but were still tasty. I would have been perfectly content with the pricing, save that their computers were down (I believe it was a network failure occurring to online marketplaces down the entire coast). I had to therefore go to ATM next door, pay a service fee, and still pay the entire bill. Now THAT made the food not seem worth it. The waitress was nice enough, but hardly attentive, thought to be fair there was another rather large group as well. I'd like to try the place again, though I doubt I really will.",3.0

They are GREAT. Guajillo roasted pork, grilled pineapple, avocado sauce and crema...they are bursting with porky flavor, and god does that pineapple combo do it for me.  I just wish they were a bit bigger for the price. I had the soup and two tacos, and it just wasn't enough. $3.50 (or $4.50 for the barbacoa) is too much to pay for a taco that takes two real bites to eat (or 6 tiny little bites because I'm trying to savor the flavor).",4.0

"Meh, not impressed.  Started out with a margarita.  It was STRONG (pro) but not very good; it didn't taste fresh and limey (con).  The guacamole was average.  It was a bit bland, could have used more salt and/or lime juice.  The nachos were NOT good. I've had better nachos at chain restaurants.  They were lacking flavor & freshness.  The jalapeno slices were from a can or a jar. The chips were mushy on the bottom &  melted together with globs of cheese. Also, the chips did not appear to be house made, but rather from a bag.  Oh, and no complimentary chips & salsa to start the meal, wtf??The chorizo taco was quite tasty, I should have ordered more than one and skipped the other stuff.

"Get the fish tacos!   Best ever!  My friend and I came here before heading over to the Grand Victory on a Saturday night.  So, for a saturday night, yes it was packed, but we came in at about 7:30, and we we sat right down and service never lagged.  Now what I like most about this place, is that it is an obviously family owned operation.    There are no flakey, hipster servers, nor even any specific roles of the staff at this place.  They all apear to be related, mexican (at least by appearance and sounds  of their linguistics), and were all super nice in a great no-nonsense, but super sweet, family way.    Our server could have been easily been mistaken for a [well fed] bus-boy else where, but I wanted to give him a big hug on the way out for how he took care of us, always with a smile, and then off to elsewhere in the restaurant.  Now for a saturday night, like I said it was busy.  The place is pretty small and packed, not-so-quiet, music is playing, and its pretty dark, but we loved it.  We were looking for some good mexican food, in an easy, casual setting, and we scored with this place.  We shared a smorgasbord of tacos, and I'll have to say, that was a good way to go.    We loved all of them, but the fish ones sort of stood out from the rest.    They had a great emanada appetizer that was on special that was amazing too.   And my margarita - one of the strongest I've ever had.  It was great, but it was all i needed for the night!  Overall, a great, friendly, casual, cool place to get some great mexican and feel like you're a friend of the family here.    You'll leave here with a smile.",5.0

Porque, they don't just serve tacos. They have an extensive menu, with frequent culinarily adventurous specials and amazing plated meals. The appetizers are great, particularly the guacamole and the stuffed jalapenos, and they also have gourmet cocktails, with really nice tequilas and amazing ingredients. I love the pina, which is a tequila-based drink with a chili rim. You can also get all kinds of tequila on the rocks as well, or just beer and wine.The tacos there are out of this world, and about 50 cents more than your average truck-price. Particularly amazing are the fish taco and the azteca. The fish taco is fluffy and crispy breaded fish with amazing spicy mayo or whatever magical sauce they put in there. The azteca is a steak taco with absolutely perfect steak in it. All of the tacos that they have there are really unique, artful and creative.I feel like this restaurant would pass the Grandma Test, which is when you pick a grandma who's made the type of cuisine that is served all her life (and perfectly), and if they like it, it's good. I feel like this place is authentic, well-executed and homey, so it would pass. Grandmas know good food, no matter where in the world...So considering that it won't break the bank, and considering how tasty all of their food is, I need not try to hard to sell Carino. I guess I need not even mention the happy hour, the late night happy hour, the brunch, the blog that announces all of their specials, or the fun events they've done such as the Negra Modelo food pairing event that came with a free appetizer when you ordered a beer.

Grandmas know good food, no matter where in the world...So considering that it won't break the bank, and considering how tasty all of their food is, I need not try to hard to sell Carino. I guess I need not even mention the happy hour, the late night happy hour, the brunch, the blog that announces all of their specials, or the fun events they've done such as the Negra Modelo food pairing event that came with a free appetizer when you ordered a beer. By the way, my mom and her friends just loved the waiter there, the service is excellent.",5.0

"This was kind of a find off of Berry.  Had been searching for an alternate place for dinner, as my friends just like to go to the same old.  As there are a million new places popping up in willy B, I was in the mood to try this place.Walk up to the bar, and my friend is already there.  Quickly order a frozen mojito to catch up.  Wow did that hit the spot.  Chips & salsa are on the way.I ordered tacos as my main, three small soft corn shell tacos with mixed veggies came out.  Superb and tasty.  And not smothered in various creams and other things I don't want.  They were a bit on the small side, if I had any complaint at all.  I could have had six of them easily!",4.0
"This is my favorite Mexican food in Brooklyn. My boyfriend and I go there for our self entitles ""Nacho Sundays"". The Elote is amazing, tacos are yummy and the Chicken Enchiladas have a killer sauce. Huge variety of tequilas and Cocktails. I love the Hibiscus Margarita and the Jalapeno Margarita.

"Best Mexican in Williamsburg hands down.. Ive been coming to this place since its former location on Bedford Ave when it was called Bonita and nothing has changed.. The food is authentic and the margaritas are awesome.. If you like spicy stuff, like really spicy, ask for a side of the habenero salsa.  Its so good.. Besides the amazing food, the staff and ownership is the best of any place in Williamsburg.. They always remember you and come and shake your hand.. They are so polite and offer such good service.  If I had to think of a draw back hear it would have to be the size of the taco's.. There are really good, but if you're hungry I suggest ordering 5 or 6 of them..  Its better to get a few of them to share with the table as well as your own entree..",5.0

"Well. After reading the reviews, I was eager to try this place out. It's an unpretentious space, simply decorated, not going for some sort of asinine Williamsburg vibe (indeed, the FDNY was busy packing back some food, so we knew the place served something tasty). The background music varied from classic Grunge to Reggae. It wasn't too loud and it wasn't too quiet. Just right. Matter of fact, the dominant note of Cariño seemed to be one of ominous build up... there was an air of accomplishment. The space did not need clutter or nonsense. It was obviously the home of someone who knows how to cook. The service was attentive and cheerful, which is always a positive.We went to Cariño on a weekday, and so were able to easily get a table at noon. We started with some guacamole and chips, a pint of draft Pacifico and a Mexican coke. The pint glass was super duper thick and chilled, a nice little touch that really accentuated the delight of a cold pint on a 90 degree day.Instead of going for any substantial dishes, we decided to limit ourselves to tacos. Yes, the serving size is small, but this is a real restaurant, NOT a freaking Chili's. You're not going to waddle up to a trough of swill. If you want a wretched deep-fried chimichanga the size of your puffy thigh, don't waste your time. At Cariño, you're going to get small portions of truly amazing quality food. And another thing... quit hating on the $3.50 to $5.00 charged for a single taco wrapped in a single corn tortilla. For one, it's a better taco than you've ever had in your entire life, and for two, you would never ever balk at paying $4 for a single mediocre tapas, would you? Okay. So I had five different tacos: crispy fish, pork belly, lamb, roasted pork, and poblano (Rajas con Crema). Then we had another pork belly taco. Astonishing. Amazing. I think that next time I'd probably give the guac a  pass (it was good, but not as good as the tacos) and try to cram down maybe four or five  extra pork belly tacos.We finished up with flan.

"Yum, Yum, Yum! I think my pants are still tight from my Saturday night at this wonderful little place. I should add that I went with a friend who is a regular and boy did we get royal treatment, BUT I don't think it was limited to just us. I think anyone who goes there regularly will be treated the same - that is what is called AMAZING customer service! Anyhow, there were 8 of us, the place was oh, so crowded. I mean not a table was available the entire time we sat there. We started out with margaritas, nachos (TO DIE FOR!), and chips with guacamole. I was way too into the nachos to even bother with the guacamole, but from the little bite I did have I liked it. So on to the goods...the food. I had so much food, it's disgusting, BUT I didn't want to miss anything. I ordered the rice with black beans which was so freaking good my mouth is watering as I type. I also ordered three tacos: crispy fish (FAVORITE!), chorizo (good, probably my least favorite), the rajas con Crema which has poblano rajas, crema, oaxaca cheese, salsa verde (tied for FAVORITE!). The rajas taco is on the spicy side, so I recommend you order one an d keep water by your side. It is delicious, though! We then had shots of tequila and dessert - the flan and the chocolate mousse. The chocolate mousse is for serious chocolate lovers. It's good, but it's too much for me. The flan on the other hand-FREAKING DELICIOUS! It's like the flan my mother makes-definitely eggy and caramely and just melts in your mouth as soon as it hits your tongue. GET IT. Love it.

"There's been a bit of a hole of good sit-down Mexican food in Williamsburg since the standby, Bonita, shuttered it's doors last year. Cariño fills this void pretty well. The decor leans a bit more Caribbean with it's bright colors, but it's still got an authentic feel. The seating is a bit tight, so it can get packed pretty easily. The food is your standard upscale Mexican fare. Tacos, tortas, grilled corn, etc... nothing really groundbreaking. However, Cariño's strength is not in it's innovation, but rather it's execution. The carnitas and carne asada tacos are excellent and the Elote is even better than the street vendors, which is actually a pretty big compliment. The food is delicious and well worth the trip to the southside.",4.0

"Ive ordered from Carinos before but  don't know what happened this time. We got our tacos and I have NEVER EVER seen tacos so small in my life.

I called them and had them pickup the food and refund my money (which they have not done yet and its been 4 days, looks like im calling chase) and I have never done that in my life. I rarely ever even send back food in a restaurant, I am just flabbergasted by how small these tacos are for $3.50!

The food is really good. My only deal is it is a bit pricey -- but good quality for sure. The enchiladas were $12 and didn't come with any rice or beans or anything. I came home and had to eat more :/The friend I went with agreed and said the margarita was really good as well.,4.0

The chocolate mousse is for serious chocolate lovers. It's good, but it's too much for me. The flan on the other hand-FREAKING DELICIOUS! It's like the flan my mother makes-definitely eggy and caramely and just melts in your mouth as soon as it hits your tongue. GET IT. Love it. Lick your lips after.The restaurant is a bit small and a bit loud, so you'll definitely be yelling over each other if you go on a Saturday night like we did. However, it is all worth it for the food.",5.0
"You will LOVE the enchiladas and tacos!  The guacamole is also outstanding as well as the daily specials.  Super friendly servers, a charming little patio and an amazing 11pm-midnight Happy Hour!",5.0
"There's been a bit of a hole of good sit-down Mexican food in Williamsburg since the standby, Bonita, shuttered it's doors last year. Cariño fills this void pretty well. The decor leans a bit more Caribbean with it's bright colors, but it's still got an authentic feel. The seating is a bit tight, so it can get packed pretty easily. The food is your standard upscale Mexican fare. Tacos, tortas, grilled corn, etc... nothing really groundbreaking. However, Cariño's strength is not in it's innovation, but rather it's execution. The carnitas and carne asada tacos are excellent and the Elote is even better than the street vendors, which is actually a pretty big compliment. The food is delicious and well worth the trip to the southside.",4.0
"I came here with a friend, and had the carne asada enchilada. It was really delicious! I'd definitely come back here. The tortilla chips with the guacamole were absolutely yummy. I have to say, the staff here is extremely friendly and very attentive. The ambiance is wonderful. Coming here at night is so nice. I'll definitely be back!",4.0
"Ive ordered from Carinos before but  don't know what happened this time. We got our tacos and I have NEVER EVER seen tacos so small in my life. I know they are small, but this was just absurd.Our entire office was standing around laughing at how small they were. I called them and had them pickup the food and refund my money (which they have not done yet and its been 4 days, looks like im calling chase) and I have never done that in my life. I rarely ever even send back food in a restaurant, I am just flabbergasted by how small these tacos are for $3.50! I also remembered there being more than just meat on the tacos, maybe im wrong, but there was nothing, which made it even more laughable.",1.0
"Love at first taco.I happened upon this little used to be hole-in-the-wall by chance, and I'm very pleased that I did.  When I first moved to the area, Carino had cheap-as-crap tacos with a limited menu.  Within a few months, it changed it's entire menu (keeping the staples, adding amazingness), and while they raised their prices a bit, it doesn't seem to have effected their business.  The staff is super friendly, the menu is awesome (my favorites are the chicken tacos and the fried fish tacos - holy mouth orgasm, Batman), their bar is stacked, they always have soccer on (big draw!), and they have this magical green salsa that rocked my world.  Plus, they deliver.  I'm here once a week.  Carino has my heart.",5.0
The food is really good. My only deal is it is a bit pricey -- but good quality for sure. The enchiladas were $12 and didn't come with any rice or beans or anything. I came home and had to eat more :/The friend I went with agreed and said the margarita was really good as well.,4.0
The place to taco is my favorite ... The pork crackles on your mouth while leaving a succulent after taste.. The jalapeño and guacamole compliment the pork adding a cool and hot flavor and finally the lime brings out all the flavored in a overall extravagant experience,5.0
"amazing, authentic, delicious cuisine. They just started serving taco's a la carte & they are knockout. We had to get our usual huevos rancheros and chilaquiles, but made sure to try some of the new taco's selections. The tacos themselves were warm and fresh. They make them in house. and the filing.. YUM. We ate the Placero, with pork crackling and pickled jalenpenos, and also the chorizo with salsa de guajillo.  I wish I could have eaten more, it was so delicious. This place is a treasure. Get here before it blows up, cause it will & then we will be missing the days I didn't have to wait for a table.",5.0
"I was excited to try this place based on all the great Yelp reviews.  After eating there I was left wondering how it got all of the 4 and 5 star reviews.  It was just....ok to not so great in my opinion.  Space and Service: The space itself is fine - pretty non-descript and non-memorable.  The service was definitely a highlight.  Our waiter was extremely friendly and attentive.  Drinks: I got a house margarita, which was on happy hour special.  I didn't finish it.  It was extremely strong but also extremely unflavorful.  After the first sip I wished I went with the wine instead.  It's a good thing we didn't have to pay full price for it.Food: I ordered the nachos.  These get one out of five stars.  The chips were definitely out of a bag and the toppings were definitely out of a can - including soggy canned carrots???  Carrots on nachos?  Ummm.....???  Also they didn't offer the option of fake meat.  That's just me though - being a vegetarian, places that offer fake meat topping for their nachos are always 5 stars in my book.  I also got a side of plaintains with crema.  These get 3.5 stars.  They could have been crispier on the outside and plus I had to ask for salt to put on top of them.Music: They were playing some horrific commercial country music when we walked in.  Luckily that nightmare changed into something more palatable about halfway through our meal. I don't think I'd return here with all of the other restaurants the neighborhood has to offer.",2.0
"Everything here is good, but my mouth is way too wide to be satisfied.A taco is inhaled like a line of carnitas off a Mexican mule and plummets into the deep abyss of Tijuana called my stomach.I would arguably say this is the best Mexican restaurant in the BURG but not sure why I have to pay $20-25 for a couple of tacos and a beer--they should at least throw in some Pepcid AC as their mints.",4.0
"I have no idea what everyone else sees in this place, it was less than mediocre and overpriced... and out of key Mexican ingredients.They were out of Negro Modelo. They were out of guacamole. The chips were flavorless and stale. I ordered the fish taco on recommendation of the waitress, and got a British fish-n-chips quality flavorless, greasy, deep fried piece of fish. It was topped with iceberg lettuce. A mayonnaise based sauce, and parsley. No grilled, or even lightly fried flaky delicious fish. No spicy sauce. No cilantro. Nothing that would make this a Mexican dish other than the tortilla it was wrapped in.My girlfriend got the steak enchiladas. They were slightly better, but also suffered from dramatic under flavoring and were served in a greasy cheddar cheese sauce.The only things worth saving were the three salsa's that were served before the meal.",1.0
"Yummy says my tummy.  I've been here twice now and both times have thought: ""mucho bueno!"" They have a simple menu, but mix it up with great specials.  I'm so sad that their made-to-order ceviche isn't there everyday!  Between the specials and their solid standards, this place should be visited.  I even like that it's off the beaten path.  If a Mexican restaurant of this quality were on Bedford in the heart of Williamsburg, I'd have to make a reservation, or worse, wait on the street. I'd also like to give them some credit for their margarita and cute ambiance.  I give Cariño: dos pulgares para arriba!

Found Carino with the Yelp app. Saw photos of what looked like what fresh guac would look like in NYC. ...We ordered the special guac for the night which came with three different peppers (salsas): jalopenos, habaneros, and chipotle. The guac did come in a guacamole container, but it wasn't table-side. I believe it wasn't even made in the container. It came with chips surrounding the inside of the container and the guac was in the middle. The sides of the container were clean. The guac was ok. A bit mushy, but not bad. If we happen to come here again, would just try the regular guac.Elote was alright. The lime soup was really a chicken soup with a quarter slice of lime that you can squeeze in, not very limey. The gorditas here are actually very similar to their picaditas. They're like two picaditas stuck together like a sandwich. Except, the picaditas had beans, and I didn't know it came with beans. The waiter suggested us to order the picaditas instead of the tacos, but if we knew they were basically the same thing as their version of the gorditas, we would have ordered tacos. The masa was a bit hard. Maybe over crisped.Nice that they have Mexican micro-brew beers. Which we had.",3.0

"Ahhh...so many ways to begin. You know when you leave a place and can't just shut the hell up about it? That's me after dinner tonight. Before I get into the food, I want to rant a tiny bit on something that's been bothering me, regarding Bonita. You all know Bonita, that lovely little joint on Bedford that was a little bit overpriced and a tad on the safe side? It was owned by the same folks who own a couple other joints in the neighborhood. Joints that are often raved about, but I've always felt a bit of a letdown. Marlow & Sons and Diner. Perfectly capable restaurants, but never anything to write home about. I learned tonight that since Bonita has closed its beige tiled doors, the managers have left the aforesaid W-burg food conglomerate and opened this joint on their own.All I can say is that I think a wonderful tiger has been set free from her cage. The food at Carino is sensational, inventive, honest, and smart. I don't care that they didn't have a liquor license, as I instead sipped the most refreshing blended cucumber water that has graced this earth. The guacamole was fiery and sharp, the chips fried moments earlier. A mole enchilada that blew every other one I've ever had out of the ocean. Darker than unrefined crude, almost licorice-like in its meaty spicy sweetness. Delicate fresh shavings of cilantro and onion atop its smoldering sheen. My sweetheart had a delicate chicken on the bone dish, cooked with potatoes, jalapeño juice, mushrooms, and carrots.I know, you're gonna rant about how you lived in California and had all this great Mexican food while ghost-riding your scraper bike, but this place took me to the heights.Are they finding their footing? Sure they are! Who cares! I just hope and pray it works out and stays solvent. It was like I won a game. The  food, a waiter who I wanted to buy a beer for, lovely walls and mirrors. But the greatest treat of all is the owners. They took their old place and ran with it, cutting the cord that choked them back in the Bonita days. It is theirs and theirs alone.",5.0
"From the people who brought you Bonita comes the Carino Cantina, a delicious Mexican restaurant in South Williamsburg. I'd be lying if I said the drinks weren't the best part about this place - amazing Margaritas, as well as a rotating menu of specialty drinks. True, tacos and burritos are a bit more expensive, but they're worth every penny.I'd recommend Ricardo's Guacamole. a refreshing version of the using the papalo herb. Very tasty. I had the Rajas tacos and they were also stupendous. Now that I know Carino is so close to home, I don't have to go to Woods to get my taco fix.",5.0
"4 stars easy!!!!!! I missed Bonita but this is even better! It is much more spacious than Bonita and has booths and private tables and not communal dining like Bonita. I hated that! One bad thing about posting pictures on Yelp is people recognize you. A guy kept staring at me and I am the type that does not even recognize celebrities much less someone  whose picture I have seen from Yelp. But then again maybe he was just a pervert. About the food, awesome! Best Mexican corn that I have had in NYC, The last one I had at Cascabel Taqueria  was okay but not as flavorful. The one at Carino had more chili powder on it. Delicious! The Gorditas was delicioso also!  The fish tacos taste like they were made in California. The food was clean tasting too. Who would have thought eating head cheese tacos would be so good! (it was a special so they might not have it when you go)The fatty pieces of face pork were succulent, the sweet ramps were fantastic. The tomatillo sauce was so good, you could drink it with a straw! The pink drink in the picture is a watermelon juice. I liked the restaurant itself. It was not freezing cold the way many restaurants are. The doors were open and the summer air was keeping the room cool not ice cold! For me that is a plus! A big huge plus! For me the only negative was the menu is limited. But the specials make up for it. Service was warm and friendly even though they were quite busy. Good Mexican  food in NYC is rare so when I am craving Mexican this is another good option.

"In the right situation I would give Carino 5 stars, but I hail from California so I can't quite do it.The chicken soup is particularly delicious and great for a hangover, plus very reasonably price.  Anything with their steak is great, and my vegetarian friends enjoy the rajas.The people are also extremely nice!",4.0
"The reason people don't go to this spacious friendly restaurant is because it's ok but mostly it's so over-priced.

I had a way over-priced meal there last summer, 3 people over $100, for Mexican food, not sure why I went back, probably because it's across the street from my apt.

So, so good. They give you a decent serving and they also give you two warm, fresh corn tortillas on the side. Best corn tortillas I've ever had. I think. I had three tacos: Carne Asada, Chorizo, and Al Pastor (guajillo roasted pork, grilled pineapple, avocado sauce & crema). I scarfed them down. My favorite was the Al Pastor.

"Thirsty and Hungry after a long day of Apartment hunting, a few friends and I were debating where to go eat in Williamsburg. Luckily my friend had his iPad, and it was narrowed down to two nearby places: Bar Celo and Cariños. Luckily we decided to eat at Cariños and have drinks at Bar Celo, since the experience at Cariños was excellent. The decor was simple with many Mexican accents, including a large and well stocked tequila bar. I decided to order the tacos and a modelo negro, and after what seemed like forever the food arrived. Everything was spectacular; it was evident that the tortillas were freshly made, the meat tender and juicy, and the various spices that they offered all delicious. The desserts were delectable as well, with the clear winner being the AMAZING Platanos Con Crema (whipped cream made in house). The whole package, from the beer to the tacos to the dessert, made this excursion worth it.

"3.5 stars...This recently opened Mexican spot is the brainchild of the previous chefs from a former Williamsburg Mexican hotspot that had closed down. The space is beautiful and well thought out and everyone I encountered working there were amazingly and genuinely happy and friendly. I wish I could give them a slightly higher rating given all their positives but they do have a few downfalls. For starters it's cash only, the don't have alcohol (BYOB), and they didn't have free chips to munch on while waiting for the meal. I did see chips coming out of the kitchen which leaves possibility for three scenarios. Either you have to pay for chips and salsa (something that is complementary at nearly every Mexican restaurant I've ever been to), you have to ask for free chips (in which case they should have asked if we wanted some in the first place), or they just forgot to give them to us (an unlikely case seeing how there were few people here and we were sitting right by the bar). But I digress. The menu here is small, simple, and straight forward. The prices are quite reasonable ($8-15). I ordered the pork burrito, my date ordered the steak burrito. I found the pork to be tender and flavorful but the overwhelming amount of cheese in the burrito mostly hid this flavor and most if it's texture as well. I found the ratios to be much more pleasing in the steak burrito (which they had mistakenly identified as the pork burrito when bringing it to our table). I do like this place and will eventually come back but this time I've got to stick to the 3.5 stars.",4.0

"the moment after i found out about the connection to Botina i was out the door to try this place.  i think of that fish burrito with great fondness, as nothing has ever come close - but let's move on.Elote was done right, carnitas taco was very good, fish taco was tasty, but i wish they had the option of FISH BURRITO. the tacos were overpriced for the size, but flavorful.  the cilantro margarita was DELICIOUS and worth every penny. our waiter accidentally made a second which was given to me gratis. i left reasonably content, a little drunk & a little hungry.on my second visit, i brought my mom here & she wasn't all that impressed.  a special mango salsa/salad, some maduros & a couple of tacos came out to 30 bucks change. pretty steep when compared to mexican just about anywhere & other restaurants in the area that would generous portions for that price.if/when i come back i'll have to try something other than those tacos that are just way too expensive for the size.  all in all - good place for a snack and a cocktail, but it's certainly not Bonita.",3.0
Something has gone wrong with Carino and it's breaking my heart.  This was my favorite place for a vegetarian torta. No longer though.  Their menu has changed.  They removed the veg torta and instead added more dollar amounts to everything.  Why are two fish tacos with hardly anything on them $9?  Why is a burrito $12?  And whyyyyy did they take away the veg torta?  They actually made me the torta when I asked for it but it wasn't the same at all.  It was bland and mostly tasted like cabbage.  Did the owners change?  Was it an off night?  Will my heart ever be mended?  Carino...you have really let me down.,2.0

Don't be fooled by the pictures of the food - that's the past ! The present are small sized bites for $4-$5 each. The fish taco dish is half its size fish and vegetable wise. The wait for the food is almost an hour - and then you get appetizer size plates !!! Too bad, another authentic place in Williamsburg down the drain.... I just spent $29 pre-tax on a few tacos and a small side dish and I'm still hungry.....",2.0
"Ventured here in hopes of finding yet another new lunch spot. The place is very homey and airy inside. We ordered fish tacos, chicken tacos, guacamole, and sweet plantains. The fish taco was great with a touch of lime juice and the chicken tacos were a tad dry. The guacamole came in a cool stone pot. The sweet plantains were just right, not too mushy and not sickeningly sweet. The staff was friendly albeit a bit slow. All in all this place was a great lunch stop. I'll have to stop by again for dinner sometime.",4.0
"My girlfriend and I went to eat at Carino the other night. We went based on all the rave reviews on Yelp and had high hopes for the place. I asked the waitress what was most popular on the menu and she recommended the fish tacos, which I ordered. My girlfriend ordered the pork enchiladas and we also got the tamale app and guacamole. The guacamole was pretty good but did not come with enough chips (you have to order chips al la carte for an additional three dollars.) But the guac turned out to be the best part of the meal. The tamale was dry and flavorless, not to mention cold. In fact everything that we were served was luke warm to cold.We ended up having to send the enchiladas back to be warmed up (which we never do, we both wait tables and try our best to be easy customers when we go out) They came back a few degrees warmer than they had first come but still not satisfyingly warm. Plus they were drenched in this weird orange sauce, ick.My fish tacos were also cold and generally flavorless, plus I only got two for a staggering 12 dollars or something insane. Beans and rice you have to order al la carte to help supplement the hunger that you will be feeling after eating such small and dull portions.I ordered a tequila and grapefruit cocktail which was not bad but did not take the edge off having to reach in to my wallet and shell out sixty bucks for an extremely unsatisfying meal. I would never recommend this place to anyone. You can get better mexican food from a truck.",1.0
"Never before have I been more jealous of the staff meal.Amazing. ""-Another- Mexican restaurant?"" you might be saying. Listen, if the place is good as Cariño, you can open an infinite amount and it still wouldn't matter.  This place is not treading on anyone's turf in Brooklyn, dare I say New York, with its refined, delicious short list of dishes (tacos, burritos, gorditas, etc.), all done at a very high level.  Try all of the sauces and (edit:)  the liquor license has arrived.I'll be back, and so will you. 5 stars.",5.0
"the moment after i found out about the connection to Botina i was out the door to try this place.  i think of that fish burrito with great fondness, as nothing has ever come close - but let's move on.Elote was done right, carnitas taco was very good, fish taco was tasty, but i wish they had the option of FISH BURRITO. the tacos were overpriced for the size, but flavorful.  the cilantro margarita was DELICIOUS and worth every penny. our waiter accidentally made a second which was given to me gratis. i left reasonably content, a little drunk & a little hungry.on my second visit, i brought my mom here & she wasn't all that impressed.  a special mango salsa/salad, some maduros & a couple of tacos came out to 30 bucks change. pretty steep when compared to mexican just about anywhere & other restaurants in the area that would generous portions for that price.if/when i come back i'll have to try something other than those tacos that are just way too expensive for the size.  all in all - good place for a snack and a cocktail, but it's certainly not Bonita.",3.0
Something has gone wrong with Carino and it's breaking my heart.  This was my favorite place for a vegetarian torta. No longer though.  Their menu has changed.  They removed the veg torta and instead added more dollar amounts to everything.  Why are two fish tacos with hardly anything on them $9?  Why is a burrito $12?  And whyyyyy did they take away the veg torta?  They actually made me the torta when I asked for it but it wasn't the same at all.  It was bland and mostly tasted like cabbage.  Did the owners change?  Was it an off night?  Will my heart ever be mended?  Carino...you have really let me down.,2.0
This place is a hidden gem. The food was genuinely good and our waiter was very sweet. I will be back!,5.0
Super over priced and pretty middling food. I didn't like that they charged 2 dollars for tiny portions of salsa or hot sauce without telling telling you it was extra. I will say it has a decent happy hour drink special.,2.0

"I'm from Texas and my family is from Mexico. I know tacos. I made it my quest to know the best joint in my home town and i thought Carino was going to be my new best friend. Alas, it was not to be. I'm not sure what all of these people are talking about! The delivery was fast and the guy taking my order was very nice and made recommendations. We had a sampler so  I got a good read of this joint. We had the crispy fish taco, barbacoa, pernil, roasted chicken, steak, chorizo, and the crispy americano. I like that they don't put the salsas on the tacos so they don't get soggy but it ends there! STANDARD tacos come with all the fixins or ""con todo"" and these didn't. They should have had onions, cilantro, radish, and some pickled jalepenos on the side. It was just meat and a dry, bland, single tortilla. On top of that the meats were that impressive. The best taco was sadly the Americano in the hard shell. THe crispy fish and the medium rare beef were OK. I know a lot of these people are raving about the salsa but that's because they don't know real salsa. Carino's tastes EXACTLY like they took chipotle peppers out a can with adobo sauce and ground it up. It's ok but nothing amazing. Delivery was fast but that hardly makes up for how blah these tacos were. I'd love to give this place another try based on all of these reviews but it's hard when there are three taco trucks within walking distance that are half the price of this place. very disappointing.",2.0

We had a sampler so  I got a good read of this joint. We had the crispy fish taco, barbacoa, pernil, roasted chicken, steak, chorizo, and the crispy americano. I like that they don't put the salsas on the tacos so they don't get soggy but it ends there! STANDARD tacos come with all the fixins or ""con todo"" and these didn't. They should have had onions, cilantro, radish, and some pickled jalepenos on the side. It was just meat and a dry, bland, single tortilla. On top of that the meats were that impressive. The best taco was sadly the Americano in the hard shell. THe crispy fish and the medium rare beef were OK. I know a lot of these people are raving about the salsa but that's because they don't know real salsa. Carino's tastes EXACTLY like they took chipotle peppers out a can with adobo sauce and ground it up. It's ok but nothing amazing. Delivery was fast but that hardly makes up for how blah these tacos were. I'd love to give this place another try based on all of these reviews but it's hard when there are three taco trucks within walking distance that are half the price of this place. very disappointing.",2.0
"Food is amazing. From the former management and kitchen staff of Bonita. All of the good things from Bonita carry over, but they've added their own to this place for sure. Their tequila selection is amazing, food is awesome. Service is top notch. Try the Diablito margarita, its so spicy and sweet and like no other margarita I've had in nyc! I'm from southern arizona and I KNOW good mexican food!",5.0
"Absolutely amazing food!!!!!!!!! I went to Carrino with a group of friends from Texas. Being from the south of the border.  I' ve had my share of excellent food especially from my grandma that lives in Mexico. Been half way around the world and eaten some great food. I am pleased to say that i found my regular new spot in New york for great food, drinks, and pleasant enviroment!!!!!   There shots especially there sangrita shot!!!! awesome!!!!!",5.0
"I am in NY every week and eat out every night, mostly in over priced places in the city where  I need a slice of pizza after I leave because I am still hungry.I was taken to Cariño last evening and I have finally found a great place worth the trip.I had the grilled corn on the cob app and it was so good, I ordered a second. My main course was large and very tasty.The wait staff was friendly.I suggest it.",4.0
"I've only had the steak nachos and the steak tacos; the steak is perfection.  It's like fancy steakhouse steak cubed into Mexican food.  The tacos are insanely small for the price, so probably wise to order the full size entrees or burrito.",4.0
"This place won't let you down! We had the guac, corn, enchilada de mole and fish borrito...all of our plates were cleaned, like a dog on a dinner table!",4.0
"Don't let the Olive Garden decor fool you, the food is amazing. It's the same staff as the beloved Bonita -- so those magnificent fish tacos they used to dish out have returned to the neighborhood. The auga frescas are fantastic as well. If you can look past all the bad decorating choices and focus on the food, your mouth will thank you.",4.0
"I was planning a dinner with some friends and craving some good Mexican food and margaritas. Through Yelp I was able to find Cariño. I couldn't be more happy with my dining experience. The food was amazing. The margaritas and drinks were reasonably priced.  Food was tasty. It was a party of 6 and everyone was pleased with my pick. The music was pleasant. Very random. From alternative to Latin.  Service was friendly and knowledgeable.I went back a few weeks later on a Friday night around 7. The place was empty aside from a few people at a table adjacent to mine. It must have been happy hour because the Maragaritas were $4 and I am happy to report that they did not stiff on the alcohol. I wanted to try an appetizer so I went with the empanadas. It was a special, stuffed with zucchini, mushrooms and cheese. I absolutely loved them. Although I could have enjoyed more than 2. I am going to start a monthly tradition of dining at Cariño....",5.0
"Picked up dinner from here while visiting New York this past week since they are down the street from where my sister-in-law lives. It wasn't all too cheap, but quite good. The guac was spicy- perfect for me but too much so for my son. Enchiladas were delicious, as was the steak burrito (my husband ordered this based on the other yelp reviews). We did a side of sweet plantains which were perfect! I'm so glad they weren't crispy and tasteless like I've usually had them. Can't review their drinks since we didn't have them. We were happy they had a menu online since we were able to call in our order and then pick up, but the menu was a bit limited and kinda hard to navigate online. All in all, a pretty decent place.",3.0

"Great atmosphere, food, drinks, service and overall experience! It's not easy to find good Mexican food in NY (sorry, but it's true), but now that I've found this little gem, I'll be a regular. Not a bad way to celebrate Cinco de Mayo!",5.0
"Carino of Brooklyn is a cozy eatery off the beaten track.  As you enter, it is not hard to imagine yourself taking a siesta in Spain because the atmosphere is so relaxed.  The service greets you with a smile and helps to explain the menu.  The menu is a Mexican based but familiar to the average foodie and vegetarian friendly.  Since the lunch service is mostly tapas, it is a great experience for a bunch of friends.  Sharing is encouraged, so don't worry about if you don't like it, chances are someone at the table will.  The only salad on the lunch menu is the Carino salad made of carrots, celery, jicama, beets and baby spinach dressed with a jalapeño dressing topped with smoky pumpkin seeds.  The salad is so pretty, you feel bad destroying it.  Trust me this salad will be destroyed! The dressing isn't overly spicy and the smoky pumpkins seeds add an interesting note of flavor which confuses your taste buds.  Small plates include Picaditas which are tortillas topped with salsa verde and a Mexican cheese similar to queso blanco. These are not tortillas as you know it; they are crunchy outside with a smooth and creamy inside.  If all your friends are not vegetarian, they offer Taquitos Dorados which come in potato or chicken.  The prices range from $4 to $10 for each dish.  Oh don't forget to try the Elote which is grilled corn on the cob rubbed with butter and rolled in chili powder.  Can you say YUM?  While you are there, don't drink the same old thing; try their imported Mexican soda or their fresh juices.  As for dessert, ask the waiter what is available because not everything on the menu is prepared for the lunch service.  By the time the meal is over, the small plates make you feel like you ate a great plate.  Tapas are a great lunch break from homemade salads and vegetarian frozen meals.",4.0

Really authentic Mexican food and a great variety of selections for tacos. The drinks are great and the price is low for the amazing quality of the food. The service is always friendly and fast. We've been to Carino multiple times and will definitely be going back for lots more!,5.0

"Our all time favorite Mexican restaurant.  We've been going to Cariño regularly since it opened, and have been consistently impressed.  First, Sergio is the man.  The waitstaff overall are warm, welcoming and professional.  You can tell they have a true sense of pride about their restaurant, and we feel like guests of honor each time we eat there.  The menu has undergone a few changes since they opened, but has always had a good variety to choose from.  The food is fresh and delicious, and leaves you wanting to come back for more.  Outstanding guacamole, tortas, burritos, tacos, elote, flan, and margaritas.  Outstanding everything, really!  We love Cariño.",5.0

"Carino brings the love. The Ricardo's guacamole is revelatory! The service is friendly. They will make vegetarian versions of the enchiladas for you. The agueas frescas are perfect for the hot summer days, but as soon as the liquor license arrives, the place will only get better.",5.0
"I recently used Carino to cater my work holiday party, and I could not have had better service. Sergio was incredibly helpful (not to mention friendly), and the food was delicious. Ordering for a larger party can be super stressful, and they were just terrific and kind and a real pleasure to work with. And everyone loved the food. Total success.",5.0
"This is the most wonderful place! Definitely the best mexican I have had on the East coast. Their carnitas taco is heaven, their fish taco yummy (baja style) and their ""special"" guacamole with papalo is crazy good. My dining companion loved his torta when we went there for brunch too--the one lack-luster element was the huevos rancheros I ordered, but they weren't bad, they just weren't as amazing as the rest.
