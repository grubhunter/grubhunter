"Best Thai food I've had since... well, since our honeymoon in Thailand 2015, actually. Kao Soy serves fantastic Thai dishes, with a focus on the Northern region of Chiang Mai, a part of Thailand that enjoys strong culinary influences from neighboring China and Burma. The dishes feel both comfort food and surprising new things, with great attention to every ingredient in each dish.The place is mall, with enough room for about 20 people, plus 2-3 stools by the bar. Tables are also small, so that you will have to finish a dish before you can attack the next one, also thanks to the use of those extra-wide/deep dinner plates that take up a lot of space[1].Dinner started with fried banana blossom with spicy garlic-lime sauce & sweet peanut chili sauce. This dish is an appetizer only in name, since the 3 pieces that are being served are as large as they are filling. Definitely a dish to share.This was followed by a papaya salad with green papaya with shrimps, tomatoes, long bean, garlic, chili & peanut. This salad was wonderful: a perfect balance between refreshing and spicy. Just keep in mind that this is Thai spicy: this is a hot dish for people who enjoy spicy food.The Kao Soy was amazing: coconut milk Chiang Mai curry with a chicken leg and egg noodles, topped with fried egg noodles and, papaya fritters served with scallion, pickle, chili paste, red shallot and mustard green. Wonderful presentation and wonderful flavors. I thoroughly enjoyed the coconut milk curry, so much so that I scooped up every single drop of it.We then had the Sai-Oua: a spicy northern thai herbal pork sausage with nam prik noom (northern thai-chili dip), fried marinated pork, assorted vegetables, and sticky rice. Very interesting dish, in which the meat almost plays second fiddle to the aromatic herbs and spices that make this dish stand out. The little pieces of fried marinated pork are also extremely tasty.We finished the meal with sticky rice and fresh mango.Overall this was a very hefty meal for the two of us; in retrospect we could have done without the appetizer (and the dessert...) and would still have left full and satisfied. Nevertheless, I regret nothing. Nothing! In fact, I look forward to coming back again and enjoy some more delicious Thai dishes.------------------[1] If you are more than 2 people, I suggest you call to get a reservation.",5.0
"Two things to know about Kao Soy:1. They no longer have a contract with yelp reservations, so DON'T USE YELP TO BOOK A TABLE there. Yelp will send you confirmation notices, but the restaurant doesn't get notified and you'll get screwed. We had a useless yelp reservation, but were very lucky that there was an opening and were able to be seated within a few minutes.  That was pure luck...don't count on Yelp reservations.2. The food is awesome.  I love love Thai food and thought the soft shell crab curry was delicious and perfectly spicy.  The calamari didn't seem very Thai, but was still very tasty.  My gf had the sausage and it was also very good.  Our dishes came out quickly. I'd definitely go back.",5.0
"Always nice to warm up on a cold winter day with comfort food. Kao soy warms your belly but they could (literally) turn up the heat a little in the place. Tucked right behind the bus stop is an authentic northern Thai restaurant with all the delicious classics!Calamari fritters were perfectly fried crispy on the outside and tender on the inside and served inside a wonton skin flower. The dipping sauce is more chili than sweet which was awesome. Tom yum soup is sour and savory and piping hot - yum!Now for the main dish -kao soy is served with two drumsticks, heaping noodles both in the curry and on top, onions, pickled vegs, and a tasty sweet hot paste. The dish is def enough for two to share. Can't wait to come back and try the rest!",4.0
"Used to be so good. Ka nom jean kang kiew wan (green curry noodle) and kao soy used to be my favorites. This time, I disappointed me big time. The green curry noodle was not thick and flavorful anymore. It was so soupy. Noodle was too soggy. Kao soy was totally lack of flavor. Papaya salad - a dish that's an authentic restaurant should not fail. This place had failed it. It was so fishy with fish sauce and just plain sour with no other flavor. Very disappointed. Service was good. The food gets 0 star from me.UPDATE:  I got harassed by the owner for leaving him a low review (see attached photos). He claims that the chef and managers are from Thailand. Apparently, I am as well, so now who doesn't know what the real Thai food supposed to be like!?!",1.0
"Where to begin from? Calamari Fitters, coconut Shrimp, Crab Rangoon, shrimp Pad Kee Mao... This is a little Thai hidden gem in red hook. Love this place. Food is well balanced between spicy, sweet, sour, crunchyness and seasoning. Really great job guys. Recommend to everyone who is touring red hook and wants to get real Thai food. Will be back soon. Jen was phenomenal!!! Kudos",5.0
"My friends and I randomly dropped into Kao Soy looking for something to eat around Red Hook. Upon entering, I noticed their closely-packed interior with limited seating. We all started with some refreshing Thai iced-teas which is a must in any Thai restaurant. For appetizers, we had the fried calamari, curried chicken puffs, and the soy & herb-marinated pork strips. They were all disappointing. We also had the banana blossom fritters which sounded interesting but tastes like fried nothing. Once again....disappointing. For entrees, we ordered: KHAO SOY -- A staple dish in Northern Thailand. It's essentially a curry noodle soup. This was supposed to be their ""signature dish"" so I was expecting a bowl of rich curry goodness. It had an appealing presentation with the fried noodles perched on top of drumsticks with the curry soup right underneath. However, it looked better than it tasted. What a shame....I was only able to taste the coconut milk in the soup. The curry flavor was almost non-existent. It didn't even smell aromatic when the dish was brought out. Having recently traveled to Chiang Mai, this dish is definitely not the real deal. SAI OUA -- Pretty much just pork sausage, fried marinated pork, assorted veggies, and a side of sticky rice. I liked the fried marinated pork the most in this dish. The meat was well marinated and had a good flavor that reminded me of how Korean kalbi would taste. It was delicious and the sticky rice complemented the pork very well. However, the sausage on the other hand was too dry. As for the service, I didn't appreciate the waiter handing us the bill before we started our main entrees. They had to ""close the register"" which was probably their tactic of telling us to hurry up and get out since it was near their closing time. Overall, the dishes all lacked in flavor and substance. The best thing the whole night was the Thai iced-tea. Definitely not the type of place to go out of your way to try.",2.0
"It seems I've missed the boat on what was probably a great spot a few months ago when Pete Wells wrote a glowing review in the Times. New management running the show now. Bummer. At 9:30 on a Saturday a few tables were still open and we felt lucky to have no wait for a table for two. The menu has your basic Thai curries & noodle standbys alongside an interesting variety of more challenging dishes like anchovy salad and descriptions listing ""lots of chiles"". We're off to a good start. Pla Khoong shrimp salad ($10) with lemongrass had 4 very fresh, large shrimp but the other ingredients from the menu - keffir, mint, fried dry chili, shallot, spicy lime dressing - were barely perceptible in the mound of lettuce. This was about a 2/10 on the spicy scale for me and was very safe for my spice-averse friend. I'm a bit embarrassed that we ordered a chicken pad see ew ($9) as an insurance policy in an untested Thai place. Go ahead and judge, we are usually disappointed with new places and were really hungry! It was not too oily, a bit bland but it hit the spot. Based on the NYT hype and some favorable yelp reviews, we thought this place could potentially turn out a good whole fish. We probably should have sent the charred red snapper (Pla Tod Nam Prik Ta Dang $24) back to the kitchen as it was dry and fried beyond well done all the way through. The steamed Brussels sprouts, snap peas, asparagus and jasmine rice served with the fish was very fresh, perfectly cooked and superior to the joyless red snapper. This place was a strikeout this particular night - if we hadn't taken a chance on the fish I would have said it's a decent neighborhood spot. My recommendation: If you want seafood walk yourself up Van Brunt to Red Hook Lobster Pound, if you want Thai head over to Pok Pok. On the way out I heard one of the owners telling a customer he's opening a second location somewhere on 3rd Ave in Manhattan soon. I'm sure it will be a success if they can bring back the magic that originally put them on the map.",2.0
"Yeah - it's definitely worth the 5 stars!! Located in the industrial area of Red Hook this place shines with warmth and comfort.A grand slam in flavor and environment. The space is small so they get busy during peak times. We sat at the bar (kinda uncomfortably) but they moved us to a table as soon as one became available. Awesome service!! The ladies were super sweet and came around to all the tables just checking up on things. My Sai-Oua (Pork Sausage) dish was by far one of the best pieces of meat I have enjoyed. The spice in the sausage was remarkable - not heat-your-mouth-and-burn-your-tastebuds-hot but flavorful, delicate heat which lingered like a warm hug from a loved one. Then you get the delectable pieces of pork along with the sausage and your mind just shuts down from sensory overload. It wasn't just the sausage either, my friend ordered the Kang Hung Le - a delicious Pork Belly stew with a juicy crispy drumstick. Warning if you don't like deliciously seasoned chunks of pork belly fat you might want to steer clear of the stew. And the drumstick was amazing. Such a great dish!Cant wait to go back!!",5.0
"Really great food. Northern Thai. We just went to Thailand last year, and it was so great to have some food that tasted like what we had there. Really friendly staff too.",5.0
"This is the best Thai food I have ever had! We were staying almost directly upstairs from the restaurant and when we arrived to Brooklyn we were beyond hungry. My husband and I decided that Kao Soy would have to do since we had no energy to go anywhere else. Eating here is a blessing from the gods! We immediately ordered some appetizers and almost as soon as the kitchen received our order, food started coming to the table! We were truly impressed with how quickly we were served. But then, we were immediately taken to Nirvana! I can't believe there is anything on this menu that does not taste amazing! We went a little crazy ordering appetizers, but how can you not when the items are so reasonably priced? To start, we ordered the banana blossom fritters, fried fish balls, steamed chicken & shrimp dumplings and the fried calamari. Everything was cooked perfectly! Our favorite thing was the banana blossom fritters... what the heck is it exactly? I have no idea, but it was AMAZING! From the moment I set foot in Kao Soy I was craving a classic spicy Thai curry and therefore I ordered a beef Kang Dang for my main course. WOW! It really hit the spot! So lovely! My only disappointment was that we never got the chance to go back during our stay in Red Hook. But, one thing is for sure... we will be back!",5.0
Everything we ordered was very fresh and the Kao soy was like mama makes it back home.  There's also a nice little bar area for when they are packed. Thank you!,5.0
"Ranks up there with some of the best Thai experiences I've had in any of the boroughs up to this point. Had the Tom Yum soup - always a gold standard in my book. Loved it - they give you the option to have whatever kind of meat or vegetables you want. I chose the veggie option - Thai straw mushrooms, baby corn, cabbage, onions, broccoli - were nicely cooked in the lime-y broth, and had a slight kick which I always like. Went with a simple dish, the pad garlic, which had a nice flavor accompanied by tofu, cabbage, broccoli, and onions. Wish there was a little more sauce, but on the whole it was delicious. Tofu was absolutely perfect - golden fried goodness. Rice was fluffy and well cooked - which is kind of hard to come by these days. Also had a Thai iced tea that wasn't too sweet. Service was incredible - the waiter asked us how our food was and even moved us to a warmer area in the restaurant. Highly recommended if you are in the Red Hook area, but it's totally worth the travel.",4.0
"As of 12/29/14, Kao Soy was still holding a perfect 5-star rating, which really intrigued my boyfriend and I to come in for a visit.  While the space looked really nice, the quality of the food and overall experience doesn't warrant a 5-star rating at all.  The restaurant is very small, with scattered tables that fit 2-4.  It was very intimate, and would've been nice for a date.  Decor is simple and tasteful, a little bit on the darker side.  The food only takes a 3 out of 5 at best, definitely not 5-star quality.  Also, know that the portions are VERY small.  It may look like we ordered a lot for 2 people, but we actually both left feeling unsatisfied.  For our meal, we ordered:- Fried Calamari/Pla Muk Tod, B- Steak Jim Jaew, C- Papaya Salad, C (me), B (the mister)- Kao Soy, B- Sticky Rice, BAppetizers: The fried calamari was all right - a mix of both crispy and soft to bite.  This appetizer comes with a very sweet dipping sauce.  The papaya salad was WAY too spicy for my liking, literally causing me to pant, and down multiple glasses of water.  Our server recommended we eat this alongside sticky rice, and while it helped ease a little bit of the spiciness, it still burned my taste buds far too much for me to enjoy it.  The mister - who loves his food extremely spicy - found that it was pretty good at that spice level; not perfect, but good enough.Entrees: Kao Soy and Steak Jim Jaew were all right, but entrees were disappointing overall since so many raved about the Kao Soy (restaurant's signature dish).  I liked the noodles that had softened at the very bottom of the Kao Soy, but I wasn't fond of the crispy noodles on top at all.  The only part of the Steak Jim Jaew dish I liked was the fresh, crisp snow peas. Kao Soy did not impress us at all unfortunately.  Unlikely that we'll make a return trip.",3.0
"We came here with friends on a Sunday. We were all very pleased. We shared several small plates and two main courses. Everything was delicious. Plus, the price was very affordable. About $20 each. Come here and explore Red Hook. It so cool.",5.0
"Undoubtedly, most definitely worth the trek to Red Hook, especially (for me at least) on weekends, when the Fairway/IKEA ferry is free! Just a short walk--a few blocks at most--from the water (with stunning views of the Statue of Liberty & lower-Manhattan skyline), Kao Soy serves up some remarkably fresh and clean flavors in large portions for reasonable prices, and their wait-staff are all incredibly friendly yet efficient.The house specialty, its namesake dish, Kao Soy, is banging, to say the least. A thick curried-creamy gravy with two hunks of bone-in skin-on dark-meat chicken, with a valley of thick egg noodles and a mountain of thin crispy noodles, accompanied by shallots & lime & mustard greens & red chili flakes--this dish really covers all the bases. As amazing as it is, this wasn't even my favorite course, and that's saying a lot. Over the course of two days, two consecutive weekend evening visits, we tried pretty much everything on the menu. My friends and I, six people total, ate our way through almost all of the non-traditional Americanized Thai dishes. So while I cannot yet report back on the Phat Thai & Phat Si Io & Kao Pad, I can confidently exclaim that you won't be missing them, at least not for awhile, when you have the likes of Pomelo Salad (with watercress & coconut & shallot & shrimp) & Broad Noodles with Shrimp and Squid and Soy Sauce & Spicy Herbal Sausage (with fried pork, green chili sauce, asparagus, carrots, and cucumbers). These three dishes were my absolute favorites.Other dishes--like the Banana Blossom Fritters & Massaman Curry & Pork with Mushrooms and Ginger Sauce & Shrimp with Green Curry and Rice Vermicelli and Coconut Meat and Anchovies and Hard-Boiled Eggs & Medium Rare Grilled Steak with String Beans and Sticky Rice--were all excellent, even outstanding. We had other dishes, and I will absolutely be back to try many more dishes, especially considering the aforementioned incredibly service (""Welcome Back!"" ""Long Time No See!"" ""Next time you come, you must try some different food, I can tell you will love them!""), etc.",5.0
"I really enjoyed having lunch here today! The Thai ice tea was delicious and refreshing  The paper rose straws add a personal touch to my drink!! For appetizers we had fried calamari, which was perfectly breaded and fried, not greasy at all. I also enjoyed eating the rice bowl that it was served in. The coconut shrimp was crispy and sweet on the outside and the shrimp was perfectly moist on the inside, not over fried. The crab Rangoon was my favorite of the appetizers!!!! The creamy crab and cheese filling was like heaven for your tastebuds and the sauce that accompanied it was extremely flavorful! For the main corse I had shrimp Pad Kee Mao was the best I had ever had! The spices are real Thai spices! I love spicy and this hit the spot!!! The dish was perfect! The fried ice cream was a delicious ending to this enjoyable lunch experience.The atmosphere is very cozy and inviting; especially on this chilly day. The service, Jan makes you feel like your a long time friend that returned to her house to have lunch. She's very personable and she made our experience here a memorable one!",5.0
"The Thai here is ON.POINT.The papaya salad was hell fire hot. I was crying and sweating in a way that i have only experienced in SE Asia and I loved every minute of it. This dish is not for the faint of heart. Many endorphins were released while eating this salad. Everyone on Yelp has already given accolades to the banana blossom fritters. They have a nice little peanut and chili dipping sauce to accompany them. The fritters are more substantial than I was expecting and there was definitely eggplant and possibly onions also in there. So worth getting if your dining in. Not sure how they would hold up for delivery or take out. I think eating them fresh is part of what makes them so good.The namesake dish Kao Soy is a curry stew like dish - similar to a spicier, heartier Massaman with chicken on the bone sitting right in the middle. The presentation requires a photo - steaming bowl of curry piled high with crispy noodles and soft, thinner style noodles layered underneath. Honorable mention to the eggplant and shrimp curry and especially loved that the eggplant were Thai eggplant (not as common as one would hope and expect at other neighborhood Thai joints) and were quartered and cooked perfectly (aka not a mushy, falling apart slice of eggplant). Bowl of rice comes with. The staff are wonderful. Super nice and accommodating (we went with a two year old at opening) and it was great. We were one of two other diners in there at that time. The place is tiny so not necessarily awesome for little ones unless you go at less crowded times. Waits can be in the upswing of 2 hours at prime dinner time on the weekend but there is a dive bar across the street that doesn't disappoint and is probably doing the best business they've done since Kao Soy opened. Decor is nothing special and is actually a little strange with weird shelving and knickknacks around and a ""fireplace"" that was on when it was 70 degrees outside.  Anyway - go for the food not the ambiance. Take out available but can also be a long wait depending on time/day of ordering.",4.0

"This is a new and very much buzzed about little spot that has opened in Red Hook on Van Brunt st. I work a few blocks away and finally made my way in.  I sampled a few dishes and this place is clearly more authentic than the average Thai takeout spot.  The decor is very cute with wood tables and floors. The staff are all very friendly.     I ordered the Krabong Hua Plee which are fried Banana Blossoms. Didnt even know Bananas made blossoms but they do and you can fry them. They were light and crunchy, didnt really taste like banana but reminded me of squash blossoms. They were served with a spicy garlic lime dipping sauce and a sweet peanut chili sauce which worked off each other well. I also got the namesake dish of Kao Soy which is an odd dish of a spicy curry broth which plays more like a sauce, tastes of coconut and chili, with soft egg noodles in the broth and crunchy,light,delicious fried egg noodles on top that break off into the broth. It has two juicy chicken legs in the broth and is served with garnishes of pickles, shallots,chili,lime and green onion to your liking and they all add something. The dish is as complex and interesting as any I have had as you really get everything, sweet,salty,spicy,crunchy,tender all in one bowl. It is also quite hearty and on a 41 degree ""spring"" day it hit the spot.    I also just for comparison sake had my usual Thai dish Chicken Pad Thai which was good but pretty basic and the portion was kinda small.    If you wanna try something different and authentic I would advise giving this spot a try.",4.0
"SO GOOD!Came here on a Friday night and we were a table of 6.  While we did have to wait, the hostess was nice enough to take our number so we could get a drink at a nearby bar while waiting.Once we sat, the restaurant is a little bit crowded- it's a small space so keep this in mind when you're thinking about how much personal space you need while dining.  Our order was taken pretty quickly and the server was quick to make delicious recommendations for us.  Since the prices were very affordable, we just asked that she make a couple of choices on our behalf just to make sure that we didn't miss out on anything really delicious.We got a whole host of foods that represent Northern Thai cooking- the fried banana fritters which were BOMB and the sausages which had a really fragrant taste of lemongrass and pork.  We also ordered a mango salad which really showcased what SPICY means.  We were off to a great start.  Then we all shared the fried whole fish, the Kao Soy noodles in curry, and the Hang Le curry.  ALL were amazing and delicious.  With Thai food, you really have to just go for it if they offer you a sauce.  The curries were both really good and we left with very full bellies.The price of the meal was really very reasonable with it coming out to a little over $20 per person before tip.  Bottom line though, if you're looking for pad thai or other quite americanized thai dishes, you're better off going somewhere else.  This place is the real deal and I can say that because I'm married to a Thai man :)There's a lot that I love about Red Hook and this little place definitely adds to the charm!  What a wonderful addition to the neighborhood!",5.0

"SO GOOD!Came here on a Friday night and we were a table of 6.  While we did have to wait, the hostess was nice enough to take our number so we could get a drink at a nearby bar while waiting.Once we sat, the restaurant is a little bit crowded- it's a small space so keep this in mind when you're thinking about how much personal space you need while dining.  Our order was taken pretty quickly and the server was quick to make delicious recommendations for us.  Since the prices were very affordable, we just asked that she make a couple of choices on our behalf just to make sure that we didn't miss out on anything really delicious.We got a whole host of foods that represent Northern Thai cooking- the fried banana fritters which were BOMB and the sausages which had a really fragrant taste of lemongrass and pork.  We also ordered a mango salad which really showcased what SPICY means.  We were off to a great start.  Then we all shared the fried whole fish, the Kao Soy noodles in curry, and the Hang Le curry.  ALL were amazing and delicious.  With Thai food, you really have to just go for it if they offer you a sauce.  The curries were both really good and we left with very full bellies.The price of the meal was really very reasonable with it coming out to a little over $20 per person before tip.  Bottom line though, if you're looking for pad thai or other quite americanized thai dishes, you're better off going somewhere else.  This place is the real deal and I can say that because I'm married to a Thai man :)There's a lot that I love about Red Hook and this little place definitely adds to the charm!  What a wonderful addition to the neighborhood!",5.0

Went shopping in IKEA today. Didn't want to eat there and found this place on Yelp. This place is 2 minutes drive from IKEA. Very small restaurant. First impression with the service was not good. The tall waitress has attitude. (I thought because I'm Asian? Just saw other reviews about the unfriendly service too but they are not Asian) She didn't smile or say anything. She looked mad. I told her what I want and she didn't say a word and walked away. A guy was picking up takeout. She walked up to him. Grabbed the money and walked away. Didn't say Thank you or anything. I got Kao soy and it was good but not enough egg noodles. There were more fried noodles than egg noodles. It's curry soup base with 2 drumsticks in there. I would return if I am in the area again but hopefully to see improvement for the service next time.,3.0

My friend and I tried the ""Pad Kraprow"" and the ""Laad Nah Talay.""The nice waiter advised me that the ""Pad Krapow"" was very spicy so I asked for a much less spicy version. I assure you, I can handle spicy food but this dish was beyond spicy. I had a few bites and had to give the dish to my friend. We both suffered in the bathroom last night. Sorry but not sorry.Also, the ""Laad Nah Talay"", It was bland and had no flavor whatsoever. It was actually kind of gross.3 stars for the service and 2 stars for the food.

"I feel I'm being quite generous with 3 stars. Newish spot, but already busy. We got here just 15 minutes after lunch opening on a Saturday (1:15p), and there were only 4 seats left at the bar. Since this place seats only 24 people, timing is crucial. Food wise, we have mixed feelings. Their appetizers were great, but the entrees were very disappointing. Khanom Jeeb (steamed chicken and shrimp dumplings): delicious. Krabong Hua Plee (banana blossom fritters): phenomenal; we couldn't have enough. Som Tum (papaya salad): tasty, and very spicy. Pad Kraprow (pork in Thai basil, pepper & onion in spicy chili sauce): awful; the pork was dry and tough, while the rest of the vegetables were uninspiring. Sadly, a bad dish. Kang Hung Le (northern Thai pork belly with a drumstick): it was not pork belly, but rather boring pork stew; the drumstick was old, and it came with a big chunk of tasteless cabbage and rice. Another bad choice. If we had known, we would have been happy to stay with the appetizers however, considering the location we don't have many reasons to go back.",3.0
"This place is a serious disappointment. They were much better when they opened last year, and after my last delivery order a few days ago, I'll probably never call them again. The vegetable dumplings were soggy, and the vegetarian pad thai was absolutely horrible. I took two bites and threw it in the trash. A waste of money, seriously. It didn't resemble any pad thai I've ever had; the noodles were mushy, as were the vegetables, which also tasted as if they were 3 days old.

"Come for the restaurant's namesake dish, which is now widely available in New York but never presented at the standard Sirchai Serparplarn has done here.

They will slop in the broth more and more with each bite - I was incapable of getting not getting a sizable fraction of this on my shirt. Perhaps you'll manage better.Before the kao soy - which is hearty enough to not require anything else - I made my way along with a dining companion through an order of fish balls. I remember barbecuing these over the flame of a Hong Kong campfire many years ago, and I've seldom had the dish prepared as well since. It comes with a tamarind-cilantro sauce, which manages to balance out the savory flavor without turning it to something a three-year-old would enjoy.Calamari, pad thai and pad see-ew are on the menu, but please ignore them.

"It takes a lot for me to trek this far outside of my comfort zone to grub, so full disclosure, my expectations were pretty high. My friends and I came here on a Saturday night on the recommendation of a true (hate to say this word) foodie friend of ours. Like, this girl has written her own cookbook.  Per this friend, Kao Soy is the kind of spot those in-the-know are trying to keep under the radar so it doesn't get too hard to score a table. I usually like to research when going to a new spot, check out what the most raved-about dishes are, etc., but we took her word for it and just winged (wang?) it. Big mistake.My first inkling that something was amiss was when we parked and walked by a Thai restaurant about a block away from our destination that looked warm, cozy, and bustling full of customers. Weird, is this where we're going? But we haven't reached the address yet, and this place is not called Kao Soy.  This is what is known as foreshadowing. We arrived at Kao Soy, and it was completely empty, save for one other couple.  On a Saturday night. By now, alarms are going off in my head like crazy, but we thought surely our compadre could not have steered us wrong. So in we go.  Started with the papaya salad. Super bland.  No hint of the pungent fish sauce and shrimp paste (or in some cases fermented crab) that give this dish its renowned kick. The two sad shrimp on the side seemed more like garnish, and tasted very fishy, which as you know, is not actually a good thing in your seafood.  We went on to share the pad cha pla (cod fish), kao soy, and steak jim jaew. - pad cha pla - admittedly our waitress tried to steer us away from this, saying it was incredibly spicy, but we poo poo'd her. We're Asian, of course, we can handle our spice! But really, I've heard of warning people of spice levels, but this chick really seemed to not want us to order it. Why have it on the menu at all? Anyway, it was sooooooo spicy, I ate nearly all the rice on my place after just a couple of bites of this entree in a desperate effort to regain feeling in my tongue.- kao soy - in a restaurant NAMED kao soy, the namesake dish should be awesome, right? It WAS the best dish of the evening, but that wasn't saying much. Piled high with fried noodles, this was apparently done to mask the fact that there was a meager offering of the regular noodles underneath and two drumsticks. I've had this dish many times, and I know it generally comes with dark meat, but come on, give a girl a thigh! Flavor was just alright. Uncle Boon's and Kiin Thai offer superior versions for anyone looking.-steak jim jaew - this was the least memorable of all. I can't say it was terrible, but just meh, which is sometimes worse. The steak lacked flavor, and the portion (for $20) was pretty laughable. The steamed vegetables seemed like a lazy afterthought of an accompaniment. To add insult to injury, the service was mediocre at best. The waitress seemed to hate her job, her life, us, I don't know. We could barely force a smile out of her. Also the aforementioned talking us out of a dish and only begrudgingly writing it down. (I have a theory she told them to add more spice to our dish so she could say ""I told you so""). Our check was put on the table immediately after our plates were cleared... usually not something to complain about, but it was SO prompt that it was clear a point was being made. That point was even clearer when we paid our bill, and the lights all came on, and we witnessed one of the employees sitting down at one of the tables to count out the day's loot... all while we were still sitting and finishing our beers. Had to chug nearly a full beer so we could hightail it out of there.Finally the salt in the wound came when we were walking back to the car, and passed the Thai restaurant we had encountered when we got there. The place was still full, a happy energy exuding from it, as one couple opened the door to walk in even as Kao Soy was closing (and kicking people out). Only the next day, when I just HAD to look up the Yelp reviews (thinking to myself, how could D have gotten this place SO wrong??), did I learn that the management had changed hands, and the original staff had all gone down the street to the Chiang Mai pop-up at Home/Made. Kicking myself for passing it up, because really, when am I going to go back to Red Hook, unless I find myself needing something at Ikea?? The takeaway here, kids, is: ALWAYS CHECK YELP FIRST.",2.0

"We first tried Kao Soy (dining in) a few weeks after it opened and when there were nothing but 5 star Yelp reviews.  The meal was good, but certainly not 5 stars.  It was just good solid friendly Thai in a neighborhood with absolutely no Thai options and all the Thai options in surrounding hoods for miles around just being 3 star generic delivery Thai.  (Yes ""Carroll Gardens West"" has PokPok but despite all the hype it is very good not great and certainly not worth waiting in line for).Kao Soy is refreshing in that it offers dishes beyond your basic pad thai and curries, yet isn't so pretentious as to not serve these popular dishes.  Having spent some time in Thailand for work and learning more about the diverse flavors there, it is nice to have a place relatively nearby that offers these type of dishes.  For that alone Kao Soy gets extra points in my book.Even though we enjoyed Kao Soy, it wasn't one of those places where we felt the need or desire to rush back (it was just nice to know it was an option). In fact it was several weeks later until we gave it another try (this time for take out late on a Sunday night).  Well thanks to all the Yelp hype business was booming and we were quoted 45mns for a pick-up order.  When I got there the place was packed and chaotic.  When I asked about my order, they told me they need a few minutes more.  A few minutes turned into 20, 30, 45 minutes (which is a long time in this tiny restaurant).  The whole time the food pouring out to the kitchen looked and smelled delicious but every diner leaving was complaining about how long their meal took and how disorganized it was.In the end the 45 minutes I was quoted turned into a 1hr 45mns.  A bit crazy for take out Thai, but a testament to how well this place is doing.  The problem is that their kitchen is too small to handle the demand of a constant line of eat-in diners, delivery orders (which were clearly getting priority over take out), and take out.  Something has to give.  Either the hype will die down or they will do what most popular restaurants do and limit take out to certain hours.  I hate when places do this (yes, i am talking about you Frankies and your dreamy meatball sandwich which you are always too busy to do for takeout), but realize it is necessary to keep quality up.Okay, so getting all that out of the way, I am guessing you want to know more about the food.  -Just to get it out of the way, yes we tried the Pad Thai.  I know many will turn their nose up at ordering such a standard Thai dish, but we feel it is the litmus test for any Thai joint.  It's served with super thin angel hair pasta, which I had never seen done before (even in Thailand).  It was okay but nothing I would get again. -The Pad Kee Mao has a nice kick to it but again I wasn't loving the noodles.-Both the Pad Kraprow and Moo Pad Prik Khing are  super spicy and really really satisfying. We got the Pad Kraprow with squid (which is cooked to perfection).-At $18 the Steak Jim Jaew is twice the price of other dishes, but super tender and cooked to perfection.-The Kang Kiew Wan was good but probably wouldn't get again.-Unfortunately I can't remember the appetizer we got during our first visit.So yeh, Kao Soy is a solid 4.  It's a 10 for Red Hook since there are no other Thai options, but I could see people travelling from other boroughs/neighborhoods being disappointed.  Not that they won't enjoy their excellent meal, but that the hype might make it seem like they should be experiencing something more.By the way, the people who run the place are super nice and I could see it being more of a 5 star experience if you go mid-week on off hours and they are able to give their full attention.  My hat goes off to them for opening in this location and handling the chaos as well as they do.",4.0

"Kao Soy 2.0 - New ManagementKao Soy was one of my favorite restaurants, easily a five star establishment for it's amazing cuisine...  until today.We went there last about a month ago and it was terrific and consistent as always.  Today's experience was drastically different, which was apparent when we walked in and noticed a different table arrangement.  We didn't mind that, but we did notice a significant change in the quality and quantity of the food.After our meal, we inquired if management had changed - which we suspected because we did not recognize any of the staff.  They confirmed indeed that they were under new management.  We ordered three dishes that we had countless times before, including their signature Kao Soy dish.  Don't get me wrong, it's good, but everything tasted like a pale approximation to the original dishes we came to love and enjoy so much.  It's just not the same. The Kao Soy dish itself used to be filled to the rim with soup and noodles, but now we got about half the amount of soup and noodles.  And it wasn't just us - the table next to us ordered the same dish and got what I consider a half serving. This is penny wise, but dollar foolish and cutting back on the quantity of soup and noodles in the dish will likely alienate a significant portion of the original customer base.If I didn't know how incredible the food was before, I wouldn't be so sad about the experience.",3.0
"Disappointing:A lot of hype around this spot and the name sake dish doesn't hold up to Pok Pok or Sripraphai's Kao Soy by a long shot. This is above average thai food, but not worth a trek out to Red Hook if you live far. The banana blossoms everyone seems to be raving about was much closer to shoestring fries, as in it just tasted like fried nothing...not sure where the actual banana blossom was. Papaya salad had some of the right flavors but was very small and didn't have the mouth-punch of flavor that a true papaya salad should provide.Maybe I missed what made this place so special since they have new management now.

"Wow!  Kao Soy will immediately take its place with Ayada, Pok Pok, Uncle Boons, and SriPraPhai as one of New York's premiere Thai restaurants.  Although lacking in the ambiance of Boons and Pok Pok, it has terrific and delicious Northern Thai food with an interesting menu.  While not an expert, I have spent a month in Thailand and can attest that the food is on par with a good meal there. We had the chicken and shrimp dumplings, the Kao Soy and Sai-Oua, which was a crazy complex pork sausage.  We also had a coconut water and thai iced tea.  Everything was awesome.  I am sure once the word gets out this place will become a destination much like the Thai restaurants in Queens.  As a Brooklyn resident though, I am pumped that the trip for high quality Thai just got shorter.",5.0
"Five big, full, juicy stars.  And that's after an hour wait for a table (on a Saturday night) - and having to schlep to Red Hook (from P Heights) in the first place.  Granted, getting to Red Hook is inconvenient for pretty much anyone.  (Unless you're a bird.  Or a fish.  But then you probably don't have money for dinner.  I digress...)The food at kao soy is OUTSTANDING.  My friends and I sampled several dishes and could not find a bad one.  The massaman curry and pomelo salad were standouts, but truly everything was delicious.  Will have to go back because they ran out of the pork belly dish and I simply must try it.I was a bit miffed that they let two, single (ie: not from the same party) people (who were waiting for take out) wait for their food at the bar, whist fidgeting on their phones.  They could have waited at the door and my friends and I could have started our meal a good 30 minutes earlier.  But again, even with that slight hiccup in service, the meal was so good I can't take away a star for the wait.Also - 4 people - eating a variety of mains and starters and sides until our bellies were full - under $100.  AMAZING.",5.0
"Bf has been nagging to eat Kao soy for a long time. After a very disppointing visit from Pok Pok. We came to this new Thai restaurant in Red Hook.     We ordered the fried banana blossom for appetizer. Green curry shirmp and of course kao soy. The banana blossom was really good with a little kick. Green curry shrimp was SUPER spicy and the waitress told us she think it's not spicy.

"Disappointing.  We came early on the Friday after Thanksgiving, so I fear that some of our disappointment likely stems from that.  Had the pork belly which was very dry, overly reduced (the ginger was too strong and bitter) and very small, then heard the next customer try to order the same dish and was told they were out. We clearly received Wednesday's leftovers, and the bottom of the pot at that. Ick.The fritters were nice but unremarkable.  The pad see ew was very good. The green shrimp curry had 5 very poorly cut shrimp in the entire dish, 2 half pieces of eggplant and 4 thin slices of zucchini. That was it.

Friendly but rather poor.  We ordered shrimp curry, she brought chicken.  We told her that we'd received the wrong dish, and when we explained that we didn't order chicken, she realized the mistake and apologized. She left the rice that came with the curry on the table, which quickly got cold in the rather frigid restaurant (fix the heating, folks!).  I asked for a replacement for the cold rice so that we could have hot rice with our curry (it took them 20 minutes to bring the second dish) - and the chef, clearly miffed that we had asked for a replacement, gave us some sludgy, wet broken bits that wouldn't pass muster anywhere AND they charged us for it.  I didn't complain about the extra charge (even though I had clearly asked for a replacement due to their error, not another portion) but well, am I wrong?And then there was the disappointing pork belly.Overall, we had high hopes that if nothing else, it would be a cheaper, easier to get to version of pok pok for us.   Here's the issue: it's more like a poor man's version of pok pok (and oddly every single dish here is in the pok pok cookbook - perhaps their chef is simply using the book?). The dishes are less expensive here, but they are more succulent at pok pok, more luxurious somehow.  There's soul in the food there and while you might be intrigued by this place if you are used to the standard thai places you'll find in New York, if you have gone to some of the more ""destination"" spots for authentic thai, I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.If we find ourselves in Red Hook again for another purpose, we might give them another chance with the assumption that we caught them on a bad day.  Beyond that, we won't be making the schlep for the sake of their cooking any time soon.Grumble.",3.0
"We first tried Kao Soy (dining in) a few weeks after it opened and when there were nothing but 5 star Yelp reviews.  The meal was good, but certainly not 5 stars.  It was just good solid friendly Thai in a neighborhood with absolutely no Thai options and all the Thai options in surrounding hoods for miles around just being 3 star generic delivery Thai.  (Yes ""Carroll Gardens West"" has PokPok but despite all the hype it is very good not great and certainly not worth waiting in line for).Kao Soy is refreshing in that it offers dishes beyond your basic pad thai and curries, yet isn't so pretentious as to not serve these popular dishes.  Having spent some time in Thailand for work and learning more about the diverse flavors there, it is nice to have a place relatively nearby that offers these type of dishes.  For that alone Kao Soy gets extra points in my book.Even though we enjoyed Kao Soy, it wasn't one of those places where we felt the need or desire to rush back (it was just nice to know it was an option). In fact it was several weeks later until we gave it another try (this time for take out late on a Sunday night).  Well thanks to all the Yelp hype business was booming and we were quoted 45mns for a pick-up order.  When I got there the place was packed and chaotic.  When I asked about my order, they told me they need a few minutes more.  A few minutes turned into 20, 30, 45 minutes (which is a long time in this tiny restaurant).  The whole time the food pouring out to the kitchen looked and smelled delicious but every diner leaving was complaining about how long their meal took and how disorganized it was.In the end the 45 minutes I was quoted turned into a 1hr 45mns.  A bit crazy for take out Thai, but a testament to how well this place is doing.  The problem is that their kitchen is too small to handle the demand of a constant line of eat-in diners, delivery orders (which were clearly getting priority over take out), and take out.  Something has to give.  Either the hype will die down or they will do what most popular restaurants do and limit take out to certain hours.  I hate when places do this (yes, i am talking about you Frankies and your dreamy meatball sandwich which you are always too busy to do for takeout), but realize it is necessary to keep quality up.Okay, so getting all that out of the way, I am guessing you want to know more about the food.  -Just to get it out of the way, yes we tried the Pad Thai.  I know many will turn their nose up at ordering such a standard Thai dish, but we feel it is the litmus test for any Thai joint.  It's served with super thin angel hair pasta, which I had never seen done before (even in Thailand).  It was okay but nothing I would get again. -The Pad Kee Mao has a nice kick to it but again I wasn't loving the noodles.-Both the Pad Kraprow and Moo Pad Prik Khing are  super spicy and really really satisfying. We got the Pad Kraprow with squid (which is cooked to perfection).-At $18 the Steak Jim Jaew is twice the price of other dishes, but super tender and cooked to perfection.-The Kang Kiew Wan was good but probably wouldn't get again.-Unfortunately I can't remember the appetizer we got during our first visit.So yeh, Kao Soy is a solid 4.  It's a 10 for Red Hook since there are no other Thai options, but I could see people travelling from other boroughs/neighborhoods being disappointed.  Not that they won't enjoy their excellent meal, but that the hype might make it seem like they should be experiencing something more.By the way, the people who run the place are super nice and I could see it being more of a 5 star experience if you go mid-week on off hours and they are able to give their full attention.  My hat goes off to them for opening in this location and handling the chaos as well as they do.",4.0
"I almost don't want to leave a review because people shouldn't discover this place. Much like how the NYT reviewed Khao Kang in Kweens and everyone decided it was the best place to go. Wait, am I comparing myself to the New York Times? Welp, I can't go back now. You can't just delete words, you know?Instead of eating sad chicken fingers in the fluorescent dining hall of IKEA, why not head over to KS and enjoy the cuisine of Northern Thailand? You won't regret it and you sure will enjoy it. XOXOYO",5.0
"Kao Soy 2.0 - New ManagementKao Soy was one of my favorite restaurants, easily a five star establishment for it's amazing cuisine...  until today.We went there last about a month ago and it was terrific and consistent as always.  Today's experience was drastically different, which was apparent when we walked in and noticed a different table arrangement.  We didn't mind that, but we did notice a significant change in the quality and quantity of the food.After our meal, we inquired if management had changed - which we suspected because we did not recognize any of the staff.  They confirmed indeed that they were under new management.  We ordered three dishes that we had countless times before, including their signature Kao Soy dish.  Don't get me wrong, it's good, but everything tasted like a pale approximation to the original dishes we came to love and enjoy so much.  It's just not the same. The Kao Soy dish itself used to be filled to the rim with soup and noodles, but now we got about half the amount of soup and noodles.  And it wasn't just us - the table next to us ordered the same dish and got what I consider a half serving. This is penny wise, but dollar foolish and cutting back on the quantity of soup and noodles in the dish will likely alienate a significant portion of the original customer base.If I didn't know how incredible the food was before, I wouldn't be so sad about the experience.",3.0
"Disappointing:A lot of hype around this spot and the name sake dish doesn't hold up to Pok Pok or Sripraphai's Kao Soy by a long shot. This is above average thai food, but not worth a trek out to Red Hook if you live far. The banana blossoms everyone seems to be raving about was much closer to shoestring fries, as in it just tasted like fried nothing...not sure where the actual banana blossom was. Papaya salad had some of the right flavors but was very small and didn't have the mouth-punch of flavor that a true papaya salad should provide.Maybe I missed what made this place so special since they have new management now. Bummer.",2.0
"I honestly feel that people are looking for reasons to be ""foodies.""  This place was fantastic. Excellent food and great service. Some of the best Thai I've had in brooklyn. Jane, who is extremely friendly, even offered us some complimentary lychee wine at the end of our meal. We will be returning!  Give the place a legitimate shot. Trust me, you won't be disappointed.",5.0
I went to eat at Kao Soy all the time. I like the food and staff is friendly. Always say Hello and smile. My work is in Queens but I still wanna get food over there. Take 20 minutes to get there. I would recommend Kao Soy to anyone and will definitely Be returning!,5.0
"Wow!  Kao Soy will immediately take its place with Ayada, Pok Pok, Uncle Boons, and SriPraPhai as one of New York's premiere Thai restaurants.  Although lacking in the ambiance of Boons and Pok Pok, it has terrific and delicious Northern Thai food with an interesting menu.  While not an expert, I have spent a month in Thailand and can attest that the food is on par with a good meal there. We had the chicken and shrimp dumplings, the Kao Soy and Sai-Oua, which was a crazy complex pork sausage.  We also had a coconut water and thai iced tea.  Everything was awesome.  I am sure once the word gets out this place will become a destination much like the Thai restaurants in Queens.  As a Brooklyn resident though, I am pumped that the trip for high quality Thai just got shorter.",5.0
"Five big, full, juicy stars.  And that's after an hour wait for a table (on a Saturday night) - and having to schlep to Red Hook (from P Heights) in the first place.  Granted, getting to Red Hook is inconvenient for pretty much anyone.  (Unless you're a bird.  Or a fish.  But then you probably don't have money for dinner.  I digress...)The food at kao soy is OUTSTANDING.  My friends and I sampled several dishes and could not find a bad one.  The massaman curry and pomelo salad were standouts, but truly everything was delicious.  Will have to go back because they ran out of the pork belly dish and I simply must try it.I was a bit miffed that they let two, single (ie: not from the same party) people (who were waiting for take out) wait for their food at the bar, whist fidgeting on their phones.  They could have waited at the door and my friends and I could have started our meal a good 30 minutes earlier.  But again, even with that slight hiccup in service, the meal was so good I can't take away a star for the wait.Also - 4 people - eating a variety of mains and starters and sides until our bellies were full - under $100.  AMAZING.",5.0
"Bf has been nagging to eat Kao soy for a long time. After a very disppointing visit from Pok Pok.

Spicy, fragrant, with the rice as a solid background. While I think the Kao Soy was a little sweet for my taste, Melissa loved it.Sorry we didn't try anything else there, but they were the nicest folks, moving us to a better table (we were O.K. with sitting at a slightly-too-narrow counter at the window, but they knew that we'd be better off at a table.

Wife had green curry, which was correct, and our ankle-biter a toothsome torn noodle and egg concoction called Pad See-Ew.I'll be back to try the restaurant's namesake dish.

"Amazing. It was so cold after 9 on a Thursday so we didn't have to wait.  Everything was incredible. Strong and authentic flavor. Reminded us of eating in Chiang Mai, Thailand but probably higher quality meat.  Top notch beer selection befitting of Brooklyn too!What to eat:* Fried banana blossom fritters were crispy and had little baby banana morsels in some bits.  2 sauces served along with them, one spicy and the other kinda vinegar tangy.* Pomelo salad had the similar tastes to papaya salad... lime leaf, chili, lemongrass. Refreshing burst of citrus with perfect spice.* Do not sleep on this restaurant's namesake, kao soy. A northern thai curry soup with noodles and two super tender chicken drumsticks.  So complex and hearty. I want it again now. I will be craving this over and over. Why must Red Hook be such a schlep?* Green curry with vermicelli noodles and shrimp was good but I'm not as big of a fan of these types of noodles Vs. the kao soy egg noodles.  Personal preference. I think others in my party preferred this one so it's a toss up.* Northern thai sausage and fried pork is served with cucumber slices and a green sauce. This was very similar to what we bought in the marketplace in Chiang Mai. Delicious but if you've had it before then it's nothing new and revelatory.* Pad Kraprang (Basil) chicken was a spot-on version of a much-loved dish. It was perfect because it was less heavy then our other dishes so I liked taking bites of this with the sticky rice and then going back to our soupier curry dishes.Can't wait to get back. Apparently the NYTimes review comes out next week so ya better hurry and get there before the line is epic.",5.0

"I thought I knew what good Thai food tasted like. I was so, so wrong. Some of these dishes were unlike anything I've ever eaten, just incredible flavors. The Sai-Oua (a Thai pork sausage, fiery hot but with amazing lemongrass tint) was a revelation. The Pomelo, watercress and shrimp salad packed in some amazingly bright flavors, and the Kao Soy was very good too, which you'd think so, given that's the name of the restaurant, but still. I tried a few other dishes that I can't remember the names of, but all were delicious and mostly from the ""Other"" section of the menu, which I highly recommend getting into.  Service was friendly and helpful, and yes, this place is SPICY, so be careful if that's not your thing.",4.0
"Honestly, I don't believe Kao Soy warrants such high marks. In fairness, the pictures of certain menu items other Yelpers posted does make it seem that there are better dishes than what we ordered, however, if a supposed 4.5 star Thai restaurant cannot execute a classic Thai curry (both of our curry dishes also had a strange scent and aftertaste that even my bloodhound of a nose could not pinpoint the origin of), I think that's a problem. Add to it very meager portions (and I am actually a light eater), and all in all I'd say that our personal experience was not even average, but subpar. I do give credit for having less traditional/typical menu offerings, and again, perhaps some of their other dishes are better, though I won't be returning to find out.",2.0

The Kha nom jean kiew wan khoong ma prao on (- likely misspelled here - vermicelli noodles with shrimp and green curry) is highly recommended, as the flavor is as intense and long lasting as the dish name itself.The menu is extensive and a departure from the traditional Thai restaurants in Brooklyn (although the traditional noodles and curries are offered). Oh, and when they say it's spicy, they actually mean it. So have a beer ready to help ease up the spiciness and continue enjoying your favorites.",5.0
"Melissa had the eponymous dish and I had the Sai Oua (spelling?) which is a dish where you assemble sausage, veggies, and rice... it doesn't sound like much until you realize that the flavors dance around your mouth and it's that interplay that makes it so delicious. Spicy, fragrant, with the rice as a solid background. While I think the Kao Soy was a little sweet for my taste, Melissa loved it.Sorry we didn't try anything else there, but they were the nicest folks, moving us to a better table (we were O.K. with sitting at a slightly-too-narrow counter at the window, but they knew that we'd be better off at a table. It was amazingly crowded by the time we left, so off-peak is best (we got there at 5 which was perfect).Definitely, we are going back... a nice addition to the larger neighborhood!",4.0
"Great little restaurant. I had a visually beautiful dish: Sai-Oua, a grilled, sliced, herb-laden spicy sausage with a little pile of twice fried, marinated pork, some pearly-white coconut rice, a species of choi and crunchy green beans. This came with a pot of  verdant, spicy dipping ""salsa"". Excellent. Wife had green curry, which was correct, and our ankle-biter a toothsome torn noodle and egg concoction called Pad See-Ew.I'll be back to try the restaurant's namesake dish. This is a good lunch option if you've been forced to go to Ikea by your other half, had a portion of your soul wither and die, and need re-vivification.",4.0
"Amazing. It was so cold after 9 on a Thursday so we didn't have to wait.  Everything was incredible. Strong and authentic flavor. Reminded us of eating in Chiang Mai, Thailand but probably higher quality meat.  Top notch beer selection befitting of Brooklyn too!What to eat:* Fried banana blossom fritters were crispy and had little baby banana morsels in some bits.  2 sauces served along with them, one spicy and the other kinda vinegar tangy.* Pomelo salad had the similar tastes to papaya salad... lime leaf, chili, lemongrass. Refreshing burst of citrus with perfect spice.* Do not sleep on this restaurant's namesake, kao soy. A northern thai curry soup with noodles and two super tender chicken drumsticks.  So complex and hearty. I want it again now. I will be craving this over and over. Why must Red Hook be such a schlep?* Green curry with vermicelli noodles and shrimp was good but I'm not as big of a fan of these types of noodles Vs. the kao soy egg noodles.  Personal preference. I think others in my party preferred this one so it's a toss up.* Northern thai sausage and fried pork is served with cucumber slices and a green sauce. This was very similar to what we bought in the marketplace in Chiang Mai. Delicious but if you've had it before then it's nothing new and revelatory.* Pad Kraprang (Basil) chicken was a spot-on version of a much-loved dish. It was perfect because it was less heavy then our other dishes so I liked taking bites of this with the sticky rice and then going back to our soupier curry dishes.Can't wait to get back. Apparently the NYTimes review comes out next week so ya better hurry and get there before the line is epic.",5.0
"This place *was* my favorite place. We live down the street and frequented it often. We have been gone for the summer and apparently a new chef and owner has taken over and the food is terrible. I literally ate only a quarter of my meal and left the rest. My husband did not finish his either. It's such a shame because the food was exceptional. The staff, however, was very pleasant.",2.0
Get here early cause the wait can be up to an hour if you just show up casually.Things we loved - the spicy pomelo salad which I could swim in even though I don't like things too spicy.The kang hung le - pork belly was amaaaazing. The sauce alone I could have thrown in a bowl of rice to soak it up! The steak jim jaew - tender slices of beef with yet another wonderful sauce to dip it in. Kao soy - yeah this is super tasty too! Not so much - the calamari is meh. Totally coming back again!,4.0
"I think this is better than typical thai with some dishes I haven't seen before.  It is small and intimate.  The staff is super nice!  Yeah new Red Hook restaurant!  Boo more crowds.  Anyway we had jasmine rice and asked they add veggies, pad thai and the fried banana blossoms.  We liked it all.  The banana blossoms by the way are a great crisp vehicle for the two sauces it comes with.",4.0
"What happened? This was an amazing restaurant and we were so excited to have such a gem in our neighborhood. However, last time we went the staff had changed and we were served so-so Thai food. After talking to other locals we realized that this experience was mutual. Sad times.",2.0
"I thought I knew what good Thai food tasted like. I was so, so wrong. Some of these dishes were unlike anything I've ever eaten, just incredible flavors. The Sai-Oua (a Thai pork sausage, fiery hot but with amazing lemongrass tint) was a revelation. The Pomelo, watercress and shrimp salad packed in some amazingly bright flavors, and the Kao Soy was very good too, which you'd think so, given that's the name of the restaurant, but still. I tried a few other dishes that I can't remember the names of, but all were delicious and mostly from the ""Other"" section of the menu, which I highly recommend getting into.  Service was friendly and helpful, and yes, this place is SPICY, so be careful if that's not your thing.",4.0
"Honestly, I don't believe Kao Soy warrants such high marks. In fairness, the pictures of certain menu items other Yelpers posted does make it seem that there are better dishes than what we ordered, however, if a supposed 4.5 star Thai restaurant cannot execute a classic Thai curry (both of our curry dishes also had a strange scent and aftertaste that even my bloodhound of a nose could not pinpoint the origin of), I think that's a problem. Add to it very meager portions (and I am actually a light eater), and all in all I'd say that our personal experience was not even average, but subpar. I do give credit for having less traditional/typical menu offerings, and again, perhaps some of their other dishes are better, though I won't be returning to find out.",2.0
"Have been eating here since day one and the food was amazing! UNTIL... it seems that the person who was running the ship and holding everything together is no longer there.

"After hearing Pok Pok was more of a $100 date, I've been looking for cheaper, authentic thai near Carroll Gardens for a bit now.

Red Hook is a wonderful neighborhood with maritime charm and love coming here for anything, usually groceries @ Fairway and beverages from Dry Dock. More wonderful food options further down on Van Brunt St. Great beer list, decent wine list also. Came in around 7, empty place. by 730, all 24 seats were filled. I do agree that the portions are on the smaller side, but its honestly just us being overfed. Deal with itAnyways, we ordered the Som Tum papaya salad, green curry and fried rice.

"Easily the best and most interesting Thai I've had in New York.  Nothing against Pok Pok, but this place wins out.  Three friends and I ate there last Friday, and found it easy to get a table at 8:30.  With a menu focused on Chiang Mai specialties, there were a few familiar items but most dishes were new to us.  We shared about 1/3 of the menu and everything hit on all fronts.  We all agreed it was the best Thai we'd ever had (pretty sure three of the four of us had even been to Chiang Mai).The service was very friendly as well, and the free pomelo salad didn't hurt.  It was a bit odd that they weren't BYOB as they awaited their liquor license (coming this week, they believed), but that just meant we got to down some beers and catch a fun old timey band at Bait & Tackle across the street after dinner.I'm pretty excited to have this place so close to home.  I hope more people discover, but not so many that I'll have to wait for a table next time.  Good luck guys!",5.0

After a long drive up to red hook and having heard all the rave reviews I had conditioned my mind to love authentic thai cooked and served in a small no frills restaurant by a very polite group .. maybe the family runs the business? The problems started with the service as there were tables available but there were still ppl running around serving and the person seating us was on the phone taking orders to go.

"Run. Do not walk to Kao Soy. Once the likes of Duckor and Leventhal get their utensils on this place, you will no longer be able to get in here ;) It's tiny. It's all freshly made and patience is a virtue that is worth it in this scenario. This might be the best Northern Thai food I've ever eaten. The staff was very helpful in describing the different spices and making suggestions. I decided we must try things we've never heard before and since, I'm the boss, we ordered the banana blossom fritters. They were beyond amazing. So crispy. Dipped into a peanut sauce and a spicy sauce for intense flavor wars. Then we had the whole red snapper; it was done beautifully. There was a ton of meat on it and it was easy to eat despite the intimidating outward appearance (note: just rip meat from bones). Being a huge fan of green curry, in general, I was obliged to try the kha nom jean kiew wan khoong ma prao (I wrote it down it was so good). It's green curry vastly improved by rice vermicelli noodles, spicy shrimp, slices of coconut meat, veggies, a medium-boiled egg, fried dried smelts and prik nam pla, a delicious spicy fish sauce condiment. Don't ask too many questions, just trust me on this one. Coconut water served in the coconut and with a spoon, for dessert. No liquor license yet but I imagine soon.Skip the dishes you've heard of and go for the ones you haven't. I'm obsessed.",5.0

"We went back last Sunday and had another very good meal.Khanom Jeeb - steamed chicken & shrimp dumplings.farm8.staticflickr.com/7…The dumplings are a blend of chicken and shrimp, delicate but fully flavored.  The dipping sauce on the side was terrific.  Piquant with a subtle heat that kept building.  These were really good.  CH poster wewwew was on to something when he posted about how the various sauces enhanced all the dishes.Moo Tod - fried soy & herb-marinated pork strips with plum sauce & hot chili saucefarm4.staticflickr.com/3…These were juicy with a dry surface.  Dusted with toasted rice flour?  I should have asked.  On their own they were very good but the dipping sauces really made a difference.  The plum sauce initially looked like that old devil sweet and sour but appearances can be deceiving.  There was a subtle sweet fruitiness but about 70% less sweetness than S&S.  And there was also a nice amount of heat that slowly built.  (This is a feature of lots of the sauces at Kao Soy.)  The chili sauce was excellent - a little more direct than the plum sauce with spicing that was a touch more assertive.  Either one of these sauces would have been great but together they were wonderful.On to the mains.Sai-Oua - spicy herbal pork sausage with a green chili dip, fried marinated pork, assorted vegetables & sticky rice.farm8.staticflickr.com/7…If sausages appear on any menu I almost always order them but this time my girlfriend beat me to it.  This was a new type of Thai sausage for both of us, different from what we've had at Ayada and Sri.  I'm probably getting this wrong (another thing I should have asked the owner about) but they almost had a coarse ground sagey Italian quality to them, although with far more heat.  The spicing started in the midrange and accelerated from there.  The chili sauce added some additional complexity and even more heat.  Calling them assertive would be an understatement.We liked this a lot but we thought the dish would work best if it was shared with a group of four.  Each person would get 2 large pieces and be really happy.  (No doubt there are hyper chili heads out there who can wolf these down 3 at a time.  I tip my cap to you.)  It's also served with strips of fried pork that are somewhat similar to my starter, although without the toasted rice flour.(Apologies for the photo.  While there was plenty of daylight in the room the sausage is dark enough so that I had to bump the brightness up a bit, making the rice look like a snowstorm.)Pad Kraprow - chicken w. thai basil, pepper & onion in chili sauce.  (You can also get this dish with beef, pork, and shrimp or squid for an additional charge.) farm8.staticflickr.com/7…This was my fallback after my GF decided to order the sausages that I'd had my eye on.  I've had this dish many times, most recently at Ayada in the spring.  The average versions are pleasant but Ayada's was perfectly balanced with plenty of heat.  I figured Kao Soy's would be similar.Surprise.  Their version started at the same place as Ayada's and then the heat built slowly over the next 30 seconds to a really robust level.  I had to take the occasional break between bites but by the end of the meal I was still scooping up the tiny remaining bits of vegetables that were still on the plate.  Excellent.We look forward to trying other things on the menu.  We also can't wait for the day they get their liquor license.  A couple of Sapporos would have been nice.  I'll bet they would have liked to sell me some.",5.0
"Very nice. I had the chicken Kao pad, a side of steamed greens and the pomelo salad.  All good except the pomelo salad might have had too much of something, maybe shallots? It did not look anything like the one posted here in a photo. I will go back as there were so many very interesting dishes I want to try.",4.0
"I have not eaten better Thai food. New small and cozy place, very clean, obliging hosts and food is beyond expectations. We did not mind to drive from south Brooklyn just to eat here. Everything is delicious . We shared   Banana fritters (yammy) and each ordered different nuddle dishes. I would recommend this place to any foodies.",5.0
The BEST Thai food I've had outside of Thailand. The owner is a lovely woman who makes you feel right at home. Her recipe for Kao Soy was passed down from her father apparently. Highly recommended!!,5.0
"I am constantly complaining of the lack of authentic Thai restaurants in NY (especially Brooklyn). I am so happy I found Kao Soy. Maybe it sounds over-the-top, but I would describe the dishes as a symphony of flavors and textures. The flavors almost pop in your mouth with brightness. Just beautiful! If you've only had faux NY thai food, be prepared to be completely surprised at how different authentic Thai food is.FYI, if you think you can take heat.... Thai heat is on a different level, so when the lady warns you that it is ""Thai Spicy"", take that into deep consideration. I was sweating up a storm, but loved my dish to the last bite. Can't wait to go back.",5.0
"Run. Do not walk to Kao Soy. Once the likes of Duckor and Leventhal get their utensils on this place, you will no longer be able to get in here ;) It's tiny. It's all freshly made and patience is a virtue that is worth it in this scenario. This might be the best Northern Thai food I've ever eaten. The staff was very helpful in describing the different spices and making suggestions. I decided we must try things we've never heard before and since, I'm the boss, we ordered the banana blossom fritters. They were beyond amazing. So crispy. Dipped into a peanut sauce and a spicy sauce for intense flavor wars. Then we had the whole red snapper; it was done beautifully. There was a ton of meat on it and it was easy to eat despite the intimidating outward appearance (note: just rip meat from bones). Being a huge fan of green curry, in general, I was obliged to try the kha nom jean kiew wan khoong ma prao (I wrote it down it was so good). It's green curry vastly improved by rice vermicelli noodles, spicy shrimp, slices of coconut meat, veggies, a medium-boiled egg, fried dried smelts and prik nam pla, a delicious spicy fish sauce condiment. Don't ask too many questions, just trust me on this one. Coconut water served in the coconut and with a spoon, for dessert. No liquor license yet but I imagine soon.Skip the dishes you've heard of and go for the ones you haven't. I'm obsessed.",5.0
"The plates are small, and not hot enough. The service was normal. The atmosphere is very casual. It's good for a local spot, not worth an out of the way trek.",3.0
Absolutely delicious and authentic Thai food. Spicy dishes totally hit the spot. The Kha Nom Jean was perfect (v. spicy) and is a dish from northern Thailand. The waitress was super sweet and even the chefs in the back came out to ask how the meal was. The staff spoke Thai to each other which is always a good sign of how authentic the food is going to be. Will definitely come here again when in Brooklyn!,5.0

omg...this place is awasome went for dinner with the family to celebrate my daughters 15 birthday .... the owner over heard all the birthday talk .... asked what was her favorit dessert ... after our meal he escorted the group to the outside dinning where he set up a cake and balloons ....... this place is the best we even learned how to say happy birthday in thai......,5.0

"I have been waiting for this restaurant to open for the past year!  Thankfully, I was not disappointed. I first had kao soy in Chiang Mai, Thailand in 2007 and could not wait to have it at a restaurant named after it.  The kao soy was very tasty and had great texture, but the highlights of my dinner were the fried calamari and fried red snapper.  The restaurant seems to put a lot of thought into the food without losing authenticity (but I am no Thai food connoisseur, just a huge fan).  I can't wait to go back!",5.0
Came here after seeing all the positive reviews. Might have been an off day but unfortunately the service wasn't good- the waitress was rude and unhelpful plus I couldn't tell whether she genuinely didn't understand our questions or whether she was just being sarcastic. The food was OK but the portions were too small to feel like a satisfactory meal.,2.0
"The food here is ridiculously good. My girlfriend and I were at IKEA, & We looked on yelp on where to eat around there and saw that it has only five star reviews. So we decided to check it out. I'm so glad we did. The food here is ridiculous. Did I mention that the food is ridiculous here? We ordered banana blossoms. Excellent. The Kao Soi. Amazing. I've had this at other trendier Thai places and their namesake dish is more flavorful, twice the size and way cheaper.  The staff was so nice and attentive. I look forward to going back to try the rest of the menu. Hope they get a beer license (and change the dance music).",5.0
"A welcome addition to ""The Hook"". I love that I can take this excellent restaurant out for a romantic date at home.  The Kaipap and Kang Massaman are perfect non-spicy choices for my oh-so delicate palate.",5.0
Kao Soy (Northern Thai) - This new restaurant is creating a lot of buzz esp with food critics comparing it to Pok Pok. Def worth a visit if you are in the neighborhood.,4.0
Wow!  It's all about the food here.  My hubby and I have been here five times since it opened.  The food is addictive and they don't hold back on the heat and spice.  Right balance.  This is very authentic Thai food not the watered down versions like many other Thai restaurants.  So good!,5.0
"My boyfriend and I were excited to find this gem of a restaurant when we moved to Red Hook.  Kao Soy has become our go-to neighborhood spot.  I love the chicken fried rice, I have literally eaten it 4 times now.  I have also had their pad thai, and their signature dish, kao soy. Everything is prepared with fresh ingredients and authentic flavor. I highly suggest Kao Soy to anyone.",5.0

"This is Red Hook's best kept secret. This little Thai restaurant is so much more than that. Don't be thrown by the location, decor, or table space, because everything we ordered exceeded our expectations. Starting with the spicy pomelo salad, then moving on to the kao soy, kang kiew wan (Thai eggplant green curry), and sai-oua (herbal pork sausage dish), every dish had it's own bold, unique flavor. Dishes were brought out as they were prepared, hot out of the kitchen. The portions were a good size for three adults to easily share everything. We ordered all the food as is in terms of spiciness and most of our dishes came with a decent amount of heat, so just be prepared. This menu still has some of your usual main Thai staples you'll see in other restaurants, but it's these more special items that make this gem so good. We'll definitely be heading back here very soon to try all the other exciting dishes!",5.0
