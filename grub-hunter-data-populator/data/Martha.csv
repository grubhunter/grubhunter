"Such a unique place!We came for an early dinner so had no issue getting a table. Our server explained their interesting menu for us. It has three sections, of snacks, sides, and plates. And basically it's all meant to share. Snacks for 1-2, sides for 2-3, and plates for 3-4. I would caution though that shareable servings don't mean large servings. It just means that you can get a good tasting of lots of different items which I love, because choosing is always the dilemma!For three of us, we had brussels sprouts (w/ fish sauce, honey, peanuts & jalapeno), Chinese Broccoli, Baby bok choy and greens (w/ black vinegar and garlic chips), PEI mussels (in lemongrass broth and kaffir powder) and Egg Noodles & Duck Sausage (w/ scallion, bok choy and szechuan pepper). Everything was fantastic. My favorite was probably the brussels sprouts. Just so tasty, a wonderful pairing of flavors. Close second were the mussels. Delish, I ate most of them single handed. And the noodles with sausage also superb.  The Chinese broccoli and bok choy was good in a weird way. It tasted good but had this strange smell that didn't make me go back for more. Two of us had a local cider, and my bf had a cocktail of some kind. I think it was essentially a fancy rum and coke. Our server was great in explaining everything to us, and the food came out super fast. My only two criticisms are it was a bit expensive. When you have to order so many dishes, they really add up. But that's also, NYC for you. And the other thing is there were no Vegetarian friendly entree plates. My friend found plenty to eat since most of the sides were vegetables, but she did wish for a main plate she could eat. I'm not in Brooklyn often but would definitely come back.",4.0
"I spent a most enjoyable evening here recently. Not only is the ambiance of this bistro charming, the staff is equally so.The space, located in an unassuming block of DeKalb near Ft. Greene park is warm and dark and reminded me of something you'd find in Paris. The outdoor patio was closed but my companion assured me that it was a desirable place to dine. Martha offers a variety of fusion plates, specialty cocktails and Italian made sodas that are unique in taste and presentation. We had Fried Chicken with TSO Glaze, pickled leeks, scallions, fermented black beans. The chicken was perfectly cooked and the dish was filling. Their brussel sprouts served in a cast iron pan with fish sauce, honey and jalapeno were prepared nicely with a sprinkling of peanuts throughout and the maple glazed carrots served on a slab of stone were very tasty.Drinks consumed were the Ginger Stinger containing Cocchi Americano, inger syrup, lemon, pineapple, honey and Angostura bitters, very refreshing and also the Manzanita with Atsby Amberthorn Vermouth, hard cider, beet juice, honey, served hot.",4.0
Just tried their recent new dishes. They keep on wowing!!!  GREAT new salad choices ...yummy appetizers and sides and main courses as good as they've always been. Great place. Great Vibe and a wonderful new Master Chef along with very good beer choices that go extremely well with the fabulous creativity of the food.,5.0
"Had a nice brunch at Martha on Sunday. If you are lucky, there is a lovely outdoor garden in back that you could try to be seated in - the wait was long though so we sat inside (email and make a reservation before hand!!). The service was kind of pitiful. Honestly, if the service had been better I would have made this a 4 star rating. But our waitress hardly checked on us and drinks took forever to come - even though we saw them sitting on the bar waiting to be delivered to our table for quite awhile. It also was not as though the restaurant was so busy that they had a hard time managing - it was simply that they paid us little attention.Anyway, the food was good. Interestingly we really loved the sides and only liked the main dishes. The brussels sprouts were the absolute hit of the meal and you MUST order them. They are huge and crispy/fried but then doused in delicious fish sauce, peanuts and pickled jalapeños. We also tried the biscuit and that was delicious, too (served with sweet butter and fruit compote).For mains, we had the scallion pancake and the egg over spicy pork. Both were good although the pancake was burnt on the bottom. But what we noticed was that they kind of needed each other to balance it all out. Without the pancake, the pork was overwhelming and without the pork, the pancake was dull. Therefore, these should really be combined into one dish. Or, the pork at least needs a carb like rice for instance. Just strange eating an egg over a pile of meat without anything else.",3.0
"Ate dinner here while I was visiting NYC (I'm from California). Was told to come here. Super friendly staff and really good food. Ambiance is great. Ate the Brussel sprouts and dumplings which were YUM. Ordered a cocktail that was a kind of sparkling wine spritzer: yum. For an entree I got the beef short rib ragu. It was tasty, but nothing amazing. I'd order something else next time. Overall, I was satisfied.",4.0
"Another winner for brunch places in Brooklyn! Between the hype that causes BK restaurants to be jam-packed during the hours of 11-2 every weekend, hipster servers who view their job duties as suggestions rather than requirements, and the food that is always more style than substance, it's important to separate the good places from the bad. I'm loving Martha's cozy wood and tile interior and funky decor. It just feels friendly, and the service is no exception. We ordered 4 dishes to share: Sunny egg with greens, Sunny eggs with spicy pork, Thai egg salad, and Brussels sprouts. In hindsight, we might have been a little egg-heavy on our ordering and it was only at the recommendation of the server that we add on the sprouts.We enjoyed all of the dishes, but the spicy pork and sprouts were the standouts. The Sunny egg and pork was a rich and filling combination, and yes the pork is actually spicy! The Brussels sprouts dish was the real winner though. Holy crap. These are amazing! I could have ordered this dish just for myself (noting this for future visit). The spicy peanutty combination with the roasted sprouts is spot on. I probably wouldn't order the sunny egg with greens again, it was tasty but not nearly as interesting as the other dishes.As an added bonus, we're almost 100% positive that Bryan Cranston was sitting behind us.",4.0
Great place! Nice people and no pretenses.Just wish they would bring back the yummy Thai eggplant and yellowtail poke!!,4.0
"""If you love us, Yelp us. If you don't, tell us.""  What's wrong with this picture? yelp.com/biz_photos/mart…Seriously, dining at Martha has been a surprise.I'm surprised by the food. Every time I walk into a restaurant in Brooklyn, I pay attention to the décor to provide me with telltale signs of a ""typical"" Brooklyn restaurant. So, when I saw the milk bottles hanging overhead serving as lamps, the voice inside my head said: ""uh-oh"". This was reinforced by the menu where Pan-Asian influences abound. Normally, this is not something that New Age Brooklyn restaurants can pull off well, but Martha deftly avoids the trap of ""fusion cuisine"", and instead focuses on Asian flavors with star turns by Cumin, Nuoc Mam, and Fish sauce when you least expect it. So, not only can you not fault the restaurant for inauthenticity, but you also don't walk away thinking of it as ""typical Asian fusion"". I think that's really smart menu design.I'm surprised by the consistent quality. I've been to Martha half a dozen times, including once for Brunch, and believe there was only one occasion I walked away unimpressed. The much talked about egg noodles with duck sausage ended up as mostly bland, with insufficient heat as did the Lamb Larb. But, on other occasions I thought the Swordfish Poke (Nori, soy sauce, yuzu, sesame, chiles, cucumber, fried shallots) was excellent as were the charred Brussel Sprouts (with Nuoc Mam, Peanuts, Pickled Jalapeno), and the fried chicken (soy sauce, cumin, five spice and General Tso Glaze). Of the three house desserts available, the ginger chocolate ganache with soy brittle brings together admirably all that the restaurant is aiming for.I'm surprised by the service. Not only have I seen little staff turnover during the past 5 months that I've visited, the core staff is dedicated and hardworking. I've been thoroughly impressed by Liz the bartender, who asked me on a recent visit,"" So, are you ready to try the (Vietnamese Coffee) Semifreddo?"" In a prior visit, I had debated ordering it, but desisted because I didn't want to stay awake at night figuring out all the ingredients in the Chilled Shrimp Vermicelli. The fact that she remembered the exact dish I wanted despite my usual lackadaisical social skills as a solitary diner is very commendable. It's not as if that hadn't been a busy night for the restaurant.I'm surprised that Martha only hints at greatness but never reaches it. Despite the consistently strong execution, there's always something or the other which makes you think ""it was good, but not magical."" I think that's due to playing it safe and not taking enough risks. For example, despite the repeated mention of the ""extremely hot Thai bird chiles"", I've found the heat level fairly tepid. Similarly, I think the fried chicken could have been memorable, but was marred by the glaze being a tad sweet. They should have placed more of their trust in Cumin. This overall play it safe attitude as typified by the request on the bill that, consciously or otherwise, attempts to skew the yelp ratings is what I find least appealing about Martha. I understand that restaurant owners see yelpers as fickle and view negative reviews with suspicion (often justifiably so), but am surprised that the owners haven't realized that the request communicates a lack of confidence in their own product, which is frankly very good... and, lack of confidence isn't an appealing trait to have, particularly if you have a predominantly female clientele (3:1 on many of my visits).",4.0
"This is the place I recommend now most to friends.Cocktails? Go to Martha.Brunch? Hit up Martha.Lazy Sunday dinner? Martha, Martha, Martha!Located in one of my fav Brooklyn neighborhoods, this delightful restaurant really has it all. I could drink any one of the cocktails and be overjoyed.It's great for small groups (no more than four people) and the service is friendly. It's a small kitchen/bar, so things take a little longer, but it's well worth the wait.Standout dishes from a recent meal were the brussel sprouts and duck fat biscuits. Will you be in a food coma after? Totally. But will you be in a buzzed, happy stupor? Yes.",5.0

"Martha is by far my favorite restaurant in Fort Greene, and one of my favorites in NYC. It is very well decorated and everyone is super nice, but most importantly, the food is just amazing. The pork ribs, the Chinese broccoli, the PEI mussels, the vermicelli and the Brussels sprouts are all fantastic dishes. On top of that, they constantly update their beer menu, which usually consists of 7 or 8 unique, hard to find ""craft"" beers of different styles. Martha is a very well run, beautiful restaurant, with great food and great service. What else can you ask for?Extremely recommended.",5.0
"This is our favorite spot to eat in Fort Greene with a group of friends! It is easy to try and share menu items if you have a few adventurous foodies to eat with.

"I have been wanting to try Martha for the last year, having read rave reviews in the Times. What happened? Does anyone else not see that the emperor is wearing no clothes? Martha has got to be one of the most disappointing restaurants I've been to in the last year. Yes the decor is nice and the backyard is pleasant, but that doesn't make up for the terrible food!The food however, was sorely lacking in refinement and consideration. First of all, the prices are exorbitant, yet the menu and the lackluster server encouraged us to ""share"" the $13-16 plates (main courses were even pricier at $21-27). Hence, the two starter dishes we ordered.We ordered the Chilled Shrimp Vermicelli, clearly Martha's attempt at some form of a Papaya salad. We were shocked when it came out. Sitting atop a bed of undercooked vermicelli noodles was literally one prawn. Missing were the promised bean sprouts, pistachios, and pickled kohlrabi. When you a. encourage people to share and b. have shrimp in the title, one would assume there would be more than one, MUSHY prawn. Furthermore, the salad overall had an overbearingly sweet sauce -- a clear sign of Martha's inexperience dabbling with Vietnamese food.Our second ""shared"" dish was the Swordfish poke. The $16 dish came in a tiny 4oz pickling jar swimming on a dish filled with ice. The few pieces of poke were quite literally drowning in an incredibly salty soy sauce concoction (to the point of being inedible), and the chunks of fish were slightly frozen from the ice bath.Even the dessert, the apple crisp, was an utter failure. The granola was both stale and tasted like it had been in the freezer! Ironically, it was laughably larger than both the poke and the vermicelli.To top it all off, the service was abysmal! No personality, no charm!Needless to say, I will not be going back to Martha for its pathetic attempts at dabbling in utterly unrefined, below mediocre Vietnamese ""fusion"" food. Go to Falansai in Bushwick to get your fix!",1.0

Pork was reminiscent of a pulled pork but with an Asian twist. Juicy, melt-in-your-mouth type of meal.Fried chicken with duck fat biscuits- Loved the spicy honey that came with the chicken.

"Ok so Martha's was on my to try list for brunch for quite some time and I was so excited to finally eat there on Christmas weekend (it was pretty empty) only to be kind of disappointed by the food itself.

Enough said.We ordered a lot of food for the table because it all sounded amazing.  - The Fried Chicken and Biscuit was a hit but two little pieces of chicken for $14 always feels a little ridiculous- Thai egg salad (fried eggs, celery, carrots, peanuts, shallots etc) sounded great but was heavily over sauced and is served cold. Cold eggs just don't do it for me.- Cast iron pancake - heavy and had a weird aftertaste like it was cooked near bacon or something. The apple compote on top was delicious though.- Brussel sprouts - you can almost do no wrong with brussel sprouts as far as I'm concerned except these were again a tiny bit too salty/over-spiced-Duck fat biscuit - apples on top were good but biscuit tasted too dryOverall it was a big heavy meal and I'm glad I tried it.

"A great brunch  spot.  Homey vintage decor.  Very lively and packed during brunch. Note : being seated next to the door is pretty annoying with all the constant coming and goings.. and must suck a ton during the winter months. Looks like their menu changes often but they still have staple dishes like the tso's Brussels sprouts and cast iron pancakes. After much thought we went for:* fried chicken with duck fat biscuit. The chicken crust had a nice Asian accent, sweet and nutty.  Great flavor! * Cast iron pancakes topped with creme fraîche and apple compote. Lovely presentation. The pancake was soft and slightly sweet. Friendly but painfully slow service.

The atmosphere is charming and our server was very sweet, but the kale salad was very vinegary, the carrots were still crunchy and the short rib rage was salty and stringy. we had to order a side of rice just to make it passable. Including wine, the bill was around 100 for the both of us. Not bad, but not great either.",3.0
"Lovely little brunch spot, the patio in the back is also perfect for dining al fresco on a summer's night. Staff is always friendly, interior and decor is warm, rustic yet modern. Love the enameled tableware, very french farmhouse. Many of the items of Martha's menu have been infused with some sort of Asian flavor, usually Vietnamese or Thai in my experience. The brussels sprouts are actually THAT good, and the celery salad is light, refreshing, and really tasty - even for people who usually don't like celery (myself included). Other favorites include the sunny egg and spicy pork (brunch) and the broken crepe (dinner). I like that they adjust the menu according to what is in season/available.There are a very few dishes that fall short for me, and the coffee is always way too bitter/sour for me to enjoy, but overall this is my go-to for brunch in my area. And when they get a dish right, it's really, really good.",4.0
"The restaurant that forgot to serve food! We ordered three dinners, we received at best one and a half. The PEI mussels were so small (smaller than my pinky fingernail) they could not be mistaken for a meal. The owner took them off our bill, but the member of our party who ordered them got no dinner since we couldn't hang around for the long wait for another entree. The fried chicken was tasty, but also so small that even the six year old who ate it needed a snack at home afterwards. The egg noodles with duck sausage were ok size-wise, although much blander than I expected. Martha was an enormous disappointment, we won't go there again.",1.0

"Yes, majority of us came here for the fried chicken.  And although Martha serves a tasty one with spicy honey, I am here to rave not about that but about the delicious brussels sprouts.  Please, PLEASE, do yourself a huge favor and order this!  They are served on a small skillet swimming in fish sauce, honey, with peanuts and pickled jalapeño.  It was amazing!Another thing to note is how warm service is.  Very chill, ready to help, available, but not overbearing.  A star off for excruciatingly loud music and inconsistencies with pancake.  I saw three of these during brunch including the one we ordered and I must say, they came out in different shades w one super dark, luckily ours was in the middle.  The batter consistency is definitely not pancake like, it was dense.  Tastes good but dense. Dense batter or not, we'll be back!",4.0
"The good and the bad. That's what you get at Martha's. Tonight was bad! Great people, friendly people but the food was just off! When we told the waiter that the short ribs tasted old (stale, dry, terrible smelly--like old socks) he said, oh yeah that's what this dish tastes like! Umm...at $26 a plate that's not a great response! Is the chef eating mushrooms back there? No bueno! Plenty better options in the neighborhood.

"I'm kind of laughing at some of the reviews here. It seems like some people either don't know where they're going or they have never had something different than  Macaroni and Cheese in their lives. Some people here need to re-watch some Sesame Street or go back to Chicago.First of all you can't just walk into a place because it has good reviews, if you don't like octopus trying to go to a place where that is the specialty and then complain about things like taste and texture only makes you an idiot. I'm not saying that some people didn't have bad experiences at Martha but complain because the food wasn't what you expected is just childish. If I go to a french restaurant and I order escargot and they serve me snails how is that anybody's else fault but mine? Seriously, if you are an expert in shishito peppers you should know that those aren't the most spicy peppers in the world and it seems to me that you have never tried real Indian food or Mexican for that matter. So yeah, some food at Martha is spicy and if you can't take it is maybe because you are not ready and there won't be enough shishito peppers in this world that will make you strong enough. I will recommend you to revalue your concept of spicy as is totally wrong.",4.0
"Took my dad and his GF there yesterday and we loved it. Everything we ordered was spot in and bangin!

"This a lovely place for brunch, albeit a little too 'twee for my tastes (in decor). All of their brunch items are affordable, well-designed alternative takes on standards. Fried eggs and bacon?

The egg with the pork was a perfect filling antidote to the chilly weather. My friends ordered the fried chicken with - wait for it - duck fat-cooked biscuits, which everyone raved about.

By the time we finished our meal, they were just getting their check (I would rate four stars if not for the slow service)- Sitting next to the door gets rather annoying with all the constant traffic.

"Martha is easily in my Top 5 best brunch spots, and it's all due to those prize winning brussel sprouts!!Do you remember growing up and your parents shoving veggies down your throat?  Well, brussel sprouts were not my fave at all.  What kid liked eating bitter and veggie-tasting things??  But as my palate became more advanced, so has my love for brussel sprouts.  Roasted with fish sauce, peanuts and pickled jalapenos, heaven in my mouth!!Okay, here's the skinny.  My bff and I got there right as the doors opened and situated ourselves right by the window.  We ordered brussels to share, fried chicken with duck fat biscuit and the cast iron pancake.  The pancake was very impressive, literally a cake pancake.  Thick, yet fluffy accompanied with ricotta and apple compote.  The chicken and biscuit was awesome too, I just wish the chicken was fried more.  The menu has a bit of an Asian twist to it, which gives Martha its unique flair and touch of class.  The wait was not long at all and to me, this is really not a place for kids.  As I reminisce on the old days, I don't remember my parents ever taking me to fancy places for brunch, at least not as a baby.  IMO, weekend family breakfast should be in the comforts of home.",5.0
"Was in for dinner recently and was very pleased with the menu!The dishes offered here boggled my mind, quite honestly. Everything was a little out there but not too far out. Very original and interesting selection to choose from. For reference we had:Thai Eggplant (Nam Pai, Hard Boiled Egg, Thai Bird Chilis, Basil)Cauliflower Gratin (Shallots, Thyme, Clothbound Cheddar, Smoked Paprika)Egg Noodles & Duck Sausage (Bok Choy, Scallion)Whole Brook Trout The restaurant operates in a similar fashion to Traif in Wburg (as in they bring out the dishes in the order they see fit), and as a recent Williamsburg transplant this made me happy to see. Each one of those dishes above was executed well and we enjoyed sipping on wine and savoring each bite.No hard booze, only beer and wine. I will be coming back here and would love to sit at the bar and enjoy, let's say, a brook trout with a glass of wine.",4.0
"The spicy broccoli was amazing, a perfect side for any meat dish but also good enough to eat with a small side of rice (Spicy enough to be a Korean banchan!). The fried half chicken was excellently crunchy with a very well balanced general Tso sauce having notes of spicy, sweet, and garlicky, just the right amount drizzled on quartered sections, only 2 bones in the half (thigh & drum) but no wing to be found :/ the meat was dry for me but overall satisfying. I ordered the pork loin for the fiddleheads, but was disappointed by how few and small they were. The pork loin was substantial, enough for 4. Overall a great experience, cozy venue, will probably visit again.",4.0

"It was reassuring to see the other reviews and realize my friend and i were not alone in finding our dinner so disappointing. As other dinner reviewers commented, the portions were very small for the price-- and how do you promote a dish with one prawn in the shell as good for sharing? We also had the eggplant dish but it was so salty that--despite my hunger--I could not finish it. Maybe brunch is a different experience but I would definitely not return here.",2.0

"I love Martha. It's one of the most beautiful restaurants in town-- fantastic ambiance, original and inspired meals and drinks, genuinely friendly, warm, and attentive staff, and never so busy that you can't get a table or have to scream across the table to be heard.I would have given it five stars except for this reason, and I hope that the owners are listening:I understand their reasoning behind changing from Brooklyn Sandwich Society, but I truly miss BKSS. I think it was a better restaurant then, for brunch anwyay. And Martha is a better restaurant at night.As a compromise, I would love it if at least the brunch had a better sandwich option than the ""breakfast cheeseburger"" or whatever it is. It's just a little overboard, and too large and too messy and greasy to enjoy as a sandwich anyway. It tastes good, but for breakfast, I'm just not really into it. At least do something else-- there used to be this merguez breakfast sandwich with scrambled egg on a delightful brioche bun and I could never get enough of that thing.Also, I miss the picked jalapeños that came standard with every table. Now you have to ask for them and I'm not even sure if they always have them anymore.And lastly, their menu has changed to almost be a menu of nothing but dishes inspired from China, Japan, Thailand, Vietnam. I like that they borrow ideas and techniques from those cuisines, but their menu is almost becoming a fancy Chinese restaurant more than anything. I miss some of the more New American options they once had on the menu; at least to have some variety. If I want Chinese food, I'd rather just go to a nice Chinese restaurant. Seems like they are going through a slight identity crisis and I am not sure what I think about it because, admittedly the food is still excellent. I just miss the stuff New American that used to be on the menu that they did really, REALLY well.But, all things considered, I highly recommend this place, especially for dinner. It's a really special spot and would make for a unique date place.",4.0
When you want something different for brunch. The Brussels sprouts are a must. Beijing pancake is good and surprisingly filling. Fried chicken was a loser: really dry wing and thigh with hardened (more than just crispy) spicy batter. The biscuit was huge but needed (and didn't have) a delicious butter or jam.,3.0
"Loved loved loved MarthaThe interior is decorated kind of like a vintage classroom - the pictures on Yelp so far make it look sparse, but it's very charming inside. They serve things in metal camp-style bowls and tiny cups.Our waitress was great about wine and portion recommendations. Everything is served family style and just comes out when it's ready, so it's nice for a small group. We had the cauliflower gratin (very rich and delicious, the cauliflower was still crunchy which was unexpected in a good way), the brussels sprouts (incredible, pretty spicy, almost burned again, in a good way) and the lamb meatballs (served with an egg porridge, delicious). We also split the clams & pork belly with green curry (simple, very flavorful but probably my least favorite) and the beef & egg noodles (incredible duck sausage). The best part was that with a bottle of wine, the three of us still paid under $50",4.0
"Expect a crowd at brunch. We were placed in the backyard with iced coffee on a tray as we waited for an open table.

"Martha is easily in my Top 5 best brunch spots, and it's all due to those prize winning brussel sprouts!!Do you remember growing up and your parents shoving veggies down your throat?  Well, brussel sprouts were not my fave at all.  What kid liked eating bitter and veggie-tasting things??  But as my palate became more advanced, so has my love for brussel sprouts.  Roasted with fish sauce, peanuts and pickled jalapenos, heaven in my mouth!!Okay, here's the skinny.  My bff and I got there right as the doors opened and situated ourselves right by the window.  We ordered brussels to share, fried chicken with duck fat biscuit and the cast iron pancake.  The pancake was very impressive, literally a cake pancake.  Thick, yet fluffy accompanied with ricotta and apple compote.  The chicken and biscuit was awesome too, I just wish the chicken was fried more.  The menu has a bit of an Asian twist to it, which gives Martha its unique flair and touch of class.  The wait was not long at all and to me, this is really not a place for kids.  As I reminisce on the old days, I don't remember my parents ever taking me to fancy places for brunch, at least not as a baby.  IMO, weekend family breakfast should be in the comforts of home.",5.0
"Was in for dinner recently and was very pleased with the menu!The dishes offered here boggled my mind, quite honestly. Everything was a little out there but not too far out. Very original and interesting selection to choose from. For reference we had:Thai Eggplant (Nam Pai, Hard Boiled Egg, Thai Bird Chilis, Basil)Cauliflower Gratin (Shallots, Thyme, Clothbound Cheddar, Smoked Paprika)Egg Noodles & Duck Sausage (Bok Choy, Scallion)Whole Brook Trout The restaurant operates in a similar fashion to Traif in Wburg (as in they bring out the dishes in the order they see fit), and as a recent Williamsburg transplant this made me happy to see. Each one of those dishes above was executed well and we enjoyed sipping on wine and savoring each bite.No hard booze, only beer and wine. I will be coming back here and would love to sit at the bar and enjoy, let's say, a brook trout with a glass of wine.",4.0
"The spicy broccoli was amazing, a perfect side for any meat dish but also good enough to eat with a small side of rice (Spicy enough to be a Korean banchan!). The fried half chicken was excellently crunchy with a very well balanced general Tso sauce having notes of spicy, sweet, and garlicky, just the right amount drizzled on quartered sections, only 2 bones in the half (thigh & drum) but no wing to be found :/ the meat was dry for me but overall satisfying. I ordered the pork loin for the fiddleheads, but was disappointed by how few and small they were. The pork loin was substantial, enough for 4. Overall a great experience, cozy venue, will probably visit again.",4.0
"Fantastic brunch! I hated brussel sprouts, but these are absolutely unbelievable.The pancake was burnt on the bottom, so not great there, but otherwise it was super good. The fried chicken and biscuit were surprisingly flat.The Bahn Mi was actually sweet instead of savory, but I really enjoyed it - interesting thick and gummy texture.The patio out back is straight out of a magazine.",5.0
"It was reassuring to see the other reviews and realize my friend and i were not alone in finding our dinner so disappointing. As other dinner reviewers commented, the portions were very small for the price-- and how do you promote a dish with one prawn in the shell as good for sharing? We also had the eggplant dish but it was so salty that--despite my hunger--I could not finish it. Maybe brunch is a different experience but I would definitely not return here.",2.0
These are small plates that are not small at all. I thought lamb larb was a bad idea but it was one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten. Same for duck sausage. Long beans. All wonderful. We were so full.,5.0
"I love Martha. It's one of the most beautiful restaurants in town-- fantastic ambiance, original and inspired meals and drinks, genuinely friendly, warm, and attentive staff, and never so busy that you can't get a table or have to scream across the table to be heard.I would have given it five stars except for this reason, and I hope that the owners are listening:I understand their reasoning behind changing from Brooklyn Sandwich Society, but I truly miss BKSS. I think it was a better restaurant then, for brunch anwyay. And Martha is a better restaurant at night.As a compromise, I would love it if at least the brunch had a better sandwich option than the ""breakfast cheeseburger"" or whatever it is. It's just a little overboard, and too large and too messy and greasy to enjoy as a sandwich anyway. It tastes good, but for breakfast, I'm just not really into it. At least do something else-- there used to be this merguez breakfast sandwich with scrambled egg on a delightful brioche bun and I could never get enough of that thing.Also, I miss the picked jalapeños that came standard with every table. Now you have to ask for them and I'm not even sure if they always have them anymore.And lastly, their menu has changed to almost be a menu of nothing but dishes inspired from China, Japan, Thailand, Vietnam. I like that they borrow ideas and techniques from those cuisines, but their menu is almost becoming a fancy Chinese restaurant more than anything. I miss some of the more New American options they once had on the menu; at least to have some variety. If I want Chinese food, I'd rather just go to a nice Chinese restaurant. Seems like they are going through a slight identity crisis and I am not sure what I think about it because, admittedly the food is still excellent. I just miss the stuff New American that used to be on the menu that they did really, REALLY well.But, all things considered, I highly recommend this place, especially for dinner. It's a really special spot and would make for a unique date place.",4.0
When you want something different for brunch. The Brussels sprouts are a must. Beijing pancake is good and surprisingly filling. Fried chicken was a loser: really dry wing and thigh with hardened (more than just crispy) spicy batter. The biscuit was huge but needed (and didn't have) a delicious butter or jam.,3.0

"If you're hospitable to its family-style eating, Martha is a legitimately great restaurant in the Fort Greene-Clinton Hill area. I've been in the neighborhood for 4 years, and there's never been a restaurant to come here for. Martha changes that.The atmosphere is dark and moody. The veggies and meat simmer in their own salty and savory sauces--many served sizzling in their own skillets. The serving style allows everyone to taste as much of (or none) of what they like. They happily let you order more food mid-meal. The servers are professionals. There's even outdoor seating.My only complaint is I didn't like the cocktail (Jalapeno Michelada) I ordered.",5.0

"On my first visit to Martha, for brunch, I was in like. After my second visit, this time for dinner, it may be love! Although I might have been somewhat swayed by the fact that it was my first al fresco meal after a ridiculously long winter... but I digress. The inside space has a vintage/industrial vibe and is cozy without being overcrowded, with a small bar running down one side. When we came for brunch, we snagged two seats at the bar and were very ably served by the bartender. The Stumptown coffee was strong and excellent; the food was good (we got the burger and the sunny egg & spicy pork) but we were a bit underwhelmed by the small portions on the main dishes (esp. for $15 each). When we came back for dinner we sat at one of the 4-5 big tables on the back patio, with NO WAIT (amazing). The portion sizes at dinner made more sense -- we ordered a few small plates to start off and two of the bigger plates (scallops and pork tenderloin) to share for 3 people. Everything was decent quality but the veg small plates really stood out, especially the brussels sprouts with fish sauce/jalapeno/honey.... so so good.The one thing I didn't love were the scallops -  the preparation here was weirdly rubbery. Our server was funny and verrrry laid back yet served up everything without a hitch. kudos. Minus one star for only having wine and beer + the prices being maybe $1-3 higher than where they should be for most of the menu items. But this is definitely a new neighborhood fave.",4.0

The vegetable dishes are varied, spices are interesting (and can lean to spicy so ask if heat is an issue).Cool ambiance.

"Pros: The breakfast burger is easily the best burger I've had in a long time. It is perfect w/o the lettuce & ketchup in my opinion. The pancake was also good, I'd prefer less jam.

For my fellow moms: It is marked as kid-friendly but aside from the high chairs I don't see it. No kids menu and juice is served in glasses. The bathroom is clean which was great but, the hot water is really hot and should be marked as such. Also a step stool would be great!",4.0
"Do yourself a favor and stumble on this hidden gem when you get a chance.

This place nails it on every level. If you enjoy innovative ways of eating and enjoying a meal I would go here for brunch. Whats good: The Eggs with pesto are to die for, the bread is fresh, the egg burgers were out of the ordinary but enjoyable and the pancake skillet was something my taste buds have never honed in on before leaving me wanting more.  What's not good: Its not on every corner in Brooklyn. Important note: I brought my mother here for brunch on her first visit to Fort Greene and I am proud to say she got a taste of what Fort Greene has to offer.",5.0
"I was a bit put off by this place, given the good reviews and reputation. My main beef is that two of our party of four had been looking forward to the Thai Egg Salad, which for some reason was off the menu - not a problem, but given that it was a good 20 minutes before we ordered, I'm thinking they should have been told this right when we were handed menus (or indeed, we should have been given accurate menus) rather than delivered with a shrug when they were actually ordering. Then told that the 'replacement' was an heirloom tomato salad. The waiter was taking some line on it being a pretty comparable substitute on the basis that ""it's made with the same dressing"". The portion that arrived - a $16 salad, no less - was, let's say, a 'delicate' portion of sliced beef tomatoes. No cute little vine or cherries. No variegated yellows and oranges. Just perfectly nice, standard (a little bit stalky), chopped beef tomatoes. And dressing. $16 just feels very cheeky to me for what was really a side dish that probably had a procurement cost of $2.50.Also my drink didn't appear until food arrived; it was only lemonade. And, despite there being steamed rice in the entrees, my friend was told (again, in a very shruggy way) that they definitely couldn't/wouldn't do a side of steamed rice for her. I don't know. Usually I'd accept that if it's not specifically offered, that's that. But after the salad nonsense and general lack of interest in providing the kind of meal we were hoping for, I took a poor view of this. Also the bad hip-hop that was playing for the first 40 minutes, given the acoustics and the layout, made it a bit hard to hear my friends. My pbj toast WAS good, I'll grant. And my $5 lemonade was pleasingly tart. But overall I feel like they're coasting on this neighbourhood image they've fostered, which from what I saw, was not really earned",2.0

And my friend decided midway through ordering that she wanted to get something more eggy and traditional brunchy, though I personally was stoked about the off-the-beaten-brunch-path menu.

Not that he doesn't fulfill what I want but simply he looks at my face blank, goes and comes back. For example, I asked him if they had honey and he didn't say a word only to come back with honey a few minutes later. I guess I can live with that. Second thing was that I asked for some more side salad that came with the burger. He said he could give me the radish salad instead, which is pretty much the same thing with radishes on top, he claimed. I knew he didn't want to give the side salad for free, and I was willing to pay for it because I loved the greens there so much so I didn't mind. But what arrived was completely different. It didn't have the same greens, plus not only radishes but anchovies too. He didn't even care to mention. When I confronted him, he said it is similar and uses the same dressing. He didn't even seem to understand. At that point I got so mad but I calmed myself, thinking that I'd take my revenge by tipping less. But his shift ended and I had to tip properly in order to avoid a conflict. This place is trying to be so cool and edgy but it's just over the top wanna be hipstery and the attitude is annoying. They don't even have an espresso machine nor proper tea. I don't think it'll last.",2.0

"I wanted to love this place. What is not to like when you offer Asian + American food served in cast iron pans? Amazing right? Not really. The food was ok, My table of 3 shared the Fried Chicken and Biscuit, Sunny Egg with Greens, Shaved Celery Salad, and Squash Fritters. The only thing that was memorable enough to go back for was the biscuit. The portions were small and the prices were high. My sunny egg and greens was so bland I lamented not cooking breakfast myself and I doused it in hotsauce in order to make it slightly more exciting. My egg was also overcooked. The fried chicken was good but then again what fried chicken isn't? It did not stand out amongst Wangs or Pies'n'Thighs, but the spicy honey served with it was tasty. The shaved celery almost made me leave. It was not special, it was small and it was served in the most absurd way on a very cute Brooklyn slab of slate. Slate is beautiful, especially beautiful against shades of green like celery..but WHY WHY would someone decide to serve a salad with dripping  dressing on something flat? Use those slate slabs for cheese, or something that doesn't slide around. You have to eat that salad with  extreme care in order for the dressing not to drip off the artisanal display you are paying $9 for. I love breakfast. I don't mind paying money for entertainment and a good experience. I even don't mind paying top dollar for tiny amounts of really special, beautifully plated ridiculously absurd food. But the key there is DELICIOUS. Martha's looks and tastes like a mash up of all things Brooklyn but it just doesn't work. Their cocktails actually seem to achieve their New American + Asian spin. They are original, delicious, and worth their price.The service is also excellent and our waiter was very nice, attentive and informative.

They don't even have an espresso machine nor proper tea. I don't think it'll last.",2.0
Great food. Got the fried chicken. It was delish. My roomie got the steak and it was good. Nothing special. The food comes out when it is ready but there was a long wait between my roomie getting her steak and me getting my fried chicken ... Like 15 minutes.,4.0

"I wanted to love this place. What is not to like when you offer Asian + American food served in cast iron pans? Amazing right? Not really. The food was ok, My table of 3 shared the Fried Chicken and Biscuit, Sunny Egg with Greens, Shaved Celery Salad, and Squash Fritters. The only thing that was memorable enough to go back for was the biscuit. The portions were small and the prices were high. My sunny egg and greens was so bland I lamented not cooking breakfast myself and I doused it in hotsauce in order to make it slightly more exciting. My egg was also overcooked. The fried chicken was good but then again what fried chicken isn't? It did not stand out amongst Wangs or Pies'n'Thighs, but the spicy honey served with it was tasty. The shaved celery almost made me leave. It was not special, it was small and it was served in the most absurd way on a very cute Brooklyn slab of slate. Slate is beautiful, especially beautiful against shades of green like celery..but WHY WHY would someone decide to serve a salad with dripping  dressing on something flat? Use those slate slabs for cheese, or something that doesn't slide around. You have to eat that salad with  extreme care in order for the dressing not to drip off the artisanal display you are paying $9 for. I love breakfast. I don't mind paying money for entertainment and a good experience. I even don't mind paying top dollar for tiny amounts of really special, beautifully plated ridiculously absurd food. But the key there is DELICIOUS. Martha's looks and tastes like a mash up of all things Brooklyn but it just doesn't work. Their cocktails actually seem to achieve their New American + Asian spin. They are original, delicious, and worth their price.The service is also excellent and our waiter was very nice, attentive and informative. Spare yourself the gimmicky tiny cast iron pan dishes which are cute but unremarkable. I would recommend coming here for the biscuit and a cocktail only.",3.0
"Adorable garden in the back, and a cute hipster vibe up front.  The brussel sprouts were something incredible and while I was sad the duck fat biscuit didn't come with a jam, jelly or marmalade, it too was pretty tasty.  The elderflower fizz was the perfect liquid companion for a sunny weekend brunch.  Service was very good as well and I didn't feel like I'd be bankrupt after getting the check.  A solid spot!",4.0

The drinks were yummy. I had both the tamarind soda and the bloody betty and I recommend both. I like my Bloody Mary's to have good zesty tomato flavor and this did. Although, the glass was also filled with herbs that got in my teeth (so be warned). I was excited about the cauliflower fritters, but they were only OK. The sauce was what made them, but mine were too doughy for my liking. The Bahn Mi Tartine was the reason I really wanted to go and definitely worth it. The prok was thick and fatty but there was acid and jalapenos (not too much) that cut the greasiness of the fat.

"I walk by this place every day on my way to work, so I was very excited to finally try it.  It was a hot Friday night and since they don't have AC, so the crowd was thin.  Sure, it was hot inside, but I can't fault them for that.  I can fault them for the bad service and the mediocre food that was super slow.  They practically ignored us and gave us no updates on the slow food delivery.   We tried to order a drink while we waited and I thought that would be fast since the bartender appeared to be doing nothing, but no, that was slow as well.As for the food, I can start with the positives: the brussel sprouts (as I've seen in other reviews) were great.  Really flavorful and cooked well with a good char, just the way I like it.  The tuna app was super small and salty.  The 'broken crepe' had horribly overdone and chewy calamari with tiny scallops that were lost in the dish and maybe 1 mussel in the entire plate.  We also had the pardon peppers which were good but strangle covered with unappetizing, salty tiny shrimp.I'm also confused by the menu.  They list all their dishes the same, and the waitress told us that the size depended on what we were getting.  Some were small, others good for sharing and other were full entrees.  Fine, I understand the idea of Tapas, but then when we got our bill, some were clearly listed as appetizers, others as sides, and others as entrees.  If they're defined that way in the kitchen, why not just put that in the menu?  It would have really helped us make decisions on what to buy.",1.0

They were awesome. Next came the fried half-chicken which was very tender - you could tell this was good quality chicken. Side of broccoli rabe was too spicy for me (waiter warned us of this, so no complaints here) but the bf loved it. My favorite dish of the whole night, though, was the sweet corn. Miso butter and almonds? You betcha. For dessert we had the green tea creme brulee which was interesting and refreshing but not something I'd need to get again. Overall we were very pleased, we felt it was very reasonably priced, and the server was wonderfully laid back and smiley, the atmosphere is nice and dark for a date, and we'll go back soon.

"Overall: 3 - 3.5 Stars. DUCK FAT BISCUIT (5 Stars).Martha had been on our radar for a while -- a cute brunch spot across the street from Fort Greene Park, offering interesting fare? We were certainly sold. With that, the three of us trekked to that magical land in search of the perfect brunch.Upon arrival at around 1 p.m. we were informed that the wait would be around 30 minutes and that we would be called when a table opened up. Usually, such a wait would be incentive enough to venture elsewhere, but with the park so close, it is an excellent excuse to get one's exercise in before the gluttony that will inevitably ensue.In thirty minutes, true to her word, we received the call and were promptly seated at a cozy corner table. Like all good things in Brooklyn, the tables are cramped and we were treated to a neighbor taking about 450 photos of her food with her DSLR and iPhone. God knows, these weren't just eggs...these were apparently blog-worthy eggs served in their own pan. Novelty -- people love it. In any event, kvetching aside, the restaurant is very cute and will certainly serve your needs for a weekend brunch if you're with a smaller party.The FoodWe ordered the Banh Mi Tartine, Quiche, Sunny Egg & Spicy Pork and the DUCK FAT BISCUIT. The Banh Mi was disappointing, with the duck liver mousse difficult to spot on the bread and the pork belly a little underwhelming, while the other two options were marginally more impressive. I opted for the sunny egg & spicy pork which was flavorful, though the meat was not as tender as one would hope and it was very spicy indeed (I'm usually a fan of spice in all its glorious forms). But forget about all that: THE DUCK FAT BISCUIT WITH MAPLE BUTTER AND APPLE COMPOTE was INCREDIBLE. EAT IT for, in doing so, you will find happiness. Conclusion: Overall, I'm not sure that Martha is a destination brunch spot, but it offers solid fare and exceptional biscuits that are well worth your time. If you're in the market for a romantic stroll in the park, followed by a perfectly charming brunch, this should be on your radar.",3.0

Unpretentious, warm, knowledgeable and personable are the characteristics I like best in restaurant service.Now, for the food:   -Kale, mustard greens, pesto, sunny-side up egg.

I am not a giant fried chicken connoisseur because it always seems imposing and gregarious in that special way only a giant piece of battered chicken ribs, wings, and breast can, but THIS chick was done right. Even the most timid chicken eater will surely fall in love. Spicy honey sauce for dipping? Damn, it doesn't get better than that.    Michelada: I was surprised that it was sans tomato juice. Then I sipped it. And I never want tomato juice in my Michelada again.Do yourself a favor and drink their sumptuous coffee black. Slightly sharp, deep woodsy flavor with no acid-y bite. Their purveyor is Stumptown coffee and that artisanal coffee is worth the extra 1.50. Don't be a douche and spoil it with cream and sugar.Happy brunching!",5.0
Very sweet staff but when it comes to dining experience food matters. There are things on the menu that are great like cauliflower frites and egg over pulled pork but the kitchen has to get their act in order and make sure the food is properly cooked. Their fried chicken came out undercooked and that is big minus in my book. Of course they took it off the bill but the consequences of eating it could be much more expensive than the $16 price tag. Hope the kitchen just had a bad day and it's not a tendency.,2.0

"After a rough morning of seeking an eatery to satisfy a long weekend of travel and adventure, I stumbled upon an adventure in itself. Martha, formally known as Brooklyn Sandwich Society, offered an array of decadent American classics.As soon as you walk into this establishment, you are feel as if you were taken back in time. The existence of your former self is left at the door upon entry of this institution. The experience is hair-raising.All flavors come from local vendors which ultimately results in perfect piquant dishes. The aroma of the duck fat biscuit was inconceivable. The sensual essence that arose from the perfection that laid before me indubitably aroused every neuron within my nasal cavity. My legs quivered upon its arrival in mouth. The flakes attacked my taste buds with a rich and erotic flavor boasting a host of salts and fats which satisfied every last receptor in my gustatory stimuli.I briefly came to the realization that this may be the restaurant I have been searching for my entire life; before being disconnecting from reality again as I was wrapped up in a warm blanket of indulgence. Which leads me to ask the question - What is Martha? Go to 184 Dekalb in Fort Greene and help me find an answer for the odyssey that I embarked on.",5.0
Do yourself a favor and DON'T go here.The food was mediocre-bad and the service sucked a big one (I've waited tables plenty so I'm usually forgiving).Was with a party of 6 and we were literally in there for over 2 hours. The 4 dudes at the table all got the fried chicken and biscuits. I think the meal took so long because the chicken tasted like it had been in the fryer for 1 hr 45 min. And apparently the fryer wasn't big enough for 8 pieces of chicken (only 7 fit in there at a time) so one poor soul at the table got his 2nd piece of chicken 10 mins after everyone.I ordered the kale/egg dish as did the other gal in our party. Literally 1 egg on top of soggy kale. No other veggies that were listed on menu.Not to mention the bartender was weird and wouldn't give my husband a straight answer on the price of his beverage.The worst. Don't go.,1.0

"First of all, I think this place has the best name ever (not that I'm biased or anything... haha)I went with a couple of really good friends for my birthday because one of our friends was RAVING about it.  I like restaurants worth RAVING about.  This place is only open for weekend brunch and dinner (all week).  Once I saw the menu, I understood why.  Their menu isn't super complicated or involved.  They've got like 12 things for brunch and like 12 things for dinner, that's it.  No more no less.  All of the items are on the simpler end with slight creative twists and all are really well done.  I don't know about the entire menu, but for dinner I had some of the squash, ribs and the duck sausage with egg noodles.  All were  really really tasty.  My friend from Texas said the ribs were some of the best he's had in the city (a high complement from a Texan).Most of the staff is super silly and fun, which is totally up our alley, being silly people ourselves.  Service is quick and thorough, as well.I'll definitely go back.  I'm curious about their brunch :)FYI:  It gets PACKED at like 8:30ish on Saturdays, so go on the earlier end.",4.0

There are things on the menu that are great like cauliflower frites and egg over pulled pork but the kitchen has to get their act in order and make sure the food is properly cooked. Their fried chicken came out undercooked and that is big minus in my book. Of course they took it off the bill but the consequences of eating it could be much more expensive than the $16 price tag. Hope the kitchen just had a bad day and it's not a tendency.,2.0
"I love the atmosphere BUT don't like the fact they don't scramble eggs or do sides of bacon or grits. Other than that, it was good. I'd go back! I'm giving it 3 because they don't have their liquor license yet, they don't scramble eggs or offer sides in addition to the entree. However, the food is filling!",3.0
"Cast iron skillets! Great for brunch or dinner. Have been here 4 times now and every time the menu is different and it always delivers. Original, seasonal, and fresh. Definitely one of my favorite neighborhood spots!",5.0
"After a rough morning of seeking an eatery to satisfy a long weekend of travel and adventure, I stumbled upon an adventure in itself. Martha, formally known as Brooklyn Sandwich Society, offered an array of decadent American classics.As soon as you walk into this establishment, you are feel as if you were taken back in time. The existence of your former self is left at the door upon entry of this institution. The experience is hair-raising.All flavors come from local vendors which ultimately results in perfect piquant dishes. The aroma of the duck fat biscuit was inconceivable. The sensual essence that arose from the perfection that laid before me indubitably aroused every neuron within my nasal cavity. My legs quivered upon its arrival in mouth. The flakes attacked my taste buds with a rich and erotic flavor boasting a host of salts and fats which satisfied every last receptor in my gustatory stimuli.I briefly came to the realization that this may be the restaurant I have been searching for my entire life; before being disconnecting from reality again as I was wrapped up in a warm blanket of indulgence. Which leads me to ask the question - What is Martha? Go to 184 Dekalb in Fort Greene and help me find an answer for the odyssey that I embarked on.",5.0
Do yourself a favor and DON'T go here.The food was mediocre-bad and the service sucked a big one (I've waited tables plenty so I'm usually forgiving).Was with a party of 6 and we were literally in there for over 2 hours. The 4 dudes at the table all got the fried chicken and biscuits. I think the meal took so long because the chicken tasted like it had been in the fryer for 1 hr 45 min. And apparently the fryer wasn't big enough for 8 pieces of chicken (only 7 fit in there at a time) so one poor soul at the table got his 2nd piece of chicken 10 mins after everyone.I ordered the kale/egg dish as did the other gal in our party. Literally 1 egg on top of soggy kale. No other veggies that were listed on menu.Not to mention the bartender was weird and wouldn't give my husband a straight answer on the price of his beverage.The worst. Don't go.,1.0

"First of all, I think this place has the best name ever (not that I'm biased or anything... haha)I went with a couple of really good friends for my birthday because one of our friends was RAVING about it.  I like restaurants worth RAVING about.  This place is only open for weekend brunch and dinner (all week).  Once I saw the menu, I understood why.  Their menu isn't super complicated or involved.  They've got like 12 things for brunch and like 12 things for dinner, that's it.  No more no less.  All of the items are on the simpler end with slight creative twists and all are really well done.  I don't know about the entire menu, but for dinner I had some of the squash, ribs and the duck sausage with egg noodles.  All were  really really tasty.  My friend from Texas said the ribs were some of the best he's had in the city (a high complement from a Texan).Most of the staff is super silly and fun, which is totally up our alley, being silly people ourselves.  Service is quick and thorough, as well.I'll definitely go back.  I'm curious about their brunch :)FYI:  It gets PACKED at like 8:30ish on Saturdays, so go on the earlier end.",4.0
"Great place. Had lunch (technically brunch) here on a Saturday. They had some unfortunate technical issues in the kitchen so our food took forever to arrive. However, they were wonderful about it. They apologized and comped almost our entire bill. We ended up paying $9 for the three of us. I've seen places do a lot less for worse issues. It also helps that the food is fantastic. I highly recommend the Breakfast Cheeseburger.",4.0
"okay but probably won't rush back here. The atmosphere is great - well spaced tables, pleasant bar/stool space, not too loud so easy to have a conversation, great outdoor seating, friendly and attentive service, ample wine servings, etc. But the food is so so. We ordered the cauliflower and brussel sprout appetizers. The portions were very generous (we probably could have stopped there or skipped one of our two entrees and been sated) but they were absolutely drenched in soy sauce. So much so they were virtually indistinguishable in taste from one another (the brussel sprouts were brown to the core with the stuff). On a positive note, the the peanuts in both sauces were a nice addition. For entrees we had the egg noodle with duck and beef pho. The former was okay but won't have me scurrying back for more. The duck had no flavor and the sauce, once again, was kind of overwhelming. The beef pho was like eating dirt. I know I'm supposed to add sauce to give it flavoring but there is only so much you can do. Maybe this is the norm with beef pho but none the less, I didn't enjoy it. Total tab before tax/tip with 2 glasses of wine was $79.",3.0
"Been twice since the re-opening.  Once for dinner and once for brunch. Both times were f'in excellent and the staff was very knowledgeable and chill.   Nothing against Walters, #7, or General Greene which are all good FG spots but Martha is def more relaxing, quiet, and delicious so it's going to take up a top spot in a the weekly rotation.    A lot of care goes into each dish and those other places get so busy things seemed rushed lately.    I think the menu changes a lot but standout dishes were the spicy pork and eggs for brunch and the roasted eggplant side.",4.0

"The congee is delicious, but the meatballs next to it don't make any sense -- they should put a fried dough with it, similar to how real congee is served.

The table next to us was getting Italian-style over-service from their server, while our server spoke maybe 3 words to us, couldn't remember who ordered what (there were 2 of us), and we had to flag the hostess down to get menus. Our server was clearly burned out. They need a service manager in there, and maybe a female server (all servers that night were male). Too bad, it ruined the experience for us. I live around the corner and will NOT be going back.The place is also over-run with Manhattanites who read the recent NY Times review.",2.0

Our server was friendly, and the service was fast. My brother and I shared the brussels sprouts (glorious) and the swordfish poke (also delicious), and I had a bite of his pork belly bao (the flavor profile was not as interesting as the other dishes, but it was very well prepared).

"My friend and I picked Martha for brunch on a rainy Sunday morning. What a perfect choice for a not-so-perfect day. We were seated at a back corner table, and the server was attentive right away and throughout the meal, but not hovering so that we had plenty of time to catch up and chat. They serve Stumptown coffee which is normally not my favorite, but they must have a brew master back there, because it tasted great today. My friend ordered the Sunny Egg and Greens and really enjoyed it. They were willing to cook the dish to her specifications as well. I had the Cast Iron Pancake. WOW. This pancake is so good. It comes with apply compote and ricotta topping. Both dishes came in a cast iron pan approx 2-3 inches deep, so the pancake was a thick truly cake-like deep dish breakfast. The combination of the delicious fall spiced apple, the sweetness of the ricotta, and the thick pancake really was a satisfying brunch. I cannot say enough about brunch at Martha. My friend and I noted the backyard and cannot wait to come back many times, including for drinks in that great backyard come spring!",5.0
"This place is super busy all the time. And there is a reason. Granted I've only been here for brunch, but every time I've gone it's been fantastic. I had the sunny egg and spicy pork which comes all together in a skillet and it was so freaking good. The whole atmosphere is so Brooklyn, so be prepared. But the staff is great and good at creating conversation with their patrons. ONLY reason I took a star off is I guess I wish the brunch menu had a touch more variety...although the ingredients are all so fresh and local that there probably is a reason for the small menu. Either way, going back again soon.",4.0
"Perhaps I came here on a bad Sunday night, but I was really disappointed with Martha.  I've been wanting to try this place for a while and was really excited to finally get the chance to do so. My initial impression of the place was great (ambiance and setting). I especially loved the outdoor space in the back. After we got seated, we just waited... Waited to be served. I honestly think our waiter forgot so we just shrugged it off. Then the food started to arrive. We ordered brussel sprouts, eggplants, and vermicelli - they were ALL overly salty from being dumped in fish sauce (and I am not the type of person who is sensitive about salt). It was so bad we ended up ordering a side of sticky rice to go with the dishes. It's now the following day and my tongue still hurts from all the salt. I really hope they just messed up our dishes because I can't believe they would have the nerve to actually serve dishes likes them on their menu.",2.0

No good bye...nothing. For all the lack of service we could have been in a cafeteria. The food was good but not memorable enough to warrant the rudeness.
