"As much as I wanted to give La Cigogne 5 stars on my last visit here, a major service snafu got in the way of that. However, I knew I'd be back because despite this, the food was phenomenal. So when it was time to recently pick a place for a party of 9 when a few friends decided to get together, I promoted coming here. Well, the cold plates and appetizer-style dishes came out before the mains , there was time in between every course, AND all silverware was present throughout the meal at all times without having to remind anyone ( the service was generally amicable as well, it's not easy to work a party of 9 and she did a fantastic job), so all that was left to focus on for the review was the food. But that's the easy part here. The food was excellent. The vibe/interior was excellent. In this regard, nothing has changed from the first visit. The restaurant was absolutely full this time around, which should not be too much of a surprise; a good restaurant will have a good turnout on a weekend. You can take a look at some of the items I noted in the last review. I don't think you can go wrong with the food here; every last person in our party had nothing but good things to say about what they had ordered. The tarte flambés were all a hit, my favorite one being the bacon, swiss and honey. I decided to go with a burger this time around (pretzel bun is an easy sell, and I half-regretted not trying it my first visit) and that was a solid choice; cooked perfectly medium. Camambert was a big hit, and the Nemrod spätzle was beloved. Dessert raised eyebrows, especially the apple tart and crème brulee. Besides the mains, you can order a whole bunch of items and share amongst your party; that way you get to try a bit of all the deliciousness. Cocktail and beer menu are another positive point; modestly  sized but impressive in quality. Will be back, probably even a few times in the next few months.",5.0
"The foie gras was not what I was expecting presentation-wise, but was melt-in-your mouth delicious. My girlfriend had a tequila pepper cocktail that was very tasty with a hint of spice.Our meal included the steak tartare and the squid ink spaetzle...both of which I recommend and both of which I would get again.The check-in also granted me a flight with a nice variety of beers.",4.0
"Came here w my bestfriends for a night out to catchup. Found this cute and cozy spot on Yelp. It is pretty dim inside, small but spaced out tables, full on bar, music (well i dont rem hearin anythin i kno.. Lol) and the bathroom was very nice!We had the mussels w french fries, pan seared scallops w asparagus, apple and walnut salad (all yummy!) their mussels portion was a lot! I also liked the fact that their cheese on the salad was fried into a ball and u jus break it up. Super cool idea and def tasty!My gf had the burger, and my other friend and i had the filet mignon. It was cooked nicely, layin nicely over an onion patty (my bestfriend really liked this) and their cocktail drinks!!!Overall definitely a nice spot!",4.0
"This restaurant had been on my ""to try"" list for some time after I saw all the glowing reviews. Since we visited Brooklyn over Valentine's Day weekend, I was very excited to come here to celebrate. However, there were a couple of things that were a little off about our experience. My first disappointment was that their special $65 Valentine's Day prix-fixe menu consisted of 3 courses of mostly anything but Alsatian food: 1) sesame-crusted seared tuna or burrata caprese, 2) beef wellington or vegetarian beet spatzle, and 3) upside down apple tarte or chocolate coulant (gluten-free molten chocolate ""cake""). Holistically, it was an Asian-fusion-Italian-British-modified Alsatian-French meal. I have traveled to about 20 countries, and this was probably the most incoherent meal I've ever had. In the world. In addition, for the price point, all of the dishes oddly exhibited noticeable lack of thought and attention to detail. I am not sure why a menu for a day celebrating love would be so devoid of love. The sesame-crusted tuna tasted fresh, but for the price and portion, the dish was heavily deficient in flavor and texture. A bit of citrus might have gone a long way. The burrata caprese tasted similar to typical tomato-mozzarella caprese, but with less visual appeal than typically presented in a restaurant of this price point. The burrata slices looked sloppily cut and hastily stacked with a few basil leaves and unripened, pastel-colored tomato slices. The soggy-crusted beef wellington was also flavorless and cooked well-done despite our medium temperature selection. It came with some thin stems of asparagus and flavorless mashed potatoes, along with a thin film of sour red wine sauce, which did not help offset the dryness of the meat. Perhaps the least visually appealing items of the night were the desserts - both seemingly popped right out of their respective baking pans, right onto the plate. Desserts with simple embellishments sometimes make up for their appearance through deep, complex taste and texture, but these did not. The coulant was rubbery and could have used some more chocolate, while the up-side down apple tart was just some molded baked apples loosely placed over a disk of pie crust. The lackluster food was complemented by peculiar service. There were several servers on the shift, but only one seemed alert. It's too bad he was not our server. Though we were one of the first tables to arrive, many tables that arrived later were checked-on first and given bread and butter immediately, while the staff walked by us many times without checking in or giving us bread. From a perception standpoint, it didn't help that those tables were all occupied by Caucasians while ours wasn't. We were finally given bread and butter half an hour later, after I specifically flagged down a busser/runner and asked for it, but the bread turned out to be stale and dry. The champagne glass that came with the meal was okay, but the only thing that truly washed away some of our sorrow due to the food and service was the draft beer tasting that came with our Yelp check-ins. Those were actually pretty decent. It's totally possible that the food and service are typically better than this, but given the plethora of dining options in the NYC area, I can't say I'll be rushing back to find out. Also, when I initially called to ask for available reservations, they stated the only time was 9:30. Since I knew they stay open between lunch and dinner shifts, I asked if they had anything earlier - to which they responded 5:30, so I assumed they were booked between 5:30 and 9:30. I went ahead and reserved the 5:30 slot, until I happened to be on OpenTable and saw they had availability at 6:00, 6:30, 7:00, 7:30, etc... Obviously, they wanted me to avoid the potential 7PM rush, but OpenTable has a feature for restaurants to block time slots or control the number of parties/tables reserved at any given time, and they could easily have used that feature instead of saying something that wasn't true. It was altogether a very strange experience.",3.0
taste and service wise everything here was quite fulfilling. You can't go wrong with the burger and fries. The Eggs Benny is a great brunch option. I like the home fries well done. Will be back to try more yum.,4.0
"I couldn't have asked for a lovelier dining experience this freezing afternoon. From the moment we entered La Cigogne, the hosts were charming, attentive, and very friendly. The decor was was both cozy and modern, with a blazing fireplace and a hokey yet sweet beer-themed plaque hanging in the men's room...my friend told me. We ordered the macaroni and cheese, which would have been embarrassing if not for the fact that it was too delicious to bother being embarrassed by. Our other starters were onion soup (French, obviously) and the lobster/crab cake duo. All were rich, creamy and marvelous.Our entrees were the burger, medium rare, which came on a fluffy pretzel bun, and the steak tartare. Both came with thick-cut, perfectly browned fries (French, obviously) which were too beautiful to ignore, despite my efforts. This place has everything I look for in a restaurant -- clean and cozy bathrooms, a thoughtful, varied menu, unpretentious waitstaff, warm lighting, good wine, and pelicans. When they manage to fix this ridiculous cold weather, I'll consider giving the place a sixth star...",5.0
"This place is great! Food is delicious all around, and the bacon is out of this world. Staff were all very accommodating, and space has a welcoming, homey feel. Definitely going back! Try the french orange beer and flammekueche if you go.",5.0
"My friend and I went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon and-- despite the good reviews-- there was no wait.Upon entering and hearing the cries of other people's children in an open and cavernous space, the reason became abundantly clear. Not everyone wants to contend with babies while dining. Especially not people who endure brunch as a competitive line-waiting and day-drinking activity.However, if you simply want a nice breakfast, this is a great spot. Even though the space feels a bit clinical, not sitting alongside the neighboring table is a treat and feels intimate (there is plenty of room for strollers).This is an Alsatian place; it is, as they say, ""not quite French, not fully German."" Both of those things are good. The service was attentive and friendly.We shared the tarte flambées les champignons and eggs Norwegian (wait, weren't we talking about Alsace?). The tarte was unbelievable: paper thin, crisp, served on a wood board, with the sour taste of creme fraiche, meatiness of bacon, and earthiness of mushrooms delicately seasoned with nutmeg and lemon zest. The eggs Norwegian were perfectly poached, with a rich hollandaise, generous amounts of salmon, sides of potatoes and onions, and that ubiquitous salad mix of baby spinach, lettuce, and radicchio. There is a Yelp offer for a taste of Alsatian beer-- it was citrusy and delicious. The coffee was good, and the Bloody Mary was strong and spicy.  Overall, a sweet, tucked away spot that is definitely worth a visit.",4.0
"This place always seemed so inviting when passing by, and given it was a perfect evening that felt more like early September than October, it was impossible to pass up the outdoor seating (especially with the stellar Yelp rating).  When we got there we were one of 3 tables so figured we were in for some pretty attentive and quick service. Yelp has a check in offer for sample of one of their ""famous Alsation beers"" so decided to try that only to be told they were out of all the special beers and so just asked for a sample of whatever they had.  We then ordered the seafood spätzle and the beer beef spätzle only to learn they were out of the beef one so ended up with the chicken spätzle.  At this point our waitress disappears and we wait and wait and are surprised at no drink and how long two dishes are taking in an empty restaurant. Once our food came out a busboy brought it so could ask about our drinks so gave up and just went for the food. The great news was that the spätzle was really very good, and would definitely get a solid 4 in my book. The chicken spätzle is almost like a light Mac and cheese and the seafood had a good tomato sauce and a little heat. The strange thing was that no one came to check in on us (again in a nearly empty restaurant...although the manager I assume came out at one point to talk about the history of place for about 10 minutes to the table next to us).  When our waitress finally came to see how things were (with 90% of my dish gone) I mentioned the missing beer and was going to skip it but she insisted on getting.  To be clear the staff was very pleasant (albeit a bit aloof) and the place does have a nice vibe and good spätzle; however, based on experience tonight can't see going back which I have to give the place a 3.",3.0
"Let me say one thing:Spätzle Nemrod with bacon. This is a glorious piece of manna from on high. It's the Alsace equivalent of buffalo chicken Mac-n-cheese. A true comfort food for a frigid night. Yes, it's that good. Let me say a few more things:It was FREEZING outside when my six friends and I came here. The hosts felt bad that we had to be seated by the door (there weren't any large tables left) so they, without asking, brought out a few space heaters to keep the party warm. Unfortunately, they had to unplug the space heaters because they cause the lights out front to turn off haha. We tried a few of the tarts flambees (basically giant flatbreads with delicious toppings). La Schmidt (chicken ratatouille flatbread) was wonderful. La Veggie was nice. They topped La Chèvre (bacon goat cheese flatbread) with honey imported from somewhere very special and rare and interesting or something. It made everyone smile.The waiters will make you smile. The food will make you warm. The company will uh...make you something. (Sorry, I don't know your friends.)Anyways, go to this place.",4.0
"Great place to share a few plates and just relax. Despite being a French restaurant, La Cigogne is very accessible and has a more loungey feel than an expensive snooty establishment.Shared a few appetizers and one main. For apps, we had the foie gras (pate medallions with toast points) and the French onion soup. Both were good and the soup was pretty heavy (in a good/traditional way).For our main, we went with the chicken in mushroom sauce with Brussels sprouts and truffle mashed potatoes. If the soup was heavy, then the chicken dish was colossal. The truffle mashed potatoes were as good as they sound. And the mushroom sauce was really well done, though I wish there were more of it. The chicken was a bit dry (all white meat) and very neutral.Service was fine, and we were able to just walk in on a weeknight and be seated immediately. Would definitely come back sometime. Come with an appetite!",4.0
"Let me start out by stating that I am SO SORRY that we used this as our pre-game for Lucali down the street (read: not worth it - DiFara remains King in that arena). So, we were told that we had a 2.5 hour (!!) wait for Lucali - we wanted to go, but we were hungry. So we meandered down the street and found La Cigogne. It is an Alsatian restaurant - with a classy, yet modern vibe (the FIFA Women's Soccer game was playing and many of us were watching). PLUS, the service is excellent. From the minute we walked in, to when we left, we felt like GUESTS. You know what I mean? First, the bread and butter. They were great. Bread had fresh crusts and chewy insides and fresh, creamy butter. I need to put that out there, because I have recently encountered some of the WORST bread ever when I have dined in Brooklyn (i.e., Frankie's Spuntino, Bacchus). Next, the Mussels (Moules Marienieres). At first totally deceiving... Seemingly small portion. But then we got to the sauce and ... WOW. It is a truly french white wine garlic sauce. Decadent, luscious, and blended really well.Then, the Tuna Tartare. I am not sure that this is served in Alsace, but so be it. It was GREAT. Chunky and full of flavor. The avocado, ginger, cucumber and lemon were perfectly rationed. I also had the Pinot Blanc from Alsace (I mean, must order the Alsatian wine, right?) and it was so nice and well paired with our appetizers. I was surprised by my affinity towards this place, since a glance at the menu shouts German-ish bready, noodly, carb-filled food - which is not my schtick. But, I would definitely go back... and actually look forward to it.",4.0
"Food was okay. I got the Mac and cheese which was delicious and the French onion soup which was underwhelming. Wish the onions were cooked down WAYYYYYY more like it would be in actual French onion soup. I was disappointed. I also with there was some sort of broth to dip it in but that's just my opinion. Everyone else enjoyed their food. My one suggestion is DO NOT come in the winter time. The restaurant has no heat. That little fire place does NOTHING unless you stand right next to it. Went to the restaurant this past weekend as a party of 8 and most kept their jackets and scarfs on. Nice restaurant but good Lord invest in some heat! There were even little space heaters in the bathroom (which did nothing). And what seemed to be little heaters in the back but it did not help. The entire party just kept ordering tea to somewhat keep warm. Maybe I'll return in the spring or summer. Never an excuse to have customers freezing. It's NYC, it's gets cold, I've never been to a restaurant that doesn't have heat in the winter. Wherever I go, I like to eat and enjoy comfortably.

"Very cute spot, with simple yet warm decor and a nice - but fake - fireplace. We were served by Sid, who was perfect with us: professional and accommodating.

Oven baked Camembert: a delectable appetizer, so good you would keep asking for more; the Camembert cheese is beautifully complemented by the cranberry jam... a must. Spätzle Gambrinus: a huge portion with huge chunks of mouthwatering beef stew; great for sharing. House burger w/ fries: although cooked precisely as requested, the burger could have been warmer and needed more salt; the fries were very good, though.Overall, La Cigogne is solid, and will not disappoint your expectations.

They saved us a great spot on the patio and brought water for my dog before I even had to ask.The mushroom tart flambe was delicious! The creme fraiche was a delicious touch. French onion soup is also perfectly seasoned and the cheese on top was nice and gooey! The French onion soup sandwich was also good, but a little dry for my taste. Not my number 1 reco. Our server was so kind and attentive. Really loved this place--we will definitely be back!",5.0
"I originally wanted to have brunch but I don't think they do brunch during weekdays...at least I don't think so since there wasn't a menu for it. We also got there at around noon haha.HOWEVER~ this place is fantastic. I'll say this right now: It's expensive. Do not come here trying to spend $20 for a full meal (appetizer, entree, dessert) and get upset about the price. It's worth the money so we had no qualms paying the amount (approximately $140 for 3 people + tip). The waiter (young guy, wore black thick-rim glasses with clean, styled brown hair -- sorry we didn't catch your name!!) was very helpful, polite, pleasant to talk to and informative about the dishes. We went mostly off his recommendations and they all hit the nail on the head. I had a little trouble hearing the waiter speak because of the room acoustics (and that we were near the A/C unit because it was preeeetty hot) so I hope he didn't mind repeating himself. He also was NOT overbearing, didn't constantly coming over to see how we were doing or ask if we wanted anything else. He was the right amount of attentive when around and was accessible when we wanted his attention. I understand some businesses teach their waitstaff to be overbearing but...we don't dig that. So that was a big plus.For appetizers we got assiette de charcuterie (assortment of cold cuts) and camembert frit (oven baked camembert with cranberry sauce) and can I please tell you everything was ridiculously good!?! I wasn't expecting crazy great things about it but I was pleasantly surprised. The cold cuts are of decent thickness, the house-made marmalade that came with it was phenomenal and the melted camembert is pretty much my new favorite cheese. I wanted to pour that on all of my food. The bread that came with our appetizers was warm, fresh and had a hint of butter. It went pleasantly with both appetizers. For beer; I had the Kwak (the waiter was nice enough to tell us the story about its interesting glass) - which I liked - and my friend had Delirium Tremens (which was VERY good) and one other beer I can't remember because I didn't like it much (sorry!!).For the main course I had the Le Burger A La Strasbourgeoise with homemade fries. The burger was cooked medium (because I'm lame, sorry avid beef junkies) with what the waiter recommended minus the bacon. I couldn't get through all this food so I had to pack some up and have room for dessert!! My boyfriend had a tartes flambees that was a special; it had white mushrooms, cheese and bacon (I will post pictures!) and I'm pretty sure his friend had the Maraîcher. I had a bite of each and I usually don't like bacon and mushrooms but the flavor is so light but still impacted the taste that I just had to finish the slice haha. After our main course my boyfriend and I had Americanos and our friend had Earl Grey tea. With our drinks we had Mousse au chocolat and Creme brûlée. I liked the mousse better and my boyfriend liked the Creme brûlée better. It's all about taste preference in the end. They were both very good. The top of the Creme brûlée is very interesting though and my first time trying it so I am not sure if this is the best or what. The custard was delicious and light, and the burnt caramel contrasts but complements the custard well. There is literally not one thing I didn't like about the entire meal. Everything was really delicious and I absolutely would come back to this restaurant.",5.0
"Our family decided to try this place for brunch. A friend who lives in Brooklyn frequents here and the Yelp reviews looked pretty good. The food was SO GOOD!!! My daughter doesn't eat very much when we go out but this place was an exception. She had a burger and fries and ate the whole thing. The burger had a pretzel bun and the fries were so big and crispy. A burger with flare. My boyfriend and I had the eggs Benedict and the French toast. They have a selection of various benedicts which I found quite impressive. The French toast was perfect, crispy and chewy with fresh fruits, so good.  We also tried the Bloody Mary which hit the spot, spicy and rich. Also our coffee mugs were never empty, excellent customer service! We will definitely come back next time we are in town. I usually like to try out new restaurants but there were so many other dishes on the menu that looked so good, we'll be back. For sure!",5.0
"The Flambee with goat cheese and bacon was...amazing! The cheese plate was also great. Quality Riesling, fire roaring in the background, and awesome service! It was a bit out of the way for me to get there, but it's a perfect date night spot. There was a dessert that looked like a flambee that looked amazing at the table next to us...next time!",4.0

"I have been here half a dozen times and am always impressed with the food and service. This place is a neighborhood gem and tonight my husband and I dined at the bar and left thinking ""we should come here more often"". The food is delicious, we've ordered several items off the menu and always been completely satisfied with the quality of food and level of service. There is also a great wine list to choose from, albeit small, but beers and cocktails as well. They have a fireplace in the winter which is super cozy and outdoor seating in the warmer months. There is a tv above the bar where you can often catch a game and the whole place is welcoming and cozy year round. The prices here are completely on par with (if not lower) the exceptional quality of food and the service is warm and inviting. Those who felt they were overcharged at this restaurant are simply wrong.Beautiful space, delicious food, warm staff. So glad to have you in the neighborhood, La Cignone. We love you!",5.0
"Just had brunch here! Omg the Nutella and Berry pancakes were out of this world as was the smoked salmon and cream cheese chive omelette. The service could not have been better too. Attentive, (but not over the top), friendly, warm, and gracious. My husband and I are so happy we tried this restaurant. Will certainly be back.",5.0
"Quick Info: Alsatian Cuisine aka French/German FoodThings to Order: Spaetzle/FlambeesWhat's Spaetzle? Egg noodle pasta.What's a Flambee? It's like a flat bread or super thin crust pizza without tomato sauce.Recommendation: Les Champignons Flambees - Mushrooms, crème fraîche, bacon, onions.The food here is good - just not the greatest thing I ever ate. I came here on a Sunday after July 4th for family brunch so there weren't many people in the restaurant. The ambiance is nice and there's also outdoor seating. They serve a couple of Alsatian beers as well as your American craft. My one gripe is that the food took a bit of time to come out - not sure if it was because of the holiday weekend.",3.0

"Stopped in last night 11/20/15 for dinner with a friend. We didn't have reservations but the restaurant had ample seats available ~645pm. Here's how our dinner date went:SERVICE: Excellent! Our waiter John was great! The rest of the staff was just as friendly and made our dinner experience a breeze! WINE: We opted for a bottle of Alsatian Riesling ($39) - DELICIOUS. So good. Definitely try a glass if you like white wine! FOOD: + Special Tarte Flambe: Brie, bacon, mushrooms, onions, creme fraiche. AMAZING. seriously divine. MUST TRY. I wanted to try their tarte flambe champignons but when John  told us about the special tarte flambe, it sounded way too good not to try. My only qualm - MORE SHROOMS! NEED MORE SHROOMS! + Nemrod Spatzle: Really tasty, super filling, good portion. Order as an appetizer to share or entree! Needed more mushrooms, and salt & peppa but very very good. I would order this again. + Poulet Fermier a la Forestiere: chicken was a tad dry, but overall a good dish. Truffle mashed potatoes were FANTASTIC. Needed more mushroom sauce and S&P.+Filet Mignon (special): 6oz filet mignon with some kind of butter thing on top, with asparagus. I didn't try it but my date enjoyed it.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------OVERALL - + food was good, but just needed basic seasoning like salt and pepper. + tons of menu options - i'll be back to try more!+ great serviceMUST TRY!",4.0
"Drinks: Some of the smoothest, most drinkable, delicious cocktails that I've ever had in NYC. Worth it for that alone. Food: Generally good. Salmon entrée is great. Flatbread things are delicious and rich. Spaetzle with grilled chicken needs something to make it less dry. Some of the food can be a little slow to come out. Tried the filet mignon for the first time yesterday. Overall, it's fine. Asked for medium rare, got medium. Guess that's a common mistake for places that don't specialize in steaks. The potato pancake was too thick and too greasy. When it's too thick you get a delicious, crusty outside, and then a less cooked, less appealing inside. Scallops appetizer is great. Order it! Asparagus was in both the scallops and steak dishes which is fine but might be a little too cliche, overused for other people.Service: Generally good to great. I asked to be seated away from kids and they didn't bat an eye. In general, you can tell they care here. We had a waitress I hadn't seen before who did a fine enough job. She almost seemed like a teenager trying to act like a polished art curator or something. It was more amusingly weird and ridiculous than annoying or bad. Walking out, I said ""Thank you"" and got a high-toned, overly proper, totally confusing ""Of course!"" as a reply. Whatever. I'll take that any day to terrible, rude, or apathetic service.   Ambiance: Upscale, neighborhood coziness. One fix to make: the metal chairs need some of kind of rubber or felt caps on the feet. When you pull them out, they make a loud scraping sound that might remind you of cafeteria seating. It's an easy fix. Will go back.",4.0

I chose the traditionelle, which had creme fraiche, onions, and bacon. She chose one with creme fraiche, smoked salmon, and sprinach. Both of them came served on wooden boards.

The servers and staff are so friendly here. My friend and I were just chatting after we finished our meals, and no one said a word to us about it (we did check if anyone was waiting for our table).

"La Cigogne is situated in a fancy and cloying neighborhood of hipster families. And has the non descript decor and abundance of seats they enjoy. My friend and I were sat at bench seats by the Christmas tree and fireplace. We were served a variety of rich Alsatian dishes and loved everything for different reasons. The cheese plate was the best I've had so far. It had a selection of rich, biting cheeses carefully paired to each side with complementary flavors, an interesting block of what i think is quince jam, fresh strawberry preserves and marmalade I ate every bite of and didn't scoff at as I usually do. The coffee was good and served in large bowls with free refills.I wanted a damn onion soup so we shared a damn onion soup and it was full of sopping bread, melted cheese, and overall totally worth it. My friend and I shared a special tarte flambe. Which looks like a 9 or so slice, rectangular flatbread or white pizza. It is large and hearty, enough for two to share. The standout was the taste of the tart, half melted cheeses paired with the meat. Otherwise the texture of the flat bread would have a 'fast casual' TGI Fridays vibe. We also shared the Gambrinus spatzle which had a rich 'meat and potatoes' taste. It is a dish of soft egg noodles with meat and vegetable stew served in a small pan. The spatzle was al dente and less mushy than what I tried in Switzerland and the meat and vegetables were tender. The amount of meat and cheese is something indulgent that seems like a risk for someone of my Russian Jewish ancestry. Or at least it would speed on the ancestral shape post-menopausal Russian women take of a parboiled potato. It was the service that was terrible and intrusive. It made me dock a star. My friend and I came to talk about personal stuff and our waiter (and sometimes one other guy)/seemed to magnetize to our far table every 5 minutes to mumble some sort of question, move a knife slightly to the left, and generally get in the way. Especially when we seemed to talk about the most private things. When we actually needed something, he was nowhere to be found or up socializing with the waiters, out of earshot. I'm pretty sure that the getting and paying the check took 20 minutes. My friend and I felt incredibly violated and annoyed by this and it put a damper on our enjoyment.",4.0

Is that dining al fresco and a French film playing on the TV?That's La Cignone... and yes it's truly modern European at a price you can afford.  Hip, chill, AUTHENTIC.  There is no pretending... The atmosphere alone is worth a visit. For brunch, I had the eggs benedict which was served with home fries and some dressed arugula. The hollandaise sauce was just right, eggs poached to perfection and home fries seasoned and delicious.  I enjoyed a beer and we were treated to a sampler as we hung out at the restaurant to enjoy the French film they were playing. Service was exceptional and you truly felt like you were visiting a friends home and they were preparing their best dish for you.  Meteor beers on tap for all the French beer lovers out there.  Excellent selection of wines as well.I will definitely return...to visit our new friends at La Cignone.",5.0

A decent place for a group because the prices are reasonable and atmosphere is lovely, but food won't blow you away.",3.0
"I came across this place on Yelp review and decide to give it a shot on its diner. Without much expectation, and having dine in various well reviewed restaurant in NYC, I was actually blown away from the random selection me and my friend made. We ordered Foie gras torchon and French Onion Soup (I just have to order one) to start. Both starter were better than average.Salad we had Salade de chèvre chaud, nothing out of ordinary, but it was very fresh and well balanced. The best came at their Spatzles and Tartes Flambees. Gambrinus Spatzles was absolutely well stewed, it can be a heavy dish, but it was nicely balanced with prunes in order to give it a softer touch.

"La Cigogne. Where do I start? Don't be intimidated by the name, I can't pronounce it either but who cares? It's damn good.

"Glad to have this place in the neighborhood!-Service is friendly, and the owner is nice.-Food is fairly priced.-The burger was pretty good, and after having it again... even better. Dare I say great!?Brunch food wasn't the perfect, the portions seemed tiny for brunch... and honestly was kind of bland, but hopefully it was just a bad day and it will improve over time. It's a nice quiet place worth stopping by to check out, I have no real problems or complaints. Edit: Oh, except for the iced coffee. It was mostly water and ice! Please fix that.Overall I've enjoyed my meals here and will definitely back.",5.0
"Did I just step into a French plaza? Is that dining al fresco and a French film playing on the TV?That's La Cignone... and yes it's truly modern European at a price you can afford.  Hip, chill, AUTHENTIC.  There is no pretending... The atmosphere alone is worth a visit. For brunch, I had the eggs benedict which was served with home fries and some dressed arugula. The hollandaise sauce was just right, eggs poached to perfection and home fries seasoned and delicious.  I enjoyed a beer and we were treated to a sampler as we hung out at the restaurant to enjoy the French film they were playing. Service was exceptional and you truly felt like you were visiting a friends home and they were preparing their best dish for you.  Meteor beers on tap for all the French beer lovers out there.  Excellent selection of wines as well.I will definitely return...to visit our new friends at La Cignone.",5.0
This place is great! Your taste buds will be all over the place! I got the Tarte Flambee with the truffle oil and it was excellent. Atmosphere is industrial with a fire place and metal chairs. Bar has a wide variety of liquor.,5.0

"Had a unpleasant experience the first time my boyfriend & I came here but they were probably having an off day which happens everywhere. I really appreciated the fact that both owners of La Cigogne reached out to us regarding our experience so I definitely wanted to give it another shot. The second time around was phenomenal. Jeremy (one of the owners) is great and made sure we had a wonderful experience. Jeremy's drink recommendations for both of us were right on point and the tuna tartare is definitely something worth trying if you stop by. 5 stars for the service, food, ambiance!",5.0
"Really lovely atmosphere and very reasonably priced. Service was friendly, if a bit slow and clunky. The food was hit or miss - the mac n cheese spaetzle for appetizer was delicious, salmon entree was pretty good, and steak was mediocre. And the wines by the glass were very mediocre. A decent place for a group because the prices are reasonable and atmosphere is lovely, but food won't blow you away.",3.0
"I came across this place on Yelp review and decide to give it a shot on its diner. Without much expectation, and having dine in various well reviewed restaurant in NYC, I was actually blown away from the random selection me and my friend made. We ordered Foie gras torchon and French Onion Soup (I just have to order one) to start. Both starter were better than average.Salad we had Salade de chèvre chaud, nothing out of ordinary, but it was very fresh and well balanced. The best came at their Spatzles and Tartes Flambees. Gambrinus Spatzles was absolutely well stewed, it can be a heavy dish, but it was nicely balanced with prunes in order to give it a softer touch.

"I am not sure how this place gets an average of 4.5 stars. I do not think it would, in Manhattan.Don't get me wrong, I love Brooklyn and I made a long trip to this spot to try out this restaurant. We ordered the burger and salmon, and maybe that was where we went wrong, as this place seems to specialize in tartes flambées and spatzle - we just found we were not quite in the mood for the latter two options (and judging by our neighbors' plates they looked only okay). The burger and salmon were both good portions and well executed medium as requested, which we were very happy about. However they were noticeably under-salted and not very flavorful. The salmon was also overly charred on the bottom.Maybe the rating is a bit inflated because it happens to be a good and relatively affordable restaurant with a welcoming and cozy interior - love the fireplace and option to dine al fresco - in the neighborhood. For sure if I lived nearby I would consider it a good option. But as I do not live in the area, I feel no desire to return. I will, however, visit the Alsace region in France next month and will report back if any of my sentiments change after sampling the food there.",3.0

My husband had the soup of the day, eggplant soup and it was also fantastic. I had the Salade de l'ambassadeur and it was very flavorful. The steak was prepared exactly as I asked.

My wife had the steak frite. It was good, but not great. A good cut of meat well prepared, but nothing to knock your socks off. Hamburgers were good, too. Enjoyed by children and adults.

I honestly don't think I'll ever go to another restaurant if I want Alsatian food.The simple yet well curated wine list covers all the French wine regions so your thirst for an earthy blend from the Northern Rhone will be satisfied as well as your friend's yearning for an elegant Pinot Noir or your date's wish for a vibrant Sauvignon Blanc.You can even find a Pinot Noir from Corsica!

"Walked into La Cigogne on a Monday evening, located on the beautiful block of intersecting Union St and Henry St. in Carroll Gardens. I was warmly welcomed by Jeremy (one of the owners) who then walked me to the bar, he asked what type of libation I was interested in, I told him I enjoy pale ales with a bit above the average alcohol content. He recommended ""Wendelinus"" on draft, it was delicious. The bartender was also very sweet and attentive, I told Jeremy I checked the reviews on Yelp and was impressed with the 5 Star rating, he immediately said ""in my culture, people shouldn't be treated less than 5 stars, service should always be the best."" I couldn't agree with him more. I wasn't very hungry but it was my first time at an Alsatian restaurant so I decided to try some appetizers. I ordered the Scallops and the Camembert frit. I'm always hesitant to order Scallops in fear of disappointment but these were perfectly browed in Caper sauce, I love Capers, and the Camembert (oven baked) was delicious too. Music is important to me, at all times, exceptionally when a drink is keeping me company, they played a mix of lounge and sensual tunes that completed the vibe, so good I forgot I was a party of one. I returned the very following Friday night. This time I came with a close friend, we sat at the bar again. I had Kwak, one of the best Belgian beers I've ever had. To start, we ordered Moules marinières (Mussels), they arrived covered in two bowls, when my friend opened the bowl, he immediately said ""there is a God!"" referring to the generous portion.  For dinner we ordered the Gambrinus (meteor beer marinated beef stew in egg noodles) and Steak Frites to share, everything was exquisite. In conclusion, as other Yelper's mentioned, there are many reasons to dine at La Cigogne, whether you want to just enjoy a good drink by yourself, bring a date (a special one), enjoy a good time with your entire family or group of friends, this restaurant and the level of hospitality from the staff and owners cater to all of the above. Two thumbs up La Cigogne, these 5 stars are very well deserved!",5.0

"We stopped by here last night.  My fiancé is French from the Alsace region and wanted to try the food.  We also brought our 10 month old son.  Yea, we couldn't get a baby sitter, but they turned out to be very family friendly so it worked out.  When we arrived there was another table with kids, and they seemed to be enjoying what they were eating.The décor was pretty cool with Alsatien/French touches.  And they have outdoor seating.   I loved the look of the fireplace in the middle of the restaurant I can't wait to come back in the winter and see it when it's lit.  They have a small bar, and one big TV which was playing the World Cup games but at a decent volume which didn't disturb the people eating. Even the bathroom was nicely done.  They even had a changing table in the bathroom, which is a big plus for moms like me.  I loved their little outdoor deck and we sat there because it was a beautiful night.  Overall it's a casually beautiful and relaxed space.The owners were there and attending to all their guests.  And I throughout the night I kept watching them interact with the neighborhood residents/regulars in a genuine way which is really nice to see.  I ordered a meat/cheese plate.  My fiancé order the scallops, the beef Spatzle and the bacon Flambee.  My fiancé being the Frenchie he is loved everything he ordered.   He also  gave some of his Spatzle to our baby and he also devoured it, so I guess it must have been good.  In fact every time he would start to fuss, I would just give him something to eat from our plates and he would happily stuff his face.  If you can keep a 10 month old baby happy with food, you must be doing something right.  They also gave my son a pair of cute sunglasses which helped. :)  (pic attached)I'm the picky one in the group and I literally vacuumed up my meat/cheese plate.  I actually asked for bread 3 times, which is a compliment to them...because normally I just pick at my plate and only eat one or 2 of the cheese selections, but this time I liked all 4 and I mopped up that homemade cranberry jam like it was expensive caviar.  I stuffed my face to the point I didn't leave room for an entrée which is okay, since we will definitely be back and very soon.

"How come I didn't write a review on this lovely restaurant that I've eaten almost 20 times?Firstly intrigued by the proximity (on the same block with my home) and satisfied by their food (unpretentious French food with flavor consistently great) and remain royal due to their genuinely caring service.We normally visit as a whole family in the early dinner at times when many families dine comfortably but I noticed that after certain hour, the restaurant changes into romantic mood, good for couples. So I think La Cigogne is doing a great job in catering to all kinds of clientele.All the food that I've tried was delicious, among them my favorite goes to La Traditionalle, their signature tart flambee and Nemrod & Maraicher ( Hand cut egg noodles). French onion soup always delights me as well.These days I cook almost everyday so couldn't find time to go back, but hope to find some excuse to visit La Cigogne sooner!!",5.0
Mediocre at best. The steak was one of the worst cuts of meat I have had at a New York restaurant - diner quality. The scallops were passable but sloppily presented on unripened asparagus sopping in a lake of melted butter. The caesar salad dressing tasted off. The bread was one of the lowest quality breads I have experienced at a NYC restaurant in years. The only thing I have no complaints about is the butter - that was good. But definitely not a four and a half star restaurant. Maybe for brunch but not for a week night dinner.,2.0
Fantastic by all means. Real authentic French cuisine with great caring service. Great value for money also. Mind blowing steak and steak tartar,5.0
"I may have lucked out, but I doubt it.  Followed yelp ratings to this place and they did not fail me.  This place is authentic and delicious.  I had the lobster and bay oyster spaetzel special and it was fantastic.   Beer and wine selection was unique and covered all tastes.  Coupled with attentive but not overbearing wait staff, I would certainly come here again.  The 3500mile commute may make that difficult.",5.0
"My husband and I were excited to try out La Cigogne. We are always looking for good neighborhood restaurants with outdoor space and La Cigogne looked so charming that when our first dinner choice was booked we jumped at the chance to try La Cigogne. We've only had a few disappointing meals since moving to Brooklyn a number of years ago and sadly this made the list! I ordered the goat cheese tarte and my husband got a hamburger. I was hoping for a savory delight with maybe a buttery crust but what I got was an underwhelming flatbread with sparse toppings. My husband's burger was okay, but in a city and neighborhood with delicious food it didn't impress. I would recommend La Cigogne if maybe you wanted sit at a bar and watch a game, but its not somewhere I would eat again. If you're in Cobble Hill, and want a good meal and good beer or wine I'd check out Libertador or the nearby Bar Bruno. Both have great atmosphere, good drinks and really good food!",3.0
"Happened to chance upon this gem of place as my bf and I were coming from the 74th precinct and was pleasantly surprised. Delicious drinks, morning high was my fave~ we also had the most amazing tarte flambe. Really cool and laidback owners.",5.0
I came here by accident as there was a parking space directly in front.  The french onion soup may be the best I've ever had.  The caesar salad was delicious topped with ample anchovies.  I enjoyed it so much that I went back last Sunday with a group of friends for a birthday celebration.  We tried a few appetizers and entrees and everyone was pleased with our newly discovered restaurant and it's attractive and warm ambiance.,4.0
"Great French food!Both myself and my dining buddy had the egg noodles. Mine came in a white cream sauce with lobster meat and scallops, truly amazing. My friend's noodles also came in a white cream sauce but her's had bacon and something else I cannot remember. We both left nothing in our bowls. I would definitely come back to maybe try another noodle dish or one of the tarte's which to me looked like flatbread pizza's.",5.0
"I came to this neighborhood to go to lucali and ended up here to have drinks while I waited - the place is so beautiful - with a real woodburning fireplace - I love fireplaces . The bar is beautiful , the wine is good and reasonably priced . The service was impeccable and I learned something about Alsace- a part of the world I have never heard of - it made for a beautiful evening with in a beautiful place .",5.0
"Where here for the b'day dinner of my mum. Came super late, but they kept the reservation and served us very well. The food was extraordinary. Though I recommend it to people who understand the Alsatian kitchen - nothing for kale smoothie hipsters (joke)...",5.0
"How come I didn't write a review on this lovely restaurant that I've eaten almost 20 times?Firstly intrigued by the proximity (on the same block with my home) and satisfied by their food (unpretentious French food with flavor consistently great) and remain royal due to their genuinely caring service.We normally visit as a whole family in the early dinner at times when many families dine comfortably but I noticed that after certain hour, the restaurant changes into romantic mood, good for couples. So I think La Cigogne is doing a great job in catering to all kinds of clientele.All the food that I've tried was delicious, among them my favorite goes to La Traditionalle, their signature tart flambee and Nemrod & Maraicher ( Hand cut egg noodles). French onion soup always delights me as well.These days I cook almost everyday so couldn't find time to go back, but hope to find some excuse to visit La Cigogne sooner!!",5.0
Mediocre at best. The steak was one of the worst cuts of meat I have had at a New York restaurant - diner quality. The scallops were passable but sloppily presented on unripened asparagus sopping in a lake of melted butter. The caesar salad dressing tasted off. The bread was one of the lowest quality breads I have experienced at a NYC restaurant in years. The only thing I have no complaints about is the butter - that was good. But definitely not a four and a half star restaurant. Maybe for brunch but not for a week night dinner.,2.0
Fantastic by all means. Real authentic French cuisine with great caring service. Great value for money also. Mind blowing steak and steak tartar,5.0
"I may have lucked out, but I doubt it.  Followed yelp ratings to this place and they did not fail me.  This place is authentic and delicious.  I had the lobster and bay oyster spaetzel special and it was fantastic.   Beer and wine selection was unique and covered all tastes.  Coupled with attentive but not overbearing wait staff, I would certainly come here again.  The 3500mile commute may make that difficult.",5.0
"My husband and I were excited to try out La Cigogne. We are always looking for good neighborhood restaurants with outdoor space and La Cigogne looked so charming that when our first dinner choice was booked we jumped at the chance to try La Cigogne. We've only had a few disappointing meals since moving to Brooklyn a number of years ago and sadly this made the list! I ordered the goat cheese tarte and my husband got a hamburger. I was hoping for a savory delight with maybe a buttery crust but what I got was an underwhelming flatbread with sparse toppings. My husband's burger was okay, but in a city and neighborhood with delicious food it didn't impress. I would recommend La Cigogne if maybe you wanted sit at a bar and watch a game, but its not somewhere I would eat again. If you're in Cobble Hill, and want a good meal and good beer or wine I'd check out Libertador or the nearby Bar Bruno. Both have great atmosphere, good drinks and really good food!",3.0

You know this place is legit when the people who work there all speak french. This place is definitely a top brunch spot and makes me want to come for dinner.

I wanted to update my review to 5 stars before giving their restaurant another shot solely on the way they presented themselves which was as people who care and it's evident in their food and service. everyone has a bad day but based on my second experience and the many excellent reviews I say those days are a rarity.

We got spaetzle, tarte flambee, mulles marniere (inedible-we sent that one back) It was all bland and uninspired, cooked with neither care nor heart. We left most of it. The flippant, inattentive service didn't help matters. If you just want to practice your French and drink, it's OK. But stay away from anything that comes out of the kitchen.

"Cute French place in Carroll Gardens. Menu is kind of limited, but we all ordered burgers on a brioche bun. Mine had brie and bacon and came with fries-delicious!

My friend ordered the mac & cheese. We also had beers (they were quite good).  However, the food was terribly blend. The mac & cheese didn't taste like much and my tarte was far from ""good"". It didn't taste like anything at all. It looked like it had been thrown together in 5 minutes. I didn't even finish it (a first for me).  We were both very disappointed. On top of that, an extra large TV was on and showing a a soap opera.  Annoying and distracting. The prices are also quite high. $9 for a small bowl of mac & cheese!.... and the tartes start at $12.  Way too much when the food comes out so blend. Will not return.",1.0

"New Alsatian French restaurant that's opened in a long-empty storefront on Union and Henry. Wine choice is good and well priced; service is friendly and informal; on warm nights, the storefront windows open completely yet, unlike the awful Buschenschank with a similar open storefront on Court Street, background music is quiet.Lots of great choices on the menu.  The Alsatian tartes flambé that they feature is basically a small pizza with crème fresh and light toppings.  We've ordered tartes flambé with salmon, another with muenster cheese and bacon, and a third with mushroom - all very good.  The burger is juicy and served on a soft pretzel bun - try it with gruyere cheese and dijon mustard - and their french fries are the best in the neighborhood, relatively thick and deeply friend and crunchy.  The steak frites is also delicious - one of the better steaks at this price in the neighborhood.Perhaps the only misfire here is a minor one: the table bread plate offers a few paltry baguette slices - basically a single thin slice of french bread per person - and pre-packaged cafeteria-style butter.  Even if they continue to provide only a few slices of bread for the table, surely butter can be offered in a pot instead of plastic packaging.For dessert, the apple crumble is served warm and optionally (and recommended) a la mode. Family recipe, according to one of the owners, and delicious.Glad to have these guys in the neighborhood.",4.0

"An outstanding and disarming little hole in the wall in the Carroll Gardens neighborhood of Brownstone Brooklyn, on the corner of Henry and Union, which is a surprising little nexus of eating establishments, by the way, removed from the boulevard of midling eats on Court St.We happened upon it while strolling around, feeling spontaneous.  The site of a blazing fireplace at the back of the restaurant, visible from the street via the opened terrace doors, was a magnet to us.   The place was bustling and friendly to the eye.  Intrigued, we examined the menu that was posted at the entrance.  An Alsatian restaurant?  How novel!  That would be cuisine from the French side of the Rhine, with Germanic and Swiss influences as well as French, of course.Normally I am a little put off by French cuisine - atmosphere frequently too snooty, too much sauce on everything, not a wine aficionado, etc...  But the owner, Jeremy, was humble and gracious, delighted to see us and enthusiastic about describing his restaurant's offerings.  The rest of the staff was also friendly and attentive yet casual, never overbearing.  And the offerings were simple and earthy, with a great beer and wine menu to accompany.For libations, Kim enjoyed a glass of Brut while I partook of a glass of  Meteor Wendelinus Pale Ale, which was crisp and very slightly sweet.   Super refreshing.  I loved that it came in its own, branded beer glass, which was more of a goblet. Beer should always be served in goblets!  Later during the meal, I followed that with a stronger ale, a Delirium Tremens, delivered, again, in a uniquely branded glass, this time more of a snifter, and accompanied by the remainder of my beer portion still in the very pretty bottle.   All great all fun.Even the bread and butter were outstanding!  Rich creamy, lightly salted butter on chewy baguette slices.  Perfect.For dinner, Kim had the beef stew with spaetzle, which was tasty, almost home cooked in its melange of warm flavors and simplicity, but I found it a bit dry.  It needed a splash of beef broth, I thought.  That's probably not spaetzle anymore, I'm sure someone will say, but there it is.  It was very well prepared, just not my cup of stew, if you will.I had one of their signature tartes flambes, which are basically similar to thin crust square pizzas, sans red sauce, with creme fraiche and simple toppings, like munster cheese, onions, and of course, in my case, bacon!  Completely delicious!  Kim ate half of mine!    I also liked that it was served on a cutout of French newspaper placed over a cutting board.  A nice touch without seeming artificial.It's just a fun, friendly, unpretentious place with an authentic European feel to it, that serves great food and drink in a warm and inviting room.  We thoroughly enjoyed the meal, the service, the congenial room and left feeling completely satisfied and relaxed.  I am sure to visit this lovely establishment again.",5.0
"Are You Sick of Bad Pizza Yet?Introducing a New Restaurant - the Only One Serving this Cuisine in BrooklynDon't Wait - It Won't Remain Secret for LongDear Reader:Let's face it, the restaurants in Carroll Gardens have become a bit...hmm, how should I put this... stale? It seems like there is one, big, central kitchen making food for all the restaurants, and the only way to tell them apart is from the signs out front. Sure, we could make the walk over to the bedbug-infested subway, crowd in with everybody and head into Manhattan, searching -- possibly in vain -- for a pleasant, inexpensive, and hassle-free meal. Of course, if we do find this magical place, once we finish eating, we will have to turn around and make the late-night return trip home...If the trains are running!I'd like to suggest an option that may seem like more of a vacation than a nuissance.Have you heard of La Cigogne, the new Alsatian restaurant -- the only restaurant of its kind in Brooklyn -- that just opened... In our neighborhood!I'm telling you, my girlfriend and I were strolling by La Cigogne last week and the atmosphere inside was calling to us...and we had just eaten.In fact, when we walked by on a Sunday during this year's World Cup, the restaurant was full and they had not even been awarded their liquor license yet. Can you believe it? When is the last time that you saw soccer fans watching a match without alcohol? Alot of the exitement about La Cigogne has to do with the owners, Jeremy and Damien. They've brought everything that they love from Alsace and combined it with everything that they love about America. They treat you like you are a close friend and not -- like some restaurants in our neighborhood that will go unnamed -- like they are doing you a favor.And while La Cigogne's atmosphere transports you from the hustle and bustle of New York to the laid back, seize-the-day vibe of the French-Swiss-German border, it is the food that makes you want to come back again and again. Gone are the generic pastas, salads, and cookie-cutter pizzas. La Gigogne offers a unique blend of Alsatian fair. What does that mean? Well, it means that you are getting the best blend of three distinct, yet complementary, culinary traditions that makes Alsatian cuisine renowned all over the world.Nestled on France's eastern border with Switzerald and Germany, Alsace is famous for being one of the most highly concentrated Michelin Star regions in the world.This means that you can get a Mac n' Cheese appetizer made with rich, smooth, melted, delicious cheese -- not made with ingredients that sound like they are straight from a laboratory. You can get a burger that reminds you that hamburgers can be delicacies, not limp, soggy-breaded, overcooked cast-offs.Looking to venture deep into Alsatian territory? La Cigogne's spätzles will make you wonder why you have waited this long for food this good. My personal favorite is the Steak Frite entree, which is so authentic that it should come with a beret -- although, I'm sure that you could get it with a baguette if you asked nicely.To complete the illusion of vacation bliss, you can enjoy a wide array of Alsatian wines and beers...beers that you'd be hard-pressed to find anywhere else in the city...beers so tasty that you'll wonder why they've been hidden from you for all this time.Listen, typing this review has made my mouth begin to salivate. So, head on out to La Cigogne. You'll thank me later. À votre sante!-Kris",5.0

Not too sweet and just slightly crunchy. The Nutella on the side is an added bonus. I would definitely go back, especially with a group or my parents since it's quiet and never crowded.",4.0

Sure, we could make the walk over to the bedbug-infested subway, crowd in with everybody and head into Manhattan, searching -- possibly in vain -- for a pleasant, inexpensive, and hassle-free meal. Of course, if we do find this magical place, once we finish eating, we will have to turn around and make the late-night return trip home...If the trains are running!I'd like to suggest an option that may seem like more of a vacation than a nuissance.Have you heard of La Cigogne, the new Alsatian restaurant -- the only restaurant of its kind in Brooklyn -- that just opened... In our neighborhood!I'm telling you, my girlfriend and I were strolling by La Cigogne last week and the atmosphere inside was calling to us...and we had just eaten.In fact, when we walked by on a Sunday during this year's World Cup, the restaurant was full and they had not even been awarded their liquor license yet. Can you believe it? When is the last time that you saw soccer fans watching a match without alcohol? Alot of the exitement about La Cigogne has to do with the owners, Jeremy and Damien. They've brought everything that they love from Alsace and combined it with everything that they love about America. They treat you like you are a close friend and not -- like some restaurants in our neighborhood that will go unnamed -- like they are doing you a favor.And while La Cigogne's atmosphere transports you from the hustle and bustle of New York to the laid back, seize-the-day vibe of the French-Swiss-German border, it is the food that makes you want to come back again and again. Gone are the generic pastas, salads, and cookie-cutter pizzas. La Gigogne offers a unique blend of Alsatian fair. What does that mean? Well, it means that you are getting the best blend of three distinct, yet complementary, culinary traditions that makes Alsatian cuisine renowned all over the world.Nestled on France's eastern border with Switzerald and Germany, Alsace is famous for being one of the most highly concentrated Michelin Star regions in the world.This means that you can get a Mac n' Cheese appetizer made with rich, smooth, melted, delicious cheese -- not made with ingredients that sound like they are straight from a laboratory. You can get a burger that reminds you that hamburgers can be delicacies, not limp, soggy-breaded, overcooked cast-offs.Looking to venture deep into Alsatian territory? La Cigogne's spätzles will make you wonder why you have waited this long for food this good. My personal favorite is the Steak Frite entree, which is so authentic that it should come with a beret -- although, I'm sure that you could get it with a baguette if you asked nicely.To complete the illusion of vacation bliss, you can enjoy a wide array of Alsatian wines and beers...beers that you'd be hard-pressed to find anywhere else in the city...beers so tasty that you'll wonder why they've been hidden from you for all this time.Listen, typing this review has made my mouth begin to salivate. So, head on out to La Cigogne. You'll thank me later. À votre sante!-Kris",5.0
"Was curious about this place, been there twice and i enjoyed it,  Jeremy is really cool,The flammekueche was good , great merlot and nice choices of beers, but ""Cesar"" salad is way too expensive for what it is :/ in my opinion ;)",4.0
"This place is clown shows delicious. The beer list is quality and the food is even better. Tarte flambee was out of control. Put it in my mouth. Right. Now. They've got some sick French beer on tap as well. Definitely worth a taste. They just opened, so support them!",5.0
"I've been here for brunch twice, both times at around 10am on a Sunday. There has never been a wait of any kind, which I very much appreciate in this neighborhood. The servers are friendly and attentive and the coffee is delicious. I ordered the pancakes both times because I love pancakes stuffed with bananas and berries. I think they're perfectly delicious. Not too sweet and just slightly crunchy. The Nutella on the side is an added bonus. I would definitely go back, especially with a group or my parents since it's quiet and never crowded.",4.0
"After a year of watching the renovations taking place and wondering what was going to finally be there, I am so happy to have La Cigogne open and in my neighborhood.The first time visiting, they got me hooked with their fantastic pan-seared scallops appetizer. Just this past Sunday, I was shocked to experience one of the best bloody marys I've had in a long time - and trust me, I am no stranger to a bloody mary (in fact I am drinking one at home right now). The only downside was the lack of olives or pickle for a garnish...but that was forgiven and forgotten rather quickly thanks to the deliciousness in my glasses which were emptied rather quickly.While I am definitely more of a hard liquor kind of gal, I've branched out with their wine selection. Actually, now that I think about it, I've tried and loved a lot of new things here. The same Bloody Mary Sunday I just wrote about, my friend and I tried one of their tartes flambees with cherry tomatoes, black olives and arugula. It was a great combination of fresh, warm, tasty and filling without making you feel like you're going to need to be rolled out of the place.Later, we were treated to the day's special dessert, a s'mores flambee. Don't think any less of me but I'm really not a dessert person. I prefer to get my calories in the form of salty carbs or alcohol. This though...not only was it not overly sweet, the roasted marshmallow brought me back to my childhood. It was great and will go really well with their fireplace this winter.Everyone who works there is not only attentive, but also very sweet and it's not only been nice to get to know them, but it's also been great to watch them interact with other customers every time I've been there.",5.0
"I feel very fortunate to have found this unique French restaurant. We started frequenting this place two months ago and have gone back several times since for brunch or dinner.  Have tried something different each time and haven't been disappointed.  Can't go wrong with anything on the menu, but the burger on its pretzel bun and the tarte flambées are spectacular. Excellent selection of beer and wine as well, and the atmosphere is warm and casual. Also, the service is attentive without being intrusive and they love kids! Highly recommended! La Cigogne really is a welcome mix of old-school service and amazing food and atmosphere.",4.0
"Great time. Nice outdoor seating and great service. I recommend the Morning High whiskey mixed cocktail. We had the Chèvre chaud , side of wild mushrooms, mixed greens and an order of the Steak tartare  all which was amazing. I highly recommend everyone to give this great gem a try.",5.0
"Great atmosphere and our starter of Spatzel Mac & Cheese was awesome, but service was slow and inattentive and our entrees of steak frites & the chicken were a bit disappointing.",3.0
"I came the opening night and was like uh ok. So I had been lame and not come back. Popped in tonight for an impromptu bite and think I ate the most delicious thing ever. The Brie, mushroom bacon cheesy flatbread tarte was rich good deliciousness. Had a bite of my besties burger and almost cried. Go there fast. It's amazing. (Get the Rose.. The bartender has great recommends!!)",5.0
Delicious and modern French restaurant! the owners are so devoted and the staff is great! would definitely come again.,5.0
"I don't give five stars very often. But this new restaurant, La Cigogne, celebrating authentic Alsace cuisine, certainly deserves it. Five stars mean that the ambience, the menu, the service, and the food were all excellent. This restaurant was an accidental find. I didn't read any of the below reviews before I went, but I can attest to the fact that they are all correct. The ambience is quaint. It feels like an old cafe from France. The menu and the wait staff are authentic... Imagine French staff (we will not argue over the legitimacy of calling Alsace French) actually working in a French restaurant. The service was solicitous without being overbearing. And if for nothing else, they get an extra star for knowing that no one wants to be seated next to a spoiled misbehaving child with inept parents who can't control her and moving them to the back of the restaurant without incident. Bravo! And yet they are still family friendly. There were many (well behaved) children outside (sidewalk seating) and inside who seemed to enjoy the food and the ambience. Food, even simple choices like ceasars salad and macaroni and cheese, were well crafted and delicious. I will definitely be back and I encourage you to try it. It was early evening on a Friday so was reasonable busy but not crazy, a great time to visit a great find!",5.0
"WARNING! HIGHLY ADDICTIVE!My husband and I recently moved to Cobble Hill and we've loved exploring the neighborhood's many great restaurants. However, one in particular has won our hearts (and stomachs) in a ginormous way. Yep. La Cigogne. We kinda, maybe cut out of work early on a Friday and have been craving a great, cozy French spot and thanks to Yelp we found it. We sat at the bar and co-owners Jeremy and Damien couldn't have been nicer. Their passion for the space, food, and drinks is utterly infectious and when they tell you something is gonna rock your worlds, TRUST THEM. We were having a terrible time deciding what to get (the pistachio crusted salmon like the guy at the next table? The truffled lobster mac?)  Thank god Jeremy came to the rescue and suggested the off menu but highly, highly cravable Tarte Flambee with camembert, mushrooms, crisp bacon and creme fraiche. Can I get a hell yeah?? Of course this was after the gorgeous (and honestly very filling) charcuterie plate that came with an insanely amazing spicy honey. After another cocktail (for dessert) and more great conversation with Damien and Jeremy (getting recommendations for our upcoming trip to Montreal) we're instant and loyal fans of La Cigogne. Long story short: run, don't walk.",5.0
The Best Burger and fries in Carroll Gardens!!!!The Beef Burger was cooked perfectly and was topped with melted Camembert Cheese and crispy Bacon.The home cut fries were crispy on the outside and cooked just right on the inside and tossed in rock salt.The Outside seating makes it a great place to enjoy lunch during the week.,5.0

"I would give La Cigogne a 3.5, but my family insists I give it 4 stars.  Although we were seated well before other tables, we received our food much later than others.  And, it wasn't because we had ordered something complicated.  In fact, we had almost the same order as another table, but they still received their food well before we did.  When I questioned the manager? he brushed off my questions and said our food would arrive shortly.  Our food did arrive soon thereafter, but our server should have communicated with us a bit more and the manager should have been a bit more apologetic and less brusque.  As for the food, the La Mer and La Fromagere, were quite good as were the various beers and cocktails we consumed.  That said, my steak frites, which I ordered medium rare, came medium well.  The frites were not bad but not memorable by any means.  I had specified that I wanted my steak to be cooked medium rare as I find consuming overcooked meat to be a waste of eating.  Nevertheless, the steak was still overcooked.  Our server, who was quite sweet, apologized.  But, that still didn't change the fact that my steak was overcooked.  We concluded our meal with a creme brûlée, which was excellent.  Overall, pretty good, but not amazing.  However, worth going back to on days when we don't feel like leaving the 'hood.",4.0
We only came for drinks so far but the staff is SUPER friendly and so welcoming! We are looking forward to coming back to eat! But the beer is delicious and I'm a beer fan. The wendelinus is a great beer I highly recommend it for any type of beer drinker. They have freak cocktails as well.,5.0
"I'm bummed because I REALLY wanted to like this place. I love the ambiance, and I love Alsatian food. I ordered the grilled salmon, which according to the menu was a pistachio encrusted salmon with a honey mustard sauce over spinach. When it arrived, it didn't seem pistachio encrusted, and the little bit of sauce there was had no flavor. On top of that, the salmon was burnt on the bottom, which overwhelmed any of the other flavors, and it was overcooked. I guess I should have said something, and maybe I would have if anyone had asked, but I just chalked it up to a bad choice on my part.On top of that, I was very sick to my stomach later, which I didn't automatically attribute to the salmon. I had leftovers the next day (I don't like to waste food), and a few hours later became very ill once again.Maybe I just ordered the wrong dish on the wrong night, but with so many great restaurants in Carroll Gardens, I don't think I'll be giving La Cigogne a second shot.",1.0
One of the best steaks EVER! We had been to the location years ago when it was a typical Brooklyn Italian joint. Great owners who'd plonk a bottle of sambuca on the table with your after lunch coffee and let you get on with it. This new incarnation is equally welcoming. The fare is Alsacienne bistro. Wife had best burger ever. Wines were few but well chosen. Wish I were young enough to add desert to the experience.,4.0

"My gf and I passed by one night and I happened to notice the fireplace seating area. Seemed like a nice place to be at night and will be great in the winter too. We wound up going the next day or so for brunch and we're glad we did. The bloody marys were great and so were our meals. We had french toast made from a country bread and a croque madame that was a good two inches thick with plenty of ham and eggs. The granola and yogurt was good, albeit maybe bit too much variety of fruit. I liked the sake cocktail with fresh berries, though that may have a little too strong for brunch or breakfast. One co-owner was there and really friendly and knowledgeable. That was a plus. The place itself is really open given what the typical restaurant is like in that area, felt more like a house, but that was a nice change of pace for sure.Overall, the food was really good, the bloody mary tasted great and was a relaxing place to be. Glad we tried it.",5.0
"A wonderful, welcome addition to the numerous restaurants in Carroll Gardens. Simple, delicious French food without pomp or circumstance. The bar is perfect for a solo glass of wine or an evening with a friend/date, and the patio/restaurant is ideal for friends and family, particularly when you're sharing one of the delicious flambés or a cheese plate, which you most certainly should! Set back from the hectic-ness of Smith Street, it's worth the extra five-minute walk. Haven't tried brunch, but I hear it's wonderful, and owners Damien and Jeremy couldn't be nicer or more hospitable. It's definitely my new-neighborhood go-to!",5.0

"La Cigogne is an unbelievably amazing restaurant and a much valued change of pace addition to a neighborhood in which every other restaurant is Italian (that may have something to do with the fact that Carroll Gardens is a predominately Italian-American neighborhood.

The burger here will make you want to burn every McDonald's franchise to the ground for calling what they serve there ""hamburgers."" It's thick, juicy and if you get it with cheese, the cheese comes melted on there like a thick, warm blanket of deliciousness.

They bring out books for my kid and endless supplies of napkins for when said kid spill endless amount of milk all over their floors -- to which they never get even remotely annoyed.

Great French food in Brooklyn! Had the beef stew with spaetzle which was excellent. Desserts are unreal,5.0
"This is a super cute place with outdoor seating and a fire place.  It was october and we were still able to sit on the connected outdoor deck comfortably.   Our server was amazing and totally attentive.  Helping me to decide between different beers, he generously offered me a tasting of each. We split the spatzle mac and cheese, a salad and the famous must get ""Flammeküeche"" that everyone in the yelp reviews would not stop talking about. We decided to get the Chèvre chaud Flammeküeche and it was heavenly. The warm goat cheese, honey, crème fraîche, bacon was amazing!! talk about comfort food, I was totally in love with the spaetzle mac and cheese!!! I want to come back just to eat more of that.  All the other yelp reviews also raved about the Gambrinus spatzle but we ran out of room to get it.  Instead we saved room for dessert and the Tarte flambée aka apple crumble was totally worth it...esp a la mode!  I cannot wait to come back to all the other spatzle dishes.  What a great Alsatian spot complemented with authentic beers of the region!",4.0

Quand même, given that the food is inexpensive, and the staff are nice, and that they have a nice fireplace, I would still go back there for a quick bite.",4.0
"A very cozy and cute spot. I enjoyed my croque madame, the bread was fluffy and toasty - definitely al dente.. if that context makes sense. In addition, staff was great! I really enjoyed myself here, thinking of trying it out for dinner.",4.0
"My wife and I ate here a couple weeks ago and everything was terribly bland.  Stale white bread to start the meal?  No thanks, I'll pass.  Hey guys, there's a bakery across the street!  The spaetzle just tasted like cream and nothing else.  The people were really nice and that's the only reason I'm giving two stars.  I know it's a new spot, so there are kinks to work out.  Maybe will come back after a long while to see if it's better.",2.0
Great French food in Brooklyn! Had the beef stew with spaetzle which was excellent. Desserts are unreal,5.0
"This is a super cute place with outdoor seating and a fire place.  It was october and we were still able to sit on the connected outdoor deck comfortably.   Our server was amazing and totally attentive.  Helping me to decide between different beers, he generously offered me a tasting of each. We split the spatzle mac and cheese, a salad and the famous must get ""Flammeküeche"" that everyone in the yelp reviews would not stop talking about. We decided to get the Chèvre chaud Flammeküeche and it was heavenly. The warm goat cheese, honey, crème fraîche, bacon was amazing!! talk about comfort food, I was totally in love with the spaetzle mac and cheese!!! I want to come back just to eat more of that.  All the other yelp reviews also raved about the Gambrinus spatzle but we ran out of room to get it.  Instead we saved room for dessert and the Tarte flambée aka apple crumble was totally worth it...esp a la mode!  I cannot wait to come back to all the other spatzle dishes.  What a great Alsatian spot complemented with authentic beers of the region!",4.0

"This is a very, very special place. My wife and I came here the day after they opened --  incidentally -- and Jeremy and Damien were so welcoming.  I've eaten here for dinner several times since they opened and have stopped in for a few afternoon beers. Every time we are welcomed back as friends. The atmosphere is romantic at night, and fun during the day. When you go, I highly recommend the la Chèvre (Tarte Flambee). They also offer cocktails that are made with Sake that I thought were going to be weird (not a sake fan) but they were really good. My favorite part of the restaurant is the owners, but the atmosphere and the food really live up to expectations as well. It's become a go-to spot for our family and our friends too!",5.0
"Not sure if this is a new restaurant but i got the impression it is.  Very nice decor.  I take it that its new because considering the neighborhood, had NP with getting a table bc it wasnt even half full and i attribute that to its still being a baby...bc it definitely wasnt a reflection of the quality of the food.  Rarely do i eat french food and its not a cuisine im familiar with, but what we got was delicious.  The service was above and beyond, attentive but not annoying. A gentleman who seemed like the owner was available and open to questions-  i didnt feel like an idiot asking questions about food i needed guidance with. Oh and the dessert was divine, as was the cafe au lait.  Cafe au lait sounds so simple, right, but they made something special out of it. Ill return!  The only reason im not rating it a five is because i feel like i didnt try enough - i kind of played it safe by ordering brussel sprouts, mac n cheese, and salmon. Next time ill venture more into the real french food.",4.0
"My husband and I live around the corner from La Cigogne and as soon as we saw the sign going up we crossed our fingers and hoped for a great new restaurant -- and that's exactly what we got!  It has quickly become our favorite restaurant in the neighborhood and we've already been back many times for both brunch and dinner.  The decor and open air seating make for a great vibe, the service is always excellent, the owners are extremely welcoming and friendly and obviously take great pride in what they've created and, most importantly, the food is consistently fantastic.  I rarely take the time to write Yelp reviews but La Cigogne is well worth the time.",5.0
"Went to Cigogne on a Wednesday mid afternoon. This gave us the opportunity to chat with Jeremy, one of the very charming and friendly owners.

We then split the tarte flambe´ called fromagere. It was made with creme fraiche..perfectly sauteed onions...delicate pieces of bacon all on melted creamy muenster cheese. Whoever described the tarte in a previous post as being bland must have been expecting the heat of wasabi or jalapenos or Indian food vindaloo. If you have tastebuds that still function...treat them to these unique and beautiful flavors . We can't wait to go back for some spaetzle.",5.0

"I went for dinner with a few colleagues from work and had such a good time. This place has lovely ambiance and excellent service. Very good selection of wine and beer as well.For starters, we had the 'Chevre claud' tartes flambees (goat cheese, honey, creme fraiche and bacon).....freakin unreal, a must try! I had the 'nemrod spatzle' and Jeremy (the owner) suggested I tried it with bacon, I am so happy I listened to him. The spatzle had a lot of flavor, creamy and delicious. The bacon really took it up a notch. A few of friends had the ""le burger a la strasbourgeoise"" and loved it, I will be sure to return and try that next time. When you come here, don't hold back on the desserts they are fantastic. We had apple crumble, creme brulee, chocolate mousse and a tarte flambée  apple w/caramel & grand marnier--- yes, we pigged out and it was so worth it. Over all experience is a full 10.

"My BF and I lived close to the Alsatian region a couple of years ago, so we were very excited when I came across this restaurant! We ordered the following:Tarte Flambee (La Mer): The crust was super thin and crisp--I loved it. The salmon, spinach and creme fraiche toppings were a very simple but tasty combination. One issue I had was that it came out at room temperature. We did request that every dish come out at the same time, so that probably had something to do with it. Wish they had kept it warm, but regardless, it was still really delicious--which says a lot! Spaetzle (Gambrinus): The meat was extremely tender (and they were nice big, plentiful chunks). The foundation of the flavors (they use Meteor beer) was pretty spot on, but it was a bit underseasoned (I think a tad more salt would've brought out the flavors more). The spaetzle itself was good but a little mushy. I would've preferred them pan-fried. We thought this needed some minor tweaks but overall has potential to be really great.French fries: Don't know what kind of oil they fried their potatoes in, but they were really good! Crisp on the outside, soft in the middle and a good, deep flavor.Creme Brulee: Yum, it's solid. Order it.Soju cocktail with strawberries: If you are into fruity drinks, please order this. Basically tasted like a delicious strawberry juice. I should note that it's a bit light on the alcohol, but that was fine for me (because I get tipsy after a bottle of beer). Overall, good food. With some changes, could be really, really great. To boot, all the people were super friendly and welcoming. I wish the lights were dimmed down a bit more, though. My BF and I decided we will definitely come back to this restaurant, and we don't say that lightly in a city replete with restaurants we've yet to try!",4.0

"This has just become one of our go-to places. We've been strolling over from Red Hook to enjoy the convivial ambience and get a bite since it opened around World Cup time. The awning-shaded deck along the sidewalk is a perfect place to sit and watch the Carroll Gardens world go by (bikes, families, kids, old men sitting in front of the bakery across the street). The owners, both French, are wonderfully excited about their fare - great beers both on tap and in bottles (ask for the one that's ""good ale"" in 3 different languages) and Alsatian specialties that are worth coming back for so you can sample them all. Notably, any tarte flambée (""it's not a pizza""): the incredibly light-crusted dish, served on a bit of newspaper is enough for two and fresh and delicious every time. Also love the spaetzle, especially the beef marinated in the Meteor beer. Ridiculously good. Pleasing wine list, and all the nice Alsatian things are augmented by more traditional French bistro options (but really, try the tarte flambée).

"I visited La Cigogne last night and totally fell in love with it! From the warm, inviting ambience to the absolutely delicious food, and amazing service. I came with my boyfriend and toddler. I am always nervous about bringing my child out to nice restaurants and was very pleased to see how family friendly it was and how accommodating they were to my child. Not to mention the baby changing table in the cleanest bathroom I've ever seen in NYC. This is a huge plus for me! We ordered multiple items from the menu and everything was delicious. I am a pretty picky eater and had no complaints, everything was awesome. I'm a big dessert person also, and consider myself a creme brulee connoisseur, if a restaurant serves it, I will always order it. I can honestly say, this was one of the tastiest I've had. Just the way I love it, very crunchy on top and a nice firmness to the custard. Yum! I also had a delicious rose wine, which is my summer favorite and theirs did not disappoint. They have a nice selection of beer and wine as well as sake based cocktails. Overall, absolutely adorable place in a beautiful neighborhood. Great place to take your family, have a girls night, or romantic date. I can't wait to go back without the baby in tow, and have a date night with the boyfriend and pop some delicious French bubbly!

I am always nervous about bringing my child out to nice restaurants and was very pleased to see how family friendly it was and how accommodating they were to my child. Not to mention the baby changing table in the cleanest bathroom I've ever seen in NYC. This is a huge plus for me! We ordered multiple items from the menu and everything was delicious. I am a pretty picky eater and had no complaints, everything was awesome. I'm a big dessert person also, and consider myself a creme brulee connoisseur, if a restaurant serves it, I will always order it. I can honestly say, this was one of the tastiest I've had. Just the way I love it, very crunchy on top and a nice firmness to the custard. Yum! I also had a delicious rose wine, which is my summer favorite and theirs did not disappoint. They have a nice selection of beer and wine as well as sake based cocktails. Overall, absolutely adorable place in a beautiful neighborhood. Great place to take your family, have a girls night, or romantic date. I can't wait to go back without the baby in tow, and have a date night with the boyfriend and pop some delicious French bubbly! If you find yourself in the neighborhood make sure to stop into this gem!",5.0

"We have been meaning to go to La Cigogne since it opened and are so glad we finally made it in!  Jeremy was wonderful, made it feel like a real neighborhood place.  We loved the food and the atmosphere and it has such a fun mix of people with friends, on dates, with families (we took our 4 month old who loved it too!).  Definitely will be our go to neighborhood spot, so glad they have come to town...",5.0
I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! Im From Alsace and the spätzle (their homemade Alsatian style pasta) are perfect! Just remind me of home!! I can't wait to bring my friends there!! Keep your chef!!,5.0
"Fresh, inviting, new, tasty, interesting, French!  La Cigogne is a welcome addition to Carroll Gardens, so welcome in fact, that this was our second meal there in 7 days!  The menu offers a refreshing change from the neighborhood standards.  Steak frites was cooked to perfection. Cesar salad was the best I have ever had with a hint of lemon, and a generous share of shaved parmagiano, over crispy cold romaine.  The tart flambées are delightful thin crisp breads topped with choices like creme fraiche, goat cheese, figs, bacon, prosciutto, salmon, munster cheese, mushrooms.  We ordered both the creme brûlée, and mousse au chocolate for dessert with coffee.  Each was perfect. Creme brûlée was creamy and custardy with a substantial bruleed sugar crust on top.  The mousse was a rich dark chocolate garnished with a strawberry, and exactly as it is supposed to be, not topped with whipped cream.  I am already looking forward to enjoying the leftovers for lunch tomorrow, and planning on brunch this weekend!",5.0
"Fantastic addition to an already amazing food neighborhood. Loved my sake cocktail, the Caesar Salad was tangy and not too creamy. The Tarte Flambee with scallops was complex and sublime. Can't wait to go back and try everything else.",5.0
"We absolutely adore this restaurant!  It's perfect for Carroll Gardens - the food is amazing, the service is attentive without being intrusive and they love kids!  So far, everything we've tried on the menu has been outstanding. You can't go wrong with the scallops, burger and Tartes Flambees.  Also try the Croque Monsieur for Brunch - the most authentic in the neighborhood!  Jeremy and the rest of the staff are so welcoming. Considering how many new restaurants come and go with anonymous pasted-on, service and trendy food, La Cigogne really is a welcome mix of old-school service and amazing food and atmosphere.",5.0
"I feel very fortunate to have found this unique restaurant yesterday.  I used the Yelp search features (neighborhoods and time open) to find a restaurant between Borough Hall and Columbia Street that served dinner very early and La Cigogne was the best rated restaurant that met my criteria.  However, my experience far exceeded my expectations.  As we approached La Cigogne, the roaring fire beckoned from the frigid sidewalk.  The owner welcomed us warmly and seated us where we could spread out comfortably and enjoy the fire.  We enjoyed the Alsatian specialties, both the tartes flambees and the spaetzles, which were delicious.  There were several excellent, reasonably priced wines available by the bottle.  Throughout our leisurely meal, the service was attentive but never obtrusive.  I highly recommend this restaurant.  (By the way, a review  below shows a photo of a diner style plastic butter packet.  There was nothing like that at this restaurant.  The butter, and for that matter everything, was served attractively and appropriately.)",4.0
