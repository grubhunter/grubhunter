I love this pizza spot. The pizza is just delicious. I stumbled across this place because my nail salon is literally next door. I always get a pepperoni slice to go. The crust is my favorite part. The slices are always fresh tasting. Definitely a great place for pizza. I'll be trying there pasta soon So I tried their vodka Sicilian slice & it was finger licking good. I got a side of Mac & cheese just to be greedy The kale salad is just awesome and sooo fresh. Love the grandma slice too.Shoutout to my favorite guy Allen. He is awesome.,5.0
"Really good pizza. I had a plain slice and it was great. Thin crust, sauce packed with flavor and lots of cheese. Not doughy and oily like lots of other NY pizza spots. I also had the mocha cafe donut which was the size of my head lol. It was fresh and fluffy, worth the $3.",5.0
This place is great! I came here just because it looked very nice and I was blown away by the service and the food! Their roasted beet salad is amazing and their selection of different types of pizza and coffee really make this place stand out. I come by every time I'm in the neighborhood!,5.0
"I really enjoy their pizza, correction my whole family really enjoys their pizza! It was a staple for us for a while lol. We all really enjoy the added sesame seeds on the crust, a nice touch!The service is always awesome, everyone chats you up while you are waiting, answers any questions you may have about anything on the menu even on the phone super polite. I never feel like I'm a rushed making an order over the phone (which they certainly prefer to an online order). The only downfall about not being rushed over the food is sometimes the lines are so backed up you may have to call a few times to order. We've recently started branching out and trying other things on the menu. Penne ala vodka was good the kale Caesar salad with anchovies was not. Very very salty anchovies! They should definitely be chopped and tossed with the salad to distribute some of the salt.",5.0
"Eek... I heard great things about this place, but the pizza did not proverbially deliver. Although Daddy Greens is known for it's sesame crust pizza, we opted for the grandma pie - since that's usually our preference. Rocco's Pizza grandma pie on DeKalb has been our go-to pizza delivery spot in Bed-Stuy and their pies are *surprisingly* tasty. But we are always looking for something better - after all this is NYC and new spots are continually opening in Bed-Stuy. When the Daddy Greens grandma pie arrived, I knew it was going to be meh once I opened the box. Why? The grandma pie didn't have fresh basil. Instead, it was sprinkled with dry seasoning... But it got worse with the first bite. It was just blase, what else can I say? The worst part was the cheese/sauce ratio. There was WAY too much cheese and it tasted like bland shredded mozzarella just piled on the pie. The sauce had very little zest or zing.Now, this is not BAD pizza. But then again, you won't find me reviewing Domino's or Papa John's because they are not worth my time. But this was also not GOOD pizza...",2.0
"Excellent, excellent pizza. I can't say enough about it. We had several different kinds of slices and they were all delicious. Mmm....We also ordered mac-n-cheese...I took one bite (MAD GOOEY AND GOOD!) and had to pack it 'to go'. My eyes were definitely bigger than my stomach 'cause that shit is sitting in a brown bag in my fridge!  I'm gonna make a mac-n-cheese omelette for breakfast! The service was great. The dude treated us as if we were at his house for a family dinner. I loved it! Be back soon!",5.0
"I walk past this place once or twice a day, but never stopped in until last weekend. Pizza is surprisingly good. I've had some bad by the slice and I guess I wasn't expecting much by the Utica stop, but I was so wrong. They had a lot to choose from and portions were GENEROUS. Service was super quick and everyone who worked there was pretty laid back.",4.0
"My favourite place for takeout pizza in bedstuy, my go-to is the white Nona (though I'd love more grandma slices, the basil kills my stomach).  Staff are friendly, so I prefer to go to the store rather than have delivery.  Delivery takes ~45-55 mins on average so be aware if you're hungry!",5.0

"Ordered a sausage, tomato, pesto pie here last weekend. The ingredients were great- loved the fact that they scatter basil over every pie! The crust was really thin and flavorful, the only problem was that our pizza was too wet so it was very difficult to pick up a slice. All the toppings went sliding off! The sausage was delicious and juicy.Service is pretty disorganized, though. The staff seem distracted and occasionally lose pies (according to one argument amongst themselves!) and then needed to be reminded of what we had ordered, 25 minutes later. I think it's a good neighborhood joint but just a few tweaks would make it really great. Here's hoping they iron out their service issues and make a sturdier crust!",3.0
"Really wish I could give them a better review, bc I've eaten their pizza many times and it's really quite good!But my first attempt at delivery was such a disaster!  In short, it took two hours for the food to be delivered. And when it arrived of course the pizza was cold bc it had been sitting, which makes for not such great pizza. Sometimes things happen, so the long delivery time isn't even the worst part to me. It's that the restaurant seems completely unconcerned about it. I called twice and was not offered an apology at any point. During the first call the lady on the phone said the delivery was taking a while bc their guy was on a bike and they wanted to limit his time in the cold. Ok, but that's really odd bc 30 min after that call he arrived in a car. Tip to the restaurant - offer you customer a little something when you mess up. It shows you care. At a minimum refund the $3 delivery fee!! How ridiculous is that?!",3.0

They were a little picky about the basil on top (""I don't want broccoli strings!"") but it was actually a pretty great teachable moment. Who knows, maybe they'll start a herb garden? The Grandma Nonna tasted just like the pizza my grandma would make: thin crust, and lots of ricotta to top it off.. The Super Mario is a white pie with garlic, spinach, cheese and mushrooms. Definitely the teacher's room favorite...overall, everything was fresh, timely, and delicious.Quick tip about ordering - I placed it through eat24, but depending on the size of the order you might be able to save some $$ if you just call them!I can't wait to visit the actual store and try everything else!",5.0

"Quite possibly one of the best slices I've ever had. I've lived and traveled to NYC since I was a kid and I believe we have the best pizza!

I ordered the Kale Caesar with chicken and a butternut squash soup for take out. The salad was Really simple with no way of messing it up. Kale is tough in general but they were coated with just enough dressing to manage. I hate my salads drenched in dressing so it was perfect for me and tasty.

Sometimes it's double baked (Grandma) which gives greater texture and a more roasted aroma. Equally fresh is the pungent tomato sauce ladened with cloves on cloves of delicious stinky rose. The salads are not a side note, as they offer a hearty but light kiss to accompany whatever pizza or pasta dish chosen.

The name of the place is funny, since they also various types of pizza, which all looked and smelled good. The space has a rustic appeal (Brick walls, aged wooden tables) and was quite empty on that gloomy Saturday. Only a few customers that came in for take out and there were some staff around. I ordered the Kale Caesar with chicken and a butternut squash soup for take out. The salad was Really simple with no way of messing it up. Kale is tough in general but they were coated with just enough dressing to manage. I hate my salads drenched in dressing so it was perfect for me and tasty. This was my first time trying butternut squash soup. It was tasty but needed a few more added seasonings for my palette. Overall the staff were generally friendly and accommodating. I'll go back to try more things on the menu and the definitely the pizza :-)",4.0
"Daddy Greens is all Brooklyn & GREAT food. Stayed in the big Apple for a week and ate at Daddys each & everyday.  They took the time to get to know us and offer a kind hello. There is something for everyone. ..coffee, salads, yummy sandwiches but the pizza keeps ya coming back. Thanks for the terrific service, smiles & did I say awesome food.",5.0
The vegan pizza is awesome and you can get it by the slice!,5.0
"The Stuy's FRESH gem: Grandma's, Margherita, Salads (Garden & Kale Caesar) ALL tastes like each items freshly picked from the garden. The dough's light and airy. Sometimes it's double baked (Grandma) which gives greater texture and a more roasted aroma. Equally fresh is the pungent tomato sauce ladened with cloves on cloves of delicious stinky rose. The salads are not a side note, as they offer a hearty but light kiss to accompany whatever pizza or pasta dish chosen. Great addition to the neighborhood from a born & bred Bed-Stuy native, who knows just what feeds the soul of Brooklyn!",4.0
"Daddy's is the best pizza joint in Bedstuy! I've had a few of the slices and they are all fantastic, but the main way to judge a pizza spot is on its plain slice. Low and behold it's one of the best I've had in NYC. Cheesy, cracker thin, fresh basil on every slice and the main show case is the sesame seed crust. They also have salads, sandwiches, coffee and even dough doughnuts here. Prices are good and they even accept card with no minimum (that means tax is not included in the prices though) I'm going to keep eating here until I get obese and have to worry about a diet.",5.0
"Delicious pizza! The staff is very friendly and the restaurant has a nice atmosphere and free WiFi. It's very difficult to eat just one slice. The Margherita pizza is my favorite. Everything tastes soo fresh, if you're a pizza lover this is your place. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the delivery is a bit slow and my pizza arrived cold, even though I live near by.",4.0

"Its a huge shame when a pizza place that you really like and enjoy just goes to crap. I know you can do great things and you're selling a really bad product under the guise and price of a very good one. you just delivered to me the soggiest, shittiest pie of pizza. You should be ashamed to call yourself a brooklyn pizza spot. this is terrible. the box is soggy and not even holding its shape. Huge pool of oil underneath the pizza, none of the toppings will stay on the pizza. really poor.",1.0
"This is some of the best pizza in Bed-Stuy. Possibly New York City. There is one other place nearby that comes close, Saraghina on Halsey St, but this place is cheaper and the people who work here are really chill and really good neighbors. I came home late from a flight (i live across the street) and stopped here for a slice just before closing, and they gave me a free slice. Be sure to try the buffalo chicken slice and the margherita slice - both are fantastic. Regular cheese is really good too. I'm a fiend for basil, so they could put more on, but any pizza place that puts basil on by default is a good pizza place. Great coffee here too.",5.0
":( I read so many good reviews, and yet I didn't have such a great experience. this review is for their DELIVERY.

I can't speak for the business, but how busy are you really, on a Wednesday night? ugh. the delivery guy didn't even apologize for their lateness.maybe ill try them again but instead I'll make the 20/25 min trek to pick up my pizza. :/",1.0

Great salad! Awesome service! What else is there?!? I actually went there twice in one day! LolSee you next time on the block!,5.0
"I really, really dig this place. It's been an awesome addition to the neighborhood, considering pizza options are scant. The shop itself is very cute, low-key, and you can watch them make the pizza behind the counter which is cool. Some of the pizzas have sesame seeds in the crust, and those are my favorite! Adds a unique flavor and texture. All ingredients used taste fresh, and there are lots of slices to choose from. Their Grandma and White slices are my personal go-tos, as the plum tomatoes and ricotta are so good. They're always playing good tunes in the shop, and along with minimal but cute decor and a very clean bathroom, it makes me wanna hang around here for a long time.",5.0

"I really want to love this little neighborhood spot but I'm having trouble with the way their flavors are set up in their sauce and how it conflicts with the crust.

Okay so remember I was suppose to hit you back up with my review? Well that's because I was very disappointed. Smh .

I finally got to try their pizza. I give it three stars. It's pretty good pizza but it's not AMAZING like many other reviews say. My pizza was a bit soggy m- not perfect foldable pizza Like some others said. But pretty good. Great cheese. It's really the only pizza place in the area so definitely worth a shot.,3.0
Banging pizza. Sesame seed crust is right every time. But even more than that the dope cats here got me my camera back after leaving it. A1 Pizza. A1 People.,5.0
Okay so remember I was suppose to hit you back up with my review? Well that's because I was very disappointed. Smh . I'm going to show you a picture of how great it looked but what turned me off was the fresh basil they put on top (don't get me wrong I love basil) but every bite taste like a grain of dirt in my mouth... Ugh! Besides that delivery was very very fast even tho there was a misunderstanding about my address. I would try it again but dine inside... FYI wash your veggies.,2.0
"All of the salads are delicious, love that the chicken added to the salad is the interior of a well seasoned whole chicken vs sliced cutlets. Is a great spot in the neighborhood when looking for a quick, healthy, reasonably priced meal. The basil lemonade is very refreshing!",5.0
"No joke, best pizza I've had in a long time. Very unique yet traditional! Amazing fresh toppings and crazy sesame seed crust. I'm gonna tell the world!",5.0
These guys are the worst. I like their pizza but I don't think I've ever had a good experience ordering from them. They're about as unprofessional as a college kid selling crack. I've never experienced such weird conflicts with things I've ordered. I don't know what's going on over there. I'd say it's average pizza managed by 12 year olds trying to impress their friends.,1.0

"Daddy Green's has excellent food, but delivery takes a while. I've gotten delivery from here a lot since finding them. At first their was pizza is delicious, while the ingredients tasted fresh. There was a lot of inconsistencies with the pizza's and how they're made. Sometimes they're absolutely perfectly made and crisp. Other times, the dough is a bit too thin and slightly undercooked, and doesn't support the toppings. But now they've got this thing where they suddenly add seasame seeds to the crust. On top of their delivery minimun and fee, I find myself opting for other restuarants now. kind of a shame.",2.0
"Pizza isn't as great as I thought it would be, but their sandwiches are pretty yummy. No soy-free or wheat-free options, so pass for me from now on since I recently found out I'm allergic. Only 4 stars due to the super long wait time for your order.",4.0
I agree with Kayla S.  While the pizza is good they need to stop delivery service as it takes at least 1 1/2 hours for delivery that is less than 2 miles and the delivery guy is rude.  Some customer service training would help to make this place 5 stars.,3.0

The food is good. All the other reviewers have commented on that. What I am here to report on is the service. It's flawless. Every member of be staff knows the number one rule to running a successful small business: Never forget that with out the customers you won't have a business. There is no other place where I feel more appreciated when I spend my money. This place makes feel love. Mutual love and respect. Come here to see capitalism at its best. Both the customer and business owner feel great after the transaction. You don't get that anywhere else in the hood.,5.0

This place opened up right around the same time I moved to the neighborhood. It was great when it first opened and it has only gotten better. The Super Mario is one of the best veggie pizzas I've ever had and the Chicken Ceasar Pizza is uniquely delicious. Kola and all the staff are exceptionally friendly and welcoming - staying true to the vibe of Stuyvesant. And now they're on GrubHub for even easier delivery! Nothing but love for Daddy Green's!,5.0
"I got a yelp account just to write this review. They got the best regular slice in BK and damn near the best pizza in BK. The margherita is as good as any classic coal oven pizza spot and it has pesto on it. The sesame seed crust is an added benefit. The salads are excellent. Its owned by young dudes who are clearly committed to the neighborhood; I've seen community groups having meetings in there and I think they did a cop watch training in there too. They are a people's pizzeria. On top of all that, they deliver south of Eastern Parkway. Quite possibly the ideal Bed Stuy restaurant.",5.0

"New spot in Bed Stuy with a solid menu of pizza, pasta, salads, and hot drinks.  I got a $5 special (two cheese slices and a can soda). By far the best cheese slices I've had for the price in Brooklyn and Manhattan. - Prices are very good for the portions and quality of ingredients. - The folks are friendly and genuine. - Cool, laid-back and eclectic ambiance. Wood paneling with textured art pieces on one side, brick and tile on the other, and a Ninja Turtles poster that I was way too excited about near the bathrooms. I loved that they were playing traditional and two-tone Ska. This is definitely the best pizza I've had in Bed-Stuy and surrounding neighborhoods. They're brand new.

I've only ever had the pizzas here and they are delicious! Very happy to have this place in the neighborhood. I'm hoping with more business they will be able to be open later at night. I've never had a terribly long wait either. A great pick up a slice and go!,4.0

"Fantastic pizza and fantastic people! Stopped in for lunch and ordered a few slices. The people working the counter were very friendly and helpful. As we were eating, a neighborhood woman and her daughter walked by and the little girl called in to say hello to the man making pizzas, he stopped, walked from out behind the counter, stooped down and gave her a hug and asked how she was doing and how school was. Same guy later comes by our table with samples of their basil lemonade (great!). You get great pizza here from nice people who care about their community. New York can be proud of Daddy Greens.",5.0

"The best margherita pizza i've ever had. The homemade pesto is beyond delicious. I also had the spinach salad which was super fresh, and balsamic reduction was perfect. If in the area or even not I highly recommend this place to all.",5.0
"umm... as a super fan of the cult classic ""the last dragon"" i really wanted to like this place. so the name alone, gets five stars. take one star away since it took an HOUR for them to deliver a small margerita pizza(i live 4 blocks away). take another star away since that pizza was COLD. take another star away since the crust was TOUGH. maybe i need to go inside and order a different kind of pizza. when i do, i'll be inclined to revise my review. until then, meh. also, they charge a 3 dollar delivery fee... wtf? that makes me less inclined to tip the delivery guy(i didn't). i really should've picked it up myself.",2.0
"I cannot rave about this place enough.  Their margarita pizza is literally the best, most deliciously flavored slice I have ever eaten in my whole life, and I am a native New Yorker with very high pizza standards. The pesto sauce they drizzle on it is mouthwatering, and the sesame seeds on the crust are a unique touch to an old classic.  The vodka sauce and grandma are also very good. The staff is friendly and attentive, the woman at the register has amazing style and is always playing a great selection of music, there is a homey feeling with the wood walls and off beat art, their bathroom is clean, they have coffee and yummy desserts and interesting sodas like Goslings ginger beer too.  I feel so lucky to have this gem in my neighborhood.  I crave them at least once a week.  Go support them! Yay Daddy Greens!!",5.0
Super friendly staff and owner.. Very good thin crust pizza ..  I was working in the area for a few days...  And went there for lunch everyday.. The pasta was very good as well,5.0
"Finally!! A reliable, delicious slice in the hood!  Quality cheese, tasty sauce & crispy crust.  I'm a fan.  Taking home a Chicken Sandwich.  Let y'all know about that later.  Daddy Green is a GO!",5.0
"I recently moved to the neighborhood and, until last night, haven't made an attempt to find a good pizza place for delivery. I tried Daddy Greens for the first time and was so happy, I felt they deserved a 5 star review. A few minutes after ordering online, they gave me a call to make sure they were creating the right pizza according to all the additional toppings my fat ass ordered. The girl on the phone was really nice. That already impressed me. The delivery was fast and the guy was nice enough to offer to bring it inside my apartment because I'm currently on crutches due to an injured foot. He was super friendly as well. Great. Now onto how it tasted......AMAZING! Some of the best pizza I've had in a while. Fresh ingedients and delicious. Great salad, too. As I was eating she called back to make sure I had my salad, I guess they thought maybe it hadn't been delivered...(it was). Awesome place. Can't wait to try it in person...when I can walk again without these damn crutches.",5.0

"OKAY. THIS PLACE IS BANGIN. I had their buffalo pizza today and it was so good I got a second one (which isn't very casual because their slices are humongous). The crust has an amazing pretzel like consistency to it and is so crispy. The workers are really nice and have a great sense of humor, and they now offer mac and cheese which is SO GOOD. The cost is so doable and you  get way more than you pay for which is always a win! PS THE MUSIC THEY PLAY ROCKED MY WORLD.",5.0
Great pizza and great staff!! Def will be my new fav spot!! And we got a free slice :) def a hood gem!!,5.0
This is some of the best pizza I have ever had!  AND they have freshly grated cheese in their dispensers!  AWESOME!,5.0
"Found them on grubhub and ordered from them solely based on the name. (Pizza shop from the Last Dragon.) I had been complaining about not having any good pizza since moving 2 years ago, and I figured they couldn't be any worse than where I'd been ordering from. Anyway, their pizza was perfect and the sandwich my husband had was pretty good too. My new fave!",5.0
