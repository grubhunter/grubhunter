"My family and I came here for dinner. We had been wanting to come here ever since we heard it was coming to the neighborhood. You know how sometimes you get so excited to go somewhere and you build it up a lot in your head and then it lets you down? This was not the case with Bricolage. The decor inside is industrial steam punk with little rustic touches. Every chair in the whole restaurant is different, which I thought was a fun rustic touch. The menu is definitely not exhaustive but has a pretty good variety of items. As a vegetarian, i'm usually stuck with one choice, but this menu had a few options for me. I ordered the vegetarian summer rolls which were delicious and refreshing. Lots of fresh ingredients were used and the peanut dipping sauce was a perfect compliment and not too overpowering. I also ordered the Bahn Cahn Noodles which were freaking amazing. This was filled with ingredients in your typical noodle bowl but was covered in an incredible sauce that complimented the noddles and vegetables perfectly. I couldn't get enough of it. It was simply amazing. My husband got the steak and ate every last thing on his plate. He loved it. My mom got one of the Vietnamese crepes and really enjoyed hers as well. My father actually wasn't feeling well that night and ended up not being able to eat his vegetarian crepe he ordered. Which was great for my husband and me because we gained his leftovers! It was quite good the next day! When my Dad asked to have his order wrapped up (untouched), he explained he was suffering from severe heart burn and couldn't eat. The server asked if he wanted milk and brought him some! So nice! The prices are pretty reasonable as well. I loved this place and can't wait to come back.",5.0
"Great happy hour specials. One dollar oysters and some of the best viet snacks. Makes me miss vietnam. Sat at the bar and ordered wings, imperial rolls, wagyu jerky and pig ears. My fave were the pig ears. You probably will want to order five orders though as they are quite small. Bartender and staff are nice too",5.0
"Quick, easy and accommodating in seating.Great service though just a TAD slow in getting drinks out.Food was great and would absolutely be back!",5.0
"Lordy, am I behind on my reviews. The air was frigid, but our hearts warm, in town to celebrate the engagement of a certain lovely lady to her leading man.While to many, ""brunch"" entails pancakes, waffles, and bacon (oh my!), if you're starting the day at Bricolage, put on your game face for a bougie-ass fresh summer role, green papaya salad, breakie bahn xeo crepe, or even unshaking beef.Yes, you can also get a pork belly hash (garlic/soy braised, fried egg, arugula, lime), croissant French toast (coffee whip, condensed milk creme angelaise, bluebs), or a side of yogurt/granola - and while those who went with the more traditional brunch items were not disappointed, if you're here, you might as well go out Saigon-style.Admittedly, the summer rolls (cuc, bean sprouts, herbs, vermicelli) were nothing extraordinary, but the green pap salad (cuc, celery, rau ram, shallots, peanuts) was crisp and tangy in all the right ways - and my goodness, my breakie crepe with king oyster/maitake shrooms, bean sprouts, fried eggs - ummmm, yes - I'll take a billion, pls - rich without being heavy, satiating in the best of ways. Many neighboring tables were hitting the fried chicken and waffles (5 spice, fennel slaw, sriracha butter, maple) and the pho ga (chicken, rice noodle, bean sprouts, shallots, herbs) and exactly zero faces looked sad abt it. At noonish on a Saturday, wasn't slammed, though it was madly cold out, hard to tell if thin crowd was indicative of lack of popularity or ppl's full-on terror at the prospect of facing nearly sub-zero temps -  vibe is reclaimed wood, old school mismatched lighting, succulents - part Secret Garden, part Park Slope hip-family chic - though be warned, if your toddler is feeling fussy or you're a hangry adult, service isn't lightening quick. Be prepared to linger. Starters $8-12, soups $12ish, entrees $13-18, cocktails $9-11. Vietnamese coffee and tea were both randomly $7 per pot, which seemed excessive, though they were tasty. If you're going light on the booze, brunch can be done for $30ish/pp, depending on your proclivity for multi-course meals. If I lived in the hood, I'd be back.",4.0
"Un vrai bijou au coeur de Park Slope.Our experience was delightful: tastes, service, ambiance. Recommended for a special night out",5.0
"Randomly stumbled into this restaurant and I'm so glad I did. My friend and I ordered:1) shrimp and pork belly summer rolls: the dipping sauce is good, I didn't really like the flavor of the pork belly in the rolls. The skin of the summer roll was very chewy which j liked. 2) lemongrass pork chop: they cook the porkchop to be slightly rare. However it is seasoned very well and pairs nicely with the rice. The arugula salad was slightly too bitter for my taste. 3) Unshaking beef: this didn't really have any Vietnamese flavors in my opinion but it was nevertheless marinated very well and cooked to a medium rare. The watercress salad was the best part about this dish. It had a sort of sweet and fruity dressing that just went really well with the vegetables. I'm still craving and thinking about it. The cocktails here are good although the one I ordered was overpowered by the flavor of the IPA. I was expecting more citrusy flavors. My friend had this grapefruit cocktail that contained sparkling wine. She seems to enjoy it. I would come back if this restaurant wasn't so expensive.",4.0
"According to Chef Lien, Bricolage means to bring together different things that you have & make something nice of it & this wonderful addition to Park Slope delivers that. This casual Vietnamese Gastropub has great food & amazing cocktails. The chefs Lien & Edward have brought amazing Vietnamese with a touch of Chinese flavors all the way from San Francisco to Brooklyn. Bricolage's cocktail menu caught my eye based on the Vietnamese inspired ingredients they use. Here are the two cocktails I have explored & recommend:The Thai Basil Gimlet, a refreshing & delicious drink which consists of gin, pineapple gum, lime, & thai basil. The pineapple gum added a slightly creamy sweetness to the drink which balanced out the tart lime flavor & the juniper berry essence of the gin. Then there is the Japanese Cocktail, a bourbon based drink which includes calvados, orgeat, & bitters. The calvados added a soft fruity taste, the orgeat provided a little sweetness, & the bitters created a nice balance between all ingredients. After having a few cocktails, it was time to try some appetizers. The Vietnamese Crepe, filled with fresh Georgia white shrimp, pork, onions, & bean sprouts & the Crispy Imperial Rolls, stuffed with pork, shrimp, glass noodle, & wood ear mushrooms were both crispy & freaking delicious. Wrap them up in the greens & dip it into the fish sauce. And the winner of the evening was the Lemongrass Grilled Pork Chop, which was cooked perfectly as you will see by the beautiful grill char lines on both sides of the meat. This thick & juicy Niman Ranch pork was served with an apple, fennel, & arugula salad.  Bricolage is worth the splurge so whenever you are ready to taste amazing Asian cuisine, Bricolage is your place to do so.",5.0
"Wonderful staff, delicious food with complex flavors and a beautiful setting. I highly recommend the pork chop, the kohlrabi salad and the crepe. The chicken liver was really tasty as well. Oh, and they have lots of gluten-free options (and also will alter dishes to cater to gluten free). Seriously, if you haven't been to this cozy Vietnamese gastropub yet, you're missing out. I wish I lived in Brooklyn!",5.0
"Well done food, a slightly nicer and fancier version of typical fare. There are some nice dishes on the menu such as the stone pot rice which you dont find in a lot of places.Basically this is Vietnamese, Chinese, and other Asian fare served in a western setting with western cocktails. If that's what you're looking for, this isn't bad.",4.0
"I've been eager to come here ever since they opened up and I was so satisfied. I only wished that I had visited before it got cold so that I could take advantage of the outdoor space (which looks pretty dope).I came to Bricolage with my family and boyfriend the Friday after thanksgiving. My parents love trying new cuisines but they also are tough to please (sometimes).  Food:- Vegetarian Summer Rolls - the rolls were simple but so fresh and complemented perfectly with the spicy peanut sauce. It does have a kick but not enough to render your mouth useless. - Pork Ribs: according to my parents, the ribs basically melted in their mouths and had neat carmelized char lines are around - Unshaking Beef - I didn't try the beef but the watercress salad was dressed really nicely. My dad mentioned that the beef is very fatty (which is fantastic for some but not all). He just happens to be a bit of a fitness nut so it didn't strike quite the right chord with him.- Bahn Cahn Noodle - I've never had coconut milk sauce on noodles. I love that they were homemade and the flavors were really subtle which was great because I mixed them in with the watercress salad from my parent's shaking beef dish.It does tend to get packed later in the night, though we had not too much trouble snagging a table around 7:30pm. Also Andre was the man! Thanks for great service all around :)",4.0
"I haven't had Vietnamese food this good since... well... Vietnam.  I remember the first time I walked by this place after it had just opened... I looked at the menu and thought ""Wow, this is ACTUAL Vietnamese"".  So keep in mind, this is not a ""banh mi / grilled chicken on vermicelli noodle"" joint.  This is the real deal.  You'll find interesting and delicate dishes that are true to form representations of central and northern Vietnam.  They'll only difference is that in Vietnam you'll pay $5 for it versus the $120 you'll easily spend here... such is the price of exportation.The interior is beautiful... brick walls, dim lighting.  The framed rusted metal on the walls are apparently things they pulled from the Gowanus (and hopefully disinfected).  They are all about local, from the decor to the ingredients.  It's intimate enough for a date night, yet spacious enough for a group outing.Everything here is served family style, so it's best to make a reservation, go with a group of friends and try many things.  Clay pot chicken, get it... branzino, ditto, cha ca la vong, yes! The rolls, the papaya salad, the wings, the banh xeo... oh the banh xeo.  You honestly can't go wrong.And, in the end, as you roll your stuffed self out of your seat and out the door, I'm willing to wager good money that it'll still be the healthiest meal you've eaten all week.",5.0
"Thankfully I don't command much online influence, otherwise I would keep my glowing opinions of Bricolage to myself lest it become too difficult to get a table there. This is simply a magnificent restaurant. The food is delicious and the service is Danny Meyer-level exquisite. Every meal I have had here with my family has been a delightful experience and I look forward to going back again.The crepes, various lettuce rolls, pork chop and shaking beef are all fantastic, and even the desserts are great. Plus, as mentioned, everyone who works there is so nice! Even the decor is something to enjoy.",5.0
"I'm not a fancy person. If you look at my reviews on Yelp, the fanciest I get is a nice cocktail every once in awhile. But sometimes you just need to treat yourself to something fancy*, right?Enter Bricolage, heaven in a small-ish Vietnamese restaurant. They have a small but well curated beer and wine list, and their servers are very knowledgeable about the full list and what goes well with each dish. We started with some summer rolls and a delicious peanut sauce (I'd take a bath in peanut sauce if that was both sanitary and a proven way to clean oneself). As a vegetarian, there was only one option on the entree menu that I could order, but thankfully it was amazing: the house made banh canh noodle is savory, fresh and really filling. The fella said that his pork belly clay pot was also wonderful. This was one of those times I was really jealous I couldn't lean over and grab some of his dinner like he can with my meal.Go, eat, enjoy. *YMMV on how fancy this is. If your level of fancy is ABC Kitchen, then Bricolage is probably takeout food for you. That's okay: it's really good takeout food, if that's the case.",4.0
"First, to set the record straight. The wait times are not exaggerated here. If they tell you a three hour wait, it will be a three hour wait.That being said, while late night dining may not be for everybody, they certainly provide a nice experience for those who have no qualms about going to bed on a massively full stomach. The space is very nice and the service is even better. We started off with cocktails, I had a basil gimlet which was very enjoyable. We ordered the papaya salad, spring rolls, Unshaking Beef, and Banh Canh noodles. Of the two starters, the spring rolls were definitely the best. Great ingredients in the filling and fried perfectly crispy. The papaya salad was confusing to me. I honestly couldn't find the papaya or even taste it. Lots of cucumber, some nice flavors with the anchovy and veggies, but I honestly wouldn't have known it was papaya salad if I hadn't ordered it. For entrees, the Unshaking Beef was definitely superior to the noodles. The strips of beef ranged from being rare (absolutely delicious) to medium well (mostly tasty). There was also a side of lemon sauce, which was not only unnecessary, but I actually disliked. The vegetables (ramps and onions) were a nice accompaniment to the meat. The Banh Canh noodles sounded delicious on the menu, but weren't executed so well. The coconut milk was plentiful in the dish, and much too rich and heavy. The flavor was nice, but just too overpowering. Even with its misses, it's a nice place worth checking out, if you don't mind finishing your dinner shortly before midnight.",4.0
"Awesome new spot on the bustling st of park Slope's 5th ave. Was there for cocktails and snacks so did not try many items. The Sriracha butter chicken wings are a must-try and they accompany your cocktail of choice very well. We ended up ordering another order of the spring rolls because they were so yummy with the peanut dipping sauce. The collection of cocktails are quite tasty, esp the one with lavender which is apparently already a local favorite.  I do plan on another visit when I'm in the nabe so I can try other tasty menu items like the chicken and noodle dish.",4.0
"Really looked forward to this place as it's been hyped up for some time and I've been to the Slanted Door in SF that was good. Unfortunately there was much left to be desired after tonight.. Overall their take on Vietnamese food wasn't bad. Would highly recommend the pork ear and branzino, both done beautifully with lots of good light flavors. Claypot pork belly was ok, a bit tok salty for my taste, and the spring rolls and banh xeo were good but nothing special (not worth the price in my opinion!). Drinks were good but it took so long to get! We placed an order right after we sat down (outside, nonetheless) and it took almost 30min to arrive. We also ordered a bottle of wine that they left off the final receipt, and even after we paid came back and asked us to pay for the wine. You figure at that point you might as well have just given it to us! My overall impression was good up until then... Just too bad! Not sure if I'd go back soon but just be aware the service might be subpar on busy nights..",2.0
"Webster's dictionary defines ""bricolage"" as a ""construction achieved by using whatever comes to hand"" and it's an apt name for this Vietnamese fusion restaurant from the chefs who brought you Slanted Door in San Francisco.The space is the former Brooklyn Fish Camp location. They've done a great job renovating, and adding artificially aged charm. From the chandeliers to the TVs stuck on white noise in the bathrooms to the mismatched wood panels and books lining the walls - the decor is itself decidedly bricolage.There's been a ton of press around this restaurant, and I was warned by a friend that there's a bit of a wait (my friend tried to get a table on a Saturday night and was told the next availability was 11pm). Luckily, I came in around 6pm on a Friday and had better luck. My reservation for two was at 9:15. A bit later than I usually eat dinner, but hey, just pretend you're in Manhattan.In any case, the service here is wonderful.

A bit sweet, but our server warned me of that. Good drink to have one of. Also tried the basil gimlet, which was a better sipping drink.For starters, we shared the papaya salad and the Imperial spring rolls. I wasn't a huge fan of the papaya salad - it was hard to get any taste of papaya, though it was very refreshing due to the cucumber. I'm not typically a fan of celery, but it added some much needed texture. The Imperial rolls, however, were excellent. They were made with pork, shrimp, glass noodles and wood ear mushroom filling. Like traditional Vietnamese restaurants, they provide you the lettuce, mint, and fish sauce for dipping. All the flavors mixed together very well, with the shredded meat and the umami of the mushrooms.For our mains, we had the Unshaking Beef and the Banh Canh noodles. The Unshaking Beef was the most expensive item on the menu (at $35), but it was well worth it. It was a ribeye steak cut into strips with pearl onions and ramps on the side. We ordered ours medium rare, but the larger, bloodier pieces in the middle were the most delicious. I would definitely recommend doing it rare if you're into that. I always love pearl onions, so that added a nice balance of sweet to the meaty. The ramps were also good, with just the tiniest bit of bitterness to even everything out. However, I wasn't a fan of the lemon pepper sauce. It was too harsh and took away from the natural flavor of the beef.The Banh Canh noodles were a bit disappointing. Be warned that it comes with a LOT of coconut milk. It's all at the bottom, so if you have concerns about sweetness or thickness, don't mix it all up together. It's a vegetarian dish, where the grilled tofu is the main star. However, it's way overshadowed by the coconut milk. Actually couldn't finish it due to how rich it was.One last kudo to the service. I asked our waiter for a whiskey menu, and he actually had one of the bartenders come over and explain what they had at the bar. Had a brief conversation with him (which was probably stressful for him since the bar had customers at the time) and ended up drinking a glass of High West American Prairie corn whiskey. I actually kind of teared up from how good it was.Anyway, as expected, the place was very busy, but service never suffered.

Each time we've been there have been new additions to the menu. We love the rib appetizers, and the last time we went we ordered a cauliflower side dish with lemon preserves. Our waiter recommended it and we weren't disappointed. It's becoming a favorite in our neighborhood.",5.0
"Went here a couple weeks ago with a close friend.  Had a great time. It was a cold Friday night and it nice and cozy. It had the typical ""Brooklyn"" feel which I liked. There was the open kitchen but I sat with my back to it. The service was really good and timely. Our waiter gave a full breakdown of every dish we received, which was a nice touch. Seemed like he knew all the dishes by heart whenever we asked about anything. Don't always see that.Food:Ok, so to what everyone *mostly* cares about. Everything we had was tasty. No complaints. (Disclaimer: I'm far away from an taste expert ;) )We shared Beet salad to start. It was fresh and crunchy. There were pieces of grapefruit in it that I really liked. A bit pricey though... for a salad.For our main course I had the popular unshaking beef.(medium rare) It was not over hyped. It was on the fatty side, which I like. It was tender and full of flavor. Watercress was good sidekick to it.My friend had the lemongrass pork chop. It cam sliced up and was grilled perfectly. I snuck a couple bites of it and it  was delicious. She enjoyed it as well. Could not complain about the portion size of either.Desert:We felt like sharing a desert so we indulged in a chocolate cake, with a touch of cream. I keep my cake eating to minimum but this made me want to have more. It was a perfect mix of richness and sweet flavor.Drinks:I had a the Thai Basil Gimlet cocktail. No complaints on that either. I love Gin and Pineapple and this did not disappoint. It was a perfect blend, that was a nice start to the night. Before we left we got some white tea to warm us up before we left. Was served in a charming Kettle and cup. Nice touch. Overall I enjoyed myself here. Only thing I'd say it's on the pricey side but given the neighborhood, that's to be expected.  Flavor is great and service is excellent. Just be prepared to spend a bit more than you'd expect at a Vietnamese spot.",4.0

"I've been here only twice, so perhaps a review is premature. But both times my meal has been delicious, fresh, and flavorful. The service has been friendly and interested in making my experience enjoyable without being pushy or hovering. Also, I think the head chef is a woman! Though that's maybe neither here nor there, I think it's a pretty cool added bonus! I'm going to do a little research to find out the facts.",5.0
"My Husband and I had heard great things about this place and finally made the time to have dinner here. I loved the decor and how every light fixture was different and unique. The place was inviting and cozy. The open kitchen gave us a sneak peak of operations and of the food that was coming out. We had the beet salad and vegetarian summer rolls to start. The beet salad was packed with flavor and oh-so delicious. The kind of delicious that made you close your eyes on the first bite. The summer rolls were fresh and the spicy peanut sauce was well-balanced. Next, we had the vegetarian banh xeo (crepe) which was a little tricky to eat but worth the work. My dad used to make these for us growing up so I'm accustomed to a more traditional Vietnamese banh xeo with pork, shrimp, and bean sprouts where the batter isn't as crispy. Bricolage's vegetarian version is different in a good way and is still reminiscent of it's more traditional counterpart. After the crepe, we had the clay pot shrimp...OMG! It reminded me so much of my dad's clay pot fish. The carmelized brown sauce was the perfect consistency, not too thick and not too thin or loose. The flavor was an incredible dance party on my tongue. It was definitely my favorite of all the dishes so far. Next up was the Branzino, whole fish from head to tail. Perfectly cooked and seasoned. The white flesh fell off the bone and the sauce was a perfect pairing - not too oily and just the right consistency. For dessert, we had the bleu cheese chocolate cake topped with toasted sliced almonds and a smear of what I believe was quints preserve and the 5-spice tapioca rice pudding topped with small dices of fresh mango. The cake was very moist and tasty. The bleu cheese worked well to offset the sweetness of the chocolate. The tapioca rice pudding was not too sweet and surprisingly refreshing on the palate - I was a big fan of this dessert since I don't prefer overly sweet or sugary treats. I'm looking forward to coming back and trying the banh canh. This dish was one of my favorites growing up. My mom makes a mean banh canh and I'm excited to try Bricolage's version on our next visit. Keep up the great work, Bricolage!",5.0

"The Lemongrass Pork is the must order. One of the most amazing pork chops I have had in years. Every dish we had, brussel sprouts, the cod, crepe, ribs, etc, were a solid, must order again dish. Would be 5 star, but unfortunately our main dishes came out at different times. My friend ate theirs while I watched and waiting at least 5 minutes for my dish to come out.

I don't think amazing does it justice. The food here is some of the best I've had in the neighborhood. I was a little worried being a vegetarian that their meatcentric menu would be limiting but it was not. The veggie spring roll apitizers were delish and the Udon noodle main course was SO good!

Can't wait to go back.,5.0
"I've got no problem with an upscale entry into Park Slope's Vietnamese scene, but I worry that too much of the innovation here is on the price point. ""Unshaking Beef"" is definitely the only version of this dish to wander into the mid-$30 entrée range, while a $13 order of spring roll is an unwelcome surprise on seeing the menu. (Bricolage is fancy enough that they don't list prices on the website, a pet peeve.)The vegetarian version of those eggs are basically tubes of salad, pleasant enough but barely more than a bite or two each. The banh xeo, visible on several tables, is rather traditional. I'd expect more innovation for what they want. The more unusual the dish, the better it generally tastes. The sriracha wings come in a surprisingly large portion, with nearly eight wings on the platter. The frying is plain but the dipping sauce should be should in a takeaway container. (Nominally this is sriracha based, but there's more going on here.)Best of all is an eggplant appetizer that is rich and smooth. It's too small, and I wonder if we should just ahead and order it again. Perhaps if I'd been more prepared for the splurge, I would have more enjoyed my experience here, but as it is it seemed hard to justify the premium price point.",3.0
"Bricolage is our favorite restaurant in NYC. If we didn't live across the city in the Bronx, we'd be here once a week. Not everyone will agree with this, but even if I like a restaurant's food, I can't pull the trigger on 5 stars unless it also has amazing drinks - and those at Bricolage are off the charts. The cocktails are innovative and unusual without being weird or over the top - and if you're a fellow cocktail maven, you know what I mean when I say that balance is a critical but difficult needle to thread. I'm not going to name my favorites because the drink menu is ever changing, but I promise you won't be disappointed. The head bartender, Tristan, is a beverage artist, and if you're game, you can always just say ""gimme a refreshing bourbon cocktail,"" for example, and let him work his magic. Next, the food. I haven't found any Vietnamese food in NYC quite like this: it's so fresh and flavorful and fun. It's the kind of food that makes you stop talking, even after multiple cocktails, to savor its deliciousness. You must start with the Crispy Imperial Rolls and the Vietnamese Crepes (one pork, one vegetable for good measure), and if you're a rib person, go Pork Ribs too. Among the large plates, anything goes, but being partial to pork, I have to recommend the Lemongrass Grilled Pork Chop. I believe the Claypots and Noodles rotate their star ingredients, but I've always loved them, no matter what the featured meat or fish. Also, don't skip the sides - both the Brussels sprouts and kale are winners. Finally, you MUST save room for dessert, because until you've had the Molten Chocolate Cake here, you haven't lived. Full disclosure, I'm not a huge dessert person and especially eschew chocolate desserts - but this cake is the exception to that rule. It has a swirl of - I hope you're sitting down - blue cheese melted within that somehow complements the chocolate in the most fabulous, delicious way imaginable. Actually, you can't imagine it - you must taste it for yourself. The space is cozy and fun (I'm dying to try the garden now that warmer weather is upon us), and the service is the perfect combination of knowledgeable and professional, yet friendly and laid back (without being hipster-y).

The unshaking beef and crepe were table favorites, but we were really impressed with everything. The owner, Kyle, came by to check in, and was great. He told us all about the background on the restaurant, and how the chefs came from the popular SF spot, Slanted Door.

"Food is pretty horrible but I did get good service.I ordered the thai basil gimlet (even though the super friendly waitress recommended wine) which was a refreshing start. It was recommended that for 2 people we should order 3 appetizers and 1 entree to share, so we got papaya salad, bahn xeo, chicken wings with sriracha butter and unshaking beef. It was a lot for 2 people so if you aren't that hungry 2 appetizers and 1 entree would do. I liked the anchovy sauce in the papaya salad, the texture of the crepe, and the watercress in the beef but couldn't find any other redeeming qualities among the dishes. The fillings of the bahn xeo consisted disproportionately of a large amount of bean sprout and too little of everything else. The dipping sauce was flavorful and the chef should have incorporated that into the crepe itself. Same goes with the chicken wings. The breading was pretty much unseasoned and all flavors were in the sriracha butter, which tasted more like buffalo sauce than sriracha. The beef was very chewy and plain. Service is very good and I am sure they will expand their menu soon so I might visit again but certainly not in the near future.",2.0

"One of the greatest restaurant disappointments. I always wanted to go to Slanted Door in SF.I didn't want to believe the review here that said to save your $$ and spend it at one of the usual good, cheap Vietnamese restaurants.  That Yelper was right on.Very nice back patio and service was fine, place was empty 5:30 on an August Saturday.  That's where the good ends.   Maybe the real chef went on vacation?Papaya salad looked incredible but was the worst I've ever had.  ZERO flavor.  I have no idea how this could have turned out so tasteless.  It was like making yourself eat raw, tasteless white radishes. $20 chicken claypot- I've had much better for half the price.  Chicken quality needed to be better- more tender.  Sauce had next to no flavor.    Only got some flavor with the one sprig of cilantro.   You get rice if you ask for it and it is a half filled bowl and blah. Grilled lemongrass pork chops- looked incredible.  Large portion but served with way too much arugula.   Pork was DRY, chewy and FLAVORLESS.Sorry for the caps but at $27.00 for this dish, it really is wrong that you are charged triple the price of so many other Viet. places where you could have delicious, tender pork with real lemongrass flavor.Chocolate lava cake with blue cheese--- interesting/different - was decent.  Have had much better lava cakes.  I could melt a little blue cheese in the center of a Trader Joe lava cake and it would taste the same. 100 bucks later (with tip and one beer)-  I completely give up on over-hyped Park Slope area restaurants",1.0
"A nice little gem where I believe fish camp use to be is now a vietnamese gastropub. With a cute dining area and a really nice outside eating patio, this vietnamese spot pulls away from the typical vietnamese pho soups and sandwiches we all know and love. My experience began with their SF smash cocktail, I knew by the taste that the gastro party would begin with a bang. The crispy imperial rolls were perfectly crunchy and the tasty. For entree I had to go for the unshaking beef. Wonderfully marinated and delicious and with its side of watercress and mushrooms, it probably was the best piece of beef I've had in Park Slope in a long time. Service is quick and knowledgeable and although a bit on the pricey side, it was worth every bite.",4.0
"Phenomenal! Great Vietnamese-inspired spot with an exciting, flavorful menu filled with high-quality ingredients. We ordered a ton of appetizers and nothing went to waste: beef on beef, summer rolls, eggplant salad, papaya salad, pig ear, crepe. All delicious!

"This mark is more for the service than the food. The food was good. Being Vietnamese, the food is not authentic but a good take on it. The service is where I take issue. It might have been the worse service I've ever experienced. Our waitress was inattentive the entire night. Our cocktails took an hour to come. She forgot what we ordered despite writing something down when we placed our order. Billing was another fiasco that could've been rectified easily but was not handled well at all. Needless to say it won't be a place we'll be revisiting anytime soon.",1.0

"One of the greatest restaurant disappointments. I always wanted to go to Slanted Door in SF.I didn't want to believe the review here that said to save your $$ and spend it at one of the usual good, cheap Vietnamese restaurants.  That Yelper was right on.Very nice back patio and service was fine, place was empty 5:30 on an August Saturday.  That's where the good ends.   Maybe the real chef went on vacation?Papaya salad looked incredible but was the worst I've ever had.  ZERO flavor.  I have no idea how this could have turned out so tasteless.  It was like making yourself eat raw, tasteless white radishes. $20 chicken claypot- I've had much better for half the price.  Chicken quality needed to be better- more tender.  Sauce had next to no flavor.    Only got some flavor with the one sprig of cilantro.   You get rice if you ask for it and it is a half filled bowl and blah. Grilled lemongrass pork chops- looked incredible.  Large portion but served with way too much arugula.   Pork was DRY, chewy and FLAVORLESS.Sorry for the caps but at $27.00 for this dish, it really is wrong that you are charged triple the price of so many other Viet. places where you could have delicious, tender pork with real lemongrass flavor.Chocolate lava cake with blue cheese--- interesting/different - was decent.  Have had much better lava cakes.  I could melt a little blue cheese in the center of a Trader Joe lava cake and it would taste the same. 100 bucks later (with tip and one beer)-  I completely give up on over-hyped Park Slope area restaurants",1.0
"A nice little gem where I believe fish camp use to be is now a vietnamese gastropub. With a cute dining area and a really nice outside eating patio, this vietnamese spot pulls away from the typical vietnamese pho soups and sandwiches we all know and love. My experience began with their SF smash cocktail, I knew by the taste that the gastro party would begin with a bang. The crispy imperial rolls were perfectly crunchy and the tasty. For entree I had to go for the unshaking beef. Wonderfully marinated and delicious and with its side of watercress and mushrooms, it probably was the best piece of beef I've had in Park Slope in a long time. Service is quick and knowledgeable and although a bit on the pricey side, it was worth every bite.",4.0
"Phenomenal! Great Vietnamese-inspired spot with an exciting, flavorful menu filled with high-quality ingredients.

"Place was extremely busy on Thursday, so I right away knew it must be a good spot and I had to try it. Place looks very cozy and service is very good here, I though food was pretty good too.

"This mark is more for the service than the food. The food was good. Being Vietnamese, the food is not authentic but a good take on it. The service is where I take issue. It might have been the worse service I've ever experienced. Our waitress was inattentive the entire night. Our cocktails took an hour to come. She forgot what we ordered despite writing something down when we placed our order. Billing was another fiasco that could've been rectified easily but was not handled well at all. Needless to say it won't be a place we'll be revisiting anytime soon.",1.0

Folks, if you don't have a spicy marking on the menu, at least mention the chiles in the description.  Crepe was fine though the described components that were to be within were limited at best. 1, possible 2 shrimp (overcooked, rubbery, tough to eat)...it wasn't a winner.The real issue for us came with the entrees.  It was a solid 15 minutes after the end of the crepe was cleared and my kids were starting to get restless. I asked the waiter how much longer it would be and reminded him of our original directive. At this point, he went over to the kitchen, and their incredibly nonchalant pace did not in anyway seem to increase over news that one of the few diners (there were maybe 3 or 4 tables filled at the time) was in quick need of service. Slow to the point of being lackadaisical, there were 4 or 5 chefs back there and 3 continued to do mise en place level prep while one continued to train another. Our meal was nowhere in sight and the kitchen just seemed nonplussed.We finally had to ask for our entrees to go, clay pot chicken sight unseen, noodles finally arrived (overcooked, they now had the texture of tires) and went nearly immediately into a box another 15 minutes later.  The chicken upon inspection when we returned home was literally 1/2 a pint of food. 1/2 A PINT.  This restaurant is on the pricey side for the neighborhood and well, we weren't impressed.The manager did try to make up for it by throwing in a tapioca dessert (nice dish), but guess what? He should have comped that chicken dish. Also, the waitstaff all had a very disconcerting habit of continually sweeping both under us and even on our table while we were eating.  I recognize that my kids were dropping things but you know, this is Park Slope and that's going to happen for the folks that come in early.  Please don't make me any more uncomfortable about being in a restaurant with my kids than I already am.  If you can't bring the food out quickly when asked or advise of any seriously spicy fare (or charge more reasonable prices for tiny quantities of food), at least try not to make me feel like we are a family of ogres while dining in your restaurant.  My kids were incredibly well behaved considering the circumstances and well, I did felt they could have done more to make up for the hiccup in timing.  Would we return?  When we've got free babysitting and can enjoy a long, lingering meal, perhaps.  I still would have been annoyed to wait nearly a total of 30 minutes between my last appetizer and the main course, though, so it's something they clearly need to work out.  Overall, it's a good addition to the neighborhood that I sincerely hope will improve.",3.0
Went here last week with my dad. We had both read about this place in the daily news and had heard great things. I went in with high expectations and for the most part they were met. The food was very good. For an appetizer we started with the ribs which were very tasty. For our main dishes we split the unshaken beef and the cha ca la vong which is Atlantic cod. We also had a side of the water spinach. All three were very good but the beef was the standout for sure. The service was impeccable. Our waiter was super nice and attentive without disturbing us. The only thing keeping it from a 5 star rating in my opinion was the seating situation. The place is small and the tables were very close to one another. I kind of felt like the people sitting next to us were in our conversation.,4.0
"i'm glad this isn't far from a friend's place. i've been wanting to come here for months and this was the perfect excuse for it hahaha.we came on a hurricane friday night around 7pm (we made reservations in advance of course). it was quiet when we arrived and shortly after around 7:30 we were looking at a full house. the decor was eclectic. exposed brick walls, repurposed found objects such as books, chandeliers and event some retrofitted televisions in the bathroom. i loved it. oh and the open air exposed kitchen allows you to see, smell and hear what they kitchen is up to.the food was definitely a twist on what i am accustomed to eating when it comes to vietnamese food. we ordered the snacks of the nom nom beef and the pig ears and they were tasty, especially the nom nom beef ( i would describe it as paper thin sheets similar to seaweed but it has the taste and flavor of chinese beef jerky).for appetizers we had the imperial roll, spring roll and a vegetarian salad (i believe it was vegetarian). all were delicious, light and surprisingly filing.on to the main course, we had the pork chop which was different on the take of a regular vietnamese pork chop because the cut was double the size of the vietnamese version and the watercress salad was a great accompaniment. we also had the special of cod over vermicelli, the cod was very light in flavor but the dressing in the vermicelli noodles was the key in the dish.i like how the ingredients are locally bought and they know where everything comes fromoverall i'd definitely be back to try the rest of the menu.",5.0
"I am won over. I went with two friends, one vegetarian, and every bite was delicious. We had:-- fresh vegetarian summer rolls - I didn't really understand the appeal of summer rolls... and then I ate these. The rice noodle portion of this blew my mind. This is not normally a thing that happens. What's the big deal, it's just rice noodle, right? Wrong. The texture and stickiness was just so satisfying. Also, evidently they grow their own mint and you can tell - so fresh and tasty. I loved the peanut sauce's taste, but found it to be a little thick. Hardly a real gripe. -- imperial rolls - I basically made these my main meal, and I'm extremely glad I did. Photo here: instagram.com/p/0OzsLhsc…-- chicken wings with sriracha butter sauce - I've never really been attracted to chicken wings. These were yummy enough, but not my favorite - not sure if it's because of my general chicken wing ambivalence or because they were just mediocre. Nicely fried and the sauce was excellent, so I suspect it's the former.-- green papaya salad - SO good. We were sopping up the sauce at the end - one of us threatened to lick the plate and I refuse to divulge whom. -- the side veg of broccoli/romanesco with preserved lemon - Again, licking the bowl is a thing that happened. I was making sure to cover every bite of (still crisp, thoroughly not grossly mushy) vegetable with liberal pieces of the lemon. I think the table went silent during this one.-- banh canh noodles - I was shocked by how much I ADORED these. This is a menu item I wouldn't ever think to order on my own. Considering it was my vegetarian dining companion's main meal, a LOT of this dish ended up in me. I was an unrepentant thief. Craving again today - the sauce was addictive and the  noodles again had that amazing fresh texture thing going on.I'm really regretting not having taken a photo of the cocktail menu. I can't remember what we each had, but we got three cocktails and they were all stellar. My friend Milk and Honeyed it - asked for a drink featuring mezcal that wouldn't be sweet and got some fabulous concoction that I adored. Mine had Old Tom gin, lavender bitters, and some other things that all added up to a magical combination that I will be wanting a lot when summer finally thoroughly arrives. The chefs are alumni of Slanted Door in SF, one of my favorite restaurants, and it shows. Can't wait to come back. Be aware, the neighborhood knows about this place - the only Saturday reservation we could land a week beforehand was at 5pm and it was PACKED when we were there.Also, for the parents - there were lots of parents in the restaurant during our 5pm dinner with happy-looking kids. Looks to be super child-friendly.Oof, WHY did a do a whole rundown of every bite when I'm hungry? Now I want to go back. Right now.",5.0

Also, the waitstaff all had a very disconcerting habit of continually sweeping both under us and even on our table while we were eating.  I recognize that my kids were dropping things but you know, this is Park Slope and that's going to happen for the folks that come in early.  Please don't make me any more uncomfortable about being in a restaurant with my kids than I already am.  If you can't bring the food out quickly when asked or advise of any seriously spicy fare (or charge more reasonable prices for tiny quantities of food), at least try not to make me feel like we are a family of ogres while dining in your restaurant.  My kids were incredibly well behaved considering the circumstances and well, I did felt they could have done more to make up for the hiccup in timing.  Would we return?  When we've got free babysitting and can enjoy a long, lingering meal, perhaps.  I still would have been annoyed to wait nearly a total of 30 minutes between my last appetizer and the main course, though, so it's something they clearly need to work out.  Overall, it's a good addition to the neighborhood that I sincerely hope will improve.",3.0
Went here last week with my dad. We had both read about this place in the daily news and had heard great things. I went in with high expectations and for the most part they were met. The food was very good. For an appetizer we started with the ribs which were very tasty. For our main dishes we split the unshaken beef and the cha ca la vong which is Atlantic cod. We also had a side of the water spinach. All three were very good but the beef was the standout for sure. The service was impeccable. Our waiter was super nice and attentive without disturbing us. The only thing keeping it from a 5 star rating in my opinion was the seating situation. The place is small and the tables were very close to one another. I kind of felt like the people sitting next to us were in our conversation.,4.0
"i'm glad this isn't far from a friend's place. i've been wanting to come here for months and this was the perfect excuse for it hahaha.we came on a hurricane friday night around 7pm (we made reservations in advance of course). it was quiet when we arrived and shortly after around 7:30 we were looking at a full house. the decor was eclectic. exposed brick walls, repurposed found objects such as books, chandeliers and event some retrofitted televisions in the bathroom. i loved it. oh and the open air exposed kitchen allows you to see, smell and hear what they kitchen is up to.the food was definitely a twist on what i am accustomed to eating when it comes to vietnamese food. we ordered the snacks of the nom nom beef and the pig ears and they were tasty, especially the nom nom beef ( i would describe it as paper thin sheets similar to seaweed but it has the taste and flavor of chinese beef jerky).for appetizers we had the imperial roll, spring roll and a vegetarian salad (i believe it was vegetarian). all were delicious, light and surprisingly filing.on to the main course, we had the pork chop which was different on the take of a regular vietnamese pork chop because the cut was double the size of the vietnamese version and the watercress salad was a great accompaniment. we also had the special of cod over vermicelli, the cod was very light in flavor but the dressing in the vermicelli noodles was the key in the dish.i like how the ingredients are locally bought and they know where everything comes fromoverall i'd definitely be back to try the rest of the menu.",5.0
"I am won over. I went with two friends, one vegetarian, and every bite was delicious. We had:-- fresh vegetarian summer rolls - I didn't really understand the appeal of summer rolls... and then I ate these. The rice noodle portion of this blew my mind. This is not normally a thing that happens. What's the big deal, it's just rice noodle, right? Wrong. The texture and stickiness was just so satisfying. Also, evidently they grow their own mint and you can tell - so fresh and tasty. I loved the peanut sauce's taste, but found it to be a little thick. Hardly a real gripe. -- imperial rolls - I basically made these my main meal, and I'm extremely glad I did. Photo here: instagram.com/p/0OzsLhsc…-- chicken wings with sriracha butter sauce - I've never really been attracted to chicken wings. These were yummy enough, but not my favorite - not sure if it's because of my general chicken wing ambivalence or because they were just mediocre. Nicely fried and the sauce was excellent, so I suspect it's the former.-- green papaya salad - SO good. We were sopping up the sauce at the end - one of us threatened to lick the plate and I refuse to divulge whom. -- the side veg of broccoli/romanesco with preserved lemon - Again, licking the bowl is a thing that happened. I was making sure to cover every bite of (still crisp, thoroughly not grossly mushy) vegetable with liberal pieces of the lemon. I think the table went silent during this one.-- banh canh noodles - I was shocked by how much I ADORED these. This is a menu item I wouldn't ever think to order on my own. Considering it was my vegetarian dining companion's main meal, a LOT of this dish ended up in me. I was an unrepentant thief. Craving again today - the sauce was addictive and the  noodles again had that amazing fresh texture thing going on.I'm really regretting not having taken a photo of the cocktail menu. I can't remember what we each had, but we got three cocktails and they were all stellar. My friend Milk and Honeyed it - asked for a drink featuring mezcal that wouldn't be sweet and got some fabulous concoction that I adored. Mine had Old Tom gin, lavender bitters, and some other things that all added up to a magical combination that I will be wanting a lot when summer finally thoroughly arrives. The chefs are alumni of Slanted Door in SF, one of my favorite restaurants, and it shows. Can't wait to come back. Be aware, the neighborhood knows about this place - the only Saturday reservation we could land a week beforehand was at 5pm and it was PACKED when we were there.Also, for the parents - there were lots of parents in the restaurant during our 5pm dinner with happy-looking kids. Looks to be super child-friendly.Oof, WHY did a do a whole rundown of every bite when I'm hungry? Now I want to go back. Right now.",5.0
"My mouth was bored and all I kept thinking was how did this place get so many great reviews? My friend and I split the Sriracha Wings, the Fresh Summer Rolls, Green Papaya Salad and the Banh Canh noodles. The rolls and wings were completely boring and devoid of any significant flavor. The sauce they both came with was meh. The salad was fine and the Banh Canh was tasty, but for $18 was seriously overpriced and not worth it at all. Our total bill with a glass of wine was $70 not including tip. Once we finished our meal I immediately knew there was no reason to ever go back. Save yourself the trip and head to your local cheap Vietnamese restaurant, which is likely to be a lot better.",2.0
"Attention Pork Sloppers.  No to fusion in general, in my opinion, but c'mon happy people.

"I don't know if I would call this a Gastropub but it is a very good Vietnamese restaurant that serves excellent cocktails.It is situated in the heart of the energetic 5th Avenue stretch of Park Slope, in the former ""Fish Camp"" space (7th Avenue is now a tundra of empty storefronts, real estate offices, bad chinese restaurants and big box franchise stores - due to unbridled landlord greed, but I digress).  It's tiny and crowded, but the staff is super friendly and chill which helps a lot.We started out at the bar, having arrived a bit early, and had some dilectible drinks, which we enjoyed while sitting on some wooden stools.  It was nice that there were some available stools -- much better than standing around getting jostled - but after all, it was 10 PM!  And yet the place was completely busy and bustling.  Despite that, the Bartender was attentive, capable and casual.  Tats, vest, beard, earring, on the cusp, LOL.  I liked him.After not too long of a wait, we were seated and welcomed by a very cheery waiter.  The dining area is small and the tables are packed tightly together but we had the back corner of the room which made it nice and private.  The decor is brick and bric-a-brac with an open kitchen overlooking the tables.The menu is short and sweet  - just 8 appetizers and maybe 6 entrees, as I recall.   We decided on this first visit, and keeping in mind the late hour, to sample just the appetizers.   We ordered the crispy pork and shrimp roll which you wrap in mint and lettuce leaves and dip in fish sauce - perfection! - the vegetable and oyster crepe, a bit greasy for me but Kim adored it, the spare ribs in Peking sauce (I think) which were tender and flavorful, and the beet salad with watercress, red onions, grapefruit and sesame candied walnuts,which was simply outstanding .  It was all great and filled us up nicely.  Definitely worth another visit.",5.0
"Where do I start. My mother in law was in town and wanted to try some high end Vietnamese food. We came in with my husband and my 2 year old daughter. At first glance the restaurant has a very elegant sleek and woodsy look, with wooden rustic tables, an open style kitchen and lovely chandeliers. Very modern/elegant. Would probably do better in Williamsburg. It is super baby and kid friendly which I love. Prices are on the higher end. We had cauliflower  and Brussels sprouts appetizers as well as steamed veggies. For entrees we had their chicken sauté with rice, their skirt cut steak filet and fish. I loved the fish and my husband loved the chicken. The beef is just ok, because the cut is a cheap cut of meat  but the price isn't cheap at all! We also had a light tapioca pudding for desert which was light and very good. I don't know if I would revisit the place but we had a good experience.",4.0
"So glad to have this place in the neighborhood. Cocktail geek worthy libations plus fantastic food make it a definite repeat visit. There were plenty of great looking drinks on the menu. I started with the Gee-G Boy, being a sucker for Old Tom gin and ginger. The wine list was well organized by flavor profile. I don't know enough about wine to comment so I'll just say the red I had with dinner was excellent. My date and I shared the Imperial Rolls, the banh xeo, a green papaya salad, the sriracha butter wings, and the un-shaking beef. Everything was excellent with the rolls being a particular highlight. Next time I think we may try the bar former cocktails and small plates to change it up (and get a bit deeper into that cocktail menu, I need to try the Goodnight Vietnam!).

Overall, we loved it! But both of my dining companions complained that it was a little loud. Also the music selection seemed incongruous with the setting. And one last little complaint - while our original waiter, a guy, was awesome, there was one female server who kept on coming over and kind of looming over us in a strange way.

Summer rolls are summer rolls - taste the same as other places, so if recommend ordering what's new!PS they have high chairs and kindly welcomed our two year old on our first visit (went without him the second).

All the meat in the sandwiches was overlooked and chewy, a real disservice to duck in particular. The imperial rolls were the best. The beef tendon soup was very spicy and oily from the tendon.

We did it family style and ended io order a few different appetizers and entrees. The  butter wings and the imperial spring rolls were Delicious. The cod was my favorite entree.

Dessert- the two item dessert menu did not satisfy my sweet tooth as they only had a chocolate molten cake with blue cheese which and a tapioca , neither sounded appealing so no one at the table ordered dessert which I was a little disappointed with.

"We went on a warm summer evening and the backyard was just perfect for our party. We had two kids with us and they were great with them, bringing them Wiki Stix and being attentive to what kids like. The back yard is lush with some sweet touches. I felt like it was an oasis. There are few venues like that. We booked about a week in advance since we knew we had so many people. The service was friendly and on top of it! We were well taken care of, which made it felt like a special night out. It's a quality place with the details handled. My experience was worth the money. I have easily spent more at places I'm less thrilled with. I'm excited there's Asian food that is high end and I'm impressed with their creativity. You can taste the difference because it's quality food. We got a drinks with nom nom beef chips. OMG those are divine and I can't stop eating them. We tried their special Red Boat cocktail, which is made with fish sauce. I know! Not what you think for a drink, but it was an adventuresome choice that was worth it. I also got the ginger drink... it looked bright orange, but it wasn't as sweet as it looked. I like them dry and this was just right. We got the chicken wings and asked for more sriracha butter, cause everything is better with more sriracha butter. Those were devoured. It was a generous serving. In fact everything we ordered was a generous serving. The hand made noodles were amazing. I loved the Claypot Chicken and the Cha Ca La Vong. We ordered almost everything on the menu, and it was all fresh and lovely.It was a special treat and it was fun to also watch the chef's at work. It's an approachable, adventurous, and quality experience. I would highly recommend going to Bricolage and making an evening of it.",5.0
Food was fantastic!  Service was excellent!  Ambiance was great!  The siracha butter chicken wings are amazing!  I'm still dreaming about that siracha butter.  They really elevated  Asian cuisine here.  I love their spin on all the different cocktails too.  I will definitely be returning soon and telling everyone I know to come here!,5.0
"So we arrive at this place. I was really excited to try the food with my bf. The HORRIBLE hostess doesn't even acknowledge us. So I ask her if she can seat us. She tells us please give me a few minutes she is busy . Apparently it's impossible for this idiot to greet new customers. After waiting another 10 minutes, I ask her again if she can seat us. She tells us it will be at least a 45 min wait. Why would you make new customers who can recommend or do opposite with this place? Who hired this awful person . She gave us such a bad impression. I have actually never encountered such a ln incompetent hostess. It's her job to be friendly & make customers feel welcome .",1.0
"We LOVED this restaurant, every single dish we ordered. We had the (non-veg) summer rolls, Vietnamese crepes, clay pot chicken, papaya salad, and beef chips.

"Had dinner last night here and loved everything about it. Every dish was well prepared, very high quality food and very tasty.  The service was great and the space very comfortable.

The best meal in ages. Better than the hype. I'm always disappointed but not this time. Did you know watercress could be an epiphany? Every bite was perfection: I could eat the grilled eggplant salad and the crispy imperial red every day. The u shaking beef is outstanding (that's where you find the water cress along with grilled scallions). The Ambassador and the Thai Basel Gimlet were both terrific.

"We went on a warm summer evening and the backyard was just perfect for our party. We had two kids with us and they were great with them, bringing them Wiki Stix and being attentive to what kids like. The back yard is lush with some sweet touches. I felt like it was an oasis. There are few venues like that. We booked about a week in advance since we knew we had so many people. The service was friendly and on top of it! We were well taken care of, which made it felt like a special night out. It's a quality place with the details handled. My experience was worth the money. I have easily spent more at places I'm less thrilled with. I'm excited there's Asian food that is high end and I'm impressed with their creativity.

"We had an incredibly delicious birthday date here recently. Everything was great but the crepe, steak, and whole fish were standouts. My husband decided to splurge and get the higher-priced wine accompaniment and each wine was an unusual but perfect choice for the food. As a bonus, at the end of the meal you receive a list of the wines you've had so you can track down your favorites.

"Read about this new joint in Eater and in wanting to spend Valentine's Day in my partner's old Brooklyn hood, we trained over from the East Village.

From the very moment of walking in and being warmly greeted at the door and immediately seated - we went early on purpose!! - the evening was a success. The room is comfortable with an open kitchen along one edge of the dining room allowing us to watch our food being made. We sampled generously of the starters, ordering much of the menu. Really happy with the ribs, a super fresh beet salad and a killer crepe (Killer Krepe?) or ""banh exo"" in the Vietnamese....and that would have been a descent meal just there, except we did no stop. A delicious pork rounded out the savory side.As yummy as dinner was the recommended dessert - a blue cheese inflected chocolate bomb cake was the evening's highlight. Wow!! So much fun to have something you've had a hundred times before be entirely reinvented for your pleasure.Really looking forward to trying this restaurant again...excited to see how it grows into itself.

"We went keen to see what was on offer after reading the reviews, and came away not overly impressed. The drinks menu had a good range of beers,  wine and cocktails but it was definitely on the pricey end; I thought $9 for a non alcoholic cocktail was pushing it given we're not in Manhattan. The menu is pretty small with no specials, but I think this is because it changes often. We had the vegetarian spring rolls and japanese eggplant salad as appetizers, both of which were the highlight of the meal. The spring rolls were a nice combination of ingredients along with the accompanying peanut sauce and the eggplant salad was an interesting mix of arugula, fried taro and eggplant. The portion size was also huge.For mains, we chose the beef, and had the pork ribs from the appetizer menu. The meat on the ribs was tough, and tasted like it had bottled bbq sauce blobbed on it just before serving and overall was underwhelming. The steak didn't fare much better; it was fatty and not a great piece of meat, and came with a lemon sauce that didn't do anything for it. Price wise the dish  was on a par with a steak joint at $35, but didn't compare. Don't think we'll be rushing to go back.",3.0

I can forgive the summer rolls being bland, because summer rolls are always bland, but the chicken wings were of the tiny, skin-and-bone variety, and maybe two minutes undercooked. Roast chicken entrée was also a little under, and the pork chop was merely ai'igh'.  Again, beautiful place, and a good wine list, but the food feels like an afterthought.",3.0
"Wonderful appetizers and main courses. We sampled almost everything on the menu.The steak is fine but is definitely not Vietnamese. The Vietnamese crepe is delicious, similar to the one you get at Bunker in Queens. Nevertheless, avoid the chocolate lava cake for dessert.

Avoid dessert!",4.0
"I'm extremely impressed with this place. It opened two weeks ago and my friend and i stumbled upon it, decided to stop. We got three small dishes and a side to share, tapas style and they just brought them out as they were ready. First we had the shrimp and pork rolls-fried to perfection and light. They bring out large lettuce leaves and you wrap the roll and dip in a fish sauce..SO good. Then the ribs-very tender and the sauce was hearty and delicious. Then the cauliflower and vegetarian crepe. Everything light and perfect, didn't feel violently full after. Our server (Adam) was super accommodating and split a glass of wine between me and my friend because we didn't want to drink much (I know, annoying but he didn't mind :D). Then we got the molten chocolate cake that has blue cheese inside and it was moist and amazing, and he brought us a glass of dessert wine. We met the owner, Miro who's also a visual artist and his art is hanging up in the restaurant so that was really unique and cool. Great atmosphere/decor and even better service.

"Bricolage was a fantastic experienced. I was not wowed by the food, but it was good by Asian-food-in-Brooklyn standards. Unfortunately, the papaya salad left me wanting to hop on the subway and go to Ayada in Queens (why the celery, guys?) and the fresh rolls, with their intriguing addition of pork belly, were good, but not great. The pork belly was not very flavorful and didn't add anything surprising texture-wise, but the peanut dipping sauce was wonderful. The thing that I would probably venture out into the cold for again was the Vietnamese crepe. The fish sauce really made it wonderful, but, again, I could do without the pork, which was sinewy and unseasoned. Despite the somewhat underwhelming food (only somewhat!), the service was wonderful. It was my dad's birthday and three different people came over and wished him a happy birthday and they event brought out a complimentary dessert (their chocolate gorgonzola lava cake, which was delicious)! The decor is also great, even if haphazardly put together in places (the TVs in the bathroom weren't my favorite). I loved the use of old, woven chair backs as lamp shades. Very good experience overall :)",4.0
"Here is what is great about Bricolage:  EVERYTHING. Let's start with the food.  It is, without exception, delicious.  The food has a complexity that does not overshadow flavor.  It's the kind of menu that presents a dilemma that every dinner should have: do i order the outstanding dish i previously had or do i try one if the many other options on the menu, all of which look they they could be my favorites.On to the cocktails: outstanding and sophisticated.  They compete with the best I have had.  The bartenders are super nice too. The staff: Exceptional.  Everyone was helpful and so friendly in a genuine way (and i was there when the place was packed) . The decor /vibe:  The place is beautiful and cool without being aggressively hip.  It's warm and inviting and full of a slightly frenetic energy that is fun and not harried . Spend some time gazing at the handmade lighting fixtures and taking in the art.  Also, don't forget to look above the sink in the bathroom -- you'll see a small selection of vintage t.v.'s all playing different static patterns.  Delightful!Brocolage is a true gem and a much-welcomed addition to the neighborhood.  I'll be back again and again.",5.0
"We have been to Bricolage twice since it recently opened and really love having it in the neighborhood.

"As a huge fan of The Slanted Door in San Francisco, I felt like I should set my expectations low for my first visit to Bricolage.  Turns out that was totally unnecessary.  Everything from the cocktails and wine to the service and especially the food was spot on.  The ""Unshaking Beef"" was only slightly different but just as delicious as SD's Shaking Beef.  My husband loves SD's Summer Rolls and they were spot on here.  We loved every dish we tried.  We rarely order dessert but did so on this visit and were very pleased.  The cocktails were tasty and the wine list is great, well matched to the food.  The very knowledgeable and friendly staff made our night.  We will return - frequently!",5.0
"Most amazing cocktails and mouth watering food.  Solid 100% of the time.  Everyone there is just the nicest most gentle souls too.  I love love love the summer rolls, the vegetarian summer rolls are without doubt the best I've ever experienced.  The peanut sauce - yum.  The banh xeo crepes (both), the unshaken beef, eggplant, it's ALL good.  Reasonable priced for the quality of the food, service and experience.  Kudo's and welcome to the hood.",5.0
"Went for the first time with my family for my birthday.  The chicken wings with sriracha sauce, the summer rolls, Vietnamese crepe and Beef La Lot were all delicious!  The only suggestion I have is that an additional plate would be helpful to put together the Beef La Lot, the vegetables and herbs in the softened rice paper.  There were also vegatarian and gluten-free options.  The ambience was excellent, very trendy, and the back garden was beautiful with so much greenery!  Highly recommend this resto and would definitely go back!",4.0
"Came here with my pregnant wife for dinner. I live in Park Slope so I am used to and have no problem over paying for services.. It comes with the territory. But one thing left a bad taste in my mouth. This restaurant offers two ""mocktails"" on their menu and both are priced at $9. And these are the ONLY mocktail options. What could possibly go in to a ""mocktail"" to make it cost so much and why would you even bother putting that much effort in to it. AND it is served in a small high ball glass so you get about 4 big sips of drink. WTF?! Serve a sparkling lemonade with a splash of juice and throw a mint in it and charge four or five bucks like every other place in Brooklyn. 9 bucks?!?!",2.0
"In two visits to Bricolage, I've found the food to be generally quite good (although with some unevenness in the same dishes between visits, which was noticeable because I'm vegetarian and so don't have many options here).  Unfortunately, the service leaves a lot to be desired and means that I won't be dining here in the future.  The most recent trip was a disaster: my mother cut her hand on something sharp protruding from the bathroom door; a request to do something to commemorate my mother's 70th birthday (made well in advance and confirmed the day before our visit) was completely ignored (they did nothing for her); and there was serious incompetence in handling our vegetarianism (one dish came out with the wrong sauce, another was announced as having the wrong sauce so had to be returned to the kitchen, ordering one dish took three separate interactions).  To make matters worse, when I emailed the restaurant's chef/owner to alert him to my concerns, his response was largely to blame the fact that our waitress was new, ignoring the fact that I had spoken to the front of the house staff about the birthday and two of the three issues with our vegetarianism were related to other staff.  Throwing one's own staff under the bus is a particularly dismaying trait, and not one that I want to support.  The fact that he promised that he was ""personally addressing"" the door that cut my mother was probably meant to be reassuring but that too backfired, given that he was emailing me more than 24 hours after the episode - if a guest ends up bleeding all over one's restaurant, I would hope for a little more urgency in investigating the cause of the problem!  All in all, I wish that I could support this place but will be taking my business elsewhere.",1.0

Let's start with the food.  It is, without exception, delicious.  The food has a complexity that does not overshadow flavor.  It's the kind of menu that presents a dilemma that every dinner should have: do i order the outstanding dish i previously had or do i try one if the many other options on the menu, all of which look they they could be my favorites.On to the cocktails: outstanding and sophisticated.  They compete with the best I have had.  The bartenders are super nice too. The staff: Exceptional.  Everyone was helpful and so friendly in a genuine way (and i was there when the place was packed) . The decor /vibe:  The place is beautiful and cool without being aggressively hip.  It's warm and inviting and full of a slightly frenetic energy that is fun and not harried . Spend some time gazing at the handmade lighting fixtures and taking in the art.  Also, don't forget to look above the sink in the bathroom -- you'll see a small selection of vintage t.v.'s all playing different static patterns.  Delightful!Brocolage is a true gem and a much-welcomed addition to the neighborhood.  I'll be back again and again.",5.0
"We have been to Bricolage twice since it recently opened and really love having it in the neighborhood. We have tried several of the small plates and enjoyed them all, and the Banh Canh noodles are awesome. But the item we love and crave the most is the chocolate cake with blue cheese on the dessert menu.",5.0
"As a huge fan of The Slanted Door in San Francisco, I felt like I should set my expectations low for my first visit to Bricolage.  Turns out that was totally unnecessary.  Everything from the cocktails and wine to the service and especially the food was spot on.  The ""Unshaking Beef"" was only slightly different but just as delicious as SD's Shaking Beef.  My husband loves SD's Summer Rolls and they were spot on here.  We loved every dish we tried.  We rarely order dessert but did so on this visit and were very pleased.  The cocktails were tasty and the wine list is great, well matched to the food.  The very knowledgeable and friendly staff made our night.  We will return - frequently!",5.0
"Most amazing cocktails and mouth watering food.  Solid 100% of the time.  Everyone there is just the nicest most gentle souls too.  I love love love the summer rolls, the vegetarian summer rolls are without doubt the best I've ever experienced.  The peanut sauce - yum.  The banh xeo crepes (both), the unshaken beef, eggplant, it's ALL good.  Reasonable priced for the quality of the food, service and experience.  Kudo's and welcome to the hood.",5.0
"Went for the first time with my family for my birthday.  The chicken wings with sriracha sauce, the summer rolls, Vietnamese crepe and Beef La Lot were all delicious!  The only suggestion I have is that an additional plate would be helpful to put together the Beef La Lot, the vegetables and herbs in the softened rice paper.  There were also vegatarian and gluten-free options.  The ambience was excellent, very trendy, and the back garden was beautiful with so much greenery!  Highly recommend this resto and would definitely go back!",4.0
"Came here with my pregnant wife for dinner. I live in Park Slope so I am used to and have no problem over paying for services.. It comes with the territory. But one thing left a bad taste in my mouth. This restaurant offers two ""mocktails"" on their menu and both are priced at $9. And these are the ONLY mocktail options. What could possibly go in to a ""mocktail"" to make it cost so much and why would you even bother putting that much effort in to it. AND it is served in a small high ball glass so you get about 4 big sips of drink. WTF?! Serve a sparkling lemonade with a splash of juice and throw a mint in it and charge four or five bucks like every other place in Brooklyn. 9 bucks?!?!",2.0
"In two visits to Bricolage, I've found the food to be generally quite good (although with some unevenness in the same dishes between visits, which was noticeable because I'm vegetarian and so don't have many options here).  Unfortunately, the service leaves a lot to be desired and means that I won't be dining here in the future.  The most recent trip was a disaster: my mother cut her hand on something sharp protruding from the bathroom door; a request to do something to commemorate my mother's 70th birthday (made well in advance and confirmed the day before our visit) was completely ignored (they did nothing for her); and there was serious incompetence in handling our vegetarianism (one dish came out with the wrong sauce, another was announced as having the wrong sauce so had to be returned to the kitchen, ordering one dish took three separate interactions).  To make matters worse, when I emailed the restaurant's chef/owner to alert him to my concerns, his response was largely to blame the fact that our waitress was new, ignoring the fact that I had spoken to the front of the house staff about the birthday and two of the three issues with our vegetarianism were related to other staff.  Throwing one's own staff under the bus is a particularly dismaying trait, and not one that I want to support.  The fact that he promised that he was ""personally addressing"" the door that cut my mother was probably meant to be reassuring but that too backfired, given that he was emailing me more than 24 hours after the episode - if a guest ends up bleeding all over one's restaurant, I would hope for a little more urgency in investigating the cause of the problem!  All in all, I wish that I could support this place but will be taking my business elsewhere.",1.0
"Immediately loses at star for the terrible music playing WAY TOO LOUD. The music was unoriginal and did not at all reflect the atmosphere. It was top 40 radio crap and at a volume that requires you talk very loudly.  Why, NY, Why do you think people like to eat with blasting music?Had a reservation and was seated 25 minutes late after they assured it was only going to be 15, so if you're on a tight schedule, plan accordingly. And the bar was packed so there was no comfortable place to wait.Staff are all very pleasant. Food was fantastic. Even the mundane Summer roll was better than most because it was so fresh and the peanut sauce was delicious. I'd go back again but for the first seating of the night so it wouldn't be so crowded and loud. If loud is not your thing at all, try Miti Miti one block over - they know how to do music. Fun, 80's but purely background music.",4.0
"Very good. Cod perfectly cooked. Sincere and helpful service. Best Vietnamese by far in the neighborhood, and reasonably priced for the quality.",5.0
"This place is a hidden gem! My husband and I live in the neighborhood and we've probably walked past it a hundred times! We finally dined here tonight and we had an amazing experience. First of all the decor and ambience of the restaurant is amazing! If you have the chance, sit outside in the patio (yes, even the patio is thoughtfully designed). We ordered the eggplant salad, siracha chicken wings and the chicken claypot with a side of pea shoots. They were all delicious!",4.0
"Kicking it up to 5 stars after another meal. Great summer cocktails, excellent summer rolls and crepes, and a new find with the claypot shrimp which had an outstandingly flavorful sauce. Order a side of rice just so you can sop up the last bit!",5.0

"I am from SF and have eaten at Slanted Door.  The same chefs made this place and it was perfect for what we were looking for.  We wanted delicious food, and outdoor garden to spend the evening outside, good cocktails...this place had all of them.  The hosts and staff were very friendly and they did not rush us through dinner.  The prices were reasonable and the portions sizes were the right size in terms of being able to split appetizers and entrees between two people.  For food, the pork and vegeterian crepe were excellent but we are excited to try the rest.  We hope this places stays for good.",5.0
"Fantastic cozy dining space. The food was outstanding - everything was fresh and perfectly prepared. The SF smash was great.  We had the arctic char, the vegetarian spring roll, the green papaya salad, the cod with peanut sauce on vermicelli.  I can't wait to go again!",5.0
"We thoroghly enjoyed ourexperience at Bricolage. It would be great if it were a bit less pricey, but the food and drinks were top notch, and the chefs are alums of the very highly regarded Slatted Door in San Francisco, which is booked months in advance. We went on a weekday night, on the early side, and were lucky to score a lovely tables outside in the back, and thus managed to avoid the somewhat noisy interior (but we are well over 50, so take that for what it is). The summer rolls were very good, but everything that followed was outstanding -- the papaya salad, banh canh noodles, the whole cooked Branzano, the cod, and the cocktails were awesome. The wait staff was  very friendly and knowledgeable, and justifiably proud of the place. Be sure to get reservations, as this place is very popular, and deservedly so.",5.0

This past Friday evening I was there with a party of four and as usual the cocktails and food were great. But I felt our server was rushing us to flip the table and this was noted by the whole table.

Highly recommended, solid five stars.",5.0
"Woohoo! As good as it gets!  That's what five stars mean.  We were able to find a couple of seats at the bar.  The bartenders were incredibly friendly and knowledgeable about the food.  We ordered five small dishes and each was amazingly unique and flavorful.  Each of our servers, including the chef for one of them, explained all of the ingredients in the dishes which included amazing tamarind flavored ribs and lovely beef carpaccio.  Our only regret was that we couldn't try everything else on the menu but that won't be a problem since we plan on returning often.",5.0
"We loved it! The atmosphere is fantastic, cozy and makes you feel like you've been transported. I look forward to the patio opening once the weather warms. We didn't wait for our reservation, was seated on time. Our selections were delish. Shared the summer rolls, green papaya salad, pork ribs and then the U shaking beef. I couldn't eat the beef med-rare as recommended due to medical reasons and they didn't hesitate. They prepared half the meet as the chef recommended and my half med-well, and it was tender and simply delicious. That was more than enough food for two. We shared the chocolate molten cake which was perfect. The cocktails looked beautiful however i couldn't try them, next time. We will be back! It's a fantastic neighborhood addition.",5.0
Wonderful food with great flavors. We loved every dish we had and the surprise hit of the night was dessert! The chocolate molten cake with blue cheese...I know it sounds crazy...was amazing!!!! Will definitely be going back many times. Look forward to checking out more on their menu!,5.0
"The experience was great from start to finish. Came on a rainy evening, right in prime time so there were no tables. Miro, the owner, found a way to make room for us at the bar. The bartender was awesome and I'm kicking myself for not remembering his name. He recommended the noodles, which I ordered upon his advice -- was sold on the fact they were hand made basically to order. And it paid off. I told Miro I don't want to eat noodles anywhere else.  :)",5.0

"I had my birthday party at Bricolage. It was my first time here, and everything was excellent.  Because of the size of our party, we emailed a couple weeks ago, and Kyle was responsive about the dinner and helped with the prefixe menu.  We had a couple last-minute changes to the reservation time and party size, and he was very accommodating.  The bartenders and servers were great, and they paced the courses and drinks well.  There were 14 of us, and we never felt rushed by the servers.  For the prefixe menu, you can order 3 appetizers, 1 side, 3 entrees, and 2 desserts (as well as unlimited rice).  We really liked the grilled eggplant salad, grilled pork chop, and shrimp claypot.  As others have noted, the portion size is fair and the prices are high, but we all felt full and satisfied after dinner.  There is also a fun outdoor seating area.  We would definitely go back to try some more of the signature cocktails and the items on the regular dinner menu but not the prefixe menu.",5.0
"A dining experience at Bricolage is like going to a spa for a day of pampering! I have dined at this wonderful restaurant many times since its February opening. The ambiance, food, service and attention to detail is stellar!  As a repeat customer I have to say that the staff, especially Lien who always attempts to greet customers table side and the manager, Kyle is so friendly, along with a terrific waiter/waitress staff and bartenders make you feel like ""family."" Part of the attraction of dining at Bricolage definitely is the people! The menu at Bricolage is exquisite and it is always difficult to decide what to order since everything is so DELICIOUS! Some outstanding choices are the summer rolls with peanut sauce.  I challenge anyone to find a better, more tasty peanut sauce anywhere! The ribs are succulent and juicy with a wonderful sauce.  The unshaking beef, the Branzino whole fish, the noodles, the vegetables especially the sugar snap peas, the beef chips and let's not forget the tapioca pudding are all AMAZING!!!!! This weekend I dined with my two nephews both who enjoyed the dining experience immensely! Their closing remark to me was, ""Aunt Hillary you kept raving about this restaurant so we knew it would be good, we just didn't imagine it would be this great and fabulous!"" A wonderful, memorable evening was had by all. Can't wait for my next dining experience at Bricolage.",5.0
"i went on a thursday night at 6:15p with 2 friends. made a reso on yelp in case since none of us had been there, but the place wasn't too full around then. by 7/7:30p it was completely filled, including the bar area. we were on a tight schedule to go to a show at BAM, so we decided to only order from the small plates menu. 1. papaya salad - light, tangy & delicious, flavors weren't overdone..it was blended quite nicely. 2. imperial spring rolls - crisp and really flavorful 3. crepe (the first option, not the second one, i can't remember what it was called) - super filled with bean sprouts, i would've liked to have more proteins inside. the crepe part was perfect but the huge amount of filling made it hard to pick up and wrap in the lettuce as recommended. i ate the 2nd half of mine with a fork. 4. chicken wings 5. ribs - both of these dishes were really carried by their sauces, the meat itself was fairly basic. staff was meticulous with cleaning our table and replacing our dishes. would definitely go again to try the entrees out of curiousity.",4.0
