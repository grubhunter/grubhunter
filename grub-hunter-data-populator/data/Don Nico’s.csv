"I got turned on to this little jewel by a good friend mine. She claimed that they made the best fish tacos she's ever had. Now I'm a big fish taco fan, and a bit of a cynic, so that was a bold statement that needed to be investigated.Back in the summer we had met there for lunch. There was a line: clue #1 the food was going to be good. The sitting area next to Don Nico's food truck was full; clue #2.  We both placed our order for fish tacos and two bottles of water (the girl in the cart was very pleasant).  $8? I'm also a big fan of a little money for big taste.Our names are called. It's taco time. Find a seat. Unwrap. And...Yeah. These are really, really good fish tacos. The fish, perfectly done.  A uniquely spicy cabbage concoction.  Avocado. The corn taco warm with just a very, very slight crispiness. My friend makes subtle noises of pleasure.  That's good too.Don Nico's became a regular lunch spot. Always with her. Always the fish tacos. Always just as good. Yesterday she left New York and moved to points south. The day before, we had our last lunch together. Yeah...fish tacos.I will miss her. But we'll always have Don Nico's.",5.0
"When shopping on Fulton Mall I usually stop at the (dreaded) Mickey's. I was happy on a previous visit when I found the hot dog king and even more so for this new find. It's supposed to be healthier right?The smell was really enticing and drew me to this cart/stand/food truck. I perused the menu and wanted to try tamales. Alas none. My second choice empanada was out of stock as well. I scored with my third choice of taco. I had the steak. It cost $7.00 for two reasonably sized ""rolls""  The cilantro was nice and fresh and added a nice zing. The guac (who could go wrong with that? No really who? Let me know so I can sue that bastard. I tasted onions and green sauce as well. Alone everything was good. But that was my hiccup. Everything was nice and fresh alone but I felt the flavours didn't blend together well. It was like a usually happy, wholesome family that weren't speaking to each other at that moment.  Maybe the steak could have been seasoned /marinated with the seasonings. I'm not sure as I'm not a Mecican food connoisseur and really should be giving zero recommendations. Maybe that's exactly what they were going for or MAYBE I'm too Trini and like my food too seasoned. Not spicy just seasoned. Overall their food tasted good and I'm sure once I'm hungry and this is an optional I'll have it again.The male and female staff were helpful, the truck clean. I'm not sure if the outdoor seating available is provided by the city or Don Nico's, but surrounding the food truck is a nice little cool down area where you can sit and have your meal, or gape at men as they walk past. Guys the ladies looks good too. They serve breakfast daily from 7:30 - 11am and ask about their daily specials and soup of the day.Eat both tacos the same day as I found out one day later that refrigerators aren't kind to tacos. The End.",4.0
"What they do best is their spices. Granted a chicken taco is tender and the tortilla is satisfying, by whatever they put in the guac is the real deal.",5.0
Loved it!    Simple fresh and innovative ingredients served up food truck style from an ex- shipping container.  Had fish and chicken tacos and a salad to share with my wife.   Friendly fast service and mmmmmmmm the tacos!!,5.0

"What a happy use of a sea container!Expect a 15-minute wait while your food is made to order. Plenty of seating around the milk-crate vertical gardens. The grilled fish tacos sell out quickly (before 1pm on a Tues!) so come to Albee Square early for more meat choices.Drink options- coffee, tea, water, jarritos sodas. $7 tacos, $9 burritos, $6 flautas, $8 tortas...All in all a great lunch option if you're in the neighborhood!",4.0

"After eating the chorizo quesadilla for lunch, I immediately laid down on the floor of my apartment and took a nap. I can't really explain why I didn't lay on the couch, or even the bed...but I don't think any quesadilla has ever done that to me before. So Don Nico's has that going for them. Other things they have going for them:1. Decently cheap, large portions of solid Mexican food. Not the best I've ever had and I personally think everything benefits from some hot sauce (I recommend Cholula), but good bang for the buck.2. A convenient Albee Square location. Mostly for me, because I don't live too far away. But also for you, because there's free Albee Square wi/fi, and you're surrounded by the Fulton Mall which can be good for...things. Sneakers, to be sure. 3. A sweet, colorful mural on the side of the stand that reads (in English and Spanish): BellyFull Heart HappyAin't that the truth.",4.0
"My review is for the Don nico's in Queens NY, downtown Jamaica which is their newly opened brick and mortar... I had the steak Torta...it was very good, soft bread tender beef, with spicy chipotle sauce. Will be back soon, as it is literally in my building... The staff was very friendly and made me feel welcome. Cool atmosphere and vibe...",5.0
"Authentic, fresh, delicious Mexican food to go. I went after the major lunch crowd had disappeared (around 2 pm) so the wait for my meal was only 5-8 minutes. The food was excellent. I tried the chicken burrito, which was packed with large pieces of tender pulled chicken, melted cheese, black beans, and rice. It was topped with sour cream and I got a side of guacamole. It was a huge burrito and came to only 9 dollars. What I loved most was that the fillings were not mixed into a paste where you couldn't taste quite what you were eating...this burrito was really exceptional. I doused it in hot sauce when I got home and I was in heaven.",4.0
"Don Nico's is a totally cute and random spot because it's surrounded by many retail shops and it truly stands out! A colleague of mine has been here a few times and have recommended it to me. I finally gave it a shot a few weeks ago. Just a 5-8 minute walk from my office and no lines when I went. I ordered the fish tacos which cost under $7.00.They gave me two fish tacos and it was really scrumptious! The fish taco was filled with grilled tilapia which might I add was very moist and delicious! There was also green cabbage, cilantro, onions, and guacomole in it. There was a little spice in the tacos but it wasn't too spicy. I really enjoyed the tacos!Although tacos aren't quite my favorite food, I must say the fish tacos I had from Don Nico's was great and I would come back again. My only complaint is that you don't have a choice between a soft or hard taco shell. I would prefer a hard taco shell for that crunch. Overall, a great little spot to check out if you want a quick Mexican or cheap fix.",4.0
"Yum! we only got a cheese quesadilla as they were out of almost every meat choice by 3:30pm on a Monday. Glad we stumbled upon this place. I'll have to remember to come earlier and try the flautas.

"Oh Don Nico's - how do I love thee? Let me count the tacos. So unfortunately, people have caught on to how awesome Don Nico's, a refurbished shipping crate, truly is.

Guacamole!) and my favorites include the tacos, chicken torta (big enough for two), the Pozole soup and the salads. After 12pm the lunch rush gets a little manic, but the wait is well worth it.",4.0

I feel so bad because I didn't take any picture of the place. But to start the restaurant is one of the prettiest in a Jamaica Ave! O love the California decoration!! The food is amazing!

Very hard to find here in Jamaica Ave. We used to live in SD where you found delicious tacos everywhere and Don nicos tacos are the closest to the original tacos.

"Downtown BK, a block from Juniors, Don Nico's Flautas is a small repurposed shipping cargo food stand. I used to come here once a week and always ordered the cheese flautas.

"So this ""stand"" has been sitting here for a little while now and I finally decided to give it a try.First visit: Ordered the chicken taco and fish taco- Tortias taste homemade, like they're actually made from maize- Chicken, grilled to perfection with the best guac I have EVER had- Shrimp, also grilled to its most flavorful point.Second visit:Grilled chicken torta- Chicken grilled to perfection, bread slightly warmed, other ingredients were okay, and THE GUAC sealed the deal.....yea, I think I'm addicted.Third visit:Coworkers and I ordered the chicken torta, chicken taco, and fish wrap- Fish wrap (with jalapenos) was very flavorful....I mean very- Chicken taco didn't disappoint.- Chicken torta was even better than the day before.The service is prompt, the prices are very reasonable, and the food is amazing. There tends to be a lunch rush between 11:30 and 12:45....but that's expected for food of this caliber. They have the coco cola in the old school glass bottles that's made in MEXICO. Do you know what that means? In Mexico, they use brown (natural, unbleached) sugar to make the cola while in the US, corn syrup (or other sugar substitutes) are used.

"This place is overpriced and not delicious.  They were out of steak and chicken.  I ordered the $9 vegetarian burrito, and though it had a lot of mushrooms, it was generally bland because there was no hot sauce nor any kind of spice to the very minimal beans and over represented white rice.  Tourist Trap.  Don't be fooled.  Go to Fast and Fresh Burrito on Hoyt Street between schemerhorn and atlantic for a much better, much more authentic experience.  There's a beautiful backyard in the back too, as opposed to Don Nicos where youre sitting in front of the new armani exchange and right on top of the subway vents.",2.0
