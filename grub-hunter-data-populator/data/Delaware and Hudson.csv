"Haha yeah the brunch here is amazing. The place next door has this heavy scene but I still don't understand why this restaurant wasn't packed the Saturday morning we came here--we pretty much just walked in at like 11:30 am with most of the tables open.Anyway I just want to commend this place on serving up an absurdly good meal when I was truly not in the mood for food and couldn't taste much of anything due to a cold. We started with the Scones and Biscuits, which were absolutely amazing. They were incredibly light and flaky and buttery, easily surpassing a lot of the bakeries in the area. The House-Smoked Pennsylvania Trout was also superb with this piercing smokiness and the French Toasted Pumpkin Bread Pudding was as sweet/decadent as the name implies. So I dunno, I am not really sure why this is not a insane popular brunch spot. I have to say in this area of Brooklyn it is one of the best brunch spots I've tried.",5.0
"Meh this place is way overrated. I arrived on a wet, snowy, weeknight with most tables empty. I had a reservation for two because I was worried about getting in. When I arrived, I was surprised I wasn't greeted at the door and I had to hang up my own coat. The staff was in the back of the restaurant chatting :-/The atmosphere was cool, warm and welcoming but very hot. I guess I figured because it was so cold outside they like the extreme temperature difference. I sat down and ordered a cocktail and waited for my friend to join me. Service was OK but not as good as I expected considering there was only one other table occupied the restaurant.The menu didn't thrill me, it was pre fixe which we were anticipating greatly. We had two cocktails and I left thinking wow I just spent $250 on a decent meal, but not a great meal. It definitely did not live up to the hype.  I suppose I feel cheated, I was so excited to have such an amazing meal and my expectations were so high. Plus my girlfriend came in from Manhattan, so I wanted to have her socks knocked off by a cool Brooklyn hot spot.",3.0
"Haven't heard of this place until I reached my end chapter of Michelin starred restaurant exploration journey, so decided to give it a try for their brunch menu. They seem to be going nuts for healthy food option and the only meat dish that looks attractive to me is the crab cake.We ordered the scone basket for share. It was soft, crunchy yet cold! I wish they could warm it up before bringing to our table...the poached egg on my crab cake was cooked just about the right level of hardness on the other hand, which was a plus. They don't offer skim milk as an option for coffee.Delaware and Hudson was very cosy and down-to-earth, so a casual friend gather-together would be the best occasion. I probably will give another try for their dinner course later into the year; but really hope there would be fewer misses.",4.0
"An amazing lunch at this 2016 Michelin Star awardee.Midwest food and interior with fine dining sensibilities.Ordered their play on Chicken & Waffles and added sides of Scrapple (sort of a sausage make with the odds and ends of a porker) and the Fried Cinnamon Donuts w/ Apple Compote. Fork tender shredded chicken and au jus, on top of delicate golden brown waffles. Simple beauty. The staff was gracious enough to allow me to sample some off the menu dessert items as they were prepping for supper.  I tried an amazing Black Bottom Cheesecake topped with kumquat and a Vanilla Custard Cookie topped with bruleed grapefruit, both finished with a Housemade butterscotch and white chocolate swirl.  Remarkable.",5.0
"Had brunch here and I quite enjoyed myself. It's right up there with Five Leaves but without the wait or line. I learned that it was a Michelin starred restaurant, so that's exciting. I'm sure people will discover this little gem soon enough.They have a great brunch menu...I'd definitely want to check it out for dinner some time.Food:-fresh donuts with apple compote - delicious, though the outside of the donuts were crunchy (in a good way) an scraped the roof of my mouth-crab cakes benedict - really I'm pretty sure it's just crab with poached eggs and hollandaise on it (amazingly crabby in the best possible way served atop arugula) - it was awesome...kept its shape without being completely breaded...yay more crab!-corned beef hash - light, but still hearty and delicious made with poached eggs (or however you like them)-coffee - good, served with sugar cubesTLDR: it's definitely worth checking this place out",5.0
"This is the most underwhelming meal I've had in 2016. Service was underwhelming to boot. Multiple dishes came out cold (when they were meant to be hot) and bland. Overall, the only thing that impressed us was the desserts (which were unbelievable). I wanted to like this place, but walked away poorer and seriously unimpressed.",2.0
"Love to go to this place during the week for business/client lunches. Very friendly staff and the menu always pleases.

"I'd been looking forward to visiting Delaware and Hudson after finding out that this restaurant had made it onto the list of 2015 Michelin Stars. The chef, Patti Jackson, has her roots in Northeastern Pennsylvania, and after following her passion in food (most recently in i Trulli and Centovini), decided to open up her own 38-seat restaurant in Williamsburg with a focus on regional American cuisine. Once the restaurant decided to launch brunch, I came by with a few friends on a Saturday afternoon to see what they had to offer.Delaware and Hudson blends seamlessly with the neighborhood. The space is charming yet minimalist, with two rows of tables at opposite sides of the interior and various farm-themed photographs hung on the walls. We were able to beat the brunch rush and were seated promptly at noon, but lines started to form later in the day - so be prepared.To begin, we split an order of the Scones & Biscuits. The basket that we were given had an assortment of the pastries which were, unfortunately, served cold. I did get to try an appropriately flaky biscuit and a lightly sweetened raisin scone, both of which went well with the house-made jam and butter served on the side. The temperature that they'd been served at, however, definitely detracted from the overall enjoyment of the order.The courses that followed were, unfortunately, not that much of an improvement. The ""Miss Rose's Baltimore Crab Cakes"" was the most tempting-sounding dish on the menu for me, but it consisted soley of two small crab cakes topped with two poached eggs on a meager bed of greens. While the crab cakes might have been tasty, the plate almost screamed for a carbohydrate component to help balance it out. What I did try of my friend's Pennsylvania Dutch Scrapple was mediocre at best; the scrapple had been unevenly cooked so that some parts had a nicely crisp texture while others bordered on mushy.Perhaps brunch is not the best meal to gauge the restaurant by, but it's nonetheless a fair chance to make an initial impression. I have heard that their dinner service offers a stronger meal, but until I make my way back to Williamsburg at night - three stars it is.",3.0
"Best meal my wife and I have had in a long time.Here's the thing: We've tried some Brooklyn farm-to-table style restaurants, and we'd always end up disappointed. Not enough flavor, not enough seasoning, not enough *cooking*. Add to that a certain superior attitude and some uncomfortable ""re-claimed"" furniture and you have the recipe for an unpleasant experience.Delaware and Hudson erased all those memories. It's nothing like that. First, it's the most comfortable, warm and welcoming oasis--playing alt-country style banjo music, not those terrible thumping beats at hip Manhattan restaurants that keep you on edge and eating fast. The waitstaff are just the right amount of friendly and provide warm, attentive service (even re-folding your napkin when you go to the bathroom). The tables are not packed too close together. Then, the menu, which consists of a big collection of small plates to share, a small pasta, an entree, and two desserts is served with a relaxed pace. You never wait too long and you never feel rushed. Everything is set except for the entree where you have a choice. We loved the menu format--it's the perfect combination of a tasting menu and a traditional menu and it's so much more affordable than other tasting menus.Now about the food: many people have said that the collection of small plates to share is the highlight of the meal. We disagree: while the small plates were mostly good (except for the green tomato pie whose crust felt underdone and whose filling doesn't live up to the fried version), it was the incredible, incredible fresh pasta that was the standout. After that, the entrees (a pork with lovely potatoes with bacon and a sea bass) were also fantastic. And then you get two dessert courses! Dining here is a truly pleasurable event.",5.0
"I've come here like four times with my boyfriend, and we've enjoyed our experience every single time! The first thing that made us want to come here is that they served scrapple--which is basically odds and ends of the pig, ground up and fried with a flour batter. I don't really go for it, but my boyfriend --a Pennsylvanian, really liked the fact that he could get a familiar food in Williamsburg. They have really good cold brew coffee, and I recently tried their blood orange iced tea which was also delicious! Their hot coffee is constantly refilled. Their scones and biscuits are great for sharing and they have homemade strawberry jam! They also have this delicious chocolate chip scone that I love.They also have really good side of potatoes that have these huge grains of salt, and are crispy and delightful. I'm not particular into potatoes, but I usually can't help myself to these.I've tried their crab cakes, corn mush and chicken pot pie here.The crab cake eggs Benedict ($16) is o-k. A bit too salty for my taste, and nothing extremely amazing--your typical brunch fare with crab cakes instead of English muffins. The eggs were perfectly poached, however, so a big star to that. Every time I've come here and had eggs--They've been poached perfectly. Just enough to hold in the yolk, but oozing upon breaking the skin.The corn mush ($12) was actually pretty delicious. I wanted to try something new yesterday when I went, so I went for the corn mush, which came with fricasseed mushrooms-which is salty and made up for the blandness of the mush. Slices of Parmesan cheese and two poached eggs. It was all delicious, though a bit lacking in a crunchy or hard texture, it was still very satisfactory.Chicken pot pie ($14): it came in a bowl! As an avid pot-pier, I was a bit disappointed when a bowl arrived at my table, containing what looked like a reduced chicken soup inside. The chicken was very tender, and to my surprise, there were pieces of ""dough""/""pie""/CARBSS!! inside the bowl! Essentially it was a deconstructed pie. It was also a bit salty for my taste, but I liked the pot pie. I just wish there was more of it, or that it came with a side of something to balance out the completely mushy texture of the meal. Also, some pieces of the dough was not completely cooked enough for my tastes, though the inside of the pot pie may have distracted me from seeing that it was completely cooked or not. Either way, I'll be retuning soon with an empty stomach and a happy attitude! Love this place.",5.0
"My friends and I accidentally stumbled upon this place when the previous two brunch places we attempted to go to had a 30+ minute wait time.

"My brother lured me out to Williamsburg with the promise of a second birthday dinner.  I had no idea where we were headed, but trusted his research.  He walked me around the corner and onto N. 5th St., where we walked up to the adorable storefront for the cozy Delaware and Hudson.  I had never heard of the place, but he had assured me that their nightly tasting menu format was receiving rave reviews, so I became excited.We were seated immediately, but the service plummeted from there.  The minuscule dining area had several servers and was about two-thirds full, but we were continually ignored or provided with insufficient details.  For example, when asked to describe a few wines on the list, our waitress possessed no background on them and had to scamper off after her colleagues, following them around to obtain adequate descriptions to give us.  We finally obtained our delicious and affordable bottle of 2010 Chateau Monconseil Gazin Bordeaux, but had based our selection on the modest information provided by another random waiter.   Also, I should mention that their alcoholic beverage options are limited to wine, beer, and cider.The menu experience began with several appetizers for the table to share.  We had little cups of a watery corn broth with pieces of popcorn inside of it.  Then, some bland spaghetti squash and boring corned beef.  There was also shad roe on toast and seasoned meatballs, both of which were more enticing.  A basket of pretzel rolls was also considered a starter, but we were thankfully able to request an additional basket at no cost.  Salty pretzel bread could always be such a fun treat!The next course allowed us to each have our own small plates of Potato Dumplings tossed with kale, Virginia ham, and gruyere cheese.  These plump pillows simply melted in our mouths.  The creamy sauce had a hint of smoke from the meat and an earthiness from the kale.  In fact, this was our favorite dish of the evening.The final savory course offered a choice of a meat, a seafood, or a vegetarian option.  I went with the Black Sea Bass, which was served with baby artichokes, potatoes, and lemon.  The fish was well cooked and flavorful, though it could have used some salt.  Its included sides were fantastic as well.  My brother had opted for the Braised Pork Shank, which was extremely fatty.  It was served with sweet and sour cabbage that was uninteresting, but also a delightful white bean puree.For dessert, a plate with a ""Happy Birthday"" greeting contained a flan and a chocolate cake, neither of which was that great.  Thankfully, we also received a plate of petit fours that were much sweeter.All in all, for such a well-regarded restaurant, we found the experience rather lackluster.  Unless faced with an extremely unique menu of the day, I doubt that I would go out to Williamsburg for this place again.",3.0
"More 3.75 but I'll round up for service. The place is quaint and cozy, without being overly rustic. Service was great so there's nothing else to say about that. We ordered from the prix fix menu.

Those onions make all of the difference in the world.Pies were okay, nothing to write home about.The cheese dumplings were very tasty. If you like gnocchi, you'd love these. They had a great sauce on them, and their texture was perfect.The duck was YUMMMMMY. Don't be scared, it's pink in the middle, but that's intentional. The hash/greens were okay. Nothing as special as the duck itself. The steamed cake and panna cotta were amazing. My only complaint, I want 10x as much. It was seriously something special. YUM. I'm not the biggest fan of mint flavored desert, but the mint sauce on here was incredible.

"With the new listing of the Michelin guide for NYC out, Delaware and Hudson is the first spot we've hit up that we hadn't been to yet since the release of the 2016 edition. The night began a bit inauspiciously, unfortunately - we were told that it would be a 15-minute wait for our table, but it morphed into longer than 30 as whoever was there before us took their time (apparently a birthday dinner, so I can't begrudge the patrons themselves too much). That said, it seems a bit poor that time management was a bit off - and without a bar area or really anywhere to sit and wait, you are consigned to awkwardly hang out or hit another joint (not an issue in Williamsburg at all) while you wait for the phone call to come back. It was disjointed because once we were seated, we got blasted with the appetizers pretty much all at once, making it really difficult to enjoy or savor any of the flavors before the table was getting crowded with the appetizer bites. It definitely felt like they were trying to make up for lost time by (nearly literally) stuffing the food in our face, and it kind of ruined what was supposed to be a relatively casual, relaxing Friday dinner. With multiple waiters busing out our food very quickly (the only respite being when they dropped both of our second entrees in the back and had to recook them), it felt extremely impersonal. Kvetching about subpar service aside, the drinks offerings are quite extensive, with an eclectic beer selection that I appreciated (given how fast we ate, I only got to try one).For the food, the tasting menu is structured with small bites to start, followed by 2 main courses and desserts - a slightly more compressed tasting menu than you'd usually encounter, but one that was filling nonetheless. That said, I did feel like there were some missed opportunities. After starting out with a moist, delicious pretzel roll, I felt that the terrine, while full of good texture and pretty decent moistness on the rabbit meat, it was very bland and plain - a missed opportunity to really make a special dish, I thought. The beet-pickled quail eggs were also strangely disappointing, with the pickling extremely light (the beet really lent itself its color more than its flavor) and the egg, again - pretty plain. The fish here was generally well-executed, though; the house-smoked trout was a fantastic bite, served on a little pancake, and I was a big fan of the skate schnitzel that I had - very hearty but with good chew, great seasoning, and a perfect rye crust that gave each bite a ton of crunch. The green tomato pie was also really well-executed, with a texture that made it very nearly seem like apple pie - but in a dinner that seemed German-inspired and homey / hearty, it was a bit dissonant to have that be in the middle of the appetizer course. The other main course, aside from the aforementioned schnitzel, was the duck breast (you picked one or the other). While it was prepared pretty well and had a good smoky flavor to it, it didn't measure up to the best cuts of duck that I've had elsewhere in the city. As for the first course, I was a big fan of the saffron noodles with foraged mushrooms...a very rich sauce on the mushrooms enhanced what was already really good earthy flavors, and using a thick pasta was the right call to soak up as much of the juices as possible. Dessert was a delicious peanut butter chocolate cake with panna cotta - the creaminess of the panna cotta really played well against the firm, slightly crunchy texture of the cake. We then finished off with a plate of petit fours, with my favorite being the strawberry gummy, which tasted much more authentically fruity than most of the ones that I have had elsewhere.With a cozy, narrow dining room with what I would almost call 'standard' industrial fixtures, Delaware & Hudson very much captures the feel and essence of a New York City / Brooklyn restaurant. The food, on balance, was good, I felt that some of the items could have been executed with more flavor. However, the lengthy wait to get seated, followed by what seemed like a bit of a rush to get us out, was quite off-putting. I'd probably come here to eat again, as I'm always interested in farm-to-table spots, but for a Michelin-starred restaurant it's definitely one of the more underwhelming experiences on the service side at this rating.",3.0
"This is one of my top 10 best meals of my life.I went there yesterday with my g/f - absolutely everything was perfect.  Even things I don't typically like to eat... were so expertly prepared and delicious it made me wonder why I ever didn't like it in the first place.It was sad, because I heard people walk in to check the menu out and about half were turned off by the Pre-Fixe menu and walked out, I honestly wanted to yell at them that they're missing out on a godly meal and they'll probably end up at one of the droves of ""farm to table"" places that just load half the menu with truffle this and that.Anyway, try this place out, menu changes all the time so you can always try something new, I'll definitely be here again (and again and again....)",5.0

"This is one of the worst tastings I've experienced to date. I just really didn't like the food from the appetizers to the main to the dessert. Nothing was good except maybe the pretzel bread and ravioli. The tasting reminded me of the Great Depression. Were these ingredients picked to showcase that they are in fact edible or were they picked because they are ""in season""? Maybe I'm just not hipster-y enough to understand or appreciate this place. Even the orange soda suggested to me did not taste good - tasted like bitter campari and I just stopped drinking after a couple sips. Food:Borscht was ok. The squash course was just bland and pairing the nuts with the squash seemed awfully strange. The bluefish pate and the sardine toast were too fishy for me. Meatballs were ok. The ravioli dish was good but way too oily for my liking. The red snapper was overcooked and dry (unless this is part of the theme?) and the brussel sprouts were very bitter. The chocolate dessert was not very good either.",2.0

"Not good! Hope tonight's experience is not an indication of the new quality of Delaware and Hudson! The best thing was the taste of potato soup to start the meal.

The pasta course was very disappointing, pasta was hard and overwhelmed with the fishiness of sardines.

"KenScale: 8.0/10Farm-to-table cuisine has been one of the most overused lingos in today's culinary world. What does it exactly mean? I've been to some outstanding places like Mas Farmhouse that emphasize fresh and seasonal ingredients, and have been to some others that were underwhelming. Sometimes, I felt the latter tried too hard to impress the crowd instead of returning to the basic principles of what makes a meal pleasant. Delaware and Hudson is one of those restaurants that sticks to this principle almost to a fault, but in a good way. Headed by Patti Jackson, it has quickly gained acclaim since its opening as a perfect neighborhood restaurant in Williamsburg showcasing classic American fare. I've always been wanting to visit this place, especially with a tasting menu at $48 per person that sounded too good to be true. Overall, I had a very pleasant dinner.The tasting menu started with a bunch of appetizer dishes. They all look pedestrian in display but I enjoyed every one of the dishes, from the aromatic parsnip and apple soup to silky smooth pretzel rolls to cheese ball and relish plate that worked together very well. House cured duck pastrami with cherry mustard was somewhat ordinary, but I couldn't stop enjoying the salt cod croquettes. Next came the butternut squash and ricotta dumplings with sage butter, whose modest use of seasoning perfectly fit my taste. I would say the main courses were slightly less impressive than what came before. While the pot roast of beef with sweet potato puree and sautéed broccoli rabe was nicely cooked, I couldn't identify one single element from flavor or texture that stood out. Black sea bass with cauliflower puree, romanesco and almonds was another solid dish but it was difficult to pinpoint why this dish didn't cross the level of mind-blowingly amazing. Next came the dessert of white bean panna cotta with chocolate cake, which I enjoyed very much. By the time the finishing touch of an assortment of small dessert bites arrived, I was beyond stuffed. Talking about a bang for the buck! I absolutely loved the décor of the dining room, a perfect neighborhood spot with a little bit of Brooklyn charm here and there. The restaurant serves beer and wine, so make sure to order a glass or two to complement your meal. The restaurant's dining space is relatively small (and cozy), so make sure to book about a week in advance. Delaware and Hudson has everything that I would want in a restaurant for my neighborhood. If my neighborhood (Midtown East), which is sadly lacking many good restaurants, had more and more of these places, I might not get away as often to other neighborhoods in the city that are considered culinary centers of NYC.",4.0
"This place is awesome. We came here on a double date with friends and had a great time. The restaurant is small and a reservation is definitely needed. If you're like me and don't really like to make a ton of decisions when it comes to what you're going to eat for dinner, Delaware and Hudson is the place for you. It's a $48 prix fixe and it's a DEAL. The only choice you have to make is what you'd like to eat as your main dish and they take care of everything else.  I'm not going to go into each thing that we ate but everything was delicious. Before my entree, a bunch of apps came out. I will say that my favorite of those was the creamy lobster dish while my least favorite item was the rabbit terrine (disclaimer: I generally don't like rabbit dishes). The price is so absolutely right and the chef came out at the end to serve us our dessert. What a treat!  We'll definitely be back!",5.0
"With the new listing of the Michelin guide for NYC out, Delaware and Hudson is the first spot we've hit up that we hadn't been to yet since the release of the 2016 edition. The night began a bit inauspiciously, unfortunately - we were told that it would be a 15-minute wait for our table, but it morphed into longer than 30 as whoever was there before us took their time (apparently a birthday dinner, so I can't begrudge the patrons themselves too much). That said, it seems a bit poor that time management was a bit off - and without a bar area or really anywhere to sit and wait, you are consigned to awkwardly hang out or hit another joint (not an issue in Williamsburg at all) while you wait for the phone call to come back. It was disjointed because once we were seated, we got blasted with the appetizers pretty much all at once, making it really difficult to enjoy or savor any of the flavors before the table was getting crowded with the appetizer bites. It definitely felt like they were trying to make up for lost time by (nearly literally) stuffing the food in our face, and it kind of ruined what was supposed to be a relatively casual, relaxing Friday dinner. With multiple waiters busing out our food very quickly (the only respite being when they dropped both of our second entrees in the back and had to recook them), it felt extremely impersonal. Kvetching about subpar service aside, the drinks offerings are quite extensive, with an eclectic beer selection that I appreciated (given how fast we ate, I only got to try one).For the food, the tasting menu is structured with small bites to start, followed by 2 main courses and desserts - a slightly more compressed tasting menu than you'd usually encounter, but one that was filling nonetheless. That said, I did feel like there were some missed opportunities. After starting out with a moist, delicious pretzel roll, I felt that the terrine, while full of good texture and pretty decent moistness on the rabbit meat, it was very bland and plain - a missed opportunity to really make a special dish, I thought. The beet-pickled quail eggs were also strangely disappointing, with the pickling extremely light (the beet really lent itself its color more than its flavor) and the egg, again - pretty plain. The fish here was generally well-executed, though; the house-smoked trout was a fantastic bite, served on a little pancake, and I was a big fan of the skate schnitzel that I had - very hearty but with good chew, great seasoning, and a perfect rye crust that gave each bite a ton of crunch. The green tomato pie was also really well-executed, with a texture that made it very nearly seem like apple pie - but in a dinner that seemed German-inspired and homey / hearty, it was a bit dissonant to have that be in the middle of the appetizer course. The other main course, aside from the aforementioned schnitzel, was the duck breast (you picked one or the other). While it was prepared pretty well and had a good smoky flavor to it, it didn't measure up to the best cuts of duck that I've had elsewhere in the city. As for the first course, I was a big fan of the saffron noodles with foraged mushrooms...a very rich sauce on the mushrooms enhanced what was already really good earthy flavors, and using a thick pasta was the right call to soak up as much of the juices as possible. Dessert was a delicious peanut butter chocolate cake with panna cotta - the creaminess of the panna cotta really played well against the firm, slightly crunchy texture of the cake. We then finished off with a plate of petit fours, with my favorite being the strawberry gummy, which tasted much more authentically fruity than most of the ones that I have had elsewhere.With a cozy, narrow dining room with what I would almost call 'standard' industrial fixtures, Delaware & Hudson very much captures the feel and essence of a New York City / Brooklyn restaurant. The food, on balance, was good, I felt that some of the items could have been executed with more flavor. However, the lengthy wait to get seated, followed by what seemed like a bit of a rush to get us out, was quite off-putting. I'd probably come here to eat again, as I'm always interested in farm-to-table spots, but for a Michelin-starred restaurant it's definitely one of the more underwhelming experiences on the service side at this rating.",3.0
"This is one of my top 10 best meals of my life.I went there yesterday with my g/f - absolutely everything was perfect.  Even things I don't typically like to eat... were so expertly prepared and delicious it made me wonder why I ever didn't like it in the first place.It was sad, because I heard people walk in to check the menu out and about half were turned off by the Pre-Fixe menu and walked out, I honestly wanted to yell at them that they're missing out on a godly meal and they'll probably end up at one of the droves of ""farm to table"" places that just load half the menu with truffle this and that.Anyway, try this place out, menu changes all the time so you can always try something new, I'll definitely be here again (and again and again....)",5.0
Went with moms. They took a bunch of special request and couldn't have been cooler about it. Food was incredible.,5.0
"This is one of the worst tastings I've experienced to date. I just really didn't like the food from the appetizers to the main to the dessert. Nothing was good except maybe the pretzel bread and ravioli. The tasting reminded me of the Great Depression. Were these ingredients picked to showcase that they are in fact edible or were they picked because they are ""in season""? Maybe I'm just not hipster-y enough to understand or appreciate this place. Even the orange soda suggested to me did not taste good - tasted like bitter campari and I just stopped drinking after a couple sips. Food:Borscht was ok. The squash course was just bland and pairing the nuts with the squash seemed awfully strange. The bluefish pate and the sardine toast were too fishy for me. Meatballs were ok. The ravioli dish was good but way too oily for my liking. The red snapper was overcooked and dry (unless this is part of the theme?) and the brussel sprouts were very bitter. The chocolate dessert was not very good either.",2.0
"I had an amazing experience. I loved Delaware and Hudson. The service was great, very friendly. Food was delicious. Incredibly nice indeed. The restaurant itself is beautiful. Very simple in its design but very nice. Slightly cold (AC), but that's the norm in USA. And on top of everything, because we had booked through a certain website, we were given complimentary scones for the following day breakfast! Wow! I was so impressed. And they were so good!!",5.0
"Not good! Hope tonight's experience is not an indication of the new quality of Delaware and Hudson! The best thing was the taste of potato soup to start the meal. Appetizers had very little flavor (felt like I needed the salt shaker near by to give everything some flavor). The herring was awful (slime and fishy). The pasta course was very disappointing, pasta was hard and overwhelmed with the fishiness of sardines. Guest had the cod and the pork entree and once again ""bring out the salt shaker"".  To top the whole disappointing evening was the hair in my dessert. Sorry but you failed this evening and won't be back.",2.0

"We went to Delaware and Hudson as part of NY Cider Week, hoping to try the cider pairings. However, it turned out that the pairing was $32 for 4 flight-size glasses so we sadly decided to skip in favor of beer and wine. We really enjoyed the food -- which was served at top speed by a rotating cast of servers. I assume the restaurant must overbook a bit because we felt that they were determined to whisk everything away, sometimes even before we were done. The decor was what you would expect from a storefront restaurant. It was pleasant and cozy except when the door opened and the narrow space was filled with cold air. For the winter, in particular, booking a table towards the back is probably the way to go.As everyone comments, the pretzel rolls are fantastic. We also loved the first course -- tiny gnocchi-like dumplings with apples, bacon, and greens. We didn't have any complaints about the rest of the dishes either; we just didn't love them as much as the dumplings and the pretzel rolls.",3.0
"Probably 3 1/2 *s.  Ambience, service and ingredients were great, I liked the prix fixe set-up because there's plenty of variety and food to sample.  The reason for my downgrade is I felt some of the dishes were lacking in flavor.  My main Pork Shank was severely lacking, it was slightly dry in parts but just didn't seem to have much seasoning.  I didn't feel it was anything special or great.  I'm not sure if I would return, there are other restaurant's I'd revisit before coming back, disappointing.",3.0
"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!! I wanted to get the chef's autograph, but was too shy this time around.  First off, they just got a well-deserved Michelin star (!), and the chef herself came out to talk to everyone dining that evening.  That has never happened to me outside of a special event. The space is small, and that makes it even better in this case, because the tables are not crammed together, and each group can feel like they've got space to themselves. I loved every bit of the décor, which is reminiscent of other farm to table restaurants, but has a more Williamsburg, chic feel to it without trying too hard.The lighting dimmed as the evening progressed (we got there at around 615, and left around 8), and they had little tea candles set out on the tables to set the mood. The servers were all courteous and awesome, and so great about the fact that it was my boyfriend's birthday (I had made a note on the Yelp SeatMe reservation). They were all kind, the waitress poured him some extra wine, and brought out his dessert with ""happy birthday"" written out in nice, beautiful script (in red icing). The menu is simple. For those who hate having to make decisions, Delaware & Hudson makes it easy--you only need to choose your entrée. The appetizers (to share) are all set, as are the first course and the dessert. Because the menu changes regularly, you'll never get bored should you decide to regularly splurge (at $54/person, it's not cheap but it's not sell-your-organs, either) . Yesterday, they were serving carrot soup (warm, served in a shot-size teacup, awesome--the kind of soup you'd want for a cold spring day in NY), pretzel rolls with sea salt, butter, and a side of artichoke (SO GERD), morel mushroom tart (made like a quiche), lamb meatballs with fava beans (YAY!)... If I'm forgetting something, my apologies, but I'm sure whatever is being served when everyone goes, as they should, it will be great. The first course was potato spelt dumplings with Virginia ham, black kale, and shredded gruyere cheese on top. YUMMMMMM. I was trying to slow myself down so it would last longer (the portions are pretty small but the quality is fantastic).  For the main course, I chose to go with the sea bass, while my boyfriend got the duck. Both were phenomenal. Finally, for dessert, we got the little pieces of pistachio cake, and a plate of bite-size chocolates (delivered to us by Chef Patti Jackson!!!!! FANGIRL SQUEAL). Everything was beautiful and nothing hurt, and I would totally go back again.",5.0
"The service here was amazing. After bringing out the first course on Easter, my date and I informed the waitress that although we weren't kosher, we'd already ordered the ham, we were trying to keep Passover by not eating bread... The waitress happily replied no worries and she proceeded to bring out everything pretzel baked matza to gafilta fish to matzah ball soup... None of which was on the menu that night... Moreover, they ended up hooking me up with brisket instead of the ham and when I off handedly mentioned I would have Liked to try the ham, the waitress offered to bring some out for meFood was very fresh and ambiance was great, the staff went above and beyond beyond.",4.0
"ok... so i am waiting for some backlash even as i write this because there is definitely a delware and hudson bandwagon but unfortunately i just cant quite hop on. after reading so much praise about this little williamsburg spot, i scampered to find a reservation and was pleased to snag an early seating on afriday night. the restaurant is cute, the servers are friendly, and i love the concept. however the food truly was a bit of a let down for both of us. maybe it was all the hype, maybe it was just an off night, or maybe it is just we are impossible to please these days. regardless of the reason we left pretty disappointed and im sad to say i dont think we'll be back anytime soon. better for the rest of you i guess. the food: small apps to startfennel and potato soup - tasty but watery pretzel rolls - warm and salty goodness relish plate - confused by this, there were a few traditional pickles, olives and some raw vegetables (cauliflower, celery, radish) lobster, scallop and rock shrimp Newburg - really good but so tiny rabbit terrine Hasenpfeffer style - I did not care for this so passed house-made cotechino with lentils - fried sausage with little flavorfarmer's cheese dumplings swiss chard and cured pork - the dumplings and pork were so good, the swiss chard was a little bitter for me and overtook the other flavorswild striped bass brussel sprouts and parsnip puree - my husband got this and found his fish slightly overcooked. I tried a bite and found it to be a bit fishy. Also the brussel sprouts were slick / soggy which I just personally don't prefer preparation wise. beef wellington  dauphine potatoes and winter greens - I got this and also was sadly underwhelmed. The beef itself had very little flavor and the wellington preparation was hit or miss. Some bites were well balanced with the croissant crust and a very light layer of filling while other parts of the filling were very greasy and unappetizing. Dessert consisted of 2 bites - a chocolate cake and a puff pastry with caramelized sugar both sitting in a coffee flavored liquid. they also brought a selection of chocolate to end the meal that were all very tasty. Overall again we were disappointed as we had so looked forward to dining there. Maybe we just didn't catch the right menu for us - a chance you take with a rotating menu!",3.0
"This was a fantastic spot for brunch. The scones ($6) were both outstanding and a fantastic deal. There were 3 kinds of scones, 2 of each, for a total of 6 awesome scones. Really good. We actually kind of filled up on these.We also split a poached eggs and hash plate with a small salad. Also great.We were greeted warmly when we came in and our server was perfect. Based on our brunch experience, we definitely plan to come back again.",5.0
"Great brunch spot! Definitely recommend any of their homemade sodas - I tried the tangerine soda - it's pure tangerine pure and sparkling water - amazing! We had the berry bowl with yogurt (pretty standard, but it's hard to mess up fresh berries and plain yogurt), then for entrees tried the crabcakes and the bread pudding French toast. Both were incredible and a nice mix of sweet and savory. The crabcakes are served warm with hollandaise on top of yummy greens with a subtle but delicious vinaigrette. The French toast was definitely a heavy, rich meal, topped with baked pears and pomegranate seeds - perfect accompaniments. The French toast is awesome as an entree but would be the best when shared by 2-5 people as a sweet end or share plate to more savory brunch meals (in my opinion).Service was fantastic with coffee constantly refilled, server checking on us just the right amount, and not too busy or rushed. Will definitely be back!",4.0
"Wow, our meal at Delaware and Hudson was terrific. From the moment we entered the door were treated as if we had entered someone's home.  The food is a set menu and every dish was terrific.  My only complaint was the wine we ordered.  It was not worthy of the food.  The atmosphere is sparse and basic, which was just fine for us.",5.0
"Awesome Tasting Menu - Reasonably priced - Great ServiceIt is not very often in New York, or anywhere for that matter, that you can order a tasting menu for two and get out of the place genuinely blown away by the food and still have your wallet in tact.

The wine menu also offers plenty of affordable options which paired well with the food.If you're looking for a date night in Williamsburg whether it be for a special occasion or you are looking for a great tasting menu, Delaware and Hudson is the place to go. The service was great to boot, just make sure you have a reservation when you go on the weekends.",5.0
"We had the seasonal tasting menu here- the waitstaff is incredible and gracious- clearly this place earned their newly minted michelin star.The food:Well prepared and also well plated- the flavors were complimentary and there was not a dish that was overwhelmingly defined by a single spice or flavor.Favorites were the pretzel rolls (so much better than the typical dinner roll), the scallops- light and perfectly cooked, no rubbery messes here, and the duck pastrami- inventive and yet still comfortingly familiar.There was such a wide assortment of desserts here, great news for a sweets lover like myself- standouts were the complimentary chocolates delivered by chef Patti Jackson herself.We had a bottle of their cabernet here, and it complimented our entree selection of braised beef perfectly.",4.0
"We went to Delaware and Hudson as part of NY Cider Week, hoping to try the cider pairings. However, it turned out that the pairing was $32 for 4 flight-size glasses so we sadly decided to skip in favor of beer and wine. We really enjoyed the food -- which was served at top speed by a rotating cast of servers. I assume the restaurant must overbook a bit because we felt that they were determined to whisk everything away, sometimes even before we were done. The decor was what you would expect from a storefront restaurant. It was pleasant and cozy except when the door opened and the narrow space was filled with cold air.

"I went to D&H this weekend for their ""They're Among Us"" menu, focused on seasonal mushrooms. We were a group of five, plus a 16 month old. We arrived early and though the staff wasn't quite ready for us, they let us in from the cold night and got us seated and watered. Our waiter (missed the name, sorry) and the rest of the staff were so kind and sweet with the baby, who is in a bit of a 'random pterodactyl screaming' phase. They brought us warm water to heat up the baby's meal and patiently replaced all the silverware he threw on the ground. As has been said, the menu is Prix Fixe, with 8 or so apps, a pasta, a choice of three entrees (meat, fish, veggie) and dessert. We enjoyed some of the apps more than others - the squash soup was sublime, the cheese ball was ok, the duck pastrami was over-the-top ridiculously yummy, the green tomato pie... not great. BUT, it was so fun to try a bite or two of everything. We all had either the beef cheek or the hen-o'-the-woods (no one ordered the cod) and everyone enjoyed their entree. Dessert was really tasty panna cotta. Oh, and they didn't even blink at catering to a gluten allergy.Highly, gladly, enthusiastically recommended!",4.0

"My boyfriend and I were really excited to try this place because it had already received one Michelin star without having been open even a year--and it's priced well. We were happy with our meal, service, ambiance, etc.Service: We arrived a few minutes before our reservation and our table wasn't ready yet, but the maitre d' offered us Cava while we waited, which was a nice touch and made us feel ""at home"" in a way. Our table was ready in about 5-10 minutes. Service was good--definitely not the best I've ever had, but no complaints. It was cool that the chef/owner hand-delivered the last course of the meal--a tray of chocolates--to each table. When we were leaving, it was raining and the maitre d' offered us an umbrella, which was also nice.Ambiance: Very small restaurant. Farm/rustic style. Very casual for a Michelin starred restaurant, which I loved! Pretty bright in there. Two outdoor tables. The bathroom was clean and had a great-smelling candle. We really liked the silverware for some reason. Cool ceiling. Really cozy and comfortable.Food: The food was really good. I am not a very adventurous eater, but made myself try everything and I was always happily surprised. Some of my favorite things were the pickles, the BUCKWHEAT NOODLES (favorite), of course the main dish (I got the vegetarian option of chanterelle mushrooms and parsnip puree), and the dessert (warm chocolate cake and the best vanilla panna cotta). I could have done without the pretzel (but my boyfriend loved it so it may have just been me).Overall, I don't think I will be back, only because there are so many other restaurants in New York City that wow me a little more than Hudson and Delaware. However, it was a really cool experience and I am very glad we decided to go.",4.0
"I went to Delaware and Hudson in early January, and am still salivating for the food I ate that night.The ambiance of the restaurant is perfect. It's like Grandma's house meets your local farm, and though very hipster, is a restaurant I'd contemplate moving a cot into.We were seated early and the hostess and waitress were both present and lovely. Our waitress gave us great suggestions for beer and was thorough in asking about dietary restrictions (of which we had some). Throughout the meal, the chef walked around and greeted dinners. The entire restaurant is warm, cozy, and welcoming, but not crowded, given that it only seats 18.The appetizers were brought out with perfect timing and it was a fennel and potato soup. I've never had a slurp of soup so perfect. I find my mouth watering for the slightly salty, yet creamy broth. Shortly after the pretzel rolls were brought out. Savor these bad boys. The butter melts perfectly on them, and I was almost mad at myself for eating it slightly too quickly. The pickle plate was alright, and was definitely the weakest part of the meal. I think I got the top of the barrel. As someone who grew up on whitefish salad, the salt cod croquettes brought whitefish to the next level. Smatter some on a bagel and I'd be perfectly happy. Instead of the lamb, I got a pickled egg. I've never had a pickled egg, but the briny-ness plus the softness of the egg was absolutely delicious.The first course was cheese dumplings, gnudi, and though delicious, I thought it was one of the weaker parts of the meal. I don't eat red meat, so it was only dumplings and swiss chard. I love swiss chard- it is hands down my favorite vegetable, so I was disappointed by this dish. It fell flat without the meat, and the chef didn't make a substitute that tied it together.I ordered the striped bass with brussels sprouts and parsnip puree for the main course. The fish was delicately and precisely cooked and the parsnip puree was out of this world. The brussels sprouts were cooked into a crispy chip and made a perfect topping for the fish. Definitely one of the highlights of the meal.Lastly, came the dessert parade. We had a warm chocolate cake with a caramel cream puff topped with a coffee sauce. If this doesn't make your mouth water, they finished the meal with a parade of delicious house made chocolates (a full array of light to dark) to perfectly end the meal.Bonus points, I was FULL after the meal and paid a decent price.

Bass was cooked perfectly and the tomatoes really shined here; they were like little flavor bombs that you wanted with every bite. Pancake seemed to be mostly for texture, but doesn't mean it wasn't well-executed.Lastly, we were spoiled with a double helping of dessert as well. First up was a very cute little pie with ice cream (I think...pretty dazed by this point in the best sense), followed by a plate about which my late mother would have said, ""It's too pretty to eat"". This included chocolate and white chocolate, a macaroon...did I mention a daze?On the decor and aesthetic, I'd summarize as Oregon Trail without the dysentery.

"I went to D&H this weekend for their ""They're Among Us"" menu, focused on seasonal mushrooms. We were a group of five, plus a 16 month old. We arrived early and though the staff wasn't quite ready for us, they let us in from the cold night and got us seated and watered. Our waiter (missed the name, sorry) and the rest of the staff were so kind and sweet with the baby, who is in a bit of a 'random pterodactyl screaming' phase. They brought us warm water to heat up the baby's meal and patiently replaced all the silverware he threw on the ground. As has been said, the menu is Prix Fixe, with 8 or so apps, a pasta, a choice of three entrees (meat, fish, veggie) and dessert. We enjoyed some of the apps more than others - the squash soup was sublime, the cheese ball was ok, the duck pastrami was over-the-top ridiculously yummy, the green tomato pie... not great. BUT, it was so fun to try a bite or two of everything. We all had either the beef cheek or the hen-o'-the-woods (no one ordered the cod) and everyone enjoyed their entree. Dessert was really tasty panna cotta. Oh, and they didn't even blink at catering to a gluten allergy.Highly, gladly, enthusiastically recommended!",4.0
"On a cold Saturday in Williamsburg, decided to try this new Michelin crowned spot for brunch and it was a wonderful experience. We order the green salad with smoked Blue fish and it made me fall in love with greens. the crab cake egg Benedict were cooked to perfection. Sage sausage are so tasty and the funnel cake with maple syrup a new twist to an old classic. But the ultimate is the homemade jam served with the biscuit and scones, all this with a cool crisp bottle of Picpul  white made for a very nice brunch across the river.",4.0
"I rarely write reviews. Only when it is really really satisfying, I decided I have to do it.This place was absolutely fantastic.

The few who still cares to make an effort deserves my highest recommendations.Two people, prefixed menu and a bottle of Pinot Noir for a total of $140!Thank you, and see you soon.",5.0

It came back out in the same condition, slightly hotter but still just warm. The portion was meager for the price as well. This is a small gripe, but the bread was plain, store bought.

"Great Dining ExperienceThis was our second dinner at D and H and both were superb and excellent value.The food is outstanding with a great mix of appetizers and the best pretzel bread I have had. The second course, a pasta with farmers cheese and veggies last night was truly a simple but mind boggling dish. The suckling pig main, a porchetta, rivaled the best we had in Tuscany. And the desserts, both of them were were awesome. All for $54 (I hope they can stay in business at that price). The wine list was very approachable and offered some very good values on wines I knew. Staff could not be more gracious and accommodating and the restaurant ambience was comfortable and conducive to relaxing conversation. A great touch, the chef comes out and delivers the final dessert course personally. She had a great memory and we carried on our conversation from our first visit, three months ago. Nothing makes you feel more like you are home than that.",5.0
"Delaware and Hudson has settled into a very nice groove. Chef Patti Jackson's food remains delicious. A current fave is the fried oyster on kohlrabi slaw. An inspired mix of texture, flavor, temperature counterpoint. I'll be sad to see it go. But, I survived the end of ramp season, I ate almost enough noodles with fresh cherry tomatoes and fresh cheese to last me until next summer. The leg of lamb was back on the menu. Now, I want the duck.The food remains delicious, service is good and the concept inspires curiosity. Often around five o'clock  starting to feel peckish I go and check their website, see what's for dinner.There's always room for pretzel rolls. And now I'm thinking I could use a plate of lamb meatballs with a nice Italian red. I checked the website just now. Lamb is off, duck is back. But you don't have to believe me, here's what The Guide Michelin saysny.eater.com/2014/9/30/6…",5.0
"This was one of the best dinners I've had in a while. Delaware and Hudson offers a wonderful four-course pre-fixe dinner for $48 with a menu that reflects what is offered at local farmer's markets; that means it changes bit by bit each week. The menu includes set appetizers, a set first course, an entree of your choosing, and set desserts for the table.The menu had seven dishes listed under the appetizer section, so I assumed that we'd be getting incredibly small portions of each (like being served on one tiny spoon?), but to my amazement each dish was actually the size of a tapas plate. After seven appetizers, I was already starting to get a little full!  I was just so wow'ed from the first bite, that I knew that if the appetizers were that delicious, the other courses would be just as fantastic. Some standout appetizers were the warm chestnut soup (creamy, silky, comforting), the pretzel rolls (soft, chewy, warm, magical with the sweet butter), and the ham and potatoes with shaker rarebit (the potatoes were cooked simply, but were delicious when paired with the salty ham bits and melted cheese). The best appetizer, in my opinion, was the pickle assortment. All the vegetables were pickled in-house and things I'd never even seen pickled before like fairytale eggplant and green tomatoes were pickled to the perfect amount of sweet acidity while still retaining such a satisfying crunch. I ate from a jar of pickles at home the next day, but they weren't even half as enjoyable.Continuing with the trend of using fresh ingredients to create wholesome, homey food, the first course of ricotta dumplings were pillowy and each forkful had a great assortment of flavors and textures from the sweet pork belly crumbs, pickled walnuts, and bitter Swiss chard. My striped bass entree was cooked perfectly and had such sweet, soft, melted leeks underneath. J's pork loin was also cooked and seasoned well; it paired well with the turnips and cipollini onions. Last but certainly not least, the panna cotta with chocolate cake dessert was superb. I'm no panna cotta connoisseur, but I feel like it could definitely be on a NYC top 10 list. Likelihood of another visit:For the amount of food we received, this was such a steal. With Delaware and Hudson conveniently located at the first stop into Brooklyn on the L, I would love love love to go back. I'm curious about how the menu changes with the passing of each season.",5.0

We ordered the pot pie, which was actually just chicken and noodles. The dish itself was lovely - handmade noodles and slow cooked noodles - but it came out lukewarm and in a freezing cold bowl on a 11 degree day. We asked the waitress to throw it in the oven. It came back out in the same condition, slightly hotter but still just warm. The portion was meager for the price as well. This is a small gripe, but the bread was plain, store bought. For all of the phenomenal reviews I read and the price point, I'd expect fresh baked bread to be sourced from a bakery in the area.",2.0
"Great Dining ExperienceThis was our second dinner at D and H and both were superb and excellent value.The food is outstanding with a great mix of appetizers and the best pretzel bread I have had. The second course, a pasta with farmers cheese and veggies last night was truly a simple but mind boggling dish. The suckling pig main, a porchetta, rivaled the best we had in Tuscany. And the desserts, both of them were were awesome. All for $54 (I hope they can stay in business at that price). The wine list was very approachable and offered some very good values on wines I knew. Staff could not be more gracious and accommodating and the restaurant ambience was comfortable and conducive to relaxing conversation. A great touch, the chef comes out and delivers the final dessert course personally. She had a great memory and we carried on our conversation from our first visit, three months ago. Nothing makes you feel more like you are home than that.",5.0
"Delaware and Hudson has settled into a very nice groove. Chef Patti Jackson's food remains delicious. A current fave is the fried oyster on kohlrabi slaw. An inspired mix of texture, flavor, temperature counterpoint. I'll be sad to see it go. But, I survived the end of ramp season, I ate almost enough noodles with fresh cherry tomatoes and fresh cheese to last me until next summer. The leg of lamb was back on the menu. Now, I want the duck.The food remains delicious, service is good and the concept inspires curiosity. Often around five o'clock  starting to feel peckish I go and check their website, see what's for dinner.There's always room for pretzel rolls. And now I'm thinking I could use a plate of lamb meatballs with a nice Italian red. I checked the website just now. Lamb is off, duck is back. But you don't have to believe me, here's what The Guide Michelin saysny.eater.com/2014/9/30/6…",5.0
"This was one of the best dinners I've had in a while. Delaware and Hudson offers a wonderful four-course pre-fixe dinner for $48 with a menu that reflects what is offered at local farmer's markets; that means it changes bit by bit each week. The menu includes set appetizers, a set first course, an entree of your choosing, and set desserts for the table.The menu had seven dishes listed under the appetizer section, so I assumed that we'd be getting incredibly small portions of each (like being served on one tiny spoon?), but to my amazement each dish was actually the size of a tapas plate. After seven appetizers, I was already starting to get a little full!  I was just so wow'ed from the first bite, that I knew that if the appetizers were that delicious, the other courses would be just as fantastic. Some standout appetizers were the warm chestnut soup (creamy, silky, comforting), the pretzel rolls (soft, chewy, warm, magical with the sweet butter), and the ham and potatoes with shaker rarebit (the potatoes were cooked simply, but were delicious when paired with the salty ham bits and melted cheese). The best appetizer, in my opinion, was the pickle assortment. All the vegetables were pickled in-house and things I'd never even seen pickled before like fairytale eggplant and green tomatoes were pickled to the perfect amount of sweet acidity while still retaining such a satisfying crunch. I ate from a jar of pickles at home the next day, but they weren't even half as enjoyable.Continuing with the trend of using fresh ingredients to create wholesome, homey food, the first course of ricotta dumplings were pillowy and each forkful had a great assortment of flavors and textures from the sweet pork belly crumbs, pickled walnuts, and bitter Swiss chard. My striped bass entree was cooked perfectly and had such sweet, soft, melted leeks underneath. J's pork loin was also cooked and seasoned well; it paired well with the turnips and cipollini onions. Last but certainly not least, the panna cotta with chocolate cake dessert was superb. I'm no panna cotta connoisseur, but I feel like it could definitely be on a NYC top 10 list. Likelihood of another visit:For the amount of food we received, this was such a steal. With Delaware and Hudson conveniently located at the first stop into Brooklyn on the L, I would love love love to go back. I'm curious about how the menu changes with the passing of each season.",5.0
"Just went for the first time tonight and can't wait to come back! The menu is amazing from start to finish and everyone working there literally could not be nicer.I got the leg of lamb which is some of the best lamb I have ever had. It was perfectly cooked and the quality meat was outstanding. My girlfriend had the vegetarian option which was a potato, egg and goat cheese dish and was raving about it.Can't say enough great things about this place and we are already planning our next trip back.",5.0

My second visit to Delaware and Hudson and I am a fan. The space is pleasant and the service good. Homey ambiance. The food is a tasting menu and varied a lot in my two visits. I enjoyed the very set menu experience. You have a choice from two entrees. There are hit and misses on the menu. I would liked to be offered seconds on any two favorite appetizer and agree that some dishes need to be more aggressively spaced. Also they have raised  prices since Pete Wells named it one of his top ten restaurants of 2014. It's a pricey night out !,4.0
"Here's the deal - the concept of this place is great, and the dinner there was great the first time I went, right after it launched. Then, I decided to go back for brunch - and was SO disappointed twice.  The service wasn't great, and they got my food wrong. Even when the food arrived, it was completely ordinary and blah.  Could have gotten a ham, egg and cheese bagel at Bagelsmith for more flavor and less $. Then, I went back again. And my eggs came with a huge hair in it. They apologized, gave me some free prosecco and gave me a new plate - which was obviously the exact same (cold eggs) minus the hair. Again, so boring and plain.  So disappointed.",3.0
"Well, I'm extremely disappointed by Delaware and Hudson. First, we made a dinner reservation three weeks ago and called to confirm and they told us they lost the reservation. Then they said they found it. Then they seated us in the back of an empty restaurant. The meal started with burnt, soggy, mushy popcorn soup, setting the tone for the whole tasting menu. The only thing I would ever put in my mouth again is the fish entree. The tasting menu is cheap because the food was not good. Granted, the tasting menu changes and maybe we just got unlucky. We had a nice server, and we appreciate the meal, but will not be returning.",2.0
"Adorable place, food was pretty good, but SMALL portions. A friend and I stopped here for weekend brunch. They had 3 small tables outside (but covered by an awning) which was perfect because not only do I love dining outdoors, but it also began to rain that day. We started with some strong beers $8-$9 each. Not terrible, but not well priced either. Good craft beer is worth it though. I was in more of a drinking mood, so I just had a side of roasted potatoes and my friend had the trout brunch entree. My potatoes were $6 and his trout was $14. The potatoes were soggy and bad. The trout salad was AMAZING. It was really small and had thinly sliced filets of trout on a bed of arugala tossed with a creamy dill dressing. The dressing was on point. I didn't eat any trout because I am not a fan of seafood, but my friend said it was yummy. Hard truth though, there may have been 2oz of trout, if that, total in the salad. When it came out with the potatoes, he thought I had ordered a side salad, and I thought they were bringing out the salad that came with his meal. This portion was MEAGER. Even for a side salad it wasn't that big. We actually went and ate at a soul food joint later because we were still hungry, ha. If the portion was a little larger this would easily be a 4 star or higher rating. I understand it's a Michelin star rating, but they shouldn't make it seem like that meal is an entree because it is not...nowhere close. I'm a very small girl, and that would never cut it as a full meal for me or anyone I know. Would be willing to give this place another try though.",3.0
"Great lunch! We had the pork sandwich, crab cake sandwich and the BLHT and finished off with a funnel cake. The service and food were great! We sat outside on a beautiful afternoon and had a great time. Inside seemed very nice as well and they had a solid beer selection. We would definitely go back.",4.0
"Delaware and Hudson delivers fine dining for the attention-span deprived. If you like to sample a little of everything and don't want to wade through a long menu and choose one delicious thing over another, this is a perfect choice.  The tiny but numerous appetizer tastings come out one after another in rapid succession, but it was all good and some of the plates were outstanding: the bluefish pate, the spaghetti squash, the pretzel rolls.  The dumplings (not my favorite), were served with spinach and mushrooms in brown butter (which were absolutely my favorite, so go figure).  The main course fish was perfectly prepared and the desserts, also served in multiple mini-courses, were also terrific.  The chef is very talented, the staff is cheery, the prices don't break the bank and the wine list is good and affordable - this is fine dining done with a New Brooklyn flavor - try it!",4.0

"""Tasting"" menus like Delaware and Hudson's are always exciting. I throw the word tasting in quotes because all the appetizers on the menu come out to the table and dessert is completely the chef's choice. The evening we went, the only choice we had was the main course. That's more than ok because Patti Jackson knows exactly what she's doing. Absolutely everything was executed perfectly. It's very hard to pick standout items because everything was so extremely good. There are a few things that keep rolling around and coming to the fore of my thoughts. The squash soup starter was one of the best soups I have ever had; it was perfectly smooth, hugely flavorful, featured wonderful seasoning and finally, had the addition of a rye crouton which was transformative in terms of both texture and the impart of a bit of caraway flavor.The fried oysters with kohlrabi slaw were incredible. The oysters were fried in a tempura-like batter that gave them a puffy and completely un-oily texture. The slaw was a perfect pairing.I particularly  enjoyed the mushrooms on toast points which seemed to be a riff on creamed chipped beef, a fairly common mid-Atlantic  specialty. While there was no beef, matsutake mushrooms were assertive and beefy on their own. The panna cotta dessert was the best I have ever had and one of the best desserts I have ever had.The restaurant staff is friendly, engaging, and extremely well trained while still appearing casual. Chef Jackson came out to our table, and all others at the appropriate time, to deliver a final plate of really incredible chocolates.I really cannot say enough good things about this restaurant.",5.0
"What can't I say about this place? My boyfriend and I stumbled in unknowingly on the first day D&H was open only to experience a phenomenal farm fresh meal accompanied by the friendliest service I have experienced in a long time at any establishment, let alone one in NYC. For brunch, you simply must start with the scones (baked fresh daily on premise) followed by any of the entrees. My current fave on the seasonally changing menu is the BLHT (bacon, lettuce & heirloom tomato). Dinner is equally fantastic and will leave you feeling full at an amazing value of $48 for a 4-course tasting menu (!!). If you get a chance say hello to the genius that is Chef Patti.

"Unfortunately this was a rare occasion where Yelp did not serve us well.My wife and I ate here tonight and had the worst service ... ever, maybe. We showed up at 7:30 and ordered quickly. The appetizers (bluefish pate and meatballs) came quickly and were fine; not ""5 star"" fine, by any means, but we felt like we were off to a reasonable start. That's when things started to go south.There were only a few other tables at that time, but it took 45 minutes for the entree to come. When it did come, both of our entrees were wrong; my wife and I both ordered pork loin, and they brought us fish.The fish, it should be noted, was a tiny portion; somewhere around 1/3 or 1/4 the size of a portion of fish that you'd expect as an entree. Fortunately it only took them 15 minutes to bring out our pork entrees. The pork was good, but the portion again was too small. We were thinking that since they made us wait 45 minutes, and then served us both the wrong entrees, maybe they'd offer us a free desert.Instead, they did not even offer us desert, they brought us the check without even asking if we wanted anything else. Pretty rude.But wait, there's more.I look at the check, and they charged us for the fish, which was more expensive than the pork. At that point, the server said they would comp the meatball appetizer ($6), to compensate for the $4 overage on the bill. Presumably, on the service front, we caught them on the worst night they've had since they opened, but, even if the service had been acceptable, I'm baffled by all of the 5 star reviews. We would not have come back, as the food was good, but by no means something to come back for. We live off the Graham Avenue stop, and our local places are better, and with normal portions.",1.0
"Amazing food, attentive and knowledgeable service, we loved it!! The pretzels were to die for, as well as the cod fritters, the house cured duck breast, the bass and the dessert.  A fantastic meal, paired with great wine!",5.0
"Let me start off by saying that the service I experienced deserves 5 stars. I don't include service in my reviews since I don't think a good/bad waiter(s) should affect a rating for a restaurant but all the service workers were top-notch. First thing I didn't like is that the price on the website is 48 dollars but the actual price I paid was 54 dollars (both not including tax/tip). I'm assuming it was recently raised but it's still just deceptive. If you have the time/energy to print up a new menu with the new price, you should be able to update your website, especially since you update the website every week to put up the new menu (that isn't very accurate, keep reading). It's one of those things that a customer obviously doesn't mention and you're not going to leave over 6 dollars but there's still no reason for it to happen and leaves a bad taste. Second thing is that over half the menu is different from the website's menu. Substitutions happen of course (and website says this) but the majority of the menu changed. So I made a reservation expecting a certain menu and price and I showed up and it was a mostly different menu at a higher price. Past that, the food was solid though unspectacular. It definitely comes across as a ""home cooked"" traditional meal but that also means that it's not very special or high end. I liked that they offered small plates at first to let me taste a variety of things. Those small plates were really the highlights. The first course gives no choice and was farmer's dumplings with swiss chard/cured pork something and was, again, solid though unspectacular. The mains (ones I tried were bass and pork loin) were similarly solid but not amazing and the desserts were the same. Given the other restaurants available, I wouldn't come again, but I didn't have a bad experience either. Normally I would give the restaurant 3 stars but with the dishonest price and significant menu changes I lowered it to a 2.",2.0

"Great experience overall. Went last Saturday night. I appreciated that they took a reservation, even just for two people. We have some dietary restrictions and they handled these with no issue, unlike some other places with a fixed menu. A good selection of delicious appetizers, a farmer's cheese dumpling dish that was like perfect, cheesy gnocchi. I had the vegetable croquettes for an entree and my boyfriend had the fish. Both were really good, perfectly cooked and nicely presented. The chef herself comes out after dessert to drop off some chocolates and chat. The whole vibe of the place is people who care about good and interesting food. It's very reasonably priced for the amount of food and the quality. Highly recommended!",5.0
"Food was decent, but I don't understand how this place got a Michelin star. This place doesn't compare to any other Michelin starred restaurant I've been to. It's very reasonably priced though. Staff is kind, but lacks etiquette and wine knowledge. The wine selection was poor at best. I like how this place focuses on local produce, but there were execution errors; soggy pie crust, no stuffing in the ravioli, the cheese ball was uninspired and was garnished with what seemed like a random assortment of pickles and raw veggies which reminded me of a plate of leftovers your sweet grandmother would pull out her fridge. It was all good, but nothing spectacular. Maybe it was an off night.Would give 2.5 stars.",3.0

"As someone who has been coming here (by chance)!since their first brunch service, I'm happy to hear - and totally understand why - D&H was rewarded a Michelin Star. Chef Patti deserves it. Everything here is farm fresh and made with care, from the bread to the tomato jam, tartar sauce, pickled beets, it's all in the details. I've had every meal they serve and though not every dish may be for everyone, I guarantee that there is something here that will make every diner want to come back. Standouts for lunch: crab cake sandwich, BLHT sandwich, bluefish salad. Brunch, anything but don't miss the scones. And dinner, don't worry about a thing and get excited for the pasta course because Chef is an iTruli alum (a southern Italian standby since 1998) and she really knows what she's doing. Plus, the staff is as warm and welcoming as everything on the menu.",5.0

When it did come, both of our entrees were wrong; my wife and I both ordered pork loin, and they brought us fish.The fish, it should be noted, was a tiny portion; somewhere around 1/3 or 1/4 the size of a portion of fish that you'd expect as an entree. Fortunately it only took them 15 minutes to bring out our pork entrees. The pork was good, but the portion again was too small. We were thinking that since they made us wait 45 minutes, and then served us both the wrong entrees, maybe they'd offer us a free desert.Instead, they did not even offer us desert, they brought us the check without even asking if we wanted anything else. Pretty rude.But wait, there's more.I look at the check, and they charged us for the fish, which was more expensive than the pork. At that point, the server said they would comp the meatball appetizer ($6), to compensate for the $4 overage on the bill. Presumably, on the service front, we caught them on the worst night they've had since they opened, but, even if the service had been acceptable, I'm baffled by all of the 5 star reviews. We would not have come back, as the food was good, but by no means something to come back for. We live off the Graham Avenue stop, and our local places are better, and with normal portions.",1.0
"Amazing food, attentive and knowledgeable service, we loved it!! The pretzels were to die for, as well as the cod fritters, the house cured duck breast, the bass and the dessert.  A fantastic meal, paired with great wine!",5.0
"Let me start off by saying that the service I experienced deserves 5 stars. I don't include service in my reviews since I don't think a good/bad waiter(s) should affect a rating for a restaurant but all the service workers were top-notch. First thing I didn't like is that the price on the website is 48 dollars but the actual price I paid was 54 dollars (both not including tax/tip). I'm assuming it was recently raised but it's still just deceptive. If you have the time/energy to print up a new menu with the new price, you should be able to update your website, especially since you update the website every week to put up the new menu (that isn't very accurate, keep reading). It's one of those things that a customer obviously doesn't mention and you're not going to leave over 6 dollars but there's still no reason for it to happen and leaves a bad taste. Second thing is that over half the menu is different from the website's menu. Substitutions happen of course (and website says this) but the majority of the menu changed. So I made a reservation expecting a certain menu and price and I showed up and it was a mostly different menu at a higher price. Past that, the food was solid though unspectacular. It definitely comes across as a ""home cooked"" traditional meal but that also means that it's not very special or high end. I liked that they offered small plates at first to let me taste a variety of things. Those small plates were really the highlights. The first course gives no choice and was farmer's dumplings with swiss chard/cured pork something and was, again, solid though unspectacular. The mains (ones I tried were bass and pork loin) were similarly solid but not amazing and the desserts were the same. Given the other restaurants available, I wouldn't come again, but I didn't have a bad experience either. Normally I would give the restaurant 3 stars but with the dishonest price and significant menu changes I lowered it to a 2.",2.0
Excellent meal from start to finish. Lovely staff. Restaurant a little tight in terms of seating. Otherwise fabulous.,5.0
"Dinner at Delaware and Hudson is a terrific experience. Chef Patti Jackson takes you on a journey of different tastes based on greenmarket produce, fresh seafood and fantastic presentations. Not to be missed!",5.0
"Great experience overall. Went last Saturday night. I appreciated that they took a reservation, even just for two people. We have some dietary restrictions and they handled these with no issue, unlike some other places with a fixed menu. A good selection of delicious appetizers, a farmer's cheese dumpling dish that was like perfect, cheesy gnocchi. I had the vegetable croquettes for an entree and my boyfriend had the fish. Both were really good, perfectly cooked and nicely presented. The chef herself comes out after dessert to drop off some chocolates and chat. The whole vibe of the place is people who care about good and interesting food. It's very reasonably priced for the amount of food and the quality. Highly recommended!",5.0
"Food was decent, but I don't understand how this place got a Michelin star. This place doesn't compare to any other Michelin starred restaurant I've been to. It's very reasonably priced though. Staff is kind, but lacks etiquette and wine knowledge. The wine selection was poor at best. I like how this place focuses on local produce, but there were execution errors; soggy pie crust, no stuffing in the ravioli, the cheese ball was uninspired and was garnished with what seemed like a random assortment of pickles and raw veggies which reminded me of a plate of leftovers your sweet grandmother would pull out her fridge. It was all good, but nothing spectacular. Maybe it was an off night.Would give 2.5 stars.",3.0
"Excellent!  Go for brunch and avoid the crowds. Buckwheat pancakes, crab cakes ( of course), bacon and scrapple are light, refined, flavorful.  Hash was our least favorite, but even this dish was 10 notches above the usual.",5.0
"As someone who has been coming here (by chance)!since their first brunch service, I'm happy to hear - and totally understand why - D&H was rewarded a Michelin Star. Chef Patti deserves it. Everything here is farm fresh and made with care, from the bread to the tomato jam, tartar sauce, pickled beets, it's all in the details. I've had every meal they serve and though not every dish may be for everyone, I guarantee that there is something here that will make every diner want to come back. Standouts for lunch: crab cake sandwich, BLHT sandwich, bluefish salad. Brunch, anything but don't miss the scones. And dinner, don't worry about a thing and get excited for the pasta course because Chef is an iTruli alum (a southern Italian standby since 1998) and she really knows what she's doing. Plus, the staff is as warm and welcoming as everything on the menu.",5.0
"We came here for the first time for dinner last night, and it was such a delight that I felt compelled to write a review.  It seems like there are a ton of restaurants like this - local, seasonal, changing menu, etcetera - and when we decided to try it, we thought we knew what to expect. We didn't think we'd be disappointed, but we also didn't expect it to be one of the best meals of our lives. Oh, but it was. Delaware & Hudson is truly exceptional. But it's hard to pinpoint exactly what it is that sets it apart - there are no tricky modernist techniques, or foraged Scandinavian tree barks, or nostalgically overindulgent ""comfort foods."" But everything we ate was amazing, beautifully prepared, classic but also very new. It's not fussy and overly precious, but it also isn't minimalist and underadorned, like you sometimes find at other farm-to-table places that make a fetish of the rustic. Maybe the chef's skill is in her ability to achieve a balance between technique and materials, or maybe it's the particular quality of the care and attention that she brings to what she does. I have eaten a lot of very good meals, but very rarely do I feel as though I'm in the presence of a master. I think the chef here is a master.    As other reviewers have noted, there's a prix fixe four-course menu, but that includes a number of appetizers to share prior to the first course, and there is a lot more flexibility than may initially seem the case.Highlights:Pretzel rolls Squash blossoms filled with crab meatHomemade spaghettiThe cooked tomatoes in several of the dishesThe tiny, tiny roasted eggplants in the hanger steakThe savory sweet corn puddingThe dessert chocolate cake and scone, and the after-dinner candiesLong story short: this place is really, really special, but its special qualities may not be immediately apparent. It's also really comfortable, splitting the difference between a familiar neighborhood spot and a nice evening out. It's in the old Egg space, and they've basically kept the same number of tables, so it's small, but not all crowded together. It's really the best. You should try it.",5.0
2nd time back and just as pleased. Service was great and very accommodating. We enjoyed the price fixer menu and all of the starters.

The chef didn't just take away ingredients from dishes she'd planned in order to make them safe for us, but made totally new, just as delicious items instead. They were not only accommodating but completely prepared. The menu looks small on first glance but, other than the entrees where you choose one from a list of three, you literally get to eat everything else on the menu.

"We loved this place!  The restaurant is long and narrow, and sends very cool vibes. Our meal started with the appetizers - pretzel rolls, fried oysters, marinated mackerel, marinated lamb meatballs. All of them were delicious, but my favorite was the fried oyster. The most favorite item of the night was the pasta dish, spaetzle with asparagus and dried beef. It was so good we were all hoping for a larger bowl of it. We tried all three entrees, pike, pork roast and risotto. They were all good, but not as good as the spaetzle. Dessert was Pana cotta and carrot cake combo. Both excellent. To take home we received some petits fours, which was a very nice way to end the evening. They serve only beer and wine (we wished there were cocktaiks) but when you order a glass of wine, they definitely serve a more than generous pour.

"One of the best dinners I have ever had, and I go out to eat all of the time. Perfect portions, and a creative well-balanced menu with a lot of variety. The $48 prefix is a steal with the quality, quantity and variety of food included. The atmosphere is very intimate but also airy, and the service was excellent. I'm going to go back ASAP.",5.0
"We loved this place!  The restaurant is long and narrow, and sends very cool vibes. Our meal started with the appetizers - pretzel rolls, fried oysters, marinated mackerel, marinated lamb meatballs. All of them were delicious, but my favorite was the fried oyster. The most favorite item of the night was the pasta dish, spaetzle with asparagus and dried beef. It was so good we were all hoping for a larger bowl of it. We tried all three entrees, pike, pork roast and risotto. They were all good, but not as good as the spaetzle. Dessert was Pana cotta and carrot cake combo. Both excellent. To take home we received some petits fours, which was a very nice way to end the evening. They serve only beer and wine (we wished there were cocktaiks) but when you order a glass of wine, they definitely serve a more than generous pour. Overall, we loved the experience, the food and the excellent service. It was worth heading over to Brooklyn even though the L line was out of commission.",5.0
"I am not sure I can convey how amazing this restaurant is.  They looked after us so well and really made a fuss over my mother for her birthday.  The food is sublime and each course is a fantastic presentation.  The value is off the charts too, I honestly think they are undercharging.  Finally the staff are so enthusiastic,  and genuinely care about the patrons.   This is a place to savour food and great service. Thank you.",5.0
"Absolutely delicious brunch. Not the largest portions but fabulous food. (We had the scones, pancakes, beef hash and omelet). Yummy.",5.0
"Service was so nice and accommodating.  The food was absolutely delicious.  Even though it is listed as a 2 course  prix fixe menu,the food just keeps coming with little tastes here and there.  Each thing we had was prepared quite simply but  the food tasted so fresh and well paired that it jumped out at you.  The chef came out and talked with us as the restaurant was closing and she was in no hurry at all.  She is a simple easygoing delight, just like the food she makes!",5.0
"We had a lovely experience at Delaware and Hudson.  Dinner is a pre-fixe menu, which liberated us from our usual negotiation of what and how much to order.  We selected the Chatham Cod and the Vegetable Fritters as entrees, and could not decide which we preferred.  Both offer great flavors, and reflect the season.  The array of other dishes served were a true delight, and highlight the skill and creativity of Chef Jackson.    The compact wine list offers good variety and value.  Atmosphere is welcoming as is the service.  Stacey H. was gracious and knowledgeable and we never felt rushed.  The presence of Chef Jackson throughout the evening made us feel like guests in her home.  Definitely worth regular visits, as the menu selections will evolve with the seasons.",5.0
"Food was awesome, and the courses were well timed. My friend and I had a great time. I was really surprised that the place was so empty - I guess it's ""a hidden gem"" still",5.0
Very good food.  A whole lot of work and smarts goes into their courses. Mellow atmosphere. Nice for a date.,4.0
"This place is Michelin star worthy!! We went there on a friend's recommendation and it totally blew us away. Tons of delicious farm-to-table bites that will make you swoon. The staff is so lovely and attentive, and the artfully created plates are nothing short of genius. Get there now before it becomes impossible to get a reservation! I wish I could give it 6 stars!",5.0
"live review: expect delays. got here at 9pm (on time for our reservation), sat at 10pm and bread came at 10.20pm.  it's 11.30pm and entrees are not here yet.  food might be good but the delay make it subpar. it's a prix fix place, not rocket science to know what/when to serve ppl.",1.0
"This place is so quaint and charming. You're immediately hit with a home-like, peaceful atmosphere and greeted by a genuinely kind staff! The drink menu is perfect for a rainy night, date night, or nice lunch. I'll definitely be coming back for more Harpoon UFO White and great company. Laughter and smiles fill the place, but in a subtle, non-annoying way. What a nice addition to the usually pretentious, dunce-drunken Williamsburg!",5.0
"I was very excited to try this place, I heard great things. We were a party of four, for brunch. The waiter seemed pretty frazzled and it took him a good 15 minutes before he even came over for our drink order. We ordered donuts to start, a beer, two bellinis and an orange juice. The beer came out after about 10 minutes, the bellinis took another 5. Three of the four dishes we ordered came out and it took another 5 for the last plate (of eggs and bacon to come out). My sister ordered the eggs and bacon, when she ordered the waiter said ""and homefries and toast?"" she said yes. The homefries were missing from the order and when my sister asked about them he ran in the back, quickly came back and said it doesn't come with homefries, but if she still wanted them he could order her a side, which made no sense at all. The donuts still hadn't arrived, which the waiter seemed surprised by. My crab cake benedict was extremely salty, but I was starving so I ate everything. The donuts were the best thing we had. I would go elsewhere in Williamsburg. Maybe dinner is better?",1.0
"Seize this chance to have Chef Patricia Jackson cook just for you, or so it feels, in this beautiful, tiny restaurant on North 5th, just off Bedford Ave. The staff is so friendly and welcoming it feels as though you've stepped into someone's home -- someone who can cook way better than anyone else you know. The prix fixe menu means the chef can do whatever she wants, in our case a tiny bowl of heirloom tomato soup, homemade pasta, a crunchy little salad with piping hot pretzel rolls, seared tuna, and because I don't eat meat, a delicious stuffed squash blossom just for me (while my friend had the regular bacon-topped appetizer, which she loved). That last-minute squash may even have been the best thing of the night. Or was it the tomato soup? Or the homemade pasta? Or the little desserts that followed? Or the homemade chocolates that followed that? I may have to go back to figure it out... very soon.",5.0
