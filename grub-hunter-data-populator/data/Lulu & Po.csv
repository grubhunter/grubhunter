"I've been in the neighbourhood for 4 years and this is the first time I've been to Lulu&Po. Loved it. Amazing wine selection, plus delicious food. My favourite was the Octopus with jalapeño and mint sauce. We'll be back!",5.0
Don't waste your time here. Drinks: The bartender doesn't have the slightest clue to making drinks. They were either too sweet or sour. No DAMN sense of balance.Food: Same as the drinks. No balance in flavors. I dont think they taste the food before plating.Service: nonexistent.,1.0
"""Hey, lets go try something new!"" says my friends every time we go eat. 25% of the time they're great, 50% of the time they're acceptable, 25% of the time they're a total bust. Lulu & Po, i'm sorry to say, was a total over-hype and at the end of the meal I wish I would have eaten at the Chipotle two blocks down instead. The initial assessment of the establishment was promising, high Yelp reviews, high ratings, cool. Small restaurant, six tables, and a bar with an open kitchen, awesome. Then the downhill ride from there on in was at an angle greater than of a hill in San Francisco. The two waitresses seemed overworked for a small place, the waiting time for just about anything was quite jaw dropping, and although the food was visually pleasant, I think my corner Halal cart for sure would have done a better job seasoning their food. If I wanted to eat with my eyes, I would have bought myself a ticket to the Museum of Natural History and spend my three hours there instead. Yes, it took three hours to finish from the time we sat down to the time we stood up to leave. Quite honestly, I would have probably liked the food at the museum more than at Lulu & Po.The menu looked very promising and had so much potential. Tapas style, large wine selection, and limited menu. But that is the only thing they have going for them, presentation 10/10, food 2/10. Each individual dish has aspects that over-powered the main thing. The lamb tartare was overpowered by the amount of olive oil on it, the chicken was overpowered by the sweet chili sauce used, and the burnt scallion fish, I know it's in the name, but the scallions were quite literally, charcoal. These are but a few examples out of the 11 tapas that were ordered but all of them followed the same trend. The tipping point in the scale though, was not the food, nor was it the slow and inattentive service. The tipping point in the scale was that they charged us $3 a place setting to cut and serve our own cake. A cake that was brought to celebrate a birthday and not purchased at their restaurant. A practice long abolished in New York, was practiced today in Brooklyn. I understand uncorking fees in restaurants that charge a set amount per bottle (usually no more than $10) but I have never been charged for them to bring out our own cake ever in my life, not in high end restaurants, not in Asian restaurants, not in Western restaurants, not anywhere. At first, we insisted that we cut our own cake but since the waitress was so adamant in her attempt to persuade us to let them cut the cake, we let her. It wasn't until we received the bill at the end that we understood why that was. I will not be returning to Lulu & Po ever and will only recommend this place to my worst enemies.",2.0
This place is among the finest restaurants that I've really tried since going to Brooklyn. Adore the feeling. Trendy lighting fixtures. Trendy decor all about. Excellent staff. The food was unbelievable. Attempted some pasta dish with sweet potato which was awesome. Not a poor thing on the menu from what I can tell.,5.0
Excellent for the foodies. Burnt scallion fish is outstanding. Best Brussel sprouts I've had and the duck is heavenly.,5.0
"I had high  hopes for Lulu & Po, but everything was just average or slightly less than average - for the pricing, service, food, decor, space, cocktails.",2.0
"Updated Review: I finally went back to Lulu & Po this weekend and was, yet again, disappointed due to the 1) Octopus and the 2) Edgy and Snobby environment (this was new to me). We ordered the Caesar Salad and the Octopus. The Caesar Salad was overdressed, *but* the anchovy on top was admittedly tasty. Now on to the Octopus, the reason we came.  Half of it was overcooked and half was well-cooked (and boy, was that side yummy).  You can do the butter knife test for yourself to figure this out. If you can't pass a butter knife through, it's overcooked. Now of course, I was disappointed that the thick side was overcooked and told my spouse, ""ugh, it's rubbery again"". The server overheard me, took it back to the cook and then came back and indicated that the cook cut through it and said ""he doesn't think he can cook it any better"". I asked if it was the same cook as when they had originally open, I was told, ""Yes"" (to my surprise). So I guess that means I won't be coming back. But I WILL head to Taverna Kyclades in Astoria in 2 weeks for their **perfectly** cooked Octopus._______________________________________________________________Previous Review - 3 Stars: I lived on Carlton when Lulu & Po opened in 2012 and frequented often at that time.I can still remember the delicious heirloom carrots with yogurt sauce and cumin and the octopus with cilantro jalapeno sauce. My favorite octopus dish in NY is at Taverna Kyclades in Astoria, Queens. I remember thinking that Lulu & Po's octopus was easily #2 best octopus that I had tried in the city. It was juicy and succulent.Lulu & Po was my *spot* that summer. After moving deeper into Clinton Hill, I was unable to visit as often.  So in 2014, I was so excited to come back for the octopus. I was so disappointed because it was completely overcooked and rubbery. Although I realize it may have been a bad cook/fluke - I have not been back. Having said that - I reserve the right to change my rating if I go back and enjoy the octopus again (But I am SO discouraged due to my last visit. I had told the server that the octopus was off. They took the octopus back and did who knows what to it - came back and it was still bad).",2.0
So delicious.  The decor is awesome and food is equally so. Service was top notch and we had a great night.,5.0
The food is good but the service and atmosphere is very snooty and pretentious. I did not have an enjoyable experience navigating the staffs awkward demeanor.,3.0
"1 for service, 2.5-4 for food, 3.5 for atmosphere.Lulu and Po had been on our go to list for quite some time but our timing always seemed to be off when we were in the area as either it was too crowded or we weren't hungry at the time.  We used to love Abistro in this spot and were excited for this new option.Tonight the planets aligned and several tables were free as we were walking by.  They literally shoehorn you into this place and we were squeezed in next to another couple.The waitress seemed nice enough but little did we know that our first encounter with her would be the only encounter until we begged for the check.  She quickly rattled off that people normally order 4-7 dishes and so not being starving we ordered Caesar salad, the burger (since so many people rave about it) WITH fries, and the chicken.  We were going to get the lamb tatare but figured we would see how the other dishes were first.Thinks started off well with the salad, which was solid and very tasty.  After the salad the fries suddenly appeared by themselves so we waited about 5 minutes for the burger, but nothing.  We tried to flag the waitress but despite the place really not being that busy she was impossible to get.  We gave in and slowly ate the fries, but then 15 minutes had passed and as much as I love fries, short of at 2am at a dive bar it is a bit odd to serve fries and not bring out the burger your ordered.After over 15 minutes of our fries getting cold the burger arrived. Like the salad it wasn't delivered by our waitress and no one asked how our food was or more importantly offer clean plates for the very juicy burger (which we clearly indicated we would be splitting).  Instead we had put the burger in the dressing soaked plates from the salad.Of course not 30 seconds after getting the burger the chicken arrives.  So now we have cold fries, a burger, chicken, and the salad dish from 30 minutes earlier on a tiny table. The timing is just horrible in this place.  Even if you ignore the fries sitting out for over 15 minutes, if someone orders all these dishes at once, wouldn't you serve the chicken (which is clearly going to be blander than burger) first?  Alternately why not just bring everything all at once. Okay, so getting back to the food, the burger is very good, but incredibly juicy and messy, which is fine when you have plenty of napkins, but not with one paper napkin and an invisible waitress (I am still sticky hours later).The chicken was super salty and just plain bland after the burger.  They had some sort of pepper ""salsa"" on top that definitely helped but it just was nothing memorable and seemed like something I could have made at home.Getting back to the waitress, it was almost comical how much she was ignoring us as we desperately tried to get our check to put this dinner behind us.  Even once we got the check she didn't ask how the meal was.  Oh wait, at one point she did come to the table and I thought it was because she noticed we need napkins and plates or perhaps a second drink, but instead she said she needed to push our incredibly tight table even closer to the wall.Amazing how a neighborhood place that has character could have such disinterested service that makes you never want to come back.",3.0
"So out all the places in the Fort Green area the got 4.5 stars. This place is okay it's nothing great, they have an regular American new menu with the burger, chicken, fish, and pork chops. I'm not really thrilled. I honestly don't know why this place receive 4.5 stars. There is nothing inventive with this menu.  Also THERE are NO SUBSTITUTIONS, so don't ask. Whatever is on the menu is what you get. I won't be visiting here it has nothing to do with the food, it's just an meh place to me. Le sigh! cause I really wanted something great to eat. After being stuck in the house because of this snow storm. Quddos to the bartender she is on fire. Also the best thing on here is the Burger and the fires, and the Brussels Sprouts. Also the waiter is awesome.",3.0
"I admit, I was a bit skeptical when I walked in to Lulu & Po and it was somewhat empty at 9 pm on a Saturday night. I was also thrown by the wood paneling on the walls. But the food more than made up for any initial concerns - and I don't even like small plates. We ordered the bone marrow tacos, lamb belly, braised escarole, Brussels sprouts, fries, pizza dough and the special that night, fried sardines (by we, I mean my boyfriend ordered that and I looked away - I'm not quite there yet with sardines). This was a fair amount of food and we probably could have skipped on one of the dishes, but everything was so fantastic I'm glad we didn't. The Brussels sprouts were amazing - fried and savory.  We discussed whether or not they were better than Martha's, which are the gold standard of fried sprouts in my opinion. We couldn't reach an agreement on that but in any case, 5 stars. The lamb belly was small and perfectly cooked, but the bone marrow tacos probably stole the show. Though I also really loved the escarole - and the fries!  My boyfriend is a tougher critic than me and all he could say as we cleaned our plates was ""5-stars."" I also appreciated that they actually put real ginger in their Moscow mules - that and the classic 90s/early '00s play list added a nice touch.",5.0
"Great tiny place in Brooklyn. I was there with one other person and ordered 3 small plates: Bone marrow tacos, pizza dough with ricotta and the lamb belly. All three were good, although the lamb belly was the clear favorite. The meat itself was tender, balancing well against the perfectly crisped skin on top. The marrow tacos came with very nice corn tortillas and a tart parsley, caper salad which balanced the ""fattyness"" of the marrow well. The pizza dough was good, while the ricotta and tapenade spread that comes with it was even better.The true star of the meal, however, was the hamburger. We first ordered one to share, later ordering another because it was so good. This was truly one of the best hamburgers I have ever had. The two parties are perfectly cooked and incredibly juicy. The goat cheese and caramelized onions pair perfectly with the meat, and the traditional no-fuss bun gives a home cooked touch.the attached photo does not do it justice.

"AMAZZZZING. Stop in last night for some bites with two friends.  I think we walked in just in time before the evening rush (at about 6:15pm-6:30pm on a Sunday night)Service was great, our server was super sweet and attentive and made great recommendations. One of my friends had already been to Lulu & Po but we tried a few things she hadn't tried in the past.

"Pizza dough was good but the portion was small, even for small plates.Octopus was super delicious-- loved the sauce.Chicken liver--- I was scared by the name of it but it was actually a pretty amazing tasting spread.Bone marrow tacos-- the shell was plain and not too good but you can't go wrong with the bone marrow, the salad the goes with it completes the meal. I love this!!Fish--that was the best dish here. It was perfectly cooked and the sauce was perfect!! Red Italian wine had a smokey flavor, I didn't like that but it was deeply flavored and strong",4.0
"Much like the original Abistro before it, Lulu & Po has given me a good reason to head over to this side of Fort Greene Park. And it's actually much easier now that I'm a Citibikin' fool. With only 24 seats or so, this joint offers a multitude of small plates in a small space, all interesting, and nearly all tasty. We thoroughly enjoyed the chicken liver and pancetta pâté, as well as the roasted carrots, the pizza dough (how could whipped ricotta, olive oil and pesto be bad) and especially the burnt scallion fish. The fregola/lentil concoction wasn't our style, but they can't all be winners.There's a full bar, and I'll never say no to Old Fashioneds or Moscow Mules; the deftness with which they craft the few cocktails on their menu lead me to believe that they could probably make whatever you'd like. It's completely out of character that I didn't rock General Tso's sweetbreads nor the well-liked burger, but I'll be sure to rectify that soon enough.",4.0
"Lulu and Po, hands down, is one of the best restaurants in Brooklyn. Every dish is an absolute treat. My husband and daughter are obsessed with the Spanish octopus, which is served with a beautiful cilantro jalapeno sauce. The burger, topped with caramelized onions and goat cheese, was recently voted best burger in Brooklyn on DNAinfo, and it's absolutely delicious. Lulu and Po is always a wonderful experience.",5.0
"3.5 stars.My gf and I showed up at 7:30p on a Saturday and were lucky we din't have to wait.Cute place, nice music, very chill. Professional service.Spanish octopus: very tender, but lacked flavor.Pork cheeks: so delicate they melted in my mouth; delicious sauce.Lamb belly: too dry, but huge piece.Hamburger: thin double pattie, truly great, well done (keep in mind).Overall: we were quite satisfied with our meal, but didn't find it memorable. Since we don't live around the corner, I doubt we will have any reason to go back anytime soon.",3.0
"Sat outside last night at Lulu & Po and had a simply fabulous dinner.  Given our experience with an attentive staff, refreshing summer cocktails, and brilliantly prepared food I was very surprised to read some of the negative reviews on yelp.  We plan to go back regularly.  With 4 people we sampled many dishes and enjoyed them all. The biggest surprise was the hamburger which I thought was a strange order to place with such a creative kitchen.  Wrong!  Simply the best hamburger I've ever had anywhere!  But don't limit yourself to the burger as good as it is.  The octopus was perfectly cooked.",5.0

"One of the best meals I've had in a long time. Simple and perfect.I went to Lulu & Po on a Saturday night with two friends. We shared six dishes, all of which were delicious: the chicken liver & pancetta pate (which I had been scared would be salty but was perfect, and spreading it over crunchy bread with tangy pickles killed some of the saltiness anyway); the spanish octopus (perfectly cooked, tender and not rubbery, with a great minty, spicy sauce); iron pressed chicken (again, perfectly cooked, large portion, a little lemony); burnt scallion trout (meatier than expected, very flavorful); chopped salad (deceptively simple, with yummy, crunchy fried shallots); and snap peas (buttery, fresh). The wines were great (I had a particularly good rose, a Grenache blend), and I heard from the others that the cocktails were expert as well. Service was lovely, and the dishes were timed well so that we always had something to work on without being overwhelmed. Also, as many others have stated, the space itself is charming -- pretty tiny but it feels really airy and spacious.",5.0
"I thought I was done with writing Yelp reviews but my overwhelming concern that one of my favorite restaurants was about to close due to lack of traffic has sent me back to herald the awesomeness of Lulu & Po (it was nearly empty at 7:30PM on a Friday night).First thing you should know: this place is a schlep to get to, it's tiny and it sits on an intersection with the holy trinity of sketch: a fried chicken joint, a run down looking laundromat, and one of those Chinese take out places with the light up picture menus.The food makes the journey completely worth it though. Everything I've had here has always been fresh, delicious and novel, but not for novelty's sake. The bone marrow tacos are fun and strike a nice balance - the refreshing parsley salad helps cut the richness of essentially meat butter. We also had a burnt scallion Atlantic char that was perfectly cooked. They're taking advantage of the summer produce pretty nicely here as well; both the peaches, tomatoes and burrata and the creamed corn we had were things I want to eat every day in this kind of weather.So... please, please, please.

"Went to Lulu and Po last night with a group of four. There were four seats open at the bar so we opted not to wait for a table. We ordered the pizza dough, lamb belly, and fried Brussel sprouts as appetizers. All were amazing but the Brussels sprouts stole the show.. They are a must get item! For entrees we ordered the burger, pork chop, and langanelle. All excellent! The pork chop took longer than expected so they gave us a free dessert the pot de creme which was very good.  was happy with their meal! I will be going back Very soon!",5.0

"We haven't had one bad item here. Everything is always stupendous and delicious. Every person we have brought here loves it and longs I come back. Burnt scallion fish, chicken, brussel sprouts, burger, fries, gourdo beans, drinks... all consistent. And the music and waitstaff are super chill. A neighborhood staple that I secretly hope nobody discovers, but lord do they enjoy a top-notch review.",5.0
"The cilantro mint jalapeno sauce for the Spanish octopus is addictive. I've never had a whole tentacle before! The pizza dough is served with an amazing dip. It's a delicate balance of ricotta cool with whipped sweetness. Jumbo asparagus drip with creamy gorgonzola. These asparagus are the size of a small child's thigh. Definitely the biggest and juiciest I've ever had. My favorite is the burnt scallion fish. So succulent, you savor every morsel. Simple, elegant decor. Good people. Good music. Good hood. Great place to bring family or friends.",5.0
"In terms of food I would give it 6 stars, everything on the menu is delicious. In terms of service it's awful, the wait staff made us feel so uncomfortable like we were in there way.

"I REALLY wanted to hate this place when it first opened.  First off, obviously, was the obnoxiously twee name, coupled with the fact that its replacing the original Abistro seems to pretty much perfectly represent gentrification in the most whitewashed way possible.  On top of that the menu, with its marquee gimmick of  bone marrow tacos,  at first glance seemed like a carbon copy of any other ""New Brooklyn"" restaurant on any random Brownstone block.        Well as luck would have it the place would wind up being excellent, and only wound up improving on each subsequent visit.  The tacos in fact wound up being in my opinion, one of the fantastic menus shortcomings.  The stars of the show are in fact the perfectly cooked Octopus, with an Indian influenced pesto sauce, the insanely simple and unbelievably addictive pizza dough with house made ricotta.  The french fries are perfectly prepared, as is another New BK Staple, Pork Belly.  There is an Upstate connection to the place somehow, evident by the menu included a exemplary version of the regional specially of ""Utica Greens"", which I have sampled alongside chicken ridgees and tomato pies at the legendary O'scugnizzo's pizza in that fair city.  It is another Upstate homage that is the menus definitive star however, and the dish you must order on any and all visits here;   the Iron pressed Upstate New York firehouse chicken.  Perfectly prepared and unbelievably moist, its one of the cities best chickens, of any preparation.  As with the cuisine, the service steadily improved since the place opened, to the point that is now reliably professional yet relaxed.  The drink list is short but uniformly  excellent.  Wines are perhaps to expensive for the setting and menu.  The Beer list is unforgivable, PLEASE ADD MORE THAN GHASTLY NARRAGANSETT, are you seriously offering that as the sole option at an upscale and sophisticated restaurant?  Other than that unforgivable sin the place is exceptional and one of the better of the countless establishments of its type in the borough.",4.0

"I made the trip from Manhattan because it was recommended by friends.  It was a cold and snowy night but totally worth the trip!!  I started with Brussel sprouts which had been quartered and crisped and then tossed in a sweet chili sauce.  This was so good that it was hard for me to not just order a few more of these and be done.  Then I had a mozzarella melted with anchovies and pine nuts and served with a toasted focaccia bread.  Fabulous!!  Next I had the lamb cheeks rubbed and grilled and served with harissa and yoghurt,  Extraordinary!  I normally don't eat dessert, but decided that the food had been so extraordinary so far that I had to see what they did in that department.  I decided on the peanut butter custard covered with chocolate ganache and crushed salted peanuts.  What a fabulous ending!  Washed it all down with an excellent sparkling wine.  This is a true gem.  Ate at many highly lauded restaurants in Manhattan and none compared with this place.  Don't miss it!  (Oh, forgot to mention that service was wonderful.)",5.0

The crostini that night were persimmon and goat cheese, and I believe kale, and they were the best crostini I have ever had. The friend anchovies were very good, with a great sauce. The bone marrow tacos were good and interesting, and really fun to eat. The creamy polenta was not my thing, but my boyfriend is from the south and said it was delicious, as he finished that up.

"5  stars for the octopus.  Seriously, it was amazing.  I'm an octopus fan, and will generally enjoy even a chewy piece of octopus, but this was like no octopus I've had: tender and deliciously grilled.  The cilantro mint jalapeno sauce that accompanied it was also amazing.We also had the pizza dough, which was tasty and had a nice salty kick around the edges.  I'm sure the ricotta-pesto that accompanied it was tasty also, but I still had some of the aforementioned cilantro mint jalapeno sauce leftover, and there was no way I was going to let that go to waste.  (It was awesome on the pizza dough.)We also had the summer beans, which were green beans and wax beans (I think, I'm not the best at identifying bean varieties) with feta, onion, and jalapeno.  They were so much more delicious than I expected, and the portion was quite good-sized.My boyfriend had eaten a late lunch, so he wasn't particularly hungry -- if he had been, we probably would have ordered another plate.  Just as well that we didn't, as it gives us more of an opportunity to come back and try more!",5.0
Wonderful well prepared food. Octopus was superb. Huge piece and grilled to perfection. Lamb tartare with chips was such a well conceived dish. The Crudo was perfectly cut and well paired.

"Don't go if you're hungry. I'll start there. Well, you could but you'd be spending a pretty penny.

I've spent time in the Mediterranean coast and Europe in general, parts of Latin America, etc. and these people wouldn't believe me if I told them a mere single tentacle of one of their favorite dishes was $14! Absurd! And don't tell me you can't get that here in NY, cause you can. Four small pieces of sweetbreads for $13, a couple of beats for $7. C'mon!Look, everything tasted great.

"One of those cool, little, eclectic spots making Clinton Hill  a special area to live in. I wish they had a few more beers, but the Moscow Mule I had hit the spot on a steamy summer night. We tried almost everything on the menu, literally. Prices are cheap, but it adds up because portions are a few bites between two so you will want to get a bunch of things. Everything was fresh, well made and presented with a rustic artistry. Highlights were the crudo (sushi grade fluke and so fresh), the pizza dough, Spanish octopus (tentacles for days and absolutely perfectly cooked), the French fries, and the brook trout scallion fish. Basically everything was a highlight. It's the kind of spot you want to spend some time, have some drinks, and bring friends to fully experience a very authentic Brooklyn gem.",4.0

But these are SMALL PLATES. When we spend over $100 for dinner and we walk out hungry, there's a problem. The Bone Marrow Tacos came with three tortillas but there was barely enough marrow to make two tacos. The Sweetbread portion should be doubled. The Octopus was two tentacles.The beets and the pizza dough - the cheaper ingredient plates - were a generous portion, unsurprisingly.

I only had two bites since I was sharing with others, but would be a sufficient appetizer for one. - bone marrow tacos, parsley, cilantro, grilled tortillas: did not enjoy these. Maybe I just don't appreciate bone marrow, but it just tasted like grease. The tacos were kind of dry as well.- chicken liver & pancetta pâté, grilled bread, pickles: pate was very good, but bread was too oily- seasonal crostini: I think it had kale and duck ham. Good but not very memorable. - had a bite of the burger and it was solid, would recommend. - lavender soda: unremarkable.I enjoyed most of the food I tried but found it all to be a bit overpriced and greasy.

I've never had fish prepared in that manner but it was unique and delicious-blackened fish over a slightly sweet puree, covered in crispy, burnt scallions.

Everything my friend and I ordered was delicious. We had the kale & persimmon salad and the mozzerella to start. Next up was the most decadent delicata squash with brown butter, followed by the branzino. This was the market fish of the day, and it was my favorite dish of the night: a perfectly cooked and fileted piece of fish topped with crispy shallots with a savory sauce so flavorful and tender it practically melted in our mouths. We finished up with the laganelle, which is similar to papardelle but with longer and wider noodles. Unbelievably good with shitake mushrooms and butternut squash puree.The plates are really small, which is okay because it gives the opportunity to taste a lot of different dishes.

A very good set of small plates here on 14 August. Great service. But they need to get past the cash only thing.,4.0
"Amazing! The food here was terrific try there pizza dough, pork cheeks or lamb! The lamb was the best I've ever had....love this gem in my neighborhood.",4.0
"Utterly astonishing. My favorite restaurant in New York. Suggestion? Cauliflower + grilled octopus, FTW",5.0
"Bone marrow tacos - yum! Just when I think I've tried every possible scenario of meat wrapped in a tortilla, a restaurant like Lulu & Po comes along and surprises me.These babies are the gem and require self-assembly. Bone marrow comes out as it should -- still in the bone. Warm tortillas and a few other dressings are also on the plate.With bone marrow a little goes a long way, so you don't need much. What you get is a rich morsel, dripping with flavor.We tried several other plates as well. The the pork tenderloin (delicious -- served with stewed apricots), wax beans (not my favorite), the heirloom tomatoes (OK), were a few that stick out in my mind.Drink menu was good -- Moscow Mule!A great little neighborhood spot in Fort Greene.",4.0

"This place is a culinary knockout.  The food was AMAZING.The f-ing octopus was out of this world.  So were the lentils (yes, sounds boring--sooooo not).  The pork belly and burnt scallion fish were also standouts.  I wouldn't say the pizza dough or greens were amazing, but that's only because the caliber of everything else was so incredible.  Now, be real: if you are going to a place with small plates, you need to order a bunch of stuff.  You shouldn't leave here hungry if you come prepared.  We had 7 dishes between the two of us, including two of the ""entrees"" and we were satisfied (though we did go for ice cream afterward).  Wine list is good, with a few unusual things, which always delights me.  The service was kind of strange.  She was totally nice and we had no problems with her at all, but she was extremely apologetic for what she thought was inattentiveness.  So, we felt like we had to reassure her a lot, letting her know that she was doing fine.  Obviously, this is not a big deal--I mean, she wanted to make sure she was giving us what we needed--but was odd.Anyway, the food here is every bit up to the hype.  Experience it.",5.0

"This was a great place to have dinner before a show at BAM. I loved the intimate space, the open windows and the open kitchen. It is a small space however, so prepare to get cozy with your neighbors!We shared the octopus, avocado, sugar snap peas and chicken. My favorite was probably the snap peas, which was wonderfully fresh and light, while still flavorful and rich. I also really enjoyed the avocado - I hadn't thought I'd have a new way to experience an avocado, but the peanuts and heat were a nice surprise. I also enjoyed my glass of gewurztraminer, which was very reasonably priced and delicious.",5.0
"Lulu & Po is a fantastic little spot, the food is great and creative, bone marrow tacos?We love the pizza dough, was amazing with Lebneh but also good with the pesto it is now served with.I recommend a trip here if you aren't super hungry, it's a pretty great price for a small meal, if you are hungry I recommend the burger!So far I haven't seen it crowded, always just right!",5.0

"I live just around the corner, and have been keeping an eye out for this place to open for the last couple months, was delighted to finally try it.First, The Pros:- Great decor. Interesting and creative light fixtures, especially liked the attention to the details. Adorable tiny space.- The server was attentive (especially with the water - it was super hot out, which I'll get to in a minute)- We had the fresh avocado with olive oil, peanuts and creme fraiche, which was awesome ($7). Then the clams with pork sausage ($17) and the beef tongue ($11). All of the food was excellent. Really interesting menu. There were a lot of things I wanted to try, which is always a good sign. It was all reasonably priced.Just a couple of cons:- It was friggin hot as hell in there. I don't know if they don't have air, or if it wasn't on, but it was brutally warm. honestly, that's the reason it only gets 4 stars. Even with 3 bottles of water, we were just sweltering.- The server wasn't knowledgable about the wine list at all. She was super nice and brought me tastes of the two wines I asked about, but I think that was because she couldn't tell me about them.- Cash only is a drag. I understand it's common, but still annoying.Overall, had a lovely meal. The food and the place itself was excellent. It would have been better if the temperature wasn't so uncomfortable.Will be back on an evening that isn't quite so hot out!",4.0
We ate seven items off the menu and enjoyed each one very much--the octopus and fish dishes were the favorites. We were extremely happy with the service and atmosphere. There was no bullsh*t or hype in the presentation or service. A great meal in a nice atmosphere. We will go back.,4.0

"Awesome, awesome, awesome.  The ambiance speaks for itself.  I won't go into detail here, but think very small and personal. I'll include a special shout-out to the fact that you can see the only two kitchen workers serving up every dish in the restaurant.As avid appetizer, small plate, and tapas fans, my girlfriend and I had some pretty high expectations.  This place lived up.We ordered four dishes between the two of us:We had the peach and tomato with mozzarella first.  The sweet-and-salty combination was on-point, with mozzarella as fresh and tasty as I've ever had.  It was a pretty generous portion of Mozzarella as well, not what I expected after reading comments from yelp detractors.Then came the pizza dough.  The dough was crispy on the outside and perfectly fluffy on the inside, and this time the ricotta cheese played moderator to the dish's salty doughy base.  Again, a fantastic combination.Third, the bone marrow tacos arrived.  This is the only dish we had that I may recommend avoiding. The greens that top the tacos are great, but they do overpower the meat. And though we don't arrive to a place like this looking to leave stuffed, the portion is particularly small.  If I didn't love everything else so much, I might have inserted a joke here about three tortillas for the portion of meat.  I did enjoy the taste, but my girlfriend actually did not, a definite rarity.Finally, the pork belly quickly made me forget any problems with the tacos.  This was a life-changing dish, with pork belly that ranged from crunchy charred skin to completely tender, sweet meat - truly delicious pork.Don't expect this place to be something it's not, arriving at your appetite's end. (We supplemented ours with some wine and cheese at home before coming.)  But do expect Lulu and Po to wow you with a spectacular small plate menu.",5.0
We had probably half of the items on the menu and loved them all! I especially liked the mozzarella and the pizza dough. My husband loved the Utica greens and the half chicken.,5.0
"Great flavors. I agree that the portions aren't huge, and the prices could be lower for Brooklyn, but that's all that's keeping this from getting 5-stars. Drinks are great, service is great, vibe is excellent--open kitchen, yet it's not in your face. Bone marrow tacos are very nice--portions are small, but to me, that's OK for rich food such as that.If they have the branzino special with the green sauce, it's a must. Also, bonus points for the faulking ace music.",4.0
"Been to Lulu & Po 3x...going again tonight. Its actually been closer to 5 stars when I've gone with a group of 4 (definitely the way to go) and 4 stars when its been just 2 of us. I base that on just the sheer variety you can get when with a larger group and Oh My Lord & Taylor!! When we went as a group, we must have ordered 3/4 of the menu! The Lamb Breast and Iron Pressed Chicken are to die for, the french fries are ridic as were many of the more veg dishes. Service is good, relaxed. Wine list is varied and reasonably priced as I define it, and the cocktails are tasty. And yes the place is super small but the noise level is not that bad when crowded. Go early or be prepared to wait as you'll most likely have to go somewhere else for a drink or 2 while you wait somewhere close like Chez Lola. They will call you on your cell as soon as your table is available. Cheers!",4.0
"Vegetarian Review:YUUUUMMMMMMMIt was all small delicious plates. We thoroughly enjoyed a bottle of La Stoppa '04 Cabernet. Life is good when your spouse knows about wine! First, we ate grilled pizza dough with whipped ricotta and really delish olive oil. It is 2 warm grilled flat pieces of dough with a little bowl of ricotta for dipping or spreading. Soon, our fresh mozzarella with brown butter croutons and sweet red pepper relish. The mozzarella was really milky and good, and contrasted nicely with the super crunchy croutons and surprisingly sweet relish. Next, we enjoyed the baby gem salad with candied walnuts and red onion. So simple, but the lettuce is so crisp and refreshing, really excellent produce. As far as vegetarians are concerned, you can tell the quality of a chef by the quality of his produce. Then we had a soupy dish of lentils with fregola, a great pasta that doesn't get enough play. Fregola is little toasted balls of semolina with a nice chew. The lentils and fregola were topped with a little dollop of super tasty romesco sauce. As we waited for our utica greens, which was to be our fourth and last dish, we felt like we wanted a fifth dish, so we ordered the polenta. I am so glad we did. The polenta was creamy and tasty with a beautiful chunk of gorgonzola on top. This went so well with the La Stoppa Cabernet!!!! I die. The utica greens normally come with pancetta, but they accommodated my request to leave it out. The greens were tender and tasty! With a super generous cover of pecorino and fresh black pepper, and in a really flavorful broth. Again, back to the quality of the produce.We we sooo full! Each of the dishes only cost like $7 or $8 or $9, so the food was super affordable. Its easy to splurge on $95 when you dinner costs less than $50! I mean, HELLO! I am so glad we ventured into this new little place! I especially love how we never felt rushed, the pacing was great. I can't wait to dine there again! They are now accepting credit cards.",5.0

Super tender, yummy octopus - one huge tentacle (very fairly priced in our opinion) . . .and the pressed firehouse chicken was amazingly tasty and juicy. Salad, lentils, pizza dough with ricotta and Meyer lemon tart were all very delicious.  Our only problem was there were far more dishes we wanted to try, than we were able to.  Will definitely be back!  BTW ... 5 dishes for two and one shared dessert left us comfortably full!",4.0
This place is one of the best restaurants that I have tried since moving to Brooklyn. Love the atmosphere. Cool lighting fixtures.  Cool decor all around.  Great staff. The food was incredible.

"Lulu & Po is an incredibly well kept secret! I've gone many times and I've always gotten excellent food and service.  Their lentils with romesco, beens with feta, fish with charred shallots, and peach salad with mozzarella are all AMAZING dishes. I also love that you normally don't need to wait in order to get a table. Apparently great food without a wait is possible in NYC!!",5.0
"When I see menus like these in restaurants, I want to get excited but I worry they may be in over their heads. This is a very ambitious creative menu with a lot of homemade or experimental elements. But they scored perfect 10s on all of the small plates they brought out. The highlights are the chutney that goes with the pork belly (as well as the pork belly itself). The bone marrow tacos are great. The octopus simple but lovely. The mozzarella, new to the menu, on sauteed garlic, tender and understated. The only issue (if you want to even call it that) is that the waitress said 2-3 plates per person would make a meal. No way. 1-2 per person is more than enough. We over ordered a bit. They also have a great wine list. This is a pretty restaurant, friendly, worth the price (which is reasonable if you follow my 1-2 plan). This is a little gem in our neighborhood (well, a 15 minute walk) and we are definitely going back. I left off a star because I am trying to reserve 5 stars for meals that completely blow me away, (like the tacos from that alley in Coney Island. I'm not kidding. See my other reviews for that one.)Overall, this restaurant is what going out to eat is for: experiencing dishes you don't make at home. I'm sick of going out to eat a subpar bowl of something that I make 10x better (fresher too) myself at home. This was not one of those times! Go!",4.0
"Lovely addition to the neighborhood. Loved that they took our phone number to call us when our table was ready! It's small so expect a wait on weekends. Slightly eclectic menu but most everything we had was good! We went for the bone marrow tacos, and while it was good to try them, I wouldn't get them again. Nice wine selection but wish they'd offer more cocktails. Overall though, service was good, and will definitely be back :)",4.0
"Have been to Lulu & Po twice now. AcrossFood: The 2 visits we had maybe 12 dishes (most the menu is of small plates). I'd say that 11 of the 12 were so good we'd order them again without a second thought. Lots of fresh ingredients and flavors. Lots of unexpected combinations. Lots of yummy, yummy, yummy.   Service & Atmosphere:Laid back and chill. It's a timy room so you can always catch the waitstaff's eye. Water was constantly refilled. We went once for our wedding anniversary and had the place to ourselves for the first half of the night and then the room filled up around us. The second time we brought our 5 month baby and they were perfectly accepting and accomodating.Decor: Standard charming Brooklyn ""Hey Kids, Let's Open up a Restaurant!""My only concern? That either business won't pick up and they'll go under... or business will pick up and we won't be able to get a table so easily. ;-)",5.0
"Went here yesterday for dinner with my father & had a really nice time. We each ordered a glass of wine and a bowl of the soup of the day (something along the lines of corn with pesto served chilled). Then we got four of the small plates to share: beets with pecans & Greek yogurt, peach and heirloom tomatoes with mozzarella, fettuccine with sage and mushrooms, & warm pizza dough with ricotta and pesto. I was really impressed with their vegetarian options. No complaints about the food. My dad and I were both full & quite happy with the meal. Friendly service, too. Cute, small space, but I sat up against the window and a nailhead from the brickwork kept poking me in the back.",4.0
"Homey meal. The taste was great, but nothing out of this world. The highlight was definitely the ricotta with warm bread...Ordered the cider drink special which was absolutely delicious!

"Lulu & Po has become my neighborhood go-to, and even with the rising count of new establishments in Fort Greene, hangs on strongly to the number one spot.  The menu is creatively ambitious, and does not fall victim to the recently rising trap of trying to do everything just OK without doing anything really great.  The pizza dough alone compels me to bring everyone I can think of (out of town guests and fellow neighbors) for a taste.This place does small really really well.  The actual space is intimate, but not romantic, and the purpose and focus that goes into the ambiance and cuisine constantly impresses me.  The menu has changed since it opened in May (I'm partial to the peach and heirloom salad, the aforementioned pizza dough and pesto, and the octopus) and incorporates the best of what the season has to offer.Finally, though perhaps as important, the drink list is everything it needs to be without sacrificing originality or quality for quantity.  While limited, there is truly a cocktail for everyone on this menu.In short - check it out, don't be surprised if you have to wait (they'll take your cell and call when a table is ready), and eat and drink with patience and appreciation.  It's worth it.",5.0

"Back to yelp with a five star! whoopLoved Lulu & Po.Cozy but airy. Cool but not hip. I stupidly stuck with beer as my friends sampled the cocktail specials - - blackberry margaritas [tart but yum] and a refreshing peachy wine thing .. Actually peaches were the food item of the day. They appeared in various guises throughout the meal. There were 5 of us and we shared everything - it's a small plates thing - highlights were:deep fried anchovies - crispy and tasty and served with an assertive sriracha tartar sauce .tomato and mozz.  salad - I don't know what they did - and this item is usually a meh for me - but the tomatoes tasted so good . Like tomatoes should taste - not like the usual over refrigerated blargh. Or maybe it was the peaches,The wax beans and feta - Awesome - one of my friends was waxing lyrical about the flavor profile as I quietly finished the plate.Beets - awesome again  - perfectly cooked - sweet and tasty.PORK TENDERLOIN WITH PICKLED PEACHES- yes I'm shouting - glorious. The best thing I have eaten in months. Such a simple thing - delicious ingredients beautifully prepared.There were other plates - but these were my faves. That and the chocolate pot de creme - perfect punctuation to a great meal.Service was aces - It's a small place and for a monday night it seemed buzzing but even so our server was attentive and smart and helpful.Great evening - one of my friends has found their new local spot.Can't wait to go back - there are so many other dishes I want to try.Go now - for the summer green market goodies.",5.0

The only issue (if you want to even call it that) is that the waitress said 2-3 plates per person would make a meal. No way. 1-2 per person is more than enough. We over ordered a bit. They also have a great wine list. This is a pretty restaurant, friendly, worth the price (which is reasonable if you follow my 1-2 plan). This is a little gem in our neighborhood (well, a 15 minute walk) and we are definitely going back. I left off a star because I am trying to reserve 5 stars for meals that completely blow me away, (like the tacos from that alley in Coney Island. I'm not kidding. See my other reviews for that one.)Overall, this restaurant is what going out to eat is for: experiencing dishes you don't make at home. I'm sick of going out to eat a subpar bowl of something that I make 10x better (fresher too) myself at home. This was not one of those times! Go!",4.0
"Lovely addition to the neighborhood. Loved that they took our phone number to call us when our table was ready! It's small so expect a wait on weekends. Slightly eclectic menu but most everything we had was good! We went for the bone marrow tacos, and while it was good to try them, I wouldn't get them again. Nice wine selection but wish they'd offer more cocktails. Overall though, service was good, and will definitely be back :)",4.0
"Have been to Lulu & Po twice now. AcrossFood: The 2 visits we had maybe 12 dishes (most the menu is of small plates). I'd say that 11 of the 12 were so good we'd order them again without a second thought. Lots of fresh ingredients and flavors. Lots of unexpected combinations. Lots of yummy, yummy, yummy.   Service & Atmosphere:Laid back and chill. It's a timy room so you can always catch the waitstaff's eye. Water was constantly refilled. We went once for our wedding anniversary and had the place to ourselves for the first half of the night and then the room filled up around us. The second time we brought our 5 month baby and they were perfectly accepting and accomodating.Decor: Standard charming Brooklyn ""Hey Kids, Let's Open up a Restaurant!""My only concern? That either business won't pick up and they'll go under... or business will pick up and we won't be able to get a table so easily. ;-)",5.0
"Went here yesterday for dinner with my father & had a really nice time. We each ordered a glass of wine and a bowl of the soup of the day (something along the lines of corn with pesto served chilled). Then we got four of the small plates to share: beets with pecans & Greek yogurt, peach and heirloom tomatoes with mozzarella, fettuccine with sage and mushrooms, & warm pizza dough with ricotta and pesto. I was really impressed with their vegetarian options. No complaints about the food. My dad and I were both full & quite happy with the meal. Friendly service, too. Cute, small space, but I sat up against the window and a nailhead from the brickwork kept poking me in the back.",4.0
"Homey meal. The taste was great, but nothing out of this world. The highlight was definitely the ricotta with warm bread...Ordered the cider drink special which was absolutely delicious! Tables are quite small, and the crying baby and children running around  the restaurant kind of ruined the atmosphere.",4.0
"Lulu & Po has become my neighborhood go-to, and even with the rising count of new establishments in Fort Greene, hangs on strongly to the number one spot.  The menu is creatively ambitious, and does not fall victim to the recently rising trap of trying to do everything just OK without doing anything really great.  The pizza dough alone compels me to bring everyone I can think of (out of town guests and fellow neighbors) for a taste.This place does small really really well.  The actual space is intimate, but not romantic, and the purpose and focus that goes into the ambiance and cuisine constantly impresses me.  The menu has changed since it opened in May (I'm partial to the peach and heirloom salad, the aforementioned pizza dough and pesto, and the octopus) and incorporates the best of what the season has to offer.Finally, though perhaps as important, the drink list is everything it needs to be without sacrificing originality or quality for quantity.  While limited, there is truly a cocktail for everyone on this menu.In short - check it out, don't be surprised if you have to wait (they'll take your cell and call when a table is ready), and eat and drink with patience and appreciation.  It's worth it.",5.0
"Beautiful season dishes, prepared perfectly.  Sweetbreads are a standout.  It's a tight space and can feel a bit cramped when full to capacity, but normally it is an excellent neighborhood spot.",5.0
"The perfect go-to neighborhood spot.  Super warm and welcoming space, friendly staff.  I've been twice already and sampled many of the menu items and they're all spectacular.  Everything is fresh and seasonal and totally accessible.  Great for a large meal or a late-night small bite with a cocktail.  Matt is a beast in the kitchen and the love he puts into his dishes really shows.",5.0
"Back to yelp with a five star! whoopLoved Lulu & Po.Cozy but airy. Cool but not hip. I stupidly stuck with beer as my friends sampled the cocktail specials - - blackberry margaritas [tart but yum] and a refreshing peachy wine thing .. Actually peaches were the food item of the day. They appeared in various guises throughout the meal. There were 5 of us and we shared everything - it's a small plates thing - highlights were:deep fried anchovies - crispy and tasty and served with an assertive sriracha tartar sauce .tomato and mozz.  salad - I don't know what they did - and this item is usually a meh for me - but the tomatoes tasted so good . Like tomatoes should taste - not like the usual over refrigerated blargh. Or maybe it was the peaches,The wax beans and feta - Awesome - one of my friends was waxing lyrical about the flavor profile as I quietly finished the plate.Beets - awesome again  - perfectly cooked - sweet and tasty.PORK TENDERLOIN WITH PICKLED PEACHES- yes I'm shouting - glorious. The best thing I have eaten in months. Such a simple thing - delicious ingredients beautifully prepared.There were other plates - but these were my faves. That and the chocolate pot de creme - perfect punctuation to a great meal.Service was aces - It's a small place and for a monday night it seemed buzzing but even so our server was attentive and smart and helpful.Great evening - one of my friends has found their new local spot.Can't wait to go back - there are so many other dishes I want to try.Go now - for the summer green market goodies.",5.0
"Ate here for the the first time tonight and it quickly has jumped to the top of our favorite Fort Greene restaurants.   The cooking was just perfect -- absolutely fresh ingredients with simple tasty accompaniments and sauces.   Favorites were the snap peas with mint,  the grilled octopus, and the roast carrot dish.  The dark chocolate pot au creme was yummy.   Great vibe to the place -- chef/owner Matt is super friendly and it's the kind of neighborhood place where you expect to see people you know.",5.0
"Pricey for appetizer portions but the food is good.  Their dishes have unique flavors so if u are looking for something different, I highly recommend this place.",4.0
"The neighborhood needed this perfect little spot so badly. It's cozy, it's unpretentious, it's a great value, and the food is just phenomenal. Literally not one thing we wouldn't order again -- and we ordered a lot: the corn succotash; the tomatoes with butter; the pizza dough with ricotta (sounds boring, but one of the best small plates I've had in recent memory); a lovely little wedge of cheese; the spicy avocados; the fettucini with shitaki mushrooms; the chicken (phenomenal) and the burger (outrageous). The best part is that the food is as good a value as it is delicious. I feel so lucky to have this around the block -- and I was skeptical. For those of you who knew and loved A Bistro, this spot had big shoes to fill -- and fill them they did indeed. And more.",5.0
Pleasantly satisfied. Sat at the bar right away on a Friday night (given how small it is I was happy) and everything was fantastic. I wasn't a huge fan of the marrow tacos but it has more to do with me than the food. Would definitely go again.,5.0
"Cocktails: Perfectly handcrafted and delicious. Food: simple small plates and delicious. Asparagus: yes. ""Pizza bread"": yes. Octopus: yes. Burger: yes. Everything we tasted was close to perfect. All in a great, lively transformation of that small abistro space.",5.0
"My wife and I and two friends ate at Lulu and Po last night and had a great time.  Very fun, casual atmosphere and the staff was friendly and helpful suggesting the wine and explaining the menu.  We ordered lots of different things to share - except my friend had the bone marrow tacos to himself and my wife ordered the beets for herself.  Fried anchovies and General Tso's sweetbreads were perfect shares to start and we got two orders of the delicious octopus. I think we ordered 9 dishes between the 4 of us plus three desserts and went through a couple of bottles of wine - we were obviously having a lot of fun.",5.0
Awesome neighborhood place. I almost don't want to review it on yelp so I can have it all to myself. So delicious. Will be here again.,5.0
