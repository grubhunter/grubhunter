"LOVE THIS PLACE. SO happy I live nearby to it. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala with a side of coconut  (naan, pouri--I always forget which one since it doesn't actually say coconut on the menu). The CTM was amazing. The chicken was cooked great, no surprise grizzle pieces, juicy. The sauce is perfectly creamy and well-seasoned/flavored.The coconut  (?) is my favourite thing to eat, and I'd definitely get it from this place. I could eat plates of it.The place itself is nice. Very simple and warm. A nice intimate feeling, even during the day. Service was great (though when I asked if they had coconut naan the waiter was a bit rude in explaining which one it was because I said I wasn't sure since it didn't say it on the menu. It was just explained in a ""this one, duh"" kind of way. Trust me if I had known I would've just said that one and saved the hassle of looking like an idiot.) Other than that, it really was a great experience.I've ordered out and their delivery is just as good as in there. My boyfriend ordered the Curry Salmon and he just about died for it. Also, he's never tried Indian food prior to this and he was very satisfied and eager to try more. Overall, two thumbs up!",5.0
"Pretty good but nothing to write home about...I do like the food from Asya, my only issue with it is, it is very much an americanized ""Indian Food"" experience rather than offering up food that happens to be in the style of the way food is prepared in India. IMO these dishes are purposefully made with extra sugar and little or no 'heat' so as to appease the perceived American palate. Similar perhaps, to Chinese restaurants in 'The Hood' that offer not much more than General Tso's and Chicken Wings with hot sauce... The food here IS tasty, good quality and great portion sizes but I believe it lacks some authenticity and truer spice levels.If the kitchen brigade was originally trained by an Indian lady who brought her recipes from the old country, I would recommend that management have her come back in and re-tweak the recipes or re-train the kitchen staff to get things back to (at least vaguely similar) to the way they used to taste in India. However, I believe it is more likely that an Indian man (btw Indian men do NOT traditionally cook in their culture) conveyed these recipes and IMO they seriously need an old indian grandmother's authentic touch to make things taste as they should.",3.0
"In a word, no. Stopped in for the $10 weekend buffet on Sunday. Minimal selection of dishes, but no biggie since that's a great deal. When we walked in, the man working front of house was at the host station and busy with his head down. He didn't look up but we took our seats and then waited. In a small, dead quiet dining room it started to get weird when we weren't acknowledged within five minutes (even with a raise of the head or eye contact). When the man on duty (owner?) continued to ignore not just us, but a ringing phone, I decided to just get up and ask if we could start at the buffet. He was curt, but said we could. He came by to fill water glasses but ignored my boyfriend trying to order a drink. So, the food. The tastes weren't bad, but nothing out of the ordinary. But there were some quality control issues:-Hair in two different dishes (maybe from not having a sneeze guard?)-Chicken Tikka with raw chicken-Naan that was raw dough in the middle-Food was cold, as in room temp. I asked the employee if the sterno beneath them was on (didn't look like it). He didn't reply but walked over to look and then came back a few minutes later with new sterno and began to light/position them, but it looked like he had no clue what he was doing. Nobody ever checked in with us, rice wasn't refilled until it was just a few grains left and we had to get up and find the guy in order to figure out how to pay. The overall feeling was ""I hate running a restaurant and I resent you for being here."" Not a fun way to spend an afternoon lunch. Based on the Health Department's B grade on the window, that was on a curve. Give your money to restaurateurs who actually like people and/or food.",1.0
"Overall a pretty decent upscale Indian restaurant. I am personally a bigger fan of some other local Indian places, but this one has by far the best ambiance.The food is quite expensive, but is tasty and has large portion sizes. The black daal is my favorite dish there, and it is one of the best in Brooklyn.Mango lassi is quite good, but has a lot of ice.Decent, but expensive. A better place to take a first date than other Indian restaurants with much worse decor and ambiance.",3.0
"We eat here often as its the only decent Indian restaurant in the neighborhood. The food is consistent and good. They do 50% off lunch special so it's a good deal, however, the portions are small so at dinner time when its not half off it would be a ripoff.",4.0
"I really wanted to like it. My husband and I stopped in and ordered the samosa (they were ok) then I got vegetable korma and he got lamb korma. The sauce was extremely watered down with little spice or curry flavor, we didn't even finish half our meal. The only things left empty were the samosa plates and our mango lassi. I hate giving bad reviews, it takes a lot for me to take the time to write reviews at all, good or bad. For me to review I have to love it or really not enjoyed it at all but I also want to be honest when I'm disappointed in the money spent.",2.0
"I placed an order for delivery. Chicken tikka, rice, naan, and iced coffee. Not only did it take 1 hour and 22 mins for the delivery, whoever packed the bag put the coffee inside, and it spilled, naturally, over all of the food. They wouldn't replace my order nor give me a refund. Terrible customer service! I can't comment on the food, obviously. I will never order from here again.",1.0
"I never understood why my side of Brooklyn has practically no Indian food and I had to always go to the city, but now who cares I found Asya. The interior is intimate and nice, and the service is great.The food:-Goat Korma: Very different then the typical one I get, a bit sweeter and some other different flavors, but delicious and a must for sure-Chicken Tikka Masala: Excellent, flavorful and creamy, chicken was very moist-Paneer appetizer: Great portion and good flavorsAnd of course garlic naan is always a mustWill definitely be my new go to for Indian",4.0
"I came here in a terrible mood, having just broken half my nail off, and the lovely service and food really saved my day. First of all, I came in for Lunch, mainly to see if the rumors about the insanely great lunch special were true--and they are! 50% off everything on the menu AND you get the same size portions! Lunch runs from 11:30-3:30 FYI. To start off I ordered the Manchurian Cauliflower, which like other reviewers have noted is basically General Tsos Cauliflower. Main differences are instead of a gloppy, corn starch-y sauce, its very much so a chutney with fiery red chilis & ginger. Additionally, the cauliflower is not at all breaded. The dish isn't spicy, although there is a nice lingering heat to it and the flavor is strong. Personally, this wouldn't be something I would eat every single time, but if you're in the neighborhood (Or not, that's cool too) it's definitely something to try. The dish should be shared between two people for an appetizer, if you order it for an entree then by all means have at it! For my main dish I got Chicken Tikka Masala with a side of Garlic Naan. The naan was everything i need garlic naan to be, fluffy yet crunchy with a smooth garlic topping & flavor. The Chicken Tikka Masala was perfect--its hard to go wrong with this dish in general, however certain places make it too sweet or not spicy enough, Asya has a perfect balance. Although the entree portions may look deceivingly small (as is the norm in many Indian restaurants) they stuff in a lot of food, and the portions are perfect for one person. I finished mine entirely (a rare instance!) with just the right amount of fullness. Basmati rice was perfectly fluffy. In the future I probably want to try some of their flavored rices--I saw a coconut mint one on the menu that sounds mouthwatering. Service was perfect, my water glass was refilled whenever it was close to being empty, and waiters were always close by in case I asked for anything. I had to ask for chutneys, don't know if that's usual here but make sure you do so, the tamarind especially was great. The ambiance was what really set me on this place, its a very calm and relaxing place, and I would definitely recommend eating in instead of takeout if you have the time. (Also because the 50% off lunch special is only in store, I believe if you order in the restaurant for carryout you get 25% off.) As a current frequenter of the many Pakistani/Indian restaurants of Coney Island Ave, those places still have a place in my heart, but I'll definitely go to Asya whenever I need calmer environment, plush seating, and calm swaying Indian music playing. Oh, and there's also outside seating but I don't know how long the weather will be good enough for that to be of use lol. The grand total for this near gut-busting feast--$13. Seriously, I was surprised as well. In conclusion, Asya is a friendly restaurant with delicious Indian staples as well as a fewer hard to find gems set in a relaxing environment--all for prices that are reasonable on their base price, and a steal during Lunch.",5.0
"AsyaGirl, where have you been all my life?Easily the best Indian I have  tasted in a very long time, although I can only only speak for their delivery. Order the Prefix option for $15 and you receive an appetizer, entrée, basmati rice, naan, and a selection of 4 chutneys. Great bang for your buck. I tasted the samosa- flaky pastry filled with potato and peas resting on curried chick peas. I enjoyed the Aloo Papri- a medley of potato, chickpeas and crispy wafers and chutneys. The chicken korma boasts huge chunks of breast meat chicken, moist and gorgeous in an almond cream sauce.  The chicken curry which has just enough heat, is balanced, bursting with flavor and oh so comforting. Delivery was exponentially quick, the food arrived piping hot and the generous portions fed me and my guest two meals for two days.  Dare I say the leftovers tasted even better the next day? They sure did...wow-yum-nom-burp-scuse me....",5.0

"After walking by Asya a few times, I finally decided to order one day for dinner. The price fixe menu, in my opinion, is perfectly portioned and priced for what you are getting.

The channa masala that the samosas were accompanied by was a very nice touch. Mango chutney is on POINT! Friendly service, great food, great price point. I can't wait to actually go in and sit down for dinner!",5.0
Asya atmosphere is pretty romantic. The staff are really nice and would make certain dishes that's not on the menu (I have asked for chilli chicken which is not on the menu and they totally made it)The food is pretty good.

The chicken tiki and the chili chicken was also full of flavor and the white rice that it came with the dishes was Sooo yummy.The naan are pretty large... You can share one naan with about 3 people. It was soft and also really good.Overall I would recommend this place to anyone who like Indian food.,5.0

"Asya is a delicious Indian Restaurant in a neighborhood that needed it. I've been here a few times now and each time the food is absolutely delicious. The crispy okra salad is a wonderful dish that is very well dressed and doesn't have even a hint of slime (always a danger with okra). The Cauliflower Manchurian is crispy and flavorful. I'm not going to bother listing each dish, but so far we've gone through a third of the menu with no disappointments. Just as good as the food are the condiments. The dipping sauces that come with the papadum are some of the best I've had. The Raita is more complex and full of flavor than other places I've tried. The delivery range is very generous and so far has been quick. The portions for delivery seem to be larger than the in house portions so what you lose out on in ambiance you make up for with tasty food. There is some room for improvement. They don't seem to have a liquor license so do drinks (though I suspect that may mean you can bring in your own drinks). The space is also a bit cramped at times, but short of buying their neighbors I don't think they could do too much about that. I will keep on coming back here and ordering as well.",5.0

The server brought the whole course to us at once and walked away but somehow he forgot to give us utensils ""oops"" so we took them from the table next to us. Food was good (but definitely I have had better before). The portions were small not really for 2 people to share as suggested. Another big disappointment was that the combination plate was missing the fish which I was actually looking forward too. All said maybe it was not my day at this time so I hope they will improve their service and if I ever go back there I will be surprise.",2.0

I usually have had the cheese stuffed with a different cheese so this threw me off a little, but yet it was good. I also had the Lassi which was seriously Outstanding! My friend ordered lamb masala with rice and and he me mention that his dish was good as well. I guess the server gave u attitude because he was confident his food good. The prices was a little high for cortelyou, guess since the neighborhood is changing into an almost hipster/trendy area.",4.0

The paneer bhurjee was definitely the best I've had as well, and if you've never had it, definitely worth a try. Would love to order from here regularly but we're out of their delivery area; we were visiting friends nearby so that's how I found them. Bummer. We're smack between their two locations! Worth a small trek though; it's hard to find good Indian around Park Slope, so I'm happy to venture out when it's this quality.",4.0

"Asya is a welcome addition to the neighborhood, the tikka masala and vindaloo are favorites, and we've had great experiences dining in or ordering food to go and picking it up. The backyard outdoor space is a very big space and we look forward to taking advantage of it often this Spring and Summer. Convenient, tasty and very friendly and professional staff. Thanks Asya.",5.0
"Came here for a quick bit, take out to be exact, and the hosts/server was very rude to us.we asked questions about the menu and the server/host acted as if we were bother him with annoying questions,really? Anyways, i order tandoori shrimp with cheese naan. The shrimp was sooo good , well season and cooked. The naan was soft,warm and stuff with what think was Kraft American cheese slice lol. I usually have had the cheese stuffed with a different cheese so this threw me off a little, but yet it was good. I also had the Lassi which was seriously Outstanding! My friend ordered lamb masala with rice and and he me mention that his dish was good as well. I guess the server gave u attitude because he was confident his food good. The prices was a little high for cortelyou, guess since the neighborhood is changing into an almost hipster/trendy area.",4.0
"Ordered take out from here on a Sunday night, delivered within 35m. I had samosas, paneer bhurjee and lamb korma. Everything was awesome. Lamb was tender and the flavor was great, rice was hot and fresh, samosas were the best I've had in a long time. The paneer bhurjee was definitely the best I've had as well, and if you've never had it, definitely worth a try. Would love to order from here regularly but we're out of their delivery area; we were visiting friends nearby so that's how I found them. Bummer. We're smack between their two locations! Worth a small trek though; it's hard to find good Indian around Park Slope, so I'm happy to venture out when it's this quality.",4.0
"I was very pleased with my meal at Asya.  I ordered the chana saag.  The sauce was flavorful without being overly heavy and tasted very fresh.  The chickpeas were tender and not at all mealy.  The cheese naan was a little odd -- it reminded me of a quesadilla -- but still tasty.The service wasn't exactly fawning, but it was fine.  Note the *amazing* 50%-off lunch special.",4.0
"Great quality food. Proud to say As a fellow central Asian that this is a classy establishment. Was never a fan of the Indian tgi Friday look where there is a lot of stuff up in the wall, but this place has embraced a modern stylish approach. Would definitely go back.",4.0
"This place is pretty good. However, its annoying that essentially every Indian restaurant in the city has almost an identical menu. I obviously love chicken tikki masala and chicken tandori but I think people are ready for different types of Indian other than the same narrow Punjabi food.",4.0
Finally a good Indian Restaurant in the area. I have tried a lot. This place is good but not great. No complaints about the food. Service was great and staff was friendly.,4.0
Excellent meal  Great service  Place is tastefully done.  This is a wonderful addition to the diversity of ethnic fine dining in the neighborhood.  Much improved since Picket Fence.  I cannot wait until Spring to sit outside and enjoy this food.,5.0
This place is actually pretty good. I tried the chicken tikka and it was delicious... the best I had in a while.,5.0
"Place is so nice! Especially for a date, it's quiet and cozy. Plate so generous and tasty - the prix fixe menu can feed you for more than one meal. Take out: they once forgot a drink, but I'm sure it was just a mistake. But make sure you have all you ordered in your bag.",4.0
"This restaurant was amazing! Atmosphere was great, staff was so nice, food was beyond amazing and the best part, the ""lunch special"" is everything 50% off. This place is one of the best highlights of the awesome Cortellyou road. Thank you Asya. P.s. Get the chicken masala in red yogurt sauce! Phenomenal!!!",5.0

"This place is highly questionable. American cheese in the cheese naan, pico de gallo on the menu, need I say more. Went for lunch, everything was half off in price and quality. Tiny portions of very mediocre food. Don't recommend at all. Walk the extra two blocks to Coney Island Avenue for much better south Asian food.",2.0
"This is delicious food. Our go-to has been King of Tandoor in Flatbush, but this is absolutely worth the slightly higher cost.  Delivery was quick, hot, and such a treat.",5.0
"I am so happy this place is here... Sooo happy. After going through a large number of Indian restaurants in brooklyn and being for the most part disappointed about one facet or another of the experience, this place is just a breath of fresh air. I feel like Indian food is the undervalued, unappreciated middle child in the brooklyn food scene. It's not trendy, or fusion, or farm to table enough to catch the loyalties of my fellow Brooklynites. Asya does just that, it shows that Indian food can be accessible, awesome, fun and exciting. It also shows that brooklyn thrives and exists south of park slope, and it is an awesome organic brooklyn steeped in history (just take a walk a few blocks south of cortelyou). It's a pretty interesting location and I am curious how it will continue to evolve. We came here on a Friday night, a few tables were occupied. The server was a friendly young man, kind, attentive and open to educating us and giving suggestions. He wanted to get to know us, our preferences and made the effort to identify and pinpoint what we may enjoy. We ordered the cauliflower at the servers suggestion and it was incredible: sweet, savory, crunchy, flavor packed deliciousness. It almost tasted like sesame chicken which was the only thing that put my carnivorous husband at ease about eating veggies.  Hubs got the samosas which were spicier than I've had them elsewhere. The garlic naan was heavenly. I got the kurma (almond based sauce). Every place has a different variation on kurma, my favorites so far have been this one and a pistachio version I had at another place. This one was really good and different than the others as it had pineapple, raisins and I think pears or apples integrated into the sauce. It was perfect. Husband had the tikka masala, his tried and true favorite and it did not disappoint, at all. We will definitely be back to Asya soon as it has now become a local favorite!",5.0
I've had better Indian cuisine in the Denver airport. Had the Chicken Tiki which was bland. Rice could have come pre-cooked from a bag. Naan could have been from the Flatbush co-op across the street and microwaved. Worst aspect is their vertebrae-slipping wooden chairs. You might as well be dining on a park bench. For close to $20/pp I think not. Cortelyou still has a very long way to go.,1.0

"I literally haven't found good curry in the US that meets the calibre you can so easily get in the UK, so I'm judging Asya based on that. In that light, Asya is, without a doubt, the best curry I've found in Brooklyn in recent memory. It's fresh, it's tasty, it reminds me of British-Indian Tikka Masala that I get back in England, and that's all I can ask for. I haven't been into the actual restaurant, though I've walked past it several times. My experience has been having it delivered, which I do via GrubHub, and it's been great every time. Just writing this review is making me crave it again. It might be slightly more expensive than other curry places, but the quality more than makes up for any difference in price, and frankly, $15 prix fixe for an appetizer, naan and a sizeable curry (which could feed 2 people, really) is a bargain, I think.
