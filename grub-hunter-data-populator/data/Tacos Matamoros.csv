"This is a casual mexican restaurant with amazing tacos. I'm almost never in Sunset Park but when I am, I come here. My favorite of the tacos is the al pastor. The small tacos are 4"" double corn tortillas. So fresh. They give you a green tomatillo and red (smokey) salsa on the side. We also got a super taco (6"" and had tomatoes, sour cream, and lettuce) and a tamale. Both were good but the regular tacos are the standout. The toppings on the regular tacos are onion and cilantro. I also really liked the nachos. They were individual chips arranged in a circle covered with beans and cheese. The jalapenos, lettuce, and guac are in the middle of the circle. It's a small portion (probably 12 chips total). The food came out very fast. There service was OK. The waitress didn't speak english so we had to point and talk very slow but our order was still slightly wrong. Getting the bill and our change also took awhile.But you don't come here for the service - you come here for the tacos! Yummmmmm.",4.0
"I was really excited to try Tacos Matamoros. You see, Matamoros is actually my last name so I was all about checking this place out. That and I love tacos. There were four of us in our party. When we walked in for a late lunch the restaurant was pretty empty, just two other tables were taken. We were seated quickly. We looked over our menus and ordered a variety of tacos in the small and large sizes. I thought we were pretty clear to the server about what we each wanted but when the food came a short time later, my tacos were all large, when I requested small, and my brothers tacos were all small when he wanted large. It wasn't a big enough thing to complain about, we ate them anyway. Overall the food was good. The salsa was seasoned perfectly! Our tacos were also pretty good. Afterwards we requested the check and the server took so long that we had to ask twice and finally ask someone else. Also, I went to the bathroom and there weren't any paper towels so on my way out I mentioned it to someone and they just looked at me like I had three heads and walked away. Okay then... So. Final thoughts, food is tasty and fresh. Service is rotton.",3.0
"Okay, so...the food here? AWESOME. I strongly recommend the tacos or burritos. Really delicious and filling, but also incredibly fresh ingredients. Why do i give it only three stars? DO NOT DINE HERE. THE SERVICE IS SO RUDE. They make you wait and don't speak to you while you are just sitting there waiting for someone to even bring you a glass of water. If you're going to order, either get pick up or delivery, because the servers will ruin your food experience!",3.0
"There's tons of taco joints on fifth and fourth avenue.  You might even mistake one for Tacos Matamoros because you'll be distracted by the lights and smells, but try not to because TM is totally worth it.We came in around 8pm on a Tuesday - there were tons of group dinners (this place is huge and great for family dinners) and little dates happening.  We ordered guac and chips (total must) and it was totally worth it.  But, we didn't expect it to be so much.  Small tacos are $1.50 each and large are $2.75.  I say go for the large, esp. the chorizo (yummy spicy and ground meat) and carnitas (soft, pulled pork, similar to Puerto Rican pernil, oh my god...) - they're so delicious and topped with a huge helping of onions and cilantro - the way that tacos are supposed to be made.We also had the carne asada (Mexican style steak) and it was a lot of food.  The platter comes with refried beans, salsa, a little bit of guac, and Mexican rice.  I could have probably just eaten the platter on my own (w/o the tacos and chips and guac), but decided to share and get a taste of everything.This place is awesome, prices are great.  The place does have a B but I didn't really mind.",5.0
"Hands down the best, most authentic Mexican restaurant I've tried in Brooklyn.  Being an L.A. native it's been a frustrating journey finding quality Mex joints in NYC.  Matamoros is clean, cheap and the real McCoy.  The lengua and cabeza tacos are reminiscent of the late-night taco trucks scattered around my neighborhood in NELA.  The costillas adobadas are heady in a complex dry-chili salsa roja.  The frozen margaritas are strong and go down easy. They will leave your head spinning if you're not careful! Yeah, this place rocks in the best way.",5.0
"This is a good place to eat, but horrible for takeout! Food poorly packaged and insultingly small portion compared to when you eat in! It was embarrassing! They need to invest in smaller takeout boxes if they insist on such a small portion! That being said, I think it's a great place to eat if you  eat there though! Food is significantly fresher!",3.0
"We love Tacos Matamoros.  One of the more popular taco places in Sunset Park, if not Brooklyn overall.Definitely come here for the tacos, but definitely try their chicken nachos, fajita platters, and tamales.  You will not be disappointed.  Prices, as always, are super affordable.The only thing I wish was that TM was still BYOB.  I think the policy changed in the last year or so.",4.0
"Food is great, service is ah ok I've been coming here for a long time. Service is still ah, so it's definitely there food that keeps me coming back. They give water with no ice an it taste like they just got it from the facet. Gross.. Anyway I didn't come for water so let me tell you about there margaritas very delicious. There nachos are amazing, burritos mmmm so good I can go on an on. There really good over all. Always a nice crowd when I come in, even when I order for pickup there usually always busy. Which says a lot there bomb.comPrices are great Meter parking right on 5th AveOver all definitely a good Mexican food spot.",4.0
"Amazing place for tacos. Spicy pork, beef tongue, chorizo and al pastor are all great options. Don't get the head meat, it's too fatty and not especially flavorful. Porkchops were also delicious. They were tender despite being the lean cut ones. I would love to try their other items another time, probably within the next two weeks when I get my twice a month taco cravings. This is the place to go.",5.0
"I'm conflicted! I would give this place a solid 4 stars, but my friend who I was with (and actually lives in Brooklyn) said that she wouldn't come back! One thing to note is that there were lots of take-out orders. First, this place is not like a dim crowded bar/restaurant with people busting in and out. It is a sit-down hole-in-the wall in Brooklyn (but bigger than your traditional hole-in-the wall). For starters we got guacamole (no free salsa unfortunately). Guac was great but the chips looked ""ehhhhh"" but tasted quite good. Not the best, but good. This is coming from a girl who can literally eat a pound of chipotle chips and guac. 5 stars: My dish (chicken fajitas) was MIND BLOWING. The perfectly melted cheese, the mushrooms, and it was not oily. Gosh, I get hungry all over agin thinking about it. The sides that came with it are rice, beans, guac, and salsa. **Best chicken fajita meal I've had...EVER.My friend got the salmon tacos and did NOT like them. She kept saying that it just tasted ""too healthy"" and bland. I'm not sure what she meant by ""too healthy"", but she was not a fan. Sour cream was an extra $1. She also got a pina colada and said it tasted like one of the most delicious milk shakes she's ever had. It WAS smooth, creamy, and you could taste the rum. I'm not a fan of pina colada's though...bleh. I decided not to get a drink but the drink menu was very affordable.",4.0
"Off of bustling 5th Ave, this restaurant is about a block away from the NR subway stop at 45th Street. It's open, spacious (apparently seats 77--as told by a fire code sign on the door) and inviting to boot.At 7:15 PM on a Tuesday night there were a few families scattered about but my friend and I pretty much felt we had the place to ourselves. It was quiet and relaxing. The waitress promptly came up to our table and took our order (we had to hurry off to another engagement). I ordered the carne asada burrito ($8.75) and my friend ordered a large and a small taco.Within ten minutes our food was set down in front of us. My burrito was slathered with guacamole and quite large. The meat inside was fresh with a nice spice flavor (mild). The rice, beans, and pico de gallo were delicious--the burrito was a hit!!While I had my eyes on my own meal, my friend devoured her tacos and I didn't even have a chance to take a bite. She loved her meal and I heartily enjoyed mine.I see that some people had trouble with the service, maybe we got lucky, but we didn't have a problem at all. Our waitress was quick, attentive, and kind. With good service, good food, and a bill of $15 for two people, who can really complain?",5.0
"There are tacos on the menu, and there are Super Tacos on the menu. I don't know who in their right mind would order a non-super taco given the choice, but at the risk of redundancy, I want to tell you that you need a Super Taco in your life. (Preferably al pastor or chorizo, but it's your choice if you want to get an inferior meat.)In addition to just being Super, these thoroughly stuffed, juicy and flavorful tacos come on a 6"" flour tortilla* with quesillo, lettuce, pico de gallo, queso fresco & sour cream. These are all good things, particularly the quesillo, which is apparently just little tiny bits of fried cheese. Tiny bits of fried cheese! These cannot possibly be a bad addition to a taco.I suppose it's not really fair to compare all the other tacos with Super Tacos, but these just might be the best tacos I've had in Brooklyn. _______________*I don't want to debate the merits of corn vs. flour here. I love a good corn tortilla. But I do want you Corn Only Fanatics to recognize the fact that a bad corn tortilla, with its mealy/cold/unfreshness can ruin a taco utterly.

Came here for lunch and ordered a carne asada taco and an al pastor taco with chips and guac with horchata. The al pastor taco was probably my favorite with so much flavor.

If you're in Sunset Park this is the spot for some yummy authentic mexican food. I recommend the pipian verde and the frozen margaritas. Prices are very reasonable and plenty of tables for a group.,4.0
"Had dinner there and it was relatively underwhelming. The place is extremely casual and was very noisy the night we went. The tacos were good, but below average for the area.",3.0
"Simple put , if you love authentic Mexican street food and in the mood for such fare and your not in Mexico then run, don't walk, well you can walk , but just get here and start with the tacos and work you way up from there.You will not be disappointed !Service is friendly and quick.Nice comfy laid back atmosphere .My wife and I highly recommend this restaurant.",5.0

"I love love love no frills, affordable, eat-with-your-hands-till-you-are-covered-in-meat-juices type of food. Hence why I love the delicious tacos found at this place. This place is packed with families on a night out, teens on dates or guys on a night out while a Hispanic man wanders in peddling DVDs. Order the lengua (beef tongue), cabeza (boiled beef head) and carnitas, as I did. You won't regret the 'fatty missile flavor' (to quote Bourdain) of fatty pork, cilantro, onions and hot sauce in the carnitas taco. Or the tender, beefy flavor of the lengua. Feeling more adventurous? Fried pig's intestines offers a spicy fatty crunch to your taco. Somedays I crave carnitas and fried pig intestine tacos. With a bowl of fresh guac. Is that a bad thing?",4.0

We cam where on a Sunday night and got fried calamari and chops with Sala and guacamole for appetizer and they were horrible.  Calamari was chewy and the chips were over fried and tasted nasty.  Guacamole was favor less compare to what I am usually used to. We were hoping that the entree can save the day but the steak was horrible along with the lamb.  The only thing that was good was the tostada.  Would not come here again.,2.0

It's about an hour and a half for me to get this place so I don't go as often as I'd like. The food is delicious! I've tried their enchiladas verdes and tacos. I can't get enough of the rice and beans! Try a margarita on the rocks and chips and guac to get you started. This place is always packed and waitress took 20 min to bring the check last time I went. So I'd suggest asking for the bill as soon as your food arrives. Enjoy!!!,4.0

Their tacos are great. Their sangria is great. Fajitas are great. Everything is great. Except their rice and beans. That rice and beans is magical. I've never had better mexican rice and beans elsewhere. A plus plus. Willing to get fat again.,5.0
"Great authentic Mexican food, so two stars. The service, however, is routinely *horrendous* and unbearable. You basically don't have a waiter which creates all the problems. So many times I have sat at a table, and had to walk up and get a menu. Once you know what you want to order, you have to walk up and order. Once you're done eating, you have to walk up and ask for the check. Once you get the check, you have to stand there and pay. The only thing fast about this place is the amount of time that it takes for your food to come out. If you were to sit at your table and never actively try and get a waiter's/waitresses attention, a 20-30 minute meal can easily take 3 hours here. This makes me believe that waiters here don't get tipped, or get to keep the tips that we give them. There is literally zero sense of urgency. One night we took a group of friends here that have never been, and my wife asked for a side plate of rice and beans all night long....at least for an hour and a half. It never came. All of the above problems were also present that night. It was actually pretty embarrassing since it was our recommendation. Absolutely ridiculous. It's so frustrating because the food is fantastic, which is why I've been eating here the past 5 years. The service, however, is absolutely terrible, and is only getting worse it seems. We probably will stop coming back here just because I can't bring myself to support a business that doesn't try to continually improve its operations after hearing the same critique countless times by various customers.",2.0

"I love this place, Tacos Matamoros does tacos, burritos, and Mexican dishes right.  I have to warn you though, the service is terrible, the servers are really laid back and try to slow down service purposefully if the kitchen is overwhelmed, you'll see the waiters stand there pretending you haven't sat down.The food is fantastic.  The tacos are done so right the they're like little fists of flavor.  Great texture.  I ordered the Chorizo taco, Lengua (beef tongue) taco (my favorite), Tripa (cow intestines) tacos.  It was just enough to fill me up.  Each taco was good and they give you a side of salsa and hot sauce to put on your tacos with a lemon (prob should have been lime but hey).The drink options are pretty good you can get a frozen magurita for $5 and it's a fun little treat.I've tried an order of Pollo Asado and the chicken was very nicely done.  My wife always orders a side of chips and guacamole and it's always nice to have with your food.Bottom line, great food everything is done proper, very solid and certain menu items can even thrill you, service needs to get a lot better if they want to expand.",4.0
"2.5 stars.This was the first place I went to on my quest to try all the taco joints in my new work neighborhood. I had read great things about this spot and wanted to start off on a high note but this place fell way short!I went around 12ish and had to wait almost 10 minutes before I was even acknowledged, even though the restaurant was fairly empty. Then, the lady just picked up a notepad and stared at me without a word. Really? Blegh. Anyway, I ended up ordering the steak and chicken tacos, both large. Both tacos were underwhelming. The chicken came in huge chunks which I liked, but it was rather flavorless! The beef was overcooked and dry. The guac that they both came with was good, though. Overall, not impressed. I'll probably give this place another shot but not until after I've tried more places in the neighborhood. At the moment, Tacos El Bronco holds #1 on my list!",2.0

"Been here quite a few times. Excellent authentic Mexican food and drinks!I've had the chicken tacos, the chicken burrito, and chicken fajitas (yes I love chicken!) and everything was delicious! The margaritas, especially the frozen ones are so good!I only give it 4 stars because of slow service.",4.0
Great food. Visiting from California and its just as good as anything you would get there.  Large tacos are big. I ate three and feel way too stuffed. I went with some locals who said this isn't even the best Mexican food in the area so I'm definitely jealous of everyone who lives here. We went at lunch when it was fairly empty and service was pretty slow. Good price! Yay tacos!,4.0
Guacamole is fantastic and fresh. Service is quick and the wait is short to none. Reasonable pricing and large amour of seating. Yes the take cash. That's a life saver around sunset park. This place is not gentrified at all and remains true to their food! You should come here and eat tasty and authentic mexican food!,4.0
"It use to be great a few years ago.. but that all changed. I'd rather pay a buck or two more in bay ridge for tacos now surprisingly instead. Or spend the same/even less for the same quality pork taco taste, but maybe even better sometimes on the 60th and 4th ave cart.Everything was just blah. From the dry bland meats in the taco and entree.. to the skimp over salty&spicy seafood soup. Everything we got was atleast missing an ingredient or something the menu mentions. Like when it says your taco has ""pico de gallo"" and it really didn't have it.. Stuff like that was just going on with everything we order ugh so false. The ceviche was just terrible too, which I always thought it isn't hard to mess up. The staff are so attentive, rude, and unhelpful too.This use to be the ""real authentic taco joint in the heart of sunset"" but now it's just disappointing.",1.0
"I particularly loved the Horchata!!  I would go back just for another cup.  The carne burrito was pretty good too.  A little too much rice and the beef was on the tough side, but with the guacamole and the two salsas (both red and green), it was a tasty dinner.  My friend loved her lengua taco and said the fish taco was salmon, which impressed me.  The guacamole was delicious!  The staff was friendly and our to go order was ready quickly.",4.0
"I dwell on my Authentic Mexican food. I am Mexican for a fact. Let me say a couple things. I think this restaurant has moved a lot and I've Eaten here quite a lot through out my childhood. There food has always been on point. But anyways on to my currently and recent review. So I came here with a family member and let me tell you those waiters IGNORE you for a while. We were literally sitting there for 10 minutes waiting for a waiter or something. We were hungry lol So your not you when your hungry. Any who, the waiter eventually came to our table and we ordered. We order two tortas al pastor. Also WAIT time is about 10-20 minutes depending on what you order. So choose carefully. The tortas arrived. And let me tell you the price and amount is great. I believe it was around $7-$9. Someone correct me if I'm wrong. But yes they were great and my tummy was full. Although I do feel they rush you when your almost to done eating. But do eat here. It's local and authentic. I gave this place a 4 star rating due to the fact that the waiters were no where within reach after 10 minutes of sitting down.",4.0
"I love this place, Tacos Matamoros does tacos, burritos, and Mexican dishes right.  I have to warn you though, the service is terrible, the servers are really laid back and try to slow down service purposefully if the kitchen is overwhelmed, you'll see the waiters stand there pretending you haven't sat down.The food is fantastic.  The tacos are done so right the they're like little fists of flavor.  Great texture.  I ordered the Chorizo taco, Lengua (beef tongue) taco (my favorite), Tripa (cow intestines) tacos.  It was just enough to fill me up.  Each taco was good and they give you a side of salsa and hot sauce to put on your tacos with a lemon (prob should have been lime but hey).The drink options are pretty good you can get a frozen magurita for $5 and it's a fun little treat.I've tried an order of Pollo Asado and the chicken was very nicely done.  My wife always orders a side of chips and guacamole and it's always nice to have with your food.Bottom line, great food everything is done proper, very solid and certain menu items can even thrill you, service needs to get a lot better if they want to expand.",4.0
"2.5 stars.This was the first place I went to on my quest to try all the taco joints in my new work neighborhood. I had read great things about this spot and wanted to start off on a high note but this place fell way short!I went around 12ish and had to wait almost 10 minutes before I was even acknowledged, even though the restaurant was fairly empty. Then, the lady just picked up a notepad and stared at me without a word. Really? Blegh. Anyway, I ended up ordering the steak and chicken tacos, both large. Both tacos were underwhelming. The chicken came in huge chunks which I liked, but it was rather flavorless! The beef was overcooked and dry. The guac that they both came with was good, though. Overall, not impressed. I'll probably give this place another shot but not until after I've tried more places in the neighborhood. At the moment, Tacos El Bronco holds #1 on my list!",2.0
"Horrible service and horrible tacos ! Only the pastor was good. Everything else we ordered was disgusting and the service was terrible.  Please avoid if you don't want to have a bad night!

My last dinner in NYC...  We walked in and got seated right away.  The place was super packed for a Sunday night.  The food must be really good.  One of the servers stopped by and dropped some menus off and that was about it.  We looked through the menu real quick and was ready to order.  No server came back to our table.  We waited what seems like forever for anyone to come by to take our orders.  No one......tick tock........still no one.  About 20 minutes went by and a manager happens to walk by our table.  We stopped him and asked if we can put our orders in.  We mainly ordered tacos(different meats) and some dranks.  Food and drinks came out quick.  I think it took longer to put in our orders than the wait time to get our food.  Margaritas were okay but the food was amazeball.  Now I see why this place is packed regardless of the crappy service.  *Prices are cheap cheap*,4.0

"Went there for late lunch yesterday. Busy place, but got seated straightaway. My husband said he liked the horchata and I have to agree it was quite good- good mix of cinnamon and milk flavors.

He said the cabeza had a good flavor but that it was too fatty. The pollo was dry. (Thankfully the place fixed the bill to reflect their mistake).

I have been living in the North Country for 5 months and have been craving some good Mexican food - a friend of mine suggested we come here for a later dinner and I am so glad she did.

"One of my big gripes with a lot of Mexican restaurants in Mexican neighborhoods is that the food is often unadventurous.

I really hope that they not only continue to try new things, but the trend catches on, because it's fun to have different kinds of Mexican.",4.0

"This place came highly recommended to me by an acquaintance, so I was surprised and disappointed when it was overall pretty mediocre. The following were problems:1. Service was inattentive. I don't mind inattentive service if they are good at fulfilling your needs without you asking, but they weren't. My appetizer came out after my meal, they didn't bring hot sauce until I asked for it twice, and even then the hot sauce came out after I was done eating the thing I wanted to put it on.2. I'm surprised they have an A for cleanliness. When the waiter cleaned my table he just wiped stuff onto the floor. I stepped in someone else's food on the way out, too, so it wasn't just me.3. It's hard to tell how fresh food is when it's cooked, so I can't speak for all the food, but the avocados used to make the guacamole were definitely not fresh. I left a quarter of my guacamole on the plate because it was grey/brown and tasted rotten.It's authentic Mexican food and obviously a lot of people like it, so I really wanted to like this place, but I just couldn't bring myself to give it more than 2 stars.",2.0

The view is simply stunning especially during fall.  Okay, let's talk about the tacos. Well, they are incredibly good! Look at this picture (s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com…), just look at that. The chicken is flavorful and juicy; it's served on cute colorful plates, two layers of soft warm tortilla, a lot of meat, chopped cilantro, onions, radish and lime on the side, AND I'm not done, it comes with their special sauces that gives it even more flavor, I mean it's already delicious, but add that sauce WHOAA... it's an explosion of flavors in your mouth.",4.0

"Delicious tacos with heaping servings of guacamole in them. Cheap, cheap, cheap (I think it's like $2 a taco or something insane like that).

"Good standard-fare Mexican. You probably won't be blown away, but especially the margaritas and tacos are quite tasty.

"I came to Tacos Matamoros by way of Yelp. I was looking for a good Mexican restaurant in Brooklyn and by all of the good reviews I wanted to give it a try. The decor was beautiful and the place is huge which i like, everyone wasn't sitting on top of each other.. They had some great salsa music playing which also added an extra flair. The food was great! ordered steak tacos, refried beans and rice. food was well cooked and plentiful and the  staff was great.. and I can't say enough about the margaritas!  I have to say they may have been one of the best margaritas I have had.. I will defiantly be back and tell others about this gem.",4.0
"I've enjoyed Tacos Matamoros more than once before, so it pains me to have to return here with a negative review after last week's visit.The major thing that colored this visit was the rotten (to the point of malicious) service we received. Things which could be honest server mistakes (or language misunderstandings) multiplied until those explanations became unreasonable, and it slowly dawned on us that we were victims of studious neglect. Asking for a glass of water four separate times spread out over a 30-minute period (the water never arrived, by the way). Asking three times over that same period for chips (which did arrive, long after the meal was over and wallets were being produced). So on and so forth, leaving us wondering if any of us (a pretty meek and mild crew) had accidentally offended someone on staff while walking in. It was bustling but not packed (with empty tables here and there and a number of waitresses and other staff working the room).Our most disappointing single incident involved one of our party (a Spanish speaker, incidentally) asking if the regular sopes included beans. Yes, she was told--black or pinto? Oh, black beans. Is that all right? Yes, black beans is fine. All right, sopes, no meat, just black beans.The sopes soon arrived--fried discs of corn topped with no more than shredded lettuce and a baseball-sized mound of crema. Surely a mistake, yes? The waitress, flagged down, came over. No, she firmly insisted. You didn't order beans. I don't know what you're talking about. She slipped away, not attempting to resolve the issue, and in the would-be diner's mid-sentence as she attempted to order a side of beans (because lettuce and crema don't provide much protein). It took fifteen minutes to corral her again to order those beans.Some of the dishes were fine--nothing outstanding--and some were pretty blah. This was a real disappointment after excellent meals at TM in previous years. The reason behind one of the dish's blahness was revealed when the bill came: the waitress had taken it upon herself to tag the mild-looking white guy's meal NO PIQUE. My own camarones burrito, mercifully, did not suffer this insult, and was merely all right. The bad taste left in my mouth after this evening didn't come from the burrito, though--it came from the service.",2.0

"my new found love taco place! I will give its tacos 4.5 stars, even better than El Bronco!  From chicken, spicy pork, beef, flank steak to chorizo, I've love them all and will continue to crave and love them!!! I also tried out their sister/chain on 57th, but i have to say i like here much better!",4.0
"As others have stated, the food here is awesome.  It's definitely worth the four avenue walk downhill (both ways!).  Tacos are like $2-$3, margaritas and sangria run $5, and almost all the entrees are under $20.  My only gripe with this place, and the reason it is not receiving 5 stars, is the service.  It's mediocre.  Sometimes you will stand around for 5 minutes before anyone acknowledges you.  Sometimes you will stare at your closed menu for 10 minutes.  I dunno; I don't get it.",4.0
"Delicious tacos with heaping servings of guacamole in them. Cheap, cheap, cheap (I think it's like $2 a taco or something insane like that). I took a star away because even though the guac in their tacos is delicious, when you order guac as an appetizer they serve a bed of lettuce with a tablespoon of guac in it. Aside from that , this place is delicious and uber cheap.",4.0
"Good standard-fare Mexican. You probably won't be blown away, but especially the margaritas and tacos are quite tasty. The rest of the food, to my mind, doesn't do much to distinguish it from your standard, solid Mexican joint, but I don't mean that as a complaint or critique, and particularly in New York (where it's tough to get good, non-bougie Mexican food), this is something worth your time and money.",4.0

"I'm not sure if my experience was an exception over everyone's 4 starsbut I was completely underwhelmed with this place and actually it was just bad. We picked up food for togo and we got authentic albeit bland food and one item we didn't touch as it smelled like old dishwater. Chips with no salt, tasteless and runny salsa, bland grisly meat, and a pork and verde dish that just smelled awful.The staff was very friendly just wish the food was.",2.0

"I came to Tacos Matamoros by way of Yelp. I was looking for a good Mexican restaurant in Brooklyn and by all of the good reviews I wanted to give it a try. The decor was beautiful and the place is huge which i like, everyone wasn't sitting on top of each other.. They had some great salsa music playing which also added an extra flair. The food was great! ordered steak tacos, refried beans and rice. food was well cooked and plentiful and the  staff was great.. and I can't say enough about the margaritas!  I have to say they may have been one of the best margaritas I have had.. I will defiantly be back and tell others about this gem.",4.0
"I've enjoyed Tacos Matamoros more than once before, so it pains me to have to return here with a negative review after last week's visit.The major thing that colored this visit was the rotten (to the point of malicious) service we received. Things which could be honest server mistakes (or language misunderstandings) multiplied until those explanations became unreasonable, and it slowly dawned on us that we were victims of studious neglect. Asking for a glass of water four separate times spread out over a 30-minute period (the water never arrived, by the way).

I don't know why I would ever pay $4 for a taco anywhere else when that can easily get me 3 at Tacos Matamoros. Seriously, come here for authentic Mexican. The chicken taco was SPICY. Very unexpected so you do not need to put any more sauce on it if you cannot handle spicy. I ordered 5 small tacos but I was already full after my 4th one. Order the Boing Guayaba juice.

"I never had tripe in a taco before. I never had tripe period! But the tripe tacos I had here? Crispy and delicious. Also a fan of the chorizo and carne enchilada tacos.

The lengua taco was decent too. I think mine had a few too many fatty parts in it. Not sure how though. We're talking about a tongue here!  Also tried the chalupas here. Very tasty! I thought taco bell was the only place that made them. I keed. I am now a fan of this place (my first time going), but do prepared for service to be hit or miss. There's a large margin for error with communication barriers depending on who your server is. We kept our orders simple to avoid any confusion. Also, parking was a little tough to find around this place. But that's no different than much of NYC.

"YUMMY nachos!! Great service too. We started off with nachos served with green salsa, red salsa, lime and guacamole. It tasted very fresh and the salsa ranged in level of spice.

"The standard by which I judge all Mexican restaurants (in New York), and it probably will be forever. I used to live sort of near Taco Matamoros and had seen/heard whisperings about it from time to time. Why it took me so long to finally try it, I will never know. What I do know is that it is God-damn amazing. Tacos Matamoros is rather authentic as far as New York City Mexican eateries go. It's an excellent stop for a casual, extremely filling and extremely inexpensive meal. Their menu offers an astounding variety of tacos and other Mexican dishes, all of which seem to be authentic and consistently excellent through my repeat visits. Many are a fan of the single-order tacos here which are very inexpensive (I believe they all come in under $2.50/piece), and the interesting fillings they have which range from typical (chicken) to a bit more exotic (lengua) are great. I also love the chicken fajita plate they serve (for about $10) which comes with sautéed chicken & peppers, tortillas, rice, beans, salsas, etc. so you can make your own taco awesomeness. Their chips and guacamole are highly recommended. This is a BYOB establishment, so just stop by the wine shop across the street, or a bodega for a beer to bring in, and you're set to have a great time.This place is a bit out of the way (you have to take the craptastic R-train to Sunset Park, after all), but I believe it's worth it.

"Talk about getting bang for your buck! I've been going to this place for a number of years now and it's always been one of my favorites! It's great if you're on a budget for lunch or dinner. I really love the tacos! The small I will usually get 3 or 4 and it's just enough. They are usually pretty consistent but everything always taste fresh. The only reason I say usually is because sometimes the meat is a little dry and the waitresses forget about you sometimes. However these two things have only happened when they're busy. The desserts are never a disappointment though.Oh and if you ever want to have a few drinks with your dinner, the sangria is great and the margaritas are STONG.",4.0
"Let's get this straight, this place is THE taco place in sunset park. We aren't talking about some gentrified amusement park, this place has been in the neighborhood for years and it's pretty much stayed the same. Come here on a Friday night and you will see neighborhood families with their kids having a night out. Even though the neighborhood demographics have changed a lot, this place still shines as the place locals and observers love. Order their special meat tacos like pork cheek and tongue. And when you're done, take a walk through sunset park across the street, buy and Italian ice, and enjoy the beautiful view of manhattan.",4.0
"I just don't get why this place has four stars. Maybe I came here on a bad night. It was about a year ago and I haven't been back since, but I remember it like it was yesterday. This restaurant put me off all Mexican restaurants in Sunset Park for a very long time.The chicken was very greasy, the server forgot my friend's salmon and we had to flag down someone else to go get it. I was done with my meal by the time he got his. I don't think the order was ever put in.They barley spoke English, and maybe they don't need to in this neighborhood, but I'm sure it would have improved service. The food was bad and so was the service.",1.0
"Authentic Mexican food: Tacos, tamales, guacamole, homemade tortilla chips, flan, and tres leches cake.All of it was divine. Rich, flavorful, creamy, crunchy, delicious.Five people ate all of that for $43.I can never go to a place where I have to kick in above $25 for my individual share of the bill ever again.This place is fantastic! Admittedly, I had to dock it a star for the random bouts of ear-splitting musical interludes from the very boisterous speaker system. When a customer is celebrating a birthday, well, you know...VERY quickly.",4.0
"Very good food and service. The tacos are great but the same can be said for most of the resturants serving them in Sunset Park. Dont forget to ask for the green or red sauce, it comes with fresh radish and limes. Get the flan with fresh Strawberry and whip cream, so good. The frozen margaritas are pretty strong and only $5. Overall this is the best sitdown place I have been to in Sunset, I'm looking forward to trying the other menu options.",5.0
"The standard by which I judge all Mexican restaurants (in New York), and it probably will be forever. I used to live sort of near Taco Matamoros and had seen/heard whisperings about it from time to time. Why it took me so long to finally try it, I will never know. What I do know is that it is God-damn amazing. Tacos Matamoros is rather authentic as far as New York City Mexican eateries go. It's an excellent stop for a casual, extremely filling and extremely inexpensive meal. Their menu offers an astounding variety of tacos and other Mexican dishes, all of which seem to be authentic and consistently excellent through my repeat visits. Many are a fan of the single-order tacos here which are very inexpensive (I believe they all come in under $2.50/piece), and the interesting fillings they have which range from typical (chicken) to a bit more exotic (lengua) are great. I also love the chicken fajita plate they serve (for about $10) which comes with sautéed chicken & peppers, tortillas, rice, beans, salsas, etc. so you can make your own taco awesomeness. Their chips and guacamole are highly recommended. This is a BYOB establishment, so just stop by the wine shop across the street, or a bodega for a beer to bring in, and you're set to have a great time.This place is a bit out of the way (you have to take the craptastic R-train to Sunset Park, after all), but I believe it's worth it. Definitely a Brooklyn favorite, and if you're out for some seriously good Mexican, this is it.",5.0
"As a discriminating Chicana from East Los I usually stick to the tacos al pastor or enchiladas. Those two items are good and safe as well as the chilaquiles but the service is always mediocre at best with the exception of the gentleman who I think is the runner. The wait staff take a very long time to even ask of you would like a drink, they seem annoyed with having to take your order and I just always get an unwelcoming vibe every time I've gone, whether it's with my ""güero"" or white friends or my family. But it's the only place I know where the tacos are pretty good and there are margaritas.",3.0

I think that because of hipsters flock to this place, they don't need to be nice/hospitable.For people who can tolerate this sort of thing, their food is good.

After being spoiled by the best Mexican food in California I'm biased!Service: pretty standard, nothing spectacular!Food: ordered the shrimp+fish+chorizo+cow tongue+cow head tacos.

But the chorizo (Mexican sausage) and the shrimp were the better two out of all of them.Had the shrimp nachos and it tasted like way too much beans flavor, totally overtook the whole shrimp aspect.Had the chicken matamoros and the chicken itself was delicious. But the rice was not even room temperature and dry.Had the mixed ceviche and it was very heavy on the tomato sauce. The seafood was rubbery and tasted frozen.I left feeling overall like I wasn't satiated and needed to vomit.

"I have to say I was disappointed in my fellow Yelpers for this one. Went around 8pm on a Saturday and there was one table open in the front so we were seated right away. Our waitress was brought us menus and water right away too. I ordered a mango margarita and it tasted like a regular one. I didn't mind because it was good and strong but I would have preferred an actual hint of mango. One of my beef enchiladas had tiny bone pieces so I spit out what was in my mouth and was worried the other two had bones as well. I gave them to my bf and he said they were fine, lucky him. I was enjoying the meal until then. The rice was made just right so I tried to enjoy that.My bf had fried fish and rice and said it was lacking flavor including salt. I ended with a tres leche cake which to my disappointment was covered with almonds which I am not a fan of, that too went to the bf. The menu definitely had desserts at $3 and $3.50 but the watiress marked this as $4.50 on the bill and it was such a small slice.

She brought the tacos and not the sauce, she walked away so quickly that she didnt give me a chance to say anything. It took about 10 minutes to get a different waitress' attention and ask her to bring it to me.

ROBBERY!!!!Food - The food can hardly be called mediocre even.  We all had huevos rancheros, and while the sauce was ok, the eggs were all over cooked.  The menudo was bland and watered down.  The horchata, goodness was it terrible.  It was the most watered down horchata I have ever had.  I might as well have ordered a Poland spring!As you can tell by my profile, I don't write many reviews, but my experience here was so overwhelmingly terrible that I felt absolutely compelled to warn my fellow eaters about the poor food and potential robbery.  Don't say someone should have told you. Cheers.",1.0
"The food is mediocre at best and service was very bad. The menudo is trash, the huevos rancheros was overdone, the orchata was very watered down- it's not even natural. I was overcharged on every item that I ordered and had hidden costs. When I disputed the hidden fees, I was told that the menu that everyone in my table had was outdated and invalid and forced to pay the hidden fees. I have never received such bad food or service in a Mexican restaurant in sunset park and don't plan in returning.",1.0
"take away thoughts from this meal...order to your hearts content, everything is super reasonable and one should *roll* out of this joint.there are two sizes of tacos - regular and large. you can't go wrong with any of the tacos however my personal favorite was the the chorizo taco and the carne enchilada which is made of a super spicy ground pork. i recommend the regular size taco if you are indulging in other plates/tacos, the large taco if that's your main course. the cemita was absolutely overflowing with carne and condiments. my only complaint is that there was way too much mayo on the cemita - i would have actually preferred it without. mayo seemed unnecessary with all the other flavors and sauces dripping out. this is not a ""dry"" sandwich by any means. the enchiladas were great - served with rice and beans - filling and satisfying.the tamales were also a hit - super moist inside of the banana leaf and a steal at $2 a pop.  love that this is a family joint full of all ages and locals. i want to come back and eat through the rest of the menu which is extensive. tostadas, tortas and fajitas are calling my name.",4.0
"Being from cali, I loooove good tacos. Nothing is better than rolling up to the 24 hour taco place at 3 in the morning and ordering yummy, cheap tacos to satisfy late night cravings.After trying all of the popular taco places in Brooklyn, I have to say that Tacos Matamoros has won in my book. Tripas, lengua, cabeza, ... even the weird stuff is good! Of course you have to try al pastor and carnitas, and probably chicken and steak too. They're all good, every last one of them.It's just too bad they cost $1.75 each. Back home I can literally get 3 of the same tacos for that price. Still totally worth it and definitely satisfies my taco cravings whenever I am in the area!",5.0
"In the mood for some Mexican! Friend suggests this restaurant one late night.  Great choice! The taco's are cheap and meaty.  They did not skimp on the stuffed meat.  In my case the Beef Tongue.  Chewy Goodness I tell you, Yum! Also ordered the Pork Steak with Onions , Rice, Guac, beans.  Huge portions leaving me stuffed and the sauce that came with the meal was just absolutely perfect paired with the tacos.  They give you extra tortilla wraps to make your own wraps with your dish.  So a small taco ($1.50) and my Entree (Pork steak dish : $11) I was stuffed and satisfied.  Friendly and quick service! Did not wait long for our food to arrive at all.  For a quick Mexican fix and satisfying meal, I suggest giving this a visit! =)",4.0
"This is probably the most authentic Mexican food joint I tried in New York City.Food is fresh and delicious. I tried 4 different small tacos: carne asada, pollo, chorizo, carne enchilada and they were all spectacular. Service is friendly. A go-to place in Sunset Park.",4.0
"I only ate tacos here. Steak tacos for me! A few years ago, I remember the steak being tender & juicy. Nowadays, it's just different. Perhaps I went on a day where the chef was ""off""?  Minus one star. I'll update again when I go back a few more times.",4.0
I'M MEXICAN!! This is the closest to real mexican food you can find in brooklyn.Don't expect them to speak english because you will be dissapointed!As I said it's closest to real mexican food which means it is spicy and if you like mexican but rather in a american style orIf you cant handle spicy food then this is not your place to go.Tacos are good just make sure you ask them exactly what you want IN SPANISH preferred! Everyone is friendly but if it's very busy you will have to wait for your food a little longer!Only complain: waitresses dont speak too much english and they can be shy! ;),4.0
"I've been coming to Matamoros for years and most of the time it's been a good experience.  The only thing that I wish they would focus a little better on is the staff. While some are attentive, there are still those waitresses with snotty attitudes and are straight out rude when you ask for something that is supposed to come with your meal.For instance,  I ordered my tacos w.no hot sauce on top and just green sauce on the side. She brought the tacos and not the sauce, she walked away so quickly that she didnt give me a chance to say anything. It took about 10 minutes to get a different waitress' attention and ask her to bring it to me. She then told our waitress and instead of her bringing us the green sauce she came to the table and told us (in spanish) that if we have a problem we have to ask HER  not a different waitress. (Well I was trying to do that but she was nowhere to be found) I explained to her why I had to do that,  she didn't say anything back, simply rolled her eyes and walked away. Forgot AGAIN about the green sauce... I had to remind her again, then she brought it... tacos were cold by the time this was all over LOL",2.0
"Oh, man.  Tacos here are so legit.  No excess of junk filling to mask the fact that the filling isn't actually that good, no plasticky, packed-with-fillers, processed cheese, and no stale tortillas here.  Matamoros is damn good.  I'm not ashamed to admit that I downed 9 of these suckers, so I was able to gauge a range of varieties.  The al pastor was the best - the pork was succulent and juicy.  Chorizo was crumbly and also a standout, along with the shrimp - very well-cooked and not overdone and mushy.  No complaints about the chicken or grilled fish, either, though neither wowed me as much as the pork.The tres leches, one of my favorite desserts, was good and sweet, the way tres leeches should be.  My only minor gripe is that it was a bit uneven - some of the cake was soaked, while other spots were a bit dry.  Overall, however, the taste was fantastic and I liked the layer of crunchy, sweet walnuts as a filling.The servers were totally awesome and I give them extra props for handling a table of over 20 extremely hungry taco aficionados with ease.",4.0

"I have always been pretty disappointed with the Mexican food at most places in NYC.  The only place that I have found to be any good was at the red Hook Ball fields but that place is only available during the summer and fall seasons, and even for those months, only on the weekends. Then, recently, I found out about the Mexican food in the Sunset Park area and in particular a place called Tacos Matamoros which is said to serve some pretty decent Mexican fare.I have a friend who lives by this neighborhood.  Taking advantage of the fact that he speaks Spanish, I dragged him to this place as my unpaid translator.  This worked out for me because we discovered our waitress barely spoke English at all ( there was a lot of waitresses at the place though so I can't say how many are like this).After having the waitress explain a few items on the menu for me, during which she was an absolute doll for being so patient with answering my endless questions, I settled on Quesadillas Con Carne o queso , Tostadas De Ceviche, and Tacos Pollo Grande.Quesadillas Con Carne o queso (Quesadillas with beef / cheese):This dish came with very soft and fluffy yellow rice and very smooth re-fried beans.  There was three quesadillas with the order and each have a very crunchy fried outer shell that holds some pretty flavorful beef  inside with a decent amount of a white cheese (not sure what kind it was).   This dish was unexpectedly huge and was a steal at only $6.50.Tostadas De Ceviche ( Fried tortilla shell topped with seafood):  For $3.50, there was a surprisingly large amount of shrimp and octopus mixed with citrus juice, tomatoes, and other seasonings with a large slice of guacamole on top of it all..   The shrimp and octopus was cooked by blanching quickly in hot water and further cooked by marination in the citrus juice. Another Yelper friend told me that this was a fairly common technique for Ceviche for shrimp and octopus.  I always thought authentic Ceviche calls for uncooked ingredients before marination. The dish was very good with a sharp, citrus taste from the marination.Tacos Pollo Grande (Large chicken taco):  All the tacos comes in two sizes.  Small and large.  Besides the size difference, the waitress told us that the small one doesn't comes with guacamole.  It's $1.25 for the small one and and only $2.25 for the large one.  There was a lot of chicken meat and a whole dollop of guacamole between two soft tortillas.  It was good but I probably should have ordered something besides chicken because as with the problem with some chicken dishes, the chicken meat was a little bland and was the weakest part of the whole taco.  I could see it being even tastier with other choices such as steak that would marinate better.All this food for $12.25 and to be truthful, adding the taco was a bit much since I didn't expect the portions to be so big relative to the price so I could have done without that and still have enough food.  I still think the Country Boys Food Truck in Red Hook Ball Fields have a superior taco but this place isn't bad at all and have a much wider selection to choose from.  I guess people are right about Sunset Park being where some of the more proper Mexican foods could be found at.",4.0
"Great tacos!!!! Well seasoned. Hot if you want them. Otherwise, tasty and very inexpensive.  The Margaritas are wonderful.  Get them on the rocks.  If you want some inexpensive authentic Mexican fast food or not so fast food too, this is a great place.  They deliver as well.  Simple place with great food.  If you are in Sunset Park, grab a taco and a margarita.

First the prices were really good. The carne asada wasn't as good as the place across the street however. The meat was kinda tough.

"We traveled all the way to Sunset Park from Midtown on a pleasant afternoon searching for the ""best"" Mexican in Brooklyn. 35 minute commute on the R train, coming out to a pretty much foreign land. Thankfully the restaurant was only one block from the train. Housed by all sorts of Mexican restaurants, but we found our destination.Hustling, bustling... and very packed I might add, with blasting Spanish music. Loved it. Kids running all over the place as well - we were the only two Asians in the spot, which only meant one thing. We hit the jackpot, true authentic Mexican food. Score!We ordered tacos. Lots of them. 2 carne asada, 2 spicy enchilada, 1 pollo, 1 chorizo. All grande sized, all $2.25 each. Score again! Stick to my advice, ask them for their salsa picante sauce. Ooze that biatch all over your tacos, with the green sauce, and fresh lime juice... and it won't disappoint. Delicious!!! I definitely recommend the enchilada spicy pork taco, and the chorizo taco. Yummy goodness. Their tacos are so cute, the come in a little cone shape. We also ordered a regular nacho, which had cheese, beans, lettuce and guac. It wasn't that worth it, since there were less than 8 chips on the plate and it was $5. The food came out very fast, all of them perfectly lined on the plate, and the service was great, although I had the urge to speak Spanish the whole time. Back to the tacos. We were freaking stuffed by the end of the meal. Note that they have tons of sodas/non-alcoholic beverages to choose from, but no beer. After 4 years of living in NYC, I finally made it to Sunset Park, thank you for showing me something real, other than Chipotle!",4.0
I totally forgot to update my review when I found their health inspection results. They have rats. A TON of places around here do. I just started working at a food place (find me) and now you can go to nyc.gov/doh and see ANY inspection results from any place with a grade! It's not that hard to get an A. NO EXCUSES.,1.0
"I think every five star review of this place is a bit overblown. That doesn't mean this place isn't worth a visit. It surely is. It's a perfect excuse to get your butt out to Sunset Park, which is well worth hanging out in for an afternoon that blurs into evening. It's also a dream restaurant if you value the kind of place where the food is good, inexpensive, correct enough that it's packed with expats and their children, the service is great and the decor fits the place perfectly: no pretension, just a comfortable room full of tables and chairs in wood and earth tones with some good music playing low in the background.To be honest, being here felt one hell of a lot like being in Mexico. And I'll admit I love Mexico. But the food has to be the bottom line. First off, I expected the pork tacos to be better than the beef, because in most cases that's a safe assumption. Not so here. The spicy pork (enchilada) and roast pork proved nearly indistinguishable, due to the overwhelming chipotle flavor of the red salsa. The fried pork, without the red salsa, fared much better. But both the beef (al pastor) and tongue (lengua) were  top notch.

"We traveled all the way to Sunset Park from Midtown on a pleasant afternoon searching for the ""best"" Mexican in Brooklyn. 35 minute commute on the R train, coming out to a pretty much foreign land. Thankfully the restaurant was only one block from the train. Housed by all sorts of Mexican restaurants, but we found our destination.Hustling, bustling... and very packed I might add, with blasting Spanish music. Loved it. Kids running all over the place as well - we were the only two Asians in the spot, which only meant one thing. We hit the jackpot, true authentic Mexican food. Score!We ordered tacos. Lots of them. 2 carne asada, 2 spicy enchilada, 1 pollo, 1 chorizo. All grande sized, all $2.25 each. Score again! Stick to my advice, ask them for their salsa picante sauce. Ooze that biatch all over your tacos, with the green sauce, and fresh lime juice... and it won't disappoint. Delicious!!! I definitely recommend the enchilada spicy pork taco, and the chorizo taco. Yummy goodness. Their tacos are so cute, the come in a little cone shape. We also ordered a regular nacho, which had cheese, beans, lettuce and guac. It wasn't that worth it, since there were less than 8 chips on the plate and it was $5. The food came out very fast, all of them perfectly lined on the plate, and the service was great, although I had the urge to speak Spanish the whole time. Back to the tacos. We were freaking stuffed by the end of the meal. Note that they have tons of sodas/non-alcoholic beverages to choose from, but no beer. After 4 years of living in NYC, I finally made it to Sunset Park, thank you for showing me something real, other than Chipotle!",4.0
I totally forgot to update my review when I found their health inspection results. They have rats. A TON of places around here do.

"I think every five star review of this place is a bit overblown. That doesn't mean this place isn't worth a visit. It surely is. It's a perfect excuse to get your butt out to Sunset Park, which is well worth hanging out in for an afternoon that blurs into evening. It's also a dream restaurant if you value the kind of place where the food is good, inexpensive, correct enough that it's packed with expats and their children, the service is great and the decor fits the place perfectly: no pretension, just a comfortable room full of tables and chairs in wood and earth tones with some good music playing low in the background.To be honest, being here felt one hell of a lot like being in Mexico. And I'll admit I love Mexico. But the food has to be the bottom line. First off, I expected the pork tacos to be better than the beef, because in most cases that's a safe assumption. Not so here. The spicy pork (enchilada) and roast pork proved nearly indistinguishable, due to the overwhelming chipotle flavor of the red salsa. The fried pork, without the red salsa, fared much better. But both the beef (al pastor) and tongue (lengua) were  top notch. Even the chicken, which ought to be lousy, was good, coming augmented with some delicious guac.Oh, the guac was good, worth ordering, though the portion was small. Biggest surprise? The ceviche.

"What we were originally looking for was the non-existent Taco Bell that used to be in Sunset Park.. but we were foolish to think of even eating Mexican fast food in what seemed to be the ultimate neighborhood for real, authentic Mexican food. We walked through the door and appeared to be the only non-Mexican customers in the restaurant. When we walked through the doors of Tacos Matamoros, we were approached by a hostess who greeted us in Spanish and then waitressed by a waitress who only understood our orders if we did the finger-pointing-menu technique.We ordered the carne asada and enchilada taco (both grande), a tostada de ceviche and a huge platter of pork chops with smoothies to drink and we were still craving for more!! The pork was extremely moist and it fell off the bone with great ease. The red sauce in which the pork was drenched in was absolutely finger licking delish, especially with the perfectly cooked rice and beans. The tacos we ordered were awesome, except i wish I had asked for limes and green/hot sauce to go with. The tostada de ceviche was on the eh side, if it were up to me, I would've opted for the one topped with meat.All in all, it was a tasty adventure for a beautiful Tuesday afternoon. I wouldn't mind driving the distance again to taste some of the other items on their menu.

"One of my favorite Saturday nights is dinner with friends at Tacos Matamoros followed by a refreshing 9 block walk to Melody Lanes for some bowling and revelry. It really doesn't get much better than that. And, truly, the most incredible portion of that evening is typically the experience of getting the check at Tacos Matamoros. I've been there twice with 10+ people and the bill has never exceed $125. That's right, multiple appetizers, entrees for all, and even an occasional dessert and the check is typically right around $10 per person. It's absolutely amazing.The food here is good but not mind blowing. That's OK though, it's predominantly street-style fare (well, at least what my decidedly American crowd typically orders) done well in a comfortable setting. Having a fluent Spanish speaker with you can be an asset, but we've been very capable of getting by without. The last time my friends and I went, we were seated in the back of the restaurant in a room that's beyond the kitchen. The room itself is not an issue but it seems like it's easy for the waitstaff to forget you back there. As a result, our service that night was decidedly worse than on prior trips.I wouldn't say this is the best Latin fare I've had in Brooklyn. That title goes to the Red Hook Ball Fields. But, if you aren't up for figuring out how the hell you are going to get to Red Hook or you just want a laid back evening or you are in the mood to do some bowling after dinner, Matamoros is a great option.

"After eating our way through Sunset Park's Asian area for Chinese and Vietnamese, we made our way toward the R train for the final stop: Matamoros. Matamoros is on a block with several other Mexican taquerias so the choices for tacos were many, but our stomachs were capable of only one more meal.  Upon entering on a late Saturday afternoon, I got a really good feeling--plenty of locals eating a variety of food (not just tacos here), a comfortable, warm dining area, and a menu full of options.  It's a big place, and we the waiters sat us way in the back where we gringos would not distract the locals from their late lunchesDespite the encyclopedic options, we came for the tacos, and tacos are what we got (along with the delicious horchata and jamaica, a really dark purple drink made from hibiscus flowers that tasted like POM). Tacos come in 2 sizes here: regular and SUPER.  The difference between the 2 wasn't really in size, it was that the SUPER was wrapped like a cone and had a heap of guacamole on top.  My 3 regulars were simple and solid--the lengua taco was clearly the best of the 3 as there was a good char on the outside and was topped with diced onions and cilantro along with a side of green and red salsa and radishes.  My pastor tacos were not bad but the pork was really stringy. However for less than $2 per taco, I was more than satisfied with what I ate. I will say that as we walked in and as we walked out, I noticed that no one else was eating tacos...they were eating heartier, full-plate meals so it's possible that the tacos aren't even the best thing to order here. Someone needs to tell the gringos this.",3.0
Customer service should be a priority in any restaurant but it is clearly not in this one. I went on a Saturday night with a party of 5. We had to walk all the way to the back where the waitresses were cluttered so they could seat us. As soon as we seated ourselves (no one seated us which should've been the first sign to run) we were handed the menus but the waitress did not come to ask what we wanted to drink until 20 minutes later. Therefore at that point we ordered our drinks and entrees before she left for another half hour. We were given our drinks and food in another 20 minutes. After that the waitress completely forgot about us and never came back. One of us was missing a fork so we asked one of the bus boys to please get one for us - nope didn't happen. I had to walk back to the waitress station to ask for a fork! When we were done with our drink and food we wanted another set of drinks but again our waitress was no where in sight. So we waived at another waitress and ordered our drinks with her - nope that didn't happen either. About 20 minutes after ordering the drinks I walk back to where the waitresses are and inquire about our drinks. She claims they have not come out yet I see them just standing on the counter! Mind you they have margarita slush machine where you press down a handle and it takes a few seconds to fill up a damn cup. So I demand for the check and no one even wanted to take my credit card to charge me. One of them finally takes it from me and has me sign. Of course I leave no tip and am extremely upset at the service! If you want to wait over an hour for a plate of food and one drink and another hour for someone to come and give you the check be my guest! They are extremely unprofessional and I am never coming here again!,1.0
"Started out a cinco de mayo taco crawl here. We got 4 pequenos tacos......2 chorizo @ $1.75 each and 2 al pastor (roast pork) @ $1.25 each. The chorizo were very good, maybe a 8.5/10, and the al pastor were decent, maybe an 8/10. The salsa picante and the tomatillo salsa were both pretty spicy.Nice waitress but she had no idea what I was asking about since I was speaking English.

"I was taken here today and treated by a friend. It's clean, spacious, but wasn't as 'authentic feeling' as the name might suggest, in regards to decor, but whatever. We got seated, were able to choose a different table, and the waitress showed up in a decent amount of time. I had to order chips and salsa to tie us over, which, whatever. They serve the chips and salsa with two sauces....ohmygosh. The first sauce I tried was this verde sauce. The hint of citrus lingered deliciously amongst the heat of the jalepenos and the fragrance of the cilantro. The saltiness of the chips paired so so so nicely with this sauce to make a delightful treat. I tried the next sauce, which I easily identified as a chipotle sauce, and reluctantly tasted it (my personal preference essentially has me lean away from anything chipotle-related). I was surprised at how nice it tasted - it had a great amount of smoke and spice. It was thick and rich and did not taste at all salty. I preferred the verde salsa, but did indulge in the chipotle salsa a few times in my chips consumption. After our waitress came by the second time to see if we were ready to order, I said yes, I was, and went ahead to order the 8 dollar, 12 inch Carne Asada burrito. OH.MY.GOOOOSH. The beef was perfectly seasoned. it was perfectly tender. It was cut into the perfect tiny size. The pieces of fat were left on so that all that delicious beefy flavour would explode all over one's taste buds. I was thoroughly surprised and excited to find that those were the contents of my huge 12-inch burrito. I have two downfalls to point out (although that damn carne asada really wins all stars and gets the gold cup of delish):My pal and I decided that the guacamole that topped the burrito was lack-luster, but we can't all be guacamole pros, now can we?  Also, I'm a wuss when it comes to spice though, and in the middle of my burrito (which really seemed to rival the size of a yule-log), I did scoop out approximately 3 tablespoons worth of straight up raw onionl I had a hard time enjoying it due to the spice, and i'm pretty sure it was the onion saturated middle that did me in on that end. BUT! While I was able to still breathe through my nose and taste something other than burn on my tongue, I was in heaven. Burrito heaven....and I honestly can't remember the last time I'd visited there. I'll totally go back.",4.0

"Have no fear, they have a big restaurant, so if you don't see any seating in the front they have some more room in the back.I never knew that Sunset Park was also known as Little Mexico until I went to this restaurant (and the fact that I watched Blood Bloods the night before). The al pastor was $1.50/small and $2.50/grande. Get the grandes. The grandes were approximately the standard size of a taco, wrapped neatly in a little packet. The pork was crisp on the outside and tender on the inside. You can ask for the condiments - onions, cilantro, red onions - on the side.The tortillas were super soft. Very tasty. The chicken fajita ($11.00) was a huge portion. It came with soft chicken, cooked perfectly with sauteed onions and peppers. The dish came with soft rice, refried beans, gaucamole, and freshly sliced raw tomatoes. There was only a small amount of guacamole, but it packed a punch. However, it was very very salty, which is why I guess, there was so little about it. Great place, I would definitely come back.",4.0
"Imagine the Red Hook hawker trucks. Now take out the English signs, and reduce the prices by more than half, and you have Tacos Matamoros.

"After eating our way through Sunset Park's Asian area for Chinese and Vietnamese, we made our way toward the R train for the final stop: Matamoros. Matamoros is on a block with several other Mexican taquerias so the choices for tacos were many, but our stomachs were capable of only one more meal.  Upon entering on a late Saturday afternoon, I got a really good feeling--plenty of locals eating a variety of food (not just tacos here), a comfortable, warm dining area, and a menu full of options.  It's a big place, and we the waiters sat us way in the back where we gringos would not distract the locals from their late lunchesDespite the encyclopedic options, we came for the tacos, and tacos are what we got (along with the delicious horchata and jamaica, a really dark purple drink made from hibiscus flowers that tasted like POM). Tacos come in 2 sizes here: regular and SUPER.  The difference between the 2 wasn't really in size, it was that the SUPER was wrapped like a cone and had a heap of guacamole on top.  My 3 regulars were simple and solid--the lengua taco was clearly the best of the 3 as there was a good char on the outside and was topped with diced onions and cilantro along with a side of green and red salsa and radishes.  My pastor tacos were not bad but the pork was really stringy. However for less than $2 per taco, I was more than satisfied with what I ate. I will say that as we walked in and as we walked out, I noticed that no one else was eating tacos...they were eating heartier, full-plate meals so it's possible that the tacos aren't even the best thing to order here. Someone needs to tell the gringos this.",3.0
Customer service should be a priority in any restaurant but it is clearly not in this one. I went on a Saturday night with a party of 5. We had to walk all the way to the back where the waitresses were cluttered so they could seat us. As soon as we seated ourselves (no one seated us which should've been the first sign to run) we were handed the menus but the waitress did not come to ask what we wanted to drink until 20 minutes later. Therefore at that point we ordered our drinks and entrees before she left for another half hour. We were given our drinks and food in another 20 minutes. After that the waitress completely forgot about us and never came back. One of us was missing a fork so we asked one of the bus boys to please get one for us - nope didn't happen. I had to walk back to the waitress station to ask for a fork! When we were done with our drink and food we wanted another set of drinks but again our waitress was no where in sight. So we waived at another waitress and ordered our drinks with her - nope that didn't happen either. About 20 minutes after ordering the drinks I walk back to where the waitresses are and inquire about our drinks. She claims they have not come out yet I see them just standing on the counter! Mind you they have margarita slush machine where you press down a handle and it takes a few seconds to fill up a damn cup. So I demand for the check and no one even wanted to take my credit card to charge me. One of them finally takes it from me and has me sign. Of course I leave no tip and am extremely upset at the service! If you want to wait over an hour for a plate of food and one drink and another hour for someone to come and give you the check be my guest! They are extremely unprofessional and I am never coming here again!,1.0
"Started out a cinco de mayo taco crawl here. We got 4 pequenos tacos......2 chorizo @ $1.75 each and 2 al pastor (roast pork) @ $1.25 each. The chorizo were very good, maybe a 8.5/10, and the al pastor were decent, maybe an 8/10. The salsa picante and the tomatillo salsa were both pretty spicy.Nice waitress but she had no idea what I was asking about since I was speaking English. Seeing as we were the only white non-hispanics in there I can see how she wouldn't need to.If I trek back here I think I'll try a torta or cemita......and brush up on my Spanish before I go!",4.0
"I was taken here today and treated by a friend. It's clean, spacious, but wasn't as 'authentic feeling' as the name might suggest, in regards to decor, but whatever. We got seated, were able to choose a different table, and the waitress showed up in a decent amount of time. I had to order chips and salsa to tie us over, which, whatever. They serve the chips and salsa with two sauces....ohmygosh. The first sauce I tried was this verde sauce. The hint of citrus lingered deliciously amongst the heat of the jalepenos and the fragrance of the cilantro. The saltiness of the chips paired so so so nicely with this sauce to make a delightful treat. I tried the next sauce, which I easily identified as a chipotle sauce, and reluctantly tasted it (my personal preference essentially has me lean away from anything chipotle-related). I was surprised at how nice it tasted - it had a great amount of smoke and spice. It was thick and rich and did not taste at all salty. I preferred the verde salsa, but did indulge in the chipotle salsa a few times in my chips consumption. After our waitress came by the second time to see if we were ready to order, I said yes, I was, and went ahead to order the 8 dollar, 12 inch Carne Asada burrito. OH.MY.GOOOOSH. The beef was perfectly seasoned. it was perfectly tender. It was cut into the perfect tiny size. The pieces of fat were left on so that all that delicious beefy flavour would explode all over one's taste buds. I was thoroughly surprised and excited to find that those were the contents of my huge 12-inch burrito. I have two downfalls to point out (although that damn carne asada really wins all stars and gets the gold cup of delish):My pal and I decided that the guacamole that topped the burrito was lack-luster, but we can't all be guacamole pros, now can we?  Also, I'm a wuss when it comes to spice though, and in the middle of my burrito (which really seemed to rival the size of a yule-log), I did scoop out approximately 3 tablespoons worth of straight up raw onionl I had a hard time enjoying it due to the spice, and i'm pretty sure it was the onion saturated middle that did me in on that end. BUT! While I was able to still breathe through my nose and taste something other than burn on my tongue, I was in heaven. Burrito heaven....and I honestly can't remember the last time I'd visited there. I'll totally go back.",4.0

"NYC taco scene: I thought I had you all figured out. Brooklyn never came to mind as a destination for Mexican food. Nah, for that Queens would take the golden medal. That is, until I came to Tacos Matamoros.Seriously mind blowing tacos. They've perfected the combination of corn tortilla, soft meat, spice, and freshness. Pequeno tacos last for about four bites, and are all amazing. Tortillas are sweet and fresh tasting, definitely not soggy (which is often a hazard of getting street tacos in Queens), not too doughy, but rather pliable, and blissfully toasted on the bottom. Meat selections were all fantastic. Enchilada (spicy pork) was my favorite, melding pulled pork with picante spices. Carne asada (beef) was big and meaty but it was a bit on the dry side for me -- nothing that a fresh squeeze of lime and a spoonful of fresh tomatillo sauce (which is served on the side) can't cure. Al pastor (slow cooked pork) was very soft and satisfying.Toppings are simple and refreshing too: fresh onions which appear to have been soaked in lime to remove the bite, combined with fragrant cilantro. Whole radishes. All with a mean squeeze of lime. Does wonders to brighten up the dish.Matamoros - how do you do it?Queens: meet your match. I would put Matamoros up there with the taco trucks on Roosevelt and Nixtamal in Corona.",5.0

"Whenever I'm in Sunset Park, I must try one of the taco joints. I have a few rules I follow when eating tacos:1) The restaurant must have the word ""taco"" in the name2) Tacos should be $2.50 or less3) Tacos available a la cartWithout either of these, they'll likely automatically, but not always, lose a star. (In my mind, it's some complicated formula for ""quality."")While the menu is extensive, taco is in the name and the selection of fillings is pretty decent. We got pastor, chorizo, carnitas, and chicken taquitos. Portion sizes were good, the meats were well cooked (pastor in particular), and the red salsa seemed to be made with chipotles (it had a smokey flavor).

"This is not a practical destination when you live in Greenpoint. For some reason, it seems like a silly decision to travel by train for over 2 hours (there and back) to spend less than an hour at a restaurant. I mean really, how long does it take you to wolf down tacos? Yesterday, we took advantage of a borrowed pick up truck and stopped at this taqueria after an Unlucky household errand. I was originally going to stop at my standby, La Flor de Piaxtla, but figured I should see what all this hype was about. After the meal, it occurred to me that none of you have felt the urge to enter the slightly grimey Flor and apparently have no idea what you're talking about.First off, I don't need guacamole on my taco. I want to taste the flavors of the meat, onion, and cilantro and I don't want anything distracting me. This gigantic dollop of guacamole was the best part of my carne asada taco. It was also, the worst part of my carnitas taco. The carnitas were tender and salty, just the way I like them, and the guacamole just ROBBED them of the spotlight. The carne asada, however, tasted as if it had been marinated in Chef Boyardee tomato sauce. Um, no thanks. I left half that taco on my plate. THAT SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN IF YOU ONLY ORDERED TWO TACOS. Maybe if I had a taco PLATTER in front of me, but really...In addition to the subpar dining experience, the waitress gave us guacamole that we didn't ask for. Assuming that it came with the salsa we ordered, we ate some of it (it was pretty good when mixed with the salsa)...and at the end of the evening she comes with the check, then proceeds to say ""Oh wait...the guacamole costs more.."" and tries to edit the check...based on something we didn't order. All in all, I'm not impressed. I hope you check out La Flor de Piaxtla. It's no frills, with a salsa station and dim lighting, but you won't regret it. I promise.",3.0

The location may be a turn-off to some, but i like it. If this place were in Park Slope, there would be an hour wait every night. I'd rather take a 10 minute train ride and be seated immediately.

"Not the world's best, but at least it was cheap. However, the service was pretty bad. Some things we ordered never arrived, others came at separate times, drinks were never refilled, and the staff seemed generally apathetic. The tacos for two dollars are a pretty good deal (the larger ones come with a pretty good guac), but beware of some of the other offerings. I tried the ceviche tostada, and it was the worst ceviche of my life. I'm used to the peruvian traditional type, based in white fish, citrus, and cilantro. What they served was some strange amalgamation of cheap shrimp, squid, octopus and a few unidentifiable pieces covered in an overly sweet tomato base. The seafood was really hard, like it had recently been under defrosted. However, that's probably my fault for ordering seafood here.While it's cheap, there are several better options in the neighborhood, and they have better service too.",2.0

That is, until I came to Tacos Matamoros.Seriously mind blowing tacos. They've perfected the combination of corn tortilla, soft meat, spice, and freshness. Pequeno tacos last for about four bites, and are all amazing. Tortillas are sweet and fresh tasting, definitely not soggy (which is often a hazard of getting street tacos in Queens), not too doughy, but rather pliable, and blissfully toasted on the bottom. Meat selections were all fantastic. Enchilada (spicy pork) was my favorite, melding pulled pork with picante spices. Carne asada (beef) was big and meaty but it was a bit on the dry side for me -- nothing that a fresh squeeze of lime and a spoonful of fresh tomatillo sauce (which is served on the side) can't cure. Al pastor (slow cooked pork) was very soft and satisfying.Toppings are simple and refreshing too: fresh onions which appear to have been soaked in lime to remove the bite, combined with fragrant cilantro. Whole radishes. All with a mean squeeze of lime. Does wonders to brighten up the dish.Matamoros - how do you do it?Queens: meet your match. I would put Matamoros up there with the taco trucks on Roosevelt and Nixtamal in Corona.",5.0
"Cheap, quick, delicious, great service.Went on a packed Sunday afternoon. There were no tables so the guys ran across the street and brought a table and chairs from the restaurant there. A little funny, but they did it.I got a veg burrito with no cheese which was delicious. The tortilla was really really good. Bf got chorizo burrito which he devoured. Tortilla chips were delicious - golden and crispy, and the guacamole, which I am a big critic of, was fantastic and fresh. They also have mexican sodas. The staff was really attentive and nice.Decor/atmosphere lacks a little, but it doesn't really matter at all.",5.0
"Okay, I've eaten here three times already.  The place deserves five stars.  Price, decor, food - everything is above expectations.  I had a burrito one time.  It was great.  The tacos are delicious and I believe that on some days they make the tortillas by hand.  Sometimes they use regular commercial tortillas.  I had the mole poblano, it was tasty and not too spicy.  Guacamole is a must, evn though they charge a little for it.Oh, I forgot, the flavored waters are all delicious.  They change the flavor on each day- tamarind, pina, coco, etc.  They do not serve beer - which is good because it has the comfortable, family environment.overall five stars.Alex",5.0
"Whenever I'm in Sunset Park, I must try one of the taco joints. I have a few rules I follow when eating tacos:1) The restaurant must have the word ""taco"" in the name2) Tacos should be $2.50 or less3) Tacos available a la cartWithout either of these, they'll likely automatically, but not always, lose a star. (In my mind, it's some complicated formula for ""quality."")While the menu is extensive, taco is in the name and the selection of fillings is pretty decent. We got pastor, chorizo, carnitas, and chicken taquitos. Portion sizes were good, the meats were well cooked (pastor in particular), and the red salsa seemed to be made with chipotles (it had a smokey flavor). Definitely enjoyable if you're in the neighborhood but it's not displacing my favorite taco joint of all, Los Hermanos.",4.0
"This is not a practical destination when you live in Greenpoint. For some reason, it seems like a silly decision to travel by train for over 2 hours (there and back) to spend less than an hour at a restaurant. I mean really, how long does it take you to wolf down tacos? Yesterday, we took advantage of a borrowed pick up truck and stopped at this taqueria after an Unlucky household errand. I was originally going to stop at my standby, La Flor de Piaxtla, but figured I should see what all this hype was about. After the meal, it occurred to me that none of you have felt the urge to enter the slightly grimey Flor and apparently have no idea what you're talking about.First off, I don't need guacamole on my taco. I want to taste the flavors of the meat, onion, and cilantro and I don't want anything distracting me. This gigantic dollop of guacamole was the best part of my carne asada taco. It was also, the worst part of my carnitas taco. The carnitas were tender and salty, just the way I like them, and the guacamole just ROBBED them of the spotlight. The carne asada, however, tasted as if it had been marinated in Chef Boyardee tomato sauce. Um, no thanks. I left half that taco on my plate. THAT SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN IF YOU ONLY ORDERED TWO TACOS. Maybe if I had a taco PLATTER in front of me, but really...In addition to the subpar dining experience, the waitress gave us guacamole that we didn't ask for. Assuming that it came with the salsa we ordered, we ate some of it (it was pretty good when mixed with the salsa)...and at the end of the evening she comes with the check, then proceeds to say ""Oh wait...the guacamole costs more.."" and tries to edit the check...based on something we didn't order. All in all, I'm not impressed. I hope you check out La Flor de Piaxtla. It's no frills, with a salsa station and dim lighting, but you won't regret it. I promise.",3.0
"The. Best.Tacos, rice and beans, etc... they seem so simple. It almost seems impossible to mess them up, but countless restaurants do. There are a few that are pretty good, but still not great. This place is great. And it's not ""great for NYC""; this is genuinely good mexican food- even your California friends will agree.The waitstaff is super friendly but can be a tad slow. The location may be a turn-off to some, but i like it. If this place were in Park Slope, there would be an hour wait every night. I'd rather take a 10 minute train ride and be seated immediately. Definitely worth the trip, but if you don't want to go that's fine. More for me.",5.0
"Not the world's best, but at least it was cheap. However, the service was pretty bad. Some things we ordered never arrived, others came at separate times, drinks were never refilled, and the staff seemed generally apathetic. The tacos for two dollars are a pretty good deal (the larger ones come with a pretty good guac), but beware of some of the other offerings. I tried the ceviche tostada, and it was the worst ceviche of my life. I'm used to the peruvian traditional type, based in white fish, citrus, and cilantro. What they served was some strange amalgamation of cheap shrimp, squid, octopus and a few unidentifiable pieces covered in an overly sweet tomato base. The seafood was really hard, like it had recently been under defrosted. However, that's probably my fault for ordering seafood here.While it's cheap, there are several better options in the neighborhood, and they have better service too.",2.0

It was all over after that.I ordered a Sprite, and they actually gave me the 20oz bottle; a tradition I've mostly seen in barrio Spanish restaurants, which is AWESOME. I kept it simple and ordered chicken tacos. (A previous reviewer discouraged ordering in English, but I had no problem with this. In fact, because I don't LOOK Spanish, the staff talked to me in English instead, even though I spoke to them in Spanish!) The tacos were HEAVENLY. Soft, fresh tortillas, tenderly-cooked chicken ... DAMN! Best tacos I've had in a LONG time. What made them taste so much better was their price; they were 2.50 a pop...and they were big enough to stave off hunger for a good part of the day. The health-conscious should take massive caution, though; these babies make their OWN grease. ;-)I should also mention that I didn't get sick! Last time I tried eating ""real"" tacos, I almost blew up a small office!This place is perfect. I expect to have more Mexican cravings in the future.",5.0
"Just get it straight - this is THE BEST Mexican food in NYC.  It's not fancy and is in Sunset Park in Brooklyn, which is by no means ""yuppied-up"".  So just come for the authentic Mexican food and really amazing margaritas.  The super tacos and the buritos are my favorite dishes.  Their guacamole is one of he best I have had.  Fantastic place and I am so thrilled to see it be Mexican owned and run.  Make the trip - trust me.",4.0
"My friends visiting from Australia were dying for Mexican.  Its next to impossible to get decent Mexican food out there as I was told.   I didn't want to take them to a dressed up NY place.  Having been to Mexico I know most of the Mexican food in NY is a lie.   New York does have a Little Mexico and this restaurant is smack in the middle of it.   We went for the pork chops with green chili, mole poblano, tamales, and a whole range of tacos.  These aren't the tacos you get in a taco truck, its fully laden with guacamole.  The mole was very good being a fan of the stuff.  With alcohol and my friends going nuts and over ordering the bill came out to about $15 a person.  Which is just outrageous!  Its good to go eat where the Mexicans eat.  I definitely will come back again.",4.0

It was so worth it that I can't put enough ""os"" in ""so"" to explain just how worth it was. We got a ton of food -- veggie burrito, 2 veggie tacos, cheese quesadillas, ceviche tostada, and a veggie tostada -- all delicious. The quesadillas were a real stand out. Nothing like the American version, these are deep fried with a generous chunk of queso blanco (I think) inside. They  also come with a side of rice & beans.

Their tacos, particularly any that involve pork, are mouth-watering and decent sized considering the $1.50-$2.00 price tag. That said, I could probably just keep eating them forever if I let myself. I suppose it could be improved by getting a liquor license, but then I wouldn't want anything to dull my senses as I enjoyed these tacos.",5.0
"¿Dónde está mi review?  As I read another yelper's review, I realized I should update my own.

"Picture this -- a Monday night around 10pm and I get an URGENT desire for some Mexican food (I'm pregnant, so when I say ""urgent"" I mean URGENT!!! lol).  Not really that big of an issue to most, but for a California transplant who is used to a certain calibre of Mexican food, I started to freak out a little!All of the Mexican food I've tried thusfar in NYC has been sub par, to say the least.  And with my current ""condition"", I couldn't gamble with some crap that would make me gag later.  So after reading other yelpers' reviews, I drove all the way across BK to Tacos Matamoros thinking it sounded like my best bet.Boy was I a happy camper!!!  Totally pleasant experience all the way around.  When I first walked in, I noted the cleanliness of the place and the friendly waitstaff.  Drinks and food came relatively quickly even though there was a decent sized crowd in there.  The portions were generous (I was literally STUFFED after my grande chorizo and grande carnitas tacos)!  All washed down with a small horchata (also delicious!)The icing on the cake was that the whole meal (my bf had some kind of pork chop dinner) was only like $18 bucks!  We quickly grabbed a to-go menu on the way out because my bf DEFINITELY will be making this crosstown trip for me plenty of times in the near future!  The Cali girl in me won't allow me to admit that these are as good as home, but this place is about as close as I think I'm gonna get...lol",4.0
"I might be biased because I did take out, and it took me a half hour to get home, so maybe if I were sitting there and the food was hot it would've gotten an extra star.I had the chicken quesadilla , nachos with guacamole, steak tacos and rice and beans. All of the dishes were mediocre, good, but nothing amazing. The guacamole was really good and I liked that the tacos were made with handmade tortillas (or so it tasted like it), but they were a little dry. At least it wasn't expensive - it came out to about $18. I would probably come back. The location wasn't hard to get to, parking was easy and it's open really late.",3.0
"YES.Best soft tacos I've had in NYC! Favorite flavors are enchilada (spicy pork), al pastor, carnitas, and chorizo.

"I've spent my entire life in the northeast, and the only thing I don't love about it is the utter lack of decent Mexican food. But living in Brooklyn right between Sunset Park and the Red Hook ballfields has vastly improved my life.Tacos Matamoros is the best of the Sunset Park set. Their tacos, particularly any that involve pork, are mouth-watering and decent sized considering the $1.50-$2.00 price tag. That said, I could probably just keep eating them forever if I let myself. I suppose it could be improved by getting a liquor license, but then I wouldn't want anything to dull my senses as I enjoyed these tacos.",5.0

Julius S. its definitely not as good as a tacos from a taco truck in California but these are some good tacos. If anybody goes to LA go to eagle rock and go to Rambos Tacos (yelp.com/biz/rambos-taco…) Trust me its worth the drive. They have amazing tacos and once you eat them Tacos Matamoros will be a 4-star compared to my personal rating of 5 stars for Rambos. I ordered 3 tripas 3 lengua 1 cabeza and 1 vegetarian. I ate it all. Definitely very good and cheap authentic tacos. Then I was still hungry so I ordered the Chicken Soup and it was very good and tasted homemade. Anyways I live in the Bronx but I am willing to go 2 hours on the train and subway to get these tacos since they seem like one of the few decent places around that are open late or till 1 at least. Great beer food. Too bad there are no amazingly delicious taco trucks open till 2 or 3 like there are in California.,4.0
"The reviews hyped it up too much.  I had a lengua taco.  Lengua is supposed to be soft and it should melt in your mouth.  The meat was too tough, I think it was overcooked. I also had the tostadas.  Everything on the tostadas was good except the beef.  It felt like the meat was not grilled.  My husband ordered the mole.  That was definitely good. He also had a carne asada taco, but again, their beef was overcooked, hard and rubbery. I was dissappointed, especially since I was able to find good Mexican food on 5th Avenue. Salsas were good though, and the Agua de Melon was delicious.",3.0
"A little hesitant about this place at first, but when you walk in, you feel like you are in Mexico- complete with novellas on the TVs.  We ordered guac- meh, nothing outrageous, it needed a little extra lime and salt.  We then got three tacos and three tamales to share.  The fish taco wasn't a ""fish taco"" with white sauce, it was like Christmas Eve dinner in a tortilla.  Not bad.  The carne asada was tasty, and the pork was OK.  But, the tamales were really good.  Nice sized, well priced (2 bucks?) and all very flavorful (since tamales can easily be bland). Flan for desert was not great. All in all, service was very fast, and courteous.Overall, 3.5 stars, but i decided to round down.  Really good when you consider what you are paying...

I have been slacking on reviewing and mostly trolling on here but I am finally making the big step and why not start with a place I live right by and bring all of my friends and family.The good:Cheap!!!BYOB!!!AuthenticFreshLarge menuThe bad:Not 24 hour...probably good thoI discovered this place about 2 years ago while cruising down 5th ave from bay ridge.  It was about 9 o'clock and my father and I were starving.  We saw Matamoros was pretty busy for a week day at 9 and knew this was the spot.  We were seated immediately and given the waitress with the best English.  We ordered a bit of everything...tacos, enchiladas, nachos, steak, chicken I can't even remember.  We also chatted with the Latino family of 4 next to us.  They have been going to this place for about 8 years and bring their kids there once a week maybe twice if they behave...very good sign!The food was brought to us bit by bit whenever it was ready and man was it good...soooooo good.  The check must have been around 30 dollars and we had at least 5 large plates of food.  You could spend 12 bucks for 2 people and leave stuffed.I have since moved down the block and bring friends here all the time and everyone leaves happy.  Tip - bring a bottle of wine or a case of beer and get a little silly there...also order a little at a time and enjoy your company,",5.0
"Poor quality tacos...very greasy, but somehow the meat was very dry! Delivery took an hour and 15 minutes. For 2 tacos, a piece of tres leches and guacamole that wasn't the best. The cake was good. At least the delivery guy seemed apologetic and rectified the situation. The girl who mans the phones there doesn't give a crap about customer service.",2.0
Julius S. its definitely not as good as a tacos from a taco truck in California but these are some good tacos. If anybody goes to LA go to eagle rock and go to Rambos Tacos (yelp.com/biz/rambos-taco…) Trust me its worth the drive. They have amazing tacos and once you eat them Tacos Matamoros will be a 4-star compared to my personal rating of 5 stars for Rambos. I ordered 3 tripas 3 lengua 1 cabeza and 1 vegetarian. I ate it all. Definitely very good and cheap authentic tacos. Then I was still hungry so I ordered the Chicken Soup and it was very good and tasted homemade. Anyways I live in the Bronx but I am willing to go 2 hours on the train and subway to get these tacos since they seem like one of the few decent places around that are open late or till 1 at least. Great beer food. Too bad there are no amazingly delicious taco trucks open till 2 or 3 like there are in California.,4.0
"The reviews hyped it up too much.  I had a lengua taco.  Lengua is supposed to be soft and it should melt in your mouth.  The meat was too tough, I think it was overcooked. I also had the tostadas.  Everything on the tostadas was good except the beef.  It felt like the meat was not grilled.  My husband ordered the mole.  That was definitely good. He also had a carne asada taco, but again, their beef was overcooked, hard and rubbery. I was dissappointed, especially since I was able to find good Mexican food on 5th Avenue. Salsas were good though, and the Agua de Melon was delicious.",3.0
"A little hesitant about this place at first, but when you walk in, you feel like you are in Mexico- complete with novellas on the TVs.  We ordered guac- meh, nothing outrageous, it needed a little extra lime and salt.  We then got three tacos and three tamales to share.  The fish taco wasn't a ""fish taco"" with white sauce, it was like Christmas Eve dinner in a tortilla.  Not bad.  The carne asada was tasty, and the pork was OK.  But, the tamales were really good.  Nice sized, well priced (2 bucks?) and all very flavorful (since tamales can easily be bland). Flan for desert was not great. All in all, service was very fast, and courteous.Overall, 3.5 stars, but i decided to round down.  Really good when you consider what you are paying... Id come back here.",3.0
"Just returned from a mid-late afternoon lunch-dinner for inexpensive, excellent food it's hard to do better. The place was only 20% filled, but people were coming in throughout. Incredible tastes & textures in the al pastore (soft cooked pork) tacos grande w/soft tortillas. Added the homemade chipotle sauce for just the right degree of heat. Also ate tostadas, con carne for me and vegetarian for spouse. The staff were patient with we two gringos. A new wood floor is going into the backroom, so that was closed off with plastic. Staff were happy. This is a find for us, 15 minutes from home.",5.0

"I just ordered nachos for $6... I got 6 nachos with a spoonful of guacamole, cheese, and lettuce.  Are the nachos worth $1 a piece? No, I think I'll buy a bag from the convenience store for half the price next time.",2.0
"we walked here three days straight while I was visiting.  They have nice, simple tacos, which they serve radishes, limes, and salsa with.  The small tacos are $1.25, with the large ones (which they just wrap in a larger tortilla with guacamole) at $2 and some change.We also ordered some nachos once.  They tasted okay; just cheese and stuff melted onto the chips, but didn't think they were worth the price (only gave like, 7 chips).Didn't get to try the other stuff on the menu, but the tacos were all we wanted.",4.0
"Went here while exploring the neighborhood because of all the good reviews.  I had the chicken burrito and my husband had the chicharones burrito.  The portions are big. We both found our meals to be just ok, and a little while after leaving we both felt a little queasy.  Initially the ambiance seemed fine, but towards the end of our meal 3 different people were allowed into the restaurant to go table to table asking people to either buy t-shirts, movies or just beg for money.  That was such an uncomfortable experience, and I was displeased that the proprietors didn't seem to care. Overall I would not recommend this place and will definitely not be going back.",2.0

"With so many reviews, why should you trust me?  Well, I'd like to think I know my tacos somewhat, having spent six months in Mexico back in the 1990s.  For the money, this place is not great but pretty good.  If you want calmness and serenity Tacos Matamoros is not your venue: it's packed with shouting kids, street vendors who come up to your table and try to sell you their wares, and a flat screen TV.  I was the only gringo in this place and when the waitress took my order she spoke to me in Spanish.  The only other place this has happened to me was in Miami.  If you don't speak Spanish be prepared to point.The meal began with a strange plate of plain radish and salsa.  I dipped the radish in the hot sauce, wasn't sure what to do with it.  Orchata was a disappointment, not very thick or spiced.I ordered a plate of four vegetarian tacos.  Each taco had two tortillas which tasted fried so by the end I was stuff to the gills.  I don't think the tortillas were made fresh, but to expect this in NY would be a little unrealistic.  I liked the way they packed the tacos, and the beans and rice were nice.  I also enjoyed the crumbly cheese on top which is authentic.For $11 total, it was a pretty good deal.  With the kids screaming in the background however I was relieved to step outside.  Not sure I would make a special trip to go back though I am intrigued by the strawberry atole.",3.0

"better than pinche taqueria:read this review - yelp.com/biz/pinche-taqu…the tacos are good, but dont know if i would want to go all the way here for them. chavellas is a lot better and a lot closer to me. the waitresses here are nice and gave me a mexi calendar when we left to mark down the days when we get horchata and tamales.note: get the pastor - it was kick-ass, almost tasted as good as the stuff i would get in tejas. so just to let you know gringos, the menu is in espanol and the senoritas like it when you butcher it. oh and pastor is marinated pork entrails!",3.0
The best chorizo taco i've ever eaten.,5.0
"Ok so I did not 'discover' this place - 44 reviews!  I thought it was good for what it was - cheap tasty tacos...  It also passed the gringo test - ie were one of 3 tables of gringos with the rest (say 15 or so) of the tables filled with locals...  worth a visit if your around the way, not sure if I would make a special trip.",4.0

"This place has good, fresh food but based on the reviews I expected so much more.  I definitely recommend the pork taco that everyone else enjoyed; it tasted like my mom's pernil wrapped in taco yumminess.  Besides that I feel like any competent cook could make equally as delicious a home made meal.  On top of everything I was forced to communicate in spanish, and my conversational spanish isn't perfect.  I left satisfied but it wasn't exceptional and I probably won't be going back.  Enjoy!",4.0
Excellent food. Superb service. If I lived closer I'd eat here every day. Seriously. I tried the carne asada taco and a chicken torta. Best Mexican food I've had in NYC by a long shot!,5.0
"This place rules.  Best Mexican food in New York.  My girlfriend and I went in to check this place out; we'd heard good things.   The place is pretty big, and the atmosphere is fun when it's busy.   We ordered four kinds of tacos: pork, roasted pork, carne asado, and chorizo.  whatever.  god darn delicious and cheap to boot.  We got a couple of Negro Modelos from a store down the street for $1.75 each, and I have to say, that sure keeps the tab down when you don't have to order $5 beers.",5.0

"The roast pork tacos were great- but the rest of the food was fine- not really stellar. Tacos Matamoros is a friendly place, though, with OK service and ample opportunities to buy bootlegged DVDs.

"They opened #2 closer to my pad but the original is still better. I like the tacos (most are $1), specifically the tacos al pastor (but I also like the lengua and chorizo) and the chalupas.

"I've been scouring Sunset Park for good Mexican since I moved here last year. Since I don't have anyone in that neighborhood, I tend to rely on the tried-and-true method: go to places that are crowded with locals. The third place I tried was this one, and it certainly was a charm. Tamales were really good, with big differences between the rojo and verde versions. Had enchiliadas, both verdes and moles, really good. I especially liked that their chicken is chunky and flavorful, not shredded and dry like so many other places. Burrito was pretty standard: meat, somewhat runny and lardarific refried beans, spanish rice, and a nice salsa verde with a lot of onions and cilantro. Tacos were perfect at $1 a piece: soft double white corn tortillas with a spoonful of meat and salsa verde. That's it. You might need three or four to fill up, but they go down easy.No beer served, but it is BYO so just hit one of the tiendas on 5th Ave.All in all, I don't think I'll be searching anymore. This place is really solid.",4.0
"I was all ready to call this place a hidden gem, but after seeing the long list of 4- and 5-star reviews I guess I can't do that. Okay then, I'll just call it a gem. I've been to this place 4 times and everything I've had has been great. I'm an especially big fan of the tortas. You can't go wrong with the choice of meat/filling, but I'm partial to the pastor option (actually, anything + pastor is generally a good idea, as several other posters have noted). Everything on the menu is really well cooked and seasoned -- a wonderful departure from most of the Mexican restaurants in NY.

"we rode from carroll gardens to sunset park for the tacos and damn, it was awesome! red hook ball fields and pinche taqueria can not even compare. $1.25 for pequeno tacos (size of your palm)-- you cant get a better deal! we had 3 each, and were full and content. Thats $3.75 for the best meal ever! We tried everything: spicy pulled pork, beef tongue (seriously, if you read my reviews, you know i LOVE beef tongue), brain (they fry it and it is crispy and delightful), tripe, and steak. dont be freaked out--- when in mexico, you should eat what the mexicans eat-- and its delicious and authentic. we also wanted the tamarindo, however they ran out and recommended fresh cantaloupe juice. get the cantaloupe juice! its refreshing!restaurant looks newly rennovated and the kitchen looked very clean as well (you can catch a glimpse as you get to the bathroom in the back, which is also clean).when youre ready for the check ask for the cuenta (check).",5.0
"fantastico!  three of us went for dinner and ate like champs for only $32!  the food is super fresh, tasty and original.  the restaurant is filled with people from mexico, central and south america and it's a nice blend of couples, families and friends out for a good time.  we are tacos with chorizo, tongue and carnitas, as well as flautas de pollo.  the salsas are bright, acidic and spicy and the meats were all juicy and well prepared.  definitely check this place out.",4.0
