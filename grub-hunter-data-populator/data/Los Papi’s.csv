"THE BEST CUBAN SANDWICH. Period.I was hesitant to write a review, because I don't want anyone else to know about this place. The price is very reasonable, $8 for the cuban sandwich. It was stuffed with tender and juicy pork, complimented with the perfect crispy pork skin and pork fat, topped with slice of ham and swiss cheese, and smeared with just the right amount of mayo and mustard. It was simple but soooo damn good!  I wish I worked in Dumbo so I could have this for lunch everyday. Unreal. They have other lunch options, all looked delicious. I will definitely be back.",5.0
"Really Good.I work close by and occasionally stop in during lunch time to get some pork, rice and beans with some hot sauce. The price is very reasonable - $6 for lunch special. This has become one of my go-to-spots for a quick, delicious, and affordable lunch. Would recommend.",5.0
"Okay, let me tell you something before I start. I am Dominican and one of the pickiest people in the world and to me this is the best home-cooking-style Dominican food that I have tasted in New York!.. Starting from their beans to their brisket special they are both great!!!!!! The portions are huge for the price that you pay. $7 dollars straight for baked chicken, rice and beans lunch special. Brisket, Fish or any other choice will be $8 or $9 max $10 no more than than. Go to Los Papi's for lunch or breakfast, which is also delicious! They have sandwiches and Egg Any Style, but who is going to order that we you can have Mangu with los tres golpes (fried eggs, salami, and fried cheese) come on!Keep it up papis!!!You are the best!!!",5.0
"The Cuban sandwich ($7) was delicious, even though it did kick my ass!",5.0
"Omg the cubano was great. The man of men type cubano. I ate it and was afraid of it to end. The pork was great. Each bite had a mix of the crispy skin, lean pork, fatty moist pork, light creamy mayo, cheese and pickle . I was in heaven. I would definetly come back. Ambiance is like an old cafeteria but who cares. I'm there for good food. I also ordered the pork plate with plantains and avacado. I ate that as well!!!! I'm glad they didn't salt the meat so you can taste the meats natural flavor. I get to choose with salt or not. Got home and sprinkled some himalayan pink salt on it and bam!!! Perfect.",4.0
"This was close by to where we were staying during our visit. On the last day prior to our departure we decided to have lunch here based on the reviews on Yelp. This is a local hole in the wall with a B rating posted outside of their shop. Sometimes the better foods come from places that aren't rated A for cleanliness. We ordered the Cuban sandwich and their baked chicken meal with rice and mashed potatoes, and a side order of fried plantains. The Cuban sandwich is the real winner. They really load the sandwich up with pork. Portion size is enough to share between two. The bakes chicken was good as well but the breast piece was on the dry side. The rice was decent, had some flavors. The mashed potato was disappointing as it lacked any flavor or seasoning and was only served on its own. The fired plantains was also kind of disappointing as it didn't taste fresh from the fryer. This place is kind of off ways for most people as there's not much around the neighborhood. I told my friend to check it out but he said they don't open on weekends. If you're around for lunch I'd recommend giving their Cuban sandwich a try. It's cheap, service is friendly and the Cuban is worth getting.",4.0
"My first time here, I saw a lot of people comment on their cuban sandwich. I never had one like this, I've always had the typical sliced pork with the pickle and the mustard and the melted cheese.this one is shredded roast pork, they even put some pieces of the country skin on the sandwich there is also some type of salami and a regular cold cut type ham along with the melted cheese. No pickle but maybe that's not authentic, not sure, I do kind of miss it though. It is an incredible sandwich though, the bread is phenomenal. I hope I'm working in this area again so I can stop in for another one",4.0
Well I ordered breakfast  from them this morning 7am it is now 11:45am and I still haven't received it when I called they said they forgot this is a place I order breakfast  everyday I know people make mistakes but just the way they went about it was like o well I forgot  it is what it is smh so now I will no longer order from this place,1.0
"Every time I want to eat something really quicklysnd for a cheap price, I mean not the pizza or a sandwich, I go to this place . Baked chicken and mashed potatoes are very good. You can also try beans or beef. The best thing about their ser ice is that they are fast. The neatness of the place is so good, but it is clean enough to fee comfortable.",4.0

I got the oxtail with rice and beans.. Amazing! The meat was so tender that I fell right off the bone. It was very flavorful and it doesn't hurt that it was only $8 for such a large portion of food!
