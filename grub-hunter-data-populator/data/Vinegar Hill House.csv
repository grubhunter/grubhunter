"It's a damn travesty that this place isn't rated higher. So you spoiled wannabe critics have to walk through a quiet and seemingly ""gritty"" area - which by the way is only 2 blocks. Two whole blocks!! Ask the residents of next door Dumbo in their multi-million dollar apartments how ""dangerous"" it is. So you cheapskate wannabe critics want lower prices. How come 3 Star Michelin restaurants can charge an arm and a leg and be located in small remote town in France or Spain but this lovely gem can't have fair pricing in this location?  It has to be cheap because it's not in the UES?And for the pampered wannabe critics who must have their every whim catered to with white glove service. Seriously. What? No complaints about the mismatched rustic furniture or decor? What else do you not like? The waitstaff don't wear uniforms? We've been coming here for years. And we just finished a fantastic brunch - my first brunch here. Everything was superb. The food was just wonderful. The pork and grits- great. The pear sourdough pancake - sublime and possibly the best pancake in Brooklyn.  The lamb shoulder special - so good. We had a lovely stroll through the neighborhood. We were able to take our time to talk and catch up over a meal like real friends. And got to do it all in a non-pretentious restaurant that was great for a small group to just enjoy each other's company on a Saturday afternoon. Almost felt like my own Brooklyn version of a Woody Allen movie (a good one). There's no such thing as perfection. But this place is definitely 5 Star worthy.",5.0
"Now you've done it, Vinegar Hill. I've come here for brunch at least twice a month for the past two years since it's one of the only restaurants within walking distance. Due to location it's overpriced af, but again and again my indolence prevailed over my common sense. Today's brunch was the last straw - my ""seasonal"" pancake (seasonal-my-tuches, it hasn't changed in over a year!) was drowned in cheap sugary maple syrup, and the trout egg benedict was fishy and mediocre. Can someone finally open a decent restaurant in the area, or nah?",2.0
"I have been to VHH twice for brunch, both times I experienced very good service, underwhelming grub, and left with a much lighter wallet. 2.5 stars! Service - friendly as fuc*. Make reservations before coming. Food - the omelette was as dry as a high desert at midnight, while their eggs benedict were nothing to write home about. Also, a small bag of Ruffles with the $17 burger? Someone there should learn how to cook up some damn fries. I can.",3.0
"Amazing brunch experience in DUMBO! Came here after a weekend staycation. A bit off the beaten path from the F train but well worth it! We ordered the pork and grits, the large pear sourdough pancake, and the poached eggs and lamb hash special. Everything was delicious! Will definitely be coming back",5.0
"Gives a vibe of farm to table, supposedly sustainable, but there's nothing sustainable about having only one (mediocre) vegan option on the menu. The server was kind of enough to put in a ""vegan plate"" for me which I was really excited about. What did I get? Inedible vegetables here and there drenched in oil. Yeah, a place that only knows how to cook/use meat/dairy for flavor is totally sustainable as opposed to just eating the grains you feed the animals.",1.0
"Absolutely charming ambiance. Warm. Friendly. Great bar vibe. SO wanted to love it. But the acorn squash was poorly prepared with raw skin and an acrid olive tapenade. And the skirt steak was served rear in 1/2 inch cubes rather than thinly sliced. The side of creamed veggies was served as a slop - running all over the plate - and hideously salty. Just simple stuff - with short cuts and the ""we're cool and  don't need to take care like we used to"". A shame. $141 for one app, one entree and cornbread (with a huge dollop of butter drenching it) plus a decent bottle of Greek red wine. Will NOT be back.",2.0
"I came to this place with such high expectations and maybe that was my first mistake.  First of all, like some of the other reviewers state, this place is really in the middle of nowhere.  I don't often feel unsafe in NYC, but walking to this place, there are no other people are and it's totally desolate.  I kept thinking to myself, I could get mugged out here and no one would know...anyway once I got that out of my mind, we found the place and it is cozy and cute.It's highly rated on foursquare (and maybe that was a red flag too...) so we went in and were excited that we could get a seat at the bar without a wait.  The bartender seemed overwhelmed even though the bar wasn't that busy, and it took her a while to make our drinks and take our orders.  We weren't in a hurry and this only bothered me a little, but what came next is what I can't overlook.We ordered the corn bread, a salad, a pasta and the cast iron chicken.  It took FOREVER.  Almost 30 minutes from when we ordered for our salad to come out.  It was over dressed and soggy.  SO disappointing.  The flavors made sense together, but whatever dressing was on it was so over powering.  We didn't say anything though, since we were STARVING.  Another 15 minutes later, the  corn bread came out and it was completely BURNT.  So burnt that we couldn't even get them out of the pan.  So burnt that the bottom was hard and difficult to bite through.  We had to send it back because it was inedible.  Wanna know the response we got?  They couldn't guarantee that it wouldn't come out burnt again.  Um...ok?  What am I supposed to do with that information?  Are you telling me that we shouldn't have ordered it?  We were totally confused.We waited very PATIENTLY for them to come out again and the second time around, they were able to get it right.  The corn bread was good.  Not great, but good.The pasta dish was the ravioli and the flavors were a little strange and the portion was small.  The chicken?  Forget it.  It was so basic and came with basically nothing else except for a couple of oven cooked onions.  It was nothing special and frankly, despite all the sauce in the pan, it was kind of dry.  AND it was expensive!  $26 for two little pieces of undressed chicken in a cast iron pan...So, all in all, this place is out of the way, overpriced, the service leaves a lot of be desired and the food is nothing new.  I won't be back.",2.0
"If you're walking around starving in this neighborhood, you'll likely pass Vinegar Hill with its unrecognizable speak-easy'esque storefront. Upon entry to the quaint and cozy restaurant, the copper topped bar is turning out both classic manhattans and signature cocktails. The Pink Moon is a Vinegar Hill stand out as a spicy twist on a margarita with cucumber and hints of chili pepper.I tasted the Tagliatelle with a pork ragu. Hints of creme, fresh pasta, and a beautifully done pulled pork seal the deal on this dish although the saltiness is a bit overpowering. The fennel salad is absolutely flawless and the shaved pears will make grown men weep with tears of joy.After asking about how the steak was prepared and requesting the au jus on the side, I was a bit disappointed in the presentation of the steak. This was not because it wasn't cooked and presented nicely, but because it wasn't as described and the portion size of 5-6oz's simply doesn't do much to satisfy a grown mans appetite.I will surely visit Vinegar Hill house again, but will stick to the cast iron chicken next time as this really was the best of the bunch of entree's we had on the table.If you're looking to escape the beard bar restaurants of Williamsburg and want to take a walk on the river front of DUMBO, make Vinegar Hill the final stop on your night on the town.",4.0

"I love this place, not sure why it only has 3 stars but I think it's great. The food is simple but very well prepared so the natural flavors of your meal can shine through. They have a gorgeous backyard garden that's great for date night and I saw Jonah hill and Alia Shawkat when I was there last time! Food:- cornbread: a must get, it's sweet and moist with a pat of butter on top that's just the right amount of salty. The jalapeño adds a great tang- burrata: SO creamy! I wanted a second order. The onions with it were very well cooked as well- tequila cured fluke: not a very large portion but deeeelicious. The fluke was tender, not too fishy and zesty from the tequila lime. The yucca chips were very crunchy, which was a good texture mix up and cucumbers were nice and refreshing, great to eat with a small piece of jalapeño - tagliatelle: my boyfriend ordered and I had a bite. The ricotta was unreal. The ragu was with pork and I don't eat it so I can't attest to that but he said it was pretty good",4.0

Their entrees are perfectly cooked and the drinks are delicious.You might encounter a wait, but if you do, take some time to go toward the waterfront and watch the sun set against the bridge backdrop. It's beautiful.Once you return, have a cocktail here. They're all fabulously made and well-balanced.They have a wood-fire oven, an amenity lacking in most restaurants nowadays. The Red Wattle Chop (pork chop) is their signature dish. It's carefully sourced meat served medium rare to rare. I never thought I would like pork served any less than well-done but they pull it off.I've also had the chicken which is juicy, butter-basted goodness. The sauce is made from a red sherry jus that's part butter, part chicken. The only bad part is that the entree can be quite small (two small legs) for someone with a ravenous appetite. There are also no sides besides two halves of a shallot.",4.0
"Had a really lovely dinner last night in the back garden. Arrived around 9:45 or 10 o clock I believe.. Considering it was the first thing I ate all day, this was an even more incredible meal than perhaps it really was.. But, delicious none the less.. I.TOMATO AND CUCUMBER SALAD: We started with the heirloom tomatoes, cucumbers, peanut and maple ponzu  buttermilk dressing. It definitely reminded me of something Asian. Actually more so Chinese.. The maple ponzu, came across almost like Chinese Vinegar with the cucumbers and peanuts.. But, either way, it was good.. The basil added a really nice freshness as well.  We decided we would not have been upset if there was cilantro to.  ii.CORN AND EGGPLANT RISOTTO WITH EPAZOTE: The corn and eggplant risotto was our favorite thing of the night.  This was spectacular. I am very picky when it comes to my eggplant. It has to be exceptional for me to like it. This was exceptional.  The risotto was perfectly cooked, in addition to butter, they added creme fraiche at the end.. The ""sourness"" of the creme fraiche played well with the epazote in the dish.. Very happy there was no indication that parm was added.  It was sweet and creamy and just delicious.. To me, it tasted like they added marscapone cheese and epazote. But, they said it was creme fraiche.. Anyway, the dish is freaking beautiful.   iii.BROCCOLI THREE WAY. there was a lot going on here.. I didn't really know what all the flavors were but, i ""liked it a lot""  There was some creaminess going on, texture from waterchestnuts perhaps and the peanuts.. Whatever it was, i want more of it.  IV.RED WATTLE PORK CHOP Another really lovely dish.  I am very proud of them for serving this pork chop, rare essentially.  There were parts by the rib that were black and blue essentially.. But the outside still had a crispiness that reminds one of breakfast sausage or something really savory.. Just little hints of a crispy outside.   Served with a delicous potato salad and pickled blue berries..  Of high quality pork, roasted in there beautiful oven.  It was really nice. Something i use to take for granted when I would cook at home but, now a rare treat to get meat cooked this well and of this high quality.  The portion size was big enough for two.. In fact there was leftover food if you can believe it. We ordered a really nice bottle of wine and sat by ourselves in this gorgeous garden.. Almost reminded me of an English Country garden.. We were secluded and just in a really beautiful space.. Waitstaff was awesome..",5.0

Some say its desolate -- I say its uniquely quiet, charming, neighborhoody, and I would NOT be worried about getting mugged there. I keep reading that in other reviews.

Street parking available, and there is an art gallery across the street as well that was having an event when we visited at 1pm. I got the Pear Sourdough pancake and it was amazing. They served it with a hefty helping of butter, which I recommend you remove quickly or your pancake will taste VERY buttery very fast, not that I really minded but you might. We also indulged in a side of bacon to split. This is real bacon, not that store bought crap. This is the stuff my dad used to have hanging in the garage all winter, which totally grossed me out during my 7 year stint as a vegetarian. Great service, very organized,  and we didn't wait terribly long for our food. The only thing I can say disappointed me was the fact that they only had drip coffee and I love my americano in the morning.

They have definitely upped their Instagram game and show awesome specials - but rarely do we see those on the menu or does a server let us know. Last time we visited we sat at the bar with , sadly, really poor service on a Sunday night where the restaurant was maybe 20% full. Bar tender spoke to someone at bar entire time and we almost begged to get check and head out. Would love to see more inventive and seasonal dishes vs the staples that seem to have creeped back on - As a neighborhood place, sometimes you want a coffee and light breakfast, but they have pretty heavy meals and we always end up ordering just the sides. Always rooting for VHH as the space is just so inviting, but the food needs to change it up a bit more often and surprise their locals.",3.0
A lovely little gem located in a quiet part of Brooklyn near Dumbo. The decor is very cozy and the staff is very friendly too.The sourdough pancake was really delicious. The crispy edge and fluffy dough makes this one the best pancakes I've ever eaten. Topped with a tablespoon of butter and some maple syrup this was very simple yet extremely pleasant - and not pricey either.,5.0

"Tucked away on a street I'd never have visited,  in a neighbourhood I had never heard of, the restaurant was full on a Sunday at 3 when I stopped in for a late brunch, Despite the desolate surroundings, I guess many others had read the same rave Infatuation review I had seen that week.  Full marks for the cheese grits with pork (I am no grit expert but these were so much tastier than other grits I have had). The biscuit was spot on too.  Cocktails were pretty decent, and the service was fine despite the general exhaustion of the staff bought on by an unexpectedly busy day.  If they'd have had real coffee (espresso) I'd give them 4 stars.  But they don't. So come on guys, spend $300 on a coffee machine and turn a good brunch into a great one.",3.0

Took way too long to serve simple drinks and had such a negative energy. If I want to deal with sour ppl- I'd go back to work. We left after a drink and dined elsewhere. We will never be back.,1.0
"I love the Vinegar Hill House of about 5 years ago. Right now it is always spotty. They have definitely upped their Instagram game and show awesome specials - but rarely do we see those on the menu or does a server let us know. Last time we visited we sat at the bar with , sadly, really poor service on a Sunday night where the restaurant was maybe 20% full. Bar tender spoke to someone at bar entire time and we almost begged to get check and head out. Would love to see more inventive and seasonal dishes vs the staples that seem to have creeped back on - As a neighborhood place, sometimes you want a coffee and light breakfast, but they have pretty heavy meals and we always end up ordering just the sides. Always rooting for VHH as the space is just so inviting, but the food needs to change it up a bit more often and surprise their locals.",3.0
A lovely little gem located in a quiet part of Brooklyn near Dumbo. The decor is very cozy and the staff is very friendly too.The sourdough pancake was really delicious. The crispy edge and fluffy dough makes this one the best pancakes I've ever eaten. Topped with a tablespoon of butter and some maple syrup this was very simple yet extremely pleasant - and not pricey either.,5.0
"Absolutely charming. Great vibe, food is delicious, small and friendly. Not so many tourists since you have to know this places exists - usually by word of mouth.",4.0
"Tucked away on a street I'd never have visited,  in a neighbourhood I had never heard of, the restaurant was full on a Sunday at 3 when I stopped in for a late brunch, Despite the desolate surroundings, I guess many others had read the same rave Infatuation review I had seen that week.  Full marks for the cheese grits with pork (I am no grit expert but these were so much tastier than other grits I have had). The biscuit was spot on too.  Cocktails were pretty decent, and the service was fine despite the general exhaustion of the staff bought on by an unexpectedly busy day.  If they'd have had real coffee (espresso) I'd give them 4 stars.  But they don't. So come on guys, spend $300 on a coffee machine and turn a good brunch into a great one.",3.0
Do you like huge prices for very small amounts of food? Then you'll love it here.The food is fine. It's really nothing special. But please be warned: you will spend a very large amount of money for a very small amount of standard Brooklyn-type food.,1.0
I haven't yelped in awhile but I had the most amazing pasta special with a lamb offal sauce. The drinks are delicious (especially the gin with pear).Whiny yelp reviewers that complain about the price - maybe you should look ahead at the menu to see the prices at restaurants. If you can't afford it...maybe it's just not for you.,5.0
"If Money Ain't a Thang,...I'd make Vinegar Hill House my permanent kitchen. Just consistent beautiful and simple dishes. For Brunch: Best Omelette in the city. For Dinner: Cast Iron Chicken is an example of perfectly cooked chicken.",5.0

"Is the food good? Yes, it's unique, basic and tasty. However, they could use some points in the comfort level department. The outside setting, is adorable, however I felt like I was sliding off the chair, or I felt like I was going to break the flimsy compilation of wood that formed a ""chair"". The menu was severely lacking in vegetarian options, except for the salads, which were spectacular. The food was tasty, simple and portioned to be too small for a plate that was in general over $25.00.The desserts were too ridiculous, tasty, but ill conceived, and for 12,00 TOO EXPENSIVE. I wish there was more interaction and a hint of intuition on our waiter's behalf. We kept asking for napkins so the silverware wouldn't touch the tables. No extra napkins were provided. When asked for a piece of bread, such a demand was unable to be met by our waiter, Come on! Glad I came, but anyone who glorifies this place, needs to step out of the neighborhood, and the hipsterdom that has invaded. It was tasty, simplified food, with a too hefty price tag.",3.0
"This was my second time at Vinegar Hill House.  Like most other public radio loving, flea market shopping 30 something folks, I was charmed by the allure of wainscoting and exposed filament bulbs...reclaimed wood and a copper bar.  The restaurant is gorgeous inside.  A nice romantic date spot.  But the food is just very average.  I first ate here in 2010, and it was completely average.  Now, last night, after reading the yelp reviews, I decided to try it again, and it is still completely average.  I had the chicken.  It looked beautiful and I couldn't wait to dive in...but the flavor just wasn't good.  The jus was weird and too winey tasting, and the chicken itself was not moist - however the brussel sprouts were awesome.  My better half got the steak and again, it was just exceptionally average.  Normally, I wouldn't write a review since I was not overwhelmed either way - but I want to say that this place is extremely overpriced.  I think the decor and neighborhood keep us 30 somethings coming back.  But give me James or Prospect or No7 any day.  Better prices and MUCH better food.",3.0

"Quaint and intimate seating might lead you to believe this eatery is more rustic that it appears. However, this little restaurant packs a big punch!I had dinner this evening accompanied by a great wine from a truly creative and reasonably priced wine list. These thoughtful wines give a broad sampling of international flavors that match range of worldly influence appearing on the food menu.Service was consistently attentive and knowledgeable about the menu, having zero hiccups all evening.Each dish is deliberately executed with innovative flavors and techniques. The house specialty, a fatty Pork Chop cut with green garbanzo, pickled blueberry and rustic potato salad sounds like it could be overly complicated, yet was surprisingly well balanced. The tagliatelle with ragu was a textural dream with rich flavors that satisfy any pasta craving.Our evening ended with a play on smores with a chocolate mousse topped with brûlée marshmallow.It's worth the money for a special evening. Attentive and delicious.",4.0
"My wife and I were super excited to try this place out after seeing at show at St. Ann's Warehouse. And gosh, is the interior charming. But boy, is the food mediocre. We spent $100 for two of us with an appetizer and salad and two entrees, no booze. Not that this would be so terrible or even remarkable at a great NYC restaurant.But this is simply not one of them. The flavor profile of the pork was simply ""salt"" and that of the chicken was ""salt water."" The salmon croquettes were *okay* and the cabbage salad was forgettable. The service was pleasant and quick -- no complaints there. But as for the food: not good and perhaps even more damning: wildly overpriced.",1.0

"Everything about my brunch was divine! The restaurant was not that crowded for Sunday at 3pm (I expected it to be packed), and the location of Vinegar Hill House is on a charming street that has clearly started to catch people's attention, as there was a sign up on the street that the show The Americans will be filming there this week. The restaurant itself isn't huge, but has that typical Brooklyn flare and decor that we have all grown to love. We ordered the Eggs Benedict, Cheddar Grits and Poached Pear Sourdough Pancakes. Everything was so delicious, and we devoured our meal along with two bloody marys. Of everything we ordered, the bloody marys were prolly the only item that was average, nothing spectacular. I will definitely be back for the food though!",5.0
"WDD - We did damage at Vinegar Hill House last night.  Came here with 3 other guys and some big appetites.  For a Thursday night, it wasn't crowded at 9pm and we were able to sit right away.  We ordered some drinks which took a half hour to come after multiple apologies from the wait staff.  This was my only major complaint about the meal and they comp'd the dessert to make up for it.  No harm, no foul there.We ordered 4 different appetizers with the standouts being the House Bacon and the Chicken Liver Mousse.  We couldn't get enough of these and wish we ordered two orders of the bacon.  It's thick cut like in the steakhouses and not overdone like it can be there.  It was cooked perfectly and served over some sort of pickled celery root.  I could have eaten a whole serving myself so if you come with MEN, order two.  The chicken liver mousse was just as good, if not better.  Just like most trendy restaurants do these days, it was served in a jar with some toast and caramelized onions on the side.  The sweet onions paired wonderfully with the light, meaty liver and set a great tone for the meal.  All but one of us ordered the chop with the lone man ordering the chicken.  We were all very satisfied with our meals as evidenced by the silence that fell over the table when the entrees came out and the clean plates that was the aftermath.  The 3 chops were all cooked to a different temperature which was disappointing to see but it didn't stop us from going to town on them.  There was so much meat, almost too much, but I didn't hear anyone complaining about that.  For sides, we ordered the cornbread and mushrooms.  The mushrooms were good but the cornbread was OUT OF THIS WORLD.  By far, the best cornbread I've ever had and that's saying a lot.  It was served in a skillet and came out with a tablespoon of melting butter on top.  The kicker was the jalapeno honey.  It added another layer of sweetness to the already sweet cornbread.  Every one at the table couldn't get enough of it.  A great complement to the protein heavy dishes we ordered.Overall a great experience at VHH.  I can't believe it's taken me this long to get here but I certainly wont let it go that long again.  I will be back sooner than later.",4.0

"I came across Vinegar Hill House after escaping from the overcrowded NY Festival of Lights in DUMBO. It's about a 15 min walk from the waterfront.  Since this review is a long one here are the key points:- great food and cocktails (get the napa cabbage, corn bread, and brussel sprouts)- good service - rustic decor, perfect for the winter- cozy atmosphere (upstairs louder, downstairs quieter)Upon arriving, I was disappointed to learn that the wait was 45 mins. The place is small - some table and bar seating upstairs and a few more tables in the cellar.While waiting to be seated, my friend and I had cocktails at the bar.  I had the pins and needles and he had the headless horseman.  I would get the pins and needles again - bourbon, pineapple juice and rosemary is a good concoction.  I'd like to try some others as well.After about 30 mins, we were seated downstairs.  Yay!!  Patience is not my virtue. The environment downstairs is quieter and more intimate than upstairs.  Decor all around is rustic - lots of wood.  I love it for the winter!Having looked at the menu while waiting at the bar, we were all set to order.  We split the napa cabbage and brussel sprouts for appetizers, the country chop and artic char for entrees, and a bottle of wine to drink.  Everything was delicious. Most notable was the napa cabbage appetizer cooked in a creamy black tea yogurt sauce with cashews.  The dish doesn't sound like much on paper, but I highly recommend it.  The brussel sprouts with peanuts and maple ponzu were also really tasty.  The entrees were very good but nothing extraordinary - simple, honest, homey food.  We didn't order any, but as an FYI the pasta dishes didn't look like anything special so I'd recommended avoiding them here.The kitchen had forgotten our entrees.  We didn't complain since we were not in a rush, but to make amends they gave us a complimentary cornbread with honey butter. Amazing! If you come here, you must get it!  I want some now!Anyway, I left happily stuffed.",4.0
"I like to be left alone in restaurants, which is why I always sit in the far-corner seat of the far-corner table, so I can be left in peace with my foods and drinks. But, last night, that didn't stop our waitress from rudely reaching all the way over my friends' plates to shake my glasses and tip my plates. After the 14th (of course I counted! )time of her doing this, I asked her to please stop, because I find it invasive and disturbing, and also unsanitary. She was literally extending her entire head & neck & torso (hair, nose, mouth, armpits, elbows, hands, abdomen!) over our entire four-top table, picking up all of our glasses and shaking them to see if they were empty! She was, again, literally, tipping our plates on their sides to see if there was still any food left on them! How horrendous! How intrusive, how invasive, and how annoying is that! She had no concerns for our boundaries or space or privacy or conversations. Although I was initially the only one to complain, my friends all admitted to feeling a bit violated. It was my Birthday, and although I didn't expect it to be perfect, this was just unacceptable. In her defense, she said ""I'm sorry, I just can't see anything"" but that's really no excuse, because if SHE can't see anything, why should WE customers be made ill at ease?Additionally, our Pappardelle appetizer was slimy and disgusting. And the Cornbread side dish had a big piece of plastic in it. And the Arctic Char was overcooked. And the Steak Tartar was flavorless. And the Wild Mushrooms were bland. And the Brownie was really dry. So why 2 stars rather than 1? Because the cocktails were great (though expensive). Because the Red Wattle Chop (beautifully brined like ham-steak, beautifully medium-rare like I asked, beautifully charred, beautifully rendered fat) was absolutely incredible, as were the accompanying Adzuki Bean Puree & Shredded Sautéed Leeks. And because the Brussels Sprouts & Baby Carrots were some of the best vegetable side dishes I've had in a very long time. It's a very cute restaurant, tiny and intimate, located on a sublime side street, but there are LOTS of problems to fix.",2.0

Roasted chicken is bone dry, octopus appetizer is 2 tentacles, salad portion is a joke, expect to constantly ask for 'more bread' even if you order a dish which requires bread, double the times you'll have to ask if there's more than 2 ppl at your table. Brunch; service is horrible and the food isn't any better than a Diner food.Attitude and Service; as many times as I've been there, the waitstaff, GM, no one has ever greeted me with a friendly smile. If there's something wrong with the food, I'm told, ""it's how we do it here"" or an eyeroll, these guys should work at The Palm or Peter Luger's so they'll understand how to treat paying customers. Another time, I brought in a party of 10+ppl (all visiting from other countries) and our waiter kept rolling his eyes and trying to squeeze us in a corner, I heard him complain about it and laugh at us; but that seems to be the typical attitude here; I was so embarrassed for my colleagues, actually I was mortified. I will never take out-of -town guests here again. Flavor; it's hit or miss. Come w/ serious $$, appetizers are like h'orderves and main entrees are appetizer sizes, bread portions ridiculous.I live in Dumbo, and this place just isn't an option anymore... I don't think it's old-fashion of me to say, I want to feel like I'm an appreciated customer, that these guys welcome people with a smile or handshake, especially if it's a regular but nope; i get a blank stare and a couple of blinks.",1.0

Roasted chicken is bone dry, octopus appetizer is 2 tentacles, salad portion is a joke, expect to constantly ask for 'more bread' even if you order a dish which requires bread, double the times you'll have to ask if there's more than 2 ppl at your table. Brunch; service is horrible and the food isn't any better than a Diner food.Attitude and Service; as many times as I've been there, the waitstaff, GM, no one has ever greeted me with a friendly smile. If there's something wrong with the food, I'm told, ""it's how we do it here"" or an eyeroll, these guys should work at The Palm or Peter Luger's so they'll understand how to treat paying customers. Another time, I brought in a party of 10+ppl (all visiting from other countries) and our waiter kept rolling his eyes and trying to squeeze us in a corner, I heard him complain about it and laugh at us; but that seems to be the typical attitude here; I was so embarrassed for my colleagues, actually I was mortified. I will never take out-of -town guests here again. Flavor; it's hit or miss. Come w/ serious $$, appetizers are like h'orderves and main entrees are appetizer sizes, bread portions ridiculous.I live in Dumbo, and this place just isn't an option anymore... I don't think it's old-fashion of me to say, I want to feel like I'm an appreciated customer, that these guys welcome people with a smile or handshake, especially if it's a regular but nope; i get a blank stare and a couple of blinks.",1.0

"Went here for brunch.  Now I know going for Sunday brunch at a tiny restaurant in a brunch-obsessed, stroller-ridden place like Brooklyn is asking for punishment, but it was near the Navy Yard which is where I had to be later that day.  We got there, and hostess told us it would be a 25-30 min wait.  Cut to 40 min later, and we're still waiting.  In the meantime, I looked inside, and saw empty tables.  I know the restaurant has to manage its flow, and make sure the kitchen and waitstaff aren't overwhelmed, but the hostess should have given us a better explanation of what was going on.  We asked, and she didn't really have a good one.Sadly, the food was not worth the wait.  Pretty standard brunch fare and cramped seating.  Also, the wait staff basically ignored us for about 10 min after we sat after our 40 min wait outside.Vinegar Hill House is good, but the terrible front of the house and wait staff service put us in a crappy mood.  Had the food been better, our mood would have been better.If you're in the neighborhood, sure go ahead and try it.  But the place is not worth trekking out to or waiting for more than 20 min.",3.0

They had several goat dishes which we all found very interesting since none of us had ever eaten goat. We started with the goat crostini which was served on a wooden board with a mustard and a jam. My sister had beer since there were no vodka cocktails and I had the bourbon cocktail which was delicious. They even made a mocktail for my friend who is expecting. For our mains we were slightly boring and all got the cast iron chicken. I NEVER order chicken in a restaurant but this was delightful. We also got a side of the cornbread which had a lovely honey flavor and was served just like my mom makes it, in a cast iron skillet. For dessert we had a brownie with mint ice cream so it had a bit of a mint chocolate chip vibe. Overall the place was a hit and we will definitely go back!

"Came here last night with a vegetarian friend of mine--I guess I can thank Vinegar Hill for reminding me of the valuable lesson to always check the menu before going to a new place (they offer virtually no vegetarian options).

The only thing waitstaff seems to care less about than your dining experience is their manners.

"My partner and I recently returned to Vinegar Hill House for our anniversary dinner, two years after our ""first date"" dinner there. We're very sentimental about VHH for obvious reasons, so we were hopeful that we have as lovely a time as we did on the first visit.Thankfully, the restaurant is still as charming as we remembered. It has a rustic farmhouse feel to it, with a fully stocked bar on one side and a backyard garden in the back. We enjoyed our dinner outside and were attentively served by a friendly waitress who checked on us at periodic intervals throughout the evening. Mozzies and awkward wooden picnic chairs aside, it was a peaceful environment to enjoy our food.We opted to start with the chicken liver mousse, which was served on a wooden board with a mason jar of the mousse, accompanied with caramelized onions, frisee, and thickly cut rustic bread grilled with olive oil. Our waitress was kind enough to request additional toast on our behalf, knowing we were sharing the app.As for entrees, my partner had the country pork chop with tender fingerling potatoes, which was heaven. My arctic char was perfectly cooked and flaky, and I loved the fennel yogurt that was drizzled on the side. Both mains were excellent and I appreciated the presentation put into each dish.All in all, with the two drinks we had with our meal, we escaped without putting too much damage on the wallet.

"We went there for dinner on a Sunday. I was impressed with the cooking. Together we had ordered 3 appetizers, 3 main courses and 1 dessert.

Suggestions I have are 1) use appropriate wine glasses.  2) Train the waitstaff to be less disturbing and more professional. Our waiter literally decided to pour us water when we had a bottle on our table each 15 minutes after we were done with our meal and were finishing our drinks and chatting. We were his last table, so there was not a point in rushing us, really. Otherwise, I loved the cooking and would recommend this restaurant.",4.0

"The service at this place is an absolute abomination. Run by apathetic hipsters who begrudgingly offer service pretty much only when asked, the wait staff hangs out by the bar socializing rather than tending to their tables. We came here on a Saturday morning for brunch and it was fairly busy but you couldn't tell by watching the waitstaff. The hostess was actually more helpful than our male server for some reason. Our food came after the people who arrived after us and as noted by other reviewers, the  portions were small. But that part was fine. The menu was uninspired, the food over-salted and over-priced. My boyfriend ordered Eggs Benedict and the egg whites weren't even fully cooked. Our decaf coffee took a long time to arrive and when it did, it had grounds floating in it.The place is hip, earthy, and has an old thyme aesthetic and the bathroom has a fun old feel to it. Were it not for the horrible service and mediocre food, I would have enjoyed the space.In closing, this was the worst service I've received in NYC. I work in retail so I know how easy it is to act nice to customers - after all, it's a primary part of the job description. Here they are failing that part miserably; My experience would have been more acceptable if the waitstaff at least flaked off with a smile, but the attitude was downright unfriendly and entitled. I'll never go back.",1.0

"Bwahahahahahaaaaa... 5 stars to counter the complaints about service. It's a solid 4 star place based on my night there- maybe I got lucky service wise.So many reviews about the pork chop and bitching about fat...Let me clue you into something...Pork IS about FAT.Now, here's the story... I had dialed it up to 900 watts and rode 50 miles the day I went to Vinegar Hill House.I had gotten home from my ride, relaxed a bit, hydrated, etcetera, etcetera...That's when the FAMISH set in. A light-bulb fizzle-flashed in my brain and the overwhelming URGE to eat a SLAB OF MEAT burned through my cerebrum.Pork. Pork Chop...to be exact.So, I went feverishly reading about to find a pork chop in Brooklyn, 'cause I was dropping off my daughter in the area for a party, and up popped Vinegar Hill House.I drive to the joint with the lady in tow after dropping off my girly, we were immediately taken in by the décor...soft, warm, cozy, nice ambiance. Beautiful copper top bar. We were seated right away by a pleasantly charming and easy on the eyes hostess. Not much later our laid back, yet attentive, waiter showed up and went through the basics- water, vino selection.We started with a Georgian bottle of red called ""Pheasant's Tears,"" which proved to be the ideal match throughout the meal. Tannic, juicy, fruity, and funky with earth. lmao. I never had a Georgian wine so it was kind of a must do.For appetizers we started with the Arugula salad and the Roasted Octopus. Great salad, dressed to perfection, nothing overwhelmed anything, a lovely parmesan, some nuts whose pedigree I do not recall, etc..The octopus was excellent, perfectly roasted, nice and crusted on the edges and not a bit of game, perfectly tender. Octopus is a bit of an obsession for me, when it's done right it's incredible, otherwise I frikkin' hate it...nothing worse than when it's chewy and fishy like so many places do it. It's the violin of cephalopods. Anyhow, killah 'pus...My only complaint... NOT ENOUGH OF IT!!! Three wee bits of tentacle. Throw 8 on the plate...OCTO...not a TRIPLEPUS...Anyhow... for the main courses I already knew what I wanted, the SO went for the Bone Marrow and Saffron Risotto...Off the hook good, you can't go wrong with sautéed marrow, saffron is just rocking, and they must of snuck a killer smoked gouda or some Cypress Grove Midnight Moon cheese in there...it had this great nutty-sweet crunchy quality and it was dusted with parmesan on top as well. The rice...Perfect. Not a split grain, I make a mean risotto and I know restaurants have to take shortcuts and split grains is the usual result...it completely screws up the mouth feel. I'd like to know their method for curiosity's sake; well done.Now....The Pork Chop. The ""Red Wattle Country Chop.""That pig was sublime... it told me a story with every chew, ""I ate these nuts & fruits, I rolled in this grass, took a loverly mud-bath then CRACK!!!! I'm on your plate...""The pork was sweet, juicy, full of depth, a perfectly micro-thin crust on the outside, I loved the grits- just enough cheesiness without overwhelming the pork and a wee bit o'kick from the jalapeno. Nicely sliced and presented thusly; I wish they had plated it with the entire bone, I like to gnaw on them at the end, sates the carnivore I am.We finished off with a cheese, fruit, and homemade cracker selection. The cheese was a French triple cream of forgotten origin.Anyhow, in short, I found the service to be welcoming and attentive, and the food was well executed. The octopus appetizer could have been a little larger, especially when you consider the price but, other than that....a thoroughly enjoyed meal.I'll be back.",5.0

"That was a bummer.  A double whami, just tonight:We had ordered an $85 ""special"" lamb for two:  lamb neck or shank.And We got the strong eye-browed hipster waiter, again.  I thought to ask that we not be put at his tables, again.  But thought surely the place is quiet tonight, we won't end up on his side of the room...sure enough, we did end up there.So we got the waiter that does not serve, and sure enough, he didn't ask, but brought us out the neck.   For $85.  Which was slightly dry and so I asked for more jus and yogurt sauce.  He finally, asked how we were and I commented that he did not ask shank or neck, but just brought what the kitchen had.  And that it was dry.  For $85.  He gave us $10 worth of dessert ""on the house.""It was far, far from $85 worth of braised lamb.  Sad to see the love leave a beloved spot. ;(",2.0
"This restaurant has been on our ""must try"" list for years and we finally go to go last night. All I can say is that I'm disappointed we waited so long.. This was start to finish one of the top meals I have ever had. Ever. Chicken liver mousse, all day long. Beef brisket was super tender and flavorful. I don't even typically like beets and the beets side was super delicious. The pasta tagatelle was fresh and wonderful. Dreaming of when we'll return..",5.0
"Prepare to leave hungry. Food taste amazing but after your third bite you say "" where did it go "". ( small portions). The outside section is pretty meh. Its one of those places that says you pay alot so it has to be small so we look fancy.  Nice hidden place in DUMBO , I just wish i was full 3 courses later.",2.0
"We went there for dinner on a Sunday. I was impressed with the cooking. Together we had ordered 3 appetizers, 3 main courses and 1 dessert. I truly enjoyed the Chicken Liver Mousse, Mushroom with eggs, Pappardelle and Pork Ribs. I am not a pork person, because I don't like the ""pork meat smell/taste"" However, theirs was really good. Suggestions I have are 1) use appropriate wine glasses.  2) Train the waitstaff to be less disturbing and more professional. Our waiter literally decided to pour us water when we had a bottle on our table each 15 minutes after we were done with our meal and were finishing our drinks and chatting. We were his last table, so there was not a point in rushing us, really. Otherwise, I loved the cooking and would recommend this restaurant.",4.0
"Hate to do this because the place is so damn cute and the service is on point, but the food at Vinegar Hill is a C- at best. My pork chop was cold, underdone, and not flavorful. My date's fish was meh~. The desserts tasted like cardboard. I want this place to have top notch food ... it *should have top notch food, but alas, it's far from.",3.0
"The service at this place is an absolute abomination. Run by apathetic hipsters who begrudgingly offer service pretty much only when asked, the wait staff hangs out by the bar socializing rather than tending to their tables. We came here on a Saturday morning for brunch and it was fairly busy but you couldn't tell by watching the waitstaff. The hostess was actually more helpful than our male server for some reason. Our food came after the people who arrived after us and as noted by other reviewers, the  portions were small. But that part was fine. The menu was uninspired, the food over-salted and over-priced. My boyfriend ordered Eggs Benedict and the egg whites weren't even fully cooked. Our decaf coffee took a long time to arrive and when it did, it had grounds floating in it.The place is hip, earthy, and has an old thyme aesthetic and the bathroom has a fun old feel to it. Were it not for the horrible service and mediocre food, I would have enjoyed the space.In closing, this was the worst service I've received in NYC. I work in retail so I know how easy it is to act nice to customers - after all, it's a primary part of the job description. Here they are failing that part miserably; My experience would have been more acceptable if the waitstaff at least flaked off with a smile, but the attitude was downright unfriendly and entitled. I'll never go back.",1.0
Stopped in for the first time recently and had one of the better meals we have had in a while. Past up our reservation for a spot at the bar (preferred seating for us) and had good time chatting with the bartender. Can't wait to go back and sample the rest of the menu.,5.0
"Bwahahahahahaaaaa... 5 stars to counter the complaints about service. It's a solid 4 star place based on my night there- maybe I got lucky service wise.So many reviews about the pork chop and bitching about fat...Let me clue you into something...Pork IS about FAT.Now, here's the story... I had dialed it up to 900 watts and rode 50 miles the day I went to Vinegar Hill House.I had gotten home from my ride, relaxed a bit, hydrated, etcetera, etcetera...That's when the FAMISH set in. A light-bulb fizzle-flashed in my brain and the overwhelming URGE to eat a SLAB OF MEAT burned through my cerebrum.Pork. Pork Chop...to be exact.So, I went feverishly reading about to find a pork chop in Brooklyn, 'cause I was dropping off my daughter in the area for a party, and up popped Vinegar Hill House.I drive to the joint with the lady in tow after dropping off my girly, we were immediately taken in by the décor...soft, warm, cozy, nice ambiance. Beautiful copper top bar. We were seated right away by a pleasantly charming and easy on the eyes hostess. Not much later our laid back, yet attentive, waiter showed up and went through the basics- water, vino selection.We started with a Georgian bottle of red called ""Pheasant's Tears,"" which proved to be the ideal match throughout the meal. Tannic, juicy, fruity, and funky with earth. lmao. I never had a Georgian wine so it was kind of a must do.For appetizers we started with the Arugula salad and the Roasted Octopus. Great salad, dressed to perfection, nothing overwhelmed anything, a lovely parmesan, some nuts whose pedigree I do not recall, etc..The octopus was excellent, perfectly roasted, nice and crusted on the edges and not a bit of game, perfectly tender. Octopus is a bit of an obsession for me, when it's done right it's incredible, otherwise I frikkin' hate it...nothing worse than when it's chewy and fishy like so many places do it. It's the violin of cephalopods. Anyhow, killah 'pus...My only complaint... NOT ENOUGH OF IT!!! Three wee bits of tentacle. Throw 8 on the plate...OCTO...not a TRIPLEPUS...Anyhow... for the main courses I already knew what I wanted, the SO went for the Bone Marrow and Saffron Risotto...Off the hook good, you can't go wrong with sautéed marrow, saffron is just rocking, and they must of snuck a killer smoked gouda or some Cypress Grove Midnight Moon cheese in there...it had this great nutty-sweet crunchy quality and it was dusted with parmesan on top as well. The rice...Perfect. Not a split grain, I make a mean risotto and I know restaurants have to take shortcuts and split grains is the usual result...it completely screws up the mouth feel. I'd like to know their method for curiosity's sake; well done.Now....The Pork Chop. The ""Red Wattle Country Chop.""That pig was sublime... it told me a story with every chew, ""I ate these nuts & fruits, I rolled in this grass, took a loverly mud-bath then CRACK!!!! I'm on your plate...""The pork was sweet, juicy, full of depth, a perfectly micro-thin crust on the outside, I loved the grits- just enough cheesiness without overwhelming the pork and a wee bit o'kick from the jalapeno. Nicely sliced and presented thusly; I wish they had plated it with the entire bone, I like to gnaw on them at the end, sates the carnivore I am.We finished off with a cheese, fruit, and homemade cracker selection. The cheese was a French triple cream of forgotten origin.Anyhow, in short, I found the service to be welcoming and attentive, and the food was well executed. The octopus appetizer could have been a little larger, especially when you consider the price but, other than that....a thoroughly enjoyed meal.I'll be back.",5.0

"Ok, to start--reviews that give 1 and 2 star reviews for mess-ups in their reservations, service that isn't actually the worst ever or high prices (when the prices have been clearly publicized beforehand) are remarkably unhelpful. This was why I was approaching this restaurant with very very moderate expectations.My date was able to get a 9pm reservation on Saturday night for my birthday, though they were able to seat us at 8:30pm and didn't give us a huge hassle. The kitchen seemed a bit overwhelmed, but most issues seemed to disappear soon after we were seated. In the meantime, we started with cocktails at their bar (and the tab was easily transferred to our table). My date had a rye-based cocktail, while I had one of the bourbon cocktails. Both were delicious and a great way to whet our appetites. The dinner menu is fairly simple (and probably all delicious), so my date and I settled on the charred beets for an appetizer with saffron yogurt. Oh my goodness, these beets were amazing--incredibly flavorful and tender, yet with a decent char formed on the outside (possibly from boiling then grilling in their wood oven?). The saffron yogurt sauce was delighfully tangy and mixed well with the sweetness of the beets and the other pesto-type sauce drizzled in.For the main course, I ordered the skillet chicken with shallots and my boyfriend ordered the pork chop with farro. Since the chicken was a la carte, we also ordered a side of the brussels sprouts with maple and pickled chilis (which narrowly beat out the parsnip choice). The chicken was incredibly flavorful, buttery and tender, with crisped skin, and the roasted shallots paired very well. The pork chop...oh my God, my mouth is watering just thinking about it! The pork cop was perfectly tender and juicy and was full of flavor. Seriously, I couldn't stop stealing pieces from my boyfriend's plate (it was my birthday!). The Brussels sprouts were also amazing...a really nice balance of savory from the roasted Brussels, sweetness from the maple syrup and spicy from the pickled chilis. I'm not sure what other people are referring to about the portions...my boyfriend and I could not make room for dessert and left very sated.

"The pear pancake seems to be used with a doughnut dough and makes it so yummy you just want to keep eating.  The potato enchilada was fantastic and the verde sauce used on it makes the dish perfect - balancing the tangy of the sauce with the savory aspects of the potato and cheese.  Oh, and definitely get a side order of potatoes!!!!  Those things are amazing just on their own!",5.0
"The Good.-Sitting at the bar. It's just better. Especially here, because of...-The bartender. He knows his menu, his winelist, and his cocktails.-The way the fish entree tasted.

I passed the glass to my dining companion and said, ""Maybe it's corked?"" The waiter chimed in with: ""It's not corked!"" though he didn't try it and he proceeded to pour. Well, the vote was unanimous. The wine was just wrong. It tasted bad. $47 for a bad French red? Nope.

If there are no substitutions, it should be on the menu (and I do not recall having seen any such notation on the menu).* OK, but that $9 for was 8 or 9 very meager spears of asparagus. Very unsatisfying.* The chop was incredibly FATTY - not the best cut of meat. :( I choked mine down. My dining companion called for a doggy bag and said his Italian Greyhound could eat it instead.

"A very serious food friend recommended Vinegar Hill and off we went on a lovely summer Saturday evening. No reservations they said on the phone; at 8 PM, we did get a table right away on the peculiar outdoor patio boxed between the restaurant building and a back house that was used for restaurant storage. Several scraggly trees reached for the sky. Funky. The outside chairs are seriously uncomfortable slats.The food was excellent with a blend of fascinating flavors, such as watermelon paired with a small slab of brisket, and a delightful delicately cooked blend of unusual mushrooms.Would I return? No, because the staff did less than nothing to be warm and gracious and the portions were overall very tiny. The dishes are certainly overpriced; you will leave hungry. Literally three thumb-nail slivers of duck and at most 14 inches of pappardelle for a main dish. The chef can be mean, I guess.If you are not concerned about the value, it is an interesting and tasty experience. Finding the location is a bit of a challenge, but doable.",3.0
"As soon as I walked through the doors of this little Brooklyn gem, I knew the food was gonna be good. I literally felt like I entered an old school traditional cottage, wooden tables, handmade decor, a fire pit oven - charming and different than your typical NYC space. This place was packed to the brim on a Sunday, but that's the typical BK brunch scene for you.We started off with the poutine tater tots appetizer (which was a special for that day) and omg... I could have licked the plate clean but I didn't want to embarrass my friend. LOL!  For our entrees, I ordered the Dorado Tacos which were spicy, filling and fresh and my friend ordered the eggs benedict which was absolutely delicious. Perfect hollandaise sauce- very impressive! He was originally raving about the shrimp and grits but by the time he attempted to order it, they were all sold out for day. He looked absolutely miserable when they told him the sad news so they must be amazing - he highly, highly recommends this dish for anyone that's in to it or even a little curious.I had a round of two tiny mixed cocktails that packed a serious punch- I can't remember the name but they left me seriously tipsy. Very well made and refreshing.It was the perfect Brooklyn brunch spot- great food, charming and knowledgeable servers, and the ambiance was unmatched. LOVED IT!",5.0

"This menu is of the sort you scan and know that every last item will be delicious. Everyone around us was getting the potted chicken, but the two specials of the evening sounded too good for me to pass up: duck liver pate for an app., and lamb with various gradations of nutty pulses alongside it for a main. My friend and I started with bass croquettes and she got the pastrami plate for a main. Just as I had foreseen, each bite was full of distinct, rich flavors. The croquettes' aioli sauce was particularly phenomenal; the duck liver pate was oh-la-la good. And I have never tasted such tender, succulent lamb.The waitress was superlative: she anticipated our needing more toasted bread for the pate, and brought it even as we were starting to wish for it. She also recommended, on my request for a ""spicy cocktail,"" the Vinegar Hill, which hit the spot so well that I ended up ordering three of them.The ambience is perfect here: no loud music, constant influx and outflux of patrons so that it's never either empty or packed to the gills, and always interesting people dynamics going on around one.The desserts are very light and refreshing, as befits the end of June. I had the goat cheese panna cotta (which had nice touches of basil, tomato, and gelatin cubes that somehow all went well together), and my friend had the pistachio ice cream. Yum!",5.0

"Celebrated my birthday here! Excellent meal, start to finish.The cocktail menu was classic but creative. I had the Carousel, which was a take on a negroni but with Aperol instead of Campari and some champagne vinegar (first time I've had vinegar in a cocktail!) and a sprig of time. Really well-balanced, herbal, delicious drink.We ordered a couple of app specials -- bass croquettes, house bacon with pickled rhubard and macadamia nuts -- and the chicken liver mouse. All were really delicious. The house bacon with particularly nice and I love that they used rhubarb as it is in season and was a surprising combination with the bacon.The main courses were similarly great. We ordered three entrees and two pastas and the range of flavors, techniques and cooking influences was really impressive. The cast iron chicken was everything you want chicken to be -- crispy skin, delicious oniony pan sauce. The arctic char was a standout -- perfectly pan-seared and finished with what I can only describe as a Scandinavian flavor profile and presentation (dill, some sort of berry, and some sort of tangy creme). The brisket was tender and tasty. The pastas were interesting and yummy. We particularly liked the lamb free-form pasta. It had a really interesting combination of flavors... tarragon and orange zest (I think).The wine list was diverse and well priced and our server was quite knowledgable. The majority of bottles were in the $40-60 range. We had an excellent Sicilian wine for $48 that was earthy, rustic, kind of funky and paired very well with the food (our server informed us the wine was heavily affected by its terroir, growing in the volcanic soil of Mt. Etna).This place is a real treat!",5.0
"Almost unbelievable how delicious this food is and how they elevate each ingredient to create their dishes. We highly recommend ordering the Napa cabbage salad and the chicken liver.

"A very serious food friend recommended Vinegar Hill and off we went on a lovely summer Saturday evening. No reservations they said on the phone; at 8 PM, we did get a table right away on the peculiar outdoor patio boxed between the restaurant building and a back house that was used for restaurant storage. Several scraggly trees reached for the sky. Funky. The outside chairs are seriously uncomfortable slats.The food was excellent with a blend of fascinating flavors, such as watermelon paired with a small slab of brisket, and a delightful delicately cooked blend of unusual mushrooms.Would I return? No, because the staff did less than nothing to be warm and gracious and the portions were overall very tiny. The dishes are certainly overpriced; you will leave hungry. Literally three thumb-nail slivers of duck and at most 14 inches of pappardelle for a main dish. The chef can be mean, I guess.If you are not concerned about the value, it is an interesting and tasty experience. Finding the location is a bit of a challenge, but doable.",3.0
"As soon as I walked through the doors of this little Brooklyn gem, I knew the food was gonna be good. I literally felt like I entered an old school traditional cottage, wooden tables, handmade decor, a fire pit oven - charming and different than your typical NYC space. This place was packed to the brim on a Sunday, but that's the typical BK brunch scene for you.We started off with the poutine tater tots appetizer (which was a special for that day) and omg... I could have licked the plate clean but I didn't want to embarrass my friend. LOL!  For our entrees, I ordered the Dorado Tacos which were spicy, filling and fresh and my friend ordered the eggs benedict which was absolutely delicious. Perfect hollandaise sauce- very impressive! He was originally raving about the shrimp and grits but by the time he attempted to order it, they were all sold out for day. He looked absolutely miserable when they told him the sad news so they must be amazing - he highly, highly recommends this dish for anyone that's in to it or even a little curious.I had a round of two tiny mixed cocktails that packed a serious punch- I can't remember the name but they left me seriously tipsy. Very well made and refreshing.It was the perfect Brooklyn brunch spot- great food, charming and knowledgeable servers, and the ambiance was unmatched. LOVED IT!",5.0
Delicious. Lovely brunch. Great service and well done food.,4.0
"This menu is of the sort you scan and know that every last item will be delicious. Everyone around us was getting the potted chicken, but the two specials of the evening sounded too good for me to pass up: duck liver pate for an app., and lamb with various gradations of nutty pulses alongside it for a main. My friend and I started with bass croquettes and she got the pastrami plate for a main. Just as I had foreseen, each bite was full of distinct, rich flavors. The croquettes' aioli sauce was particularly phenomenal; the duck liver pate was oh-la-la good. And I have never tasted such tender, succulent lamb.The waitress was superlative: she anticipated our needing more toasted bread for the pate, and brought it even as we were starting to wish for it. She also recommended, on my request for a ""spicy cocktail,"" the Vinegar Hill, which hit the spot so well that I ended up ordering three of them.The ambience is perfect here: no loud music, constant influx and outflux of patrons so that it's never either empty or packed to the gills, and always interesting people dynamics going on around one.The desserts are very light and refreshing, as befits the end of June. I had the goat cheese panna cotta (which had nice touches of basil, tomato, and gelatin cubes that somehow all went well together), and my friend had the pistachio ice cream. Yum!",5.0

"I wanted so badly to love this place, but unfortunately, that was not the case. I loved the atmosphere, I loved our waitress and I loved our wine, the food however, I did not love. Upon first glance at the menu, I was more than excited to try a bit of everything - an app, a pasta, a main and a side. My excitement only grew as each dish was brought to our table - such beautiful presentations all around! However, as the meal progressed, my excitement continuously faded as we moved through each course. The salad we decided to split consisted of a goat cheese smear and dressing - basic, yes, but left me feeling excited  for the meal ahead. Next course was the Pappardelle. Way too salty and tasted a bit fishy (unclear as to whether there was a fish base, regardless...no thank you). We did not finish the pasta, and when pasta is in front of me, an unfinished plate is a rarity. Next was the main - I opted for the Cast Iron Chicken with an au jus sauce, while my date went with the pork chop which came with a side of farro. I would have to say the chop was better but only due to the farro - the farro was pretty amazing (relatively speaking, of course). As for a side, we shared the wild mushrooms, which were coated in seasoning, leaving no mushroom flavor to taste. Next. After feeling a bit unsatisfied from our meal, we decided to share a cheese plate as a pseudo dessert. While the cheese was not terrible, it was not good either, and I am NEVER picky with cheese.

I was most impressed with the Spring Lettuce salad.Undecided if I will eat there again, but I would definitely go back to enjoy a few drinks, or a salad.",3.0

"I've been wanting to try this place out for a verrry looong time, and after a lovely Etsy craft event, my friend and I decided to treat ourselves and pig out gracefully. My friend had the short ribs and I ordered the cast iron chicken. This chicken has been blogged and gotten raves from many reviewers so I thought ""Why not get it and see how amaze-balls it is!!""Oh boy, was it juicy... and RAW! Majority of chicken was still bright pink, and I was able to see the bright red veins within the uncooked meat. The steak knife I was given couldn't even cut through the white cartilage of the meat because it was extremely undercooked. I had told our server, Max,  that it was under cooked, and showed him the meat in question. He proceeded to dismiss my claim, unapologetically stating ""This is how the chef prefers to serve this dish."" Thanks Max but really, 1) raw chicken isn't as much of a delicacy as steak tartare in this part of the world and 2) there's a little bug called Salmonella that many people avoid if you cook chicken thoroughly! I mean c'mon, it's cast iron chicken-- I think the name denotes it's supposed to be cooked. The haughtiness of the waiter's reaction and attitude has made me really rethink revisiting this establishment. It's a shame as I'd really love to give it another chance!",1.0

"Unfortunately, I only made my way down here for an interview, so I can't comment on the food. However, I can comment on the individuals whom I assume to be the owners, Jade and Jean Adamson. They were super rude and dismissive, as if I inconvenienced them in some way. I would actually have considered coming here, because of the location and great neighborhood but definitely wouldn't after this. As soon as I got there, I received a very cold reception and they just weren't friendly. I don't know about anyone else but I wouldn't want to work or eat in an establishment that is rude to their staff or potential staff.

"I've been wanting to try this place out for a verrry looong time, and after a lovely Etsy craft event, my friend and I decided to treat ourselves and pig out gracefully. My friend had the short ribs and I ordered the cast iron chicken. This chicken has been blogged and gotten raves from many reviewers so I thought ""Why not get it and see how amaze-balls it is!!""Oh boy, was it juicy... and RAW! Majority of chicken was still bright pink, and I was able to see the bright red veins within the uncooked meat. The steak knife I was given couldn't even cut through the white cartilage of the meat because it was extremely undercooked. I had told our server, Max,  that it was under cooked, and showed him the meat in question. He proceeded to dismiss my claim, unapologetically stating ""This is how the chef prefers to serve this dish."" Thanks Max but really, 1) raw chicken isn't as much of a delicacy as steak tartare in this part of the world and 2) there's a little bug called Salmonella that many people avoid if you cook chicken thoroughly! I mean c'mon, it's cast iron chicken-- I think the name denotes it's supposed to be cooked. The haughtiness of the waiter's reaction and attitude has made me really rethink revisiting this establishment. It's a shame as I'd really love to give it another chance!",1.0
Great food! Wattle with the grits are a must have. The ambiance is warm and inviting.  The staff was also super friendly. We were there late so we were able to chat and hangout and not pressured to leave.  They even let me charge my phone!  I recommend this spot for anyone visiting the city.  The outdoor space is top notch.,5.0

I can't remember the last time that I've gone to a restaurant and felt so uncomfortable because of the staff.When our party (of two) arrived at the restaurant, the house was bumpin' - shit was LOUD. Fine. We were looking for a good time! The host told us that it would be a 30-45 minute, but we could sit at the bar in the mean time. Okay. Whatever! We stood awkwardly behind some people sitting at the bar, and already I felt uneasy - in the way and out of place. After a few minutes we were able to sit at the bar and very quickly I knew my instincts were right. The bartender seemed unable to restrain snarky comments every time another employee came near him. He even made several remarks insulting some poor patrons' drink selections (again - I get that working as a server sucks, but can't they be saccharine and accommodating until they're out of earshot of customers? It'll make things more pleasant for everyone!). It's kind of a buzz kill to have to listen to the waitstaff making fun of guests while trying to enjoy the restaurant experience.Anyway, that wasn't the worst part. We sat down and our waiter informed us of the day's specials. The English pea ravioli sounded pretty good, so we asked him how much it cost. He went on theatrically about how it was $13 and he couldn't believe how cheap it was, and it was such a good deal and blah blah blah. So we both got the ravioli, stupidly assuming it was an entree.No. Our food arrived in what we at first thought were giant, white, empty bowls. Upon closer inspection we saw that each serving consisted of about 5 medium-small raviolis. To be fair - they were very tasty! But I'm not sure they were $13 worth of tastiness. Oh, how stupid we were!Our waiter seemed to ignore us in a weird, passive-aggressive way after we said we weren't interested in dessert. Even though he kept coming to talk to the table beside us, he seemed to purposely walk away without even looking at us. Finally when he came by with the check, we were dumbfounded. After the whole spiel about the amazingly cheap $13 raviolis, HE CHARGED US $15 FOR EACH.Not wanting to squabble over $4 and wanting to GTFO, we just paid and made a bee line for the exit.

Boys, don't go off makin' that dirty, this was a beautiful experience.  We both were itchin' for some eggy goodness, so we both ordered the asparagus omelet.  I never expect too much from such a staple, and I'm glad. Low expectations means they were able to over deliver.  I don't know of they mixed the brie in the eggs before it hit the pan, but they were fluffy and cheesy all at the same time.  Service: super, ambiance: adorable, and price: perfect. Vinegar Hill House, move closer to me and give me a bigger coffee cup (those small ones are cute, but it's like a shot glass) and you'll be sittin' pretty with 5 stars.",4.0
"Located on a delightful little street that I am a quasi-resident of, VHH is a cute little spot decorated with a mish-mash of vintagey stoop-saley stuff.  The barstools are precarious at best.  My lemon mint bourbon drink was sublime, but only one can be imbibed on a school (so we moved onto the bottle of Gavi.  Note to my readers: I always get a bottle so I can't complain about stingy pours).  Farm/Fresh/Seasonal/Local is sooooo 00's.  I'm not knocking the meme, but you can't just serve some local shit on a plate and not ""do"" anything to it.  My chicken was fabulous (a butter/sherry sauce simply can't suck) but I didn't think is was special other than it was buttery sherry goodness.  The beets and avocado was just wierd--the 2 tastes don't go together (but separately are HEAVEN).So it was good, but I was not impressed.",3.0
"One of my favorite restaurants in Brooklyn. Still. I have eaten there multiple times: with friends, with my husband, with parents, even with kids. Not very kid friendly (no high chairs), but excellent for all other purposes, meals and diners.The pork chop is phenomenal, the guinness chocolate cake is excellent. Nice wine list. Great cocktails. Octopus appetizer changed my opinion of octopus salad. Go early or be ready to wait.  If you haven't been, go.",4.0
"Vinegar Hill House has it all: almost obnoxiously quaint decor, a cozy dining room, an open kitchen, and a menu so chock full of delicious-sounding dishes your heart twists trying to choose one over another.So you order, and you sit there and stare at your bare wooden table.A tiny bowl of braised squid arrives doused in paprika, ""black truffle"" shavings on an unapproachable heap of frisee evaporate flavorlessly in your mouth. Poorly-prepared pasta sits limp at the bottom of a giant bowl, and after a brief period of noodle eye contact you look up and the dining room has transformed into a large operating room. A bright fluorescent blue-white light shines overhead, and ice-metal robots (wearing plaid) pivot towards your back pocket, expand their ice-metal fingers and remove your money.You stand up and head for the door, the robots' eyeballs flash brighter and say ""thank you, good night,"" and as you step out in the street, the cold air hits you, and for the first time in a few hours, you feel warmth.",2.0
"Get ready for a long wait, but worth it! For appetizers, we had chicken liver mousse, oven roasted octopus (perfection!), and corn salad. For main: pork chops, braised short ribs, and cast iron roasted chicken. Dessert: Guinness chocolate cake, and salty caramel. A bottle of 2008 Chinon. All were delicious, and the consistency of each dish were perfect. Nothing was over/under done. Great value, too on top of that. Definitely a repeat.",4.0
The watermelon crab salad was to die for and everything was so rich and uniquely flavorful. Small plates work well because there are too many decadent choices in the menu to choose from. Great wine list and very warm decor. I'll be back!,5.0
Did someone up and transplant San Francisco into this place?Upon walking in the whole placed looked like an Anthropologie catalogue and was infested with hipsters. I met a friend there and we ordered the pancake and duck egg. The pancake was alright for nicely portioned for a brunch serving but the duck egg came out like a bibimbap (essentially a bunch of ingredients thrown into a bowl) - urgh - waste of $12.The place also had a fly problem. Gross. I suppose it's worth giving another shot just because of the ambiance. But it's nothing that I would go and rave about to others.,3.0
"The atmosphere here is great, and it starts from down the street.  I drove over from Jersey City just as it was getting back...rolled down that narrow two way cobble stone street and found parking right outside.The place was glowing inside and you could smell all the goodness as soon as you opened the car door.  We grabbed two seats right at the end of the bar and settled in for some work.To start, a Kale Pesto pasta with a heavy citrus flavor. In a word AMAZING.Went with the Braised Short Rib as the main....they didn't even need to bring a knife for it.  The flavors were fantastic.When asked about the dessert menu, we said no no....just put in another order of pasta...the braised lamb ragu this time.  What a way to finish it off.This is my new favorite restaurant.",5.0
This smallish restaurant located on the outskirts of Dumbo was worth the trek on a rainy night from Manhattan.  Service was great and the restaurant was lively and cozy.  We tried all of the appetizers and non disappointed.  I had the special Soft Shell sandwich which I've been craving since it has become the season for eating them.  This sandwich was perfection.,4.0
"So disappointed. Came here with high expectations and left with an empty tummy (small portions) and a puckered mouth (far too salty). Walked into a relatively empty restaurant around 6.30 on Friday night to be sat downstairs without a soul. When I asked if all the tables upstairs were reserved, the host replied with ""kind of."" I've no idea what that means, but when we left all those tables were still empty. And I think being downstairs was partly why we were somewhat ignored. I came here with a vegetarian guest, who had read on their website that despite the limited vegetarian choices, the chef would adapt dishes to suit. When we asked the server this, she replied with a grimace and said she'd strongly discourage that on a Friday night as he wouldn't be happy with said adaptation. Why you would go out of your way to add this to your website if this isn't the case I don't know. So we order off the menu, 2 entrees and 1 side. We've already told our server that we have a show to be at and so are tight on time. 45 mins later we're still waiting for our food. When we ask, and state again that we have a show, she goes away and comes back 5 mins later to tell us it's being plated. 5 mins after that we finally get our food and the check. At this point we should already leaving for the show so we have have to rush, meaning I don't get to finish what's already a small portion. We get an apology and a drink knocked off the bill, but for $65 I was hoping to leave at least full - and not gasping for water from the over-salty chicken. And like I say, walking past those still empty tables on the way out was somewhat frustrating. This place is not in a convenient location, so you do have to go out of your way to eat here. And it's pricey. I wouldn't waste your time. Additional point to make, it has a B grade, if you follow that kind of stuff.",2.0
To sum it up in a word: meh. I went on a date here (the date went amazingly -- great ambiance!) but the food was not too memorable. I got the trout and he got the chicken.

Our waitress might have been new to the job because she clearly made a few mistakes.  After taking our orders, service went downhill...she served the people sitting next to us our meals then embarrassed quickly brought them to us and then proceeded to mix up who ordered what.  Then, she did this really weird thing were she was about to fill up my friend's glass of water but then stopped and ran back to the kitchen and never came back.  Kind of like a fake pour.  Strange but we laughed it off.Anyway, food was delicious and I thought the portions were pretty good for brunch.  I had the crab special served with eggs hollandaise.  It was so good.  I am definitely going back.",4.0
"The wait is insane.  We're there on a freezing Monday MLK day evening at 7pm and it was still a solid 1 hour wait for a party of 2.  Is it worth the wait?  Well, I guess only if it's for not more than 1 hour.  In addition to the ground level dining area, there's another small dining room with a working fireplace that's hidden in the basement.  I think the main dining area on the ground floor has a better atmosphere.The food was generally delicious.  That said, do note that your meal does not come with a complimentary bread basket.  In fact, on their 'special' for the night is bread with a 'special' olive oil that they charge for I want to say $8?   Which I think is a bit of a rip off.  We shared the pasta with octopus as an appetizer and the sauce it came with had a stickiness that only comes from rich, well-made jus.  For our entrees, we tried the 2 dishes most yelpers seem to rave about - the red wattle country (pork) chop and the cast iron chicken.  Both were outstanding in flavor and simplicity.Dessert was a let-down.  We went with the date tart and mascarpone ice cream.  It reminded me too much of a fig newton and just didn't hit the spot for us.Overall, I would come back here again for the entrees we've tried and the very cozy and welcoming space but the wait does make me a little hesitant.",4.0

"The interior of Vinegar Hill House looks something akin to your great-aunt's ""finished"" basement and less like the whole Brooklyn old-fashioned, antique inspired, wood-interior aesthetic common in places like Williamsburg/Greenpoint. That being said, it's still dark and cozy, utilizing filament bulbs to give the space a nice warm glow. An ample backyard provides dinner guests with a space to sip well-crafted cocktails amidst the trees in warmer weather while waiting for a table and avoiding the three-deep crowd around the bar.It was difficult to get the bartenders attention due to the great amount of patrons packed in hoping for a drink in which to imbibe, but once I did, I was handed one of the largest wine lists I have seen in Brooklyn. Turns out, the carriage house behind the garden is well-stocked with a fine selection of wines. The cocktail list wasn't as ample, however, seemed well crafted.As for the food, this is where Vinegar Hill House definitely stood out amongst all the other high-quality new-american selections out there. It did take a while to get my meal but it was well worth the wait, and the staff apologized and offered either another drink or a free side. Everything was incredible. The roasted baby beets with avocado puree and hazelnuts were amazing; a perfect blend of flavors and textures. My sister ordered the house-made garganelli, which she said was fantastic, as well as the side of the spicy corn. The hake was amazingly light and flaky, with a nice crisp on the outside. For dessert, we had to go with the salted caramel custard with house-made whipped cream and shortbread cookies, which rivals most of the desserts I have had as of late. Overall, you can expect a generous wait time over a leisurely meal, but the wait, as well as the trek to the space itself, is well-worth it.",5.0
"I have dined at Vinegar Hill House on at least 10 occasions given I live in the neighborhood.  It has always been a pleasant and delicious experience.  On a recent Monday evening at 6 pm (the restaurant was completely empty) I brought my 19 month old daughter in addition to some family members from Manhattan who had not yet enjoyed the experience.  To accompany our generous order I asked if it was possible to get a side of scrambled egg. Egg was featured prominently on the menu so this was not a question of great inconvenience or even unavailability. The chef ""respectfully declined"", as if we had special ordered fish sticks and a side of Mac and cheese. As we were frequent patrons, we did not expect a child's menu and rarely have to resort to special requests.  We also did not expect such a pretentious  response.  We will not return and will cease recommending this establishment.",2.0

"It might be that I'm getting old and less and less enamored with everything ""Brooklyn."" I went to Vinegar Hill House recently, and I basically turned into a cranky old person from the get-go. I mean, it was a Tuesday night and fairly early (7pm) and the back was almost empty. They wanted to cram us at a two-top, about four inches from the table next to us (at which people were seated) - there were some four-tops on the opposite side of the yard, but they refused to let us sit there. We opted for inside. So we're seated. I think the too-cool-for-school attitude of the servers is obnoxious. I get that this is Brooklyn and formality is just not done - it doesn't mean that you can't be friendly or bother to crack a smile. (Also, from a style perspective, I think the jeans/loakers/flannel is absolutely ridiculous. But whatever.) So our server comes over, asks what we want to drink, my friend answers, and when I pause to scan the wine list quickly, the server walks away and returns maybe 10 minutes later with my friend's drink and to take my drink order. What? (As an aside: my $12 glass of wine came, and it had totally turned. Like red-wine-vinegar turned. Gross.

But damn - if a party of two is dropping up to $200 on dinner, service cannot be as casual as it was that night. You can do comfy and casual without service sucking - there have got to be standards.

An hour goes by, nothing. We finished off the bottle started freezing and came inside. Waited and waited and waited. When you wait for over an hour, you start to figure that you must be next. NOPE. Not here. After OVER 2 1/2 hours I convinced my crew to get the heck out of there and go somewhere that they at least have a clue how to run. Be frank with people when they come in.

"This restaurant gives the lie to the idea that Brooklyn restaurants, in general, can be seriously competitive with the offerings in Manhattan.  Were it not in an out-of-the-way neighborhood, this place would not have waits for its tables, or the level of notice it has received.  While the presentation - your standard Brooklyn bistro mix of real and faux-antiques - of the restaurant passes muster, and the wine list is diverse, well priced and stocked with delicious offerings, the food simply does not.  A ""squash salad"" is in fact romaine lettuce with a few lonely pieces of squash, coupled with a truly awful, tongue-numbingly bitter feta puree that makes absolutely no sense.  None of my party are still sure whether the ""veal belly"" was actually veal, but whatever it was, it was excessively salty, chewy and generally unappealing.  If I lived in the neighborhood, I might be back, but as it stands, the 7-minute drive from Williamsburg is farther than I'm willing to travel for this.",2.0
"The food is fresh, seasonal and tasty- and the desserts are made from scratch.It is however, overpriced for someplace so out of the way on a deserted street in Dumbo that does not seem so safe to walk in alone at night time.  I say this because even the food was very good, some of the dishes are a bit to 'simple' - like a salad that merely consisted of some raw shaved corn and bits of cheese and sea salt.  Perhaps I'm wrong but the whole point of going to a nice restaurant is to have food that required more skill and time than what you would otherwise make at home, not a dish that takes 5 minutes to prep.This shouldn't deter you from visiting though, the food here is almost Craftbar caliber, and the restaurant offers car service upon request so you can get home safely.",3.0
"Vinegar Hill is awesome and worth the walk from York or High Street on the F or the A,C,E. The drinks are delicious and the food was like... Woah. I'm eating a pork chop?! This is amazing!I've never been a person to order veal or pork at a restaurant. I don't know why. I'm just more into just about anything else on the menu. For some reason on my trip to Vinegar Hill it was just too much to resist. My friend got the pork chop based on Frank Bruni's glowing recommendation and I got the Veal.It was perfect.The outside was perfect the inside was beautiful.I almost cried.Well, not really. All in all we had three rounds of drinks, appetizers, main course, and one of each dessert on the menu for 5 people and we got out of there for a little less than $400. It was reasonable and worth it. The wait staff was friendly and didn't even bother us when we were still there after they closed. All in all a good Vinegar Hill House experience.",4.0
"What a charming little place, hidden away on an otherworldly cobblestone street, yet totally accessible via the F train (you can try taking the A but it's far and confusing).I was told that the place gets really busy, but I'm guessing it's only during Brooklyn-dinner hours (like 8pm+). We got there at 630 on a Friday and were seated immediately. There were still some seats open when we left.I would say the food is a bit Provençal-y, not just straight up ""American"" dining. As such, I forgive the slight priciness. Split everything with my guy, so we could try everything.Ordered:Clam Pie (with bacon, potato, parsley salad)Slightly smaller than expected, but oh so delicious and packed with flavor. Just a tiny hint of clam -- almost just an aroma -- with juicy cuts of bacon, and potatoes cooked just right. The salad was generously dressed and included mandolined radishes and onions, which complemented the strong(ish? It was actually fairly mild) flavor of the parsley. Sweet Bread Cannelloni (with morel mushrooms and blueberries)The waiter said the ""sauce was cooked sous vide, in onions"" ... not sure what that meant exactly, but it was creamy and rich, and not that onion-y. Blueberries added just a tiny bit of sweetness. Yum. Red Wattle Country Chop (with cheddar grits)I was a little skeptical in the beginning because at first glance the chop looked overcooked, but then I took a bite and it was like heaven. Perfect charring adding a smoky taste to a tender, deeply flavorful pork. The cheese grits had a slight punch; some kind of pepper maybe? It was a pretty hefty plate of chop, if only because we felt like it could have used maybe a bit of vegetable to pair (asparagus would have been appropriately spring-y), but alas. Small matter considering how tasty this was.Guinness Chocolate Cake (with cream cheese frosting)I enjoyed dinner so much that I wanted dessert for the sole purpose of trying to see what other dishes this place could make awesomely. I don't even really like chocolate cake. The sponge (dense, dryish, almost bitter) and the frosting (moist, sweet) combined really well together--definitely can't have one without the other. I don't think I could have eaten the whole slice, though.Service was good. Knowledgable and courteous waitstaff.  Definitely coming back; I honestly want to try everything on their menu.",4.0

""So where did he take you?""""He wanted steak so I thought we were heading to Peter Luger, but we arrived at Vinegar Hill House- I'd never even heard of it. It was so charming and the food was amazing""""Ha, Vinegar Hill House, I love that place- romantic. That's his move, he pulled out his big move...""",5.0
"Yes... I've heard great things. My friends all eat there. The food looked and smelled great.... but...My friends and I tried to go last Saturday evening around 7ish. We were told there was about 45 minute to an hour wait for a table of 3. Since it was a freakishly warm NY winter day and the back garden was open (outside with no heat lamps) for waiting, we clawed our way to the bar for a bottle of wine and a few glasses, found a bench outside and caught up. An hour goes by, nothing. We finished off the bottle started freezing and came inside. Waited and waited and waited. When you wait for over an hour, you start to figure that you must be next. NOPE. Not here. After OVER 2 1/2 hours I convinced my crew to get the heck out of there and go somewhere that they at least have a clue how to run. Be frank with people when they come in. It's better to tell someone it could be 2 hours than to have them walk out pissed at close to 3.",1.0
"This restaurant gives the lie to the idea that Brooklyn restaurants, in general, can be seriously competitive with the offerings in Manhattan.  Were it not in an out-of-the-way neighborhood, this place would not have waits for its tables, or the level of notice it has received.  While the presentation - your standard Brooklyn bistro mix of real and faux-antiques - of the restaurant passes muster, and the wine list is diverse, well priced and stocked with delicious offerings, the food simply does not.  A ""squash salad"" is in fact romaine lettuce with a few lonely pieces of squash, coupled with a truly awful, tongue-numbingly bitter feta puree that makes absolutely no sense.  None of my party are still sure whether the ""veal belly"" was actually veal, but whatever it was, it was excessively salty, chewy and generally unappealing.  If I lived in the neighborhood, I might be back, but as it stands, the 7-minute drive from Williamsburg is farther than I'm willing to travel for this.",2.0
"The food is fresh, seasonal and tasty- and the desserts are made from scratch.It is however, overpriced for someplace so out of the way on a deserted street in Dumbo that does not seem so safe to walk in alone at night time.  I say this because even the food was very good, some of the dishes are a bit to 'simple' - like a salad that merely consisted of some raw shaved corn and bits of cheese and sea salt.  Perhaps I'm wrong but the whole point of going to a nice restaurant is to have food that required more skill and time than what you would otherwise make at home, not a dish that takes 5 minutes to prep.This shouldn't deter you from visiting though, the food here is almost Craftbar caliber, and the restaurant offers car service upon request so you can get home safely.",3.0
"Vinegar Hill is awesome and worth the walk from York or High Street on the F or the A,C,E. The drinks are delicious and the food was like... Woah. I'm eating a pork chop?! This is amazing!I've never been a person to order veal or pork at a restaurant. I don't know why. I'm just more into just about anything else on the menu. For some reason on my trip to Vinegar Hill it was just too much to resist. My friend got the pork chop based on Frank Bruni's glowing recommendation and I got the Veal.It was perfect.The outside was perfect the inside was beautiful.I almost cried.Well, not really. All in all we had three rounds of drinks, appetizers, main course, and one of each dessert on the menu for 5 people and we got out of there for a little less than $400. It was reasonable and worth it. The wait staff was friendly and didn't even bother us when we were still there after they closed. All in all a good Vinegar Hill House experience.",4.0
"What a charming little place, hidden away on an otherworldly cobblestone street, yet totally accessible via the F train (you can try taking the A but it's far and confusing).I was told that the place gets really busy, but I'm guessing it's only during Brooklyn-dinner hours (like 8pm+). We got there at 630 on a Friday and were seated immediately. There were still some seats open when we left.I would say the food is a bit Provençal-y, not just straight up ""American"" dining. As such, I forgive the slight priciness. Split everything with my guy, so we could try everything.Ordered:Clam Pie (with bacon, potato, parsley salad)Slightly smaller than expected, but oh so delicious and packed with flavor. Just a tiny hint of clam -- almost just an aroma -- with juicy cuts of bacon, and potatoes cooked just right. The salad was generously dressed and included mandolined radishes and onions, which complemented the strong(ish? It was actually fairly mild) flavor of the parsley. Sweet Bread Cannelloni (with morel mushrooms and blueberries)The waiter said the ""sauce was cooked sous vide, in onions"" ... not sure what that meant exactly, but it was creamy and rich, and not that onion-y. Blueberries added just a tiny bit of sweetness. Yum. Red Wattle Country Chop (with cheddar grits)I was a little skeptical in the beginning because at first glance the chop looked overcooked, but then I took a bite and it was like heaven. Perfect charring adding a smoky taste to a tender, deeply flavorful pork. The cheese grits had a slight punch; some kind of pepper maybe? It was a pretty hefty plate of chop, if only because we felt like it could have used maybe a bit of vegetable to pair (asparagus would have been appropriately spring-y), but alas. Small matter considering how tasty this was.Guinness Chocolate Cake (with cream cheese frosting)I enjoyed dinner so much that I wanted dessert for the sole purpose of trying to see what other dishes this place could make awesomely. I don't even really like chocolate cake. The sponge (dense, dryish, almost bitter) and the frosting (moist, sweet) combined really well together--definitely can't have one without the other. I don't think I could have eaten the whole slice, though.Service was good. Knowledgable and courteous waitstaff.  Definitely coming back; I honestly want to try everything on their menu.",4.0
"Lovely restaurant in one of the more charming little neighborhoods in the city.We had a brilliant dinner here the other night. Started with the pastry dish with the scallops (yum) and the grilled octopus. The grilled octopus was perfect - it is served with white beans, pickled onions, and olives. Brilliant pairing. For the mains we had the skirt steak they had on special - it was rubbed with (I think) green peppercorns and reminded me of the crispy, briny character of pastrami - and a tortelloni that was also on special. The tortelloni  was stuffed with lamb was beautiful except for the fact that while technically it wasn't an appetizer, it was tiny. Four tortelloni. In their defense the waiter did say it was a small portion and the price was fair.We finished with the Guiness cake. Very nice.Great wine list, although we ordered by the glass. They serve the BTG wine in very cute and small glasses and I'd be interested to measure how much they hold as your initial reaction is that it is a very small pour.Oh, and decor. Warm. Inviting.

It took almost 15 minutes just to get our bill. Not a big problem, but for such a small place on a not so busy evening you'd think they'd be a little faster. The atmosphere of the restaurant it was just very chill. It has that rustic western feel to it, where everything is wood with dimmed lighting making dinner seem special and romantic.

"What an adorable place! It's a bit of a trek to an inaccessible neighborhood, but an entirely charming experience.We were seated immediately in the charming back garden, which was perfect on the first really nice night of the year.

For dessert we shared a salted caramel custard - a big highlight of the meal.

"Had brunch here today around noon. Estimated 10-15 minute wait, was more like 15-20 but that's ok on a gorgeous Saturday like today. Screen door entrance, which perfectly describes the look and feel - cozy, woodsy and comfortable. Hipster to a T, but the practical, modern version, not crunchy granola.  Upon arrival, host gave us our menus immediately and we received water and our order was taken relatively quickly by our server.  Our first course, fried oysters, arrived quickly, with my coffee.  Pretty sizable oysters, breaded and served with a wedge of lemon and whole grain mustard sauce. Very tender and fresh with the lingering flavor of seawater.  My broiled grapefruit was one of the most unique dishes I've had - half grapefruit, sectioned and covered with sweet and savory rice crispies flavored with shrimp paste.  Tasty, but unusual for sure and still not sure how I feel about it.  Unagi omelet is out of this world - but very very rich and full of flavor.  Could have definitely used some toast or carb to relieve me, but the frisee and mandarin salad was refreshing (and perhaps could have used a bit more of it).Coffee refills without having to ask, and the busboy remembered it was decaf which was nice. But overall it was difficult to get the attention of a server, and it took a LONG time to get the rest of our food after the oysters (at least 20 minutes?).  However, I will say that whenever we got the attention of a server, they were very attentive and competent. Would definitely come back and try some more yummies the next time I'm in this gorgeous neck of the woods.",4.0

Dessert was perfect, the guiness chocolate cake with cream cheese frosting. Great mix of  people eating, young families on the early side, constant stream of interesting hipsters later on.

"First of all, I called for a reservation and the clerk told me they were booked all evening but I might have a chance as a walk in.  We walked in at 7:15 and only three other tables were taken...  Place was  basically empty.Second, the overly friendly / rude waiter found it tedious to explain the ingredients and preparation of a cod roe spaghetti.   Lastly, both sets of silver wear on out table were dirty.  We cancelled our order and left.   I live in the neighborhood and want  Vinegar  Hill to grow and succeed.    Vinegar Hill House needs to change its attitude!",1.0
"Did your parents ever tell you a story about going on a road trip upstate, breaking down on a country road in the middle of nowhere and walking into an odd-looking country shack--where they then had the best meal of their lives?  If I was a location scout charged with recreating that evening, this is where I'd go.At first glance, the decoration looks a bit ""thrift store"" scattered.  Even before the first bite, the attention to detail comes through in vintage incandescent lights and the equally warm and cozy woodwork throughout.We went on a Sunday evening around 8, and were quickly seated in a half empty room of two four tops and another couple.On a lark, I ordered the Chicken Pot Pie as an appetizer.  It was an incredibly delicious, gentle, flaky and amazingly savory treat.   Same to be said for the Butter Clams, in a broth that was light yet incredibly rich with flavor.Get the flatbread, even if it doesn't come with what you order.  You'll be amazed.For entrees, we shared the Maltagliati and the Lamb special.  Both were incredibly delicious.  I wish I could begin to take apart the flavor profiles of both, but both dishes left me completely stumped yet wanting more.  The lamb was about as close to butter in texture as I've ever experienced with meat, and the octopus was shockingly tender yet firm.The Guiness Chocolate Cake was also quite good, but not nearly as mindblowingly so as the appetizers and entrees.A friend mentioned that the place embodies the German word ""Gemütlichkeit.""  The VHH is indeed a warm, friendly and exquisitely delicious dining experience that is well worth the wait, the trek and dare I say a better value than many of its price-point peers.",5.0

"This place deserves a 3.5, but I was feeling generous so I gave them a 4.  Who knew that Vinegar Hill is an actual neighborhood in Brooklyn.  I always called it, ""that area after DUMBO ends"".  The area is sort of run down and reminds me a bit of a western movie.  I kept waiting to see huge dust balls rolling down the street.  The decor of Vinegar Hill felt very similar.  It was run down and rusty and grungy and instead of lamps they have weirdly shaped wiring surrounding the light bulbs.  There were all sort of weird and seemingly random objects around the room, including a shelf of cactuses? cacti? and sad little plants.  The chairs were wobbly and the ceiling was chipping, but somehow it all made sense after driving through the hood.  We called ahead and the hostess told u to just come on by and we will be seated right away.  Once we got there, she told us it was a 20 minute wait, which later turned to 40.  I was hungry and annoyed.  Luckily we sat at the bar, enjoyed a beer and observed the open kitchen.  Once we were seated and the food arrived, it was delicious and my only complaint was that they have the audacity to charge $8 for a ""salad'.  Why the quotes you ask?  It was lettuce.  Yes, just lettuce.  Lettuce and salad dressing does not a salad make.  We were there for brunch and my husband had the hot dog, which was delicious and I had poached eggs with spinach, also delicious.  Everything did taste great and I will surely return to try their dinner.  Tip: try their ""chef's drink"".  It's what the chef actually drinks while cooking.  It's a very bizarre combo of beer, cumato and hot sauce.  You will either love it or hate it, but it's served in a giant plastic container which makes you love it just a little even if you hate it.",4.0
"Food did not live up to the description and fell very short.  The kitchen staff  was extremely slow and loud to the point where people commented about maybe they had ""anger issues""/We waited for almost 40 minutes before someone stuck some bread and water in front of us because their kitchen was so slow in getting us food. At 45 minutes it came. The sourdough blueberry pancake was burnt. The fried oysters were very good but there was absolutely nothing creole about them as described on the menu.Our waitress was absolutely lovely and outstanding at trying to recover us as customers.However, what tipped me to finally figure I will never go there again was when I was taking a picture of the restaurant the manager comes up to the table and tells me pictures on not allowed of their premises. ??? When you wait 45 minutes for food and there is nothing posted about picture taking and you have a camera, people are going to take pictures. And there is nothing special about the space. Only reason I wanted a picture was for Yelp and my food blog. Maybe if they paid more attention to the service and less to the contrived decor this place would do well. When your restaurant is out of the way and tucked in the midst of power grids and an industrial area you need to be better then average. This place was less than average.

"One of my new favorite restaurants. My girlfriend and I went here for her birthday. we've been a fan of Freeman's alley so we wanted to try this new place. We came on a cold Wednesday, which was probably a good idea because we were seated immediately.She had the chicken liver mousse which was really creamy. I'm a fan of nuts on top of the mousse, adds a nice texture. I tried their aged olive oil which was very good.For the entrees she had the Wittle pork chops and I had the wild boar. The wittle was probably the best pork chop that I've had at a restaurant. We've been to quite a few of the new American restaurants popping up and the pork chops usually disappoint. These just might be better than mom use to make. The wild boar was super tender. They only give you a fork and butter knife and I didn't even need that. Most of the meal I only used my fork, it came off the bone so easily. We had the brussel sprouts as a side which was great, sweeter than I'm use to but really good. The only reason I wouldn't rate it 5 stars is that it is a bit pricey and a bit of a walk from any train station. Overall the place is small but nice. It was great that we got seated early and didn't have to wait in the cold, I would suggest going on a week night. The host was courteous and our waters were always filled. I think I'll be returning to try this chicken that everyone's talking about. If it's better than my mom's chicken maybe she can retire finally.",4.0

Words cannot describe the sensation of joy felt inside my mouth. It melted the way great fish melts in your mouth. The apple cobbler fritter dessert was quite nice. On a down note: it is tiny and the wait is quite long but grab a drink at the bar - best Manhattan in BK.,5.0
"My new favorite restaurant.  Tucked into a cute little residential street, you'd never know it was even there.  Went with a group of 4, and made reservations (they only take a few reservations every day, and leave most of the space for walk-ins).  The small place was packed (even at 9pm on a Sunday night), but we didn't have to wait long to be seated, and while we were waiting we just enjoyed the lovely little back patio.  The place felt very homey and welcoming- fantastic decor-, and given many of the reviews, I was skeptical that the service would be good, but our waiter was attentive, friendly, and on top of things.While all the food was incredibly good, some highlights from the menu on the night we were there include:-Braised squid-Cast iron chicken-Country chop-Mezze meniche-Salted caramel custardWe ordered several other items, and shared amongst the four of us, and, after all that, plus 2 bottles of wine, our bill was $200- I was expecting it to be much higher- definitely worth every penny.  Can't wait to get back there!",5.0

"The cutest little restaurant in the middle of nowhere. Situated in the middle of vinegar hill, next to dumbo, where there are no other restaurants or shops is this little restaurant that everyone seems to know about and love.  On any given night the wait is at least 45 minutes since they do not take reservations or even your name until all people in your party have arrived. So once everyone figures out where the hell this restaurant is, you can then begin to wait an hour or so.  The wait can be tolerable if you snag a seat at the bar or wait in the cute backyard if the weather is nice. After all the waiting and you get to the food you realize why you and everyone waited so long for a table here. The food is well prepared, fuflling and delicious. Pork belly appetizer is tasty and not too heavy, the pasta pork ragu is wholesome and comforting, the favored pork chop is massive and flavorful and the roasted chicken is a classic.  Dessert is worth ordering.Overall, a delicious meal in a adorable rustic cozy setting.

"The food was mostly outstanding. I'll start with what went wrong. Sat down and had meat plate - yikes. 4 measly strips of very thin bacon fat, some duck pate with super cold rendered duck fat mixed in that tasted like sand paper paste. Three one once chunks of so-so cheese. I could have picked up the same stuff at my corner grocer's. Ok. That's it. That was so bad I had to mention it. Now...what went right. Chicken Liver app. Outstanding. Their squash side dish...next time I go, I'll order it for an app. Their country pork chop. Delicious. The Hake dish. Outstanding. The ravoli was to die for...and could quite possibly kill me considering the amount of butter slathered all over it. I didn't miss a drop. The two desserts were very good, but nothing off the charts. The wine list was full of lovely wines and some that were even bargains. A very nice selection. So, wondering why three stars. Well, it's the kind of place you walk into and expect everyone to be, at the very least civil. This, however is either not part of their ""style"" or somebody missed the memo. Being snotty to your patrons does not endear them to continue spending large sums of money. We were 4 people. Two of us started the evening off by ordering liberally from the bar, then had apps, sides, entrees, dessert, coffee...over 400 dollars without tip. We decided to leave and spend another similar amount nearby to celebrate a happy occasion. We would have loved to stay at the bar, but the staff was so ""sterile"".

There was some room at the bar so we were able to have a cocktail while waiting (so no complaints there!).The FoodThe pork chop with cheese grits was totally delicious, although the middle was severely undercooked - the grits were fantastic and totally decadent. I had heard about the pork chop from a show on Foodnetwork ( Frank Bruni raved about it)  so we were really looking forward to this. It was unfortunate that it wasn't properly cooked. Because we were with 2 other people we decided to let it slide since everyone else's meals were spot on. I ordered the chicken (served in a quaint iron cast dish) and it was perfectly crispy on the outside and moist inside. Simple, homey and perfect.The ravioli with oxtail was amazing. Small portion (it was an app) but just enough to want more - I would suggest getting a larger portion as a main.The apple and cheddar salad was wonderful, balanced, crispy, light and fresh. Just what a starter salad should be.The total winner was the baked squash - I know, I know - squash? It sounds plain and boring. And when it arrived at the table it looked like a halved butternut squash simply baked in the oven. But no, once I took a scoop it was so flavorful I couldn't believe it. The squash is pureed with butter, cream, cayenne and maple syrup, then distributed back into the squash shell and broiled for a few minutes to get a nice brown coat on the top. Order this.Overall, this place is a winner. We need to go back and try the pork chop again since it was our fault for not mentioning the undercooked-ness.

"I just don't get it folks. The service was terrible. The food was not good. And it was not cheap.I took my husband here for a special occasion. He likes simple food, well prepared, so I thought this would be a good fit. We were also trying to make a movie at BAM, so hoped to be able to get through dinner in about an hour and a half. Ha! When we arrived the restaurant was not busy and we were seated immediately. The server was nice, but everything took FOREVER. We don't drink, so I always feel a little bad for our server who can't work up a big bill, but they could have gotten us out of there fast and turned the table if they had a clue, which apparently they do not. We were there for an hour before I'd even gotten through my salad. Then we sat staring at our empty table waiting and waiting for our food to arrive. At each step it took them ages just to clear our dishes and get on with it.My husband is not a big fan of strongly flavored cheese and creamy dairy products. This is not generally a hinderance to having a nice meal. So it was rather annoying to discover that almost every single dish contained some kind of strongly flavored cheese (blue, parm, fontina). Even the freaking mashed potatoes, which are usually safe, contained feta. But hey, if you're crazy about cheese, this is  a selling point. It's just that there are few cheese and dairy-free options.I also had the fennel salad with grapefruit, walnuts and maytag. I love all of these ingredients, but the combo was lackluster. The big clumps of fennel were really unappealing. My husband and I both ordered the chicken two ways, which was godawful salty, and came on a bed of bitter greens and freaking yogurt! Yogurt! I like yogurt, and I found it a very odd pairing. Icky. Even the chocolate tart was blah. How do you make blah chocolate?The place filled up while we were there that the restaurant filled with standing, waiting people--and it got LOUD.

I ordered mine ""up"", (even made the ""up"" gesture with my thumb) which means served in a martini style glass.

Seemed like she had a problem with it but she researched and told him what he could order, which was 3 things from the menu. Fine. I noticed the skillet chicken arrive at the next table, looking rather boiled and translucent. I ask if mine could be crispy. She said yes so I ordered this. We also ordered the brussels sprouts with peanuts and mint. The salads arrived. They were very small but ok. All the while, the waitress never smiles and it seems like she never has. The pork arrived. It was small but my partner liked it. My chicken arrived and it looked as it did at the table next to us. Rather than be crispy and yummy and skillet-ed, it was boiled tasting and underseasoned. The mint on the brussels was overpowering and wrong. I mean, you can use mint on brussels, but, really, should you? Flavors were just off-putting. I kind of got the feeling either the chef wasn't there this night or maybe got the feeling the chef just learned how to cook at another restaurant rather than being properly trained. Just a feeling.Rather than order dessert, we just kind of wanted out of there.

I refuse to wait for a table these days (and you'll wait...and wait if you dont go off hours) so the BF and I went Monday night at 9 or so and had a delightful time.  the restaurant has a great vibe and decor and great hipster waiters and fashions...nice art on the wall round it out to be totally in style and worth the trip (as long as you dont wait) I wasn't dissapointed by the food, just that they stopped making the bone marrow ravioli...boo hiss...they replaced it with plain butternut squash or something...started with the clams...excellent and fresh, with amazing FRESH flatbread...again...if anyone asks i dont eat carbs...wish they sent over a basket of those babies...hot as fire (temperature) and delicious.  they DID have an interesting cow brain ravioli on the special list that night, which ended up being nice for our next course...quite buttery and if you didn't know it was brain you'd think it was just really creamy cheese...get some bread to sop up the sauce served with it...caper/butter...it was pretty traditional French sauce...dissapointing was the rag torn pasta with octopus and pork which seemed like i was eating 3 different things...they just didn't work well together...not that it tasted bad...it just didn't work...but i love octopus anyway so that plate got licked...our final course was the porkchop presented VERY aesthetically cut for us and presented on a cuttingboard with a small bit of saurkraut...again...wish i had a cauldran of that...it was really nice.  i'm not a huge fan of pork chops since they usually come from the kitchen in this HUGE unmanagable portion with that damn bone sticking out of it...but VHH did it nicely...got a side of b. sprouts which were pretty typical, but nice. dessert was least impressive with the salted caramel and shortbreads (cookies...lol)...too salty...chef needs to get the balance a little better there...like i said...i'm glad we didn't wait in line to eat here...its good, it's well priced but i'd have been just hangry if i waited for 1 hr to eat...after 2 glass of white and 2 glass of red, and all the above, tax, tip we spent 150.  not terrible considering if it were manhattan it would have been 200+ and not nearly as nice...",3.0
"One of my current top 10 restuarants in the city. Went there again for the 4th time in as many months and once again they delivered. From the Black Pepper Pappardelle to the Steak and Eggs and the Salted Carmel for desert, Vinegar Hill House delivered every time.  The place is warm, comfortable and not pretentious. The service is good (although sometimes a little uncoordinated). The bartenders are personable, attentive and mix some great cocktails, so if your alone you'll enjoy your time at the bar as well.",4.0
"One of my favorite places in the city, and I say that having only been here twice (both on wintry evenings). If only I lived in the neighborhood -- this place would be such a comfort. Before I get to the food, let's talk about the warm, cozy, inviting ambiance. There's nothing I love more than being tucked away in a corner, seemingly miles away from your troubles and enjoying the company and conversation of a good friend. Now, on to the food and drink. Phenomenal on both counts. The cocktails are so well made -- you really have to be careful. The sprouts and butternut squash risotto are amazing, and someone in your party must get the cast iron chicken. I really didn't notice whether the staff was slow or unfriendly as other reviewers have noticed, as I was too wrapped up in conversation. As for the wait on weekends, it's to be expected, so I recommend going for an early dinner on a weeknight.",5.0
"What a quaint and charming little cafe. Came here for drinks and apps on a Saturday night with a friend after riding the ferry from Greenpoint to Dumbo. It has a very northern California feel to it. Super intimate and would highly recommend this place for a date night or to bring your folks to when they're in town visiting. I can't really comment on the entrees but I can say that the drinks and the tomato and cantaloupe salad that we shared were exquisite. We sat at the bar and were greeted by the awesome bartender Garrett who was really friendly, knowledgeable, and well spoken. My friend got an old fashioned while I got a dark and stormy. Garrett explained that they did not have ginger beer on hand to make my dark and stormy but instead he used freshly pressed ginger along with simple syrup to make what had to be the best tasting dark and stormy I've ever had! The fresh ginger gave it a spicy kick that has since set a very high bar for future dark and stormies. Next time I return to Dumbo I will definitely be returning to the Vinegar Hill House.",5.0

"We looked for a place within walking distance for a casual Monday night dinner for two, and the restaurant's ambience upped it up a notch to a casual but romantic outing. You'd never guess that the house-turned-business along an otherwise quiet and understated street would give way to such a cozy dining experience. While we were seated inside for dinner, we had a chance to wait in their outdoor courtyard area (15 minutes), which is absolutely lovely--think vines intertwined with lights hanging overhead, and wooden, candle-lit tables set up on the cobbled courtyard (only minus is that you're susceptible to become dinner for insects if you go on a sweltering summer night like this one).What we ordered: lamb bolognese (starter pasta), cast iron chicken (entree 1), pork chop with cheesy grits (entree 2), roasted beets and hazelnuts on avocado puree (shared side). The food exceeded our expectations, although it also meant slightly exceeding our budget. Though the bolognese isn't really a starter, we really wanted to give it a try, and the portion was just right to split between 2 as an app. The cast iron chicken comes in a delicious, generous gravy, so be sure to ask for bread to sop it up. The pork was marinated perfectly, and the cheesy grits were the best I've had. Before heading out, I was hesitant about the service after reading other yelp reviews, but we had no such complaints tonight. Our server was attentive, courteous, and thankfully expedient when it came to ordering and delivering our food. We were too full for dessert, and one of us is to pregnant to drink, so I can't rate them on either of those counts. However, I did glance longingly at the wine list for a moment, which was pretty extensive, especially when compared to their restrained but excellently executed dinner menu. They also have a full bar, it seems. Would love to go back to try their Sunday brunch and eat outdoors. Definitely recommend for dinner.",4.0
"I don't think I've ever said this before--but this was actually worth the hour plus wait in the freezing cold. I wish they took reservations, but I guess I'm one of those suckers who is willing to sit outside for what seems like an endless amount of time just to get a shot at eating their ridiculously tasty food. Party of 3 last night (celebration dinner for a friend), and we devoured:  -fall salad  -squash tart -red wattle country chop -pasta (the mezzemaniche) -short rib -brussels sprouts -salted caramel pudding -apple bread puddingOverall, I was incredibly impressed. I had several bites of the chop, and ate most of the pasta myself. The pasta was cooked perfectly, and I was a huge huge fan of the spicy lamb ragu on top (with ricotta to blend in at  your discretion). The red wattle chop was also delectable, and although I didn't try the short rib I heard very good things about both the meat and the spreadable marrow.  The fall salad was great with a very cumin-y tasting dressing, and the butternut squash tart was rich and tasty. I think the food was an A+ overall, although the dessert was just a B. Tasty but nothing super special. The salted caramel was better than the nice-tasting-but-overall-eh bread pudding, but so rich it was almost too much to eat. The bartender was fantastic--she clearly knew her stuff, and as we ate at the bar she also acted as a more than competent server. We'll be back...although we might try to pick a weird time. That hour plus wait was bad & cold!!",4.0
"TWO & A HALF HOUR WAIT! We were told there would be an hour wait, which I found acceptable for a party of 5. We watched multiple parties of 2 and parties of 4 (who came in after us) being seated before us because this restaurant has NO MANAGEMENT SKILLS. They couldn't use the common sense to hold a table of two for 10 minutes while the table of four next to it finished and left, put the two tables together and seat us. NOOOOOO, they made us wait 2.5 hours until the entire restaurant died down and there were various empty tables. We arrived at 8:30pm and were seated at 11pm. At this point we were exhausted from standing and waiting around, and I at least expected a round of drinks on the house from these people. NOTHING! Not even a ""sorry for the wait""... just nothing. The food was good, but nothing mind-blowing... nothing worth a 2.5 hour wait. I would never return solely because of the way they mismanaged seating us. Based on the food alone, I would definitely return, but clearly they have a few things to learn before that ever happens.",2.0

I refuse to wait for a table these days (and you'll wait...and wait if you dont go off hours) so the BF and I went Monday night at 9 or so and had a delightful time.  the restaurant has a great vibe and decor and great hipster waiters and fashions...nice art on the wall round it out to be totally in style and worth the trip (as long as you dont wait) I wasn't dissapointed by the food, just that they stopped making the bone marrow ravioli...boo hiss...they replaced it with plain butternut squash or something...started with the clams...excellent and fresh, with amazing FRESH flatbread...again...if anyone asks i dont eat carbs...wish they sent over a basket of those babies...hot as fire (temperature) and delicious.  they DID have an interesting cow brain ravioli on the special list that night, which ended up being nice for our next course...quite buttery and if you didn't know it was brain you'd think it was just really creamy cheese...get some bread to sop up the sauce served with it...caper/butter...it was pretty traditional French sauce...dissapointing was the rag torn pasta with octopus and pork which seemed like i was eating 3 different things...they just didn't work well together...not that it tasted bad...it just didn't work...but i love octopus anyway so that plate got licked...our final course was the porkchop presented VERY aesthetically cut for us and presented on a cuttingboard with a small bit of saurkraut...again...wish i had a cauldran of that...it was really nice.  i'm not a huge fan of pork chops since they usually come from the kitchen in this HUGE unmanagable portion with that damn bone sticking out of it...but VHH did it nicely...got a side of b. sprouts which were pretty typical, but nice. dessert was least impressive with the salted caramel and shortbreads (cookies...lol)...too salty...chef needs to get the balance a little better there...like i said...i'm glad we didn't wait in line to eat here...its good, it's well priced but i'd have been just hangry if i waited for 1 hr to eat...after 2 glass of white and 2 glass of red, and all the above, tax, tip we spent 150.  not terrible considering if it were manhattan it would have been 200+ and not nearly as nice...",3.0
"One of my current top 10 restuarants in the city. Went there again for the 4th time in as many months and once again they delivered. From the Black Pepper Pappardelle to the Steak and Eggs and the Salted Carmel for desert, Vinegar Hill House delivered every time.  The place is warm, comfortable and not pretentious. The service is good (although sometimes a little uncoordinated). The bartenders are personable, attentive and mix some great cocktails, so if your alone you'll enjoy your time at the bar as well.",4.0
"One of my favorite places in the city, and I say that having only been here twice (both on wintry evenings). If only I lived in the neighborhood -- this place would be such a comfort. Before I get to the food, let's talk about the warm, cozy, inviting ambiance. There's nothing I love more than being tucked away in a corner, seemingly miles away from your troubles and enjoying the company and conversation of a good friend. Now, on to the food and drink. Phenomenal on both counts. The cocktails are so well made -- you really have to be careful. The sprouts and butternut squash risotto are amazing, and someone in your party must get the cast iron chicken. I really didn't notice whether the staff was slow or unfriendly as other reviewers have noticed, as I was too wrapped up in conversation. As for the wait on weekends, it's to be expected, so I recommend going for an early dinner on a weeknight.",5.0
"What a quaint and charming little cafe. Came here for drinks and apps on a Saturday night with a friend after riding the ferry from Greenpoint to Dumbo. It has a very northern California feel to it. Super intimate and would highly recommend this place for a date night or to bring your folks to when they're in town visiting. I can't really comment on the entrees but I can say that the drinks and the tomato and cantaloupe salad that we shared were exquisite. We sat at the bar and were greeted by the awesome bartender Garrett who was really friendly, knowledgeable, and well spoken. My friend got an old fashioned while I got a dark and stormy. Garrett explained that they did not have ginger beer on hand to make my dark and stormy but instead he used freshly pressed ginger along with simple syrup to make what had to be the best tasting dark and stormy I've ever had! The fresh ginger gave it a spicy kick that has since set a very high bar for future dark and stormies. Next time I return to Dumbo I will definitely be returning to the Vinegar Hill House.",5.0

"So amazing!  Very warm ambiance.Start with a cocktail off the menu.  Garret makes a mean vodka gimlet.There was a special pork belly app that knocked my socks off.  When in doubt, order pork belly.  Always a thing to remember.The pork chop dish was so delicious.  The meat was tender, the flavor was savory and the grits it layed on were downright sinful.Chocolate cake everyone was raving about was ok.  The frosting is what made it.",4.0
"We looked for a place within walking distance for a casual Monday night dinner for two, and the restaurant's ambience upped it up a notch to a casual but romantic outing. You'd never guess that the house-turned-business along an otherwise quiet and understated street would give way to such a cozy dining experience. While we were seated inside for dinner, we had a chance to wait in their outdoor courtyard area (15 minutes), which is absolutely lovely--think vines intertwined with lights hanging overhead, and wooden, candle-lit tables set up on the cobbled courtyard (only minus is that you're susceptible to become dinner for insects if you go on a sweltering summer night like this one).What we ordered: lamb bolognese (starter pasta), cast iron chicken (entree 1), pork chop with cheesy grits (entree 2), roasted beets and hazelnuts on avocado puree (shared side). The food exceeded our expectations, although it also meant slightly exceeding our budget. Though the bolognese isn't really a starter, we really wanted to give it a try, and the portion was just right to split between 2 as an app. The cast iron chicken comes in a delicious, generous gravy, so be sure to ask for bread to sop it up. The pork was marinated perfectly, and the cheesy grits were the best I've had. Before heading out, I was hesitant about the service after reading other yelp reviews, but we had no such complaints tonight. Our server was attentive, courteous, and thankfully expedient when it came to ordering and delivering our food. We were too full for dessert, and one of us is to pregnant to drink, so I can't rate them on either of those counts. However, I did glance longingly at the wine list for a moment, which was pretty extensive, especially when compared to their restrained but excellently executed dinner menu. They also have a full bar, it seems. Would love to go back to try their Sunday brunch and eat outdoors. Definitely recommend for dinner.",4.0
"I don't think I've ever said this before--but this was actually worth the hour plus wait in the freezing cold. I wish they took reservations, but I guess I'm one of those suckers who is willing to sit outside for what seems like an endless amount of time just to get a shot at eating their ridiculously tasty food. Party of 3 last night (celebration dinner for a friend), and we devoured:  -fall salad  -squash tart -red wattle country chop -pasta (the mezzemaniche) -short rib -brussels sprouts -salted caramel pudding -apple bread puddingOverall, I was incredibly impressed. I had several bites of the chop, and ate most of the pasta myself. The pasta was cooked perfectly, and I was a huge huge fan of the spicy lamb ragu on top (with ricotta to blend in at  your discretion). The red wattle chop was also delectable, and although I didn't try the short rib I heard very good things about both the meat and the spreadable marrow.  The fall salad was great with a very cumin-y tasting dressing, and the butternut squash tart was rich and tasty. I think the food was an A+ overall, although the dessert was just a B. Tasty but nothing super special. The salted caramel was better than the nice-tasting-but-overall-eh bread pudding, but so rich it was almost too much to eat. The bartender was fantastic--she clearly knew her stuff, and as we ate at the bar she also acted as a more than competent server. We'll be back...although we might try to pick a weird time. That hour plus wait was bad & cold!!",4.0
"TWO & A HALF HOUR WAIT! We were told there would be an hour wait, which I found acceptable for a party of 5. We watched multiple parties of 2 and parties of 4 (who came in after us) being seated before us because this restaurant has NO MANAGEMENT SKILLS. They couldn't use the common sense to hold a table of two for 10 minutes while the table of four next to it finished and left, put the two tables together and seat us. NOOOOOO, they made us wait 2.5 hours until the entire restaurant died down and there were various empty tables. We arrived at 8:30pm and were seated at 11pm. At this point we were exhausted from standing and waiting around, and I at least expected a round of drinks on the house from these people. NOTHING! Not even a ""sorry for the wait""... just nothing. The food was good, but nothing mind-blowing... nothing worth a 2.5 hour wait. I would never return solely because of the way they mismanaged seating us. Based on the food alone, I would definitely return, but clearly they have a few things to learn before that ever happens.",2.0
"I went on a Friday night, and had to wait 40 minutes, but it was worth it (and the hostess was very gracious).The pork chop was unlike any pork we'd ever tasted; the cast-iron chicken was fantastic too.  The side of pureed squash with roasted pumpkin seeds was great also.  The dishes were ""chef-salted,"" but otherwise perfectly seasoned.  We didn't order appetizers, wisely, as it turns out, since the portions are quite large.The desserts WERE amazing - I ordered the best chocolate cake I've had in years.  It was real cake, floury, dense, and burnt on the bottom.The service was professional, despite the crowd and the small space.  Easily the best restaurant in DUMBO, and a destination spot for everyone.",5.0
"I celebrated Memorial Day Weekend by starting on the slippery slope of day drinking. We kicked off the day at Spin, the ping pong club owned by Susan Sarandon (yes, you heard correctly), and continued in true New York City style by drinking on multiple rooftops.So to say that I was slightly buzzed by the time I got off the F train for dinner in Vinegar Hill, Brooklyn would be a dangerous understatement. The setting sun, and quick stop at my apartment, had done nothing to curb my stupor, and it was 9:15 by the time I stumbled into Vinegar Hill House, meeting up with a far more sober crowd for what I hoped would be a fantastic American meal.Our group of 7 presented us with the opportunity to try the whole menu (except for the very last steak for 2 for $100, which we passed on), so I not-so-subtly tried to steer people into ordering different things. This turned out to be quite easy, since everyone was already willing to try everything, and it's hard to be subtle when you're drunk.First up, a pickle plate of sweet bread and butter pickles and garlicky half-sours. I'm a devout pickle snob, so I was surprised when the half-sours reminded me of my great-grandfather's pickle recipe that I now call my own. Fortunately, while the flavor was strong, the intense backbone of lingering heat that distinguishes my homemade pickles was completely absent, leaving me secretly relieved.Filled with green pea-ness, the English Pea ravioli was cooked perfectly al dente, with a cream sauce and an intense pea flavor that did not overwhelm. Great dish.Other appetizers arrived in waves. A glass jar of chicken liver mousse was topped with pistachios for an earthy combination. While this was a nice touch (I love pistachios), for some reason, I've been underwhelmed with all the chicken liver mousse I've tried lately. It must be a personal failing on my part (and I think I like chopped liver better anyway).Spinach salad was elevated by the combination of sweet strawberries and pine nuts against the smokey bacon and piquant buttermilk dressing. Maybe slightly overdressed, but still an excellent salad starter.The weakest appetizer was the octopus, which was refreshingly tender, but the octopus itself ended up tasting like canned tuna. Pass.Our mains were uniformly outstanding. I ordered the fluke with a duck crackling crust, celery, walnuts and cherries. The fluke was cooked perfectly, with the duck fat in the crust adding a crunchy richness to the rest of the dish. The mixture of celery, walnuts and cherries, while good, felt like it should be served in October rather than at the beginning of Summer. A minor complaint, but that's what I'm here for.Lamb shoulder with pearl barley and onions was fantastic. The lamb was meltingly tender and not at all dry. I usually find barley to be soupy and overcooked, but here it was pleasingly al dente, soaking up the flavors of the lamb.I was too drunk at this point to remember the specifics of the cast iron chicken, but I'm fairly certain it was delicious-- with the rich pan-juice gravy standing out.Lamb heart and liver papardelle was very good, the pasta again cooked perfectly, with just the right ratio of sauce to pasta. The squeeze of lemon and parsley managed to mellow out the stronger flavors of the lamb and liver.The pork chop with cheese grits was really fantastic and made me wish I'd ordered one for myself. The chop had a serious char, and was cooked medium rare. It had a strong porkiness, with a slightly aged flavor (maybe this was from the char). The cheese grits were fine, and the strong cheddar cut through the meaty char, mixing with the pan sauce. I managed to snag the two bone pieces, which I picked clean while we finished our mains.Desserts were not as consistent.The chocolate cake was pretty boring, tasting like a less cloying Hostess cupcake. No discernible Guinness taste. Most of the flavor came from the cream cheese icing on top.The salty caramel custard was on the verge of being too salty, but the butter cookies and whipped cream helped balance the flavor slightly, although not enough to harmonize the dessert. I think I would have pronounced it saltier if I weren't already drunk.Surprisingly, the ginger upside-down cake, which on paper interested me the least, turned out to be the best of all. The sweet bite of the ginger cooked into the extremely moist cake paired well with the buttermilk ice cream. Definitely choose this dessert.Here is where I would conclude with the obligatory description of new Brooklyn cuisine and contrast it with the supposedly ""typical"" Manhattan restaurants such as Pulino's and The Breslin. I'll pass on that conversation.Instead, I'll say that Vinegar Hill House serves up an unpretentious New (classic?) American meal in a relaxed setting at a reasonable price. Can the same not be found in Manhattan? I'll disagree, but Vinegar Hill House is a great restaurant that would be welcome anywhere.lawandfood.blogspot.com",4.0
"This place is somewhere one of my best friends rally likes. He had been urging me and my spouse to give it a try. We wound up going together the three of us, spur-of-the-moment style, ~7ish on a Friday in early June. The neighborhood is tiny but cute/quaint/cool. The restaurant looks cool on the inside, but we were only there for a moment before being whisked out to the back garden. The ambiance out there was real chill - trees overhanging, staff going back to their 2nd house(!) - which together with the main restaurant brackets the back yard and which seems to be used as storage/wine space - a couple other tables taken, but not crowded at all. I had risotto with peas and mint. The color was vey pleasant, and the texture was excellent. As regards the flavor, I could have wished the mint was more assertive alongside the peas (and I had feared the opposite - all mint) but it was pretty good. My friend had the bass, which was paired with chickpea fritters and something else suspiciously falafel-y.

"This was my second time eating here, although this time was for brunch.

Our original plan was to go to Jack The Horse, but we didn't realize that they only do Sunday brunch, not weekend brunch. Anyways...We got there around 1:30 and it was about 1/2 full, which is in stark contrast to dinner when you often have to wait. Made for a nice and leisurely meal. I had the sourdough pancake with ricotta and maple pecan glaze and a side of bacon. It was *really* good, much better than the version that I had tried at Bubby's a few months ago. My b/f got the crab omelette and his friend got the baked eggs dish. We also split a couple orders of sausage links, curious if they would be as good as the patties at Jack The Horse. They were really tasty, but they were different instead of being better.As far as drinks, they have an excellent bar and know how to make proper cocktails.

"I ate at Vinegar Hill House on the recommendation of my cousin, who is a Brooklyn local, while on a short trip to NYC this December. I followed the subway directions listed on their website (F line to the York St. stop). At first, it looks like we were in a rough area, but then we noticed that every car parked on the road was a luxury car of some sort. It ends up being a little out of the way in what appears to be an old neighborhood with brick paved streets, and has lots of character.My friend and I arrived at about 5:30 pm for diner (we had a concert to attend at 8, so we wanted to make sure we had plenty of time). Although the restaurant wasn't open yet, the directed us next door to their bar where we enjoyed some excellent espresso until they opened. We were the first ones in and were seated right away. They had a limited menu, but everything sounded really good. I ordered the wild boar shank and a North Coast Scrimshaw Pilsner and my friend ordered the Whole Trout with the Ballast Point IPA. My friend enjoyed his trout and my boar shank was incredible. It came on a bed of grits and roasted pumpkin seeds that were average, but as a southerner, I probably have high standards for grits. A word of warning, this placed filled up quickly. By 6:30 there were no empty tables! So if you want to go, go early or be prepared to wait. I highly recommend Vinegar Hill House.",5.0

It is a perfect date spot.The food is amazing and has a great farm to table vibe. the menu is ever-changing and here is what we recommend...The cast iron chicken is perfectly roasted and so juicy. It came out as simple as ever on the cast iron pan straight from the oven. I order this often, but as simple as it is i NEVER get tired of eating it. extremely crave-worthy.The portions are perfect and the sides are nice to share. We had the corn salad which was so fresh and tasty.can't wait for the next time to go back- Salty Pepa",5.0
"I took the Old Man for dinner here on his first night in NYC. He is a very fussy eater,  so it's a pain in the arse to try to find something he likes. Anyway, for the rest of his time in NYC he did not shut up about how good it was. As annoying as it was to hear the same story about the chicken 12 times, he was quite correct. Tip: Good for groups but need to book.",5.0
"On a rare occasion that we have a car, we sometimes like to venture to less than subway friendly restaurants.The wait on a Sat. night seemed to go much more quickly than the 1.5 hour when we checked in around 7:20.  Lucky for US!  There were others waiting much longer.  Best bet go as a party of 2.  Resos are only taken for larger parties, I think.    We got the appetizer special called the presse.  This was a delicious concoction terrine type of thing with mitake mushrooms, pork knuckle, foie gras and lentils.  Also, we tried the grilled octopus and this was also amazing.  Then for the mains we did the skillet chicken and the wattle chop.  Okay, I now understand all the raving lunatics that want to come to this place.  The sauce on the chicken was so amazing, making it one of my favorite chicken dishes ever ordered in a restaurant.  Both dishes were so awesome, it really does make you want to slap your momma!  Then everything finished off with the guiness chocolate cake.  The moist dense cake was topped with this amazing cream cheese icing that just had this amazing addictive quality. Looking forward to another return for Brunch and may find a reason to stay out there just to come back for dinner...",4.0
"I ate at Vinegar Hill House on the recommendation of my cousin, who is a Brooklyn local, while on a short trip to NYC this December. I followed the subway directions listed on their website (F line to the York St. stop). At first, it looks like we were in a rough area, but then we noticed that every car parked on the road was a luxury car of some sort. It ends up being a little out of the way in what appears to be an old neighborhood with brick paved streets, and has lots of character.My friend and I arrived at about 5:30 pm for diner (we had a concert to attend at 8, so we wanted to make sure we had plenty of time). Although the restaurant wasn't open yet, the directed us next door to their bar where we enjoyed some excellent espresso until they opened. We were the first ones in and were seated right away. They had a limited menu, but everything sounded really good. I ordered the wild boar shank and a North Coast Scrimshaw Pilsner and my friend ordered the Whole Trout with the Ballast Point IPA. My friend enjoyed his trout and my boar shank was incredible. It came on a bed of grits and roasted pumpkin seeds that were average, but as a southerner, I probably have high standards for grits. A word of warning, this placed filled up quickly. By 6:30 there were no empty tables! So if you want to go, go early or be prepared to wait. I highly recommend Vinegar Hill House.",5.0

"Really, it's not easy to take simple ""comfort food"" dishes and elevate them to something delicious, unique and fantastic while keeping the comfort intact.  Many places have headed in this direction the past two years and few get it right.  Vinegar Hill House gets it fantastically right.  The food is phenomenal: fresh, organic and local as much as possible, high quality, made with love and integrity with a dash of creativity.  Their cast iron roast chicken is a return-repeat dish for any season.  Menu does change every season or even every couple of months.   Red Wattle pork chop is also a solid year-round hit.  Brook Trout in late summer was fantastic - crispy skin, moist and flaky flesh, lovely herbs and veggies.  Brunch is also terrific.  You can go sweet, savory or a combination and everything is made with attention to optimum flavor.  It's cute, small, but honestly quaint and real.  100% Brooklyn.",4.0

The server mentioned a new pastry chef, but there has to be a new chef as well because there is no skill in evidence on the plates. Chewy pasta in a tepid bowl of pasta water; how did that make it out to the table? Even their old signature dishes now disappoint. The chicken liver mousse, once so rich is now bland and chalky.

The plates of food I saw while waiting to sit down looked delicious, and I couldn't wait to order. The things I tried were the beets with horseradish, the cheese plate, a special they had of roasted peppers with an egg sauce, the tart, and the sweet corn ravioli with bacon and sage.

"Two words: Short ribs. My God! I know everyone raves about the chop, but my wife and I had them side by side and the chop paled by comparison. As a whole, everything was excellent. I had the octopus app and wifey had the watermelon salad. Both solid. Then the mains came, and we know who won that battle (see above).  But the okra & zuchini side we got was also pretty killer. And for dessert, the Guinness Chocolate cake with cream cheese frosting wasn't too shabby either. In fact, even our cocktails were quite good. The only nits would be it's location, which is pretty sketchy, it's decor is just eh, and the hostess has a bit of a tude. So, in summary, if I could give half stars, I'd give it 4.5. But since I can't, I have to go with 4. It's fantastic and totally worth the wait, as they don't take reservations, but it ain't 5 stars perfect. At least not yet.",4.0
"A friend recommended Vinegar Hill House, located in the DUMBO (an acronym first used by Seinfeld in a late-night show) section of Brooklyn.It's a great find. The food is superb, although from the outside it is a downtrodden storefront. Inside, it's quaint, cuddly and offbeat.To more important things - the food: it's imaginative, it's inspired, it's well-executed. Of particular interest are the appetizers. I had Manila clams, simmered in a curry flavored butter sauce and served with fried Middle Eastern bread. My hosts had a chicken liver mousse and aragula salad with very thinly sliced kumquats segments. Truly wonderful.The main courses are also accomplished. Their signature dish is a tender, very finely prepared pork chop, served sliced with a bracing sauerkraut. My lady friend enjoyed a rabbit ragu served with papardella. I had the cast iron chicken.

"This was quite the recommendation by my friend. It has a quaint little ""hole in the wall"" type feel.When you get to the block of the restaurant, you start to think maybe you got the wrong directions. It looks like a residential neighborhood with no stores or restaurants in sight. Don't give up though. It's there! There are no signs for the restaurant but as you walk by it'll definitely catch your eye. The place is always packed! If you go with one friend, it should be fine. Group dinner is definitely not recommended due the size of the place. It definitely is a good environment. The place is very dimly lit (candles on each table) so it has a nice intimate type feel but then again the next table is literally inches away. So much for privacy! Just wish there was a little more space between the tables for easier movement and that way the next table won't try to cut into your conversation. I was interrupted a couple times by the next table when they wanted to tell us how great the food was without us asking. Maybe they were just crazy people. *shrugz*Onto the food! First the appetizers, we had ordered the chicken liver mousse with vinegar onions and pistachios. It's basically a spread. You put it on the bread that it comes with and take a bite. So delicious! The mousse was so creamy with great flavors. It has a fatty texture to it. I wish I could have this on toast every day! Plus I love pistachios! After finishing the bread, I just scooped the mousse by itself to try. It can definitely be eaten with just a spoon (like peanut butter) but it tastes so much better with bread. The little salad that comes with it is really fresh and crunchy. The second appetizer is the charred pork belly with masa flatbread, watercress, sour cream and pumpkin seeds. Get a little of everything from this dish and insert into mouth. That's what heaven taste like! The pork belly was amazing! It melts in your mouth like M&Ms. Everything just goes together so well. I don't even know how to explain it. Just go try it and you'll see what I mean! The one thing I regret ordering were the Brussels sprouts. I'm anti-vegetable but I thought I'd give it a shot since it was recommended by some yelpers. Boy do I regret listening to them. Ugh! Not to mention they are slightly burnt (I think it was meant to be that way). It left this nasty taste in my mouth. Luckily there was still some pork belly and mousse left to help me get rid of the bad taste. I would just stick with the belly and mousse. Who needs vegetables when the most popular dish here is...THE RED WATTLE COUNTRY CHOPS WITH CHEDDAR GRITS! These pork chops are divine! They were juicy and flavorful. Plus, there was just the right about of fat on them. They were cooked to perfection! The meat basically comes right off. I thought it was a small dish but it is quite the opposite. It is a good sized portion. The cheddar grits were so good too. The grits go very well with the pork chops and the taste of the grits was not overpowering. I ate too many appetizers and couldn't finish my pork chops. Very upset with myself. Thankfully, I was able to take it home and enjoy. They still tasted good the next day!The price is not bad for the quality of the food. For two people, a couple of appetizers and one entrée each will definitely be over $100. I would definitely go back again for more pork belly and pork chops! Anyone want to join me?Boom...THAT IS ALL!",5.0
"It was really difficult for me to choose a rating for this place. I'll have to round down to three stars, although due to the food, it's probably closer to 3.5.Foodwise, everything was fantastic. The iron-skillet chicken came out with perfectlly crispy skin and tender meat, and the country chop was juicy and salty and wonderful. However, I was perhaps expecting a slightly larger cut of meat, and felt slightly cheated as a result. The roasted potato side dish was piping hot and full of savory goodness (probably from the duck fat it was cooked in).However, service was disinterested and difficult to come by. On a busy Thursday night, you would have expected them to want to turn over a table more quickly! Instead, we were left waiting for our bill for about 15 minutes after we requested it twice. Prices are also just a tad over what was comfortable to me. If they were just $3-5 lower, I would endeavor to visit this place regularly, good service or not. But as it stands, this will stay on the 'visit once a year' list.",3.0
"Late brunch again with thimble size portionsUpon entering our host gave us a friendly warning that we had 10 minutes to order brunch.  Cool :-D  Our waiter gave us the low down on the specials...

The overall taste was good/fresh and composed well but I just wished for just a little more (by 2"" more) even the toast was lame.  I wouldn't bring this up but compared to the staff meal, they had HUGE/mouth watering stacks of food.

"What just happened!? We live in DUMBO and have loved VHH over the years. Suddenly the food is horrible. The server mentioned a new pastry chef, but there has to be a new chef as well because there is no skill in evidence on the plates. Chewy pasta in a tepid bowl of pasta water; how did that make it out to the table? Even their old signature dishes now disappoint. The chicken liver mousse, once so rich is now bland and chalky. The dessert list from the new chef overplays every bad dessert cliche of the past few years-- wasabi pumpkin seeds on your cake anyone?This horrific meal inspired me to write my first review. So sad my neighborhood joint is over.",1.0
"I went here last night with a large group of people. The place isn't really set up for such a large group, but they made accommodations for us. The ambiance is really great at this restaurant. I was sort of expecting to be on the water since it's down in Dumbo, but you quickly forget because it was so cute. The plates of food I saw while waiting to sit down looked delicious, and I couldn't wait to order. The things I tried were the beets with horseradish, the cheese plate, a special they had of roasted peppers with an egg sauce, the tart, and the sweet corn ravioli with bacon and sage. I really, really enjoyed everything I tried. I will be definitely going back very soon to enjoy more of this place.",5.0

"Two words: Short ribs. My God! I know everyone raves about the chop, but my wife and I had them side by side and the chop paled by comparison. As a whole, everything was excellent. I had the octopus app and wifey had the watermelon salad. Both solid. Then the mains came, and we know who won that battle (see above).  But the okra & zuchini side we got was also pretty killer. And for dessert, the Guinness Chocolate cake with cream cheese frosting wasn't too shabby either. In fact, even our cocktails were quite good. The only nits would be it's location, which is pretty sketchy, it's decor is just eh, and the hostess has a bit of a tude. So, in summary, if I could give half stars, I'd give it 4.5. But since I can't, I have to go with 4. It's fantastic and totally worth the wait, as they don't take reservations, but it ain't 5 stars perfect. At least not yet.",4.0
"A friend recommended Vinegar Hill House, located in the DUMBO (an acronym first used by Seinfeld in a late-night show) section of Brooklyn.It's a great find. The food is superb, although from the outside it is a downtrodden storefront. Inside, it's quaint, cuddly and offbeat.To more important things - the food: it's imaginative, it's inspired, it's well-executed. Of particular interest are the appetizers. I had Manila clams, simmered in a curry flavored butter sauce and served with fried Middle Eastern bread. My hosts had a chicken liver mousse and aragula salad with very thinly sliced kumquats segments. Truly wonderful.The main courses are also accomplished. Their signature dish is a tender, very finely prepared pork chop, served sliced with a bracing sauerkraut. My lady friend enjoyed a rabbit ragu served with papardella. I had the cast iron chicken. It was uniformly cooked with a crspy skin, supported by a vinegary sauce - nothing extraordinary, though. As an observation, there should be a choice vegetables either as part of the entrees or as side dishes.

"Love the ambiance, food, and drinks.  I went on Saturday night with a group of 9, no reservations.  We were told there would be an hour and a half wait but we could wait at the bar or in the back garden.  Our whole group had not arrived yet and we were told by the hostess to inform her when our whole group got there.  The bar was so crowded so we decided to look at the back garden.   Also packed.  Our third option was waiting in front.   The rest of our group arrived and we were sat promptly. Some in the group ordered appetizers, and everyone loved them.  Main courses were ordered and past around the table so everyone could try.  I ordered the Swordfish which was perfect.  My boyfriend ordered the cast iron chicken and a side of beets which were both amazing.  Everyone was pleasantly satisfied.  Desserts were ordered- guiness chocolate cake and the caramel dessert.  Both were amazing.Service was great as well.  Our waitress was very attentive and pleasant.  I may come back in the future if a group is coming, but I don't see it as a place that I would frequent often, mostly because of the location.  I do think that everyone should try it out though because the food is really amazing.",4.0
"I had the privilege of visiting this cute little restaurant on the outskirts of DUMBO and I am so glad my friends introduced me to this place!We strolled in on a Friday night around 11 and the place was packed.  But no matter -- the very nice manager of the restaurant spotted us right away and asked us what we wanted.  We were a party of 4 and he said we could sit at the bar rather than waiting for the table, because there was a wait for a table and the kitchen would probably close before we were seated.So we sat at the bar and had excellent service from the bartender throughout our whole meal.  The menu, when you look at it, is not that large and I wonder if they change it frequently.  What is on the menu, however, is all delish and VERY inexpensive for the quality of food they serve.  Starters and entrees are in the $10-$14 range mostly, and the servings are generous.  We showed up starving, so we asked the bartender for a cheese plate right away.  I could not remember the names of the cheeses, but they were all SO good.  One of them was a very soft, brie-like cheese that had a mellow flavor, another was a soft blue cheese, and the third was sharp and interesting.  The cheeses came with a little salad that had quail egg in it, some salami and some tasty homemade crackers.Next we moved on to the shrimp appetizer, which is basically 3 pieces of fully intact shrimp (head, tail and all) roasted and charred just right.  The shrimp was tender and the sauce was smoky and deliciously rich,  and the head and tail were perfectly crisp.  I haven't ever had shrimp that I thought tasted ""rich"" before, but that's how I would describe this shrimp.  The richness of it was nicely balanced with some kind of white root vegetable that they had shredded to look almost like thin pasta noodles.  So the contrast of rich/smoky and cool/crisp was perfect!For my entree I got the pea ravioli, which was just as amazing.  Pureed peas were wrapped in the tenderest of ravioli shells, with a few random loose peas scattered here and there and a light sprinkling of parmesan.  But the cool thing about this dish was that it had a minty flavor that gave the dish a really fresh, springtime taste, and I couldn't figure out what it was!  The bartender overheard me talking about it and he told me what it was but I forgot.  It was such a nice surprise to taste that subtle mint flavor along with the peas -- it made the dish unique instead of boring, and I found myself intrigued the whole time I ate it.  There was no indication of any mint sauce on the ravioli so I can only assume they used some kind of mint oil or ground up mint leaves with the pureed peas.My friend sitting to my immediate right ordered a very rich, generous portion of roast chicken that came with shallots and was served in the cast iron pan they cooked it in.  They gave so much chicken in that dish, it would have been impossible for one person to finish but it looked perfect for sharing.  Everyone at the table thought it was amazing.For dessert, the friend who introduced us to the place insisted we had to get the Guinness chocolate cake.  We took her advice without question and out came two perfectly fresh, homemade-looking slices of chocolate cake topped with a thick layer of smooth, creamy white cake frosting.  We dug in, and the cake was just right.  The frosting had a very nice thick consistency and was not overly sweet in the least.  The cake was rich without being ""oh this is too much!"" rich and also had a very subtle, sweet flavor.  Just perfect.When it was time to sort out the bill, I gawked.  After ordering a cheese plate, 4 starters, 2 entrees, 2 desserts and a bottle of wine, we ended up paying $40 each . . . WITH tip.  It was amazing to me that we had had so much quality food plus a bottle of wine for that low price.  I felt like I had been treated to an expensive meal without it actually being expensive.So the food and prices are obviously the major selling points at Vinegar Hill House, but the place has more to offer.  Even though it has a modest, casual dining room that's a little on the small side, the overall experience of being there was pleasant and unexpected.  Every staff member in the restaurant works to make sure you have a good experience there, and you feel really welcome.  Everyone from the manager who first greeted us, to the bartender who waited on us, and everyone else that worked there was so friendly and helpful and offered up plenty of information about the food.  And the kicker?  They played Cure records the whole time we were there.  It was that perfect Brooklyn dining experience that you can't find in Manhattan, and worth the trip out to DUMBO.  I will return!",4.0
"Three of us enjoyed our first visit. We got there early - about 6 pm - to avoid the lines and crowds and were immediately seated in the garden area. It was a pleasant spot, although the bugs were biting.We all liked our meals. The presentation is very good and portion sizes are Manhattan sized as opposed to Tom's Diner sized. We didn't feel the prices were too high.The sardine is terrific. The pork chop dish was excellent. The shrimp cocktail was perfect for a summer night. The roasted peppers - can't remember the name - were delicious. The cheese plate with home made crackers was great. By the time we left, the place was packed and very noisy. I'm glad we got there early.I wish the web site would show a current menu. That would be very helpful when trying to decide where to go, as their menu changes depending upon what's fresh, local and available.",4.0
"Went here for a birthday party and had a nice time. We had to wait at least 45 minutes after our party arrived though we had a reservation, so minus 1 star for that.We shared a few entrees and sides. Stand outs included the rabbit pappardelle ragu, which was phenomenal only a little skimpy on the portion size. We also tried the bone marrow ravioli, which was interesting but (surprisingly) a little unimaginative. The marrow-stuffed ravioli were simply served with a beef broth reduction and a few cannelini beans. A little boring. The chop was lovely yet a little fatty. I've had better at Freeman's. Among the sides we had the winter salad, which was okay but had an overpowering curry taste. The squash tart was nice but nothing to write home about. The chicken liver mousse was absolutely phenomenal--smooth and served with perfect little toasts, pickled onions and topped with pistachios. For dessert we had the chocolate cake, which was a bit dry for my taste. The real winner that will keep me coming back is the salted caramel custard. We practically licked the little pot it came in, it was so incredible! As for service, our waitress was nice but not overbearing, and perfectly attentive. It'd be nice if they fixed the wait time problem, but I won't hold my breath.",4.0
"What a gem. A warm, inviting, creative little space on a romantic little unassuming cobblestone street. The menu is wonerfully simple. I could have ordered anything off the menu, as each app/entree looked so well thought out. I ended up getting the wood fired tart (with bacon, anchovy, chard, and creme fraiche) as an app as it seemed like a unique dish. It was really good. I was surprised that with all of those intense ingredients it wasn't more pungent, but it had a very hearty yet delicate flavor. One friend got the pear salad, which they enjoyed, and another got an app portion of the cauliflower ravioli which they raved about. For entree I got the black pepper taliatelle with pork ragu. Fantastic. I've had a lot versions of pork ragu, and they really nail it. Rich, slightly creamy, unctuous. I was also really impressed with the striped bass dish which a friend got. Really crispy skin, moist perfectly cooked flesh, great flavor. Then of course there was the braised short ribs which another friend got, and these were ALL TIME ribs. Amazingly tender, rich, but not too rich, which is often a complaint of mine with braised ribs. For desert we split the pumpkin pie, cheesecake, and cheese platter. I was blown away by the pumpkin pie - one of the best I've ever had. The others were terrific as well.Overall, a really great new spot that I highly recommend taking a date to. Very romantic little spot.",5.0
"My experience at Vinegar Hill House was easily one of the worst experiences I have ever had at a restaurant. My family and I had plans to try out Vinegar Hill House on a Friday night at 6pm when they open. We tried to make a reservation but were told they don't take reservations, so we figured if we showed up right when they opened, it would be fine. So we got there a little early figuring we could grab a drink at their bar or somewhere in the neighborhood. Not the case. We had to wait outside while they and their sister restaurant on the corner got everything ready for service. (If I were running the only two restaurants in this remote area of brooklyn, I think I would want to be making money off of people waiting for dinner and open one of the places at 5:30, but whatever.) While we waited for them to let us in, I literally got 10 mosquito bites in 15 minutes...the place is INFESTED. When they finally opened up, there was one party ahead of us, maybe 5 or 6 people who got sat right away. When we went up and said we were a party of 3, we were told that they could offer outdoor seating, but they were full of reservations for indoor tables. The place was completely empty and the (extremely elitist, pretentious) host had a list with 5 reservations marked down. We told him that we were told that they do not take reservations, but apparently they take reservations for parties of 4 or more. So being a party of 3, we are basically screwed because we can only fit at a 4-top but they refused to grant us a reservation for one. We spoke to the manager to try to show him how silly this logic is and he was just as unaccommodating, so we left. I don't care how cute their decor or good their food! There is no excuse for treating potential customers who were about to spend a good couple hundred bucks at your establishment in such a disrespectful manner. Frankly, I don't know how these people are still in business. There are too many good restaurants in this city to bother wasting your time somewhere where they have zero regard for their clientele. I will never go back to Vinegar Hill House ever, ever again and you can bet that I will tell everyone that I know and work with what my experience of them was.",1.0
"I had a terrific experience here. My friend and I walked down from gold st and were impressed with the decor immediately.

"This is a cute little place on a cute street that is fun to trek to.Our food was good.  Our cocktails were amazing.To start - we had an heirloom tomato tart that was delicious and a watermelon and bean salad that was good (but we got it w/o the pig's head that it came with so perhaps that is why it was a bit less than stellar). I'd definitely go back for that tart!For our entrees - I had the vegetarian pasta and my friend had the chicken.  I loved my pasta.  She loved her chicken.For dessert - we split a lime poundcake with strawberries.  This was the only disappointing part of the meal. It was fine - but the poundcake was dry, they skimped on strawberries, and it was overloaded with whipped cream.  Granted, I'm an experienced baker and have a tendency to pick these things apart, but my dining partner wasn't super impressed either.The drinks - we had some amazing cocktails.  The cocktail menu was a bit obscure for my drinking knowledge, but we ordered based on what we could understand and were quite impressed with our drinks.  Mmm - I want to go back for a cocktail and that darn tomato tart.  Overall - I like the ambience of the place, thought the service was great, and would definitely return to have drinks and dinner (no dessert).",4.0
"A little after 6pm on a Friday night, we were seated right away. We started with the watermelon soup & pork belly. Corn risotto followed, which was tasty & well prepared. For entrees - the chop & cast iron chicken - so flavorful & juicy. We also had a side of grilled beets, which was very unique. The best part was dessert - guiness chocolate cake & salted caramel custard - the latter was one of the best desserts we ever had! Worth the trip!",4.0
"Despite it being located in the middle of nowhere and a walk through a neighborhood that is one part decay and one part gleaming luxury condos, twas all worth it for these four following plates: 1) Pumpkin ravioli (split as an appetizer - I do not recommend as a main plate if you're at all teeny bit hungry). It was so tasty that my friend and I nearly re-ordered it later as dessert. 2) Cast iron chicken: You can't go wrong with this plate that everyone recommends. This statement might sound incredibly foul to all vegans and vegetarians, but the skin was so perfectly crispy! Mmm! 3) Red Wattle Country Chop on a bed of homemade sauerkraut. Slightly on the salty side, but it was still delicious. 4) Guiness chocolate cake: The cream-cheese icing and moist chocolate was a perfect combination.Service was friendly if not unextraordinary. I sat at the bar while waiting for my friend and while I'm sure making a drink (which was very well made) takes concentration, a friendly nod and smile would be appreciated especially when each drink is in the 12 dollar range. I got there at 7:30 and there were plenty of open seats, but by the time we left around 9, it was definitely a busy crowd.",4.0
"Love the ambiance, food, and drinks.  I went on Saturday night with a group of 9, no reservations.  We were told there would be an hour and a half wait but we could wait at the bar or in the back garden.  Our whole group had not arrived yet and we were told by the hostess to inform her when our whole group got there.  The bar was so crowded so we decided to look at the back garden.   Also packed.  Our third option was waiting in front.   The rest of our group arrived and we were sat promptly. Some in the group ordered appetizers, and everyone loved them.  Main courses were ordered and past around the table so everyone could try.  I ordered the Swordfish which was perfect.  My boyfriend ordered the cast iron chicken and a side of beets which were both amazing.  Everyone was pleasantly satisfied.  Desserts were ordered- guiness chocolate cake and the caramel dessert.  Both were amazing.Service was great as well.  Our waitress was very attentive and pleasant.  I may come back in the future if a group is coming, but I don't see it as a place that I would frequent often, mostly because of the location.  I do think that everyone should try it out though because the food is really amazing.",4.0
"I had the privilege of visiting this cute little restaurant on the outskirts of DUMBO and I am so glad my friends introduced me to this place!We strolled in on a Friday night around 11 and the place was packed.  But no matter -- the very nice manager of the restaurant spotted us right away and asked us what we wanted.  We were a party of 4 and he said we could sit at the bar rather than waiting for the table, because there was a wait for a table and the kitchen would probably close before we were seated.So we sat at the bar and had excellent service from the bartender throughout our whole meal.  The menu, when you look at it, is not that large and I wonder if they change it frequently.  What is on the menu, however, is all delish and VERY inexpensive for the quality of food they serve.  Starters and entrees are in the $10-$14 range mostly, and the servings are generous.  We showed up starving, so we asked the bartender for a cheese plate right away.  I could not remember the names of the cheeses, but they were all SO good.  One of them was a very soft, brie-like cheese that had a mellow flavor, another was a soft blue cheese, and the third was sharp and interesting.  The cheeses came with a little salad that had quail egg in it, some salami and some tasty homemade crackers.Next we moved on to the shrimp appetizer, which is basically 3 pieces of fully intact shrimp (head, tail and all) roasted and charred just right.  The shrimp was tender and the sauce was smoky and deliciously rich,  and the head and tail were perfectly crisp.  I haven't ever had shrimp that I thought tasted ""rich"" before, but that's how I would describe this shrimp.  The richness of it was nicely balanced with some kind of white root vegetable that they had shredded to look almost like thin pasta noodles.  So the contrast of rich/smoky and cool/crisp was perfect!For my entree I got the pea ravioli, which was just as amazing.  Pureed peas were wrapped in the tenderest of ravioli shells, with a few random loose peas scattered here and there and a light sprinkling of parmesan.  But the cool thing about this dish was that it had a minty flavor that gave the dish a really fresh, springtime taste, and I couldn't figure out what it was!  The bartender overheard me talking about it and he told me what it was but I forgot.  It was such a nice surprise to taste that subtle mint flavor along with the peas -- it made the dish unique instead of boring, and I found myself intrigued the whole time I ate it.  There was no indication of any mint sauce on the ravioli so I can only assume they used some kind of mint oil or ground up mint leaves with the pureed peas.My friend sitting to my immediate right ordered a very rich, generous portion of roast chicken that came with shallots and was served in the cast iron pan they cooked it in.  They gave so much chicken in that dish, it would have been impossible for one person to finish but it looked perfect for sharing.  Everyone at the table thought it was amazing.For dessert, the friend who introduced us to the place insisted we had to get the Guinness chocolate cake.  We took her advice without question and out came two perfectly fresh, homemade-looking slices of chocolate cake topped with a thick layer of smooth, creamy white cake frosting.  We dug in, and the cake was just right.  The frosting had a very nice thick consistency and was not overly sweet in the least.  The cake was rich without being ""oh this is too much!"" rich and also had a very subtle, sweet flavor.  Just perfect.When it was time to sort out the bill, I gawked.  After ordering a cheese plate, 4 starters, 2 entrees, 2 desserts and a bottle of wine, we ended up paying $40 each . . . WITH tip.  It was amazing to me that we had had so much quality food plus a bottle of wine for that low price.  I felt like I had been treated to an expensive meal without it actually being expensive.So the food and prices are obviously the major selling points at Vinegar Hill House, but the place has more to offer.  Even though it has a modest, casual dining room that's a little on the small side, the overall experience of being there was pleasant and unexpected.  Every staff member in the restaurant works to make sure you have a good experience there, and you feel really welcome.  Everyone from the manager who first greeted us, to the bartender who waited on us, and everyone else that worked there was so friendly and helpful and offered up plenty of information about the food.  And the kicker?  They played Cure records the whole time we were there.  It was that perfect Brooklyn dining experience that you can't find in Manhattan, and worth the trip out to DUMBO.  I will return!",4.0
"Three of us enjoyed our first visit. We got there early - about 6 pm - to avoid the lines and crowds and were immediately seated in the garden area. It was a pleasant spot, although the bugs were biting.We all liked our meals. The presentation is very good and portion sizes are Manhattan sized as opposed to Tom's Diner sized. We didn't feel the prices were too high.The sardine is terrific. The pork chop dish was excellent. The shrimp cocktail was perfect for a summer night. The roasted peppers - can't remember the name - were delicious. The cheese plate with home made crackers was great. By the time we left, the place was packed and very noisy. I'm glad we got there early.I wish the web site would show a current menu. That would be very helpful when trying to decide where to go, as their menu changes depending upon what's fresh, local and available.",4.0
"Went here for a birthday party and had a nice time. We had to wait at least 45 minutes after our party arrived though we had a reservation, so minus 1 star for that.We shared a few entrees and sides. Stand outs included the rabbit pappardelle ragu, which was phenomenal only a little skimpy on the portion size. We also tried the bone marrow ravioli, which was interesting but (surprisingly) a little unimaginative. The marrow-stuffed ravioli were simply served with a beef broth reduction and a few cannelini beans. A little boring. The chop was lovely yet a little fatty. I've had better at Freeman's. Among the sides we had the winter salad, which was okay but had an overpowering curry taste. The squash tart was nice but nothing to write home about. The chicken liver mousse was absolutely phenomenal--smooth and served with perfect little toasts, pickled onions and topped with pistachios. For dessert we had the chocolate cake, which was a bit dry for my taste. The real winner that will keep me coming back is the salted caramel custard. We practically licked the little pot it came in, it was so incredible! As for service, our waitress was nice but not overbearing, and perfectly attentive. It'd be nice if they fixed the wait time problem, but I won't hold my breath.",4.0
"What a gem. A warm, inviting, creative little space on a romantic little unassuming cobblestone street. The menu is wonerfully simple. I could have ordered anything off the menu, as each app/entree looked so well thought out. I ended up getting the wood fired tart (with bacon, anchovy, chard, and creme fraiche) as an app as it seemed like a unique dish. It was really good. I was surprised that with all of those intense ingredients it wasn't more pungent, but it had a very hearty yet delicate flavor. One friend got the pear salad, which they enjoyed, and another got an app portion of the cauliflower ravioli which they raved about. For entree I got the black pepper taliatelle with pork ragu. Fantastic. I've had a lot versions of pork ragu, and they really nail it. Rich, slightly creamy, unctuous. I was also really impressed with the striped bass dish which a friend got. Really crispy skin, moist perfectly cooked flesh, great flavor. Then of course there was the braised short ribs which another friend got, and these were ALL TIME ribs. Amazingly tender, rich, but not too rich, which is often a complaint of mine with braised ribs. For desert we split the pumpkin pie, cheesecake, and cheese platter. I was blown away by the pumpkin pie - one of the best I've ever had. The others were terrific as well.Overall, a really great new spot that I highly recommend taking a date to. Very romantic little spot.",5.0
"My experience at Vinegar Hill House was easily one of the worst experiences I have ever had at a restaurant. My family and I had plans to try out Vinegar Hill House on a Friday night at 6pm when they open. We tried to make a reservation but were told they don't take reservations, so we figured if we showed up right when they opened, it would be fine. So we got there a little early figuring we could grab a drink at their bar or somewhere in the neighborhood. Not the case. We had to wait outside while they and their sister restaurant on the corner got everything ready for service. (If I were running the only two restaurants in this remote area of brooklyn, I think I would want to be making money off of people waiting for dinner and open one of the places at 5:30, but whatever.) While we waited for them to let us in, I literally got 10 mosquito bites in 15 minutes...the place is INFESTED. When they finally opened up, there was one party ahead of us, maybe 5 or 6 people who got sat right away. When we went up and said we were a party of 3, we were told that they could offer outdoor seating, but they were full of reservations for indoor tables. The place was completely empty and the (extremely elitist, pretentious) host had a list with 5 reservations marked down. We told him that we were told that they do not take reservations, but apparently they take reservations for parties of 4 or more. So being a party of 3, we are basically screwed because we can only fit at a 4-top but they refused to grant us a reservation for one. We spoke to the manager to try to show him how silly this logic is and he was just as unaccommodating, so we left. I don't care how cute their decor or good their food! There is no excuse for treating potential customers who were about to spend a good couple hundred bucks at your establishment in such a disrespectful manner. Frankly, I don't know how these people are still in business. There are too many good restaurants in this city to bother wasting your time somewhere where they have zero regard for their clientele. I will never go back to Vinegar Hill House ever, ever again and you can bet that I will tell everyone that I know and work with what my experience of them was.",1.0
"I had a terrific experience here. My friend and I walked down from gold st and were impressed with the decor immediately. The staff was friendly, the food was well made, reasonably priced and the drinks were great. I loved the dismantled organ on the wall, the low lights, and the leaded glass. I wish I could eat here all the time, alas I am from stinky old seattle. :)",5.0
"This is a cute little place on a cute street that is fun to trek to.Our food was good.  Our cocktails were amazing.To start - we had an heirloom tomato tart that was delicious and a watermelon and bean salad that was good (but we got it w/o the pig's head that it came with so perhaps that is why it was a bit less than stellar). I'd definitely go back for that tart!For our entrees - I had the vegetarian pasta and my friend had the chicken.  I loved my pasta.  She loved her chicken.For dessert - we split a lime poundcake with strawberries.  This was the only disappointing part of the meal. It was fine - but the poundcake was dry, they skimped on strawberries, and it was overloaded with whipped cream.  Granted, I'm an experienced baker and have a tendency to pick these things apart, but my dining partner wasn't super impressed either.The drinks - we had some amazing cocktails.  The cocktail menu was a bit obscure for my drinking knowledge, but we ordered based on what we could understand and were quite impressed with our drinks.  Mmm - I want to go back for a cocktail and that darn tomato tart.  Overall - I like the ambience of the place, thought the service was great, and would definitely return to have drinks and dinner (no dessert).",4.0
"A little after 6pm on a Friday night, we were seated right away. We started with the watermelon soup & pork belly. Corn risotto followed, which was tasty & well prepared.

Can we talk about Hillside here?  Why not.  My wife and I have eaten here three times in the last two weeks and I can safely say that the waitress (singular) is why we will never come back.  What a lackluster employee.  Lazy as hell.  Rude.  Slow.  Didn't deserve my 20%+ tips the first two times and the third time was no different so fuck it.  I live around the corner and was hopeful that this was the place we could be regulars??

"Vinegar Hill was really cool.  I liked the atmosphere, the waiters and bartender were really polite and nice, and it was in an interesting part of Brooklyn.  I had the cast iron chicken with the asparagus.  I could have been more daring, but I think that if a place can do something simple really well, then it's a good place.  These dishes were very good - but not great.  Both were very simple preparations, which is fine, and both had very flavorful sauces.  The chicken was a bit dry and the asparagus was a bit ordinary.  I could have made the meal myself, but that's not a totally bad thing.  Overall, I was satisfied, especially because you get a bit of a discount for trekking all the way out in the middle of nowhere Brooklyn this place is.I'd like to come back here and order some more interesting things because I like the vibe.  But if I was served this food in a place that I didn't like as much, I'd think twice.",4.0
"Absolutely precious.With 84 reviews before me, its hard to say anything original.  Went for a late brunch during the absolute torrential downpour last weekend.  The cozy ambiance, friendly service and DELICIOUS food certainly made my day a little more sunny.We ordered four meals and two sides (bacon & sausage) between the three of us because we couldn't decide on anything.... so just chose everything.  I felt like a proper heffer when we ordered, but after everything was served it seemed perfectly portioned. So, as mentioned in previous reviews the portions are not so large.All of our dishes were delicious.  My friend who hates bacon (I know, right?) couldn't keep his paws off my side order it was so yummy. Our pancake with ricotta & banana was sinfully good. Felt more like a decadent dessert than a brunch option.  Was a little strange to see a singular pancake though....am more accustomed to a short stack!Our waiter was spot on with his recommendations, present but not hovering - and overall just a lovely gent.Can't wait to go back for dinner.",4.0
"I set myself up for disaster with this place.  I really did.  I went on Yelp and bypassed the 200-something excellent reviews and only focused on the really bad ones.  I dunno why I did that, but I wouldn't recommend it because I showed up for dinner at Vinegar Hill House early on a Friday night prepared for battle.  As most of the negative reviews here focus on small portions, a rude waitstaff and a terrifyingly smug and indifferent hostess, I wanted to be ready for any or all of the above.That said, my date and I arrived around 6:45 on a Friday evening.  The hostess, who does indeed wear scarily unnecessary painted-on jeans up to her midsection and who does indeed carry an air of I-don't-give-two-shits-what-you-think-of-my-poor-fashion-choices-nor-do-I-care-about-anything-at-all-for-that-matter, greeted us at the door, took our names and said a table would be ready in about 10 minutes (despite the fact that there were a few 4-tops open and another 4-top that could have been broken down into two 2-tops, but I digress).  This was all fine as there were two available seats at the rather small bar and I felt like having a cocktail before dinner anyway.  We sat and the super nice bartender served us up some super tasty drinks in a super friendly manner.  So, for all those negative reviewers out there, they must have gotten rid of the asshole bartender.  Anyway, about 15 minutes later, that 4-top that could become 2 2-tops I'd noticed earlier was broken down and we were seated.  So far, so good.Our waiter was perfectly sane and didn't slack at doing his job in the slightest.  He was also perfectly nice, too.  None of the appetizers on the menu that night sounded very appealing, so my date and I decided to forgo any apps and first-course pastas and opted to order a couple of entrées and a couple of sides to go with our bottle of wine.  I ordered the Red Wattle Country Chop and holy hell.  Just, holy hell.  It comes sliced and most of the pieces were cooked to absolute perfection.  The sauce with the chop was nothing short of amazing but the pièce de résistance was undoubtedly the cheddar grits that comes with the chop.  The grits are to die for.  TO.DIE.FOR.  A couple of the pieces of pork were simply too rare for my liking, but I suppose that's all relative.  On the whole the chop is a win-win and I was satisfied with the portion size.  Full disclaimer, though: The waiter did tell me up front it'd be about 25 minutes for the pork, to which we said, no problem, but could we have some bread in the interim, to which he said, of course.My date ordered the striped bass, which was, admittedly, quite small.  In fact, the table next to us was going to split the striped bass entrée, but when they saw how big my chop was compared to how big the bass was, they snagged the waiter and changed orders.  The bass is more like an appetizer portion, to be honest.   I didn't taste the bass, but my date said that it was decently cooked, although the lime dressing it was drizzled with was slightly off-putting.  We shared the side of mashed potatoes and roasted brussels sprouts.  Do yourself a favor and get those damn potatoes.  They were nearly on par with the cheddar grits that accompanied the chop and reminded me of a warm and creamy potato salad.  I could have eaten 2 more beakers of those taters.  The brussels sprouts were an interesting choice as they didn't really go with either of our meals.  They kind of tasted like sprouts with Chinese five spice or caraway or something.  They just didn't fit, but we ate them anyway because that's how we roll.I was wondering throughout the duration of our meal at Vinegar Hill House when the bloodshed would come and when I would be met with all the truths of the negative reviewers' comments.  I was so prepared to be met with severe disappointment, but it never came.  Vinegar Hill House gets my vote for now.  But here's a tip: don't read only the few-and-far-between bad reviews before you go somewhere, especially Vinegar Hill House.  They didn't get over 200 positive reviews for nothing.",4.0
"Vinegar Hill House takes its name from the quaint cobblestone neighborhood that flourished alongside the East River in the 19th century and has since battled industrialization and development. The first notable restaurant to open shop in this small, sleepy district, is tucked behind the unpainted door of a retired storefront and bookended by windows that fog up like the den of a Dickensian tenement. Chef Jean Adamson, formerly of Freemans, has managed to recreate the atmosphere of her former employer: an intrepid journey to a little known speakeasy hiding on a forgotten New York City street.  (A speakeasy it is not; however, currently, Vinegar Hill House is BYOB as they await a liquor license.)  Diners enter through an unmarked and see a J-shaped bar--first--and, then further, an open kitchen on the left and smallish tables that hug the front walls and the remaining space.  A larger dining table (comprised of 2 or 3 tables) is the furthest any patron could be seated from the door, and it is where my fiancé, a friend and I enjoyed our meal.The whole space is shrouded in yellowed walls and the backbar contains a deconstructed pipe organ that belies the winnowed pathos of unassuming, hipster chic.  A large, stainless steel woodburning (?) oven in the kitchen undercuts that attempt, but details such as a vintage American flag, antique bottles and stainless steel skillets leave their impression.  The space appears, intentionally, to have been resurrected from cruel and thoughtless abandonment, and the menu reads with the clarity of the New England Primer.The New England Primer was an A to Z reader, however.  The brief menu at Vinegar Hill House is just an abbreviation of New American cuisine.  Mussels, winter slaw, crispy chicken with a pan sauce and sides such as sweet potatoes and Brussel sprouts.  Three of us, eating there once were able to circumnavigate the entire menu on our maiden voyage.  A narrow menu is, in my opinion, preferable to those longer tomes that shield diners from their friends, but it also should be an ironclad guarantee of goodness and it ought to unite the staff in singular clarity.  This was not so.While we waited at the bar, the bartender (who opened and poured our wine into charming, tempered glass cups procured from the French school system) explained to us the specials and the cheese and charcuterie boards.  When we were seated, our waiter explained a winter slaw in remarkably different terms than his colleague (and closer to the actual item) but seemed reluctant or uniformed about the meats and cheeses.  As for the food, many dishes were spot on.  A pork chop and rib came on a butcher block and was cooked to temperature perfectly.  The rib meat came of the bone easily and the chopped was splayed out with decorum.  But an appetizer of mussels was stringy and unappealing; the accompanying toast was scorched and insipid (rather than burnt and bitter) and seemed a poor--cheap even--substitute for the fries that make a moules frites so rewarding.  I wished I had settled, instead, for the winter slaw whose proportions of fennel, rutabaga and white cheddar matched the restaurants décor and mood instead of challenging it. The chicken, the much talked about chicken, I should say, was as good as a chicken breast can be, but still chicken and the pan sauce was not easily applied sitting, as it was, beneath the bird on a platter that did not allow for easy dipping.  Everything was quite good, but the most glaring inconsistency was found in the sides and an obligatory pasta dish (aimed, probably, for vegetarians).  A plate of butternut squash ravioli was tasty, but served as an entrée (and listed as one) it seemed remarkably outdone by the similarly priced pork or chicken dishes.  My fiancé, who is not given to such complaints, was keen to remark on the paucity of the serving.  Meanwhile two earthenware ramekins arrived is discordant fashion.  The first was teeming with buttery Brussel sprouts daring each other to spill over.  The second was filled, rather unfilled, with three sad fingerlings of sweet potato, which hid behind the gunwales of the ramekin like timid deckhands in a storm.It is a bit louche to dispute portions when discussing dining, but with the chef working the line these missteps.  As good and affordable as Vinegar Hill House is, it cannot afford such discrepancies.",3.0
"I've never written a Yelp restaurant review, though I eat out at least twice a week. In turn, I usually do not rely on reviews in case they are too subjective or based on factors that have nothing to do with the meal (e.g., the weather, the company, your day at work etc). That being said, I feel the need to comment on our meal at the Vinegar Hill House. This restaurant has a positive, long standing reputation throughout the city and not just Brooklyn. I question whether it's deserved. The food was just fine and the staff was nice. But only just fine. And NOT worth the price given the size of the portions. I do appreciate the farm to table aesthetic that has swept the dining out scene. But go to Redwood Luncheonette in Chelsea instead (I know no one there and have no personal interest in that restaurants success). They do it better and they don't rip you off.",2.0
"I was hoping for better.The decor: A kind of comfort/Americana/crummy ""chic"".  But I don't think they pull it off--it's contrived.  I got tired of looking at the paint drip marks on the wood bench across from me.  Reminded me of my public elementary school days when the City was almost bankrupt. The food:  The menu is short, and I didn't see any entree that appealed to me, so I ended up with two appetizers.  The tart was ok--whatever cheese they are using is very good. The mussels were just ok. My girlfriend had the cod, which was good, but the portion was half of what it should be.The Potatoes Gratin with Celery Root side dish was disappointing and watery.The dessert was uninspired.  We tried the pound cake with fresh grapefruit and creme fraise.  And that's exactly what it was. Just some plain pound cake with a few slices of grapefruit sitting on a dollop of creme fraise. Meh.The Service: Very casual, which is ok with me--our server must have said ""cool"" at least 20 times.  However, during dessert, they brought out a little French Press of coffee, then when the server pushed the plunger down, spilled 1/3 of it on our table and onto the dessert!  No apology!  The server just looked at the French Press like it was defective, took it away and someone else came to wipe off the table.  There were coffee grounds on the dessert and no attempt to provide another. Oddly, the coffee grounds made the plain pound cake taste better. Eureka!I won't be back.  With so many really good true ""artisanal"" ""New American"" ""homey"" places in Brooklyn, there's much better choices.",2.0
"Went here with friends when I happened to be in the neighborhood.  In the same vein as Marlow & Sons, this is a great place for cozy, wintry comfort food.  The downtown-rustic vibe is getting a little overdone these days but I won't hold that against them.  It also is significantly less expensive than this neighborhood and variety of restaurant could get away with charging.The special of the night was a two-person steak dish, so my group of seven ordered four of them, and they were great.  The wine selection is limited but high-quality and inexpensive; the drink menu in the winter consists mostly of hot cider-ish offerings.  Desserts are excellent.  Overall it's an interesting, out-of-the-way sort of place -- so out of the way, in fact, that the staff openly offers to call a car service for patrons who aren't sure if they'll be able to catch cabs.Only gripe: Service is slow.",4.0
"On a snowy, wintry night, boyfriend and I were going to check out a show at St. Ann's warehouse in DUMBO. I had raved about Freeman's before to him so when we heard that Vinegar Hill House had opened up in an old stable house, we were psyched to make a night of it.Firstly, the neighborhood itself is gorgeous- there are a lot of neat nooks and crannies as we stumbled upon the Commander's house and this AWESOME abandoned store/restaurant front. Vinegar Hill House sits in a quiet street, a warm and inviting spot in what was a desolate nighttime We made a terrible mistake of buying twist-off top wine at the local grocery store..it was like Maneschewitz bad. Since they were lacking their liquor license, we went without wine for the meal. We ordered the beet salad (which was good, but a strange choice since we are not super keen on beets), I had the lamb-filled 'popehats' pasta and boyfriend had the roast chicken with a sherry reduction with fingerling potatoes.The appetizer was really a portion for 1- which kinda sucks since they suggested us to share an appetizer. The entrees were on the smaller side-- but my boyfriend's roast chicken did not have the fingerling potatoes listed on the menu. Instead the kitchen had substituted with shallots, without telling us and the server said they had run out of potatoes (which puzzled us since...they had a fingerling tart on the menu?) The chicken reeked of sherry vinegar, which made it nearly impossible for boyfriend to eat and enjoy. The popehats pasta was pretty good, though the lamb filling really did not seem to work. Our server was attentive at first, but post-entree it was pretty hard to get a hold of him since the place had filled up. We decided to forgo dessert and grab a slice elsewhere since we were still starving afterwards and I was actually more satisfied with the slice than my meal (probably coz I was ravenous). I was pretty sad about this experience since I really dig Freeman's and I loved the atmosphere of Vinegar Hill House. Maybe after they've been around for a little while, I might give them another go, but with so many other places...",2.0

"Vinegar Hill was really cool.  I liked the atmosphere, the waiters and bartender were really polite and nice, and it was in an interesting part of Brooklyn.  I had the cast iron chicken with the asparagus.  I could have been more daring, but I think that if a place can do something simple really well, then it's a good place.  These dishes were very good - but not great.  Both were very simple preparations, which is fine, and both had very flavorful sauces.  The chicken was a bit dry and the asparagus was a bit ordinary.  I could have made the meal myself, but that's not a totally bad thing.  Overall, I was satisfied, especially because you get a bit of a discount for trekking all the way out in the middle of nowhere Brooklyn this place is.I'd like to come back here and order some more interesting things because I like the vibe.  But if I was served this food in a place that I didn't like as much, I'd think twice.",4.0
"Absolutely precious.With 84 reviews before me, its hard to say anything original.  Went for a late brunch during the absolute torrential downpour last weekend.  The cozy ambiance, friendly service and DELICIOUS food certainly made my day a little more sunny.We ordered four meals and two sides (bacon & sausage) between the three of us because we couldn't decide on anything.... so just chose everything.  I felt like a proper heffer when we ordered, but after everything was served it seemed perfectly portioned. So, as mentioned in previous reviews the portions are not so large.All of our dishes were delicious.  My friend who hates bacon (I know, right?) couldn't keep his paws off my side order it was so yummy. Our pancake with ricotta & banana was sinfully good. Felt more like a decadent dessert than a brunch option.  Was a little strange to see a singular pancake though....am more accustomed to a short stack!Our waiter was spot on with his recommendations, present but not hovering - and overall just a lovely gent.Can't wait to go back for dinner.",4.0
"I set myself up for disaster with this place.  I really did.  I went on Yelp and bypassed the 200-something excellent reviews and only focused on the really bad ones.  I dunno why I did that, but I wouldn't recommend it because I showed up for dinner at Vinegar Hill House early on a Friday night prepared for battle.  As most of the negative reviews here focus on small portions, a rude waitstaff and a terrifyingly smug and indifferent hostess, I wanted to be ready for any or all of the above.That said, my date and I arrived around 6:45 on a Friday evening.  The hostess, who does indeed wear scarily unnecessary painted-on jeans up to her midsection and who does indeed carry an air of I-don't-give-two-shits-what-you-think-of-my-poor-fashion-choices-nor-do-I-care-about-anything-at-all-for-that-matter, greeted us at the door, took our names and said a table would be ready in about 10 minutes (despite the fact that there were a few 4-tops open and another 4-top that could have been broken down into two 2-tops, but I digress).  This was all fine as there were two available seats at the rather small bar and I felt like having a cocktail before dinner anyway.  We sat and the super nice bartender served us up some super tasty drinks in a super friendly manner.  So, for all those negative reviewers out there, they must have gotten rid of the asshole bartender.  Anyway, about 15 minutes later, that 4-top that could become 2 2-tops I'd noticed earlier was broken down and we were seated.  So far, so good.Our waiter was perfectly sane and didn't slack at doing his job in the slightest.  He was also perfectly nice, too.  None of the appetizers on the menu that night sounded very appealing, so my date and I decided to forgo any apps and first-course pastas and opted to order a couple of entrées and a couple of sides to go with our bottle of wine.  I ordered the Red Wattle Country Chop and holy hell.  Just, holy hell.  It comes sliced and most of the pieces were cooked to absolute perfection.  The sauce with the chop was nothing short of amazing but the pièce de résistance was undoubtedly the cheddar grits that comes with the chop.  The grits are to die for.  TO.DIE.FOR.  A couple of the pieces of pork were simply too rare for my liking, but I suppose that's all relative.  On the whole the chop is a win-win and I was satisfied with the portion size.  Full disclaimer, though: The waiter did tell me up front it'd be about 25 minutes for the pork, to which we said, no problem, but could we have some bread in the interim, to which he said, of course.My date ordered the striped bass, which was, admittedly, quite small.  In fact, the table next to us was going to split the striped bass entrée, but when they saw how big my chop was compared to how big the bass was, they snagged the waiter and changed orders.  The bass is more like an appetizer portion, to be honest.   I didn't taste the bass, but my date said that it was decently cooked, although the lime dressing it was drizzled with was slightly off-putting.  We shared the side of mashed potatoes and roasted brussels sprouts.  Do yourself a favor and get those damn potatoes.  They were nearly on par with the cheddar grits that accompanied the chop and reminded me of a warm and creamy potato salad.  I could have eaten 2 more beakers of those taters.  The brussels sprouts were an interesting choice as they didn't really go with either of our meals.  They kind of tasted like sprouts with Chinese five spice or caraway or something.  They just didn't fit, but we ate them anyway because that's how we roll.I was wondering throughout the duration of our meal at Vinegar Hill House when the bloodshed would come and when I would be met with all the truths of the negative reviewers' comments.  I was so prepared to be met with severe disappointment, but it never came.  Vinegar Hill House gets my vote for now.  But here's a tip: don't read only the few-and-far-between bad reviews before you go somewhere, especially Vinegar Hill House.  They didn't get over 200 positive reviews for nothing.",4.0
"Vinegar Hill House takes its name from the quaint cobblestone neighborhood that flourished alongside the East River in the 19th century and has since battled industrialization and development. The first notable restaurant to open shop in this small, sleepy district, is tucked behind the unpainted door of a retired storefront and bookended by windows that fog up like the den of a Dickensian tenement. Chef Jean Adamson, formerly of Freemans, has managed to recreate the atmosphere of her former employer: an intrepid journey to a little known speakeasy hiding on a forgotten New York City street.  (A speakeasy it is not; however, currently, Vinegar Hill House is BYOB as they await a liquor license.)  Diners enter through an unmarked and see a J-shaped bar--first--and, then further, an open kitchen on the left and smallish tables that hug the front walls and the remaining space.  A larger dining table (comprised of 2 or 3 tables) is the furthest any patron could be seated from the door, and it is where my fiancé, a friend and I enjoyed our meal.The whole space is shrouded in yellowed walls and the backbar contains a deconstructed pipe organ that belies the winnowed pathos of unassuming, hipster chic.  A large, stainless steel woodburning (?) oven in the kitchen undercuts that attempt, but details such as a vintage American flag, antique bottles and stainless steel skillets leave their impression.  The space appears, intentionally, to have been resurrected from cruel and thoughtless abandonment, and the menu reads with the clarity of the New England Primer.The New England Primer was an A to Z reader, however.  The brief menu at Vinegar Hill House is just an abbreviation of New American cuisine.  Mussels, winter slaw, crispy chicken with a pan sauce and sides such as sweet potatoes and Brussel sprouts.  Three of us, eating there once were able to circumnavigate the entire menu on our maiden voyage.  A narrow menu is, in my opinion, preferable to those longer tomes that shield diners from their friends, but it also should be an ironclad guarantee of goodness and it ought to unite the staff in singular clarity.  This was not so.While we waited at the bar, the bartender (who opened and poured our wine into charming, tempered glass cups procured from the French school system) explained to us the specials and the cheese and charcuterie boards.  When we were seated, our waiter explained a winter slaw in remarkably different terms than his colleague (and closer to the actual item) but seemed reluctant or uniformed about the meats and cheeses.  As for the food, many dishes were spot on.  A pork chop and rib came on a butcher block and was cooked to temperature perfectly.  The rib meat came of the bone easily and the chopped was splayed out with decorum.  But an appetizer of mussels was stringy and unappealing; the accompanying toast was scorched and insipid (rather than burnt and bitter) and seemed a poor--cheap even--substitute for the fries that make a moules frites so rewarding.  I wished I had settled, instead, for the winter slaw whose proportions of fennel, rutabaga and white cheddar matched the restaurants décor and mood instead of challenging it. The chicken, the much talked about chicken, I should say, was as good as a chicken breast can be, but still chicken and the pan sauce was not easily applied sitting, as it was, beneath the bird on a platter that did not allow for easy dipping.  Everything was quite good, but the most glaring inconsistency was found in the sides and an obligatory pasta dish (aimed, probably, for vegetarians).  A plate of butternut squash ravioli was tasty, but served as an entrée (and listed as one) it seemed remarkably outdone by the similarly priced pork or chicken dishes.  My fiancé, who is not given to such complaints, was keen to remark on the paucity of the serving.  Meanwhile two earthenware ramekins arrived is discordant fashion.  The first was teeming with buttery Brussel sprouts daring each other to spill over.  The second was filled, rather unfilled, with three sad fingerlings of sweet potato, which hid behind the gunwales of the ramekin like timid deckhands in a storm.It is a bit louche to dispute portions when discussing dining, but with the chef working the line these missteps.  As good and affordable as Vinegar Hill House is, it cannot afford such discrepancies.",3.0
"I've never written a Yelp restaurant review, though I eat out at least twice a week. In turn, I usually do not rely on reviews in case they are too subjective or based on factors that have nothing to do with the meal (e.g., the weather, the company, your day at work etc). That being said, I feel the need to comment on our meal at the Vinegar Hill House. This restaurant has a positive, long standing reputation throughout the city and not just Brooklyn. I question whether it's deserved. The food was just fine and the staff was nice. But only just fine. And NOT worth the price given the size of the portions. I do appreciate the farm to table aesthetic that has swept the dining out scene. But go to Redwood Luncheonette in Chelsea instead (I know no one there and have no personal interest in that restaurants success). They do it better and they don't rip you off.",2.0
"I was hoping for better.The decor: A kind of comfort/Americana/crummy ""chic"".  But I don't think they pull it off--it's contrived.  I got tired of looking at the paint drip marks on the wood bench across from me.  Reminded me of my public elementary school days when the City was almost bankrupt. The food:  The menu is short, and I didn't see any entree that appealed to me, so I ended up with two appetizers.  The tart was ok--whatever cheese they are using is very good. The mussels were just ok. My girlfriend had the cod, which was good, but the portion was half of what it should be.The Potatoes Gratin with Celery Root side dish was disappointing and watery.The dessert was uninspired.  We tried the pound cake with fresh grapefruit and creme fraise.  And that's exactly what it was. Just some plain pound cake with a few slices of grapefruit sitting on a dollop of creme fraise. Meh.The Service: Very casual, which is ok with me--our server must have said ""cool"" at least 20 times.  However, during dessert, they brought out a little French Press of coffee, then when the server pushed the plunger down, spilled 1/3 of it on our table and onto the dessert!  No apology!  The server just looked at the French Press like it was defective, took it away and someone else came to wipe off the table.  There were coffee grounds on the dessert and no attempt to provide another. Oddly, the coffee grounds made the plain pound cake taste better. Eureka!I won't be back.  With so many really good true ""artisanal"" ""New American"" ""homey"" places in Brooklyn, there's much better choices.",2.0
"Went here with friends when I happened to be in the neighborhood.  In the same vein as Marlow & Sons, this is a great place for cozy, wintry comfort food.  The downtown-rustic vibe is getting a little overdone these days but I won't hold that against them.  It also is significantly less expensive than this neighborhood and variety of restaurant could get away with charging.The special of the night was a two-person steak dish, so my group of seven ordered four of them, and they were great.  The wine selection is limited but high-quality and inexpensive; the drink menu in the winter consists mostly of hot cider-ish offerings.  Desserts are excellent.  Overall it's an interesting, out-of-the-way sort of place -- so out of the way, in fact, that the staff openly offers to call a car service for patrons who aren't sure if they'll be able to catch cabs.Only gripe: Service is slow.",4.0
"On a snowy, wintry night, boyfriend and I were going to check out a show at St. Ann's warehouse in DUMBO. I had raved about Freeman's before to him so when we heard that Vinegar Hill House had opened up in an old stable house, we were psyched to make a night of it.Firstly, the neighborhood itself is gorgeous- there are a lot of neat nooks and crannies as we stumbled upon the Commander's house and this AWESOME abandoned store/restaurant front. Vinegar Hill House sits in a quiet street, a warm and inviting spot in what was a desolate nighttime We made a terrible mistake of buying twist-off top wine at the local grocery store..it was like Maneschewitz bad. Since they were lacking their liquor license, we went without wine for the meal. We ordered the beet salad (which was good, but a strange choice since we are not super keen on beets), I had the lamb-filled 'popehats' pasta and boyfriend had the roast chicken with a sherry reduction with fingerling potatoes.The appetizer was really a portion for 1- which kinda sucks since they suggested us to share an appetizer. The entrees were on the smaller side-- but my boyfriend's roast chicken did not have the fingerling potatoes listed on the menu. Instead the kitchen had substituted with shallots, without telling us and the server said they had run out of potatoes (which puzzled us since...they had a fingerling tart on the menu?) The chicken reeked of sherry vinegar, which made it nearly impossible for boyfriend to eat and enjoy. The popehats pasta was pretty good, though the lamb filling really did not seem to work. Our server was attentive at first, but post-entree it was pretty hard to get a hold of him since the place had filled up. We decided to forgo dessert and grab a slice elsewhere since we were still starving afterwards and I was actually more satisfied with the slice than my meal (probably coz I was ravenous). I was pretty sad about this experience since I really dig Freeman's and I loved the atmosphere of Vinegar Hill House. Maybe after they've been around for a little while, I might give them another go, but with so many other places...",2.0
"I feel very torn about this place.  My boyfriend and I arrived at around 10pm on a Saturday night.  It was still very busy, but the hostess promptly took our name, we got a drink at the bar, and we were seated in no time.  The decor is fun to look at, and I like that the restaurant is in a random little neighborhood.  Our waiter was very nice, and very helpful.  We got a cheese and pate plate that was very tasty.  So far, five stars.  For entrees my boyfriend got their famous cast iron chicken, and I got the pork chop.  The chicken definitely lived up to it's hype--the juiciest I have ever, ever had.  So fantastic.  We also got some brussels sprouts with hazelnuts (I think) which were addictive.  However, my porkchop was pretty much inedible.  The flavoring was great but the chop itself was so fatty.  It was just...gross.  There was barely any part of it that I could sort through to enjoy.  I guess I could have sent it back, but I kept feeling hopeful that the next part of it would be fine since the flavor was so good.  There are definitely some good things happening here.  I think the chef used to work at Freeman's and Vinegar Hill House is definitely less annoying and the food is way better.  I'm just not sure whether a trip back is worth the risk.",3.0

"Wait time + Service: On a Saturday night, we waited 25 minutes for a table for 2. There was a bit of waiting for the server to take our order and then a bit more waiting to get a glass of wine, but it was a busy night at VHH as usual and we weren't in such a huge hurry.Food: For starters, we got the Chicken Liver Mousse with vinegar onions and pistachios. In addition, there was a small handful of fresh greens drizzled with horseradish sauce, and there were three 1-inch thick chunks of toast. The crust of the toast was on the slightly burnt and inedible side. The flavor of the liver was complemented well by the onions. The layer of pistachios on top made it texturally more interesting but might've put the flavor off balance. It left me yearning for a slice of red onion or bosc pear even.For our main entrees, we ordered the Whole German Brown Trout with carrots and cumin, and the Red Wattle Country Chop with fingerling potatoes, crème fraîche and dill. Maybe the menu writer hadn't thought of this at the time (just as I hadn't until my husband laughingly pointed this out) but the term ""brown trout"" is slang for something pretty unsavory, something more likely found in toilet bowls than on dinner plates. Nevertheless, we ordered it and savored it! The fish was de-boned, the flesh was firm, the taste was mostly buttery, and we detected a little mint in there as well.The chop was very juicy and flavorful, surprising to me given that the meat comes from a heritage breed of pig that used to be passed over for other breeds that had higher fat/lard content. Of the dishes we ordered, the red wattle chop is definitely a meal to come back for next time.",4.0

"Vinegar Hill House is a destination worth the trip.  The restaurant, which makes full use of its limited space, does not throw you onto someone's table or push you up against the bar as soon as you enter.  Instead a single aisle divides the front of the space which is the main dining area.  Turns out, this place is aptly named, as it feels much more like a house than your run of the mill Brooklyn restaurant.  Seating at the tables might be tight, but you are not lost in a massive crowd so much as one part of the team that is your corner of the restaurant.  I dig camaraderie and it seems you can find it here.

"I went last night with a new-ish friend.  I liked the food, she didn't (more on that below).  We arrived around 10:30 and so we got seated right away (the bar area was fairly crowded).  The service was friendly.Atmosphere:  homey, a bit rundown (I wish they would fix the decor/paint just a little as it comes across as a bit ""dirty""; thankfully, the bathroom is the nicest place in here).   Scene:  We played a game of ""guess how many people in here are wearing black-rimmed hipster glasses"".  It was about 1/3 of the people in the room.  While we were playing, a foursome came in, 2 wearing black-rimmed glasses.  Funny.  ;-)   We had been joking with the waiter about how I got the ""little girl glass"" for wine (it was just a teeny-tiny bowl with no stem - like what you would put a tee light into).  I asked him for a regular wine glass (which I spied on another table and he forgot and brought me another ""tee light wine glass"".  I said, kiddingly, ""You said you would bring me an adult wine glass.""  The guy to my right at the next table, froze in mid-water pour to stare at me.  The female across from him looked at me in disgust.  I laughed.  The waiter thought it was funny.  However, I was now the ""hated, non-hipster wench"". Yes, people, you may be jugded and looked down upon here so watch what you wear and what you say lest you be thought of as ""the man"". Service:  Our waiter was friendly.  We joked with him (see above) and he was cool with that.  The busboy (who was wearing black-rimmed hipster glasses) whom my friend asked if he could change the (thrash) music, went over to change it immediately to something more dinner- and conversation-friendly.Food:  We split the Shaved Market Salad ($9) which I really liked and so did my friend.  We both thought the dressing (and the salad) was really light and fresh.  I got the Cast-Iron Chicken ($15).  I liked it but thought the sauce was a little too tart/lemon-y.  I also thought it was a little overpriced as it comes a la carte (you have to order sides, separately).  I ordered the squash ($8) as a side.  My friend ordered the octupus and was unimpressed.Overall:   Though I thought it was overpriced and the food could be a bit better, I would go again.  My friend wouldn't.  The staff is friendly; (the attitude comes from the patrons).  The streets were deserted when we came and deserted when we left (after midnight).  I would be careful walking back to the F train.",3.0
"Service is everything in the restaurant business, and unfortunately this place has terrible service. We arrived around 1:30 ish on a Sunday and waited almost an hour for seating. When we finally sat down, and ordered, we waited another 40 minutes for; tacos, poached eggs, fried oysters, and a hot dog. We also had 4 alcoholic beverages. The food was OK. And for a bill of 120 dollars for simple food, that could have been bested by anyone who can make a PB & J, the joke was on us. This was our first and last time here at the hill. I gave this place one star because the place had a nice vibe, and that was it. I don't mind paying big money for exceptional food, but this was just terrible. If  this was my business, I would focus more on the customers for repeat business, and serve food that is on par with the price.",1.0
"I'd give this place three and a half stars if I could.I was there on 12/17 around 8:30.  The wait was about 45 minutes for a table, but my date and I snuck in a bit quicker by sitting at the bar for dinner.  Which was fine by me, because a) the bar was decorated tastefully for Christmas, b) I got a great view of the tight, well-organized kitchen, and c) I could actually hear my date as I was sitting next to him, which would have been a bit difficult with a table between us.  This place is charming, intimate, and a bit romantic without being cloying, but it is certainly not quiet.The place is BYOB, for now I guess.I wish I had taken better note of the menu, but I can say the food was very good but not great.  We had a free-form tart with vegetables and cow's milk cheese to start.  As other Yelpers have mentioned, it was very under-seasoned.  I actually second-guessed my opinion while I was eating it and assumed I got a few subpar bites-- but now that I read the reviews I see it is a common complaint.  For the entree, I had a beautiful fillet of white fish (trout?) with smoked bacon and aioli.  It was delicious; no under-seasoning here, thanks largely to the thick smoky slab of bacon.  My only complaint was that the bacon was so charred it was difficult to cut through in parts, but otherwise a very simple and satisfying dish.  My friend had braised short ribs, I believe-- three gigantic specimens piled on a plate.   He devoured every morsel before I even finished my fish, so I think those must get two thumbs up.I can see this place having a great deal of potential.  I would certainly like to try it again in a few months.  Bring a good bottle of wine and a little patience to the door (and perhaps a salt shaker), and you should have a pleasant experience.",3.0
"Best. Dinner. Ever. My boyfriend surprised me and took me to dinner here and it was amazing.I never order the chicken, but was feeling indecisive, so I gave it a try. I've been craving it ever since. The decor is cute and our waiter was helpful. We had to wait to be seated and went to the bar to get a drink. That was the one problem. It took me 30 minutes to get a drink. It's one bartender and she's very busy. But the food was soooo good, it made up for it.",4.0

"quite lovely-- homey bistro-ish food (creative, mixed influences), not wayyyy expensive (about $30-40 a person w/ glass of wine, dessert).  You feel like you're in a different world, maybe Paris, with the rustic-renovated decor and big window on a quiet cobblestoned side street.  Though it fills up FAST-- we got there right as it opened at 6 (pre-St. Ann's Warehouse show) and there was quite a wait by the time we left.My friend had the roast chicken and it was seriously out of this world. Sweet pea ravioli was small and simple but good on my side.  If you're feeling nutty they have (or at least when I was there) an $80 home-aged steak, definitely enough for 3 if not 4 people.  Someone near us had it and it looked like a nice special occasion kind of thing.Dessert (caramel custard) was probably more than I needed, but still delish.Service was a little odd-- waify nervous lady with unintelligible voice-- but probably just an off-moment.",4.0
"Located in the middle of nowhere, in the neighborhood immediately east of DUMBO, is a gem of a restaurant. The space is reminiscent of a cabin in the country. Food is also top notch. Duck liver mousse is a great starter. In terms of entrees, the chicken is easily one of the best around. It's a must order (and i never order chicken at a restaurant). The pork chop is also awesome. Huge portion. They're definitely not shy in terms of cooking it closer to medium rare. I wish more places would do that. If you like salty desserts get the salted caramel custard. Awesome. Wait times can stretch to an hour during peak times so grab a drink at the bar. It'll be worth it.",4.0
"Went here on a whim, since I happened to be in the area when late afternoon rolled around. Upsides, and some downsides...Downside: First impressions are key... I was kinda annoyed they made me wait until 5:30 to enter the place (I arrived at 5pm) -- I mean, I could have sat at the bar and at least would have been inside. Instead, I sat outside and waited. Then they didn't even let me (or anyone else) know when it was OKAY to come in. Thumbs down. That was kinda the trend as far as service goes, which other folks have mentioned on here. It's blase, and keeps in line with the ""we're so cool, we just don't even care"" / hipster thing. Upside: All else aside, the food was really solid. Started with something very new for me, a special seafood app - anchovy (!?) on top of toast w/ olive oil, fresh cherry tomatoes, basil. Really a knockout, and adventurous for me. Glad I went with the waiter's recommendation on that one.Then onto the braised short rib which was so tender and delicious. Also had the fresh tomatoes and I couldn't get enough of them. A tiny bit of blue cheese added just a hint of something else that made this dish something I'd come back for -- except with such an interesting menu that changes frequently, I would probably try something else next time. But, the downside: Hitachino White Ale was $9 for a less than 12 oz. bottle. Seriously? I suppose a total meal of $50 was more or less reasonable for a beer, appetizer and main dish.Then again, an upside: The outdoor patio in the back looks so picturesque, it just might break your camera lens. Overall impression: This is a restaurant for the ""too cool"" class of hipster, but then again this type of Broklynites love its farm fresh produce... the use of only the freshest vegetables is going to set this place apart. I also have a feeling your food will be better if you eat earlier in the evening, since you'd be more likely to get fresher ingredients. The decor is great for a place like this... very old and homey, and I'm sure warm/cozy in the wintertime -- it all works... the food, the atmosphere, the decor, the neighborhood. And the soundtrack: David Byrne & Elliot Smith? Eh... gotta love the hipsters. BYOB = bring your own bicycle.",4.0
"What a disappointment!!! After frequenting this place for the last 3 years and considering it to be one of the best Brooklyn-style restaurants, my last visit to this place was a complete disaster. First, I ordered what used to be my favorite chicken liver mouse. Right away I could see just by the color and the texture that it was different, and the portion was smaller. And sure enough, it also tasted blend. For the main course I order their new variation on baked chicken. What they brought me looked like a take out order from Chinese restaurant. Two small barely warm pieces of chicken with a piece of lettuce and 3 small potatoes for $23. Those of you who remember their original skillet oven baked half-chicken would be horrified at that dish. It didn't look appetizing and tasted just like Pudgie's Famous Chicken. My wife had a lobster pasta that was just plain insulting. The pasta was store-bought (yes, we even asked them and they told us as a matter of fact that pasta is not home-made). So, store-bought pasta with what tasted like out-of-the-can souse for $16? I can understand mistakes in cooking, but these just show complete disregard for the customers and the food itself. And looking at the number of negative reviews, there is only one conclusion to be made - this place is going down the drain. Too bad, it used to be a real gem in that neighborhood.",1.0

However, when we asked the waitress how long the wait would be, she barely looked at us and spit out ""two-and-a-half hours"" - in a very rude way and with this ""how-do-you-even-dare-to-ask"" attitude! The restaurant may have great food, but the service seems to be horrible (confirming what other reviewers said). It's taken off our list - luckily, there are lots of other great restaurants in the city where they appreciate your business and you are treated nicely.",1.0

"Cozy and charming faux farmhouse setting with exceptional food and attention to detail.  We sat in the small wooden dining room downstairs next to a roaring fire.  For appetizers, the salads were fantastic - complex and interesting.  We also really enjoyed the pork chop and the black pepper linguine.  Our waiter was quite helpful and described our options with great enthusiasm and knowledge.The only blemish to the evening was the bartender who - despite some pretty cool tattoos - can best be described as ""not a people person"".  Eye contact and friendliness might work in your favor, buddy.",5.0
"Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Good ideas, amateur execution. Small portions served starkly. Linguini seafood special tasted like 25 cent creamy chicken ramen. Finished it in 3 bites. Chicken was ok, but it's really hard to fuck up chicken. Won't even discuss the appetizer, but let's just say that after I tasted it I thought to myself, ""oh, man I wish we hadn't ordered entrees too. now we have to sit through a whole meal.""  I'm hard on places that have a lot of hype.  Would knock off a star if there had been any sort of wait, but we got there 15 minutes before opening.Service was fine, but yeah, totally not worth it. Oh, and I am still hungry but in too bad a mood to eat more.",2.0
"I kind of want to give this place 4 stars just because it's so good that it makes me feel like I'm making an obvious point by saying so.But it really is so good.  I've only been here once, for brunch, but my friends and I had been curious about it for months.  The first time we passed by it our interest was instantly piqued, and we had eyed it and wondered about it ever since.I never go out to brunch because it makes me feel like I have let myself go, in the worst way possible.  If you are a brunch addict, I am judging you, but only just a little bit.  I know deep down that only you can answer for your own actions.  But anyway, this one particularly beautiful day, one of the last days of summer, three of my closest friends and I had had a sleepover and we knew that today was the day we'd check out Vinegar Hill House. Everything was amazing, quite possibly the best food I have ever had at a restaurant and paid for.  Not only was everything perfectly, deliciously prepared, but the combination of ingredients in all of our dishes perfectly, deliciously satisfied us.The service fine, but I wished we had been seated in another section - I noticed there was a server who was being way more friendly and gracious with his section than ours was.  Again, it's not like our server wasn't decent, but she was kinda stiff the whole time despite how easy and nice we all are.  Oh well, the food was so good that it almost made me want to have brunch again.  I'll be back to try dinner.",5.0

"4.5 stars for VHH if I was allowed.  Great experience.  Went here with a friend and started off with the duck liver mousse and an oyster special.  The mousse was spectacular, definitely get it.  However, the oysters were hit a little heavy-handed with what seemed to be chipotle.  I love heat, but it was a bit too overwhelming for the oysters.  They were still very good though.  For entrees we got the red waddle country chop (pork) and the pork bolognese pasta. The pork entree must be one of the best things I've eaten and I'm never blown away by pork dishes.  The pasta special was good but not up to par with some of the other things we had.  For dessert you have to get the carmel custard.  I got the creamsicle cheesecake which was good, but the carmel was just ridiculously amazing.Don't miss stopping by here if you haven't already.  Definitely one of the best places I've been to since I moved to the city a few years ago.",4.0

VHH had been on my wish list forever even though I am a big borough snob and rarely leave Manhattan... but to be honest, think maybe just was overhyped as I thought it was good but not amazing or worth the trek out there.  Our server kept forgetting what we had ordered or whethger he had taken our order so that didn't help... but I know service can be a crapshoot.  I would try again for dinner, but only if I happen to be in area... I wouldn't make it my destination per se.",3.0
"My brother treated me to a birthday dinner here so I can't speak of the prices, but I've certainly no complaints about the food. As per usual with me and my food-envy I probably enjoyed everyone else's order more than my own (fresh linguine special; good but definitely last among the five entrees). The tilefish was real nice, but the cast iron chicken and the Red Wattle Country Chop were probably tied for Most Delicious; the former because it was really fucking good--super juicy, not to mention a hell of a serving--and the latter because it's so much goddamn fun to say even though I have no idea what it means. (It turns out to be pork chops on top of jalapeno cheese grits--not too spicy at all, just a mild kick. Super tasty combo.) I can kiiiiinda see the complaints about serving sizes here--kinda--but if you come here and make that criticism, I'm just saying, it's likely that you could stand to lose some weight. I know I felt overly full by the end, though awesome desserts (bay leaf custard and Guinness chocolate cake) of course helped. My other brother noted, and I agree, that Vinegar Hill House would probably provide a more enjoyable winter meal than a summer one, not least because it could've definitely stood to be far, far more air conditioned, unless you were seated in just the right spot(s), where it was practically arctic. (Unfortunately, I was just a foot off from one of these sweet spots, and didn't realize it until after the meal was over.) It's also got a very homey, rustic thing going on that seems like it would be quite comforting on a blustery day. Then again, trekking here through snow and such must not be very much fun either, because yeah, this place is pretty out of the way, although clearly if you're coming here you know to expect that. Still, it is pretty far, and I am super lazy, so delicious as it is, I probably won't come by here very often.

Had my friend ordered the Red Wattle and cheddar grits, I might have passed out, but we did go with a couple of heavier items. Both sides, Brussell spouts with Black beer, and Sour cream smashed potatoes could have been my entree. It was unbelievably tasty and I wanted to drink my potatoes. For the 1st course we shared a clam pie, which, by the way is exactly that, a cute small pie, with clams and potato in a creamy gravy, you must have that if you go. everyone around us agreed and got it too, and you could see smiley faces everywhere!Our main entrees were, Bucatini with ramps and breadcrumbs, and Beef CheekBoth were the perfect portion, and both were cooked to perfection. The pasta, al dente, fresh and homemade, and the beef cheek like a melt in your mouth short rib without the bone. I will get it again and again and again.Finally for our last course, Salted Caramel Creme with Coconut cookies. SWEET, SALTY and DELICIOUS.

"I've lived around the corner from Vinegar Hill for about 8 months now, but haven't gone until today since the wait is always 1.5 hours.  I'm not sure that has any significant meaning to communicate to the owners in terms of potential consumers lost, since they always have a line out the door (literally), but it is something worth communicating to potential eaters: there is ALWAYS a line.  Take note.B and I thought of going early tonight to beat the crowd.  They open at 6 and we were there by 6:20... and they already had an hour and a half wait. How is that even possible?Good thing we have a ""bar"" (aka our apartment) around the corner to wait at... because there is literally NOTHING else in the neighborhood.We sat down for dinner at about 8.  Based on the recommendations here, we ordered the octopus salad, cast iron chicken and pork chop. We also got the apple and cheddar salad and a side of brussel sprouts (since the $17 chicken gets you chicken... and nothing else).  Verdict: the octopus salad was good, the seasoning was lovely.... but the octopus was slightly overcooked and a bit chewy.  Not too chewy, and it was good... but not perfect.  The apple and cheddar salad was delicious... the grainy mustard dressing was a perfect complement and it was a perfect fall salad.  The chicken, despite its rave reviews here, was fine, but FAR from special.  It's chicken people.  Just chicken.  Nothing else.  That's it.  In fact, mine was under cooked (raw in the middle).  I sliced it and put it against the super hot cast iron skillet to sear it a bit... but really? You served me $17 chicken and it was raw?All was forgiven, though, for the pork chop.  Sweet Jesus, it was divine.  Frank Bruni said this was the best pork chop he'd ever had and I'd have to agree.  It was really, really special. Served with cheddar jalapeno grits, it was just really stupendous.  Forget the chicken and get this.My regret: I should have gotten the short rib instead of the chicken.  Take note, people.Oh, and the guinness chocolate cake IS all it's cracked up to be.  Leave room.Final recommendation: go on a weekday instead of the weekend.  An hour and a half wait for two at 6:20 (when we left at 8pm it was closer to an hour forty five) is too long a wait for any restaurant.  As the couple who left when they heard the new said, ""An hour and a half isn't a wait...

"Adventure Monday continues! Luckily, the three of us got seats right away but there was only one table left on a Monday night around 8PM (they only take reservations for parties of more than 4). I've wanted to try the Cast-Iron Chicken and Guiness Cake at Vinegar Hill House for the longest time but haven't been able to due to its isolated location. We started with an appetizer special of the day: Pork Belly, which was good (Pita bread, greek yogurt, baby arugula, red-skin potatoes, pork belly). The chicken was tasty too (a la carte with onions) but the best dish of the night was the Red Wattle Country Chop (with cheese grits). They were delicious! Best pork chops we've ever had. The Striped Bass was good as well but nothing special there. The Guiness cake for dessert was perfect. Definitely want to take my bf back to try the chops. Side note: The portions are perfect for one so if you have a ravenous appetite, order more appetizers/sides/desserts (which was why we were able to go to another dessert spot afterward, which worked out for us). Also noticed many lingering over dessert and coffee so the vibe here is every laid back and intimate.",5.0
"Not to disagree but just to maybe state personal experience, I didn't think this place was expensive for what you got. The drinks at the bar (their strength IMHO) were $9 when you would have paid $12 - $14 in Manhattan. On top of that, the wine selection is notably inexpensive. I think the priciest bottle I saw was $54 and the one I got for $29 was perfectly good for that range.Take some time out of your day to get the pork chop here. I would say its the best pork chop I've eaten in the greater NYC area. I would put the one at Little Owl as a close second but still, this was the best. You could argue its a bit different because its in a light (and fantastic) sauce whereas the one at LO is really just all about the natural flavor of the pork but either way, its piggy heaven over here. Also want to second all the positive comments around the chicken mousse. I was kind of thinking, since it was chicken liver, that I was going to sate some of the old Jewish roots but it really didn't do that. Its just a completely different thing - the bread served with it is outstanding and the sweet onions are off the charts.One downside - the service isn't fantastic. Specifically the bartender had this whole 'cool' thing going wherein it seemed like he could hear anything and then just give you that slight head nod of confidence like ""I gotcha, no worries"" when in reality it seemed to mean, ""I don't care all that much - you may or may not get your drink"". Not the end of the world but could have been better. Table service was a bit better but just don't go there with your whole 'Manhattan impatience' thing (which I have a serious dose of). Relax and enjoy the evening. They're not in a hurry and nothing you do is going to change that.Back patio also a plus. I will return... 4.5 stars really.",4.0
"We went to Vinegar Hill House last Friday night. We waited, and this is not an exaggeration, 2 hours and 10 minutes for a table (shame on us, really-- but the host/owner kept telling us that it would only be another 1/2 hour, and after an hour of waiting already, we felt like we couldn't leave!)Once we were finally seated, we were ignored for another 20 minutes. Among the many items we ordered off the menu, the mussels were raw, and the chicken (which NY mag RAVED about) was totally dry- and served by itself with a single roasted shallot. Our food came to $94. And we were not comped anything from the bill, nor did the waitstaff apologize or even say goodbye when we were leaving.This was literally the only time in my adult life that I've left a less than 20% tip. I've never written a bad review about a restaurant online- but I feel compelled to warn other people about it.",1.0
"My girlfriend and I went this past Monday night. And based on the past reviewers who had long waits and unattentive waiters, I'd recommend going on a Monday night because it might make a world of difference.We arrived around 7:40 and there were several 2-tops and one 4-top available. We sat right away. As everyone has already said, the decor is fantastic, very homey and rustic.We split the ""special"" bone marrow ravioli as our app, which was very good, and a great starter to whet the appetite. She got the chicken two-ways and I got the Red Wattle. As a jew who doesn't really eat a lot of pork, the red wattle chop was utterly delicious. It was so moist and well-seasoned. The chicken two ways was really good, but yeh, she took half of my chop. It's a good thing I am a generous guy. We got the two sides, cheese potatoes which were creamy and delicious and the brussel sprouts, equally good.It's not an inexpensive meal, but if you have some disposable income and want to go out for a really good meal, maybe celebrate something, VHH is where its at. And yeh, monday night seemed like a good night to go. Especially when you eat a table away from Steve Buscemi.",4.0

"Originally my friend rich was going to walk across the brooklyn bridge with us and head to vinegar hill house. but apparently, brooklyn holds no cachet with him so he opted to not go and leave us to our own devices. It ended up being a beautiful walk and a memorable experience at this dining establishment. First off, i decided to get there when it first opened as they don't take reservations and there is nowhere to hang out and wait for a table to open up. As we walked up the street towards the place,it looked like a concert was about to start as there were about 50 people huddles around the doorway of VHH. and it hadn't even opened yet! apparently we weren't the only ones trying to miss the crowds. Shit.we finally got in and sat at the bar and watched the craziness ensue. We got seated about 45 minutes later, i got their famous for a good reason skillet chicken and jovanie got their pork chop. Both were awesome. They had some kind of caramel sea salt pudding thing which was also out of this world. Our waitress was nice, the space itself was very charming. I would definitely recommend it. And it was a 20 minutes wall from wall street to this place. It was great to experience a fantastic restaurant that was off the beaten path.The only negative was the no reservation thing.",4.0
"Yay, I'm a fan, but DAMN this is out of the way.  I kept expecting for a junkyard dog to try to mug us or something among the industrial loft-y type area.  Sunday night, not much of a wait.  It was super toasty and humid because of the oven in there, but rustic.  very friendly staff.  small ever-changing scrumptious menu.  we B.O.O.B.'ed (Brought Our Own Booze) and that was sweet.  sitting at the bar, we struck up a convo with a couple of the staff, very nice.  They spoke of a private dining area downstairs with a fireplace that may become some kind of wine bar or holding area where you can drink while you wait for a table, etc.  that will be once the license comes thru.  My advice: go here while you can still BYO. and expect a mad wait on Fri and Sat.  2 hrs is not a myth.  but once you're all the way out there, they pretty much have you.  as if you're going anywhere else.  ...",4.0

"Perfect Brunch Spot!It's a gorgeous neighborhood and worth wandering around.  Cobble stones feel like old-world/west-village when you look down.  Balconies and sunlight feel like a beach town when you look up.The waiter recommended the Reuben Sanchez (photo) - a take on the classic corn-beef sandwich.  It's got juicy beef, melted cheddar and a bit of pickle.  Sitting on a cabbage/onion slaw, it's more like Cubano than a Reuben.  The crunch is perfect and the portion size is not overwhelming.Roasted potatoes are an excellent side.  Egg and Tomato (photo) was also simple and farm fresh.  Grapefruit with ginger syrup was a bright and refreshing combination (photo).With strong coffee and a nice backyard, this place is perfect for brunch inside or out.  The service is not perfect - they checked back for one order and still confused my side.  But nice folks and a great atmosphere.",4.0

Served with cheddar jalapeno grits, it was just really stupendous.  Forget the chicken and get this.My regret: I should have gotten the short rib instead of the chicken.  Take note, people.Oh, and the guinness chocolate cake IS all it's cracked up to be.  Leave room.Final recommendation: go on a weekday instead of the weekend.  An hour and a half wait for two at 6:20 (when we left at 8pm it was closer to an hour forty five) is too long a wait for any restaurant.  As the couple who left when they heard the new said, ""An hour and a half isn't a wait... It's a sign to leave.""",4.0
"Adventure Monday continues! Luckily, the three of us got seats right away but there was only one table left on a Monday night around 8PM (they only take reservations for parties of more than 4). I've wanted to try the Cast-Iron Chicken and Guiness Cake at Vinegar Hill House for the longest time but haven't been able to due to its isolated location. We started with an appetizer special of the day: Pork Belly, which was good (Pita bread, greek yogurt, baby arugula, red-skin potatoes, pork belly). The chicken was tasty too (a la carte with onions) but the best dish of the night was the Red Wattle Country Chop (with cheese grits). They were delicious! Best pork chops we've ever had. The Striped Bass was good as well but nothing special there. The Guiness cake for dessert was perfect. Definitely want to take my bf back to try the chops. Side note: The portions are perfect for one so if you have a ravenous appetite, order more appetizers/sides/desserts (which was why we were able to go to another dessert spot afterward, which worked out for us). Also noticed many lingering over dessert and coffee so the vibe here is every laid back and intimate.",5.0
"Not to disagree but just to maybe state personal experience, I didn't think this place was expensive for what you got. The drinks at the bar (their strength IMHO) were $9 when you would have paid $12 - $14 in Manhattan. On top of that, the wine selection is notably inexpensive. I think the priciest bottle I saw was $54 and the one I got for $29 was perfectly good for that range.Take some time out of your day to get the pork chop here. I would say its the best pork chop I've eaten in the greater NYC area. I would put the one at Little Owl as a close second but still, this was the best. You could argue its a bit different because its in a light (and fantastic) sauce whereas the one at LO is really just all about the natural flavor of the pork but either way, its piggy heaven over here. Also want to second all the positive comments around the chicken mousse. I was kind of thinking, since it was chicken liver, that I was going to sate some of the old Jewish roots but it really didn't do that. Its just a completely different thing - the bread served with it is outstanding and the sweet onions are off the charts.One downside - the service isn't fantastic. Specifically the bartender had this whole 'cool' thing going wherein it seemed like he could hear anything and then just give you that slight head nod of confidence like ""I gotcha, no worries"" when in reality it seemed to mean, ""I don't care all that much - you may or may not get your drink"". Not the end of the world but could have been better. Table service was a bit better but just don't go there with your whole 'Manhattan impatience' thing (which I have a serious dose of). Relax and enjoy the evening. They're not in a hurry and nothing you do is going to change that.Back patio also a plus. I will return... 4.5 stars really.",4.0
"We went to Vinegar Hill House last Friday night. We waited, and this is not an exaggeration, 2 hours and 10 minutes for a table (shame on us, really-- but the host/owner kept telling us that it would only be another 1/2 hour, and after an hour of waiting already, we felt like we couldn't leave!)Once we were finally seated, we were ignored for another 20 minutes. Among the many items we ordered off the menu, the mussels were raw, and the chicken (which NY mag RAVED about) was totally dry- and served by itself with a single roasted shallot. Our food came to $94. And we were not comped anything from the bill, nor did the waitstaff apologize or even say goodbye when we were leaving.This was literally the only time in my adult life that I've left a less than 20% tip. I've never written a bad review about a restaurant online- but I feel compelled to warn other people about it.",1.0
"My girlfriend and I went this past Monday night. And based on the past reviewers who had long waits and unattentive waiters, I'd recommend going on a Monday night because it might make a world of difference.We arrived around 7:40 and there were several 2-tops and one 4-top available. We sat right away. As everyone has already said, the decor is fantastic, very homey and rustic.We split the ""special"" bone marrow ravioli as our app, which was very good, and a great starter to whet the appetite. She got the chicken two-ways and I got the Red Wattle. As a jew who doesn't really eat a lot of pork, the red wattle chop was utterly delicious. It was so moist and well-seasoned. The chicken two ways was really good, but yeh, she took half of my chop. It's a good thing I am a generous guy. We got the two sides, cheese potatoes which were creamy and delicious and the brussel sprouts, equally good.It's not an inexpensive meal, but if you have some disposable income and want to go out for a really good meal, maybe celebrate something, VHH is where its at. And yeh, monday night seemed like a good night to go. Especially when you eat a table away from Steve Buscemi.",4.0

"Originally my friend rich was going to walk across the brooklyn bridge with us and head to vinegar hill house. but apparently, brooklyn holds no cachet with him so he opted to not go and leave us to our own devices. It ended up being a beautiful walk and a memorable experience at this dining establishment. First off, i decided to get there when it first opened as they don't take reservations and there is nowhere to hang out and wait for a table to open up. As we walked up the street towards the place,it looked like a concert was about to start as there were about 50 people huddles around the doorway of VHH. and it hadn't even opened yet! apparently we weren't the only ones trying to miss the crowds. Shit.we finally got in and sat at the bar and watched the craziness ensue. We got seated about 45 minutes later, i got their famous for a good reason skillet chicken and jovanie got their pork chop. Both were awesome. They had some kind of caramel sea salt pudding thing which was also out of this world. Our waitress was nice, the space itself was very charming. I would definitely recommend it. And it was a 20 minutes wall from wall street to this place. It was great to experience a fantastic restaurant that was off the beaten path.The only negative was the no reservation thing.",4.0
"Yay, I'm a fan, but DAMN this is out of the way.  I kept expecting for a junkyard dog to try to mug us or something among the industrial loft-y type area.  Sunday night, not much of a wait.  It was super toasty and humid because of the oven in there, but rustic.  very friendly staff.  small ever-changing scrumptious menu.  we B.O.O.B.'ed (Brought Our Own Booze) and that was sweet.  sitting at the bar, we struck up a convo with a couple of the staff, very nice.  They spoke of a private dining area downstairs with a fireplace that may become some kind of wine bar or holding area where you can drink while you wait for a table, etc.  that will be once the license comes thru.  My advice: go here while you can still BYO. and expect a mad wait on Fri and Sat.  2 hrs is not a myth.  but once you're all the way out there, they pretty much have you.  as if you're going anywhere else.  ...",4.0

"I could only begrudginly give Vinegar Hill House two stars because the service was so poor. Specifically, the hostess really messed up, with no acknowledgement.  I've worked in restaurants and know how it works, for the most part. We arrived at 8:10pm and were told that it'd be a 45 minute wait for a party of two. We got cocktails and went out into the crowded garden to hang out... and wait. We checked in with the hostess at 9:30pm-- and granted, it was a busy Saturday night-- who told us that people who had arrived at 6pm were still sitting at their table and they did not have a policy of asking people to finish up when there was a long wait list.  I mentioned the empty 2-top in the backyard, ""just to make sure you know it's there"" and the excuse was that the backyard server was swamped. So we sat in the back, watching the tables empty out (now there were 6 seats open back there), observing when one of the two bartenders finished his shift... COME ON!!! An incompetent server combined with an incompetent hostess? Give me a break; you can do better, Vinegar Hill House. You will all make more money and satisfy more hungry bellies, at that. We finally sat down at 10:15, over two hours after arriving. Lesson to the hostess: realistic estimates of wait times keep people happy, and that's your job. Maybe you're new.The food was great, and we held out for that aspect of the experience. The watermelon soup was a little brothy, which was not my preference, but the crab was a great contrast.  The avocado puree and hazelnuts with the beets provided delicious flavor and texture variety. Yum! I'm inspired to use hazelnuts more often.  The Red Waddle Country Chop was one of our highlights; satisfyingly seared with a deep saucy-gravy, on top of spicy (to me) cheddar polenta.  It was the rarest pork chop we'd ever had; a perfect balance of tenderness inside and crispy outside.  The Cast Iron Chicken was juicy and more subtly flavored (than the pork), perhaps with white wine. The coriander dressing on the fruit/tomato salad was disappointing, but the glory of the heirloom tomato made up for it. Yay for seasonal tomatoes!  We went for the Salted Caramel Custard for dessert and it was intensely salty and sweet, maybe even some booze in there. We were able to finish it though! I will return to Vinegar Hill House, during the week, when I'm not totally hungry and can wait if need be.  Definitely would've been happier if they'd offered us something for our excessively long wait; guess I'll have to learn to address that with the management in the moment.",2.0

"Came back for brunch on a Saturday (yea the hours are wrong on Yelp) after an AMAZING dinner experience. With the Wattle Chop fresh in my mind and my mouth primed for the taste of the Cast Iron Chicken, I was slightly disappointed. Not really as much by the food but rather by the service. At 1pm on a Saturday, the restaurant had a more upbeat air to it as the sun was out in full effect. Unfortunately, the staff didn't share this sentiment. While not brash and unresponsive, they were more aloof and condescending, waiting for you to make the next move while flashing a disingenuous smile. Now, the food came out quickly and they were quick to the punch when we did manage to grab their attention, but they ambled about as if they were hung over (I don't blame them if they actually were :P) and the brunch staff just didn't brighten the experience of eating here like the staff did the last time I visited. As for the food, when I took my first bite, it tasted more like a Reuben than the smoked fish (sable?) sandwich that I ordered. That's because it was a Reuben...which my gf had ordered and they gave to me instead (my sandwich took another couple of minutes to be served and I only took a bite after a couple minutes of waiting and insistence on my friends' part. See what I mean by lackluster service?). But the Reuben was thin and manageable... oily and flavorful and overall very delicious. My smoked fish sandwich was a nice play on sweet and smoky, and the apple (?) added a nice crunch to the texture. My other friend's Sourdough Pancakes with Ricotta and Carmelized Bananas was INCREDIBLE. Although not very big (maybe 10-inched across and single stack), it made up for it with BIG flavor. Definitely something everybody should try if you ever visit for brunch. We also shared a side of sausage (which comes in the shape of a flattened meatball) which was pretty good, and also toast (which was more an assortment of different breads) and quince preserve (which was incredible).4 stars for great food with ""meh"" serviceRevisit?

She was rude, unfriendly, entirely unhelpful. After we'd waited an hour for our food, I was still hungry and asked her how long it would be to get another pancake. She unapologetically proceeded to tell us the kitchen was closed. The rest of the wait staff seemed to have a better attitude. After having to deal w her, I have no interest in going back - unfortunately considering the food was great for the most part.",2.0

"There's not much to say that hasn't been covered but as a guest in NYC and at Vinegar Hill here's my two cents. We also saw this on the Food Network and were inspired by the review of the Red Wattle Chop so when in the city in mid December decided to make the trek to Brooklyn to try the restaurant. We knew there would likely be a wait because they don't take reservations and, hello, it was recently reviewed on TV. We took the subway to York St. station and walked 4 or 5 blocks to get  there, an easy walk even in the cold. We had to stand at the bar with a cocktail for 40 minutes or so but it was a Friday night around 7pm - primetime for dining so we were prepared to wait.

The jalapeno grits were very yummy, too. We also had the brisket with marrow and it, too, was delish: moist and falling apart.  We'd made a special trip to eat here so of course we forced ourselves to try dessert; salted caramel custard and the apple bread pudding. Both were very good but the stars of the meal were the liver mousse and the wattle chop. The service was quite efficient as we were attended to by several different staffers over the course of the meal. The price, $126 tax in for two with cocktails and wine seems completely reasonable for city dining and the quality and quantity of the food. $25 for a pork chop does seem slightly high until you see the size of the chop and plate.

"Opens at 6pm for dinner and get there by 6:15 unless you want to wait ... no reservations for less than 6 people.Apps: Watermelon Salad was delicious and refreshing for a warm summer evening.  Grilled sardine on crouton was also tremendous.Main: Panned chicken was just too good for words ... the sherry and butter sauce might have been one of the best things I've eaten in years.   Short ribs were very very good in a summertime variation over heirloom tomatoes and blue cheese.  Great!Sides: Sweet corn was good but a little over-powered by parmisan.  Grilled eggplant was nice and smoky from the wood grill.Desert: italian plum tart with whipped cream was off the charts!Wine: a ""rose"" from Rioja.  really more of a light red (orange color).  enough depth to pair with anything on the menu.  it held up superbly with the short ribs.  bought two bottles on the internet when i got home .. 1998 Lopez de Heredia ""Vina Tondonia"" Gran Reserva Rosado RiojaService: good not great ... tight space and the dining room gets packed so this is not a place for a quiet, ""intimate"" meal.",5.0

"after many rave reviews from friends, i finally ventured out there for a bday dinner. the spot truly is in the middle of nowhere, so battle for a spot at the bustling bar, bc you're in for a wait! upstairs, the ambiance is warm and welcoming.. downstairs, where my party was eventually seated, is less polished and cramped. at least there's another bathroom on that level to avoid trips up and down that knee-breaking staircase. food highlights:- bone marrow ravioli: delicious unctuous filling encased in slippery pasta- pork chop: yes, it's pink and less cooked than i'm accustomed for pork, but the deep flavor and tender chew was fantastic. - pommes aligot: mashed potatoes with cheese curds folded into it.. creamy, gooey and super addictive.only ok: - charred octopus: brian leth's dish at le grand fooding was my absolute favorite, but at the restaurant, the same ingredients just didn't live up to my memory. cooked nicely and very meaty, but the flavors weren't popping at all. - special foie gras terrine: had a weird flavor from the lentils... earthy gone very wrong- brussel sprouts: WAY too much fish sauce! so, i really wanted to LOVE this place, but i can only say i like it and will come back... maybe in the spring to enjoy the cute courtyard garden.",4.0
"For every bad review I write, I must also write a good review. (Unfortunately there are a lot more bad restaurants out there than there are good one).  Nonetheless, Vinegar Hill House is certainly deserving of all five Yelp stars... and then some.  Just about everything with my experience there was spot on.  The ambiance, the food, the service... all fantastic.  Yes, the entrees cost $20 - $30, but you get what you pay for.  Good stuff!  My only slight complaint (and as a musician, I am without a doubt overly sensitive), was the music selection.  Enough with Pavement.  At least it was quiet. Though I might have preferred some Ellington or....  Whatever, I loved it there.  Thank you, Vinegar Hill House.",5.0
"Came back for brunch on a Saturday (yea the hours are wrong on Yelp) after an AMAZING dinner experience. With the Wattle Chop fresh in my mind and my mouth primed for the taste of the Cast Iron Chicken, I was slightly disappointed. Not really as much by the food but rather by the service. At 1pm on a Saturday, the restaurant had a more upbeat air to it as the sun was out in full effect. Unfortunately, the staff didn't share this sentiment. While not brash and unresponsive, they were more aloof and condescending, waiting for you to make the next move while flashing a disingenuous smile. Now, the food came out quickly and they were quick to the punch when we did manage to grab their attention, but they ambled about as if they were hung over (I don't blame them if they actually were :P) and the brunch staff just didn't brighten the experience of eating here like the staff did the last time I visited. As for the food, when I took my first bite, it tasted more like a Reuben than the smoked fish (sable?) sandwich that I ordered. That's because it was a Reuben...which my gf had ordered and they gave to me instead (my sandwich took another couple of minutes to be served and I only took a bite after a couple minutes of waiting and insistence on my friends' part. See what I mean by lackluster service?). But the Reuben was thin and manageable... oily and flavorful and overall very delicious. My smoked fish sandwich was a nice play on sweet and smoky, and the apple (?) added a nice crunch to the texture. My other friend's Sourdough Pancakes with Ricotta and Carmelized Bananas was INCREDIBLE. Although not very big (maybe 10-inched across and single stack), it made up for it with BIG flavor. Definitely something everybody should try if you ever visit for brunch. We also shared a side of sausage (which comes in the shape of a flattened meatball) which was pretty good, and also toast (which was more an assortment of different breads) and quince preserve (which was incredible).4 stars for great food with ""meh"" serviceRevisit?

"Went here for a birthday brunch. Everything but one dish was great: steak and eggs, Benedict, pancake -yumm. What totally ruined the experience was the waitress - nancy. She was rude, unfriendly, entirely unhelpful. After we'd waited an hour for our food, I was still hungry and asked her how long it would be to get another pancake. She unapologetically proceeded to tell us the kitchen was closed. The rest of the wait staff seemed to have a better attitude. After having to deal w her, I have no interest in going back - unfortunately considering the food was great for the most part.",2.0

"There's not much to say that hasn't been covered but as a guest in NYC and at Vinegar Hill here's my two cents. We also saw this on the Food Network and were inspired by the review of the Red Wattle Chop so when in the city in mid December decided to make the trek to Brooklyn to try the restaurant. We knew there would likely be a wait because they don't take reservations and, hello, it was recently reviewed on TV. We took the subway to York St. station and walked 4 or 5 blocks to get  there, an easy walk even in the cold. We had to stand at the bar with a cocktail for 40 minutes or so but it was a Friday night around 7pm - primetime for dining so we were prepared to wait. This gave us the chance to take in the ambiance and it is charming; rustic yet warm, crowded but homey, almost cozy. The food was as advertised; all delicious with substantial portions. I can't imagine how anyone could still be hungry after a meal here. We shared an order of the chicken liver mousse and felt compelled to ask if they sell jars of it to take away.

"I was excited to try Vinegar Hill House as I like Freeman's food but I don't love the attitude. I thought a Brooklyn version would be an improvement, but sadly I was wrong.We ordered a bottle of wine at the bar and were brought a different bottle. When we said it wasn't correct, the bartender questioned us before determining that it was in fact not the bottle we ordered.Once we were seated at a table the waiter greeted us with a ""sup?"" and then asked what kind of water we wanted--but didn't bring us water until our meals arrived 30 minutes later, even though we requested it three times. The food was good (excellent charcuterie plate), though the chicken was not entirely cooked. When the waiter saw I was examining the uncooked chicken, he walked away. He never checked back to see how our meal was. The restaurant is located on a really pretty street in Brooklyn and the atmosphere is nice, but the service was terrible. I think you can find similar food in Brooklyn without having to put up with the terrible service and attitude. When is the too cool for school vibe going to die?",2.0
"I had the pleasure to go to a private engagement party for my friends Collin and Stacey here at Vinegar Hill House, before it opened. What a treat, and a fantastic party!First of all, the space is a quaint converted neighborhood retail storefront that used to be a butcher shop. It's been dressed appropriately with period looking decor and nice finishing touches. It creates a warm and inviting atmosphere. There's also a very cute back garden that I'm sure will be used when the weather changes. The owners and staff were abundantly on hand to take care of the guests. They were all extremely gracious and cheerful. It's obvioius that there is some history between them (must be from the Freeman's days.)The chef, Jean Adamson, did not have the menu yet. He promised that it would be more vegetarian friendly than Freeman's. We had some lovely appetizers though - Baked Oysters, Walnut Crostini, Squash soup, a fantastic spread of cheese and salami (I could have sworn that one of them was my favorite Wild Boar), and a mushroom cap with sausage. They were all great.One of the really nice touches was a self serve Vodka Collins dispenser at the bar.Overall, if the party was any indication of how great the service and food will be when they officially open, then we're blessed with a new Gem in Brooklyn, and a great reason to walk from Dumbo to Vinegar Hill.",5.0

"If this food and this vibe could be had for less time waiting, quicker service (is it possible with that tight kitchen?) and a certain protocol of service, we'd drive there more frequently. We returned today for lunch after having sworn it off 6 months ago when dinner was too loud, we got bumped into too much, and felt too old for the place (was this us, in our 30's, complaining about noise level and young people bumping into us while we ate?). Today we were told 10 min, a couple came in after us (were they there before us?), and they got seated - until they gave up the table to us (never a good sign) and we were once again sandwiched between two crazy conversations. The protocol - I just wish it could be understood that if you sat first, you get served first, but I digress.Eggs and tomato - sizzling hot out of that oven ALWAYS delicious. I usually have to order one other thing or I leave hungry - grapefruit is always good (although the level of ginger syrup varies, today there was barely any) and toast can be delicious with fresh butter and preserves.

"First, I must state the obvious.  I walked past no fewer than 3 housing projects to get here and there was something very alarming about walking into a bustling, well-lit room, filled with flushed white people spending their disposable income on incredibly expensive food and beverages.  It's one thing to plop down a hundred or two dining in the West Village or even Williamsburg or Fort Greene, but there's a very different feeling here--not that there necessarily should be, but there is.  We waited an hour on a Monday night, sipping mediocre cocktails.  I had the Presbyterian Secret and my dining partner had the Bourbon Smash.  They tasted very, very similar, though the former with cubed ice and the latter with crushed.  We drank these in the back garden, which is heavenly.  Even though it was a chilly night, it was a treat to shiver in that gorgeous space.  (And yes, wine would have been a better outdoor-on-a-chilly-night choice, but we didn't do that.)We had the Torta Rustica appetizer and it was so-so, but the Ramps were delicious.  The English Pea Ravioli was to die for.  Some incomprehensibly good combination of lightness and ravioli!For entrees, one of us went with the famous chicken and the other with the slightly less famous chops and we shared.  Both were excellent, but we actually enjoyed the chop more.  If we had to pick one, both of us would pick that.  I also recommend the Carmenere as a companion wine.And, though we were STUFFED at this point (there are complaints below about portions so we ordered a lot, but we thought they were actually quite ample and we could have easily done with less), we did get a slice of the Guinness Cake, which was--as promised--amazing.  I wished I had had more room, so I could have finished every scrumptious bite.The service was fine, but aloof.  I don't really care that much, but I can definitely see how it would be off-putting to some.  We had the unfortunate situation of sitting next to a table with an egregious complainer.  I think he complained about everything they put in front of him (and his three companions).  I shudder to think how much of his meal was comped, given what an asshole he seemed to be.  On the other hand, my dining partner was good-guy enough to point out that our cocktails had not been added to our bill.  I basically expected those to be on the house since it was their mistake, but our server simply fixed it and came back.  That was a disappointment.I recommend this place, but only if you are making a night of it.  This is not at all a place to pop in before another event, as we arrived at 8:45ish and were there until just after midnight.  (Maybe if you just do entrees, but then you'd really be missing out.)  I will certainly come back, most likely for brunch next time.",4.0
"Went here last night with the family. Apps were delicious, Highly recommend the tomato tart and the octopus. For dinner we had the cast iron chicken, 2 porkchops and the pasta. Pasta had way too much butter sauce. Pork chop was delicious but tons of fat, chicken was okay, had much better at Hill Country. Caramel custard was very different and good. Service was pretty terrible though. Never heard the specials or was given bread until I asked and our server spoke so low...very strange. Also, she grabbed the menu and check with my credit card out of my hand which was extremely rude. Not sure this is a place i'd give a second chance.",3.0

"Vinegar Hill House is a trip in every sense.  It takes walking through no mans land to get there, and once you're there you have to wait so come prepared with something to do with your time.  It's super homey and has a very Marlowe & Sons esque feeling- tons of watiresses in plaid, a bunch of bearded men in the kitchen, and a rustic well priced menu.  I had the octopus to start and it was amazing.  At other restaurants octopus is sometimes doused with butter and is too rich, at VHH it was light and tender.  We shared mains of wild boar over polenta and the pork chop.  I think the pork chop stands out more, it has great flavor without being heavily sauced.  The brussel sprout side dish was good, but the lemon overpowered the mint.  We passed on dessert because we were full and the passover diet doesn't allow for such indulgences unfortuneately.  I'll definitely come back to VHH, it was one of the better meals i've had in 2010.",4.0

"First, I must state the obvious.  I walked past no fewer than 3 housing projects to get here and there was something very alarming about walking into a bustling, well-lit room, filled with flushed white people spending their disposable income on incredibly expensive food and beverages.  It's one thing to plop down a hundred or two dining in the West Village or even Williamsburg or Fort Greene, but there's a very different feeling here--not that there necessarily should be, but there is.  We waited an hour on a Monday night, sipping mediocre cocktails.  I had the Presbyterian Secret and my dining partner had the Bourbon Smash.  They tasted very, very similar, though the former with cubed ice and the latter with crushed.  We drank these in the back garden, which is heavenly.  Even though it was a chilly night, it was a treat to shiver in that gorgeous space.  (And yes, wine would have been a better outdoor-on-a-chilly-night choice, but we didn't do that.)We had the Torta Rustica appetizer and it was so-so, but the Ramps were delicious.  The English Pea Ravioli was to die for.  Some incomprehensibly good combination of lightness and ravioli!For entrees, one of us went with the famous chicken and the other with the slightly less famous chops and we shared.  Both were excellent, but we actually enjoyed the chop more.  If we had to pick one, both of us would pick that.  I also recommend the Carmenere as a companion wine.And, though we were STUFFED at this point (there are complaints below about portions so we ordered a lot, but we thought they were actually quite ample and we could have easily done with less), we did get a slice of the Guinness Cake, which was--as promised--amazing.  I wished I had had more room, so I could have finished every scrumptious bite.The service was fine, but aloof.  I don't really care that much, but I can definitely see how it would be off-putting to some.  We had the unfortunate situation of sitting next to a table with an egregious complainer.  I think he complained about everything they put in front of him (and his three companions).  I shudder to think how much of his meal was comped, given what an asshole he seemed to be.  On the other hand, my dining partner was good-guy enough to point out that our cocktails had not been added to our bill.  I basically expected those to be on the house since it was their mistake, but our server simply fixed it and came back.  That was a disappointment.I recommend this place, but only if you are making a night of it.  This is not at all a place to pop in before another event, as we arrived at 8:45ish and were there until just after midnight.  (Maybe if you just do entrees, but then you'd really be missing out.)  I will certainly come back, most likely for brunch next time.",4.0
"Went here last night with the family. Apps were delicious, Highly recommend the tomato tart and the octopus. For dinner we had the cast iron chicken, 2 porkchops and the pasta. Pasta had way too much butter sauce. Pork chop was delicious but tons of fat, chicken was okay, had much better at Hill Country. Caramel custard was very different and good. Service was pretty terrible though. Never heard the specials or was given bread until I asked and our server spoke so low...very strange. Also, she grabbed the menu and check with my credit card out of my hand which was extremely rude. Not sure this is a place i'd give a second chance.",3.0
"Delicious and scrumptious brunch! We ordered the maple bacon. I had the special fried egg, ham, cheese and aioli breakfast sandwhich.  Hubbie ordered the pankcake. Everything was sooo good. Can't wait to come back and try dinner!",5.0
"The atmosphere was wonderful and I enjoyed my cocktail and dessert.  The problem was portion size.  After appetizers and dinner anyone who ordered a pasta dish in our party was still very hungry.  We actually asked for bread and butter AFTER we ate our entrees.  Also, the Red Wattle Country Chop is overpriced for what it was.  It was good, but definitely not $25 good.  I'd go back for appetizers or dessert and cocktails - not dinner.",2.0
"Cozy, romantic dinner hangout, with the best pork chop in the business (from the red wattle breed) and out-of-this-world brussels sprouts. Also a wine list worth a second look. Downstairs, a wood-burning fireplace keeps things warm in winter. It gets a bit loud and crowded on the weekends, but worth the trek from Manhattan.",4.0
"Vinegar Hill House is a trip in every sense.  It takes walking through no mans land to get there, and once you're there you have to wait so come prepared with something to do with your time.  It's super homey and has a very Marlowe & Sons esque feeling- tons of watiresses in plaid, a bunch of bearded men in the kitchen, and a rustic well priced menu.  I had the octopus to start and it was amazing.  At other restaurants octopus is sometimes doused with butter and is too rich, at VHH it was light and tender.  We shared mains of wild boar over polenta and the pork chop.  I think the pork chop stands out more, it has great flavor without being heavily sauced.  The brussel sprout side dish was good, but the lemon overpowered the mint.  We passed on dessert because we were full and the passover diet doesn't allow for such indulgences unfortuneately.  I'll definitely come back to VHH, it was one of the better meals i've had in 2010.",4.0
"Why didn't I know about this place sooner? It is seriously the most perfect place for brunch. The food is perfection and so interesting. Everything is so yummy and unique. The service was great, out waiter so quirky and perfect for the ambiance. The space reminds me of an old haunted house which I loved. Its kinda in the middle of nowhere, like around the corner are projects then you end up here and it looks like a old haunted little street in some other world. We had reservations but there were people waiting for the doors to open at 11 so be prepared to wait but I promise its worth it.",5.0
"Everyone in the neighborhood is wondering what is going on here. This was our favorite local spot for years, suddenly the food is a disaster.  On our last visit the waiter mentioned changes in the kitchen and it shows on the plate.  What happened to in-house made pasta and the beautiful chicken in a skillet?  Our only dish that was acceptable was a salad. So disappointing..",1.0

"They recently opened for brunch this summer and I went this morning, fabulous! Very reasonable prices  and everything was delicious. I had their special juice of the day, cucumber mint something, not sure but it was green and tasty and very refreshing. My main course was the sourdough pancake with ricotta cheese and caramelized banana. BEST PANCAKE OF MY LIFE. Everyone at the table who didn't get the pancake ended up ordering it for dessert, that's how good it was. it was kind of crispy on the outside and pancake-y in the middle and exactly the right portion. I will definitely return!So besides having the best pancakes ever they also had some pretty delicious bacon. I didn't try anything else but everyone else seemed pretty pleased with their meals as well. The ambience was nice, I'm sure others have described it so I'll leave that to them. All in all, very highly recommended!",5.0
"Amazing, totally worth a trip to Brooklyn! And Frank Bruni is right, the pork chops are out of this world... even my husband, who doesn't like pork, loved it! That's how good it was. I also recommend the heirloom tomato tart as an appetizer and the Guinness chocolate cake (you can't really taste the Guinness) with cream cheese topping (to die for). The short ribs are very good, but the pork chop is superior... not a big fan of the corn salad.",4.0
"Abutting the Brooklyn Navy Yard and DUMBO, Vinegar Hill is an eight block long enclave of row houses and cobblestone streets.  The area feels like a deserted village where the only sound to be heard is the quiet humming of a Con Ed substation that spans several blocks.  I'd never seen another person on my walks through Vinegar Hill but I did encounter many cats roaming the tree-lined streets.   When I heard that there's a restaurant in Vinegar Hill (and a good one at that), I was intrigued and eager for an excuse to make another visit to this anachronism of a neighborhood whose haunting obscurity has always captivated me.  One rainy Friday night, my friend and I eagerly set out on the 20 minute walk from our stomping ground in Brooklyn Heights to Vinegar Hill House.  The restaurant is tucked inside of a cozy, 19th century wood-frame house on Hudson Street which was swarming with plaid shirts, skinny jeans and Emo haircuts.  We drank at the bar for about an hour before getting a table.Everything we ordered from the seasonal menu was outstanding.  My starter, the chicken liver mousse had the consistency of butter and practically melted in my mouth.  This wasn't just any old liver; it came in a cute little mason jar topped with pistachios and was accompanied by frisee brushed with horseradish as well as sweetened onions.  I was given just enough crusty bread upon which to spread the liver and its accompaniments which was a relief; otherwise, I'd have felt compelled to lick the sides of the jar.  My friend's heirloom tomato and cheese tart appetizer which was made in the wood-fired oven did not disappoint either.  My entree, some kind of pumpkin seed encrusted fish with cucumbers and dilly beans, was delicious.  My friend loved his main course of chicken cooked and served in a piping hot cast iron skillet.  Dessert consisted of a shared slice of Guinness chocolate cake with a thick layer of cream cheese frosting.  This was the perfect dessert; the cake was rich but not sickeningly sweet. Other reviews have complained about the small portions but neither of us felt deprived in any way.  After finishing up at the restaurant, my friend and I took a walk around the corner to catch a glimpse of the Commandant's House, a 19th century Federal style mansion which used to be the home of the commander of the Navy Yard.  We stood at the gates surrounding the mansion which, like Vinegar Hill itself, is wonderfully out of place and agreed that our meal at Vinegar Hill House was the best we'd had in quite some time.",5.0
"I love this place.Its hidden in a corner of vinegar hill that no one really goes to (much like vinegar hill itself), but hence the old world, untouched feel of the location.The room is warm, nicely decorated in the au courant rustic hipster style prevaling across brooklyn, but maybe because the location is offbeat, the atmosphere feels more authentic.Now the food:must get:- the calamari- the liver mousse- the pasta with whichever meatish sauce is on offer (although the portions on pasta are skimpy)- the pork chop the only things that have been so so are occasionally some of the fish dishes, but even they aren't bad. for the quality of food, the prices are reasonable.",5.0
"My friends took me here after raving about it. We got lucky and were seated with no wait (sunday early dinner). The waitstaff is knowledgeable and helpful. For apps, we ordered the grilled octopus salad with a citrus hint which was delicious. And a artichoke/olive dish which was also good. One friend and I both ordered the crispy chicken w/pearl onions. It was predictably well-prepared and crispy from being baked in a brick oven in a cast iron skillet. Our other friend ordered the steak with sea beans. The steak was very small in size, but it had a very interesting taste that reminded up of fruity pebbles. no joke. It was the strangest experience chewing on steak that had the essence of fruity pebbles. weird. That being said, the ambiance is great and was very happy with my experience here.",4.0
"We live in Brooklyn Heights and decided to go to Vinegar Hill House for Brunch over the 4th of July weekend.

An attentive waiter...great coffee...delicious, adventurous food...and they took credit cards.

Great service too! We looked at the menu and excitedly made our selections as we were starving. My husband ordered the Sunny Duck Eggs.. Granted, this might have been the wrong thing to order as he has not tried duck eggs before.

A small bowl of, again, over salty tomato soup.. and to crown it all, a super salty, mushy pickle, which is probably the worst type of pickle you can buy at a grocery.. There was no care, and no artistry.. and the dish was so over salted that I could not have more than a few bites.

"Vibe: It's small and cozy. Go there on a fri/sat night and you're bound to have problems getting a table.  I went one night at around 9pm and we got seated pretty much right away.Food: Portions are small, although I think they're quite ample. This is the type of place where you order an appetizer. If you don't, then you might want to order extra sides.Drink: Wine options are great. Glasses are a bit small but I'm so used to overpriced in the city that this doesn't faze me much. If you want a drink bargain, go to 68 Jay Bar.Service: The service I had was pretty good. Sometimes they're a bit bumbling, but it's a small place. All the servers I've had were completely nice and helpful. One night we shut the place down and they never rushed us out. They just talked to us and we laughed as they put on their coats to politely usher us out.I recommend: Chicken Liver Mousse, Bitter Salad, Pork Chop, Chicken, Pumpkin Ravioli, Guiness Cake.",4.0
"I took my parents, who are somewhat picky eaters, for dinner here and they loved everything.  We ordered the cast iron chicken, the english pea ravioli, a pasta with rabbit special, a lamb special, a couple of vegetable sides, the leek and mozarella tart, and the salami and cheese plate, as well as wine.  Every dish was well executed, the meats were tender, the sauces were light but tasty.  We were also very pleased by the prices- dinner for five, including two bottles of wine, was well under 200 before tip.  The restaurant itself was charming and had a nice atmosphere.  They lose one star because the staff was a little unprofessional- the waiter especially seemed like he had just woken up from a nap and made a few little mistakes but nothing too big.  Overall we had a great time and I will definitely be coming back with my boyfriend- this place is a welcome addition to the neighborhood.",4.0
"The octopus salad is a truly singular and beautiful thing. It has kind of become a part of me, I think about it every now and again, I feel as though it expanded my horizons slightly, like a good artwork.  It's an inspired piece, and I highly recommend it.",5.0
"OK, More like giving 3.5 stars. Why so low?Well I arrived at 6:30 and was told 1 hr and a half to 1 hr 45 min wait for table but if I wanted I could try to snag a table at the bar since they are first come first served.After about 15 mins I managed to sneak in when somebody left. After about 10-15 mins the bartender finally came over to me to take my order. Definitely a very disorganized system, even though they are very busy.I settled on the Lamb cannelloni to start, then the Red Wattle Country chop and I got sides of jalapeno grits and brussel sprouts.The cannelloni came out within 10 mins of me ordering so right away I was thinking we are off to a good start. The lamb cannelloni was great, piping hot and full of succulent and tender pulled lamb meat topped with a delicious fonduta cream sauce. It was perfectly browned on the outside and I was given two large cannelloni but took 1 to go. But then is when the meal started taking a bad turn. I waited nearly 40 minutes before I got my entree. The bartender finally came over to me and said its been awhile let me check on your food. Problem is when you dine solo and sit at a bar I think you kind of get neglected but w/e. I requested my pork chop ""extra rare"", even knowing and being reminded by the peson who took my order that they tend to cook it on the medium rare side for pork. But I wanted it even more rare than usual. Alas, when the chop came it was cooked somewhat pink but nowhere near as rare as I had wanted. By this time I was starving and just ate it. The chop was good don't get me wrong but certainly nothing spectacular. I was expecting something really special given all the rave reviews and Frank Bruni calling it one of the best things he ever ate. It was just lacking something- I thought it would taste more like a dry aged steak but it didn't. Still, it was tasty and tender and good just not great. And I have to admit the portion size wasn't all that big as others say. Regrettably, I even had to ask for more sauce to add some flavor to the pork chop. But they do get an A for presentation because I love the wooden board they serve it with. The sauerkraut was just a garnish and an afterthought. I had a few forkfuls but it was a waste of stomach spance IMO.The sides were awesome! Jalapeno grits and brussel sprouts with walnuts and maple syrup. Definitely great additions.I give Vinegar Hill House 3.5 stars because of the long wait, so so service, cramped atmosphere, and a kinda disappointing pork chop. I will try to come back again since the chicken and wild boar shank look terrific.",3.0
"The food was outstanding here! The garden was lovely, and the inside had great ambience as well. The pork belly appetizer was unbelievably good, and the cast iron chicken was one of the most delicious things I've eaten in a while. Prices were definitely fair. The only reason I wouldn't give them 5 stars is the service -- it was (weirdly) simultaneously attentive and unfriendly. The staff kept trying to take our meals and drinks away before we were even done, and there were no smiles, thank-yous, or good-byes as we passed several staff members on the way out. If they can lighten up and smile a little this place will be unbeatable.",4.0
"Refreshingly simple, seasonal, fresh, delicious food. Reading bad reviews of places I happen to love always makes me suspect there's so much more to a reviewer's story than they are willing to reveal. This is again the case with Vinegar Hill House (VHH). While it gets a fair amount of well-deserved praise, I just don't get the negative reactions to this place. Anyway, VHH served me and my friends a great meal. The staff was handsome, welcoming, and casual yet there when we needed them. We were steered toward excellent wine selections as well as spot-on appetizers. What we had: chicken liver mousse (highly recommend if you're into it - not sure it's for everybody), head-on prawn cocktail, heirloom tomato baked tart. No complaints - wouldn't change a thing. Entrees - boneless short ribs, pork chop, corn, bacon, and jalapeño ravioli, and a side of roasted beets. Everything was shared among us and not a misfire among the lot, but the favorite entree was the pork chop - it was spectacular (and apparently a staff favorite). For dessert we had strawberry shortcake, Guinness chocolate cake, and a cherry tart. Winner that round went to Guinness chocolate cake, but again, all the desserts were very good. What put the cake at the top was its dense moist texture and bittersweetness. Our group favored that slightly under-sweet quality; it may not be everybody's favorite. We sat in the charming garden out back on a cool night. I wouldn't say the seating out there was the most comfortable, but the atmosphere was good enough to distract. Now, be warned, the neighbors have a little construction project currently underway, so toward the end we were serenaded by power saws. It was annoying, but by then we didn't care (other patrons were not so amused). I recommend the interior dining room if you want a sure-thing romantic atmosphere. As with Freemans, this place has the time-warp pre-1900's look down to an art - minus the stuffed animals. I know many reviewers are jumping on the ""seen that, bored with it"" bandwagon, but I never get tired of the look. How can you complain about a screen door for an entrance? Loved every detail.",4.0
"One of the best new restaurants I've been to in a while!  We had a great experience here.  The atmosphere is great - nice choice of music, perfect lighting, comfortable seating.  All of the food completely delivered:  Chicken Liver Mousse was delicious with thick hunks of bread and sweetly cooked onions to accompany.  A Cheese and Leek tart was also an unexpectedly large appetizer (making both of them worth it!) and so, surprisingly, great for splitting.  For an entree, we got the Leg of Lamb special (delicious) and an artichoke side that was cooked to perfect tenderness with a tangy sauce.  Both desserts were the perfect end to a delectable meal:  Butterscotch custard was just the right consistency, and the Stout Cake had chocolate frosting that I wanted to lick off the plate.The best part?  The prices are totally reasonable.  The menu is small and seasonal, so I'm already excited about returning and trying new things.  And I could bring anyone here - friends, parents, boyfriend - and feel totally comfortable.  I look forward to becoming a regular!",4.0
What can I say that hasn't already been said for a restaurant that you need to search for in an out of the way location that is always crowded. Atmosphere is terrific. Great place to go with someone special for a delicious meal in a casual and wonderful setting. Everything we had was delicious.,5.0
"wow! for a dish which has been hyped to no end, the pork chop with jalapeno grits is definitely worth eating again, and again, and again... also split the cote de buef w/ bone marrow which was quite good, but is a notch below minetta tavern's... this is definitely going to the top of the neighborhood rotation!",5.0

"Came to VHH on a recommendation of a chef I met the previous week. Agree that its a great date spot, but he persuaded me to try it out solo at the bar. So I came here by myself Tuesday night 8 pm, to find this small restaurant packed and alive on a quiet lonely street and instantly fell in love. Found a seat at the bar, where a young Colin Ferell bartender poured my $8 white wine to the brim-- although it was a very small, small glass. As I finished ordering, 2 guys who were also eating solo sat next to me, and we ended up basically chatting and sharing all of our food. This is how we rate the food #1 being the best:1. The Pork-- juicest, best pork Ive ever had. Just lightly salted and peppered-- but that is some wonderful meat! If I didnt order #1 or #2, this place would probably just be a 3-4 star place. 2. Chicken-Liver Mousse with pistachios, picked onions, salad with mustard dressing---This actually would be #1, but since I ordered it and LOVED it...I didnt share it...hahaha...so...yeah. :)3. Pea Raviolli-- A simple dish, but made me feel so warm and fuzzy4. Grilled Octopus-- Actually the guys would probably rate this as #3, but warm and fuzzy wins over well grilled octopus5. Trout-- whole trout, good meat6. Guiness Chocolate Cake with Cream Cheese Icing-- had this with a min charteusse shot, and it was a wonderful and drunken combination. Great way to end the meal. 6. Scallop Tart-- This is the only dish I'd skip-- Frankly a scallop should be plump and fat-- but they gave me one scallop, sliced it in 3's and served it on a tart. I was slightly offended. Anyways so this meal was full of surprises and great company. For the experience and ordering the right food off the menu (#1 and #2) VHH totally deserves 5 stars.",5.0

"would be so nice if this was in my neighborhood. cute place, great back garden, solid food, very quiet street.  menu looks like it's straight from the farmer's market so will probably change frequently. we got the shaved market salad, i think with pea shoots, sugar peas, radish, feta.  the veggies were nice but the dressing was a little to sour. there was even a chunk of lemon meat in it.  thot it woulda been grapefruit so was a bit of a shock to eat actual lemon. puree pea-filled ravioli was very good.  interesting flavor, would never really think of eating a veggie pasta like that. both entrees were hits, cast iron chicken and red wattle country chop.  i had no idea what red wattle was but any chop should be good.  tasted like fatty-ish pork but was served medium, on cheddar grits.  red wattle is in fact pork and if i knew it was pork, i may not have ordered it because i have been disappointed in western prepared pork for the past 15yrs or so (unless it's pork belly).  so it was nice to have tasty western-style pork again.  the chicken was magazine photo perfect, including the taste you would imagine.  dessert butterscotch pudding with neiman marcus cookies was so-so.  pudding is good in small doses and i was kinda in the mood for cake.  would love to try brunch here.  we arrived fri around 8:30p and were told it'd be a 2hr wait. decided to hang around and snagged seats at the bar probably around 30min later. it's a small place and there isn't anything else close. reservations only for 6+ so have some back-up plans in case.",4.0

"I went Fri, Dec 12. We got there at 7:30 and were promptly sat, but there had to be 40 people waiting within the hour...fire hazard indeed. The space is amazing, but the four of us were quite disappointed with our food and service. The waiter had a difficult time explaining the specials and how they were served, but that didn't matter. The cheese plate was tasty but at $20 I wouldn't get it again. The mussels were hit-or-miss. There has been quite a bit of praise for the chicken here, and three out of the four diners ordered it. Two had to send it back because it was raw near the bone, nothing like that taste of undercooked chicken! I got the pork shank, which was mediocre. The one thing that we noticed is the same we noticed when Jean was at Freeman's - the food is terribly underseasoned. The chicken and the brussels sprouts had not a trace of sea salt. The white beans with the pork were completely bland. Also, everyone keeps talking about what a great deal $15 chicken is...well it doesn't come with any sides - those are $7, and we found the overall prices to be a bit much for what we got.

"would be so nice if this was in my neighborhood. cute place, great back garden, solid food, very quiet street.  menu looks like it's straight from the farmer's market so will probably change frequently. we got the shaved market salad, i think with pea shoots, sugar peas, radish, feta.  the veggies were nice but the dressing was a little to sour. there was even a chunk of lemon meat in it.  thot it woulda been grapefruit so was a bit of a shock to eat actual lemon. puree pea-filled ravioli was very good.  interesting flavor, would never really think of eating a veggie pasta like that. both entrees were hits, cast iron chicken and red wattle country chop.  i had no idea what red wattle was but any chop should be good.  tasted like fatty-ish pork but was served medium, on cheddar grits.  red wattle is in fact pork and if i knew it was pork, i may not have ordered it because i have been disappointed in western prepared pork for the past 15yrs or so (unless it's pork belly).  so it was nice to have tasty western-style pork again.  the chicken was magazine photo perfect, including the taste you would imagine.  dessert butterscotch pudding with neiman marcus cookies was so-so.  pudding is good in small doses and i was kinda in the mood for cake.  would love to try brunch here.  we arrived fri around 8:30p and were told it'd be a 2hr wait. decided to hang around and snagged seats at the bar probably around 30min later. it's a small place and there isn't anything else close. reservations only for 6+ so have some back-up plans in case.",4.0
"i live 1.5 blocks from this place so i have to review it. my husband i have eaten here 4 or 5 times in the short time that it has been open and we are never disappointed. it is a BYO at this point and that is just fine for our bill. the food is consistently de-lish and the atmosphere is comfortable. there is nothing stuffy or uptight about this place. i would not suggest going if you are a party of more than people. there is a chef's table that seats 6, but i would go in 2's or 4's at most. we love it! go early to sit quickly... good news has travelled fast...",4.0

"I went Fri, Dec 12. We got there at 7:30 and were promptly sat, but there had to be 40 people waiting within the hour...fire hazard indeed. The space is amazing, but the four of us were quite disappointed with our food and service. The waiter had a difficult time explaining the specials and how they were served, but that didn't matter. The cheese plate was tasty but at $20 I wouldn't get it again. The mussels were hit-or-miss. There has been quite a bit of praise for the chicken here, and three out of the four diners ordered it. Two had to send it back because it was raw near the bone, nothing like that taste of undercooked chicken! I got the pork shank, which was mediocre. The one thing that we noticed is the same we noticed when Jean was at Freeman's - the food is terribly underseasoned. The chicken and the brussels sprouts had not a trace of sea salt. The white beans with the pork were completely bland. Also, everyone keeps talking about what a great deal $15 chicken is...well it doesn't come with any sides - those are $7, and we found the overall prices to be a bit much for what we got.
