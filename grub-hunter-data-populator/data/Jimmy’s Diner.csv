"I actually got excited to write this review, because it meant somewhat re-living my meal at Jimmy's. Bryan and I were visiting his sister in NYC, and on our last day we needed to burn time before catching our flight home. Jimmy's sounded like the type of place we like to eat and we were damn hungry, so we pulled up a stool.Boy howdy, I am glad we did. The breakfast revolves around comfort food staples - grits, cornbread, handmade sausage, and more. I ordered two eggs with cornbread, cheesy grits, and handmade turkey sausage. It was my first time having grits (I know) and I was blown away. They were flavorful and weren't cooked for too long, so the texture was on point. Bryan had the Huevos Rancheros which were delicious as well. We also had two beers, but coffee from a local roastery is available too. Everything tasted really great. The space itself is very cool, but very small. Luckily, when diners are small it is often charming. The bathroom was clean and we didn't have to wait to be seated because it was a Monday. However, I could see this place getting crazy on the weekends. The service was OK, but didn't blow me away. Where we live, people behind the bar talk to you or even make eye contact. I understand it is NY, but the atmosphere was a little aloof. TLDR: Small diner, amazing cornbread and grits.",4.0
"I would give this place a 3.5 if I could. The food is solid. They have a great menu of southern/comfort type foods that are great for breakfast and lunch. But, while I did enjoy my breakfast here, I was a bit underwhelmed. First of all, the staff all think they're too cool for school and act so. Hey Mr. (Ms?) Androgynous hip looking person, nobody is impressed by your loose tight fitting ripped clothes and your smug attitude. You're chicken and waffles is good, but don't get too excited, I've had better. The waffle had a good mix of sweet and savory, but the gravy and the chicken were under-seasoned.I'm definitely willing to give this place another try. I just hope I don't get stopped by the cool police on my way in.",3.0
"Diners are a dime a dozen but Jimmy's is the whole she-bang!We brought out of town guests here and waited about 25 minutes to be seated at 11 AM on a Saturday, so nothing out of the ordinary (it was cold and rainy though).The place itself, is pretty small and some definite characters work there but they were helpful and friendly (just slightly stoned?).Food:Tater Heaven (2 orders): Not your traditional tater tot but home made and delicious. They are topped with surprisingly good guacamole, pepper jack cheese, onions, and scrambled eggs. When the dish comes out it appears small in comparison to some of the other dishes you may see but don't let it fool you, its completely filling and in fact I couldn't even eat all of it.Chicken and Waffles (1 order): The waffle itself was pretty good and the chicken was well cooked and well seasoned. It came with a topping of country gravy (which needed salt, but that is personal preference). I will say, I would prefer to have boneless chicken (I know the purists will shoot me for that) because when you are dismantling hot greasy fried chicken, you can make a mess. Crispy French Toast with fresh fruit (1 order): O M G! Well, I don't typically like sweet things for breakfast but this was amazing. It came with three pieces of french toast with some crispy topping but could have been fried dirt chips for all I care, it was amazing. The fresh fruit topping included bananas and blueberries, good combination. Two and a half of these pieces came home with us and were left once our guests returned home, I ate it for breakfast even after it wasn't all that crispy anymore, still awesome!Overall, Jimmy's Diner was a great place to visit. I like that it offered all of it's foods all day. I know that everyone in NYC is obsessed with brunch but don't people want access to lunch menus that they may not get to utilize if they are I don't know working M-F, just saying.Tip: Considering the place is nothing fancy inside, the bathroom is pretty clean! Nice surprise!",4.0
"Surprisingly enough my boyfriend and I both had this place bookmarked. He decided to take me here prior to us running my errands for the day. The first thing I thought when I arrived was I can't wait to get my grub on. There was a 15 minute wait so we decided to take a walk to the Farmer's Market down the street. It blew my mind that my apt is bigger than Jimmy's Dinner. That didn't stop us from plopping a seat at the bar and ordering a mimosa and lemonade. We ordered the chipotle chicken sandwich, tater heaven bowl, and a side of their cornbread. The food was delicious and very filling. From the chipotle mayo to the homemade tater tots, we were completely won over. The music was enjoyable and played at a comfortable level where you're still able to enjoy your company. The service was good and the staff is nice. My only concern is the soap dispenser in the bathroom. It's a upside down bottle with a nipple you press upwards to dispense the soap. I felt like I was stimulating something I shouldn't have lol.",4.0
"Southern comfort food smack in the middle of an odd block. Place is not huge so expect to wait a little bit. Steak and eggs with cheese grits was okay. Not much flavor to the steak and was a bit overdone, when we asked for medium rare. Cheese grits were not creamy but if it's because they didn't drown it with cream and butter... Thank you. The big breakfast had two eggs, pancakes and home made sausage with cornbread. Sausage had no casing so it was whack. Pancakes were not very fluffy. Cornbread was decent. Cash only. Second visit worthy? No thanks.",3.0

"Came here for breakfast and this is such a cute little diner. Reminds me of those tiny diners you run into when you're driving from New York to California. You know which ones I'm talking about? Oh, me neither...Anyway, had this bookmarked for quite some time and I was so shocked at the extensive menu that I just want to keep coming back here to try everything else.I chose the chicken and waffles but decided to have the gravy on the side. Might I thank God for that because I was not crazy about the gravy at all. HOWEVER, those waffles and the crispy layer of that chicken was very delicious. Also, for the price of the food here you're receiving great quality and quantity...yes...AT THE SAME DAMN TIME BABY! My dish was good but I'm so eager to try the other items on the menu. I'll probably never come here on a weekend for brunch though because that space is smaller than a bathroom stall SHEESH!Oh, the service is great too. Staff is very nice and the food comes out in 1,2,3.",4.0
"Oh man. I've been on a huge comfort food kick lately with restaurants in Brooklyn, and Jimmy's Diner hit the spot 110%.I'm a little terrified at what the wait for brunch may look like here on the weekends, but we had no problems for dinner on Sunday night. It's a super small, hole-in-the-wall type of joint, with a few sticky tables and stools at the bar (so don't come here looking for a space to feed your 15 closest friends).You should, however, come here intending to eat, and eat well. They have a ton of options, from hearty breakfasts to down-home comfort food and sandwiches. We tried a little of everything.+1 for the mac n cheese (nothing pretentious, but good), disco fries (extra crispy), and buffalo chicken sandwich (which I didn't try, but the side salad was good!). With my indecisiveness, I ended up getting the vegetable plate (your choice of 3 sides) with collard greens, grits, cornbread, and baked beans.Now I'm mad I filled up on fries and mac before the main event, because it was so. Freaking. Good. The collard greens were a little salty, but super flavorful with huge hunks of ham. It's pretty hard to mess up grits and baked beans, but those were delicious anyways, and the cornbread was perfect to soak everything up. Thank god for huge portions and leftovers, because I'm going to be enjoying Jimmy's for days.A table next to us got a huge stack of pancakes as we were leaving, so I think I'll have to come back and try those next. I only wish they took credit cards, so come prepared!",5.0
"Jimmy's diner has it all. From more brunch options than you could ever imagine to delicious sandwiches and burgers and boozy milkshakes, they've got it all. The restaurant itself is casual and pretty small, only one row of tables and then some counter space. The waitstaff is friendly. I ordered the chipotle chicken sandwich with a salad and really enjoyed it. The chicken was perfectly grilled with lots of melted cheese and delicious avocado slices. what really surprised me was the side salad, usually I expect something plain but Jimmy's side salad was not just your regular mesclun plus tomatoes with Italian dressing. It had delicious beets and other great fixings. The food was very filling, I ended up taking the second half home for later! Will definitely come back here.",4.0
"Among all the trendy restaurants in Williamsburg, Jimmys diner looks like a classic, old-school luncheonette. The location is very small but if there is a wait, it is worth it, because the food is amazing. They have a small but very creative menu. I ordered a 3 egg scramble which was kind of a frittata hybrid. Only complaint was there were ingredients I didn't order mixed up in my eggs. My friend ordered the tater top egg bowl thing and OMG IT WAS UNREAL. Comfort food at its finest. These were not tater tots like one would picture (from Napoleon dynamite) they were like nothing I've tasted before in the most amazing way possible. I will definitely be returning to try the lunch menu!",4.0

"Love this amazing comfort food spot that is located just around the corner from me.I've been here many times and tried many of their dishes and they are all tasty and very filling.

"I'll just break this down by the different things I've eaten hereMains:Fried Catfish: 5/5 - probably the best thing they serve here, fish varies in freshness though, large serving sizeFried Chicken: 4/5 - solid but occasionally dry, portions aren't the largestRoast Chicken: 3/5 - tender but a bit flavorless, skin can often be a bit rubberySteak: 3/5 - more or less your run of the mill diner steak, tiny portion, poor valueSides:Tater tots: 5/5 - My God these things are good, I shudder when thinking about their cumulative effect on my waistlineBaked beans: 4.5/5 - a bit too sweet with sometimes soft bacon, good consistencyMashed potatoes: 4/5 - good, all-around staple, could be improved by inclusion of gravyFries: 3/5 - fresh cut but often overly-greasy and gets soggy quickly, think similar to five-guysCreamed spinach: 2.5/5 - pretty meh, in their defense creamed spinach isn't really my side of choiceCorn on the cob: 2.5/5 - comes grilled which I think is unnecessary, ends up being a bit dry and loses the corn's inherent sweetnessCornbread:Cornbread: 3.5/5 - really good when it's good, unfortunately consistency is an issue and it comes burned about 50% of the timeSandwiches:Cowgirl burger: 4/5 - good, spicier than anticipated, a bit soggy and possibly too ambitious for one bunBuffalo chicken: 2.5/5 - buffalo sauce should be served on the side; chicken comes out a bit rubbery and the overall sandwich is soggyFood is solid overall but the two problems here are the prices and the service; value is only okay, portion size isn't bad overall but things like the steak and burgers are IMO definitely overpriced.The service however is probably the biggest problem with this place. Some of the staff is great and welcoming when you come in, but oftentimes the people on duty strike me as absent minded and uncaring. One waitress in particular has messed up my order multiple times (usually giving me fried chicken instead of the fried fish I ordered) and when I bring this up it's usually met with insistence that I'M the one who's made the mistake.

I had one bite of the tots, only because I was full from the ribs. They will make a nice snack later today! Been to Jimmy's a handful of times and will definitely be back for more!",5.0
"Came here on a Saturday at around 12:30 for a late breakfast. The place is almost easy to miss on this residential street. When we got there we peeked in and saw its tiny! There was a little bit of a wait, only ten minutes so not bad. It's an old school diner, one that should be featured in a movie that takes place in a small town. Their southern themed menu has a lot to choose from. I ordered the buttermilk pancakes, they were really good. They had a crisp outer layer and the inner layer has the consistency of a cloud. I was starving when we got there but the size of the three pancakes that come were huge so I could barely finish two. Plus the pricing is not bad. I would recommend.",4.0
"I've lived literally across the street from Jimmys Diner for like 5 years, can't believe I havent reviewed yet.This place is amazing.  The end.OK, want more?Its a super cool, very small spot kind of off the beaten path.  If you go on a weekend morning you will probably be able to find it by the small crowd of people waiting for a seat.  Rightfully so, as their food is great.  It's also indulgent, as it is mainly amazing southern-inspired breakfast sandwiches, breakfast bowls, platters, fried chicken and waffles, Po-Boys, chicken sandwiches, etc.  They also have amazing milkshakes, with the choice of throwing a shot or two in there if you plan on sticking around.The staff has always been super friendly.  I saw one post on here complaining that they didn't get checked on enough... It's sort of a casual place.  If you need something no one is going to be offended if you kindly flag someone down.If you know whats good for you, you will order the tots.",5.0
"This is place is a dirty, delicious diner. It's pretty hipster but the staff are really nice and the food is delicious.

That said, there are also really delicious and more unique options like the veggie hash (which I get every time) and other wholesome bowls filled with cornbread, melted cheese and guacamole. Options for everyone! I don't eat a lot of dairy or meat but I'm fulfilled every time.",5.0

"After walking from Soho to Brooklyn, we worked up quite an appetite. Glad to have stumbled upon this place. Since this was a tiny diner with limited seating inside, there was a wait. It was longer than we anticipated outside. But worth it. Unfortunately we were seated at the bar which was raised and not really suitable for people that area shorter but that's just me being nit picky. Anyways, the food was delicious for a great price! We ordered The Cowboy and the Pulled Pork Hash breakfast bowl. My mouth was watering looking at it the breakfast bowl. The dishes on the menu looked creative and every entree appeared to be less than $10. In addition the bloody mary's can't be beat. I do have to warn that it is CASH ONLY! But they do have an ATM available inside. The music playing overhead helped to creating a cool atmosphere to get breakfast.",5.0

"Huge fan. I went in with somewhat middling expectations after reading the reviews but I'm so glad I tried it out. Although the ambiance is definitively divey diner, I wouldn't call this diner food exactly....it looks more like they try to put their own twist on some of the comfort food classics, to great and tasty results. I got the Tater Heaven ($9) and ate every delicious bite. The place is cash only (or American Express, I think) but the price is right. I would recommend this spot if you're in the area and looking to break your diet or even for a designated food adventure in Williamsburg. We walked to the water to take in the views of the city afterwards so you can definitely make a day of it if Williamsburg isn't your every day haunt.",5.0
"We went for lunch today. The nice guy at the door told us 25 minutes but it was much less than that...maybe 15 minutes at most. I actually liked the way the diner looked. It looked like it could be a diner in a small town in the middle of nowhere...kinda gritty but I liked it. We had a comfortable table by the door. The only problem is it was scorching hot outside and the door kept on opening so it was pretty hot inside. There was not enough air conditioning. Everyone around us was fanning themselves. Breakfast is served all day which is awesome because you can go at anytime for their breakfast. We shared the Big Boy breakfast which came with 2 eggs, any style except poached (waitress told us we could not get it poached during brunch!), three slices of sausage (why only three? It was delicious though), pancakes, cornbread, and choice of grits or home fries, we picked home fries. And we also ordered the fried chicken served with plate that came with cornbread and two sides. We chose the homemade tater tots and sauteed kale. The sauteed kale was whatever.. Kale was still tough. What I liked a lot was the tater tots. It was more like...a fried mashed potato ball...crunchy exterior, soft inside..I liked it a lot. The chicken was okay. A little bland and overcooked so I wished there was more brown gravy. Small pieces of fried chicken. The cornbread was yummy and moist. The pancakes were also yummy. I usually do not like syrup on pancakes but the maple syrup here was yummy. The handwritten check said $13 and $13 for each dish, the math was weird...total was $28 but that's fine. CASH ONLY. Overall I liked the place and I would go back again. I just wish they had more A/C. And I wish the music was not sooooooooooooooooooooo loud. The prices are good for the portion size.",4.0

"Homemade tater tots!! Forget what you think you know about tater tots, the tots at Jimmy's Diner are amazing. We went for Sunday brunch around 11am and there was no wait. We had our pick of seating at the counter or a table. We sat at the counter and service was great. Our coffee (which I think I noticed was Stumptown if I'm not mistaken) was constantly topped off. I went with the Tater Heaven breakfast bowl which is homemade tater tots topped with sauteed onions, scrambled eggs, melted cheese & guacamole. This is my idea of comfort food.  It was perfectly filling without being an obscenely huge portion. I also got a mimosa which was a big glass full of mimosa with a straw. Don't let the word ""diner"" fool you. This place doesn't serve typical diner food.  It far exceeded my expectations. Cash only.  Breakfast served all day!!",4.0

"I could have sworn I wrote a review for this place a couple of years ago, but I guess not. Anyway, I can't rave enough about this place!

I don't think you can go wrong with anything you order here, but I would strongly recommend getting a dish which is special to this restaurant (fried chicken, tater tot bowl, special milkshake). This past Sunday I had the Heaven Tater Tot Bowl and a White Russian Milkshake (yes you heard me correctly). BLEW ME OUT OF THE WATER! The bowl was smaller than I recalled or assumed it would be, but I almost couldn't finish it (okay, maybe that was the fact I pretty much devoured the milkshake on my own, when I was supposed to be splitting it with my friend...he was too slow!) I cannot wait to bring more people here in the future! (My only complaints were 1) the bacon came out barely warm, which was weird, but it was a busy brunch hour, so I'll let it slide this time and 2) that the milkshake was a little too white for me and not enough kahlua, but I'll know for next time!)

"So after hearing about Jimmy's from a few different places I had to come and check it out myself.  Its a tiny place in the middle of a block in a residential area and you can easily miss it like i did.  Parking isn't to bad which is a plus. When you walk in it looks like an old school luncheonette. There is a wrap around bar  and a few tables to the left which one waiter handles with ease. Its dimly lit with a really chill atmosphere. Every time we go we are always seated immediately, but we can see there being a wait on all the time. Menu is pretty extensive and the first time went a little overboard. This place is not for the dieting type. Everything is touched with the fryer! So let's get down..Deep fryed deviled eggs was interesting. A tad dry. Super crunchy. Dipping sauce was a mayo with hot sauce which was delish. Grits with cheese was super creamy and delicious def something to get off the menu if you like grits.Fried pickles was a huge portion this was super good nice and crunchy and a great tartar dipping sauceMac and cheese with bacon this was another huge portion but it was amazing very cheesy with salty bacon Fried chicken and waffles the best ive had. Waffle was crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside chicken was great juicy. crust was crunchy and seasoned perfectly. Putting syrup on the chicken made it that much better. Fried Chicken platter with sautéed broccoli and tater tots this too was spectacular tater tots was crunchy and moist, flavored perfectly broccoli was garlicky goodness. There was a brown gravy that was so good on this i wanted more. Caramel milkshake OUT OF THIS WORLD delicious !! Heres my beef with this place.. They are kinda dirty.. They make you know it.. They take the butter off one table and put it on another same thing with the syrup. Kinda grosses me out. If they do that, what else do they do? Last inspection wasnt that great either..  So thats why I gave them 3 stars.. Its to bad.. Get your stuff together and I'll be back for your amazing food!!  :)",3.0

"This was one of those Greenpoint stops that I keep hearing about it, but I've always put off trying.Well, today I went in (Saturday morning around 9) and sat at the counter.  There was a small crowd of people outside, but I was seated without a wait because of the available single stool.  being single sometimes has its benefits.I ordered the 'regular' and a coffee.  The food was served quickly...  I must have gotten a hot plate within 3 minutes from ordering.  I was in and out quickly.  The cornbread was good.  The typical breakfast staples homefries-scrambled eggs were good.  I'm pretty satisfied with it and I intend to order something different next weekend.  Maybe takeout/delivery?",4.0
I came here for a quick bite after seeing the great reviews. The man behind the counter was very welcoming while the lady's that work here were a little on the standoffish side. I have the creamed spinach and mac&cheese as appetizers (which were not that great) and the chicken&waffels. The chicken was dry but the waffles were really good. I also had a Mimosa which was served in a tall glass (first time I drank a mimosa with a straw) but it tasted weird. I'm a little hesitant in coming back to this place because I caught a really bad allergic reaction and I am not sure why because all I ate was the food at Jimmys and I have had those things at other places before with no problem. If you're in the area I would recommend trying this place. My case might have been from an ingredient they use that I am allergic to buy I'm not sure what it is.,3.0

"This was one of those Greenpoint stops that I keep hearing about it, but I've always put off trying.Well, today I went in (Saturday morning around 9) and sat at the counter.  There was a small crowd of people outside, but I was seated without a wait because of the available single stool.  being single sometimes has its benefits.I ordered the 'regular' and a coffee.  The food was served quickly...  I must have gotten a hot plate within 3 minutes from ordering.  I was in and out quickly.  The cornbread was good.  The typical breakfast staples homefries-scrambled eggs were good.  I'm pretty satisfied with it and I intend to order something different next weekend.  Maybe takeout/delivery?",4.0
I came here for a quick bite after seeing the great reviews. The man behind the counter was very welcoming while the lady's that work here were a little on the standoffish side. I have the creamed spinach and mac&cheese as appetizers (which were not that great) and the chicken&waffels. The chicken was dry but the waffles were really good. I also had a Mimosa which was served in a tall glass (first time I drank a mimosa with a straw) but it tasted weird. I'm a little hesitant in coming back to this place because I caught a really bad allergic reaction and I am not sure why because all I ate was the food at Jimmys and I have had those things at other places before with no problem. If you're in the area I would recommend trying this place. My case might have been from an ingredient they use that I am allergic to buy I'm not sure what it is.,3.0
"I'm really big on diners and especially neighborhood spots dishing out good food for a reasonable price. Jimmy's diner delivered on most of that except for the underwhelming food. I ordered the Huevos rancheros which was okay, a bit bland for my taste. I also got to try their fried chicken which was moist and juicy but bland, adding some seasoning and hot sauce made it a lot better. Aside from that the staff was EXTREMELY nice and fit a group of 8 in less than 20 minutes when the place was packed on Sunday prime time brunching hours hahahaha. The place itself was nice and cosy and the music selection really rocked.",4.0
"Small place in Williamsburg with a casual ambiance and friendly wait staff. There was a long wait but after about 25 minutes, they managed to squish our party of 8 into the place. Pulled pork was delicious but the bbq sauce was a bit too sweet for my taste, the fried chicken was really bland actually despite the reviews. creamed spinach was okay and the cornbread was surprisingly good. The pancakes actually broke easily as I tried to cut it. Not a good thing. The sweet potato fries were okay (unevenly seasoned and some softer than others. The home made tater tots were really flavorful and tasted more like falafels to me but I really enjoyed it. Friendly neighborhood joint and a great bang for your buck.",4.0
"I absolutely hated the food here. Nothing had any seasoning, it was all disgusting to me and the country gravy turned me off. I thought the place would be bigger because of the photos uploaded, but when I went this place was a box. The waffle mix just tastes weird, and the chicken was fried nicely but had no seasoning what so ever. I asked for scrambled eggs, and the egg was no where close to scrambled. And the only way I wouldn't be charged is if I ate the egg the way they made it without sending it back. I didn't eat of course! But what kind of place is this. The food made me sick. I wouldn't recommend coming here for breakfast.",2.0
"2 stars for the food... ONLY! The service was horrible the ham was wayyyyy too salty and when told it was going to be switched the waiter checked on me only after HE finished EATING...

"An average diner. A group of friends and I decided to stop here for brunch during our July 4 weekend escapades. We were curious about trying something that felt a little rustic and homey.The service was amazing. We were treated so warmly, and the woman who assisted us with seating was so kind to put together multiple tables for our large group.The menu is simple. I tried the veggie omelet that came with home fries (and supposedly toast, but I never got that). The portion sizes were huge and the prices were so low, it was shocking!Overall, a simplistic dining experience... what you would expect from a diner. Don't come here if you are looking for high quality food. Rather, it's an interesting hole-in-the-wall experience with family-like treatment from the servers. Makes for a great morning.",3.0
"This place is pretty cute.  It's a lot smaller than I expected, but I really enjoyed the servers.  They were attentive and respectful.  I ordered the Tater Tot Heaven.  It was really different compared to the regular (soggy) tater tots you usually get.  These were fried to crisp perfection and the guac was amazing.  Not sure how I felt about the egg combination with those two, but I liked the onions too.  I wish there were more onions and less egg.  I was super full on the breakfast bowl that was only $9.  Yum-oh.The place is cash-only!  It's in a pretty strange area, with two big modern looking buildings near it.  I came on a pretty early Sunday morning so the wait was non-existent.  They could run out of space pretty quickly though.",4.0

"NOT A FAN AT ALL JUST BECAUSE OF THE SERVICE... And when I say the service it's the guy who gives your table. He was super rude - no manners.  I read some good reviews so I decided to take my friends there for a farewell brunch. We were 5 and the guy asked us if we were ok to share a table for 4. We told him that was ok but one of the girl was on her way and she will be with us in 5 minutes. He told us to come back in the 10 next minutes and the table would be ready. 8 minutes later I came back just back myself while the others were in a coffee shop and he threatened me:  ""you need to be all here in the next 2 minutes"". He stressed me out and I started to phoned my 3 other friends in the coffee shop and the fifth friend who was exactly at one block from Jimmy's diner. When the guy asked us if we were all there I told him. ""Yes"". He showed us the table, threw the five menu on the table like we were shit and then he realized that the last girl was still not here and got super mad: "" When I asked you if you were all here you should have told me no and not yes"". We asked him if it was a problem and if it was one we were ready to go somewhere else. He said in an annoying way: "" nooo"". It was not like we were taking a extra table because we were 4 sharing a table of 4 and we were just going to squeeze a bit for the fifth person. Anyway, when he finished his sentence, my friend opened the door. Like I told him, she was literally at one block from the restaurant.This guy was really annoying and he ruined the beginning of our brunch and we were ready to go somewhere else. but the good review about the food made us stay.

I ordered the Tater Tot Bowl which was super different. It came with homemade tater tots (which tasted like fried mashed potatoes), eggs with caramelized onions and cheese, and a glop of guac.

When we got in 20 minutes later, I immediately felt like I was in a genuine diner, although, it was smaller than expected. Great service. Everyone was friendly and they were really polite and cute. I got the chicken and waffle (if you know me,  obviously I would) and it was made well. It consisted of four pieces of chicken and a big round piece of waffle underneath. The  chicken skin had a crispy, flavorful texture to it. The meat was soft and it wasn't as juicy as I hoped but it wasn't dry. The waffle was a good tan color and looked like it was going to be your typical Eggo waffle in terms of texture but it was actually fluffy in the inside. The waffle was made perfectly. They also gave some gravy and syrup to go with it on the side. The gravy wasn't too flavorful, I must say, so if you do get bored of the chicken meat, I would suggest to dip that into the gravy to make it less dry or add syrup onto the chicken to give it some flavor. My bf got a pulled pork sandwich and I loved it. The meat was tasty and juicy! Mmmmmm. And the tater tots, spinach and mac and cheese were so yum too. Bring cash guys!!!

"Another cash only spot where the food is finger lickin' good. It's not a typical ""diner"" but a small kind of a hole in the wall joint that needs to noticed everywhere.

It doesn't sit a lot of people so be sure to wait a while when this place is busy.I ordered the chicken and waffles and my girlfriend ordered the tater heaven that had tots with guac, egg, onions, and cheese with a side of cheese grits. The chicken and waffles came with a side of gravy. The chicken was crispy and went well with waffle. I'm not a huge fan of heavy cake mix but this did it justice. I'm glad they put the gravy on the side but it wasn't the best I've had. Still, it complimented and went well slathered all over the chicken and waffle. Mix in some hot sauce, maple syrup, and butter and it was music to my ears. The cheese grits was the winner for the day. It comes in a fairly size bowl and two slices of cheese on top looks deceiving but in actually the surprise comes when you dig in and there's more cheese inside. Every time you grab some you'll end up seeing the cheese stretch like a spiders web. Be careful too because it's hot! The grits is creamy and with the cheese it was the perfect combination of how grits with cheese should be made.The tots heaven concoction is interestingly a heavy dish. The tots are like the size of hush puppies on roids. It comes in a small bowl looks like an appetizer but packs a brick. The tots were super delicious especially with the fresh guac and the scrambled egg fastened by the pepper jack cheese that gives that hint of spiciness.I love this place and wouldn't mind coming back here for more!",4.0

Chicken tenders on a bun with jalapeños and chipotle mayo?! My husband wouldn't even share. We came on a Sunday around noon and were able to get seated right away. It also is cash only.

"I have been here about 4 or 5 times in 2015. I visit Brooklyn frequently from the central NJ Shore, but I'm not your standard issue pain in the ass Jersey girl who thinks everything should be gushing with pork roll, Bruce Springsteen, Bon Jovi, and all the other overkill NJ shit. If I were, I might say this place is nothing like a diner- and it's too cramped and too dingy looking for my princess-y demands.But I'm not, so I love Jimmy's. I don't remember what the menu items are called, but the cornbread covered in eggs, tomatoes, cheese and whatever else is amazing. So are the huevos rancheros. So are their homemade tater tots. These are nothing like the tater tots you would find anywhere else. The tater tots are better than finally sitting on the toilet bowl when you've held your pee for hours. They're better than finally farting when your stomach is killing you and you are willing to soil your underwear if it means you'll have relief from the pain. They're better than finally finding the privacy to scratch a really itchy bug bite that's too close to your crotch to scratch in public. And they make the sausage themselves! I cannot imagine where their tiny sausage factory is in this little space. The is the best breakfast sausage I have ever had- but like any other sausage, if you stare at it too long and try and guess what ground up guts you are looking at, it could ruin the moment. This place serves alcohol- we have never tried their ""shake with booze"" but I'm sure it's delightful. We pondered playing a drinking game-- taking a drink every time:1. The waitress' ass is in your face. (This place is tiny and overcrowded)2. The host/counter guy calls someone ""dude.""3. People come in, ask how long the wait is, have a little committee meeting about whether to stay or go while completely blocking the already narrow path of the waitress.If we played, we would still be there, passed out and unable to move.",5.0

"This place is one of my favorites in Brooklyn. Service was amazing, even though we had to stand outside in the snow for a bit they definitely made up for it in other ways. The food was delicious! I had the waffle which was perfect. Soft on the inside, a little crispy on the outside. The tater bowl was delicious as well. My boyfriend had the pulled pork bowl and the French toast equally good. They ran out of the key lime pie....made me sad but other than that I'll be back.",5.0

"I really like this place. Good service, good food , good prices. But the only thing that really gets me frustrated is that it seams like they pick and choose time when and where they want to deliver. First time I ordered on Friday.

You guys need to step up your game when it comes to deliveries.",3.0
"So I remembered to post my photos 4 months back but never wrote my reviews from the 3 times I've been there. Oops.The first time I went to Jimmy's I had the French toast, wish I remembered how it was topped but when my date ordered the chicken and waffles ($13) I converted to the other side. Of the 3 times we've been there we never had bad service, granted it's been around 8:30 on a weeknight. This week we had the same outcome. It's pretty rare of me to have such a heavy meal at that time. "" Screw that""  says the devil on my shoulder, indulge, the calories are worth it.

"I have been here about 4 or 5 times in 2015. I visit Brooklyn frequently from the central NJ Shore, but I'm not your standard issue pain in the ass Jersey girl who thinks everything should be gushing with pork roll, Bruce Springsteen, Bon Jovi, and all the other overkill NJ shit. If I were, I might say this place is nothing like a diner- and it's too cramped and too dingy looking for my princess-y demands.But I'm not, so I love Jimmy's. I don't remember what the menu items are called, but the cornbread covered in eggs, tomatoes, cheese and whatever else is amazing. So are the huevos rancheros. So are their homemade tater tots. These are nothing like the tater tots you would find anywhere else. The tater tots are better than finally sitting on the toilet bowl when you've held your pee for hours. They're better than finally farting when your stomach is killing you and you are willing to soil your underwear if it means you'll have relief from the pain. They're better than finally finding the privacy to scratch a really itchy bug bite that's too close to your crotch to scratch in public. And they make the sausage themselves! I cannot imagine where their tiny sausage factory is in this little space. The is the best breakfast sausage I have ever had- but like any other sausage, if you stare at it too long and try and guess what ground up guts you are looking at, it could ruin the moment. This place serves alcohol- we have never tried their ""shake with booze"" but I'm sure it's delightful. We pondered playing a drinking game-- taking a drink every time:1. The waitress' ass is in your face. (This place is tiny and overcrowded)2. The host/counter guy calls someone ""dude.""3. People come in, ask how long the wait is, have a little committee meeting about whether to stay or go while completely blocking the already narrow path of the waitress.If we played, we would still be there, passed out and unable to move.",5.0
Great food. Only go if you have cash though.... Atm fee is more than any atmin the neighborhood.,4.0
"This place is one of my favorites in Brooklyn. Service was amazing, even though we had to stand outside in the snow for a bit they definitely made up for it in other ways. The food was delicious! I had the waffle which was perfect. Soft on the inside, a little crispy on the outside. The tater bowl was delicious as well. My boyfriend had the pulled pork bowl and the French toast equally good. They ran out of the key lime pie....made me sad but other than that I'll be back.",5.0
"Colin, Colin, Colin. I have nothing but amazing things to say about this dude. He's one of the coolest, nicest, most ill servers we've had anywhere.

They even covered me and my wife's meal because I mentioned our previous experience!",5.0
"I really like this place. Good service, good food , good prices. But the only thing that really gets me frustrated is that it seams like they pick and choose time when and where they want to deliver. First time I ordered on Friday. Next time I called for delivery I was told that they only deliver Monday through Thursday and time after that I was told "" we don't deliver to your address "". Come on now. You guys need to step up your game when it comes to deliveries.",3.0
"So I remembered to post my photos 4 months back but never wrote my reviews from the 3 times I've been there. Oops.The first time I went to Jimmy's I had the French toast, wish I remembered how it was topped but when my date ordered the chicken and waffles ($13) I converted to the other side. Of the 3 times we've been there we never had bad service, granted it's been around 8:30 on a weeknight. This week we had the same outcome. It's pretty rare of me to have such a heavy meal at that time. "" Screw that""  says the devil on my shoulder, indulge, the calories are worth it.

I had requested LIGHT ON THE BEANS, and my meal was 70% beans at least.  They made the corn tortilla in-edible and the eggs were not soft yolked and cold. the Pico-de gallo was bland, and the vinegar-shaker hot sauce on the table was clogged. :(  We also had the 'famous' homemade tater-tots. No.  Just no. It was a ball of moist breadcrumbs burnt in the fryer, and I could taste everything else that had been fried all week. Served with a mystery chipotle(?) maybe sauce... didn't match. My dining partner had the cornbread bowl.  A cube of cornbread in a bowl with an omelette and smothered in cheese.  Just lacked lustre. We also had a waffle, just as blah. just as cold.

We walked in and knew that we had found something special. The diner is small, a few tables and a counter. The guy who greeted us and took our order was really friendly. The menu is different and the food came out in about 7 min. The grits are awesome. I've had grits all over the south and these were every bit as good, if not better.

"Let me say off the bat that their MENU LOOKS AMAZING. I love how there's so much variety from burgers to snacks to sandwiches to salads, etc. And BREAKFAST SERVED ALL DAY? YES, PLEASE. I DON'T NEED ME A HANGOVER TO AGREE TO THAT!KALE CAESAR SALAD--A pretty MEDIOCRE HEFTY SERVING of salad. The CROUTONS were OLD, STALE, AND SOFT. There were NO OTHER TOPPINGS so it made the salad very BORING. Also, I think kale salads are a better complement with vinaigrettes because the caesar dressing made the leaves very DRY TASTING. The KALE also tasted a bit ROUGH AND RAW? Idk, maybe it was just me, but I've had better kale salads in my days. GRITS & EGGS BREAKFAST BOWL--I really like the idea of the breakfast bowl. Slap all your favorite fried, greasy things in a deep and cheap bowl and you'll be good. It's also an option I've never seen other American (Traditional) places do so it's nice to see the menu go off the beaten path. The GRITS were TASTY and WELL SEASONED. The scrambled EGGS were TOO OILY for me and there was nothing special about them besides the fact that my mom cooks them the same way? The SAUSAGE was DELICIOUS but I wished they sliced them a bit thicker! The bowl is small but DECEPTIVELY DEEP so you can definitely SHARE this! The food came very QUICK and the SERVICE was GOOD. Try a LEMONADE on a hot, summer day! So REFRESHING. Ask for the SPECIALS too...they had 3 specials that sounded very dirty south soul food that I wanted to try!

I had requested LIGHT ON THE BEANS, and my meal was 70% beans at least.  They made the corn tortilla in-edible and the eggs were not soft yolked and cold. the Pico-de gallo was bland, and the vinegar-shaker hot sauce on the table was clogged. :(  We also had the 'famous' homemade tater-tots. No.  Just no. It was a ball of moist breadcrumbs burnt in the fryer, and I could taste everything else that had been fried all week. Served with a mystery chipotle(?) maybe sauce... didn't match. My dining partner had the cornbread bowl.  A cube of cornbread in a bowl with an omelette and smothered in cheese.  Just lacked lustre. We also had a waffle, just as blah. just as cold. And last but sorry, not least - the coffee was awful.",2.0
"This place was exactly what we were looking for. We drove from queens to Williamsburg Brooklyn looking for a cool place to have breakfast. I thought we would just find one driving around, but after driving around in Williamsburg for 10 minutes I pulled over and turned to yelp. Jimmy's was well rated and .2 miles away. We walked in and knew that we had found something special. The diner is small, a few tables and a counter. The guy who greeted us and took our order was really friendly. The menu is different and the food came out in about 7 min. The grits are awesome. I've had grits all over the south and these were every bit as good, if not better. I highly recommend this diner.",5.0
"Amazing brunch, lots of food, great atmosphere. I got a giaaaaant breakfast sandwich, and my friend got the Tater Heaven, and honestly, even though i love BECs, she might have made the more delicious choice. I'm definetly coming back.",4.0
"Let me say off the bat that their MENU LOOKS AMAZING. I love how there's so much variety from burgers to snacks to sandwiches to salads, etc. And BREAKFAST SERVED ALL DAY? YES, PLEASE. I DON'T NEED ME A HANGOVER TO AGREE TO THAT!KALE CAESAR SALAD--A pretty MEDIOCRE HEFTY SERVING of salad. The CROUTONS were OLD, STALE, AND SOFT. There were NO OTHER TOPPINGS so it made the salad very BORING. Also, I think kale salads are a better complement with vinaigrettes because the caesar dressing made the leaves very DRY TASTING. The KALE also tasted a bit ROUGH AND RAW? Idk, maybe it was just me, but I've had better kale salads in my days. GRITS & EGGS BREAKFAST BOWL--I really like the idea of the breakfast bowl. Slap all your favorite fried, greasy things in a deep and cheap bowl and you'll be good. It's also an option I've never seen other American (Traditional) places do so it's nice to see the menu go off the beaten path. The GRITS were TASTY and WELL SEASONED. The scrambled EGGS were TOO OILY for me and there was nothing special about them besides the fact that my mom cooks them the same way? The SAUSAGE was DELICIOUS but I wished they sliced them a bit thicker! The bowl is small but DECEPTIVELY DEEP so you can definitely SHARE this! The food came very QUICK and the SERVICE was GOOD. Try a LEMONADE on a hot, summer day! So REFRESHING. Ask for the SPECIALS too...they had 3 specials that sounded very dirty south soul food that I wanted to try! Next time, I'm going to try the fried chicken for sure.",3.0
"Has that hometown - place that's kind of been there forever - diner feel. Reliable, a little shabby, tables closer together than need be. Dark, but cozy. Classic formica diner counter and stools if you are riding solo. Food is pleasantly good. Not greasy, quality ingredients. Interesting takes on old classics. Lots of spicy stuff on the menu if you're into that.Chill place for a good plate of eggs and a cup of joe. Almost 4 stars...",3.0

"This isn't your typical diner, because the quality is so much better.  However, prices are still incredibly reasonable.  I got the tater heaven (seemed to be the item to order based on others around me) which came with large perfectly cooked taters (fried but not greasy) as the base, eggs, guacamole, and cheese.  Great for breakfast or hangover spot :)  I tried my friend's fried chicken with okra and broccoli which also was pretty stellar.  They have fun milkshakes too for dessert like thin mint.It is small though so make sure to come on an off-day...with cash!",4.0

It had a crunch to it but it smelled a little burnt. I was baffled because again, so many people gave it such high remarks. Maybe you guys have never been to the south where a chicken and waffle meal is flavorful and the syrup isn't runny. I had a piece of my friends cowboy burger.... again, lacked seasoning. How do you go wrong in a burger? He asked for no jalapeños and guess what we find on the burger. Needless to say, we ate and left in under 30 min. I don't know if I'll revisit this place. I love a good plate of comfort food and this didn't do it for me. The service was also mediocre. The young lady lacked friendly customer service, it almost appeared as if we were bothering her.

"Jimmy's is great! Something for everyone and great staff. A huge group of us (9 when we arrived, 15+ by the time we left) came in less than an hour before they closed on Saturday night.

It was very flavorful, the egg still runny and the dish tasted great even after breaking the yolk and mixing it into the dish. One issue is the pork, it's not as soft as it could have been. The dish does appear kind of small but it is filling. I kind of wished it was served in a bigger bowl.I didn't get a chance to try The Big Boy but there is a lot of food on that plate. Really nothing special about this dish.The Chicken & Waffle was okay. I thought the gravy and waffle were a let down. Not much flavoring/seasoning in either components. The chicken was was moist, probably over fried but quickly became soggy because of the large amount of gravy that was put all over it. The waffles were also dry.The fried okra was okay, just felt too much friend stuff towards the end. I wish they did a little more twist to the dish. It's basically battered okra, nothing else. Very much one note.We also had a strawberry milkshake. Tasted more like a vanilla milk shake Barely any strawberries or strawberry flavor in it. Overpowered with milk.Service was excellent. They definitely have enough staff and they are attentive to your water level. Everyone is really friendly there. Also, the consistency needed to be more viscous. It tasted kind of water downed.As for the food, I think it's more of a solid 3 stars. I may come back and try some of their lunch dishes but I'd be hard pressed considering it's cash only and there are better places for the same price that accepts credit cards.If you're in the neighborhood, give this place a try but I definitely would not make a special trip to eat here.",3.0

But back to the food... the ""tots"" were delectable and the fried deviled eggs were pretty good.

Great spot for a speedy and deliciously crafted brunch.   Best tater tots I've ever had.   Egg sandwiches are hearty and delicious (I didn't need to order the extra side of homefries for extra filling).   Be sure to read the menus on the wall and on the specials board.   I unfortunately didn't see them until after I ordered; lots more fun entrées that are not on the menu.  Drinks are overpriced in my opinion.  The spiked iced coffee is a winner but the mimosas are nothing to write home about.   I wish I tried the eggnog milkshake with rum.,4.0
This place is a gem. MUST GO!!! MUST GO!!Totally worth the 30 min wait. CRISPY FRENCH TOAST!!! OMG!!! Banana milk shake!!?!?? Yes please!!!!The gravy is incredible. I wanted to take it home and pour it all Ova my woman. It was so tasty she let me.,5.0
First time dining here. We came here for brunch on a Sunday. It's an intimate space and service is great. Food is excellent. The only reason I am giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is because they will rush you the F out if there are people waiting for a table. I would return. CASH ONLY,4.0
"I'm a hard cookie to please, I'll admit that so my first interaction wasn't so great with the host, but then once seated my first time they were so funny without being hipster obnoxious.    My friend and I ate like pigs and enjoyed every minute!This second time beat out the first time for sure, this place is for people who want diner food reinvented with fresh wholesome ingredients!   Last time I had 3 servings of their in house sausage, this time I had both the bacon and the sausage while my husband had the pulled pork bowl.   What a freaking treat the pulled pork was.  You see this small bowl and you don't realize how piled high it is! I had the disco fries with a fried egg on top and lots of meat!   You MUST MUST get that killer bloody mary, I consider myself a bloody mary connoisseur and there's is among the best.    Go for the funny guys, stay for the food, come back for the excellent sausage and service!",5.0

"Oh Jimmy, you are so charming!Jimmy's Diner is what you might expect of Williamsburg, all the retro and whims, but sans the snottiness of ""hipper than thou"". The diner is small, with very few tables so it can get crowded very easily. Party of one or two will be seated fairly easy compared to bigger groups.So we asked for Jimmy's deep fried deviled eggs and pickled chips. I felt like a sinner when I was snacking on those. I felt like all the models of NYFW will line up to slap me. Our dining companion ordered Mint milkshakes and I was able to sample it. Oh Jimmy. These were hearty and quite delicious. The staff was so kind to us she bought rest of the extra shakes (almost half serving) from the blender cup for table to have. I must say that the two staff who waited us that day were super nice and friendly, they made me believe in Bedford Ave stop again.    I have heard/read that Jimmy's fried chicken are famous but I must say that theirs is not my taste buds' style. And the way they smother the chicken and waffle with country gravy goes against my preference of keeping my food with a crunch (gravy on the side please!).The shrimp and grits were delicious, note that they are spicier than your usual. The blackened tilapia with tater tots, corn bread and kale was great. I would definitely order that next time I'm here.Just so you know, Jimmy is Cash Only type of guy.",4.0
"Jimmy's Diner is a place to be. Enjoy some great food in an unpretentious setting in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Thanks to a nice introduction from Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive-ins and Dives on the Food Network, I was able to learn more about the signature dishes before I got there.They serve breakfast all day, which is a very good thing. I read some comments about the long brunch lines so I decided to get there around 3pm to have my late lunch... and I was able to find a seat by the counter. The service was exceptional and my hot coffee from Stumptown arrived almost immediately. The food menu was extensive and I wanted to try them all, but I ended up getting a Pull Pork Hash Bowl (pork and eggs are some of the signature food there.)The food arrived quickly and yum! The two fried eggs laying on top of pulled pork and hash were perfect, and the pulled pork was moist and flavorful. I was able to taste every ingredient which had a little kick in it, and the portion was generous.It was easy to judge the quality of the food simply by tasting the pulled pork and it was no joke. I definitely loved this dish.I'd love to come back and try the grits here because I love grits (fish and grits, shrimp and grits, etc.) and I would like to try the Elvis Waffle as well. This place is a gem, five stars!",5.0
"Long wait, but you'll definitely eat great!And don't worry, the wait seems to go by quicker than the estimated time. 45 minutes could easily just be 20 minutes.I ordered the scrambled eggs and grits bowl (cheese grits with eggs, sausage and cheddar cheese on top). It was delicious! While it seems like a small bowl of food, I couldn't finish it all on my own. The grits were cheesy and delicious and the abundant serving of cheese on top of the bowl made it even more of a comforting meal. The sausage was also great. Seems like this might also be good with bacon.Rusty ordered the chicken and waffles. The waffle was good. It was on the soft (not crunchy) side and slathered with tons of creamy white gravy. Extremely rich. The chicken WAS AMAZING. The skin was perfectly crunchy, while the meat was moist. I think the dish came with three whole pieces of chicken and we ate every bite.They serve Stumptown coffee, so don't forget to grab a cup. Or get a boozy milkshake. Yum! Despite the place being constantly packed, the service is pretty good. And if you forget that they're cash only, there is an ATM in the back. Can't wait to visit this place again. I definitely need to try the deep-fried deviled eggs!",4.0

Great spot for a speedy and deliciously crafted brunch.   Best tater tots I've ever had.   Egg sandwiches are hearty and delicious (I didn't need to order the extra side of homefries for extra filling).   Be sure to read the menus on the wall and on the specials board.   I unfortunately didn't see them until after I ordered; lots more fun entrées that are not on the menu.  Drinks are overpriced in my opinion.  The spiked iced coffee is a winner but the mimosas are nothing to write home about.   I wish I tried the eggnog milkshake with rum.,4.0
This place is a gem. MUST GO!!! MUST GO!!Totally worth the 30 min wait. CRISPY FRENCH TOAST!!! OMG!!! Banana milk shake!!?!?? Yes please!!!!The gravy is incredible. I wanted to take it home and pour it all Ova my woman. It was so tasty she let me.,5.0
First time dining here. We came here for brunch on a Sunday. It's an intimate space and service is great. Food is excellent. The only reason I am giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is because they will rush you the F out if there are people waiting for a table. I would return. CASH ONLY,4.0
"I'm a hard cookie to please, I'll admit that so my first interaction wasn't so great with the host, but then once seated my first time they were so funny without being hipster obnoxious.    My friend and I ate like pigs and enjoyed every minute!This second time beat out the first time for sure, this place is for people who want diner food reinvented with fresh wholesome ingredients!   Last time I had 3 servings of their in house sausage, this time I had both the bacon and the sausage while my husband had the pulled pork bowl.   What a freaking treat the pulled pork was.  You see this small bowl and you don't realize how piled high it is! I had the disco fries with a fried egg on top and lots of meat!   You MUST MUST get that killer bloody mary, I consider myself a bloody mary connoisseur and there's is among the best.    Go for the funny guys, stay for the food, come back for the excellent sausage and service!",5.0

"Oh Jimmy, you are so charming!Jimmy's Diner is what you might expect of Williamsburg, all the retro and whims, but sans the snottiness of ""hipper than thou"". The diner is small, with very few tables so it can get crowded very easily. Party of one or two will be seated fairly easy compared to bigger groups.So we asked for Jimmy's deep fried deviled eggs and pickled chips. I felt like a sinner when I was snacking on those. I felt like all the models of NYFW will line up to slap me. Our dining companion ordered Mint milkshakes and I was able to sample it. Oh Jimmy. These were hearty and quite delicious. The staff was so kind to us she bought rest of the extra shakes (almost half serving) from the blender cup for table to have. I must say that the two staff who waited us that day were super nice and friendly, they made me believe in Bedford Ave stop again.    I have heard/read that Jimmy's fried chicken are famous but I must say that theirs is not my taste buds' style. And the way they smother the chicken and waffle with country gravy goes against my preference of keeping my food with a crunch (gravy on the side please!).The shrimp and grits were delicious, note that they are spicier than your usual. The blackened tilapia with tater tots, corn bread and kale was great. I would definitely order that next time I'm here.Just so you know, Jimmy is Cash Only type of guy.",4.0
"Jimmy's Diner is a place to be. Enjoy some great food in an unpretentious setting in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Thanks to a nice introduction from Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive-ins and Dives on the Food Network, I was able to learn more about the signature dishes before I got there.They serve breakfast all day, which is a very good thing. I read some comments about the long brunch lines so I decided to get there around 3pm to have my late lunch... and I was able to find a seat by the counter. The service was exceptional and my hot coffee from Stumptown arrived almost immediately. The food menu was extensive and I wanted to try them all, but I ended up getting a Pull Pork Hash Bowl (pork and eggs are some of the signature food there.)The food arrived quickly and yum! The two fried eggs laying on top of pulled pork and hash were perfect, and the pulled pork was moist and flavorful. I was able to taste every ingredient which had a little kick in it, and the portion was generous.It was easy to judge the quality of the food simply by tasting the pulled pork and it was no joke. I definitely loved this dish.I'd love to come back and try the grits here because I love grits (fish and grits, shrimp and grits, etc.) and I would like to try the Elvis Waffle as well. This place is a gem, five stars!",5.0
"Long wait, but you'll definitely eat great!And don't worry, the wait seems to go by quicker than the estimated time. 45 minutes could easily just be 20 minutes.I ordered the scrambled eggs and grits bowl (cheese grits with eggs, sausage and cheddar cheese on top). It was delicious! While it seems like a small bowl of food, I couldn't finish it all on my own.

"It's a diner. In Williamsburg.

The other one with creamy spinach & mashed potato. They messed up the order by giving us the tater tots & mashed potato. The other one got the collard green & creamy spinach. Well, it didn't really matter that much to us because we don't mind sharing & eating from each other plate. This could've been annoying if say, we're not a couple because wouldn't want to eat from somebody else plate. The food was absolutely delicious.

We were definitely happy with our food. The portion is also pretty decent. Well, if you're starving & have a huge appetite, you'd better off going to Popeyes for the fried chicken because most likely you won't be full. The service was good, Our waitress was polite & friendly. The place is small but pretty cozy & comfy. We got there around 6pm & there was few people eating there.

"THUMBS DOWN! (which I rarely give)Does not quite live up to the hype when it comes to the food. As for the milkshakes, I give them credit for making a helluva good one. I came here on a Friday morning (day after the 4th of July) and arrived at this hole in the wall in Williamsburg. The restaurant is not surrounded by much and does not resemble a traditional diner when it comes to its décor. Fortunately, I was seated right away, but it was pretty crowded since it's a small spot and it just so happened that everytime a party arrived, a party left as well.Immediately, I knew the service was not going to be good from 1. The lack of it 2. The no nonsense attitude of one of the servers.  I'll get to that in a second. First, we ordered milkshakes (strawberry and banana) and an order of fried pickle chips. The 2 milkshakes were fantastic. The serving size is very generous with them giving you the glass cup and the rest of it inside the shake mixer cup. The flavors were very natural and the shake had a good thickness to it. As for the fried pickle chips, there's no easy way to say it, but it just wasn't that good. Basically, it was a fried pickle that was covered in a breading that was crunchy, but VERY VERY salty. It was a bit bland in any other flavors and the salt and oil dominated it as though they just used that to cook it!For entrees, the 2 orders we had were the Chicken and Waffles and Chicken Platter. What we thought were the 2 most popular dishes here. The Chicken and Waffles was draped in a country style type white gravy and the waffle was a decent size. The gravy was a bit ""old"" looking, as though it had been sitting on the chicken for a week. Once again, it was a bit salty tasting and honestly the chicken wasn't good. It wasn't crunchy and the meat was not real moist. Same can be said about the Chicken Platter. The platter came with 2 sides, so I got the tater tots and mashed potatoes. The tater tots were TERRIBLE! Yes TERR-RRIBLE! Tater tots at McDonald's and Burger King taste WAY better! Their tater tots were dry and the inside had the texture of a kanish. I'm a fan of kanishes, but not when it's supposed to be a tater tot! Plus, I could've gotten better chicken at Kennedy's or Crown Fried Chicken! No joke.As for the service. Our waiter just wasn't exactly Mr. Friendly. No ""Welcome"", ""Hello"", ""How are you doing?"", ""Goodbye"".  It was quite disappointing to see the ""unfriendliness"" here. Worst of all, some of their patrons aren't grown-ups either. You can make a case it's an exception, but I felt about 40% of their crowd was probably like this. While walking out, we almost dropped our leftovers, but saved it from falling, thankfully. An entire table of douchebag rednecks started belting out laughing like I had just tickled their gorilla hairy backs. Seriously? I should've shoved my leftovers down their throats and made them eat that horrible food.My final words are I do not recommend anyone trying this establishment. Food is not good. Service is not good.

Not sure what's in the sauce they give on the side but it's addictive. The grits were perfectly cooked and the whole meal was so filling and stomach warming.  Perfect place for breakfast food-- wish I lived closer to this joint. It's was a little small inside though so it's probably not good for large groups.  We were there on a weeknight and barely found a table so I can't imagine what it would be like during weekend brunch or lunch time.,4.0

"I'm going to have to be bias because I love tater tots.  That's an automatic +1 right there.I came here with 3 friends and my hubby one Sunday for brunch.  It was POURING out, and I was preggers.  YEP, mommies-to-be loves to eat!Service: 5It was pouring rain out and the host saw me and my unborn child standing in the rain with an umbrella.  He looked at my husband asked if we drove and where we parked.  We literally parked right in front of the place, so the host asks my husband to bring me back to the car and he will come get us when a table is ready.  +1 for going above and beyond for any customer.  We got a table in about 45 minutes, and the server was friendly.  He gave us some recommendations and checked on us a few times to make sure everything was okay.Food: 5Remember the +1 for tater tots?  Well, yes, it should of been a +2.  Jimmy's Tater Tots were AH-MAZING!!  I got the Biscuit and Sausage Gravy and it was freaking good.  Everything was just right.  I also got a vanilla milkshake.  You can't go wrong with milkshakes though!  I forgot what my hubby ordered because I was indulging myself in the tater tots.  I think he ordered waffles with fried chicken and gravy.  Ambiance: 5It is more of a hipster crowd.  The tables are spaced far apart enough so you don't feel like you are crammed into one another.  It was comfortable, and even though it was raining, it didn't have that damp air everyone dreads on the subway.Total: 5+5+5 15 / 3 = 5",5.0
"Awesome little hidden Gem!! I came here for breakfast with my boyfriend on New Years Day had to wait like 10 minutes to be seated but totally worth it. I ordered the French toast. Gotta say by far the best French toast I've ever had it had some kind of caramelized topping and my boyfriend ordered chicken and waffles which I'm personally not a fan of but he swears was amazing as well and we split the tatter tots which are by far not ordinary, those had to be the best part of the meal. Very fairly priced. Mom and pop type restaurant and cash only. Will definitely be returning soon",5.0
I really like this restaurant.  It's super casual and laid back.  The vibe is kind of a divey retro diner. The one guy who was waitering all the tables is amazing and so chill.  I got the grits and eggs and a side of hush puppies. so good. and the service is super fast.  The hush puppies are a must try. Not sure what's in the sauce they give on the side but it's addictive. The grits were perfectly cooked and the whole meal was so filling and stomach warming.  Perfect place for breakfast food-- wish I lived closer to this joint. It's was a little small inside though so it's probably not good for large groups.  We were there on a weeknight and barely found a table so I can't imagine what it would be like during weekend brunch or lunch time.,4.0
"Such a great breakfast! Yes, this is hipster owned and operated, but we saw other people in the restaurant besides us who didn't fit the demographic, so at least there's that. We got a breakfast bowl and sandwiches, and they were all fantastic. The grits were on point and though I felt like there was a bit too much cheese and not enough other seasoning on my bowl, it was definitely warm and comforting food. Cash only, but there's an ATM inside.",4.0
"What a super cute, nondescript diner in North Williamsburg!  Our small group of four came on a Saturday late afternoon, and were lucky to score a table with nary a wait.  Others that came afterward had to wait at least 30 minutes for a spot to open up for them.  So come early!  Even though this place is CASH ONLY, it hasn't deterred diners from seeking out their (for the most part), delicious menu items.I would definitely recommend the milkshakes, they are creamy goodness in tall glasses that will make an impression on your lips (and hips, yes, unfortunately).  At $5.00 a shake, they are ""meaty"" in the sense that they give you a lot of it, and the extra bit that doesn't quite fit in your glass will be given to you on the side with a spoon for scooping out the yummy bits.  I had the limited edition ""Thin Mint"" Shake, and needless to say, it was as epic as a milkshake can get (though it was a little lumpy IMO).Starters were a real delicious treat.  We all shared the fried pickles, and for the first time, I had deep-fried deviled eggs.  The batter was crispy, providing a nice shell & crunch to the soft, hard-boiled egg.  The sauce that accompanies both apps was pretty fantastic.  My entree was the blackened tilapia with a side of ""Jimmy's tater tots"", kale, and corn bread.  The fish was cooked nicely, though slightly crumbly, it was still delicate and flavorful.  Not sure what seasoning they use, but it was slightly too spicy for my palate, though I was able to finish it altogether.  The kale and cornbread were absolutely fantastic, the cornbread was the best I've had anywhere, though I could have maybe done without the tater tots.  I just felt carbo-laden at that point with all the fried, and battered items we had as appetizers, and there were a lot of tater tots in the entree.  Everyone else's dish was massive and appeared quite yummy.  I tried the bf's fried chicken + waffle, and sadly, I wasn't thrilled with it.I've never had chicken + waffles before, so I had set myself up for an almost religious experience the way I've heard people talk about how delicious this meal is when you finally try it.  But the country gravy atop the chicken was gratuitous and too sweet.  The texture somehow made me think of a softer version of fondant.  I didn't like how it practically caked all the chicken on the platter.  As for the chicken itself, the pieces were a little small, and the breading was sweet. I like my chicken to be savory, and the only one time I've ever liked sweet, fried chicken was the time I went to San Francisco with Rachel A. and we had Red Velvet fried chicken, which was excellent.  Otherwise, I'm not a fan of mixing sweet and savory when it comes to fried chicken.  And the last time I had fried chicken was a few months ago at Peaches Hothouse in BK, and that was SO epic that nothing since has come close.Prices are very reasonable (jimmysdinerbrooklyn.com), and you do get great value out of your meal at Jimmy's Diner.  On the downside, they are cash only as mentioned before, but line your pockets before you grab a meal here, and you'll do fine.3.5 Stars.",3.0

"This is a hip little place full of the usual neighborhood people, and the menu _looks_ really great.Unfortunately, our food didn't live up to the descriptions. The homemade tater tots were mushy and kind of mealy, the guacamole was on the old side (that sort of nasty, overly ripe flavor), and the fried chicken and waffles were several bad ideas compounded. Though there seemed to be a decent fry on the chicken, it was smothered in so much (bland) gravy that it was soggy pretty much immediately. The waffle is nothing special, but since it's not very crispy, it really soaked up the gravy. I mean, I wasn't expecting Buttermilk Channel level, but these are some avoidable mistakes. Super expensive bloody mary to top it off.So overall, cute place, and there are probably some better dishes on the menu, but what appeared to be the signatures left me underwhelmed.

"Literally the most filling sunday brunch I've ever experienced! Came here on one of the hottest days of the summer with an empty stomach and no expectations. It's a hole in the wall, like most spots found in Williamsburg. The server/host/whoever was super accommodating and sat us at the countertop while we waited for a table to open up. The menu's filled with comfort food items and everything sounded amazing. I ended up sharing the chicken and waffles as well as the regular breakfast with a friend. We also got fried pickles and disco tots to start. The disco tots are sooo good and unique. They came in large ball shaped potato things that were very croquette like but delish nontheless! The fried pickles were good and came with a side of chipotle mayo. Now getting to the mains, the waffle was fluffy and PERFECT. The fried chicken on top was all white meat which I'm not a fan of but they did their best to make sure it wasn't dry. The cornbread that came with the regular is one of the BEST I've ever had but their home fries were sub par. Some things were great, some weren't as impressive but worth a try if you're in the area.",4.0

One thing though: if you order this dish, you may want to consider requesting the gravy be put on the side. If not your getting it on your waffle. That's what I will do next time. The decor, along with the subtle ""backwoods"", folksy tunes in the background really made me feel like I was in somebody's grandma's kitchen in 1940s Georgia. I swear they're making moonshine in the back. I'd definitely come back. Although I'd avoid Saturday or Sunday, as I'm sure it gets packed and the wait is likely long.",4.0
I came here for breakfast. Great food. Great service. The waiter was super attentive. My only complaint would be the country ham was way salty but that's my personal preference :)  I would definitely come again and recommend to friends.,5.0
Great food! Nice location. Good to dine in the summer with McCarran Park right across the street.,4.0
"Waffles are amazing!Fried deviled eggs? Did they invent them? So good!Not a fan of these tater tots- more like homemade, deep fried, potato pancakes.Strawberry shake had good flavor, but not thick enough.3 1/2 stars",3.0
"YUM as advertised!  This place rocks! from the wait staff to the music playing to the fantastic brunch.  I am definitely going back. One gripe is the coffee being meh other than that, I love this place. We had the scramble eggs with choice of 3 ingredients. I got the guacamole, pulled pork, pico and jack cheese. It was awesome!. eggs were a bit over cooked but I didn't mind too much. I definitely want to go back for the chicken and waffles and maybe hit that place up for the burgers.",4.0
"I've been here about 5 times and every time is just as good, if not better than the first. The Chico Grande and Huevos Rancheros are great. Their coffee is from Stumptown and is delicious. The biscuits are amazing and if you have room, the chocolate peanut butter milkshakes are to die for! Prepare to wait because it's a small place but it is worth every second.",5.0
"On a Friday morning, after getting baked on my walk of shame, the munchies hit and I had the meanest hankering for breakfast food. My initial thought was to head to Kellogg's since I was on Metro but then I thought, if I'm going to spend money it might as well be something I'd be excited to eat and not just something that'll suffice. So I took to yelp and decided on Jimmy's. Jimmy's Diner has an extremely laid back, old diner feel. I sat at the bar and was promptly greeted by the bartender (who was  running the entire operation on his own and did so extremely well!). He was very knowledgable about the menu and very helpful. I wound up ordering the Biscuits and Gravy with a side of roasted Brussels sprouts both were amazing although I would've preferred if the biscuits and gravy were hotter. To drink I had the hot chocolate, probably one of the best I've ever had. Lots of whipped cream!! I also ordered the key lime pie to go. Also delicious although rather custardy and not as tangy as I prefer my pie. All in all, an amazing dining experience. I'll definitely be back for more!",5.0
Came here today for lunch with my grandmother and it was great. Love the old school diner look and the menu has really good selections. I had the cowgirl burger with fries and it was amazing! My grandmother had the Jimmy's burger with the salad and she loved it as well. I also had a chocolate milkshake and it might just be the best I've had in as long as I can remember. Definitely coming back for chicken and waffles!,5.0
"Literally the most filling sunday brunch I've ever experienced! Came here on one of the hottest days of the summer with an empty stomach and no expectations. It's a hole in the wall, like most spots found in Williamsburg. The server/host/whoever was super accommodating and sat us at the countertop while we waited for a table to open up. The menu's filled with comfort food items and everything sounded amazing. I ended up sharing the chicken and waffles as well as the regular breakfast with a friend. We also got fried pickles and disco tots to start. The disco tots are sooo good and unique. They came in large ball shaped potato things that were very croquette like but delish nontheless! The fried pickles were good and came with a side of chipotle mayo. Now getting to the mains, the waffle was fluffy and PERFECT. The fried chicken on top was all white meat which I'm not a fan of but they did their best to make sure it wasn't dry. The cornbread that came with the regular is one of the BEST I've ever had but their home fries were sub par. Some things were great, some weren't as impressive but worth a try if you're in the area.",4.0
"Will definitely come back, for there buffalo Shrimp and maybe the chicken and waffles but, will take the food to go. It's a very small place and your almost elbow to elbow with the people eating next to you.",4.0

"As a huge lover of southern cuisine and dive-y diners, I was very excited to try this place out. Unfortunately, there were a few problems that will most likely prevent me from going back. The food left much to be desired, the service was poor, and the place in general seemed slightly grimy and dirty (which some other yelp reviewers agreed with). I ordered the fried pickles (which were actually pretty great, and the sauce that came with it was great as well) and the vegetarian biscuits and gravy. I noticed on the menu that you can have eggs any way your heart fancies with an order of biscuits and gravy so I ordered scrambled eggs as well. When my order came out, the scrambled eggs were on top of the biscuit with gravy smothered over the biscuits and the eggs. Since the menu said an order of eggs would be on the side, I thought they would be separate from the biscuits and gravy, as this is pretty standard. Low and behold, it wasn't that tasty and the biscuit was cold in the center. The service seemed a bit wonky, but maybe it was a bad night. I ordered a moscow mule however my waitress brought me the wrong drink (a vodka lemonade) and while that's not quite what I ordered, she was nice enough to give it to me for free, since she got the order wrong. My experience wasn't terrible but it wasn't good enough to return, which is a shame because I love the concept. Hopefully it was just a bad night!",2.0
"CASH ONLY (but atm inside)Seriously my favorite place for breakfast (served all day) that's veggie friendly. Every single time I've gone there (& ordered delivery) the food was freakin perfect.

"I'm truly sad that I absolutely hated this place. I researched it on Yelp for a week before I went and ended up being so very disappointed. This place gets 1 star ONLY because their food quality is good; quality, not flavor. It's fresh, nothing tasted stale or reheated, so that's where the positives end. My biggest problem is with the service and the restaurant's atmosphere. I immediately felt uncomfortable upon sitting down, so much so I thought about leaving and going elsewhere, I regret not listening to that gut feeling. I was addressed by 2 different servers one after the other, the male one asking us if we were ready to order within seconds of sitting down. While they were nice and all, something seemed terribly off about them and this place in general, again I did not feel comfortable or welcome, we both felt out of place. Then they had this God awful music blasting, which didn't help me feel like I could relax and enjoy my meal, and I didn't. It sounded like what the employees wanted to listen to with no regard to the customers. Sometimes a different song would come on and it would be REALLY loud and it made me jump the 3 different times it happened in a 20 minute span, yet they failed to correct it. When the servers weren't helping anyone, they just ran their mouths loud and non-stop at the counter with personal conversations. I'm sorry but, I'm not trying to hear that stuff so close to my table when I'm trying to have a meal. This place is horribly cramped, they try to shove too many tables so close to each other that to move around means to push over the condiments that are on them. And those tables, they're filthy and they wobble. How annoyed would you be if you were picking at your food and every time you put the fork down or grabbed a bite, the table rocked...? Super annoying. Now onto the food. I ordered the pancakes and their homemade tater tots. I was craving potato of some kind, especially tater tots, so I was excited to try their version... huge mistake. The ""tater tots"" weren't tater tots at all. They didn't even taste anything like potatoes, I was shocked. They tasted like croquettes, which is what they should call them, but still no potato flavor or texture anywhere. I had to get potatoes somewhere else after leaving here...sad. The dipping sauce they came with was good though. The pancakes were good, but they were HUGE, I did not notice that from yelp photos, and you get 3 of them. I could only down about one of them and my boyfriend finished another, while the 3rd one went uneaten. The syrup provided was shockingly sweet and I had to scrape it off. I tried the mac & cheese my bf ordered and it was good enough, nothing spectacular. When we were done, we couldn't pay and leave fast enough, I couldn't stand the horrible loud music and awkward atmosphere. While we were full, we both complained of being hungry, simply because our cravings were not met at all. Some advice to the owners; focus on the customer, it seems like this place is run to suit the servers and other employees while inconveniencing the people who come in, pay you money, and keep you in business. The environment alone is enough to stop me from coming here ever again and I don't recommend that anyone else does either. Maybe if you're drunk or hungover, you won't mind, maybe.",1.0
"This is why I love Yelp. I'm not super-familiar with Williamsburg when it comes to brunch places. Yelp assured me this would be lovely. And it was.

Running back and forth in a frantic huff. Just a crashing, dashing wreck. It was distracting, period. She let us see her sweat, to reference an old TV ad campaign. Get off the cross, sister.

"This is a place you only need to try once. I made the mistake of going twice.

That's my fault because I have a disorder where I have to eat everything that's in front of my face.  If I'm hankering for some fried chicken for brunch, I'm better off going to Peels in the East Village and nooshing on the fried chicken biscuit, which is the perfect portion. But then again, Jimmy's is a diner and for diner fare, it does ok.My second visit to Jimmy's Diner the service was deplorable. I ordered the Elvis waffles, which again, was a portion too big for one person. You would think I would have learned my lesson from my first Jimmy's visit but alas, I ate myself silly again.

Definitely not enough on the plate to split four ways, but i definitely enjoyed the each of the four spoonfuls i got. Everyone was super pleased with their main course except for me. I got biscuits and gravy. The gravy was delicious, the egg was cooked well but the biscuit was a little lackluster. It was too dry which didn't lend to absorbing the wonderful gravy.My meal specifically was not 4 stars, more like 3. But the overall experience was warm and welcoming.",4.0

"I wish that there were words available in the English language to express my pleasure at finally dining at the infamous Jimmy's diner-but there aren't. So I will settle for using the limited ones I know.First-yep all these people aren't lying, the wait can be bad if you get there when all the young folk are just waking up from their drink n' drug binges. But-its very close to a lovely park and several small plazas with benches where you can idle away a bit of time if your wait is extra long. I went around 1 PM after being held up, and we had a 40 minute wait, but when I left around 2:30 it seemed to be getting much shorter.Then-the food. Granted, I was on my deathbed when they finally wheeled my sister and I in, but it was really solid, good, hearty food. The kind that sticks to your ribs and makes you feel like you're doing something right in life. Go ahead and pat yourself on your back. You deserve it. Anyway we got chicken and waffles (get the gravy on the side, they give you legit maple syrup. None of that ""pancake syrup"" business) and the pulled pork breakfast bowl with a side of cornbread. The waffle wasn't too soggy, and the chicken was well fried. It lacked seasoning though so don't be afraid to put some hot sauce and swirl it around in the gravy. Which in retrospect is so thick you probably won't be doing much swirling.The pulled pork bowl though, was genius. My sister doesn't even usually like pork unless its bacon, and she was head over heels for it. We thought we had hit the jackpot until the table next to us ordered a milkshake and put our meal to shame. Next time.The service was good, and brisk. They refilled my mint tea as we went along, and despite it being busy no one seemed frantic, which was nice. My only, single gripe was that our cornbread (while moist) was a little burnt on the bottom. Otherwise, my experience at Jimmy's was hands-down one of my best breakfasts ever.",4.0

"The heavy-hitter-game-changer? Tater heaven. A perfect combination of guac, tots, onion, and cheese. I split that with chocolate chip pancakes as my friend and I danced in our seats to the throwbacks circa 1998 (read: destiny child, ja rule). It was a happy place. Definitely worth the wait and in my experience, they over estimate the time by a bit. If they say 30 it has been more like 20 in my experience which I REALLY prefer to saying 20 when it's really 30. Keepin it real Jimmy's. I dig.",5.0
"This is a place you only need to try once. I made the mistake of going twice. My first visit to Jimmy's Diner I ordered chicken and waffles which was ok but I stuffed myself silly and felt guilty the rest of the day. That's my fault because I have a disorder where I have to eat everything that's in front of my face.  If I'm hankering for some fried chicken for brunch, I'm better off going to Peels in the East Village and nooshing on the fried chicken biscuit, which is the perfect portion. But then again, Jimmy's is a diner and for diner fare, it does ok.My second visit to Jimmy's Diner the service was deplorable. I ordered the Elvis waffles, which again, was a portion too big for one person. You would think I would have learned my lesson from my first Jimmy's visit but alas, I ate myself silly again. It wasn't mind blowingly delicious; It was just in front of me and I was bored. Definitely go during a weekday when there aren't any crowds or wait time.",2.0
"I was here the other night with three friends. I believe they had all been before but it was my first time.Off the bat, it was a really cute space. The menu was full of really good options. Breakfast all day is a sign of a great establishment.We split a mac & cheese right off the bat. It was great. Definitely not enough on the plate to split four ways, but i definitely enjoyed the each of the four spoonfuls i got. Everyone was super pleased with their main course except for me. I got biscuits and gravy. The gravy was delicious, the egg was cooked well but the biscuit was a little lackluster. It was too dry which didn't lend to absorbing the wonderful gravy.My meal specifically was not 4 stars, more like 3. But the overall experience was warm and welcoming.",4.0

"I wish that there were words available in the English language to express my pleasure at finally dining at the infamous Jimmy's diner-but there aren't. So I will settle for using the limited ones I know.First-yep all these people aren't lying, the wait can be bad if you get there when all the young folk are just waking up from their drink n' drug binges. But-its very close to a lovely park and several small plazas with benches where you can idle away a bit of time if your wait is extra long. I went around 1 PM after being held up, and we had a 40 minute wait, but when I left around 2:30 it seemed to be getting much shorter.Then-the food. Granted, I was on my deathbed when they finally wheeled my sister and I in, but it was really solid, good, hearty food. The kind that sticks to your ribs and makes you feel like you're doing something right in life. Go ahead and pat yourself on your back. You deserve it.

Both times I have been there, I've had to ask for more coffee or water several times before getting it, wave the waiter down for a check after not being checked on for a while, and generally did not feel very ""taken care of.""

The pancakes.Let me explain. I NEVER order pancakes anywhere, unless they come with the meal, like they do with the Big Boy. Even then, I usually eat everything else first and push the pancakes to the side. My boyfriend then usually eats them. But when they came out today, I noticed immediately that they were different from your typical anemic diner pancakes. They were dark, not overly pale like pancakes sometimes are. They were extremely crispy. And they smelled like butter.I make pancakes at home a lot, and they're the only ones I eat, and here's why: I like my pancakes to be super crisp on the outside, and fluffy on the inside. They must be pan fried in a large amount of butter so that crisp exterior soaks up all that good buttery flavor, and that fat is extremely important for that crispy edge.I put some more butter on, poured on that real maple syrup, and dug in. And damn, was it good! The best pancakes I've ever had in a restaurant. I made everyone else at the table try them (my boyfriend and his two friends) and everyone else agreed that they were some damn good pancakes.Everything else on my plate was good to decent, but those pancakes really stole the show.

Add a soda and a bloody mary (which my gf said was very tasty) and the check was less than $40.We both walked out of there very happy. Jimmy's is what a lot of places are trying to be. It looks and feels like a cool little luncheonette in the south. They played blues on the radio, which really added to the overall feel. I can't recommend Jimmy's enough. I'll definitely be going back. Not even the white guy with dreadlocks sitting at the next table could ruin my experience.",5.0
"The OJ was not freshly squeezed. Had I known that I would have skipped it and gone for water. My sister had a breakfast sandwich on a hamburger bun that burned the roof of her mouth, but she said it was ""great."" I had a waffle with blueberries and bananas. It was good but plain. I also had a side of thick but bacon. It was to die for. Bacon is so good. This place is the tiniest diner in the world. It's food is plain and straight forward, so don't expect any frills or excitement that you can't create in your own kitchen at home. And they only accept cash, so I hope your wallet is full.",3.0

"Williamsburg has a lot of places that aim to be homey and unpretentious, but can't resist the urge to upscale-efy.  Not Jimmy's.  It's still small, crammed, and not looking to impress you with the artistic beauty of their brunch dishes.  In fact, some of the best items come jammed into deceptively small-looking bowls.What matters here is the food, and it's delicious.  Loads of yummy options for carnivores and vegetarians alike, and so many cool specials that you could come daily and get something new every time.  Service was quick and efficient (not goopy-friendly but totally fine).  Will be back next time we're in town.",4.0
"Jimmy's is the epitome of a hipster run and frequented business and despite my disapproval of hipster culture they do a couple things right here. They make everything from scratch, have local beer on tap, and the prices are cheap (meals are $8-12). They do deliver and have lunch but you can always order breakfast. Even though I didn't enjoy my meal here I still like Jimmy's as a whole enough to definitely come back for a second try. I had the biscuits and gravy for breakfast and found it to be extremely bland. When you take a biscuit, top it with scrambled eggs, and a very basic white gravy (which by itself is almost tasteless), nothing has a real bold flavor, in fact the texture isn't that interesting either, that's why the gravy that goes on biscuits is almost always mixed with pieces of sausage and seasoned with just enough pepper (sadly, not here though).

One bite of the munchkin left me giving sweet kisses for the rest of the day.Once I saw Chicken & Waffles, the rest of the menu went blurry and I closed it hastily knowing that's what I wanted. $12 for really well seasoned fried chicken (3 pieces), gravy that I could have drank as a beverage and crispy waffles with light syrup (butter optional). Simply amazing.They have 4 beers on tap and can make standard cocktails. It wasn't too busy when I came in but the service was friendly and courteous. I didn't feel like a customer, more like a friend.Be careful not to trip when entering the bathroom as there is a step but they wouldn't judge you anyway.***CASH ONLY***",5.0
"I'm having a moment with my breakfast bowl. I had to take a break because I'm full. But, I don't want to give up the moment. I will finish these two other tater tots. Yes, those ones smothered in pulled pork, spinach, and drippy fried eggs. I even cut each one up into quarters so as to force myself to savor every last bite.This moment joins the ranks with the steak and eggs and home made sausage. I don't eat gluten or lots of dairy, so my options seem limited. But, they're not. This is a place I'm building a long lasting relationship with. They make modifications. They added spinach to this pulled pork breakfast bowl. My arteries feel better.",5.0
"I came here for brunch with some friends.  Prepare to wait for seating when you come here, but it is well with it. I had the fried chicken and waffles which were like a heavenly party in my mouth. These were the best Belgian waffles I have ever tasted! Everyone in my party loved their food and the serving sizes are quite large, so prepare to eat. The staff was very friendly and kind. Will definitely be back her soon!",5.0
"So I went here last Sunday after church. You have to come here early because the place is small. Aside from that the food was surprisingly good. My fiancee had the signature chicken and waffle with the gravy and I had a corn bread bowl, with a side of thick cut bacon. I liked his meal better. Yes I had to taste his.  Pretty damn yummy.  My cornbread bowl was ok. I could have made my eggs and cheese, tomato topping myself. Bacon amd the cornbread  was money though :). They have some other dishes I'd like to try, so id definitely come again. Staff was friendly and attentive enough. Overall I felt it was decent but a bid pricey. We spent $40 including 2 coffees and tip.  I dont like to spend anymore than $25-30 for breakfast.",3.0
"Our waiter/host was awesome.  The coffee was great.  We got an order of fried deviled eggs to split and we each got chicken an waffles.  I think the gravy could've been a LITTLE better, but damn those waffles were delicious.  The space was tight, but I'm pretty sure it's about the same size of any other restaurant in Brooklyn.  The wait wasn't bad, considering we were waiting almost an hour for Pies n Thighs.  Glad we opted out and came here, totally worth it!!

"Great service and awesome food!  I loved the environment of this place.  It felt like I went back in time for breakfast.  My only complaint is that they didn't offer omelets for breakfast, but they did put together a nice egg white scramble for me which did the trick.  Definitely worth checking out.",4.0
"Had the chicken and waffles. At 11 am on a Saturday the wait was only about 20 min in the sun. Waffles were soft not crispy. Depends on what you prefer - but the batter was muy delicioso. The chicken was also superb but one pice was kind of purple. And so I sort of felt carnal in a bad way while eating it - taking in the pain. Reconsidered returning to a vegetarian diet for a moment.

I love the food and have been willing to overcome the long wait, but after this morning I will never return. I will miss you.I arrived at Jimmy's this morning and put my name down. The host told me the wait would be 45 minutes for 3. We waited just outside, like you're supposed to, as there is nowhere to wait inside. Accuweather said the RealFeel this morning was 9 degrees. After freezing outside for 35 minutes another party of 3 showed up and put their names down. Moments later the host came outside ushered the new party in. I noticed that there must have been some sort of mistake and went inside to ask the host. I said that we' been waiting for 40 minutes and these people just got here and so on. I was very calm and polite. Rudely the host responded, nearly shouting, and asked me if I thought he was lying or didn't know how to do his job. I replied that it was nothing like that, and that I didn't know why he was taking that tone with me. I even said I sometimes make mistakes at my job too and it's not a big deal. He barked at me that if I can prove to him my name is next on his list they will wait outside in the cold and I can come inside to the warmth. I reiterated that I wasn't suggesting he did this out of maliciousness, and that I still didn't know why he was speaking to me this way. In the end I left and went to eat brunch as Allswell. Delicious, down the street, and appreciative of their customers. There was no wait and I wasn't required to wait in the freezing cold.I would consider going back somewhere if they mixed up my order, or overcooked my eggs: those things are mistakes. I'd even consider going somewhere again after they accidentally skipped over me on the wait list, but there is NO WAY that I would go back to somewhere after they are rude and straight up mean to me. I don't know what was wrong with that guy, but when I think that money from my pocket almost went into this individuals bank account it makes me sick. This may be beyond necessary, but is honest: I give money to many causes in hopes that it will turn the world into a better place. The kind of place my kids can be proud to inherit. No matter how good the scramble and grits are, there is no way I will ever give this establishment my money again.

"It's been mentioned before, but this place could easily be missed on a walk-by. I think it took me walking by it three times on Union to actually notice it existed, but when I did I thought ""hmm, check this on yelp, see what's been said."" A crappy, rainy, hungover Sunday morning comes along and I'm thinking ""grits, potatoes, eggs, coffee, n o w.""A quick walk from my place and I'm immediately seated in this kitzchy lime-green interior, coffee landing on my table with some gratis cinnamon sugar donut holes. I already took a gander at the menu prior to coming over so I had a pretty good idea that I wanted the ""Big Boy."" Pancakes, eggs, potatoes (I opted for the tater tots recommended by someone else here, I strongly recommend you do the same), cornbread, and bacon. The tater tots are f'ing incredible. Think about hushpuppies and hashbrowns having a love child that was the best of both worlds. The cornbread was mighty tasty as well. Eggs, are eggs, I ordered them over medium and they came over medium. Couldn't have asked for anything better.Unless you're a good bit more talented at gluttoness inhalation of carbs it's absolutely impossible to clear your plate, so next time I would opt out of the lackluster pancakes. The only other negative mark I have is due to my orange juice being brought in a plastic store-bought bottle. Just found it odd.Other than that the food was perfect.The seating was a little tight but not uncomfortably so, our waiter was a bit lacking in the personality department but I think that was due to social awkwardness. The other waiter was plenty friendly and outgoing though. The menu is gloriously stocked with all kinds of interesting potato-egg-guac-gravy-meat combinations and I'm sure I will be a regular bruncher here. Oh, and cost... Two breakfasts, coffees, OJs, for $30 and we went for the most expensive plate on the menu. You could easily skate out of here on $8-10 per head. A solid four stars.",4.0

"pulled-pork-hash-for-the-mutha-f%&#in-WIN.I Love Jimmy's Diner.  Home-y southern cuisine, everything made from scratch, local beers, and olde tyme decor.  Take the expression, ""right up my alley"": it's as if they have found said alley, and somehow constructed a super cute southern diner inside that proverbial alley.Their front window claims to have ""the best fried chicken in brooklyn"", which I have not yet checked the validity of.  However, I can vouch for the breakfast through and through.  I will report back once their fried chicken claim has been properly taken into consideration.but for now......i leave you with this:Pulled. Pork. Hash.UPDATE!:  I tried the fried chicken, and it was absolutely amazing.  I don't know if i can say it is the best in brooklyn, but it is definitely up there.  For $12 you get 3 pieces of chicken, smothered in gravy, 2 sides, and cornbread.  I went with sweet potato fries and creamed spinach.  splendid meal, highly recommended.",4.0
"This review is long overdue, but first and foremost, I'd like to thank Yelp for helping me find this little gem in Williamsburg. I was in town visiting a friend and wanted a good -yet reasonably priced - breakfast. The first time I went here (Yes, I went two mornings in a row. Don't judge.) I ordered the yogurt with granola and berries. The portion was huge, but the yogurt was creamy and the fruit was fresh, I really think more breakfast places need something like this on the menu. We ordered a round of tots for the table and they were magnificent. My beau had the three scrambled eggs platter with a side of cornbread (more like pound cake). I don't remember what I got on day two, but I do remember that it did not disappoint and we ordered double the amount of tater tots. A few quick tips - Jimmy's is cash-only (as are many Brooklyn spots I learned). Also it tends to get busy on the weekends so you may have to wait for a table if you don't get there before 10 a.m.",4.0

"It's been mentioned before, but this place could easily be missed on a walk-by. I think it took me walking by it three times on Union to actually notice it existed, but when I did I thought ""hmm, check this on yelp, see what's been said."" A crappy, rainy, hungover Sunday morning comes along and I'm thinking ""grits, potatoes, eggs, coffee, n o w.""A quick walk from my place and I'm immediately seated in this kitzchy lime-green interior, coffee landing on my table with some gratis cinnamon sugar donut holes. I already took a gander at the menu prior to coming over so I had a pretty good idea that I wanted the ""Big Boy."" Pancakes, eggs, potatoes (I opted for the tater tots recommended by someone else here, I strongly recommend you do the same), cornbread, and bacon. The tater tots are f'ing incredible. Think about hushpuppies and hashbrowns having a love child that was the best of both worlds. The cornbread was mighty tasty as well. Eggs, are eggs, I ordered them over medium and they came over medium. Couldn't have asked for anything better.Unless you're a good bit more talented at gluttoness inhalation of carbs it's absolutely impossible to clear your plate, so next time I would opt out of the lackluster pancakes. The only other negative mark I have is due to my orange juice being brought in a plastic store-bought bottle. Just found it odd.Other than that the food was perfect.The seating was a little tight but not uncomfortably so, our waiter was a bit lacking in the personality department but I think that was due to social awkwardness. The other waiter was plenty friendly and outgoing though. The menu is gloriously stocked with all kinds of interesting potato-egg-guac-gravy-meat combinations and I'm sure I will be a regular bruncher here. Oh, and cost... Two breakfasts, coffees, OJs, for $30 and we went for the most expensive plate on the menu. You could easily skate out of here on $8-10 per head. A solid four stars.",4.0
"Had a wonderful breakfast and would recommend.  I had the highly raved about homemade tater tots, eggs and guacamole.  Wife had the eggs, grits and sausage.  Served Stumptown coffee to top things off.  Looking forward to our next visit to come back here.Just so no one is surprised, it's cash only and opens a bit late (at least for us) for breakfast at 9:00 a.m.  Was worth waiting for.",5.0

"pulled-pork-hash-for-the-mutha-f%&#in-WIN.I Love Jimmy's Diner.  Home-y southern cuisine, everything made from scratch, local beers, and olde tyme decor.  Take the expression, ""right up my alley"": it's as if they have found said alley, and somehow constructed a super cute southern diner inside that proverbial alley.Their front window claims to have ""the best fried chicken in brooklyn"", which I have not yet checked the validity of.  However, I can vouch for the breakfast through and through.  I will report back once their fried chicken claim has been properly taken into consideration.but for now......i leave you with this:Pulled. Pork. Hash.UPDATE!:  I tried the fried chicken, and it was absolutely amazing.  I don't know if i can say it is the best in brooklyn, but it is definitely up there.  For $12 you get 3 pieces of chicken, smothered in gravy, 2 sides, and cornbread.  I went with sweet potato fries and creamed spinach.  splendid meal, highly recommended.",4.0

"I'm visiting from out of town and consider NYC the veggie burger capital of not only the United States, but possibly the world (turns out, vegetarians are not exactly revered in most countries). That being said, I have high expectations for the various vegetable concoctions this city's finest restaurants and dives can produce and slap onto a bun. Jimmy's Diner did not disappoint.  The place is tiny, which I typically consider a good sign for a diner. There are probably a maximum of 30 seats. It's also fairly charming inside, despite the location near an underpass-- I would perhaps not recommend this for a first date spot unless the potential significant other is the type of amazingly-cool person who can admire a great place without unnecessary frills. When we entered, we were greeted by an incredibly charming server who seemed very knowledgeable about the menu. He recommended the  veggie version of the Williamburger with sweet potato fries. The perfectly-fried patty was crunchy on the outside and tender without being mushy on the inside. It was loaded with smatterings rather than chunks of vegetables and perfectly seasoned. The burger sat atop a fabulous latke and was loaded with enough sour cream and applesauce to add flavor, but not turn the burger into a sopping mess. The bun was sturdy enough for the large mass of food without being too doughy. I devoured half of the burger without ever setting it down and moved on to the fries.DEAR GOD. The sweet potato fries. The regular fries were somewhat mushy and bland, but the sweet potato fries were so delicious that I kept eating well beyond being full. The homemade pickles on the side were so delicious that I, with an epic aversion to all things pickled, ate my companion's perfect little green discs as well.

Watch yo'self because they come out so hot.And then came the chicken and waffles and the chicken-fried bacon sandwich with sweet potato taters. Whoa! I know! Sounds like a heart attack. They put the chicken on top of the waffle for you and then smother it in gravy. MMMmmm. You get a drumstick, thigh, and breast. I recommend peeling the batter off of the chicken and scooping up some gravy in the batter like eating chips and dip. And the waffle is thick like a Belgian waffle but the batter is definitely different. Kinda cornmealy. I liked it a lot. The chicken-fried bacon sandwich was okay. Just a tad spicy for my taste but I loved the crunchy batter that they dipped the bacon in. I like texture in my deep fried foods and this place does it. I am proud to say that we did a very good job. All that was left was the wishbone and one tater. The service was lovely and sweet.",5.0

"The morning after a particularly rough evening out, immediate sustenance was heavily needed. Had I not been hungover or in heels, I would have run to Jimmy's Diner after my man showed me the menu. Eggy, cheesey, bacony cornbready goodness is all my body needed!! But alas, a 45 minute wait is not an option when you're on the verge of puking and/or death. So we brunched nearby, but I could not get visions of grits and tater tots out of my head. I was GOING to get Jimmy's Diner, and I was going to get it soon. As in, the following weekend.Last night I had fantasies of dragging my beau to Meatball Shop at 2AM, but NO. I stayed strong. And woke promptly at 9AM and tossed and turned until I was sure he was (slightly) awake and (somewhat) conscious before I asked, ""Do youuuuu wanna go to Jimmy's Diner or get breakfast?""""Yeah,"" he muttered. VICTORY. I allowed about 30 minutes more of spoonage before announcing it was time to eat and rolled out of bed. Luckily, with the gross weather the wait was only five minutes, but now having experienced the gloriousness of their breakfast bowls, I will happily shrivel to death waiting for a table the next time I'm hungover. Once seated, after confirming with the waitress that the cornbread was not gluten-free, I opted for the grits and eggs bowl per the waitress's recommendation while my man went with chicken and waffles.We didn't have any issues with the server- she was as attentive as can be expected at a busy diner and perfectly pleasant. And then our food arrived, and angel's sang and then I realized I DIDN'T EVEN NEED TO ASK FOR HOT SAUCE, THERE WAS A BOTTLE OF FRANK'S SITTING ON THE TABLE ALREADY and there were rainbows and dolphins.Thank god I'm g-free, otherwise I would've pounded into those chicken and waffles because they were so goddamn beautiful. And delicious, apparently. Naturally, I subbed bacon for the sausage in my own breakfast bowl, and it was a bowl of heaven, a heaven I will dream of until I have it again. It didn't need Frank's, but I doused each bite and it was breakfast ecstasy. It was beautiful. It was magic.Next time, I'm going for the pulled pork hash. And if things go south with this man, it'll be a long, hard fight to the end because I am NOT giving up the convenience of his bed to Jimmy's Diner, not anytime soon. Obviously, I have my priorities straight.",5.0
"I think one of the requirements of a restaurant touting to serve 'comfort food' is that a patron will have the wish to be wheel-barreled out after a meal.

The onion rings were crispy with seasoned batter, and the aforementioned mac and cheese was served creamy (the way I like it!). The fried chicken was suitably juicy, although I found the gravy that it was smothered in a little too salty. One of my dining companions had a classic brunch option, and nearly waxed poetic with every bite of waffle that came with her chicken. This place definitely warrants another visit.",4.0

The place was very quite which was no surprise for 8p on a midweek evening in february. Despite the quiet evening Jimmy's was such a treat. The waiter was friendly and pleasant. The fresh food was delivered promptly, hot and delicious. I will most definitely be returning next time I'm in the neighborhood.",4.0
"We wandered into Brooklyn not knowing that UP was long gone. I know! Where have I been?So we had a very lovely brunch at the table in the back. A.K.A. the dangerous table. Don't peel off the masking tape. It's there for your own good. The meal starts with lemon-sized doughnut holes covered in cinnamon and sugar. Watch yo'self because they come out so hot.And then came the chicken and waffles and the chicken-fried bacon sandwich with sweet potato taters. Whoa! I know! Sounds like a heart attack. They put the chicken on top of the waffle for you and then smother it in gravy. MMMmmm. You get a drumstick, thigh, and breast. I recommend peeling the batter off of the chicken and scooping up some gravy in the batter like eating chips and dip. And the waffle is thick like a Belgian waffle but the batter is definitely different. Kinda cornmealy. I liked it a lot. The chicken-fried bacon sandwich was okay. Just a tad spicy for my taste but I loved the crunchy batter that they dipped the bacon in. I like texture in my deep fried foods and this place does it. I am proud to say that we did a very good job. All that was left was the wishbone and one tater. The service was lovely and sweet.",5.0
"Brought my son here on a sunday morning.   Place was packed.  Got lucky and took to seats at the window.  I got the chicken and wafles. They were amazing.  I loved it.  My son got the  huevos rancheros. He was very impressed. A nine year old. Now grant it this boy has a very eclectic taste, but says even more that he loved it.  Can't wait to go back.",5.0
"The morning after a particularly rough evening out, immediate sustenance was heavily needed. Had I not been hungover or in heels, I would have run to Jimmy's Diner after my man showed me the menu. Eggy, cheesey, bacony cornbready goodness is all my body needed!! But alas, a 45 minute wait is not an option when you're on the verge of puking and/or death. So we brunched nearby, but I could not get visions of grits and tater tots out of my head. I was GOING to get Jimmy's Diner, and I was going to get it soon. As in, the following weekend.Last night I had fantasies of dragging my beau to Meatball Shop at 2AM, but NO. I stayed strong. And woke promptly at 9AM and tossed and turned until I was sure he was (slightly) awake and (somewhat) conscious before I asked, ""Do youuuuu wanna go to Jimmy's Diner or get breakfast?""""Yeah,"" he muttered. VICTORY. I allowed about 30 minutes more of spoonage before announcing it was time to eat and rolled out of bed. Luckily, with the gross weather the wait was only five minutes, but now having experienced the gloriousness of their breakfast bowls, I will happily shrivel to death waiting for a table the next time I'm hungover. Once seated, after confirming with the waitress that the cornbread was not gluten-free, I opted for the grits and eggs bowl per the waitress's recommendation while my man went with chicken and waffles.We didn't have any issues with the server- she was as attentive as can be expected at a busy diner and perfectly pleasant. And then our food arrived, and angel's sang and then I realized I DIDN'T EVEN NEED TO ASK FOR HOT SAUCE, THERE WAS A BOTTLE OF FRANK'S SITTING ON THE TABLE ALREADY and there were rainbows and dolphins.Thank god I'm g-free, otherwise I would've pounded into those chicken and waffles because they were so goddamn beautiful. And delicious, apparently. Naturally, I subbed bacon for the sausage in my own breakfast bowl, and it was a bowl of heaven, a heaven I will dream of until I have it again. It didn't need Frank's, but I doused each bite and it was breakfast ecstasy. It was beautiful. It was magic.Next time, I'm going for the pulled pork hash. And if things go south with this man, it'll be a long, hard fight to the end because I am NOT giving up the convenience of his bed to Jimmy's Diner, not anytime soon. Obviously, I have my priorities straight.",5.0
"I think one of the requirements of a restaurant touting to serve 'comfort food' is that a patron will have the wish to be wheel-barreled out after a meal. And according to this standard, Jimmy's Diner is a success.Fried chicken, mac and cheese, po' boy sandwiches, this place has it all. Mostly everything I tried in my group of three was delicious. The onion rings were crispy with seasoned batter, and the aforementioned mac and cheese was served creamy (the way I like it!). The fried chicken was suitably juicy, although I found the gravy that it was smothered in a little too salty. One of my dining companions had a classic brunch option, and nearly waxed poetic with every bite of waffle that came with her chicken. This place definitely warrants another visit.",4.0

"Lord ohhh Lord, this place was GOOD. I had the empanadas and they came with eggs, black beans, and ""home fries"".

The empanadas were a different story, they were delicious!!!!One of my friends had the biscuit & sausage gravy while my other friend had the chicken and waffles. Both dishes were delicious!!!! The chicken melted in your mouth and so did the waffle. It was probably, if not the best, one of the best chicken and waffles ive ever had.I WILL be back to try more things on the menu.",4.0
"$3 pints of beer after 3pm on a Sunday afternoon, with great service and portions that are texas sized makes Jimmy's Diner nothing to sneeze at.  Hidden away on a nondescript street a couple of blocks away from McCarren Park, this tiny hole in the wall is easy to miss unless you're specifically looking for it.  When the 5 of us walked in with no less than a full stroller in tow, the other diners here gave us nasty ""Oh, you're not going to ruin my brunch with the cries of a baby, are you?"" looks.  Nevertheless, the staff was more than happy to accomodate us and even with the music playing, the baby managed to sleep the entire way through brunch without disturbing anyone.   After much indecision (menu ranges from omelettes to waffles to humongous burgers), I ended up ordering chicken wings.  That's when I realized that the window shades on the front facade blatantly advertised their Fried Chicken as the best in town.  I caught our waitress and the kitchen just in time to make the change to a Fried Chicken Platter.  The fried chicken is good though I've had better.  The meat was quite juicy and the batter was neither too heavy nor too light.  The small cornbread piece it came with though was without question the most amazing piece of cornbread I've ever had and I'd order a basket of it if possible.  Moist with plenty of cornmeal texture to it, it was pure perfection.  The side of mash potatoes and creamed spinach on the other hand, were nothing special and I barely touched them.

The next time we went I hot the cornbread bowl that come with tomatoes eggs and cheese. I definitely would say there are better things on the menu because it was pretty plain.

"I'm from New Jersey, a state that claim quite a few things to fame; Bruce Springsteen, the Jersey Shore (not the Jersey Shore), Fat Sandwiches, the best pizza and bagels, The Sopranos, and lastly, and perhaps most of all; diners. Our grand contribution to society may very well be the glorious institution we call a diner. A magical meeting point available 24/7, where old people can come for oatmeal and a sanka and sit next to drunk teenagers housing buffalo wings and cheeseburgers.... at 7 am. The term diner cannot just be appropriated by anyone, and it cannot be used lightly. Whilst not 24/7, Jimmy's is a worthy candidate. It's old folk lore that one cannot use the term diner unless someone from NJ delegates--no, grants--no, bestows--that term upon them. That actually isn't true, but it should be. Regardless, Jimmy's is amazing for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Their menu boasts proud comfort food, such as the breakfast bowls, named things like Tater Heaven and the Hangover Helper. My favorite is the Pulled Pork Hash; homefries with pulled pork, BBQ sauce and two fried eggs. I douse it in hot sauce and shove it all in my face as fast as possible. They have everything you could possible want for breakfast, including the chicken and waffles pictured above (way better than Pies n' Thighs), and including the standard diner how many you want and how to you want 'em? The coffee is great too.On to lunch and dinner; it's the full gamut of mozzarella sticks, firecracker wings, mac 'n cheese, DISCO FRIES, fried chicken for days, just everything. Paired with cheap beer, cocktails, the happiest of hours... one word that would accurately describe Jimmy's is GLORIOUS.",5.0

"This place has some of the best diner food I have ever had and the atmosphere is really nice. The first time I went my sister got the chicken and waffles and I got the pulled pork hash. While the gravy for the chicken is pretty good do NOT get the gravy poured on because their maple syrup is so good you have to try it. They offer for you to get the sauce on the side make the right decision. My pulled pork hash while in a small bowl was bursting with flavor and I am not even a huge pork fan but I would definitely get that again. The next time we went I hot the cornbread bowl that come with tomatoes eggs and cheese. I definitely would say there are better things on the menu because it was pretty plain. However, for the first time I had devil eggs and they were amazing. The sauce that comes on the side was perfect for dipping. The wait was about 30 mins. but it was late on a Sunday afternoon=hangover food time.",4.0
Just do yourself a favor and go already. It's not just okay... its amazing! The crew that works there is nice and down to earth as well.,5.0
"I'm from New Jersey, a state that claim quite a few things to fame; Bruce Springsteen, the Jersey Shore (not the Jersey Shore), Fat Sandwiches, the best pizza and bagels, The Sopranos, and lastly, and perhaps most of all; diners. Our grand contribution to society may very well be the glorious institution we call a diner. A magical meeting point available 24/7, where old people can come for oatmeal and a sanka and sit next to drunk teenagers housing buffalo wings and cheeseburgers.... at 7 am. The term diner cannot just be appropriated by anyone, and it cannot be used lightly. Whilst not 24/7, Jimmy's is a worthy candidate. It's old folk lore that one cannot use the term diner unless someone from NJ delegates--no, grants--no, bestows--that term upon them. That actually isn't true, but it should be. Regardless, Jimmy's is amazing for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Their menu boasts proud comfort food, such as the breakfast bowls, named things like Tater Heaven and the Hangover Helper. My favorite is the Pulled Pork Hash; homefries with pulled pork, BBQ sauce and two fried eggs. I douse it in hot sauce and shove it all in my face as fast as possible. They have everything you could possible want for breakfast, including the chicken and waffles pictured above (way better than Pies n' Thighs), and including the standard diner how many you want and how to you want 'em? The coffee is great too.On to lunch and dinner; it's the full gamut of mozzarella sticks, firecracker wings, mac 'n cheese, DISCO FRIES, fried chicken for days, just everything. Paired with cheap beer, cocktails, the happiest of hours... one word that would accurately describe Jimmy's is GLORIOUS.",5.0
"Just ate here today.  They served us chicken and waffles, but the chicken was still bloody.  Waitress took the dish into the kitchen and analyzed it for a bit, then decided to give us a whopping $3 off the bill.  Manager and/or chef didn't even come out to apologize.Looks like a salmonella risk is only worth the price of an iced coffee to them.Gross.  Won't be eating here again.",2.0

"Came here over the weekend. Cool lil' diner hole-in-the-wall vibe. Waited 15 minutes and sat at the awkward-to-sit-at-w/-2-winter-coats counter and after a bit of negotiation settled in.

The food is where I was extremely disappointed with my yelp people who have rarely let me down. I had the Tater Tot Heaven. The ""tater tot"" tasted more like a salty hush puppies sans the 'tater' - does anyone know what tater tots are btw? I wish someone warned me. I could barely stomach 1/2 the bowl because of how extremely salty it was. The hush puppies were salty, the jalapeno jack was salty, the eggs were salty...thankfully the guac was a cool bit of unsalty goodness that gave my mouth some relief. But once that was gone I found myself forcing it down my throat and washing it down with as much water as my mouth could handle. I went through 2 glasses of water and the thought of shoving more of that salty madness made me sick to my stomach. Maybe I caught the cook staff on a heavy-handed salty day but sweet jesus that was one of the worst breakfasts I've ever had. And breakfast/brunch is a meal I am well, well, well acquainted with. The Boy had chicken and waffles. Waffles were fine. Chicken was okay. We both agreed that white 'gravy' was unnecessary. I'm not saying this place is horrible.

The deep fried deviled eggs, also came out hot, and it was a great pop and burst when you bite into them. They also serve them with a chipotle mayo which had a subtle kick.

"First, I do want to say that the service was good and friendly. I went to Jimmy's (Greenpoint) with my boyfriend (that had not eaten chicken in 15 years) and another friend that grew up in the south. We were on a serious hunt for a fried chicken dinner that wouldn't lead us all the way to Pies N' Thighs, so we walked to the new Jimmy's Diner location on Franklin and Calyer in Greenpoint. The fried chicken was a lot more like fried chicken jerky. All three plates were delivered to the table and I looked at the tiny pieces of chicken on our plates and could tell it was overcooked before even taking a bite (the breading had that dark over-fried patina). I took a bite & the flesh inside pulled away from the bone in dried threads. I immediately told he waitress ""I'm sorry, I have to send this back, it's pretty badly overcooked"". She was very friendly and obliged & my boyfriend and our other friend said nothing... they are both the kind of guys that would rather eat a shoe than send their food back and seem rude. My plate was returned fairly quickly with much better looking, larger pieces of chicken & 1 piece was actually almost cooked properly. I shared bites with my table mates and they both regretted not sending theirs back. Still, the other pieces of chicken on the plate were over-cooked, dry and rubbery. I was underwhelmed by the bland house-made tater tots and my table mate was sorely disappointed by his ""cheese grits"", not actual cheese grits but some grits with a square of cheese melted on top. After having lived in the South and really coming to know good Southern cooking, most places in New York miss the mark... Jimmy's Diner isn't even on the board. Worst of all, my recently de-vegetarianed boyfriend now thinks that fried chicken sucks because he ate the Jimmy's fried chicken. Also, I noticed in another review that someone described the crust on the chicken as having a strange sweetness to it, I agree and everything seemed over salted on the outside and bland on the inside. This was a waste of chicken. And, the corn bread wasn't just too sweet, it was basically corn cake.",1.0
This rating relates strictly to food and not decor. We've come for brunch and lunch and the food is always excellent. The fried chicken beats Brooklyn Bowl and Pies and Thighs and the tater tots and kale are both wonderful. The best thing to order is the spicy shrimp and grits which are of the charts but unfortunately they show up on the special menu once a month. Good beer during happy hour for 3 bucks and egg creams are only 2. I guess you can be ignored in many hipster restaurants but the staff here is very attentive.,5.0

"Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name. And they don't really know my name at Jimmy's Diner, but I feel like they could. Jimmy's has the personal homey feel that is MOST like ""the original Williamsburg"" in the 90s compared to every other place in the area.  Kookie, smallish, with great music, super-friendly staff, and a menu that has the aura of kids playing in a kitchen, producing many 'experimental' dishes... some fun, some foul.Hamburger, eggs, fries, pancakes...all safe bets. Sweets usually worth trying. Coffee superb.

"I had a great time here. It is right up my alley. Local Williamsburg kids enjoying a Tuesday night. The food is really creative and fun and not to mention it was very good. I wish I would have ordered what my friend did...the fried clams. They were delish! The server was really friendly and I just really like the ""small country kitchen"" feel to it with a little Brooklyn thrown in. I will totally go back!",4.0
"This place is EXACTLY what you want from a diner. Small town hospitality and cheap, amazing comfort food... all with an undeniable Brooklyn edge. This was me and my husbands regular spot when we first started dating. You will fall in love too.",4.0
"First, I do want to say that the service was good and friendly. I went to Jimmy's (Greenpoint) with my boyfriend (that had not eaten chicken in 15 years) and another friend that grew up in the south. We were on a serious hunt for a fried chicken dinner that wouldn't lead us all the way to Pies N' Thighs, so we walked to the new Jimmy's Diner location on Franklin and Calyer in Greenpoint. The fried chicken was a lot more like fried chicken jerky. All three plates were delivered to the table and I looked at the tiny pieces of chicken on our plates and could tell it was overcooked before even taking a bite (the breading had that dark over-fried patina). I took a bite & the flesh inside pulled away from the bone in dried threads. I immediately told he waitress ""I'm sorry, I have to send this back, it's pretty badly overcooked"". She was very friendly and obliged & my boyfriend and our other friend said nothing... they are both the kind of guys that would rather eat a shoe than send their food back and seem rude. My plate was returned fairly quickly with much better looking, larger pieces of chicken & 1 piece was actually almost cooked properly. I shared bites with my table mates and they both regretted not sending theirs back. Still, the other pieces of chicken on the plate were over-cooked, dry and rubbery. I was underwhelmed by the bland house-made tater tots and my table mate was sorely disappointed by his ""cheese grits"", not actual cheese grits but some grits with a square of cheese melted on top. After having lived in the South and really coming to know good Southern cooking, most places in New York miss the mark... Jimmy's Diner isn't even on the board. Worst of all, my recently de-vegetarianed boyfriend now thinks that fried chicken sucks because he ate the Jimmy's fried chicken. Also, I noticed in another review that someone described the crust on the chicken as having a strange sweetness to it, I agree and everything seemed over salted on the outside and bland on the inside. This was a waste of chicken. And, the corn bread wasn't just too sweet, it was basically corn cake.",1.0
This rating relates strictly to food and not decor. We've come for brunch and lunch and the food is always excellent. The fried chicken beats Brooklyn Bowl and Pies and Thighs and the tater tots and kale are both wonderful. The best thing to order is the spicy shrimp and grits which are of the charts but unfortunately they show up on the special menu once a month. Good beer during happy hour for 3 bucks and egg creams are only 2. I guess you can be ignored in many hipster restaurants but the staff here is very attentive.,5.0

"Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name. And they don't really know my name at Jimmy's Diner, but I feel like they could. Jimmy's has the personal homey feel that is MOST like ""the original Williamsburg"" in the 90s compared to every other place in the area.  Kookie, smallish, with great music, super-friendly staff, and a menu that has the aura of kids playing in a kitchen, producing many 'experimental' dishes... some fun, some foul.Hamburger, eggs, fries, pancakes...all safe bets. Sweets usually worth trying. Coffee superb.

"My boyfriend and I are obsessed with this place. We probably go every 2-3 weeks. I love that it's a tiny little hole in the wall. You wouldn't even know it was there unless you sought it out before you went or stumbled upon it.   Have eaten many dishes here but my favorite so far has been the tater heaven. It's heaven. Seriously. I also got a side of turkey sausage and I cut it up and mixed it in my bowl. it was divine.The tater tots here are a little different. They are the baby of a mommy hush-puppie and a daddy tater tot. I'm not mad about it at all. I used to live in the South and I miss hush puppies hardcore. I've also had the pulled pork sandwich and the Fried Chicken and Waffles. Also deelish.   Another highlight is the fried pickle chips. Bf and I share those a lot too. I also brought my parents here, my mom is kind of a picky eater and she had the french toast. I of course, had a bite and it blew my mind, Quite possibly the best french toast I've ever had...and I generally don't like the bread based breakfasts. My dad had pancakes and eggs. Literally the fluffiest pancakes in the world.      Coffee=fantastic. Free homemade cinnamon sugar doughnut hole=Awesome.

"I live nearby and used to come here fairly often.  The food is good for what it is (and excellent as hangover treatment) and I like the atmosphere, generally speaking.But I gave up on Jimmy's about a year ago because of the service.  I think casual service at a neighborhood diner is a fine thing, but there's such a thing as too casual.  Nearly every time I went alone, I'd find myself falling off the stool trying to get the attention of staff who were busy chatting with each other at the other end of the counter, while my food went cold waiting for silverware or hot sauce or whatever.  And it seemed like every 3rd or 4th time I went, my order would come out wrong and I'd have to either wait on another go round or suck it up if I was hungry enough.  It makes an impression to feel ignored in such a small place, particularly as a semi-regular, and after a while, it started to feel like too much trouble for a comfort-food meal.Of course, it took repeated exposure for me to get burned off this place, so it's perfectly possible to have a good experience here.  As an aside, the ""tater tots"" are good, but they're not what most people are going to be expecting from that name.",2.0
"Holy fat food, Batman! Scene: Sunday Brunch. A beautiful but blustery day. Would you want to spend it in the airless loft? Or...mosey on down under the BQE and make your way to this splendid diner? Yeah, option #2. I had never been here, so the complimentary (and gigantic!) cinnamon sugar dusted donut hole was like a surprise party for my mouth. When it came time to peruse the actual menu I found myself overwhelmed. So many fattening options. I almost cracked under the pressure. I finally agreed upon a scramble with black beans, chedda, sour cream, tomatoes and guac. And a side of bacon. Little did I know...but I would be fated to leave half the plate sitting there. There was just too much food. Jimmy's excelled in an area that I find very few restaurants do. Breakfast potatoes. They are often too dry, too bland, too dependent on salt or ketchup. Not these potatoes. No sir. Wonderfully tender and flavorful (thanks to the well-cooked onions and peppers). I was in heaven! Unfortunately I must report that ""The Best Fried Chicken in Brooklyn""...isn't. My source is a Fried Chicken expert. They should really cut the false advertising!",4.0
"UPDATE! I finally visited for Breakfast on a busy Saturday morning. We waited outside for about 25 minutes (which sucked because it was a million degrees outside but hey, what can you do, the place is tiny) before being seated in the window. A very friendly gent promptly took our order which consisted of... Me: Biscuits and gravy. Her: Tater heaven ( a bowl with tater tots on the bottom, an egg any style on top, cheese and guacamole). Both arrived rather quickly and both were very, very tasty. My only complaint is that the tater tots are not exactly tater tots as we've come to know them. They're more akin to a hush puppy in that they're mealy and very rich. I liked them but I prefer the classic preparation. The gravy component of the biscuits and gravy was really delicious. They don't stray from the classic preparation here and it's right on the money. The biscuit was fluffy, where it needed to be and ""crumbly"" where it needed to be.

Omg where do I begin??...The menu at Jimmy's is very interesting. both my friend and I got the grits bowls (mine without scrambled eggs) and hers without the additional cheese on top (the grits come mixed with eggs). dude kept getting it wrong and confused. i wanted to suggest a pen and pad to take orders. seriously it wasn't that hard. he did get the pickle chips and lemonade right.  i guess it was an off morning but damn. the food was good when we finally got it.

"I have been here twice. The first time was awesome. I got fried pickles, which were perfect and the portabello sandwich with sweet potato fries. Seriously so good. My friend got the chicken and waffles. It came with sausage gravy on top of it, which surprised me because I always think of syrup and hot sauce but she loved it.

"I've had a yelp account for several years, however I rarely post reviews. It's not often I feel strongly enough (either positive or negative) to do so. Today, I had a meal so awful, I was compelled to review it immediately.  When my girlfriend and I arrived at Jimmy's Diner, it seemed to be a cute little place with a pretty chill atmosphere.  It was a bit dark, and cold enough to be uncomfortable, but it was a cold and gloomy Sunday evening, so perhaps I could look past that. The staff was good, everyone was pleasant and efficient. But no matter how good the staff was , it couldn't make up for the food. We were pretty hungry,  and we were looking forward to our meal, particularly since there were so many positive reviews. When the food arrived, I was a bit taken aback by the quality. I am not an excellent cook by any means, but my own egg sandwiches are infinitely better than the chewy slop presented on what was the only edible part of the meal, the brioche bun. The flavor and texture of the eggs was making me nauseous from the first bite, and the stiff (not exactly crispy) bacon also had the same flavor -something like a cross between dirty dish water, rancid butter, and wayyyy to much salt. The same flavor oozed all over the also petrified country ham, which gave off an aroma very similar to what I would expect a fish's fart to smell like. The mozzarella sticks seemed like the only saviour at first, though they also had the same over-salted, dish water flavor. At least the texture of the mozzarella sticks was almost what you'd expect, close enough anyway. My girlfriend was equally grossed out by her meal. She insisted on paying for our meals, since originally I had suggested a local diner, but she wanted to try Jimmy's. For the prices they charge, I expect the quality to be much, much better. I think we had sampled enough of the menu to know that we will never return, so if it is a case of an off day at Jimmy's, I will never know. I would have been much more satisfied with the food from a greasy spoon diner (any of which I've ever been to has better food than this, at prices much more appropriate). All in all, I am very disappointed and unsatisfied by my experience at Jimmy's Diner.",1.0
"Okay, I just tried to go here after reading mostly positive reviews on this site and lots of negative reviews about the service on menupages, and here's what happened:My boyfriend and I walked up, and before we could even open the door an employee comes to us and says, ""Table for two?  It's going to be about a 15 minutes wait, maybe 20, is that okay?""  We looked at each other and say sure, and then she says, ""And do you mind waiting outside?""  Okay, now.  It's January, it's about 1 degree outside, and no one else was standing around waiting for a table.  I'm sure the food at this place is delicious, but give me an effing break.  That was ridiculous, and we left and walked to Harefield Road, which was amazing.So I'm giving them three stars to take them down a fraction of a notch for douchey and unreasonable behavior.",3.0
Definitely coming back. Service was ok but the breakfast was very good. It was a  nice departure from the standard bacon and eggs you'd get from other places. I don't like grits but they might have made me a convert.,4.0
"My boyfriend and I are obsessed with this place. We probably go every 2-3 weeks. I love that it's a tiny little hole in the wall. You wouldn't even know it was there unless you sought it out before you went or stumbled upon it.   Have eaten many dishes here but my favorite so far has been the tater heaven. It's heaven. Seriously. I also got a side of turkey sausage and I cut it up and mixed it in my bowl. it was divine.The tater tots here are a little different. They are the baby of a mommy hush-puppie and a daddy tater tot. I'm not mad about it at all. I used to live in the South and I miss hush puppies hardcore. I've also had the pulled pork sandwich and the Fried Chicken and Waffles. Also deelish.   Another highlight is the fried pickle chips. Bf and I share those a lot too. I also brought my parents here, my mom is kind of a picky eater and she had the french toast. I of course, had a bite and it blew my mind, Quite possibly the best french toast I've ever had...and I generally don't like the bread based breakfasts. My dad had pancakes and eggs. Literally the fluffiest pancakes in the world.      Coffee=fantastic. Free homemade cinnamon sugar doughnut hole=Awesome. If you don't like this place, you're stupid...Or perhaps you have some sort of taste bud condition, where good food tastes bad going down your gullet. but that's cool because, then there's more for me.",5.0
"I live nearby and used to come here fairly often.  The food is good for what it is (and excellent as hangover treatment) and I like the atmosphere, generally speaking.But I gave up on Jimmy's about a year ago because of the service.  I think casual service at a neighborhood diner is a fine thing, but there's such a thing as too casual.  Nearly every time I went alone, I'd find myself falling off the stool trying to get the attention of staff who were busy chatting with each other at the other end of the counter, while my food went cold waiting for silverware or hot sauce or whatever.  And it seemed like every 3rd or 4th time I went, my order would come out wrong and I'd have to either wait on another go round or suck it up if I was hungry enough.  It makes an impression to feel ignored in such a small place, particularly as a semi-regular, and after a while, it started to feel like too much trouble for a comfort-food meal.Of course, it took repeated exposure for me to get burned off this place, so it's perfectly possible to have a good experience here.  As an aside, the ""tater tots"" are good, but they're not what most people are going to be expecting from that name.",2.0
"Holy fat food, Batman! Scene: Sunday Brunch. A beautiful but blustery day. Would you want to spend it in the airless loft? Or...mosey on down under the BQE and make your way to this splendid diner? Yeah, option #2. I had never been here, so the complimentary (and gigantic!) cinnamon sugar dusted donut hole was like a surprise party for my mouth. When it came time to peruse the actual menu I found myself overwhelmed. So many fattening options. I almost cracked under the pressure. I finally agreed upon a scramble with black beans, chedda, sour cream, tomatoes and guac. And a side of bacon. Little did I know...but I would be fated to leave half the plate sitting there. There was just too much food. Jimmy's excelled in an area that I find very few restaurants do. Breakfast potatoes. They are often too dry, too bland, too dependent on salt or ketchup. Not these potatoes. No sir. Wonderfully tender and flavorful (thanks to the well-cooked onions and peppers). I was in heaven! Unfortunately I must report that ""The Best Fried Chicken in Brooklyn""...isn't. My source is a Fried Chicken expert. They should really cut the false advertising!",4.0
"UPDATE! I finally visited for Breakfast on a busy Saturday morning. We waited outside for about 25 minutes (which sucked because it was a million degrees outside but hey, what can you do, the place is tiny) before being seated in the window. A very friendly gent promptly took our order which consisted of... Me: Biscuits and gravy. Her: Tater heaven ( a bowl with tater tots on the bottom, an egg any style on top, cheese and guacamole). Both arrived rather quickly and both were very, very tasty. My only complaint is that the tater tots are not exactly tater tots as we've come to know them. They're more akin to a hush puppy in that they're mealy and very rich. I liked them but I prefer the classic preparation. The gravy component of the biscuits and gravy was really delicious.

Horrible. Even as a parent! The food is not good enough to endure that....not even close.i finally banned them when my husband and i ordered delivery. we ordered 2 dinners. they turned up 50 minutes later with one dinner. unfort we didn't notice this until after the dude had left. upon calling i was told (with no sympathy whatsoever mind you) ""oh i can offer to deliver the rest of your dinner, but it's really busy now so it will be at least an hour and a half"". wtf. nice customer service buddy. i had to get quite stern with him to get my credit card refunded (he wanted to put me on a list to get a free dinner next time i called. Ha! was that a joke? No it wasn't) anyhow that's when i decided mediocre fried chicken wasn't worth this pain in the ass joint. thank god Egg opened for dinner!This place s a total miss.

"i think i know why people love this place so much- it's because they let little kids run riot in there. I'm serious. i have been here twice and each time there have been super badly behaved children in there. jumping in the front window seat for 30 mins straight, another one running from the front door to the kitchen door screaming and carrying on. Horrible. Even as a parent! The food is not good enough to endure that....not even close.i finally banned them when my husband and i ordered delivery. we ordered 2 dinners. they turned up 50 minutes later with one dinner. unfort we didn't notice this until after the dude had left. upon calling i was told (with no sympathy whatsoever mind you) ""oh i can offer to deliver the rest of your dinner, but it's really busy now so it will be at least an hour and a half"". wtf. nice customer service buddy. i had to get quite stern with him to get my credit card refunded (he wanted to put me on a list to get a free dinner next time i called. Ha! was that a joke? No it wasn't) anyhow that's when i decided mediocre fried chicken wasn't worth this pain in the ass joint. thank god Egg opened for dinner!This place s a total miss. Unless you are a crappy parent and let your children act like savages at dinner, be my guest- I won't be returning.",1.0
"When people ask me what I think of this place, the first thing that comes to mind is ""well, there's never any wait.""I live a few blocks away and have tried brunch, dinner, to-stay and to-go in all manner of combinations, and honestly, I think this place is hit-or-miss. At its best, it's pretty good, but unfortunately it doesn't seem to be consistent. I just ordered some takeout (buffalo shrimp and a shake) and the shrimp arrived tasting of freezer burn, so I figured it was time to write a review.Rare occurrence of freezer burn aside, the food is nothing to write home about. I suspect some reviewers here confused ""novelty"" (no one else in w'burg serves chik'n and waffles) with ""excellence."" (side note: to be mind blown by this dish done right, head to Harlem.)That said, if you're in a hurry and want friendly service with decent (*decent*, not ""mediocre"" or ""stellar"") food, this is definitely the place to go.",3.0
"oh yes.  jimmy's diner.  probably the place that i've been disappointed by most, considering the positive reviews.their fried pickles were disgusting.  i wouldn't have fed them to ... anyone.that is what stood out the most from my visit there.  i also ordered a sandwich ... which was cold.  and the waitstaff was just one dude.  for the whole place.  granted - it's a small place, but it's not that small when you have an enormous table of demanding foreign tourists at the front of the restaurant who are nothing but rude.  i was very nice, but i was very disappointed.  sad.",2.0

"This place was great! Couldn't decide between so many things on the menu...I had the Cow Girl (veggie burger) which was great.

"It's no Union Picnic, but definitely a welcome replacement.Although I am going through withdrawals from sweet potato fries and fried green tomatoes, I am anxious to eat my way through the adventuresome menu.  There are endless possibilities and they have kept the good lookin' baked goods.The service is great, the guy who was there the first morning I went made it feel like a old-time diner by keeping conversation going, and asking if the music was ok.  He almost seemed like he would be lonely when we left(there was no one else there).  However a couple weeks ago I called for delivery around noon and the phone just rang and rang and rang...perhaps they are not yet delivering?I am SO HAPPY they are open daily for breakfast.  This neighborhood definitely needs more places that open before 11am.  It's along my walk to work and I have already explored the breakfast menu.  The Mr. Potato Head is awesome, although the corn flake French toast was a bit too greasy(but I think its supposed to be).My biggest disappointment so far:  I was SO excited for the deep fried deviled eggs with chipotle mayo!  but they only came with ranch.  What a let down.Not to mention, its cute as a button!!!UPDATE: I finally came for something other than breakfast.  The food is just like what I would make at home when I still lived with mom + dad(and thats not necessarily a good thing).  Though the trivia did yield us a free milkshake, I don't think Jimmy's has anything on its non-breakfast menu that I actually like AND think is worth it's price. 7 bucks for a greasy deep fried fish cake on a tiny sesame bun without a side?  If I come across something that changes my mind, I will let you know, but in my book, breakfast is the only thing going for this place.  Throwing out the down home southern fare was a big mistake.  Oh, and so much sweat and flies(counted 9 on the ceiling) in there on an October night makes me cringe to think of July... if they don't get AC by summer....well, I'll just have to make my own Mr. Potato Heads.",2.0

"Jimmy's Diner is the new place that opened up recently in the old Union Picnic location. The menu is upscale diner and the decor is old-school coffee shop (without beeing at all cheesy). And so clean!Now, let me start with the caveat the I am currently in (about to end, thank god) Stage 1 of the South Beach Diet. This makes it not such a good time to review any restaurant, but especially a diner. However, I was heading to trivia at Pete's Candy Store last night and since the sandwiches there were out of the question, I decided to check out Jimmy's and see what my options were. I got the chopped salad with grilled chicken, which was quite tasty (and only contained one ingredient on my can't eat list: beets). I thought it was a little over-priced at $13, but that's to be expected in this neighborhood, I suppose. Anyway, I am looking forward to more unrestricted eating and being able to try other items on the menu.While it's disappointing to see Union Picnic go, Jimmy's seems like a fair replacement and I have no doubt they will be getting a decent amount of business from me in the future.",3.0

"Stumbled in here this Saturday for some late afternoon brunch.  I ordered up the Huevos Rancheros & my girl had the Pulled Pork Hash.  The service was very friendly, we received some free cinnamon sugar coated donut holes with our coffee and the food came out darn fast.  I thought the portions were just right but my *fried* eggs were a little runny and the Hash, while very tasty, was served in a pool of oil.The couple next to us ordered the Tater Heaven (Homemade tater tots with scrambled eggs, avocado, sauteed onions and melted jack cheese)  & Chicken and Waffles. After seeing the smile on their faces, we ordered a side of tots with some white gravy and they were just freaking delicious. I'll be going back soon to try some of the many flavors of milkshakes they offer and maybe some deep fried deviled eggs.  and more tater tots.",4.0

"Jimmy's Diner is the new place that opened up recently in the old Union Picnic location. The menu is upscale diner and the decor is old-school coffee shop (without beeing at all cheesy). And so clean!Now, let me start with the caveat the I am currently in (about to end, thank god) Stage 1 of the South Beach Diet. This makes it not such a good time to review any restaurant, but especially a diner. However, I was heading to trivia at Pete's Candy Store last night and since the sandwiches there were out of the question, I decided to check out Jimmy's and see what my options were. I got the chopped salad with grilled chicken, which was quite tasty (and only contained one ingredient on my can't eat list: beets). I thought it was a little over-priced at $13, but that's to be expected in this neighborhood, I suppose. Anyway, I am looking forward to more unrestricted eating and being able to try other items on the menu.While it's disappointing to see Union Picnic go, Jimmy's seems like a fair replacement and I have no doubt they will be getting a decent amount of business from me in the future.",3.0

"Greasy spoon kicked up a notch.  Go to Jimmy's when you want to make sweet, sweet love to something that will undo all of your work at the gym for the last several weeks.  I promise you, it is worth it.  Recommended:*Breakfast bowl.  My favorite includes scrambled eggs, guacamole, and tater tots.  Oh, and a word on those tater tots.  These are not the from-the-freezer-case nuggets that you remember from high school (and/or Napoleon Dynamite).  No no no.  These are more like mashed potato croquettes.  *French toast.  Divine.  They are coated in corn flakes and have a texture that is more doughnut than bread.  The portion is HUGE, so unless you have an appetite like that of my 6'4"" sweet-tooth-havin' boyfriend, it's totally shareable.*Bloody Mary.  Perfectly spicy and a nice, light consistency.  I hate thick Bloody Marys.  If I wanted cocktail sauce, I would have asked for it, thank you.*Fried pickles.  They come out very, very fresh, so wait at least 10 minutes or you will burn the shit out of your mouth, and possibly spit out half-eaten pickle so that you don't completely destroy the roof of your mouth.  But they're worth the wait.*The burgers themselves are good--nothing to write home about, but solid.  However, the burger selection is what's really impressive.  There are no less than a dozen different variations in preparation/toppings, and you can get beef, veggie or bison.  I recommend the Williamsbuger, which has a latke on it.  Sounds weird, but it is pure awesomeness.  Trust.  Also, you can get either sweet potato fries, which are yummy, or the aforementioned tater tots as a side.  Might have to pay a buck or two for the tots, but I say it's worth it.*MILKSHAKES.  For the love of god, get a milkshake.  I don't care if you're there at 10am.  Do it.  I've sampled a few, and the caramel malted is my fave, hands down.  However, if they have key lime pie in house, you might consider that.  They literally take a slice of pie and throw it in the milkshake blender with some ice cream.  How could it not be amazing?Oh, Jimmy-- I know you're bad, but it feels so right.",4.0

"I dont know what anyone is complaining about. I ended up here by accident one hungover afternoon and they luckily had a 4top table  waiting for us. Everything was AMAZING!!!!! Delicious bloody marrys, awesome, friendly waitress, and gourmet redneck food (as my friend like to call it) that will be sure to make you poop yours pants later cause you ate too much of their greasy, heavy, awesome everything!!! Cozy, quaint atmosphere and good music. A great, great find for breakfast with friends.",5.0
"i am kind of torn on how to review this place.  i really wanted to give it 2 stars but in the end i dont think thats fair. it is 3 stars quality.  i will, however, give you, fellow yelper, a warning: do not come here if you are looking for anything other than fried foods. i honestly felt like i was at the county fair. came here for a breakfast that could sop up what was in my gut from the night before (read: help cure my hangover). i ended up opting for the chicken and waffles. both were underdone. the waffles were mushy and the chicken skin fell off without much crunch.  my buddy ordered the french toast.  it too came deep fried. he said it tasted just like you would imagine fried french toast to taste. my buddy ate about half before he felt sick. the saving grace of the meal were the fried zucchini. they were delish. (although surprisingly expensive).3 stars. with the prospects of 4 if the next time i go the food i ordered is cooked (read: fried) crispy (and get a milkshake) because after we left i heard that the milkshakes are amazing. too bad i didnt get one.",3.0
"I had high expectations for Jimmy's Diner, considering the four star rating on yelp, and was extremely disappointed during my visit there this afternoon.  The portions were large but the food was unnecessarily greasy and relatively tasteless.  I don't plan on returning...",2.0
"when you're really hungry come eat their Chicken Waffles.  3 piece fried chicken on waffles with gravy and syrup on top.  their Mac and Cheese is amazingly delicious for being such a basic food group.. Fried cucumber chips was unique and breaded just right, not too heavy for a fried food group.  btw, they serve beer on the tap here in this Diner style rest.",4.0
Had the fried chicken: Awful. Just awful. Probably worse because they're proud of it.,3.0
For all of you who keep talking about Union Picnic need to stop. Union Picnic was a dirty place to eat. Jimmy's is so much cleaner. Ok now down to business. The fried chicken is good but I would not say the best in Brooklyn that title still is held by Junior's but don't get me wrong it is good. The burgers are strange but 2 thumbs up on the effort. This for sure is a must stop by. Enjoy.,4.0
"dudes, this is a diner.okay, on that note, don't be expecting some kind of posh meal with decorative greens.go here if you're starving, hung over or like things deep fried, they have a deep fried deviled egg, for christ's sake!love the chicken and waffles and the pitchers of bloody marys, the staff is always wonderful and the price is great.not a group dining experience though, small place.",4.0

"I guess this place is more well known for their brunch, but I went there for dinner and had a really good experience. I got a ""cowboy"" burger and it was really, really good. The fries are amazing and they tasted extremely fresh and crispy. They have a really wide range of burgers to choose from, which might be really good for people who like to layer their burgers up with a lot of extras.  Most burgers ran $9-$11, plus $3 for a side of fries.The people next to me had fried chicken and the person who ordered it was really enjoying it. I would definitely go and try it the next time I come back (which will be often!).I also really like the decor of the place. Not one of those chic places but not a total dive. The location is off of the busy ""strip"" of Williamsburg bustle so it made you feel like you were eating in a little southern outpost on the side of the road. The staff was really friendly. The bartender/waitress was working all by herself but she did a really good job of keeping everyone happy with a full restaurant. My friend and I were lingering a bit with our coffee/beer and she didn't try to rush us. Really great!When I went they were not accepting credit cards but they had an ATM machine.",5.0
"didn't come here for breakfast but I'm starting to think I should have. Came here for dinner. Ordered the firecracker wings which was ok; like any other buffalo wings you'll find at a bar. The blue cheese sauce was kind of watery. Also tried the fried chicken which was very crunchy. They say it's the best in BK but I haven't tried other places to form a solid opinion. Popeye's chicken offers the same crunch factor. The sweet potato fries were great; I loved the sea salt sprinkled on top which makes a difference. The tater tots were nothing like I've had before which I'm not sure is a good or bad thing. I was apprehensive about ordering a beer because it looked like it would be warm. Ordered it anyway and like I thought it was not as cold as I would have liked (the glass was warm). Given that the breakfast pictures other yelpers took looked amazing, I'll have to come back again and try the breakfast.",3.0

"I like this joint, very much.  I went with my boyfriend a few days ago, and have visitied a few times before.. I'm, going to give it four stars because I'm very conservative. I think the service was exceptionally friendly, the waitress was lovely and she brought us free homemade donuts - TASTY!!! She was prompt at bringing us our coffee refills and our food came quickly, which is great because I had work soon after our breakfast. The scramble and potatos portion was large and I had leftovers for lunch.. The table next to me ordered a serving of sausage on the side, and it was huge, almost a meal in itself! ( polish style! ). I think I wouldve prefered wheat bread to corn bread, but the corn bread wasnt bad at all. I liked the turkey sausage that came with my scramble, and the price is reasonable for the portion! I'm alittle sad Union Picnic is gone, mostly because of the byob and fish and chips baskets.. But ,  I'll be visiting Jimmy's Diner again soon!",4.0
"This would be a great place if it wasn't so damn inconsistent. Their menu offers all kinds of tasty treats, however, you never really know what you're gonna get. The first time I ordered delivery, I was delivered the wrong sandwich. I wanted the cheese steak and I got the beef dip. Just because they both have beef and cheese doesn't mean they are the same thing. It was still pretty good, but if I wanted the beef dip, I would've ordered it. The second time I ordered, my roommate and I tried to order platter dishes. The menu says they come with ""fresh vegetables"". I asked what the vegetable was and found it was creamed spinach. That was fine for me, but my roommate is lactose intolerant, which I told the guy on the phone. He couldn't have cared less. He said they had no other vegetables to offer. I even asked a second time, stressing the fact that my friend couldn't eat the spinach and didn't they have ANYTHING else to put in there? Nope. Eat shit pal. My friend decided to go for the same thing he had the first time: catfish fingers and fries. Decent enough. I ventured towards the bbq half chicken platter, and now realize my roommate benefited greatly from the phone guy's indiscretion. The mashed potatoes are the worst I've ever had. They tasted like watered down starch muck. There was absolutely no taste whatsoever. Butter? Salt? Hell no. I'd prefer the boxed variety over these. The chicken was ok. It was burned, but I didn't eat the skin anyway. The cornbread tasted like cake. And I don't mean that in a good way. I literally felt like I was eating granular pound cake. Their coleslaw had no dressing! It was chopped cabbage - DRY! The best thing was the infamous creamed spinach and the side salad I had ordered. However, it's pretty small for the price. The golden nugget here would be their fried devil eggs. These are all kinds of wrong, but they're soooo rightly delish. You just have to get past the hurdle of how many calories they must have. The verdict?  Keep it simple if you want a good meal. It's homestyle which means if it ain't fried, you'll probably be disappointed.",2.0

"I can't comment on a lot of the things that people seem pleased with and let down by on the reviews so far so I figured I'd just add comments about the brunch I had at Jimmy's Diner the other day.  I'd say Jimmy's is a place you don't have to think about, nothing super special on the menu and most likely you won't have to claw someones face off to get a seat at brunch-o'clock.  I have this thing with brunch where I want bites of everything.  And I mean eve-ry-thing.  So I ordered the Big Boy platter and it came with eggs, choice o' meat, browns, pancakes and cornbread.  Right off the bat, I wanted pancakes, but a few bites of sausage and eggs would be sweet, and browns only makes it more delightful.  Unfortunately the browns were kind of soggy and too mushy for me, the pancake was excellent and the sausage, though homemade (which is always a plus), was less than special.  Overall it felt like eating at a diner, it was pretty good going in, but a few hours later I felt crappy.  I may go back, especially when places in the neighborhood have up to a 2 hour wait for brunch sometimes.  I'd like to try for dinner as well.  But I'm in no rush.",3.0
