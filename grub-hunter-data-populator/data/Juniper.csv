"Walking into this restaurant, I had lower expectations. It was very small, quaint with a small staff so I did not expect much. But, the yelp reviews were outstanding for this little spot so my boyfriend and I decided to come here for a quick lunch and I must say I was pleasantly surprised.The menu is very simple and not too extensive with a blend of Southern & new American influences. We started with a special that was on the board: the SHRIMP & CORN CHOWDER SOUP ($8) and it was delicious. It was heartier than I expected with generous amounts of seafood and was very rich in flavor. I see myself craving this on a cold, rainy day and I hope they move it onto the permanent menu! Such a great price for amazing flavor. The entrees we ordered were the CATFISH SANDWICH and the TRUFFLE BURGER with GOUDA ($17). Both meals were absolutely worth it and delicious. The Catfish was thickly breaded, very crispy and it came with a tartar sauce and crunchy lettuce which were both great accents to the sandwich. Next, the Truffle burger came with mushrooms and was very simple...but probably hands down one of the best burgers I've had in NY so far. Thick juicy patty that was well seasoned and I also loved how they made the buns very crispy and buttery. Our meals both came with a side of Cajun seasoned SPICY FRIES (you have the REGULAR or SWEET POTATO option too) that were crispy and delicious as well.For the price and the quality of this spot, I will definitely be coming back. Our server, who also might be the owner (?), was very sweet and attentive to our table - really great service. I was eyeing a couple more things on the menu so I look forward to the next time I visit!",5.0
"3.5 to be exact.  I'll round up for the antique cash register!I was looking for a delicious burger in this area one night and stumbled upon Juniper.  This establishment is a small place, but do not let that scare you from coming here.  The service was good and I had a great meal here.There is an old school feel about this place, as they are CASH ONLY and have an antique cash register that actually looks pretty cool.  Like I mentioned previously, there are only a few tables and seats inside.  There is an area in the back you can sit, which truly looks just like a patio of a person's home.  I would not mind sitting out there during a nice day.The burger I got here, the Truffle Burger was good. Of course it was a burger with truffle oil, but the meat was juicy and full of flavor!  I also got it with spicy fries which were great! They were crispy and not overly seasoned.  The menu here is pretty interesting and for a small place they have some good items to try, which in my eyes, makes it worth coming back here!",4.0
"We were hungry searching for a good burger place in Williamsburg.We found Juniper, nice, easy, small place where we have been welcome in a nice way.We ordered 2 cheese burgers and they were really good, tasty, juicy and well cooked. The owner explained us how he searches for the meat and how he prepares the seasoning for it.Very good quality. A bit heavy for the garlic perhaps, but overall a very good experience!",4.0
"Ordered the truffle burger, medium rare again! However this time with gouda cheese. Amazing like the first time I ate here. Same $5 corkage fee for when you BYOB. There is a liquor shop across the street. This time around when we came here it was not as busy, so we got our food in a timely manner.BURGER WAS SO JUICY! Sweet potato fries were made with fresh sweet potatoes and nicely fried. Cajun fries were nicely tossed to have seasoning to evenly coat each fry! One slice of gouda cheese, honestly that's all I need, I don't want the cheese to overpower the bun nor burger.",4.0
"After a recommendation, I checked out this spot. While I was in the mood for something lite, I was taken in by the marvellous smell of bbq inside this place. To make a long story short I ordered their burger and fish and chips which I later found out looking online that this place serves the best stuff in town. Sure enough, the food was absolutely awesome. This is apparently very close to Southern style. I highly recommend this spot.",5.0
"Overall Score: 4Service/Ambiance Rating: 3Food Rating: 5I've gone to Juniper twice and both times I got the Cajun Seafood Pasta. I typically don't like to spend more than $15 on a meal, but when it comes to seafood and this dish it's worth it. It's a huge portion and super tasty [also heavy on the garlic]. I've also had a chance to try their chicken tenders, coated with Rice Krispies for an extra crunch, as well as their sweet potato fries which are great. I'd like to eventually try everything on the menu. The service was a bit lackluster when I went. The waitress was heavily invested in watching TV and I would have liked her to check in a bit more frequently as my friend and I were the only people in the restaurant for our whole meal. Also, for anyone concerned with health standards, it looks like they have a B rating.",4.0
"Cash only. BYOB. Everything is made to order so don't be come in a rush. Come with a 6 pack or a bottle of wine and chill listening to the fun times. Everything we ordered was Delish! Truffle burger with spicy fries, Mac n cheese with bacon and chicken fingers with rice crispies. Can't wait to come back!",5.0
"Highly recommended. I went there last night with friends after my coworker recommended it. It's a small but cute restaurant and the place is crowded so you know it must be good. On a Friday night, we had to wait 40+ minutes for 4 but we left our number with one of the servers so that they can call us when the table was ready.We ended up going there prepared (the restaurant is BYOB with a corking fee of $5 per wine bottle) with two bottles of wine and as soon as we sat, they saw our cue and offered to open the bottles for us. The service was nice and efficient and our orders were -2 Truffle burgers - Recommended by the waitressBoth our burgers were ordered with smoked gouda and it was pretty damn delicious. It's basically a beef burger with portabello mushrooms on top and dressed with truffle oil. The seasoning was great and I thought the burger was juicy. It came with your choice of reg. fries, sweet potato fries or spicy fries. We got the spicy and they were nicely seasoned without it being too salty.Pulled pork sandwich My buddy had the pulled pork sandwich and he said it was great. As soon as it came, he was hands deep into the sandwich, with sauce all over his fingers but he clearly was enjoying it.Jambalaya The jambalaya was spicier than I anticipated but that's a good thing. It wasn't too dry and I'd have to say as good as the truffle burger was, this was better. It came with decent sized shrimp and mussels and I'd say the portion was pretty good. We didn't end up ordering any apps or desserts and the bill came out to somewhere around $85 for four people which is great. I know their prices were maybe a dollar or two more than other places because of the BYOB but considering we saved money on the drinks, I'm not complaining. And we were so satisfied I left overtipping. Definitely will try to go back when I can.",4.0
"Great food and cute little place. Only complaint is that our service was really slow and it took almost 40 minutes to get our food. I had the pulled pork sliders app and a side of sweet potato fries. The pulled pork was amazing, but the buns were very plain Jane and I didn't even finish them. The fries were delicious!I also had a bite of my friend's truffle burger - amazing. I also finished off his tasty spiced fries. BTW, fries are even better when you swirl them around in truffle oil. Cash only, but they have an ATM in the back so it was no big deal.",4.0
"Food is really good. Love their wings especially. But the decor is tired and worn out. I think if they would invest in dressing this place up, they would have way more business.",3.0
"My boyfriend and I decided to try Juniper after reading such positive reviews, and now I get to add my own positive review! We were able to choose our table since it wasn't crowded at the time of our arrival. The menu was short and sweet, but everything sounded so appealing. We decided to get the Pulled Pork Sliders as an appetizer. I would say that appetizer is meant for 2 people since they serve 2 sliders, which is something to consider. However, they were delicious: very flavorful with the perfect pork-to-sauce ratio (personally, I do not like overly-saucy pulled pork). The sliders were accompanied by tiny potato fries. For lack of a better description, they resembled little matchsticks with a potato chip feel. For entrees, my boyfriend and I ordered the Chorizo Burger paired with Spicy Fries and the Cajon Seafood Pasta, respectfully. Being a fan or chorizo, the boyfriend appreciated his burger (""it was cooked to medium-well perfection""). The fries were awesome - I highly highly recommend those. The pasta was exceptional; I loved the sheer amount of seafood in the pasta sauce. They are really generous in that department, and equally generous in the department of flavor. (Side tip: Dip the fries in the pasta sauce.) We were very full after our dinner.Service was what I expected for 1 person to be working alone that night. The place got really crowded when we received our main dishes, so it made sense that it would be harder to flag down the single waitress in the restaurant. The poor girl was running in and out of the kitchen constantly with barely any time for a breather. Other than that, service was very fair.",5.0
"Love this restaurant!!!The food is amazing, I ordered Cajun sea food pasta and it was right amount of spicy, the sea food is fresh , and the portion is so satisfying. Husband order truffle burger and he loves it, the sweet fries comes with burger is also delicious!! I probably stole all of them from my husband's plate. Our waiter is so nice and so attentive, he is energetic and taking good care of everyone.  They are BYOB but they will charge you $5 for corking fee for wine, $ 3 for big bottle of beer, $1 for regular beer. They also don't take card but only cash ( they do have ATM machine inside the restaurant), so just something you might want to be aware ahead.",4.0
"I was skimming other Yelp reviews/pictures before I got lunch here because I like to be prepared when going to a restaurant. No curve balls because I'm way too indecisive. I immediately was sold on the truffle mushroom burger because I am a lover of all things truffle. When my burger came out I took my first bite and thought hmmm this is good, let me have another bite so I can really decide. Next thing I knew I ate the entire thing and finally realized that the burger I had just demolished was good, but not great, and surely nothing special.",3.0
"Juniper ended up being much smaller than I had inticipated. They are a very small bare bones place with a few tables and a spacious backyard patio with a number of other tables. Some work needs to happen as far as decor and design goes so don't expect romance here. As far as the menu goes they have a very simple 1 page menu dominated mostly with sandwiches/burgers ($11-16) but they also have a number of apps ($5-14) and main dishes ($15-21) as well.  They're BYOB and charge a corking fee ($1 per beer or $5 per bottle of wine), if you forget beer there's a grocery store about a block away. I ordered the rib sandwich with sweet potato fries. I'm still baffled how you get a sold piece of rib meat this size without bones. The meat was cooked very well but I wasn't a fan of the abundance of the vinegary BBQ sauce they drowned the meat in, it really dominated the flavor. The pillowy brioche bun also took up much more real estate of the sandwich than the meat. The sandwich came with a small side of great coleslaw and a couple pickles and lettuce. Surprisingly the highlight of my meal was the sweet potato fries. They were some of the best sweet potato fries I've ever had and would definitely get those again. I'll be back to try their seafood pasta or burgers in the future, especially when I can take advantage of the backyard without a coat.",4.0
"Juniper came to the rescue when I had a few hours to kill in Williamsburg waiting for my partner in crime.  Dinner for one with a good book and some gosh damn good Jambalaya.  Perfectly spiced, rice Al dente, good portion, and filled with mussels, shrimp, and delicious to the last bite. Somehow I had never realized Jambalaya was the American version of Paella, but there is was with my palette singing and thinking 'holy shit this taste as good as fresh made Paella!'.One winning dish is all the reason I need to really love a place, and from the looks of the menu Juniper had plenty more to offer.",5.0
"Had a random hankering for fish and chips last night, so I opened Yelp and searched in Williamsburg. This place came up and was a bit cheaper than some other spots. When we arrived I was skeptical, it looked really small inside. However fish and chips was one of their main offerings so we went in. I asked if the fish was fresh, not frozen and he said fresh catfish. I was like booyah!It has a real small town, chill homey vibe inside. Felt like I was in some small downtown upstate. Waitress was not pushy at all. My kind of atmosphere. The fish and chips was delicious! Everything tasted fresh, even the tartar sauce. Really good fish and chips, which is kind of hard to find. I would definitely go back for the super relaxed vibe and fish and chips!They should just spruce up the decor a little bit more.",4.0
"I was craving a juicy burger and this just hit the spot! We got the grilled burger and the chorizo burger. Both came on brioche buns and was cooked to perfection. I got cheese on my grilled burger but,  thinking back, would probably not get any next time around because you just don't need it. The burger comes with pickles and lettuce and a side of fries. I really liked the spicy fries. We enjoyed our meal inside but they have a nice outdoor patio area with cute picnic tables. Great option to enjoy the summer weather. BYOB and cash. They do charge corkage/bottle fee on weekends (including Fridays). Best bang for your buck is to bring a 1 liter bottle of wine.",4.0
"This is a cozy, no-nonsense home cookin joint. We came in on one of the coldest days thus winter to get some comfort food. Had the Mac and cheese - probably one of the best I've had. Firm rotini spirals with creamy yellow cheese in a single casserole pot/skillet and crispy rice crisps on top, bubbling as it arrived to our table. We brought some nice cold beers to compliment and cut through the richness ($1 corking fee for each). Also shared the catfish sandwich with spicy fries on the side. Nice moist fish, tarter sauce, and some little-less-than-fresh shredded lettuce on a buttered/toasted bun. Spicy fries were perfect, super crispy and just the right amount of spice to pair with the savory sandwich. It was a lot of food to just split between two people, very filling and a little unhealthy. If that's what you're going for, definitely come here, but don't come without getting the Mac and cheese. Service is a little slow but only because they make your food fresh to order. Very friendly staff, love this place - no frills and no B.S. Highly recommended!",4.0
"Williamsburg spot for a good burger according to yelpers, but I just didn't get ""Williamsburg"" from this restaurant or a crazy good meal. Dark, depressing and overall unkempt inside the restaurant.  Depressing wait service with little redeeming factors besides bringing the correct meal. Starting from just telling us to sit, short responses to questions on menu and just a generally unfriendly demeanor.  On the plus side, this place is BYO with no corkage fees. Negative, its cash only.  My meal was decent. I had the steak and cheese sandwich with the sweet potato fries.  I liked the fries but found it odd that they served this sandwich on a round bun and half the meat fell out as soon as you picked it up. It was an overall disappointing Yelp find and its been a long time since Yelp let me down.  At 4.5 stars this place is way overrated.",2.0

We ordered 5 appetizers and 4 entrees, it came out to about 140, which is really good for the amount of food,after eating we were on our last glass of wine when the woman who works there (Asian I believe) who was not our waiter came over our table and asked if we could move to the bar because there is a group waiting outside and their food was about to come out of the kitchen.........WHAT!?why do we have to move to the bar? why couldn't the group just wait at the bar like any other restaurant would of done.I was speechless! we just looked at each other and just told her we are leaving, paid and left. If she would of looked at our glasses she would of seen that we were going to leave in less than 5 minutes, i understand if we were there for hours not really buying anything, but we did wait an hour outside! we ordered a lot of food! literally had just finished eating.I always raved about this place because it was my favorite go to summer spot. but what she did on my birthday was just wrong.

"When passing by, Juniper looks like a burger joint crammed into a sizable closet. What I didn't know was they had seating outside in an incredibly spacious ""patio"". Another discovery - this place is BYOB. Usually a good thing, though would have preferred more of a heads up. Friends placed my order while I ran down to the nearby deli for a quick 6-pack. Order took way longer than expected (some people who sat later got their food first, so that was a bit annoying); luckily we had beer to keep us occupied. Settled on the truffle burger with gouda cheese and spicy fries ($15). Burger was thick and cooked well, though I wish I had added bacon to make it perfect. The fries indeed had a good kick, so I didn't have to add any ketchup/sauce.Food here is amazing but service is lacking (had to run down the waiter for the check). Also, this place is expensive for a cash-only business (if you charge over $10 for a burger, then take credit cards).",3.0
"What a hidden gem tucked away in Williamsburg where you have so many options to dine out. We had the craving for burgers and went here based off a recommendation. Juniper did not disappoint! The truffle burger was cooked perfectly and I liked how they offer the option of sweet potato fries. Perhaps my favorite part of Juniper is that it is a BYOB location which is tougher to come by in NY. Overall, this is a great place for a relaxed eating out night. We will be back to try the rest of the menu dishes.",5.0
The chorizo burger (cooked medium) with gouda is where it's at. The spicy fries are also really good. We checked out this place after seeing the many positive reviews on Yelp and definitely lived up to the hype. Next time I would try the truffle burger and the pulled pork sandwich.,5.0
Came here on a Sunday afternoon. Stopped at the store picked up a 6 pack because I read on yelp it was BYOB. No problem. Small menu but the food is amazing.  They have 3 burgers on the menu and I tried them all. Excellent. Mac n cheese on point. Fried shrimp great. Decor was plain but I was starving so I just wanted goodFood and that's what I got. Great place to go for lunch. I recommend for a stop and grab. Would return.,4.0

We ordered 5 appetizers and 4 entrees, it came out to about 140, which is really good for the amount of food,after eating we were on our last glass of wine when the woman who works there (Asian I believe) who was not our waiter came over our table and asked if we could move to the bar because there is a group waiting outside and their food was about to come out of the kitchen.........WHAT!?why do we have to move to the bar? why couldn't the group just wait at the bar like any other restaurant would of done.I was speechless! we just looked at each other and just told her we are leaving, paid and left. If she would of looked at our glasses she would of seen that we were going to leave in less than 5 minutes, i understand if we were there for hours not really buying anything, but we did wait an hour outside! we ordered a lot of food! literally had just finished eating.I always raved about this place because it was my favorite go to summer spot. but what she did on my birthday was just wrong. No one should ever be told to get up from their table and move. It felt wrong in so many ways, wont be going back. Extremely disappointed.",1.0

"When passing by, Juniper looks like a burger joint crammed into a sizable closet. What I didn't know was they had seating outside in an incredibly spacious ""patio"". Another discovery - this place is BYOB. Usually a good thing, though would have preferred more of a heads up. Friends placed my order while I ran down to the nearby deli for a quick 6-pack. Order took way longer than expected (some people who sat later got their food first, so that was a bit annoying); luckily we had beer to keep us occupied. Settled on the truffle burger with gouda cheese and spicy fries ($15). Burger was thick and cooked well, though I wish I had added bacon to make it perfect. The fries indeed had a good kick, so I didn't have to add any ketchup/sauce.Food here is amazing but service is lacking (had to run down the waiter for the check). Also, this place is expensive for a cash-only business (if you charge over $10 for a burger, then take credit cards).",3.0
"What a hidden gem tucked away in Williamsburg where you have so many options to dine out. We had the craving for burgers and went here based off a recommendation. Juniper did not disappoint! The truffle burger was cooked perfectly and I liked how they offer the option of sweet potato fries. Perhaps my favorite part of Juniper is that it is a BYOB location which is tougher to come by in NY. Overall, this is a great place for a relaxed eating out night. We will be back to try the rest of the menu dishes.",5.0
The chorizo burger (cooked medium) with gouda is where it's at. The spicy fries are also really good. We checked out this place after seeing the many positive reviews on Yelp and definitely lived up to the hype. Next time I would try the truffle burger and the pulled pork sandwich.,5.0
Came here on a Sunday afternoon. Stopped at the store picked up a 6 pack because I read on yelp it was BYOB. No problem. Small menu but the food is amazing.  They have 3 burgers on the menu and I tried them all. Excellent. Mac n cheese on point. Fried shrimp great. Decor was plain but I was starving so I just wanted goodFood and that's what I got. Great place to go for lunch. I recommend for a stop and grab. Would return.,4.0
"Not impressed- brought some friends here because Juniper was rumored to have a great burger- but this item was definitely a let down; somehow it was simultaneously too greasy and too dry (truly an amazing feat). Not only that, but the food took forever  (in a totally empty restaurant on a Friday night), it was cash only (annoying) and a there was some absurd corking fee (really annoying). On the bright side- the wings were decent and the servers were really nice. Hoping this was just an off night, but when there's about 10 other competitors in the neighborhood that do it better, I most likely will not be going back.",2.0
"We're not sure why this place has not generated much more hype in Williamsburg than it currently does.  What an amazing restaurant!  The category of ""American"" and ""Burgers"" just do not give this restaurant enough credit.  Food is amazing!  We love flavor in our foods, spiciness, saltiness, fattiness, just a lot of flavor and Juniper does not disappoint.We ordered the special Jerk Wings and the Cajun Seafood Pasta with Andouille sausage.  Just a warning: these items are not for the light of heart, you better enjoy spiciness or you will be miserable.  With that said, the wings were amazingly moist on the insides and the flavor was wonderful.  Then 2 bites later, the wings' spiciness kicks in and you really wish you had some milk.  We followed the wings with the cajun seafood pasta.  The pasta was loaded with seafood in a red cajun sauce; there were mussels, shrimp, fish, calamari, and sausage all over a bed of linguine.  This, too, had a spicy kick but nothing like the jerk wings.  The dish itself is big enough to share between two light eaters.  Restaurant is BYOB and CASH ONLY, keep that in mind.  And I think because of these facts, they were able to keep the prices so low for the amount of food you get.  Definitely a recommended spot for dinner!",5.0
"I came to Juniper on a cold snowy Sunday evening and was warmly welcomed into cozy little space by our friendly server.  This 6 table restaurant has got a lot of character and charm despite the fact that there is nothing really special about the restaurant's ambiance nor its decor.  This cash only joint serves up some delicious and large portion-sized comfort food with a smile.  Our server, a gentleman, who was so friendly truly helped make the restaurant what it is.  To eat, I had the pulled pork sandwich with fries and my friends had the mac-n-cheese.  The pulled pork was delicious and filling and the fries were perfectly spiced.  My friend ordered the mac-n-cheese, which was a large cheesy-ooey portion of goodness, but I felt like it lacked a little bit of flavor.  I will definitely be back here.  This place is awesome.",5.0

"Went to Juniper last night with a large group of friends (8 adults, plus my 2-year-old toddler) and had a phenomenal experience. It is now my new favorite spot in Williamsburg! First off, the food was unbelievably good. Gourmet comfort food in a cozy and unpretentious space. The burger was delicious and the sweet potato fries were perfectly crisp. Husband ordered a spicy Cajun pasta that was out of this world (my son tried some and even though it was too hot for him, he was still clamoring for more!) Another friend ordered what had to be the prettiest chicken pot pie I'd ever seen.Service was very warm and welcoming. The owner (at least I think it was him?) was  friendly and accommodating with our large party. He even went out of his way to make sure my son had everything he needed so we could enjoy our dinner. It's not always easy taking a toddler out to eat b/c they get restless, so I always appreciate when owners/waiters recognize this enough to make that extra effort. Not to mention, my kid enjoyed the food so much, he barely made a peep the entire night. Too busy shoveling food in his mouth.We will definitely be back (with or without the kid in tow!)",5.0
"Stuffed my face and my stomach to the maximum capacity, that's how good this place was. I'm not going to pretend like I didn't have trouble getting up from my seat, because I did. One of few places with decently sized portions. And I'm a tiny girl at 120 lbs and 5'7'' - it's not like I'm training for man vs. food. The bbq chicken wings were finger lickin good. Perfectly crisp with the best sauce I've had in a while. Had me knawing on my bones for ages. Got the pulled pork sandwich which was also sublime. Spicy fries were a little overfried, but coleslaw, check. Sublime bbq sauce, check. Quality meat with robust flavor, check.

"Came here expecting the place to be super crowded, but it was fairly empty on a Saturday evening. A few of us had been day-drinking in Williamsburg, and we were looking for a good burger place, and Yelp came up with Juniper. We didn't realize it was BYOB and when the waiter told us, I quickly jumped up and ran to the nearest wine shop/bodega. Great decision. There is a liquor store right across the street and the bodega is a little further up the street, at the corner of the block. We were seated in the outdoor back patio. It wasn't very ornately decorated or anything, but I did really enjoy the backyard lounge feel. Started off with the chicken wings. Didn't like that there were only 7 wings per order, but the sauce was definitely better than most buffalo wing sauces I've tried in the city. It had a bit of thickness and texture to it, which again, is rare in the city. I ordered the chorizo burger, which had a bit of spice to it, which I loved. It was a little overdone, but the cheese helped mask the dryness. I did like that the burgers themselves were larger and came with all the fixings, which surprisingly doesn't always happen at burger joints. Came with a healthy portion of fries and you could pick regular, spicy, or sweet potato fries, which was pretty killer. Fries were cooked just right, and just the right thickness. Heh. I also tried my friend's slow cooked rib sandwich, and that was damn good. I'm a bit surprised that it wasn't busier, but I'm also cool with always being able to get a table. I'll definitely be back, mostly because of the laid-back atmosphere, BYOB, and delicious burgers.",4.0
"My friends and I got to this place pretty close to closing time. We were already pretty drunk-so we obviously needed some food after a fun filled day. Annoyances that may have been more annoying if we weren't already drunk and it wasn't right before closing: they don't take credit cards and they took forever to take our order. BUT...They had outdoor seating, its BYOB and my food was good! Once the waiter finally came, he was really cool. The atmosphere felt like someone's backyard so it felt really comfortable! There isn't a lot of space here so I feel like there may be long waits earlier in the day (but I could be wrong). I got a bacon burger with sweet potato fries-just what my drunk self needed! Yum!

"I love this place, Best burger. Chorizo burger is fabulous. Mac and cheese is a great side. It's BYOB! Don't ever change Juniper. There is a great little wine store across the street and slightly north up the block where you have an amazing selection of good and reasonably priced wine ($8 and up) from all over the world. I wish I could BYOB everywhere because NYC drink prices are a joooke.

"I've been here about 3 times already and can not get enough of this place & every time I go I make sure I have something different. The food is unbelievably delicious, made fresh to order and never disappoints. The first time I tried the pulled pork sandwich with sweet potato fries and it was perfection. The second time I had the Mac & cheese with bacon and it is HEAVENLY. My third time around I encountered the truffle burger which was as delicious of a burger as I have ever had. The only draw backs are that the menu seems to be missing a few items, because I have seen people order things that I did not see on the menu & it's cash only. Oh and I forgotto mention that this great place is b.y.o.b. Other then that very small draw backs this place is amazing for a great meal. As long as juniper is around they will have a life long customer. My suggestion go as many times as you can and try something new because they will not disappoint.",4.0
"We were looking for a brunch place after landing in NYC and this one had good reviews on yelp so we thought why not give it a shot. We were surely not disappointed with the food.

As I walked up to the location a few minutes earlier than we planned I noticed the front sign said ""cash only"" so I walked over to the Duane Reade in the area and got some cash, I didn't want anything to get in the way of what I was already anticipating to be a great night of good food and company.

When my friend finally arrived we started to combover the menu to finalize what we were going to eat. A group of 5 walked in as we were about to order and asked the waitress if they had room for them and she came over and asked us if we mind if she moved us and I said YES and she proceeded to just say well they're a bigger group and you have to move. Mind you the group said it was fine if they sat at another pair of tables that all they had to do was put together, but the waitress was still insisting we move.

Been here twice already. It is a group of 3. I order the rib sandwich with regular french fries. My sister order the chorizo burger while my mother just got a regular burger both with sweet potatoes fries. Finally we ordered mac and cheese with bacon. All delicious!Indeed it is BYOB. We come on a whim to the restaurant so we didn't come prepared  but good thing there is a liquor store across the street (not much variety). We had amazing service from Rafael who works there.  While he wasn't our waiter but he always went out of his way to make sure we always had water . That really establishes superb service.  We only saw our waitress once when she took the order. I hope Rafael got the full tip. Would definitely come again! Thanks Rafael for making the experience even better.,5.0
"I'm mixed about this place because the food was very good, but a series of unfortunate events occurred which scarred me from liking this place.At first, the decor of the place seemed kind of ""industrial"", but maybe it was actually just junky and cheap since the chairs do not seem to be of high quality (more about that later on).I got the jambalaya and mac and cheese (both which were phenomenal), but halfway through my meal, the chair I was sitting in caved in from underneath me. It felt like everything happened in slow motion, and the next thing I know, I'm laying on my back on the floor. Not only was my fall slightly painful, but it was also obviously embarrassing. Now I would understand if I were morbidly obese, but I'm only 150 pounds. 150 pound people shouldn't be breaking chairs! Due to this unfortunate experience, I am slightly hesitant of sitting in rickety wooden chairs now.Later in my meal, I found a piece of plastic in my Mac & Cheese, but I didn't want to make a scene because I honestly just wanted to get out of the place. The Mac & Cheese was excellent, but I am not a big fan of hard plastic in my food.The most disappointing thing about this entire experience was that the owner charged me full price for the meal. I should have moaned and groaned in pain on the floor a little bit instead of hopping back up right away. I think after everything that occurred, they could have at least put the meal on them.

"Wow, this place served some of the best food I've ever had.Ordered catfish poppers as appetizer and it was fried to perfection with a very tasty Tatar sauce.I had the seafood pasta and boy was I pleased with this dish. Not only is the portion huge, the flavor of this dish is amazing. Very generous amount of seafood and the sauce is extremely flavorful. The sauce is watery than most pasta sauce but that's fine with me, I wish there was some bread to soak up all the sauce but then again, there was enough pasta for days.My girlfriend ordered the truffle burger with the spicy fries..must get !! (I was a bit skeptical on the spicy, but it was definitely enough of a Cajun kick to make it spicy but not overwhelmingly spicy) . The truffle burger was a juicy thick burger, super flavorful as well and cooked to perfection.The worker was very quick to refill the water, must have refilled at least 3-5 times. Very good service.Can't wait to come back and try the other dishes. They all look so good.",5.0

I wish I could rewind time I would go right back to when my food was being served!!! Juniper is definitely going on my brooklyn must try list the food is too good to pass up. First off the place is really quint and homey just how I like it; anyway we started with the apps We ordered the pulled pork sliders and bbq wings which was amazing I mean everything was so fresh and well seasoned. Now for our mains we all ordered the grilled beef burger which were the bomb like seriously the burger itself was like the size of my face and they served it on a toasted brioche bun my favorite!!!!! Overall juniper will be seeing me a lot this summer,5.0
Been here twice already. It is a group of 3. I order the rib sandwich with regular french fries. My sister order the chorizo burger while my mother just got a regular burger both with sweet potatoes fries. Finally we ordered mac and cheese with bacon. All delicious!Indeed it is BYOB. We come on a whim to the restaurant so we didn't come prepared  but good thing there is a liquor store across the street (not much variety). We had amazing service from Rafael who works there.  While he wasn't our waiter but he always went out of his way to make sure we always had water . That really establishes superb service.  We only saw our waitress once when she took the order. I hope Rafael got the full tip. Would definitely come again! Thanks Rafael for making the experience even better.,5.0
"I'm mixed about this place because the food was very good, but a series of unfortunate events occurred which scarred me from liking this place.At first, the decor of the place seemed kind of ""industrial"", but maybe it was actually just junky and cheap since the chairs do not seem to be of high quality (more about that later on).I got the jambalaya and mac and cheese (both which were phenomenal), but halfway through my meal, the chair I was sitting in caved in from underneath me. It felt like everything happened in slow motion, and the next thing I know, I'm laying on my back on the floor. Not only was my fall slightly painful, but it was also obviously embarrassing. Now I would understand if I were morbidly obese, but I'm only 150 pounds. 150 pound people shouldn't be breaking chairs! Due to this unfortunate experience, I am slightly hesitant of sitting in rickety wooden chairs now.Later in my meal, I found a piece of plastic in my Mac & Cheese, but I didn't want to make a scene because I honestly just wanted to get out of the place. The Mac & Cheese was excellent, but I am not a big fan of hard plastic in my food.The most disappointing thing about this entire experience was that the owner charged me full price for the meal. I should have moaned and groaned in pain on the floor a little bit instead of hopping back up right away. I think after everything that occurred, they could have at least put the meal on them. It seems like they cared more about their profits than the customer.Ah well, I guess.",2.0

"This place was a great find, my friend and i were looking for something to eat at quickly before heading out to Viva Toro. I yelped and out popped Juniper.It's very old fashioned inside, its kind of like going into someones old home. Lol. It seemed cozy enough though, the chairs were uncomfortable as hell, but i wasnt going there to relax, i came to eat. Its BYOB, wish i knew before i came there.  The staff are friendly, they take CASH only, and they use a GINORMOUS old fashioned cash register. They do have an ATM machine inside in case you forget to bring cash.FOOD:As an appetizer, we had the fried shrimp. It was breaded nicely.  The shrimp was pretty jumbo and they give you a pretty good amount. It came with like a sweet/spicy sauce which went well with the shrimp. Shrimp was nice and crispy. I cant wait to try their catfish balls!I'm a hamburger fiend, so i got the Chorizo Burger with cheddar cheese and the spicy fries.  I kid you not when i say, BEST burger i have ever had. Oh so perfectly juicy, perfect size, the brioche bun went oh so well with it. I have been looking for a new burger spot for awhile now, and i'm glad i found Juniper! Spicy fries were perfectly crispy and seasoned very well.  Just the right amount of spice.  They were basically cajun fries.  And it came with this spicy mayo concoction that went fantastic with my brioche bun. My friend got the truffle burger with american cheese and sweet potato fries, i didnt get to taste her burger but it looked delish and she thought it was pretty delicious too. I did however, have some of her fries. Normally, when i order sweet potato fries, they are not usually crispy, but these were perfect! They were basically shoestring sweet potato fries. Awesome!Overall, i would definitely come back here for the food, and BMOB (bring my own beer) Lol. Also, i knocked off 1 star because the place could use an upgrade, but i guess that's how they want it to look. Who cares though cause the food was bomb!",4.0

The menu has a wide variety for pretty much anyone. I saw the pictures of the pulled pork on here and decided that's what I wanted. They ran out of regular and spicy fries so we had to get sweet potato. Eh. The pulled pork was delicious but didn't like the slight hint of spicy it had. The bun was super delicious. The sweet potato fries were crunchy but I just don't like sweet potato fries but if I did these would be good. My friend ordered the baked Mac and cheese and chicken fingers. Didn't try the Mac and cheese but he said it was pretty basic. It took about 40 min for them to make it, which is fine because it's fresh but needed maybe a bit more seasoning or some other ingredient. The chicken tenders were delicious. Nice and crunchy and the chicken is soft and moist. They just need to update their menu on their website so it's accurate. Wanted a grilled cheese but they changed their menu.",4.0

This is my first food review. I felt compelled to write because of how awful our experience was. The food was average for the price. My ribs special was overpriced for the value and taste. I asked for barbecue sauce because it was lacking taste and it  was never delivered. Same for the truffle burger and the seafood pasta was way too spicy. The worst part of our experience was the service. We waited over an hour to get our food and we weren't alone. Another customer also complained in front of us.

"This place is a hidden wburg gem. I've probably walked by it a billion times and not even noticed it. In a neighborhood where even the street vendors have hype, juniper is modest and unpretentious, as if it is unaware of the madness going on all around it. This is a place where locals, scruffy hipsters and inebriated old timers alike, can camp out with their byo tallboy and not be bothered on a Saturday. I got a pulled pork sandwich with spicy fries. The servings are huuuuuge, so my sandwich came overstuffed with juicy barbecue-saucy meat and a pile of hot, crispy, just-made french fries coated in Cajun seasoning. The flavor of the pork was right on, not too spicy, a hint of sweetness and vinegar. A little coleslaw would have been welcome though, just to break up the grease-party a bit. I also got a sneak peek of some other dishes and everything looked great. As a rule I had been wary of this 'hood on the weekends, but I could see juniper becoming a go-to spot.",4.0

On top of that, the staff was so very sweet, and accommodating, which is a rarity in NYC... Especially in Brooklyn, NY! Btw, we ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich, (Which came with incredibly yummy sweet potato fries), and a dish of their Mac & Cheese, with bacon, (Huge Portion!+ Oh so creamy!!).

"Don't really understand the hype about this place. The outdoor seating is a plus, but the decor is just kind of blah. I didn't find the staff to be friendly, they seemed bothered and rushed and more interested in constantly smoking cigarettes out in front than tending to their customers. Food took a bit long to come out and it would be nice if they took credit card and if they also had a drink menu as well - that would probably bump up the experience a bit for me. The fries were a disappointment. Definitely not handcut and the sweet potato fries got cold in a second. The pulled pork sandwich and the rib sandwich were very good, though, as well as the mac and cheese but nothing outstanding - I've definitely had better, but it's a decent place to come to if you're looking for a ""quick"" bite to eat. I wouldn't come back here, but I wouldn't NOT recommend it anybody. It's more of just an ""eh.""",3.0

"Nasty burger wrapped in a nice bun.So they use a great bun on the burger, unfortunately the burger patty itself (the most important thing about a burger) was an undercooked sub-par piece of meat. Whenever a restaurant adds spices to a burger, they are trying to cover up that they use cheap beef.To make matters worse, we waited for almost 20 minutes just to get a check. The staff was friendly but too focused on talking with their friends outside then dealing with their customers. The decor inside is not very nice either, very messy behind the counter, makes you think what state the kitchen is in. I wouldn't recommend Juniper to anyone, stay away.",1.0

"Juniper is a very quirky place that serves up delicious burgers as well as a few southern inspired specialties. I love that they have a choice between sweet potato, regular or spicy fries. Of course I'd choose the sweet potato fries over the other two, naturally. Their mussels are delicious. I love the broth it came with cause I love dunking the bread into the flavorful broth. I also enjoyed their mac and cheese. Although not salty enough the mac n cheese held up based on its texture. I believe they put very fine breadcrumbs on top of their mac and cheese for an added crunch? Overall, a nice cozy place. The waiter was super duper nice. My friend left her scarf at the restaurant, we walked almost half a block away and he still ran after us to return her scarf. sooo nice!",3.0
"This place is a hidden wburg gem. I've probably walked by it a billion times and not even noticed it. In a neighborhood where even the street vendors have hype, juniper is modest and unpretentious, as if it is unaware of the madness going on all around it. This is a place where locals, scruffy hipsters and inebriated old timers alike, can camp out with their byo tallboy and not be bothered on a Saturday. I got a pulled pork sandwich with spicy fries. The servings are huuuuuge, so my sandwich came overstuffed with juicy barbecue-saucy meat and a pile of hot, crispy, just-made french fries coated in Cajun seasoning. The flavor of the pork was right on, not too spicy, a hint of sweetness and vinegar. A little coleslaw would have been welcome though, just to break up the grease-party a bit. I also got a sneak peek of some other dishes and everything looked great. As a rule I had been wary of this 'hood on the weekends, but I could see juniper becoming a go-to spot.",4.0

"This place was a first for my boyfriend, and I, and to be honest we were both blown away by how amazingly well seasoned the food was. This place was actually discovered here on Yelp, and we decided to give it a try, on a whim, based on all of the amazing reviews. I've gotta tell ya, we made the right decision!! On top of that, the staff was so very sweet, and accommodating, which is a rarity in NYC... Especially in Brooklyn, NY! Btw, we ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich, (Which came with incredibly yummy sweet potato fries), and a dish of their Mac & Cheese, with bacon, (Huge Portion!+ Oh so creamy!!). We look forward to having the leftovers for brunch tomorrow! Highly recommended!",5.0

Was in here a couple of weeks ago. At first they didn't have seating for two except for by the restrooms and no one wants to sit by the restrooms. So we requested to sit at one of the 3 or more tables of the 3 that were available. She asked if we would move if she needed it. I'm thinking to myself not if I'm eating my dinner. But she was adamant that I agree to move before allowing me to sit down. My friend agreed. We sat well the food was absolutely delicious! I had the catfish sandwich and sweet potato fries...it made up for our introduction with the seating arrangements. I would've given it 5 stars but the intro was a turn off and our waiter was a tad bit slow with basic drink service.,3.0
Came here a few weeks back. Employees were super friendly and helpful. I read everyone raving here on yelp about the chorizo burger which I do not find what the hype was about. Luckily my gf and I shared dinners. We also got the fish sandwich which was 100x better then the chorizo burger. Something else I liked about this place is it was BYOB with a liquor store across the street. I live on Long Island and would def go back to enjoy the fish sandwich again. It totally be worth the trip.,5.0
"Talk about wow! First off the BBQ wings were everything, crispy and the BBQ sauce was delicious. I ordered the chicken tenders and fries which were sooo freaking good. Idk what kinda coating was on the chicken tenders but it made them super crispy and still juicy. I will definitely be making another trip back. The only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars is because they don't have a burger that doesn't have red meat, like a turkey burger or veggie burger. But that's just my personal preference. Either way give this place a try you won't be disappointed!",4.0

In an area where everyone feels so entitled (for who knows what reason), this place makes you feel like you are at home.

"Came here with a six pack and five friends hoping to split some appetizers and drink some beers before heading to an event.First of all, ignore the reviews that say that there's no corking fee. It's $1 per beer and $5 for a bottle of wine, and you have to open them yourself although they provide a bottle opener. I was considering leaving upon hearing that but decided to stay as I was only going to have one beer, but, regardless, that was the first strike (actually second, after it being cash only).When we finally ordered, our table of six got some sliders, some chicken wings and a burger. So, not much food but considering we were already paying per beer we felt like it would be fine. Apparently not, as the server quickly let us know that they ""usually don't do this, but since you guys are a big table and you only got like three apps, and we get busy on Saturday nights, maybe you should keep an eye on the time"" (paraphrased slightly, but that was the gist).

"Walking into Juniper, I was taken aback by how small it is with limited seating in the front.  We must have hit it just right, being seated immediately, because people started rolling in in droves, each carrying a bottle of wine or six pack of beer.  Did I mention it's BYOB?  There must be a black hole through the kitchen because a whole slew of people went through there.  Apparently there's some nice garden seating out the back.DO NOT call this diner food.  This is comfort food at it's best.  Tom, the chef & owner serves up some of the most amazing dishes from an albeit limited menu, but makes each dish his own and with a lotta love & care.  To say that the menu is eclectic is an understatement.  It is a true American melting pot from all over the country with the chef adding his signature, accents & spins on classics.  He even made it a point to come out during a lull in the kitchen to greet his guests and make sure everybody liked their food.We started with the (mmmmm) catfish poppers & mussels w/wine, garlic & shallots.  The mussels were on the small side, but went really well with the shallots on top of crustini.  The broth of the mussels was so good, we were using the half shells as spoons and drinking it as soup!  I really couldn't decide on an entree because I wanted to try everything from the Truffle burger to the Jambalaya.  I decided to lay off the meat and go with the Linguini & Shrimp, which at $15 was the most expensive dish on the menu (along with the Jambalaya), super bargains.  It came with 7 colossal shrimp in a similar broth as the mussels but with parmesan cheese for added depth.  The rest of the family had Pulled Pork & Catfish sandwiches & the Jambalaya.  We even shared a huge green salad to add some roughage in there.  We saw the mac & cheese at the next table and it was HUGE!  We'll have to try that next time.When Peter D gives it 5 stars, you better well show up there with your cash in hand.  Oh and it is cash only.",5.0

"We came here after coming from another restaurant nearby because of a pretty bad experience. The storefront looked pretty bare but we walked in where there was 1 table and our server behind the bar.

The Jambalaya was had a ton of mussels and sausage, a couple of shakes of hot sauce and it was almost perfect.

Fortunately, she couldn't finish but I was able to finish my Jambalaya and still make room for the leftover she had so I can honestly say that the catfish sammie and fries were definitely a good choice.Service wise there were no bumps.

"Went to Juniper with a large group of friends and had an AWESOME time! There wasn't a table for us so we waited around the bar area but we were able to place an order before we were seated to expedite the process.Had the Truffle Burger, the Jambalaya, Fish and Chips - everything was PHENOMENAL. Will def be back~~Not sure if the guy working there was the owner or manager but regardless, he was awesome. Honestly!! In an area where everyone feels so entitled (for who knows what reason), this place makes you feel like you are at home. Actually, might be better than home HAHA so accommodating!!The food is amazing and the owner is awesome, BYOB - what else could you possibly ask for?! Will definitely have to come back to try the Mac and Cheese!!",5.0

"The service was great. The one gentleman who was at the bar also tended to the tables and was polite as well as attentive. The pulled pork sliders were delicious and the steak sandwich was  great. Not greasy and the cheese was just the right amount. The street potato fries may have been the frozen kind, but were cooked well. The Mac and cheese was bland. Tastes like the boxed kind with breadcrumbs on it. Overall a great place. Would definitely go back for the pulled pork sliders.",5.0
"Came here with a six pack and five friends hoping to split some appetizers and drink some beers before heading to an event.First of all, ignore the reviews that say that there's no corking fee. It's $1 per beer and $5 for a bottle of wine, and you have to open them yourself although they provide a bottle opener. I was considering leaving upon hearing that but decided to stay as I was only going to have one beer, but, regardless, that was the first strike (actually second, after it being cash only).When we finally ordered, our table of six got some sliders, some chicken wings and a burger. So, not much food but considering we were already paying per beer we felt like it would be fine. Apparently not, as the server quickly let us know that they ""usually don't do this, but since you guys are a big table and you only got like three apps, and we get busy on Saturday nights, maybe you should keep an eye on the time"" (paraphrased slightly, but that was the gist).

"Quirky, informal, slow, cozy, delicious.The food here is amazing. Slow cooked BBQ ribs, pulled pork, fried chicken... On and on, this is a real culinary delight.

Occasionally you will find one small item here or there that misses the mark a bit, but over and over again, their meals are so damn good. Don't come here expecting to rush, come here when you want to relax, enjoy the cozy inside or the pleasant garden. The service is a sometimes super attentive and friendly -- but often very slow -- the meals can take a while to come out. Go there *knowing* this, and also knowing that, oh man, when it does come out it's well worth it.

In addition, the burger that this person also ordered rivaled any gourmet burger I have either seen or tried. Definitely a must try for my next visit.A few downsides would be that unfortunately they don't serve beer. However our host/waiter (who was friendly & attentive) made some suggestions on where we could buy some & bring it in to enjoy our dinner.

There was no music in the garden. I liked this a lot because it is quite hard to find a good place around in which music does not play at festival noise level.Service: there were two waiters. They were very friendly and attentive. Always checking on our wishes.Food: i had the grilled burger with spicy fries. It comes with a side salad. This was one of the best burgers i ever had. The meat was very juicy and had a great texture. There were no greasy sauces added beforehand so i only added a tiny bit of ketchup and some cucumber - turned out perfect.

The burger was delicious, such a clean flavor and it wasn't overloaded with truffle oil to the point of only tasting that I ordered it with swiss which added to the flavor. The portions are big!!

I am so glad I did not protest. What a gem! What a treat! I had the truffle burger, which was just the most perfectly medium-cooked patty, topped with sauteed portobello slices and drizzled in truffle oil. I almost have truffle fatigue at this point, but the craftsmanship of this burger made this flavor combination seem as fresh as the first time I tried it. Tom the cook and Raphael the server are great people.

"I came for lunch on a Friday at 1:30. There was one other table occupied. Our food took 30 minutes to come and was mediocre, at best. The fries were really the only tasty part. My wife had a chicken sandwich special with avocado. The avocado was unripe and hard. Why have a special when a crucial ingredient isn't ready to serve? I won't return to this restaurant.",2.0
"Oh hell yes. Not only did I have one of the best burgers I've ever eaten IN MY LIFE, the chef and server were so nice that we were basically friends at the end of the meal.When my friend suggested this spot, I almost protested because it is three things that I don't love: it's in Williamsburg (so hard to get to from Crown Heights), it's cash-only, and it's BYOB. I am so glad I did not protest. What a gem! What a treat! I had the truffle burger, which was just the most perfectly medium-cooked patty, topped with sauteed portobello slices and drizzled in truffle oil. I almost have truffle fatigue at this point, but the craftsmanship of this burger made this flavor combination seem as fresh as the first time I tried it. Tom the cook and Raphael the server are great people. Raphael was super friendly and was joking around with us within a few minutes, and Tom came out from the kitchen to chat about the restaurant business and the changing neighborhood. We had the best time. Krystal, I'll never doubt you again. You pick all the places we go from now on.",5.0
"The food is always tasty here.  Service is excellent, especially if you get the young man who whizzes around doing everything (greet, take orders, bring food out, AND bus tables).  The chef is extremely nice.  The last time I dined in, the chef stopped by every patron's table to ensure that the food was to our liking, which it ABSOLUTELY was!  I had the truffle burger, which was juicy and delicious.  My friend ordered the cajun seafood pasta, which was definitely worth it, as it was packed with shrimps and other yumminess.  The food is not light so be ready to loosen your belt, but it is all delicious.  I don't usually like cash only restaurants, but this place is priced reasonably so it doesn't bother me.  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Juniper.  GO NOW!",5.0
"This place was a total surprise. I've seen it many times while passing by, but for some reason I never decided to get in. The other day we couldn't find a place to have brunch and Juniper was the only restaurant with a table for us. So we gave it a try.. and so happy that we did!First off, the food is delicious. I tried the pulled pork sandwich and I tell you, it was the best I've ever had. The place is charming, the atmosphere relaxed, so unlike the other restaurants in the area. We could talk to each other with no need of screaming. It felt like we were some place in NOLA instead of in the middle of hipster Williamsburg. Pleasant experience.

"Came here for the first time recently because of the good reviews on Yelp. As others have said, yes, the place is small and a bit dark inside, but the food is delicious.

The owners were nice, and gladly answered any questions we had about the menu. Although it's cash only, they do have an ATM in the back (although it was broken when we went).

"Came here because of the glowing reviews and it's proximity to movie theater. So many trendy burger places out there so I have to be a little strict with the review.

Read about their truffle burger so I ordered it with welcome additions of cheddar and bacon. Anything with truffles is really expensive so I became a little suspicious when the burger price was set at fifteen bucks and their other burgers are around twelve. I've seen the 60 Minutes investigative piece on Chinese truffles trying to be passed off for authentic French truffles so the price drop was not hard to figure out. Either way, truffles or no truffles, the burger really didn't knock my socks off. At least the sweet potato fries that came with burger were great. Having to wait about an hour to get our food was the real issue we had with this place. Thankfully, our movie didn't start til much later so we had time.

"The Burger has been perfected!!!! The girlfriend and I were in the neighborhood and I have been wanting to go to this place for a while so we said why not. It was a Saturday evening and at first we wondered why we were the only ones in the restaurant, but as other patrons walked in and asked to be seated in the back we learned that the place had a back area. We kind of wised we were given the option to sit in the back but inside was just fine. The food is made to order so expect to wait a while for your meal. It's also BYOB. Both waiters were really nice and personable, they held small talk with us and this place definitely has a family feeling to it. On to the food.... Slamming!!! My girlfriend had the Truffel burger and I had the regular. This place has perfected the burger in such a way that cannot be described with words. Even the fries are excellent.

"This is a really cute place. My brother and I came here after searching for a good lunch place in BK. He and I both got the pulled pork which was so good. I pretty much always get pulled pork if it's on the menu. He got the sandwich and I got the sliders. The sauce on the sandwiches is different from sauce I've had before. It was a little spicy and tangy but it was great. We came here right after they opened on a Saturday. It was pretty dead even though the waiter seemed a little preoccupied. It was kind of annoying since we knew what we wanted to eat and drink just a few minutes after sitting down. If I were walking near here in the future, I'd probably stop in.",4.0

"Juniper came up as a search result as my friend and I explored Williamsburg. There were too many small restaurants we just couldn't choose, so we left it up to Yelp (and we happened to pass it at that exact moment). Even though there are 4 stars, there weren't that many people here on a late Saturday afternoon. My friend and I soon became the only patrons of this restaurant. Service was very friendly! Opting for something light, I got the Cajun shrimp salad. I love salads that are heavily doused in dressing. The tarteness of the balsamic vinegar dressing was a great contrast to the savory grilled shrimp. My friend ordered the fish and chips and out came a 12-inch piece of fish--the biggest I've ever seen. It looked greasy, but it didn't taste oily at all. The fish fell off in flakes, and a few dashes of malt vinegar was all you need. The fries that went with her dish were also delicious, I highly recommend that as a side order to whatever you decide to eat at Juniper. I will definitely come back here again if I feel like venturing to Williamsburg.",4.0
"I do not know where to start. We walk in on a Saturday, was not greeted so we just found a spot and sat. After about 15 mins i asked for a menu, and thats all i got. Then after a few more mins asked for some water. Thats all i got. Finally we got our order taken after i flagged someone down. She took it and thats all i got. After about 40 mins we got our food, i ordered the pulled pork sandwich it was good, the sweet potato fries were burnt and horrible. My friend got the bbq boneless rib sandwich i think, she said it was ok and didnt even finish it tough were were starving from waiting so long. OH and mind you i had to ask for silver ware once we got our food. Not sure if it was just too busy for them but yet i didnt look busy or was it that we were not yuppies or looked like them?

"I came in for lunch yesterday and walked in to find the place empty.  I was a bit confused until the nice women at the counter asked 'how many'?.  I said it would just be me and she offered a table in their back patio, since it was such a nice day.  Once I was out back, I realized THAT'S where all of the customers were!I ordered a shrimp linguine pasta and enjoyed the warm sun and cool breeze.The food took a bit of time to come out, but was well worth it.  The pasta was tender and swimming in a delicious white wine and garlic sauce.  The shrimp were big and juicy and seasoned just right.  I noticed they had other southern comfort foods on their menu (mac & cheese, catfish poboys, jambalaya, etc) so I am definitely coming back to try out the rest of their menu.  After my meal, my waitress (the woman who greeted me earlier) and her husband asked how I liked my meal.  I chatted with them a bit about my recent move and the weather and it was really nice to talk to local business owners (and the person who made my delicious food!).  If you are in the neighborhood, try out this place.  Good luck trying to figure out what to order, though.  There are too many good choices!",4.0

"The Burger has been perfected!!!! The girlfriend and I were in the neighborhood and I have been wanting to go to this place for a while so we said why not. It was a Saturday evening and at first we wondered why we were the only ones in the restaurant, but as other patrons walked in and asked to be seated in the back we learned that the place had a back area. We kind of wised we were given the option to sit in the back but inside was just fine. The food is made to order so expect to wait a while for your meal. It's also BYOB. Both waiters were really nice and personable, they held small talk with us and this place definitely has a family feeling to it. On to the food.... Slamming!!! My girlfriend had the Truffel burger and I had the regular. This place has perfected the burger in such a way that cannot be described with words. Even the fries are excellent. I will be sure to return.",5.0
"I've been having a burger craving for a really long time and I came here after the oyster happy hour at Maison Premiere (which is btw GREAT!).Got the truffle burger with gouda, medium rare - taste was good and cooked perfectly.  Nom.  Was totally a fan.Friends got the grilled burger.  They also enjoyed it =)Shared the Spicy fries and the sweet potato fries.  Both were delish!  Apparently you can request spicy sweet potato fries - the perfect combo! Wish we knew about that earlier.  So try ordering that next time! =)",4.0
"This is a really cute place. My brother and I came here after searching for a good lunch place in BK. He and I both got the pulled pork which was so good. I pretty much always get pulled pork if it's on the menu. He got the sandwich and I got the sliders. The sauce on the sandwiches is different from sauce I've had before. It was a little spicy and tangy but it was great. We came here right after they opened on a Saturday. It was pretty dead even though the waiter seemed a little preoccupied. It was kind of annoying since we knew what we wanted to eat and drink just a few minutes after sitting down. If I were walking near here in the future, I'd probably stop in.",4.0

"Juniper came up as a search result as my friend and I explored Williamsburg. There were too many small restaurants we just couldn't choose, so we left it up to Yelp (and we happened to pass it at that exact moment). Even though there are 4 stars, there weren't that many people here on a late Saturday afternoon. My friend and I soon became the only patrons of this restaurant. Service was very friendly! Opting for something light, I got the Cajun shrimp salad. I love salads that are heavily doused in dressing. The tarteness of the balsamic vinegar dressing was a great contrast to the savory grilled shrimp. My friend ordered the fish and chips and out came a 12-inch piece of fish--the biggest I've ever seen. It looked greasy, but it didn't taste oily at all. The fish fell off in flakes, and a few dashes of malt vinegar was all you need. The fries that went with her dish were also delicious, I highly recommend that as a side order to whatever you decide to eat at Juniper. I will definitely come back here again if I feel like venturing to Williamsburg.",4.0
"I do not know where to start. We walk in on a Saturday, was not greeted so we just found a spot and sat. After about 15 mins i asked for a menu, and thats all i got. Then after a few more mins asked for some water. Thats all i got. Finally we got our order taken after i flagged someone down. She took it and thats all i got. After about 40 mins we got our food, i ordered the pulled pork sandwich it was good, the sweet potato fries were burnt and horrible. My friend got the bbq boneless rib sandwich i think, she said it was ok and didnt even finish it tough were were starving from waiting so long. OH and mind you i had to ask for silver ware once we got our food. Not sure if it was just too busy for them but yet i didnt look busy or was it that we were not yuppies or looked like them?

"Juniper was a lovely lunch haven during my recent trip to NY. A haven because while it's definitely small, it's also quaint and polite and I didn't feel at all as though I was being rushed in and out so that my table could be turned as many times as possible. Perhaps the difference between eating lunch and eating dinner or maybe it's the difference between eating in Manhattan and eating in Brooklyn. I don't know. But, I do know that I enjoyed the fact that it felt like the restaurant wanted me there for as long as I wanted to be there. (Which, by the way was under an hour. I mean it's lunch time you know?)The exposed brick insides and chalk menus reminded me of some of my favorite spots in Denver and the menu itself reminded me of my delicious childhood in the South with a fancy touch at times. Things like the mac and cheese should be devoured. Things like the burgers should be savored, especially if it's truffled. Things like the waffles fries should be at all restaurants that serve any kind of fries. (What is it about waffling that makes a fry so much better? I may never know...)This spot is cash only so be prepared for that. And when I say they didn't rush us I also mean they were slow to take our order or bring our check so don't go if you're in a hurry or an impatient person in general.

"Ok....first off, this restaurant is HALF a step away from a fast food burger chain. I just so happen to be in the area looking for a good burger joint for me and my gf to eat at. I checked yelp and saw all these great reviews and decided to check it out. Upon arrival I knew that I was duped by my fellow yelp citizens. As I sat down and gazed at the menu I was distracted by the overwhelming cold draft of air that was circulating around the room. THE ABSCENSE of heat really made it hard for me and my company to enjoy ourselves. The shorten this review I have decided to take a bullet style approach :Cons--No Heat-High School Cafe Menu-I tried to order hot wings as an appetizer and was told they ""RAN OUT""..(really    though!!)-I Asked for a Sierra Mist and they gave me 75 cent can of Sierra Mist!!! lol -Fries were tooo salty -Cash Only Pros-Mussels were excellent and tasty-Burger was decent although they overpowered the burger I ordered by putting too much gorgonzola cheese. ( must be careful with that type of cheese!)- Fries were too- The chef actually delivered the food and asked how everything was at the end of the meal! REAL CLASSY IMO.Only recommend this spot for people looking for a quick quick meal. Without the service of selling mussels this place is looked at in my eyes as a half a step above in quality than five guys",2.0
"Juniper is a Williamsburg staple. This is the kind of place that makes a neighborhood.The chef (maybe owner too?) Tom hangs out in the front of house all the time and he will share all his techniques with you if you ask. He is so friendly and inviting and makes you feel like you came to see him so he can cook just for you.Prices are totally reasonable for the quality of food. The wings are insanely good time and time again and the Mac and cheese is hearty as you could hope for.It is BYOB, though, so keep that in mind. They're super cool with getting you glasses and they don't charge to open your bottle of wine. It's not hard to grab a box of wine on N8/Driggs and go to town, though.I love this place and I'll be coming back for as long as they're around.",5.0

"GOD DAMN. HOLY SHIT.JUST...WOW.Juniper is beyond amazing. There are just no words to describe how I felt when I dined here the other day. I have no complaints!Come here for the...1. FRIENDLY SERVICE - The waitress and the owner will come by and ask you your opinion, but not in an annoying way at all. In fact, you won't want them to leave because you'll have so many positive things to express to them.2. TOM - The owner alone is a damn good reason to come here. You can tell he is extremely passionate about what he does. He is a genuinely good person.3. ATMOSPHERE - Very casual. Totally unpretentious. A great place to relax and stuff your belly.4. PATIO - Could seat about 6 groups!5. CHICKEN TENDERS - You just have to try it. Chicken tenders battered in rice krispies. It is well worth the $6...but for now, you can get it for free (or any other appetizers) when you get 2 entrees and mention Yelp! It comes with BBQ or honey mustard. It was delicious with both.6. BURGERS - First of all it doesn't just taste amazing but it looks amazing. It looked like it was ready to be photographed for a food magazine or something. 7. BURGER BUNS - They use brioche, which is a very pleasant change from regular buns. It's sweet and goes so well with the burger. It just looks prettier too.8. CATFISH SANDWICH - Best catfish sandwich I've ever had. Perfect amount of tartar sauce...and once again, served on brioche. 9. FRIES - The fries came with the burger and sandwich. You get a choice of french fries, sweet potato fries, or spicy fries. The sweet potato fries will shock you at first because it's almost like you're eating air...but I mean that in a good way. The spicy fries are in waffle shapes and was perfectly crispy.10. Location - One block from the Bedford Ave L train stop, on Berry St. Very convenient, yet away from all the chaos. If my list doesn't entice you to dine here, there is something very wrong with you.",5.0
Came here with my friends for a birthday celebration. Food was great once again. I would try the catfish sandwich and jambalaya next time!!!

I finally asked the woman how long we should keep waiting, she told me another 15-20minutes! Wtf! I am sure she or the staff in the kitchen skipped or forgot our order! We decided to leave without any food! BTW,at least 3 flys flying in the restaurant,I wonder if the food there is clean enough!

The shorten this review I have decided to take a bullet style approach :Cons--No Heat-High School Cafe Menu-I tried to order hot wings as an appetizer and was told they ""RAN OUT""..(really    though!!)-I Asked for a Sierra Mist and they gave me 75 cent can of Sierra Mist!!! lol -Fries were tooo salty -Cash Only Pros-Mussels were excellent and tasty-Burger was decent although they overpowered the burger I ordered by putting too much gorgonzola cheese. ( must be careful with that type of cheese!)- Fries were too- The chef actually delivered the food and asked how everything was at the end of the meal! REAL CLASSY IMO.Only recommend this spot for people looking for a quick quick meal. Without the service of selling mussels this place is looked at in my eyes as a half a step above in quality than five guys",2.0
"Juniper is a Williamsburg staple. This is the kind of place that makes a neighborhood.The chef (maybe owner too?) Tom hangs out in the front of house all the time and he will share all his techniques with you if you ask. He is so friendly and inviting and makes you feel like you came to see him so he can cook just for you.Prices are totally reasonable for the quality of food. The wings are insanely good time and time again and the Mac and cheese is hearty as you could hope for.It is BYOB, though, so keep that in mind. They're super cool with getting you glasses and they don't charge to open your bottle of wine. It's not hard to grab a box of wine on N8/Driggs and go to town, though.I love this place and I'll be coming back for as long as they're around.",5.0
"I was shocked that this hipsterish cafe serves the best burger and fries in Brooklyn. Try it, you'll like it!",5.0
"This is a fantastic quality eatery in the Williamsburg neighborhood. Every time I visit, the food is outstanding and staff is awesome. Menu is smaller but perfected. Everything is prepared daily and fresh. I am not one to take time for reviews but this place is well deserved. Best Pulled pork sandwich I've ever had and Ive had plentyyyy of others. Check it out asap!",5.0
"I ordered one and only one thing here, the jambalaya, and it was some of the best I've ever tasted. (and I've lived in New Orleans and on the gulf coast for 3.5 years)It's definitely not a fine-dining establishment, and to be honest the server could have paid a little more attention to my water glass, but it was still very good and I left very happy about my experience here.",5.0
"We came here for lunch on Sunday. I had the catfish burger here with the spicy (cajun) fries, and my friend had their grilled burger with sweet potato fries - both were delicious! The restaurant wasn't very busy when we came, so we had very good service. The chef/owner even came out and exchanged a few words with us to make sure that we were enjoying our meals. Overall it was a great experience!",5.0
"GOD DAMN. HOLY SHIT.JUST...WOW.Juniper is beyond amazing. There are just no words to describe how I felt when I dined here the other day. I have no complaints!Come here for the...1. FRIENDLY SERVICE - The waitress and the owner will come by and ask you your opinion, but not in an annoying way at all. In fact, you won't want them to leave because you'll have so many positive things to express to them.2. TOM - The owner alone is a damn good reason to come here. You can tell he is extremely passionate about what he does. He is a genuinely good person.3. ATMOSPHERE - Very casual. Totally unpretentious. A great place to relax and stuff your belly.4. PATIO - Could seat about 6 groups!5. CHICKEN TENDERS - You just have to try it. Chicken tenders battered in rice krispies. It is well worth the $6...but for now, you can get it for free (or any other appetizers) when you get 2 entrees and mention Yelp! It comes with BBQ or honey mustard. It was delicious with both.6. BURGERS - First of all it doesn't just taste amazing but it looks amazing. It looked like it was ready to be photographed for a food magazine or something. 7. BURGER BUNS - They use brioche, which is a very pleasant change from regular buns. It's sweet and goes so well with the burger. It just looks prettier too.8. CATFISH SANDWICH - Best catfish sandwich I've ever had. Perfect amount of tartar sauce...and once again, served on brioche. 9. FRIES - The fries came with the burger and sandwich. You get a choice of french fries, sweet potato fries, or spicy fries. The sweet potato fries will shock you at first because it's almost like you're eating air...but I mean that in a good way. The spicy fries are in waffle shapes and was perfectly crispy.10. Location - One block from the Bedford Ave L train stop, on Berry St. Very convenient, yet away from all the chaos. If my list doesn't entice you to dine here, there is something very wrong with you.",5.0
Came here with my friends for a birthday celebration. Food was great once again. I would try the catfish sandwich and jambalaya next time!!! My friend ordered the pulled pork sandwich but it was in marinated with a spicy BBQ sauce so my friend couldn't really handle it. The mussel sauce was a bit salty. But I will still be back. We all had a great time!,4.0
"We chose this place because of the high review on yelp . We went this afternoon and the place was so empty,only one table customer,maybe some in the backyard,for sure they are not busy!We ordered BBQ rib sandwich and grill sandwich from a woman!After 20-30minutes,we were still waiting for our food! I finally asked the woman how long we should keep waiting, she told me another 15-20minutes! Wtf! I am sure she or the staff in the kitchen skipped or forgot our order! We decided to leave without any food! BTW,at least 3 flys flying in the restaurant,I wonder if the food there is clean enough! The service is not attentive,I saw a customer coming from backyard to ask for the ice water on a hot summer day! I will not give any star if possible on yelp!",1.0
"Disappointing. I was in the neighborhood and went on Yelp to find the best burger nearby, and this popped up. For $13 ($14 with cheese, and $2 more if you want bacon), the medium rare burger I ordered came out well done. After waiting for over 45 minutes for it to come out, I was too hungry to send it back. Or waitress took two smoke breaks outside while we were there, and the table next to us was served two courses well before our food arrived (they had paid and left before our burgers came out), despite arriving at the same time. The remaining waitstaff didn't cover for our absentee waitress, so we asked to pay and were eventually given a check, but no one thought to come back to collect our cash (it's cash only). We asked to pay again, cash in hand, while our now-embarrassed waitress - who was apparently uncomfortable from watching this transpire, but not uncomfortable enough to put down her cigarette, come back inside, and finish doing her job - watched from afar. We forked over close to $40 for our mediocre charred and flavorless meat (habitually tipping 20%, even against our better judgment sometimes, as here) and left in a hurry, mumbling to ourselves that we were foolish not to have gone to River Styx or Esme, for far better burgers around the same price or cheaper. As you may have guessed, we won't be returning, and hopefully this review serves as a warning to others.",1.0
"Ended up here by accident when I had some family in town. What a wonderful mistake! The food was killer! One of the best pork sandwiches I've ever had. The shrimp salad is super yummy too. The place is tiny, but we were there for lunch so it wasn't too cramped. Great food. Wish it wasn't byob though.",5.0
"Best pulled pork sandwich in Williamsburg, hands down.  Better than Fette Sau, Mables, and Fatty Cue.  The big downsides are- it's BYOB,- they don't deliver, and- you have to pay cash.",4.0
"Great pulled pork and great service at a great price.lI just went for the second time to Juniper with 2 friends. They were out of the rib sandwich so two of us had the pulled pork sandwich. It was fantastic! Meat was tender and moist, BBQ sauce was tasty (though not particularly creative), and the fries cooked perfectly. The other friend had the burger; she said it was good but not great. The total bill for us was under $40!",4.0
"One of the best restaurants I've been to in NY!Their menu is simple, but the server was nice to answer all the questions we had. I loved how quaint Juniper was. You walk in.. and it was almost like walking into your friend's restaurant. Very laid back and welcoming.My friend and I stopped by Juniper to share an early dinner. We weren't starving, but we could definitely share a good dish, so we decided to check this place out.We shared the truffle burger with spicy fries.. and boy, this burger totally hit the spot for us both! It was juicy, packed with flavor, and absolutely delicious! Cooked just right with just the perfect amount of spices. The spicy fries (you can consider them to be cajun fries) were also poppin hot and delicious.The chef/owner (?) came out and asked how our food was. We ended up talking to him for a good thirty minutes before we headed out. He was SO laid back and hilarious. We talked about his experience growing up in NYC and his visit to LA (I'm from LA, so we shared some good laughs). I hope to see him again next time and compliment him once again on our wonderful but short experience.Damn... we should've ordered their mac `n cheese.",5.0
This is a place that we like to visit when we are in the area. Very casual setting but the food is very good. We ordered the rib sandwich and it was cooked perfectly with a good amount of BBQ sauce on it. We also had the linguini and shrimp which was very garlicy which I like but definitely need to share with your dinner partner so both of your breath smells like garlic! Always a good place to recommend in the area.,4.0
"Monday night; the place was empty save for the guy on his laptop at the bar. BYOB; went across to get some wine and ordered the potpie. Took about 25-30 minutes but with fair warning. We weren't in any rush so my friend and I caught up and drank wine. No joke though, the owner/cook/waiter went out to get fresh veggies to put in our pot pies. The menu clearly says all orders are made-to-order so we were amused. The pot pie was banging. I had to have had at least 1/2 of chicken in my pot pie plus the filler was bomb, the crust was golden and flaky and was definitely a good serving size. I wanted to try the burger but wasn't that hungry so I will definitely be returning.",3.0
"Came here on a Saturday night after spending the latter half of the day at the Williamsburg fair.  When we arrived, there was that many people there so we had hoped to be out within an hour and half.  Within 15 minutes, the place had filled up and even the bar area was fully occupied.  It had taken longer than expected to even receive our drinks and have the waiter take our order.  The catfish poppers were so delicious and incredibly moist.  Despite that, we had waited almost 30-40 minutes to receive it!  Juniper was definitely short staffed that day. The waiter was running around constantly, taking orders, bringing out food, handling the cash register, etc.  I never once saw him stand still for even just a second.  Our dinner took a lot longer to come, probably about an hour after we had received our appetizer!  It was taking so long and we were getting frustrated because it was way past dinner time at this point.  After telling the waiter we were about to get the check if our food wasn't done, it was ready to go.  I had ordered the bacon mac and cheese.  It was a delicious giant bowl of cheesy goodness!  Honestly, the biggest mac and cheese dish I had ever ordered!  The bread crumbs and rice krispies topping added a nice crunch and bite to the soft macaroni.  The bacon, wasn't crispy like I had though but tasted wonderful with the mac and cheese and blended in really nicely.  I had tried a bit of my brother's pulled pork sandwich and despite not being a big barbecue fan, the pork was really tender and moist and the sauce tasted pretty good.Definitely want to come back when this place isn't super packed.  Hopefully by then, they'll be more of a wait staff.  The waiter worked hard that day but if we hadn't waited so long for our food, would have given this 5 stars because the food was really enjoyable and worth the money.",3.0
"My co-workers and I come here fairly often for lunch, and I cannot wait to visit Juniper for dinner.  It is truly one of our favorite spots, our dish of choice being the Steak and Cheese which is one of the best I've ever had.  I walk away thinking about this thing all the time, and was pretty obsessed with it for quite some time.Almost all the dishes you'll find here will fall under comfort foods.  And while I do wish there were a few more healthier options, you won't be disappointed with anything you get here.The portions are enormous and the fries (of all their different varieties) are quite addicting.  Burgers are perfectly cooked and tasty.  The fish dishes are soooo yummy and hugely sized.    If you're looking for a cheap lunch, the grilled cheese is a great deal and comes with Tom's super awesome french fries of your choice.  The salads are enormous and delicious.  The ribs are deboned and very tasty and the jambalya is generously flavored and portioned (though a bit too spicy for my tastes, I'm a wimp though).  I love the Steak and Cheese so much that I hardly eat anything else here.There isn't a single disappointing thing on this menu.The prices are reasonable, and while a bit high for lunch is definitely good for dinner.Tom, the owner and chef, is one of the sweetest restaurant owners you'll ever meet and he never fails to come and greet us and chat with us upon our visits.  He has done an excellent job making the restaurant feel quite homey in its personality.  You will find not a trace of pretentiousness.  It is simple in design, but you will certainly leave full and happy.  The friendly waitstaff has always been very attentive to us.There is also a very lovely and spacious garden in the back.BYOB also helps make drinks here a cheap night out!",5.0
"It's getting late on a Sunday evening. Evan and I are getting hungrier. As both of these things occur and continue, our patients for deciding on the perfect place to eat starts to wane. With thoughts of settling looming on the horizon of our dinner plans, suddenly, I recalled a spot on yelp that peaked my interest a while back. I proudly declared ""Ah Ha! We're trying Juniper!""We walked up about 9:30, and looked at each other nervously. ""it's empty...never a good sign"". Decided to give it a go based on all the positive yelp feedback anyways.We browsed the menu(s) for a quick option for an appetizer, but considering I am a pescatarian, I was at a loss. (I love mussels, but I decided to pass this evening). We asked for the Baked Mac and Cheese to start with. The adorable server proclaimed to would take 15 minutes. I protested, but boyfriend order it anyways. Good thing....because when it finally came....it was bubbling away with scorching cheesy goodness. See the photo. No, no, just go order it for yourself. I can't think of a special way to describe the dish, because, although it was like a symphony of delicious cheesy, oily, crusty-topped amazing in my mouth, it was indeed...just Mac and Cheese. I ordered the Portobello Sandwich and chose the spicy fries. Evan ordered the Truffle Burger with sweet potato fries. The Portobello Sandwich was good. Not great, not bad, but a solid ""good"". The brioche made the dish, but alas became soggy due to the juices from the mushroom rather quickly. Yuck. I also would have been happier if the sandwich had come with some type of sauce, perhaps an aioli of sorts? (instead of the very watery soy-based juice of my mushroom). Alas, it was tasty enough for me to eat most of it. The real star on the plate - SPICY FRIES. Not very spicy, but extra crispy and flavorful and who doesn't like a waffle fry?According to Evan, the Truffle Burger was heaven. He loved every last crumb. I heard words of praise  like ""rich"" and ""best burger"" between his full-mouth mumbling. He wasn't a fan of the fries. Their interpretation of Sweet Potato Fries was quite literal, you could taste hints of cinnamon (maybe nutmeg as well?). I tried them, they were tasty and kind of limp; I prefer my fries crispy and salty.The owner did come talk to us, and then chatted with us while we payed before leaving. He does all the cooking himself. Wow. Way to go, sir. He managed to describe some items for us to try next time (and although we just ate, left feeling excited for future food), and I must say, we will be back. *Hint- The patio is lovely on a cool evening, and rather spacious as well.",4.0

"Came randomly after walking around and decided to try it.  Sat in the back which was a nice little area, could use some chairs with cushions n maybe a little more decor but still very chill.  Since the bf doesn't really eat meat we started with the mussels and fried shrimp.  The shrimp were huge n nicely breaded the accompanying sauce was tangy n just right, but they should give an even amount so those sharing can divide it evenly.  The mussels were very delicious and they gave a big portion def worth the price!  The sauce used to cook them in was tasty n the bread was a nice way to soak up more sauce.  We ordered two entrees but since the portions were huge!! We decided to just eat the catfish n spicy fries n save the shrimp linguine for another day! The catfish aka fish n chips was soooooo delicious!!!  The breading was perfect n the meat was very tender.  The tartar sauce was great with it, I'm not sure if it's homemade but it was delicious! The spicy fries were a bit too salty but with ketchup was fine!  All together it was a great meal left stuffed n happy!! I will def be going back if I'm in the neighborhood!!",5.0

The portion is large and the sandwich was pretty decent. The only downside is the bun (the pork was great, I added some Frank's Hot Sauce and mustard). I highly, highly recommend the spicy fries. They were the best part of the meal. The coleslaw was very unordinary, but it's a small side. My friend has the Truffle Burger and he really enjoyed it.

"Found the menu online and sought this place out because of the burger because you can't really find a place that serves a decent sized piece of meat that isn't covered up with fancy bread and condiments.

Service is really good and the chef aims to please, so if it's not to your satisfaction he will take it personally and try to make it up to you. I went here three nights in a row to catch dinner while on a job in the neighborhood, now I'm thinking I need to have another burger.",4.0

The Asian lady who serves everyone is super nice and was really accommodating with our champagne and cupcakes we brought for a celebration! Will definitely return to Juniper soon!!!!",5.0
"Support local business! Consistently good food after several months of orders. Burgers, fries options, and the chicken tenders are addictive. Also love the old school cash tender machine. It's definitely on the small side, but it has that local charm.",5.0
"I eat here almost every week. I've only ever had the truffle burger and fish & chips, but they're both so good I can't help but order one or the other every time. The truffle burgers is one of the best burgers I've had in the city. Reasonably priced- cash only.",5.0
"Came randomly after walking around and decided to try it.  Sat in the back which was a nice little area, could use some chairs with cushions n maybe a little more decor but still very chill.  Since the bf doesn't really eat meat we started with the mussels and fried shrimp.  The shrimp were huge n nicely breaded the accompanying sauce was tangy n just right, but they should give an even amount so those sharing can divide it evenly.  The mussels were very delicious and they gave a big portion def worth the price!  The sauce used to cook them in was tasty n the bread was a nice way to soak up more sauce.  We ordered two entrees but since the portions were huge!! We decided to just eat the catfish n spicy fries n save the shrimp linguine for another day! The catfish aka fish n chips was soooooo delicious!!!  The breading was perfect n the meat was very tender.  The tartar sauce was great with it, I'm not sure if it's homemade but it was delicious! The spicy fries were a bit too salty but with ketchup was fine!  All together it was a great meal left stuffed n happy!! I will def be going back if I'm in the neighborhood!!",5.0
"Everything was great, especially the baked mac and cheese and BBQ. Pretty inexpensive, and BYOB is always fun.",5.0
"The atmosphere is really great - there is some cool modern and street art on the walls. The service was great. Our water was regularly re-filled, we were attended to regularly, and the staff was incredibly friendly. The chef even came out of the kitchen to see how the food was.I had the BBQ Pork sandwich. The portion is large and the sandwich was pretty decent. The only downside is the bun (the pork was great, I added some Frank's Hot Sauce and mustard). I highly, highly recommend the spicy fries. They were the best part of the meal. The coleslaw was very unordinary, but it's a small side. My friend has the Truffle Burger and he really enjoyed it. Again, portion size was large, and I think I'll try it when I go back. Can't wait to try it again!",4.0
"Found the menu online and sought this place out because of the burger because you can't really find a place that serves a decent sized piece of meat that isn't covered up with fancy bread and condiments. Turns out this is one of the rare restaurants where you can get an 8 oz burger with sweet fries and greens and skip the bun. Service is really good and the chef aims to please, so if it's not to your satisfaction he will take it personally and try to make it up to you. I went here three nights in a row to catch dinner while on a job in the neighborhood, now I'm thinking I need to have another burger.",4.0
"We stopped by for lunch on Thursday. I had the grilled burger with spicy fries and my husband had catfish burger with sweet potato fries. Both had large portions and were excellent. Service was great and Ralph, who served us was very nice. The chef/ owner, Tom, came out and talked with us for a while. The atmosphere is casual, friendly & laid back and the food is great. Juniper has a great vibe, we will absolutely go back & bring our friends.And the health inspection grade is an A.",5.0
Been going to this place since it opened. Amazing AMAZING food. Anyone who complains about the food here has no taste. Now since it's popularity it may be a longer wait to sit but it's truly worth the wait. Food is cooked to perfection and the staff is on point. Tom comes out of the kitchen and always asks how your meal is. If you haven't been definitely go.,5.0
"This place is great! The food (spicy fries, chorizo burger, rib sandwich) were amazing. In addition, the owner is so friendly and clearly has a passion for food and for his restaurant. My boyfriend is a chef, and this is the first place in a while i've heard him rave about. I can't wait to go back and try all the other things this place has to offer. I went back again and had the shrimp scampi. I was weary to try it at more of a sandwich place, but it was honestly the best shrimp scampi I've ever had (and I've had a lot!). It was so garlicy and flavorful!!",5.0
"The food here is amazing! In a totally chill atmosphere! The catfish sandwich is super crispy and light! So delicious!

"Nice place but I won't eat there again. They got a ""C"" on the health inspection but you won't find their grade in the window because they don't want u to know instead of making improvements they took finds because they were scared the ""C"" grade would turn people away",1.0

"But seriously, the food here is remarkable. The catfish sandwich with spicy fries is mind blowing.

There's never more than one or two tables of people when I'm there, but it still takes over 20 minutes for the food to come out.My friends and I actually started calling ahead with our orders and showing up there to eat in the backyard haha.

"I love Juniper. I'm usually not a dick, but to those who say this restaurant is terrible; you suck, you're mean, too snobby, had a crazy fluke meal, or are just plain wrong. The duo of Tom and Dee are the best! They're so nice, and always treat me kindly. Me and my friend usually go there early (around 5:00 p.m.) and sit in the fenced in backyard (where we can smoke cigs before our meal comes out, yes I know, it's aweful, I'm trying to quit). Juniper mostly serves comfort food, some cajun, and burgers. I usually get the jumbalaya, it's awesome. The clams on top are definitely like the icing on the jumbalaya cake. It packs a little spice, but is rich in flavor and fills the belly. I've only had a burger from there once, but it was cooked the way I wanted, was pretty big, and was flavorful. I also like their 'spicy cajun fries' and their sweet potato fries are good as well. Their mac n' cheese is good as well. I've never had a disappointing meal from Juniper.And another great added bonus is that Juniper is BYOB, so me and my friend usually get some 22's of Corona and chill there for a while before and after our meal. And usually Tom (chef and owner) pops out of the kitchen and just chats with us, if it's not too busy. Dee is a sweetheart (cute too), and takes great care of me and my friend whenever we're there. Me and my friend will continue going here, it's our 'go-to spot' in the neighborhood when we want something familiar and know we're going to be fed well.",5.0

I had the Chorizo Burger, which was absolutely delicious, with a side of sweet potato fries that came with an excellent chipotle dipping sauce. My girlfriend had the pulled pork sliders appetizer, which was really good, but served with those small dried up ""fries"" that you buy in a dollar store next to the potato chips - I think it's a little weird when restaurants give you that as a side. It's BYOB, with a corking fee of $1 per beer and $5 per wine bottle - pretty standard for BYOB places.

"Conveniently located only 1 block from the Bedford L train stop, Juniper boasts one of Williamsburg's best spots for comfort food and down-home dishes.Here's the rundown:- Burger: The foundation staple. Juicy, thick patty, always seasoned and cooked to perfection. Served on soft sweet roll with slice of red onion, pickle, tomato and lettuce on the side. The key is the seasoning. I'm a burger addict and have no reservation admitting the Truffle Burger rivals any neighborhood mainstay. Combine with spicy waffle fries and it's hammer time.- Pulled Pork Sandwich / Sliders: Tender meat, hint of smoke, lathered in homemade BBQ sauce with a generous kick of spice. It tastes exactly how you would dream of this southern classic. - Steak & Cheese: Perfect meat to cheese ratio, piled high, spilling over an unconventional soft round sweet roll. Delicious version for the Philly connoisseurs.- Catfish Sandwich: Fresh, thinly sliced and lightly breaded strips served on a tasty Italian style roll. This item will appear as a special and is nice change of pace. If I recall, this was served with a side of garlic baby bok choy. All ingredients fresh and purchased at local markets.- Jambalaya: Louisiana dish with Creole and Cajun influences. Laced with signature spice, chunks of chicken, sausage, fish, shrimp, tomatoes and rice. Plenty of heat and dense with flavor.Other items I've tried: Mussels w/white wine & shallots, chicken fried steak, cajun shrimp salad, macaroni & cheese.Atmosphere is relaxed and casual. Relatively small space with patio access. Flat screen TV above the bar. BYOB at the time of writing this review. Sunac grocery store is located on North 7th St. Plenty of drinks and sodas including Boylan's Black Cherry on the premises.What makes Juniper special and truly separates it from the surrounding establishments is the owner and chef, Tom. He is very friendly and will often come out of the kitchen to personally greet his patrons. Juniper is a standout in Williamsburg's burgeoning restaurant scene. It's the perfect neighborhood haunt. Down-home and delicious.",5.0
"Juniper is an excellent casual dining restaurant where the price is right, the service friendly, and the food on point.  I had the jambalaya which was perfectly spiced and filled with savory chorizo and fatty mussels.  I had some of the fries from my friends' plates (regular and sweet potato) and they were a perfect cut, lightly fried, but crispy and seasoned in a really unique way (spicy, salty, and maybe a little old bay(?)). The place is BYO which is a great bonus to add to the already reasonable prices.  They will put your beer in the fridge while you eat and serve it to you as you eat as if they were ordered drinks. My only complaint is that we waited quite a long time for the food to come out, but with BYO drinks in hand, who really cares anyway?",5.0

Solid. Sweet potato fries for the win!,4.0
"Conveniently located only 1 block from the Bedford L train stop, Juniper boasts one of Williamsburg's best spots for comfort food and down-home dishes.Here's the rundown:- Burger: The foundation staple. Juicy, thick patty, always seasoned and cooked to perfection. Served on soft sweet roll with slice of red onion, pickle, tomato and lettuce on the side. The key is the seasoning. I'm a burger addict and have no reservation admitting the Truffle Burger rivals any neighborhood mainstay. Combine with spicy waffle fries and it's hammer time.- Pulled Pork Sandwich / Sliders: Tender meat, hint of smoke, lathered in homemade BBQ sauce with a generous kick of spice. It tastes exactly how you would dream of this southern classic. - Steak & Cheese: Perfect meat to cheese ratio, piled high, spilling over an unconventional soft round sweet roll. Delicious version for the Philly connoisseurs.- Catfish Sandwich: Fresh, thinly sliced and lightly breaded strips served on a tasty Italian style roll. This item will appear as a special and is nice change of pace. If I recall, this was served with a side of garlic baby bok choy. All ingredients fresh and purchased at local markets.- Jambalaya: Louisiana dish with Creole and Cajun influences. Laced with signature spice, chunks of chicken, sausage, fish, shrimp, tomatoes and rice. Plenty of heat and dense with flavor.Other items I've tried: Mussels w/white wine & shallots, chicken fried steak, cajun shrimp salad, macaroni & cheese.Atmosphere is relaxed and casual. Relatively small space with patio access. Flat screen TV above the bar. BYOB at the time of writing this review. Sunac grocery store is located on North 7th St. Plenty of drinks and sodas including Boylan's Black Cherry on the premises.What makes Juniper special and truly separates it from the surrounding establishments is the owner and chef, Tom. He is very friendly and will often come out of the kitchen to personally greet his patrons. Juniper is a standout in Williamsburg's burgeoning restaurant scene. It's the perfect neighborhood haunt. Down-home and delicious.",5.0
"Juniper is an excellent casual dining restaurant where the price is right, the service friendly, and the food on point.  I had the jambalaya which was perfectly spiced and filled with savory chorizo and fatty mussels.  I had some of the fries from my friends' plates (regular and sweet potato) and they were a perfect cut, lightly fried, but crispy and seasoned in a really unique way (spicy, salty, and maybe a little old bay(?)). The place is BYO which is a great bonus to add to the already reasonable prices.  They will put your beer in the fridge while you eat and serve it to you as you eat as if they were ordered drinks. My only complaint is that we waited quite a long time for the food to come out, but with BYO drinks in hand, who really cares anyway?",5.0

"After reading mostly positive reviews, I was pumped to try this place!.. And my party and I were pretty let down. At our table we had the pumpkin bisque, Mac n cheese, mussels, and truffle burger with sweet potato fries. Ehhh. Everything was pretty bland. The Mac n cheese was good but the cheese to noodles ratio was a bit off- it was more like eating Kraft cheese soup with a few noodles in there. The sweet potato fries could have been good as a dessert item, they were totally covered in sugar and cinnamon- not something one normally craves to accompany the burger. The burger was alright but the beef did not seem to be of very high quality. The mussels were pretty basic, nothing incredible. The pumpkin bisque was actually pretty yummy. The menu just seems to be kinda random.But the absolute worst part of the meal was the loud group of 5 or 6 guys that were literally yelling back and forth (Hello! This is a super tiny place, is that really necessary!?) they kept screaming profanities and kicking chairs around. Nobody in my group even wanted to look in their direction for fear of really setting them off. I could see that they were driving everyone else to leave and I couldn't believe that the owner didn't ask them to chill. We left immediately after eating due to their obnoxious behavior and none of us plan on going back.",2.0

"I LOVE this place. I was craving a burger, and I didn't feel like straying too far from my apartment. I hopped on yelp and did some research. Thank you yelpers! Juniper is my true love, well besides my sweet boyfriend...but I digress. I love love love truffles, truffle oil, anything truffle related and juniper has a truffle burger. I added mozzerella cheese and it was ballerrrr! Cooked perfectly medium. Wonderous! Spicy fries are a must, so good. I've also had the Mac and cheese and the chicken fingers (breaded with rice krispies) get behind it! Both were delicious. The cheese was well balanced in the Mac ie not too soupy, thick, or paste like. The chef used tagliatelle pasta, always so good! Boyfriend has had the short rib sandwich and the pulled pork. I've tried them both. Awesome. A sweet, smoky, molasses-y BBQ sauce covers both, the perfect balance of salt and sweet. Did I mention the spicy fries? I did? Oh well, worth mentioning again. To all those nay-sayers out there, the reason the restaurant runs out of menu items is because everything is made fresh to order....that's a good thing. If you want mass quantity over quality go to McDonalds. You'll be welcome there. It's also byob. Hi. Hello.The chef is super cool. He always comes out to talk to you while you're eating.

"The food is amazing here. I recently moved to Brooklyn; I started researching some local burger places and Junipers caught my eye. The place is surprisingly small for all the hype it has received on Yelp, but the food doesn't disappoint.The menu only consists of a handful of items, but everything on the menu is delicious. Each dish is executed perfectly and presented in a very artistic manner. My personal favorites are the baked mac and cheese (for 7 dollars it makes a great lunch) and the grilled burger. The spicy fries are not spicy, but I find them to be seasoned perfectly. The sweet potatoes fries also add a nice change of pace. Also if you get two entrees you can get a free appetizer for mentioning Yelp.The atmosphere is very friendly.  I have experienced anywhere from a 15-40 minute wait since Tom is the only one in the kitchen. It really depends on how busy it is. In this part of the town, business usually picks up after 8.Tom usually comes out after your meal to ask you personally how you liked it. You can tell this is a restaurant that strives to satisfy their customers.",5.0
Having lived in New Orleans  I can tell you that the jambalaya is the real deal. The catfish sandwich is massive but is also delicious.

"I've been here a total of three times and every time, Tom the chef-owner always checks in, gives a recommendation and spends a few minutes talking to us. Tonight was special though-- even Deedee the server sat down with us and told me I was ridiculous for deciding between the Cobb and Mac&Cheese... the choice was clear. And it was! It was the richest, creamiest mac and cheese, even tastier that Sarita's in the East Village whose specialty IS mac and cheese. Felt like I was punched in the mouth with cheese. But truly, everything on the menu is great (I can personally attest to the pulled pork sandwich, burger and sweet potato fries). I mean, if you're a vegetarian, you might be limited by the selection and I feel sorry for you but if you're a good meat-loving human being, you're in luck! The best part is that there were only two tables in the restaurant and Tom sat with us and talked about his dishes, his childhood in New York etc etc. He gives the place such a friendly, neighborhood vibe and personally, I love how the horn-rimmed glasses and plaid wearing populace has steered clear of it so far (though I admit their arrival would herald the success of the place)... probably because the music selection is not as hip. It does win points for irony though... imagine Savage Garden side by side with Led Zeppelin. This is definitely my number one grub spot for the Bedford stop.",5.0
"Juniper.  What a fun experience in dining.  The staff was so inviting and warm, it almost was like I was dining amongst family.  I had the pulled pork sandwich which I will admit was just a bit TOO sauce-y for me but I am also incredibly picky when it comes to pulled pork.  The fries were incredible!  So delicious!  I honestly can't wait to come back and try something else. Also, my friend and I were literally held hostage by this place.  You might be reading that last sentence and are really confused but it was such a funny little Seinfeld-ish moment.  During the course of the meal, the rain came down.  When we asked for our check, our server LITERALLY said ""No, you can't it's raining.  You should stay and hang out.""  After 15 minutes, we realized she was not kidding.  Whatever, it was cute.  It's not like we had anywhere to go!",4.0

"Some of the tastiest burgers and we found out why, from the source himself, the chef and owner. He seasons the meat prior to grilling so its not bland. I like that a lot.The one buzzkill is the waiter. He could use an a little more curtesy. You know when you have a waiter that drags his tail with every request? Yeah, that one. We didn't get a thank you with when we paid either. A little more than irksome.",3.0

Great experience!I went back today with my wife and we had the mussels in white wine sauce, pulled pork sandwich, and truffle burger. All were excellent. I definitely see this restaurant becoming a place that i will frequent.",4.0
"Ok, I would have given this place 5 stars for their great food and the fact it's BYOB.  4 stars because I went there last night and a sign on the door said it was closed by the Health Department :(",4.0
"The food is amazing - you will not be disappointed. We've been here a few times and have been really happy with everything we've ordered. The service is great, the prices are good and the owner will come over and talk to you to make sure you're satisfied with your meal.This place is usually empty, or mostly so, probably because it doesn't look like the best place to eat from the outside (or, really, the inside). I feel like this is what could be keeping people away when the food is so good.",4.0
"The food is amazing here. I recently moved to Brooklyn; I started researching some local burger places and Junipers caught my eye. The place is surprisingly small for all the hype it has received on Yelp, but the food doesn't disappoint.The menu only consists of a handful of items, but everything on the menu is delicious. Each dish is executed perfectly and presented in a very artistic manner. My personal favorites are the baked mac and cheese (for 7 dollars it makes a great lunch) and the grilled burger. The spicy fries are not spicy, but I find them to be seasoned perfectly. The sweet potatoes fries also add a nice change of pace. Also if you get two entrees you can get a free appetizer for mentioning Yelp.The atmosphere is very friendly.  I have experienced anywhere from a 15-40 minute wait since Tom is the only one in the kitchen. It really depends on how busy it is. In this part of the town, business usually picks up after 8.Tom usually comes out after your meal to ask you personally how you liked it. You can tell this is a restaurant that strives to satisfy their customers.",5.0
Having lived in New Orleans  I can tell you that the jambalaya is the real deal. The catfish sandwich is massive but is also delicious. Get the mussels and the spicy fries but there is no need for the mac and cheese. The place is BYOB and the food is substantial and on the money. Great stuff! we will surely be back soon.,5.0
"Wow, this might be the best burger in the city.  Its really amazing.  Plus the place is very cool, and the owners are nice and the service is great.  Also its in a fun neighborhood, but tucked away on a not crowded street.  What could be better?Looks like bad reviews have come from non-bell curve rating distribution reviewers, and those people are the scum of the earth.  Do yourself a favor and pay Juniper a visit.",5.0
"I've been here a total of three times and every time, Tom the chef-owner always checks in, gives a recommendation and spends a few minutes talking to us. Tonight was special though-- even Deedee the server sat down with us and told me I was ridiculous for deciding between the Cobb and Mac&Cheese... the choice was clear. And it was! It was the richest, creamiest mac and cheese, even tastier that Sarita's in the East Village whose specialty IS mac and cheese. Felt like I was punched in the mouth with cheese. But truly, everything on the menu is great (I can personally attest to the pulled pork sandwich, burger and sweet potato fries). I mean, if you're a vegetarian, you might be limited by the selection and I feel sorry for you but if you're a good meat-loving human being, you're in luck! The best part is that there were only two tables in the restaurant and Tom sat with us and talked about his dishes, his childhood in New York etc etc. He gives the place such a friendly, neighborhood vibe and personally, I love how the horn-rimmed glasses and plaid wearing populace has steered clear of it so far (though I admit their arrival would herald the success of the place)... probably because the music selection is not as hip. It does win points for irony though... imagine Savage Garden side by side with Led Zeppelin. This is definitely my number one grub spot for the Bedford stop.",5.0
"Juniper.  What a fun experience in dining.  The staff was so inviting and warm, it almost was like I was dining amongst family.  I had the pulled pork sandwich which I will admit was just a bit TOO sauce-y for me but I am also incredibly picky when it comes to pulled pork.  The fries were incredible!  So delicious!  I honestly can't wait to come back and try something else. Also, my friend and I were literally held hostage by this place.  You might be reading that last sentence and are really confused but it was such a funny little Seinfeld-ish moment.  During the course of the meal, the rain came down.  When we asked for our check, our server LITERALLY said ""No, you can't it's raining.  You should stay and hang out.""  After 15 minutes, we realized she was not kidding.  Whatever, it was cute.  It's not like we had anywhere to go!",4.0
Delicious burgers and amazing service! The truffle burger was juicy and delicious and the fries were crunchy! It's ByO so it turns out to be super cheap. Only downside is they don't have dessert,4.0
"Some of the tastiest burgers and we found out why, from the source himself, the chef and owner. He seasons the meat prior to grilling so its not bland. I like that a lot.The one buzzkill is the waiter. He could use an a little more curtesy. You know when you have a waiter that drags his tail with every request? Yeah, that one. We didn't get a thank you with when we paid either. A little more than irksome.",3.0

"Excellent! Food was so yummy and tasted fresh. Everything we had tasted as if it were a home cooked meal from mom's kitchen.

I usually don't like it when people keep checking up on you and asking if you need this and that every 5 minutes but it wasn't like that at Juniper.

"I've been here 4 times... -the place looks quiet, and a bit low key, but it's truly a gem. First off- the menu is great: pulled pork sliders, mussels, jambalaya, chicken wings, rib sandwiches, chorizo burgers... quite a robust, yet simple collection of snacks. Not too pricey either!The owner wrote the menu, and does all the cooking himself!The staff may seem reserved, but when you get to know them, are true, down-to-earth folks, all with a great sense of humor! This place has a great backyard for when the summer hits- and is in a prime location.I recommend stopping in for dinner on the way home from work, or lunch if you're in the area. This is also a perfect spot for a solo meal- It's not too hectic, and not too quiet. You're guaranteed a hearty meal at Juniper.",5.0

"Three-and-a-half stars.Trekking along the treacherous Bedford strip, you find yourself in the market for a no-frills burger, baked mac 'n cheese or simply a delicious pulled pork sandwich. Having grown tired of the crowded establishments that litter this neighborhood, you just want to kick back with a few friends and grab some comfort food. That's when you take a turn towards Berry Street and happen upon Juniper. With no crowds to brave, Juniper is arguably as good as, if not better than, establishments like The Meatball Shop and DuMont Burger.  Of course, the execution is not perfect at Juniper and if you seek a restaurant with an alcohol license (Juniper is BYOB), refined service and the perfect ambiance, best you look elsewhere. That is not what you are seeking now though, is it? Perhaps you're just commencing your weekend festivities and require hearty sustenance for your forthcoming journey; perhaps a day of vintage clothes shopping has caused you to crave a catfish sandwich. Whatever the cause of said cravings, rest assured, your appetite should be satiated at Juniper.Having tried the pulled pork sandwich, I am a satisfied customer: served on a brioche bun this tender, juicy and flavorful concoction is served with your choice of sweet potato, regular or spicy fries. As far as pulled pork sandwiches go, this is as good a specimen as one could reasonably hope to find. That is not to say that it is the best in show, but there is very little about which to complain.Conclusion: This is not a destination restaurant by any means but, as a neighborhood spot, you can expect consistently delicious cuisine devoid of airs and graces. The only surprising element is that Juniper is not nearly as busy as it should be, relative to the over-hyped establishments around the corner.",4.0

The good:  had a very tasty burger.The bad:  Nice folks but horrendous service.  I asked for napkins 3 times and eventually had to get them myself.  I never received any kind of utensils at all.  It also took over an hour to get my burger.  This place isn't that big so it couldn't have been because they were that backed up - it was just poor service.No liquor license means it's BYOB which is just a pain in the ass.If you sit in the back you occasionally get a powerful whiff of bird shit from the pigeon coop next door.  This isn't their fault at all but is still a knock against the restaurant.The burger was good but not enough to compensate for the other factors.  Giving three stars due to the nice people and good food but still will not return.,3.0
3.5 * Good but not great. The truffle burger was good but I ordered medium and got it well done. The wait for food was very long considering we were the only customers there over 20 min for apps and about 45 min for a burger and noodles dish. The waitress was attentive and friendly and the food tasted good but Juniper didn't live up to the hype in my opinion. The pulled pork came out so hot that I wonder if it was microwaved before it came out but it did taste good after it cooled down. The chicken tenders were good.

"Real people, real food.  We stumbled upon this place while in the area.  At first I was a bit hesitant, because it was lunch hour and there wasn't a soul in the place minus the staff.  We took our chances even after learning that they're cash only and the nearest atm is about a block away.  I'm really glad we stayed because the food is AMAZING.  The owner and chef, Tom, went to the back to prepare our food right after we ordered and returned with platefuls of American style goodness.  We had the spicy buffalo wings, pulled pork sandwich and truffle burger.  The servings were Texas sized in a good way, because I would gladly have eaten them as leftovers the next day.  The wings were gigantic and so juicy.  My truffle burger was the best of the bunch as it was juicy, flavorful, and way better than some upscale burger places I've been to.  I can't say much for the pulled pork sandwich, because I'm not a fan of BBQ sauce, which it was dripping from the bf's fingers, but he seemed like he was enjoying it.  We were conflicted between chatting with Tom and shoving our faces with his cooking since both activities were enjoyable.  He's a genuine guy with a passion for his art.  This place is a no brainer if you're in the area.  Hell, come even if you're not in the area.

The food is pretty average (burgers, sandwiches, salads), but you get a lot for your money and hey, you brought your own beer, so your bill is already going to be really reasonable.

The backyard is quite pretty, and it's nice and quiet, with rarely more than a few people, so you can bring all of your friends and know you'll be able to get a table.

"I stumbled upon this place one day in the rain with a friend in search of jambalaya, and sure enough they had it advertised in the window.  We went in, ordered the jambalaya and catfish sandwich with spicy fries, and everything was delicious!  It is probably the best catfish sandwich I've ever had, cooked perfectly, and I've gone back already because I crave it!  It's a small place, but they have a great outdoor patio in the back, and best of all it's BYOB! Prices are moderate, the chef is really nice and comes out to greet the guests and makes sure everyone is enjoying their meal, and it's just a low key, great restaurant.  Definitely recommend and will go back again!",4.0
"Crazy delicious burger, so juicy and perfectly medium. The buns are insanely good and the fries (do spicy) were perfect - my favorite style. The service was attentive and personal. I loved this place. Will be back.",5.0
"Real people, real food.  We stumbled upon this place while in the area.  At first I was a bit hesitant, because it was lunch hour and there wasn't a soul in the place minus the staff.  We took our chances even after learning that they're cash only and the nearest atm is about a block away.  I'm really glad we stayed because the food is AMAZING.  The owner and chef, Tom, went to the back to prepare our food right after we ordered and returned with platefuls of American style goodness.  We had the spicy buffalo wings, pulled pork sandwich and truffle burger.  The servings were Texas sized in a good way, because I would gladly have eaten them as leftovers the next day.  The wings were gigantic and so juicy.  My truffle burger was the best of the bunch as it was juicy, flavorful, and way better than some upscale burger places I've been to.  I can't say much for the pulled pork sandwich, because I'm not a fan of BBQ sauce, which it was dripping from the bf's fingers, but he seemed like he was enjoying it.  We were conflicted between chatting with Tom and shoving our faces with his cooking since both activities were enjoyable.  He's a genuine guy with a passion for his art.  This place is a no brainer if you're in the area.  Hell, come even if you're not in the area. It'll be worth it.",5.0

"Juniper is pretty great. It's a quiet and low-key restaurant. On the night I went there, my friend and I were the only two people in the place. I had the burger and fries. The burger was great, but the fries tasted like the frozen Alexia ones. Juniper has a neat backyard patio with lots of tables and chairs. Like many other Williamsburg establishments--cash only.",4.0
"BYOB! Need I say more? The food is pretty average (burgers, sandwiches, salads), but you get a lot for your money and hey, you brought your own beer, so your bill is already going to be really reasonable. I had the Cajun shrimp salad and honestly, it was better than most shrimp salads I've had - the shrimp were really big and didn't taste fishy or old, so for $12, I'll take it. The backyard is quite pretty, and it's nice and quiet, with rarely more than a few people, so you can bring all of your friends and know you'll be able to get a table. The service is outstanding - the woman who runs it is super nice and not afraid to joke around with you, which makes for a fun meal overall. I'll be back soon,  no doubt about it.",4.0
"My boyfriend and I came here yesterday and we enjoyed it very much. The food was really good. I had a cheese burger with mozzarella. No bun with sweet potato fries plus a mixed green salad. My boyfriend ate a cheddar bacon burger with sweet potato fries and we shared bbq wings. Everything was delicious. Really nice spot. The register was pretty interesting. Very antique and vintage. I believe he was the owner, very nice guy, said it was made in the 1920s. Loved this place",5.0
"We stumbled into this place after wandering around for an hour trying to decide on a place to eat. The service is friendly and welcoming, and though we couldn't sit in the backyard (private event), the dining space is cozy and laid back. The place is BYOB (which I wish we'd known ahead of time)...and has some of the best fried fish around (sandwich and fish & Chips. Who knew?!?

Had a truffle burger was told it was the best thing on the menu. It wasn't that good be honest taste wise 5 Guy's is better yeah that's right.

"A couple months ago, my roomie and I came here for dinner. We saw there were so many great reviews, so we had to give it a chance. We were seated in the back garden area. I don't know if it was such a good idea because the smell of sewage or toilets flushing kept lingering every couple of minutes. We wanted to move, but thought the smell would go away. It didn't. I ordered a Truffle cheeseburger, my roomie ordered Fried Chicken Tenders battered in Rice Crispies. It tasted really different, light and airy texture. I liked it. My Truffle Cheeseburger, not so good. I felt like the meat tasted really cheap and my medium rare was really chewy with some gritty gristles. Ew. Service was slow too, and the lady didn't really understand when I tried to explain the cheeseburger. Only good thing was the original batter of the Fried Chicken. Also the sweet potato fries were delicious. Who could mess that up?CASH ONLY",2.0

"Good stuff!!! Just moved here from Texas so looking for a local burger joint.  My bf and I shared a regular grilled burger with cheese and bacon and sweet potato fries and made to order mac n cheese.  Everything was delicious.  Best sweet potato fries I've ever had, they sprinkle cinnamon on the fries.  They totally pop!!  And the mac n cheese, made to order from scratch - a little powdery but good and cheesy.  Definitely coming back!",4.0

"DELICIOUS! I was looking for wings in the Williamsburg area, and this place came up on Yelp. We ordered food to go (they don't deliver, unlike what it may say on Yelp), and we were sooo pleasantly surprised! I was really just looking for some greasy wings to satisfy my craving, but I got so much more! We ordered two orders of their hot wings, mac and cheese and the sweet potato fries. All of it was amazing! The wings were so juicy, and the mac and cheese was just perfect. It had a bite to it and a breadcrumb crumble on top. The sweet potato fries were out of this world I usually prefer regular fries, but, I have to say, these have converted me! Also, We showed up to pick up our order about 10 minutes early in hopes it would be ready. They threw in a slice of chocolate mousse cake because we had to wait! (extra points for that!)I cannot wait to go back and sit down to eat.",4.0

We just put down our beers and without asking, she just came over, took it, and poured us a glass. That was unexpected. Breakdown of the food:-BBq wings: it was very crispy, saucy and flavorful. Will try the hot wings next time.-Fish and chips: this is not just a few pieces of fried fish..this is a WHOLE slab of one side of the fish. I mean this was HUGE. It was perfectly fried and the spicy fries were the perfect compliment. I just wished the vinegar was more vinegary.-mussels: very fresh and loved the garlic-ness of the bread but not the bread. The broth was good but a bit salty. Regardless, the mussels were well worth it and a good entree for one person even though it's an appetizer.I will definitely come back here to try the other great looking dishes.

I couldn't even get them today as apparently everyone was ""ordering them like they were going out of style."" -actual quote*The steak and cheese sandwich - almost as good as those ridiculous fries. The burger and BBQ rib sandwich are no slouches either. It's debatable which is better, but the S&C sammy was the standout for me and worth the workout burning it off.*The chicken fried steak - it's a daily special and not always available so snag it if you see it and enjoy some southern comfort food (I have a feeling the jambalaya is the same way). It's typically a large portion so come hungry for this one.Aside from that, I hear from coworkers that the mushroom udon (another special) is good and I'm curious to try more of their seafood dishes.

I just finished my Leftovers from earlier today and they were so good! The place is small and sweet. Aesthetically appealing but no way overwhelming. and the owner is very cool. I tried my friends meal and it was just as delicious. Everything was fresh and prepared with care. I Hope this place grows in popularity and the food remains just as great if not better!,5.0
On point! Ordered the pulled pork and its one of the best pulled pork I had anywhere. I'm gotta admit I'm really surprised considering the area. I will order it again to see if they are consistent.,4.0

"I've walked by it, checked out its menu, peered into it, but never actually stepped into it until my friend took me there recently.  Thank gawd!  I LOVE sweet potato fries, and theirs is AWESOME.  So flavorful and crispy!  Like everyone else said, their catfish sandwich was really, really good.  Like everyone else also said, the chef-owner came out and chatted and seems to be a great guy who loves what he does -- which definitely shows in the quality of the food.  So I guess whatever I have to say has already been said...except that if this venture does not succeed, I will be very, very disappointed in all of you.  Go and hand over some of your hard-earned money NOW.",5.0
"This place wasn't so great. The regular grilled burger is just the meat, and a bun. When we asked if the burger came with lettuce or tomato she said no. They gave us one slice of tomato and one slice of lettuce in replacement of the side salad. A whole salad for just one slice of each? Not really right portion and price wise. I ordered the regular fries with my burger & my boyfriend ordered the spicy fries. They put the spicy fries on my plate and the regular fries on his. Thank god the ""spicy"" fries were not actually spicy...at all...in any way. They should be named ""seasoned or unseasoned."" But realistically there were only 2-3 tables of people, the order shouldn't have been confused. We asked for another ketchup bottle because ours was empty, when she brought it back she had an attitude about us already having a ketchup bottle on our table. The bottle wasn't even red, it looked more like BBQ sauce. After the meal I tried to pay the bill with my card, oh no....only cash is accepted. Thank god I had a $100 bill hidden in my purse otherwise we wouldn't have been able to pay the bill. This is 2014, update the technology and accept cards. The food itself was alright, the fries were good. My boyfriend liked the burger but I wasn't a fan, the meat was just too thick for me.",2.0
Everything is amazing here!! Ande the owner is a sweetheart n personal with his customers=],5.0
"Went there a couple of days ago and had the burger which was pretty delicious.  The fries were great as well.  The place is still pretty new so the owner who is also the cook came out and introduced himself to us.  He was super friendly and even gave us a free sample of the pulled pork sandwiches which were absolutely delicious! Overall, great food and even better customer services.  Good place to bring a date...",5.0

"I was walking down Bedford on sunny Sunday afternoon looking for somewhere to sit down, eat, and work  on my laptop and there was just nothing, absolutely nothing. I dipped down to Berry and was happy to stumble upon this place. It felt like a good old Cheers kinda place. It was nice to be somewhere normal with people who were not trying to be styley and aloof but just treat you like a human being. Good reasonably priced  food. I talked to the owner and (I think she is) his wife, Super nice people. I only wish they had wireless so I could hang out and work there more, but I understand why they might not want to do that.",4.0

"Picked up some bar/kids food to go this weekend to enjoy with beers before the waterfront concert.  Wings, Mac n Cheese and Chicken Fingers.  The chicken fingers are made with rice krispies to give them a little extra pleasing crunch when you bite into them.  I love when someone cares enough about otherwise simple bar food to pay attention to these types of details.  Nothing dissapoints here.",5.0
"I am moving from New York very soon, and Juniper will be one of the things I miss most about living in Williamsburg.  The food is amazing, the owners are super nice and interesting people, and the vibe at the restaurant is a relief from a lot of the surrounding places in this neighborhood.  I love coming here.  I'm a vegetarian, so I can't give a lot of recommendations, but I do heartily recommend the udon soup.",5.0
"Was there last night with 6 friends for my birthday.  Could not have asked for anything better from this place.  The place is not too small and not too large.  Service felt personalized even though there were 5 other groups there.  The BYO feature was a definite plus.  I'll be honest and say I don't really remember leaving but I do remember the food.  EVERYTHING I ate was incredible.  We had Mac N Cheese for the table (2 orders), a number of BBQ Rib sandwiches, a chorizo burger, a regular burger, and an order of muscles.  Some had sweet potato fries and others had the spicy fries.  And these weren't just spicy for the sake of having a spicy fries option.  They were damn good spicy fries.  And no they weren't burn-a-hole-in-your-sphincter spicy.  They were actually flavorful, spicy fries.  I am definitely headed back for more.  btw: they even have a TV there in the event you absolutely need to watch the game.  We had them put the Knicks on and all was right with the world that evening, in addition to it being my birthday.  To sum up using an entirely tangential point, this place was so enjoyable that we had our host (and owner btw) poor shots for not just our table but the other tables as well... some of whom actually drank them and others who preferred to remember some of their Saturday night.Oh and we had not one but two chef interactions.  Super nice and friendly guy.  Do yourselves a favor a go to this place.  We don't want them going anywhere.Final final final words.  I've been to Fette Sau and this place is better, period.  The vibe here is better and the service is better.  Hell, there is no service at Fette Sau and good luck finding a seat at that place.  Fette Sau is good but you aren't doing anything there other than eating.  Juniper is a place to actually enjoy yourself while having great food.  Though let me also say that this isn't just a BBQ place. So if you are looking for straight up brisket by the pound, go elsewhere.  But if you crave what Juniper's menu offers, definitely come.",5.0

"I wish i could give this place a 10 star rating! I signed up to yelp just to write this review. I've been a yelp follower for years and most of the times I try new places its because of great reviews i just never signed up (probably out of laziness). But I love this place so much I want everyone to know about it :) I've been here a few times since I moved to Brooklyn about a year and a half ago, and no other place tops their burgers (not even shake shack no offense) and the prices are not bad. You get what you pay for. I've taken everyone I love to Juniper and nobody has been disappointed. A big plus also is that the Bedford station is down the street and three stops from Union Sq. I actually didn't realize until the last week that I went when I brought my best friend from Yonkers, but I never tried any other plate but the burgers and that's only because she asked what else do you recommend(they are that good) ? You know when you try a new great place you want to try every dish on their menu, yea be warned once you try the burgers you'll be hooked. Anyways I can go on and on, you have to try it yourself to believe me! Only thing though if I were you I would arrive early it gets pretty packed, I wish they would expand. And bring your own beers!

"I wanted to try this place for a long time mainly because the Yelp reviews have been so positive. I called up for a delivery and they told me that 8 blocks was too far because there's a new delivery guy. That's odd, but fine. I'll pick it up myself. Got the pulled pork and the rib sandwich. They both come with french fries. No other option. I think it was $25. Maybe more. Anyway. The fries were cold and soggy, but still kind of good probably because they had so much salt on them. Too many fries though, really. Had to throw away the second side order. A salad option would have been nice. But real problem reason I won't be eating at Juniper again -- the sandwiches. The bread was good, pickle nice. OK, here's the deal-breaker. These are the sauciest sandwiches ever. Do you like sause? Heaping amounts of high-calorie, sticky sweet McDonalds BBQ sause-style sauce?
