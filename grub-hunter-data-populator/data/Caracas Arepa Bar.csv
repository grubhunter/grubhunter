"I wanted to have a small dinner party and reached out to Caracas to plan it. They were incredibly accommodating, making sure all the details were covered ahead of time. We sat on their back patio, which is fantastic. A great vibe with beautiful, cozy decor. Their staff was amazing. Super sweet, and even though there were 11 of us, they handled the orders easily and made sure everyone was happy. They checked in with me throughout the meal to make sure we had everything we needed.Last but certainly not least, the food was amazing! We shared some appetizers (I highly recommend the Bajadas (friend sweet plantains with a garlicky green sauce and yummy cheese on top!). Everyone was able to find an arepa they liked, even our vegetarian guests. I would absolutely choose Caracas again for another similar event or even a date night or solo dinner. Give them a visit if you're in Williamsburg, the East Village, or the Rockaways :)",5.0
"SUPER PACKED on a Friday night but that's to be expected. Cool, laidback ambiance and feel to it. come during the spring and summer nights to snag a table in their courtyard, very cute.I must say when people hear Arepas they automatically assume Colombian, and let me make this clear this type of arepa are VENEZULANO ! okay lets talk food. I had the Surena , an arepa with chicken and chorizo it was good but something was missing and it was the cheese! boo maybe next time. The waiter brings a bottle of their special sauce which was super picante for my mouth ! but it was welcomed. Also, their cocktails are strong and offer a good selection  beers.",4.0
"Always delicious food. I highly recommend you to give this place a try. Everything on the menu is really good. This place is just amazing. The bartenders are super nice, honestly all the staff who works there. Also, the foo is flavorful, always fresh ingredients. I have been here several times and every time is the same good food. Business like these are the one that last forever. Congrats guys! You rock",4.0
"The new way of yelp life, I get excited about being in a strange part of town where I don't know where to eat, so I proceed to go on Yelp and do my usual search of most reviewed in the area, today I found myself in North Williamsburg and boy did I find a hidden gem!  Caracas Arepa Bar is a very cute intimate spot. I walked in on a Saturday afternoon for a quick bite so I didn't have a chance to really take it all in but I did my best.  After looking at the pictures from yelp on what's good the Arepa sandwich looked good so I went with that and boy did I make a good choice!  The corn based Arepa serves as the bread of a sandwich that has shredded beef, black beans, cojita cheese, and platano maduro! All the ingredients really complimented each other wrapped in fresh crispy arepa brought out a different taste that I'm not used to but enjoyed it very much.  I also added some of their house sauce that was a cross between honey mustard and salsa verde nice mix of zesty and spicy! I'm definitely coming back to this place soon with my lady to try the rest of the menu. I sat by the bar and was getting teased and tempted to have one of the many specialty drinks they kept serving but I was working and driving so had to be responsible smh.  I cant attest to how they tasted but they sure looked good! I'll be back soon Caracas Arepa bar...........",4.0
"I've only had arepas from one other place and I think they're super delicious. My bf used to frequent this place when he lived in NYC, so we came here for lunch with some friends. We ordered the passionfruit juice and an order of croquetas to start. The juice is pretty tart and I didn't like it too much at first, but got used to it after awhile. The croquetas were super tasty. They were served with a green sauce, which was delicious on them, but I loved putting their house sauce on them as well. Actually, their house sauce would taste good on anything. We tried the la sureña arepa, which was filled with chicken, chorizo and avocado. It was a hearty and filling meal. The drinks and starters came out pretty quickly, but the restaurant started to fill up and I noticed our group of six was left waiting for quite a bit of time to get our arepas. Overall, a great place to go for lunch or dinner.",4.0
"It's been a couple of years since I've been here and it's just as I remember it. The arepas are delicious and filling. We got the la sureña and some croquetas which were both delicious. The house sauce is amazing and can never get enough. Waiters are great and friendly, but service is a tad slow. We were a big group but it seams like they were running a tad bit behind. We also got a passion fruit jugo but it was bitter for our taste. Food still amazing so go to Williamsburg for this spot!",4.0
"I love this place. Service is quick, professional, and friendly. And the arepas never fail to satisfy. They're incredible. It really doesn't matter which ones you get, they won't disappoint. Before our movie, we sat at the bar and ordered and ordered until it was time to catch the movie. The plates are small enough to treat like tapas, and you can continue to order whatever tickles your fancy without feeling weighed down. But don't let the size of the arepas fool you. They are packed with inspired pairings and stuffed with flavor.I ordered La Mulata, stuffed with black beans, cheese, and a sweet plantain. My boyfriend got the Playa Deluxe, made with tilapia and mushrooms. When were done with that, we got tostones, topped with green salsa and sprinkled with cheese. So good I hear they have a chain in Heaven. Come one. Come all.",5.0
Absolutely delicious!!! We have been here on numerous occasions and have always enjoyed the food. Many delicious arepas to choose from and really good drink selection! I would recommend this place to anyone looking for delicious Venezuelan arepas/food. We gave this four stars because the service was slow.,4.0
"We decided to try Caracas Arepas for brunch today, I'm so glad we went. After battling this crazy cold both Mariel and I were ready to see the world again. We started our brunch with two Passion fruit drinks and Tajadas which are fried sweet plantains with cheese. The combination of sour and sweet make a perfect combo. The Tajadas always make my day. Mariel ordered the Playa Deluxe which is a stuffed Arepa with mushrooms, avocado, onions and tilipia fish. The taste was amazing the sauteed onions and mushroom along with the fish make the dish. I had the traditional De Pabellon which is shredded beef with cheese, plantians and black beans, talk about harmony. This place definitely will see us again.",5.0

"Embarrassingly enough, this was my first time having arepas. I've done the empanada thing before, obviously, but this was a new experience. Did not hate it.Got the tilapia avocado, flavors I'm super familiar with. I was really into the arepa shell/crust. Would eat again.",3.0
"Came here for lunch, place is kind of dark; a bit too dark. Waitress was nice and friendly, and gave good recommendations on the menu items. Although, I still have to check back on Yelp reviews and pictures before proceeding with the order. Got the lunch special with a choice of arepa and  a house salad. I wasn't too keen on the pernil (shredded pork) arepa as the meat was too dry and the sauce was bland. The gauc with plantains and taro chips made up for the bland arepa.",3.0
"I've visited the East Village spot a couple years ago and remember it being a hole in the wall with mostly standing space to eat by the windows and with at most 4-5 small tables.I stopped by the Williamsburg location last night for the first time and I'm glad to say it's an actual restaurant with ample bar space in the front. It was very lively and crowded, but we managed to grab a couple seats at the bar. The bartenders were friendly and service was great. They also seemed to be having a great time with all the people at the bar.We ordered a couple drinks, a Hot Queen, and a Parillo. The parillo had steak in it but it was really tough to chew since the steak wasn't finely sliced. Basically I took a bite and the entire slice of beef came out leaving me nothing left other than the arepa itself. Paying $10 for a pork bun sized arepa is robbery. I will go find myself 2 tacos plus sides somewhere else for the same price. Would come back for just drinks and nibble on chips+guac though.",3.0
Made a great choice in picking this Venezuelan restaurant. The restaurant deco is very Williamsburg - Latino Bohemian style.   The Arepa's are very filling and thank goodness they are not cheap with the portion size. Five star experience all around.,5.0
"Still love the food, but am deducting another star for crap service. A few months back we were one of only a few tables and after 15 minutes finally asked at front if we could place an order.  Again yesterday, we were sat immediately and after 20 minutes we still didn't have service.  I flagged the hostess who sat us and she took our order.  It is really weird.  A server tended the tables to either side of us, but didn't take our order.  We sat there for 20 minutes with menus piled on table waiting and waiting.  Probably will not come back as this was second time this has happened.",3.0

"We went here for lunch on a weekday afternoon. There's a small area in front with a bar and then a back seating area with an outdoor space. It was deserted. I ordered the Del Gato arepa (vegetarian arepa with avocado, cheese, and plantains) along with a side order of tequenos (fried mozzarella cheese) and tostones mochimeros (plantains with cheese). Dessert was the coconut tres leches (tiny tiny portion for 8 bucks!) and a latte. Everything was ok, I don't have any complaints. Nothing was AMAZING except the latte, which was pretty great. Prices are high and portions are tiny, which I guess is expected in this area. My friend had a few drinks, a mojito and the sangria among them. I tried them and seriously I'm pretty sure there was no liquor in any of them. They were also tiny and very pricy, so not recommended. Service was good, our waiter was attentive and very nice. But once again, tiny portions, bad mixed drinks, average food, and high prices are generally not a great combination.",3.0

I got the Hot Queen, it was filled with marinated chicken, avocado, peppers & onions. Loved it!

I got the arepa with shredded beef and cheese, and I would highly recommend it, although I'll warn that it's messy.For drinks, I'll warn that the caipirinha could've been better....it wasn't as sweet as I like and was overpoweringly strong.

This is not that place.Caracas Arepa Bar is, quite simply, one of the best places to eat in New York City. It's some of the best Venezuelan food you will ever eat. It's one of the most delicious ethnic eateries in the USA. It's some of the best Latin food you can imagine. Are you still not sold? Then let me elaborate.""Canucks Arepa Bar"" is in Saskatchewan. It's nowhere near as good as this.The best Arepa you can get here is ""La Surena"". It's a combination of succulent chicken, delicious white cheese, unbelievable avocado, some melt-in-your-mouth hot-sweet plantains, a host of heavenly spices and flavour, all stuffed inside a steaming, soft, dreamy, pillowy, quilted corn pocket known as - of course - an Arepa. But it gets better. Because they add this spicy Chorizo sausage that is off-the-charts delicious. The sausage takes the flavour from one level, off the charts, through the roof, and into the stratosphere. This is one of the best Arepas you will ever eat. Slightly overpriced possibly, but order it - devour it - love it - and see for yourself.""Calorie-counters Arepa Bar"" is a health food place. Don't expect any of that here.Make sure you get all the sauces so that you can try them and see which sauces you like on your arepa. Some are spicy, some are creamy, some are sweet. It's all a matter of taste. The other arepas they sell are all pretty damn good, but nothing compares to La Surena.""Carpets Arepa Bar"" sells flying rugs to Persian Princes. Whereas this place sells pillowy fluffy cloudy heavenly Arepas to Persian Princes (flips hair).As for the drinks, Caracas has some of the best drink selections in the city, in terms of non-alcoholic stuff. Their banana milkshake is smooth and delicious and addictive - but drink it straight away because it spoils easily because it's made from fresh stuffs. And their ""Papelon Con Limon"" is basically brown sugar lemonade, and is delicious. It's not too sweet, so be careful if you don't like sour stuff. The one at Arepas Cafe in Queens is probably slightly better, but on every other level - Caracas wins.""Cappucino Arepa Bar"" is an Italian coffee shop. It has nothing on this place.There are two locations. The original is in the East Village on 7th St. This spot is the second location, and the first to open in Brooklyn.""Camp Arepa Bar"" is in Greenwich Village and is really just a gay dating place.

Yet it's some of the best food you'll ever try, so come and get one - asap. The Manhattan location is just as good.",5.0
"My friend has been talking up this place forever, and I had no idea what was in stored for me.The entrance is very low key, and I would never have expected how large this place was. The tables were large allowing our entire party to sit together with the wait time being minimal.The arepas are fairly large for the price. About the size of your palm for 3 bucks. I went with La Pelua shredded beef  and the La De Pernil Pork shoulder, and then ordered them again after they disappeared into my mouth hole. With the prices being so reasonable my table had a number of repeat orders. We added Tostones Mochimeros and yoyos and then realized what we thought were arepas at other locations were just lies. Similar to when you have a food truck soft taco for the first time and the yellow crunchy shell versions in a U shape you had as a kid was a different type of ""taco"".Great place, great food, great prices, this place is a win all around.",5.0
"Love love love their vegan La Del Gato! Plantains were cooked to perfection and everything just balances with each other. Perfect combination of plantains, avocados, and guayana cheese! And ofcourse you MUST use their house sauce! I would drive an hour just to satisfy my la del Gato cravings",5.0
"One Of the best places Of Brooklyn, the music is amazing, excellent mix between chillout and Latinamerica, ""Las Arepas, buenisimas"" we love them, the yoyos is a creation of God, reminds you the taste of home, the Tequeños are the Venezuelan way to make ""Mozzarella Sticks"", the hostesses was a little slow but it worth it, excellent choice!",5.0

"Cheap but delicious stuffed arepas with a shot and a beer! Pretty much heaven. Service was really fast, but I was also at the bar because the seating area was completely full.

"Let me start by saying their coconut shake is delicious. It's creamy, icy, refreshing, and the dash of cinnamon on top is my jam. When I went, my friend and I split 4 arepas. They were cheap and pretty tasty, but slightly dry. I have a place I go to in SF that does reaallyyyy good arepas, and this place doesn't quite measure up to their quality.",4.0
"I always forget how much I love Venezuelan cuisine until a piping hot arepa is placed in front of me. And then I think ""Why have I waited so long for this!? What am I doing with my life?!""Caracas Arepa bar is in hip and trendy Williamsburg (where I seldom venture), but I was in the area for an event and needed a bite beforehand. And Caracas delivered. We were there during happy hour (my favorite hour), so we got some delicious drinks and the Tostones Mochimeros. DAYUM those things are delicious. Crunchy and fried, salty and tangy. MMM. I also got a La Mulata arepa and it was great as well. Very filling and satisfying - exactly what I want in an arepa. Can't wait to go back!",4.0
"""Crackers Arepa Bar"" only has one demographic. Everyone that comes here is crazy. And they serve a lot of Chili and a lot of Saltine Crackers. Sounds like a pretty crappy place. Luckily Caracas Arepa is nothing like that... and is in fact one of the best places to eat in NYC.What to order: La Surena Arepa, Banana Shake, Papelon Con Limon.What else: Almost everything is delicious.And so: One of the best meals you'll ever eat.And then what: Then we can go to your place and make out on your boyfriend's bed.""Campers Arepa Bar"" is a toasted marshmellow spot. This is not that place.Caracas Arepa Bar is, quite simply, one of the best places to eat in New York City. It's some of the best Venezuelan food you will ever eat. It's one of the most delicious ethnic eateries in the USA. It's some of the best Latin food you can imagine. Are you still not sold? Then let me elaborate.""Canucks Arepa Bar"" is in Saskatchewan. It's nowhere near as good as this.The best Arepa you can get here is ""La Surena"". It's a combination of succulent chicken, delicious white cheese, unbelievable avocado, some melt-in-your-mouth hot-sweet plantains, a host of heavenly spices and flavour, all stuffed inside a steaming, soft, dreamy, pillowy, quilted corn pocket known as - of course - an Arepa. But it gets better. Because they add this spicy Chorizo sausage that is off-the-charts delicious. The sausage takes the flavour from one level, off the charts, through the roof, and into the stratosphere. This is one of the best Arepas you will ever eat. Slightly overpriced possibly, but order it - devour it - love it - and see for yourself.""Calorie-counters Arepa Bar"" is a health food place. Don't expect any of that here.Make sure you get all the sauces so that you can try them and see which sauces you like on your arepa. Some are spicy, some are creamy, some are sweet. It's all a matter of taste. The other arepas they sell are all pretty damn good, but nothing compares to La Surena.""Carpets Arepa Bar"" sells flying rugs to Persian Princes. Whereas this place sells pillowy fluffy cloudy heavenly Arepas to Persian Princes (flips hair).As for the drinks, Caracas has some of the best drink selections in the city, in terms of non-alcoholic stuff. Their banana milkshake is smooth and delicious and addictive - but drink it straight away because it spoils easily because it's made from fresh stuffs. And their ""Papelon Con Limon"" is basically brown sugar lemonade, and is delicious. It's not too sweet, so be careful if you don't like sour stuff. The one at Arepas Cafe in Queens is probably slightly better, but on every other level - Caracas wins.""Cappucino Arepa Bar"" is an Italian coffee shop. It has nothing on this place.There are two locations. The original is in the East Village on 7th St. This spot is the second location, and the first to open in Brooklyn.""Camp Arepa Bar"" is in Greenwich Village and is really just a gay dating place. And their food is nowhere near as good as this.If you only eat at 2 or 3 places in NYC... especially if you're in Manhattan or Brooklyn... it's well worth making Caracas Arepa Bar one of them.""Can't Eat Any More Arepa Bar"" is definitely not this place, because the portions here are kind of small-ish. Yet it's some of the best food you'll ever try, so come and get one - asap. The Manhattan location is just as good.",5.0
"My friend has been talking up this place forever, and I had no idea what was in stored for me.The entrance is very low key, and I would never have expected how large this place was. The tables were large allowing our entire party to sit together with the wait time being minimal.The arepas are fairly large for the price. About the size of your palm for 3 bucks. I went with La Pelua shredded beef  and the La De Pernil Pork shoulder, and then ordered them again after they disappeared into my mouth hole. With the prices being so reasonable my table had a number of repeat orders. We added Tostones Mochimeros and yoyos and then realized what we thought were arepas at other locations were just lies.

The sounds the atmosphere the food the smells the service everything was on point. By far some of the best arepas I've had even better than some places in Colombia. Cooked perfectly. Baked so they're not greasy. Perfect crunch on the outside soft on the inside. I had a tasting plate. It's not currently on the menu but I saw some pictures of it on yelp and just asked for it. Food. La popular. 3 arepas cut in halves which were the reina pepiada (chicken and avocado mix salad) la mulata (white cheese w/jalapeños black beens fried sweet plantains) and de pabellon (shredded beef white salty cheese fried plantains and blackbeans) I ate them in that order and every bite was better than the last. These arepas were delicious. It can get really crowded especially by the bar and waiting area on busy nights but the staff does a nice job of moving things along as efficiently as possible. I'll definitely be back,5.0
"Favorite restaurant in the area. My favorite is the De Pabellon. The price is pretty affordable, one arepa fills me up. The drinks are also great.Service is 'eh,' not memorable.",5.0
"It's pricey, but the food is great! The ambience is nice and there is an outside garden! The Latin and Spanish music takes me back.. Ah!It's crazy how much an arepa costs here. But my god, it is good!I am a big fan of the melted cheese. We got these little cheese balls and went for seconds right away. My boyfriend is gluten free and we can't go just anywhere. This place works for us because most dishes are either made with corn flour or plantain flour.Great food, nice ambience. It is a small and cozy place. I liked the pisco sour. Went well with cinnamon.If you order plantain appetizer, beware that it is sweet. Would work better as a dessert.Ps: at the end, bill wasn't bad at all.",5.0
"My boyfriend and I got two arepas and it was the perfect alternative to the average sandwich. We also got chips and guacamole to split, where the chips were made from plantains! This place was really yummy and I would so recommend if you're looking for some light Spanish food.",5.0
"Loved this place! Stopped in for dinner after recommendations from a few friends, having never tried Venezuelan fare. Really interesting, unique decor with a decent size patio in the back. Friendly, attentive service. Good cocktails and a large menu with lots of vegetarian options, try a few appetizers! The highlight was the arepas though, I swear I could eat one every day and because there are so many different filling combinations you'd never get bored. We were so full but couldn't stop eating. I'd love to go back next time I'm in the area.",5.0
"You have never been to Caracas? Then stop reading this and go right now. I have been here two times and plan on going again and again.The first time I tried to go was a Friday night and there was a 2 HOUR wait. Crazy! We came back the next day for brunch and were seated promptly. It was worth coming back for. That time i ate an egg and avocado arepa and the tequenos. The second time I has the pabellon arepa and the guacamole. They also have this malbec (I can't remember the name) and it complimented the beef very well.This is now my favorite spot in Williamsburg, and it helps that it is very affordable!",5.0
"Very bad service for the guy called ""caballero"" the guy with the pony tail , please the manager do something about this guy very rude! Never ever I'm coming back to this place ( I'm authentic person, I'm not a scam)About the food..not authentic Venezuela food. The soup I have to say it is really good.Not authentic chimichuri sauce, I gotta brush my teeth because i found 3 big garlic pieces in my sauce.PLEASE WHEN YOU GO THERE DON'T GO TO THAT GUY ""caballero"". Very bad experience in this place.",1.0
"OMG. This place is amazing. I wish I knew about it earlier. Everything we tried was sooo damn Good. Had an appetizer and 3 arepas split for 2 which might have been much but the GF and I still ate it all.Tried the Pabellon (shredded beef), Pernil (pork shoulder) and the special Victor (chicken) arepas and we both liked them all but the beef the best.The coconut tres leches was amazing and a perfect way to end the meal. Can't wait to come back here again.",5.0
"We sat at the bar because we didnt want to wait for a table. It was a monday night and they said it would be about 15 min wait. I had called ahead but they would not take reservations for a party of two. Ordered a margarita which was delicious. Tried the chorizo croquettes, not enough chorizo in my opinion but stil good with the garlic-cilantro-oil sauce/paste they serve it with.

"As a true Venezuelan, on vacation from Miami and where we have some of the most authentic venezuelan food....I was HIGHLY dissapointed. The waiter was a little on the weird side. He was helpful but weird with the customer service. I had the ""sureña"" and was expecting the greatest arepa ever. The chimichurri consisted of chunks of garlic, onions and peppers. I opted to add cheese and the cheese was barely there. The ""pabellon"" arepa was ok, a little more filling would be ideal but no where near the taste of REAL PABELLON. blah. The waiter hands us a bill for $38.65, we hand rhe credit cards to split the bill and when he returns the new total was $45.18. I asked about it and he got upset, said he was waiting for happy hour to add our beer to the bill, though we were never informed and the bill was correct the first time.

As a hardcore meat lover, even the vegan tofu arepas are delicious. I'm also a big fan of the pescado entree.

We decided to split each arepa in half so we can try a little bit of everything and it was absolutely delicious. I have to say my favorite was the pernil arepa. Keep in mind the arepa is basically the size of your palm so depending how much you eat, you either order more or less. l asked our waiter what's the next best thing aside from their brunch punch and he recommended two drinks which I don't remember the names of the cocktails unfortunately. One drink consisted of passion fruit and rum while the other consisted of blueberries mixed with liquor.Its the only drinks on that menu that have passion fruit for one and blueberries for the other. My friend ordered the passion fruit one while I ordered the blueberry drink. Don't be fooled with the small size of the blueberry cocktail of its potency.

"After a long day of moving to the neighborhood, we decided to give this place a try, and glad we did!  We ordered the chips & guacamole ($6.75), and they came out with plantain and taro chips - loved the taro chips, they were thing, crispy and perfectly salted.  The plantain chips were a bit thicker and could have been a bit crispier, but they were still good.  I ordered the La Surena ($8.50) which had grilled chicken, chorizo, avocado slices and spicy chimi-churri sauce.  The corn flour buns, which are grilled and baked, were perfectly cripsy on the outside but soft on the inside.  I loved the spicy chimi-churri sauce with the chorizo and chicken combo - could have had more avocado in it, but it was still yummy!  They were out of Pacifico beer, but I settled for Victoria.  Will be back again!",4.0

The chips and guacamole was very unique arriving with fresh root chips (yuka, yam and etc...) instead of corn chips, but we ran out of guacamole long before we ran out of chips. The arepas we tried were all very fresh delicious, however one was not quite enough for to make a meal, and at $9 each, two seemed too much. The best arepa I tried had shredded beef and plantains. The beef was juicy and had just touch of heat that was nicely paired with the subtle sweetness of the plantains. The corn bread was moist on the inside and crisp on the outside.

I am writing this review solely on take out. Once I walked in I was greeted and taken care of. I ordered La Surena and Los Muchachos. Both were very good but I like the Los Muchachos better. In La Surenna I do not believe I liked the cheese. Maybe I will try without it next time. The bartender was very nice and was the one who greeted and took my order. While I waited she offered water which was very nice. Wait was not bad about 10 mins. Will have to come in and sit and try other items.,3.0

"Got the lunch special which comes with an arepa and your choice of soup or salad.  I got the La Del Gato and soup.  The arepa was yummy, filled with cheese, plantains and their sauce is to die for.  Just the right amount of spiciness.  Same can be said for the soup.  Fresh vegetable and spice. I didn't think one arepa would be enough to fill me up but with the soup it was just the right amount. I would definitely like to go back and try all the other arepa options.",4.0

I've come here many a time and have never been disappointed by the service, the food, or the ambience. The arepas are all amazing, and before you bite, makes sure to pour on the spicy yet tangy house sauce - so good!Caracas is great for carnivores and vegetarians alike.

"Caracas Arepa Bar has that typical hipster vibe that you see in Williamsburg.  Being an arepa bar, you can of course expect to be the star of the dish to be the arepa.  They have an amazing lunch special for $8.50 you can get a sou or salad + an arepa which makes for a good light lunch.  I opted for the la surena and I will say the arepa itself was perfect.  It was nicely crunchy on the outside and held up to the ingredients when it was stuffed full.  The stuffing needed a little bit of help of hot sauce (which is on every table) and together it was a tasty little bit.  I think if it wasn't for the lunch special, I would think the pricing is a bit higher than they should be knowing that I can get better and cheaper arepas elsewhere.",3.0
I really love the one in the East Village. Maybe something with the night I went also. Now I love this one too but not quite as much. I slipped in right before they closed as my flight into town was late. Got the shredded beef and cheddar arepa with a sugar cane drink. Really hit the spot since I was hungry.

The price listing makes everything seem like cheap eats but they add up we spend $70+ and had a drink an app and 3 arepas which are about $8 each. I tried the pork, the beef and the chicken loved them all add the sauce they put on the table think it's mango something,  it gave them all a good Kick!",4.0
"Staff very friendly, the food amazing, the price is reasonable, the drink a beautifully crafted, a great place to hang with friends and you will leave with you belly full and wallet in tack. The pace is small so there will be a wait, but the bar makes up for it .",4.0
I am writing this review solely on take out. Once I walked in I was greeted and taken care of. I ordered La Surena and Los Muchachos. Both were very good but I like the Los Muchachos better. In La Surenna I do not believe I liked the cheese. Maybe I will try without it next time. The bartender was very nice and was the one who greeted and took my order. While I waited she offered water which was very nice. Wait was not bad about 10 mins. Will have to come in and sit and try other items.,3.0
The seating area in the back is beautiful. I love going here as the food is reliably good and reasonably priced. The waitstaff are friendly and the vibe is laid back and enjoyable.,5.0
"One of my favorite spot in Williamsburg!One Arepa is very filling. The appetizers are on point! I recommend the Tajadas! but I must say what really sold it was the rum punch! The staff was very friendly and helpful, parking was pretty difficult around the area but hey it's Brooklyn.",5.0
"Got the lunch special which comes with an arepa and your choice of soup or salad.  I got the La Del Gato and soup.  The arepa was yummy, filled with cheese, plantains and their sauce is to die for.  Just the right amount of spiciness.  Same can be said for the soup.  Fresh vegetable and spice. I didn't think one arepa would be enough to fill me up but with the soup it was just the right amount. I would definitely like to go back and try all the other arepa options.",4.0
"My boyfriend claims to suffer from an actual addiction to Caracas. I guess that makes me an enabler, but it's a role I'm happy to play so long as the La Mulata Arepa exists.The Grand St location is awesome because of the size and the adorable back garden. I've come here many a time and have never been disappointed by the service, the food, or the ambience. The arepas are all amazing, and before you bite, makes sure to pour on the spicy yet tangy house sauce - so good!Caracas is great for carnivores and vegetarians alike. The guacamole and plantain chips are awesome, and they have a great weekday lunch special (an arepa + soup or salad for $8.50!).",4.0

"Caracas Arepa Bar has that typical hipster vibe that you see in Williamsburg.  Being an arepa bar, you can of course expect to be the star of the dish to be the arepa.  They have an amazing lunch special for $8.50 you can get a sou or salad + an arepa which makes for a good light lunch.  I opted for the la surena and I will say the arepa itself was perfect.  It was nicely crunchy on the outside and held up to the ingredients when it was stuffed full.  The stuffing needed a little bit of help of hot sauce (which is on every table) and together it was a tasty little bit.  I think if it wasn't for the lunch special, I would think the pricing is a bit higher than they should be knowing that I can get better and cheaper arepas elsewhere.",3.0
I really love the one in the East Village. Maybe something with the night I went also. Now I love this one too but not quite as much. I slipped in right before they closed as my flight into town was late. Got the shredded beef and cheddar arepa with a sugar cane drink. Really hit the spot since I was hungry. THough I didnt get to hang out all that long as they closed at 11pm. Perhaps next time I will get a few more hours to hang and eat more things.,4.0
"When we were seated in the patio we sat down at our seats.  Latin food generally consists of the same basic ingredients.

The unique design of the seats seems to have been derived from the scavenging culture of less prosperous nations. An environmentalist would consider it upcycling.

"Whenever I have to impress people who come from out of town, I take them to Caracas. There is no other place in all of NYC that provides such amazingly delicious food for so cheap, and in a great venue to boot (whether at this particular location or the original in the East Village). What is there to say about Caracas besides that? The food is amazingly tasty, especially the crack sauce. I don't know what the crack sauce is actually called, but it's the most delicious substance ever -- it's like Ketchup only infinitely better, and belongs on literally every item here. If I could I would buy a bottle of it. Anchored by the sheer awesomeness of the sauce, the rest of the food -- from crisp tostones to succulent pork -- is elevated to a level that's hard to match at any restaurant where the entrees cost $30+. They also have delicious shakes, with or without booze, and a bevy of other drinks.Which brings us to the best part: everything here is immensely cheap. The arepas (AKA, the things you should get) cost under $10 each, and will manage to fill and delight you. I have come here and gotten an arepa, a coffee, a rum punch, and split an app, all for under $20 with tip and tax. It's like cheap food heaven. Caracas is amazing. There's nothing else to say about it. It's cheap, delicious, and one of the restaurants I go to most frequently. It proves that dining in New York doesn't have to be a quick journey to bankruptcy, nor does cheap eating have to mean getting greasy bodega food.",5.0
"This is by far the largest and nicest of all the Caracas Arepa Bars (so far there's one on the LES and on the Rockaway Beach boardwalk). They have a bar area in the front including a counter open to the sidewalk, in the back there's plenty of seating, and beyond that is a good sized outdoor patio. I came here during happy hour (4-7pm) where you can get a can of Modelo and a shot of rum for $4, how can you beat that?? The best part of my time here was that there wasn't a wait at all, something you rarely find at the other location in Manhattan. The service was friendly and they take cards too making the process here pleasant. I ordered my all time favorite food, the Pabellon Arepa. For the uninformed, pabellon is the national dish of Venezuala consisting of shredded beef, a crumbly salty white cheese, sweet plantains, and black beans. This can be had as a plate ($15) or stuffed into an arepa ($7.50). If you're going with the latter know that 1 isn't quite a meal so get two if you're really hungry or at least a appetizer. The arepa surprisingly came in the matter of a few minutes and was delicious. It wasn't quite as good as I've had elsewhere but the combination of flavors is still amazing. I wish the arepa was 6 bucks for a better value but when there isn't too many other options around, you can jack the price up a little. The one thing that surprised me is that Caracas doesn't make cachapas, a traditional Venezualan dish consisting of soft melted cheese inside of a sweet corn cake. If you're looking for this and the best arepa in the city, go to Arepa Cafe in Queens but this place is a worthy runner up if you don't want to travel.",4.0

"I've been a fan of Caracas Arepa for 7-8 years. This was my first time at their BK location. We arrived at 11:57am, and they opened at noon. They let us in and sat us immediately with menus and water, which was a great first impression. Laura, our lovely, friendly, informative, hard working waitress was extremely helpful and provided us with the best experience. The BK location is the only one with a full bar. The lunch special is always a plus... Get an arepa of choice with a salad or soup for $8.50, which is super cheap when Arepas cost $7.25-$8.50 regularly. We ordered a few arepas. My all time favorite is the ""de pabellon"", which never seize to disappoint with its crunchy arepa, shredded beef, cheese, beans, and sweet plantains, I tried the ""playa deluxe"", which was also delicious but different with its pan seared tilapia, garlic, mushroom, onion, and special mayo sauce. My friend ordered the ""reina pepiada"", which is a chunky chicken avocado salad filling. It wasn't his fave, probably because it's a cold arepa rather than a warm/ hot filling like the others. We also ordered 2 plates of the ""tostones mochimeros"" and boy were they delish. Crunchy flat tostones with a spread of green mayo and sprinkles of their salty cheese. Decor was cute warm and cozy with their old vintage mismatched wall/ceiling panels. Semi old or worn down looking furniture. Cool fixtures with Venezuelan flair.

I'm Venezuelan myself and I've never seen an arepa with Jalapeños. Ok that's fine, maybe they were getting creative there and I appreciate that, but it is nice to know in advance if your order would be spicy or not. Also, the Arepa was really hard, almost crispy. Venezuelan arepas are supposed to be soft. The good thing is that they had a lunch special with nice soup included in the arepa price.

"Visiting friends in the neighborhood, we saw on Yelp there was an arepa place nearby. Sold. Having spent lots of time in Venezuela, we're suckers for a quick arepa snack. It was late afternoon when we visited Caracas Arepa Bar, and there were only a couple of tables occupied. The place is cute and Brooklyn-hipster-esque, rustic, with lots of wood and cool decorations. The bathroom was papered with old Venezuelan newspaper pages. Our server was very nice, but service was SO slow...and we're usually very forgiving of slow service. There's no way an arepa should take that long to make. Even our beverages took 20 minutes or so to arrive, and even then not together. I had the Volvere, with yummy guayanes cheese. All of the arepas we had should have had more cheese. Traditionally, this is much more of a focus, healthy or not. They should highlight the various Venezuelan cheeses on the menu and give a bit more explanation, I think. Their guasacaca was decent. We also tried a Surena, and that was quite good. Tostones were average, and a small portion for $5.75. They can afford to put a couple more on the plate. Overall, it seems like a fun atmosphere and an appealing happy-hour.

"Been going to Caracas for years now. One of my faves in NY. The La Del Gato is my fave and the sauce is off the charts. The cicada smoothie and the guacamole with plantain and yuca chips are so good. The BK location has an outdoor area that takes reservations for large groups. I always take friends from out of town because it's a very cool atmosphere, and something a little different.",5.0
"Mmm, arepas! So hard to find good arepas, and am delighted to find a place dedicated to making so many delicious varieties!

"Today was not at good day for eating Arepas. The worst gift I could give a Venezuelan Mother. Service was not good and the Arepas were mediocre at best.

"If you're like me, when you hear ""Caracas Arepa Bar"" you probably wonder ""what is an arepa and do I want to go to a place that has little else on the menu?"" Well... an arepa needs to be experienced, not explained, but I'll do my best and say it's a Venezuelan corn muffin, crisp on the outside and steamy-soft in the middle, stuffed with any of the following: pulled pork, beef, avocado, black beans, plantains, etc... And if that doesn't get you excited, consider this: the most expensive arepa is $8. Why it's worth it: Let's just say.. when you Google arepa, Caracas is the second listing (first is Wikipedia)Vibe/Layout: The decor of this small and cozy restaurant is warm and hip, with old mismatched wall and ceiling panels, semi-old or worn down looking furniture and cool fixtures which add a Venezuelan flair. Light Latin and Spanish music play in the background of this restaurant, which has a small bar, high top seating and amazing outdoor picnic-table seating.Ideal meal: Yoyos ($6) & Tequenos ($8.75) to start & then La del Gato ($7.25)Tip: Grab din & sangria at Caracas and then check out the speakeasy, Larry Lawrence next door!",5.0
Quick service. Casual dining. Ideal for a pre cinema bite. Absolutely loved the first arepa on the menu (beef) that comes with plantain etc. Didn't enjoy my other choice though - the chorizo and chicken one but they are surprisingly filling!,4.0

"I'll tell you this, they're just as tight-lipped about that secret sauce recipe at this location. I shouldn't seem surprised.

Well, skunked again... While I like the East Village location just fine, I like this BK locale even better. I'm a bit taken with the back garden, and I'm not even an overly, ""Ohh outdoor seating!"" kinda gal. Caracas Arepa Bar, Williamsburg style, has a lovely enclosed stone patio in the back where willowy tree branches float down through the trellises, there's a sweet little Virgin Mary grotto, and you're seated on brightly colored repurposed milk-crates or wooden benches. It's adorable and comfortable and overall an excellent place to feast on some arepas. And everything plantains. I love plantains.  They make these ""yoyos,"" served as sides or starters, that are sweet plantains and white cheese, fried in a cinnamony batter and served with a dipping syrup on the side. Oooh so good if you're feeling breakfast-brunchy. Yuca croquetas and cheesy tequenos are great bites for sharing too. Of course you're coming for the arepas, and these arepas are the ones. The corn patties are light golden and crispy outside, fluffy and steamy inside. I love the ""DePabellon,"" which is stuffed with savory shredded beef, salty white cheese, black beans, and delicious sweet plantains. Ample amounts of that salsa concoction in squirt bottles on your table make it all tastily complete. I would have originally repped DePabellon as my favorite, but the true truth of the matter is that the one I order most, her name is, ""La Mulata."" She's a vegetarian. This arepa really does the trick for the ole gal- it's full of grilled cheese, red peppers, hot jalapenos, black beans, and sweet plantains. I don't need to mention that table sauce again, but you know that goes right in there too. If you can't seem to decide which arepa strikes your fancy and you're with a pal, Caracas Arepas Bar also offers a plate for two to share which features mini arepas versions each: two ""DePabellon,"" two ""La Mulata,"" and two ""Reina Pepiada"" (Mild yet tasty cold chicken and avocado salad). An arepas feast for two. So, as I was sniffing around for the elusive salsa ingredients, almost as if to distract me away from pestering for clues, one of our friendly servers asked us if we really liked hot and spicy food. YES, in fact, yes we do! He vanished for a moment and then quickly reappeared with a squirt bottle of creamy orange sauce that was truly hot and flavorful. I loved it. Great stuff. Written on its masking tape label was the word, ""Chingona."" Was that the name? Cause if it's, ""Chingona,"" if so, then it's an accurate one... cause that sauce was one badass business.

"About a month ago, I went to Caracas based on the reviews on Yelp. It was a super hot day and when I was seated near the garden (by the window), I was hoping for a cool breeze. After acclimating to the temperature inside the restaurant, I felt comfy enough to order. The 1st thing I ordered was the yoyos, which are sweet plantains with cinnamon plantain batter with white cheese on top. and it came with a sugary sauce. It was good--I grew up eating plantains so this was not as amazing to me as others have posted. What did wow me was the arepa I ordered. I had ordered la de pernil, also based on yelp reviews, and it was very tasty. The outside of the arepa was crispy, while the inside was soft and the pernil was juicy. Next time I do visit, I will order based on what I am craving rather than what I have read. It's much more exciting that way. :-)",4.0
"Friendly staff very attentive to you. Since it was such a beautiful day out. I enjoyed my meal in their garden area. Which was a cute quaint little space. For meal I opted for the lunch special which runs from 12 noon til 4pm. You can order 1 arepa and it comes with a mixed salad. The salad was small but perfectly sized in portion.  Mixed greens , shredded carrots I think mushrooms (forgot to ask, but was delicious) tomatoes and balsamic vingerette.

"The ""Michelada"" was one of the best that I've had this far off the Caribbean coast. For my meal I had the ""pelua"" arepa which is supposed to be just shredded beef; however, it had way too many seasonings and lacked the authentic flavors of a real ""Pelua"". I added Guayanes cheese since it would be a more traditional way rather than the cheddar that is included in it. The dough for the arepa was ok. I grew up on this so I recognize a good Arepa when I see it. They should take it easy with the seasoning of the beef.",2.0
"The food here is amazing. Although Caracas specializes in arepas, my favorite dishes are actually the mains. My go-to is now the Pabellon Criollo - the shredded beef is to die for, and the plate as a whole is so delicious (a perfect blend of salty, spicy and sweet). I only give the restaurant a 4 because it can get a little unorganized and crowded in the small space there, which detracts from the overall experience. If I was rating on food alone I would give it a 5!",4.0

Like, too hot to live. I don't know how people were eating in there.  I also don't know why the hostess didn't offer us a table outside, but when I asked, she moved us outdoors - Luckily, too, because we would have had to eat elsewhere if she hadn't.Food was great.  I don't suggest getting the cocktails that come in those bigass bowls for two.  It was so sugary that my hangover hit me while I was still eating dinner.

"Food was horrible, I can't believe people actually eat this. I ordered ""los muchachos"" arepa, that think was inedible. It was dry like a piece of cardboard and spicy. I mean SPICY,   I'm of Mexican background, and I know what spicy is. If I think this is spicy, believe me it's spicy!!! I traveled a lot between LA and NY, so I had tasted the spiciest food. It had both vinegar jalapeños and raw jalapeños with the seeds still inside. The chorizo literally tastes like foam chips. I orders the guava natural juice, that thing didn't taste anything like guava, it looked like plain water with pinkish food coloring. The service was meh, the waitress looked like if she barely had energy to stand. If you come here, come dressed in your best hipster attire, and ask for a table outside, might as well take cute pictures for Instagram, because the food sucks.",2.0

I believe there are a couple options at the Brooklyn location that aren't available in Manhattan, but I have been to Manhattan more recently and perhaps both changed their menus. In any event, go to the Brooklyn location so that you can actually get a seat.You can't go wrong with any of the arepas. Get the plantain chips and guacamole. Also get the michelada with an extra tequila shot.",4.0
"Great ambience. Outdoor seating is available. It was my friends first time in Brooklyn and I'm glad we went here. I had the ""Los Muchachos"" arepa which has chorizo and sweet plantains. Decently priced as well.",5.0
"The ""Michelada"" was one of the best that I've had this far off the Caribbean coast. For my meal I had the ""pelua"" arepa which is supposed to be just shredded beef; however, it had way too many seasonings and lacked the authentic flavors of a real ""Pelua"". I added Guayanes cheese since it would be a more traditional way rather than the cheddar that is included in it. The dough for the arepa was ok. I grew up on this so I recognize a good Arepa when I see it. They should take it easy with the seasoning of the beef.",2.0
"The food here is amazing. Although Caracas specializes in arepas, my favorite dishes are actually the mains. My go-to is now the Pabellon Criollo - the shredded beef is to die for, and the plate as a whole is so delicious (a perfect blend of salty, spicy and sweet). I only give the restaurant a 4 because it can get a little unorganized and crowded in the small space there, which detracts from the overall experience. If I was rating on food alone I would give it a 5!",4.0
"I should've written this last summer. Caracas + a backyard? Sold.  arepas are awesome and the guac is reaaaallllyyy good.  I had only ever been to the Caracas in the East Village so it was awesome to see this one had a super cute backyard.  We came on a really nice night in the summer and the dining area was HOT. Like, too hot to live. I don't know how people were eating in there.  I also don't know why the hostess didn't offer us a table outside, but when I asked, she moved us outdoors - Luckily, too, because we would have had to eat elsewhere if she hadn't.Food was great.  I don't suggest getting the cocktails that come in those bigass bowls for two.  It was so sugary that my hangover hit me while I was still eating dinner. Seriously.  The headache was REAL.",3.0
No Guasacaca in a Venezuelan restaurant is like no Guacamole in a Mexican restaurant. Very disappointed!,3.0
"No complaints at all. The drinks are delicious and strong. The arepas are what makes this place, I'm not a vegetarian but my favorite has to be the mulata, there's the right amount of sweet and spicy that it doesn't make me miss meat.",5.0
"Food was horrible, I can't believe people actually eat this. I ordered ""los muchachos"" arepa, that think was inedible. It was dry like a piece of cardboard and spicy. I mean SPICY,   I'm of Mexican background, and I know what spicy is. If I think this is spicy, believe me it's spicy!!! I traveled a lot between LA and NY, so I had tasted the spiciest food. It had both vinegar jalapeños and raw jalapeños with the seeds still inside. The chorizo literally tastes like foam chips. I orders the guava natural juice, that thing didn't taste anything like guava, it looked like plain water with pinkish food coloring. The service was meh, the waitress looked like if she barely had energy to stand. If you come here, come dressed in your best hipster attire, and ask for a table outside, might as well take cute pictures for Instagram, because the food sucks.",2.0
"I mean, we spent four hours here. We made it from the bar all the way to the outdoor seating- drinking, eating, drinking, eating, laughing, the ENTIRE time. To start, the bar gets the party started. Begin with papelon con limon. Authentic Venezuelan refreshing drink. Then, continue with the Rum Punch for two. It can definitely be shared among a great group of people. For lunch, treat yourself to the arepas + soup/salad combo. You will not regret any of the stuffed arepas. My favorite is La Muchachas!

"My friend and I went to the LES location. We were seated right away without a reservation. The place is quite small so I don't see it working for big parties. However, the arepas are just amazing. This is my second time here and I will be returning. The two people I've been with have enjoyed their arepas as well. The menu is not extensive but is a powerhouse. I've had two arepas and tried two others, and every single one has been delicious. Thus far, ""La de pernil"" is my favorite one. If you enjoy drinking beer, the cold ""Michelada"" is a great combo with the arepas. The flan the coco is just right, light, not too sweet with tons of flavor.

"While I was in New York, specifically the Brooklyn area, I had nothing but good food so I've been trigger happy with the 5 stars.  But this place is just as deserving of it in my book.We called in to see what the wait was and were told it was ~20 minutes, so we decided to go.  I want to say we went at 6pm on a Friday night but I can't remember.  When we got there we were seated instantly.   Score.We were given water instantly.  It took a while for our waiter to get to us and take our order but it's fine - they were fairly busy.   We ordered their Guasacaca & chips (6.75$) as a starter.  It came with plantain chips, yucca chips, and guacamole.  The chips were all perfectly crisp and flavorful and the guacamole was some of the best I've had.  GET IT.  I wish I could have some right now...We also ordered arepas of course!  I didn't know what they were at first but I was pleasantly surprised.  We got the ""De Pabellon"" (beef, black beans, cheese, plantains - 8$), ""La Surena"" (chicken, chorizo, avocado, chimichurri sauce - 8.5$), and ""Playa Deluxe"" (tilapia, mushrooms, avocado, onions, mayo - 8.5$).    DROOL.  I don't usually eat beef but the shredded beef in the De Pabellon was flavorful, nicely shredded, and had no fat.  The chimichurri sauce in La Surena was probably the best sauce ever.  I didn't get to try the Playa Deluxe but my friends said it was good.   I wasn't very hungry to begin with so these were good portions, but if I was actually hungry I think that I'd be good with ordering two.  Except I wouldn't like the price of that but it tastes so good maybe I wouldn't care.  Also!  The sauce they provide is good.  I have no idea what it is but it's slightly sweet and tan-brown looking.   You can also ask for their hot sauce...and I don't know what is in it (except chilis and it apparently has dairy) but it's orangey and hella spicy.  I loved it but it could only be had in moderation because my mouth was on fire.  They also have a wide variety of rums.  If you like rum, come here.  Come and have your rum with some tasty arepas and chips.  I wish there was an arepa bar where I live. :(",5.0

"I came here on a Saturday afternoon with 2 native Venezuelans...they say average. I'd have to agree.

I wasnt a huge fan and there was not enough cheese. The sauce they have on the table is also sweet too so it was kind of overwhelming. The arepa itself was nice and crunchy though and the meat was tender.It was my friends bday so I asked if the staff could do anything (called from inside the bathroom...classy right?). They were kind enough to surprise her with the coconut tres leches (which they charged us for...is that weird?). I will say that the enthusiasm of the waiter who brought it was kinda sad. He looked like he lost a bet, mumbled ""happy birthday"" a few times and left us with the cake. Pretty awkward but my friend really like the cake...said it tasted just like the one her aunt makes!Last thing was the waiter. Nice enough but he literally came to the table all of 3 times from when we sat down to when I had to flag him down to get the check.

"Caracas is the place that I went to at the end of every semester of grad school after I finished my exams and wanted to celebrate.  I love the casual atmosphere and delicious food and drinks.  I usually get one La del Gato arepa (cheese, plantains, and avocado) and one De Guasacaca (cheese and guacamole), and I'm stuffed by the end of the meal.  Of course I dump the sweet & slightly-spicy sauce all over those arepas.  I love the papelon con limon (like a sugary lemon-lime aid) and the cocktails are tasty, too.  They have a great happy hour.  The service is pretty quick, although occasionally the hostess can be annoying about where she seats you (she once refused to seat us at a regular table and would only seat us at a tall bar table).  My only other complaint is that none of the desserts look appealing to me, so I've never tried them.  However, there are plenty of other places in the neighborhood to get dessert (Milkbar, anyone?).Plus, I've only rarely had to wait here, whereas you are almost guaranteed a wait at the East Village location.  Do yourself a favor and take the L train 2 stops into Brooklyn - you'll be eating faster than if you wait in Manhattan.",4.0

"Caracas is the place that I went to at the end of every semester of grad school after I finished my exams and wanted to celebrate.  I love the casual atmosphere and delicious food and drinks.  I usually get one La del Gato arepa (cheese, plantains, and avocado) and one De Guasacaca (cheese and guacamole), and I'm stuffed by the end of the meal.  Of course I dump the sweet & slightly-spicy sauce all over those arepas.  I love the papelon con limon (like a sugary lemon-lime aid) and the cocktails are tasty, too.  They have a great happy hour.  The service is pretty quick, although occasionally the hostess can be annoying about where she seats you (she once refused to seat us at a regular table and would only seat us at a tall bar table).  My only other complaint is that none of the desserts look appealing to me, so I've never tried them.  However, there are plenty of other places in the neighborhood to get dessert (Milkbar, anyone?).Plus, I've only rarely had to wait here, whereas you are almost guaranteed a wait at the East Village location.  Do yourself a favor and take the L train 2 stops into Brooklyn - you'll be eating faster than if you wait in Manhattan.",4.0
"Good food, i've been in a real caracas arepera in venezuela and this is quite close to the real thing. Tequeños are really good, but portions are small. I mean we are talking about peoples food, food that you buy on the street, prices should not be that high. But definetely i will come back.",4.0

"Oh hey, friends. What's an arepa, you say? It's the perfect way to end a rainy Wednesday. It's the gateway drug of Colombian food.

It's that stick-to-your-ribs dinner that doesn't allow for the 11 p.m. hangries.It's also, according to Caracas' website, impossible to define. So, in order to try one of these corn flour patties stuffed with meat, cheese, plantains, and delicious sauces, you'll have to just take the plunge. Be brave. Be bold. Try the arepas.I had a special arepa, bursting at the seams with chorizo, braised pork shoulder, chimchurri sauce, and fresh avocado. Yum. I also got an appetizer alongside it (under the heading ""Sidekicks"" on the menu.

It was more of a passion fruit flavored flan with a bitter berry sauce instead of a sweet caramel. I have no idea what the sauce consisted of or why they would add it to the flan mousses because it over powered the passion flavor and was simply awfully bitter and not good at all.  However, instead of sending back the dessert, we simply asked the waiter to bring out an additional plate and transferred the flan or ""mousse"" itself and dabbed away the sauce and enjoyed the passion flavored flan as it should be and left happily without complaints.

My husband had the chorizo and chicken arepa which was good considering I'm not a huge fan of chorizo. But my arepa was absolutely amazing! I got the pernil arepa that comes with the spicy mango sauce..loved it. I thought of ordering two Arepas but thank goodness I didn't .. With the guacamole and the arepa I was content. The Arepas are very filling we didn't even have room for dessert. We ordered a pitcher of sangria and it was also very good. We sat outside in the garden which was pleasant.

"'This is the place I want to go.''Remember this place, I want to go here.''Name where I want to go on Grand St!'Above are some quotes and intense questioning I heard for months before visiting Caracas. I knew I had to come, because it was one of those few places my girlfriend actually was really interested in going to. Finally, we made a visit this past Friday.Arrived at 8:30, which we really thought was going to be an hour wait, but somehow, everyone in front of us on the list disappeared. Note my YouTube link before reading the rest of my review.youtube.com/watch?v=eSku…Anyway. We sat down and ordered two Micheladas ($7) featuring Pacifico beer, which were good until the salty ending to which we couldn't even finish them. First up was an order of Guasacca & Chips ($6.25) that basically had a huge amount of chips with a medium amount of guac. I can't complain a lot because these chips and guac were really tasty, especially the plantain chips that had the perfect amount of salt on them. Unfortunately, we then ordered ANOTHER appetizer of Tajadas ($4.50), which are more sweet plantains with a salty dipping cheese. These plantains were very tasty and they give you quite a bit for such a low cost, but it was just too much food by this point. Lastly, our Arepas came out.I ordered the La de Pernil ($7.50) which is shredded pork shoulder with a tomato slice. I was quite disappointed with this arepa, especially after tasting my girlfriends. My girlfriend ordered an amazing Vista al Mar ($8.00) consisting of a big slice of tilapia, pickled onions, radish, parsley, cilantro, and oregano spread. When she received this arepa, the bottom was all green, but the combination of these plants make it unbelievably delicious. It was by far the best of the meal.I realized halfway through the meal that Caracas is definitely a place where I would come with friends because of the atmosphere and the smaller dishes that could allow a lot being ordered, sharing, and still a low price at the end. The chips were delicious as we kept eating them throughout the meal, but give me more guac! Besides that, I would nix the Micheladas for a beer & a shot then kill a bunch of Vista al Mar arepas.By the way.

"I had my first arepa here so I can't compare the arepas here to others but I can say that I was satisfied from my first experience. Make sure you come here I guess.. not the one in the city because I had a few people telling me that they hated the Caracas arepas in the city.We got guac & chips and mozzarella cheese sticks as appetizers. They give you a lot. I wouldn't mind coming here to have a drink with some guac & chips and other appetizers. I would get guac & chips for sure though because their guac is delicious. Also the chips are plantain & taro chips so it's still tasty without the guac. Mozzarella sticks were not salty, unlike other salty/oily cheese sticks, so it was very different yet yummy. Make sure to get all two sauces they have. It's great with everything. We used this sauce for all the appetizers and arepas (must). Next time I would order some other appetizer though just to see which one is better. We went during the lunch time so we ordered lunch deals (salad/soup & one arepa). Such a good deal. I got De Pabellon, which had shredded beef with black beans, cheese, and plantains. I didn't like to eat plantain with the arepa so I took it out and ate it separately. This arepa kinda had a mexican food flavor. My friend got La De Pernil, which had pork shoulder, tomatoes, and spicy mango sauce. If mine had mexican flavor, this had indian food flavor. Kinda spicy but very good. Overall, very satisfied. Staffs are nice and it was fun eating outside.",5.0
BEST AREPAS in nyc. So so so good! Definitely recommend. We went there before going out for the night and didn't expect to find a gem. Plus they gave us a free shot of rum w our beer. Do try!,5.0
"Went here with the boy over the weekend for some tasty arepas + drinks.  I was not dissapointed.  I had the mango mimosa - small, but strong, some of his plantains, and a chicken and cheese arepa.  Everything was very tasty, and filling, and not too expensive (around $40 for the two of us).  Definitely a cute little Williamsburg spot  - good for a date or dinner with a friend, but probably not a large group, as it's tiny.",4.0
"Awesome Place!Always heard good things, so I thought it was time to try it myself. My brother and I shared 3 arepas and 2 side kicks, which was more than enough to satiate our appetite before a night of drinking.

Came here with my husband for the first time and we cannot stop raving about how delicious the Arepas are! We had the guacamole and plantain chips for our app. The guacamole was fresh and delish! My husband had the chorizo and chicken arepa which was good considering I'm not a huge fan of chorizo. But my arepa was absolutely amazing! I got the pernil arepa that comes with the spicy mango sauce..loved it. I thought of ordering two Arepas but thank goodness I didn't .. With the guacamole and the arepa I was content. The Arepas are very filling we didn't even have room for dessert. We ordered a pitcher of sangria and it was also very good. We sat outside in the garden which was pleasant. For those who say that the service is slow...People .. The Arepas are freshly hand made and baked not fried that's why it takes a little longer! We will definitely be returning here we absolutely loved it!,5.0
"'This is the place I want to go.''Remember this place, I want to go here.''Name where I want to go on Grand St!'Above are some quotes and intense questioning I heard for months before visiting Caracas. I knew I had to come, because it was one of those few places my girlfriend actually was really interested in going to. Finally, we made a visit this past Friday.Arrived at 8:30, which we really thought was going to be an hour wait, but somehow, everyone in front of us on the list disappeared. Note my YouTube link before reading the rest of my review.youtube.com/watch?v=eSku…Anyway. We sat down and ordered two Micheladas ($7) featuring Pacifico beer, which were good until the salty ending to which we couldn't even finish them. First up was an order of Guasacca & Chips ($6.25) that basically had a huge amount of chips with a medium amount of guac. I can't complain a lot because these chips and guac were really tasty, especially the plantain chips that had the perfect amount of salt on them. Unfortunately, we then ordered ANOTHER appetizer of Tajadas ($4.50), which are more sweet plantains with a salty dipping cheese.

I am, however, one of the fans of Caracas. 4 stars!Caracas brought the arepa sandwich mainstream. I have spent many a weekend lunches and cheap dinners sitting at the window of the take out store on East 7th. I waited once 40 minutes to sit at the tiny restaurant next door. And now Caracas has brought their arepa sandwiches to Williamsburg with an amply sized seating room, patio, and rum list for partaking. I like it. I like it a lot. It's a little lodge-like but I like it.We got La Popular where they cut three sandwiches in half. Perfect for sharing. My favorite really is the La de Pabellon. There's something about the sweet plantains mixed with the shredded beef that really does it for me. I saved that one for my last sandwich. The sampler also came with La Reina Pepiada and La Mulata. The Reina Pepiada was my least favorite (chicken and avocado salad). But if you pour on the sauce they have on the table, it makes it a whole lot more exciting, tastier and a little spicy. The Mulata was pretty good. Frankly, I like anything spicy. And since it also had sweet plantains, the spiciness was balanced. So good. One sandwich will do for a snack but if you get a few for sharing, then it really becomes a proper meal.For an appetizer we got the Tostones Mochimeros which my date rated as A+! I'm on a star rating scale and it was definitely up there. The Tostones Mochimeros were pretty interesting. Pretty and delectable. Smashed fried green plantains topped with mojito mayo and white cheese. Maybe cotija. Can't wait to order them again.This location is a bit out of the way for me but worth the trek if you want to relax a bit in a nicer setting than the East Village one. Hmmm.

"I've loved Caracas for a long, long time. When I heard they were opening a Brooklyn location, I couldn't have been happier. And it's bigger?

"This is one of my favorite south american spots. And they really specialize in stuffed arepas. I spent many summers in Caracas  and soon became addicted to arepas, but I never any that can match these. The actually arepa is just a vehicle for what they put inside. You have a wide variety of choices of really slow cooked goodness, from shredded beef, to fish, sweet cheese and plantains, it goes on and on. There are too many options so I usually go for the pick three combo deal. However, if you start hitting the expansive rum selection, you might just get really hammered, really quick.",5.0
I love this place.  It's bigger and less crowded than the Manhattan location. I've always been happy with the food and service. My only complaint is inadequate air conditioning in the summer.  Cold beers definitely help.FYI: Awesome happy hour deal of $3 Modelo can and $1 Venezuelan rum shot!,5.0

"Let me start by saying that this restaurant is so far my favorite place to eat! I gave Caracas Arepa Bar five stars bc I havent had not one bad experience there. I am now a vegan however I have been here twice before i cut meat and dairy from my diet and three times after I became vegan.I remember the very first night I went there for dinner and drinks with an old boyfriend. I can't remember what day of the week it was but the place was packed and the wait was not even brutal-30 mins. When we were seated I was disappointed at the seating arrangements bc I was so close to the couple sitting next to us that I might as well been included in their convo. BUT you will quickly get over that minor flaw when you have their amaaaazingg unique drinks. They are all so tasty and interesting. I love them all.Food.. perfection!! The food is FULL of flavor. I could eat it every day. Even after I became a vegan I was still so pleased! I remember being surprised to see that you can substitute some of their meat dishes for vegetarian choices such as tofu or veggies and even then it was mouth watering. Even my non-vegan boyfriend said so. Service.. for me it was out of this world. I had amazing experiences with their staff. Extremely polite, informative, helpful, caring, understanding, & the list goes on!",5.0
"This place is as GREAT as it gets!  The food is absolutely delicious, the signature drinks (the Cocolada and Mojito to be specific) are delightful, and the service is both very friendly and seriously on point.  The decor at the Williamsburg location is wonderful.  It has an urban artistic look, with a high class DIY feel - but a homey, intimate and fun vibe.  The servers are attentive, they even smile! - and on a busy Saturday night the food was quick and fresh.I went to bed with dreams of arepas filling my head...  and awoke wishing I had more for breakfast.Caracas, you have a new super fan with me!!  I will be back anytime I head to Brooklyn.",5.0

"the green sauce... oh the green sauce... how I love you so.  I bought the pricey little bottle ($10!!!) and use it on anything and everything. Now the restaurant experience: cool chill place. Got a seat in the window. a little squished but good. it was hard to decide on which arepas to get. They all sounded so amazing and there are like 4veg options!  We got bloody marys that were good, but not amazing.  Plantain chips and guac on the other hand- LOVE! We got 3 of the 4 veg arepas and all were pretty gosh darn delicious!",4.0
"This is one of my favorite south american spots. And they really specialize in stuffed arepas. I spent many summers in Caracas  and soon became addicted to arepas, but I never any that can match these. The actually arepa is just a vehicle for what they put inside. You have a wide variety of choices of really slow cooked goodness, from shredded beef, to fish, sweet cheese and plantains, it goes on and on. There are too many options so I usually go for the pick three combo deal. However, if you start hitting the expansive rum selection, you might just get really hammered, really quick.",5.0
I love this place.  It's bigger and less crowded than the Manhattan location. I've always been happy with the food and service. My only complaint is inadequate air conditioning in the summer.  Cold beers definitely help.FYI: Awesome happy hour deal of $3 Modelo can and $1 Venezuelan rum shot!,5.0
I wish I had more stars to give to this place. They have an amazing selection on rums and their arepas are incredible. Must also try their black beans with rice! I wish they'd open up a location in jersey,5.0
"Let me start by saying that this restaurant is so far my favorite place to eat! I gave Caracas Arepa Bar five stars bc I havent had not one bad experience there. I am now a vegan however I have been here twice before i cut meat and dairy from my diet and three times after I became vegan.I remember the very first night I went there for dinner and drinks with an old boyfriend. I can't remember what day of the week it was but the place was packed and the wait was not even brutal-30 mins. When we were seated I was disappointed at the seating arrangements bc I was so close to the couple sitting next to us that I might as well been included in their convo. BUT you will quickly get over that minor flaw when you have their amaaaazingg unique drinks. They are all so tasty and interesting. I love them all.Food.. perfection!! The food is FULL of flavor. I could eat it every day. Even after I became a vegan I was still so pleased! I remember being surprised to see that you can substitute some of their meat dishes for vegetarian choices such as tofu or veggies and even then it was mouth watering. Even my non-vegan boyfriend said so. Service.. for me it was out of this world. I had amazing experiences with their staff. Extremely polite, informative, helpful, caring, understanding, & the list goes on!",5.0
"This place is as GREAT as it gets!  The food is absolutely delicious, the signature drinks (the Cocolada and Mojito to be specific) are delightful, and the service is both very friendly and seriously on point.  The decor at the Williamsburg location is wonderful.  It has an urban artistic look, with a high class DIY feel - but a homey, intimate and fun vibe.  The servers are attentive, they even smile! - and on a busy Saturday night the food was quick and fresh.I went to bed with dreams of arepas filling my head...  and awoke wishing I had more for breakfast.Caracas, you have a new super fan with me!!  I will be back anytime I head to Brooklyn.",5.0

"Arepas are pockets of harmonious flavor and bliss. Not as immense as a burrito, fluffier than a taco, cuter than a sandwich, and more texture than a pita, these guys pack a mean punch. Whether you're a carnivorous tyrannosaurus rex or an herbivorous kangaroo - Caracas certainly has an arepa for you! Tilapia. Pork shoulder. Shredded beef. Grilled chicken. Guyanese cheese. Plantains. Caramelized onions. Avocados. Mangos. Tomatoes. Sauteed Peppers. Black beans. Honestly any combination is seasoned in a deliciously perfect marriage of flavor. Caracas has an amazing rum selection. I suggest you try the Flor de Caña. ""Sugarcane flower"" as it translates, is strong but not overwhelming and gets you feeling pretty good after a few sips. And if you want something easy but with a nice kick, try a Michelada -- beer with a hint of salty, spicy, and sweet. Walk over to the backyard area and you certainly feel like you're in a Venezuelan jungle (minus the jaguars and tapirs) -- abundant greenery, a bubbling fountain, wooden tables, stool crates -- and amongst it all, Caracas, a little hidden village.The townspeople, I mean waitstaff, were decently pleasant but not always detail oriented and attentive with orders. I have yet to try their plates, and I've been eyeing the ceviche. I'll definitely be back for another tasteful adventure.",4.0
"Found this place through yelp and I loved it. I love the feel and look of the place and the food was excellent. I got an arepa pablellon which was stuffed with shredded beef, black beans, sweet plantains, and white cheese. Very very flavorful, and there secret sauce was the perfect topper. I also had the tostones mochimeros, which were topped with mojito mayo and white salty cheese. They were a great topping. Definitely would come back here, especially during happy hour.",5.0
"There are way over 300 reviews already, so I'll keep it simple.Eat here.  Eat here now.  Everything is amazing and delicious, reasonably priced, and a super cool atmosphere.  Now, if only they would upgrade their service, I would give them their 5th star.  Seriously, their servers just forget your exist.  Otherwise?  Spot on.  I can't wait to go back.",4.0
"Can't believe after all these years I haven't reviewed Caracas....perhaps it is just because I am in too much of a daze of happiness after I go here.  Caracas has by far the best Arepas I have ever had....these are not the mediocre hockey pucks you get at summer street fairs but the real deal.  We used to regularly go to the impossibly small and always crowder East Village location but now drive from Carroll Gardens to Williamsburg just to get these delightful arepas.  The Williamsburg location is large, has a great vibe, and great back yard and is usually very easy to get a table at.  Service is always friendly but slow....but I don't blame this on staff but rather that it takes time and care to make the arepas.  I like them all but the De Pabellon is my absolute favorite and highly addictive (is there crack in there?).  The other arepas are excellent but you have to eat them before the De Pabellon because nothing can compare to the flavor.  Tried the Carupanera (egg peppers onions and chorizo) for the first time today and while it was good, eggs were a bit dry, which combined with the semi-dry chorizo didn't work for me.  Nonetheless I still give this place 5 stars for the food.  Usually don't go for brunch, but noticed they have unlimited mimosa's for $15 on weekends...may have to give a try.",5.0

"One of my new favorite places to eat. I tried my first arepa at some place in lower Manhattan and couldn't get it out of my mind. Now I live in walking distance from Caracas and couldn't be happier.

"Went with a group a five co-workers for Happy Hour on a Thursday night which turned into a three course meal.  For six dollars each we started off with a beer and a shot of rum.  Some of the tropical cocktails were also ordered and recieved good reviews.  Next, we ordered appetizers to share; the guacamole, plaintains and potatoe cakes.  With five people we were able to have one or two bites each of the appetizers.  Everything was delcious so were were all left wanting more.I ordered the chedder and beef arepa.  My coworker who had spent the past two years living in Spain described arepas to me as latin hot pockets.  As a result, I was surprised that the the shell was less doughy and more crunchy than I expected (I have never actually eaten a Hot Pocket so I don't know how I came up with these expectations).  The beef and cheese combo ended up being very greesy and dripping all over the place. With the dim lighting, lots of napkins and being out with girlfriends, this was not an issue.  This greesy, crunchy hot pocket was exactly what I needed after a few beers and shot of rum.  Lastly, we ordered two desserts to share for the table.  The best part about the meal was that the three courses and drinks cost only $35 a person.  For the quality and quantity the we had recieved this was a steal.",4.0

I overdid it ordering not knowing what to expect. 2 is plenty. I started with a coconut concoction similar to a pina colada called the Coconut Groove ($9) to help cool me down and an order of their famous yoyos ($5.75). The yoyos are deep fried sweet plantains halved and stuffed with white cheese. They serve them with a maple syrup like dipping sauce. Absolutely awesome. Great way to start. Here is where I went overboard though. I was a little bummed they were out of the special seafood arepa, it was only 6:45 on a Saturday night, but ok whatever so I ordered 3 off the regular menu.

"Terrible service, wonderful food.  Please don't arrive hungry because you will be angry at how long it takes to be seated and how long your food takes to arrive.  That being said, I would kick a baby for one of their delicious ""de pollo"" arepas.  These things are deceptively small - I thought I could easily scarf down two or three but they are so filling!  They come out piping hot, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and packed to the hilt with meat, cheese, veggies, and whatever else you want.  Make sure to smother it with the hot sauce provided on the table (I'm pretty sure the main ingredient is crack).  Try the limeade - it's flavored with cane sugar and it's everything a limeade could ever hope to be.The only gripe - the service here is abhorrent.  I understand that this isn't fast food, but it shouldn't take an hour for your order to be taken and for your food to arrive.  If you can bear to wait, the food's worth it.",4.0
"This place is everything I could ever ask for and more. First and foremost...rum. Their rum selection is fantastic. As a bit of a rum fanatic I must say that there was a great choice of rums for all kinds of drinkers, both mixed and up or on the rocks. Their rum menu gives you a good detail of what each is like, where its from (which is important in the rum world) and what its best for. They had some on there which I haven't had before and was very eager to try. After many different straight rums and mixed drinks I can officially say that a rum bar like this is a fantastic idea with a perfect execution.Now onto the food. My wife and I sat in the back garden which was a nice size, a good vibe and a great atmosphere. You pretty much forgot you were in Brooklyn. Their happy hour was great, their food menu has a number of outstanding selections and their arepas are excellent. We had the one off the special menu and three others I can't remember how to pronounce and none of them failed to deliver in both taste and size. It's a definite hit and a spot we'll return to again in the not-too-distant future, most likely with a group of friends too.

"Terrible service, wonderful food.  Please don't arrive hungry because you will be angry at how long it takes to be seated and how long your food takes to arrive.  That being said, I would kick a baby for one of their delicious ""de pollo"" arepas.  These things are deceptively small - I thought I could easily scarf down two or three but they are so filling!  They come out piping hot, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and packed to the hilt with meat, cheese, veggies, and whatever else you want.  Make sure to smother it with the hot sauce provided on the table (I'm pretty sure the main ingredient is crack).  Try the limeade - it's flavored with cane sugar and it's everything a limeade could ever hope to be.The only gripe - the service here is abhorrent.  I understand that this isn't fast food, but it shouldn't take an hour for your order to be taken and for your food to arrive.  If you can bear to wait, the food's worth it.",4.0
"This place is everything I could ever ask for and more. First and foremost...rum. Their rum selection is fantastic. As a bit of a rum fanatic I must say that there was a great choice of rums for all kinds of drinkers, both mixed and up or on the rocks. Their rum menu gives you a good detail of what each is like, where its from (which is important in the rum world) and what its best for. They had some on there which I haven't had before and was very eager to try. After many different straight rums and mixed drinks I can officially say that a rum bar like this is a fantastic idea with a perfect execution.Now onto the food. My wife and I sat in the back garden which was a nice size, a good vibe and a great atmosphere. You pretty much forgot you were in Brooklyn. Their happy hour was great, their food menu has a number of outstanding selections and their arepas are excellent. We had the one off the special menu and three others I can't remember how to pronounce and none of them failed to deliver in both taste and size. It's a definite hit and a spot we'll return to again in the not-too-distant future, most likely with a group of friends too. Nothing like good food (at a very reasonable price), good drinks (their happy hour $2 PBR's and a shot of rum for a buck more) and even better...rum.",5.0
"With two locations, in Williamsburg and the East Village, Caracas offers a sit down restaurant as well as delivery. Both locations offer a great happy hour from 4-7PM, and the Williamsburg Caracas has an additional rum bar. Arepas are popular in Venezula because of their versatility and can be eaten for breakfast, lunch or dinner.I went on Thursday and the restaurant was packed, but we were able to be seated immediately. I started with the Rockaway Margarita, made with orange liqueur and garnished with a lemon and salt rim. Killer drink. For starters, we shared the Croquetas, which were made from yucca potato cakes, deep fried with a chorizo, corn and cilantro filling. Bursting with flavor, the Croquetas has a light crispy exterior and a soft, creamy inside, served with a delicious sauce made primarily from cilantro. It resembled a chimmichurri but was thicker and bolder in flavor. It was so delicious with the croquetas, so we ordered extra for our arepas. I ordered the Reina Pepiada Arepa, stuffed with a chicken and avocado salad mix. It was really good and I enjoyed the combination of the hot arepa, and cold chicken salad mix. The flavor of the avocado mixture and fresh shredded chicken was awesome. Kyle ordered the Los Muchachos Arepa, filled with grilled chorizo, spicy white cheese and  jalapenos and sauteed peppers. It was hard to choose one arepa because the menu is so creative and offers such a variety. Delicious and affordable, Caracas is a perfect for a post-work dinner spot, and even better if you make it before 7PM for their happy hour.",3.0
"This place was a huge let down.  We arrived for an early dinner on a Thursday night, they were not that busy.  However, the waitress kept rushing us.  It was nice to dine outside in the back courtyard.  We spent over $150 and yet she still was rushing us to order and get out of there.  This is the Brooklyn location, why the huge rush?  The Arepas were just ok, kind of dry.  I can get better ones in Bushwick for 1/3 of the price, even in a dine in atmosphere.  The best item that I ate there was the salad, and that was still small and overpriced.  I tried to order empanadas, but the waitress brought us more Arepas.There are no decent $5 drinks, as everyone states.  The drinks served in mason jars are about $10.  The only $5 drinks are served during happy hour and are juice with one shot in them.  Avoid the desserts, they are completely disgusting.  We had this one dessert that was seriously a disc of ice cream cone like cracker out of a bag with some canned leche on top.  Lame.",2.0

"Caracas is a brilliant business concept, especially for a neighborhood like Williamsburg. It is a bar, strategically located on bustling Grand Street, AND it's a restaurant, serving up foodcart-style fare which is cheap, very tasty, and FILLING (read: good drunk food).  The atmosphere is also very pleasant and attractive, with excellent service and a beautifully decorated garden area, making it a popular daytime lunch spot as well.  Add to all of this an amazing and delicious house hot sauce that is like liquid crack and IS for sale in bottles to take home (finally a place that gets it!), makes this a winning combination.  This is how to keep a business open and running during a tough economic climate.  I've been coming and ordering from here for years.Now, as far as the arepas go, very tasty, delicious, but could be made better if the arepa were traditionally fried instead of baking them, which causes the shell to be tougher on the outside than it should be.  The reason they do this is probably to keep the heftily-stuffed contents inside and intact, but it makes the arepa less flavorful.  However, the contents have so much flavor (albeit some have a kind of greasy goodness) as to make this forgivable.Hard to believe, but the best, most flavorful arepa on the menu is a vegetarian option; the La Del Gato (guyanés cheese, fried, sweet plantains and avocado).  Sweet, salty, soft goodness.  I like many of the other selections, but I have to fight myself to keep from ordering this one.We came here for a weekday lunch recently after trying to get seated in Dokebi and standing there way too long without a waitress in sight.  (Dokebi seems to have staffing issues) Caracas on the other hand was bustling, the friendly servers were there immediately to seat us and fixed us up with drinks right away.The recommendation for my Cocada coconut milk shake was to add rum to it, so I tried that and my girl was right on.  The coconut is not sickeningly sweet...it is just right, with a touch of cinnamon and the tummy warming rum (is it wrong to be craving a rum drink at 9:00 in the morning, as I'm writing this?).  Great summer drink.  My friend had the Camburada (banana milk shake, touch of cinnamon), and it was equally good.I can't speak for cross contamination here, but I'm going to say this is pretty safe for most of us Gluten Intolerant folk, and I'm going to add this review to my list.",4.0

"My husband and I have been going through arepa withdrawal since Cafe Habana in Royal Oak closed; fortunately NYC was able to satisfy the craving on a recent visit.  We stopped into Caracas on a Saturday night and took a seat at the bar with its myriad.  Crowded as it was, the bartenders kept us well-supplied with water, and it was fun to watch them mix drinks.  We had the yo-yos (delectable) followed by the La del Gato arepa (more plantains plus cheese and avocado) and I believe my husband got the Volvere arepa with peppers and chimichurri sauce.  We also had an assortment of drinks featuring the rum and cachaca that adorned the bar-- a gingery punch, and the Witch Doctor's Brew, and more.  It was all delicious, though I admit the multiple cocktails made for an expensive outing.  It was just a thoroughly enjoyable and pleasant dinner, and after the arepas were gone we had a palate-cleaning watercress salad that was good enough that I didn't miss dessert... much.Our only regret is we somehow missed the yellow sauce that everyone else is raving about.",5.0
"Whenever I tell someone that I don't like Caracas, they start to have a conniption. They react so strongly, in fact, that I am sure I had a fluke experience and resolve to go back and give it one more shot. This time, I think to myself, I will finally understand why people love this so much.And on a certain level I get it. Believe me, no one loves a deep fried corn dish like I do. But the reality is this: the service at Caracas Arepas Bar is so horrific that I cannot and will not overlook it for strictly mediocre food. Empty water glasses, extremely long waits to put in and receive your order or get your check, and the last four times I went to the Williamsburg location our server messed up the order every time.The arepas? They're just ok. More than once the arepa shell has been extremely overcooked and hard as a rock. The plantains are often not ripe enough. The grilled white cheese is obviously delicious -- it's an enormous slice of salty cheese. The vegetarian options are uninspired (I once sprang for the vegetarian arepa platter and was quite dismayed that one arepa contained only a scoop of guacamole). The menu of 'Sidekicks' are mostly battered and deep-fried, so that by the end of the meal you feel nearly comatose.Terrible service, okay food.

"My husband and I have been going through arepa withdrawal since Cafe Habana in Royal Oak closed; fortunately NYC was able to satisfy the craving on a recent visit.  We stopped into Caracas on a Saturday night and took a seat at the bar with its myriad.  Crowded as it was, the bartenders kept us well-supplied with water, and it was fun to watch them mix drinks.  We had the yo-yos (delectable) followed by the La del Gato arepa (more plantains plus cheese and avocado) and I believe my husband got the Volvere arepa with peppers and chimichurri sauce.  We also had an assortment of drinks featuring the rum and cachaca that adorned the bar-- a gingery punch, and the Witch Doctor's Brew, and more.  It was all delicious, though I admit the multiple cocktails made for an expensive outing.  It was just a thoroughly enjoyable and pleasant dinner, and after the arepas were gone we had a palate-cleaning watercress salad that was good enough that I didn't miss dessert... much.Our only regret is we somehow missed the yellow sauce that everyone else is raving about.",5.0
"Whenever I tell someone that I don't like Caracas, they start to have a conniption. They react so strongly, in fact, that I am sure I had a fluke experience and resolve to go back and give it one more shot. This time, I think to myself, I will finally understand why people love this so much.And on a certain level I get it. Believe me, no one loves a deep fried corn dish like I do. But the reality is this: the service at Caracas Arepas Bar is so horrific that I cannot and will not overlook it for strictly mediocre food. Empty water glasses, extremely long waits to put in and receive your order or get your check, and the last four times I went to the Williamsburg location our server messed up the order every time.The arepas? They're just ok. More than once the arepa shell has been extremely overcooked and hard as a rock. The plantains are often not ripe enough. The grilled white cheese is obviously delicious -- it's an enormous slice of salty cheese. The vegetarian options are uninspired (I once sprang for the vegetarian arepa platter and was quite dismayed that one arepa contained only a scoop of guacamole). The menu of 'Sidekicks' are mostly battered and deep-fried, so that by the end of the meal you feel nearly comatose.Terrible service, okay food. But if you really like rum drinks, it could be the place for you.",2.0
"Excellent experience both times I've been there. The first was over the summer and the outdoor seating is lovely ! My most recent experience, was on a Friday night, which was pretty busy. We were able to sit at The high top table. The decor is very appealing and welcoming. They serve the drinks in cute mugs, and the service is pretty good even when they're packed. I had a whiskey cocktail which was delicious and worth the $10, strong and well balanced. During happy hour they have a selection of beer for $3, add a shot of rum for $1 - great deal. For apps I would pass on the croquetas and head straight for the Tostones Mochimeros, they are crunchy and have a great topping. All of the arepas I've tried have been without fail, just delicious. Get La popular, it's a great way to share and try a few different arepas. La mulata is really great, it's like having a full meal of rice and beans in one bite with bold memorable flavors. Definitely go and indulge !!",5.0
"Update (3.18.13) - I came here a few weekends ago for brunch with my sisters. Definitely wasn't as impressed as I was with their dinner.  I think it was just a perfect storm of factors - the beef in my beef-and-cheese arepa was touch and chewy, my sister's plate of chicken and rice was bland and dry, and service was incredibly slow, even though it wasn't a full house.  The dinner experience I reference below was definitely better...---------I came here last weekend with my husband - it was 'date night'!  Couldn't have picked a more wonderful, lively, and delicious place for dinner.  First off, the service here is awesome.  Everyone is so incredibly friendly, even on a busy Saturday night, even in trendy Williamsburg.  We were seated pretty quickly (surprisingly, most people were in parties of 3+, so the two of us got seated quite fast!), and ordered the tostones mochimeros and the guac. to start.  The tostones, sprinkled with delicious cheese, were to die for, and the guac. with homemade chips was also amazing.  My husband and I shared three arepas for our main course, which was PLENTY.  Those things are quite filling!  All three were heavenly - so full of flavor and goodness!  We had two drinks each, all of which were fantastic, as well.  Our total bill seemed like nothing in the end, considering how much food we ate and what a great time we had - it's an amazing value.OH!  And huge bonus - if you're allergic to gluten like my husband, this place is your playground!  He could basically eat anything on the menu (minus a few things here or there - just make sure to ask your server - they are so helpful!).5+ Stars in my book.

The staff saw us sit down and I said excuse me several times, but I waited maybe 10 mins or more for the waiter to come over. 2.  We ordered a pitcher of rum punch during Happy Hour for $25. On the menu we noticed it said ""Endless Happy Hour"". We were all confused if that meant bottomless so when the waiter came to if we wanted refills we made sure to ask, ""Does this endless happy hour mean it's free?"" He said, ""Yes free""  twice so we ordered 4 pitchers since it was last call. Then, another female waitress came and brought two pitchers and again we mentioned it being free she said yes. Now when the bill comes there's a charge for all 4 pitchers. Long story short, the  manger spoke to our waiter and told us he said he didn't tell us that it was free and he didn't understand what we asked so he told the other girl to speak with us (which isn't true). Eventually, we got two of the pitchers taken off because my friends offered to pay for one (they are nicer than I). I was annoyed because she tried to say he wasn't our waiter when he took my friends order and when I came in later took mine as well. Then to say he couldn't understand us (he's Hispanic) when he clearly repeated everything we ordered clearly and in English. I'm not sure if I would go back.

"Had a great meal here Friday night with a group of four. It got off to a rocky start with the hostess, however, who really should take some tips on working with customers from our very friendly, lovely waitress. That said, once we were seated, great experience. Started with the Dark and Stormy cocktail (x 2 - so good!) and some Pork Slap Beer.We started with the guacamole and taro chips, and the Tajadas (fried, sweet plantains. with aged cheese). Perfect.  For arepas, we had La Mulata (vegetarian delight - spicy/salty, really terrific), Los Muchachos (rave reviews) and Pabellón Criollo platter (didn't get to try - it was inhaled. Always a good sign.).  Busy, fun place, beautiful garden.",4.0
"High expectations of this arepas joint... however, after an early dinner here at 6pm on a Saturday I just don't think I am a arepas kind of gal.Everyone orders the guac and chips.  It is on point.  Very good munchies (plantain/taro) to down with a margarita or hibiscus tea.  It's too bad they don't give you more guac tho -- I'd order this app with extra guac.  I thought the arepa shells were too dry, over fried and crispy.  It didn't blend well with the filling - but that's just me.  The dryness and blandness of the shell overpowered the meats and sauces that were inside... and that is probably not a good thing.  It was like eating a jewish Matzo with big pieces of beef/chicken/pork shoulder.  WAHH WAHHH.Overall it was ehhhhh...  Although my yelp due-diligence brought us here tonight, it will probably not bring me back again - or to any other arepas place.PS - There is NO AT&T iPhone service inside.",3.0
"I loooove love this place! And this location definitely beats the East Village locale by far - so much bigger and they have a garden which is pretty charming. We've been here several times in the past 2 months and have definitely figured out our favorites - De Pabellon, La Sureña, and the Vista al Mar. They also have this beer drink that my fiance loves (the Michelada) that he gets all the time. I'm not sure what it is but it seems the way to go as far as drinks are concerned, especially if you're a beer type of person.Only con for this place is that for what you get, it seems a bit too pricey. For 4 arepas and a beer, we normally spend about $60, incl tax and tip. I know that that's not that high of a bill, but for what we got, it has just FELT a lot.",4.0
"Boy I'm a sucker for a good Arepa. Caracas Arepa Bar takes it to the next level with their options and execution of the art of Arepas. I ofcourse had to have more than one!  The ""De Pabellon"" is an orgasm in your mouth just waiting to happen. Its basically taking all of your essential Pabellon ingredients (shredded beef, cheese, rice, beans, sweet plantain) and stuffing them in an arepa. After i scarfed that down i proceeded to the ""De Pollo"" which is their Chicken/Cheddar/Caramelized onions creation from the heavens. All of their arepas should be enjoyed with their fantastic special sauce. Though i will admit they may be a tiny bit too pricey for arepas, they are good in the end so you won't regret it.",4.0

"I keep coming back to Caracas in Williamsburg.  Every one of their vegetarian arepas are delicious, though I think the Volveré (with chimichurri sauce) and the del Gato (with the sweetness of plantains) may be my favorites.  The space, thankfully more spacious than the East Village location, isn't the most comfortable.  As for the service, while polite, can tend toward the inattentive side of things, especially when the place is busy.",4.0

"I used to really love this place until I realized how hit-or-miss they can really be.First off, some of their arepas are pretty good, but others are horribly bland or over the top greasy. Choose and choose wisely.Also, I've gone here about 4 times and each time I've ordered arepas, they just put them all in front of you with no explanation as to what each arepa is. I went with my vegetarian boyfriend and I had to test each one for him to make sure it wasn't one of mine with meat in it.They're not cheap. Expect a hefty bill for hit-or-miss food and shoddy service. And on top of that, expect a wait, this place is small and is almost always crowded.",2.0

"Had a great meal here Friday night with a group of four. It got off to a rocky start with the hostess, however, who really should take some tips on working with customers from our very friendly, lovely waitress. That said, once we were seated, great experience. Started with the Dark and Stormy cocktail (x 2 - so good!) and some Pork Slap Beer.We started with the guacamole and taro chips, and the Tajadas (fried, sweet plantains. with aged cheese). Perfect.  For arepas, we had La Mulata (vegetarian delight - spicy/salty, really terrific), Los Muchachos (rave reviews) and Pabellón Criollo platter (didn't get to try - it was inhaled. Always a good sign.).  Busy, fun place, beautiful garden.",4.0
"High expectations of this arepas joint... however, after an early dinner here at 6pm on a Saturday I just don't think I am a arepas kind of gal.Everyone orders the guac and chips.  It is on point.  Very good munchies (plantain/taro) to down with a margarita or hibiscus tea.  It's too bad they don't give you more guac tho -- I'd order this app with extra guac.  I thought the arepa shells were too dry, over fried and crispy.  It didn't blend well with the filling - but that's just me.  The dryness and blandness of the shell overpowered the meats and sauces that were inside... and that is probably not a good thing.  It was like eating a jewish Matzo with big pieces of beef/chicken/pork shoulder.  WAHH WAHHH.Overall it was ehhhhh...  Although my yelp due-diligence brought us here tonight, it will probably not bring me back again - or to any other arepas place.PS - There is NO AT&T iPhone service inside.",3.0
"I loooove love this place! And this location definitely beats the East Village locale by far - so much bigger and they have a garden which is pretty charming. We've been here several times in the past 2 months and have definitely figured out our favorites - De Pabellon, La Sureña, and the Vista al Mar. They also have this beer drink that my fiance loves (the Michelada) that he gets all the time. I'm not sure what it is but it seems the way to go as far as drinks are concerned, especially if you're a beer type of person.Only con for this place is that for what you get, it seems a bit too pricey. For 4 arepas and a beer, we normally spend about $60, incl tax and tip. I know that that's not that high of a bill, but for what we got, it has just FELT a lot.",4.0
"Boy I'm a sucker for a good Arepa. Caracas Arepa Bar takes it to the next level with their options and execution of the art of Arepas. I ofcourse had to have more than one!  The ""De Pabellon"" is an orgasm in your mouth just waiting to happen. Its basically taking all of your essential Pabellon ingredients (shredded beef, cheese, rice, beans, sweet plantain) and stuffing them in an arepa. After i scarfed that down i proceeded to the ""De Pollo"" which is their Chicken/Cheddar/Caramelized onions creation from the heavens. All of their arepas should be enjoyed with their fantastic special sauce. Though i will admit they may be a tiny bit too pricey for arepas, they are good in the end so you won't regret it.",4.0

"Caracas is a fine establishment. First thing to say about this place is the crack sauce. It is CRACK it took me two years to shake the addiction and I still can't help myself. Sometimes I relapse and find myself standing in front of their bar, eyeing the plastic squeeze bottle full of that orange saucy delight and wanting to douse my clothes in it and then suck my shirt tails on the bus ride home. But really, the sauce is ridiculously incredible, spicy and sweet and goes on everything in this place and suddenly you're spraying it on your new wife in front of your entire dinner party you invited there for your two month anniversary and she's loving it and you are too and it's the first time she smiles at you since the affair and...j/k. I apologize, I am prone to silly tangents of fiction, you see. Still, you get the idea.Seriously, food here is fantastic and sets the bar for arepas everywhere (at least at the other three places I've tried it!). It blows the Greenpoint joint out of the water (noting however that is a Colombian arepa and Caracas has as you might imagine,  Venezuelan arepas, unless you're not good at geography, in which case you did not imagine anything like that, and I think we'd like to all know what you DID imagine. Well? We're waiting.) Forgive me, another tangent. Back to Caracas, the arepas are all stellar. the vegetarian ones are just as magnificent in flavor as the meaty ones. I used to also get their dish with beef rice beans and plantains and it was sooo good. The tostones are like this divine plate appetizer of fried plantains with cheese and lime and you put the sauce on and afterward you call your dad and you're like, I forgive you for all that stuff you pulled when I was thirteen, with the rattlesnake and the tabasco and you realize it's Caracas' sauce that brought you to terms with everything. Thank you, Caracas. It gets packed so don't just show up for dinner at 7:30 and expect just sail right in (although sometimes we do and we do just that). I don't drink anymore after last passover (to be discussed perhaps another time) but my girlfriend says the drinks are excellent too. Hope this review helps!",5.0

"No, not the Masarepa crap you get at the street fairs. This is the more delicious, more flavorful, more stuffed arepa.It's like the perfect pocket of tender meat and veggie and cheese... I got the Arepa del Gato... cheese, avocado and fried plantains... so much fun in the mouth.The Yo-yos were good... somewhat sweet in an unexpected way... Which may cause you to absolutely love it, or absolutely hate it.Service was great.

"Caracas is a fine establishment. First thing to say about this place is the crack sauce. It is CRACK it took me two years to shake the addiction and I still can't help myself. Sometimes I relapse and find myself standing in front of their bar, eyeing the plastic squeeze bottle full of that orange saucy delight and wanting to douse my clothes in it and then suck my shirt tails on the bus ride home. But really, the sauce is ridiculously incredible, spicy and sweet and goes on everything in this place and suddenly you're spraying it on your new wife in front of your entire dinner party you invited there for your two month anniversary and she's loving it and you are too and it's the first time she smiles at you since the affair and...j/k. I apologize, I am prone to silly tangents of fiction, you see. Still, you get the idea.Seriously, food here is fantastic and sets the bar for arepas everywhere (at least at the other three places I've tried it!). It blows the Greenpoint joint out of the water (noting however that is a Colombian arepa and Caracas has as you might imagine,  Venezuelan arepas, unless you're not good at geography, in which case you did not imagine anything like that, and I think we'd like to all know what you DID imagine. Well? We're waiting.) Forgive me, another tangent. Back to Caracas, the arepas are all stellar. the vegetarian ones are just as magnificent in flavor as the meaty ones. I used to also get their dish with beef rice beans and plantains and it was sooo good. The tostones are like this divine plate appetizer of fried plantains with cheese and lime and you put the sauce on and afterward you call your dad and you're like, I forgive you for all that stuff you pulled when I was thirteen, with the rattlesnake and the tabasco and you realize it's Caracas' sauce that brought you to terms with everything. Thank you, Caracas. It gets packed so don't just show up for dinner at 7:30 and expect just sail right in (although sometimes we do and we do just that). I don't drink anymore after last passover (to be discussed perhaps another time) but my girlfriend says the drinks are excellent too. Hope this review helps!",5.0

He said, ""It's like James Brown did a high kick in your mouth.""I'm still not sure what that means, but after eating there, I think he was onto something.So flavorful. So unexpected. So crave-worthy.We ordered drinks: I got their version of the Caipirissima: rum, sparkling wine, passion fruit, some other stuff.... Pretty darn good!Because the light was so low, it was next to impossible to read the menu, we asked our waitress a few questions, then decided to order & split the Bolirepitas Con Nata (corn flour and white cheese rolled together, deep fried and served a side of nata) as well as the La Vegetariana (leek jardinera, la del gato and la de guasacaca).The Bolirepitas were very good. The nata (basically sour cream, although our waitress, with the language barrier, told us it was whipped cream - whipped sour cream, perhaps?) was really what made it stand out, though. Nice little balls of corn & cheese.Here were the three options in La Vegetariana (which is three sets of two arepas, aka corn pockets of tasty goodness):Leek Jardinera - Grilled leeks, sundried tomatoes, caramelized onions and guayanes cheese - This was our favorite, but interestingly, the one I thought I'd like the least. Nope. All sorts of flavor popping out atcha.La Del Gato - Guayanes cheese, fried sweet plantains and avocado slices - Like I said, we didn't really know what we were ordering, so I was pleasantly surprised to find the avocado slice at the bottom of the arepa. I only wish I could have gotten all of the flavors in one bite more often. Perhaps if the plantain was tucked inside instead of lying on top? Regardless, pretty darn good.La De Guasacaca - Guayanes cheese & guacamole - I'm assuming these are the only ingredients cuz they didn't list it on the menu or website. This was very good, but holy cow does the green stuff just squirt on out of the pocket. At one point, I had to quick napkin my face cuz I had an avocado Joker's grin. But the guac worked very well with the corn shell, regardless of how messy it was.Our waitress was a delight, our food came out wicked fast, & there were zero problems with seating, getting the check, etc. The only & I mean only thing that was slightly annoying was that some dude was interviewing & photographing the ladies next to us & just milling about in that space. He also looked at us as if to consider also interviewing us, then dismissed the idea, which ... hi ... kinda rude? But I'm assuming two things a) that's not a regular occurrence & b) that's not the restaurant's fault. So. Y'know.

Nice little balls of corn & cheese.Here were the three options in La Vegetariana (which is three sets of two arepas, aka corn pockets of tasty goodness):Leek Jardinera - Grilled leeks, sundried tomatoes, caramelized onions and guayanes cheese - This was our favorite, but interestingly, the one I thought I'd like the least. Nope. All sorts of flavor popping out atcha.La Del Gato - Guayanes cheese, fried sweet plantains and avocado slices - Like I said, we didn't really know what we were ordering, so I was pleasantly surprised to find the avocado slice at the bottom of the arepa. I only wish I could have gotten all of the flavors in one bite more often. Perhaps if the plantain was tucked inside instead of lying on top? Regardless, pretty darn good.La De Guasacaca - Guayanes cheese & guacamole - I'm assuming these are the only ingredients cuz they didn't list it on the menu or website. This was very good, but holy cow does the green stuff just squirt on out of the pocket. At one point, I had to quick napkin my face cuz I had an avocado Joker's grin. But the guac worked very well with the corn shell, regardless of how messy it was.Our waitress was a delight, our food came out wicked fast, & there were zero problems with seating, getting the check, etc. The only & I mean only thing that was slightly annoying was that some dude was interviewing & photographing the ladies next to us & just milling about in that space. He also looked at us as if to consider also interviewing us, then dismissed the idea, which ... hi ... kinda rude? But I'm assuming two things a) that's not a regular occurrence & b) that's not the restaurant's fault. So. Y'know. There.I had never had Venezuelan food prior to this to my knowledge, but yessir, yes ma'am ... I am definitely going back. Delicioso!",5.0
"The search for the greatest food in all of NYC is over.  I have found it here at Caracas!Seriously, the BEST MEAL OF MY LIFE.  And trust me, I've eaten out a lot in the past year in NYC.Went with my two best friends on a Saturday night, arrived at 10:30 pm.We were seated at the bar, but right after our server took the order, a table opened up and we were seated promptly.  The ambiance is very cozy (but not in a cramped way) and very representative of the gregariousness of the Williamsburg area (but not in a hipster, bad way).  Guac and chips: Guac is so creamy and savory and just awesome.  The chips are homemade and mixed in with plaintain chips which I adore.Ensalada Fresca: so good, i don't exactly remember what was in it, but it was freaking great.La Mulata (arepa): so so so savory and i just didn't want to stop eating it...go plaintains with little bits of jalapeno and black beans!All three of these dishes go so well together.  I""m vegetarian btw, and this place is super veg-friendly (e.g., they can substitute baked tofu for any meat and have many simply veg options).  For the meat-eaters, don't worry, they have chorizo, shredded beef etc., which my friends got.Live your life to the fullest--HURRY UP AND GO TO CARACAS!",5.0
"SOOOOOOOOO, I've been to the one in the East Vill. To be honest ... not a huge fan.  My friend and I were walkin in the burg and saw the new one, and saw that it was BYOB and we were like hells yes lets do this.  And thank gosh we did. It was great. The arepas were good, though we ordered diff ones and they tasted the same.  The BYOB is well , just lovely. I know how to pick good ones, and the Venezualan bartender... ADORABLE.Fun times.Ate at the bar too since it was so crowded.",4.0

I had no idea how filling an Arepa could be, and I probably should have gone without the chips and guacamole, but nevertheless I have no regrets! The food was delicious and I will definitely be returning for more! The only downside is the extremely small size of the tables which lead the wait staff to constantly interrupt your meal and conversation by attempting to take away dishes, at times, immediately after you've finished eating that particular plate of food. I even had a one member of the wait staff empty the remaining soda, inside my soda can, into my glass without even asking. Given the tight quarters, as well as small table, it was extremely intrusive to have someone's arm come across our table, while we were talking and eating.

"Believe it or not, snapping photos - while simultaneously trying to dodge the masses of men and women dressed-up as ""Ol' Saint Nick"" - quickly revved-up our appetites.  That's right, folks: Dara and I were in the midst of Santacon 2010, a city-wide pub crawl.  By accident, no doubt.  A very good one, at that.      After we made our way through the hysterical chaos, Dara and I walked over to Caracas Apepa Bar for lunch.The restaurant's interior space isn't frilly or fancy, but it does have one trait that most stuffy joints do not: a spacious outdoor patio.  Obviously, being mid-December, Dara and I were not going to dine al-fresco but, nonetheless, it gave me a good reason to return during the warmer months.After being seated at a cozy two-top overlooking the restaurant's outdoor patio, Dara and I were greeted by our stunningly-gorgeous, South American waitress.  Trust me, if you weren't in the mood for Venezuelan cuisine prior to seeing and hearing her speak in her deliriously-sexy, native tongue, then I can guaran-damn-tee you of her powers to quickly make the arepa out to be the most foodgasmic delicacy that you never cared to try.  Whew!Prior to perusing the lunch menu, I ordered a glass of CAB's (Caracas Arepa Bar) ""jugo naturale (natural fruit juice)"" of the day: guava/mango. It was thick, but not syrupy - flavorful and refreshing, but not overly sweet. I loved the fact that the juice was served in a mason jar!It took an unruly amount of time for Dara and I to finally come to a decision, in terms of what to order, food wise.  However, with the aid of our waitress, we ultimately chose to split two, rather hefty, plates.Yoyos: come on, with a name like ""yoyos,"" how can you not want to order them just to say that you did?  Hey, what did you have for lunch today?  ""I had yoyos.  Why, what did you have?""  Joking aside, yoyos are fried plantain ""balls"" that are stuffed with salty, stringy white cheese.  Without the accompanying maple syrup-like dipping sauce, I found the undressed yoyos to be rather bland in taste - as they were neither sweet nor, necessarily, savory.  Meh.      La Popular Curiara (a platter of three arepas, split in half): while I found the yoyos to be mediocre, at best - the arepas, on the other hand, were dynamite.  Here are the three versions that Dara and I chose to try: La de Pabellon an arepa stuffed with shredded beef, black beans, salty white cheese, and fried sweet plantainsLa Reina Pepiada an arepa stuffed with Venezuelan guacamole and shredded white-meat chickenLa Mulata an arepa stuffed with grilled with cheese, jalapenos, sauteed red peppers, fried sweet plantains, and black beansThe funny thing is this: of all three arepas, I actually enjoyed the chicken version the most.  Quite the shocking conclusion coming from the mouth of someone who isn't a huge fan of poultry.Needless to say, I found my experience at CAB to be positively unique, affordable, filling, and, most importantly, delicious. ~Read it & eat, The Lunch Belle",3.0
"Caracas East Village has always been one of my favorite places (who doesn't love a festive atmosphere and fun, eclectic Latin food?) but I have to say Caracas Williamsburg blows that place out of the water.  With a giant dining room and outdoor garden seating, plus tables that can seat large parties, this is the Caracas to go to.  The same menu, and their drinks are awesome too.  If you are up for a short train ride and want to sit in a much larger, more relaxed atmosphere with the same food, this place is worth the trip across the water. I can't speak for the weekends, but I visited with a few friends on a Thursday night around 7:30 and found it to be comfortably populated but no wait.  Plan your next arepa dinner here if you are tired of the long waits at Caracas East Village!  I will always love that tiny location for take-out arepas, but for a seated dinner I just can't go back there knowing that Caracas Williamsburg is just minutes away.  True, this place has the same ""relaxed"" service as Caracas East Village, so you can't go there in a big hurry, but it's still a lovely place and I'm hoping they will be faster with the service once they are open for a while.  Congratulations Caracas on expanding your arepa goodness!",4.0

I ordered the Pollo Arepa, with Tajada (sweet plantains) for appetizer. I had every intention of ordering dessert but there was just no room left in my stomach. I had no idea how filling an Arepa could be, and I probably should have gone without the chips and guacamole, but nevertheless I have no regrets! The food was delicious and I will definitely be returning for more! The only downside is the extremely small size of the tables which lead the wait staff to constantly interrupt your meal and conversation by attempting to take away dishes, at times, immediately after you've finished eating that particular plate of food. I even had a one member of the wait staff empty the remaining soda, inside my soda can, into my glass without even asking. Given the tight quarters, as well as small table, it was extremely intrusive to have someone's arm come across our table, while we were talking and eating. Aside from that, I was really pleased with the meal and look forward to trying something different the next time we visit.",4.0
"Believe it or not, snapping photos - while simultaneously trying to dodge the masses of men and women dressed-up as ""Ol' Saint Nick"" - quickly revved-up our appetites.  That's right, folks: Dara and I were in the midst of Santacon 2010, a city-wide pub crawl.  By accident, no doubt.  A very good one, at that.      After we made our way through the hysterical chaos, Dara and I walked over to Caracas Apepa Bar for lunch.The restaurant's interior space isn't frilly or fancy, but it does have one trait that most stuffy joints do not: a spacious outdoor patio.  Obviously, being mid-December, Dara and I were not going to dine al-fresco but, nonetheless, it gave me a good reason to return during the warmer months.After being seated at a cozy two-top overlooking the restaurant's outdoor patio, Dara and I were greeted by our stunningly-gorgeous, South American waitress.  Trust me, if you weren't in the mood for Venezuelan cuisine prior to seeing and hearing her speak in her deliriously-sexy, native tongue, then I can guaran-damn-tee you of her powers to quickly make the arepa out to be the most foodgasmic delicacy that you never cared to try.  Whew!Prior to perusing the lunch menu, I ordered a glass of CAB's (Caracas Arepa Bar) ""jugo naturale (natural fruit juice)"" of the day: guava/mango. It was thick, but not syrupy - flavorful and refreshing, but not overly sweet. I loved the fact that the juice was served in a mason jar!It took an unruly amount of time for Dara and I to finally come to a decision, in terms of what to order, food wise.  However, with the aid of our waitress, we ultimately chose to split two, rather hefty, plates.Yoyos: come on, with a name like ""yoyos,"" how can you not want to order them just to say that you did?  Hey, what did you have for lunch today?  ""I had yoyos.  Why, what did you have?""  Joking aside, yoyos are fried plantain ""balls"" that are stuffed with salty, stringy white cheese.  Without the accompanying maple syrup-like dipping sauce, I found the undressed yoyos to be rather bland in taste - as they were neither sweet nor, necessarily, savory.  Meh.      La Popular Curiara (a platter of three arepas, split in half): while I found the yoyos to be mediocre, at best - the arepas, on the other hand, were dynamite.  Here are the three versions that Dara and I chose to try: La de Pabellon an arepa stuffed with shredded beef, black beans, salty white cheese, and fried sweet plantainsLa Reina Pepiada an arepa stuffed with Venezuelan guacamole and shredded white-meat chickenLa Mulata an arepa stuffed with grilled with cheese, jalapenos, sauteed red peppers, fried sweet plantains, and black beansThe funny thing is this: of all three arepas, I actually enjoyed the chicken version the most.  Quite the shocking conclusion coming from the mouth of someone who isn't a huge fan of poultry.Needless to say, I found my experience at CAB to be positively unique, affordable, filling, and, most importantly, delicious. ~Read it & eat, The Lunch Belle",3.0
"Caracas East Village has always been one of my favorite places (who doesn't love a festive atmosphere and fun, eclectic Latin food?) but I have to say Caracas Williamsburg blows that place out of the water.  With a giant dining room and outdoor garden seating, plus tables that can seat large parties, this is the Caracas to go to.  The same menu, and their drinks are awesome too.  If you are up for a short train ride and want to sit in a much larger, more relaxed atmosphere with the same food, this place is worth the trip across the water. I can't speak for the weekends, but I visited with a few friends on a Thursday night around 7:30 and found it to be comfortably populated but no wait.  Plan your next arepa dinner here if you are tired of the long waits at Caracas East Village!  I will always love that tiny location for take-out arepas, but for a seated dinner I just can't go back there knowing that Caracas Williamsburg is just minutes away.  True, this place has the same ""relaxed"" service as Caracas East Village, so you can't go there in a big hurry, but it's still a lovely place and I'm hoping they will be faster with the service once they are open for a while.  Congratulations Caracas on expanding your arepa goodness!",4.0
"This is the best darn place in all of new york if you are looking for some filling, extremely tasty food, with a summery vibe and a little added spice of south america. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who asked. I dream about the arepas on most days, and also the plantains with queso fresco and this insane green sauce they have. I don't know what they put in these things, but lord, are they good. Theyre drinks are also excellent. you really cannot go wrong here.",5.0
"Sweet and delicious!I never really new what an arepa was until I had a Venezuelan one. I had the vegan cheese, avocado and maduros one. OMG! Fantabulous! This little gem transports you right to Venezuela. Everyone is so friendly. I took my parents and they loved it. Great fresh fruit juice and arepa portions are appropriate so you don't feel like you need a nap after!",5.0
"Came here for dinner tonight. My BF and got two arepas, the 'De Pabellon, (shredded beef, cheese, sweet plantains and cheese) and the 'La Surena' (chicken, chorizo, avocado and a garlicy sauce/chimchurri).  both were very good and very different. The beef was a lot wetter and messier and more reminiscent of something BBQ. The sweet plantains (maduros) were really great in the sandwich. The arepa itself was crunchy and held the fillings very well.  The chicken was also yummy. Not as wet but very flavorful.  We sat outside in the garden which was lovely.  Maybe a little too close to other tables considering the music is kind of low. But I liked that they were playing reggae as I was eating outdoors.Drink special - I had two off their Happy Hour menu... both were good; not stellar! But decent all around.  I'll be back to try some of the other menu items for sure!  I really do live the vibe of the place!",3.0
"I was originally drawn here thanks to Bobby Flay. I ordered the chips and guacamole, cocada shake and La Surena arepa. The guacamole is just alright- good to pick at but nothing to crave.

"Great food in a restaurant that is sadly run by one of the worst managers I have ever encountered in New York. Part of our order took over a half hour to arrive, with repeated inquiries to our waiter that were mostly ignored.

"I love me some arepas, but I dislike the wait. And sometimes, the service here is a bit off. The serving staff seems rushed most of the time, and the kitchen staff must be, too.

"Came here on a visit to NYC this past weekend. Absolutley loved this place!! The inside of the restuarant has a really cool vibe and deifnitley has that latin american flair to it.  They have an extensive drink menu - with really unique cocktails. I went for a caiparinha because I've never tried one. It was good but a friend got the cucumber infused drink and it was sooo delicious!We had a short wait on a friday night - 20 minutes.  We ended up getting one of the best tables in the restaurant! It was in the back almost in an enclosed porch type of room with dim lighting and just a cool ambience.  For an app we got the guac.  It was great and the chips were awesome too.  They had what seemed to be cheese baked in to them.  Everyone was really please with their arepas.  I got the arepa de pollo - chicken, carmelized onions, and oozing cheese. It was so good! A bit soggy but I think that made it even better - just messy!Absolutely loved Caracas! As a first timer in Brooklyn it was an amazing introduction to a great area of NYC.",5.0
"I had never had an arepa before in my life and now I am a convert. I worship the religion of arepas and if I could eat one every day, I would. Praise the lord of arepas!!!!My cousin took us here to show us around her neighborhood, and it reminded me a little bit of CA. It was a relaxed and raw space and it was nice after a long day of shopping. I didn't know what to expect and Caracas Arepa Bar definitely exceeded my expectations.I got the Papelon con limon but it was WAY too sweet. Better stick with the mango-flavored one they offer.  My cousin, friend, and I shared the ceviche and tostones mochimeros.Both were very fresh and delish! I couldn't get enough of the tostones - it was like a creative version of the piss-poor nachos I make at home, except with plantains and not Trader Joe's Tortilla Chips! I also got the La Batata Arepa - a special of the day and I couldn't tell you what was in it except for two types of Venezulan cheese and pork shoulder. It was like a better version of carnitas. I know I keep comparing to Mexican food but it's the only reference point I have! I couldnt't get enough. All of that delicious meat and cheese is stuffed inside a fluffy arepa and is to die for!I also got an Obleas as a dessert and it looks like a giant host with chocolate inside (if you're Catholic you get what this means). It is a not-too-sweet dessert but the wafer was a little too dry for me.But that doesn't matter! The arepas, tostones, ceviche...that all outweighed the supersweet drink and superdry dessert.

The service slows down a bit if it's crowded.  In that case, I highly recommend ordering a drink and the tostones mochimero appetizer (plantains with mojito mayo) and just enjoying the laid-back vibe.P.S.

I tried ""La Peluda"" the first time, and I've not been able to bring myself to switch my order since, even though they have quite the arepa selection. It's true what everyone says about the guacamole and plantain chips, you can't eat here without ordering them. The place is quaint and it gives a good vibe, while the prices are very reasonable. Like Captain Jack Sparrow, I'm coming back for the Rum, but not in a comical Walt-Disney-movie way but in a hold-my-hair-back-this-arepa-and-rum-didn't-mix-well way.",4.0
"Awesome vibe in this place, loved the waiter we had and the fact that they are so open to substitutions so we could mix and match our favorite bits of the arepas to me custom superArepas!I had a coconut milkshake thing that was totally boss, and my GF and I split the bean and beef empenada for a starter which I think we decided was our favorite bit. We also tried the fried cheese and plantain balls, which were pretty good but not incredible. We both got the pork shoulder and mango habanero salsa arepas and added in some guacamole and fried sweet plantains. Total heaven.The secret sauce totally makes everything even better.Oh and they deliver, so there's not excuse not to imbibe...",5.0
"Words can not express how much I love this restaurant. It is my special place away from home. I have always ordered the same thing, michelada, yoyo's & Los Muchachos...you can not go wrong if you follow my lead! Douse that sucker in the sauce on the table, it is sooo delicious. I bring all visiting friends here and we all dream about Caracas on a regular basis. The Brooklyn location is much easier to get a table and is much roomier, which is a total bonus for my recent move to the neighborhood.",5.0
"The most flavorful Arepas out there!! This Arepa Bar in BK is much bigger, roomier, and less crowded than the East Village one. Start with the Guasaca (prob misspelled) and Chips and I always go for the special Arepa of the day. If you're hungry get 2 arepas! Cheap good food! Can't go wrong! They also have a great variety of special mixed drinks! Give em a try! Service is good no complaints!",5.0

De Pabellón is so dangerously good - we ordered the Popular and then liked this so much we got another separate order. The meat is flavored and cooked perfectly... I LOVE arepas and if I had a much faster metabolism I'd be here several times a week - but trying to limit myself to once a month or so... I had to take a star away because the service wasn't that great - and I felt rushed. Also...the busboy took away my side of sour cream - so I asked for another and they charged me..I mean yeah it was only a dollar..but still.If it's nice out - sit in the charming garden. I'll be back...in approx 20 days or so.,4.0
"Love, love, love! I was first introduced to the original location of Caracas in Manhattan when I was in high school. It was close to my school and I'd go whenever I could for lunch. The food was always consistent and I say can still say it is from this second location! I moved to Williamsburg this past weekend and my mother, who loves Caracas as well, took me to lunch here today. This may be bad news for my figure because it's right around the corner for me, so I predict the staff, who are delightful by the way, will know me by name soon. The arepas are fantastic and just enough to fill you without feeling disgustingly stuffed. Today I had the lunch special that came with the corn chowder. Fantastic! There was white cheese sprinkled on top and little bits of bacon in it. Our waiter stated it was great for meat lovers because bacon makes everything better. I paired it with my all time favorite, the De Pabellón and we got the yoyos as a starter; I highly recommend them. Everything was delicious, as always. If you're looking for a great meal at a great price and a relaxing atmosphere, this is the place.",5.0
"My experience at caracas arepa bar was absolutely amazing. The service was awesome- my waiter was some hipster dude with dark hair in a mess, was super friendly always smiling- he was super busy and every time he came over to us he still was polite, friendly and helpful! But of course it wasn't completely the service that made this place good, it was the food too. My friend and I tried their shredded beef empanada that came out quick and was big enough to split as an appetizer. It was fried, which I wasn't a fan of, but it was still delicious. Now for the main course, I got the shredded beef and cheddar cheese arepa and my friend got the chicken with caramelized onions and cheese. My shredded beef with cheese was finger-licking delicious, I could have ate many more of those in one sitting but one definitely can fill a person up. They look small, but they're stuffed with generous amounts of meat. I enjoyed my experience at the Williamsburg location very much so. The outdoor seating was a pleasant surprise - it was spacious and a delight if you go on an evening when the weather is just right. The outdoor seating definitely fills up faster than the indoor seating.I will definitely recommend this place to friends and come back here more often, whenever the arepa craving ensues, which will be more so than often! :)",5.0
"I've been to the Brooklyn location although the East Village one is the original.  They share a menu, so you can get the same dishes at either location, and Brooklyn is more convenient for me and much easier to get a seat, as I hear the other location is always packed.  You may remember Caracas Arepa Bar from the arepa ""throwdown"" where they reigned supreme over Bobby Flay.  These flat, unleavened cornmeal patties generally derive from Venezuela and Colombia.  Caracas offers up Venezuelan-style arepas that are stuffed to create sandwiches.  Though they appear to be small, they are far more filling than they look.  I decided to start with some tostones topped with mojito mayo, lemon and crumbled white cheese.  It was a great starter and even a bit filling.  It would have been plenty to share.  I selected an arepa based on a friend's recommendation, the La De Pernil, which is filled with roasted pork shoulder, tomato slices, and a spicy mango sauce.  It was very good, extremely juicy, although the mango sauce wasn't quite as spicy as I imagined it to be.  They offer a spicy sauce on the table for you to add to your dishes, but I forgot about it until after I finished my meal, but then I tasted it anyway and it was good :) Next time for sure!  They have Happy Hour specials on drinks all week long from 4 to 7 pm, and I indulged in a $4 Pacifico with my meal.  My final tally was a mere $16.50 before tax and tip for a drink, an appetizer, and a tasty and authentic arepa.  Not bad for an impromptu trip to South America!",4.0

"Yum! This Brooklyn version of Caracas isn't too shabby. You can actually get a seat and waitress/waiter service which makes this place stand out against the NYC version.

The wait service was a little slow, but it was pretty packed, so I was forgiving. The arepa was yummy, the beans & rice were good (but the arepa is enough to fill you), but the Coke was a bit too warm (as was the water they give you at the table). Overall, a nice change of pace from the inundation of super hip (and mega crowded) restaurants on Bedford Avenue.",3.0
It's the greatest place to grab an arepa or empanada in New York. Thank God for the Brooklyn Locale.Both are hip and always packed out. The wait stinks but is well worth it. They just know how to marinate and cook meat. Fresh ingredients and care go into every arepa.Stupid good.,4.0
"Holy crapsticks, this place is great. I am a huge fan of starchy foods, so for me, arepas are a revelation. The brunch here is so delicious my human food hating cat would probably eat it. If you get drinks, it can end up being a little pricey, but it's worth it if you can afford it. It might be worth it if you can't afford it too. The rum selection is also impressive, at least to me, a non-rummy. God knows what the rum snobs would say. I've never met a rum snob in my life but I feel like they exist. This is Williamsburg, just name a noun and someone out there is a snob about it. I plan on ordering the rum flight just as soon as I get a second job. Truthfully, I'm not a rum superfan, and yet the rum flight calls to me. In conclusion: You eat at The Lodge EVERY weekend, put some pants on and try something different for a change.",5.0

Not so good. Overpriced an arepa is just flour and water. I think the arepa truck on Roosevelt Ave and 78th makes it better.,1.0
"Went here on a Friday night before hitting up the bars.  Was promptly sat and given water.  We ordered some drinks, banana chips and a cheese stuff plantain for appetizers.  Both were tasty; the drinks were solid too.  Next, we obviously ordered the arepas.  I ordered the La Surena, it was OK but the flavors didn't go together well.  My wife ordered the guacamole and cheese and her friend ordered the Pabellon.  The Pabellon was the best by far.  My wife's was good as well.This is the perfect pre-going out place but the servings could have been larger.  The waitress wasn't very friendly though.I prefer Arepas Cafe in Astoria.  I'll probably return.",3.0
"Yum! This Brooklyn version of Caracas isn't too shabby. You can actually get a seat and waitress/waiter service which makes this place stand out against the NYC version. I got my usual La Pelua arepa along with a Coke and a side of rice and beans. The place itself was crowded on a Saturday night, but like I said, we were able to get a table, so I can't complain. The wait service was a little slow, but it was pretty packed, so I was forgiving. The arepa was yummy, the beans & rice were good (but the arepa is enough to fill you), but the Coke was a bit too warm (as was the water they give you at the table). Overall, a nice change of pace from the inundation of super hip (and mega crowded) restaurants on Bedford Avenue.",3.0
It's the greatest place to grab an arepa or empanada in New York. Thank God for the Brooklyn Locale.Both are hip and always packed out. The wait stinks but is well worth it. They just know how to marinate and cook meat. Fresh ingredients and care go into every arepa.Stupid good.,4.0
"Holy crapsticks, this place is great. I am a huge fan of starchy foods, so for me, arepas are a revelation. The brunch here is so delicious my human food hating cat would probably eat it. If you get drinks, it can end up being a little pricey, but it's worth it if you can afford it. It might be worth it if you can't afford it too. The rum selection is also impressive, at least to me, a non-rummy. God knows what the rum snobs would say. I've never met a rum snob in my life but I feel like they exist. This is Williamsburg, just name a noun and someone out there is a snob about it. I plan on ordering the rum flight just as soon as I get a second job. Truthfully, I'm not a rum superfan, and yet the rum flight calls to me. In conclusion: You eat at The Lodge EVERY weekend, put some pants on and try something different for a change.",5.0
"Arepa abuse I've been known from time to time to over indulge, but whose counting.  I use to squeeze into the Caracas in the East Village, but this one is nice and roomy and not almost standing room only.  The arepas are up to par, they have a pretty decent variety, they serve alcohol and the waitstaff is really chill.  I like it ""Booze n Food I'm that Dude"", so I say check it out they have an arepa for everyone.",4.0
"Everything I loved about Caracas in the East Village was copy and pasted to Williamsburg.  Caracas is one of those places that really stands out as unique and exceptional in my book.  The food is so interesting, tasty, and unlike anything else.  I've abandoned the East Village location only because this one is closer to my home and less busy than the original.This location also boasts Roneria, specializing in rums from the Americas and Caribbean.  (which is a fantastic bar, if you ask me!)Really though, I think Caracas is a great place for anyone and everyone.  (I took my ketchup, meat, and potatoes stepdad here and he loved it!)",5.0

"so- what the hell is an AREPA? well, an arepa is a flat cornmeal patty which is grilled, baked, or fried. arepas are most popular in Colombia and Venezuela. i've been coming here for a while to get my arepa fix. it's in Williamsburg and convenient to where i spend most my nights...however, what the hell is the matter with this place?! i've been recommending everyone to haul their ass to BK for arepas. mainly because the Manhattan location is over-crowded and completely a pain in the arse to wait for a table. the BK location... airy, al fresco dining area, roomy booths and tables and you don't feel like a sardine packed into a can. the wait is no longer than 5-10 minutes on a busy evening on a weekend. yet they STILL manage to f*ck it up somehow. every time i'm here... the service is discombobulated. seriously. the host/server takes your order. then someone else takes your drink orders. then someone brings you a salad... and then you wait for your arepa for an HOUR and the host/server who originally took your order has vanished. WTF?? the staff is smokin' way too much... they don't even remember which tables belongs to who. the food... delicious. there are some standouts, but anything with Chorizo is my arepa pick. my other favorites include: Yo Yo's- deep fried balls of sweet plantain stuffed with white cheese (which i absolutely recommend), Guasacaca (Guacamole) w/ Plantain & Taro Chips and mind-blowing Marquesa de Chocolate- layers of thick chocolate mousse and ""Maria"" cookies (is my fav!!!). why the four stars? the manhattan location may be uncomfortable, over-hyped and crowded... but their food is outstanding and comes out swiftly! however, i can't hate on the BK location so much... it's definitely a great place to take a date too- with it's low/sexy lighting, al fresco (outdoor seating) dining and low-key (much quiet) set up.",4.0

"Came in here tonight with a couple of my homies and had a really good time. I started with the sweet plantains which were ok. You really can't mess these up..you make 'em one way and that's that. I wound up ordering the ""Muchachos"" arepas which come loaded with Chorizo and jalapenos...These were pretty awesome. Very tasty without being over the top spicy or hot. Very nice balance of spice and flavor. We loved them so much we ordered a second round. Topped it off with some creamy chocolate mousse and called it a night. With 3 beers and 5 margaritas, the bill came out to 100 bucks. A little expensive for arepas but the chill atmosphere and friendly staff made it worthwhile.",4.0

"I gave the restaurant 2 stars, not because the food is bad, the food is great, but because the service is really poor.I've been coming to this restaurant for years. First I used to frequent the one in the Village, then I discovered they had opened this spot in Williamsburg. For quite some time I would come here with family and friends and enjoy some great food accompanied by some wonderful service.  But, unlike a fine wine, this place has not gotten better with time.On my last visit, on Mother's Day, I took my family out to eat here--we were a group of 13. When we arrived, we were told that they usually didn't take groups this large but they would make an exception. We waited a good 30-min before we were seated. We gave our orders and waited another 15-min for the appetizers to arrive--and not all at the same time. I had ordered some chips with guacamole, realizing that it wouldn't be enough for the group I promptly asked the waiter for another order. 15-min and two separate inquiries about the status of said chips and we were still waiting. Our arepas began arriving, again, not at the same time, and the chips were still missing in action. On my third inquiry to the waiter, he had the nerve to say to me that they were still making the chips, meanwhile the tables next to ours were all receiving chips. This infuriated me and help set the tone for the rest of my evening. It was only after I started eating my meal that the chips finally arrived and I just sent them right back. To make matters worse, the waiter got our orders mixed-up. Some of us didn't receive all the entries we had requested, myself included, and had to wait another 10-min to have it delivered--and this is only after we were able to flag the waiter back to the table because he rarely visited to check on us.I was so amazed by how little attention the waiter offered us especially when I noticed him really engaged with the other patrons. Then the check came and it all made sense--the restaurant included a hefty 20% gratuity on the cost of the meal.

"OMG... This place is delicious. First thing I loved was the atmosphere... We sat outside and I felt like I was in on vacation as soon as I walked in. I loved the decorations and sitting arrangements, it was small but very cozy. I tried just about every arepa they had, it was many of us and we shared. La surena was my favorite; All of the arepas were great in taste, however they were not as big as our appetite. The portions were a bit on the small side and left us wanting for more. I also tried the natural juices they had... ALL OF THEM. After having 2 and seeing how delicious they were, we couldn't help but to order the rest of them. As far as desert goes, the coconut tres leches did not impress me much and therefore I wouldn't recomend this spot as your desert stop. The staff was also very nice, however not too attentive.

"Far superior to the East Village original. Make sure to try the Arepa de Pernil! Spicy sauce mixed in with pork shoulder on a handmade corn patty.We sat in the garden on faux-milk crates. Tables have cute little flowers in empty bean cans, and the atmosphere feels relaxed.Chicken avocado soup was amazing. Fresh, wonderful avocado slices with potato and shredded chicken in perfectly salted broth. Lovely guac.I didn't expect the arepa itself to be so crispy- my mind had envisioned a pancake-like sponge. Much more crispy, with cooked cornmeal on the inside. Yum!",5.0
"Tasty,I'm not a big fan of Venezuelan food, and I've visited Venezuela.This place is very good though,reasonable prices, but if you are super hungry it might get more expensive.The sauce it's great, not spicy just a bit tangy.But yeah worth going to every now and then.They play Soda Estero a lot haha",4.0

"cheap, quick, easy!came here for lunch with a group while on a shoot. everything was great! I recommend the croquetas. chorizo is the owner of my soul and it is great when rolled into a ball of potato and deep fried.the yo-yos (I believe that's what they were called) are fried plantains with cheese and syrup to dip in. it tasted like the most delicious French toast I've ever had. it wasn't French toast at all, but the tastes are French toast-y.  the arepa I got was a vegetarian one and I got (more) chorizo added. why not! it was so gaddamn good. the lentil soup was super dense and filling but delicious. just a warning. everything was fresh, yummy, cheap, good for groups, and completely customizable. next time I'm getting the deep-fried cheese.",5.0
"Holy. [insert deity here].Just as fabulously tasty and amazing as the Manhattan location, sans 1.5 hour wait.  Plus much more space AND a byob.La Surena is quite possibly one of the tastiest Latin American things I've ever had--a spicy kick with the holy trinity of chicken, chorizo, and avocado.  I would happily give up dessert AND appetizers just to stuff two of these into my face.  Okay, well maybe I'd save enough space to get their amazing guacamole and chips....",5.0

"This is one of those places that makes me love having guests from out of town or from out of the area.  As far as Brooklyn lunch goes, whenever I have family or friends here for just a few days this place is a sure hit.  I've had plenty of arepas in the past and never have been too crazy about them.  The standard is elevated here!  Everyone that I have taken here loves it and are happy to have had something new.There are about 15 or 20 or so different kinds, with maybe 6 that are vegetarian, plus the option to replace the meat in most with a substitute.  I've finally tried all of the naturally veg ones, and I'm ready to start on the others.  Oh, the guacamole is some of the best I've had.  The yoyos are real tasty with that good yellow sauce they give you.Oh, you know what, forget writing the rest of this review!  Now I'm hungry.  I'm getting on the train and heading over!",5.0
"I gave the restaurant 2 stars, not because the food is bad, the food is great, but because the service is really poor.I've been coming to this restaurant for years. First I used to frequent the one in the Village, then I discovered they had opened this spot in Williamsburg. For quite some time I would come here with family and friends and enjoy some great food accompanied by some wonderful service.  But, unlike a fine wine, this place has not gotten better with time.On my last visit, on Mother's Day, I took my family out to eat here--we were a group of 13. When we arrived, we were told that they usually didn't take groups this large but they would make an exception. We waited a good 30-min before we were seated. We gave our orders and waited another 15-min for the appetizers to arrive--and not all at the same time. I had ordered some chips with guacamole, realizing that it wouldn't be enough for the group I promptly asked the waiter for another order. 15-min and two separate inquiries about the status of said chips and we were still waiting. Our arepas began arriving, again, not at the same time, and the chips were still missing in action. On my third inquiry to the waiter, he had the nerve to say to me that they were still making the chips, meanwhile the tables next to ours were all receiving chips. This infuriated me and help set the tone for the rest of my evening. It was only after I started eating my meal that the chips finally arrived and I just sent them right back. To make matters worse, the waiter got our orders mixed-up. Some of us didn't receive all the entries we had requested, myself included, and had to wait another 10-min to have it delivered--and this is only after we were able to flag the waiter back to the table because he rarely visited to check on us.I was so amazed by how little attention the waiter offered us especially when I noticed him really engaged with the other patrons. Then the check came and it all made sense--the restaurant included a hefty 20% gratuity on the cost of the meal. When I asked the waiter why they were being so gratuitous with themselves, he simply remarked about their policy for group dining. For me that was the last straw. Of course he didn't care about our satisfaction, he was getting his 20% regardless.

I went here years ago when my brothering was going to school at NYU and had me out to visit. He and his friends went on about a tiny little spot that made delicious deep fried cheese treats. As a HUGE CHEESE LOVER I was easily sold on the trip.If you have never heard of or had an Arepa get down to the hole-in-the wall and give Arepas a try. There are many different styles and flavors so almost everyone can find something to their taste.These grubbies are no joke delicous folks.,5.0
"Considering this is my first time venturing into Williamsburg, I didnt know what to expect. Regardless, im glad i made the trip because this place was fabulous. Luckily there was no wait time when we went. I ordered the chips and guacamole, their special rum punch and 4 -5 arepas. The arepas were tasty and the food came out in a timely matter.

"After reading the reviews on Yelp, I decided to drag my bf all the way to Brooklyn to try these Arepas. We went there on a Sunday afternoon and the place was pretty empty so the service was quick. We ordered the guacamole and sweet plantains to start off, they were both good but not really great. I then had the Arepa stuffed with beef, beans, and plantains and this was again good not great. But it was all very filling, I was stuffed. My bf ordered a chicken and avocado Arepa that was surprisingly spicy but not tasty. He also ordered the fish Arepa which I tried and thought it was pretty bad. Overall, I liked the decor of the place and that everything is so eco friendly. We sat in the garden and it felt very tranquil plus the weather was great which really helped. I don't think I will be returning to this place since I was not impressed by the food.",3.0

"The food had its highs and lows, but the service was unacceptably slow and the music was way too loud and awful 70s disco cheese. I just didn't enjoy myself here.

The main problem here is they have made the Arepas into gringo versions of their former glory.  They bake the bread rather than the traditional frying, and the arepas just taste way too bland because of it. The filling inside the sandwiches were fun and flavorful, but it felt like eating a rice cake sandwich or something. The bread has ZERO flavor. Just bizarre...I can understand not frying the bread for health concerns, but at least add some seasoning or SOMETHING to the bread, so bland! Oye...But...the place was PACKED, so people must dig the flavorless arepas! Also, the wine was 8 bucks for cheap white wine in a small tumbler glass...",2.0
"I don't get the hype. For a place that prides itself in its arepas they did a really poor job impressing me. In fact, I'd say that the arepas were by far the least delicious part of our meal. We started with some sidekicks: The Guasacaca, Venezuelan style guacamole served with a basket of Taro root and Platano chips. We also ordered the tostones mochimeros, which are fried green tostones topped with lemony ""mojito mayo"" and covered in white cheese. The tostones were awesome, but the guasacaca to chips ratio was messed up. We finished the stuff and were left with 3/4 of a basket of chips. For our main dish I ordered the La Surena arepa, filled with chorizo, chicken, avocado and chimichurri sauce. I generally adore chimichurri but this was definitely an exception to the rule. The sauce completely overwhelmed the flavor of the meat and avocado and made for a boring munch. He ordered the seafood soup and raved about it. I'm not a big fan of some of the components (i loaaathe squid) so I passed on tasting it. It was a thick, chowdery soup with potatoes and corn and it smelled delicious. In addition to the soup he ordered the special ""Mattress Breaker"" arepa, which was loaded with seafood. He tasted mine and announced it was better. I think that we may have ordered the wrong things, so I am definitely willing to give the place another try. FYI: The establishment is waiting for its liquor license so I advise that you take advantage and bring your choice of beer or wine while you still can! I'm sure that once they get the license they will have some delicious latin inspired beverages. FYI 2: They only accept reservations for parties of 6 or more.",3.0

It's usually filled with some soft melted mild cheese.  I came here for a late night bite 2 Sunday nights ago.  Had ordered a couple of rums, and 3 arepas.  We got 2 of the 3 I ordered, I didn't complain though, cuz once I ate the others, I didn't really want to eat it.  We ordered La de Pernil, La Surena, and the special arepa.  the special never arrived. the pork in the Pernil was really really good, except this soft braised pork product is nestled between two layers of something that holds bricks together.  It wasn't that soft supple corn taste that I love about arepas.

"When my friend told me we were going to Caracas Arepa Bar I was both excited and nervous.  I love trying new food, but with special dietary needs (no meat/dairy), I had no idea if there would be many options for me on the menu.The place itself is adorable.  There were no tables available when we arrived, so we had a short drink at the bar before we were seated at an outside table on the patio.  The patio is super cute and inviting.  I could have sat out there for hours.We ordered fried plantains (cheese on the side for my friend) as an appetizer.  Yum.  I decided to order an arepa while my friend ordered both an arepa and an empanada.  I got the jardina which is suppose to have grilled eggplant, sundried tomatoes, caramelized onions, and cheese.  The menu says that they will substitute any meat with grilled tofu.  When I asked the waiter if I could substitute the cheese with tofu, he was happy to accommodate my order.  And the food was DELICIOUS.The only down side to our experience was that my friend's empanadas never arrived.  No problem since we were already full.",4.0

Overall I like it.  Kinda pricey for what you get but I would go back for the arepas and relaxing atmosphere.  Service was OK.",4.0

"My friend suggested this place for dinner and after glancing at the website I was impressed and had to eat there.  The Venezuelan cuisine was very impressive.  However, I would have been better served by being more informed about the menu.  The food was amazing, we just ordered way too much of it.The place is decorated like it was still under construction with unfinished plywood walls and no bar.  Seriously, community boards suck.  We luckily got a seat in the back garden where the décor wasn't go oppressive.Between four people we ordered five arepas, three sides, two soups and a combination plate. OMG.  We could hardly eat half of it.  The arepas were deceivingly big and filling.  So my suggestion is to order only two and nothing else.I had the special arepa for the night with pork shoulder, jalapenos, cheese, and fried plantains. Amazing.  The thing was crunchy and sweet and salty and just plain awesome.  I also ordered the soup special for the day which was basically a Venezuelan take on chicken soup with avocado in it.  It was very tasty but perhaps a bit under seasoned.  The Reina Pepiada was a little underwhelming: chicken and avocado salad.  I also ordered the yoyos (fried plantains with cheese in a molasses sauce) and rice and beans for the table.  Those two sides got eaten up but it was a little harder to tuck away the rest of the food.The waitress should have warned us that we were kind of over ordering.  I know this goes against their rules of squeezing the most out of customers but it would have been helpful and probably secured a second visit from us.",3.0

"Squash soup was fantastic, the arepas were good and something unique to the area we are from.",3.0
"Four people in our party.  We ordered the La Silvestre salad and Yoyos for appetizers. Both of it was just ok, but the yoyos was kinda small.  Took a while for these appetizers and after eating them, we decided we needed more food so we ordered the chips and guacamole.  That was pretty good in taste and in portion.  The ""chips' are actually taro chips.  When the food came, we thought we didn't order enough but the arepas are really dense.  I ordered the Curiaras la Carne, which is 3 meat arepas.  I enjoyed it.  My wife ordered 2 separate arepas and we could not finish.  Took 1 home.  Our dining mates ordered Curiaras la Popular and a Pabellon Criollo AND another arepa.  Yes, we thought it we were really hungry and underestimated the arepas.  Don't do what we did.  We got the chocolate dessert, pretty good. Overall I like it.  Kinda pricey for what you get but I would go back for the arepas and relaxing atmosphere.  Service was OK.",4.0
"Holy Goodness!   Biked over with a friend to the dreaded Williamsburg hood to try this place and it was worth the ride.  The Pabellon arepa is OUT OF THIS WORLD good!  Hibiscus tea and cold pressed coffee washed everything down nicely.  The arepas are PACKED to the hilt so you and your companion/s should order different items and share share share!!!  Just don't forget to use the highly addictive green sauce on the table.  Should call it cracksauce because you want to put it on EVERYTHTING.The atmosphere is chill, authentic and unpretentious (hard to come by in this area)",4.0
"My friend suggested this place for dinner and after glancing at the website I was impressed and had to eat there.  The Venezuelan cuisine was very impressive.  However, I would have been better served by being more informed about the menu.  The food was amazing, we just ordered way too much of it.The place is decorated like it was still under construction with unfinished plywood walls and no bar.  Seriously, community boards suck.  We luckily got a seat in the back garden where the décor wasn't go oppressive.Between four people we ordered five arepas, three sides, two soups and a combination plate. OMG.  We could hardly eat half of it.  The arepas were deceivingly big and filling.  So my suggestion is to order only two and nothing else.I had the special arepa for the night with pork shoulder, jalapenos, cheese, and fried plantains. Amazing.  The thing was crunchy and sweet and salty and just plain awesome.  I also ordered the soup special for the day which was basically a Venezuelan take on chicken soup with avocado in it.  It was very tasty but perhaps a bit under seasoned.  The Reina Pepiada was a little underwhelming: chicken and avocado salad.  I also ordered the yoyos (fried plantains with cheese in a molasses sauce) and rice and beans for the table.  Those two sides got eaten up but it was a little harder to tuck away the rest of the food.The waitress should have warned us that we were kind of over ordering.  I know this goes against their rules of squeezing the most out of customers but it would have been helpful and probably secured a second visit from us.",3.0
Hot and delicious. I've never been disappointed. This is very authentic.,4.0
"I had the unusual (for me, anyhow) experience of both having my first arepa and eating at two different arepa places in one week. As a first timer, I didn't quite know what to expect. I thought pictures of arepas looked small, not satisfying. At Caracas Arepa Bar, my friends and I (four of us) waited a full hour for our table. Fortunately, we were fine, but hungry, at the bar. When our table was finally ready, we were seated in a cute little corner--we basically had a private room, which was really quite nice. The music was good, too. Because we'd waited so long, the waitress brought us a complementary appetizer, as they should!, and it was really good! I think it was fried plantain chips with oaxaca cheese on top and some sort of sauce. To be honest, it was relatively dark in our corner--not much light, and so I couldn't actually see much of what I was eating. Before we'd been seated, I noticed that the arepas coming out of the kitchen looked kinda small and, having waited an hour, I was famished! Now, although I do tend to nosh all day, I am not a big meal eater. I ordered two arepas, and just managed to finish the first one! No worries, my dining companions were able to help out with the second. The arepa I DID manage to finish was amazing! It was the pabellon one, with rich, perfectly cooked skirt steak, plantains, black beans, and white cheese. The flavors went together really well and I thought Caracas executed the dish perfectly. True, we had to wait a long while, but the food made up for the wait. Plus, at $7-8 for an arepa, it's a pretty good deal. Next time I won't go on a Saturday night with three others.*2 nights later, I went to Arepa Arepa. It was terrific, also, I have to say. Much more low key, laid back, more coffee shop/cafe style than trendy restaurant as Caracas, but good at what they do. In terms of food, they're both pretty tasty, and Arepa Arepa is a bit cheaper.",4.0

"Last night I tried arepas for the first time, then went home and dreamt of them.  Seriously.We tried four different arepas:  La Surena, La de Pernil, Reina Pepiada, and the Asado Negro off of the specials menu.  So, so good.  The vaguely arepa-like things I had eaten in the past couldn't compare.  I hadn't expected the fluffy tortilla to be so crunchy and that made the meal.  The fillings were tasty and tender and well-matched.  They look like they're set up to offer alcohol in the future but haven't gotten the license yet.  Service was friendly, professional, and speedy.I initially thought the decor was a trying a bit too hard to seem rough-hewn.  Then it was pointed out to me that the plywood and the tin ceiling were probably an attempt to recreate the appearance of a Venezulean arepas shack.  Taken in that context, it works.Portions are modest and prices aren't particularly cheap for a take-out joint.  The quality of the food absolutely justifies this, but it cuts down on arepas-as-drunk-food potential.  If you go to Caracas, plan to savour your meal.  If you're trying to sober up after a show and some bar-hopping, you're better off grabbing a slice from Anna Maria's and saving Caracas for some time when you can enjoy it.",4.0

"My food editor recommended the East Village location to me over the summer, and I was immediately addicted. I could not be happier that the new Brooklyn location is a short 5-minute walk from my apartment. This location has much more seating (I've waited at the Manhattan location for 45 minutes) and an authentic, artsy South American vibe. And since the new location has yet to receive its liquor license, it's BYOB without a charge. But, the sangria is a must-have once they can serve it. I always order one of the appetizers on the menu, most recently the Yoyos, fried sweet plantain balls stuffed with cheese: delish. For the entree, my boyfriend and I both ordered the special shredded pork arepa plate, but every arepa and empanada that I have had is savory, tender goodness. The ensalada mixta is also fantastic: a simple, fresh bed of greens with avocado, hearts of palm, and finely shredded carrots with a light balsamic.Of course, this Venezuelan cuisine would not be complete without the restaurant's special orange sauce, a mysterious -- we even tried to pry the recipe from the manager! -- blend of hot peppers, vinegar, and maybe mango because it has a sweet tang to it.

For an arepa, the prices are a bit steep, but it's more convenient for me than trekking it out to Queens.",4.0
"Simply delicious. The service is a bit slow, but who cares - the food is worth the wait. The drinks are ... unusual? I got a mojito and it tasted different from any I've ever had. Very good, but no sugar (which I actualy liked). The arepas were just great. As a vegetarian I'm generally not very catered-to at South American places, so Caracas' offer to substitute anything with baked tofu was really refreshing.The only reason this is not 3-stars is the slow service (for which we should have received some comp.). And the fact that we almost got someone else's order.One thing - I've never had arepa pockets, only the flat kind akin to a thick corn tortilla. It's a pretty clever idea :)",3.0
"Absolutely AWFUL. We got there around 9:30 on a Saturday night. It was packed but there wasn't a wait time. We actually sat down next to the computer where the food staff put orders in/process payment etc etc. It took 20 after we sat down for our order to be taken. We ordered some appetizers and a pitcher of sangria. It was the worst sangria I have ever tasted. Did I mention there was loud pumping techno music being played. I have been to the Caracas in the city which is smaller and more crowded and the service, drinks, and food were 100x better then this. So we got our first round of appetizers somewhat quickly which shouldn't be a shock it was just chips and gaucamole. Our next set took a while but it came out. All of us (group of 4) ordered 2 sets of Arepas. The order was put in at 9:50. We didnt get our food til after 10:30. by then it wasn't as crowded anymore and we just could not figure out what was going on. I ordered the A8 I believe which was the shredded beef. It was very good. I have no complaints about that dish. The 2nd arepa I ordered was the A18 which was the shredded pork with the spicy mango. It was *bleeping* AWFUL. No seasoning and it was a huge block of pork shoulder set between two very over cooked arepas buns. I couldn't even eat it. Let me just state again we were sitting right next to the computer where orders were put in and where payments were processed. All the waiters including the one for our table went by us at least 40 times the whole time we were there. We had to ask random waiters about our food. About our water. About our drinks. Its a shame cause I really liked the one in the city. The one in BK should be avoided at all cost. HORRIBLE.",1.0

"Shares an order of the tostones with cheese and I'm glad that filled me up b/c the De Pabellon arepa was eh. The meat was kind of oily, kind of bland and the arepa tasted stale. I wanted to love this place after hearing so many great things about it.",2.0
"So delicious, but I went in with no expectations.  I had the A15 arepa -- stuffed with chorizo, jalapenos and a spicy white cheese -- and split some chips/guac and tostones with my lady friend.  We were thoroughly satisfied when we rolled out, but only after we had the flan.Hands down, the best flan I've ever had.  The caramelized sauce on the top had a subtle molasses flavor, and the flan's texture wasn't slippery but a little on the fluffy side.  Personally, I don't like slick desserts too much, jell-o included.They'll take their time on getting you the check and change, but it's in a respectful have-your-conversation-and-chill-out sort of way, not a we're-ignoring-you sort of way.",5.0

"The food is messy and hard to eat. There is a lot of juice in the filling but that makes the arepa soggy. I think there are better places. The chips and guac is great. Yam chips are sooo good, you really can't just have one.",3.0

"Eat their food immediately! (but ask for instructions)Delivery reviews scared me but I thought I'd take the risk based on a friend's great review. I called to confirm they take credit cards but was told only for dining in and not for delivery. I honestly find that to be absurd. Thankfully I had cash and the food came in 30 minutes. Everything was delicious and I will definitely order from them again. We ordered La Surena, La de Pernil, Yoyos and Quesillo. If you're not a total food nerd with an album on Facebook for your Food Porn, stop reading here and place your order. I would have preferred the chicken and chorizo to have been chopped smaller and mixed a bit to avoid getting all the chorizo first few bites. The roast pork shoulder was simply delicious pork and onion flavors which is fine, but I was wanting more depth since the description said spicy mango sauce. There was a small side of a yellow-orange sauce and I assumed it was the spicy mango sauce, but I'm not sure. It could have been the much raved about secret sauce, and I actually hope it was because it was such a great condiment. I added it to the de Pernil and it provided the the kick I was looking for. It also went amazingly well with the Yoyos which were not what I was  expecting. I expected a ""ball"" of plantain chunks with some form of fried batter outside and a salty cheese nugget at the center. Instead they were assembled like a sandwich of cheese center and plantain for ""bread"" and then enveloped in a heavy batter. It was a little bit of a let down, but not a disappointment. There was a small side of a syrup that was about the color or maple syrup but tasted more like a sugarcane or molasses flavor. Perhaps dark Karo? I wasn't sure if it was supposed to go on the Yoyos. I tried it, it worked, but it turned them into a breakfast or dessert. That being said, go eat there. It's really delicious, but ask for instructions.",3.0

"Caracas definitely does not Need to be reviewed. It is, however, my favorite restaurant in the city, so how can I not review it?I've been to both Caracas restaurants (E.Village and Williamsburg) plenty of times. The food is consistently amazing and fresh at both locations. You want cute and cozy (with a potential 40min wait unless there are only 2 of you)? Go to the East Village. You want spacious and filled with rum? Go to Williamsburg. Totally different, both amazing. And Always check the specials menu. There's always something delicious on it! (like mini arepas topped with quail eggs, por ejemplo)Let me lay it out for youTo start:-The tequeños are definitely my favorite side kick. I consider them to be Venezuelan mozzarella sticks (without the mozzarella). They are crunchy and the cheese inside is always oozy. They go very well with the yellow house sauce placed on every table. I almost always get them.-The yoyos aren't as sweet and juicy as maduros even though they are still made of fried sweet plantains, but they are still good esp. with the cheese inside. They come with a sauce that tastes like raisins that my boyf loves. If you really like raisins, I supposed you'd love it too.. I liked the yoyos better without that sauce though.-Guasacaca & Chips: can't really go wrong there-The Drinks:-Papelón con limón: sweet and tart-Cocado: coconut and cinnamon. Light and slightly sweet with that little kick from cinnamon-Cold Toddy: Yummy chocolate milkshake, essentially-Mimosa de Parchita: I love passion fruit and this is a lovely way to showcase itOnly in Williamsburg- yummy dark and stormy, Guarapitas with varying fruity flavors are always delicious, great Artisan Pisco Sour.The arepas: The arepa shell is light, with a little crunch on the outside and soft interior. But beware, it can easy soak up the juices of the meat and make for a messy meal. This is just part of the delicious experience! Have a napkin handy!Every time I go with my boyf, I get the ""De Pabellón."" It is undoubtedly the best arepa they have. Sweet, savory, cheesy, perfection! My absolute favorite! And my boyf always tries the arepa special of the day which is consistently delicious. However, we've had plenty of the regular arepas on the menu:Reina Pepiada- probably my least favorite arepa there, but it is still fresh with the avocado saladLa del Gato- great for vegetarians, lovely mix of sweetness and freshnessDe Pollo- great with the caramelized onion, perfect for your less adventurous friendsLos Muchachos- spicy! gotta love chorizoLa de Pernil-excellent with the spicy mango sauce!La Mulata-sweetness with a kick!La Sureña- delicious chimichurri sauceDessert:-3 Words: GET THE MARQUESA!!!Absolutely delicious! Thick chocolate mousse that will make your taste buds dance with joy! Maria cookies may not be great on their own, but strategically placed at the bottom of this mousse, they get soft and contrast amazingly with the mousse. I cannot say enough good things about this dessert, you must try it  yourself!-Quesillo: I love Caracas, I love flan... but not Caracas's flan. If you want a good flan, go to Cubana Cafe in Brooklyn. The Quesillo is actually the only item at Caracas that I have not thorough enjoyed, which is pretty amazing. I guess it's because they don't use cream cheese in their flan...To summarize: Ideal meal? Cocktail, Tequeños, De Pabellón arepa, Marquesa. Done and done. Caracas for life!",5.0

"I tell my boyfriend he's not my longest love - Caracas is. The love affair started in the east village, and (no joke) their opening of a place in williamsburg made it ok for me to move to the other side of the river. Good restaurants come and go. Eventually we get tired of them or take a break. I haven't gone longer than a couple months in my 6 years of living in new york without visiting Caracas. The williamsburg spot is a vast improvement on layout and seating over the east village location, and the food quality has stayed precisely the same. I was happy to recognize employees from the EV making it over to Williamsburg when it first opened. The garden outside is really nice in the summer, and the bar up front is perfect for a snack (that is, if you can grab a spot). It does get really very crowded, but most of the time it's not a terribly long wait and well worth it. While the arepas are legendary, I'm actually a bigger fan of the sidekicks. Typically, if I'm with one friend, I like to get two or three sidekicks and one arepa each. The tostones (plantain chips with cilantro-mayo sauce and cheese) are my boyfriend's fav and the bolirepitas (fried balls of arepa dough with cheese and a dipping sauce) are mine. Put the sauce on EVERYTHING. It's amazing. I wish they would sell it! It's just the right amount of spiciness and absolutely delicious. My favorite arepa is very simple - the la del gato (avocado, cheese and plantains), but the wide variety of flavors in the arepas is definitely a good reason to branch out. I also love the pernil and classic de pabellon. It's good to take advantage of the specials. In the past, I've found myself hoping they turn up on the regular menu and then a few months later they do! Sometimes the food can be a bit heavy, so it's nice to lighten it up with a salad, and they have some really lovely combinations on the menu. For dessert, an oblea (basically caramel sauce between two large, thin wafer cookies) is just the right amount of sweetness and it's fun to eat!",5.0
"I have yet to bring someone here that doesn't love it! The food is amazing, the atmosphere and service are really good. They have out door seating. I've gone probably 4 times and haven't gotten anything I haven't loved! (And I'm not easily impressed!)",5.0

"I went on Monday and I'm craving an Arepa now. I tried to convince some friends to go to the E. Village location with me for dinner tonight, but they want Japanese.

The williamsburg spot is a vast improvement on layout and seating over the east village location, and the food quality has stayed precisely the same. I was happy to recognize employees from the EV making it over to Williamsburg when it first opened. The garden outside is really nice in the summer, and the bar up front is perfect for a snack (that is, if you can grab a spot). It does get really very crowded, but most of the time it's not a terribly long wait and well worth it. While the arepas are legendary, I'm actually a bigger fan of the sidekicks. Typically, if I'm with one friend, I like to get two or three sidekicks and one arepa each. The tostones (plantain chips with cilantro-mayo sauce and cheese) are my boyfriend's fav and the bolirepitas (fried balls of arepa dough with cheese and a dipping sauce) are mine. Put the sauce on EVERYTHING. It's amazing. I wish they would sell it! It's just the right amount of spiciness and absolutely delicious. My favorite arepa is very simple - the la del gato (avocado, cheese and plantains), but the wide variety of flavors in the arepas is definitely a good reason to branch out. I also love the pernil and classic de pabellon. It's good to take advantage of the specials. In the past, I've found myself hoping they turn up on the regular menu and then a few months later they do! Sometimes the food can be a bit heavy, so it's nice to lighten it up with a salad, and they have some really lovely combinations on the menu. For dessert, an oblea (basically caramel sauce between two large, thin wafer cookies) is just the right amount of sweetness and it's fun to eat!",5.0
"I have yet to bring someone here that doesn't love it! The food is amazing, the atmosphere and service are really good. They have out door seating. I've gone probably 4 times and haven't gotten anything I haven't loved! (And I'm not easily impressed!)",5.0
This is their best location. Spacious and everything on the menu is good. La Playa is my favorite arepa. Their sauces are fantastic. Try the Micheletta spicy beer. Love it & all their cocktails. Nice corner table in the back if you have a special birthday dinner.,5.0
"I went on Monday and I'm craving an Arepa now. I tried to convince some friends to go to the E. Village location with me for dinner tonight, but they want Japanese. Wat-EVA.Ok, great vibe, nice water in bottles to refill yourself, yummy doughy arepas, clean/nicely decorated bathrooms (that's important!) and an outdoor area I'm sure will be utilized as it gets warmer.So, thank you for coming to Brooklyn/WB.

soo good. we were seated pretty quickly. the staff is really nice and we sat outdoors which was so pretty. the yoyo's and the arepas were great.the only reason im giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it took a little while for the food to come out. there were people that arrived after us that got their food first. that's a no no...but whatever it was worth the wait & i'll definitely be back. :),4.0

They were very good but the only problem that I had was one of them were greasy but other then that they were good. I want to go back and try other stuff on the menu. The prices were a little high to me. I paid about $7.00 for each arepa. The staff was friendly and restaurant was cute with a nice atomsphere real trendy. Now I like Venezuelan food.,4.0

"Maybe two months ago, someone from Brooklyn Bread noted on their FB page that he/she was dining on arepas from Caracas.  The post literally just listed what was in each arepa, but that was enough to catch my attention.  Boyfriend and I were in the area, attempting to visit the newly opened Breukelen Bier, and as we were on our way to hungry, figured we should stop in and give it a try.  Neither of us had eaten arepas before, nor did or do we have any knowledge of Venezuelan cuisine.  We both love Mexican and Peruvian, though, so we were hopeful.  We arrived around 5:30, so it was pretty empty.  They had happy hour drink specials, even though today is Saturday, so we both took advantage of that.  My Mimosa de Parchita w/a shot of rum was, on the plus side: refreshing and strong enough without being too strong, but on the minus side: really tasted strongly of passionfruit, which I'm only lukewarm about.  Ordering a drink that incorporates a flavor I don't love was obviously my bad call and reflects nothing about the quality of the cocktail, as I would assume is obvious, but I needed to throw it out there anyway.  Boyfriend had a Modelo, which he said was ""standard"" and ""good for the price.""  We attempted to share four arepas and an order of Tostones Mochimeros.  We failed on two counts.  Firstly, that was too much food for us both.  Even just three arepas and the tostones was pushing it, although it may have been just right had we been hungrier.  Secondly, and sadly, we ordered the A20 - La Surena, but received the A19 - La Mulata, which was not only incorrect but also not appetizing to us.  As we had filled up on the other dishes, we asked that they take the A19 back, but not bother to bring us the A20.  So although I was greatly looking forward to trying the chicken, chorizo, avocado, and chimi-churri filling, that will have to be an experience for another day.  My favorite of the arepas was the A8 - De Pabellon, composed of shredded beef, black beans, white salty cheese, and plantains.  Normally, I don't do black beans, they're just not for me.  But in this filling, they added a starchy dimension that was a really great compliment to the juiciness of the beef, the saltiness of the cheese, and the sweetness of the plantains.  I can't say enough good things about this arepa!  It's just so well-balanced and savory, and it completely caught me by surprise!  Boyfriend liked the A9 - De Guasacaca, with Venezuelan guacamole and paisa cheese, the best, which was another shocker.  I'm the guac lover in our relationship, and he is Mr. Meat, Meat, Meatety, Meat!  But in this case, he raved about the guacamole, while I wished for a bit more kick to it.  Our last arepa, A14 - La Jardinera, we THOUGHT had leeks, caramelized onions, sundried tomatoes, and cheese in it, BUT the online menu says its made with eggplant and not leeks, so we are now wondering exactly what we ate.  I, unfortunately, did not get far enough through it to make much of a distinction between flavors, because all I tasted was sweet, too sweet, and I was done.  Boyfriend, on the other hand, was happy to finish off all but my two bites despite his distaste for sun-dried tomatoes, and a man at the table behind us was raving about this particular arepa, soooo I guess we can't really call it on A14.What I CAN tell you is that the tostones are amazing!  A-MAZING!!  The ""mojito mayo"" that they spread on them is succhh creamy goodness, and the ""white cheese"" has this awesome salty bite to it that, in this preparation, is really reminiscent of pecorino.  Add some of that yellow mustardy-looking but garlicy-tasting sauce that's on the tables for an extra kick!  Though there were some misses, the hits more than compensated for them.  We'll be back!",4.0
"Caracas is fabulous and it really annoys me when people are rude to the staff there. They bust their asses, turning over about a hundred tables in one pretty busy night. Their food and drinks are phenomenal, and it is, by far, my favorite casual restaurant. Here's a little story I told a while back of why customers suck:The Boy and I decided to go to Caracas before heading to our favorite bar, Duff's. We chose the one closest to my home, which also had more seating space. Still, the restaurant was crowded and busy (this is to be expected almost every hour the place is open, nothing new). We get a seat outside and are enjoying giving each other goo-goo eyes and drinking delicious drinks and waiting on our food.We were sat by a wonderful host and had our orders (we got a variety platter of their three top-selling arepas and a side of maduros with salty cheese, but I can't remember what that dish was called) taken by a busy, but super-kind and lovely waitress. She was the waitress for an entire row of tables in the patio, including the table next to us.Next to us were sat three ladies in their mid-20s. Now, remember, this space is a bit cramped, so we could hear every word of their conversations, which totally killed the ""yay, we're happy and giggly and in love"" mood.First bit: these ladies decided it was appropriate to bitch and complain about people they know literally four feet away from other customers, using very vulgar language and just general snottiness. My boyfriend and I happened to be those other customers. Which was... well, off-putting, but that doesn't make them sucky customers, more like sucky people you have to deal with.What makes them sucky customers is this:When the waitress brought their check over (now, note, this was a BUSY restaurant on a Friday night), the ladies started discussing the check's total. They had two mixed drinks each, totaling six drinks. Caracas had a special where you can add rum to any of their fruit juices for $3, the juices costing $3.75. That would be a total of $40.50. Their check came up to a little over $60. Okay, yes, that is definitely a problem. A problem I would have addressed by pointing it out to my server in a kind manner - this is, after all a busy restaurant on a Friday night, things happen.They did not point this out kindly to the waitress. Instead, they threw a huge hissy fit. When the waitress broke it down for them and realized there was an error, they got all snotty with her, as if she was telling them to suck it up and pay the $20 more. One girl said ""Uh, well, I think you need to go FIX it then"" and another replied with ""yeah, you go do that!"" or something to that effect. When she left, the girls all of a sudden started bitching about her, again, with us sitting right next to them.""DAMN, I AM GOING TO PUNCH SOMEONE TODAY""""THIS IS WHY PEOPLE TURN GHETTO, F'REAL!"" (I do not exaggerate, this was a real quote. Way to be graceful, ladies!)And other general nonsense. I wanted to punch THEM for ruining the mood of my dinner and treating such a lovely waitress like a piece of dirt.Eventually, the manager comes back and explains there is an error on the computer because this was a new special they were running. He apologizes profusely. Again, when the manager leaves, they continue their ranting. It got fixed, you weren't overcharged in the end, it caused a SLIGHT inconvenience, shut the hell up.The moral of the story? Don't be rude to your waitress. Especially on a Friday night when it's slam packed and people have to sit next to you, trying to enjoy their meal. BECAUSE IT MAKES YOU SUCK A LOTPlus, arepas are just delicious. Load up on that sauce, por favor.",5.0

"Maybe two months ago, someone from Brooklyn Bread noted on their FB page that he/she was dining on arepas from Caracas.  The post literally just listed what was in each arepa, but that was enough to catch my attention.  Boyfriend and I were in the area, attempting to visit the newly opened Breukelen Bier, and as we were on our way to hungry, figured we should stop in and give it a try.  Neither of us had eaten arepas before, nor did or do we have any knowledge of Venezuelan cuisine.  We both love Mexican and Peruvian, though, so we were hopeful.  We arrived around 5:30, so it was pretty empty.  They had happy hour drink specials, even though today is Saturday, so we both took advantage of that.  My Mimosa de Parchita w/a shot of rum was, on the plus side: refreshing and strong enough without being too strong, but on the minus side: really tasted strongly of passionfruit, which I'm only lukewarm about.  Ordering a drink that incorporates a flavor I don't love was obviously my bad call and reflects nothing about the quality of the cocktail, as I would assume is obvious, but I needed to throw it out there anyway.  Boyfriend had a Modelo, which he said was ""standard"" and ""good for the price.""  We attempted to share four arepas and an order of Tostones Mochimeros.  We failed on two counts.  Firstly, that was too much food for us both.  Even just three arepas and the tostones was pushing it, although it may have been just right had we been hungrier.  Secondly, and sadly, we ordered the A20 - La Surena, but received the A19 - La Mulata, which was not only incorrect but also not appetizing to us.  As we had filled up on the other dishes, we asked that they take the A19 back, but not bother to bring us the A20.  So although I was greatly looking forward to trying the chicken, chorizo, avocado, and chimi-churri filling, that will have to be an experience for another day.  My favorite of the arepas was the A8 - De Pabellon, composed of shredded beef, black beans, white salty cheese, and plantains.  Normally, I don't do black beans, they're just not for me.  But in this filling, they added a starchy dimension that was a really great compliment to the juiciness of the beef, the saltiness of the cheese, and the sweetness of the plantains.  I can't say enough good things about this arepa!  It's just so well-balanced and savory, and it completely caught me by surprise!  Boyfriend liked the A9 - De Guasacaca, with Venezuelan guacamole and paisa cheese, the best, which was another shocker.  I'm the guac lover in our relationship, and he is Mr. Meat, Meat, Meatety, Meat!  But in this case, he raved about the guacamole, while I wished for a bit more kick to it.  Our last arepa, A14 - La Jardinera, we THOUGHT had leeks, caramelized onions, sundried tomatoes, and cheese in it, BUT the online menu says its made with eggplant and not leeks, so we are now wondering exactly what we ate.  I, unfortunately, did not get far enough through it to make much of a distinction between flavors, because all I tasted was sweet, too sweet, and I was done.  Boyfriend, on the other hand, was happy to finish off all but my two bites despite his distaste for sun-dried tomatoes, and a man at the table behind us was raving about this particular arepa, soooo I guess we can't really call it on A14.What I CAN tell you is that the tostones are amazing!  A-MAZING!!  The ""mojito mayo"" that they spread on them is succhh creamy goodness, and the ""white cheese"" has this awesome salty bite to it that, in this preparation, is really reminiscent of pecorino.  Add some of that yellow mustardy-looking but garlicy-tasting sauce that's on the tables for an extra kick!  Though there were some misses, the hits more than compensated for them.  We'll be back!",4.0
"Caracas is fabulous and it really annoys me when people are rude to the staff there. They bust their asses, turning over about a hundred tables in one pretty busy night. Their food and drinks are phenomenal, and it is, by far, my favorite casual restaurant. Here's a little story I told a while back of why customers suck:The Boy and I decided to go to Caracas before heading to our favorite bar, Duff's. We chose the one closest to my home, which also had more seating space. Still, the restaurant was crowded and busy (this is to be expected almost every hour the place is open, nothing new). We get a seat outside and are enjoying giving each other goo-goo eyes and drinking delicious drinks and waiting on our food.We were sat by a wonderful host and had our orders (we got a variety platter of their three top-selling arepas and a side of maduros with salty cheese, but I can't remember what that dish was called) taken by a busy, but super-kind and lovely waitress. She was the waitress for an entire row of tables in the patio, including the table next to us.Next to us were sat three ladies in their mid-20s. Now, remember, this space is a bit cramped, so we could hear every word of their conversations, which totally killed the ""yay, we're happy and giggly and in love"" mood.First bit: these ladies decided it was appropriate to bitch and complain about people they know literally four feet away from other customers, using very vulgar language and just general snottiness. My boyfriend and I happened to be those other customers. Which was... well, off-putting, but that doesn't make them sucky customers, more like sucky people you have to deal with.What makes them sucky customers is this:When the waitress brought their check over (now, note, this was a BUSY restaurant on a Friday night), the ladies started discussing the check's total. They had two mixed drinks each, totaling six drinks. Caracas had a special where you can add rum to any of their fruit juices for $3, the juices costing $3.75. That would be a total of $40.50. Their check came up to a little over $60. Okay, yes, that is definitely a problem. A problem I would have addressed by pointing it out to my server in a kind manner - this is, after all a busy restaurant on a Friday night, things happen.They did not point this out kindly to the waitress. Instead, they threw a huge hissy fit. When the waitress broke it down for them and realized there was an error, they got all snotty with her, as if she was telling them to suck it up and pay the $20 more. One girl said ""Uh, well, I think you need to go FIX it then"" and another replied with ""yeah, you go do that!"" or something to that effect. When she left, the girls all of a sudden started bitching about her, again, with us sitting right next to them.""DAMN, I AM GOING TO PUNCH SOMEONE TODAY""""THIS IS WHY PEOPLE TURN GHETTO, F'REAL!"" (I do not exaggerate, this was a real quote. Way to be graceful, ladies!)And other general nonsense. I wanted to punch THEM for ruining the mood of my dinner and treating such a lovely waitress like a piece of dirt.Eventually, the manager comes back and explains there is an error on the computer because this was a new special they were running. He apologizes profusely. Again, when the manager leaves, they continue their ranting. It got fixed, you weren't overcharged in the end, it caused a SLIGHT inconvenience, shut the hell up.The moral of the story? Don't be rude to your waitress. Especially on a Friday night when it's slam packed and people have to sit next to you, trying to enjoy their meal. BECAUSE IT MAKES YOU SUCK A LOTPlus, arepas are just delicious. Load up on that sauce, por favor.",5.0

Nevertheless, I attempted to order a balanced meal, only to be scoffed at by our server: ""That's brunch"" he flared, without suggesting an appropriate alternative for dinner.  An arepa is basically a ball of grease with meat and veggies tucked inside.

Though the Venezuelan-style guacamole was excellent, there were about twice as many plantain chips as necessary but OH MY GOD THAT MILKSHAKE WAS GLORIOUS. Light and sweet, it went perfectly with our savory La Popular Curiaras ($21), a combination platter of three split arepas: La de Pabellon (Shredded Beef, Black Beans, White Salty Cheese, and Sweet Plantains), La Reina Pepiada (Chunky Chicken and Avocado Mix Salad), and La Mulata (Grilled White Cheese with Jalapenos, Sauteed Red Peppers, Fried Sweet Plantains, and Black Beans). There's no price break for ordering the platter, it just makes sharing much easier.Still...De Pabellon is the best arepa. Hands down.

"Delish.  Great fried plantains with a side of crumbly white cheese for an appetizer (with which I HIGHLY recommend liberal use of the spicy sweet saucy on the table).  For dinner, an arepa with pork, black beans, cheese and plantains.  Amazing.  Only complaint about mine was that the pork (and probably the copious amounts of secret sauce I added) made the arepa pretty soggy by the last few bites, which was a bum out because the first few bites were perfectly crisp/chewy/soft.  Also, its worth noting that being not accustomed to city prices I initially balked at the $7 per arepa price, however once I was totally filled and sated by my arepa, the price seemed only fair.  I will def be returning again and again till I have tried every single thing on the menu.",4.0
"I came here on a whim on hot and humid August night. I love arepas and Central/South American food in general but I was in no mood to eat a hot meal, but I did not want to trek it back out to the city. The evening cooled down and my appetite grew steadily as the quarter-hours passed, and I arrived at Caracas Arepa Bar with my shirt slightly dampened from hunger sweats. If you haven't experienced hunger sweats, walk in 80 degree, 80% humidity weather with a growling stomach.It was hotter inside the restaurant than it was out, and we reluctantly sat down at our table, as the entire outdoor patio was filled. A virtual No Vacancy sign blinked before my eyes every time I wiped a bead of sweat from my brow. I cool down fairly easily but on that night, it was tough to do, especially with no ice-water. That's right, there was no ice water. I had to use beer to bring my temperature back to equilibrium. Wait, did I just complain about having to drink beer? Grow a damn pair, John! Get it together!No ice water? No problem. The ceviche was as delicious as it was refreshing, and all of a sudden my stomach was back in business. I quickly scarfed down two platanos with salted cheese. I ordered two arepas (one eggplant, one pork), and I doused each bite with hot sauce and residual ceviche juice. Sweating never felt so orgasmic. And natural. And necessary. I wondered to myself, would I have enjoyed the meal on a night with more comfortable weather? Absolutely not.",4.0

"We went to Caracas craving an arepa! We arrived and we were greeted by the nice hostess, but we decided it would be nice to sit at the bar. She gave us menus while we waited for a spot. We did not have to wait long, after about five minutes of waiting we found two seats and sat at the bar... and sat at the bar we did! With 2 bartenders on shift, we waited for quite some time for any sort of service. As boredom was on the rise, we started eavesdropping on the conversation the bartender was having with her friend sitting next to us. We learned lots about our ""bartender""! We know now she loves to drink tequila and rum, straight or with a twist. Tequila and Rum would be nice to have in my hand! The frustration was beginning to build, with no chance of me waiving her down, she was too engrossed in her conversation. After 25 minutes of waiting and waiting, with hunger building and sobriety becoming a reality, we decided enough was enough, and left annoyed, frustrated, and still craving an arepa.",1.0
"A huge fan of this place after the first night. Hate the long wait but like all good places, it's totally worth it. I had the chips and guac as a starter and it was AMAZING. The chips weren't tortilla chips but were plaintain and I think taro. It was so crisp, non-oily and perfect compliment to the guac. Another thing was the sauce that comes with every table. I don't know what's in it but it's delicious with everything..even by itself. I also ordered the yo-yo's but the maple syrup or dip that came with it was too sweet. It was more like a dessert and/or breakfast appetizer than for dinner. But it was fried perfectly and it tasted very good. Lastly, were the arepas! Tried both la surena and la de pernil. La surena had more flavor and was my favorite. Loved the environment at this place. It's small and cozy and the waitresses here were very nice.",5.0
"Arepas!!! No can defend! Ok so this place makes delicious arepas stuffed with various meats, vegetables and cheeses. Its friendly food for just about anyone. I think they even have vegetarian arepas, not my thing... not that there's anything wrong with it. It's great for groups. The ambience is bustling and lively yet you can still have a great intimate time. The apps are all delicious all unique to non latinos and thats why this place is so special. Its serves as an introduction to latin food beyond the typical mexican burrito joint. Their beer selection is awesome then they top that off with a dollar rum shot i mean c'mon was this place made for me? I've tried there mixed drink  pitchers and they've been nice and strong as well as craftily concocted. My only gripe is that I went there with a party of three including myself and they tried to fit us into a table meant for two with the third person facing a wall. The plates would not have even been able to fit on that table. We opted to continue waiting for the next available table. Aside from that Arepa Bar is THE place to hit up.",5.0

The place look pretty decent so we walk inside and I order myself a chrizo, cheese and pepper arepa and my cousin order a dessert(fried plantation), When it came out it look pretty dam good so i ate it and it tasted pretty good esspecially after you put the fruity homemade hotsauce.

"Did you grow up in Jackson heights, Colombia like me? do you remember how much you alwasy wished for an arepa sandwich? well now you can have one!  i lreally liked the food here adn the cold chocolate shake was awesome. the only reason hey got four stars was the coffee.  I love coffee...i mean, LOVE COFFEE.  and when my people charge 3.50 for a smal cafe con leche... i drop them star.  every spanish person alive knows that good coffee should be shared with the world adn not buy into the 3.50 a cup nonsense that starbucks has washed our brains with.

Let preface this by saying that hands down the manhattan location cannot compare to the crappy service offered here! Decided to try this location which was absolutely awful from the beginning. Although the food was pretty good with the exception of one arepa that I was not a fan of...the service is absolutely horrible. Very very slow...it took forever for our drinks to arrive mind you all we ordered was the sangria pitcher (which tasted like pure red wine...not sure why they even bother calling it sangria. Our entrees took over an hour and it was only 4 of us. We all got arepas which don't take long to prepare. The shredded beef arepa was amazing however again the food took a long time...we each got one of the two arepas that we ordered however we had to ask to waitress for it since we had been waiting so long. Additionally the other ones we ordered took another 15 minutes before they came to us. As if that wasn't bad enough my boyfriends arepa was very hard partially burned. They even over cooked his pork which should have been tender. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT bother going to this particular caracas location. Take the trip to the city instead.,1.0
The one is the east village is full of flavor fill u up with an array of arepas under 10 bucks--the one in bk is all this PLUS rum.

"one of my favorite restaurants of all time! i even had my birthday dinner here. every arepa i've ordered has been amazing, and the tostones mochimeros are the best. service is super friendly too, which is always a plus. especially in the land of pretentious hipsters.. i really like this location too vs. the one in the city... no complaints!",4.0
Caracas is delicious and there are many interesting choices on the menu including the fresh salads.The wait staff could be warmer but so far it's been a mixed bag with them...some are really nice and some are disgruntled. The brunch here is fantastic and worth a trip for that alone.,4.0
"overall foodie experience was great. friendly wait staff. arepa was mouth-watering( it had chicken & avocado). venezuelan plate 1 was good, although the pulled pork was a little on the sweet/tart side. passion fruit natural juice a must. will definitely be back!",3.0
"I've eaten lots of Colombian Arepas but never had Venezuelan ones. I'm not sure I can even think of a word to describe how great the Arepas here are. I ordered the Arepa with shredded beef and cheddar cheese and because the Arepas are made out of corn it reminded me of the taste of a taco but that's a good thing. I split an empanada with plantains, beef, rice with a friend and the empanadas are bigger than the Colombian ones that I'm used to. I ate here on a Friday night and it was packed. When you first walk in the bar is to your left and it's crowded. The seating area for waiting is very small. If your whole party isn't there when you give the hostess your name don't plan on being seated right away. My friend and I were waiting for the rest of our party to arrive and in the time that we were waiting they gave our table to another group. The beers are a good price, I got a Blue Moon for $5 and they have a deal where if you buy a beer you can get a shot of Venezuelan rum for $1. This restaurant is not a far walk from the L train (Bedford Ave stop).",5.0

"Wow, I can't wait to go back to try more things! I went with a large group and the servivce and food were great despite the fact that there were a lot of us all catching up with each other and not always paying full attention to the servers. They were patient described a million things on the menu and were fast and friendly. The food and drinks were delicious! I just wish I knew what was in that sauce!",5.0
"Seriously, I don't even wanna give a star. The worst experience ever. Service super slow(waited 45min to get tiny whatever thing don't even remember and it was weekday lunch, place was not busy at all!!!), waitress gave us an attitude then never came back, at the end,food sucked. I only tasted grease. NEVER again.",1.0
"Sooo yummy. I loved the yoyos. I had la surena arepa and it was really good. My brother had the special arepa and it was really really really good. He says he always gets the special, because no matter what it sounds like it's always better than you imagine. So next time (because there has to be a next time even though I live on the other side of the country) I will be getting the special too. Now I just need to find a place in San Fran that serves arepas.

JESUS CHRIST. don't go here.",2.0
"The food here is very tasty.  And the staff is very nice, which is a change from the major attitude the staff gives off at their East Village location.  Ultimately Caracas' food is expensive for what it is, but the atmosphere is nice and the menu is good for both meat eaters and vegetarians.  I would  avoid the cocktails though, $9 bucks each, and they come in a tiny rocks glass.  Stick with beer.",3.0

"Love this place! This is one of my favorite places to eat dinner.  I would recommend the De Pabellon arepa- I never skip this one.  The special arepa is usually also very good, as well.  The Guasacaca and chips make a great appetizer.  If you decide to venture away from the delicious arepas, don't get the cachapa- I wasn't too impressed.  This location has more room and more seating than the Manhattan space, so it's a more comfortable experience, in general.",4.0
"I would have given this restaurant 4 starts except that I wasn't impressed by the dessert. So I found this place on Yelp and me and the hubby decided to check it out. I had never had arepas before so I was excited to try something new. I had the Pabellon Arepa, which I was told was the most popular and it was filled with shredded beef, salty cheese, black beans, and sweet plantains, yummmmmmmmmmmmmm. It was sooo good. It's about the size of a small hamburger and what sucks is that, you're still kind of hungry after eating one, but you would never been able to finish a second one, so your pretty much forced to order dessert or an appetizer to get that happy, full feeling. For dessert I had the Obleas, which is 2 large wafers with Dulce de leche spread in the middle and my husband had flan. The Obleas was good, but very simple, I felt jipped that I had to pay for it and the flan was reeally good once you got past the weird flan consistency. I would definitely go back, and I would get appetizers instead of dessert.",3.0
"this is a great place to grab some brunch if you're looking for something different than the typical american brunch. went here with some buddies for a bromantic brunch. there was no wait when we went after 12p, but that could have been due to the rain. i had the criollo brunch plate. it looked small, but half way i was starting to get full. the shredded beef was tasty and the sauce on the table added flavor to everything.",4.0

"First of all, there is a big sign on the door that says ""WE ARE NOT BYOB"".  And there was no alcohol to be seen on anyone's table. Maybe they just stopped it today.  And they don't have their liquor license yet.  I don't get the hype about this place as well.  The arepas that we got were just ok.  I got the special arepa - La de Victor - grilled and crispy shredded chicken over nata spread, grilled onions, tomato and avocado slices, and green tomatillo sauce.  Sounded awesome, but the chicken was so dry and tough.  That combined with the really crispy arepa gave me a headache from chewing so much.  I also got the La Mulata arepa which was pretty bland and flavorless.  The guasacaca and chips were good.  Fresh tasting guacamole and I liked the fact that it came with taro and plantain chips.  But that was the only thing that was good about this place.  The service was good also.  Very friendly.  But I definitely would not go back there or recommend this place to anyone.",2.0

"Costumer service is king. It truly makes or breaks an experience. Even if Caracas has amazing Arepas, they tasted like poop after the treatment we received there last night. My friends and I are hard core Caracas fans. We've been visiting both establishments in Williamsburg and Manhattan now for a while. Last night may have been just the last one for me. We went with a big group (25 people or so) to celebrate a friend's birthday. The manager, Florencia, was absolutely rude. From approaching us as soon as we got there to warn us to not cause a raucous (our butts had barely touched the seats at this point) to screaming at us from across the bar in front of other patrons to stop making noise. The so called noise she screamed about lasted about 1 minute while the birthday girl stopped at our table to say hello. The music was so loud that I have a hard time believing that anyone could even hear us but her (we were sat exactly besides the bar away from other costumers.) Bottom line: Florencia failed management 101. Ruined what should have been a good time and lost the business of a loyal following.",2.0
