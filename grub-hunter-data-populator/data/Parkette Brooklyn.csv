"Spent a couple of hours here yesterday. Had black tea (English breakfast? Can't remember) and a gluten free apple scone that was really fantastic. All this while snow was falling outside to the sound of the beach boys and Bon Iver. If you're staying inside they give you proper cups and teapots and plates. Baristas are really great and seem to have a good relationship with locals. I rarely get excited about coffeehouses in the US but this place is a real gem.There are toys and books in the back for people with kids. There were mix of diners working on their computers, reading books and socializing with friends.",5.0
"I'm sitting in here while writing this review. Parkette is a great addition to Sunset Park; bringing Stumptown coffee and Dough doughnuts to the neighborhood. With its circular marble tables on the side with a larger community table in the back, this is a great place to get work done (Did I mention outlets and good wifi as well?)The owner is really nice and tries to talk to his customers and get to know them. I appreciate that. With all the suck up coffee shops we encounter in New York, some personal interaction isn't bad. This has become one of my favorite places to get work done on the weekend. I have not tried their food but they do have quiches, sandwiches and pastries if you're looking for a quick meal.",4.0
"Food: they have Dough doughnuts!! The main reason I give 4 vs 5 stars is they were out of 2/4 sandwiches when I came in... They have assorted pastries and bagels but would like to see them expand on the food, breakfast sandwiches maybe.. Coffee (stumptown) and lattes are goodService: both baristas were very friendly Ambience: a good spot to get some work done in sunset park... Small individual tables, homey feel",4.0
"Came here during my morning walk around the neighborhood, read some Yelp reviews before heading to this coffee shop. Once inside, the atmosphere is family friendly, and also with a hipster vibe. The guy behind the counter was very nice and polite, gave recommendations as to what drinks was his personal favorite. I ended up going with his choice of the Chai Latte with extra cinnamon, and a Mocha donut. The latte tasted good with the cinnamon adding an extra flavor, and the Mocha donut also tasted fresh. Price is moderate latte and donut $6.50",4.0
"Stumptown in Sunset Park! Absolutely flawless coffee service, these guys really know their stuff -- and the pastries and sandwiches are delicious. Probably my favorite of Sunset Park's three new coffee shops for sitting and watching the world go by!",5.0
"This new, yuppie spot is still new so they don't have a lot of options. I had a baguette sandwich which was prepackaged (for some reason, I thought it was freshly made) but it was rather tasty. It left me feeling hungry still but I didn't want to get another one since I was in the mood for my Island blast smoothie from Don Pepe. Hopefully, they will expand their menu in the future.",3.0

"Our first visit to Parkette was after stopping by the Brooklyn Flea in Industry City. We enjoyed the coffee and we especially loved the kiddie corner in the back with toys for our toddler. We liked it so much that we decided to take the bus from Cobble Hill all the way to Sunset Park just to enjoy this little gem again.Unfortunately our second visit was not as pleasant, and we were thoroughly disappointed that we made such a long trek out of our neighborhood. When we arrived on the morning of 2/20 we were (not) greeted by the grumpy woman behind the counter. My husband ordered an iced coffee, which she begrudgingly rung up and then she rolled her eyes at me when I was taking a minute to peruse the menu - mind you there was no one behind us. I asked her if the sodas they offer on the menu are very sweet, to which she responded ""Well it's soda, so what do you think?"" First of all, that is beyond rude. Second of all, it's not called soda because it's sweet. It's called soda because the drink uses soda water, and the fact that the soda seemed to be made in house, I believe makes it a legitimate question. Ok, well moving on. I asked her instead for an iced tea and she rudely replied ""We don't have that."" You carry ice, and you carry tea, but no iced tea. Ok that's fine too. I'll stick to my water and we will make our way out faster than anticipated. We sat for a bit while my husband worked on his coffee and our son played with all of the toys, all while the barista continued to shoot rude looks at us any time our son passed her line of sight. I'm giving one star for the atmosphere which includes the area in the corner with toddler toys and activities. The second star is for the other guy working who was trying to be extra nice to overcompensate for the cold service we had just received. Also, I just want to note that the first time we visited this coffee shop we were served by two young guys who were very pleasant. If the service is consistent we are happy to return, until then we will take our business elsewhere.",2.0
"Great coffee, great pastries, great sandwiches, and great staff. The space is also beautiful, exposed brick, tin ceiling, lots of natural light, and right next to the park. Can't go wrong.",5.0

I haven't seen a real coffee shop around here where I can bring my laptop and do work.....until now.  What a pleasant surprise.   Great coffee and a good place to get some work done.  Usually I would go to the slope but this also works.  My life has been made easier.  The espresso is good.,5.0

"It was about time for Sunset Park's 5th Avenue to have such a nice place.  A coffee shop with a great atmosphere, good coffee and great bites.  Service is impeccable. Baristas know how to brew an excellent coffee but also how to treat patrons!!!  The marble top bistro tables and the banquettes make the place cozy but big enough to keep one's space without reading the neighbour's tablet.  I tried the mozzarella, tomato and pesto sandwich and the goat cheese and onion tart. Nice bites and comfort food. The patisseries look really good --still have to try them.  I hope that they will expand the menu as they grow.  For now, let's get everybody to Parkette for a coffee to stay or to go.  Let's make Parkette a meeting place for Sunset Parkers!!!!!!! We finally got a great coffee show in the neighbourhood!!!! And yes, they have WiFi.",5.0
