My favorite place to eat during my lunch break or in between clients love the food and service they give,5.0
"My mom and I were in the area visiting a family friend in the hospital and afterwards we both wanted to grab some food to go. I checked my bookmarks on YELP and said I definitely wanted something Caribbean since I was in the area for most things Caribbean. :-) Now the decisions on where to go because I had over 20 spots bookmarked to check out in the area. I checked for the place with the best reviews and chose ""Bake and Things."" Wow, I made a great choice because the food was slamming.When we first walked in we noticed it was a small spot but the long line indicated there was some serious good grub behind the glass enclosed counters. I laughed when I saw a sign that said ""please don't be on the phone when ordering."" I moved off the line and stood to the side and checked YELP for some of Yelpers favorite dishes.  My mom and I were shocked there were quite few items on the menu that we had no idea what they were, LOL. (Ex. Buss up shut, dhal) Usually I am the adventurous one and try something new. However, I was too hungry and wanted something I was familiar with and could really review their food. We conversed with two customers who had two small plastic cups of different juices and learned they were given samples to try to see if they liked which was cool to know. One guy was raving about his peanut punch. (Something I will sample on the next visit. :-)I ordered the curry goat meal that came with rice and peas and the two sides I chose were the mac and cheese and cabbage for $8. My mom ordered the jerk chicken meal that came with rice and peas and the two sides she chose were the okra and spinach which she enjoyed. I was able to have two servings with the healthy helpings I received. I think I enjoyed my leftover food the next day even better than the first day. My only issue with my meal was that the curry goat had more bones than I would've preferred but I still sucked those bones because the spices and seasonings were soooo good. This is definitely a place I will check out again when I'm in the area and try one of those Trinidadian dishes and drinks that I haven't tried before",4.0
"Doubles: Dry channa and stiff bara, bland flavor and tasteless pepper sauce.Workers: Completely not interested in being there or helping you.",2.0
"I was in the area and had to stop at Bake & Things. Last time I came I thoroughly enjoyed my food.They have so many options here. I was tempted to get  everything in sight but settled on feeding my stomach instead of my eyes. I ended up ordering the same thing I got last time; Only difference is I added chickpeas to my roti and a seperate side of lentil peas. The roti skin was stuffed with at least two scoops of curry chicken, pumpkin and chickpeas. Yoo this thing was heavy! More than enough for two people. The chickpeas were a bit spicy but it evened out with the sweetness from the pumpkin. The curry chicken was falling off the bone and the curry flavor wasn't overpowering. The side of lentil peas were deliciousness!! Perfect amount of seasoning, not salty at all; similar to how I make mines at home.I really enjoyed my entire meal and would most definitely come back.",5.0
"I just passed up a ""vegetable roti"" somewhere else with potato, channa and steamed cabbage and headed to Bake and Things for the first time. I got a DELICIOUS roti with potato, channa, pumpkin, spinach and okra.  That's what mean by Vegetable Roti! It was exactly what this vegetarian wanted. And the price was great. I'll definitely be back!!.",5.0
"roti rocks!! must go!!!Oh, and there's plenty of choices of meats to put on it! chicken, beef, lamb, you name it!",4.0
"Finally back in Brooklyn for work, and with a foodie coworker, bonus! We take a quick walk two blocks to Church Ave. to seek this 4 star rated place, with an ""A"" rating in the window, great! The signage is easy to spot, we are thinking we can sit down and eat, not so much, there is a 2 seat table inside and two tables outside, which could have been an option, but they are re paving Church Ave. (Asphalt and food don't really go well) The food choices are plentiful, unless you are a regular, the menu is somewhat confusing. Main staples as far as West Indian food goes, this place is Trinidadian so you will their style of food with all of the Indian and Indo-Chinese inspired foods, yum! A dinner comes with rice, two sides and a main, I had the Oxtail, white rice, macaroni pie and spinach! Delicious, I love the fact that every Caribbean country will have the same dishes, but slightly different, the oxtail was very tender and pulled easily from the bone but not falling apart, had a slight sweetness to it. Macaroni pie was smooth and fluffy, it's not a heavy mac and cheese. The spinach is similar to an Indian Saag, creamy and good, the rice was nice and fluffy! My coworker got the curry goat, rice and peas with steamed veggies and she got the last bit of plantains ( envious, I love sweet and savory) We were both in food comas after lunch! The ladies working the counter were very efficient and friendly! A must do when in the area! FYI cash only!",4.0
"One of my favorite restaurants in Flatbush. Food is ALWAYS tasty and the prices are very reasonable. The one detraction i have is the size of the place; this place is small and almost always packed! The staff is awesome, portions are good. If it was bigger 5 stars for sure!",4.0
"After getting take out from this spot on one day, I found myself craving their food the next. Bake and things specializes in Trini and Caribbean food. I had their Caribbean style Chinese food, that is cooked completely different from the Chinese food you find on every other block in Brooklyn. It was delicious. I also had their chicken roti which was a large serving, very filling and delicious. I haven't tried their bake as yet because I haven't had a chance to get over there for breakfast, but judging from the other dishes, I'm sure it'll be good. PS. They have an A rating from the Department of Health, which is a big deal to me.",5.0
For the most part I've gotten good food but how can you be out of veggies and shrimp at 5:00 on a Friday. Why can't  the oil be skimmed off the stew chicken? Won't be back no time soon,2.0
"I'm deducting a star because the young woman at the counter was not very pleasant. I'm not Caribbean, so some of the foods were foreign to me...like macaroni pie. I asked if it was something like mac & cheese and let's just say, if looks could kill, it would've been a massacre.  Ppl on the line were helping me figure out my order. Pretty embarrassing. As far as the food, my husband likes food bland, so he did not like the curry chicken roti. I, on the other hand LOVED the curry goat and his remaining chicken roti. It was the best I've had in a long time. It was seasoned to perfection. I also liked the mac pie. However I did not care for the pumpkin. Oh yeah, we ate bake & saltfish while we waited on our order...delish! I will go again and I recommend my fellow foodies to give them a try. Other than the less than stellar customer service, I don't think they'll disappoint.",4.0
"What a great deal for delicious food.  I first got turned on saltfish and bake from my coworker but then someone suggested to get the saltfish and doubles, AMAZING but I still prefer the bake.  I always get a roti and the saltfish when I come here, comes out to be about $10.  It is a real treat because I'm hardly ever in the area.  Great food, big portions and super cheap.  The roti is soft but has a nice texture with the chick pea flour, the curry inside is just the right amount of spice with huge pieces of meat!Next time I'll try the oxtail!",5.0

"I have been eating here since I was a kid. My dad always stopped by to pick up food for my fam and as I got older I kept going because the food is ON POINT. Bake & Things is the best Trinidadian food in the East Flatbush/Flatbush area. No one can argue with me about this, sorry lol. The food is authentic, the price is great, and there is everything you can think of on the menu from bake and saltfish to oil down to curry crab and dumplin. This morning I traveled from Ditmas Park just to get a shrimp roti ($8) and although the line was out the door, the employees delivered. My roti had just the right amount of potato and channa with not too much shrimp. It was so good oh goossshh. Seriously, I recommend this childhood fav to everyone.",5.0
"Amazing take out.  I tasted the fish soup, the curry chicken roti, and the curry goat roti.  All were delicious, though the goat was my favorite.  The roti are burrito wraps with potatoes and vegetables with your choice of protein.  The goat was terrific, it fell off the bone, had a terrific curry seasoning, and paired with the potatoes perfectly.  The chicken was also terrific, a more mild taste than the goat.  The fish soup was pungent, in a good way.  I know some people have a hard time with smelly fish soup, and while this wasn't too much, it is a fishy smelling soup.  It had a terrific fish broth with chucks of fish and potatoes and vegetables.NOTE: like with most Caribbean food, if the animal you are eating has bones, your food will likely have bones.  Even if it is wrapped up in a roti.  I think this makes the meat more flavorful, but use a little care in your chewing. It is an extremely small place that can barely house the people waiting in line for their food, grab your food and get out of there.I'd love to try everything on the menu.",5.0
"This may be my new favorite Caribbean food place in Brooklyn. Definitely not a sit down restaurant. You pick your food up to go. The menu is pretty extensive. I'm a fan of the curry goat, but if you like oxtail, rotis, curry fish etc. this is still the place for you. I even had curry beef for the first time here (I'm not a fan but it was nice to have the option). The meals are filling as well and all come in the option of medium and large and include rice. Please pick me up an order of curry goat, macaroni pie and callaloo any day!",5.0
"I used to always come here one summer for breakfast (bake and saltfish), one summer when I had a summer youth job around the corner at a medical office. Was in the area and I couldn't remember exactly where it was...I guess thats why yelp is so great. I go in and order fried bake & saltfish and coconut bake and shark. This is where the loss of one star comes in to play...they didn't have coconut bake or shark. So my question is why was it on the menu. Ok I must admit their menu is plastered on the wall over the counter. But why not post a sign saying what you don't have that day.Anyways the saltfish was cooked perfectly. I've had some where they didn't cook all the salt out smh. The fried bake was nice and flaky. Will definitely go again especially at $2.25 a pop. Only 25cents more than it was over 10years ago",4.0
"I do take out from here often when I'm too lazy to cook but not to lazy to eat crappy food. The food quality is excellent. Consistent in flavor and gives huge portions for affordable price.  The last time I was here I ordered Saturday special. Steam fish with peas. Instead of rice I was able to substitute rice for mixed vegetables and spinach for no extra cost. A lot of variety in the menu. In addition to the regular menu, the Saturday menu also had oil down and fish soup, which is another favorite of mine.There's always extras to choose from daily. Which is great for Indecisive people like me that always want to try everything and especially that ""new thing on menu""The food is classic Trinidadian cuisine.

"By far the best food I've had since I moved to East Flatbush.  The man and I have had their bakes at least 3 times and tried one of the cooked entrees. The bakes are banging! We've tried bake (a couple different kinds) and salt fish, stew chicken, curry chicken and curry goat. All were really tasty, especially the salt fish and curries. The curries have a bit of a Chinese/Asian kick to them which I find interesting. We also tried their Saturday special, which was ""Oil down"" with steam fish, cassava, dumplings and pigeon peas. It was a revelation. I have no idea what I was eating (other than the fish), but it was delicious.  They are super popular, so they often run out if things... If you want something specific, may be smart to call first.Unlike many places in Flatbush, Bake and Things actually has a posted menu (gasp!), but similar to other places if you aren't familiar with Trini food, good luck having your questions answered, as the staff gives no f&cks about you or your silly  #FlatbushBakeCrawl questions. But never fear, I got you!There are multiple types of bakes, the typical fried bake and other types of baked bakes (roast bake , hops bake and coconut bake). You order a bake and then they fil it with meat, veggies stew, etc. The fried bake is the smallest bake and it's deep fried (duh). It pretty much goes with everything, but I think it goes best with drier meats toppings (saltfish, fried things) I think it gets a little soggy with the gravy. The roast bake was big and very hearty, if not a bit dry. I think it needs something with gravy to moisten it up a bit. The hops bake was good too, it was a round bun that tasted mildly of hops... I thought it was really great with the goat.  Haven't had a chance to try the coconut bake as they're always out. They'll offer you a choice of sauces ( I.e mumble ""sauce"" while not looking at you at all), what I've figured out is there's a sweet tamarind sauce and a ""shadow benney"" sauce. A nice customer explained that it's an herb that tastes similar to cilantro. Hope that helps make your newbie bake experience a bit smoother.  I love Bake and Things and can't wait to go back and try more!",5.0

"Absolutely the #1 Trinni food outside Trinidad. If you have ever experienced the morning treat of a ""double"" served from a Toyota hatchback in Port of Spain it is a dish you will crave for a very long time. You will go to great lengths to have one again; fortunately you only have to take the 5 train to Brooklyn. Minus the hatchback this is the true Trinidad experience! Right down to a number of things on the menu that were not available at the time of our visit. In Trinidad go to any restaurant and ask ""what do you have?"" first!

"If anyone is wondering where to get Caribbean food with vegan options near Flatbush Junction this is the place. There are lots of vegan places like Strictly Vegetarian several blocks North but that's a pretty long walk. And as far as I know Bake & Things is the only Trinidadian place with vegan food options or vegan roti ( three kinds when I checked). Caribbean places can be a little hit or miss because they usually have lots of different things on the menu. So odds are that one or who things might be off or the rice might be different than the way mom makes it. But the majority of dishes here are on point so if you try something you don't like come back and try again. If you've never tried ""doubles"" before BTW you are missing out. I can't speak to the meat dishes but it's hard to get vegetables spiced right so they aren't bland. If the vegan food options are this good I'm guessing the meaty options are good too.",5.0

"Never been to Trinidad but I know that this is authentic because of the customers that buy from here...  I  highly recommend the shrimp curry (real decent size shrimp), fried dumplings, curry crab, and the salt fish bake!!!!!  The ingredients they use are fresh and raw, not processed.  Will definitely return.  Also staff very pleasant!",5.0
BEST TRINI FOOD IN BROOKLYN! One bite almost makes you feel the ocean breeze. Best place to get PASTELLES that taste like home around Christmas time! It's long passed time for Bake n' things to open in a larger venue where customers can actually sit down and enjoy a good meal. If you ask me Best Bites need to close up shop and let Bake n things take over their location with some proper food!!,5.0

"Been coming here for yrs and I'm never dissatisfied. No matter the time of day the food always tastes great! Best Trini food I've had. Great selection of items compared to other Trini restaurants I've been too Their chicken roti, fried dumplings, sorrel, Pelau are my favorite menu items to add. The employees are always friendly and even though the place can get busy at times they are never rude from what I've seen. I'm sure they have a few loyal customers",5.0

"Whoa! Im literally eating the Curry Chicken Roti as we speak and it is amazeballs! The curry is not too strong, the spices are just right with a lil kick and overall its awesome! I definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to try this place. Its very filling so be ready to eat because you're going to want to finish it all! Yum! :)",5.0
"If anyone is wondering where to get Caribbean food with vegan options near Flatbush Junction this is the place. There are lots of vegan places like Strictly Vegetarian several blocks North but that's a pretty long walk. And as far as I know Bake & Things is the only Trinidadian place with vegan food options or vegan roti ( three kinds when I checked). Caribbean places can be a little hit or miss because they usually have lots of different things on the menu. So odds are that one or who things might be off or the rice might be different than the way mom makes it. But the majority of dishes here are on point so if you try something you don't like come back and try again. If you've never tried ""doubles"" before BTW you are missing out. I can't speak to the meat dishes but it's hard to get vegetables spiced right so they aren't bland. If the vegan food options are this good I'm guessing the meaty options are good too.",5.0
"Since I was a kid I have been going to bake and things, my mom live for curry and they make the best. It did not matter where in BK we lived on Friday and Saturdays we were headed there. When my mom got pregnant with my brothers it got worst, we were there like every other day lol....she made my dad miserable. Even though its small...it's very clean....great service....great staff.....and friggin awesome food.",5.0
"Curry Shrimp, chana (chickpeas), & potatoes wrapped burrito-style in a gigantic Roti?! This kind of thing is my shit! Saltfish cakes are really tasty, too. I tried my special lady's order of tender oxtail, plantains, callaloo (coconut milk spinachy dish), and rice & peas - solid choice.

"I'm going to say yes. I don't know what Trini food is like but this food is so delicious and the flavor is so different than what I associate as curry. It is actually a well stewed chicken that is fall of the bone tender. The rice and beans were different than the Costa Rica type that I enjoy and I liked this type too. I really enjoyed the rice with Callaloo which is a veggie mashed and creamed. I even enjoyed the pasta side (and if you haven't noticed, I'm not a big fan of pasta.) The people there were so friendly. They gave us a try of the various specialty drinks that the other patrons enjoyed watching us try it. Are people of Trinidad normally so friendly and nice? If this is representative of those people, then yes, they are. Clean clean clean. This place is meant for take out really, but they had just about two benches for me and my honey to try their food as eat in. No bathroom. Take out. Cash.
