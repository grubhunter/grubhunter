"Dear Brado, I'm a long time fan of thin crust pizza. Having you in my neighborhood is a dream come true. You deliver delicious super thin crust pies and I love visiting your location. My favorite time to visit is for your great happy hour deal. The staff is always very friendly, you have a great beer selection, and the millionaire bacon and mushroom toppings always make my tastebuds dance. Keep up the good work!",5.0
"Stumbled upon this place while walking back to my hotel. It has a rustic vibe and there are some tables in the front that provide for prime people watching. The servers were very attentive and gave many recommendations on food options. There were specials as well and it made my decision that much more difficult!I chose a salad and the short rib rigatoni - would highly recommend. The pasta was cooked perfectly and tasted authentic. There is nothing worse than eating Italian and tasting the packaged pasta.  I also opted for a glass of red, can't remember what it was, it wasn't very memorable but I suppose it did the job. I would suggest a better wine selection for such amazing Italian food. Next time I will try the pizzas and the desserts - FOR SURE!",4.0
"Let me start by saying that when they claim to have ""thin crust pizza"" they mean PAPER thin crust pizza...but don't let that deter you! Their ingredients are incredibly fresh tasting and loaded with flavor. I usually come here for lunch to get a house salad (which is huge!) and a mushroom slice. It will be hard to find a slice with mushrooms of this quality anywhere else in BK (really, the mushrooms are FRESH, FRESH, FRESH tasting! No canned junk here)!! I'm typically a square-slice gal (and usually cannot stand paper thin ZA), but this place is one of my favorite lunch spots on this end of Atlantic Ave.Definitely check out their lunch specials and their happy hour (YAAY to 2-for-1 GOOD draft beer--no sharing, but who the hell would want just one anyway!?)While I have really only commented on the lunch special/happy hour, the reason I am leaving 5 stars instead of four is the staff...not only is the owner friendly, personable and knowledgable, but the folks she has working there are polite, courteous and caring. Absolutely worth a visit!",5.0
"I never bookmarked this place but never had to as what they offer is memorable. Pizza is typically the best answer. And after much nachos and popcorn at the movies when we were still hungry, thin crust pizza seemed like an excellent choice. Service and wine are outstanding. We were greeted and seated right away. Our waitress was quick to give me samples of wine, a full cup practically, and offer suggestions as to her favorites as well. Their wine list focuses on those of Italian origin and I got to sample (and fall in love with) two new favorites. I like my wines dry, earthy, and zesty. These wines are carefully selected and do not disappoint.We ordered the classica and the pesce. The classica is your typical mozzarella, tomatos, and basil. When it came, I have to say I was a little let down. The crust is thinner than I'm used to. And the tomatoes are diced, not the slices of whole ones I was expecting as well. And instead of actual fresh basil leaves, they were shredded. It all come together in an underwhelming way.I'm glad we had the pesce pizza as well. By the time I sampled my boyfriend's, I had grown accustomed to this unusually thin crust. It breaks clean and snaps when you bit into it. And when this thin pizza is topped with cheese, substantial chunks of salmon, capers, and arugula, it becomes quite the satisfying meal all on its own. Their pesce pizza is delicious. We gobbled it up and got another one to go.I'd love to go back and sample other pizzas on the menu. And with such welcoming service and great wines, I'll be back soon.",4.0
"My wife and I were looking for a place to eat since Red Gravy closed (Alas, poor service did them in). We stumbled in unintentionally at happy hour, and to our pleasant surprise they had a great special involving a pizza if two or more drinks were ordered.  The pizza crust is crispy and THIN. We really enjoyed it. They have some signature pizzas, but we opted for a custom order. Since then they've added some small plates for dinner. We had a shrimp dish that was excellent. If I had a criticism, it would be that their pasta dishes are under-sauced, making them a tad dry. Other than that, an overall good experience over the numerous times we've been there. The vibe is casual, yet hipsters can be seen there. The wait staff has always been friendly and attentive. Once or twice the hostess seemed a tad aloof, but hey, she only seats you and you're done with her. I would heartily recommend Brado.",4.0
"I have ordered many times from Brado.  They have great salads and pizza for the most part is very good. My issues is with the service, in particular ordering over the phone. I was put on hold too many times, they had me repeat my credit card number three times, and then after one hour when my food did not arrive, I called back and they said they lost the order.  Had to start all over again. They were nice and didn't make me pay for part of the order.  But the reality is that when you order food you want professional phone service, organization, and prompt delivery.  If they fix this it is a 5 star place.",3.0
"I love this place - I have eaten here at least 10 times since it opened. I am not normally a fan of thin crust, but this is the best thin crust I have ever had - and its always crispy! Also love that they have an excellent selection of salads - and good sized! I find it difficult to find a place for dinner that has an entree sized salad so I am thrilled that this place came to the neighborhood.Also, place is always clean and have always had good service. Well stocked bar with a great selection of beer and liquor.Highly recommended!",5.0
I highly recommend this restaurant. The salads were huge and delicious. The pizza has a very thin crust which is so tasty and they were cooked to perfection- nice and crunchy. Prices are reasonable. They seemed to be short staffed and the staff who were working very hard were so nice and friendly even though they seemed harried. I am looking forward to going back..,5.0
"Went here for the first time a few weeks ago for lunch.  It was pretty quiet when my boyfriend and I arrived.  We got a 16"" pie of half Meat Lovers and half Tres Fuegos.  I kept telling my boyfriend how amazing the pizza tasted while we were eating - love me that crispy thin pizza. The Tres Fuegos was the perfect amount of spicy for me and a little too spicy for my boyfriend.  We also had Downeast Cider, which is now one of my favorite ciders and one that I'll be looking out for.  I love the brick wall, the rustic light fixtures, and the overall look of the bar area.  Service was good - our waiter was nice and even the bartender made sure we were accommodated even though we weren't seated at the bar.  I'm definitely looking forward to coming back here again.",5.0
"My boyfriend and I stopped in for dinner and had a great experience at Brado.  I ordered a glass of cotes du rhone and rigatoni with mushrooms as my entree, and my boyfriend ordered their chicken & mushroom carbonara dish.  Both of us really enjoyed our meals; I found the portions to be well sized, considering it was too much food for me but enough for my boyfriend.  For dessert, we took a chance on their bread pudding (it's always a chance!), and it was really delicious - order it a la mode!",4.0

"Yes the personal pizzas are wee tiny things (9~10 inches?)  Yes the crust is wafer thin, reminiscent of matzoh.  Yes 80 bucks is somewhat pricey for 3 personal pizzas, 1 crostini,  2 glasses of wine and 1 beer.   I won't even fault you for thinking ""hmmm, Domino's Thin Crust...""  But dang, this is good stuff! The Tres Fuegos is spicy, but luscious, owing to the avocado slices.  Add a little more Tres Fuegos hot sauce and get ready for a party in your mouth.  The Chickpotle consists of delicious pulled chicken, pineapple and other ingredients that deliver a smoky punch.  If you are feeling adventurous, create your own pie from scratch.  Our waitress was cheerful, and the runner who brought our dishes was downright adorable.  I left happy, but not too full. While I didn't mind, I can imagine others might find the small personal pies disappointing.",4.0
"I'm really not sure why this place has such great reviews, sort of confused...we had a horrible, disgusting experience. 1. My pulled chicken sandwich had sharp, shards of chicken bone! I was feeding it to my 3 year old. Thank goodness I got the mouthful. 2. I would have told my waitress, but she was too busy chatting with bar patrons. At one point I decided it wasn't even worth it and let the busboy take our plates away. While we waited for the kids to finish we just wanted another glass of wine - so I had to get up, and flag her down. Once I got her attention she said with such attitude, ""Do you need something?"" without even moving. 3. My son got the meat lasagna and vomited later that night. I'm guessing food poisoning but have no proof. 4. My other son got the pizza - as others mentioned it is saltine-cracker thin and I didn't find it flavorful at all. We won't be going back. If you do, stick to pizza; your life may depend on it.",1.0
"Pros. Very nice that the owners hire some of the old staff, the good ones. The food is great and that is why we come at least three time a week.Cons. Some of the staff have cheap attitude that makes you stay away even if the food is delish. After several bad experiences with the same server, I decided to write this review, (I had to ask her name) - Megan -since she toss the plate to my young son, spilling the sauce and not even apologizing. Always, she keeps the busboys and the hostess taking care of her tables while she flirts with the costumes, and god forbid if you dare to interrupt her hanging out.Overall, is a wonderful and cozy neighborhood place to eat, and we'll continue coming as long as they have welcoming, ethical staff.",2.0

"I have never been a fan of thin pizza until I tried it here. It was the most amazing pizza I have ever had in my life. My boyfriend and I started with appetizers. We ordered the bruschetta and rotella and they were both good. The food was fresh and I couldn't leave any piece behind. We ordered half meat lover and the other half pulled pork, both were great but the pulled pork was to die for!!!! Deft try it. Our waiter was so friendly she recommended us in trying the LA ice tea and it was strong and good. We ended the night with dessert which was bread pudding with a cognac cream sauce....reminded me so much of my family's take on the dessert. I will deft be back.",5.0
"So good! I love this family of restaurants and Brado is definitely up to par. The great staff here will make you feel right at home. Come for the happy hour - you will not be sorry! I mean, a free pizza with a bottle of wine or a pitcher of beer? Duh!",5.0
Had a delicious dinner here!!! My wife and I started out with the Crustini appetizer then did a large pizza of arugula white cheese and truffle oil and tres fuegos. The Crustini is my favorite. The spice from the tres fuegos hot sauce was the perfect challenge of spice. We also had nice bottle of wine and relaxed.  Can't wait to go back.,5.0
"I would give 5 stars, but the kitchen staff is beyond remedial. Their incompetence is exponential!!! I simply cannot understand why they feel the need to deviate from the customer's order, because it's simpler for them. The owner replaced a great kitchen staff with C+ (at best) replacement players. Clarence and Mary are amazing, polite and in tune with their customers.

The margherita pizza is delicious, so much so that I went back there two days in a row just to have it. I especially like the fact that almost everything used for the menu is locally sourced, and you can most certainly taste the freshness that comes with that in the food.

"Brado has burgers!  We have been regulars at the previous Ale House and now Brado. We were thrilled that the new management maintained many of the excellent staff; Mary, Clarence, Peter, and Dimetri. Although we have enjoyed the thin crust pizza and the excellent happy hour, we missed the burgers. Last night I had my first Brado burger and it was great. It is served on a house baked brioche with cheddar cheese, lettuce, and tomato. Fries are included in the $15.00 platter and a side of spicy mayo is amazing,; great for dipping the fries and for dressing the burger. My husband had the Fried Chicken sandwich and was equally satisfied. The battery fried breast was crispy but the breast was very juicy. Brado has added six new sandwiches which are available at all times at the bar and table service. They are burgers, pulled pork, pulled chicken, fried chicken, chicken Parmesan and meatball.",5.0

Miss the old Waterfront Alehouse greatly but this thin crust pizzeria fills out that old space nicely.  Thin cracker crust pizzas that remind me very much of the dear departed Lento's of Bay Ridge. 20 or so craft beers on tap along with Bud & Stella.
