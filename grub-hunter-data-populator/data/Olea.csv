"Great Place, definitely coming back - Decor:  Mediterranean gypsy - There's a wait line, but you can put your name down and then come back (15-45min wait) - Food is a mix between Italian, Spanish and Greek (def Mediterranean) - Service is great - You get the feeling that you're being rush out because they keep looking at you while you eat (I guess to see if you're finished). Totally understandable because of the huge lines.",5.0
"I've been to Olea several times for both dinner and brunch and have always enjoyed the food and ambiance. The main downside is the inevitable wait time for a table, but that's true of just about any place in New York that doesn't take reservations. (And if you want to grab a cup of coffee while you wait, Bittersweet is right around the corner.)My personal favorite brunch option is the Turkish breakfast, but just about everything looks amazing, from the polenta and eggs to the lamb hash.",4.0
"Came here this morning for breakfast.Love the gypsy/Mediterranean style decore. We sat at this corner table and I was able to put my legs up and chill. Loved it. So although the waitstaff are really nice and definitely willing to help, I found that they may have been a little pushy and too eager. My waiter asked if we're ready to order not even seconds after we had sat down. I know it's the small things that count. I just feel like he should have let us breath for a moment before jumping over to us.When we were finally ready we ordered the Green Eggs And Lamb and I ordered the Eggs over easy with homefries. We did get free refills on our coffees and the coffee was great. The food though, was pretty mediocre and not much to write about. Our bill was quite cheap. I expected it to be more being that it's in Fort Greene but pleasantly surprised. And the best part, is really the parking. Found sweet parking outside.Although I wasn't a fan of the food this time, I'm hoping to come back and try the dinner menu.",3.0
"I went in here with pretty high expectations due to what I'd heard from friends and from the wait times that I'd quoted in the past.  I'm happy to say that I was not let down at all by the experience.I went for brunch around 11:30 on a Saturday morning.  As luck would have it we only had a ten minute wait for our party of five.  There seemed to be a lot more people waiting as we were leaving, closer to 1pm.  The ambiance is adorable.  There all this cute stuff on the walls and it has a very homie feel. I sat on a bench seat by the window that was adorned with many little pillows, it was very comfortable. The wait staff is attentive without being all in yo face.By far, the best part about this place is the food.  I had the best brunch food I've ever had in my life.  I'm not exaggerating.  Everything was perfect.  I highly recommend the Lamb Hash.  It's served in a hot cast iron skillet and is smothered in sauces and fresh herbs and spices.  The Green Eggs & Lamb is also pretty good.  I had a look at the salmon Omelet and it looked amazing and my friend said it was good.  The Bloody Mary's were on point, not complaints there.  Like yea, I have had better bloody Mary's in my life, but that's only because some places put bacon and shit in them.  These are solid, they just don't go overboard.  To wrap this up, when I have friends or family visiting, this will probably be the brunch spot I take them to.  It's top of my list (for food - boozy is another brunch list).",5.0
"The food was fresh and tasty. The service was friendly and attentive, yet not clingy. The atmosphere was small, yet beautiful. It was in a great location. Overall we had just a wonderful lunch. Thanks for being so gluten accommodating!Hats off to the mimosas and falafel!",4.0
"""Vegan options???""The uncertainty in my friend's voice was very high. But I assured him that this restaurant would have options for omnivores as well. Still, it was difficult getting my Manhattan friend to trudge out of his comfortable shoebox in Hell's Kitchen and journey to Olea in the aftermath of the snowstorm.But we finally arrived, and what a delight it was! A curtain separated the harsh winter of the outside world from the interior of the restaurant. The restaurant itself could have been found on an idyllic beach on the coast of the Mediterranean. Creamy stucco walls connected with wooden slatted ceilings. The sides of the restaurant were long benches covered with myriad mismatched pillows, an ocean of softness that beckoned you to stay and fall asleep in.It was happy hour when we arrived (4pm-7pm M-F), which meant $5 wines and sangria, and cheap tapas ($2-$8). We went through several rounds this way, which is an very enjoyable way to spend the evening. My carnivorous friend ordered the garlic chicken, a stewy assemblage of medallions of chicken thigh, pureed garlic, roasted stuffing, and wilted spinach. I ordered the lamb stew (appetizer, but could easily feed someone as an entree), a curious dish whose citrus notes dominated the dish but whose addictive tender lamb I could not resist. My friend and I ended up loving each others' entrees so much we ended up switching, as eventually we were eating off one another's plates.I also tried a vegan option -- the yellow split pea soup -- and was delightfully surprised. Each of the vegetables tasted fresh and contributed bold flavors to the soup and the texture was perfect.In a world dominated by carnivores, it's refreshing to know that there's a restaurant that can unite both vegetarians/vegans and carnivores together in a beautiful space over bread and wine.",4.0
"Hands down, Olea has some of the best damn paella I've ever eaten.Olea bills itself as a Mediterranean Taverna, and their menu appears to be Greek inspired with some Spanish influence. They don't take reservations, so my party of four arrived around 9pm. The restaurant is located in a fairly residential area, and definitely has a small neighborhood vibe going on. The decor is eclectic and reminiscent of your Greek grandmother's house. There are tchotchkes and plants everywhere!My sister and her boyfriend have been here a few times, so we were happy to let them take the food and wine lead. On the menu (family style):Spanish Pitza - The quince paste really threw me off and I wasn't a fan.Sauteed Halloumi - So delicious, we sopped up every last bit of the romesco with bread.Tuscan Kale Salad - Light and bright.Cauliflower Puree - We needed more veggies.Paella con Cerdo y Pollo - The menu says you can order this with either chicken or pork, but we asked for a combo and they happily obligedPaella de Mariscos - OMG, the squid ink shrimp!A couple bottle of a spicy red from LebanonThe paella was seriously amazing and came out in super hot pans. Both paellas were loaded with goodies from the land and sea, and ridiculously flavorful. Party in your mouth! The best part was how crispy some of the rice was due to being cooked in such a hot pan, which provided a nice juxtaposition of soft and crispy bites.10/10 on the paella.",4.0
"** brunch review **I was really struck by how awesome this spot is. My friends and I snagged a table in the corner, which was comfy and let me take in the ambiance.The menu has a lot of hearty options, most with Mediterranean flair. We got a brunch special ""empanidilla"" to start, which was so delicious and came with a great dill sauce. (And I don't even like dill!) The lamb hash ($18) was really delicious and stole my heart. It comes with a great amount of shredded lamb, some root veggies, tomato jam, and a whipped goat cheese. Oh, and a poached egg. Mixed together, each bite was truly divine. My friend also got the savory, parmesan french toast - what a great concept! - which also came with nice peas and perfectly-cooked potatoes. They have a great, long-running happy hour that I think I need to come back and try for the deal and fun-yet-chill ambiance. I definitely want to try so many more items on the menu.",5.0
"Did I walk into someone's house by mistake?  Love love love the homey decor and ambiance!  I even feel the need to comment on their beautifully decorated bathroom!  They really don't skimp on attention to detail when it comes to decor!  And as much as I wanted to give this place more star power, I found that most of the food and the service was just average.The Good: - Brioche French Toast - I believe that if you're a place who can bang out a solid, simple french toast, the brunch crowd will flock and Olea knows how to do just that. - Fried Olives - yet another super simple dish Olea really knocks out of the park. So savory with each piece of olive with the creamy tzatziki to play down the saltiness and the spicy harissa to cut the fried shell. It's a dish that solidifies the phrase, ""everything is better fried!""The Average (basically everything else we had):Turkish Breakfast - a good amount of food on the plate for the price but flavor was lacking in the eggs and eggplant.  Same goes for the French Omelette.  There was a lack of seasoning in the dish and a lack of filling.  A bit disappointed.The Green Eggs with Lamb  - eggs were mediocre and under seasoned and the lamb sausage was nothing spectacular to report either.  Drinks/Dessert:The bartender was so proud of their award-winning bloody mary so of course I had to see what that was all about!  Unfortunately, I felt that it their mix was too watered down, which got more watered down with the ice - not a bloody mary to my liking.  Their red sangria is stellar though!  I highly recommend this if you're here for boozy brunchin'!For dessert, If there's creme brulee on the menu, you know I gotta try it!  This fell a bit short too.  It wasn't terrible, however the top was a bit too ""brulee-ed"".  Once you get past that, the creaminess underneath was just alright. To comment on the service, as they got progressively busier, the service also declined which was a downer.  Probably won't be back here for brunch, maaaaaybe for a try at their dinner menu though.",3.0
"Today I was in the mood for Mediterranean food and decided to go to Olea. Typically I go to Miriams on 5th avenue which I absolutely love but decided to give this beauty a whirl.The wait for a table was less than ten minutes which was pleasing. There was a bit of a wait time to place an order but nothing to cry about. I ordered the Turkish breakfast and my husband had the green eggs with lamb sausage. We then had to wait for a while for the food.We ordered a coffee and a tea; items which were not listed on the menu so it wasn't clear if they came with the meal. My tea was luke warm at best, yuck! My husband's coffee was too strong. We sat with empty cups waiting for well over ten minutes before we were asked if we wanted a refill....The food it's self was flavorful and worth the wait. I particularly enjoyed the eggs and eggplant. However, the portion was not that generous for the price.... Perhaps more eggs or another piece of pita could be included considering that the coffee and tea are not complimentary with the meal; they are $3.50.I am not sure if I will return, it wasn't horrible but at three stars there are so many other places to try. In addition I like brunch spots with an all inclusive offer.",3.0
"I came here for lunch on a sunny day--the ambiance was airy and bright with sunshine, and the decor was heavy on wood and colored tile.  Olea is kind of a chill, boho Mediterranean taverna.A few highlights:- The hearty split-pea vegetable soup was REMARKABLE.  In all caps, yes.  Topped with crisped garlic and a dollop of beet foam that sounded a little weird but worked in perfect complement to the rest, this was among the best soups I've had in recent memory.  The waiter noted the soups here, hot and cold, are all strong.- The service was exceptional.  Yes, they got my order wrong--I asked for Turkish breakfast and got a Tuna sandwich--but they offered to comp what I got and bring me the other dish. I didn't want to waste food so I just took the sandwich, which looked great, and they comped it.  This wasn't expected or necessary, but I appreciated it.Friends of mine live nearby and it's one their favorites.",4.0
"Olea is one of my favorite spots in Fort Greene for brunch, lunch, happy hour, or dinner.  It's a tiny spot with a bar space and tables inside and on the patio (weather permitting).  The food is mostly mediterranean inspired and consistently delicious and fresh.  Some of our favorites include the appetizer pitas with various dips (spicy feta, romesco, tzatziki), mixed green and lentil salad, and the lamb sandwich with the potatoes.  The owner is very sweet and a visible presence in the restaurant.  It's a great place to go on a date, as well as to meet up with friends for happy hour.  I've seen numerous (well-behaved!) children at the bar with their parents during happy hours so it seems to be kid-friendly as well!Tips:Olea is one block from Saturday's Brooklyn flea market so is a good place to grab a bite or drink before or after you explore that!$5 sangria (white or red) during happy hour (M-F, 4-7 PM) is a must-try.It can get crowded very easily during weekend dinner and brunch times...plan to get there on the early side or to have a bit of a wait!A gift card to Olea is a good last-minute gift for anyone that lives in the neighborhood...you can buy them online or at the bar.",5.0

I loved the small details such as the raspberry preserves packets in the glass jars. The pomegranate lemonade drink was good but very sour. We tried the pomegranate lemonade drink spiked with tequila but it was not as strong, possibly because the sourness overpowered the liquor.The drink menu was impressive for a brunch spot, but a little pricey.

"I went here with some friends on a Saturday night and I was really happy with the food and drinks we all choose. We had the three dip starter with hummus, and two other really tasty dips.

I had the scrambled eggs Greek style and my friend the Green Eggs and Lamb. Our portions were large (another plus in terms of brunch points) and we had no issue cleaning our plates. Tip: ask for a side of aioli and drip the home fries in it--yum. The eggs were cooked well and the filling wasn't overwhelming and blended in nicely.

Onto food...the kale salad was fantastic, especially the dressing. Lamb meatballs and lamb stew were fantastically seasoned. The artichoke falafel was probably my favorite dish, and I could have probably eaten at least 2 portions of that alone.

Really loved the vibe, the ambience, the decor, the lighting, all of it.. really set a cozy, chill mood.

I really must have, even though I ordered things folks were highly suggesting #OnHere. I uploaded pictures of what I had (presentation was lovely too) but the flavors were just.... blah!

We started our meal with this, and it seemed like all was going to be amazing.... but then, it wasn't after that. The falafel crusted artichokes were just.. not it. Way too much falafel, no texture, no exciting flavors, the dip was blah, just.. don't order it. It's a waste of space in your belly. Second round, we ordered lamb meatballs and the poutine. The meatballs came in a red marinara of sorts sauce, with another sauce over it. Everything again was bland and without a good texture- the meatballs were just very dense, dry, and not flavorful. The poutine could also have benefited from a better dressing of the other ingredients besides the fries- the duck bits were very crispy and dry. I wouldn't order any of these items again, aside from the oyster sliders. For desert, we ordered the special, which was an ice cream sundae of sorts. This was pretty delicious, and was the saving grace after a meal of disappointments.I would honestly go back again to try other items on this menu, because I loved the service and the space, just think I ordered wrong... if anyone has any suggestions, I'd love to hear them!!",3.0

Way too much falafel, no texture, no exciting flavors, the dip was blah, just.. don't order it. It's a waste of space in your belly. Second round, we ordered lamb meatballs and the poutine. The meatballs came in a red marinara of sorts sauce, with another sauce over it. Everything again was bland and without a good texture- the meatballs were just very dense, dry, and not flavorful. The poutine could also have benefited from a better dressing of the other ingredients besides the fries- the duck bits were very crispy and dry. I wouldn't order any of these items again, aside from the oyster sliders. For desert, we ordered the special, which was an ice cream sundae of sorts. This was pretty delicious, and was the saving grace after a meal of disappointments.I would honestly go back again to try other items on this menu, because I loved the service and the space, just think I ordered wrong... if anyone has any suggestions, I'd love to hear them!!",3.0

This place is really small, and the tables are spaced very closely together so you better hope your neighbors are having an interesting conversation. I ordered a skim latte, but they don't have skim milk..so instead I opted for a diet coke. Our server was Brett, he was too busy chatting with a woman sitting at the bar near the door.. To pay any attention to empty glasses, missing silverware and to bring us the check once we asked for it.I ordered the hanger steak sandwich, with potatoes and a salad. The potatoes were friend but good, salad was average, my steak was salty, way overcooked (well done/med when I asked for it med rare ) not an ounce of pink to be seen in the meat! I'm pretty sure it was 17 dollars and it was filled with gristle... How unappealing!!My mom had the cilantro eggs with potatoes, pita and roasted veggies. She was fairly happy with-the dish.  But also appalled at the service.  We had to ask twice for the check, ask for water refills , and diet coke refills, and more napkins... Maybe we could find a better time to come that doesn't inconvenience him. Needless to say, I won't be returning !",2.0

"I showed up at 5:50PM to an empty restaurant and was informed by the hostess that I could not have a table until my party was complete. I should have said I was a party of one.  The menu looked fine but I was told to wait at the bar.   I was starving, the bar stool was uncomfortable and I really just wanted to sit down and order some food.  I noticed that two people were seated at a table for 6 and when the hostess passed by I asked her how it was that she let an incomplete party sit. ""Oh they had a reservation."" Ok. I waited, my friend was delayed on the subway. When she did arrive I told her we should go somewhere else, which we did. We went to Quarter on Lafayette and had a great meal. What a stupid policy for an empty restaurant.",2.0
"I have a firm belief/philosophy in life that I try live by:""Sharing is caring.""And what's one of the best ways to share? TAPAS. Olea was brought to my attention by my co-workers. They raved about this cute eatery and its uniquely styled Mediterranean offerings... so naturally I couldn't wait to go! Inside reminds me of a combination of decorations that borders a Pier 1 Import/Antique feel. My taste in a nutshell. It was a very cozy and relaxed environment which is just what we needed after a long work week. We went early to ensure we didn't miss the happy hour specials...which are great. You can choose from a couple of wines and sangria (both white and red) for $5 each. They also have happy hours for the tapas $3-6 each and $1 oysters M-F and from 4pm-7pm.They bring you out a nice bread basket with EVOO to dip in. It was very fresh and the perfect start to our meal. As for the tapas, we ordered a bunch. The more the merrier, am I right? I'll try to be concise and highlight the best parts of each dish.-Almond Stuffed Bacon Wrapped Dates: Umm, what's not to love about Bacon? The only negative is that they should have given us more. It was an interesting pair with the dates/almonds. Crunchy and crispy.-Boquerones al Vinagre: It's a very light ""salad"" if you will. Not my favorite. But then again I'm biased since I'm not the biggest fan of anchovies (unless they're in a sauce). But the arugula and toasted almonds helped balance out that strong flavor.-Spanish 'Pitza': One of the best items of the night. It's sweet, savory, and spicy in one. It's a crispy thin pizza with quince paste, Manchego, toasted garlic and red pepper. Side note...If you haven't had Manchego cheese, you're missin' out in life! -Fried Chickpeas: I'd like to think of it textually-like wasabi peas. Pretty good.-Patatas Bravas: My friend called this the ""fancier version of cheesy fiesta potatoes*"". Which I laughed at. This is a killer side dish. The thing that makes it is the harissa aioli. Yum.-Harissa-Deviled Organic Eggs: Good. Spicy. But nothing special IMO.-Grilled Whole Wheat Pita with Spicy Feta Dip: The dip was very creamy and fluffy. I liked the unique twist of the added heat. From what I've seen their brunch is pretty popular as well. So I can't wait to try that soon. But speaking for their dinner experience, it was a pleasant one. The staff was friendly, attentive and patient while we pick our tapas. And of course the food was pretty darn good! At a place like this, try as much as your wallet can allow. (Happy hour certainly helps!!!) I'll definitely be back to have the full brunch experience.____________________________________*Really? You're comparing this place to Tbell? Shameee.",4.0

"I showed up at 5:50PM to an empty restaurant and was informed by the hostess that I could not have a table until my party was complete. I should have said I was a party of one.  The menu looked fine but I was told to wait at the bar.   I was starving, the bar stool was uncomfortable and I really just wanted to sit down and order some food.  I noticed that two people were seated at a table for 6 and when the hostess passed by I asked her how it was that she let an incomplete party sit. ""Oh they had a reservation."" Ok. I waited, my friend was delayed on the subway. When she did arrive I told her we should go somewhere else, which we did. We went to Quarter on Lafayette and had a great meal. What a stupid policy for an empty restaurant.",2.0
"I have a firm belief/philosophy in life that I try live by:""Sharing is caring.""And what's one of the best ways to share? TAPAS. Olea was brought to my attention by my co-workers. They raved about this cute eatery and its uniquely styled Mediterranean offerings... so naturally I couldn't wait to go! Inside reminds me of a combination of decorations that borders a Pier 1 Import/Antique feel. My taste in a nutshell. It was a very cozy and relaxed environment which is just what we needed after a long work week. We went early to ensure we didn't miss the happy hour specials...which are great. You can choose from a couple of wines and sangria (both white and red) for $5 each. They also have happy hours for the tapas $3-6 each and $1 oysters M-F and from 4pm-7pm.They bring you out a nice bread basket with EVOO to dip in. It was very fresh and the perfect start to our meal. As for the tapas, we ordered a bunch. The more the merrier, am I right? I'll try to be concise and highlight the best parts of each dish.-Almond Stuffed Bacon Wrapped Dates: Umm, what's not to love about Bacon? The only negative is that they should have given us more. It was an interesting pair with the dates/almonds. Crunchy and crispy.-Boquerones al Vinagre: It's a very light ""salad"" if you will. Not my favorite. But then again I'm biased since I'm not the biggest fan of anchovies (unless they're in a sauce). But the arugula and toasted almonds helped balance out that strong flavor.-Spanish 'Pitza': One of the best items of the night. It's sweet, savory, and spicy in one. It's a crispy thin pizza with quince paste, Manchego, toasted garlic and red pepper. Side note...If you haven't had Manchego cheese, you're missin' out in life! -Fried Chickpeas: I'd like to think of it textually-like wasabi peas. Pretty good.-Patatas Bravas: My friend called this the ""fancier version of cheesy fiesta potatoes*"". Which I laughed at. This is a killer side dish. The thing that makes it is the harissa aioli. Yum.-Harissa-Deviled Organic Eggs: Good. Spicy. But nothing special IMO.-Grilled Whole Wheat Pita with Spicy Feta Dip: The dip was very creamy and fluffy. I liked the unique twist of the added heat. From what I've seen their brunch is pretty popular as well. So I can't wait to try that soon. But speaking for their dinner experience, it was a pleasant one. The staff was friendly, attentive and patient while we pick our tapas. And of course the food was pretty darn good! At a place like this, try as much as your wallet can allow. (Happy hour certainly helps!!!) I'll definitely be back to have the full brunch experience.____________________________________*Really? You're comparing this place to Tbell? Shameee.",4.0

"40 minute wait for breakfast. Rude staff. Wouldn't modify my order despite having everything I asked for, just refused to do it. When my eggs came they were burnt. When the rude waiter asked if everything was ok, he didn't even wait for an answer. Had to raise my voice to call him back and say ""actually, no"" which I much rather would not have done while sitting knee to knee sandwiched between two other tables like we were in a sardine can.

"We arrived around 8pm on a Friday night and were seated promptly. The beef meatballs and the Spanish pitza were the highlights of the meal. The poutine fries were a little on the salty side and I wished the fries were a thicker cut instead of stick skinny potato pieces that I needed to eat 8 of at a time to balance out the sauce. We ordered a medium rare steak that was a little more of the rare side - nothing special. I wasn't that hungry so I ordered the arugula salad that came with goat cheese croquettes - nothing to write home about either. There wasn't much else to the salad except for a lot of arugula and it wasn't that fresh. It barely had any pear or candied pistachios or even salad dressing for that matter. Quite the disappointment. Most people probably didn't realize the quality of the salad because 1. They were drunk 2. The lighting was so dim you could barely see what you were eating or 3. They were smart enough to not order that dish in the first place! The Oleopolitan - Olea's take on the cosmo - was not good because I was expecting the flavors to somewhat resemble that of a cosmo but it was way off. I had to force it down because I hate wasting alcohol. I believe the dessert I got was the creme brulee. It had a nice caramelized crust but the custard was more liquid and soft like pudding, which made me question if I had indeed ordered the right dish. I'm not sure if it was undercooked or if that's just their take on the creme brulee....The other couple that we dined with ordered the branzino and the chicken which they enjoyed.

"If you're seeking delicious, Mediterranean cuisine in a charming environment, pay a visit to Olea Mediterranean Taverna in Fort Green, Brooklyn. The restaurant's aesthetic is warm, cozy, and has influences from Spain, Greece, Italy, and the rest of the Mediterranean. They have a great menu, with lots of options. If you're one who has a tough time settling on one item, they have a great tapas menu with a nice variety. I ordered the Swordfish (pan-roasted steak, butternut puree, crispy cannellini beans, Persian tapenade). This dish was awesome. The swordfish was cooked wonderfully, tender, and flavorful. Not to mention, the portion was generous. I really loved the butternut puree, it was creamy, sweet and citrusy, complimenting the other textures in the dish really nicely. The crispy cannellini beans were also excellent, slightly fried on the outside, but the inside melts in your mouth.Along with the great service, you also get a little chocolate at the end of your meal with the bill.

"Hands down my FAVORITE restaurant in all of Brooklyn. Their happy hour is a great way to try out the menu, but it won't take long for you to decide you love the everything they serve.

I've had all three paellas, and they are all fantastic. My favorite things on the menu are probably the bacon wrapped dates, the romesco dip, and goat cheese croquettes. Hang out with the bartender Thomas and he can describe in detail pretty much every dish.

"My friends came up to visit and decided to grab brunch after exploring the Brooklyn flea. This place is less than a block away, and surprisingly, it wasn't too bad of a wait. At around 2-3 PM, it was only a 30 minute wait. The host was nice and kept an eye out for us, even though we decided to walk around in the crisp air for the duration of our wait. There were also stools they put outside that we rested on after we came back from our walk.We were seated in a cozy corner of the place - it was a bench/booth with lots of cushions and pillows. Other than a random fly buzzing around, it was extremely comfortable. We were seated and told immediately that they had run out of the lamb hash (nooo!) and the tzatziki dip, which was disappointing. We instead ordered savory parmesan toast, and green eggs and lamb. The toast was more like a take on eggs benedict sans meat, which I didn't mind at all. It was delicious and extremely filling, especially with the potatos. The green eggs and lamb were also great - the cilantro infused scrambled eggs were refreshingly different, and now I'm wondering why I didn't always put cilantro in my scrambled eggs. The lamb sausage was also great, but I was a little sad that they had run out of the lamb hash.I also ordered a white-mango sangria, which was strong and delicious - but there was no sign of mango - just a few chunks of apples. Who cares though, it's only $5!This is so conveniently located and is a really cute brunch spot. I want to check it out for their dinner menu, since their brunch was more creative and well done compared to other Mediterranean brunches I've been to.",4.0

"I don't normally come to Fort Greene, but a friend invited me to brunch so I rode my bike over. I was pleasantly surprised! I'm very picky when it comes to brunch. Most restaurants just serve your typical omelettes. Not so at Olea. We both ordered Turkish eggs and goat cheese croquettes.The goat cheese croquettes were crispy and lightly battered and all warm and gooey on the inside. My only problem with them is that I only got 3! For the same price the Turkish eggs was a full plate of eggs, pita, eggplant salad, and herb yogurt. YUMMM!!If I could take off 1/2 a point for our strange waiter I would. The place was loud (as brunch spots often are) and he was basically whispering. I don't want to sound mean but he was a little odd.",5.0
"I've never eaten anything here that was short of delicious. While I've had dinner at the bar, Olea's brunch is my favorite, and I find myself craving it every few weeks. The waits are often long, but if you have the time to spare, it's so worth it. My boyfriend and I went for brunch and shared two dishes that became my all-time favorites. We shared the Brooklyn-made ricotta with fruit preserves and almonds, served with warm pita. I'm not generally a ricotta or even cheese enthusiast, but this dish was a game changer. The ricotta was ethereally creamy, and the fruit added just enough sweetness and the almonds just enough texture. Contrasted with the warm pita, it was an insanely good bite of food. While the serving of ricotta is quite large, it was labeled as a smaller plate, so we also shared the lamb hash, which is a main. This thing could feed a family, and that's saying a lot coming from me, as we can EAT. It comes out in a huge, hot skillet, and is filled with the tenderest lamb, tomatoes, root vegetables, and topped with eggs.

"This place is so darn good. Never a bad dish.

"This place does not need another great review but you need to know that it is definitely a place you should check out. The dinner menu looked amazing and we were excited, but we went with friends and just got caught up in their amazing, I'm saying it again, amazing appetizers. We started with the brussel sprouts (and if you are one of those people who's childhood ruined these delicious veggies for give it another chance, I promise you won't be disappointed), grilled pita with three dips: Roasted Beet Skordalia, Hummus and Romesco, (we had to keep asking for pita bread), Lamb Kefteddes, and the Patatas Bravas. We were loving the tapas theme we had started so we ordered more Patatas Bravas, mushrooms, and some items off of the daily menu (which i can't remember right now, but trust me it was delicious.

"Just no.  The food here is a mishmosh of mediterranean food.  It does not focus on one particular mediterranean cuisine - it's trying to be too much.  The flavors are all wrong used in their dishes.  It's like a hipster restaurant trying to be fancy, trying to put a ""spin"" on classic mediterranean dishes and it just does not work.  The flavors are trying to be complex, but they would do better with simpler dishes, with fewer ingredients.  Chicken tagine and lamb sausage barley salad were not good.  Their tagine is not authentic.  Salad and chicken dish had no level of flavor and just tasted the same, every bite became more boring than the next.",1.0
"My friends came up to visit and decided to grab brunch after exploring the Brooklyn flea. This place is less than a block away, and surprisingly, it wasn't too bad of a wait. At around 2-3 PM, it was only a 30 minute wait. The host was nice and kept an eye out for us, even though we decided to walk around in the crisp air for the duration of our wait. There were also stools they put outside that we rested on after we came back from our walk.We were seated in a cozy corner of the place - it was a bench/booth with lots of cushions and pillows. Other than a random fly buzzing around, it was extremely comfortable. We were seated and told immediately that they had run out of the lamb hash (nooo!) and the tzatziki dip, which was disappointing. We instead ordered savory parmesan toast, and green eggs and lamb. The toast was more like a take on eggs benedict sans meat, which I didn't mind at all. It was delicious and extremely filling, especially with the potatos. The green eggs and lamb were also great - the cilantro infused scrambled eggs were refreshingly different, and now I'm wondering why I didn't always put cilantro in my scrambled eggs. The lamb sausage was also great, but I was a little sad that they had run out of the lamb hash.I also ordered a white-mango sangria, which was strong and delicious - but there was no sign of mango - just a few chunks of apples. Who cares though, it's only $5!This is so conveniently located and is a really cute brunch spot. I want to check it out for their dinner menu, since their brunch was more creative and well done compared to other Mediterranean brunches I've been to.",4.0

"I don't normally come to Fort Greene, but a friend invited me to brunch so I rode my bike over. I was pleasantly surprised! I'm very picky when it comes to brunch. Most restaurants just serve your typical omelettes. Not so at Olea. We both ordered Turkish eggs and goat cheese croquettes.The goat cheese croquettes were crispy and lightly battered and all warm and gooey on the inside. My only problem with them is that I only got 3! For the same price the Turkish eggs was a full plate of eggs, pita, eggplant salad, and herb yogurt. YUMMM!!If I could take off 1/2 a point for our strange waiter I would. The place was loud (as brunch spots often are) and he was basically whispering. I don't want to sound mean but he was a little odd.",5.0
"I've never eaten anything here that was short of delicious. While I've had dinner at the bar, Olea's brunch is my favorite, and I find myself craving it every few weeks. The waits are often long, but if you have the time to spare, it's so worth it. My boyfriend and I went for brunch and shared two dishes that became my all-time favorites. We shared the Brooklyn-made ricotta with fruit preserves and almonds, served with warm pita. I'm not generally a ricotta or even cheese enthusiast, but this dish was a game changer. The ricotta was ethereally creamy, and the fruit added just enough sweetness and the almonds just enough texture. Contrasted with the warm pita, it was an insanely good bite of food. While the serving of ricotta is quite large, it was labeled as a smaller plate, so we also shared the lamb hash, which is a main. This thing could feed a family, and that's saying a lot coming from me, as we can EAT. It comes out in a huge, hot skillet, and is filled with the tenderest lamb, tomatoes, root vegetables, and topped with eggs. This is one of those things you can't stop eating, even after you're so full you feel like you're gonna explode, because it's so addictive. That said, we did have leftovers. It's an amazing value, as you'll definitely get a few meals out of it. When the weather is nice, it's a great place to eat outdoors, and it's just across from the Fort Greene Brooklyn Flea.

The two entrees that we got were the lamb hash and green eggs.      The honey lemonade was just alright, not that special. But the ricotta cheese was excellent. It was creamy and milky. The grape molasses was a bit too much compared the amount of ricotta cheese they gave you. Anyway, it's like heaven when you bit on to that warm pita bread with the cheese and molasses and almonds. I wished thaf they could gave more almonds too.       The green eggs was very interesting and refreshing. The scrambled eggs was just the right tender texture but it could be a little bland to some. The lamb hash was a killer. There's so much lamb meat in this dish with potatoes, green peas and tomatoes. The crispy bottom was just so good. Tasted like chips.

"There are many reasons to love Olea, but the thing that makes me happiest about the fact that it's in my hood is that it's good for so many different occasions: happy hour dates, girls' brunch, dinner with the folks, lunchtime laptopping...it somehow feels comfortable for all of these things, which is rare.And the food! It's consistent and delicious! I think it's best to share some of the Mediterranean tapas and perhaps a salad or main. If you're there for dinner, don't miss the brussels sprouts. I know, brussels are the new black. But these are crispy and flavorful and magically delicious. I could eat them by the pickle-barrel-full. The haloumi cheese over romescu sauce is a hit, too.Brunch is also great. I'm partial to the fresh, elegant, and tasty Savory Parmesan French Toast with peas.

"What a great little restaurant tucked into an otherwise residential part of Fort Greene. I came here for dinner with a girlfriend on a Tuesday and we were seated right away. The decor is charming and has plenty of personality - the bar is decorated with ornate mosaic Spanish tiles, high ceilings and livened up even more with big potted palms beside a few of the tables. I had a few of the Oleopolitan cocktails, which were delicious and refreshing. I love the tapas style menu so you can sample a bunch of different things, but they also have big entrees if you're looking for something more hearty. The paellas were calling out to me, but we didn't want to over-order - another dish for another time. We ended up sharing the Spanish poutine, falafel crusted artichoke hearts, salmon rillettes, and Tuscan kale salad. Great sized portions! I loved their take on classic poutine - the gravy was creamy and well-spiced, and the crispy pieces of chorizo on top added a nice crunch. The falafel crusted artichoke hearts were a nice unique dish, and the kale salad was simple but tasty with tangy grated pecorino cheese and toasty pine nuts. The salmon rillettes, a special that night, were delicious! The big salmon chunks were seasoned in a nice lemony yet creamy sauce, and they were served with fresh sliced cucumbers and toasted pita triangles.For all this food and three drinks each, the bill came out to $50 each which was totally reasonable considering we probably had about $30 in drinks alone.

I went in November so it was a tad chilly, but it was all the more toasty when we got inside. There was a sweet classical guitar player plucking away at a perfect volume. It's the most wonderful date spot. The bacon wrapped dates were delicious, but too small and too few. The artichoke hearts with felafel were alright, but I would skip next time in favor of trying all their different shrimp dishes. We had the Spanish shrimp and I spent the entire meal just dipping other things into the sauce. Brussel sprouts in that sauce were jaw dropping. And their lovely simple bread soaked with the sauce from the shrimp could have been the entire meal and I'd have been thrilled. It's not cheap to get yourself filled, but it's worth it. Next time I might have to come for happy hour.",5.0
"This place has a crazy wait, but once you're inside everyone is chill and super friendly. The menu has a great selection and the food is good enough that I actually didn't mind waiting so long for a table - and that's from someone who thinks its almost never worth waiting. I got the green eggs and lamb and it was fantastic. You wait for the bathroom almost as long as you wait for a table, but such is life in NYC.",4.0
Lamb meatballs in a spicy tomato sauce with whipped feta and mint!!!! This was meatball CRACK! Meatball NIRVANA!!! Hands down the tastiest balls I've ever had in my mouth! I'd propose marriage to those balls if they came with legs! LOL,5.0
"I went to Olea with a friend, and found this little unassuming restaurant to be quite a pleasant surprise. We ordered a bunch of small plates. Nothing was bad but there were a few standouts. The brussel sprouts were so delicious- crispy, salty, and a little sweet with some honey glaze. I was worried that the honey would make the dish too sweet for my liking but I found it to be very balanced. The goat cheese croquettes were similarly very tasty and balanced. I found the food to be inventive but simple and very satisfying. The service was good- attentive but not overbearing.  The atmosphere was intimate, but with a good hum of lively conversation and ambient music. I definitely recommend this restaurant for dinner with a friend or a date. Not good for big groups or families with young children.",4.0
"Such a lovely community spot for dinner. The happy hour deals are great -- we had the meatballs, pita/hummus, and bacon-wrapped dates. The latter were my fave, and definitely an excellent starter.

"Should be 3.5 stars. Have been for dinner several times, and overall it's a solid restaurant in the neighborhood! Great food. Service is consistent. The Sangria Marinated Hanger Steak tapas dish is delicious, as are the patatas bravas, goat cheese croquettes, and Greek meatballs.BUT. The pita is the worst. Tastes like it was bought at a supermarket. Also, take out is great, but dining-in is much better.Note to owners: Get better pita.",3.0

Portion is huge here comparing to other places I tried. Price according to my friend is reasonable or usual relative to NYC standard. I was here on a Saturday morning brunch early around 11am and the place is pretty empty. I love the fact they have plenty of cushion on the bench and a lot of mini tree and flower all over. It's a tropical forest indoor. There are 4 outdoor table for 2's but we decided to be inside. The waiter is ok but a little rush in the end. Best part is the free coffee refills to wake me up but it's the food that got me. Very strong on the flavor and huge portion that kept me going all day. I even skipped dinner. I think they over stuff my dish with potato instead of more lamb. le sigh. Over all great experience and place to come back again.,4.0

"The food here is outstanding. Another treasure found on a cozy corner in Clinton HIll. The vibe is chill/relaxing breezy atmosphere, perfect for the spring/summer time. We had the brussel sprouts w/ honey and chili. Wow, just wow.  I could've had the whole plate to myself and had that as single my entree, but there were a handful of things on the menu we had to try. If you're a hummus fan then you'll be pleased with the hummus plate.  It  seemed overwhelming at first w/ the amount of pita & different hummus flavors, but we cleaned that up pretty well. Also do not miss out on the bacon wrapped dates appetizer, serving complemented well w/ the brussel sprouts.

I wish I lived closer so I had an excuse to stop by more often. The wait for brunch is not unreasonable and the prices are great.

"Just as the 5 star rating says... Woohoo! As good as it gets!Been to Olea twice. Both times with the same person.

The Turkish Breakfast has everything you would want from the Mediterranean - scrambled eggs with cilantro, fatuous, eggplant, herbed yogurt and grilled pita bread. Though a vegetarian's dream, it satisfied this meat lover's tummy. A friend ordered the special, Lamb Hash, which I'm sure has been a special more than a few times. And why not? It's pretty darn good. Tried a couple of bites and the flavor is just amazing. The lamb is done exactly right. No gaminess and the cumin just jumps right at you. Combined with the over-easy eggs, it's perfect. The service is impeccable. The after-meal chocolates are the perfect after-meal treats. Can't wait to come back again!",5.0
"Great neighborhood brunch spot.  I actually live like a block away but it took me several months to discover Olea; not until the NY Marathon when I was scoping a place to watch the runners.  I would say the brunch food is actually only so-so--the eggs tend to be somewhat overcooked, and the bloody mary was small, but I ate lunch here with my family and the soup was actually quite spectacular.  It was some sort of butternut squash puree with spicy fried corn nuts as a garnish.  We also got a hummus appetizer to split which was great.  And apparently they have a $oyster happy hour, which one day i will check out if I ever find myself in my 'hood early on a weeknight.",4.0

"Second time I went there, and really solidified my impression that the food here is varied, flavorful, creative, and satisfying. Loved how the hummous and beet spread come with either bread or endive; great pea soup; so many vegetarian and wheat-free options. Also appreciate that you can get a small glass of beer rather than (if you're not a big drinker) an expensive one with much more beer than you could ever drink.

Worst way to sell something and we obviously didn't get it. She was like that the whole night, even after we decided that she might just be having a bad day, and tried to be super nice to her.

"Came here with a couple of friends for brunch and there was a wait, but it was well worth it. We started with ricotta with grape molasses and sliced almonds with pita, which everyone just devoured. We also had lamb meatballs, which were very flavorful. For mains we had a Spanish omelette, a Spanish sandwhich, and the lamb hash. I was most surprised by how well constructed and delicious the sandwich was. Im not a big fan of sandwiches, but i can have this one every day. The lamb hash on a cast iron skillet was a very generous portion and absolutely outstanding. With all these other great choices, the omelette was good, but didn't stand out.

"Too good to be less than five stars, classic Mediterranean.  I focus on the tapas and raw bar and appetizers: fried olives, halloumi cheese, anchovies. And for entrees: char or Bronzino or steak. Personally I find the paellas to be too artsy, with burnt rice and too little fish or meat. I'd recommend that they look to the classic preparation here. Very nice brunch: green eggs and lamb. Very good service. Way too busy, unless you get there at brunch opening time or slightly off peak dinner time.",5.0

"I'm a big bruncher. That is to say, I've been to a lot of brunch spots all over the country. The experience I had at Olea was by far the best I have ever had. Service: Our waiter was incredibly professional and courteous the whole time. 2 of us changed our minds about our food/drink order and he changed it right away without complaint. Drinks: they have an entire array of mimosa flavors, from mango to pomegranate! They also have brunch drink specials - I got the Aperol spritzer which they make with mango purée. That was my favorite!Food: best for last. I ordered the Brioche French toast, which melts in your mouth and is a welcome sweet treat next to all of the incredible savory dishes they have. Speaking of, though I didn't order this, I demolished the LAMB HASH. I literally almost fell over when I tried this. Hands down, the BEST brunch entree my mouth ever tasted! It was presented in a very authentically Moroccan style with the food in the pan. Each egg had an incredible white cheese and was topped with a Muhammara sauce that added a little spice. It's not until you get to the bottom of this masterpiece where you have the real treat - mounds of tender, juicy spiced lamb mixed with this cheese and seasoned potatoes.

I'm sorry to have to update this review.... But I was there tonight and I have to say it was some if the worst service I have ever had....  They brought all of our food out at the same time... Appetizers and main meal. The staff kept congregating and not paying attention of what was going on in the restaurant. It took forever to even get a drink refill. We went there for a special occasion because our past experience there was amazing!!! Then we realized.. The last time we were there the owner was there.... Maybe that is the difference? I have to say the food was still great... Even when our entree sat around for 30 min while we finish our apps.,3.0
"Came here with a couple of friends for brunch and there was a wait, but it was well worth it. We started with ricotta with grape molasses and sliced almonds with pita, which everyone just devoured. We also had lamb meatballs, which were very flavorful. For mains we had a Spanish omelette, a Spanish sandwhich, and the lamb hash. I was most surprised by how well constructed and delicious the sandwich was. Im not a big fan of sandwiches, but i can have this one every day. The lamb hash on a cast iron skillet was a very generous portion and absolutely outstanding. With all these other great choices, the omelette was good, but didn't stand out. I can't wait to come back here for dinner and try the lamb stew.",5.0
"I live an avenue away from this place. I love it. They never disappoint! Their tapas are so yummy!! Some of my favorites are grilled sangria hanger steak, brussel sprouts, halloumi cheese, meatballs, the pita and dips. Go with a friend and try their tapas. I think on Tues nights, they have a spanish guitarist also. My only negative is the long wait!",5.0
"One of the best meals from a restaurant in a long while. Lamb hash was about as perfect a brunch fare as you can imagine. The Persian spread was tart and tempting as well. Staff is always friendly despite having to nearly bowl over people since it's such a narrow place, but that's part of the ambiance.",4.0

EAT HERE! Give them your money and be thankful.P.S. Ignore the desserts and coffee. Okay but not great.",5.0
"Too good to be less than five stars, classic Mediterranean.  I focus on the tapas and raw bar and appetizers: fried olives, halloumi cheese, anchovies. And for entrees: char or Bronzino or steak. Personally I find the paellas to be too artsy, with burnt rice and too little fish or meat. I'd recommend that they look to the classic preparation here. Very nice brunch: green eggs and lamb. Very good service. Way too busy, unless you get there at brunch opening time or slightly off peak dinner time.",5.0

"I'm a big bruncher. That is to say, I've been to a lot of brunch spots all over the country. The experience I had at Olea was by far the best I have ever had. Service: Our waiter was incredibly professional and courteous the whole time. 2 of us changed our minds about our food/drink order and he changed it right away without complaint. Drinks: they have an entire array of mimosa flavors, from mango to pomegranate! They also have brunch drink specials - I got the Aperol spritzer which they make with mango purée. That was my favorite!Food: best for last. I ordered the Brioche French toast, which melts in your mouth and is a welcome sweet treat next to all of the incredible savory dishes they have. Speaking of, though I didn't order this, I demolished the LAMB HASH. I literally almost fell over when I tried this. Hands down, the BEST brunch entree my mouth ever tasted! It was presented in a very authentically Moroccan style with the food in the pan. Each egg had an incredible white cheese and was topped with a Muhammara sauce that added a little spice. It's not until you get to the bottom of this masterpiece where you have the real treat - mounds of tender, juicy spiced lamb mixed with this cheese and seasoned potatoes. We all nearly abandoned our own meals so we can have more of the lamb hash.I would come back to NYC just to have another brunch at Olea!",5.0

The bacon wrapped dates were amazing but to be expected. As I mentioned to my friend I find that one can't judge a restaurant on bacon wrapped dates because that dish is just amazing. Always. The fish fingers were extremely fishy and almost inedible though the crust was perfectly fried and the tartar was a must if you were gonna swallow these bad boys. This leaves the falafel artichokes great in concept but, not so great in actuality. The thick falafel crust took away from the artichokes and just wasn't a great combination in my opinion.Overall, this is a solid spot and if I happened to be in the neighborhood wouldn't be opposed to trying an entree and enjoy the space and wine but, overall wasn't a great start Olea.",3.0

We had the fried olives, lamb meatballs, a spanish style poutine (a special that evening), fried brussels sprout and a great bottle of Lambrusco.

The perfect place for a birthday dinner - low key but not too low key, sophisticated but not stuffy, and just all around very very pleasant.

"Cute weekday spot where you can walk in for a table. Happy hour specials are great. For a table of 3, we ordered tapas for dinner and a couple round of drinks for about $26 each! Service was random and based on unique servers. Most of the guys were very friendly and quick to serve. One waiter was a lot more curt than the others and kept cutting us off as we were ordering (trying to take our menus, okaying us as if the order was complete). It got to the point where we had to ask him if he thought we were ordering too many dishes (he said no). Food highlights:Shishito peppers were on their day's special menu but hopefully they make it on the permanent one. They were perfectly cooked with just the right amount of coarse sea salt. YUM!Fish Fingers were also delicious. Juicy and not too breaded. And of course, the oysters. A little small, but for $1/oyster, they were pretty fresh and delicious. Mehs:Fried oyster sandwiches were kind of boring. I couldn't taste the oysters... just the sauce (which was tasty though), carrots and the breading around the oysters. Tzatziki dip was also another bore. I'm usually a fan of whole wheat pitas but for some reason it did not go well with this dip. Perhaps they was too dry...

"Olea may be a small little Mediterranean restaurant in Brooklyn but, it definitely delivers a big taste. I don't know about the dinner entrees but, this place is awesome for happy hour with a large tapas menu and delicious sangria!Between my sister and I, we ordered 8 tapas (seriously 8 tapas is a sh*t ton of food..I got carried away and wanted to try everything :/ ) and were pleasantly pleased with all of them. The MEMORABLE:1. Roasted Beet Skordalia with Pita -- delicious skordalia with a hint of sweetness from the beets, great way to get your appetite going!2. Fish Fingers -- fancy fish sticks! This dish was made with salmon and it was lightly crusted, so good and definitely worth the happy hour price ($6!). 3. Lamb Kefta Meatballs -- YUM! I love meatballs in a rich tomato sauce! The lamb wasn't very gamey and the dish came with 3 hefty meatballs!4. Peashoot salad -- YES. Everything about this salad was delicious. It was so simple with just peashoots, celery, walnuts and blue cheese but, with the dressing, everything just WORKED.5. Fried Green Olives -- My sister and I were back and forth on this one. We both love olives but, I thought this dish need some more tatziki sauce to balance out the salty brine from the olives.The IN-BETWEEN:6. Oysters -- super cheap during happy hour but, not as fresh as we would have liked7. Mushroom and Goat Cheese Crostini -- This was actually really good but, the dish left something to be desired. I think it could have used a good drizzle of balsamic vinegar..it was worth trying though!The NOT-SO-GOOD:8. Spanish Pizza -- we didn't like this AT ALL. I feel like it would have been really good, but our pizza came out with so much sea salt on top as a garnish that it really did just take over the whole dish. It left us thirsty and killed our tastebuds!For 8 dishes and a glass a sangria? Only $50!!! We left the place STUFFED. Like uncomfortably full so, I'm sure a table to two can get away with happy stomachs for even cheaper. Cheers!",4.0

"In a word: DELICIOUS! I had a business lunch here the other day and a colleague recommended the lentil soup. Lentil soup is good but usually nothing to get excited about. However, Olea's lentil soup comes with a ton of fresh, chunky veggies like carrots, turnips, potatoes, and celery, along with a big chunk of garlic-beet dip. It was excellent.I also tried a few of the tapas, including the garlic-beet dip with pita bread (very good, but very garlicky), and the falafel-fried artichoke hearts, which were excellent. The latter were artichoke hearts, dipped in falafel batter and deep fried. It came over a bed of sauteed eggplant and tomatoes, which was excellent. I also tried my colleague's harrisa roasted potatoes, which were quite tasty.The food was all good, reasonably priced, and the service was friendly, although it took quite some time to get our bill.",4.0
"I really really really really love Olea. I take my best of best there for drinks and dinner. I usually have the amaze-ball eggs, meatballs, and finish with the branzino. Last night was no different.

"Had brunch here last weekend and thoroughly enjoyed it.The wait was quoted at 15 minutes but seemed more like half an hour for a party of 4.  The small and cozy space is a hot brunch location for local Brooklynites.  The staff was friendly and the food delicious.I ordered the bloody marissa named after a waitstaff who happened to be our waitress.  She was great but the bloody mary wasn't my favorite.  I asked for it extra spicy but it just seemed to have a lot of horseradish.  For brunch I chose the Turkish breakfast with eggs scrambled with cilantro, tomato and red onion, fattoush, eggplant salad, herbed yogurt and grilled pita bread.  I cleaned my plate, that's for sure!The others in my party ordered the savory parmesan french toast, and some scrambled concoction which they enjoyed.  We had a leisurely brunch and were not pressured by staff to leave despite a healthy line.  Once we left around 2 the crowd had dwindled.  Sidewalk sales nearby and local markets make this neighborhood vibrant and gems like Olea perfect for a local bite to eat.",4.0
"Great service, delicious food. If you like to taste a lot of different dishes, share 3-4 small plates with a friend. Particularly like the keftedes (lamb meatballs),  falafel-crusted artichokes, and paella.",5.0
I love Olea's food and atmosphere. I have tired most of their appetizer's and salads and they are all great. It's pretty hard to get a table here even in the middle of the week but if you do score a table you're guaranteed a delicious meal. I love that they use Juve Y Camps in their mimosas. Cava is my favorite!,4.0
Great neighborhood place. The happy hour tapas is a nice deal.  The staff is very nice and accommodating and it is a friendly crowd. The food is great overall but some of the dishes are a bit overwrought and would be better with a simpler preparation (I'm looking at you fried artichokes and halloumi cheese plates),4.0
"I heart Olea.  Olea for brunch is excellent!  I've been to Olea for tapas and drinks, and while I did enjoy the tasty anchovies, the patatas bravas, delicious olives and bacon-wrapped dates, the brunch is the best.The first time I had brunch here was with my boyfriend. It was a bustling weekend morning, but since there were two of us and not an odd or larger number, we were seated immediately.  I had the French omelet with brie, smoked salmon and leeks, and he had the Spanish with chorizo, manchego and piquillo peppers.  The French omlet was delicious and the bite I had of the Spanish omlet was quite tasty.  The omelets are served with well-flavored, perfectly salted homefries, a nice salad and a soft, crusty piece of French bread with butter and jam.  Yum! I enjoyed every bite of my meal that day and knew then, that I would be back for brunch!I recently had brunch at Olea, this time with a girlfriend.  We waited maybe ten minutes for our table.  Again the restaurant was bustling, a lot of couples, one or two families, larger groups, definitely an interesting crowd.I had the green eggs and lamb and my friend had her usual, the Greek omelet.  She loved her order of course, apparently she eats it everything and she has brunch there often.  The green eggs and lamb were beyond good.  The eggs were cooked perfectly with this delicious blend of cilantro, tomato and red onion.  The lamb sausage was out of this world.  Mmmm just thinking about it.  The accompanying pita wedges were chewy and delicious.  I'm not much of a pita eater, but those were the best I've had.We both had bloody marys with our brunch and our drinks were very tasty.  I will be back.  This is my kind of brunch spot.  The food was tasty and unique.  I want to try everything on the menu.  And maybe I will...",5.0
"Olea may be a small little Mediterranean restaurant in Brooklyn but, it definitely delivers a big taste. I don't know about the dinner entrees but, this place is awesome for happy hour with a large tapas menu and delicious sangria!Between my sister and I, we ordered 8 tapas (seriously 8 tapas is a sh*t ton of food..I got carried away and wanted to try everything :/ ) and were pleasantly pleased with all of them. The MEMORABLE:1. Roasted Beet Skordalia with Pita -- delicious skordalia with a hint of sweetness from the beets, great way to get your appetite going!2. Fish Fingers -- fancy fish sticks! This dish was made with salmon and it was lightly crusted, so good and definitely worth the happy hour price ($6!). 3. Lamb Kefta Meatballs -- YUM! I love meatballs in a rich tomato sauce! The lamb wasn't very gamey and the dish came with 3 hefty meatballs!4. Peashoot salad -- YES. Everything about this salad was delicious. It was so simple with just peashoots, celery, walnuts and blue cheese but, with the dressing, everything just WORKED.5. Fried Green Olives -- My sister and I were back and forth on this one. We both love olives but, I thought this dish need some more tatziki sauce to balance out the salty brine from the olives.The IN-BETWEEN:6. Oysters -- super cheap during happy hour but, not as fresh as we would have liked7. Mushroom and Goat Cheese Crostini -- This was actually really good but, the dish left something to be desired. I think it could have used a good drizzle of balsamic vinegar..it was worth trying though!The NOT-SO-GOOD:8. Spanish Pizza -- we didn't like this AT ALL. I feel like it would have been really good, but our pizza came out with so much sea salt on top as a garnish that it really did just take over the whole dish. It left us thirsty and killed our tastebuds!For 8 dishes and a glass a sangria? Only $50!!! We left the place STUFFED. Like uncomfortably full so, I'm sure a table to two can get away with happy stomachs for even cheaper. Cheers!",4.0
best brunch spot on Ft. Greene by far. Don't know why it's taken me so long to come here! I split the Green Eggs & Lamb & Spanish Omelette.,5.0
"In a word: DELICIOUS! I had a business lunch here the other day and a colleague recommended the lentil soup. Lentil soup is good but usually nothing to get excited about. However, Olea's lentil soup comes with a ton of fresh, chunky veggies like carrots, turnips, potatoes, and celery, along with a big chunk of garlic-beet dip. It was excellent.I also tried a few of the tapas, including the garlic-beet dip with pita bread (very good, but very garlicky), and the falafel-fried artichoke hearts, which were excellent. The latter were artichoke hearts, dipped in falafel batter and deep fried. It came over a bed of sauteed eggplant and tomatoes, which was excellent. I also tried my colleague's harrisa roasted potatoes, which were quite tasty.The food was all good, reasonably priced, and the service was friendly, although it took quite some time to get our bill.",4.0

"Olea was outstanding! Initially, we were worried about the wait (host estimated 30-40 minutes over the phone) but instead waited 15 minutes as we sat at the bar and enjoyed some tasty cocktails. The ambience is great; festive and loud, perfect for our noisy Mediterranean family. The decor is great with cushions in booths, and palms interspersed throughout the restaurant giving little private oasis spots, in an otherwise tight space. Our waiter, Malouk was attentive, even though the restaurant was incredibly busy. All of that is wonderful, but even if it wasn't, the food was to die for! I would recommend about 3-4 tapas per person, although it's hard to say which because almost everything was outstanding. I had goat cheese croquettes with red pepper flakes and honey, Spanish ""pitza""  (probably my favorite), the Haloumi, and Romesco dip (probably the only one I would change, though my boyfriend loved it) and we shared a ton of other tapas (so delicious). I would describe all their food as complex and exciting. Flavors would work both harmoniously, and individually in rapid succession, having sweet and savory in beautiful unison. Delicious.",5.0
"I occasionally come to the neighborhood to visit an elderly friend, and every time I visit, I pick up take out from Olea for lunch.  I have never be disappointed.  The food is delicious.  We had the fried green olives, the Spanish Pitza, and the lentil salad today. I picked the food up and we didn't eat for a while, and everything held up beautifully. The flavors in all of the dishes were perfectly done - nothing was overpowering - but everything was nicely seasoned, interesting, and unique.  It's easy and common for places to use the same spice combinations in a range of dishes or overuse ingredients, but everything here was distinct and unique.  Very, very good.

The food is great here. There were 5 of is so we did tapas style we ordered 2 small side dishes per person and the squid ink paella. Everything that came out to our table was delicious.

"I really don't understand the good reviews here. I haven't tried Olea for brunch (which admittedly looks far better than dinner), but my meal last night was pretty awful. It was incredibly packed and so loud that I left with a headache and a sore throat. I hate when small restaurants blast music or try to have live music...if your place isn't big enough for it please don't torture your patrons for the sake of looking trendy! The chairs were uncomfortable, and we were seated next to the wait station, so wait staff kept walking into me and my purse hanging on my chair without ever once saying excuse me. There was one waiter hanging out playing with another waitress's hair right in front of me and my friend, which was a major, MAJOR turn off. :(The food here was nothing to write home about. The hummus was boring (it tasted store bought), the pita was clearly store bought, and my tapa entrees were a disaster. I ordered ""falafel crusted artichoke hearts"" which were really just falafel with a very small amount of artichoke heart in the middle. Very greasy, and the falafel totally overpowered the artichoke hearts. I also got the hanger steak (stringy and not that flavorful), which had a really acidic, mushy salad underneath. My friend and I also ordered garlic bread, which was so soggy I had to attempt to eat it with a knife and fork. The absolute worst part is how freaking salty every was. My food was COVERED in huge chunks of coarse, stale sea salt. Like the stuff people put on driveways. I've never had sea salt that cut my mouth up like this. I actually thought that I chipped a tooth, or that a piece of the plate ended up in my mouth. My mouth still hurts...imagine eating an overly dressed, wilted, acidic salad with egg plants and tomatoes with your mouth covered in small cuts. I wish I was exaggerating. Pain. So much pain.On to the service...The waitress who served us was super abrasive. Not rude, but straight up cold as ice. When our hummus and pita arrived she literally threw our plates on our table without so much as making eye contact. I just wanted you to love me, waitress whose name I couldn't hear over the excruciatingly loud music! I left Olea in physical and emotional distress. :( Needless to say, I enthusiastically don't recommend this place.",1.0

"Came here before going to see John Legend at the Barclays last night for tapas and drinks.  The happy hour specials are awesome.  We both each has 3 glasses of white mango sangria and they were strong and delicious.  Also cant beat the fact it only cost $30 for 6 drinks.  We had the goat cheese and honey croquettes, mini oyster sandwiches, beef meatballs and celery-apple salad.  The croquettes and oyster sandwiches were amazing.  I also like how most the food had a little heat to it.  The celery-apple salad was good but then agan I'm not a salad person.",4.0
"This is kind of food you would want to serve at home if you had enough time to chop everything so beautifully and season it just right.  The food could have been prepared by your Greek grandmother if she had a Bon Appetit subscription.  The decor in the dining room actually used to belong to her.  (Only good things are meant by both of those statements.)My favorites are the falafel crusted artichokes, the olea vegetable salad and the pork paella (served in a skillet with crispy bits of browned rice on the bottom).My only gripe is that the pita and other bread served never arrives warm.  Maybe it's not intended to.I have been impressed every time with the service and food quality.  This place also leaves your bank account fully in tact.  Cozy, warm, busy, delicious and the kind of food you want to eat all the time.",5.0
"Really tasty Mediterranean food in a typical neighborhood local joint. Cool, funky atmosphere done in an East village style. I ordered a lamb sandwich that came with potatoes bravas which was very good. My husband had their green eggs with lamb sausage- he liked it but it came with cold pieces of pita bread that he didn't touch. He mentored that he thought it was a strange item to serve with eggs. I agree.This is NOT Greek food by the way as many people have mentioned but an eclectic mix of Spanish, Mediterranean and Moroccan.I would come back if in the neighborhood but don't think its a destination spot.",3.0
"Olea - Layers of FlavorsThis place quickly jumped up to one of my wife's an my favorite places to eat in Fort Greene Brooklyn!  We've eaten here a half-dozen times and have never been disappointed! Let's start with Brunch - YUP!  Yummy in your mouth!I've twice ordered the Turkish Breakfast, with over easy eggs (instead of the recommended scrambled Eggs) with cilantro, tomato and red onion, fattoush,eggplant salad, herbed yogurt and grilled pita bread and paired it with a side of merguez lamb sausage!  What??!!!!??? Who Did That??? AWWWW YEAH - It was me! It was great, & you bet I'm gonna do it again, the next brunch chance I get!Dinner - Put On Your Eatin' Pants and Get To Olea for Dinner!My wife and I love the tapas. (Ahhhh tapas! Sure the plates are not huge and the price can quickly add up on you, but you can share and try a lot of stuff!  If you are not a Tapas person, they also have full meals... I'll have to try some of them one day.)In particular, the Tapas we have liked are...Fried Green Olives - This Mediterranean spin on the Southern favorite, Fried Pickles, is all that it is cracked up to be. The olives are coated with breadcrumbs & flash-fried to they have a crispy bite.  The other crispy bite comes from a little, spicy back heat, which is cooled off nicely in some tzatziki sauce.  So good!White Cabbage Salad - This is a tart, lemon-olive oil dressing that acts as a tasty palate cleanser.Falafel-crusted Artichoke Hearts - This dish is delicious.  The major challenge with this dish is that the falafel crust & Turkish eggplant salad, with tahini-lemon sauce, completely cancel out the entire flavor of the delicate artichoke hearts.  It is still a tasty falafel dish tho!Both the Beef Meatballs Lamb Kefteddes (Greek meatballs) are super nice, with layers of flavors.  You can't go wrong with either... So Get Both!Overall, it is a quaint restaurant, with a few tables outside (for those who enjoy the sidewalk dining), and it occasionally has live music. The servers have always been nice and well informed and everything is quick and clean.I've introduced so many other food friends to this great place that I jumped back on YELP to sing the praises of Olea to all that will listen!Enjoy!",4.0
"Had a very pleasant dinner here with friends, it was a long wait for a table but worth it.  For starters, the flash fried brussels sprouts and falafel crusted artichoke hearts were amazing.  We also had a tapenade made with olives and artichoke hearts, very good but not up to the other two appetizers.  Everyone liked their dinners.  Arctic char with cauliflower puree and kale was very tasty and prepared perfectly. The vegan paella was delicious and interesting and very satisfying - who ever thought paella could be vegan?  It was full of flavors and chunks of vegetables.  The whole grain farro pasta with vegetables is also a great dish.  The staff was friendly and attentive.  It is a small, crowded place with people waiting to get in...we did feel rushed but the staff was obviously working their butts off.  We will be back.",5.0
"This is a go-to place for brunch (at least three times) and pre-BAM theater (once). So here's the brunch account: Piper and me had the parmesan french toast, green eggs and lamb, a side of herb yogurt, and coffees (drip for me, $3; and iced for Piper, $3.50). The total was $38.11. Everything was at least 4-star, and the setting is 5-star; this is an especially nice block of Lafayette, and Olea is nestled in a pleasant corner space that provides an open feeling.TIP: This place gets busy. TIP: There is some sidewalk seating but it is cramped and limited. Nevertheless, once you've got a table, it's pleasant, and three can manage. BONUS: BAM members get a a little something for identifying themselves with their membership card; it was a glass of wine when I was last there for dinner.",4.0

I hate when small restaurants blast music or try to have live music...if your place isn't big enough for it please don't torture your patrons for the sake of looking trendy! The chairs were uncomfortable, and we were seated next to the wait station, so wait staff kept walking into me and my purse hanging on my chair without ever once saying excuse me. There was one waiter hanging out playing with another waitress's hair right in front of me and my friend, which was a major, MAJOR turn off. :(The food here was nothing to write home about. The hummus was boring (it tasted store bought), the pita was clearly store bought, and my tapa entrees were a disaster. I ordered ""falafel crusted artichoke hearts"" which were really just falafel with a very small amount of artichoke heart in the middle. Very greasy, and the falafel totally overpowered the artichoke hearts. I also got the hanger steak (stringy and not that flavorful), which had a really acidic, mushy salad underneath. My friend and I also ordered garlic bread, which was so soggy I had to attempt to eat it with a knife and fork. The absolute worst part is how freaking salty every was. My food was COVERED in huge chunks of coarse, stale sea salt. Like the stuff people put on driveways. I've never had sea salt that cut my mouth up like this. I actually thought that I chipped a tooth, or that a piece of the plate ended up in my mouth. My mouth still hurts...imagine eating an overly dressed, wilted, acidic salad with egg plants and tomatoes with your mouth covered in small cuts. I wish I was exaggerating. Pain. So much pain.On to the service...The waitress who served us was super abrasive. Not rude, but straight up cold as ice. When our hummus and pita arrived she literally threw our plates on our table without so much as making eye contact. I just wanted you to love me, waitress whose name I couldn't hear over the excruciatingly loud music! I left Olea in physical and emotional distress. :( Needless to say, I enthusiastically don't recommend this place.",1.0
I have been coming to Olea since they opened. I don't live in the neighborhoohd anymore but still make it a desitnation stop. The food is never disappointing. I had the Cicken & Pork Paella yesterday and it was amazing! It was devoured by my friends right down to the crispy rice at the bottom of the cast iron pan it arrived.  Oh and I had one of the best Manhattan's ever made.,5.0
Super delicious food with a huge variety to choose from. Looking forward to another visit :).,5.0

"Came here before going to see John Legend at the Barclays last night for tapas and drinks.  The happy hour specials are awesome.  We both each has 3 glasses of white mango sangria and they were strong and delicious.  Also cant beat the fact it only cost $30 for 6 drinks.  We had the goat cheese and honey croquettes, mini oyster sandwiches, beef meatballs and celery-apple salad.  The croquettes and oyster sandwiches were amazing.  I also like how most the food had a little heat to it.  The celery-apple salad was good but then agan I'm not a salad person.",4.0
"This is kind of food you would want to serve at home if you had enough time to chop everything so beautifully and season it just right.  The food could have been prepared by your Greek grandmother if she had a Bon Appetit subscription.  The decor in the dining room actually used to belong to her.  (Only good things are meant by both of those statements.)My favorites are the falafel crusted artichokes, the olea vegetable salad and the pork paella (served in a skillet with crispy bits of browned rice on the bottom).My only gripe is that the pita and other bread served never arrives warm.  Maybe it's not intended to.I have been impressed every time with the service and food quality.  This place also leaves your bank account fully in tact.  Cozy, warm, busy, delicious and the kind of food you want to eat all the time.",5.0
"Really tasty Mediterranean food in a typical neighborhood local joint. Cool, funky atmosphere done in an East village style. I ordered a lamb sandwich that came with potatoes bravas which was very good. My husband had their green eggs with lamb sausage- he liked it but it came with cold pieces of pita bread that he didn't touch. He mentored that he thought it was a strange item to serve with eggs. I agree.This is NOT Greek food by the way as many people have mentioned but an eclectic mix of Spanish, Mediterranean and Moroccan.I would come back if in the neighborhood but don't think its a destination spot.",3.0
"Olea - Layers of FlavorsThis place quickly jumped up to one of my wife's an my favorite places to eat in Fort Greene Brooklyn!  We've eaten here a half-dozen times and have never been disappointed! Let's start with Brunch - YUP!  Yummy in your mouth!I've twice ordered the Turkish Breakfast, with over easy eggs (instead of the recommended scrambled Eggs) with cilantro, tomato and red onion, fattoush,eggplant salad, herbed yogurt and grilled pita bread and paired it with a side of merguez lamb sausage!  What??!!!!??? Who Did That??? AWWWW YEAH - It was me! It was great, & you bet I'm gonna do it again, the next brunch chance I get!Dinner - Put On Your Eatin' Pants and Get To Olea for Dinner!My wife and I love the tapas. (Ahhhh tapas! Sure the plates are not huge and the price can quickly add up on you, but you can share and try a lot of stuff!  If you are not a Tapas person, they also have full meals... I'll have to try some of them one day.)In particular, the Tapas we have liked are...Fried Green Olives - This Mediterranean spin on the Southern favorite, Fried Pickles, is all that it is cracked up to be. The olives are coated with breadcrumbs & flash-fried to they have a crispy bite.  The other crispy bite comes from a little, spicy back heat, which is cooled off nicely in some tzatziki sauce.  So good!White Cabbage Salad - This is a tart, lemon-olive oil dressing that acts as a tasty palate cleanser.Falafel-crusted Artichoke Hearts - This dish is delicious.  The major challenge with this dish is that the falafel crust & Turkish eggplant salad, with tahini-lemon sauce, completely cancel out the entire flavor of the delicate artichoke hearts.  It is still a tasty falafel dish tho!Both the Beef Meatballs Lamb Kefteddes (Greek meatballs) are super nice, with layers of flavors.  You can't go wrong with either... So Get Both!Overall, it is a quaint restaurant, with a few tables outside (for those who enjoy the sidewalk dining), and it occasionally has live music. The servers have always been nice and well informed and everything is quick and clean.I've introduced so many other food friends to this great place that I jumped back on YELP to sing the praises of Olea to all that will listen!Enjoy!",4.0
"Had a very pleasant dinner here with friends, it was a long wait for a table but worth it.  For starters, the flash fried brussels sprouts and falafel crusted artichoke hearts were amazing.  We also had a tapenade made with olives and artichoke hearts, very good but not up to the other two appetizers.  Everyone liked their dinners.  Arctic char with cauliflower puree and kale was very tasty and prepared perfectly. The vegan paella was delicious and interesting and very satisfying - who ever thought paella could be vegan?  It was full of flavors and chunks of vegetables.  The whole grain farro pasta with vegetables is also a great dish.  The staff was friendly and attentive.  It is a small, crowded place with people waiting to get in...we did feel rushed but the staff was obviously working their butts off.  We will be back.",5.0
"This is a go-to place for brunch (at least three times) and pre-BAM theater (once). So here's the brunch account: Piper and me had the parmesan french toast, green eggs and lamb, a side of herb yogurt, and coffees (drip for me, $3; and iced for Piper, $3.50). The total was $38.11. Everything was at least 4-star, and the setting is 5-star; this is an especially nice block of Lafayette, and Olea is nestled in a pleasant corner space that provides an open feeling.TIP: This place gets busy. TIP: There is some sidewalk seating but it is cramped and limited. Nevertheless, once you've got a table, it's pleasant, and three can manage. BONUS: BAM members get a a little something for identifying themselves with their membership card; it was a glass of wine when I was last there for dinner.",4.0
"I love Fort Greene with its many tempting and eclectic food choices. So, it's a real tribute to Olea that I find myself dining there most often when I am in the area. Who am I kidding? Sometimes, I am in the area specifically to dine at Olea because I am craving their sangria-marinated hanger steak and patatas bravas. The hanger steak is the best steak I have ever had, accompanied perfectly by sauteed red onions and a creamy garlic dipping sauce. Their patatas bravas come the closest to emulating the ones I ate every day when I was in Barcelona as compared to any others I have tried in NYC. It is also a fairly generous-sized portion for tapas. I have sampled other dishes on the menu as well-spanish pitza, harissa deviled eggs, trio of dips, lamb meatballs, along with some of their specials-which have all been solid to great, but nothing compares to the hanger steak and patatas. Sometimes, my friends and I will just order multiple orders and eat them like entrees.The drink selection is also good. Both their red and white sangrias are pleasurable to imbibe. They have a nice wine list, although a little pricey, and the servers usually make good recommendations if you ask. They used to have a red wine that I really loved, but it was no longer on the list the last time I was there, so we ordered a  bottle of rose at the waiter's suggestion that did not disappoint. Between food and drinks, you will end up with a pretty sizable bill at the end of the night, so consider yourself warned. This is not the place to come on a tight budget.The restaurant is quite small, so be prepared to wait for a table. I have not had the opportunity to eat outside because it has always either been sweltering hot or polar vortex when I have been there, but the sidewalk tables accommodate a few more parties. The service is usually very pleasant, but I once had such a terrible experience with a rude and inattentive waitress that my friend and I cut our dinner short. I ended up writing the manager, who was very apologetic and offered a free round of drinks upon our next visit. I didn't take him up on the free drinks, but I appreciated the customer service, which kept me coming back. Thank goodness, since I really would have missed that steak!",4.0
"Delicious food -- great deals during happy hour. Sangria is strong and portions are good for sharing. Farro pasta dish is my favorite; could eat it every day.

"Delicious. Wonderful date spot. It's in a beautiful leafy green neighborhood, easy to get a table, very romantic but chill setting. The service was excellent, the wine list superb, and many of the dishes were so good they gave me chills down my spine. I recommend the goat cheese and honey croquettes and the bacon-wrapped dates in particular. I was disappointed by the gazpacho. It wasn't cold enough and it was too thick in consistency and had too much of a weird spice you don't normally put in gazpacho (paprika maybe? cumin?). Likewise the dark chocolate torte was disappointing for dessert. It seemed like it had been in the fridge for a long time. Kind of hard, chalky consistency with something white and sour squirted over it. Yeah. But other than that, all the dishes were so tasty and delicious, came out on time, great setting, and loved the cushioned benches by the window, very comfy. Nice decor, nice vibe.",5.0

"I never write Yelp reviews but have to for Olea. Had a really memorable meal here last night and had only been to Olea for breakfast before. I was seeking really good food but in a really comfortable environment after a long day and this is just what I got. Amazing service, buzzing but relaxed and casual atmosphere, great table and dim lighting. My boyfriend and I shared the vegetable paella, roasted mushroom appetizer, lentil salad, and the romesco and pita starter. All delicious, really filling, but healthy. Highly recommend Olea if you're in the fort greene neighborhood and don't feel like cooking, want a good meal, but still want to feel at home! Great beer and wines by the glass selection as well!",4.0

The service got a little wonky there at the end, hence my lack of 4-5 stars, but despite that Olea was a really good experience that I'm eager to return to soon.",3.0
"Mixed Sunday afternoon at Olea.  The bourbon cherry ""Barcelona"" cocktail was absolutely lovely, yet, it was the first and highest note.  Unfortunately, the patatas bravas came greasy and drowning in harissa mayo.  And by drowning, I mean little baby potatoes choking for air under half a cup of mayonnaise.  The keftedes had a decent flavor, but any warmth soon faded.  The tapas were sautéed and placed in cold cazuelas rather than baked in the intended crocks.  Such a shame.  The gambas, which were our last attempt at success, arrived steaming....for about 30 seconds and then fell prey to their chilled cazuela as well.  All servers were preoccupied discussing a forthcoming party that night, and congregated at the door with their backs turned to the customers, so it was difficult to request another cocktail.  When we did manage, we wished we hadn't. The cocktails were either awkwardly oversweet or bitter.  I don't foresee Olea as enticing enough to warrant another afternoon as a stop on the moveable brunch walk, unless it's just for a Barcelona cocktail.",2.0

"Let's begin this review with the acknowledgment that a multi-meal establishment shouldn't necessarily be evaluated on brunch alone, for a number of reasons:First, from a staffing perspective, brunch teams usually consist of fatigued employees, front line and kitchen alike. The culinary side, beaten down from giving their heart on Saturday night, is often forced to refrain from wielding its artistic arsenal, and, instead, has no choice but to conform to a world shaped by screaming infants, moms who want nothing more than a stiff mimosa, and an army of weekend-warrior-washouts looking for something to soak up the pain. This, I get. Second, from a reviewer perspective, us Yelpers have a responsibility, albeit an infinitesimal one, to treat the hardworking men and women of such a place with a certain level of critical integrity. Personally, I don't want Brigid, the 26 year old mother of two to finish her double shift on a busy Sunday, come home to her two needy children, fire up the PC, and log into Yelp to see some jerk throwing her unnecessarily under the bus. While one Yelp review might not make or break the livelihood of a particular business, it can quite easily damage the soul of a good intentioned but overworked employee. I get this, too.Having said all of that, lets talk about why Olea, after just one visit during brunch, is justifiably a one star establishment, for me, at least.When an airplane crashes, like a restaurant, it's most often the result of numerous, catastrophic failures. One malfunctioning mechanism is rarely enough to bring it down on its own. Rather, there have to be redundant mistakes. As was the case at Olea last Sunday. From the misquoted wait time at the door to the offensive bloody mary to our server sitting down to eat at the bar before we got our food, everything went wrong. Add that to the forty five minutes it took for all of us to get our dishes (while other tables sat, ate, paid, and left all around us), food items that left no choice but to have them sent back (poached eggs completely solid in the middle, like hard boiled ones), and the loudest dining room in Fort Greene, and you begin to get the picture. In essence, the restaurant's overwhelming lack of leadership, fatal miscommunications between front and back of house, neglect from our server, and general air of chaos made for an overall gut-wrenching experience. ""If this was my first time here, I would never come back,"" said one of our comrades who had been here on several occasions. He likes the place's happy hour, dinner, and usually good brunch. In fairness, my 'green eggs and lamb' dish was good, or at least it would've been if it didn't have to get cold while my poor dining companion sat without food (each dish came out separately). Who knows. Maybe Olea is good. Maybe you should give it a try. It has earned one star from me because my friend, whose opinion is solid, says it can be. What it hasn't earned, though, is my intentions of going back anytime soon. If you want a comparable, high-energy experience done right, try Stone Park Cafe in Park Slope.",1.0

I get this, too.Having said all of that, lets talk about why Olea, after just one visit during brunch, is justifiably a one star establishment, for me, at least.When an airplane crashes, like a restaurant, it's most often the result of numerous, catastrophic failures. One malfunctioning mechanism is rarely enough to bring it down on its own. Rather, there have to be redundant mistakes. As was the case at Olea last Sunday. From the misquoted wait time at the door to the offensive bloody mary to our server sitting down to eat at the bar before we got our food, everything went wrong. Add that to the forty five minutes it took for all of us to get our dishes (while other tables sat, ate, paid, and left all around us), food items that left no choice but to have them sent back (poached eggs completely solid in the middle, like hard boiled ones), and the loudest dining room in Fort Greene, and you begin to get the picture. In essence, the restaurant's overwhelming lack of leadership, fatal miscommunications between front and back of house, neglect from our server, and general air of chaos made for an overall gut-wrenching experience. ""If this was my first time here, I would never come back,"" said one of our comrades who had been here on several occasions. He likes the place's happy hour, dinner, and usually good brunch. In fairness, my 'green eggs and lamb' dish was good, or at least it would've been if it didn't have to get cold while my poor dining companion sat without food (each dish came out separately). Who knows. Maybe Olea is good. Maybe you should give it a try. It has earned one star from me because my friend, whose opinion is solid, says it can be. What it hasn't earned, though, is my intentions of going back anytime soon. If you want a comparable, high-energy experience done right, try Stone Park Cafe in Park Slope.",1.0

"I have traveled the world and eaten in some AMAZING restaurants, but no matter where I go, this place is and will ALWAYS be my FAVORITE restaurant. The food, the ambiance, music, and location are all PERFECTION. I consistently have dreams about the spiced olives and manchengo cheese because they are that good! The kale salad is divinity and the lentil salad with its crisp little falafels never ever disappoints. And if you do nothing else in life, eat the lamb kefedes - mind blowing!The servers are not that great, at least the one I had about a week ago, she was just an order taker and added nothing to the experience, but did not detract much either. I like that they use sustainable and organic products, even some of their wine is sustainably grown, which is a plus. The decor is beautiful in an eclectic, Mediterranean kind of way, so much so that there are bits and pieces that remind me of Greece, Turkey, Morocco and Egypt. Please check this place out and its in a nice part of Brooklyn, but still quiet enough where you can sit on the tables out front!",5.0
"Came here two days in a row. One night for dinner and the next day for brunch. That's how excellent my meal was the first time. For dinner we had some tapas at half-price for happy hour which of course forces you to order more. We ordered the patatas bravas (5/5), fish fingers (3.5/5), whole wheat pita dip with whipped spicy feta (5/5) and Romesco (4/5), meatballs with pomegranate sauce (5/5) and last but not least...the spanish pitza (5/5!!!) The spanish pitza was soo delish, it was a salty/sweet combo I never had before, sweet jesus it was good! It was so good I came back for brunch the next day and ordered another pizza for me, myself, and I. My friends ordered french toast and eggs benedict which they loved as well. The service for brunch was a little slow, but its New York, it doesn't hurt to slow the pace down a bit and enjoy the savory meals this great place has to offer.If I come back to Brooklyn, I will make a strong effort to come back to Olea!!

"Ohhhhhkay, Olea. I really love you, I do. The abundance of potted plants in an open, airy old garage. The exposed ceiling joists. The live classical guitar. The candle-lit cozy interior. The delicious (deeeelcious!) (albeit slightly expensive for what it is, IMHO) food.However, your service sucks.It's like you all never anticipated how popular you would become and never hired someone to properly oversee the front of house. And I am really not one to typically complain about service. It just seems... unprofessional. And I am not necessarily talking about the waitstaff: they're mostly friendly and totally competent, if a bit slow to produce a check. That's all fine. I am talking about the ""Maitre d'"" and the seating policies.There have been two instances. Once, on a slow Tuesday night, I come in and am told that it is a 45 minute wait for a table for 2. But... But... there are two tables open? ""Oh, one is a 4-top and the other is a 3-top. We can't seat you in those."" So we wait. And wait. It's pouring rain and there was no room at the bar. Not one party of 3 or 4 arrives to take those tables. I almost called a friend who lives nearby to come and sit with us so we could sit down.The most egregious lack of hospitality however occurred the last time I went. I was on crutches. It was busy. Sure. However, it is generally understood by most restaurants that since I cannot stand for long, my party gets a bump to the front of the wait list. Not so at Olea. I was quoted 25 minutes (which, btw, became 45) and even after asking if there was a place to sit, was told to wait outside on the bench. Which didn't allow me to enjoy a glass of wine but to instead shiver with my broken foot. I got sick of this and wanted a glass of wine so wedged myself near the bar, was jostled, someone almost kicked the crutch out from under me because the space is so snug. Finally a kind patron offered me her barstool after seeing me almost fall.By no means am I entitled to a dinner out. I just expect that the staff of a restaurant would provide a measure of hospitality and even maybe a dose of compassion.",3.0
"My one and only James decided to try Olea last Saturday night. I mean, every time we drive by the restaurant, especially on Sundays around brunch, you can always count on people lingering around the corner on Lafayette waiting for their name to be called for the next available table. Our waitress was super nice and not overly or under attentive; just the riiiiight balance. Perfect. She did, however, misguide us in the very best way possible by saying their carafe of sangria is actually a full-on grown up pitcher (think 8 glasses) for either one person who's just angling for a horrible hangover the next day or two people who just want to get really tipsy and if they drink enough water that night won't wake up with a headache. We chose a bunch of tapas: whole-wheat pita with a beet skordalia (more like a beet puree) and feta dip; shrimp with lemon and garlic; marinated anchovies over arugula; salmon empanadas (special); and organic chicken meatballs. Plus an arugula salad with pears. Everything was solid overall and the food came out quickly. James did think some of the dishes were a little salty (namely the feta dip and the shrimp) and I did agree with him too, but I was on my fourth glass of sangria, so i would've agreed to anything at that point. James totally dug the salmon empanadas and I wolfed down the chicken meatballs; both were delicious. The anchovies just delivered; be sure to order it if you love to eat whole sardines. We both adored the skordalia and although the chunky feta dip was a tad oversalted (or maybe it would've benefitted from not being salted at all), i did keep munching on it. We'd both return, hopefully for brunch next time.",3.0

"Very charming, very local feeling, and very reasonably priced little joint.The service was average, not bad, not top notch.  It is one of those kind of bohemian feeling places where, if you want five star service, you will be disappointed.  I will say that our waitress was very sweet.  What she lacked in attentiveness, she more than made up in charm.We went for happy hour, and the prices were beyond reasonable.  $1 oysters for happy hour is nothing new, but they were awesome, really good quality.  Between that and the half price drinks, we were there for at least two hours and when I saw our bill, I had to double check because it was so cheap I thought they made a mistake. In closing, great happy relaxed happy hour spot.  Not a first date, not an impress people who are just getting in to town, but just a chill spot with good food and good prices.",4.0

"Every now and then, I use yelp as an aide to guide me to a dining experience in neighborhoods where my knowledge is limited. Sometimes, I find an amazing meal. Other times, it makes me wonder about the value of a site like this, because I am led astray by hundreds of fools that give 5 star reviews for reasons completely incomprehensible to me. I'm afraid Olea is one of the later.The ambience is somewhat relaxing, though the decor is embarrassing in its carelessness. This relaxation is interrupted, however, by an overzealous waitstaff that run around grabbing plates off tables and throwing them in the wash bins like this is some crazed episode of Kitchen Nightmares where Ramsay packs the place to watch people breakdown. However, the place was half empty, and the reasons behind the breakneck table service are a mystery.We received a complementary order of some of the worst bread I've ever received in a restaurant. It was stale and burnt at the bottom. To accompany this, there was a bottle of Crudo olive oil. I know it was Crudo because they didn't bother to put the oil in a proper pouring receptacle, but left it in the original bottle on the table. Apparently they were proud of providing their customers with this mediocre brand, and wanted everyone to know it.We decided to go the tapas route. We ordered some things that many would consider risky, but we live dangerously. Perhaps ordering safer items would have been a wiser choice, and my review would be more like those of my fellow yelpers. But I believe a restaurant must stand by every dish, not just the easy ones, and I'm glad we delved deep into the weaknesses of Olea, so we can officially expose them as bullshit to all of New York and the World!First, the fried oyster sliders: more stale bread around a tiny grease ball of mush. I know it's fried, but let it drain for one moment, please. The Fish Fingers. Forgettable, tasteless fried salmon turds that were only edible by covering every inch of them with the mayonnaisey goo that came on the side.The Spanish Pitza. The best thing we ordered, though a bit too sweet, and covered with overpowering fried garlic slices that we had to pick off in order to make it tolerable. Falafel-crusted Artichoke Hearts. An abomination that we found completely inedible. Gooey, cold eggplant sludge surrounds warmish falafel balls, a combination of incompatible temperatures and disappointing flavors that make this probably the most disgusting thing we ordered. At this point, that stale, burnt bread was starting to look good.We came here so hungry that we were pretty much ready to like anything, and the fact that this meal managed to stand out as the most laughably bad dining fail in recent history is really telling of the so-called 4-star Olea. Are the dining options in Fort Green really so dire that a place like this rises to local stardom?",1.0
"Arctic Char  is a fish, closely related to salmon and trout ,and the taste is just that. But what sets it apart from those distant cousins, when it's on your plate, is the lite fluffy texture. The flesh breaks down into fine flakes.This fish is amazing to eat but hard to find. That's what inspired me to truck out to Brooklyn,this and Brooklyn restaurant week.    My Arctic char was the standard light and fluffy, with a crisp skin. It sat on top of a subtle cauliflower puree which brought out the deep  flavors. Personally I would have laid off the savory herbs because I found them a touch distracting but still a damn good meal.Unlike like the regular menu I got a crisp little carrot salad instead of Kale.    The other plate were also well prepared.

"I like these type of restaurants that are ""very Brooklyn"", which one could have said ""very Village"" a bunch of years ago.  It's a warm atmosphere and literally warm, as we were after the December 2010 Blizzard and freezing temperature outside was kept out by a perfect thick curtain in front of the main door.  I love those; no drafts while eating which ruins a meal!  They have a coat rack, which makes you feel like a human and you're not worrying about the waiters and customers walking all over your pea coat as it is draped unromantically on your chair.The bar was what you would expect and perhaps a bit more.  They had some interesting menu selections for drinks, such as dry and sweet sherry and tuica liqueur.  Three good beers on tap and excellent wine by the glass.  Tapas and entrees were very good and appropriate for the Mediterranean style.  Is it Greek?  Is it Spanish?  Is it simply Mediterranean?  Not sure and I won't say the f-word (fusion), because it was not, but it was a combination of Mediterranean foods with the Greek designation of a ""Taverna"".Bathroom was clean!  And fun!  Service was pretty good.  Bartender funny.  It was a fun evening and everyone there was having a good time.  You certainly get a sense of a fun, lively atmosphere.",5.0

"Went to Olea Saturday night. The food was quite good, the waiter was very helpful, and the environment was cozy on a cold night. The problem, and it was a significant problem is that they clearly rushed us in and out. All of the tapas came at once. The dishes were basically thrown on the table and we had to ask for flatware and serving spoons; we shared tapas. Frankly it made the experience unpleasant when it really did not have to be so. Since I thought the food was good I may go back, but if I did I would tell the waiter that we do not want all the tapas at once and would like not to be so rushed.",2.0

Been to Olea before always order vegetable salad..I really need my greens win I can get them. Today they were soggy an I couldn't finish them. Place must fall off on Sundays. Never had problem before.  Anyway check it out  usually food is Great!,3.0
"I like these type of restaurants that are ""very Brooklyn"", which one could have said ""very Village"" a bunch of years ago.  It's a warm atmosphere and literally warm, as we were after the December 2010 Blizzard and freezing temperature outside was kept out by a perfect thick curtain in front of the main door.  I love those; no drafts while eating which ruins a meal!  They have a coat rack, which makes you feel like a human and you're not worrying about the waiters and customers walking all over your pea coat as it is draped unromantically on your chair.The bar was what you would expect and perhaps a bit more.  They had some interesting menu selections for drinks, such as dry and sweet sherry and tuica liqueur.  Three good beers on tap and excellent wine by the glass.  Tapas and entrees were very good and appropriate for the Mediterranean style.  Is it Greek?  Is it Spanish?  Is it simply Mediterranean?  Not sure and I won't say the f-word (fusion), because it was not, but it was a combination of Mediterranean foods with the Greek designation of a ""Taverna"".Bathroom was clean!  And fun!  Service was pretty good.  Bartender funny.  It was a fun evening and everyone there was having a good time.  You certainly get a sense of a fun, lively atmosphere.",5.0
"Had brunch for the first time in a bajillion years at Olea, and boy oh boy, what a great way to return to the glorious meal!We ordered the most delicious toast with honey and tahini, it was just perfect.  I had the eggs with cilantro and purple onion with the lamb (green eggs and lamb), and it was just heavenly.  The lamb was juicy, cooked to the perfect consistency, and my side of purple vinegary cole slaw was delicious.  My bloody Mary was scrumptious as well with what I believe to be pickle juice from a Rick's Picks jar.  It's in the details, and Olea has them covered.",5.0
"Went to Olea Saturday night. The food was quite good, the waiter was very helpful, and the environment was cozy on a cold night. The problem, and it was a significant problem is that they clearly rushed us in and out. All of the tapas came at once. The dishes were basically thrown on the table and we had to ask for flatware and serving spoons; we shared tapas. Frankly it made the experience unpleasant when it really did not have to be so. Since I thought the food was good I may go back, but if I did I would tell the waiter that we do not want all the tapas at once and would like not to be so rushed.",2.0
"Timing is everything. I hate restaurants where the service is slow, it takes forever to get your food, your check, your water refilled. I also hate restaurants where the food is whisked to your table, empty plates whisked away while you're still savoring the last bite, and the check promptly plopped onto the table. Olea is the perfect balance of cozy, welcoming service that gets your food to you fast but allows you to savor the atmosphere and your meal.We ordered 5 tapas for two. (Patatas Bravas, bacon-wrapped dates, pork skewers, baby octopus and pan fried cheese. All were phenomenol except for the cheese.) Most arrived at the table within minutes of each other. But once we scarfed down the deliciousness we were not rushed from the table. Which obviously caused us to order dessert. Which was also delightful. We'll definitely be back!",4.0
"Loved this place. Came on live music and tapas tuesday and thoroughly enjoyed eating my shrimp ceviche and lamb skewers with a side of delicious tzatziki, hummus, and the red pepper based sauce of which the name I can't recall.Looks like you can sit here and enjoy the music with a glass of wine or a beer. The seats by the window offer cushion support and the best view of the live music.I prefer the atmosphere to the food here and would come listen for a drink on another tapas tuesday. Not sure how often they have the live music but the place is cozy and makes you feel tucked away from Brooklyn for a moment.",5.0

Also  a great place to just have wine at the bar and have good convo.",5.0

"My fiancé and I went here for our four year anniversary last night. While the sangria, dips, and Spanish ""Pitza"" were tasty, our service was really poor. Our server Lucy, (which she never said, we saw it on the receipt), said two words to us the entire meal and never even made eye contact. While we appreciate good food, good service goes even further. If you like to go to a place where the waiter rushes by you to throw down a menu or never asks you if you like the food, and doesn't even say thanks for coming, this is your restaurant.",2.0
"I love Olea. Inspired and creative takes on Mediterranean cuisine and everything I've had there I've loved. The flavors are wonderful, vibrant, fresh, and balanced. Simple but really well-done! Also friendly staff and quaint atmosphere. I've been there loads of times and I've not once been disappointed. One of my favorite brunch spots in NY for sure. Dig in!",5.0
"Offensive and humiliating dining experience. I decided to make the trek from Manhattan to Olea last night (Tuesday 6:30 pm) on recommendation from a friend that works at a nearby establishment, which often refers its customers to dine there. I was third of six friends to arrive, and walked in to see my two friends (including the recommender friend) visibly distressed and sitting at a two person table in the corner. They were first told they couldn't be seated at a six-person table until the whole party arrived, which is common, but the problem was that they were prevented from making a reservation for the six of us for a later time. The host told them he had nowhere to write down the reservation so unfortunately they couldn't make one. Yes, write down, as in, he had no paper or something.. It's possible this was blatant racism directed at my two friends, or simply a laziness and ineptitude of the host. I politely asked to be seated with my friends, but was not permitted, and told I could be seated at a separate table. A fourth friend arrived so we were given a second two-person table, and promptly told we had to order now or be moved to the bar. We were told we would be moved to a six-person table when the other two arrived, which seemed a bit inconvenient both for us and the servers. We placed an order, and the other two party members arrived, at which point they were seated at a third two-person table across the room and we were told there were no longer any six-person tables available. Being that this was a tapas place we all wanted to share food and enjoy each others company. This was not possible here. We were treated extremely disrespectfully, and it was embarrassing to be told we could not sit together, nor make a reservation to sit together, despite the fact that they do take reservations. The first two friends ended up leaving early, deeply hurt by the experience. Naturally the rest of us were not keen on staying and finished our food and left. This horrendous lack of customer service and hospitality prevented us from enjoying the large meal we had planned, and we ended up going to a nearby restaurant after. It was truly incomprehensible that no one in the restaurant was able to accomodate us in any way. One server was pleasant, but it was clear everyone had been clued in to the incident. It's a shame the manager wasn't there because I'm sure he would have liked to have dealt with the situation that resulted in six people deciding to never return, not to mention the people we will pass this experience on to that will never try Olea, and perhaps most damaging is the end to recommendations of Olea by our friend that works in the nearby establishment. There are scores of lovely restaurants in this great neighborhood that will treat you as a respectable person, do not waste your time here.",1.0

"Lovely brunch spot in charming Fort Greene.  Arrive early (10-11am) to avoid lines; no reservations.  The Turkish breakfast featured a tasty selection of scrambled eggs, hummous, eggplant salad and homemade pita bread.  Even better was scrambled eggs with lox, best I've tasted in NYC (OK not exactly Mediterranean).  MUST ORDER:  a side of herbed yogurt.  This is a masterpiece and perfect for dipping pita.  The herbs tasted like a z'atar mix, fresh and fragrant.  Chorizo and lamb sausages looked good but I had no room.  FInally the coffee: DARK roast and delicious...and plentiful.  Why can't more places serve good coffee like this?  Unfortunately couldn't try the ""infamous"" Bloody Mary because we were there before noon.  Forget all other political causes and let's lobby Albany to update the ridiculous blue law.",4.0

Even though our waitress was busy she never forgot us and made sure we always had a full cup of coffee and the food came out quickly. We started with the fresh baked chocolate croissants which were warm chocolatey goodness. My friend had the Savory Parmesan French Toast and everything was good but the toast was a little dry. I had the Green Eggs and Lamb which was very good as well although the lamb sausage was a tad salty. The home fries were perfectly baked small pieces of potatoes with no grease at all.,4.0

The small plates I would give a 4, and I will definitely come back for a drink and an appetizer at some point. We had yummy falafel stuffer with artichoke, spicy deviled eggs, and Brussels sprouts with pomegranate molasses. The entree though was actually really bad!

"Every time I come to NY I have to come to Olea.. Love the atmosphere, the food and drinks are nothing short of amazing! Have never been disappointed in anything I've  ordered! Cant wait to go back! Also ther service is great, Vella was my server and now i ask for her section every time I go!",5.0
"The service was fantastic.  I scored the last table available in time to make our show at BAM.  We had various tapas here and all were amazing.  The goat cheese croquettes, butternut squash soup and the spiked hot cider deserve rave reviews. If you are going to a show at BAM, ours started at 8 p.m., do try and arrive to Olea before 6 p.m.  By 6 p.m. all the tables were taken.",5.0
"I was really looking forward to dining here after a great recommendation from a friend. We waited 30 minutes on a wednesday night at 8:30PM, which for the neighborhood feels like a long time. Then when it came to the food, we ordered a bunch of small plates and one entree to share. The small plates I would give a 4, and I will definitely come back for a drink and an appetizer at some point. We had yummy falafel stuffer with artichoke, spicy deviled eggs, and Brussels sprouts with pomegranate molasses. The entree though was actually really bad! We had greek poutine - french fries with roasted lamb, feta, and a million other ingredients - it just tasted totally wrong and was pretty expensive for what was mostly a mountain of overcooked fries. I will come back, but choose more wisely.",3.0
"Great food, even better cocktails! Great ambience, but of course, the location supplements it. Though Ive been here just for dinners, Olea is also a great place for brunch and lunch. The service is great, staff is friendly and courteous! I will definitely be visiting again!",4.0
"A go-to spot.  Good for introducing people to the neighborhood.  Chill, relaxed environment good for brunch or dinner.Clean and healthy classic Mediterranean dishes with a healthy portion size.Also good mimosas, different flavors.  Coffee's pretty good, not overpowering.Downside is long wait for a table during weekend brunch hours.",4.0
"Came here to meet a friend for dinner. The ambience as others have noted is top notch.I had the paella. It wasn't the best I had ever had, but passable. Everyone else at the table really enjoyed their meal. My friend had the arctic char - she says it was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The bartender was very friendly and cool, rarely had to wait long for drinks.All in all, it was a very good experience.",4.0
"Yes and yes to this place! Great Mediterranean in Brooklyn. High quality ingredients, nice ambiance (sometimes a guitarist plays in the center of the restaurant) and they didn't cut corners on the wine list. Sometimes a little loud, but that's NY for you. Great date spot. Nice outdoor seating during lunch.",5.0
"Pretty good place, nestled away in the forestry part of Lafayette Av/Ft. Greene. This bar restaurant has long been a staple of local denizens who enjoy the generous happy hour and delicious tapas offerings.

However, overall a great experience that one must enjoy whenever one can.",4.0

"I discovered the fourth dimension at Olea. Brunch does not get any better than this!We accidentally stumbled onto this place after going to pay a deposit for an apartment.

Their eggs with spinach were amazingly flavorful, and the lamb sausage that I thought would taste weird tasted even better than the eggs! In fact every single thing that we tried had an interesting twist, like nothing we tasted before. I give them a lot of credit for creating such wonderful flavors.

Well, with a side of polenta, of course.Their cocktails are also great which, for me, was unexpected at this sort of spot. The red sangria is also very good. Portion sizes are fair.

I love marinated anchovies, they are a simple little dish that never disappoints.2) Chard stems gratin with diced bacon (or was it pancetta? $8); really good! The chard was still nice and crunchy, the cream was light enough not to overpower the chard, and the diced bacon added a flavorful kick3) The falafel-crusted artichoke hearts with Turkish eggplant salad and tahini-yogurt sauce ($5.50) were just ok: the taste of falafel was waaaaay overwhelming over the artichoke hearts. I think it would have worked better with vinegar-marinated artichoke hearts.4) Brandade croquettes ($7); it's two large croquettes of a puree of salt cod, olive oil and milk (like brandade de morue in France). They were waaay too salty, even for somebody like me who would add salt to his milk and cereals...I wasn't too impressed with the food. Perhaps we should have tried their main dishes, but if you're looking for good tapas, perhaps you should look somewhere else.The ambiance is ok: warm, tidy, spacious, semi-romantic, but somehow impersonal; it lacks character.

"Olea is hands down one of my favorite spots in BK, let alone NYC. The Middle Eastern/Mediterranean tapas cuisine (they have more than just small, sharing plates) is one of my favorite cuisines - and they nail it. The crowd is good - hip, not pretentious.

The prices are fair, especially for the quality of food (can't count the amount of times I've overpaid for underwhelming grub; or overpaid for great grub, a la Alta which is very similar in cuisine).My friend & I had a few drinks and a bunch of sharing plates, and I'm embarrassed to say that this was one of the few times in my life that I did not finish everything on a plate (can't be a hero every day). The brussel sprouts with a sweet, pomegranate sauce was great. Almond-stuffed bacon-wrapped dates were great (but aren't they always, everywhere?). The beef meatballs were great, with its pomegranate glaze. The falafel-crusted artichokes were meh, but A for effort/creativity. The clear MVP, by and far, was the Spanish Pitza. Sweet, savory, and awesome. I'm confident we had another dish or two, but it's been a few weeks.Honestly, whenever I'm ever in Fort Greene, I hit this place up. It's sure to deliver, and some.

We showed up at noon and were seated immediately, but the table was right near the door/bar/waiting area and literally two men were standing over me the entire time I was eating which was kinda weird but hello shared space NYC. We started with pomegranate and mango mimosas which were great and I had the Green eggs and Lamb and my friend the Turkish breakfast.

No matter what, Olea has always been an inviting place, a hidden gem, with great people, exceptionally simple, but wonderful food. It's a place to go with others, alone or to meet even a new business prospect for the first time. Is the food the best you'll ever have? No. But it's consistent and it's consistently good. I will be back to see you soon, Olea.",5.0
"Ohhhh Olea!  It has been a while since I have been to this place so once I visit again I will surely update my review.  I have only been here for brunch and the food is excellent (portion:value, taste, etc)  I particularly love the omelets and the cafe au lait (it comes in a bowl and that just makes me smile!) I have gone there and had great service but on one ocassion it was just REALLY bad and of course I have to yelp about it because I think everyone on here knows what good service is...you really want to know all the ugly dirty details under the surface right?  so here goes:One weekend I came with about 5 of my girlfriends for Sunday brunch.  We didnt wait long for a table but we waited quite a bit for our order to be taken.  The server finally came and said she was not use to working the busy brunch as she usually works evenings...........ok.  We all ordered omelets.  One friend and I order almost the same omelet, only I ask for mine scramble and she had hers the other way.  The server messed up the drink orders 3...count em...3 times  and she didnt bother to tell me they ran out of orange juice(which the manager later told me)...She simply didnt bring it...nice.  When our food finally arrived, she brought my omelet the other way, instead of scrambled (yes I did take it personal lol)  but I was so over complaining and risking some possible 'special sauce' if I sent it back and just proceeded to eat it.   About 5 minutes after we began eating the server comes back to tell me that she gave me the wrong omelet.  I just said 'yeah but it's no big deal', as I had already begun eating it.  As I put my fork in for another bite, she proceeds to take the plate....when it comes to food my reflexes are superhuman....so I told her it was okay with one hand on my plate placing it back down... This server CLEARLY did not know how serious I am when it comes to eating because she really tried to pry the plate from my hands (yes, the already picked at omelet)  I was in shock and I asked her if she was really going to give my plate to someone else after I had already started eating the food.  I guess she came to her senses and realized how ridiculous the whole situation was because she let go....  I told her not to come back to the table, (for her own safety and my own freedom) so the manager came over to apologize for her (he watched most of it go down) and said she was really tired and came in to work as a favor to him and offered a round of drinks.  At the time I didnt want to hear any of that but not I am thinking that he handled it well.  Itwas nice of him to apologize and also stick up for his employee (Lord knows I couldnt do what they do well) since she was having a bad day.All in all I will go back and chalk that up to a fluke and funny story because the food is pretty good!",4.0
"Quite the tasty Egg Scramble medley with zucchini, olives, & feta with nicely toasted bread & Jam. The accompanying potatoes & salad were average but all in all the Eggs put it over the top. Come prepared to wait 20-30 min for a larger group on a sunday morning/",4.0
"Olea is the best restaurant in Fort Greene (apologies to General Greene, Ici, BPH etc...), having been 10-15 times I feel comfortable in my admiration for their finely designed Tapas, lusciously pastas and freshly hearty brunch.Highlights:Lamb balls in red sauce and creamy feta - Smooth and spicy sauce accompanying perfectly seasoned '2-bite-sized' meatballs of fresh lamb, covered in an almost yogurty-smooth feta.

"We just moved to the area and decided to walk around to discover the local restaurants and bars. We stumbled by Olea and just the cozy atmosphere caught my eye. We decided to try it out for dinner on Sat night and can I just say WOW! The food just blew me away, we got the bacon wrapped dates (so yum), some homemade tzatziki, and I had the pork chop which I can honestly say was the best pork chop I've had to date. They brined the pork and serve it with this amazing homemade olive and vinegar coleslaw. For desert we got this creamy dolce de leche gelato with a shot of espresso over it. Plus the staff couldn't of been sweeter.This place was Amazing! I highly recommend anyone try it!! We'll definitely be back again.",5.0
"Great brunch. Went pre-BAM Sunday matinee and the service was quick and on point! We showed up at noon and were seated immediately, but the table was right near the door/bar/waiting area and literally two men were standing over me the entire time I was eating which was kinda weird but hello shared space NYC. We started with pomegranate and mango mimosas which were great and I had the Green eggs and Lamb and my friend the Turkish breakfast. Both were really good, and ideal portions for one person (ie: not Denny's size breakfast....) Restaurant is small and doesn't take brunch reservations, so I wouldn't go as a group but its cozy and the food is consistently good.",4.0
"Maybe I have a ton of nostalgia associated with Olea...it's where I spent many lonely snowy mornings for brunch, or where I ALWAYS met my friends who came all of the way from Manhattan to see me in my Ft. Greene flat, or where I went on my second official date with my (now) husband, where we shared tapas, laughed and were told to leave because they were closing. No matter what, Olea has always been an inviting place, a hidden gem, with great people, exceptionally simple, but wonderful food. It's a place to go with others, alone or to meet even a new business prospect for the first time. Is the food the best you'll ever have? No. But it's consistent and it's consistently good. I will be back to see you soon, Olea.",5.0
"Ohhhh Olea!  It has been a while since I have been to this place so once I visit again I will surely update my review.  I have only been here for brunch and the food is excellent (portion:value, taste, etc)  I particularly love the omelets and the cafe au lait (it comes in a bowl and that just makes me smile!) I have gone there and had great service but on one ocassion it was just REALLY bad and of course I have to yelp about it because I think everyone on here knows what good service is...you really want to know all the ugly dirty details under the surface right?  so here goes:One weekend I came with about 5 of my girlfriends for Sunday brunch.  We didnt wait long for a table but we waited quite a bit for our order to be taken.  The server finally came and said she was not use to working the busy brunch as she usually works evenings...........ok.  We all ordered omelets.  One friend and I order almost the same omelet, only I ask for mine scramble and she had hers the other way.  The server messed up the drink orders 3...count em...3 times  and she didnt bother to tell me they ran out of orange juice(which the manager later told me)...She simply didnt bring it...nice.  When our food finally arrived, she brought my omelet the other way, instead of scrambled (yes I did take it personal lol)  but I was so over complaining and risking some possible 'special sauce' if I sent it back and just proceeded to eat it.   About 5 minutes after we began eating the server comes back to tell me that she gave me the wrong omelet.  I just said 'yeah but it's no big deal', as I had already begun eating it.  As I put my fork in for another bite, she proceeds to take the plate....when it comes to food my reflexes are superhuman....so I told her it was okay with one hand on my plate placing it back down... This server CLEARLY did not know how serious I am when it comes to eating because she really tried to pry the plate from my hands (yes, the already picked at omelet)  I was in shock and I asked her if she was really going to give my plate to someone else after I had already started eating the food.  I guess she came to her senses and realized how ridiculous the whole situation was because she let go....  I told her not to come back to the table, (for her own safety and my own freedom) so the manager came over to apologize for her (he watched most of it go down) and said she was really tired and came in to work as a favor to him and offered a round of drinks.  At the time I didnt want to hear any of that but not I am thinking that he handled it well.  Itwas nice of him to apologize and also stick up for his employee (Lord knows I couldnt do what they do well) since she was having a bad day.All in all I will go back and chalk that up to a fluke and funny story because the food is pretty good!",4.0

"Bottom Line - Execution of tapas is excellent, and all produce in dishes were fresh. All of us very much enjoyed the entire meal, and we would like to come back.Came for dinner on Saturday, 6 November 2010 with a friend and his parents. We ordered the following:Tapas:Falafel-crusted artichoke hearts (turkish eggplant, tahini-yogurt, $5.50) - These were really good. I especially liked the eggplant with the tahini yogurt. Greek Crostini (I don't recall what exactly was in this or the price) - This was good!  See the photo I uploaded of this tapas. Fried chickpeas (with smoked spanish paprika, $3.50) - Yum! These were not fried to the point that they were solid/crunchy, and you could tell that these were chickpeas.  Everyone really enjoyed this. Lamb Kefteddes (meatballs with tomato sauce & feta, $7) - You get three lamb meatballs, and one of the 4 of us doesn't eat meat, so this was perfect.  The lamb balls were seasoned well and weren't too salty.Salad Course:Endive and Arugula Salad (with candied pistachios, goat cheese croquettes, sliced pears in a lightly sweet vinegrette, $12) - 2 of us ordered this salad, including me.  It was really well portioned and I especially enjoyed the candied pistachios and sliced pears.  I wish they had been a little more generous with the pears, though.Organic Mixed Green Salad (grape tomatoes, red onion, sherry vinaigrette herbed sourdough crouton, $8) - My friend's mother ordered this and she mentioned that all the ingredients were very fresh. Mains:Greek-Style Shrimp (with tomato sauce, feta, parsley, olive oil, $12) - 2 people ordered this, one as a salad course and one as a main. Both people seemed to enjoy this dish, and it looked appetizingWhole-Grain Farro Pasta (local autumn squash, brussel sprouts toasted pumpkin seeds, grated halloumi cheese, $13) - 3 of us ordered this as our main dish.  After the tapas and salads, we all chose to order the smaller portion, which was actually pretty generous.  I had trouble finishing my pasta dish.  This dish was very hearty and I especially enjoyed the brussel sprouts; they were fresh and small (I prefer smaller brussel sprouts because they tend to be slightly sweeter and less bitter). We skipped on dessert because we had time constraints.  Including a soda water for me, the total for the 4 of us came to $121.00 + 10.74 tax = $131.74 before gratuity.",4.0

I usually cringe when a woman wants tapas because at least in NYC it's usually waaaaay overpriced, but I am happy to say Olea is very reasonable for small plates, and the quality is excellent.  Chickpeas, Brussels sprouts, olives, potatoes-these things should not cost a fortune and here they don't.  I like that. These guys have a flair for taking simple ingredients and preparing them exquisitely-and that goes double for brunch... alas I fear it will become so popular that reservations will need to made way in advance.  I do have one other concern, and that is the use of  ""local"" goat cheese... how local is local?  This is Brooklyn  and those were some strange looking dogs I saw in the park this morning...Hmmmm.",4.0

"What is it about Olea that feels magical? Is it the low lights, the small cushioned chairs, the mirrors, the low lights?  There's something about this place that shines, that shimmers - the place is absolutely charming.   In fact, I find myself describing it to friends using words I rarely use - lovely, magical, glorious, delightful.After a lovely weekday breakfast here a few months ago, we ventured out for dinner - the meal started with the most amazing bread I've ever tasted, and an arugula salad with green apples and balls of fried goat cheese (amazing).  I had the whole-grain pasta (with asparagus, leeks, romaine, parmesan, garlic butter, ricotta, and lots and lots of toasted garlic - the small size is $14, and the dinner size is $18) - the toasted garlic added an earthy taste which I loved, and the cheese gave the dish a delicious richness.  The salmon special - grilled salmon with lots of fresh veggies - was amazing  The only less-exciting dish we ordered was the rib-eye steak which is, as promised, just a big piece of meat and some french fries (I kept hoping that some veggies would come with it). The meat itself was well prepared, but the dish just felt a little naked.  All this to say, I continue to love Olea - eating there feels like going on some kind of delightful vacation.",5.0
"Olea is enchanting. The space is gorgeous, the food outstanding -- they've got some good options for vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free people -- and the staff knowledgeable and sweet. Happy hour is not to be missed -- the cabbage salad and chick peas always a hit.

It is one of my favorite places to bring people because it never disappoints.",4.0

"I came here with a group of 7 during restaurant week. My housemate was specifically looking for a vegan/vegetarian-friendly restaurant. We narrowed it down to a few restaurants and the owner of Olea was very cooperative, sending her the prix fixe menu via e-mail. We walked in to a great atmosphere. I really enjoyed the interior design details, including the hanging window with curtains in the back. I ordered:- Local Butternut Squash Soup with herbed yogurt, pomegranate molasses and toasted pumpkin seeds. I liked it but I think the herbed yogurt gave it a different flavor. It may have been fine without it.- Seafood Paella without chorizo. Pretty good...but a little bit on the salty side.- Caramel Affogato (dulce de leche gelato with hot espresso over top). My FAVORITE part of the meal. So delicious. I am not much of a coffee/espresso drinker but the combo of the gelato and espresso = MOUTH ORGASM.Everyone, except for the vegan friend, enjoyed every part of their meals. The vegan lady enjoyed her soup (the one mentioned above) and the dessert...which I believe was a raspberry sorbet. The bland part of the night was her main dish: Orechiette Pasta with Broccoli Rabe, roasted cherry tomatoes and white beans. The restaurant noise level is on the loud side. I enjoyed the two-person live music band played at the end of the night, not sure if this is a common occurrence. This was my first time in Fort Greene and Olea. I would love to explore this neighborhood more and try Olea's non-prix fixe menu. :)",4.0

"I'm not embarrassed that the weekend brunch hostess at Olea now knows me.  Perhaps I should be, but given the delight of this place, I'm not.  Olea knows how to do brunch, and has fully satisfied all at our table each time I've gone.The staff are very friendly and helpful, happy to answer any questions or provide suggestions.  The ambiance is lovely, if a little loud.  But the decor is very welcoming and they have avoided the temptation to cram in too many tables.The coffee is fantastic as are the brunch cocktails, particularly the mango mimosa.  Olea also has a number of great options for non-meat eaters, while still pleasing to the carnivores.  The turkish breakfast is a delicious collection of cilantro eggs, fattoush, yogurt and pita.  My favorite though is the parmesan toast - a scrumptious pile of cheesy toast, poached eggs, sweet peas, scallions and an amazing tangy avegolomono sauce with a great kick.  The drawback is that I am not the only one to have discovered this gem.  Get there by 10:30 on the weekend if you want to avoid a potentially long wait.  It's worth rolling out of bed early!",5.0
"Excellent place. I've been many times over the years and the food is always great and the service is always attentive. Food: I really enjoy the arugula salad with the goat cheese croquettes. Delish!! Also, the shrimp app, Greek-style; the sauce is delightful sopped up with the bread that comes before the meal. Yummy! I have never been disappointed with either app, they have always been delicious. They make me happy. Wine: Red Stag, always good. Bar is fun with good bartenders and friendly fellow customers. Tables are fun and comfy with good wait staff. Great decor, good ambience. It's a very pretty restaurant. Plus: the bathroom is cute! That's always nice. ***updated 6/1/2013. ****My dinner partner recently got the pork paella and said it was delish. The chicken is also good according to another dinner partner. Also the bacon-wrapped dates are said to be good by a dinner partner. Everyone who comes to this restaurant with me LOVES the food, the ambience, everything about it. It's my go-to place to take friends and relatives. All in all: I honestly think this is my favorite restaurant in both Brooklyn and Manhattan.",5.0

Is it the low lights, the small cushioned chairs, the mirrors, the low lights?  There's something about this place that shines, that shimmers - the place is absolutely charming.   In fact, I find myself describing it to friends using words I rarely use - lovely, magical, glorious, delightful.After a lovely weekday breakfast here a few months ago, we ventured out for dinner - the meal started with the most amazing bread I've ever tasted, and an arugula salad with green apples and balls of fried goat cheese (amazing).  I had the whole-grain pasta (with asparagus, leeks, romaine, parmesan, garlic butter, ricotta, and lots and lots of toasted garlic - the small size is $14, and the dinner size is $18) - the toasted garlic added an earthy taste which I loved, and the cheese gave the dish a delicious richness.  The salmon special - grilled salmon with lots of fresh veggies - was amazing  The only less-exciting dish we ordered was the rib-eye steak which is, as promised, just a big piece of meat and some french fries (I kept hoping that some veggies would come with it). The meat itself was well prepared, but the dish just felt a little naked.  All this to say, I continue to love Olea - eating there feels like going on some kind of delightful vacation.",5.0
"Olea is enchanting. The space is gorgeous, the food outstanding -- they've got some good options for vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free people -- and the staff knowledgeable and sweet. Happy hour is not to be missed -- the cabbage salad and chick peas always a hit. They have one of the best brunches I've ever had, down to the coffee which I suspect they brew with fairy dust, because it makes me want to write it poetry. It is one of my favorite places to bring people because it never disappoints.",4.0
"Amazing happy hour and great food all the time. I recommend the quince pitza, the bacon-wrapped plums, and the patatas bravas. Service has improved over the years.",5.0
"I came here with a group of 7 during restaurant week. My housemate was specifically looking for a vegan/vegetarian-friendly restaurant. We narrowed it down to a few restaurants and the owner of Olea was very cooperative, sending her the prix fixe menu via e-mail. We walked in to a great atmosphere. I really enjoyed the interior design details, including the hanging window with curtains in the back. I ordered:- Local Butternut Squash Soup with herbed yogurt, pomegranate molasses and toasted pumpkin seeds. I liked it but I think the herbed yogurt gave it a different flavor. It may have been fine without it.- Seafood Paella without chorizo. Pretty good...but a little bit on the salty side.- Caramel Affogato (dulce de leche gelato with hot espresso over top). My FAVORITE part of the meal. So delicious. I am not much of a coffee/espresso drinker but the combo of the gelato and espresso = MOUTH ORGASM.Everyone, except for the vegan friend, enjoyed every part of their meals. The vegan lady enjoyed her soup (the one mentioned above) and the dessert...which I believe was a raspberry sorbet. The bland part of the night was her main dish: Orechiette Pasta with Broccoli Rabe, roasted cherry tomatoes and white beans. The restaurant noise level is on the loud side. I enjoyed the two-person live music band played at the end of the night, not sure if this is a common occurrence. This was my first time in Fort Greene and Olea. I would love to explore this neighborhood more and try Olea's non-prix fixe menu. :)",4.0

"I'm not embarrassed that the weekend brunch hostess at Olea now knows me.  Perhaps I should be, but given the delight of this place, I'm not.  Olea knows how to do brunch, and has fully satisfied all at our table each time I've gone.The staff are very friendly and helpful, happy to answer any questions or provide suggestions.  The ambiance is lovely, if a little loud.  But the decor is very welcoming and they have avoided the temptation to cram in too many tables.The coffee is fantastic as are the brunch cocktails, particularly the mango mimosa.  Olea also has a number of great options for non-meat eaters, while still pleasing to the carnivores.  The turkish breakfast is a delicious collection of cilantro eggs, fattoush, yogurt and pita.  My favorite though is the parmesan toast - a scrumptious pile of cheesy toast, poached eggs, sweet peas, scallions and an amazing tangy avegolomono sauce with a great kick.  The drawback is that I am not the only one to have discovered this gem.  Get there by 10:30 on the weekend if you want to avoid a potentially long wait.  It's worth rolling out of bed early!",5.0
"Excellent place. I've been many times over the years and the food is always great and the service is always attentive. Food: I really enjoy the arugula salad with the goat cheese croquettes. Delish!! Also, the shrimp app, Greek-style; the sauce is delightful sopped up with the bread that comes before the meal. Yummy! I have never been disappointed with either app, they have always been delicious. They make me happy. Wine: Red Stag, always good. Bar is fun with good bartenders and friendly fellow customers. Tables are fun and comfy with good wait staff. Great decor, good ambience. It's a very pretty restaurant. Plus: the bathroom is cute! That's always nice. ***updated 6/1/2013. ****My dinner partner recently got the pork paella and said it was delish. The chicken is also good according to another dinner partner. Also the bacon-wrapped dates are said to be good by a dinner partner. Everyone who comes to this restaurant with me LOVES the food, the ambience, everything about it. It's my go-to place to take friends and relatives. All in all: I honestly think this is my favorite restaurant in both Brooklyn and Manhattan.",5.0

"Olea is a quality, warm, inviting place to fulfill your eatin' needs. I don't know if I'd recommend going too far out of your way for it, but it does make for excellent neighborhood/already-in-the-area dining.My favorite part of the meal were the tapas: the grilled baby octopus (which combines the deliciousness of eating octopus with the vindictive glee of eating veal) was perfectly light, chewy, and with a touch of crispness.

"Searched for ""brunch"" on Google Maps. Thanks Google!The wait for Saturday brunch on 12/1 was about 40min for a table for two around 12:30pm, but we sipped mimosas on the sidewalk while we waited. And after less than 10 minutes, we were offered seats at the bar. This was great because the bartender had already given us great service when we ordered our drinks, and went out of his way to run outside and give me a book of matches after I told him I didn't have a light.The decor is classy, relaxing and comfortable. I tend to not pay attention to this sort of thing; usually when I ""notice"" something about the environment of a restaurant it's because something is off. So when I say I didn't notice anything, it's a compliment. It was warm and cozy, music was a quiet background murmur, and even though we were seated at the bar I didn't feel like I was crowded by the people on either side of us.I didn't even look at the regular menu, I was focused on the insert of brunch specials for the day. My friend and I decided everything looked so good that we would split (almost) everything. I had the hot apple cider with whiskey and cinnamon, and we took the spicy marinated olives, homemade ricotta w/ caramelized apples, and creamy spanish almond soup as they were ready. The soup was extremely rich and filling, I was surprised how good it was. The flavors of all three plates really complemented each other; and my friend and I both looked at each other in surprise after clearing our plates: we just got brunch without eggs and potatoes, didn't we?Minus the alcohol, we spent $20 on food. We left full and happy. Will be back.",5.0

Been meaning to write a review of this place.  Easily my favorite restaurant in Fort Green.  They have a great happy hour.  Always tough to choose between their tapas and entrees.  I'm not sure if they take reservations but the place is always packed.  Had a short rib entree at the bar with a house wine and couldn't have been happier.  Just be prepared for a wait especially if you're dining during prime hours.,5.0
"Searched for ""brunch"" on Google Maps. Thanks Google!The wait for Saturday brunch on 12/1 was about 40min for a table for two around 12:30pm, but we sipped mimosas on the sidewalk while we waited. And after less than 10 minutes, we were offered seats at the bar. This was great because the bartender had already given us great service when we ordered our drinks, and went out of his way to run outside and give me a book of matches after I told him I didn't have a light.The decor is classy, relaxing and comfortable. I tend to not pay attention to this sort of thing; usually when I ""notice"" something about the environment of a restaurant it's because something is off. So when I say I didn't notice anything, it's a compliment. It was warm and cozy, music was a quiet background murmur, and even though we were seated at the bar I didn't feel like I was crowded by the people on either side of us.I didn't even look at the regular menu, I was focused on the insert of brunch specials for the day. My friend and I decided everything looked so good that we would split (almost) everything. I had the hot apple cider with whiskey and cinnamon, and we took the spicy marinated olives, homemade ricotta w/ caramelized apples, and creamy spanish almond soup as they were ready. The soup was extremely rich and filling, I was surprised how good it was. The flavors of all three plates really complemented each other; and my friend and I both looked at each other in surprise after clearing our plates: we just got brunch without eggs and potatoes, didn't we?Minus the alcohol, we spent $20 on food. We left full and happy. Will be back.",5.0

"Went here on NYE before the coldplay/jay z concert and it was a perfect pick. About a 5-10 minute walk to the arena, and we got a reservation at the last minute. They had a pre fixe menu but you could order off the regular tapas menu too, which we did. Everything was delicious, especially the lamb meatballs and the branzino. It's a cute little space with friendly servers in a nice neighborhood.",5.0
"This cute little place serves up pretty tasty brunch. I love the tiles and vaguely Middle Eastern cafe decor. The atmosphere is charming and homey, with rich woods and plush cushions especially ideal for brunch. The chorizo and manchego sandwich was quite good, as was the salad and patatas bravas it came with. My friend enjoyed her pita with roasted beet skordalia dip and her home fries. Prices were pretty decent, about average for brunch ($7-14). I'd come back.",4.0

"I hated this place when it first arrived in the neighborhood.  Why?  I have no idea.  I'm like that. After week upon week of my wife dragging me here for brunch, however, I've decided that I can barely live without the cheese and chorizo sandwich.  It's pretty much the only thing I'll eat when I come here, even though everything else appears to be good.  The portion of sandwich, potatoes, and salad are generous and the taste of all three are very good.  That said, I've had the French Toast (good, but not great), the bacon (properly crispy but miraculously without distinct flavor), the chocolate croissants (good), lamb sandwich (also good, but not amazing), and a variety of other things I can't remember but were also pretty good.  I've never had anything bad here except the eggs on Parmesan toast with peas -- altogether too many peas and the description makes it sound infinitely better than it actually is.  All that said, of course, it's not perfect and so it gets four stars.",4.0

"I have been to this place a few times, it's almost become a go-to spot for my girlfriend and I. And that's for a few reasons:There are few tapas on the menu that don't satisfy. In particular, the lamb keftedes are a major success, some of the best meatballs I have ever had. Definitely better than any I've had in my hometown of Athens, Greece, where the dish originated. Also better than the meatballs at Philadelphia's Villa de Roma, which iron chef Michael Symon claims to be the best on the east coast (another iron chef who has fallen short). The olea balls have a minty, almost sweet taste, balanced perfectly by the sharpness of the goat cheese and tomato sauce, or ""gravy"" as the Italians (and Michael Symon) say. In fact, I would take MS out to dinner just so he could try these lamb keftedes to reconsider his conclusion. I am confident he would at least feel slightly agitated upon his hasty proclamation of the Villa de Roma meatball, if not denounce his palette potential altogether. Also of particular deliciousness are the falafel crusted artichokes, as well as the haloumi, and the almond stuffed dates wrapped in bacon. Don't bother getting the cocktails, they are indeed too strong. But it doesn't matter, they have a very nice selection of wines, and my favorite is actually one the cheaper selections. The desert port from Portugal is also superb.We have always had excellent service whenever we have gone. Really nice waiters who are very accommodating and attentive within measure. Not the cheapest restaurant, but it's nice to share smaller plates instead of having to work through massive one-person entrees. The balanced portions alone are worth the added expense.Also worth mentioning the excellent location. Although it's right on busy Lafayette Ave, Olea has a great atmosphere, and doesn't feel nearly as crowded and bustly as Dekalb. If you're luck enough to catch a performance by their virtuoso accordianist, so much the better.UPDATE: As of Valentines day week, I went back another time, I think it was Wednesday night, in search of another sure to satisfy meal. Good ol' Olea, you never let me down! We indulged over the excellent tapas, lamb keftedes taking the lead role once again. But tonight, in search of the truly excellent, we decided to give desert a try. We got the dark chocolate torte. It was exquisite. Light, fluffy texture, sweet and well balanced by the almost bitter darkness. It came with a plop of fluffy whip cream and a generous scoop of vanilla gelato. Together the ingredients created a fusion akin to the power of poetry, with a melt-in-my-mouth sensation that left us satisfied.

"I have never been disappointed with the dinners I have experienced at Olea over the past year since moving to the area, but this review is of the brunch on a recent Sunday.1/2/2011, I arrive @ 11am in the hopes of being seated sooner than later because my friends and I had a show to catch @ BAM.We weren't seated until close to 1145am (which is why i took off a star), but the meal and those before it are ALWAYS worth the wait.I love that the menu really mixed it up with some savory and some sweet options. It was also nice for a Brunch menu to offer some breakfasty items and some lunchy ones.I opted for the french toast with fresh fruit salad and a raspberry mimosa. Really well made. I could never finish the large portion, but others at the table had no problem finishing it for me. The best part was that they used REAL maple syrup on the side.For the table we had a few tapas. We shared the almond stuffed dates-YUMMY! Also, the Tzitziki and pita-YUMMMMMMY! Others at the table drank the bloody mary which had a very fresh looking horseradish used. It is not often you see this.My friends had egg dishes. One had polenta in it which they loved! NO complaints and nothing left on those 4 plates. Good times!The waiter was really nice and was happy to try his best to make it out in time to get our seats at BAM with no sweat. I LOVE OLEA. Day or night-I consider this my go to spot.",4.0
"Olea's a lovely space, but I'm not entirely sure it's a lovely place. That doesn't seem to be hurting it any, as we waited a good deal longer than the hostess promised for a table to open up.The dinner menu promises a lot of deliciousness, and in terms of the appetizers, it delivers. But the entrées, I don't know: the pastas underwhelmed, but the meat dishes won favorable reviews. All the same, it's probably more than you're willing to spend (and more than you're capable of eating), so perhaps a light meal out of tapas would be the best route here. I could see how this'd be the restaurant you go to every Sunday evening if you already live in Fort Greene, but it's not the kind of restaurant you'd seek out even if you lived in a neighborhood next to Fort Greene.",3.0
"A reasonably great dining experience has been marred by a credit card debacle - I split a recent bill 50/50 with my date only to find that I had been charged both the half AND the full amount.I called to query, and the lady said that they 'accidentally' put the full amount through on my card first and that it would be refunded [my statement still says 'processing']. In the meantime, I'm down an extra $89!! And as consolation she said ""oh we must get 10 of these calls a day."" So fix the system?! Stop it!There was no ill-intent behind the faulty transaction, but it's a seriously annoying slip up for anyone watching their pennies.Otherwise, it's a pleasant neighborhood spot to eat; the ambiance, sparkling bathroom, and live Spanish guitar all add a little something. It's not the most powerful punch of 'Mediterranean' flavors around, but the dishes are interesting enough to make up for that.Just watch the card swipe after you go!",3.0
"Came for brunch.  They serve both breakfast and lunch items.Patatas were excellent, especially with the spicy mayo on top on one version.The bread was too chewy tough - my jaw got a workout eating it.  It would be a good bread to dip into a mussel stew, but stand alone or in a sandwich, it could've been easier to gnaw at.The chorizo sandwich was decent, but the chorizo could've been more tender, good flavor tho, and again, they used the bread that would dislodge a loose tooth if you had one. The omelet with salmon was decent.  I wish that if they wrote smoked salmon it would indeed be 'smoked' versus 'cooked'.  It's a big difference.  When you say smoked, it implies salmon like a lox bagel. I dislike cooked salmon, and love raw salmon, so this is a big pet peeve of mine.",3.0

"I'm going to file this under ""restaurants that make me wish I spent more time eating near my school.""Ma Dukes came to town, and after the obligatory tour of where her baby girl makes some arts, we were looking for something close for lunch. And Ma Dukes had arbitrarily decided to put an assload of confusing dietary restrictions on our afternoon meal, as she's recently become paranoid about her cholesterol. So after finding this place on Yelp we stopped in. It was probably around 2:30 on a Thursday and the place was fairly empty, maybe 3 other tables were occupied with people who seemed to be finishing up. The service was initially as slow as slow could be on the slowest day slow ever slowed (we're talking 20 minutes to get water and place our order IN A BASICALLY EMPTY RESTAURANT), but there was only one waiter, and he was adorable and apologetic once he finally showed up, so I can't hate there. But I can imagine this could be really, really irritating if you were in a rush, or if the place got crowded and overwhelmed the staff or something.THE FOOD WAS GREAT. Ma Dukes got some pita with 3 dips appetizer thing as her meal (see prior paragraph in re: arbitrary dietary restrictions) and the pita was fresh and warm. I only tried the hummus (because it elicited ""oh wow, try this hummus"" from my mom) but she seemed very happy with the red pepper-ish dip and the herbed feta something as well. I got the falafel crusted artichoke hearts sandwich, which combines my love for falafel with my attraction to artichoke hearts, and it was absolutely ridiculous. Perfect. Awesome. I could probably eat this sandwich every day. It comes with these amazing little fried potato friends in some kind of magical wonder sauce, too, so that was pretty beautiful and wonderful.

From the oh so tasty almond stuffed bacon wrapped dates to the yummy spicy feta dip & more... Everything me and my friends have eaten here has been Great!  Always a treat when I come to Bklyn.  Bonus acoustic guitar player last night too!,5.0
"Super crowded brunch hotspot. I went with some friends and we all enjoyed the experience. I wanted to try so many things on the menu but could only get one. I had the French omelet with goat cheese, salmon and leeks with potatoes, a side salad and baguette. An other friend had the raved about Turkish breakfast, the parmesan toast and the Greek yogurt with fruit. Everyone liked their meal. It was warm in there on this freezing day and I would certain recommend this place for brunch or other.",4.0
"I have never been disappointed with the dinners I have experienced at Olea over the past year since moving to the area, but this review is of the brunch on a recent Sunday.1/2/2011, I arrive @ 11am in the hopes of being seated sooner than later because my friends and I had a show to catch @ BAM.We weren't seated until close to 1145am (which is why i took off a star), but the meal and those before it are ALWAYS worth the wait.I love that the menu really mixed it up with some savory and some sweet options. It was also nice for a Brunch menu to offer some breakfasty items and some lunchy ones.I opted for the french toast with fresh fruit salad and a raspberry mimosa. Really well made. I could never finish the large portion, but others at the table had no problem finishing it for me. The best part was that they used REAL maple syrup on the side.For the table we had a few tapas. We shared the almond stuffed dates-YUMMY! Also, the Tzitziki and pita-YUMMMMMMY! Others at the table drank the bloody mary which had a very fresh looking horseradish used. It is not often you see this.My friends had egg dishes. One had polenta in it which they loved! NO complaints and nothing left on those 4 plates. Good times!The waiter was really nice and was happy to try his best to make it out in time to get our seats at BAM with no sweat. I LOVE OLEA. Day or night-I consider this my go to spot.",4.0
"Olea's a lovely space, but I'm not entirely sure it's a lovely place. That doesn't seem to be hurting it any, as we waited a good deal longer than the hostess promised for a table to open up.The dinner menu promises a lot of deliciousness, and in terms of the appetizers, it delivers. But the entrées, I don't know: the pastas underwhelmed, but the meat dishes won favorable reviews. All the same, it's probably more than you're willing to spend (and more than you're capable of eating), so perhaps a light meal out of tapas would be the best route here. I could see how this'd be the restaurant you go to every Sunday evening if you already live in Fort Greene, but it's not the kind of restaurant you'd seek out even if you lived in a neighborhood next to Fort Greene.",3.0
"A reasonably great dining experience has been marred by a credit card debacle - I split a recent bill 50/50 with my date only to find that I had been charged both the half AND the full amount.I called to query, and the lady said that they 'accidentally' put the full amount through on my card first and that it would be refunded [my statement still says 'processing']. In the meantime, I'm down an extra $89!! And as consolation she said ""oh we must get 10 of these calls a day."" So fix the system?! Stop it!There was no ill-intent behind the faulty transaction, but it's a seriously annoying slip up for anyone watching their pennies.Otherwise, it's a pleasant neighborhood spot to eat; the ambiance, sparkling bathroom, and live Spanish guitar all add a little something. It's not the most powerful punch of 'Mediterranean' flavors around, but the dishes are interesting enough to make up for that.Just watch the card swipe after you go!",3.0
"Came for brunch.  They serve both breakfast and lunch items.Patatas were excellent, especially with the spicy mayo on top on one version.The bread was too chewy tough - my jaw got a workout eating it.  It would be a good bread to dip into a mussel stew, but stand alone or in a sandwich, it could've been easier to gnaw at.The chorizo sandwich was decent, but the chorizo could've been more tender, good flavor tho, and again, they used the bread that would dislodge a loose tooth if you had one. The omelet with salmon was decent.  I wish that if they wrote smoked salmon it would indeed be 'smoked' versus 'cooked'.  It's a big difference.  When you say smoked, it implies salmon like a lox bagel. I dislike cooked salmon, and love raw salmon, so this is a big pet peeve of mine.",3.0

"I'm going to file this under ""restaurants that make me wish I spent more time eating near my school.""Ma Dukes came to town, and after the obligatory tour of where her baby girl makes some arts, we were looking for something close for lunch. And Ma Dukes had arbitrarily decided to put an assload of confusing dietary restrictions on our afternoon meal, as she's recently become paranoid about her cholesterol. So after finding this place on Yelp we stopped in. It was probably around 2:30 on a Thursday and the place was fairly empty, maybe 3 other tables were occupied with people who seemed to be finishing up. The service was initially as slow as slow could be on the slowest day slow ever slowed (we're talking 20 minutes to get water and place our order IN A BASICALLY EMPTY RESTAURANT), but there was only one waiter, and he was adorable and apologetic once he finally showed up, so I can't hate there. But I can imagine this could be really, really irritating if you were in a rush, or if the place got crowded and overwhelmed the staff or something.THE FOOD WAS GREAT. Ma Dukes got some pita with 3 dips appetizer thing as her meal (see prior paragraph in re: arbitrary dietary restrictions) and the pita was fresh and warm. I only tried the hummus (because it elicited ""oh wow, try this hummus"" from my mom) but she seemed very happy with the red pepper-ish dip and the herbed feta something as well. I got the falafel crusted artichoke hearts sandwich, which combines my love for falafel with my attraction to artichoke hearts, and it was absolutely ridiculous. Perfect. Awesome. I could probably eat this sandwich every day. It comes with these amazing little fried potato friends in some kind of magical wonder sauce, too, so that was pretty beautiful and wonderful. So... hooray, sandwich!",4.0

"Came here for Brunch at 3pm on a Saturday and would give it overall a 3.5/5 stars, but I'll bump it up to 4 because of the friendly hospitality and ambience (comfy pillows!)

I can eat these all day, you definitely have to try these. Green Eggs and Lamb ($13)- The lamb were links of lamb sausage and the eggs were normal eggs with some green veggies. Everything was good, but not great... it was a very normal brunch type food that can be easily made at home. Savory Parmesan French Toast ($12)- I was really in the mood for poached eggs and ordered the this, but I was not really satisfied. The toast was hard and a bit bitter that I only took a bite. I just nibbled around my potato bites and ate one of the eggs. I did not get the savory warmth that I usually get when I eat brunch, my favorite meal of the week.The drinks and appetizers were actually more satisfying than the actual meal.

"A group of us (6) recently visited Olea. A first time for most of us. We had reservations and were seated pretty much right away.

When ordering your entree and you have the option of small or regular size, go with the small. Unless, you are really hungry or want to take home most of it. I ordered the regular, gave some for others to taste, felt like I was eating forever and not making a dent in my pasta dish! I took home about half of it. The salads are large enough to share as well. No room for dessert for any of us. Our waitress was wonderful! Very helpful, attentive, always smiling and making sure everything was good and that we had everything that we needed. She was PERFECT! Couldn't have asked for better service. I WILL of course be back. My only complaint was the live, 2 man band that was playing. We were seated right next to them and it made having a conversation a bit difficult!

"Living in new york, you know that you have hundreds, if not thousands of options of places to eat, be it brunch,lunch,dinner,apps, whatever.

When i spend my money on food, i want it to be delicious, satisfying and worth the penny. Every damn time i have eaten at Olea, and mind you, it has been MANY a times, i have been thoroughly satisfied. Whether its the Green Eggs and Lamb( oh man, that merguez!), the Sangria Marinated Hanger Steak tapa with those amazing pickled onions, those Blue point oyster( which, by the way, never even liked oysters until i ate one of those beauties), the Orecchiette, the bacon-wrapped dates, the boquerones, the patatas bravas, oh i could go through the whole menu! All in all, my point is, dont complain about the wait, because in the end, none of that will matter when you realize you have just eaten something, no matter what it is off the menu, that you will not be able to forget. I am a true, die hard fan who will always be coming back until they close those doors on me once and for all.",5.0
"What a great neighborhood gem!  My wife and I went here last Friday night around 8pm and the place was packed.  FIlled with tons of people like us in our late 20's and early 30's.  A packed bar, noisy in a good way, and a very nice classical guitar player playing Spanish-style music.  The decor was great too -- big wood rafters, stucco walls, large red floor tiles, and big wooden tables and chairs.The food was also fantastic.  I think we had about 5 tapas and one entree salad between the two of us, plus a very nice bottle of Verdejo wine (which was reasonably priced at $28).  As for vegetarian dishes, the mixed green salad was much better than a regular salad and had very interesting veggies.  We also had some sort of a farro and yogurt thing that was very delicious.  The hummus was fine, but not superb.  Then there were the falafel crusted artichoke hearts, which were good, but we couldn't really taste the artichoke.The two meat dishes I ordered were divine.  The steak was moist, soft, and flavorfully oily, with a side of nice greens.  The best dish was the lamb meatballs in tomato sauce with whipped feta.As this place is walking distance for us, it's perfect for a low to medium-key place for a romantic and fun Friday night dinner.  We will definitely be doing back.",5.0

I wish they had put apples in them though.I had their sausage pasta, which was DELICIOUS. I am not too big on pasta, but I basically inhaled the whole meal.

"****disclaimer : really late review that was sitting here unfinished for about a year OH WELL****Dan you are the man! He created an incredible selection of dishes for his place during the brooklyn dine-in restaurant week and luckily my friends and I were able to take full advantage of it.. whether or not any of the items made it onto the regular menu I don't know since I have not been back, but definitely intend to visit again soon.. I chose the Brandade Croquettes (whipped salt cod with crispy light beer batter served with harissa aioli, niçoise olives) as my starter, they tasted even more amazing than it sounds.. one of my friends had the Lamb Kefteddes (Lamb meatballs with slightly spicy tomato sauce, Feta cheese, and fresh parsley) and it also rocked but not as hard as mine lolI don't see any desserts on their regular menu but damn the desserts they had for restaurant week on the menu were pretty much untoppable.. the warm almond torte was my particular fave but the other ones I tried were also mouth watering, if they participate in restaurant week again I am sooo there! The excellent dishes plus a really warm ambiance and not an overly dim lighting, lets not forget the live music which wasn't annoying at all.. what more can I say? just go if you are ever in the area, or even if you're not! lol",5.0
"It saddens me to see such wonderful space located on the perfect corner diminished by mediocre food and poor service. The patatas bravas are delicious and should be consumed immediately and often. The dips are delicious also, especially the feta and green pea.  Well done. The falafel ""crusted"" Artichoke hearts are really poor - really missing - soggy and relatively brown....i simply don't get it - they're frankly terrible. The rest - ho hum....Entrees are limited - Whole Branzino and steak are ok, but standards - they should be good.  But the pork chop missed badly. Poor char with sloppy mash and soaky cabbage - which seemed so out of place - and then arrested by the garlic tzatziki.  Save that for the lamb! (which, ironically, is not on the menu - but should be).The worst part, however, is the service.  It's slow, and cumbersome, and ditzy.  That's almost ok except our waitress double charged us once for some drinks and apps.  Two apps were sent back as mistakes and then delivered again - corrected.  Later, when she brought the bill, after it was charged, we called her out on it after noticing after the fact... she replied, ""yes, i know, sorry, i just ran it through anyway."" No explanation.When pressed she agreed to ""try to fix it"" but ended up charging us for the whole meal again.  Had to call Visa ... Unapologetic - amazing....",2.0

Had a drink at bar( I had Valencia w/ makers mark which was great) before we finished drinks table was ready. Server was very good,didn't rush us as this was our first visit and were unfamiliar w/ menu. This is I think is a close approximation of what was ordered,fried olives,bacon wrapped almond stuffed dates(wow) fried chick peas,flash fried Brussel sprouts( double wow) burratta, romesco, Spanish pitza(Elle's favorite, ) goat cheese croquettes w/ honey and fried haloumi. All these were tapas and shared between us, I must say everything was super and hard to say what was better.  We also got 2 entrees to share a pork paella and an orecchiette w/sausage and white beans. These also were delish. We split a dessert which was our third choice( only cause first 2 choices were 86'd, very small quibble ) All in all an amazing experience which for most anybody would be 5 star, but I've never given 5 as I think that would be perfection in dining which come to reflect this was may have been.

"Came here on Saturday night after a show at BAM. It was around 9PM and the place was packed. The wait was going to be 45 minutes, but luckily a couple bailed before us and we were seated right away. I had a white-mango sangria and it was ok. In the end, I think I prefer a red sangria. Since they had options for tapas, we decided on a tapas night. The tapas were decent, but far from excellent. You want good tapas? Go to Las Ramblas in the city. Thats where the action is ;-)The run down:1) marinated anchovies - very good dish, but really, its hard to mess this up.2) Swiss chard gratin - excellent, the cheese wasn't the only thing you tasted, the chard was cooked to perfection3) falafel artichoke heart - this dish might as well have just been falafel. You could barely taste the artichoke, and thats a bad thing. Artichoke is very humble vegetable and in this case, the flamboyant falafel took over. How sad ;-(4) Brandades croquettes - way too salty. this could have been so much more. I generally love croquettes and this is the only time, I have to cringe ;-( Shame on you Olea!Dessert:  vanilla-date tart of some sort. It was good, but nothing memorable. I wasn't very impressed with their tapas, but this place was swarming with people, so I am curious as to what the hype is all about.FYI: I sat by the window and it was very cold the night we went, and the my tooshie was cold the whole time.

Whether its the Green Eggs and Lamb( oh man, that merguez!), the Sangria Marinated Hanger Steak tapa with those amazing pickled onions, those Blue point oyster( which, by the way, never even liked oysters until i ate one of those beauties), the Orecchiette, the bacon-wrapped dates, the boquerones, the patatas bravas, oh i could go through the whole menu! All in all, my point is, dont complain about the wait, because in the end, none of that will matter when you realize you have just eaten something, no matter what it is off the menu, that you will not be able to forget. I am a true, die hard fan who will always be coming back until they close those doors on me once and for all.",5.0
"What a great neighborhood gem!  My wife and I went here last Friday night around 8pm and the place was packed.  FIlled with tons of people like us in our late 20's and early 30's.  A packed bar, noisy in a good way, and a very nice classical guitar player playing Spanish-style music.  The decor was great too -- big wood rafters, stucco walls, large red floor tiles, and big wooden tables and chairs.The food was also fantastic.  I think we had about 5 tapas and one entree salad between the two of us, plus a very nice bottle of Verdejo wine (which was reasonably priced at $28).  As for vegetarian dishes, the mixed green salad was much better than a regular salad and had very interesting veggies.  We also had some sort of a farro and yogurt thing that was very delicious.  The hummus was fine, but not superb.  Then there were the falafel crusted artichoke hearts, which were good, but we couldn't really taste the artichoke.The two meat dishes I ordered were divine.  The steak was moist, soft, and flavorfully oily, with a side of nice greens.  The best dish was the lamb meatballs in tomato sauce with whipped feta.As this place is walking distance for us, it's perfect for a low to medium-key place for a romantic and fun Friday night dinner.  We will definitely be doing back.",5.0
"After leaving the Brooklyn Flea,  we stumbled upon this cozy little place nearby.Ofcourse, I yelped this place and since they had good reviews we decided to try it. We ordered a pitcher of sangria and it was delicious! I've had sangria where I can't really taste the alcohol at all, but theirs was made to perfection. I wish they had put apples in them though.I had their sausage pasta, which was DELICIOUS. I am not too big on pasta, but I basically inhaled the whole meal. We ordered a bunch of tapas as well, and they were all reasonably prices and all very well-prepared. My particular favorite was the baby octopus and potatas. YUM!I WOULD LOVE TO COME HERE AGAIN!",5.0
"This is where I went on my first date with my now-husband, so I have fond memories:)A creative Mediterranean menu with Italian, Turkish, Greek, Israeli influences will definitely satisfy the palate yearning for something different. Definitely not a fast food joint, you'd want to go here for a long conversational meal with friends, perhaps before or after a film for some of their excellent wine selections (try the Massaya from Lebanon, it's exquisite!!) and some dessert.  The decor makes you feel you have entered into a place in the Middle East, with a palm tree right in the center, tiles, mirrors, pillowed-seating on the side...Outside seating available seasonally. Reasonably priced with friendly staff.",4.0
"****disclaimer : really late review that was sitting here unfinished for about a year OH WELL****Dan you are the man! He created an incredible selection of dishes for his place during the brooklyn dine-in restaurant week and luckily my friends and I were able to take full advantage of it.. whether or not any of the items made it onto the regular menu I don't know since I have not been back, but definitely intend to visit again soon.. I chose the Brandade Croquettes (whipped salt cod with crispy light beer batter served with harissa aioli, niçoise olives) as my starter, they tasted even more amazing than it sounds.. one of my friends had the Lamb Kefteddes (Lamb meatballs with slightly spicy tomato sauce, Feta cheese, and fresh parsley) and it also rocked but not as hard as mine lolI don't see any desserts on their regular menu but damn the desserts they had for restaurant week on the menu were pretty much untoppable.. the warm almond torte was my particular fave but the other ones I tried were also mouth watering, if they participate in restaurant week again I am sooo there! The excellent dishes plus a really warm ambiance and not an overly dim lighting, lets not forget the live music which wasn't annoying at all.. what more can I say? just go if you are ever in the area, or even if you're not! lol",5.0
"It saddens me to see such wonderful space located on the perfect corner diminished by mediocre food and poor service. The patatas bravas are delicious and should be consumed immediately and often. The dips are delicious also, especially the feta and green pea.  Well done. The falafel ""crusted"" Artichoke hearts are really poor - really missing - soggy and relatively brown....i simply don't get it - they're frankly terrible. The rest - ho hum....Entrees are limited - Whole Branzino and steak are ok, but standards - they should be good.  But the pork chop missed badly. Poor char with sloppy mash and soaky cabbage - which seemed so out of place - and then arrested by the garlic tzatziki.  Save that for the lamb! (which, ironically, is not on the menu - but should be).The worst part, however, is the service.  It's slow, and cumbersome, and ditzy.  That's almost ok except our waitress double charged us once for some drinks and apps.  Two apps were sent back as mistakes and then delivered again - corrected.  Later, when she brought the bill, after it was charged, we called her out on it after noticing after the fact... she replied, ""yes, i know, sorry, i just ran it through anyway."" No explanation.When pressed she agreed to ""try to fix it"" but ended up charging us for the whole meal again.  Had to call Visa ... Unapologetic - amazing....",2.0

"We went to olea,sat 9/21w/ party of 4. With no reservation ,we arrived at 730pm. We were told it would be about 20 minute wait for table. Had a drink at bar( I had Valencia w/ makers mark which was great) before we finished drinks table was ready. Server was very good,didn't rush us as this was our first visit and were unfamiliar w/ menu. This is I think is a close approximation of what was ordered,fried olives,bacon wrapped almond stuffed dates(wow) fried chick peas,flash fried Brussel sprouts( double wow) burratta, romesco, Spanish pitza(Elle's favorite, ) goat cheese croquettes w/ honey and fried haloumi. All these were tapas and shared between us, I must say everything was super and hard to say what was better.  We also got 2 entrees to share a pork paella and an orecchiette w/sausage and white beans. These also were delish. We split a dessert which was our third choice( only cause first 2 choices were 86'd, very small quibble ) All in all an amazing experience which for most anybody would be 5 star, but I've never given 5 as I think that would be perfection in dining which come to reflect this was may have been. F ' ing phenomenal",4.0
"Came here on Saturday night after a show at BAM. It was around 9PM and the place was packed. The wait was going to be 45 minutes, but luckily a couple bailed before us and we were seated right away. I had a white-mango sangria and it was ok. In the end, I think I prefer a red sangria. Since they had options for tapas, we decided on a tapas night. The tapas were decent, but far from excellent. You want good tapas? Go to Las Ramblas in the city. Thats where the action is ;-)The run down:1) marinated anchovies - very good dish, but really, its hard to mess this up.2) Swiss chard gratin - excellent, the cheese wasn't the only thing you tasted, the chard was cooked to perfection3) falafel artichoke heart - this dish might as well have just been falafel. You could barely taste the artichoke, and thats a bad thing. Artichoke is very humble vegetable and in this case, the flamboyant falafel took over. How sad ;-(4) Brandades croquettes - way too salty. this could have been so much more. I generally love croquettes and this is the only time, I have to cringe ;-( Shame on you Olea!Dessert:  vanilla-date tart of some sort. It was good, but nothing memorable. I wasn't very impressed with their tapas, but this place was swarming with people, so I am curious as to what the hype is all about.FYI: I sat by the window and it was very cold the night we went, and the my tooshie was cold the whole time. Their window wasn't insulated enough even despite all the pillows to thwart off the cold!",3.0

"I started a Yelp account just to review this place. My husband and I visited Olea on Christmas Eve. We'd heard from countless people that we just HAD to go, so we did. It's worth saying here, it is VERY tricky to draw two die-hard Manhattanites out to Brooklyn when there are so many incredible places in the city, but so many of our friends raved so much about this place, we finally succumbed.  We weren't able to go for the infamous brunch, but our late night dinner was a trip through the culinary fantastic. Upon arrival we were thrilled with the space. Warm, mildly eclectic, moderately decorated for the holiday and deliciously inviting. The lighting was dim, but not too dim. The decor reminded me of someone's home - some very tasteful someone who might have traveled the world and brought back treasures to share with his guests. Succinctly, we felt welcomed.  Being Christmas, we were in an adventurous and celebratory mood and asked the server to make our selections. If I am ever sentenced to be executed, I will request my last meal from Olea. Deep fried olives, French-Style Shrimp in white wine, lemon, butter, lemon thyme, White Anchovies with almonds & arugula and Dates wrapped in bacon stuffed with ricotta and almonds began the culinary journey through the Mediterranean. Each  dish was more delectable than the last, and we had only just begun.I should interject here that the server was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu, the wine list and the designer drink list. His suggestions for pairings were spot on. Entree's were Mediterranean Branzino and Grilled Ribeye Steak both cooked to perfection and though the FOUR appetizers should have had us so stuffed we couldn't finish these scrumptious dishes, finish them we did. Every last morsel. Then our server, realizing our state, suggested an aperitif which perfectly readied us for the final course. Sinfully decadent Gelato with a shot of espresso poured over.  We were sated and happy and ready for the holiday to follow. It was a wonderful meal and a memorable evening. We will indeed travel back to Brooklyn for the infamous Olea brunch. And that's saying a lot.",5.0
"Just had brunch here on the recommendation of one of our friends who lives in the area.  We went with outside seating because the wait for inside was a bit long.  Arrived at around 11: 30 and the place was full.  We ordered the Turkish breakfast and the chorizo/manchego sandwich.The turkish breakfast has ""green eggs"" (scrambled eggs with fresh cilantro) and eggplant salad, tzatziki, and fatoush salad.  It was good but I'm not a big fan of eggplant.  The eggs weren't the super creamy and soft kind, just normal texture but a very nice and fresh taste.The chorizo + manchego sandwich was quite good.  There wasn't too much chorizo and it wasn't that spicy.  The sandwich did have a good balance of flavors though.  Unfortunately, the patatas bravas that came with it didn't really have the kick necessary to call them that.  However, I inhaled that sandwich pretty quick.I also ordered a fresh OJ and my gf had coffee and later a pomegrante juice. Overall, a very satisfying brunch.  It's probably closer to 3.5 stars than 4 but I may be biased from an amazing experience later on that day at Diner Restaurant.",4.0
"This is owned by the same people who own Pequena, but there must be a different chef because the food is more consistently delicious.

"I came to Olea with some friends after a half-hearted browsing at the freshly re-opened BK Flea. Once we got to Ft. Greene we realized we were way too hungover/hungry to pretend to be enthralled by overpriced vintage typewriters so we went to the first restaurant that looked like it could craft a decent mimosa. The wait was a good 20 minutes, but since I don't know Ft. Greene I'd rather wait than wander the streets aimlessly looking for an alternative spot. We got a sick window spot and I was able to quickly order a mimosa. The menu was interesting, if inspirationally random. It's kind of a 'mediterranean tavern', I suppose. My friend ordered a lamb meatball sandwich, which was pretty good if the predictible tomato-feta-lamb combo. My other friend got poached eggs on toast (more like on soggy chewy bread) which was overly flavored by the peas they lumped on top. Nothing was bad but nothing would have me running back for more. I'm only ignoring my dish because I ordered a simple chicken caesar, which in no way failed to live up to my minimal expectations. Actually, scratch that--the chicken on top had clearly been cooked on a grill either with or directly after some seafood, since it was basically marinated in some fish or shrimp. The effect was weird but not bad. I kept checking to make sure it wasn't secretly some salmon. We did, however, share a plate of homemade (warm!!) chocolate crossaints which might be worth a Sunday trip on the G train.

"Seriously, over 70 reviews and a plus four rating?  Yelp is normally on the money, or not way off it, so we went here last night for some tapas expecting good things.

I am at a loss to understand how this can be recommended by anyone unless the owners of this restaurant have 70 very good friends or all the prior reviewers have been infected by a case of restaurant localitis. The hummus and pitta was store bought (and not from Dean and Deluca but Target's discount range).  The pittas were just terrible.  The sauteed mushrooms had had the sauteed swapped for being poached in cheap oil.  The lamb meatballs were so far away from being descended from actual meat I could have used them to patch holes in a bike tire and the salted cod croquette was  an off tasting puff of rubbish. A truly bad meal. Really really bad.  If I had to pick something positive about the place it would be the cosy atmosphere and that the glass of sangria didn't make me ill.  The only problem was that as we sat at the bar with our faces contorting in the horror with the shock of quite how bad the food was we had to try to try and hide this from the waiter.",1.0

"Small intimate dining area with a homey and inviting feeling. Food was fantastic from the tapas to the entrees, nothing was overly filling or seasoned.",4.0
"What's not to love?  Nice decor, staff, food.  The bar is great, if a little cramped.  But if you want a great Mediterranean dinner without any pretension come here.  Affogato dessert is not to be missed.",5.0
"Seriously, over 70 reviews and a plus four rating?  Yelp is normally on the money, or not way off it, so we went here last night for some tapas expecting good things. Unfortunately Olea is the prepackaged deep freeze from a can version of Greek food. I am at a loss to understand how this can be recommended by anyone unless the owners of this restaurant have 70 very good friends or all the prior reviewers have been infected by a case of restaurant localitis. The hummus and pitta was store bought (and not from Dean and Deluca but Target's discount range).  The pittas were just terrible.  The sauteed mushrooms had had the sauteed swapped for being poached in cheap oil.  The lamb meatballs were so far away from being descended from actual meat I could have used them to patch holes in a bike tire and the salted cod croquette was  an off tasting puff of rubbish. A truly bad meal. Really really bad.  If I had to pick something positive about the place it would be the cosy atmosphere and that the glass of sangria didn't make me ill.  The only problem was that as we sat at the bar with our faces contorting in the horror with the shock of quite how bad the food was we had to try to try and hide this from the waiter.",1.0
"So I've finally tried their breakfast/brunch and I was not so impressed with the dishes a friend of mine and I ordered.  I'll try their Turkish breakfast soon, but I will continue to stick to their tuna sandwich because to me it's what they do best.",3.0
"Really nice place for tapas with friends.  Shared an assortment of their vegetarian tapas - faves were the spicy feta dip, patatas bravas, and the red pepper dip.  Also shared the whole wheat pasta which was my favorite dish of the night.  Great red sangria.  I like how they make things a little healthier too with whole wheat pitas and pastas.  It's fun to pretend to be healthy even when you're stuffing your face with thousands of calories!",4.0

"Oh, Olea. I would come here just to bask in the sun-filled space alone. Seriously--lighting matters, and this place has got it down. However,  this place has much more to it's credit than well-placed windows (which really are very well-placed! and plentiful). The mosaic tiles, clay stucco, and wooden ceiling of course do a lil somethin somethin to the overall ambience.But of course, the Foooood: I came here for brunch a couple Sundays ago. It was packed, so my roomie and I sat at the bar. No problem with that. We had more opportunity to chat with the gracious bartender (yes, even on a Sunday morning) and get all of her reccomendations. Speaking of which, everything on the menu is a reccomendation. Very fresh, big portions, and truly unique. DO try the chocolate croissants. They (comes with 2) come piping hot and the gooey chocolate is melty magnificence. Also, they're a different take on the typical--the outer dough is more phyllo (in keeping with the Greek theme of the place), which to me was an UPGRADE. Mmmm just thinking about em....And just wait till you hear what I had for my entree--Savory Parmesan French Toast Topped with poached eggs, peas, scallions, pea shoots and avgolemono sauce-- don't even know what that last delectable sauce even is, but the whole thing was a DIVINE and transformative take on french toast. In addition, the omellettes are spot-on. Good luck with picking just one from all the delicious choices though--Greek? French? Spanish? Italian? Turkish? ALL PLEASE. Which is why I'm heading back ASAP....",5.0

"And so I realize that Olea might not be the restaurant to impress my parents during brunch. I tried the yelp-reviews-recommended Turkish Breakfast and My Green Eggs and Lamb, and it did not impress her one bit. The organic eggs were supposed to include red onions, tomatoes and CILANTRO (an ingredient which my mother loves) and we did not really taste the cilantro at all. The green eggs and lamb was a bit disappointing. The lamb being less than a finger shy in length and 0.73th of an inch in diameter (and only 3 pieces none the less). The rest of the plate was eggs, potatoes, and greens. The Turkish breakfast included a fattoush salad (which is bread in a way), eggplant salad (cold eggplant with tomatoes and onions), pita, the scrabbled eggs again and herbed yogurt.The goat cheese croquette was pretty impressive. it was rich and had a thin layer of croquette-ness (or breading?). But I would have preferred a thicker breading since it was very dense (and tasty. the spices with it are appealing). The lamb sandwich was similar to a meatball sub. Though the flavor of lamb, the spices and the tomatoes go well, i was a bit disappointed with it. I expected it to taste better. But my mom liked the bread. But I guess what I'm trying to say is that, go here for DINNER instead of BRUNCH. The food was good but I figure this place is better if you want to hang or meet than impress for brunch. The service and the setting was beautiful (even if there was only one waiter at 1pm on a thurs. not a lot of people out).",3.0

This alone in NYC is enough to make me come back to a place (unless the food is absolute garbage, which it ain't).I've never been terribly impressed with their tapas, but I've never been at all disappointed. Their hummus seems a little too lemony, but only a touch. The fried chick peas seemed really bland, but hey, they're fried chick peas. You can't really expect much there (though some salt would've been nice). I've had patatas bravas at a few tapas places, but theirs is certainly the best. They also have fried artichoke, which is crazy good.  Last time I went, they had gotten rid of the Serrano ham, which is a shame.",4.0

The coffee is excellent, the Turkish breakfast is divine and you should try the warm almond tart if you're in the mood for dessert.

I've been here a few times now for brunch and have enjoyed every visit. Their hummus and beet dip with pita is addictive! I also love their home fries. I don't eat eggs but my friend loves the Turkish Breakfast and another brunch date said their french toast was the best he's ever had. And I usually don't like bloody mary's but this one was particularly delicious! The vibe is really cozy and casual while still being suitable for a nice outing. It's slightly out of the way from the main drag but that's kind of what I like about it. The one pitfall is the wait--since it is the only place to go in the area it can take a while to get seated. They don't take reservations for brunch and I've had to wait 30 minutes or more each time. Still doesn't stop me from going though. I want to come back and try their dinner menu soon!,4.0

I like the Mediterranean feel to the place with the white walls, dark furniture and tiled bar area. For a second I'm wisked away.

I'm not a big fan of the tapas, but it's good to mix it up with your entrees when you're sharing food or a pitcher of Sangria.I've been here for brunch and love their green eggs and lamb dish scrambled with fresh cilantro.

So if you go, be prepared to wait or get there early or at the later part of brunch hours.For lunch I usually get the Olea Chicken Club Sandwich. The roasted tomato spread and yogurt make it a yummy treat. For dinner it's Branzino all the way. Love that it's a whole bone-in fish. It's just damn good I say!

"I took my mother and aunt to Olea last night. They are visiting from Florida and since it rained all day yesterday, I decided not to take them into the city and try a restaurant in Brooklyn. My roommate suggested Olea and the menu looked really good on-line so we decided to give it a try. The restaurant was cozy and very chill. The menu selection had a nice variety of tapas, appetizers, entrees, desserts, and cocktails. There was something for everyone. For an appetizer we had the hummus and warm grilled pita. The server also brought out a nice bread basket. I had the vegetable pasta, which had organic whole wheat pasta, squash, zucchini, sweet potatoes, oyster mushrooms, and feta cheese. My aunt had pan seared Organic Farmed Salmon with goat cheese ravioli and my mother had the 14oz grilled sirloin, salsa verde, Potato gratin, sauteed swiss chard. We were all very satisfied with our entrees. This was a great place to bring guests for a nice meal. I will definitely go back again soon!",5.0

The waitstaff has always been kind, attentive, and prompt.  On one occasion they forgot to put in a side order, so after I reminded them later they apologized and comped it.  They're always very professional.    Finally, the atmosphere and decor is beautiful and comfortable.  It really makes me feel both at home and like I'm in a little tavern in Greece.  On top of everything, the menu is really reasonably priced.   I highly recommend it!",5.0
I love every single item on their menu but I dream about those almond stuffed bacon wrapped dates. Unabashedly so.,5.0
"a reliably delicious restaurant, time after time. great space, great service - great overall. my only complaint as a five-year veteran:  PLEASE quit raising prices. the tapas prices have doubled since 2010.",4.0
I like taking my friends and family here.  Great atmosphere and convenient to where I stay when I visit Brooklyn once or twice a year.  The food is like 4 stars...,5.0
"As Vince Vaughn once put it: ""[this place] is so f*ing money and doesn't even know it!""Love this place because:1. It's tucked away in a quaint residential location2. Ambience is comfortable and charming3. Food is very tasty4. Wait staff is friendly and attentive5. Quite affordable.... 1 to 2 dollar signs only!Cons:NadaWill definitely come back for brunch, lunch, etc.",5.0
"I took my mother and aunt to Olea last night. They are visiting from Florida and since it rained all day yesterday, I decided not to take them into the city and try a restaurant in Brooklyn. My roommate suggested Olea and the menu looked really good on-line so we decided to give it a try. The restaurant was cozy and very chill. The menu selection had a nice variety of tapas, appetizers, entrees, desserts, and cocktails. There was something for everyone. For an appetizer we had the hummus and warm grilled pita. The server also brought out a nice bread basket. I had the vegetable pasta, which had organic whole wheat pasta, squash, zucchini, sweet potatoes, oyster mushrooms, and feta cheese. My aunt had pan seared Organic Farmed Salmon with goat cheese ravioli and my mother had the 14oz grilled sirloin, salsa verde, Potato gratin, sauteed swiss chard. We were all very satisfied with our entrees. This was a great place to bring guests for a nice meal. I will definitely go back again soon!",5.0
"Went last night with my rents.  They think Brooklyn is the red-headed stepchild (like me!) of Manhattan - so it was a pleasure to take them somewhere with such flavors and high quality.We had delicious tapas, salads and wine. The waitress had a little bit of a tude.. but the food made up for anything that could have happened. Oh, and news flash:  If taking a date, there is a cute, little private table in the back - reserve it.  It comes equipped with sexy lighting, privacy and romance.",5.0
"Really solid Greek food, delicious sangria, pretty darn good service.I'll be honest, normally I would give a place like this 4 stars, except, except... Aqualis. Aqualis is a new Greek restaurant in the same neighborhood, and I would pick Aqualis nine times out of ten over Olea.",3.0
"Fun place for brunch, even though it tries a little too much to create ""mediterranean"" brunch dishes. The result is certainly unique, and by no means bad, but a little heavy handed. The green eggs and lamb sausage were very good and everyone else seemed to love their dishes as well (turkish breakfast being another favorite). The pita though was overly hot and felt heated rather than freshly made and they ran out of bloody marys but that might be understandable given that we were towards the end of brunch and it may actually mean that it was freshly prepared and not premixed.If I lived near the Ft Greene area, I would surely come to Olea several other times, as it has ""neighborhood treasure"" written all over it, but it doesn't otherwise cross the barrier of places worth taking a trip for on their merit alone.",3.0
"It was a beautiful sunny afternoon and the outdoor seating was perfect.  We started with the falafel-crusted artichoke hearts with Turkish eggplant salad and tahini-yogurt sauce.  It was good, but the eggplant was great!  I'd rather just have that instead.  The eggplant flavor was robust, sweet and tender all at the same time.  Yum!The lamb kefteddes meatballs with feta cheese and tomato sauce were even better.  They were so juicy and melt-in-your-mouth delicious, three was just not enough!  I could have a whole plate full of them.As for the chicken club sandwich, my dining companion liked it, but thought the chicken was a tad under seasoned. The bread looked really fluffy and tantalizing though.  I think it was served with a side of patatas bravas and salad.I can't wait to try this place for dinner.",4.0
"Used to love this spot, hasn't really gotten worse, just hasn't really changed at all.  $1.50 oysters were the only specials when my girlfriend and I ate there last Sunday and that's not even much of a deal.  There are plenty of places in over priced Manhattan that offer $1 oysters.  No other specials at all though, the same old menu with no new dishes offered by the chef?  Just not feeling it anymore, might do brunch again but dinner, don't think I'll be back any time soon.",2.0
"We ended up here on a fluke after walking for miles on a Saturday late-morning.  I was exhausted and starving, and there was a line.  Thankfully the wait wasn't what it seemed and we were in about 15 minutes later.   To have stumbled upon such a delicious brunch is just another reason why I love Brooklyn.  The food, the service, the atmosphere...all charming!  I had the parmesan toast with pea shoots and eggs w/ a hollandaise-type sauce.  My husband had the chorizo sandwich.  Both were amazing...and the home fries/patatas bravase were wonderful.  I'd recommend this spot to anyone.",5.0

"The happy hour special is fleeting (only until 6:30, and I think only through Thursday), but it's a good one!  Certain wine, beer, and sangria (yay!) are half-price, oysters are $1.50, and there is a tapas menu with items for $3 or $4.  We sampled the spicy vegetable dip, the anchovies with almonds & arugula, and some sort of kebab.  It was all very good.  I only wish that the special went longer so I could have had some more of the mango sangria!",4.0
"Moved to the area a few months ago and I'm slowly making my way through the neighborhood restaurants. I'd heard a lot of great things about Olea and wasn't disappointed.Brought the visiting fam for dinner and it really was a fantastic meal. We got lots of tapas, my favorites were the classic patatas bravas, which are topped with a delicious aioli, a simple grilled zucchini and eggplant that was cooked to perfection, and the goat cheese croquettes! God, I love goat cheese. Two different types of shrimp were great, but on the small side, and the salads were top notch! One came with roasted tomatoes, chickpeas and falafel croutons, which I think is totally genius. The salmon was good, but I don't eat a lot of fish, so I'm not the best judge.Sangria was meh, but the food was outstanding, I'd be back in an instant.",5.0

"The first time I ventured out of Manhattan was to meet with a close friend in Brooklyn. She had heard about this place from a coworker, so we decided to go there. We had one of the best dinners ever; and we both realized that we are truly ""foodies"".First off, I've only been for dinner, and I only get the tapas. We heard that the dinner entrees are okay, but we had such a wonderful tapas experience that we decided that's what we'll always get. And every time we've been back, it's been amazing. So get the tapas. Who cares about brunch anyway. Small plates. Tapas.We love the atmosphere... it's cozy, perfectly sized, with dim lighting, bench pillows and plants. Frequently there is live Spanish guitar. It always seems to be busy, but we usually get a table quickly. I guess it's worth a reservation if you have 4 or more guests.So, the tapas are Spanish/Greek. I'll order some of our favorites for you:. pitcher of sangria. goat cheese croquets (even if you don't like goat cheese). gambas al ajillo (be sure to drag your bread thru the butter). bacon wrapped dates. Turkish cigars. patatas bravas. haloumi. pita bread with tzatziki. yogurt for dessert (Greek yogurt + toasted walnuts + sour cherries + candied orange rind = amazing)Definitely one of our favorite places; I'm always happy to leave Manhattan to come to this place.",5.0
"Don't go here. Everyone raves about the brunch here so I had to check it out.  I already have been here once for dinner and  the brunch was equally unmemorable.

The place is very charming with friendly service and a great mix of diners - from families to couples to large groups.

Idunno) and the food was absolutely delicious.When I was there last time, there was a guy rocking the accordion, and if I'd had another bottle of wine (by myself) and squinted in the way that make everything look weird, I could have lied and said that I was in Europe or some place where they have guys rocking the accordion on the streets.  My friends found the accordion guy to be too loud - I mean, he really started killing it as the night progressed, aided by his glasses of vino, I'm sure - but I really enjoyed it.  Grab a few friends and hop on the C or the G, Lafayette and Fulton, respectively (unless the A is stopping there, too).  If you already live in the area, ""Well, don't we live in a great neighborhood?  After dinner, let's walk over to The 'Post (Habana yelp.com/biz/habana-outp…) for $2.50 beers.  When The 'Post shuts down, we'll hit up Moe's yelp.com/biz/moes-brookl….  Tomorrow: Pequena!"" yelp.com/biz/pequena-bro…",5.0
"Very cozy, very inviting neighborhood spot. The tapas are overall quite nice -- the pan-fried halloumi cheese and swiss chard cigars are personal favorites -- but the real draw is the sangria.

"Hands down my favorite restaurant - it never disappoints! Great food, great atmosphere. Some nights I binge on tapas.

"Very cozy, good food, good wine.  Adorable bathroom, not that this is a deciding factor with a restaurant (but always a plus).The perfect place for a pre-BAM dinner.The only thing, and this is extremely persnickety, is that I don't like the way their tapas menu is laid out.  Specifically, it's a little fold out of the plastic menu thingamabob.  Which causes people to miss it, and ask me after blankly staring at the full menu for a while: ""I thought this was a tapas place??""  You should have the tapas on a full sized sheet, at least.  Maybe even separate from the dinner menu.  That's my professional opinion.",4.0
"I came here with some friends after the Fort Greene Fest (Go Brooklyn!). We arrived just on time on a Saturday night since according to my friends, Olea is very popular, i.e., long wait times. We waited less than 5 minutes and I was instantly impressed with the space. It's a very open dining area with a bar. The place is very charming with friendly service and a great mix of diners - from families to couples to large groups. We stuck  mainly to the tapas menu and everything was delicious - the standout for me was the artichoke - yum yum yum!Just another reason for me to fall in love with Fort Greene - delicious food without pretension and great service.",4.0
"Came here for brunch on NYC Marathon Sunday.  After a 30 minute wait, we were able to snag a table outside that let us watch as the last stragglers propelled themselves at a pace better measured by HPM than MPH.My Green Eggs & Lamb dish ($12) was an inspired take on Dr. Seuss and Meditteranean cuisine:  Cilanto-scrambled eggs, Merquez Lamb sausage, lightly toasted pita triangles, and delicious breakfast potatoes.  Much better than the Seuss-inspired Cat in the Hash that I had once in Chinatown.Would definitely come back here to give dinner a try....",4.0

"Comfortable and funky atmosphere. Very tasty food. We had tapas and salads and the salads were pretty standard, but well portioned. But oh the tapas...

"There's a plenty of great restaurants in Fort Greene/Clinton Hill area and this is one of them.I found the wait staff to be friendly and helpful - even honest (my friend asked for Riesling to go with our appetizers and she raised an eyebrow - ""But really, Riesling isn't necessarily a dessert wine!"" Idunno) and the food was absolutely delicious.When I was there last time, there was a guy rocking the accordion, and if I'd had another bottle of wine (by myself) and squinted in the way that make everything look weird, I could have lied and said that I was in Europe or some place where they have guys rocking the accordion on the streets.  My friends found the accordion guy to be too loud - I mean, he really started killing it as the night progressed, aided by his glasses of vino, I'm sure - but I really enjoyed it.  Grab a few friends and hop on the C or the G, Lafayette and Fulton, respectively (unless the A is stopping there, too).  If you already live in the area, ""Well, don't we live in a great neighborhood?  After dinner, let's walk over to The 'Post (Habana yelp.com/biz/habana-outp…) for $2.50 beers.  When The 'Post shuts down, we'll hit up Moe's yelp.com/biz/moes-brookl….  Tomorrow: Pequena!"" yelp.com/biz/pequena-bro…",5.0

"Wether i am at the bar or sitting at a table the service rocks. Love the decor, staff, music, food.. I became quite a regular there over the past year.

"Had passed this place many times and saw that it was always packed.  I couldn't find the name because whatever signage is there (or not there) is not easy to see when passing by in a car.  I finally went for dinner one night and we got right in, no wait.  The decor was pretty and the place was bigger on the inside than I thought it would be, but still very comfortable and homey.  The food was DELICIOUS. We started with the grilled whole wheat pita and dips.  The Romesco dip was my favorite but they were all mouth-watering.  For my entree, I had the Grilled Organic Pork Chop with mashed potatoes, white cabbage salad with black olive and lemon, and tzatziki sauce. The pork chop was huge and juicy, unlike any I ever had before. I cleared my plate, and would have licked that sucker if no was around.  The wine was great, and even the olive oil on the table for dipping the soft bread was amazing. My cousin had the Crevettes French-Style Shrimp white wine, lemon, butter, lemon thyme and she was loving every bite. I can't wait to go back and try something else.",5.0
"Olea is one of my favorite restaurants in the city, hands-down. While nothing makes you clutch your chest out of ecstasy, per se, 95% of what I've had there has been excellent, for both brunch and dinner (never been for lunch). In fact, I owe Olea part of my culinary LIFE because it was the first place I had boquerones-- white anchovies marinated in oil, vinegar and garlic-- and they're now one of my favorite foods of all time. I agree that a totally satisfying meal of tapas is a great way to go here for dinner-- and on Fridays, they have Spanish guitar at just the right volume (and paella, too). I love how at night it feels lively but not scene-y. The waitstaff can be a little hurried, but nothing to make a stink about. And brunch? Head straight for Turkish breakfast. A finer breakfasty lunch was never made.",5.0

"I have to preface this with the acknowledgement that I am not a big fan of Mediterranean food.

We usually show up around 12 or 1 and end up waiting for 30 minutes or so, but it's worth it. Here's what we get:1) I always drink their orange juice. I'm not sure if it's fresh squeezed but it certainly tastes like it. Lovely. My gf sometimes gets their mimosas which are good. 2) We split an order of their chocolate croissants ($3.50). These are so delicious: warm, flaky and gooey in the center. I always feel a bit guilty eating them but they're wonderful3) I'm someone who finds something they like and sticks with it. I almost always get their Savory Parmesan French Toast Topped with poached eggs, peas, scallions, pea shoots and avgolemono sauce ($12). Its a great meal, sauce is rich but not too heavy and mixes well with the egg yolk from the poached egg. The peas are tender and plentiful, your plate has enough green on it to make you feel somewhat healthy. The presentation of this is really great, I feel like I'm eating at a fancy place without having to pay high prices. I've also had their polenta and eggs which is great, as are their homefries.

"I've been hearing great things about Olea for months (a year?) and finally got the opportunity to try it with a giddy group of friends after a nerdy screening of Helvetica. Some in the group wanted sushi but I needed to try Olea.The atmosphere was extremely welcoming and probably romantic if you were so inclined. Our sommelier/friend Nick steered us to a fantastic Sicilian red and we ordered a few tapas plates. The bacon wrapped dates were probably the highlight but we also attempted the sorreno ham croquettes and another ""cigar"" type dish wrapped in phillo dough. meh.I was having a hard time deciding on a dish and after several consultations with the friendly and polite waitress settled on two appetizer sizes of the crab ravioli ($9) and the wild mushroom risotto ($8). The risotto was not really rave worthy. Though filling and a generous portion as an appetizer it was really not as flavorful (or buttery?) as I was hoping. The crab ravioli, however, was right on. I was immediately kicking myself for not getting the entree size and altogether skipping the risotto. Next time! The sauce was a nice delicate tomato and parmeggano reggiano combo and the crab just twinkled in the tang in your mouth. And for dessert: Porto!",4.0

"Ended up coming here twice for Brooklyn Restaurant Week.  It was that good, and have come back a couple of times after that.  Lucky I live so close by.  In a beautiful building, the space is not out of place at all in this neighborhood of brownstones.  Dark wood, terra cotta floors and walls.  It's a nice comforable atmosphere.  A pretty good wine list with plenty from this Mediterranean themed spot.  Delicious salads, that are really niceley paired if you get the pan roasted halloumi cheese or the falafel crusted artichoke hearts.  I also love any fish that they do with chermoula, a nice blend of spices and olive oil. The dessert menu features five dishes that do a good - if not wonderful - job of complementing the meal. For dessert, get the panna cotta. It's  a light perfect end to the meal.",5.0

"I took my friend to Olea's  for a farewell lunch, when she moved to New Mexico. Naturally I wanted it to be a special meal. We were not disappointed. We indulged in assorted tapas, tzatziki with warm pitas, and endive and arugula salad. Everything was very fresh and rich with flavor. The almond stuffed bacon wrapped dates were out of this world. For dessert we shared an apricot infused bread pudding with apricot sorbet. It was outrageously good. We loved the warm ambience and exotic homey decor. Loved the flamenco music and spanish guitar playing in the background. I returned with my boyfriend for a romantic dinner, and once again, was very pleased with the meal, the service, and the ambience. One of my favorite places to eat in Brooklyn.",5.0
"We got a primal seat near the front of the restaurant where EC could people watch and I could relax on the cushion filled bench.  Is this what a restaurant would look like in Greece?  Olea is a quaint and pleasant place for brunch.I chose the French omelette with Brie Cheese Smoked Salmon, Leeks and Fresh Herbs, which comes with Homefries and some grain bread. The Homefries were the best I've had in ages!  The bread was hard as a rock, but the fresh Raspberry jam could've been its own course.  All washed down with a large Cappuccino.  Even better than IHOP, get the Fresh Squeezed OJ.  EC inhaled his Turkish Breakfast - Eggs scrambled with Fresh Cilantro, Tomato and Onion Fattoush Salad, Eggplant Salad, Herbed Yogurt and Grilled Pita Bread.  Each formed a little pile and it looked like a painter's palette.  I should've gotten his dish, a lovely tasty selection!  We got two Freshly baked Chocolate Croissants to go, but kicked myself later because I didn't eat it fast enough and they got all soggy.",4.0
"This was a very nice surprise! Tried to come here one night, hah! St V night i think it was and to no avail. They wouldn't even deliver that night, and it was all booked. So we went  some other time. After passing by several times the place has been consistently busy.  Going in it has the feel of an old time tavern with its rustic looks and simple bar next to the entrance. Some dividers hang from chains on the ceiling.  Tables and chairs are pretty basic but warm and welcoming. The night my friend and i went there was music playing.  Some guy on an accordion. We happen to sit right next to him. Surprisingly enough it was quite pleasant and he was playing popular tunes.  The menu borrows influences from Italy, Greece, Spain and i think turkey as well.  Its quite adventurous to some extent but simple at the same time. The salad was very fresh with nicely flavored dressing. Pears and goat cheese on it gave it a nice contrast of sweet and sour. Even the plate of olives was quite a treat as they were spiced. Piquillo peppers with spices and tuna inside. Yumm yumm.  Even the chorizo was really nice.

"I thought it was really great. The atmosphere was intimate & relaxing...dare I say ""cozy""?  The Tzatziki was amazing, as was the salmon (which I ordered) and the grilled steak ( I mooched off my husband's plate).  The flavors were not over powering...just plain delicious.  It's a ""slow paced"" meal....so don't be rushed.  We walked down the street and saw a movie at BAM afterwards....just the perfect night.",4.0
"I've been hearing great things about Olea for months (a year?) and finally got the opportunity to try it with a giddy group of friends after a nerdy screening of Helvetica. Some in the group wanted sushi but I needed to try Olea.The atmosphere was extremely welcoming and probably romantic if you were so inclined. Our sommelier/friend Nick steered us to a fantastic Sicilian red and we ordered a few tapas plates. The bacon wrapped dates were probably the highlight but we also attempted the sorreno ham croquettes and another ""cigar"" type dish wrapped in phillo dough. meh.I was having a hard time deciding on a dish and after several consultations with the friendly and polite waitress settled on two appetizer sizes of the crab ravioli ($9) and the wild mushroom risotto ($8). The risotto was not really rave worthy. Though filling and a generous portion as an appetizer it was really not as flavorful (or buttery?) as I was hoping. The crab ravioli, however, was right on. I was immediately kicking myself for not getting the entree size and altogether skipping the risotto. Next time! The sauce was a nice delicate tomato and parmeggano reggiano combo and the crab just twinkled in the tang in your mouth. And for dessert: Porto!",4.0
The atmosphere is awesome. And who can beat their oyster happy hour?Oh and drink enough beer or wine to use the bathroom. You'll want to tear the walls off your own afterward.,5.0
"Ended up coming here twice for Brooklyn Restaurant Week.  It was that good, and have come back a couple of times after that.  Lucky I live so close by.  In a beautiful building, the space is not out of place at all in this neighborhood of brownstones.  Dark wood, terra cotta floors and walls.  It's a nice comforable atmosphere.  A pretty good wine list with plenty from this Mediterranean themed spot.  Delicious salads, that are really niceley paired if you get the pan roasted halloumi cheese or the falafel crusted artichoke hearts.  I also love any fish that they do with chermoula, a nice blend of spices and olive oil. The dessert menu features five dishes that do a good - if not wonderful - job of complementing the meal. For dessert, get the panna cotta. It's  a light perfect end to the meal.",5.0
"I love the ambience of this restaurant. It's really warm, classy and relaxed.  My hangar steak with polenta and brussel sprouts was really good.  The bacon-wrapped dates were awesome, but that dish is impossible to screw up.  My favorite thing was actually a salad with lentils, chickpeas, and little felafel-croutons.  I'm always impressed when a dish like that, which is straight-up nutrition, really knocks my socks off.  Yum.  One star off because the chicken was hella salty.",4.0
"I took my friend to Olea's  for a farewell lunch, when she moved to New Mexico. Naturally I wanted it to be a special meal. We were not disappointed. We indulged in assorted tapas, tzatziki with warm pitas, and endive and arugula salad. Everything was very fresh and rich with flavor. The almond stuffed bacon wrapped dates were out of this world. For dessert we shared an apricot infused bread pudding with apricot sorbet. It was outrageously good. We loved the warm ambience and exotic homey decor. Loved the flamenco music and spanish guitar playing in the background. I returned with my boyfriend for a romantic dinner, and once again, was very pleased with the meal, the service, and the ambience. One of my favorite places to eat in Brooklyn.",5.0
"We got a primal seat near the front of the restaurant where EC could people watch and I could relax on the cushion filled bench.  Is this what a restaurant would look like in Greece?  Olea is a quaint and pleasant place for brunch.I chose the French omelette with Brie Cheese Smoked Salmon, Leeks and Fresh Herbs, which comes with Homefries and some grain bread. The Homefries were the best I've had in ages!  The bread was hard as a rock, but the fresh Raspberry jam could've been its own course.  All washed down with a large Cappuccino.  Even better than IHOP, get the Fresh Squeezed OJ.  EC inhaled his Turkish Breakfast - Eggs scrambled with Fresh Cilantro, Tomato and Onion Fattoush Salad, Eggplant Salad, Herbed Yogurt and Grilled Pita Bread.  Each formed a little pile and it looked like a painter's palette.  I should've gotten his dish, a lovely tasty selection!  We got two Freshly baked Chocolate Croissants to go, but kicked myself later because I didn't eat it fast enough and they got all soggy.",4.0
"This was a very nice surprise! Tried to come here one night, hah! St V night i think it was and to no avail. They wouldn't even deliver that night, and it was all booked. So we went  some other time. After passing by several times the place has been consistently busy.  Going in it has the feel of an old time tavern with its rustic looks and simple bar next to the entrance. Some dividers hang from chains on the ceiling.  Tables and chairs are pretty basic but warm and welcoming. The night my friend and i went there was music playing.  Some guy on an accordion. We happen to sit right next to him. Surprisingly enough it was quite pleasant and he was playing popular tunes.  The menu borrows influences from Italy, Greece, Spain and i think turkey as well.  Its quite adventurous to some extent but simple at the same time. The salad was very fresh with nicely flavored dressing. Pears and goat cheese on it gave it a nice contrast of sweet and sour. Even the plate of olives was quite a treat as they were spiced. Piquillo peppers with spices and tuna inside. Yumm yumm.  Even the chorizo was really nice.

"We had tried going here last time but it was too crowded so we came back on a Saturday when it wasn't too crowded yet instead of going to our usual and delicious place. I had four people in my party and we all ordered different things. There were two tables that ordered at the same time as us, one right before and one right afterwards. The table next to us that had 2 people ordered received their food pretty quickly and we were like all right! us next! and then the table on our other side with 4 people that ordered awhile after us got their food! We still patiently waited. Eventually the people all around us were done with their food, and had the checks and paid for them. During this entire 30-45 min period, we did not see our waitress come to us once in this tiny restaurant. We tried fruitlessly to flag her down but she was quite determined to chat up other customers, stand by the bar and chat with the people working there or disappear into the back. We finally got our food and all the people who had come in at the same time or after us had now paid their check, eaten their chocolate, and left. We got the spanish omelette, the parmasean toast, lamb sandwich and egg polenta. Everything was good, but not amazing or even pretty good. The best thing I had was probably my fresh squeezed orange juice. The polenta was so bland I had to add salt and pepper with gusto. We saw our waitress three times in an hour and a half. Once to take our order, twice to be there when our food was finally brought out, and the third time to take our check.

"i've been here thrice now, once for brunch, once for an afternoon beverage and once for dinner. the ambiance can't be beat; lovely natural light in the daytime illuminates exposed brick and stucco walls, lush potted trees, dark wood-paneled ceilings, terra cotta floors and mediterranean stylings of tile and hanging pottery. it really just makes you want to take a nap on their cushioned benches as a light breeze plays around your face.at night, candlelight sets a more romantic tone, and on friday nights, a man in the center of the restaurant plucks away on his spanish guitar. it was on such a friday night that i had dinner with a friend here, consisting of various tapas and an entree each, washed down with a carafe of raspberry sangria. the tapas were, overall, excellent. herbed goat cheese croquettes, cod croquetas and a chicken liver special whetted our appetites, which were then honed with a roasted half-chicken for me and a lentil bean salad for my friend. these were sadly not as amazing as the tapas; my chicken was drier than expected and though i thought my friend's salad was delicious, she felt it wasn't quite up to its usual snuff. the raspberry sangria, however, more than made up for any lack of satisfaction in the fare, as we were both left buzzed and blissful by the end of the evening. i might mention also that adrien grenier, canoodling in the corner with his lady companion added to the charming ambiance that evening.the brunch at this place is simply delicious. i had the green eggs and lamb, which consisted of lamb sausage, cilantro scrambled eggs, home fries and a side salad of leafy baby greens. the bloody mary is one of the best i've had; i was told the secret is in the A1 sauce used in lieu of worsterchire sauce. the coffee is strong and flavorful and, if you're sitting outdoors, it's great people-watching.prices are reasonable, and certainly sweetened by the chocolates (bearing the name of the restaurant on the wrapper) provided atop the check.",4.0

"i've been here thrice now, once for brunch, once for an afternoon beverage and once for dinner. the ambiance can't be beat; lovely natural light in the daytime illuminates exposed brick and stucco walls, lush potted trees, dark wood-paneled ceilings, terra cotta floors and mediterranean stylings of tile and hanging pottery. it really just makes you want to take a nap on their cushioned benches as a light breeze plays around your face.at night, candlelight sets a more romantic tone, and on friday nights, a man in the center of the restaurant plucks away on his spanish guitar. it was on such a friday night that i had dinner with a friend here, consisting of various tapas and an entree each, washed down with a carafe of raspberry sangria. the tapas were, overall, excellent. herbed goat cheese croquettes, cod croquetas and a chicken liver special whetted our appetites, which were then honed with a roasted half-chicken for me and a lentil bean salad for my friend. these were sadly not as amazing as the tapas; my chicken was drier than expected and though i thought my friend's salad was delicious, she felt it wasn't quite up to its usual snuff. the raspberry sangria, however, more than made up for any lack of satisfaction in the fare, as we were both left buzzed and blissful by the end of the evening. i might mention also that adrien grenier, canoodling in the corner with his lady companion added to the charming ambiance that evening.the brunch at this place is simply delicious. i had the green eggs and lamb, which consisted of lamb sausage, cilantro scrambled eggs, home fries and a side salad of leafy baby greens. the bloody mary is one of the best i've had; i was told the secret is in the A1 sauce used in lieu of worsterchire sauce. the coffee is strong and flavorful and, if you're sitting outdoors, it's great people-watching.prices are reasonable, and certainly sweetened by the chocolates (bearing the name of the restaurant on the wrapper) provided atop the check.",4.0
"YUM. seriously, everything we ate produced yummy food sounds. I went in a large-ish group (they were quite accomodating) so I got to have a small taste of many kinds of deliciousness. server was helpful to the max and even suggested that risotto-orderers choose the app portion since apparently the entree was out-of-control massive. crap, I basically waited too long to write this review, so details are out the window, but trust me, I have fond memories. except for the one where my ""friend"" later accused me of eating too much off his plate. hmph. use it or lose it, dude.",5.0
after reading so many great reviews i was surprised by experience at Olea. i liked the ambiance and the vibe... but the wait staff totally forgot about my table even though we sat right next to the order stand and kitchen... it took forever for our orders to be taken and forever to get our food. when we got it my friends steak was undercooked despite his instructions otherwise and my toast was burnt beyond recognition. we won't be going back.,2.0
This is a great restaurant for just drinks or with tapas or dinner. It's absolutely lovely with a fantastic menu!,4.0
"I went to Olea as a recommendation from a friend and I fell in love with the place the minute I stepped in.  The restaurant boasts a cozy atmosphere that includes a great waitstaff, dark wood furniture, palm trees, and the best food.  I'm a fan of flavorfull food and every bite was delicious.  We decided to have tapas that night and ordered 6 dishes, which were all mouth-watering.  A surprisingly good tapas plate was the bacon wrapped date stuffed with olives.  Its a great place for a casual yet romantic dinner and its reasonably priced.  The best tapas place Ive been to.",5.0
Great place to grab brunch.  I am a big fan of both the chocolate filled croissants as well as the green eggs and lamb.  Incorporate either of these and you will be a satisfied patron.,4.0
"Dear dear OLEA, love of my heart, or at least, love of my frequently-dissatisfied-with-savory-options-at-brunch heart-- it is you, dear OLEA, that has fused  some of my great loves (poached eggs, asparagus, FRENCH TOAST) into something truly wonderful: savory. french. toast. eggs. benedict. of. sorts. on. top. of. delicious bread that has gone through the french toast treatment but instead of being sweet is fraught with gorgeous parmesan cheese. ENCRUSTED WITH PARMESAN CHEESE, but -- not greasy. and then there is the splendid, perfectly poached egg sitting on top. And then, oh yes, and then there is grilled asparagus and baby pea shoots and something better than a hollandaise sauce AND you can have a pomegranate mimosa..... so good I've coordinated whole Manhattan-to-Fort-Greene treks to visit it, with comrades in tow. Everyone has always been pleased. And they give you a wee chocolate at the end. Aw.",4.0
