"Very good coffee that wasn't too hot to drink! I also got the breakfast burrito with avocado, delicious. Beware it is on the spicier side, which I really enjoyed. Definitely come here for hangover cures!",5.0
"Came back in a few times recently and had the bacon, egg, and cheese on a baguette. My first visit must have been a fluke because it has been excellent ever since. Nice customer service and delicious breakfast sandwiches. Now this is in my regular weekend rotation!",5.0
Breakfast burrito!!!! Its cheap and so delicious! I tried brie sandwich and that was delicious too! Coffee here is not bad. Iced chai tea latte was really good actually.,5.0
"Friendly and pretty quick service, quality healthy food, variety of options for breakfast, snack, and lunch items. Also a convenient place for working - free wifi, usually enough tables for 1 or 2. Stop by!",5.0
"Love it here, my favorite coffee or lunch spot in the area. I really like their breakfast burrito, veggie wrap, pancakes, chai latte and iced latte. Good prices, fast & friendly service and almost always a place to sit. And there are a few seats outside! Their food holds up with delivery also!",5.0
"TL;DR: slow, but good enough.All in all it's a fine cafe, and, even for all its fault, I won't stop coming. It's within walking distance and on the way to the train.The one thing does well: juice. Great juice. And so affordable. The breakfast sandwiches are also, generally, fine.Where this place lacks: efficiency. It is not fast food. A lot of times they forget about orders altogether. Expect to wait about 10 minutes for something as simple as an egg and cheese.",3.0
This is a go to everyday café! I love the staff from the girls and guys in the front to the cooking staff that always makes my food so delicious. They are always friendly and outgoing there. The set up it cozy and small but its perfect place to go to get some work done on your laptop (free wifi) or for a quick bite to eat and coffee date with you friends.,5.0
"I love the food here, I stop for breakfast sandwiches and smoothies often. Good service, decent coffee. -1 star because there isn't a lot of seating, and it's usually filled.",4.0
This is my usual go to breakfast spot...but today they had a different staff and it was a hot mess. I ordered a smoothie and they gave me a wrong order and basically told me to take it or leave it. They refused to make the smoothie again.,3.0
"Great variety in the or menu, exceptional breakfast line-up whether your looking to relax there in the morning or for a quick take-out on the way to work. Down the block from my apt and always convenient when I'm in a hurry. Coffee is alright, would love to see a darker roast, but the food, especially breakfast menu and lunch sandwiches is what makes this one unique.",5.0
"Awesome spot right around the corner from my apt. Super quick, and awesome staff that is always smiling. Food is super cheap, high quality, and always fresh.",5.0
The coffee is average at best.   I'm not sure why they earned five stars . They serve everything in paper cups.,1.0
This is a great space to work (if you don't have to really concentrate as it is constantly busy). The wifi worked really well and most of the tables were always filled so it wasn't awkward to sit there for a long time... Because we all know being in a cafe with just yourself and the gum chewing barista really is awkward. I didn't get any food but the $5 breakfast burrito is massive and looks amazing. I will definitely be back to try it! My only complaint is I couldn't find any plugins to charge my computer and had to leave earlier than expected.,5.0
"This nice coffee shop is located in Bushwick, offering some nice pastries and sandwiches. I recommend the breakfast burrito.  Fresh squeezed juices are satisfying as well.  The place is relatively small,  so it's better to have it to go",4.0
I had there the best wrap ever. It was fresh and just delicious. The staff is also always very friendly. Nice and cozy neighborhood cafe.,5.0
"Great spot with tons of food and beverage options. I often get a sandwich, green juice and coffee and always happy with speedy service and quality food. Everything is always so fresh.",5.0
Went to NY to visit a friend and she took me to this cute little spot by her place.I had the salmon lox on an everything bagel and it was only $4!  Great deal and I left full.  They make great vanilla lattes as well.,5.0
If you are looking for a place to pull up and iPad and get some heart warming food may I suggest Your Way Cafe.  Tucked into a nook of Wilson it is just the right place to relax and sit.  The laid back charm of the cafe had a magic way of whipping time by.  The music is indie and the drinks are hot when they should be and chilled when called for.  If you are looking to spend some quality time with yourself or a friend this is the spot for you.,4.0
Absolutely incredible. Ingredients are so fresh and delicious and the service is delightfully friendly. This is my new go-to breakfast/brunch/lunch,5.0
"My home away from home!  I live a few blocks away and love this place.  The food, the coffee, the prices, all of it is fantastic.  The only issue would be seating, which there isn't an abundance of by any means.  They have a nice selection of drinks in the back, for those on a coffee/tea break.  Their breakfast sandwiches are generous and tasty.  A bacon, egg, cheese on a croissant for $3.50 makes me want to cry for the sake of its beauty.Their lunch is no less on point.  Try getting a chicken club (or something along those lines) on a baguette.  So filling and so tasty.Other Information:The Americano is $2.50.They have free Wi-Fi.They have a restroom.They take cards and there is no minimum.People also trip about their pancakes.  I haven't had the pleasure yet, but if that's your jam, I'd say go for it.",5.0

"This is a great little spot that I love having in the neighborhood. Unpretentious, pretty good coffee, reasonable prices, simple but good food (love the buffalo chicken sandwich), amazing fresh doughnuts from Dough a few days a week, and wifi. It has gotten more popular in the past couple of years, but I usually don't have trouble getting a seat if I want to.",5.0
"So I was going to go for a 3-star, but I'd like to hope today was an off today and next time I won't feel like my presence was an inconvenience to the almighty barista. Had to repeat my order a couple of times then she forgot to add a pastry... Didn't tell me how much I owed and no receipt which was kind of weird. When I told her she forgot my pastry, she said she didn't charge me... even though we definitely had that ""So I want that purple donut...""/""You want the purple donut?"" exchange. Oh well. It was my first time and I live on the block so I'm pretty sure I'll be giving this place a second chance.Other than that, I was delightfully surprised by the interior... Cozy, cute, and quite spacious. Lots of options to choose from and have them customize. BIG YAY for the doughnuts from Dough and my strawberry banana smoothie was pretty good and DOUBLE YAY for taking credit cards -- because I'm THAT person who never carries cash on her =/Now that I think about... Ok, I'll definitely be back.",4.0
"I drove by with my partner desperate for food and wanted to avoid this place the first three times I saw it earlier in the month. My first thoughts were 'oh no, not another business with reclaimed wood in Bushwick' but we went in and everything is such a great price! They have great food for a decent price not only in comparison to new york city prices but to other areas as well. They have a lox bagel for around $5, what?! That's amazing and they don't skimp on you. The juice is also a great price. Check it out!",5.0
Favourite place in the neighbourhood! They have a great menu and I especially love their baconeggandcheese and their choice of juices and smoothies are fab too! It's all fairly priced and a very welcoming place to sit and have breakfast with pals. I'd highly recommend it!,5.0
"Great spot with AMAZING prices. $3.50 for fresh, customizable juices (I got an apple-carrot-ginger), and really good bagels here too. I'll definitely be making this place my go-to for fresh and fast breakfasts.",5.0
"not really a reviewer, but will make an exception for this place.+ espresso machine+ freshly made juices & smoothies+ accepts credit cards, no minimums+ opens earlier in the morning (unlike bushwick coffee house, which is never open in the morning)+ good sandwiches+ lots of sunlight+ plenty of seating + wifi avail if people still do that thingbasically perfect.",5.0
"hey!i've been here multiple times because it's near my apartment and it has wi-fi. the people working here are super nice. i just heard a customer say that they were feeling sick, and the barista brought her some tea for nothing. the barista offers to reheat my coffee if she knows i've been sitting there working for a while. on top of that, it's 20 degrees right now, so the barista put a little heater right next to my seat (since im the only customer right now).  the food is actually great -- the bagels are full sized and fresh for cheap. there is a large table, and small barstools for a people to sit, with wi-fi if they want to work. the bathroom is clean, and seems to have been recently renovated and is kept nice. come give these good people some business! they deserve it!",5.0
