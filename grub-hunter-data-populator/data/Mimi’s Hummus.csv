"With the Cortelyou strip blowing up like a Brooklyn strip should, Mimi's is the perfect addition to the variety of eateries offered there. I will always love Mediterranean food so it definitely gets a star just for being my favourite cuisine. A bunch of us came here to try the breakfast menu. Firstly let's talk about the decor and vibe. Mimi's is definitely a tiny spot with very limited seats but if you come at the right hours, you'll be seated right away. The kitchen is right behind the counter with open view so you can see everything that goes on there. For me, that's a good thing. I like watching the chefs work. We were seated right away and water and menus were brought within seconds. Once we ordered we did not have to wait long for our dishes to come. They are extremely vegetarian friendly which is a big plus these days. My absolute favourite dish was the shakshuka. Texture, taste/spice was perfect. The tomato sauce was chunky with lots of garlic and onions added for flavor. Yum. The pancakes are different than the usual pancakes you'd get for brunch. Lots of honey and very very sweet. Not the biggest fan. Coffee was perfectly strong and free refills. They did have these chocolate rumballs that we ordered which were so damn amazing. The perfect end to a great breakfast. The owners and waitstaff were an absolute pleasure to deal with and we will definitely be back for more.",4.0
"I was incredibly underwhelmed by the food here. So it's a hummus place right? The ""highlight best hummus you've ever tasted"" according to my waitress was in fact exactly the opposite. Maybe I just came in on an off night but I'll just be frank and say it. I hated this place. The hummus had a good consistency but lacked any tahini paste in it or flavor of any kind. I told my wife that I think Sabra makes better hummus and I hate sabra. We basically left it untouched. Then I wanted a Coke but they don't serve normal drinks because they are a hipster heaven. So I got a cranberry soda handmade for three bucks. It was uneventful. For dinner we got the Iraqi sandwich and the kebab sandwich. Both left a ton to be desired. The pita bread itself tasted like it was homemade but not in a good way. In a failed attempt way. Dull and lacking of flavor. Don't be afraid of salt! Both sandwiches felt dry and unseasoned. The beet salad was good but not worth the price. Sorry for the harsh review but I expected a lot more from this place.",1.0
"This place is so good! I was so surprised to see this cute restaurant in Flatbush and I had to try it. I am a vegan, so I am always on the hunt for restaurants in Brooklyn that offer vegan options. I loved the decor of the place and the staff were really friendly. This space is very small, so it could get crowded really quickly. I had mushroom hummus (which was amazing), roasted cauliflower, braised beets and Mimi's sandwich. Everything was really good! I'm not a huge fan of beers but I really enjoyed their very salad. I would definitely recommend this place for brunch and I will also come back to Mimi's hummus.",4.0
"Green Shakshuka $12 - too much salty feta cheese, it was OK. Shakshuka Meguez $14 - eggs were a tad over-cooked. I was expecting a runny egg but didn't get that. Other than that, everything was perfect. I used pita and cleaned the skillet. Traditional Hummus $8 - large bowl, tasted like any other hummus out in the market. Nothing special and bland. Roasted Cauliflower $7 - first off I'm a fan of cauliflower. But I couldn't make this plate favorable. It's a cold dish with a tart lemon after taste. My fiancé enjoyed it.Location is super tiny. Great for catching up with a friend... And I mean 1 friend.",3.0
"Very meh to mehhhh. Overpriced, small portions, no flavor, okay service, cute but inefficient atmosphere. In detail:Grape leaves special: half the size of a normal grape leave, and a weird flavorless yogurt green sauce. $7 for 5, meh. Pita side: whole wheat, dry, burnt, and tasted like something from a dollar store that went bad. Cold, not even slightly warm, which would have made a shitty tasting pita SLIGHTLY better. Shawarma bowl: underseasoned meat, bland veggies with nothing done to them, okay rice, no flavor bland yogurt and no hot sauce or zing at all. Super boring. Service: unattentive, nice enough. Atmosphere: cute, but way too small the table barely fit anything on it. I saw the table next to us having to use a stool for their small plates meal. Really?Not impressed at all.",2.0
"The food is tasty and obviously of good quality.  The eponymous hummuses are sufficiently smooth and creamy and the kebab, though minuscule is moist and tasty.  Chicken Schwarma barely registered however, and frankly it and everything else is wildly overpriced, especially considering said tiny portions.  The place has a stranglehold on the local population due to the extremely limited neighborhood restaurant scene however, and I will no doubt be forced to eat here again many more times, on the occasions when work takes me to these parts.",3.0
"Simple, clean, tasty. You can easily miss it since the place is squeezed between 2 other stores, but it worth to look for. I can't say that they have the best food I had, but I can say that it is unique, and tastes that I haven't taste for a long time. I had hummus plate with mushroom. Good.Shakshuka with meat. Exec lent. Lemonade. Good. Pita bread. OKThe service was very good and vine is of a healthy place. Visit!",4.0
mushroom hummus is amazing and I really love the kebab bowl. such a nice little spot for dinner in my neighborhood. I also love their beer store next door so they usually have great options to drink as well. not the most stellar or attentive service but the food is delish and always filling.,4.0
"A little hole in the wall, if not for yelp I'd never spot this place. ( not that I'm missing out) Place is very small and kinda artsy I'm pretty surprised how this neighborhood had evolved lots of cool new eateries.Nice Waitress greets me as I walk in and I asked her for a to go menu, she points in the direction of a table with regular menus and paper menus.She mentions to grab the folded paper menu, I picked an item ready to order she tells me oh at this moment we aren't ordering from the to go menu use the regular menu, oh well I find the same item and order that.I Give her my credit card to pay a total of $10.89 she's like since its you're first time here we will take it but normally we have a $15 minimum, hmmm ya thinkI ordered the meat hummus / ground beef with hummus and pine nuts.Nothing to exciting about the hummus which lacks flavor as if it was bought in bulk from a commercial co.The ground beef was chewy and bland definitely won't rave about that.Would I come back! Well not excited about this place so probably not.",2.0
"Our waitress was rude and condescending to us the entire night. She corrected several of us on the pronunciation of menu items. My wife ordered an orange juice. She was informed that it's only made in the afternoon, and decides to stick with water. Three minutes later, without asking for it, the waitress puts and orange juice in front of her and says, ""Here, I found some juice leftover.""  There are several other examples that I won't go into. Suffice it to say, one of my worst restaurant experiences in a long time.",1.0

"Great food, fresh ingredients.  Some of the best hummus I've ever had - creamy, flavorful... I've tried both the Traditional and the Fava Bean, and they are both excellent.  The Shakshuka is a solid dish with potential, but I think it could be a bit spicier - once you run out of bits of egg, it kind of turns into a thick yet boring tomato stew.  The small plates are mostly excellent - the cauliflower in particular is unique - its a cold cauliflower salad, and the lemon and tahini work perfectly.  The carrots are great as well, the beets a bit boring (again, a bit tame with the spices).Great drink offerings (beers from the Craft Beer shop next store, small but nice wine selection) and incredibly friendly, indulgent service - we arrived 30 minutes before closing at most, and they were as patient and lovely as if we were the first customers of the night, even trying to talk us into dessert when we were far and away the last 2 people there - just a lovely place.  It is a bit cramped (at least until you are the last 2 people in the restaurant) and they have these ridiculously annoying ceramic water cups that seem handmade - the edges are uneven and made me feel like I was going to cut my lip on them - but now I feel like I'm just being petty... come here and enjoy a great (and reasonably priced) meal.  Just drink booze instead of water.",4.0
"Absolutely 100% god awful food. It is so bad I don't need to put it in my 'Worst Mediterranean' list, just in general.I was sitting at a bar across the street and wanted something quick and easy to eat.

A few small pieces of indistinguishable rubbery meat was strewn about a sad sea of rice and an entire quarter of an onion. Entirely too much mint dominated what little flavor there was. Not to mention this was a SMALL portion for $15 - borderline offensively considering they microwave their damn rice and somehow this took 30 minutes to make.

"For the past several years, I thought Hummus Place was the best in NYC for casual Israeli dishes, but I was proven wrong a few months back when I biked to Ditmas Park to have lunch at Mimi's hummus and have since made this a regular stop. It's a classier affair than Hummus Place, set in a small spot with cute tables and classic jazz playing in the background. The food is excellent -- I particularly am in love with the lamb kebab bowl served with mint rice ... LOVE.

Annoying waitress. We felt rushed about ordering. We haven't put the food yet in our mouths then she came along asking how the food was. What the??? We felt rushed to finish our food. Their food isn't that great. It's a slab of tahini sauce and some meat and some eggplant here and there. Their tables and plates are tiny in contrast to their huge silverware. I kept on dropping my fork. No disposable napkins either. We got stuck on using the cloth napkin for everything. Cheapskate! Save your money and avoid this place!,1.0
"Mimi's has been one of my favorite places in the neighborhood for a long time! But last night we were disappointed to discover that the menu had changed, and with it came the removal of several of our favorite Moroccan dishes. As a vegetarian, it became a lot harder to order. The new dishes included vegetarian options but all of them were highly acidic and used eggs or cheese as the protein. That worked for me, but not my date. When we asked if we could still order something from the old menu, we were told that we could not.  Also, that they'd been removed to make the menu more ""sophisticated,"" which was a hard thing to hear as a person of Moroccan descent, because three of the absent dishes are beloved to my family, such as Burekas and M'jedra. Also a confusing descriptor, because while the new pita pockets were delicious, they were served without a plate, wrapped in wax paper, which reminded me of food truck presentation. Not more ""sophisticated"" in my book, but why make that kind of comparison in the first place? Mimi's, did you want to create a hierarchy within your great tasting food?So I'd still recommend Mimi's for delicious food and great atmosphere, but if you're a vegetarian/vegan/have dietary restrictions, look at the menu before you decide to return. Or maybe they'll reconsider something that other restaurants do, which is keeping the new menu but allowing folks that have been coming so long that they know the old menu to order the great dishes that are no longer listed.",3.0
"For the past several years, I thought Hummus Place was the best in NYC for casual Israeli dishes, but I was proven wrong a few months back when I biked to Ditmas Park to have lunch at Mimi's hummus and have since made this a regular stop. It's a classier affair than Hummus Place, set in a small spot with cute tables and classic jazz playing in the background. The food is excellent -- I particularly am in love with the lamb kebab bowl served with mint rice ... LOVE.

"This place is so darling, as is their staff and their Mediterranean twinged Middle Eastern cuisine. This is why it hurt my heart to learn a few days ago, that they were held up at gunpoint.

My friend and I were the sole people in there, after coming in an hour to closing time. I felt peckish; my friend ravenous. Both of us were satisfied with our choices. Loved the carrot and Bulgarian feta salad - salty, lemony and full of coriander seeds making it have a semi-pickled flavor. My friend's cauliflower salad and choice of hummus with black beans seemed to satisfy him fairly well. What was truly amazing was the wine he ordered. A wine so ""oak-y"" and earthy, it tasted like an old church in France. Name: Chateau Maris (Carignan, 2012). Find a way to acquire a bottle. It might change your life!My only meh moment was the Turkish coffee I ordered. It wasn't very robust; more like the watery ""Elite"" brand my ex's Israeli mom used to pass off to me as ""the same as Greek coffee."" Um, no. I'm a spoiled, snob with that stuff.

Not a lot of places on Corteyou serve dessert (which causes me much heartache), but this is the sort of the place where you should just order all the options and split it.

"Wanted this place to be my Ditmas Park go to comfy neighborhood spot but alas. Experience was uneven.Opted for the dinner tasting menu.

Yet despite dipping pita like it was a ladle had to keep reordering, at a dollar per, it's just annoying. Shouldn't be hard to send out corresponding amounts. Dessert was an odd 1 mini-choco/coconut doughnut. Tasty but again 1 bite morsel.Considering as well the sparsity and density of the interior, stiff bistro chairs the open kitchen 20 feet away, it's not really an ambiance to wanna relax in.

I just don't. SO BLAND. Maybe i'm spoiled because im used to eating seasoned  ETHNIC food. This is a Mediterranean restaurant, right? ~Hummus spread : tasted like nothing. so bland. The sabra hummus from the supermarket has a better taste. ~ Pan fried eggplant : BLAND~ Beef: BLAND ~ The pine nuts were overkill. ~ KUDOS for the  raw red onions, outstanding LMAO. ---- The Beef sandwich was dripping with oil, had absolutely NO flavor. The only thing i could taste was the red onion. It was like eating something but you don't even know what it is because you can't identify any one flavor because IT HAD NO FLAVOR. CAULIFLOWER SALAD: very tasty. I would order this again. LAVENDER LEMONADE: it was alright. Mimi, you hurt me. You really did. Not only was your food overpriced, but it didn't showcase any flavors AT ALL. I've visited Morocco and their cheapest, low grade sandwiches taste a million times better than what I had from MiMi's -- because it ACTUALLY TASTED LIKE SOMETHING.If you want decent Mediterranean food  - there are many places on Coney Island Avenue that serve delicious, FLAVORFUL, authentic dishes. I might return. Only to try the Shakshuka tho ... bcuz i like eggs.",2.0
"Lovely experience here at this homey spot. 7 tables and it's a right squeeze. So, come early or late so you don't have to wait.Started with the chickpea hummus and cauliflower salad- both terrific and just about full- especially after the pita. Entrees- lamb stuffed peppers and shakshuka- both very tasty- but we were so full that we just shoveled the food in our mouth. Dessert- milk pudding with grapefruit and pistachios- spectacularThis chef definitely has a nice touch. Good service and cozy ambience. Will def be back for sure!",5.0
"Finally made it here and so glad I did. Food was fantastic. We got cauliflower salad, mushroom hummus and a meat entree. Everything tasted perfect and the quality was fresh.

"Mimi's Hummus is a really great and reasonably priced place to get delicious Middle Eastern food.  There aren't too many places in the area that serve hummus this good.  It's a very small and quaint space, so I don't recommend going with a large group.  Service was great and our server was very friendly and attentive.  We started out with the tahini hummus which was amazing!  I could have eaten that alone.  Next, I had the chicken couscous which came with chicken patties, couscous, zucchini, and asparagus.  The vegetables were so fresh and perfectly seasoned.  I didn't get to try anything on the dessert menu, but everything sounded amazing.  I'll definitely be back!",4.0
"Everything was pretty good that was served to my group, but the most important item on the menu, the hummus...was nothing more than lackluster.

Its funny that a place on cortelyou is trying to portion food for yuppies, seeing the demographics. Our server was nice on the exterior, but extremely phoney. One could spot out that she wasn't a happy person who was only looking to push expensive food on our group. It left an awful aura on the meal experience.Would I go back...No.",2.0

"Enroute to visiting Ditmas Park, a friend suggested Mimi's for brunch. Actually - it was more like he commanded us to go to Mimi's for brunch. Never ones to turn down a strong recommendation, Mimi's was our first stop.We started with Stumptown coffee and told our waitress that we were to share all the plates between the two of us - which was a plentiful amount for a hungry couple. Cauliflower salad was ordered and brought out first along with Israeli salad and spicy pickled veggies for our green Shasuka. The ""green"" coming from Swiss chard. Unlike the more traditional Shasuka, aside from the chard, this one was also topped with goat cheese. The yogurt based cauliflower salad was cold and refreshing alongside the Shasuka, which was hearty.When at Mimi's hummus, it would be in bad taste to leave without sampling the hummus (duh). We opted for the mushroom style which was topped with a mushroom stew. The hummus at Mimi's is a traditional base (chick peas) and is just as creamy as promised. The topping is what sets each option apart. I can see why Refinery 29 said this was a top notch spot for a NYC brunch. This was waaaaaay better than the trendy Mediteranian brunch I had in soho recently. Worth the trip down Courtelyou.",5.0

Lamb was gamey which to me is bad-send-it-back-to-kitchen sign but I guess some of us r nicer. Salmon was bland! Not sure if chef was off that day or it was last min change since food took forever to come out for everyone!

This is a very nice intimate little spot in courtelyou road. The food tastes really good . The hostess lets you know the approximate/close to exact time u will seat down. It has few tables and can accommodate maybe around 20 people or less. I come here for brunch and dinner. It does not disappoint. They will give a wine bottle size glass in each table. The food wait is maybe 15-20 minutes. I am a fan of thier Semolina pancake with honey and butter on the side. YummyThis is a place to grab your Sunday brunch and just want some peace..,5.0
"I have heard whisperings about Mimi's Hummus for a long time, but never had the occasion to visit. With that, a friend and I were all set to have brunch at Castello Plan a couple of a weekends back, but I requested a last minute change of venue so we could try Mimi's instead. I am generally obsessed with Middle Eastern cuisine and was ready to do the insufferable ""Is it, or is it not better than what I ate in Israel?"" spiel, but I was silenced by how simply divine the food at Mimi's is. We popped in around 11:30 on a Sunday morning and were lucky enough to snag a table right away in their small, smartly decorated space. With only six or seven tables, I think this place fills up fast, and I could see why. Mimi's is open for brunch with a fairly unique (at least for brunch-time) menu including egg dishes, pancakes, hummus (obvi) and more. My friend and I shared an order of masabache hummus which was served with huge, warm pitas. The hummus is bracing, fresh with lemon juice, and olive oil and whole chickpeas on top. I ordered the green shakshuka for my main which was amazing. A hearty stew of swiss chard, topped with sunny side-up eggs and salty Bulgarian cheese (similar to feta). It was served with more pitas (which I kept eating), and the portion was huge for the price. Service was friendly and fast, with lots of refills on my coffee, which I love. Mimi's is a happening spot on Cortelyou Road and a terrific addition to this strip of stores and restaurants. Have you ever thought of branching out, Mimi? We could use more restaurants like this in NY!",5.0

"Mimi's Hummus is a small, quaint little spot on Cortelyou. Great food. Mint lemonade was refreshing and a definitely enjoyed the meat hummus. I'd rate higher however if it wasn't for the waitress I encountered when my friends and I dined here.She asked if the service wasn't good because I didn't leave a huge tip. She mentioned that good service deserves a 20% tip. I thought this was a terrible faux pas on her part.Exceptional service gets 20%. Good service gets a 15% tip and as I explained, I just put an arbitrary number that I thought was reasonable. Working out the math, I left a tip of 13.24%. You know what a 15% tip would've been on that bill? $1 more than what I tipped. $1? Really?

"I came in for lunch the other day and had the mushroom hummus which was excellent, very tasty and the pitas were great.    My server at Mimi's was really excellent, yes it is a casual place but this young lady not only was friendly but also had a great knowledge of the menu and preparation of the dishes which is rare for a server on Cortelyou.  The other eateries on Cortelyou could really take a lesson from mimi's in the service category.  I've found that the service at the other places while usually friendly is really sub par -- no knowledge of the food they are serving or the drinks they're making (in the bartenders cases).So kudos to Mimi's for the delicious hummus and the excellent service.",4.0
"Ok I feel bad about this but truth must prevail! Mushroom hummus is best I have ever had but that's about it. Hence 2 stars.... I had chicken and cous cous and I swear they did something to it... It was Not edible! Cous cous was overcooked mush! And I wasn't only one since everyone else @my table said same thing. My party also tried lamb pie thingy and salmon. Lamb was gamey which to me is bad-send-it-back-to-kitchen sign but I guess some of us r nicer. Salmon was bland! Not sure if chef was off that day or it was last min change since food took forever to come out for everyone! I think waitress realized we were not happy and gave us free poutin balls, which tasted like straight rum. I'd go back for that hummus, but that's about it!",2.0
This is a very nice intimate little spot in courtelyou road. The food tastes really good . The hostess lets you know the approximate/close to exact time u will seat down. It has few tables and can accommodate maybe around 20 people or less. I come here for brunch and dinner. It does not disappoint. They will give a wine bottle size glass in each table. The food wait is maybe 15-20 minutes. I am a fan of thier Semolina pancake with honey and butter on the side. YummyThis is a place to grab your Sunday brunch and just want some peace..,5.0
"I have heard whisperings about Mimi's Hummus for a long time, but never had the occasion to visit. With that, a friend and I were all set to have brunch at Castello Plan a couple of a weekends back, but I requested a last minute change of venue so we could try Mimi's instead. I am generally obsessed with Middle Eastern cuisine and was ready to do the insufferable ""Is it, or is it not better than what I ate in Israel?"" spiel, but I was silenced by how simply divine the food at Mimi's is. We popped in around 11:30 on a Sunday morning and were lucky enough to snag a table right away in their small, smartly decorated space. With only six or seven tables, I think this place fills up fast, and I could see why. Mimi's is open for brunch with a fairly unique (at least for brunch-time) menu including egg dishes, pancakes, hummus (obvi) and more. My friend and I shared an order of masabache hummus which was served with huge, warm pitas. The hummus is bracing, fresh with lemon juice, and olive oil and whole chickpeas on top. I ordered the green shakshuka for my main which was amazing. A hearty stew of swiss chard, topped with sunny side-up eggs and salty Bulgarian cheese (similar to feta). It was served with more pitas (which I kept eating), and the portion was huge for the price. Service was friendly and fast, with lots of refills on my coffee, which I love. Mimi's is a happening spot on Cortelyou Road and a terrific addition to this strip of stores and restaurants. Have you ever thought of branching out, Mimi? We could use more restaurants like this in NY!",5.0

"Mimi's Hummus is a small, quaint little spot on Cortelyou. Great food. Mint lemonade was refreshing and a definitely enjoyed the meat hummus. I'd rate higher however if it wasn't for the waitress I encountered when my friends and I dined here.She asked if the service wasn't good because I didn't leave a huge tip. She mentioned that good service deserves a 20% tip. I thought this was a terrible faux pas on her part.Exceptional service gets 20%. Good service gets a 15% tip and as I explained, I just put an arbitrary number that I thought was reasonable. Working out the math, I left a tip of 13.24%. You know what a 15% tip would've been on that bill? $1 more than what I tipped. $1? Really?

We also go the cauliflower salad which was a treat. I dont know who thought of putting it in tahini but he/she is a genius. I cant wait to go back and try everything on the menu. The place is pretty small (around 5 tables) but its cute and looks really clean. A+!,5.0
"Loved it.  Highly recommended. Great hummus, perfect labane (perfect!), really tasty salads (tried the cauliflower salad and the beet)...  but rather than going into details about these items, I want to focus your attention on one thing: chocolate balls.  You would be doing yourself a disservice if you came here and did not finish off your meal with a serving of these tasty balls.  Order them.  Eat them.  Eat these tender, chewy balls.  They will not disappoint you.  Maybe, in your life, at some point, you have been disappointed by balls, either yours or someone else's?  If so, you should make it a point to try these balls, for they will restore your faith.  In balls.  Chocolate balls.  Eat them.  Order some to takeaway and share them with your family.  Give your kids some balls to eat.  Your parents.  Your neighbors.(One note, for Mimi: Mimi, please change your menu to use grass-fed or free-range meat.  Pretty please?)",4.0

"Mimi you have outdone yourself!Usually I am in a position to walk over to lovely Ditmas Park and patronize this establishment, but I was ""working"" from home today and let's just say I was a bit behind schedule so I decided to order in lunch.Well. Mimi would not usually send the bike delivery person all the way to my place but made an exception for me today. Mimi, you're a doll.The Moroccan-style tomato stew with sunny side eggs (comes with Israeli salad, which is freshly chopped tomato, cucumber, onoins, mint and olive oil) was really good on a cold day. The portion was huge so I saved my mushroom hummus for dinner. Mimi, I can just picture you lovingly hunched over a pot mixing in chickpeas with super tasty olive oil and mushroomy goodness to bring me this hummus, and I love you for it. Overall, really simple and fresh food.Mimi would have it no other way. And neither would I.",4.0
"If I lived closer, I'd imagine getting fatter and fatter with each hummus stuffed pita and...no let's not go there. The food was fresh and well seasoned. The israeli salad was refreshing and cooling, while the shakshuka eggs was a wonderfully light tomato stew. The hummus was good which really means I've never had poor hummus. We also ordered a panna cotta like dessert with fresh fruit. I really love this place!",4.0

"I'm not sure I can say much about Mimi's that hasn't been said. It's a top notch restaurant. Probably one of the best in Brooklyn, if not the entire city. I've had most things on the menu, and have not once been disappointed. I tend to be drawn to the filo with beet salad. The shakshouka is very good as well. There are maybe 4 desserts on the menu, but only one usually makes it to our table: punchim. You will not regret any of it.",5.0
"After a long, weary pilgrimage through Brooklyn (our first time), we finally arrived here, which turned out to be an oasis in a not-so-appealing neighborhood.  To our delight the place was small but well- appointed with gorgeous wood paneling, an open kitchen, warm lighting, and solid wood tables adorned with a few sprigs of fresh flowers.  We were seated promptly at the window at a tiny candlelit romantic table by none other than Mimi herself.As others have noted, the menu is small, but everything we ate was sublime.  The complimentary olives and pickles to start were a fresh departure from the typical bread routine.  We of course got a hummus dish, with ground beef and pine nuts, which was smooth and creamy; next was seniya (ground lamb pie) which was new to me but I enjoyed the savoriness of the meat with the nuttiness of the tahini. The pita which came with the hummus was to die for: fluffy and piping hot, so hot you had to juggle it in your hands to cool it. We got another order of pita which cost a little bit extra (1.50) but that's nothing compared to how good it is.  To finish we had kuncham (sp?) for dessert which were yummy and dense.Service was quick and attentive, with complimentary refills on mint sage tea. Love the old-school bell-ringing between the waitress and the kitchen -- every time it rang my head poked up like a gopher out of a hole to see if the next dish was ours.  Prices were very reasonable for the quality; we're thinking of coming back to see what weekend brunch is like.  Very happy to have discovered this little gem.  Thanks Yelp!",5.0
"It's a cute little place with a very ""homey"" feeling to it.The food is well made and is good in Israeli standards.

"I love Mimi's. It is probably the restaurant I frequent most often. I usually get one of the small plates (I've tried and loved them all, but I think the cauliflower and eggplant are my favorites), a hummus (mushroom and tahini are my favorites) and a mint & sage tea (yum). The food is always fresh and delicious. I often fantasize about the steamy puffiness of the pita bread. You leave feeling full, but in a healthy, satisfied way. The atmosphere is light and cozy, whether in summer or winter. It is a perfect after-the-farmer's-market meal. Until recently, I would have easily given Mimi's 5 stars (or more if possible!). However, I've noticed a change in the quality of service in the past 3 or 4 times I've been there. This has coincided with a change in the waiting staff. The past two times I ate at Mimi's, the waitress forgot the pickles/olives that go with the hummus. When I asked, she seemed annoyed. People forget things - I don't mind that.

They also had shakshuka on the menu and, even though I didn't order it (there were SO many good choices), I like knowing it was there. If I ever go back, I definitely plan to get it.

Plus the restaurant itself was soooo cozy. The whole wheat pita was hot and delicious and the fava bean hummus was off-the-charts, but I'm also a sucker for most hummuses with lemon in them. We also had the labne too, delicious, and the eggplant caviar, which wasn't amazing for me but might be for a hardcore eggplant lover. They also had shakshuka on the menu and, even though I didn't order it (there were SO many good choices), I like knowing it was there. If I ever go back, I definitely plan to get it. The servings are kind of tapas-ish, so order a lot for the table. Plus, it isn't very expensive, which is a major plus. I'd definitely go back.",4.0
"The best way to sum the place up is: the atmosphere and the quality of the food were great, but don't come here if you're super hungry or looking for a deal.  The place is tiny, but that paired with the calm decor make it very warm and inviting.  The service was friendly and equally calm.  The walls are made out of warm wood or painted light blue, there was some quiet music playing in the background.  You can look into the small, clean kitchen, which I think is always interesting (but you can't see it when you sit down).  Kudos to whomever did the design.  (I was perfectly relaxed until this couple showed up with their kids...)  The quality of the food was exceptional.  The Greek yogurt was the best I've had, and the lentil dish was super good.  The delicious wheat pita really pulled it all together.  The only negative is that $8 for what couldn't have been more than 3/4 cup of lentils is a little much.  With two dishes and a beer at $21 (mostly vegetables and bread, mind you), I would expect to at least get full.  However, if they either increased their portions a little or decreased the price, the quality is so good I would give them five stars.",4.0

"If you are on Cortelyou looking for dinner, calibrate your Google Maps for Mimi's Hummus immediately. A delicious experience from start to finish. My friend and I devoured platefuls of perfectly seasoned hummus with warm, pillowy pita bread. The service was incredibly attentive and friendly. And as far as restaurant music goes? The best. Mellow and low-key. The perfect way to relax after a busy weekday, while sheltered from the frantic streets. The restaurant soundtrack was a conversation point, where every other song would prompt us to stop in our tracks and say, ""Wait - I love this song."" Good job Mimi. Good job.",5.0
"Consistently outstanding. Compares favorably to the hummus joints of Jerusalem, and I've never had a single meal I haven't loved. Everything on the menu is great, but my standbys are the stuffed grape leaves -- unlike any other -- and the fava bean hummus.

"When you have a food in your restaurant name, you better be sure to make that item very well. Mission accomplished, Mimi. I came here from brunch with my friend and obviously, I was going to try the hummus to see if they live up to their name. The verdict? Whoa! Their hummus was probably one of the best I've ever had. Especially with the warm pita bread. Oh dear. I was melting in my chair after every bite.Actually, all the food we were served at brunch was delicious. I just most vividly remember the hummus. The food is very garlicky so I would not recommend kissing someone after. Unless you both have garlic breath, then they'll just cancel each other out so no problem.The place is tiny. I think it had about 5 tables. Atmosphere is cozy. Friendly service. Overall, an amazing restaurant.",5.0
"O. M. G.

Man, I was hungry and tired, and I had trekked out from the East Village to eat in this part of Brooklyn so I wanted to EAT!Mimi's appeared as an oasis - I ordered the first thing the waitress described: the Iranian sandwich. It came with a delightful Israeli salad - read all the other reviews here about how good that salad is, and my sandwich with its amazing hummus was The Best.  I stayed for a Turkish coffee and three chocolate balls rolled in coconut - also AMAZING.

Lost sale. So the sandwich is ready, but there are no mushrooms inside. I politely ask the chef if he can just give me some mushrooms on the side. He frantically picks through the sandwich and says, ""Look, there ARE mushrooms in this, they're just all the way in the back."" Whoa, buddy, no need to be so hostile. I felt like I was getting scolded at by the devil. He then commenced to throw out the entire sandwich and said he'll make another one.

"Don't want to hate on this place, because it does have its charm.  However, I honestly have not rushed to go back after my first try and probably won't.  Yeah, the hummus is pretty good.  Everything was extremely fresh and with crisp flavors.  The people who work there seem nice.But I couldn't help but feel like I was paying sort-of a lot for small portions that I probably could have (cheaply!) made myself at home.  And the space is so tiny; in my opinion it's slightly *too* intimate.",3.0
"When I started a Chicago-Brooklyn LDR this was the first place we went on my first visit.  The salad was good, great soups, the pita went well with the hummus (pine nuts were spectacular (both with and without meat)).  The rice stuffing the grape leaves was a little undercooked BUT WHO CARES because a year later we're sitting on the bench outside enjoying a cool evening and waiting for our carryout order.  We grabbed some crackers from their shop next door and a bottle of wine from two doors down -- it fits movie night at home, it fits casual date night out, we are certainly fans.  Go enjoy it right now.",4.0
"Recently opened, next door to their restaurant and soon-to-come, highly anticipated wine bar.  It's small and tight when more than 4 people are there, but they make great use of their space, as they do at the Hummus shop.  Fairly priced, and surprisingly large selection given the tight fit.  Sampled some olive oil on their delicious bread and ended up grabbing up some manchego, chorizo and fig jelly.  Everything was delicious.  We will return!",4.0
"Adorable and delicious. The mushroom hummus was phenomenal, the pita fluffy and warm. Shakshuka, cauliflower appetizer, grape leaves, israeli salad, and lemon chicken meatballs (I swear I just had a bite, veggie gods) were all nothing less than delicious. Prices are reasonable, especially for the quality. I'll be back soon!",5.0
"Best pita and hummus, hands down.Okay, that's a summary. The details: friendly waitstaff, cute interior, delicious sauces & dressings, creamiest & freshest tasting hummus outside of Israel, fab spicy cilantro sauce, warm, fluffy and delicious whole wheat pita, happy tummies. Would go back here in a heartbeat. Aaand portions are large enough so that I have lunch tomorrow. A must-go for hummus lovers or Brooklynites.",4.0
"flavors and textures galore!  I had an Iraqi open-faced sandwich with egg, cilantro, eggplant, potato, hummus, on whole wheat pita (see pics).

"Meh. I *have* experienced better -- at Mimi's... about two years ago. It was a different time then. Booze was brought by yourself, prices were lower, food tasted better.

"After hearing fantastic reviews from my friend who lives in the neighborhood, I decided to give Mimi's a try today during lunch.  We started off with the fava bean hummus which was simply the most delicious hummus I've ever had.  The spread was still slightly warm which means it was just made.  The home made whole wheat pita was so tasty with the hummus spread.  I was seriously thinking of licking the bowl once we got to the bottom, but then there were people around me so didn't want to look like a barbarian!For the entree, I had the ground beef wrapped in filo with a slide of beet salad.  This dish was amazing.  The beef was very nicely seasoned and reminded me a bit of a pigeon pie at Moroccan restaurants, but less sweet.  The beet salad had a nice sweet yet slightly tart vinegary taste and complimented the beef filo wrap nicely.  I will definitely be going back to Mimi's and try everything on their menu!",4.0
"Absolutely LOVE this place!I like hummus all right, but the hummus here is to die for.  Limited menu, several different types of hummus and salads, all delicious and servings of pita that are beyond generous.  The real reason for my review is to recommend the SHAKSHUKA!  If you come here, please please please order the shakshuka (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh…).  The special of the day was shakshuka with mergeuz; I died and went to heaven.  Seriously one of the better meals I've had in the past few weeks.",5.0

"Definitely great staff, super friendly (maybe becasue the managers might have been sitting right there, but non the less)! I read reviews on Yelp and was exited to go. My first surprise was the size of the place, very small. There are about 8 small tables squeezed into one room,  but that does not at all subtract from cozyness of the place. Came there on a weekend- very very high traffic people looking for a table for 3 had to wait at least 20 min. The food is very filling, and the humus has a very specific-sweet taste, not like to once usually sold in supermarkets. In general great food, just for me after eating half the dish (meat humus) I became overwhelmed and stuffed, I took the rest home and happily eat it the next day.  The plate size is average, its just that I shared an appetizer and generally get full quickly.  Definitely worth visiting at least once.",4.0
"Finally made it over to Mimi's Hummus last night for a belated birthday dinner with my two friends. There was a wait for a table at 7:30 on a Friday, so the woman I thought was the hostess suggested we go two doors down and have a glass of wine. She'd come get us, she promised, when our table was ready. We walked over to what turned out to be the newly opened ""Castello Plan"" wine bar - no connection with Mimi's Hummus that we could tell, except they are new business neighbors. More about the wine bar in another review - it was lovely with friendly service - but  we were impressed that the restaurant sent us over there to wait - especially because they have a tapas menu, and Mimi's has beer and wine.Enjoying our wine, but before we got too cozy, the same lovely woman came over to tell us our table was ready. Mimi's is smallish but the high walls and ceilings without too much busy decor makes it feel NOT claustrophobic at all. The menu is short and straightforward, but our waitress left us with the ""specials cheat-sheet"" with 3 appetizer and 2 entree specials. I appreciated her reading the specials to us and letting us know the prices, as well. Homemade pickles and some delicious green olives are complimentary (the refill would have been $2)  and cold water is left in jugs on the table so you can refill your own glass after eating the pickles and olives. We shared the traditional hummus as an app. - fantastic! It's been way too long since I've had hummus that doesn't come from a tub in the supermarket, let alone the freshly made exquisite offering of some pureed and some whole chickpeas with, as has been written below, the perfect balance of flavors. The pita bread was amazing - thick and fluffy - I even liked the wheat, and I'm usually not a fan. Between the three of us, we ordered one shakshuka, one meatball special, and one brisket special. Everyone was happy with her selection. I was happy with the Brisket - don't tell my mom - even better than hers! The portions are just right (even though our American eyes saw them as on the small side when they arrived - trust me, they are just right!) Between the starter wine, the hummus, and our meals, we were stuffed to the gils without finishing our last bites - no room for dessert this time. The prices are very reasonable - the brisket special, served with couscous, was the most expensive offering, at $14. Apps and small plates ran about 6-9 and entrees 10 to 14, I believe. Beer and wine selections on back of menu (I only glanced at them) I think were about 6 to 10. I liked how there were choices for vegetarians and meat-eaters alike. And how you could get a couple of apps or small plates if you couldn't decide, or mix and match with an entree if you were feeling hungrier. On the way out, the hostess bid us farewell. ""Are you Mimi?"" I asked her. She smiled and shook my hand. ""Everything was SO delicious,"" I told her. ""Thank you,"" she smiled, ""that's very good to hear."" I believe she is the owner and chef, so that she appears to be the hostess seems right - she was truly hosting dinner for us, and was very gratified that we enjoyed ourselves. Will definitely go back with my husband, and this time I'll remember to get a take-out menu!",5.0

"I found Mimi's looking for meat hummus, and it has won me over! Awesome Israeli food, in a cute, contemporary, and comfy space. The nice tray of real Israeli olives and pickles they start with definitely buttered me up, but the tomato Moroccan soup that followed was not a letdown. Although it was a bit more stew-like than I expected, it was rich and thick with chickpeas and lentils. The hummus with meat is the real deal- nice brown pieces of beef, parsley and pine nuts in the center. The hummus is thick and creamy, and even better with the awesome green schug. Of course you can't have hummus without pita, and this place knows pita. Fluffy and full, and you'd be hard pressed to find better pita in the US! I'm not a Shakshuka fan normally, but husband ordered the special with sausage and I'll admit it was very tasty too. To top it all off, we ended on a sweet note with some yummy almond cookies brought over by the owner. I'll be back when I'm in town, and I can't wait to see the new market and wine bar they are opening next door!",5.0
"Why it took me this long to write a review for Mimi's....IDK...well actually-I have had Mimi's many many times via take out. My friends kept saying, you still haven't been to Mimis..(since I moved to Kensington) in March. So I finally got to go to Mimi's on a Friday night. Totally tiny cute little joint. And Mimi also so tiny and cute, was the hostess...At first glance when you look at the Menu, you think to your self-wait a minute..is this going to be enough? (I know so greedy right!). Anyway, now I see why you have to actually eat here, totally makes the experience worth it. Their specials were lamb meat pie, and wonderful appetizer with hummus, fava beans, yogurt. Everything was simply Fresh, including the whole wheat Pita! We literally cleaned out plates! Hayyy! no shame in our game!

"Hummus is delicious but the service sucks. When you are sitting behind the counter I logically think you are there to work and take my order to go (Mr. Beret guy) but no you look right through me and totally ignore me. I understand it's fun to sometimes stare straight ahead and zone out, hell I do it at work sometimes too, but when a customer is directly in front of you trying to give you business that would be a perfect opportunity to snap out of it. Then when I go to speak you cut me off and tell me the waitress with her hands full will take my order. Hmmmm 5 people obviously employed standing around doing nothing while 1 is actually doing any work. Then when my order is ready no one tells me. Instead it sits on the counter, neglected, just waiting for a new home in my stomach. Seriously you can't just walk over an tell me my food is ready? Get ovah yo'self (with 5 snaps in the air and a talk to the hand motion). 2 stars off for the attitude Hat Man.",2.0

"Definitely great staff, super friendly (maybe becasue the managers might have been sitting right there, but non the less)! I read reviews on Yelp and was exited to go. My first surprise was the size of the place, very small. There are about 8 small tables squeezed into one room,  but that does not at all subtract from cozyness of the place. Came there on a weekend- very very high traffic people looking for a table for 3 had to wait at least 20 min. The food is very filling, and the humus has a very specific-sweet taste, not like to once usually sold in supermarkets. In general great food, just for me after eating half the dish (meat humus) I became overwhelmed and stuffed, I took the rest home and happily eat it the next day.  The plate size is average, its just that I shared an appetizer and generally get full quickly.  Definitely worth visiting at least once.",4.0
"Finally made it over to Mimi's Hummus last night for a belated birthday dinner with my two friends. There was a wait for a table at 7:30 on a Friday, so the woman I thought was the hostess suggested we go two doors down and have a glass of wine. She'd come get us, she promised, when our table was ready. We walked over to what turned out to be the newly opened ""Castello Plan"" wine bar - no connection with Mimi's Hummus that we could tell, except they are new business neighbors. More about the wine bar in another review - it was lovely with friendly service - but  we were impressed that the restaurant sent us over there to wait - especially because they have a tapas menu, and Mimi's has beer and wine.Enjoying our wine, but before we got too cozy, the same lovely woman came over to tell us our table was ready. Mimi's is smallish but the high walls and ceilings without too much busy decor makes it feel NOT claustrophobic at all. The menu is short and straightforward, but our waitress left us with the ""specials cheat-sheet"" with 3 appetizer and 2 entree specials. I appreciated her reading the specials to us and letting us know the prices, as well. Homemade pickles and some delicious green olives are complimentary (the refill would have been $2)  and cold water is left in jugs on the table so you can refill your own glass after eating the pickles and olives. We shared the traditional hummus as an app. - fantastic! It's been way too long since I've had hummus that doesn't come from a tub in the supermarket, let alone the freshly made exquisite offering of some pureed and some whole chickpeas with, as has been written below, the perfect balance of flavors. The pita bread was amazing - thick and fluffy - I even liked the wheat, and I'm usually not a fan. Between the three of us, we ordered one shakshuka, one meatball special, and one brisket special. Everyone was happy with her selection. I was happy with the Brisket - don't tell my mom - even better than hers! The portions are just right (even though our American eyes saw them as on the small side when they arrived - trust me, they are just right!) Between the starter wine, the hummus, and our meals, we were stuffed to the gils without finishing our last bites - no room for dessert this time. The prices are very reasonable - the brisket special, served with couscous, was the most expensive offering, at $14. Apps and small plates ran about 6-9 and entrees 10 to 14, I believe. Beer and wine selections on back of menu (I only glanced at them) I think were about 6 to 10. I liked how there were choices for vegetarians and meat-eaters alike. And how you could get a couple of apps or small plates if you couldn't decide, or mix and match with an entree if you were feeling hungrier. On the way out, the hostess bid us farewell. ""Are you Mimi?"" I asked her. She smiled and shook my hand. ""Everything was SO delicious,"" I told her. ""Thank you,"" she smiled, ""that's very good to hear."" I believe she is the owner and chef, so that she appears to be the hostess seems right - she was truly hosting dinner for us, and was very gratified that we enjoyed ourselves. Will definitely go back with my husband, and this time I'll remember to get a take-out menu!",5.0
The service was attentive and resourceful.  The beet-onion-parsley salad was savory and delicious.  The pancakes were chewy and satisfying.,4.0
"State of perfect perseveration... How do you say perfection in Hebrew? My friends and I randomly traveled to this little Israeli restaurant in a quaint part of BK for Sunday brunch and we left in a state of perseveration... we couldn't stop saying perfect to everything that came our way (please excuse me if the effect hasn't worn off).-Perfect Pita and Hummus -Strong Turkish coffee -The smell of the semolina pancakes with honey put me in a trance before I even had one perfectly delicious bite - My friends said their shakshukas (Israeli eggs) were insanely flavorful - The chocolate balls were a perfect way to end the meal -The waitstaff was perfectly attentive Thank you Mimi's for giving me a reason to Yelp! P.S. I don't know why it has $$, it was cheap.",5.0
"Mimi's completely embodies the spirit of the new Cortelyou Road, one of the reasons I love living in this neighborhood. A tiny, cozy hole-in-the-wall, always full because it's just that good. Everything about this place is small: the menu, the kitchen, the tables... but it's not cramped, just intimate. The food is amazing - light and healthy-feeling, but full of flavor. The portions are the perfect size, enough to satiate you without leaving you stuffed. They make an amazing beet salad. The hummus is the best I've ever had and it's made to order. Just go here already!",5.0
"The environment is cozy and charming if not too intimate.  The waitstaff can be warm or a bit pretentious, depending on the night.But the food is spectacular, absolutely spectacular.",4.0
"I found Mimi's looking for meat hummus, and it has won me over! Awesome Israeli food, in a cute, contemporary, and comfy space. The nice tray of real Israeli olives and pickles they start with definitely buttered me up, but the tomato Moroccan soup that followed was not a letdown. Although it was a bit more stew-like than I expected, it was rich and thick with chickpeas and lentils. The hummus with meat is the real deal- nice brown pieces of beef, parsley and pine nuts in the center. The hummus is thick and creamy, and even better with the awesome green schug. Of course you can't have hummus without pita, and this place knows pita. Fluffy and full, and you'd be hard pressed to find better pita in the US! I'm not a Shakshuka fan normally, but husband ordered the special with sausage and I'll admit it was very tasty too. To top it all off, we ended on a sweet note with some yummy almond cookies brought over by the owner. I'll be back when I'm in town, and I can't wait to see the new market and wine bar they are opening next door!",5.0
"Why it took me this long to write a review for Mimi's....IDK...well actually-I have had Mimi's many many times via take out. My friends kept saying, you still haven't been to Mimis..(since I moved to Kensington) in March. So I finally got to go to Mimi's on a Friday night. Totally tiny cute little joint. And Mimi also so tiny and cute, was the hostess...At first glance when you look at the Menu, you think to your self-wait a minute..is this going to be enough? (I know so greedy right!). Anyway, now I see why you have to actually eat here, totally makes the experience worth it. Their specials were lamb meat pie, and wonderful appetizer with hummus, fava beans, yogurt. Everything was simply Fresh, including the whole wheat Pita! We literally cleaned out plates! Hayyy! no shame in our game! My friend and i look at each other...and said..wow I'm full! but still had dessert!
