"Best bar in Willyburg and here's why: Tony Hawk frequents this bar. One of the bartenders here is a dog, don't tell me you're a cat person okay this is a grade-A bartender and you'd be lucky to be served by him. There's a secret door in the bathroom that leads to an underground bare-knuckle boxing club that's one of the most prestigious in the NYC circuit. Also this bar has a drink special where if you bring in every member of an NBA or NHL team you and one friend get free drinks for 1 hour.",5.0
"ATMOSPHERE: Divey little spot in Williamsburg with a nice happy hour. 2fers on beer and well drinks, if I recall correctly. Went on a Friday and the crowd started filtering in around 7. DRINKS: They do have a cocktail specialty, which is the Watermelon Margarita. The ice cube is a frozen mix of the drink and absolutely delicious. It is a bit on the sweet side, though. FOOD: Did not try the food, but they do serve your typical bar food. SHUFFLEBOARD table and decorations combined with friendly staff makes this bar a hot spot for sure.",4.0
"Dardy Bar is one of my favorites in the S. Williamsburg area. The reason why is it fits this particular niche spot between a dive bar and a family friendly place. The crowd is typical 'burgies but the times that I've been no one was overly obnoxious, loud or rude. The vibe suggest 'hey chill out here have a beer or two or six but don't be an A-hole'. The bathrooms are clean enough and nothing feels sticky. String lighting decorates the place adding a little festivity. There's a little smoking area upfront where you can bring your drink with you and outback a small garden area.The bar's specialties are a watermelon margarita which comes with a huge watermelon juice made ice cube. Quite tasty and served year-round so even if you're in the midst of winter, you can come in for a reminder of summer. They also make a mean old fashioned - doing proper pours; and ratios of sugar, bitters, ice.Saturday nights, music gets pumping so be forewarned if you're looking for that quiet spot then.All other days a chill great neighborhood bar.",4.0
"I don't know who put 'Gastropub' here as part of this place's categories but they're wrong and honestly I love this place because it's not. Dardy is where you go for Coors heavy, and enough space to hang out with all your friends without it feeling cramped or crowded. Their cocktails are simple but dangerous, the margarita with watermelon ice cube? You can easily down six of those things before you realize you just had a shit ton of tequila, heavy are the hands that pour here and even though I'm not a regular I get recognized. The only knock is that their food menu is spotty, not that it's bad but it's not available a lot. The times I've been there their menu was unavailable for different reasons which meant that the likelihood of bad decision making went up with nothing to protect my stomach from all the booze.",4.0
"I don't know what dardy means, but this place is pretty dardy. It might just be the dardiest bar I've ever been to.Consider it a slightly fancier dive bar. There's tabletop shuffleboard in the back. Room out front for smoking or lounging. Cool bartenders. And some pretty girls. Dardy girls, even.",4.0
"The atmosphere is good but the bartenders will literally steal your money. You should probably let them have it because they obviously need it more, but just know what you're dealing with when you step into this place.",1.0
"This place is conveniently located a block away from my place, and yet if it weren't I'd still be down to hanging there all the time. The beer is cheap, the drinks are great and loaded with booze, and the owners as well as the bartenders and just about everyone else that hangs out there are good people. I can't speak personally about the food because I don't think I ever ordered any of it, but I know a lot of people who will vouch for their nachos with a burning passion.Great place to have an easy night, great place to have a busy night, Dardy Bar might just have it all for your day to day boozing needs.",5.0
"Great watermelon ice margaritas and gin/ginger drinks. And with Miller High Life in cans, you know you have a good dive bar. Friendly bartender, too",4.0
"I gave this place another try....they charged me for drinks again which I think is total bullshit. I was gonna burn the place down with their cute little ""Dardy"" matchbooks, like my old pal Beast would have done, but then this little elf of a bartender named Lance turned my life around. He gave me valuable advice on women, ramen and even gave me some good film recommendations, even taught me a few jokes. I suggest you call first and make sure Lance is working before you come by. Still pissed they wanted $20 bucks for only like 8 cans of beer, but I might come back, if Rye is closed or something.",5.0
"Great new addition to the neighborhood. I mean hell, where else do you get coors heavy on tap for $4 all night and great eats? Good cocktails too, try subbing for tequila on the ginger bees, its legit. As far as food they make some of the best old school no frills bar nachos around. Fresh ingredients and healthy (not for you) quantities. The rest of the menu is solid (wings, mac n' cheese, guac, etc.) and I can't say I've had anything bad to eat there.Ambience is solid. Not pretentious, just divey enough - interesting bathrooms.  Great bartenders. Outside sections in the front and back and ample space to smoke a cig and drink your beer at the same time.",5.0
"Amazing, cute, and cozy bar. Great for celebrations because even though it's rather small it never seems to be insanely crowded. The nachos are amazing and how can you hate a watermelon margarita. The bartenders are fast and kind and the company's great! One of my favorite bars in the area.",5.0

"This bar is my favorite place to go in Williamsburg.  They have everything you could need.  Great music, great food, and shuffle board!

"Great vibe, music and patrons. Bartenders were cool too. Knocked down a star because we ordered $8 nachos and watched the bartender bare hand scoop tomatoes and onions onto them with zero hand washing. I know they touch plenty of questionable things...so that was....  Not a highlight.",4.0
"Great neighborhood bar run by great people.  Coors specials on the regular with a very cool deck with stools in the entry way. A nice spot in a relatively quiet section of Williamsburg. Good people, good conversation, good atmosphere and good tunes!",5.0

"I'm a regular at Dardy Bar, and it is consistently a blast. Great neighborhood crowd, cheap drinks, awesome music. In fact -- Jimmy & Brian (the owners) always let me request songs and always honor my love for Beyonce, which is a huge plus. Dardy Bar is like that unpretentious friend who'll always show you a good time, and who'll stumble right along with you til the wee hours of the morning with the least shred of judgement. And ladies? There's usually a pretty prime selection of fellas, though they may be properly smashed before you get to chatting. I love ending my night here, it's like the perfect dive-y, dance-y nightcap on my way home.",5.0

"This bar is awesome- owners Jimmy and Brian opened just 4 months ago and it has the best, best vibe. Not your typical Williamsburg bar looking like a faux prohibition wannabe. It is cute, fun,authentic and non pretentious. Must try Margarita with watermelon ice cube, whiskey sour (w egg white) or the locally sourced kielbasa. (Yumm!)   Also the Mac'n'cheese w broccoli is very, very good, they even give you a side of chilli. I also love the drunken Frito Pie. Good music, chill vibes, front porch and back patio- Love this place!",5.0
This place is my new favorite spot in Williamsburg! The atmosphere is really casual and drinks are all well priced. They have daily specials and an outdoor area in the back and front. They serve cool kitchy bar food and the bartenders are always so friendly! Free shuffleboard!Totally spacious. I highly recommend it! Happy Hour is Mon-Friday until 8pm. Also --- Dardy is next door to Rye in Williamsburg --- and not in Bed Stuy!,5.0

"Owners and bartenders are super cool and super chill! Not only will you feel the awesome vibe when you walk in, the owners are also in a band called The Dardy's and love to talk music! My favorite item on the menu is probably the rib dog but I've seen everyone order the nachos so I'm sure they're good too. The artwork on the wall is also available for sale and is updated monthly after an arts event. Jimmy, the owner also mentioned that you can host birthday parties and special events as long as they fit within the schedule. My blog, brokeassstuart.com hosts our monthly event at Dardy Bar and it's always a huge hit thanks mostly to the awesome bartenders! Haven't been there with a DJ just yet but looking forward to making it out one of these nights. Dardy Bar is a regular spot of mine and that's not something I say about places in NYC... ever!

Do yourself a favor and go check it out.",5.0
