"So good! Totally no frills and I always get take out but the food is fresh, well made, and the staff is lovely.We have 3 other places closer to us but these guys have become my go-to.",5.0
"I work in the area and refuse to eat any 'street meat.' I was pleased to discover Sahara Ark. I always order the lamb platter, chunks of lamb, rice and salad. The lamb isn't too tender or too tough, somewhere right in the middle. Lamb is well seasoned and delicious!  Rice and salad is very good as well. The salad is fresh and tasteful. A small lamb platter cost $8.50 + tax. My only complaint is the portion size, a lil more lamb could be included. Maybe, I'm just greedy. Highly recommended.",4.0
"Sahara Ark is honest food prepared to order for a good price. If you come in during off hours, be prepared for relatively slow service, since everything will be made fresh for you. But, while you wait, you will feel welcomed into a real family atmosphere, and may be treated to complimentary tea. The falafel, knafeh and foul are my go-tos. Along with the sense that  I am supporting a locally-owned family business, the food keeps me coming back when I need to grab a bite in the neighborhood.",4.0
"Amazing Middle Eastern fast food but don't let that fool you. We had a mixed meat platter and a veggie one. It was enough to feed three very hungry tourists. Food quality is great, ingredients taste fresh and great seasoning on everything. Especially good surprise was the arabic tea which I had never tasted before.  Excellent place, very affordable prices and delicious food.",5.0
"So I was on my way to order a delicious Mac and cheese from the Brooklyn famous Mac n Shack but I thought about how I wanted to eat healthier and although I'm a glutton for cheese, my health is important. So I saw a clean and new Restaurant. Appealing to the eye and warm. It smelled fresh and delicious. I love my veggies and not to mentioned humus and falafel is my favorite go to for non oily and non meaty dishes. SAHARA ARK Has EVERYTHING light and fulfilling to the appetite. FISH CHICKEN, LAMB, etc. Great service and their falafel for me... well let's just say I don't leave a review if it's not worth it!!! GREAT PLACE!!! BUT DON'T JUST TAKE MY WORD FOR IT!!!",5.0
"This is really good, straight-up Middle Eastern food! I got the chicken kabob platter (small) and it was absolutely delicious! Very fresh and full of flavor. The woman behind the counter was very friendly and when I asked for hot sauce, she gave me both the ordinary kind and their homemade one. GET THE HOMEMADE HOT SAUCE! It's excellent.",4.0
"This place is amazing! Best and cheapest food in the neighborhood. Always fresh ingredients and you can tell they really care about their food. I order from here at least once a week for lunch - chicken kabob sandwich and the baklava are my go-to's. If you haven't tried this place yet, do it!",5.0
My wife and I love this place! This place has the best hummus I've had and you cannot go wrong with any shwarma choice they offer!,5.0
"Great, authentic, made-to-order middle eastern food. Great shawarma, chicken kabob, baklava.",5.0
Get the mixed veggie platter! Fresh and delicious!! Nice family-run place. Will definitely keep coming back.,5.0
Sahara Ark is always my go to spot for kabob.  Their lamb kabob is really on point.  Prices are great and it's quick.  Worth stopping in.,5.0
"Nice, Quiet spot on Fulton street. Appears to be family owned and operated. I just had a delicious middle eastern salad. Very satisfying. The staff was very kind. Would definitely recommend.",4.0

"This is what Clinton Hill was missing: a dependable, cheap but very good Middle Eastern restaurant! Everything is fresh and delicious, the price is right, and even if the place does not look like much it is spotlessly clean and the people in there (obviously,a family with alla generations at work!) are super-nice and helpful. I really like their lamb and the taboule is just outstanding! Portions are large enough to make it two meals. Cannot believe I did not review them yet even if I have been a satisfied customer from day one...",5.0
Very nice place. Low key. Good food. Cheap. Good Shawarma. Very different to what I've had before. Very polite staff. Looks like it is owned and run by family members. We will definitely be back.,5.0
I have extended family from the middle east so I have high standards. This place is super convenient for those of us who live close by. The food is amazing. I always do take out and get enough for the next day too. My recommendation is to get a bunch of sides. The tabouleh is super fresh and has the perfect parsley-bulgur ratio :),5.0
Great neighborhood place! Chicken shawarma and veggie option all recommended. Staff is nice too. Highly recommended,5.0
"The owner, Anis, tries hard to make sure his food is made to please. I come in every other day and he treats me as if it's the first time he has served me. Every time! The customer service is great and the food is good as well as filling. Healthy food made by a good guy.",4.0
